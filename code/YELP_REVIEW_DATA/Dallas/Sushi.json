The only thing this place has going for itself is the amazing location with the really nice patio, 2 stars earned for that.From the moment we came in Friday night the place was busy, not crowded yet which was nice and we were able to get a table outside. Our server started being very friendly and even a little talkative but after deciding we would not be drinking his service instantly went downhill. We saw the busser more than our server, give that guy a raise there wasn't a single water glass unfilled. Anyways, the fiance ended up ordering a Dr.Pepper since we would end up getting a bottle somewhere else and the drink never arrived, perhaps he forgot about it? Well, after ordering our rolls each and every single one of them were given to us by different servers and while that's okay, he didn't seem to bother asking how everything was. (He was too busy chatting with the table next to ours) He was nice enough to bring us the check. Despite the bad service, the rolls weren't anything to come back for.

I can't even.I have always gone to the North Dallas location, and leave pleasantly satisfied. The food is always consistent and hits every sushi craving.This place - OMG. First off, I think they tried to pull one over on my husband by bringing Sapporo instead of Kirin. She came back making a show saying that they ran out of Kirin bottles and if draft is okay, and bust out with Sapporo. Additionally, they made my drink weak as shit. I love lychees and always get the lychee martini. It always comes so strong that I have to sip it slowly. It also comes with a skewered lychee that I like to steep in the vodka to get the maximum amount of alcohol soaked. Well, they gave me juice without a real fruit. I inhaled that thing without feeling or tasting anything. We also got 3 different rolls and they were all mush. The kind of mush that you get from eating old sushi. This is upsetting as Blue Fish was always our go-to sushi spot - even more upsetting that our house is being built a few blocks down. I mean, even the tempura fried ice cream was doughy. Just no. I'm sorry to say that Blue Fish and I are going to see other people."], ["Shelby S.", "I wrote a review a while back about an experience I had at Blue Fish, and I would like to re-write because I have been back 15+ times since then and I love it. I usually go for happy hour and sit at the bar, but I've taken a few people from out of town so we sit at a table. The service is always great and the bartenders are really nice and quick. The volcano roll is the only baked kind of sushi I have ever liked.. It literally melts in your mouth. It is so good and it isn't drenched in sweet sauces like most places. The pieces of scallop are thick and I think the price is fair. The chopped scallop sushi is fresh and delicious and the taste of the fish isn't taken away from sauce. Sometimes I find it hard to choose between the volcano roll and the tuna tower because they're both so good. The wasabi sauce on the tuna tower is wonderful and the fish is always super fresh. The reason I gave 5 stars is because of the happy hour prices. I always get the mini sushi tower and although it's awesome, I think the price should be $4. This place is in a hot spot though, so that probably plays a factor. My one suggestion is to PLEASE put a salmon tower on the menu! They offer a mini salmon tower, but would love to see it on the regular menu. The happy hour drink prices are also really expensive.. Especially for beer, but I will say they have great Sake happy hour on Thursday."], ["Stephen M.", "My experience here was quite pleasant. The staff was attentive and valet was very nice.

And since I lurve me some sushi, as does Sis, The Blue Fish was a no brainer.We sat out on the patio, which was covered and has misting spray, which was much needed in that Texas heat. Our waiter was very attentive to our needs. Sis also thought he was \"like, soooo cute\" but that's what happens when you dine with 18 year-olds. The food and beverage was pretty good! We went all out -- I enjoyed some $2 Sapporo since it was still technically Happy Hour, Sis ordered a plate of calamari (which came with this sauce that was soooo good), and we feasted on 3 rolls: the tempura roll, the California roll, and the Hawaiian roll. The tempura roll was definitely my fave.Speaking of tempura, if you check-in on Yelp, you get a free tempura ice cream! I figured it would be a scoop or 2 in a cup, but no, it was a legit dessert for no money. Huge bowl of tempura ice cream, fruit, whipped cream, the works. Sis and I killed that thing. I'd definitely come again next time I'm in town!"], ["Heather M.", "After a hiatus, I returned to Blue Fish. Twice. I am happy to say that both experiences were great.

The Spicy Tuna Roll was a bit lacking, but the Samurai and Calamari Rolls were tasty. I am happy to be putting my favorite old lunch spot back into my sushi rotation.

It was smooth like butter, and I think it's a limited item as I had never seen it on the menu. \u00a0Bottom line, their sashimi & rolls here are quality. \u00a0It's a little pricier than other sushi restaurants, but given location & quality I understand why. \u00a01 \u00a01/2 Stars.Will I Return? - Probably. \u00a0It's not an automatic return only because The Blue Fish has other locations that are more convenient (Las Colinas). \u00a0But if you like quality sushi & want to take advantage of Lower Greenville's awesome new digs, grab a date and head to The Blue Fish. \u00a0You won't be disappointed. \u00a0 1/2 Star.My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive? \u00a0Perhaps an upscale place? \u00a0No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service. \u00a0But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four. \u00a0It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out. \u00a0Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience. \u00a0I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score."], ["Shannon F.", "Steak sushi? Only in Texas. Excellent food, excellent atmosphere, excellent to show up on a Sunday when they're serving bottles of wine half-off.

The sake prices are insane and they don't taste any better than others i have had. Keep in mind that I have eaten at many of the nicest restaurants in Texas and I think Teppo is the most expensive place i've ever been. I have to consider that it's really designed to exclude people who are not wealthy. \u00a0I can find food just as good at places where i can pay 50% of that price. I came for the yakitori but the sushi was as good as any i've ever had."], ["Tiffany L.", "I love yakitori. I mean, I only found out about yakitori a few years ago, but I love the idea of grilling meats/innards on a stick. So simple, yet so tasty. The first time I had it was in Shanghai and since then I've been looking for yakitori places wherever I go. I've also had it in Taiwan and lemme say, it's good in Asia. Teppo can compare. Although missing a few of the key tasties that I miss from Asia like chicken skin or soft bone or even the chicken heart. The yakitori there is grilled pretty tastefully.

Melting yet firm. Taste clean and sweet. You wait for the familiar hint of fishiness at this point that you know you can accept, but no there just isn't any. It's a new experience! Like you never had before.Sure it's expensive, but you are already sold. Thanks teppo. For taking it all so seriously and demanding this level of greatness. Have been there four times now. Consistently blown away. Rivals any great sushi place anywhere in the world. It's filling a role of the special occasion go-to place for me and wife. Just felt compelled to share!

The food is very fresh, definitely within the top 5 around Dallas. Rolls are carefully crafted, everything I have tried has had great balance of spices.. Very delicious!!! But, the problem I had was with the staff. My friends and I bought 90$ worth of food. We only had 10$ worth of cash left after the bill, so we left a 10$ tip. We knew it was a little low, but it was all we had in cash and rather than waiting another 20 minutes to send our card we decided to choose that route. When we were leaving a lady we haven't seen before who I later learned was a manager said \"did you have bad service?\" Aside from the 2 hour wait for a few rolls which was to be expected, we decided not to mention it and said \"no!\" She said \"then why did you tip so low?\" We explained that we only had 10$ cash. She then flat out said \"you need to pay 18.\" Umm... 18?!?! Do you realize I can feed 4 families at McDonalds with that kind of money?!? That isn't even 20%? I knew we were being treated wrong, but because I was wrong in the first place by tipping low, I borrowed 5 dollars and payed 15 total then walked out. Although I payed 15 she still insisted on the 18. Lady, it's illegal to force tips.

I ordered the spam musubi and the katsu curry rice. The spam musubi was pretty good, although I feel like there might have been a bit too much rice. I really liked the katsu curry rice, I would definitely order it again. It was a pretty decently sized portion. I'm not sure what my friends ordered, but some of their orders came in pretty small portions. So my first experience was pretty decent. I was willing to come again for another spin.The second time, the place was so packed, we had to wait 30 minutes for a table! People really wanted their $1 sushi! So first off, it was $1 or $1.50 (depending on what you get) for a single piece of sushi. Okay, that's not so bad. When our orders came out, though, I was very disappointed. The sushi was small, didn't look fresh in the least, and the seaweed was so rough! I ordered $12 worth of sushi and I was not filled up at all. Not to mention their service was really slow. I honestly would have rather paid $15 for a roll at Densetsu because at least that would have filled me up. Their non-happy hour sushi might be better, but this experience makes me not want to eat anymore of their sushi.So bottom line: I probably won't be coming back.

In all four rolls, the rice wasn't done properly. The tuna in the tuna roll didn't look fresh. Everything seemed near the same quality as grocery store sushi. The Shrimp Tempura Roll was OK, but there was nothing significant about it. \u00a0*On a side note - we had to order rolls where the fish is cooked due to the pregnancy factor, so I had different items this visit from the last time I was here. I would also like to point out that while service has never been a strong point at Yama, our waiter last week was one of the worst I've ever had. 1. He took our drink order then never brought my date the beer he ordered. 2. I asked what kind of fish was in a particular roll, and he replied \"fish\". 3. He purposely avoided our table - and all the other tables he had, for the rest of the night.This took some skill: it's pretty difficult to avoid three tables in a restaurant the size of van.

I love Japanese restaurants that have a lot of varieties to chose from. Only problem was the price. It was a bit pricey for the amount that they give you. The gyutan was $8.50 and at another place I could get a really good one for $5.50.The food was pretty good but it wouldn't be on my top 5. I did enjoy the broth from my boyfriend's Yama ramen. And I loved how soft the rice for the onigiri was even tho it was falling apart. Lastly, our server was quite nice and helped me with any questions I had about the menu and made recommendations too.

I will list the pros and cons we have experienced over multiple visits. Pros: Some of the rolls are fantastic and very well priced! At the end of the day, personal preference plays a large roll your view of price and quality. We haven't had any horrible service but haven't had any outstanding service either. The Sake is pretty good as well.Cons: This is why i have to give them 3 stars. 1) The service has been average at best. For example, on each occasion we have visited, I've had to wait an extended period of time to obtain a refill on my drink (water and my adult beverage both being empty for over 7 minutes), the server was informed we were ready for the bill, and I waited for over 5 minutes, and tables have been sticky. While not all these occur at the same time, I do experience something in terms of my server having me wait an extended period of time for one thing or another. 2) In my opinion, some of the rolls are very over priced for the quality. I'd be just as happy with Wal-Mart sushi and spend less money. Every time we come here for a date or to pick up sushi to-go our bill is always over $50.00. I'd like to try several other rolls, but with so many disappointments, I generally stick to what is good."], ["Jason S.", "I was here while on a business trip to Dallas.

You will not regret it.The service, even though they are constantly running around at full speed, are pretty good about making sure the food is good, your drinks are refilled and are overall quite nice.I am a big fan of their yellow fin tuna and their rainbow roll."], ["Claudia R.", "The service is hit or miss. I went and had the bartender/waiter spill food all over me and never got an apology, let alone something to clean myself off with. When I reported this to the manager he apologized but offered NOTHING for my trouble. We haven't been back since. We used to go once a week. Now it's on a day when we are desperate and not get the idiot waiter as a server. I also need to mention how he never took my order and I was the first to arrive at the sushi bar during a busy lunch hour. Again NO ACCOUNTABILITY from the lame manager for his staff."], ["Alexander C.", "I've written a review on here before, and still think very highly of Oishii. However, I visited last night during dinner hours when the restaurant was packed. This was new to me, as I usually eat here during off hours. I was seated at 7:00pm sharp, and considering the tables were rapidly filling up, submitted my order as soon as I sat down so I wouldn't end up behind many of the tables and get stuck waiting for my food. I'm not sure this mattered. It appeared as if everyone who was already there had been there for a long time. I saw many faces with waning patience. More than once when food showed up at a table, I overheard a, \"Thank God,\" or another exasperated gasp. As it relates to my order, the edamame appetizer took nearly 45 minutes to arrive. It was another twenty minutes before my first two sushi rolls arrived. Then another. Then another. For four rolls and a bowl of edamame, I sat in a very cold restaurant for nearly two hours.It's a good thing that the sushi is amazing, but even still, I don't know that it's worth the wait. I can say that I will definitely be back......for take out."], ["Mandy L.", "Came here for lunch on Friday. I was actually surprised by how busy it was! I would definitely suggest coming before noon if you don't want to wait. The interior was nicer than I would have originally thought.The crab rangoons were delicious and my coworker and I each got the sushi lunch, which is a california roll and one piece of 4 different types of sushi. It was a little steep for $14, but the quality was good.Service was awesome and we never had to wait on refills or additional ginger."], ["Sarah W.", "I love Oishii. I know that sounds weird, seeing as this is a 2-star review, but I really do like them. Their sushi is awesome, their Chinese food is great, and their Vietnamese soups aren't half bad, either. Their crab rangoons are seriously my favorite ever. My boyfriend and I eat at Oishii pretty often, considering I live right down the street. And the food (and sushi) is consistently really good. Why the low rating, then? Because the service has gotten consistently worse over the last six months to the point where I actually hate going to the restaurant! In the last two months or so I haven't been able to get seated in less than 45 minutes, the bar gets crowded and there's a ton of wasted space (so it's awkward to wait the 45 minutes for your table), it takes FOREVER to get food, the food you get comes out in waves, and service is slow (although the staff is for the most part very nice and responsive).While the service is hit-or-miss, the host is consistently terrible! It's gotten to the point that he won't pick up the phone ever and will refuse to submit to-go orders, whether over the phone or in person. On a Thursday night at 8:30 PM they refused to take my order as to-go, insisting that if I was going to order food I needed to wait until a table came open, sit down, and then order! I've never heard of such a thing!!!! I am ordering to-go because I don't want to stay. Just take my order and say it will be 30-45 minutes for food, but don't insist I crowd up your weirdly set-up bar and wait for a table before I can place my order and give you my money.Overall, I think they just under-staff the restaurant and don't have enough cooks (or speedy enough cooks!) in the kitchen. They're a little pricey, but not bad, and the food is great, but don't go when you're famished, because you'll be waiting for FOREVER, and set your service expectations low when you come in."], ["Lindsay F.", "this is the best sushi I have ever eaten.

Everyone deserves benefit of the doubt, especially on a busy Friday night. But hostess hasn't a clue what she's doing, and GM very \u00a0apathetic about it. Hear the food is deserving of rave reviews, but never had the privilege to taste. Had called in a reservation and assured no wait should be expected. Waited 45 min for a six top. Walk-in groups with 6+ sat within 20 mins but not us. Not sure why. Brought this to hostess and GM's attn more than once (and in the least confrontational way possible...worked in service industry prior and know what terrors people can be) but eschewed aside. Finally told by hostess that nearly ready, but must crowd at a table for four with two chairs pulled up at the sides. A bit insulted by this gesture we decided to leave.

It literally melted in my mouth. It was sooooooooo damn good. I also indulged In the summer roll..... Although it's not filling (because it has zero rice and instead wrapped in cucumber) it was still amazing!! ...it had fresh salmon and crab inside. Now I didn't care too much for the G roll..... It was \"awe-ight\" and just a bit bland. I need a pop of flavors happening In this mouth! I also tried the TriBeCa... It's fresh salmon with avocado sandwiched in two pieces of a crispy rice chip..... It was very filling and was very good but I think the chip kinda' overwhelmed the filling, but I still enjoyed it and would order it again. But hands down..... I'm in love with the golden roll. Yum!

The decor is lovely and the sushi bar large. Lunch service was excellent. My old favorite, the Vietnamese fried egg roll was better than ever. Stuffed with finely ground pork and shrimp with onion and herbs encased in a wafer thin egg wrapper; it was perfect. You get a chicken and vegetables one with your entree; but the appetizer pork and shrimp is heavenly. Impeccable food."], ["Lindsey S.", "I'm taking to the internet to make sure everyone knows about the 5 star experience I had at Oishii tonight. To start off, the food and the service was excellent. I highly recommend the Uptown Roll- it was fantastic! We also had two servings each of the mochi ice cream. Omg, the red bean was the best flavor.... SO good. But the real review actually starts AFTER we paid and started to leave.... Earlier that night, we had used the complimentary valet, and I, being dumb, didn't even check to see if I had cash in my pocket to tip the valet (duh....) Well, it turns out, I didn't. So, as we started to leave, I walked up to the valet to ask if I could write him a check because I didn't have cash. Obviously, he said yes because valets work on tips and he wasn't about to leave without getting his tip... (Not that I blame him because it was POURING down rain at this moment). Anyway, I went back inside the restaurant to write my check, and at this point I was struggling to find a pen in my purse. I asked the manager if he had a pen I could borrow so I could write a check to the valet for a tip. Well, one of the waiters walked by and overheard our conversation. He then proceeded to pull $5 from his own pocket (I know how hard waiters work for their money), and handed it to me. I was shocked (in a good way). I think I kept mumbling \"I can't accept this, I REALLY can't accept this.\" Lol. But he said that this would save me the trouble of writing a check for a $5 tip, and to pay it forward. So, I'm paying it forward by letting the internet world know of my fantastic experience at Oishii with a kind waiter who helped out a girl with no tip money for the valet.Also, the food was amazing. The service was great. GO THERE. You won't regret it. :)"], ["Sarah S.", "Love this place! Mainly because I love the tribeca roll ( fresh salmon and avocado stacked between two crisp shrimp crackers with a hint of truffle oil). It's maybe more of a small sandwich-like meal than sushi but it's soo delicious! I have ventured out to try the payesteh roll (secret menu), rainbow roll and the alaskan roll, which are all fresh and well made, but the tribeca roll is where it's at!  Also, they have now added complimentary valet parking, which makes parking in this small lot less irritating."], ["Chelsea R.", "Talk about some sushi lovin'!

I generally like cleaner/pure sushi but we we ate was really good and addicting. \u00a0I wasn't really expecting the menu to be so diverse and for me that was a bit of a turn off. \u00a0This seems more like a social place to meet up with people at work and eat decent food but not really for hardcore sushi lovers."], ["Kev L.", "Oishii is a great place to go to get both either sushi and/or Vietnamese Asian fusion selection.

Service is fast and friendly even when it's busy. I usually have sushi rolls or the sashimi plate."], ["Jeff L.", "When I first visited, the name \"Oishii\" had already been tainted by a janky little sushi spot in Austin. With absurdly cheap rolls, the place didn't have the best food, but it was a college staple for people who needed sushi-like food. So it was a pleasant when I found that the sushi restaurant near me was a classier place with a fully stocked bar. That said, their sushi rolls are \"exotic\" in a way to attract people to how interesting they are rather than being high quality sushi.On the way in, Oishii definitely had a more upscale feel. Nothing too fancy, but it doesn't hurt to dress up a bit (something I hadn't been used to in a while when getting sushi). There's a bar to the left and a dining area to the right, separated by the sushi chefs who get to display their craft for everyone.The level of service seems to vary quite a bit. From the two times I've been, I've had a great waiter who we had a great conversation with and even offered him a drink (which he declined), and also a waiter who can seemingly never be found. Definitely seems to be a bit of a wild card.I can't attest to the non-sushi food as much, but the sushi itself was decent. The staples are always a safe bed (salmon/tuna based rolls with little else), but their specialty rolls were very hit or miss. There was one roll in particular, I believe it was the cowboy roll that sported blue cheese: something that should NEVER be found in sushi (the taste is just so overwhelming and overpowering). Not sure who came up with that idea, but I was definitely not a fan.Oishii isn't a bad sushi place, and it'll definitely suit your needs. They have decent portion sizes for the price, but some of their specialty items can be hit or miss and the service level can wary. But flip a coin, and maybe you'll get lucky."], ["Amanda H.", "Came here before the fire and loved it. Came back soon after they remodeled after the fire and equally enjoyed it. Came tonight and do not think I will ever be back. Out of 4 rolls only one was actually great. Beef tasted freezer burnt. And to make the matters worse the waiter was absolutely horrible. He was a complete snob. Pretty sad because I loved this place."], ["Alexa R.", "This restaurant is absolutely delicious. I may even go as far to say it's the best sushi I have ever had.

I highly recommend trying this place. Wednesday's they have half priced bottles of wine as well!

When we opened our takeout at home, we saw 2 MISO SOUPS and 2 SALADS but NO SUSHI. We called to complain and they refused to refund us and insisted that they had told us that they were \"not delivering sushi\" anymore that night (that conversation NEVER happened). Excuse me, WHAT????? After 30 MINUTES OF ARGUING ON THE PHONE AND BLATANT RUDENESS FROM THE MANAGER, we returned to get our rolls. We ordered spicy crunchy tuna rolls with nothing added, and opened the rolls and discovered they had added avocado when we told them not too. WRONG ORDER FOR A SECOND TIME. We were so fed up and defeated. They refused to acknowledge their mistakes or refund us for our HASSLE AND INCONVENIENCE.

This man even has a sushi roll named specifically after him! He had come here so many times that he one day asked the chef to combine all of his favorites into one roll- I tried this special roll that was only exclusive to him and it was the best thing I had here. Exclusive until now....The secret is now out- it is called the PAYESTEH ROLL. Crawfish in the middle, eel and avocado on top, garnished with eel sauce, spicy mayo, and seven chili powder. Get it and then tell me what you think- let's get this roll on the map!I met the owner too- he was an extremely kind and personable dude. His passion and charisma are reflected in how great his restaurant is. Oishii is a pretty long drive from where I am, but a drive I'm willing to make after the amazing experience I had here. Great work guys. Keep it up."], ["Rosy H.", "Parking here can be ridiculous.

For our first (and only, despite the fish being delicious) trip, we went for a friend's birthday. He called the restaurant at least 2 days in advance to make a reservation for our party (actually 5 days and then increased the number 2 days out). While the food was delicious, the service was so terrible that I rank this meal second to last in my life; second only to the 5 bucks-a-meal milkshake place down the shore who left our table without a check or drink refills for over 1.5 hours. \u00a0At Oishii, we were seated on time for our reservation, \u00a0with about 3/4 our reservation present and ready to be seated. We had 3 more people still to arrive. The odd service, that ultimately became terrible service, started right away. Our waiter took about 4 drink orders (between 11 people) and then disappeared. For those of us who did not get in during the mini-drink order, well, we would not even get a chance to place our drink order for the next 60+ minutes!!! \u00a0To be clear, I sat in a restaurant with a table of 11 other people for an HOUR and not one staff member even asked me if I would like a beverage, let alone to order food. We made two seaparate trips to the bar to secure drinks for our table since our table was not going to get service. Once we FINALLY got to order a beverage, we asked if we could split the check - we were told yes, as long as we split the check 6 ways or less. We said ok that would work, seemingly consenting to being billed with 6 separate checks and we even explained how to work each check (nothing complex, just these 3 next to each other, these 2 next to each other, etc). HAHAHA!Once we finally got to order food, 1 hour and 45 minutes after we were seated, we were told that because the waiter had to make too many trips and put in too many orders to the bar, we could only put in 2 separate tickets for sushi. OK whatever, the waiter failed to once circle the table and ask about drinks and/or appetizers (surprise, we would have spent at least another $250 had you of provided adequate service), that is not our fault. But whatever, we did two large sushi orders and everyone decided not to order any hot meals as half of us had work at 8 in the morning and the other half had arranged to meet another group at a bar after (or so we thought...3 hours after the event started, still stuck without checks at Oishii). But we put in the sushi and waited about 45 for it to show up (completely acceptable for the sushi to take that long to prepare, but not after an hour+ long wait to even order, let alone recieve, a drink).Sushi finally arrived about 2 hours and 15 minutes after we sat down and we were starving so we dug in. One roll of my friends' wouldn't turn up for another 30 minutes, but hey, at least the majority of us got to eat a lil something. Since we had collectively given up on entrees, we asked for our checks as soon as our sushi mostly all came out (except that roll that showed up a full 3 hours after we arrived, we had already asked for checks about 20 minutes before that). We tried to pay, as everyone wanted to either go home and sleep for 5 hours before work or go party more, and were told that we had to put it all on one card, no split checks. Notice above that we were specifically told that we could have up to 6 split checks? Yea, suddenly no, because the waiter didn't handle the table correctly at all. So we, the customers promised separate checks, were penalized. My friends tried to discuss splitting the checks and the waiter got so concerned about us running out on a portion of the bill that I told him to preauthorize whatever he needed on my card, divide the bill as we requested from the get go, and my card would act as collateral for payment. He finally agreed (we are a group of married and nearly married young professionals including one married couple with a baby, we are SO not walking our tab thanks). \u00a0The bill came out about 20 minutes after we started insisting upon it and after the \"you are going to walk the check\" discussion was resolved, we proceeded to divy up the bill as much as possible (a lot of items were on the wrong check), pay, and flee this ridiculous place. Yes, the fish was good hence the 2 stars, but the service was the second worst I've ever had in my life. I have never been so disappointed in a place as I was with Oishii.

The rice portion was decently sized but the other entrees were pretty small in portion size which sucks since It's a pricey joint but I enjoyed my first visit there because of my meal, drinks and company. Would come back again to try some different things.Side note- the place was super empty for a Friday night until our group of forty rolled in."], ["Jeremy S.", "Well place looks great! Really cool.

However, the bartenders were very inattentive and as a bartender myself having worked in high volume bars, this says a lot. I also had tabs at both the downstairs and upstairs bars...when I closed my tab upstairs, they failed to give me an itemized receipt copy. I thought nothing of it until I closed my downstairs tab and learned that gratuity was included, so I essentially tipped the upstairs bartender twice.

He then remembered what I had and came back with that 10 min later. The experience was \"ok\" but I'm sure it would be better during prime hours. It took us longer to eat and leave since our server was pre occupied with many other things. All in all, I would go back to make sure my experience wasn't bad but would also look for other options next time."], ["Mo A.", "We really enjoyed a variety of items but my bone in Ribeye was very good.

Yes, their coconut thai curry soup! It's literally the best version of Tom Kha that I've had in Dallas. It's a little pricey, but it's filling.

He explained as much as we wanted to know and he suggested some killer dishes. The whole staff was awesome really.But the sushi was super fresh and yummy and then Travis turned us on to other amazing dishes like the noodles etc.I could go on.

The rice was good! The rolls were unique and tasty! But the overall experience was so terrible it doesn't even matter. 4.

Their other rolls were all $18-20+ and all featured snow crab or cooked fish - those are not my favorite. The spider roll did not taste fresh and it was tiny at that. I really enjoyed the miso soup and had a friendly server at the bar, until it came time to pay my bill and I waited 20 minutes in spite of others being served on either side of me.

I added a star since they participate in the HHonors Dining Rewards."], ["Megan C.", "I ate at Kenichi during a private event at the restaurant, so I cannot comment on the overall quality of the restaurant and its service during normal business hours, however I did experience a pretty complete tasting of the menu over a lunch engagement.The atmosphere at Kenichi is very sexy and swanky, more so than one might expect in Dallas, but this is the up-and-coming Victory area, and situation near the equally-swanky W Hotel et al, so it definitely fits in with its surroundings. Even the restrooms (upstairs by the big gong) are dripping with style and substance. Given the impression provided by the ambiance, decor, and furnishings, I was expecting food of similar style and sizzle, with great taste and presentation to match. I wasn't very impressed, as the food itself was on the bland side, and the maki rolls seemed to be messily and hastily put together, with rice and nori not playing well together. The seared salmon was a bit boring, and left we wanting for more. Avocado, cucumber, crab, and tuna all tasted tired and lackluster to me. Even the wasabi couldn't make it dance.It would seem as though Kenichi is resting its laurels on the fact that it has sisters in Aspen and Hawaii, and a very sweet spot in a hip spot in Dallas, but that can only fuel it for so long if its sushi and Japanese-inspired cuisine can't keep up."], ["Jerry M.", "OMG!

The Sake selection is excellent, and I splurged on a great Saki the commented the meal nicely. The Sushi chef gave me a small sample of some squid salad that I loved. Nice customer service touch! I also tried the Maple Brussels Sprouts because I love Brussels Sprouts, but I didn't enjoy them as much as the rest of the meal. They were unexpectedly spicy, and not knowing the Japanese term in the description I was caught off guard with the Maple title. It was good, the Sprouts were cooked al dente the way I like them, but I found them a tad bitter. I withheld one star, because my water glass ran dry and I waited a long time for a refill.

As some others have said a lot of the dishes have very Japanese ingredients in them. Sometimes there are other things that are more Chinese like black bean. Overall it's a great restaurant.

Salmon over Uzu dressing which is typically a very Japanese citrus salad dressing that I love. \u00a0Had a delicious sushi roll that was slightly over done but had lots of tuna in it, so was good to me. \u00a0To be honest, I don't think much of their sushi and sashimi is \"authentic\" Japanese.We also had a soft shell crab appetizer which was excellent but kind of small for 2 people to share. For the entree we had some cod it was good but not memorable. It did have some crab in the dish which blew my mind. Ended the meal with an epic lava cake which we had to wait about 15 minutes for since its made to order. Completely worth it so waiting ain't no thang. Friendly wait staff. Oddly located bathroom on the second floor.

Being that it's in the middle of downtown, the price tag is also pretty high, so consider yourself warned.Their ribs (I know, ribs at a Japanese place?) is so good! The meat nearly just falls off the bone. I used my chopsticks and pulled at the meat, and the whole thing just came off. Their fried tofu is also very good, but it was sitting in a really salty sauce, so I kind of wish they would put the sauce on the side for dipping instead. Their sushi is pretty normal, but they also serve fresh wasabi here for an additional $3. If you're like me and love that burn-your-nostril-clear-your-sinus sensation... GET the fresh wasabi! it's worth it and you can tell a big difference!!! It only takes a little bit with the soy sauce, and they blend so well together. Nearly brought tears to my eyes.I think this is more of a special occasion type place rather than a weekly satiate-your-sushi-craving based on the price tag. Either way, I would recommend this place."], ["Ashley S.", "Don't go here. Seaweed salad is identical to every other sushi restaurant out there. Nothing special, yet double price. Same with the rolls. Charge twenty two for rolls? Give me a break. Was hoping the roll would at least be worth it. Much better rolls for half the price at Sushi Zushi. Husband's miso cod came with two match-stick-size carrots. Otherwise, plain jane. Go to Mercury Grill instead for their miso cod. Amazing. Slow service and they messed up our order twice.

Well, Kenichi was up, and I love sushi...So I made some reservations online (okay, I'm pretty sure I've said it before, but I'll say it again - that is so f-ing cool), and we showed up about 15 minutes before our reservation. I believe that we ended up waiting about an hour to an hour and a half before we were seated. Such is the beauty of the Groupon. :(However, I will say that the staff handled the fact that we had to wait quite well. We were greeted by one of the local Kenichi babes, and she chatted us up here and there. Then we also got a free drink courtesy of one of the liquor companies doing their little pro-mo thing there. As soon as we were finally seated in one of those really cool \"private\" booths (there's a sheer curtain you can pull across the area), we received a free Blake roll. It was actually probably my favorite. We ordered a few other things, nothing that really sticks out because it was just all quite delicious. Half way through out meal, we received another free item (the Salmon and goat cheese dish)... and while it wasn't as good as the Blake, free is very nice. Very, very nice... and quite unexpected - which made it all the more pleasing.The ambiance is fun, club-like, and loud. But it's a fun place to spend an evening (provided you're not looking for something romantic - even with the semi-private booth). Upstairs they have a DJ and he plays the young club music... which is not really my thing, but totally matches the crowd and ambiance. The staff was attentive w/o being annoying (again, could just be because it was so busy - but I liked it regardless). Overall, it was a little on the rough side, but they handled it well, called me a few days after dining there to make sure that everything was okay (kinda cute), and it made me feel a young (certainly nothing wrong with that every now and again). Is it going to rock your world? Most certainly not. Is it a fun place to get some pretty good sushi and maybe even get your club dance on (or just make you feel young if, like me, you don't dance)? Most definitely."], ["Cynthia T.", "When you walk in the door of Kenichi, it looks like it'll be your swankiest sushi experience. \u00a0I went there for dinner and my eyes were greeted by a lit up bar, lounge like decor and furniture, and my ears were bombarded with crowd noise and la musica. \u00a0I walked into the dining area and my nose was enticed by the fresh food being served to seated patrons. \u00a0I sat down, touched the menu and was ready to order!Thanks to a Groupon deal, I got to splurge a bit with my friends so we tried a LOT of food! \u00a0My favorites from our meal were the following:1. \u00a0Miami roll (Scottish salmon, shrimp, crab & avocado wrapped in cucumber with a sweet red onion sauce)2. \u00a0Escolar Aburri Sashimi (5 pieces, torched escolar with white truffle white soy)3. \u00a0Yellowtail Serrano (Serrano pepper, basil vinaigrette)4. \u00a0Kenichi Aspen(snow crab, tuna, avocado rolled inside out, topped with smelt eggs)I have never eating anything like the Miami Roll before, so inventive, fresh, and delicious! \u00a0I don't recommend their Calamari. \u00a0I LOVE calamari but was disappointed to bite into what seemed like a fish stick - basically squid paste, shaped into a bite-sized stick, breaded and fried.Our service was good, considering it was a Saturday evening and our waiter was very friendly and helpful. \u00a0They also have an upstairs lounge area with full bar and a DJ spinning the tunes. \u00a0Oh and their restroom was totally clean and matched the restaurant in its decor - hey if I feel hip and comfortable even in your restroom, that says something!Yes, it is a bit pricey but you're praying for the ambiance and some creative food. \u00a0I recommend making reservations because it gets busy!"], ["Mika S.", "Eating here made me feel like a judge on Iron Chef.

It was our first time there, our friends' second. They were so impressed on their first visit that they bought us a gift certificate and then held a gun to our heads to force us to invite them to come along.We are sushi aficionados and not easily impressed, but Kenichi earned our respect and our return business too. In these days when so many sushi joints have non-Japanese sushi-makers who got their training off the inside of a matchbook cover, it was wonderful to visit a restaurant where the choices and freshness of the fish, the inventiveness of the menu -- indeed, the professional supervision of the entire process from fishing boat to table -- make it clear that someone(s) really knows what he's doing.We ordered a lot of food -- close to the full range of a la carte sushi and sashimi, from salmon to sea urchin, plus four different specialty rolls and a couple appetizers \u00a0-- and found no disappointments anywhere on our table. My wife is a big chirashi fan (assorted sashimi on a bed of rice, all served in a large bowl) but it wasn't on the menu. Just for the heck of it we asked if they would do a chirashi bowl for her. Not only did Kenichi produce one of the best chirashis she has ever had, but the master sushi chef himself proudly brought the bowl to the table, along with something we had never seen: a small container of sauce that he recommended for drizzling over the sashimi. Throughout our meal the wait staff was attentive, courteous, and always willing to explain in layman's terms this, that and the other dish.Some of the reviews of this restaurant have complained that the sushi is overpriced. We say it is pricey, but at Kenichi you pay for the ambience, the decor, the location, and the professionalism of the staff, as well as the quality of the food. These people are pros and their establishment is spitting distance from the American Airlines Center, so they are accustomed to spiriting famous people into out-of-the-way booths and satisfying their Japanese-fusion needs. This is UPTOWN DALLAS, people ... of course it is expensive. Complaining about the price here is like going to Morton's and bitching that their ribeye costs more than the one you get at Chili's.So the moral of the story is, wonderful dining experience, and worth the extra bucks. If the price is that bothersome to you, stick with Chili's. Or bring the title to your car. It will be worth it."], ["Deborah L.", "I came here tonight with pretty low expectations - we live in New York and felt like we needed some light, non-greasy food and picked this place because the seafood was reputed to be fairly fresh (for somewhere inland). \u00a0And being from New York, I wasn't really expecting sushi that was better than what we could get, nor was I necessarily surprised by the small portion sizes and menu prices. But let's not get ahead of ourselves and break it down:THE AMBIENCE is trendy lounge and we were dressed very casually for walking around the city so we were initially a bit worried that we would be too under-dressed to be seated. \u00a0The place was empty except for a few tables and the staff were very nice, so we needn't have worried.THE SERVICE is friendly, but shockingly slow given how empty the place was. \u00a0I counted about 6 people in the kitchen, 2 of them being the sushi/sashimi chefs, 3 servers and 1 hostess for about 3 patrons at the bar and 4 tables (1 large party of about 6 or so, 1 medium party of about 4, and 2 parties of 2 including us). \u00a0We walked in and were seated immediately and ordered 4 dishes, 3 of which were sushi/sashimi type dishes and 1 side order. \u00a0The first 2 dishes came relatively quickly, but the last 2 took a very long time to come.THE FOOD is actually pretty good and lives up to the reputation of being fresh. \u00a0We ordered the Godzilla roll, diver scallop hot stone, yellowtail tataki with a side of roasted fingerling potatoes (yes, out of place I know but we needed the carbs to fill us up given the small servings we expected). \u00a0Serving are small \"tasting plate\" sizes, but you expect that at a place like this. \u00a0The Godzilla roll was excellent, the diver scallops also quite good and the yellowtail tataki also good, if a little over-seasoned in the yuzu sauce.THE RESTAURANT'S ABILITY TO DEAL WITH DISTURBANCES is terrible. \u00a0That 1 large party of 6? \u00a0It was an extremely rowdy group which included 2 very young screaming children running amok and 2 very loud-mouthed profanity uttering boozed up adult males. \u00a0If I wanted to have my ears assaulted with bad renditions of \"Who Let The Dogs Out\" with liberal cussing and non-stop whooping and yelling of \"SHOTS!!!\" I would have chosen to go to a dive bar instead. \u00a0If I wanted to eat in the same place as undisciplined children, I would have chosen to go to McDonalds or some other chain restaurant. \u00a0To my utter embarrassment for them - because they had none for themselves - they had been placed in a \"private booth\" in the very back of the restaurant, yet somehow they were loud enough to disturb the patrons both downstairs with them and in the upstairs lounge area as well. \u00a0One very well dressed couple (the lady was dressed in a floor length evening gown) trying to enjoy a romantic date night needed to request a change of table so they could get a little further away from the chaos - not that it did them much good, since they were loud enough to drown out the background music and all other dialogue in the restaurant.I get that it was a horribly slow night, it was a large party and they were spending big, but that's no excuse to let badly behaved patrons get away with such blatant disrespect and discourtesy. \u00a0There was zero effort made by the staff to ask that group to behave in a more seemly manner. \u00a0Combine that with the slow service, and you end up with a ruined night and a huge headache at the end of it all.Just ask that poor guy who probably spent a lot of time planning a wonderful evening for his beautiful lady friend who probably spent a very long time getting dressed and getting ready for what they probably anticipated to be a very romantic date...and got the most unromantic experience, ever.Giving 2 stars out of pity because the staff honestly looked completely harrassed and jumped every time the kids screamed or the boorish men yelled and probably had their hands tied and weren't allowed to do anything to jeopardize a nice big cheque and tip. \u00a0If I were to be brutally honest, the overall experience is a definite 1 star. \u00a0I will not be back. \u00a0I will not be recommending this place to anyone. \u00a0Yes, it was 1 isolated group that ruined my evening. \u00a0But when I'm spending this kind of money at this kind of restaurant which positions itself as upscale, I expect an experience to match. \u00a0Yes, it's the fault of that badly behaved group, but when some people just don't know any better, I would expect the manager to step in so that one group doesn't ruin the night for the entire restaurant."], ["Linda T.", "I had an exceptional time hosting a large event at Kenichi.

I really enjoyed the Friday Night Roll which had cooked salmon, snow-crab meat, and tempura flakes. The basil fried rice was pretty good,but it was really heavy in the sweet basil so eat slow or you'll get full fast.They also serve \"fresh\" wasabi for $3 extra (I didn't know at the time until the bill arrived).

Anytime Darvish gets 8 strikeouts or more, sushi the next day is half off. Ben and Skin are always talking about it, and hosts name drop Kenichi all the time in the Rangers pregame show.My wife and I came on a weeknight around 8 to finally try this place out. It's in a cool part of town, but the place was empty. There is a bar near the entrance that had several employees around it watching the Rangers game on TV. The hostess came over and asked how we found out about them, we mentioned the Darvish special, and she said we would need a reservation to take advantage of the special.At NO TIME do they ever mention in their marketing that a reservation is required; I've heard radio show hosts talk for two months about Kenichi and they never mention a reservation. She would have sat us down right then if we didn't want to take advantage of the special, but we left and decided to make a reservation the next time Darvish did his thing.We come back the next week after I make a reservation, and the place is empty again. Pretty strange considering it's two stories and fairly big. Staff was watching the game, but the hostess came by to seat us in an area all by ourselves. Our drinks took pretty long considering we were the only couple there, and the food took an extremely long time. I asked about twice what the delay was. We ordered regular sushi rolls (tuna, salmon, nothing special) and it just took forever.The food was good. After it arrived though, our waitress vanished for long periods of time and I actually had to get up and go to the bar to ask for another drink and a water refill. When I get back, the waitress asks my wife if she wants another drink, and she clearly said no. I ask for a check, and then 5 minutes later she comes back with another drink and a check that already has that new drink listed on it. I told her we didn't ask for it and that I wanted it removed from the check, and she tried guilting me into just keeping the expensive drink and paying for it. We sent the drink back and she comes out with a new check and says 'We mandate a 20% gratuity on all orders with the Darvish special'. I don't have a problem paying that gratuity and probably would have done it anyways as the food was half off, but shouldn't this be something they tell customers before they sit down?tl;dr \u00a0good food, poor/slow service, they don't tell you key details on the special they're having until you show up/after you eat."], ["Rich L.", "It Restaurant Week so, hide yo kids, hide yo wife, hide yo kids, hide yo wife, and hide yo husband, and go book a table.Broke in RW with a stop at Kenichi. \u00a0I purposely got there early to sit a the bar and make love my tonic and gin. \u00a0Margaret at the bar was great. \u00a0She kept my glass full and shared her favorite things on the regular menu and made some suggestions on the Restaurant week menu.Once the whole party was there, we were seated promptly. \u00a0Not \u00a0crowded but filled up as the sun set on this sultry Sunday. \u00a0Our waiter eagerly shared that it was his second day, so the bar had been set. \u00a0No big deal. \u00a0He did an ok job but if we had a question, ie. what wine is comparable to the we just had at the bar but you're now out of, and he didn't know the answer, he would simply walk away without even an \"Let me check\". \u00a0Then on the flip side, the waiter would occasionally linger around and join the conversation as if he were dining with us. \u00a0Awkward.But the food was scrumptious. \u00a0The spicy edmame was something new to me and why doesn't everyone do this. \u00a0Good drop kick to your tongue. \u00a0My sushi platter and a good variety including a roll with fruit wrapped around it. \u00a0They also offered a steak entr\u00e9e with some creamy goat cheese mash potatoes and a salmon entr\u00e9e. \u00a0For me, it was bookended by some spicy Dynamite Prawn app and a fruit and coffee ice cream. \u00a0All in all a really good experience.Kenichi wah bitches."], ["Jen S.", "This place rocks.

The appetizers that toted local and farm-to-table aspects looked nice and the wild boar pot stickers were pretty good.

It LOOKS nice but in the end it tasted terrible. The fried popcorn crawfish was over-fried to the point of being chewy. The temperature of the crab layer that lays on top of the sushi pieces was both hot and cold in spots that speaks to a lack of attention to detail. The mixture of flavors were \"interesting\" pairings and the fish in the underlying roll was \"on the edge\".Neither my date nor I could eat the roll it was so bad. We left more than 80% of it on the plate. I told the waitress we really didn't like it. She walked back and rang up the bill anyway. As she walked back she turned around and consulted with another lady who looked to be the manager, they conferred a bit and then she gestured to still deliver the bill.If you are the kind of person who can be excited just because you are \"eating sushi\" then this is your spot. If you expect your sushi to actually taste OMG good and have great service then I would never recommend this place.

It was legit. Most of the time when you get a veggie roll, it is either cucumber or avocado. I love to see the creativity and great flavor in rolls like this. The eggplant had almost a eel-like look to it. Very well done! I also ordered the Miso Ramen. I asked them to leave out the ground chicken and the egg which was not a problem for them to do. The broth was very flavorful and the ingredients were fresh. The combination of the miso and the sweet corn was great. The noodles were decent.

I tried their Chanpon, this huge bowl of noodles and seafood, and it really reminded me of saimin. \u00a0Another comfort food item for me here at Sushi Bayashi! \u00a0It had slices of fishcake in it too and was loaded with noodles. \u00a0It could have fed at least three people in total.The tuna sashimi was fair as well and I'm so glad they had futomaki. \u00a0Unfortunately it had a piece of avocado in it, but it wasn't enough to make me gag. \u00a0I love how they have house made soy sauce too and fresh wasabi as an option. \u00a0The sushi in general though is just average, which may be the reason why the prices are so affordable.If I haven't convinced you yet with their cheap sushi and delicious Japanese pumpkin, come here and get a bottle of $15 wine for your cheap date. \u00a0Seriously, just don't let her look at the check. \u00a0She will think you took her to a fancy place in Trinity Groves when it's actually the most reasonably priced restaurant there ;)"], ["Trinh T.", "Sushi Bayashi at Trinity Groves is the latest addition to Trinity Groves. \u00a0A true Japanese restaurant, Bayashi serves up quality \"Tokyo style\" eats, including quality sushi & ramen. \u00a0Another bonus is the prices are pretty good, as most TG restaurants are a little higher in price.My Overall Rating - 4 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)Atmosphere - Sushi Bayashi has a really cool feel. \u00a0Inside you'll find long, communal tables & a large chalk board in the back with the menu. \u00a0 Additional cool touches include Japanese banners hanging from above and large containers on the side. \u00a0It has a really unique, open feel and when combined with good weather, it is extended into the patio. \u00a01 Star.Service - Our server was nice & attentive. \u00a0We went opening week and while general service was good, I would have liked to have known more about the menu & concept. \u00a0But like I said, general service is fine, I just think there was a lost opportunity to differentiate. \u00a0 1/2 Star.Food - The one thing that drew us to Sushi Bayashi was the fact they served ramen. \u00a0The good news is the Tonkatsu Ramen had a nice, flavorful broth. \u00a0The ramen was soft and pork & egg were great additions. \u00a0I wish I could have ordered extra items to add a la cart like at Tei-An, but it was a quality bowl. \u00a0The hamachi kama was also a favorite, with lemon pepper brushed on top and grilled Hamachi. \u00a0You can also order freshly grated wasabi. \u00a0For dessert we went with the fried udon, which was like eating a chewy funnel cake (this is a good thing). \u00a0We finished with ice cream wafers which ended our unique meal. \u00a01 \u00a01/2 Stars.Will I Return? - Yes. \u00a0Not only is Sushi Bayashi a nice addition to Trinity Groves, it's a great Japanese restaurant for Dallas. \u00a0I will come back for the atmosphere, fried udon, and quality ramen. \u00a0Another great option for TG!My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive? \u00a0Perhaps an upscale place? \u00a0No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service. \u00a0But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four. \u00a0It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out. \u00a0Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star.

Ate here with the boyfriend one night and was pleasantly surprised. So good we came back a few nights later. The broth is milky and flavorful, the noodles cooked al dente, the meat cooked to perfection, and the sprouts are a delightful new twist. Apps are good too. Wish they had more skewer dishes. Agedashi tofu, baby octupus, uni nigiri, and gizzards are some of our favorites from what we've sampled. \u00a0Sushi not as fresh as Teppo or tei an but, eh, I come for the ramen! We'll be back more to stuff our faces. It's good stuff. Also, communal sitting is a bit awkward for some people but here they have a red divider. That privatizes your space some. And with the noise level. You still have plenty of elbow room too. They carry a good selection of Asian beers."], ["Leah S.", "Dinner here was okay but I probably wouldn't go back. We ordered 2 appetizers and the waitress came back around 20 minutes later and said they didn't have pork for the pork gyoza so they could substitute. We said that was fine, but what She didn't tell us was that our food was already on the way out, so we got our appetizer half way through our meal. The food all came out at different times, my father got some of his sushi probably 30 minutes before I got mine. If the food was worth the wait it would be fine, but it was just okay. Not good, not bad, but definitely not worth being so expensive. I won't be back."], ["Emily H.", "Another place in Dallas that serves legit tonkotsu ramen! (The other place is at Tei-An.) \u00a0We found out about Sushi Bayashi from the Urban Daddy website; turns out they just opened this past Tuesday. There's a good balance of items on the menu between appetizers to share, curry bowls, and noodle dishes. There's also a separate sushi sheet with your standard nigiri pieces and usual Japanese rolls. The ambiance is very Trinity Grove-esque with modern decor, shared tables, and an outdoor patio. Although there weren't any people standing, it looks like there's even a raised table area next to the wall where you could potentially stand and eat (sort of like the standing ramen places in Japan's subways). Our favorite dishes: Tonkotsu Ramen: The broth is very authentic, full of flavor, and hearty. The noodles are silky, thin, and with the right amount of bite. The pork belly melts in your mouth. The only comments I would have are less bean sprouts and the broth served hotter. Otherwise, this was my favorite dish of the night.Octopus Croquettes: This is an American adaptation of the takoyaki. Instead of round puffs, these are flat like...croquettes. There's a good amount of octopus chunks and a nice punch of ginger taste (which I love). Definitely made in house with very fresh ingredients.Sweet Age Udon: This was a dessert that tasted like funnel cake, except that it is fried udon noodles, topped with powdered sugar and served with a thick honey syrup. YUM! A little too much fried stuff for two people to split -- probably better split between 3-4 people.We also ordered the hamachi kama (well seasoned, but could use a bit more crispiness) and the chanpon noodle (also good, but preferred the tonkotsu ramen more). Being in Trinity Groves, you'd expect your meal to cost a fortune, but everything is very affordable. Most appetizers are $5-8, the noodle dishes were $10-12, and dessert was $4. Service was also extremely friendly and helpful. We'll be back!!"], ["Judy T.", "Hands down, the best sushi I've had in awhile. For those who don't know what it takes to have impeccable sushi, this is the place to go. (Meaning you'll get a tightly wrapped seaweed roll with flavorful fish!) A tip, whenever eating sushi, don't overpower the roll with soy sauce. However, they do have a good house soy sauce that they make! I suggest the Gizzard as starters. Meal wise, get the Negi Hama \"hamachi\" roll and the Negi Toro Taku roll! You can't go wrong with those two. The simplicity of the menu give this restaurant the opportunity to really display their quality of food. As for sake, I loved the Kurosawa! perfect if you're wanting something smooth and delightful. I will be back, definitely.Oh and service was also great!"], ["Jeff Z.", "1st time here. Food is very good!... To my surprise. Ramen broth is excellent! Very authentic!

It's a Japanese restaurant that has sushi. But I made my mistake and ordered only sushi. The sushi was good and priced regularly but there was nothing ecstatic about it. The portions were fair and the quality was high but the options were limited. Looking at the food menu, there wasn't really that much to go off of either. I should have probably ordered from the huge chalkboard that had a bunch of specials on it but it went largely ignored cause no one brought our attention to it and by the time we noticed, we had already ordered. The service was quick though and the seating arrangement was awesome! It felt like a good mix between modern and traditional so it made the meal pleasurable.

If you get one take away from this review it should be to order that! Huge chunks of delicious tuna & all kinds of amazing sauces with lovely avocado. Mmmhm!

Let me clarify, our waiter was awesome, but aside from that, this place needs to work out their kinks.We ordered ramen and a wazen and it took 50 minutes to come out. 50 minutes for broth that should already be pre-made and some fish that requires NO cooking (sashimi). While observing other diners, I saw that the other waiters delivered food to the wrong table at least half a dozen times and somewhere around the 40 minute mark, I noticed that the tables next to us (2 tables) left before receiving their food. Ironically a new couple got seated next to us and about 15 minutes into their food wait the manager came out and apologized to them for the wait (hello, what about the people who waited 50 minutes)?Despite all of this, the food was a notch above decent. The spicy ramen was to date, the best ramen we have had in Dallas (that's not saying much). It is fairly priced at about $12. The sashimi wazen on the other hand is absolutely a steal. You get a variety and a TON of sashimi for $20 (also, a mini appetizer and soup)! The sashimi is fresh, but the sushi chef must be inconsistent as some slices were beautifully presented while others looked like a 5th grader carved them out in chunks. Either way, fresh is fresh, especially if fresh doesn't cost an arm and a leg :) \u00a0will hopefully give this place another chance, hopefully this time I won't have to starve to death before getting my food."], ["Tiffany Grace E.", "Love the ambiance and location & the styling and decor was wonderfully put together. \u00a0The music playlist was great, but was definitely NOT fitting for an Asian restaurant (jazz/20s music? I'm confused about what the vibe is supposed to be here...). \u00a0As far as the food, 1/3 of the menu was crossed off. \u00a0The crawfish on our crawfish dynamite roll was extremely fishy and ramen was full of big sheets of nori, which we didn't really care for. \u00a0The only thing I really enjoyed was the tofu. \u00a0It was perfectly crispy on the outside and seasoned very well. Overall, average food & service. \u00a0Would not recommend unless you're in the area and extremely hungry and can't get a seat at the other restaurants in Trinity Groves."], ["Randy S.", "Like most of the other restaurants in Trinity Groves, this place has a nice ambience and is of course quite new. \u00a0A quick glance at the menu when I dined there showed that they tried to keep things to the basics more or less, with a few dishes thrown in there that are fairly unique. \u00a0You won't find a list of 20 robata items or things like that here (unless the menu has changed since I last went).I went with a large group of people and we were seated quickly and without issue. \u00a0Almost everyone ordered either the ramen or the katsu curry. \u00a0I figured I migiht as well try the fish so I ordered the wazen with a sweet potato dish as a side. \u00a0The sweet potato dish was tender and well seasoned while the slices of sashimi tasted fresh and wonderful. \u00a0Surveying my tablemates, a common complaint about the ramen was that it was too salty. \u00a0However, I can't vouch for that fact myself.Overall, another nice addition to the Trinity Groves area. \u00a0Not on my list of places to go to, but it offers some staple Japanese cuisine and gives you and your friends more options when frequenting the area."], ["Hubert D.", "I really wanted to like this place. The prices are reasonable. It has a cool and modern decor with a very open feel. It's community style seating with long tables. I don't mind that. It makes it feel more fun.Unfortunately, the food was really lacking. It reaaaallly misses the mark. For an appetizer, I got the braised pork belly. It looked truly juicy and tender, but once I got passed the outer layer of the large chunk of meat, I found out that it's pretty tough and dry on the inside. Sadness. :( I also had the tonkatsu ramen. It looked like bean sprout soup when it came out. So many bean sprouts! There was one piece of chashu pork, which wasn't too flavorful, and one soft boiled egg (non-marinated) that didn't add anything special to the dish. The noodles were plentiful and silky, but a little too much in terms of amount. The broth was good, but not good enough to elevate the rest of the dish. Sorry, but the two dishes I had just really missed the mark. I get that it's new and hopefully they'll work out the kinks.

Our waters were like the kind of salted water your mom made you gargle with when you were a kid and had a sore throat. Like the water you accidentally swallowed when a wave knocked you over on the beach when you were 8.And the worst part was the waiter didn't believe us! So then we watched as he and the bar staff tried our water, all 6 of them, spat the salted water out and then looked into the water glasses with looks of horror. And then brought us normal water AND NEVER APOLOGIZED!!!! What is wrong with the service industry these days? \u00a0When we finally got to the food it was okay, but my taste was really thrown off from the water. The octopus croquettes and the Japanese eggplant rolls were my favorite, like quite good. The spicy tuna suffered from mushy rice and not enough tuna or spice, and the spicy salmon was made with lox. Which was not what I expected or how the roll was described.All in all...the sushi was not good enough to combat the jaded service or the ocean blast water."], ["Mary B.", "I love sushi, but I have a hard time finding sushi restaurants that I really like. Usually, I look for great quality fish at a reasonable price. There are sushi places in Dallas - and they are ok. There are some in Carrollton that are pretty good, but that's far away. I'm thrilled about Sushi Bayashi! I can't believe that there is a sushi restaurant so awesome that is so close to my home!I had the Wazen, the Uni, and the peach sparkling sake. I haven't had sparkling sake in a long time (I had it all the time in San Francisco same with sushi). So having a little bottle of that made my night. As did the Uni - super fresh! Same with the seaweed wrap, wasabi and ginger. Great fresh flavors! The Wazen was absolutely incredible! The fish tasted amazing and melted like butter in my mouth. The squash appetizer was addictive - I want to come back for more! I loved the sweetness. The tempura was light and fresh and the batter/fry didn't overpower the veggies or shrimp - just complemented them nicely. And the soup was light and flavorful.They had this monkfish pate special that I wish I had room to try - I was too full. I regret not getting some to go!

The food is like your usually neighborhood cafe, but with the japanese flare. The rolls are lightly dressed and seasoned. The fish is fresh and the specials sell out quick. \u00a0The menu is best looked at from a far point of view... meaning that the large chalk board you see is majority where you should order from. Always try a few of the special items. Again my favorite thing about Sushi Bayashi is the sake. Well priced and many options.

He wanted to give it a try anyway so off we went.I love the area. It's connected to other restaurant patios. Cool, minimalistic atmosphere. Long, communal tables, which look great, but not sure how I'd really feel had I had to sit by random strangers that could listen into my conversations. Tonight, we got the Hamachi Kama as an appetizer. Soft, flaky fish and dipped in a light sauce. Two thumbs up. Kinda wish it had a little side of grated daikon like other sushi restaurants. We also ordered the Fresh Salmon Sashimi and Uni Sashimi. Everything was really fresh and oh so satisfying. So up to this point, I was loving this place. This is where it went wrong. Hubs ordered the Tonkatsu ramen, and I got the Tan Tan Ramen. Presentation was great, but damn!! That shit was salllltyyyyy. We barely ate half of it and couldn't go on. I was drinking water after every spoonful to dilute the saltiness. My ramen had this weird taste to it, as well. This has to have been the saltiness ramen I've had to date.

Sushi bar is at the back of the restaurant, with a chalkboard above that shows the menu, plus the special menu behind. I can see their patio being used for sunny days. The food, however, was lacking in some ways. The spicy tuna was amazing, something my sister and I would expect. When the spicy salmon came out, we were slightly disappointed to see the spicy mayo was just squirted inside, not mixed like the spicy tuna. My daughter had the chicken katsu curry, which is a HUGE portion for $10! It was delicious, chicken was tender. Baby octopus skewers were delicious as well, lovely presentation. Tempura appetizer had that amazing crisp and was loaded with a variety of vegetables with two pieces of shrimp. The main event was the tonkotsu ramen, something we were most excited to try. However, it wasn't anything we expected. The broth was dark, not the white or lighter broth we were used to. Noodles were good, but it was leaning a bit more to the mushy side. I love the pork belly and the eggs, however. Bean sprouts were a nice touch. Service was great. Servers kept refilling our waters and making sure we were doing alright.

We came through on a Saturday at lunchtime. Lots of people out on the patio at Trinity Groves. Beautiful interior and outdoor seating. We ordered some sushi and ramen. Sadly, it was not that tasty. The broth is so important to me for tasty ramen and it was not fatty and flavorful but just kinda halfway seasoned. Also, not served hot. The noodles were okay and for sure it was edible (unlike tanoshii) but just a mediocre product.

We got a reservation for opening night and were not disappointed! Everything from the service, to the decor, all the way to the food quality and presentation was perfection. The food was INCREDIBLE! We went with a big group and just tried a bit of everything. If you are not an experienced sushi eater - definitely get the Shag Roll, you wont be disappointed! The brussel sprouts are a must and a nice thing to share. Tuna with watermelon was interesting but really refreshing and tasty. The sushi was fresh, great cuts, and the rice was cooked to perfection. If you have never tried scallop sushi before, I would definitely recommend the dayboat scallop daily special. It just melts in your mouth and is delicious (and is worth the pricey $8/piece price tag). Definitely save room for dessert. We got the fried milk (a must) and the peanut butter semifreddo (personal fave but you must like peanut butter). If you are not looking to drop a lot of money on dinner their \"Sake Social\" or HH is awesome! It is from 5-6:30 pm daily and includes many things off their menu for great prices (around $6-$8 per selection). They have a nice variety of makimono (rolls), tastings, and sometimes have a dessert. They also have $3 Kirin Drafts and Sake.If you are looking for an interesting and different sushi restaurant - this is definitely your place!

Super fresh sashimi and quality ingredients, but this wasn't the most amazing Japanese restaurant I've been to. However, I am spoiled by the places we have in the Bay Area. Ambiance wise, Uchi was great especially if you want to dine at a swanky place for a business meal and/or date night. I made reservations a week ahead of time for an early dinner (6:15pm for a party of three on a Thursday)- make sure you arrive on time since they will only hold your reservation for 15 minutes if you are running late. Reservations are a must since the restaurant is quite busy. Complimentary valet is available so you don't have to waste time looking for parking. We were sat once we arrived, and we ordered:Highly Recommended:-Hama Chili Baby Yellowtail (Ponzu, Thai Chili, Orange Supreme, $18.50, yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026): Yum- this was one of our favorite dishes. The hamachi was super fresh, and went well with the other ingredients. Highly recommended!-Social Hour Zero Sen (Yellowtail, Avocado, Shallot, Cilantro, Tobiko, Yuzu, $6, yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026): Our favorite roll out of the ones we tried, and the happy hour price is also a really good one.-Brussels Sprouts (Lemon Chili, $7, yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026): Delicious, and one of the best versions of brussels sprouts chips I've had in the while. These were super crispy and flavorful.-Karaage (Fried Marinated Chicken, Sansho Pepper, Seasonal Pickle, $10, yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026): So good, and this is a surprisingly filling dish since it's fried chicken pieces. I loved the flavor of the chicken, and how crispy the pieces were.-Shiki Tempura (Seasonal Selection, $8, yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026): Our selection consisted of turnips, eggplant, and onions, and all were really good. I loved how light but crispy the tempura was.Ok:-Gyutoro (72 Hour Short Rib, Asian Pear, Farm Greens, $26, yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026):-Hot Rock (Wagyu Beef, Ponzu, $16, yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026): The wagyu beef was good quality, and this dish was good, but they only give you a few small pieces. I'm not a huge fan of the hot rock thing so I wouldn't get this again. -Social Hour Spicy Crunchy Tuna (Bigeye Tuna, Avocado, Jalapeno, Cucumber, $6, yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026): Pretty good but nothing special. However, the happy hour price is really good. -Santa Barbara Uni/Sea Urchin ($9/1 Nigiri): Fresh and delicious, but nothing special. I wouldn't order this again here.Skip:-Bacon Otoshi Tasting (Pork Belly, Kimchi, Onion, Jalape\u00f1o, $6, yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026): The flavor wasn't bad, and I liked that this portion wasn't too big. However, the pork was overcooked and chewy, and there are better dishes to order over this.-California Roll (Krab, Avocado, Cucumber, $6): Eh, super disappointing- they didn't even mix mayo with the krab! This was really bland. -Fried Milk (Chocolate Milk, Toasted Milk, Iced Milk Sherbet, $9, yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026): I'm the outlier but I didn't like this for some reason. I didn't think the different components worked that well together, and I wouldn't get this again. Service was good and we didn't have to wonder when our server would come by to check in on us. It did take him a bit longer to stop by as it got later on in the night since the restaurant got busier and busier- it was still packed by the time we left around 8pm. Overall, there were some really good dishes and some not so great ones- they have an extensive menu so I would come back to try additional items. Parking isn't an issue since there is the complimentary valet- it took them less than 5 minutes to get our car when we left."], ["Elizabeth L.", "Went here on a rainy day. It was amazing! So many innovative ideas and bursts of flavor. The staff is what won it for me. I was hesitant of going just because of it's snazzy upscale location.

The lady that left the dish provided a detail of the ingredients which was nice since I would never be able to distinguish a dish just by its appearance. I surprisingly enjoyed every dish (except the plain-Jane spicy crunchy tuna). Each dish of HH bite was plenty for four ppl. My absolute favorite were the Brussels sprouts. I don't care much for this veggie, but the preparation of this dish was AMAZING that it trumped chips/queso, chips/salsa, fries or anything else addicting. \u00a0It's so good i could make this my meal and be happy.

It took me a while to go here despite the fact that I can basically walk there.There are some spectacular choices on the menu. I have never had a scallop I particularly enjoyed, but the dayboat scallop (name hatate I believe) on the specials menu is easily my favorite dish here. The flavors are so clean and crisp, I'm amazed at every bite.Another fan favorite is the hama chili, the tuna paired with orange provides an explosion of flavor and deserves an obvious second favorite place. Since the dayboat scallop is not alway available (it's a special after all) this is a good fall-back.I'm a big fan of brussel sprouts, if they are on the menu I will order them at ANY restaurant. So it's fair to say I've tasted quite a few wherever I've been. The brussel sprouts at Uchi are second to none, the flavor is just amazing and they are perfectly crispy. I will not go without ordering this as a side.Last but not least the fried chicken, fried chicken you say? Yes! The karaage here is absolutely fantastic. Crispy, flavorful and best of all no bones!

Everything we tried was so full of unique flavor which was very exciting and satisfying. Shag roll was bomb. Superb A5 steak on hot rock. I wish I could recall all of the names of the things we loved but the unfiltered saki has my mind a little clouded. Sero zen I think was the name of the phenomenal yellow tail roll. A yoki berry salmon sashimi type plate blew my mind.Happy hour here is incredible! $6 for 3-4 bite portions which is perfect when you want to try a little bit of everything. $3 cold saki served in a little box or hot saki served in the typical cylinder and small cup. We went here in celebration of our 3 year anniversary and it did not not disappoint a single bit. Reservations are tough to get so make them well ahead of time. What a lovely experience all around.

I would say that it was a little loud too loud for a late dinner. It felt a little \"happy hour-ish\"."], ["Sally C.", "Another review where one struggles not to just repeat all the gushing praise for an exciting new place. We sat at the bar, service was excellent. Amazing sake list, good happy hour specials (this surprised me, they certainly didn't have to discount anything to pack people in). It's a nice space with a very contemporary vibe, including clubby music which I hated but he liked (pointing out it matches the overall youthful atmosphere). Sushi was exactly as expected-- hyper fresh, simple preparations, beautifully presented & amazing. Only last thought would be kids: \u00a0they don't belong near, around, on or at THE BAR. Please, pretty expensive sushi place-- make the damned kids sit in the dining room & leave some space in this world for adults only!!"], ["Carlton B.", "Stopped by after hearing many people speaking highly about this spot and have to admit, Uchi did not disappoint.

There only looked like there was one large table for 8 outside the party room (which requires an $800 table minimum for a reservation). \u00a0It may be difficult to \u00a0seat multiple groups of 8 or above without the party room. \u00a0If you do have a large group, I'd recommend coming early. \u00a0The place was nearly completely packed within the first 15 minutes.Food (Presentation): 5I had the 6 course signature tasting plus a number of other items both hot and cold. \u00a0Presentation for each dish was spectacular and there was great attention that went into plating.Food (taste/menu choice):4The menu is fresh with an upscale, contemporary take on Japanese cuisine. Though personally there were times I wish some of the offerings were more traditional. \u00a0Overall the food was pretty solid, but felt like there were a few misses. \u00a0As previously mentioned I had the 6 course tasting but one of the dishes didn't feel like it quite belonged.1st Course: Hama chilli: 4.5 starsThe sweetness and acidity of the mandarin oranges was a nice complement to the yellowtail sashimi which was the star of the dish, the jalepeno added a touch of heat on the back end2nd Course: Zero Sen roll: 3 starsWhile tasting light and refreshing, the cilantro in this roll was a touch overpowering which almost covered up everything else. \u00a0I love cilantro but a more delicate touch here would have been greatly appreciated3rd Course: Walu Walu: 4.5 starsThe grilled escolar had fantastic mouth feel without being overwhelming fatty. \u00a0Nice touches of citrus brought a nice balance of sweetness and acid4th Course: Sea bream and salmon belly nigiri: 4 starsThere are 2 pieces of each fish that are served after the 3rd and 5th courses. \u00a0Cuts were pretty generous, good flavor5th Course: Bacon steake: 3 starsI personally felt this dish felt out of place on the tasting menu. \u00a0While there was nothing wrong with the grilled pork belly, I didn't think it was as good as some of the first dishes. \u00a0Also since it was so rich and fatty, my palate was slightly overwhelmed when the second order of nigiri came in. \u00a0I would have greatly preferred either another roll or sashimi offering here.Extras before dessertGyutoro: 4.5 starsThe 72 hr short rib was nice and pink the center and was paired with a refreshing cilantro puree which made for well balanced bites Avocado nigiri: 3.5 starsI had this one from a recommendation from a friend. \u00a0Right, wrong, or indifferent, I honestly don't remember too much about this one.Spicy tuna roll: 4 starsComparable to other high end sushi establishments. \u00a0Good ratio of tuna to rice, not overwhelmingly spicy so you could still taste the fish. \u00a0Came with Uchi's own spicy sauce blend for a touch of uniqueness.Pitchfork (waygu beef roll topped with fried leeks): 3 starsPeople may disagree with me on this one, but I felt like there was too much stuff going on with this roll. \u00a0The fried leeks were tasty but I felt like they were a distraction from the beef, which should be the star. \u00a0A bit disappointed by this oneFoie nigiri: 5 starsWhile this may be my first review, 5 stars for food are going to be pretty coveted in my mind. \u00a0This one bite took me to my happy place in a hurry. \u00a0Rich, decadent, melt in your mouth with a sweet and savory sauce. \u00a0Liver may not be for everyone, but if you get it, save it for last. It's so rich, eating it up front may overwhelm your palette when tasting the more delicate items6th Course (Dessert): Fried milk: 5 starsAll the flavors and textures work really well here. \u00a0Hot, cold, crispy, creamy, chocolately, milky. \u00a0Its worth coming here for the desert itselfFood (value): 3This is probably the sticking point for me. \u00a0While everything (minus a few things) were pretty solid, and the experience was unique, I did feel that Uchi was a bit overpriced for what I got. \u00a0While I certainly expected to pay a premium, some of the pricing for the items seemed to be a bit much. \u00a0Other prominent sushi restaurants have similar quality (though arguably less innovative and unique) offerings for a more competitive price. \u00a0However if money is no option and you prefer a more contemporary spin on Japanese cuisine, this is the place for you."], ["Thu N.", "Tasting menu:Zero senmadal (sea bream)sake toroBacon steakienabefried milkOrdered separately:m\u00e2ch\u00e9 cureI'm upset at myself for not getting all the names and pictures of the food, and yet even if I did, I'd fail miserably at describing the food. \u00a0All of their dishes had 4-5 components that just surprises you with every bite and chew that you do. \u00a0I prefer the cold dishes over the savory because it was so delicate, thoughtful, balanced and mouth watering at the same time. \u00a0My favorite was the zero sen and m\u00e2ch\u00e9 cure. \u00a0The fried milk was out of the world.

No, I'm just not a fan of mayo or eel sauce on everything. \u00a0I opted for the simpler rolls and sushi to really test the quality of the food.. hard to mask ingredients when they're in their natural state. \u00a0I had the yellowtail roll (simple yellowtail, and green onions), tempura shrimp roll (as special as it got for me- crab, tempura shrimp, avocado, cucumber, and a splash of eel sauce), tobiko topped with a quail egg, salmon, and a spicy tuna roll. I loved the fact that they don't overdo the simple stuff! The spicy tuna roll was PERFECT.. not masked with tons of spicy mayo, but instead no mayo at all, and a lot of clean spicy to it! For ordering the tempura shrimp roll, I was a bit hesitate as I normally don't love all that sauce on anything, but there was barely any there! it was just the right amount of balance to not soak the roll, and keep it clean and fresh. \u00a0The best part is, for all this, it was under $40! It's true! Great quality fish flown in from mainly Hawaii and Japan, with chefs keeping it original and not covering it up with \"fusoion\" ideas! I know I will be back for a fact!"], ["Lily M.", "Once again, my bf and I wanted some sushi takeout, and we decided to try out Little Katana. \u00a0Our first and only time going were a few months ago, and the reason we haven't gone back is because of the hair that I saw on top of one of the rolls.The rolls that we did order were wonderful. \u00a0But, we couldn't eat one of the rolls due to the hair, and I know it doesn't sound like it's that big of a deal to some, but it's gross to me.For the reason of me having to speculate Little Katana's sanitation, I just can't get myself to go back there."], ["Jimmy N.", "This is a unique gem to find in Dallas. \u00a0Beautiful restaurant and decor, very friendly staff. \u00a0I was very skeptic walking in, but the sushi and sashimi is legit here. \u00a0I recommend Spanish Aji (sashimi / ask the chef to deep fry the fish skeleton for after diner chips snack), yellow tail (very fresh), salmon (melts in my mouth), and papa rolls (very interesting).I'll never steer you wrong, this is a very good sushi place.Cheers."], ["Sara H.", "I came with two friends for lunch on a Monday. As soon as I ordered the bento box, an employee told me that I couldn't order it because the restaurant wasn't busy and she didn't feel like making the items..... My friends and I were really confused and I ended up ordering the Korean seafood hot stone rice bowl instead ($16).I waited for about 45 minutes for the rice bowl and ended up taking it to-go (since my other friends were done eating their entrees already). The Korean seafood hot stone bowl was some white rice with some stir fried shrimp, a couple pieces of squid, a few baby scallops, peppers, onion, and zucchini. There was no \"spicy sauce\" like it said on the menu. When I asked for some, I was offered some Sriracha (what?!?).Not a great experience overall. And it didn't help that one of the guys making sushi started coughing and then touched the sushi mats without washing his hands first."], ["Tammy D.", "The sushi IS good, however the customer service is AWFUL. Pam was our server and we waited 10 minutes with not a single person asking us if we wanted to start with any appetizers or if we were ready UNTIL we had to ask ourselves.

Little Katana is one of the better sushi restaurants in Dallas, in my opinion. Unlike some of the other restaurants in the area, LK is pretty casual from the most part. If you go during the non busy hours it is quiet, with a nice patio as well. It is small so they get very busy during peak hours, so plan accordingly. I have tried the miso soup (excellent) beef pot stickers (excellent), spicy tuna, sunny, and charming rolls. They are all really good! I will definitely be back."], ["David W.", "The owner of this restaurant has the genuineness and passion that all restaurant owners should have. \u00a0They truly care about the quality of their food as well as the presentation.The sushi is some of the freshest I've ever tasted and for that, be prepared to pay a little more for it. Not a sushi fan? No problem. They have other hot dishes for the non-conformist. :)"], ["Emily S.", "I got this recommendation from a friend and was honestly not impressed. If you go here - do not get the nigiri! It was very fishy and tough and the rice was cold and hard. \u00a0I usually like to keep it simple when it comes to sushi and typically don't go for cooked rolls with lots of sauce. If I were to come back, I would only get rolls. The only thing that kept me from giving this place 1 star was the roll we had, which was decent. Prices are high for the quality and there are a lot of better choices when it comes to sushi in Dallas. The service was okay but the waitress was nice. She was not very knowledgeable about the menu and could not give good recommendations. The atmosphere is great and has a fun ambiance."], ["European Wax Center C.", "I will tell you, the reason I will be giving this place 2 stars and not 4 or 5 is because the manager of the restaurant came up to my 3-party table at the end of our 1.5 hour meal to ask us to please leave so they could fill other tables. That is the most rude thing I can imagine of a restaurant. I just dropped over $100, and you want me to leave after only being there to less than 2 hours? I ordered a bottle of wine and everything, and that to me, is someOf the worst and unappreciable customer service I have experienced. I will NOT be returning."], ["Nick M.", "We ate dinner here on a Friday night and our experience was excellent. The fish was the freshest we have tasted in Dallas.

We originally planned to order standard rolls and sushi but at the last minute asked for recommendations based on their top sellers. Our waitress looked at our order form and based on our original selections she was able to quickly recommend the Mama Roll. \u00a0Her familiarity with the menu and confidence made it easy for us to switch up our selections in favor of her recommendations.

If you want sushi covered in mayo sauces or Asian syrups, stuffed with fried food and Philadelphia cream cheese, then have at little katana. Nothing wrong with liking that kind of sushi but I hate it personally it if I'm paying high prices. So I couldn't enjoy our roll. I can't even remember the name because it was one of those rolls with 80 ingredients like a sandwich. \u00a0I also had the dumpling soup. Good miso broth but it was no better or worse than a packaged kind. The dumplings floating around were good but there were only three. The beef inside was nicely seasoned, slightly sweet, but really they weren't any sort of fantastic. Just good. Good vibe. Really impressive cuts of fish when you walk in. But sushi is weak and only a notch above what your neighbor Tom can make after watching sushi YouTube videos, and if he has plenty of mayo."], ["Kendall N.", "I am a frequent customer of little katana and after my last experience I think it will be awhile before I return. I was out to dinner with my sisters and we ordered a bottle of wine on Wednesday which is half priced \"so the sign says.\" Once we got our check the bottle we ordered was not half priced. On the sign it said \"Mondays half priced sushi on select rolls and Wednesday half priced bottle of wine\" (not select) and when we asked our waitress she said it was on a special menu. However, we did not get the half priced wine list menu. After we asked our waitress to speak to the manager they still refused to give us even the slightest discount. Not to mention, the manager didn't even come to apologize or acknowledge the mistake. I am extremely disappointed and will be looking for a new sushi restaurant in the future. If it was possible to add the picture I took tonight of the sign I would so that others would not be mislead."], ["Nga N.", "With how packed it was on Sat night, we were surprised to be seated immediately. This place is very small, and it didn't have the cozy feeling for me like most small restaurants. I can pretty much hear the table next to me loud and clear, even if they were whispering. The food though, was hit and miss depending on what you get. The sashimi was very disappointing. I got the chirashi bowl, which is one of my favorite Japanese meals. The chirashi bowl is a good way to test out the restaurant raw fish. This way I can taste an array of assorted raw fish like salmon, tuna, mackerel, yellowtail, snapper, cooked shrimps, and imitation crab on top of white rice. FYI, the chirasha bowl was not on the menu, but they were able to accommodate us. Most fishes except the salmon and yellowtail were chewy, stringy, and tasteless. The mackerel was the worst, because it was fishy. The salmon and yellowtail were better, but still average in general. Good thing the hot stone bowl, aka bibimbap was awesome. The bibimbap was very moist from tons of butter they added. The fresh veggies and beef also contributed to the great taste of the dish. The star of the night has to be the ahi tower. It had 3 different caviar, and the avocado really stands out because of how fresh it was. It sure was one of the better ahi tower I had in Dallas. Highly recommend the bibimbap and ahi tower. But for $17 a bibimbap, I'm not sure if I'd go back for that since I never crave bibimbap. Actually, for the price of their food, I'd be much happier at Sushi Sake. I heard they have good rolls, and it's half off on Monday. I might check that out."], ["Jody G.", "My husband and I have been searching for a new go-to sushi place to replace Sushi on McKinney (long story), and we finally found it!

I loved the exposed brick, generous sushi bar, and intimate yet casual setting. Now for the sushi! We got mostly sashimi and nigiri and everything was incredible fresh and beautifully presented. The sizzling dumplings were also delicious. Highly recommended!"], ["Robert W.", "My girlfriend and I have eaten here a number of times and we were disappointed in their lack of customer service in their management policies. We ordered a role that was too salty and wanted to replace it and by policy we had to pay for both roles.

We decided on the Shrimp Tempura Roll (pretty good, but paled in comparison to our other choices. Good for those who like rolls with few ingredients), the Katana Roll (crawfish, avocado and cream cheese topped with spicy crab and spicy sauce- AMAZING. My favorite of the night), and the Katana 101 (salmon, jalapenos, avocado, cream cheese, topped with spicy crab and spicy tuna with chili sauce. Incredible as well).

I was able to make sure nothing I couldn't handle would be brought out. Like most high end sushi bars, they carry a gluten free soy sauce and got it to me on the spot. Bravo Uptown. Bravo.We ordered a Charming Roll and Katana Roll. This was the best Sushi I have had downtown. Wow this was good. But I paid for it. I've come to expect what comes with a 2 $$ on a Yelp Review.

Their rent must be pretty high!I'm usually able to get out of there without too much damage done.

Would definitely go again."], ["Mike A.", "We ate here on a Friday night, which I expected would be packed. \u00a0There were only a few other diners in the restaurant and the sashimi and rolls were simply amazing. \u00a0We would go back there at anytime. \u00a0The owners are very friendly and accommodating and the restaurant is very clean. \u00a0We really enjoyed our meal and had over $100 in sashimi alone."], ["Michelle I.", "alllright.....I haven't been back to this place in a while so i figured I should update. \u00a0i don't know exactly what happened, but the last few times I went, it was meh. \u00a0haven't really cared to go back. \u00a0the husband and wife that are always working (i guess they are the owners) are SO very nice that honestly, they were the only reason that I would think to continue to go there. \u00a0 however, if you are stuck downtown and are looking for sushi for dinner, I think you would still be happy with it."], ["Mark S.", "In town for work and was craving sushi. \u00a0Nice and clean restaurant with attentive and kind staff. \u00a0I had a rainbow roll, spider roll, and yellowtail roll. \u00a0Everything tasted good to me and my craving was satisfied. \u00a0Job well done in my book."], ["Sara R.", "Most authentic sushi in Dallas! Also, the sushi chef was the person who invented the Tuna Tower! Loved the yellowtail belly sashimi, rainbow roll, dragonfly roll and of course the California roll (classic)! The place was very clean and a good atmosphere!"], ["Angela N.", "a decent hole in the wall place in downtown dallas to grab a quick bite to eat. Its actually really good and fresh considering its in the middle of downtown Dallas, you have to try the Scallop sushi its sooo good, my favorite"], ["Joe K.", "Sushiya has become one of our favorite little establishments. \u00a0(So much so that if we walk in, they know what we're going to order.) \u00a0My fiancee and I live very close to Sushiya, so it is very convenient for us. \u00a0For dinner, very rarely is anyone in there. \u00a0They do primarily a lunch business for the businesses in the downtown area. \u00a0However--at dinner, we have seen some local celebrities eating here (mostly people from the local news. \u00a0My fiancee recognizes them, though I don't watch that much TV.)However, I wanted to write an update review for a reason--I brought my finacee here for her birthday, and were speaking with them and I mentioned that it was her birthday. \u00a0Turns out, they have a dessert for that... \u00a0They presented her with a tempura fried ice cream. \u00a0It was EXCELLENT. \u00a0It was so good that since we received that, we have a hard time coming back here and not getting the dessert. \u00a0I highly recommend you check that out."], ["Chris Z.", "From outside, this place looks a little skeptical. \u00a0But head inside into a space much larger than expected. \u00a0There is a long bar, a sushi counter and a few booths. \u00a0It's set up very nicely. \u00a0Service was awesome, and the rolls were great. \u00a0I did not encounter the hard rice that others complain about... but maybe that's because I was there early at lunch, when the rice was just done cooking. \u00a0Rolls are 7-15 bucks each."], ["Steven N.", "I was really craving for sushi and I didn't have a car, so that was the only reason I stopped by this place as it was near my hotel. If I would know in advance the quality of their sushi, I probably would have ventured further out via taxi (or order delivery) from somewhere else. I ordered carry-out from this place. The sushi isn't horrible, but it's just not good...actually, it's a tad bit below so-so. I ordered the Dragon Roll (shrimp tempura with tuna), 2 pieces of super white tuna, and 2 pieces of salmon. The fish didn't seem fresh, but it wasn't too horrible. It just tasted blah. But the rice...the rice is where this place fails. The rice didn't stick together, and it tasted like over-night rice (i.e. hard). I do give them props for their wasabi (and they gave me extra at no charge). That stuff has a real kick to it...just the way I like it. The damage came out to about $25...for this price, I certainly had better...much better. I would suggest you skip this place if you have a high standard for sushi. I know I do. =)"], ["Chris S.", "First time here, had the Katsu don at lunch, with a friend. \u00a0Second time, Tempura Udon for dinner. \u00a0Both were fantastic. \u00a0Service has been super friendly both times."], ["Oreoficionad O.", "Was looking for good, quick sushi near my hotel and found it in Sushiya. I eat a lot of sushi. I eat sushi often. I love sushi. And as a visitor to Dallas, I'd say Sushiya was just fine. The fish was fresh and the portions generous--I stuck to the basics (salmon and tuna sashimi, some nigiri....). If I lived in Dallas, I'd probably try to find better, but I'd be happy to sit down at Sushiya again."], ["Robert G.", "Surprising find in downtown. Not busy on a Monday night but super attentive staff. Sashimi platter was great -- both for value and taste. Green tea is genmaicha, one of my favs and an extra treat."], ["Travis D.", "Great little find. Fish was so fresh it melted in our mouths. Service was outstanding and prices we very affordable! Was able to substitute one of their special rolls in the deluxe bento box, so was the perfect size to share. Will go for lunch next time since right down the road from my office. Oh, parking garage exits right next to the restaurant, so very convenient."], ["Dee S.", "Saw a 10% off coupon on their website and decided to try them out. I ordered the Sunrise roll and it was a good size for the price, but it wasn't anything special. The place was completely dead on a Friday night, I'd recommend it if you were in the area, but nothing to drive a ways for."], ["Chris K.", "This place is amazing. For the price in downtown Dallas, it can't be beat. Great staff and I mean great. Great chef and everything. Big fan of this place. Come at dinner. It is very peaceful. Would highly recommend if looking for sushi in downtown Dallas."], ["Susan T.", "Fast service and good sushi for downtown. Recommended temura udon and all the brnto boxes."], ["Eric M.", "At first the idea of a sushi bar buffet seemed a little scary to me, but once I visited this place I realized they had it figured out. It was quick, easy, fresh, delicious, and affordable."]]}
