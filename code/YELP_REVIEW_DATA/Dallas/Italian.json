Not too over sauced, perfect garnished, and just the right amount of lemon flavor on the Chicken Picata. \u00a0The portions were almost family style. \u00a0They came with a small salad each and the house dressing was perfectly flavored with Italian spice and oil blend. \u00a0I have to say this is one of the first times I couldn't wait to eat my leftovers the next day. \u00a0Usually the to go boxes go to the fridge to die but not this time oh no!!! \u00a0This would be a great date night place. \u00a0Glass of wine, plate of pasta and some warm conversation.

Fresh sauce piping hot Bread soft like eating cloud Makes me want to swear"], ["Lou Y.", "Great neighborhood eatery but let's not get carried away with the quality as some other reviewers are gushing about. A little heavy on the sauces and the Caesar salad was drenched in dressing. Nice wine list but they tend to run out of many bottles. Definitely worth a visit"], ["Paul T.", "My wife and I stopped here for dinner. \u00a0The food, the service and the ambiance were amazing. \u00a0I had the Italian Meatloaf. \u00a0It is by far the best comfort food dish I have ever had! \u00a0My wife had the spaghetti, and it was excellent as well.

Soooo good :)"], ["Dave G.", "I have lived in Lakewood for a long time now, and Scalini's has been one of those weeknight standbys, though more in the past than recently. There is a \"Cheers\" like atmosphere, a very neighborhood joint. You'll find American-Italian fare here. Spaghetti with red sauce and meatballs. A delicious thin crust pizza. The portions are ample. The food is consistently good. Scalini's is very unpretentious, not a foodie spot, but a reliable place. One gripe: the prices have gone up since I was there last, and the new rates stretch the value to the edge. Quite good."], ["Kaia V.", "I am officially a fan of Scalini's. \u00a0Their delivery is relatively quick on a weekend evening. The folks who answer the phone are polite friendly and easy to understand. The lasagne is fantastic. The white cream sauce on the chicken lasagne might have clogged my arteries more than a little, but it was delicious and didn't get too greasy before it arrived (though it wasn't entirely greaseless either). The garlic bread and salad that come with the pasta dishes ($12) were small, but the lettuce was at least fresh and the italian viniagrette in the correct (not too much) quantity for the size of the salad. Portions are standard italian pasta delivery sizes."], ["Connie H.", "Scallini's has the best cannelloni, veal and chicken parmesan dishes in Dallas County. \u00a0Highly recommend their restaurant!! \u00a0We eat here often."], ["Karen B.", "Tonight was my first time trying Scalini's and I was very impressed! I looked over the menu online for a few minutes and quickly decided to order a pizza and a salad, just to test the waters of the place. I ordered a half pepperoni and pineapple, half shrimp, with the entire pizza topped with feta cheese, a coke, as well as a Greek salad- all for $28.34. Not a bad price considering my \"deluxe\" toppings. I was told delivery time was going to be 30-45 minutes, but it arrived here much quicker than that! The delivery person and the person I spoke to on the phone were very polite as well. To top the entire experience off the pizza was fantastic! It looked and tasted delicious. Salad was fresh and crisp. Only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish the pizza was a little bit more crispy. That's my only complaint."], ["Francesca L.", "My brother wanted lasagne for his birthday and after a long day at work, my mom wasn't up to making one and took a suggestion from her coworker to order one from Scalini's. It was about $45 for a whole lasagne and it was nice and hot when we arrived.When we got home and cut into the lasagne it did not hold together well. The pasta was pretty mushy and it just ruined the whole dish for me. The beef was flavorless and the sauce tasted canned. Overall a disappointing lasagne, I wouldn't recommend it."], ["Jason M.", "A little run down but an okay place. Good food though."], ["Mitchy M.", "I'm not sure why I've never wrote a review before now. \u00a0Scalini's is one of my dip spots in Lakewood. \u00a0Yes I said dip. \u00a0I can dip in for a bite to eat with a date and not be bothered by a huge crowd of people. \u00a0Scalini's is quite the cozy place. \u00a0It's not the kind of place that you feel rushed to order, eat and give up your table because someone is waiting. \u00a0And there are 2 sidewalk tables if you want eat outside.I've only eaten one thing here. \u00a0It's the shrimp scampi, with creamy white sauce and a side salad. \u00a0I'm not going to say it's the best Italian dish, but it's tasty. \u00a0Even my dates love this place. I don't have to write much about this place for you to know that you must eat here if you're in Lakewood. \u00a0The cost is very affordable. \u00a0Lunch for 2 will set you back around $20 with drinks included. \u00a0Take my advice.. stop by for lunch. \u00a0You won't regret it."], ["Aimee F.", "We eat out almost every dinner, and in my entire lifetime, this was the worst dining experience I can recall. \u00a0Just shy of two hours to get dinner was bad. But then it was delivered without apologies. \u00a0And was sub-par (very tough, dry chicken). \u00a0Just a \"we have lots of to go orders\" (tip: ordering from home is way faster?). \u00a0Then, shockingly, we get the bill (again no apology) and not even a free dessert? \u00a0Wow. \u00a0Asked to talk to the manager, that was a waste too. \u00a0It is clear whomever runs it is not the owner and doesn't care.

Great for couples or families."], ["Lauren N.", "Unless you are ordering delivery, be prepared to wait. \u00a0No waitress, no food after 1 hour of waiting. \u00a0We went on a Saturday night after calling to make sure there wasn't a wait since we had my 2 month old with us. \u00a0We arrived and were seated in the front, by the bar. \u00a0We watched carry out customers come and go. \u00a0None of the customers around us were eating, should have been out warning. \u00a0We saw the waitress twice. \u00a0Once to take our drink, app, and dinner order and the second time was to deliver the drinks, app and salad. \u00a0Never saw her again. \u00a0My dad, who rarely complains at an establishment, talked to the owner after an hour of waiting. \u00a0We were promised food within 5 minutes and told that they were short staffed in back, which I find hard to believe since they were churning out delivery orders. \u00a0Needless to say after 5 minutes we walked out. \u00a0The owner never acknowledging our leaving or saying anything along the lines of an apology. \u00a0We will never be eating there again, which is unfortunate since their food legit!"], ["Jane D.", "Spoiler: This is a scathing report on Scalini's, one of our former VERY favorite restaurants for \u00a0the past 17 years, to whom we have given countless \"one more chances\" in recent years. \u00a0 \u00a0We loved and went here regularly since 1998 (maybe 3 times a month), and we WANT to love and support this place. \u00a0Have had horrible experiences in service over the past several years and keep on forgiving them after a few months and returning to try again. We are a family that LOVES to frequent and support all of our local restaurants and other businesses. That said......Tonight we (family of 4) were thrilled and charmed to see the brand-new storefront where they have opened up huge, breezy windows with bar seats \u00a0and candles. So quaint! We went to one of our \"usual\" tables (remember it's been 17 years) with a renewed optimism. \u00a0 Restaurant was busy but not full to capacity. \u00a0OK....Took over an hour to get our main course after we ordered it. The tables on both sides of us arrived, ate, left, and probably went to sleep while we were still waiting. \u00a0We did not order anything unusual. In fact, our family of 4 was so enjoying just visiting that we didn't realize until a while had gone by, that our main course had not come and they had not cleared our table of the salads and appetizers. \u00a0And our table was right there near the counter, not hidden in a corner. I finally asked (politely) several times, and was told there was only one chef there tonight (no excuse, because the other tables got their meals). \u00a0Apologies and food promised \"within 5 minutes.\" \u00a0 We finally said to our waitress, we will leave if our food does not arrive within 5 minutes. \u00a0It came about 2 minutes later, and one of the orders was wrong although we had made the order very clear. \u00a0This was over an hour after we ordered. \u00a0Our Waitress never came back to ask how it was. \u00a0No one ever came to clear plates or offer dessert or offer a check. \u00a0I finally went to the bar and asked for the manager. \u00a0 Jose, the manager tonight, listened as I explained exactly how our evening had gone, and then said that he would comp our whole meal. \u00a0I thanked him and sat down with my family, waiting for the waitress to come back and confirm this and perhaps say something. No one ever came. Our \u00a0waitress never returned to our table although I saw her. \u00a0We finally got up to walk out. \u00a0I waited at the bar, and when the manager Jose walked from the kitchen to the bar, I made eye contact and he walked over to me. I asked him if we were just supposed to walk out with nothing else said to us, and he mumbled something about \"I guess so.\" \u00a0He would not even make eye contact with my husband and kids and mumbled something that my husband could not understand. \u00a0We walked on out and came home. \u00a0 \u00a0We are a nice and respectful family and did nothing snobby or rude to elicit this sort of service. \u00a0Shocked and baffled by our former favorite neighborhood Italian restaurant."], ["Alan L.", "Tried first time for dinner. Atmosphere was pleasant, but service was slow. Our server was very nice, but inexperienced and a little overwhelmed. Minestrone soup was ok. The small, thin-crust pizza seems larger than listed, and is a good value (we ordered sausage). Thin crust is tasty and works well as appetizer or meal. \u00a0Combo plate (lead menu item) is large (enough for 2), but ours was served lukewarm and slightly under-cooked, so we brought most of it home. \u00a0Wine prices are reasonable, Lasagna, spaghetti, ravioli seemed a little flat taste-wise, but that could tie to the food temp. Overall, we were slightly disappointed in comparison to other Dallas Italian eateries in the $$ range, (especially in light of recent Yelp reviews!) so maybe it was just our turn to have an off night. In any case, we will not likely return - except perhaps to enjoy an appetizer and glass of wine in a pleasant Italian bistro setting."]], "Mimi's Pizzeria": [["Ashley Y.", "The staff was super friendly and you can order by the slice, which is super convenient if you can't finish their ginormous sized pizzas! The pizza was thin and not as crispy as I would've liked.You can definitely tell they used fresh ingredients, but I still felt there was flavor lacking for some reason.

I think the pizza's are okay, I'll even go as far as to say good, but they're just not amazing finger licking good. This is definitely a family with lots of kids kind of place, not exactly date material. Also, I was a little disappointed with the sweet tea, perhaps I got a bad batch but it almost tasted like it had been sitting out all day which was a shame because I love my sweet tea.

Service is excellent however, y'all were great!"], ["Eugene L.", "My wife and I visited Mimi's during a weekday, late in the afternoon about 3:00. \u00a0We ordered a medium \"Works\" pizza as the pizza out for sale by the slice looked left over from lunch.The pizza we received was much worse than expected and nothing like the reviews we had read. \u00a0The meats were low quality and tasteless. \u00a0The vegies were not pre cooked so all the water from them was on the pizza making it soggy and ruining the crust. \u00a0 A puddle quickly formed on the pizza pan.The crust not soaked in water was very good. \u00a0Maybe a pizza without vegies would be better."], ["Bryan T.", "Are you a Northeastern transplant to Dallas? More to the point, are you a TriState Area transplant? If you are, then you'd fully appreciate the quick service, the traditional pizzaria-style dine-in section, the thick New York accents and polite-yet-refreshingly-no-B.S. service, and the best thin crust slice of pepperoni in the metroplex.

The staff is friendly every time I go in. They didn't even judge the hubs for asking if he could fold some pizza boxes. I, on the other hand, judged hard. Pizza is fresh with great ingredients. Calzones are on point. Even the veal piccata is delish. It is also BYOB which is always a plus for a quick data night. Don't get me wrong, this place is crazy casual inside. Order at the counter.

This place, my friends, is the closest I've found to New York Style pizza in Dallas. \u00a0Yes, it's extremely thin. Yes, the cheese is ooey-stringy-gooey. No, it's not crispy thin crust... it's NY style thin crust. And it is delicious! Parking in the lot = spacious & easy! Check!Atmosphere = casual, nothing fancy. Simple and clean with 2 TVs.

(Much more than I can say about Serious Pizza, where the wait was 1.5 hours on a Sunday night) We ordered a Mimi's Salad $6.50 that was enough for all 5 of us to share a small plate. It's not a typical salad that consists of 99% iceberg lettuce. Instead it was FULL of ham, salami, and provolone. Also ordered a Spinach Cheese Roll to try - TIP: it's NOT ON THE MENU but it is SUPER DUPER GOOD! Would be a great appetizer choice while waiting for your pizza. Extra cheesy & rich. MM-MMMMM! Thinking about it makes me want another one. ONTO THE PIZZA:Love the simple pricing system.. everything made fresh to order. Probably only waited about 15-20 minutes for our pizza. Ordered the XL The Works Pie -- $17.95 they were generous with the toppings - pepperoni, sausage, hamburger, green peppers, olives, onionsAlso got an XL half Margarita & half \u00a0Mimi's \u00a0$17.95 (they were very accommodating & no upcharge for doing 1/2 and 1/2...which was AWESOME because I wanted to try both!) Margarita-- had the basil & mozzarella & fresh tomatoes. Very good!but the ULTIMATE BEST THING WE HAD was the Mimi's Pizza!!! Next time, I'm gonna get a whole Mimi's for myself!

I've almost always seen Bubba or Charlie in there working hard and they're the nicest guys you've run in to. The price of a full pie is quite cheap, especially considering the size of the pizza you get for the cost. The pizza itself is amazing. Not overly greasy and cooked to perfection. I've had the baked ziti a few times, that was always good, and of course you can never go wrong with the garlic bread. They have an all meat stromboli that's pretty darn good too if you're looking for a change of pace. In the past year I've tried a lot of the menu items, and have yet to have something that didn't make me happy. Long story short, if you're hungry for good quality pizza that's not going to break the bank, this is the spot to check out. If you're at zinis across the street, you're wrong. We're moving out of the area in a few weeks, but will definitely be back down at Italia Express when we have a dire need for some pizza."], ["Michael S.", "This place is awesome! The speed of the service is comparable to sbarro in the malls, but the quality is far from average.

Friendly, helpful staff who do their best to get you your meal warm and ready, as quickly as possible.

Oh my..such delicate and tasty prosciuttoPasta we picked the rye budaletti and the parsley root with red wattle pork ragu.The good news it was freaking amazing.The bad news is the menu changes so often you may not get to try it!!But wait....not to end on bad news..the good news is I've never had a bad pasta there so order anything and I'm sure you'll love it.Our table mates did go for a non pasta entree and chose the steelhead (fish) This was cooked to perfection but a crispy top skin sear.

The high points are the boho chic decor, exotic ingredients transported from Italy for authenticity, and quality of their wine selection. The dining room, the staff, and even the dinnerware were enchantingly similar to meals on the Cinque Terre.

When you receive indifferent service and above average food, is it any better? I would describe my recent visit as the latter and honestly still a bit confused if I would ever return or even recommend. I was lucky enough to get seated after a last minute decision to dine. The hostess was very outgoing and welcoming. However once service started I was less than excited. We were immediately offered a drink menu and ordered a great bottle of red. The waitress didn't ask if we had been there before or of any off the menu items - maybe that's not the in thing to do anymore? She then returned and asked \"what do you want to order\", again not really selling me on what makes them any different than a fast casual place. After ordering, she gave us a puzzled look as only I ordered a primi, secondari and main course, the person with me ordered only 2 courses. Before I get into the food review, I will state that the wine was great, the bread is amazing, the decor and vibe of the place also above par. The foie gras prunes were quite tasty and a nice starting point. The smoked salmon was ok at best and didn't really match the rest of the menu. It had rubbard slices which really added nothing to the dish, actually it was a distraction and had no flavor. The pork ragu, sweet corn pasta and Berkshire pork chop were amazing, along with a spectacular peach semifrddo. Overall very happy with the food, minus the salmon plate. As for the service...maybe she was having an off night, maybe she was new, maybe she was tired. Either way I cannot believe that a place as busy as they are would allow such indifferent and uneven service. Not once did she check and see if we were enjoying our meal. When dishes were brought to the table, they were dropped on the table and the server walked away. What ever happened to the art of describing what was on the plate, and before anyone ask, the place was not full and has more than enough time to describe their great dishes. She never once smiled and didn't really act like the caliber you would expect from what appears to be a very successful place. Maybe she didn't like my blue shirt or hates people that wear khakis? I'm not sure but overall I was completely underwhelmed and it actually left a bad taste in my mouth. My dining partner even made a comment about the poor service and they never complain about service. Overall would I go back?

For our secondi/main entrees, we tried the Tagliatelle with veal ragu (meaty bits complimented the thick noodle but had a slightly overwhelming smokey taste), Texas waygu coulotte (the local version of Kobe beef, which was pretty good but I've had better), and Semolina gnocchi with smoked duck (WOWZERS never had duck prepared this way before... the flavor of duck with the juiciness of ham and the texture of amazing steak. Impressive). For finishing up our meal, we shared desert items Citrus semifreddo (zest was too bitter and the gelato left a lingering aftertaste) and the Ricotta can noli (which is pretty good if you like banana).

First off, the service was exceptional. We had the small salumi misti and some foie gras stuffed prunes to start. The foie gras was perfect, and had a wonderful nutty flavor that worked very well with the prune. The texture of the foie was lighter than I'm accustomed to, but I thought it worked well. The salumi misti was good. They make a lot of their pork products in house for their service, and I appreciate that--you could definitely tell it was prepared with love. However, a tad more variety in terms of flavor profiles would have sent this over the top for me. We ordered the farro with chicken offal, and the beef cheeks with gnocchi as primi. The chicken hearts were delicious--perfectly prepared. But the farro was so salty I couldn't eat it. However, when our server asked how it was and I reported my complaint, it was replaced and it was perfect (and it was removed from our bill). We shared the rabbit with cauliflower puree, which was wonderfully rich but not overpowering. I've eaten a lot of rabbit, and this was perfectly cooked. I assumed it was prepared sous-vide but the chef informed me that it was seared and basted on the burner (which I still find hard to believe, given the remarkable consistent texture). Dessert was delightful--we shared the olive oil cake with figs, whipped cream and toasted pistachios. It had a wonderful combination of earthy and citrus flavors that I would hope for in a traditional Italian olive oil cake. Overall, the service was the shining part of this meal--they were exceptionally attentive, one of the owners came to speak with us and brought us wine, and when we had a complaint it was immediately taken care of. The food was generally quite good with a few exceptions. I will definitely go back to try their new menus."], ["Martha R.", "Here's the dealio on Lucia. It falls somewhere in between good and great.

Difficult to articulate, but trust me when I say all fine dining restaurants should take a cue.So, yeah. Go.

It's a very cozy restaurant with all of the tables right next to each other so you can hear the conversation next to you. This could potentially be awkward but our neighbors were fine. The service was really good and they are really good at explaining their dishes, which is to be expected.The first and second courses are best shared in my opinion. We had the salumi misti for our first course which is their house special. It came on a platter with all sorts of different cured meats which were delicious for the most part with the exception of the chicken liver which was rather unappetizing. For our second course, we shared the gnocchi with wild boar meat which was very flavorful. The boar meat was gamey but fell apart easily which was very nice.For my entree, I had the duck breast which I ordered medium-rare but unfortunately it came unevenly cooked with about 1/3 of the slices of duck being rare and nearly inedible. That was a shame because the rest of the dish was fantastic with the chanterelles being especially tasty. My date had the Wagyu coulotte which was perfectly cooked at medium rare. The mushrooms and sunchokes were really flavorful as well. The rest of the salad that came with it didn't seem like it fit the dish well and we left a good portion of it on the plate.Overall, it was a good but not great dining experience mainly because some of my duck breast was very undercooked.

\u00a0My only complaint was the pairing...it came with green beans, which I found odd. \u00a0The bread is fantastic though! \u00a0For pasta, you can order in two different sizes...go for the smaller size and order a few different ones! \u00a0They're wonderful! \u00a0We tried the gnocchi with morels and the taglierini cacio e pepe (cheese and pepper). \u00a0The sauces were very similar, and so rich and yummy! \u00a0Next time I'm skipping the burrata appetizer and trying the Bucatini all' Amatriciana with Stracciatella (tomato based sauce with burrata). \u00a0The table next to us ordered this and it looked fantastic! \u00a0For our main course, we split the veal chop, which was sous vide to perfection! \u00a0Keep in mind, the menu changes, and these were our options for the night. \u00a0I'm sure it's all good and I'd be willing to test that theory with future visits!My only real complaint, and it's small (hence the five stars), was the wine list. \u00a0Most of the reds are Italian reds. \u00a0Makes sense right? \u00a0Well, as a couple who loves red, but hasn't found their niche in the Italian red market, a few other options like a solid pinot or cab would have been nice. \u00a0We tried the pinot they did have and it fell flat, especially against such amazing food.Go to Lucia. \u00a0Call now, go. \u00a0Whether it's a Tuesday or a Saturday...it'll be worth it!"], ["Dirk W.", "After hearing about this place for several years and generally resisting the 30+ mile drive to Bishop Arts, we gave in...and \u00a0wow was I surprised. \u00a0This place is awesome. \u00a0 Our waiter, Michael, was attentive and friendly and helped us pick a great bottle of wine and walked us through the menu. \u00a0We started with cured meat tray, enjoyed a perfect green tomato salad and finished off with a lamb chop entree. \u00a0 \u00a0Highly recommended."], ["Shondip C.", "This was my 3rd, and likely last, time to Lucia. \u00a0I don't say last because something went terribly wrong, but rather because we're moving out of Dallas in the next month. \u00a0My wife called near the end of May and got us added to the wait list. \u00a0For those who haven't experienced it, Lucia only takes reservations starting at 9am on the first day of the month, for the following month, and generally fills their entire months availability by 9:30am. \u00a0In fact, you have to either have connections (I imagine) or be incredibly lucky to get a weekend reservation. \u00a0If you don't get a busy signal, or keep calling back until you get through, you get to leave a voice message with your preferred dates, and times, and the number in your party. \u00a0They call you back to confirm your reservation, if you got it. \u00a0Given this ritual for the privilege to dine at arguably Dallas' finest restaurant (I would argue for it), we were happily surprised that after calling and getting put on the wait list for the following Tuesday, we were offered 1 of 2 cancellation slots. \u00a0So we happily took 2 of our close friends and made the trek to Bishop Arts for a 9pm dinner on a Tuesday at the sacred Italian establishment. \u00a0Here's a my little editorial. \u00a0When we moved to Dallas from Chicago, we knew we'd only be here about 3 years. \u00a0I made a casual goal to patronize as many of the top 100 Dallas restaurants that we could in this time (D Magazine publishes a list). \u00a0Now that we're near the end, I can say that we only made it to about 1/3 of them. \u00a0Oak, the restaurant rated #1, did not make my top 5. \u00a0I felt it too pretentious, overpriced, and the food, though good, either too salty or not well balanced. \u00a0Lucia is my #1, and it seems based on their popularity, that I may not be alone in the Metroplex with that assessment.This speaks both to the quality of the experience at Lucia, but also, I believe, to the demand for high quality eateries in the Dallas area that is still underserved. \u00a0In the last few years, several top chefs have opened locations (think FT33, Nona, Tei An), but demand is outpacing supply. \u00a0More and more professionals are moving to the area every month, (the latest news being Toyota Motor Company announcing that it will move it's NA Headquarters to Plano from California), however, the East and West Coasts still seem to get the majority of the attention from world-class restauranteurs. \u00a0This may be fast changing, all I know is that if I was going to try and open a cutting edge new restaurant concept in America, Dallas would have to be at the top of my list."], ["Melanie T.", "A-MAZ-BALLS in the most un-foodie verbiage possible. Can't wait to go back, great atmosphere, deliciously light Italian fare, wonderful service (Michael will talk food porn in your ear the whole time), and delicious wines - what more could a girl ask for?"], ["Linda E.", "I was so excited to have gotten into Lucia for my birthday via a last minute cancellation! We were told the waiting list was 2 months out. Like many others have speculated, this seems like a false creation to give the illusion this place is in more demand than it actually is. The restaurant is small so I can see how availability would fill up quickly, but we found the restaurant to be half empty the majority of our time there.One of the hostess greeters (who we later found out was the wife/owner) was extremely kind. She opened the door and greeted me, wishing me Happy Birthday! Unfortunately we were seated and got the polar opposite treatment from our waitress. You could see it from the get go. You know, the kind of person that has a permanent scowl on their face. There were several mentions of her in other negative reviews and I don't doubt that it is the same waitress (all the other wait staff were male). Sadly the whole experience was ruined by this one waitress. Every interaction with her was pretentious and painful. She seemed so annoyed and inattentive, like we weren't worthy enough to be in her presence. We started with some drinks. I requested a Grey Goose and tonic, in which she replied with \"We don't have alcohol, I wish we did. We only have wine.\" I decided on a white and my husband got a red, which she proceeded to spill on his phone. She didn't apologize at all and looked annoyed that she had to go get a towel to wipe it off. It was the very bottom of the bottle and he mentioned it tasted like it had turned, that it tasted very sour and vinegary. He had already mentioned he wanted a more bold wine and he reiterated he was looking for something more robust wine with some peppery notes. She immediately cut him off and said \"we don't have anything like that,\" grabbing his glass and walking off annoyed. She came back with a blend that was a little better. At this point we just ready to move on.We asked her to explain some items on the menu. Despite her saying \"All of it's good\" over and over her actual explanation made none of it sounded appealing. \"Oh that's basically a fettuccini noodle...that's like a chicken noodle soup...oh that meal is just pasta, no meat.\" We could not get any sort of fan favorite or recommendation out of her to save our lives. Disheartened we decided on two different boards for our antipasti, the Salumi Misti and the Cheese Board. She said we had to order all our food at once so we hastily ordered a Primi and Secondi dish, letting her know we planned to save room for dessert. She sighed and we said \"Is that not enough food?\" Her sarcastic response was \"If you don't eat a lot.\" The fact of the matter is we had never dined here before. We didn't know how large or rich the dishes would be. This is Italian food! If we're still hungry we can always order more. It was a moot point, she had already written us off. She attended her other tables who ordered bottles of wine and plates of food. It took us three attempts to try and get some bread, which she deliver 30 min later after we had already completed our salumi and cheese boards. We sat most of our meal with dirty dishes that were piling up. After another waiter picked them up for her she came came to wipe off our table haphazardly dumped most of the crumbs in my lap as she looked off to her other \"more important patrons\" that were obviously spending more money. All in all it was such a disappointing experience. Despite us ready to spend several \u00a0hundred on a special birthday dinner we were treated like second class citizens. She even tried to charge us for the glass of wine that was sent back. We got a pen to sign our check that was out of ink. The night was just a series of missteps, one after another. The food was okay, nothing earth shattering like the other reviews have stated and definitely nothing that could offset the steep price tag for such horrible service. We sadly opted to skip dessert and just get out of there altogether. Despite most restaurants offering a complementary Birthday dessert we never got so much as a \"Happy Birthday\" uttered from our waitress. The last blow was the table next to us getting a candle in THEIR Birthday dessert as we were leaving. Nice. On our way out my husband mentioned our horrible experience to the wife/owner. She was appalled and very apologetic, asking us to please come back and give them another chance to make it right. We politely declined. At this point it we wanted to be nowhere near the presence of that waitress. The owner insisted on buying us an item at Dude, Sweet Chocolate next door, which was a kind gesture. Unfortunately the damage was already done. An exceptional waiter once said to us \"We live in Dallas. There is great food all over town! What keeps people coming back is the great service.\" He couldn't have been more right. Unfortunately there's only one chance to make a great first impression, and boy was this a bad one."], ["Britton Y.", "I'll start by saying I am not a picky eater. \u00a0I have traveled and lived all over the world and feel as though I've got a good head on my shoulders when it comes to trying new things and knowing what's what in the culinary world. \u00a0So that brings me to Lucia. \u00a0My wife and I were in the mood for some seriously good Italian food so we got online and looked up the best spot in Dallas and Lucia was number one. So we made a reservation for our anniversary and we were excited to eat some authentic Italian. \u00a0 What we got can only be described as tex-italian. \u00a0The menu is full of foreign words whose translation does not indicate what you actually get. \u00a0 What is the point of a menu, if you cannot determine what you are getting? \u00a0We ordered a cheese plate and meat plate for an appetizer and $32 later, the food volume of two eggs showed up. \u00a0 We expected a typical plate of cooked Italian meats and instead got fatty slices of over salted chew toys and mini slices of bread with liver spread. \u00a0 The cheese plate (remember total volume equivalent to an egg) had four pieces of cheese. \u00a0Two were completely inedible. \u00a0 I do have to say the bread was good. \u00a0 For the main course we ordered two $23 spaghetti and sausage entrees. \u00a0 From what I could tell on the menu \u00a0we both expected spaghetti, red sauce, and slices of sausage. \u00a0 What showed up was an ice cream scoop sized ball of spaghetti with ground up jimmy dean sausage and white cream poured on top. \u00a0 I do not like the over spiced smell or taste of cheap American sausage and that is exactly what we got. \u00a0 If you can imagine biscuits and gravy but with spaghetti instead that is a perfect description. \u00a0 The sausage smell was completely overwhelming and not in a good way like the European sausages I grew up eating. \u00a0My wife tried to eat it so she didn't offend, but only managed a few bites. \u00a0I took one bite and refused to take another. \u00a0 I got mine packed up because my wife didn't want to offend the owner. \u00a0 $120 later and after eating the equivalent of two eggs we walked out and looked for a trash can to ditch the sausage so it didn't stink up our car. \u00a0 This experience ruined our anniversary. \u00a0 We felt so sick about wasting the time, opportunity, \u00a0and money we couldn't even bring ourselves to eat McDonald's on the way home and ended up going 24 hours between meals due to our disgust. \u00a0The bench that I sat on was horribly uncomfortable and I couldn't hear my wife over all of the noise.Some restaurants try to be so unique that their food just becomes weird. \u00a0This is that kind of place. \u00a0Small portions, lack of fresh ingredients, over priced, tex-Italian. \u00a0 SKIP IT!"], ["Melissa W.", "Yum!

The service is always great, the food even better but it is a special occasion only with the prices. \u00a0Lucia is worth every single penny plus more."], ["Francisco A.", "The food was decent and reasonably priced but the overall experience felt like a kick in the balls. Getting a reservation is an egregiously annoying process fueled by the artificial demand their tiny space generates that feels akin to begging. I have been to plenty of nice restaurants that have long waits; except that they actually understand customer service and will do things like pick up the phone when you call instead of awkwardly funneling you through an impersonal voicemail system, and then calling back at odd hours and offering a random time and date in a \"take it or leave it\" fashion. The fact that a restaurant with such a bad initial customer experience is still in business was enough to pique my interest. The awkwardness continued the night before our reservation when I got two frantic calls from somebody at the restaurant. The first was to demand a credit card number; I suppose as some sort of ransom for the privilege of keeping the reservation. The other, sometime after 10 PM, was to let us know that they took the liberty to change our reservation time. So the next morning I had to scramble to let everybody know that the time had changed. Most of us got the message but a couple of people in my party didn't and thus not everybody showed up at the newly allotted time. We were kindly informed of the restaurant's strictly enforced policy of not allowing people to be seated until the entire party is present. Instead, we were forced to stand in the tiny entryway as punishment. Even my very pregnant wife was forced to stand for half an hour while cold faced waiters pushed by. No exceptions. In hindsight, we should have left at this point but the rest of my party informed me that they were on the way and all of us (sans the pregnant wife, duh) had a couple of glasses of mediocre wine in our empty stomachs. This shit better be amazing, right?It was good. Not amazing. Definitely not worth the trouble. The thing about Italian food is that it's super easy to make at home, and nothing is better than a plate of homemade pasta. Even \"fancy\" stuff like foie gras is not hard to make at home, and often better than what you will get at even a nice restaurant. The best dishes were the simplest: foie gras stuffed prunes, fried squid, fresh pasta with a veal ragu. The freshness and quality of the ingredients made the plates stand out. I was particularly underwhelmed by the salumi and cheese plates. My ears perk up whenever I get wind of a place that makes their own charcuterie. I was hoping for something at least on the level of Armandino Batali's Salumi (a place I used to have lunch at once a week) but I was mostly unimpressed with Lucia's creations. The only cut that had flavor and depth was their take on fuet; otherwise, I think they would have done better with whatever Central Market's deli has to offer. Better yet, Meat Parlour's delicious coppa would have been a nice addition. Speaking of Central Market, the cheese board was equally unimpressive. Nothing against CM, but a large store like that is only going to have access to whatever commodity cheeses are available to the mass market. I would have expected a restaurant with this much hype to have exclusive relationships with artisan cheese producers. Instead, we were presented with a pretty standard selection of the kind of Italian cheeses you can buy at your neighborhood grocery store. Granted, I'm a big cheese snob, but all of the best Italian restaurants I have been to either make their own cheese or have a relationship with somebody who does. The ingredients ultimately shape the meal, and thus the uniqueness of a great restaurant lies in their ability to source the freshest and the best.Thus navigating Lucia's menu is akin to having a conversation with a person with a giant vocabulary but little substance. Lots of unfamiliar Italian words for simple pastas and cheeses, the typical mention of an exotic sounding ingredient, and yet despite the pretension there was nothing particularly valuable about the noise. The plates are rather simple, and admittedly well made. Nothing about the menu, however, seemed to justify the mental tax generated by the unfamiliar jargon that only seems there to confuse and intimidate rather than assist and inspire. I think my impression of the menu is a great analogy to the overall experience offered by Lucia. I think back to the menu at a place like El Bulli, which was often just a few well-selected words to describe a dish that had a great story behind it and played out like a drama on your plate. Everything about Lucia, from the reservation process to the act of eating, is overly complicated and painful. I wanted so badly to love this restaurant but if this is what \"fine dining\" is like in Dallas, I think I'll just stay home next time."], ["1289.4 Y.", "This place is only OK.

While the location may scream \"simply trying to get casual diners on their way to events\" the pizza is really... bloody... good. Even the famed margherita; a pizza so simple that most places ruin it with poorly placed ingredients, shines. The pizza is thin; yet holds up and does not \"flip flop\" as if half cooked.

We ordered the metro, but split it half and half between the Della Carne and The Dream. We also got a regular size Black Truffle and Margherita pizza. All were really tasty, but the Black Truffle really stole the show. There was a great aromatic waft of truffle that came off the pizza, and it was perfectly completed by the pieces of Italian ham. I only wish that they had spread the ham more evenly across the whole pizza - it was a bit sparse and seemed like it was only on one side. Service was good and the waiter was attentive without being intrusive. I'm surprised that there weren't more people there.

This is not a pizzeria that I would consider as one of the best in Dallas or a must visit location. If you're in the area then great, give it a shot. Definitely not the most delicious pizza I've tried.Just wanted to update my review and state that the management got in touch with me and offered us to come back at their expense.

However, weren't really impressed by that one but the margarita pizza was delicious! Nice and fresh. Note: It says it feeds 2-3...definitely would have been better for just two, especially if you're hungry. The momma's style looked really good and would be better if you wanted your own pizza/were more hungry.

It wants to be an upscale dining experience in a trendy neighborhood, but it is a casual dining experience in a regular shopping center in a regular neighborhood. There were some standouts, but for the price and wait, I was expecting to be blown away. Instead, I could see highlights of the Mavs game from my table on two flatscreens at the bar, as could everyone else in the restaurant. I arrived with my grandmother late on a Saturday evening. The host station was completely overwhelmed. There wasn't anybody there for several minutes, and when there was, I had to make myself known when I was standing inches from the host stand, facing it. Confusing. We were told 45 minutes (which turned out to be only 20) and made our way to the bar. \u00a0I like the finer things in life so I opted for a $14 glass of wine, but I wasn't super impressed. There is nearly no place to wait, especially if you have kids. The bar area was so cramped so we joined another set of tables to spend our time \u00a0drinking our wine--but the table was filled with glasses and used napkins that weren't their own. Strike 1--nobody wants to sit in somebody else's mess while waiting for a table. As for our eats:Fig and Gorgonzola bruschetta: yes definitely. Served on a little pizza-type bread that was also not crispy like a thick breaded pizza crust. I liked the flavors very much, but the bread could stand a crimping up. Caesar salad: skip. Approximately $1 for each leaf of lettuce slathered in mayo very lightly veiled with lemon and anchovy. Saturday special - Veal Milanese: excellently prepared, if overpriced. All it is is the piece of meat with a little side salad. I enjoyed it but not worth its sticker price. Short rib with polenta: this was great. The short rib was well cooked and the polenta had a ton of flavor. I would order this again. Pistachio almond gelato: highlight of my evening. On par with that I ate in Italy. It comes served with a little biscotti that I scooped up the gelato with.Tiramisu: chocolate cake instead of ladyfingers. It was interesting and definitely had the elements of a good tiramisu, but the chocolate made it too rich after stuffing my face for the previous two hours. There were some hiccups, other than the TVs, hostesses, and dirty bar area throughout the meal as well. Entrees arrived several minutes apart, my gelato was totally forgotten about. I think I wish I had gotten pasta instead of the slightly underwhelming veal. If I get to Dallas again, I would check it out on a weeknight for maybe a more attentive meal and skip the salad and veal.

Rustic chic atmosphere, very interesting choices as decoration. It is a great place to go. Love the chandeliers! Food wise- so yummy! We were in a group so we shared many appetizers. The gorgonzola with figs bruschetta is excellent, tortellini fonduta is delicious although the portion is tiny (about 4 or 5 tortellinis). Then we shared some desserts and I loved all of them- the presentation are really nice. They have a pastry chef, it makes all the difference in the world! My favorite was the short cake Sundae but the Lemon curd tart was great too.Really want to go back and try other dishes. Seems to me Princi has the most diverse Italian menu in Dallas.

After a stressful one hour episode of me stupidly locking my boyfriend's keys in his running car at Target, we made it there 10 minutes after the group had ordered. Since it was rather late and I didn't want a heavy meal before going out for the night, I went with the Warm Farro Crab Salad. I was nervous it wouldn't be enough, but there was still some left on my plate when I was finished. I was very happy with my choice, although I wish there was more crab and less farro (isn't that always the case?). Boyfriend got the salmon cooked medium rare and it was awesome.

Our waiters seemed a bit wet behind the ears...or he might have fallen prey to Katie's beauty. That happens all the time when we go out to lunch. Either way he was attentive.

There should be parking right out front, and if not, you'll have to street park.You definitely need to make reservations, as the restaurant itself is tiny!

We arrived a few minutes before 830pm and we asked to wait outside until our table was ready - there literally isn't anywhere to wait inside! It was a nice night though so we sat on their bench out front and opened our bottle of wine. Oh did I not mention that yet!? Yes, Urbano is BYOB!

The only way I can describe this is \"ERMAGERD\" (Proper English cannot describe this dish) delicious.

They were closing down for the afternoon, though I walked in 45 minutes beforehand. Anyway, the brought my food out in a swift manner, so much so that my soup was unpalatably hot.The pureed cauliflower was near the bland end of the salt spectrum, and the texture tasted a little off--neither rustic/chunky or smooth.The mozzarella sammie boasted a pretty neat cross-hatch grilling, but the sandwich itself was pretty lukewarm. Flavorwise, the pesto was pretty good, but the tomato and mozzarella just didn't do it this time around.Urbano Cafe is undoubtedly a \"foodie spot\", what with its local flare and emphasis on fresh, clean grub.

The risotto was a little off. The rice was a little gummy and chalky at the same time. tasted like it had not been cooked long enough and stirred over zealously.The desserts were simply too big and served in a kind of plop it down on the plate way.

Turns out, I was highly mistaken; the kitchen is extremely professional and accomplished. Before I begin with the meal, a tip of my hat to the chef; Nothing is oversalted or over-creamed; two phenomena that are all too common. You won't feel that it is missing, but it is not hiding the flavor of the food. Here is the play by play: AntiPasti: CalamariThis IS NOT a rubbery fried mess (it almost always is; which is part of the reason why i don't always order it). This is a non-greasy, lightly crusted, flash fried, tender dish that left me wondering where they purchase such fresh calamari in a land-locked city. I didn't taste the herbs that they touted, but it's not necessary with calamari this well prepared. It was served with a marinara that was light and citrusy; in no way bland. Insalata e zuppa: \u00a0I ordered the beet salad. it is a rather generous serving of fresh watercress tossed with a balsamic, enveloped by roasted beets (red and golden variety), topped with walnuts, and then accentuated with a lightly breaded, flash fried, cake of herbed goat cheese. Perfectly executedMy wife's clam chowder was not too salty; and had a distinctive clam flavor. Primo:I ordered the salmon. It is perched on top of a risotto mixed with fresh julienned squash, zuchini, and brocolli. The vegetables were slightly cooked and retained their natural aromas with a \u00a0perfect texture. The salmon was well prepared, but could have spent slightly less time in the oven so that it was more moist. It wasn't dry, as it was grilled and then baked to present two different textures, it just could have been taken out a few minutes earlier. The risotto was well prepared, but seemed to be missing a certain someting (a nice rosemary, thyme, and lemon zest concoction perhaps)? It was topped with a surprisingly flavorful bruschetta style tomato and basil mixture. I mixed this with the meat and risotto.My wife ordered the Fettucini with Tenderloin MedallionsI just tasted some of her left-overs; and must state that this dish's description is under-described by the menu. The meat was cooked well done, as she asked, yet not dry. Instead of the small medallions I expected, she was given easily 6-8 oz of meat; enough that it arguably could have been listed on the meat section rather than the pasta. The fettuccini was perfectly al-dente. It was thicker than you would expect from dry pasta so I don't know if they make their own, or go to a specialty shop. Either way, it was not an afterthought or a filler ingredient. The mushrooms were not soggy, but flavorful and had great texture. The meat sauce was a lightly creamed meat sauce / gravy with a refreshingly subtle flavor that took the dish to the next level. The citrusy flavors appear to have come from the diced tomatoes tossed in the dish, that were added early enough to contribute to the flavor while not becoming soggy. Dolce e Cafe: My espresso was extremely thick and flavorful. I suck down coffee like it's going out of style , and I had to sip this small cup and savor the quality. My wife's creme brulee was topped with brown sugar, and filled with fresh strawberry. This added an additional flavor that took it over the top. This is the first creme brulee that I have tried that didn't feel like a custard; but rather a light and creamy dessert.Drinks: My \u00a0wife's dirty martini, along with my old-fashioned, seemed to be watered down. The flavor is there, the liquor is not. If you are an old school drinker; you may miss the intensity of the drinks. If you are a light drinker, you can feel safe ordering from their bar.Staff: They are attentive but not intrusive.Another note: it was our anniversary dinner and I was not disappointed. I didn't let them know because we don't like the fanfare; but they did handle a birthday with a sparkler cake but no singing.. Which was celebratory but not tacky."], ["Gianna K.", "Food was good.

The others in my party thought the overall food was decent, but the desert ruined it for them. Crem brulee was mealy and the mango flan was extremely tough. The other entrees weren't special either, didn't feel authentic Italian.Service was fine. Overall setting was dark, romantic like, and the live music was a bit loud.

I had seen the hidden back pizza selection at Ravenna before, which serves til late at night, up until they close.Perhaps the only saving grace of tourist trap Ravenna, where even an effort at dim lighting can't manifest charm in what feels like a faux Italian bistro dump, and yet still the proprietor insults locals with $20 pasta dishes where the dull reputation alone doesn't even warrant an experimental order.I got a slice of pepperoni, with the only other option being cheese. \u00a0I went to the bar to pay where a bartender preoccupied with closing out tabs did not greet me.After at least a minute of waiting to give her a chance to respond, \"how much is the slice?\"\"$4.01\" she uttered without glancing at me.I pulled out a five and a penny and continued to wait. \u00a0I enjoyed the existentialist absurdity of a Coehn brothers scene. \u00a0 After another full minute -\"I'm ready to pay now.\" \u00a0I said.\"Do you need change.\" She spoke effortlessly unfriendly. \"Yeah.\" I said with an upbeat lilt that was a little ironic and mocking. \u00a0It was my dollar. \u00a0It was my slice. \u00a0It was my exit. The crust tasted of flour and garlic, the sauce was thin and the cheese not over portioned, it was arguably not worth $4. \u00a0It wasn't gourmet, but rather like a hot pocket product. \u00a0The slice filled a need, but I'd maybe next time bike over to Serious Pizza \u00a0for better slices at about the same price."], ["Monique K.", "Over a weekend visit to Dallas with my Mom we stopped into Ravenna after a recommendation from our hotel.
