The first time was a few years ago, and I must have totally ordered the wrong thing because I didn't come back until friends dragged me here on what I'll refer to henceforth as \"the duck hunt\". Fast forward to the other night, after 10pm, Toulouse is not only still open, still serving food, but also pretty empty. Great news for us - excellent service, quick food delivery, and intimate setting. I think everything we had could be written up as a stand out dish - the duck and chicken were both superbly rendered with crispy skin and cooked to the appropriate wellness. The gnocchi were also fantastic - perfect little doughy pillows. I wish it had been served with a brown butter sauce as described on the menu, but the red sauce accompanying it was pretty tasty too. Don't even get me started on the garlic and herb butter sauce surrounding the escargot. That plus their warm table bread was so good I can't imagine why whoever I was with when I came here the first time let me leave without stuffing that kind of delicious into my face. Wine by the glass is about $8-10. They had a nice chenin blanc when I was there the other day that was both affordable and paired well with the variety of different types of poultry and pasta/bread that I shared with my generous and obviously-educated-in-what-to-order-at-Toulouse dining companions. If you're hungry after 10pm on a weekday for duck and or snail, this is the spot. Parking is also plentiful in the area (2hr spots all around Knox) if you dine a bit on the late side."], ["Allison B.", "Fabulous for brunch and lunch! This place has excellent staff and menu.

Between the 3 of us, we had the quiche, the calamari, lobster salad and the scallops with ratatouille. The food was very good, except the lobster salad - the salad itself was scrumptious, except the lobster that didn't taste quite right (I don't know if it wasn't fresh or it was previously frozen...). Great for people watching too. All in all, I would go back and recommend it to others. It was pricey but worth it, and you definitely got what you paid for.

I didn't feel like we were ever waiting for food or the bill. Also, we told the waitress we were sharing two dishes, and she was kind enough to serve them on separate plates!We tried the eggs florentine and the orange french toast. Both were delicious and came in perfect portion sizes. The eggs florentine is like an eggs benedict with lump crab and vegetables instead of canadian bacon. The orange french toast is infused with an orange flavor and comes with a side of berries, bananas, and cream. My plates were wiped clean. They serve Mighty Leaf tea for any tea drinkers out there. We wanted to try the beignets with cappuccino sauce, but held off thinking it would be too much food. They also have a lot of other brunch options that sound amazing. Will probably be coming back soon."], ["Ryan V.", "Excellent. I had the lobster risotto and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e; it was incredible. Well the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was alright.

Your cuisine is so overpriced, but if that's the case, it should be all about the dining experience. Abacus you \"ain't.\" I had a Groupon.

She was under the weather so I asked if they could accommodate a party of one in a Saturday night. I was told, \"just come, just come.\"And so I did.

As they bring me a beautiful asparagus soup, I heard the other lady they placed in a corner thank her Gar\u00e7on. Any time he addressed her? He addressed her as \"Dear.\" We spoke after she paid her check. She agreed the \"dear\" was very offensive. But she just wanted to spoil herself about once a month. I've been spoiled, and Cacharel is not it, even with the $84 price tag on a steak. I'm used to having the same person as my server. I felt like a leftover. One brought me a wine list and later a nice fume blanc. Another took my order and maybe brought my soup. After that, my food was slapped on my table and then I was ignored. Cacharel...Georges Cinq you are not!!! I did have a very nice meal. The pork chop was interesting. Even though the meat closest to the bone was blood red, I prefer a juicy pork chop instead of a dry one. The Irish Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e was nowhere close to how great Pappadeaux's is. But then this is all about the nice dining experience. Oh, and because I was a single woman dining there, I could not get the attention of any of my many, many different servers to bring me the check.

It tasted good, but it had the consistency of water. Not sure how you get a soup that thin. Entree was pan seared salmon. Excellent preparation and well executed. Perfect sear on the outside and tender throughout. Sits on a bed of diced celery root, snow peas, and cherry tomatoes. Very clean dish. They told me I couldn't have the lava cake for dessert. No explanation...even when i pressed for one. Whatever. Second choice was chocolate souffl\u00e9. It was really good and came with fresh whipped cream on the side. I should mention the terrific staff. They are all courteous and attentive. Great atmosphere for date night. Outstanding views overlooking the football stadium.

If you want a special evening out, I highly recommend Cacharel in Arlington."], ["Mike P.", "Very good atmosphere and good food. Beautiful view."], ["Lisa F.", "Simply amazing! Can't tell you how many amazing meals we have had there. The environment and customer service are stellar as well. This is our go-to place for celebrations, and we get here as much as we can. They never let us down. If you haven't tried their desserts, you aren't truly living, btw!"], ["Jenn M.", "I went here for a Valentines Day dinner, while the food was tasty it was highly overpriced. It's a set price menu so even if I didn't want an appetizer I was charged for one anyways. With that being said the food was delicious. I had the baked scallop starter and it was surprisingly a bigger portion than expected. I then had the beef, it was perfectly cooked but the potato and steamed asparagus sides were minimal. I would have come here for dessert alone, I had the Baileys crime br\u00fbl\u00e9e....perfection and my date had the chocolate souffl\u00e9 also incredible.

There's chain restaurants everywhere you look and the only non-chains tend to be Asian or Mexican. Cacherel is a breath of fresh air amid the bright lights and subpar food (I'm looking at you highlands area). My gf went here on a date after getting tired and frustrated at the lack of good food around here. They have a fixed menu which includes an appetizer, main, and dessert, or you can choose from their full menu. Personally, I think $50 is a great deal for a well prepared meal. Their escargot with mushrooms, grapes, and garlic was excellent. My gf got a very substantial pork chop with curry, and I got bronzini with vegetables. Both were cooked perfectly and tasted great. The creme brule was standard as was their chocolate souffl\u00e9, but still well done and delicious. If you want a nice, classic french meal that's well executed with nice atmosphere and service, check this place out. Just don't forget to dress up."], ["Ann T.", "I had one of the most pleasant dining experiences ever at Cacharel. And for that, I give this restaurant five stars.

I heard about this place originally from our limo driver while going to a concert a friend was playing at.Service was on par with fine dining and our food was a hit. The wife had Duck and butternut squash soup and I had Buffalo with the same soup. I can say that the buffalo was probably the best piece of meat I've ever had. There is no other place that can beat my cooking when it comes to meat, this one did. The vegitables were crisp and fresh and soup was delectable. For dessert we shared the souffl\u00e9 that was out of this world! If you have not been here and want a great dinner with your significant other, drop by.

I went with the regular and got the buffalo. There aren't words to describe how good this was. No words. I could have cut it with fork it was so tender, juicy and flavorful. If that wasn't enough, I had some of almost all of the sides (creamed corn, spinach, mashed potatoes, gratin potatoes, more) and they were all amazing. Then I stuck my spoon in a couple people's desserts. I'm pretty sure there's nothing they do wrong here, but if I ever get the chance to come back, I'm all over that buffalo and gratin.

The view is of the street below and the roller coaster at Six Flags. Meh.- For the higher prices we paid (need to lower them) and the decent \u00a0variety/selections on the menu, the food slightly missed the mark.. Now for the good:-Once seated, service was very good, very attentive & professional - with everyone we encountered.- Food looked beautiful, and was brought out in a timely manner. My filet was good, but a little overcooked and lacking seasoning. The spinach/goat cheese salad was delicious. The asparagus was a little too crunchy. The escargot was good, but not as flavorful or tender as it could be. The bread pudding was good, but not decadent as I expected it to be - rich, sweet and creamy - it was kind of bland.The live music was nice to listen to and not loud. All in all, the food was above average, just slightly off.

Let me explain: I came here on a slow Sunday evening, but we had to wait to get our order a little longer than I would have expected. And on top of that, when our food came, it turned out that the chef had prepared the wrong order for my mom! So she had to wait an extra 15 minutes while they prepared the correct dish. I was actually pretty upset. However, when the check came, the waiter (who I believe was dealing with his own issues since he was also working at the bar) had removed my mom's dish from the check because of their mistake. I appreciated how he recognized their mistake without us having to point it out or complain. (I don't normally complain at restaurants because I don't think it's worth it, but if service/something is bad, I'll make a mental note to just not come back in the future.)The menu itself isn't huge, but I thinK they have a great selection. They have great \"fancy\" salads and classic dishes with a little twist (like on their special/seasonal menu, lobster mac and cheese, BBQ chicken pizza, etc.) They prices are a little high, but the atmosphere is nice, and you can expect the same Nordstrom-quality customer service, which is why we will come back in the future."], ["Jason B.", "Bazille is another place I had bookmarked. \u00a0So it was time to check it out.

They had several French wines that I wasn't familiar with and she was really great at explaining the flavor profiles without being snooty at all. We ordered the Fried Almonds to start and for our main entrees, I ordered the Sea Scallops and my husband ordered the Jamon Iberico. Get the almonds! They were fantastic -- drizzled in olive oil and fried rosemary, and totally unlike anything I've ever had. My sea scallops were perfection and served on a bed of risotto. (So so so good that my husband kept asking for bites and ended up eating half my plate.) The Jamon Iberico is just ok. It's one of their House Specialties, and it's not that it's bad -- it's just not great. It would be better suited as a shared appetizer, rather than an entree. My husband kept mentioning throughout the dinner that he wished he had ordered something different because he was still hungry. (It was essentially cured ham slices and several slices of a baguette.)We'll definitely be back, but we'll probably save this place as a \"special occasion\" restaurant since it's decently pricey. Dinner ended up being around $135 with the almonds, two entrees and two glasses of wine."], ["Ann M.", "Don't go for brunch! We went to Mercat Bistro today for brunch (Sunday) we won't be back anytime soon. The food was good. The service was so terrible it didn't matter the food was good. Our waiter Andrew was the worst waiter. He has clearly never been trained. We sat for 15 minutes before we took out beverage order. It took another 20 minutes for our beverages to be delivered. Then he didn't return to take our food order for another 15 minutes. I ordered a chocolate croissant, which sat on the bar waiting for him to bring it to us for 10 minutes. Our food was delivered by a very friendly man, wish he had been our waiter. All of Andrew's tables were frustrated, it wasn't just us. The wonderful staff dressed in all black was great. Attentive, friendly and quick. They refilled it glasses, responded to requests (for silverware and a napkin) and served our food before it got cold. We had to give our check and credit card to a woman in a skirt and jacket (hostess?) because Andrew never came back to get it.Rebecca the hostess was awesome. She pitched in on Andrews other tables, getting drinks, assisting and being generally helpful. What a lousy experience. I'm so disappointed. It was one of my favorite spots, not anymore."], ["Daphne A.", "Delicious food. Sure their menu is not purely French, but who cares? The food is made with quality ingredients and is reminiscent of the French bistros that I've enjoyed in France. The service is attentive -- almost too attentive and the indoor and outdoor seating is great for a date night or with a group of friends. While I would love to give it another star, the only reason I am not is because when my friends and I were dining outside on a Saturday night, 18-wheel trucks kept pulling up next to the restaurant and idling their trucks, releasing air pressure, etc. While the restaurant is beautiful, it was like eating in the parking lot of a truck stop. This is beyond their control and not sure if this happens every night but a major distraction nonetheless."], ["IRAIS F.", "I absolutely LOVE Mercat Bistro. It has never disappointed me and quickly became my \"go-to\" spot for brunch and special occasions. I came here one day with my friends for brunch and we sat out on the patio and had the best time. The weather was perfect and we didn't want to leave. Normally, Mercat closes from 3pm-5pm, but the restaurant stayed open for us so we could keep enjoying the day. The manager, David, was so incredibly nice and even took us on a mini tour of the new restaurants that will be opening in Dallas. It was amazing and sealed the deal for me that Mercat is an extra special place and goes above and beyond for their customers.The food is absolute perfection every time I go. I've been for cocktails, pastries, brunch and dinner, and I've never had anything I didn't thoroughly enjoy. The sheshito peppers are a must as an appetizer and I'm not even one to eat peppers. Also, get the goat cheese with honey. Every bite is heaven. And of course you must have a croissant, cheese Danish and even the almond croissant. For brunch, the Eggs Neptune are pretty awesome. Very flavorful and light. If you want a heart brunch item, then get the Croque Monsieur. It's epic and delish.As far as dinner items go, everything is delicious, but the scallops with mushroom risotto is my all time favorite. The scallops are cooked perfectly and the risotto is creamy and balances the scallops just right. If you happen to be there on a Monday for dinner, then get a side of the special table side pasta. They make it right at your table inside of a giant cheese wheel. It's rich, so share it with a friend...it's a must. I'm a huge cocktail drinker and absolutely love the St. Flora. It's a champagne drink mixed with St. Germaine and is sweet but so refreshing. Definitely a great alternative if you don't like mimosas. For dessert, I'm not huge on desserts, but all of the ones I've tried there have been delicious. However, if you're looking for a night cap instead of dessert, then the Tourbillon is out of this world. It's a coffee drink that is poured over a chocolate ice ball. It like Christmas and Godiva in a glass. Only bad thing is that it's seasonal. Check and see if they have it and if they do, GET IT."], ["Kerry N.", "Loved it! This quaint restaurant is perfect for a ladies lunch or a romantic dinner. The quiche was excellent as well as the pastries and desserts. I love the eclectic China the dishes are served on. We will be back!"], ["Christina R.", "Hidden away in the shadow of a high-rise office building, this restaurant is the best French cuisine I've tasted outside of France. My top 3 faves:1. Their delicious, rich proprietary coffee blend that is made in Colorado by the owner's friend & isn't sold anywhere else in Dallas.2. Flaky, buttery, hand-made fresh Croissants (please bring the ham & cheese back!)3. Quiche so dense & rich that you don't need to eat another meal later The ambience is lovely & romantic: outdoors on the patio under umbrellas & string lights, or indoors with rock salt candle votives flickering on the tables & the dark wood throughout."], ["Kortni K.", "Came here for brunch this morning for the first time and it was outstanding!

Wth were they thinking?? People(including myself) would fight tooth and nail for these artisan wonders of the Dallas pastry world, and now they are a notch (just barely) above Pillsbury Croissants! Whomever made this decision needs to be tarred and feathered for committing such gastronomic blasphemy!. It gets one star for staff, one for the dinner and other menu items (minus 1 for mgmt decision to allow this change, minus 1 for the Pillsbury croissant)"], ["Mindy C.", "Sunday morning brunch here was not busy at all. We made reservations 15 minutes before we planned to arrive and it was not a problem. Although, for the restaurant not being busy, we got sat at a less than ideal table. We asked to be moved to the window and the host completely ignored us. They put us right up front, near the hostess stand, and the chairs were not comfortable. One side of the table was a cushioned bench and the other were these old wooden chairs. The tables were TOO CLOSE TO EACH OTHER also. Another party was attempted to be seated next to us and when they asked the host for another table due to the closeness, they were accommodated. How lovely... We parked across the street and apparently had gotten there before valet had the chance to set up, so we parked for free. Not that this is what you should aim for but just a note. We had no idea they had valet in that lot before arriving. It was only after we were leaving the restaurant that we saw the entire set up, but it was no problem getting in our car and leaving. This being said, I think valet may be your only choice to getting parking relatively close to the restaurant. We opted to sit inside due to the heat, but the PATIO would've been great in nicer weather. The patio is a decent size with numerous tables and I completely see the potential in this place. They have lights strung around the patio and I'm sure it would've made for a great place to have dinner. We arrived expecting to be able to get scotch eggs. They apparently only offer them during dinner, so we were pretty disappointed. The breakfast/brunch menu is short with not many options. I know this is a French restaurant, and I'm not sure how naive this will sound, but I had expected it to be more French-like. They did have the small decorative plates though haha. The wait staff came over WAY TOO MANY TIMES to ask us how our food was. Literally our waitress asked us, she walked away, then another waitress asked us seconds later. It was overkill. Not to mention, they kept interrupting our conversations to ask us if the food was all right. Anyways, for being a French restaurant, there were only two crepe options. For $13 a crepe order, you'd think you'd get more than one crepe too. We passed, also because they were not unique crepes in our opinions. No offense, but I could make a strawberry crepe at home. From the other reviews, my sister and I split the Croque Madame. I'm glad we did because the plate was very filling for us both. We got ours with fries, because why not ? I liked the dish (with my added hot sauce), but I would try other dishes before ordering this one again."], ["Abi G.", "Disappointment.My boyfriend and I had a reservation here on a Sunday. The hostess was awful. We told her our names three times and were left standing for a really long time. Waitresses kept walking by and asking if we needed help. A manager came and talked to her for a bit. We kept waiting.A table behind her was open the entire time. The table was set, even. Finally, we were seated there. The white china plates were pretty. Too bad there was a dead fly on my boyfriend's. The hostess took the plate, shook off the fly, and started to put it back down. We had to tell her we wanted a clean plate. So we were off to a bad start.Our actual waitress took a while to get around to us. She was really nice and quite apologetic, but they must have been understaffed. I think she was doing the best she could because she looked very busy.THE FOOD:The almond croissant and lavender latte I ordered were very tasty. My meal was so-so and kind of cold. I ordered a chipotle benedict sandwich. Not really worth waiting around forever for.My guess is it's the atmosphere that brings most people here, because the service wasn't very good and the food was so-so. If you like Uptown, this is the atmosphere for you. There was a very loud DJ outside (even for Sunday brunch, which is kind of weird) and the crowd is the too-cool-for-you type. I won't be coming back."], ["Heli M.", "Local ingredients. French inspired. Intimate, cozy interior. Open, romantic patio with beautiful, upscale cafe seating and magical strung lights. Add in spectacular, attentive customer service and there's only one place that comes to mind: Mercat Bistro.How I overlooked this place, I may never know. It is pretty hidden... but I guess that's how it retains it's secret hideout feel. Their charcuterie was beautiful and equally appetizing: a variety of cheeses including a unique type of goat cheese and ricotta, honey, prosciutto. Their pomme des frites were served french style alongside mayo instead of ketchup, homemade and delectable. For the main course, we went for the rotisserie chicken and the Cobia fish (served alongside king crab) which were both juicy, tender and mouthwatering. The meal was so great and I loved how the staff allowed us to take our time and enjoy each course. By the end of it all I was so stuffed and happy that I moved outside to enjoy a second glass of wine and some fresh air. The patio area had me sold.Also--- It's so close to the AT&T PAC and the Winspear that it will be on our must-dine list before our next show!"], ["Charlotte J.", "Overall, our experience at Mercat warrants something closer to 3.5 stars. But since I can't give increments of stars (and since the food was ultimately very good) I'm rounding it up to four. Here are a few things I would do differently if I were to go back to Mercat.  \u00a0- \u00a0I would come earlier. We made reservations for 1:30 PM on Saturday, and the kitchen closes at 2:00. We found out that by this point they've run out of many items, especially their housemade pastries and croissants, which I was very much looking forward to trying.  - I would sit inside. Even if the weather forecast says it's going to be sunny and 80 degrees, Mercat's patio (while lovely) is right in this little corridor under concrete, where (at least at 1:30 in the afternoon) there is no sun and such incredible wind that the tables were shaking. It really made the dining experience less than pleasant.  - I would ask what comes on the side of a dish before I order it. I ordered the Fresh Vegetable Crepes and my boyfriend ordered the Hatch Chile Crepes, and since the menu didn't say anything about them coming with any sides, we ordered a side of breakfast potatoes to share. The waiter didn't blink an eye. When the crepes came, there was already healthy portion of potatoes on the side of both. To the waiter's credit, he apologized for not telling us originally that our crepes would come with potatoes, and took the second order of breakfast potatoes back. The crepes themselves were good, although not what I expected. Both were more like an omelet wrapped in a crepe. My boyfriend called it the \"French Breakfast Burrito\". The breakfast potatoes were nice, very crispy with the right amount of salt. When we found out that they were out of almost all their pastries, we ordered one they still had available (a small loaf of banana walnut bread) and a bowl of fresh fruit to share. The banana walnut bread was really a cake, almost too sweet, very decadent. The bowl of fresh fruit was lovely. We also shared a decaf nonfat latte, which was very nice. I have no problem with the quality of the food, which is why Mercat is getting 4 stars from me. Give them a try for brunch sometime, just come early enough to get a croissant before they run out."], ["Vendredi C.", "Listen. You must come here. Why you ask?Of course the food is delicious. I, and everyone I know who has tried them, are hooked on the Mercona almonds. But the atmosphere is even better. The whole environment, the plates, the music - it's all as classy and relaxing as you could desire, and you so you won't want to leave.But want to know a secret? Stop by sometime in the morning or afternoon for coffee. Not only will you have a delicious drink, but you'll get to hangout with Stephen, who you will love and who will make you a great drink. Talking with him will make everything seem right with the world.Also, the wine selection is quite good and the servers will be able to tell you all about the different options."], ["Linda D.", "What an amazing small restaurant that provides exquisite food and service! \u00a0This restaurant is tucked right behind St. Anne's so it can be easily be missed if you access the restaurant off of Harwood; The entrance to the restaurant is actually behind Harwood. No need to worry about parking because they offer complimentary valet. I love that this bistro doesn't just serve wine exclusively but also have an open bar. Their selection of cheeses are amazingly good and of all flavors to combine with all sorts of sliced exquisite meet with bread. I had a dish of cobia fish with shredded crab laid on top of a full layer of cream that tasted like lemon buttery heaven. \u00a0 Oh my!! this sauce melted in my mouth and I wanted more after almost licking my plate clean.

Eventually the hostess came back and apologized and said she would take our order despite the kitchen closure. She assured us it would be no trouble. Within five minutes we had our lattes and ten minutes later we had our crepes. I had the hatch chile crepe. It was really good and the potatoes were spicy.

It's one of those places where you walk in and say \"omg so cute!\" Perfect for a girls brunch! Their quiches are made in a really unique way, super fluffy filling (like 3\" tall) that just melts in your mouth (almost pudding like--I know it sounds weird but it works). I've never had quiches like the ones at Mercat that it makes it so hard to eat a quiche anywhere else. Coffee is legit too.

Salads that provide a cacophony of flavors, perfectly grilled meats of such quality that they melt in your mouth, desserts worth the calories, an owner who will help you pair the perfect wine or beer with your meal, and an ambience that evokes casual and intimate elegance, Bouchon 1314 is a new star in the culinary constellations of Dallas.With an art deco mural on one wall and the others showcasing the wine selection, Bouchon 1314's ambience was warm and inviting. The din of many conversations with classic jazz as an undertone set the mood. \u00a0The owner, Jean-Michel Sakouhi, makes everyone feel special.Caesar salad was perfection with a clearly traditional French house made dressing complete with anchovy garnish and homemade croutons. Beet and arugula salad combined the nuttiness of arugula and tanginess of goat cheese in vinaigrette with citrus undertones. \u00a0Accompanying the arugula were 4 savory balls of fried goat cheese that exploded in the mouth with a moment of crispiness followed by a burst of soft, tangy goat cheese. I have found a new addiction.It's difficult to capture the incredible flavors of the entrees with words. \u00a0The filet mignon, grilled perfectly by Chef Victor, all but melted in the mouth with the perfect amount of char outside and tenderness inside. \u00a0The swordfish was equally lovely with char and flakiness. \u00a0Delicious when eaten plain, the meats' respective sauces elevated their counterparts to an ethereal level of savory succulence. \u00a0The sides, asparagus, carrot, and potatoes au gratin, were perfect accompaniments for the perfectly portioned steak and swordfish.

Salut!"], ["Heather L.", "Dallas has needed a restaurant like this for a long time! It has an affable owner checking on the tables and welcoming guests.We started off with the mussels. I am sure the type rotates by what is in season but these were Prince Edward Island mussels. They were cooked perfectly and were the tender type of mussels, not the small chewy kind. \u00a0The portion was not huge which is preferable for an appetizer. The mussels came in a Proven\u00e7al broth and came with plenty of yummy crusty bread to soak up the rest of the sauce. The only thing I would suggest here would be to put salt on the table. When eating the broth by itself, I would have liked to have added a little salt to it.Next for me was the kale salad with blue cheese and pickled onions. The salad was warm so kale was tender. It also had bacon in it so made it a great combo with the blue cheese. My husband had the mixed green salad with Bouchon's house dressing. It was a very good fresh salad with some vegetables in it as well.I had the Manhattan steak from the regular menu, and my husband had the lamb shank special. My steak was slightly overcooked but had excellent flavor with the bone attached. It came with some cheesy gratin potatoes that were also good and some fresh asparagus that was cooked well. \u00a0The lamb shank came on a bed of Israeli couscous with yellow squash and zucchini. \u00a0It had rosemary and a sweetness to it that went well with the meat. The shank was super tender and fell off the bone. For dessert, we went with the flourless chocolate cake. It was good but nothing extremely notable about it. \u00a0The other two options were mousse and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, neither of which appeal to me but know many others that love these. And for the wine...oh the wine...wine is one of the main reasons to come here. The list is large with lots of the world represented (not just California) and excellently priced. The wines I know were at least 25% cheaper than other restaurants. You can also go look at the wine on the walls and not just look at the list itself. Great concept! \u00a0I would come here just to hang out at the bar, order a cheese or charcuterie tray and drink a bottle of good wine or bubbly for a reasonable price.The decor is pretty with dark wood and comfy chairs. Part of the room has beams on the ceiling which gives the decor a French feel. There is also a long, inviting bar. However, I think they only have wine and beer now. One thing I would suggest is putting little candles on the tables to warm up the glow of the room. The location is also great. It is west of the crazy part of the Bishop Arts District. \u00a0The strip where Bouchon is located looks like a cute little downtown area. Another great perk compared to the main part of Bishop Arts is that we easily found a parking place without having to valet!No reservations taken so far.

Had an amazing chicken dish with salad. Last night we arrived at 5:30 for wine and appetizers. Service was just ok. Once it got busy, they forgot about us, and it felt like they wanted us to leave. While I waited for my friend to finish her wine, I had to ask for water refills. Finally they did ask us to leave, but more on that later. We started with the steak tartare and asked for the fries crispy. It arrived with regular fries on the side and an EXTRA order (big bowl which they charged us for) of crispy fries. We asked for mayonnaise and ketchup which we received. Then we ordered the lemon tart for dessert and it was awful. The texture of the crust turned into what I can only compare to communion in my mouth It was nearly burnt and separated from the tart. It did not taste fresh. The lemon was overpowering - not light or refreshing. It had a terrible aftertaste. Perhaps it could have been sweeter, although I understand it will be tangy. So we told them and they brought us a nice chocolate mousse instead. They charged us for the tart but not the mousse. We decided that was ok, and also that we wouldn't mention the extra fries. Then someone from the staff (hadn't spoken to us before) came over to our table and told us someone with a reservation was waiting and could we sit outside. We were uncomfortable, offended, and not finished, but we stood and went to valet stand to discuss another place to finish our evening. My friend went back in to get her vest - in our rush to leave she had left it at the table. While she was putting it on she told them that we were sorry we took up their table but didn't like being asked to leave and felt rushed out. He insisted that he'd only suggested we finish up outside. We said it's cold! He said it's lovely outside with our heaters.

A medium filet that was very good indeed (the person who had it, said \"best filet ever.\". The ray which was done with wine, capers, shallots.

It was pouring rain and a little chilly as we made our way in. It was cozy and casually elegant. I knew a good dinner was in store. I noticed this place driving by for the past couple of months, then a well heeled friend tipped me off that I should try, so it's been on my priority dining list. She thought I'd love it and was correct. The wine list is global and has options for all budgets. I ordered a filet mignon with pepper sauce and frites. My handsome date had the steak tar tar. I nibbled on his plate, and he on mine. The dishes were both excellent and of highest quality ingredients. Toulouse is French fast food. La Bilboquet is quality and the pepper sauce was perfectly done! I thought I must be in Paris or Montreal with the ambiance, delicious dishes, and don't forget the pouring rain. The tar tar had capers and anchovies. My mouth is watering as I'm writing this review. My steak arrived at the right temp. After dinner, we shared the Profiteroles for dessert with a glass of port. I think I licked the plate. No disappointments! This is the type of restaurant we need in this area. I can't wait to go back for lunch on a beautiful day and sit on their patio. The service was friendly and impeccable. Another note about the ambiance that I appreciated was the music. Most restaurants you hear loud talking. Yes, you hear the talking here, but at just the right level, there's also music. Yes, I want music while I eat! Loud enough to discern, but not so loud that I can't enjoy a conversation. Classic R&B is a great choice of music because everyone enjoys from your grandma, to your 4 year old.

The food tasted good, but not exciting in the least - and the prices seemed mismatched to the experience. The service was more stiff and cold than their dress would have led one to believe and the rolls were terrible. However, the espresso was fantastic.-The Long-I am from New York, and my partner and I never got a chance to try the New York location while we lived there. We were ecstatic to find out there was a location that had just opened up here in Dallas with the same chef and food, and decided to try it for lunch. There was not yet a Yelp review when we went there.We went on a Thursday afternoon to find about a third-full restaurant with a neatly dressed older crowd, asked if we had reservations [we did not], then promptly seated without hassle.Off the bat, we noticed some odd things for a restaurant of this price range and reputation:1. The servers were dressed in a variety of mismatched clothing such as jeans or khakis - this just seemed out of sync with not only the crowd and atmosphere, but also the coldness of the service.2. The rolls brought to the table were absolutely terrible. They were noticeably cold in the middle as if they had been heated from frozen, as well as very dry and crumbly - similar to those served on an airplane - but cold.3. Not having wine with our lunch did not seem appreciated - we were planning on having espresso after lunch.4. A man with a measuring tape kept measuring the entire depth of the restaurant directly behind our table . This could not have been done before or after hours?The Lunch:One of us had the halibut \u00a0which was well seasoned and cooked to perfection and served over arugula and cherry tomatoes. The vegetables were well selected and fit the dish. Overall the dish was deemed to be refreshing, but very safe - and made an excellent plate for a light lunch.I had the Cajun Chicken - The portion was very large. The light cream sauce drizzled over the chicken was very good and the chicken was cooked perfectly. The chicken was served with fries and a small salad. This dish was pretty good overall, but made for a big lunch compared to my counterpart.We finished off the meal with espresso - this was probably the highlight of the entire experience. It was extremely smooth and still had the richness and boldness of a proper espresso and, of course, served with a small square of dark chocolate.Conclusion:All in all, this reminds me of my greatest complaint of New York restaurants; too many of them are able to simply ride on their laurels instead of relying on a solid menu with quality to sustain their business. Our experience at Le Bilbouquet left us confused as to what the restaurant is striving for as far as pricing, clientele, service, and menu.I do understand that Le Bilbouquet has not been open very long at this location and may have opening kinks, but if other's first experiences are like ours, it will only have ever been new."], ["C W.", "If you're hankering for a Francophile fix (or a Midtown Manhattan jones, for that matter) this is it. \u00a0Le Poulet Cajun, mussels and steak tartare are standouts. \u00a0Classic bistro fare executed flawlessly."]], "Addison Caf\u00e9": [], "Parigi Restaurant": [["Philip C.", "Top freakin notch restaurant. \u00a0Food is always fresh and delicious. \u00a0I think food took some time to come out but you can watch them in a very open style kitchen, preparing and decorating your dishes. \u00a0 I saw who I assumed was the head chef / owner? coming out and making her rounds talking to a lot of regulars at the restaurant. \u00a0This place is very popular.

Parigi (which is actually the Italian word for Paris) says it models itself on the \"bistros ofParis,with a New York feel\" HUH?I didn't really get the feel of either of these locations from the decor (or the food) and thought Parigi would be better homing in more on its farm friendly side.Hubby got theRoasted Acorn Squash stuffed withquinoa, peas,carrots, parsnips,spinich and Asiago cheese for $12Presentation was stunning and it was true fall comfort food stuffed full of veggies and cheese!

When my party of seven and I sat down, the waitress immediately asked all of us what we wanted to order for cocktails. There was only one menu on the table and she appeared irritated that nobody knew yet what they wanted. Finally, she brought over extra menus and took our drink order with a sour attitude. I ordered a glass of Guigal's C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne. I was impressed. It was a lovely soft earthy wine that was kind of seductive. As I was enjoying my seductive wine, a lady with Chardonnay breathe from another table made it a point to carve out a spot right next to me and chat for fifteen minutes about why gun control is wrong.

For appetizers, I tried their deviled eggs. It was nothing extra ordinary. If deviled eggs are going to be on the menu, I think they must have a \"kick\". It would be a good idea for them to add a unique spice or sauce... just to jazz- it-up some. For my main meal, I ordered the heart healthy acorn squash stuffed with quinoa, peas, carrots, spinach, and asiago cheese. It was savory.

So when someone mentioned Parigi as possible brunch showdown location I was a little concerned as, not only had I never been there, I'D NEVER EVEN HEARD OF IT. Whatever. I wasn't going to let that stop me. So I lied. \u00a0I pretended that not only had I heard of it, I'd been there several times and that the food was real solid and then asked how come they'd never been there and ended it with a resounding \"OMG, we HAVE to go if you've never tried it\".I instantly became OP. \u00a0Was I going to be the OP that delivered...or was I going to be a F...not deliver. Well, long story short, not only did I deliver I blew the doors right off the safe and showed everyone what was inside and it was everything you thought it would be and way, way more and then it was like on top of that I gave everyone cats. \u00a0Thanks for being awesome Parigi it would have really hurt my street rep if you sucked. \u00a0I just had an awesome Bday brunch here and I've just got to say this place really left an impression. \u00a0We're not the easiest group to handle and our size was almost half the restaurant and we will drink all the champagne you have and then bang our fists on the table until you call the cops. So, I was initially a little concerned and well, quite frankly, that was stupid. \u00a0Before I even got in the door of this place I was blown away to their attention to detail and just how much they genuinely cared about my experience. \u00a0The food was crazy good in an authentic, delicious, unique kind of way that made all the options really cool. Not only was every plate immaculate the service was AMAZING and they really made brunch the best part of my day. Nothing else had a chance. \u00a0So thank you. \u00a0Here have some of these internet stars and a few kind words no one will read.TL;DR - Parigi. \u00a0Food was great. \u00a0Service was great. \u00a0I had a great time.

Two friends and myself went after a wonderful wine/cheese tasting for dinner. We strolled in at approx 9:05 and the man said he had to check to see if the kitchen was still open? According to their hours (10:00pm) I found this surprising. So, I sit down at the lovely table in this obviously semi-snob based atmosphere to browse the menu. Then realize I need to use the ladies room. I stand to find it and am immediately met with someone \"Do you need something?\" .... yes, the restroom room? Do you have one of those here? \"We have two of them\" I respond \"Wow, you all sure know how to splurge around here...\" it wasn't a demure \"can I help you question\" it was more like a \"what are you doing out of your seat\" comment... Pesto was a bit watery but the risotto scored with my friends and the gnocchi scored \u00a0points with me. I also liked the champagne as well. The flavor of the spicy red sauce alone was worth the 4 stars from me... however, the caesar was a disappointment. \u00a0Voted best of D?

His shift was ending which he apologized for and handed us off to another waiter who was not as attentive. We had to pour our own wine refills even though he passed the table with empty wine glasses on it. We had to ask twice for the check. The food is ok; probably better but the lack of attentiveness did not help the taste. The problem with this restaurant is that the kitchen opens into the dining area. The wait staff congregates there and at the bar spending too much time socializing with the other employees leaving the customers to fend for themselves too often"], ["Jennifer S.", "I love this neighborhood gem of a restaurant...it is hidden and completely unassuming, but good quality food in a great atmosphere. \u00a0The wine selection is excellent and reasonably priced, the service is top notch and the food is flavorful and well presented. \u00a0Our group started with the brussel sprout salad (yum!) and then we had the beef stroganoff, the oven roasted chicken with thai coconut sauce and the sea scallops - everything was flavorful and downright delicious!"], ["Doug P.", "Had lunch at parigi the other day and I was blown away.

Their chocolate glob dessert topped with vanilla ice cream is something to dream about!"], ["Natalie V.", "I suggested to my party of six that we try Parigi for Sunday brunch as it came highly recommended from a good friend. Unfortunately, it simply didn't deliver and we all left completely underwhelmed. First, when we arrived as it opened at 10:30, we were told we could be seated without a reservation only if we were out of the table by noon. Um, ok? The place was essentially empty but if that's how we're welcomed into your fine establishment, alright. Frankly, none of our three couples wanted to drive elsewhere and we figured we could probably swing a 1.5 hour brunch. \u00a0After we were seated we were confused because half of the party had different versions of the menu than our counterparts. Completely different dishes. \u00a0We asked about this and were immediately told, oh, that's our old menu, you shouldn't have received that. Yet, we weren't offered current menus. \u00a0Instead, our waitress grabbed the hostess who confirmed some of the dishes were no longer available, but told us the chef could probably make the dish if we wanted. Ok? So, I opted for the chicken and waffles from the current menu. I figured it was simple enough and about time I finally tried this highly regarded chicken and waffle pairing. Two of my friends inquire about the chef's omelette and market price and are told it's $13. It wasn't until right before our food came out that the waitress informed them that it was actually $16.50. Honestly, this wasn't a huge deal, it's not like this was going to break the bank. But, it's a matter of principle. Your staff should know your prices and technically it was over 25% more expensive than you said it was. Fast forward, our food comes out, and I end up with just a single waffle. No chicken. The server doesn't even bother to mention that I've received an incomplete order. Fortunately, our waitress noticed and notified the kitchen. I coerce all of my friends to go ahead and eat since they were politely waiting for the rest of my dish. Eventually, the waitress brings two chicken tenders on a small plate and apologizes for the error. Cool, great! All is well in our world. I cut into the chicken, take a bite, look down and notice the center is completely raw. I cut into the second tender. Same story. We call the waitress over. She picks up the plate, says, that's odd and nothing else and walks away with my undercooked chicken. \u00a0Ten minutes later, as everyone else is finishing up their meals, I receive two new chicken tenders. No apologies. No offer to comp the dish for sending it out incomplete and then serving chicken raw. It was crazy and totally unexpected from what I gathered was an upscale restaurant. And, after it was all said and done, I really didn't enjoy the dish. The waffle was ordinary. I didn't like the side of honey syrup (this may just be me b/c I don't like honey that much) and the chicken tenders, when cooked properly, were relatively bland. I really wanted to like this place and am giving it two stars because though she wasn't very friendly, our waitress was at least attentive. And, my friends said their meals were fine. \u00a0Again, they weren't raving about how delicious they were, but they weren't bad. \u00a0For that, it gets two stars. Sadly, as young professionals who enjoy fine dining, I can't imagine any of us will be back with so many other great restaurants in DFW."]], "La Madeleine French Bakery & Cafe": [], "The Old Warsaw Restaurant": [["Steven J.", "I was a little nervous after my grandma picked this restaurant for her 80th birthday and I read the reviews. The place isn't as bad as some of the reviews say, but the restaurant is definitely a mixed bag. When we first got there, no one took our drink order for about 10 minutes. We thought it was pretty unusual for a place where the waiters wear tuxedos to fail at this basic task. But, once they took our drink order, the service was decent from then on. The food and menu is very traditional and expensive, but it had a good amount of flavor. The escargot was pretty great and my steak/lobster was tasty. However, myself and several other people ordered mac and cheese as a side, but they gave us all mashed potatoes with no explanation. That was pretty disappointing, but I didn't press the issue. As a 20 something, this place is a little too stuffy and fancy for a date at my age. But, it was a decent place for this type of occasion."], ["Ivy J.", "Okay I'll help the Old Warsaw out a bit since the reviews are horrible lol. I've noticed that most that are unhappy came during a holiday & ate from a special menu (which apparently isn't too great).I've been here twice with my mom on a Groupon, once for lunch (which I think they no longer offer) & today for dinner. We had extremely pleasant service both times & thoroughly enjoyed our meal both times. Over both visits I've tried their crab cakes, red snapper, ribeye, salmon, scallops, Apple pie & carrot cake & I loved ALL of it! They even ended the night by giving us red roses. The biggest drawback is the price. Even with the Groupon covering $60 of the meal, we still ended up spending over $100 which included tax, overage & tip. Although the food was awesome I have found comparable food for lower prices elsewhere. I don't think they should be in the same $ range as Nick & Sams & they are. The first time we came there was only one other party & the second time 2 parties came after us. As empty as they always are & as horrible as the reviews are I don't see them staying open much longer. It was so bad the waiters were sitting in the back room on their cell phones... bored. In closing I would only return with a good Groupon or cheaper prices. Food & service was great!"], ["Kasey B.", "I ate here several years ago and enjoyed it so much!

And boy did they pack us in like sardines - tables literally touching each other!Now for the worst part, the food. The change in ownership must have made some more changes. The filet was just so-so, not to mention not cooked-to-order. The ceasar dressing was very bland. Bread was no better. They still use fixed menus, which in and of itself isn't a bad thing. But the place as a whol ehas just lost that certain panache it used to have. I won't be going back, especially not with a Capital Grille jsut across the street!"], ["Joseph M.", "I will start this review with the bill, and you can determine for yourself if it was worth it : $302.53 for dinner for 3. I drove up in my car, and the valet was nowhere in sight. After I nearly park my own car, the first sight as I enter the dated, melancholy interior, is a gigantic, dirty fish tank. Inside the 8 foot tank is a depressed electric eel and a 4 foot shark, both too crammed to move. If you listen closely, you can hear the two of them hoping and begging that the eel's current will be enough to kill them both to take them out of their misery. Then, I have to stand by the front desk, unattended, for a full five minutes before anyone notices us. After we are seated, rather haphazardly, I realize the palpaple air of sadness. I looked around, and I was sure that at least 4 of the five couples around me were planning divorces, due in no small part to the depressing atmosphere. The other part that troubled me about the couples was their blatant disregard for the dress code. I was in a suit, the waiters were in tuxedos, and the rest of them were in short sheeve buttonups and jeans. I almost walked out of the place when a whole family walked in the funeral-home like establishment dressed in tshirts and shorts. Clearly this was the place to be!.....when Eisenhower was president. Now that you have a feeling for the decor and atmosphere, I'll discuss the food. I ordered off of one of their fixed menus, and started with the \"salmon tartare.\" I am relatively certain that what I was served was a can of \"salmon fancy feast\" cat food on two shreds of lettuce. Course two was beef Wellington, to which I was completely ambivalent. Not as bad as the the tartare, but clearly not worth the $50. Course three was a NY cheesecake, with the consistency of chewing gum. My table ordered three drinks in total, a martini and two vodka tonics, so you can imagine our surprise when the drinks totaled to $60 on the bill! Thank God we caught it and complained, because they certainly weren't very understanding when we complained. My overall impression of the place is that it is not worth the money you pay for it. To sum it up in one notion, it is like when you bring the rest of your family to your favorite restaurant as a child, only to discover it a much sadder, darker, colder place than before, something that you wished you left in your memory."], ["Jeremiah R.", "I have to admit; I was worried because they officially have the worst billboard ads; They went from using camera phone photos of generic Dallas blondes hugging fat guys, to grabbing google images of \u00a0foreign starlettes that couldn't have approved their image to be used (In Feb 2014 they had \u00a0Aishwarya Rai Bachchan; so either they are the luckiest little place in Dallas or they need too figure out better promotion...

Without reservations, the warsaw was \u00a0able to seat us around 9:30pm. We were starved by then. For a valentines day, 3 course dinner, at the 11th hour it was reasonably priced.

Next we will go through the courses1) AntipastiI had the smoked salmon. Hit the spot. It could have used some dill and lemon. My wife had a tomato and mozzarella salad that looked kind of sad and messy. Glad I didn't order it; otherwise it would have ruined 1/3rd of my meal. She didn't finish it if I recall; but doesn't care for smoked salmon. 2) EntreeI had the steak, with wild mushrooms Loved it. Steakhouses have \u00a0a habit of over-salting everything; not here. \u00a0I will admit that I ordered it medium rare. One half of the steak was cooked perfectey; the other half was too bloody so asked them to cook it more. They took care of me and I finished everything. My wife had the salmon; and she says that it was good. It must have been, because I didn't get to try any. 3) DesertI had the carrot cake, she had the german chocolate. It was good; but I didn't get to finish it because my wife reminded me that she doesn't need more of me to love to love me more ;) I can't say that the Warsaw will be in regular rotation; but as an occasional intimate steak dinner it is actually enjoyable."], ["Arlene F.", "Booked a reservation through open table for Saturday night 8/9/14 at 7:15 to celebrate my sister in laws birthday. \u00a0She was visiting from Florida. \u00a0My husband and I had told her about the unique dinning experience. \u00a0We should have known something was wrong when we first arrived. \u00a0 The ma\u00eetre d was challenged to find a table yet the entire main room was empty. \u00a0 After 30 minutes a large group filed in and totally disrupted the entire atmosphere. \u00a0Then the service at our table and the others near us went down hill fast due to the 120 size private group.

We eat out a lot and have good to bad service, but this place broke the record for worse service ever. First of all they try to pass themselves off as a high end restaurant. More like frozen food heated by mexicans in the back.First of all, get there and are greeted nicely by the coat check girl, who promptly took our coats. We then talked to the Maitre' D who asked us for our reservation and we gave him our name and he stares at his monitor without saying a word to us for at least 3 minutes. Then suddenly he starts talking to the group who came in behind us all the while ignoring us. He directs them to their party by going around the corner and showing them their seat. 5 minutes later he comes back and never looking at us or paying attention. Then out of the blue he waves his hand at us and says, \"come here!\"We get a table that looks like they were arrange for maximum occupancy not comfort. We sat in a center row table that was arranged in two rows almost 2 feet from the table in front and back of us. The whole time we were there, we sat and stared at someones backs, because the seats were arrange on one side of the table next to each other so each table behind stared at the too close for comfort backs of the people in front. We order New Years Eve special which was the only option that evening. We waited about 20 minutes for the waiter who didn't get any bread or water, was handed a special holiday menu. We looked at the menu and decided on appetizers so waited, waited and waited then had to call one of the staff and told him to find our waiter.When the waiter got there, he told us we were not allowed to order just appetizers, but we had to decide on everything at once. We were confused but decided on the rest of our menu and had to wait another 20 minutes for the waiter who never showed so we had to flag another staff member to tell them we were ready.We order Lobster Bisque and Avocado Lump Crab meat as appetizers. First the lobster bisque was brown and you couldn't taste any lobster. Also it looked like they added curry powder so all you tasted was the slight watered down flavor of spicy curry. The lump crab meat tasted like it was out of a can. No seasoning or marinade so all you could taste was this bland crab meat that had the texture of crab meat but no flavor. For our entrees, we order the 22oz bone in rib eye and 14 oz lobster. Rib eye was order well done. When it arrived it had the biggest piece of bone I had ever seen. \u00a0 On one end the bone diameter was literally 1.5-2 inches and the bone was at least 6 inches long. I think the bone itself was 15oz. The other half was the meat. The outer edges which are usually marbleized so you get some fat was about 1 inch of fat with a small sliver of meat. When we cut this part out, we noticed there wasn't a lot of meat left but what was there, was rare meat, bleeding red. We mentioned we ordered the steak well done to the waiter who called the manager. Manager comes over and immediately starts to accuse us of \u00a0eating most of the steak. \u00a0I mentioned the point is we order a steak well done not rare in the middle with fat around the sides. He continued to argue. So we just dropped it and wanted to just get out. The lobster was a fair size, but I swear this restaurant uses everything frozen and bought from Walmart. The lobster had no flavor as if it was sitting in a freezer for weeks before finally being served. We were so tired of waiting as we have been in the restaurant for over 1.5 hrs now so we didn't finish our entrees and we were ready to leave so we asked if the desserts could be packaged to go. The waiter refused or mumbled something so I though he meant it was coming right out so we decided to wait. Another 20 minutes later our dessert comes out. we order Chocolate Mousse Cake and Apple Pie with ice cream. The mousse cake tasted like something from Walmart store bought. It was the first mousse cake that was not smooth and soft but hard. The apple pie looked like it was a boxed package pre sliced, and they threw it in the microwave because a part of it was warm and the rest was cold as ice. Needless to say we didn't bother finishing, we asked for our checks paid and left.

I didn't eat even 1/6 of the food on my plate, I let the waiter know that I wanted my food to go, he took it to the kitchen and packed it. When I got home and looked at my food they had only packed the meat portion and none of my meat toppings, sauce, or sides. I paid $60 for my dinner and was treated horribly at the restaurant. Then they stole my food when they said they were packing it to go for me. I called and spoke to the manager letting him know what happened. He called me back the next day and said they would be refunding $20 of my $160 check since they neglected to pack more than half of my dinner plate. I thanked him and thought it was over.

To be honest, I was pretty apprehensive because I had heard way more negative than positive things about The Old Warsaw. First of all, the service feels European, which is a huge plus for me. Sure it takes longer to get your drinks and food, and you'll have to ask for the check. But I personally enjoy not having a waiter interrupting the conversation every 5 minutes to \"check on us\". I thought that the menu had a decent variety of steaks and seafood. You can order a la carte or choose from 2 prix fixe menus. The food was impressive, but I don't think I'll find myself craving anything I had. I started with the lobster bisque. It had a bit of a kick to it, and was not as creamy as most bisques. My entree was steak Diane and a lobster tail. Both tasted great! Now that I've had some time to think about it, that was the most tender steak I've ever had. The chocolate souffl\u00e9 was huge and pretty mediocre, something tasted off about it. My parents really enjoyed the raspberry souffl\u00e9, though. I have heard people say that the decor is extremely outdated and I agree. There is also a noticeable musty smell when you first walk in. I'm pretty sure that my boyfriend and I were by far the youngest people in there, and we're both 25. Some younger-looking people eventually trickled in later in the evening, but this is definitely a much older crowd than expected for the Uptown area.

There are other French restaurants in town, there are other bistros in town, and there are probably other restaurants in town that have nifty yellow awnings, but there is only one Lavendou. And it is absolutely an essential dining destination in the DFW area.Everything about Lavendou is warm and inviting. Here is a quaint French bistro in a strip mall not too far removed from the highway, yet it feels like you may have stumbled into someone's dining room off an alley in Nice. Put it this way: every time I have eaten here, I immediately forget there is a sports bar, a Christmas store, a sushi restaurant and a condom store that's bigger than every other business in this shopping center, all within the immediate vicinity. The yellow awnings stand out apart from everything else, and surround an enclosed patio that can get pretty packed during the summer nights.A couple doors separate you from the outside, but once you cross that threshold, you are in a place that just feels natural: it's not forced, it's not cold and it's not overwhelming. The hostesses, who are always welcoming and always on top of their fashion (where can I get red loafers?), greet you right away, and are quick to meet just about any requests you have: obviously, it's tough to request a table in the crowded secondary dining room, but the front desk staff, as well as the owner, will do everything they can to accommodate you before sitting down. The owner, especially, is a friendly guy, dressed to impress and quick to talk to every table in the dining rooms.The restaurant is a picture of comfort. Warm yellows, pleasant lighting and home decor like plates, lamps and other items you might see in Grandma's living room are all around. The front dining room can be chilly depending on how much the entrance door is open, and the back dining room can be dark and quiet, but the middle dining room would make Goldilocks proud because it is just right. TV can be found in the small bar immediately to the right when entering, but otherwise, this is an intimate, quiet and easy-going dining experience, all overlooked by a team of professionals.From the bussers to the waiters, everyone here is exceptional at their job. Your drinks will never need a refill, which is great since that lavender tea is incredible. And the waiters are all outstanding, from greeting you to recommending dishes, regaling tales of life in France to letting their senses of humor out if you allow them. It may be crass to recommend a server here, but far and away, Bernie and Pierre are the star servers. Both keep the dining experience paced, both know wines like the back of their hands and both have been gracious to field any requests we may have had: a special shout out must be given to Pierre, for one night waiting on our party that started out as a reservation of four, and almost doubled to an unannounced party of seven, as well as for another night when he re-ran our tab to take advantage of a discount we had neglected to claim initially. His ease and friendliness with his guests is, like everyone else here, completely natural and welcoming.But what about the food? Friends, you know the food is the best in town. Escargot is a staple appetizer, but frog's legs and bone marrow show up on occasion for specials. And all three are essential. Lobster bisque and French onion soup are a must, no matter how full you may be. And the entrees... The duck is an acclaimed house specialty, the lemon sole is melt-in-your-mouth delicious, the ribeye is my go-to choice because it's phenomenal, and the list goes on and on. Desserts are in a class of their own, with the souffl\u00e9s being the show stoppers. But apricot tarts, profiteroles and a really savory vanilla-pear concoction (trust me, it's good) all ensure your taste buds will feel satisfied as you finish up your meal.I could go on and on about how amazing Lavendou is in every facet of their operations but writing about it just makes me want to go out and eat there (despite the fact they're not even open at the time of this review). The staff is outstanding, the food is even better and the atmosphere wraps it all up in an inviting experience, whether it is your first time or your fiftieth. Look for those yellow awnings: you cannot go wrong once you step under them."], ["Vanessa C.", "Serving the lighter fare of Southern France, Lavendou offers many items to tempt your taste buds. One of their star dish is the Canard R\u00f4ti au Cassis, roasted duck with cassis sauce served with wild rice. The duck is so tender and flavorful, the meat can just fall off the bone. The wild rice infused with an orange citrus zest was the best I've had yet to try.If duck, frog \u00a0and salmon are not your forte, I would recommend the Tournedos F\u00e9lix Faure, tenderloin with cracked black pepper, mushrooms dressed in a cognac cream sauce served with pommes frites (french fries). My mouth is watering just thinking about it."], ["Jasmine T.", "I went to this place on Restaurant Week last Friday because I've always been partial to French cuisine/bistro. \u00a0What made me gave this place three stars is that as much as I really wanted to love this place, it could be because I'm not really into the provencale flavor. \u00a0 For ambiance alone and the effort of good service I'd give it a 5. \u00a0 Or maybe if I had what my boyfriend had, I'd probably give it a 4 star. \u00a0I got the arugula salad with the cherry tomato tartines as my appetizer while my boyfriend got the clam chowder. \u00a0The clam chowder beat my salad. \u00a0For entree, I got the chicken with the creamy sauce with wide noodles, while my boyfriend got the steak tenderloin with frites. \u00a0His choice entree beat my chicken, so strike 2. \u00a0The only thing that is tied in my book was the dessert. \u00a0I got chocolate mousse while he got the berries and cream. \u00a0The experience overrall wasn't that bad, but I\"ll probably come back in another many eons from now."], ["Stephanie S.", "I had to take away 2 stars for the dreadful service by our waitstaff, Robert. He was despicable! I had a birthday tea party for me and 18 other ladies. Everyone complained of his rude and dry demeanor. Several times we couldn't even find him! On a good note the high tea was delightful! The sandwiches were tasty, the pastries were warm, and the place settings were too cute! I would love to go back for high tea but need to make sure Robert is NOT working that day."], ["Chelsea G.", "WORST SERVICE EVER. My fianc\u00e9 and I decided to treat ourselves to a special dinner after we had both had extremely difficult work weeks. We went with a restaurant.com gift card we had been given, and immediately upon showing the gift card, were treated as if we were low life peasants that had no right to be there. We did not order the wine, as we both were tired and opted out of dessert. From that point out, they carried on lovely conversations with everyone around us but refused to even send a smile our way. Apparently, two young people are not worth their time and our bill wasn't high enough to merit good customer service.On top of that, the lobster bisque tasted like lukewarm leftover tomato soup. I would venture to say almost any restaurant I have been to around the world has better lobster bisque. Then, my subpar, over cooked, heavily sauced salmon was presented. Mediocre at best. My compliments to the chef at making a meal that my mother could outdo in approximately 10 minutes. My fiance's New York strip steak lacked flavor and was drowned in a sauce to mask the fact that it had been overlooked and tasted like rubber. So. If you want a real double whammy of RUDE service and overpriced, distasteful food, then this is your place. If you like to enjoy your meal and feel as if you are welcome in the restaurant and would like to be treated with respect, then you should literally go ANYWHERE else in DFW. There are quite a few fabulous restaurants that I will gladly refer you to. Oh, there is a saving grace. The bread is great. But don't order too much of that either or they'll look at you like a pauper trying to fill up on the free bread."], ["Leila H.", "So disappointed by the food. I had really high hopes after reading all the reviews on yelp but really couldn't be more disappointed. We started with a soup, hubby had the lobster bisque and I had the French onion. The bisque was cold and didn't even taste like lobster, the onion soup was basic. Then we had the duck with cassis sauce... Dry dry dry, didn't taste good, the wild rice was awful. Finally we ended with the souffl\u00e9, again, it was wet and very eggy. I'm really confused by the reviews."], ["Christy P.", "We were hesitant to try this restaurant because of some of the other reviews, however I'm really glad we did! The food was tasty, the ambience was cozy, and we found the waitstaff attentive and professional.I had their soup of the day, asparagus, and escargot. Both were delicious. My husband had lobster bisque, and pork tenderloin, both of which he enjoyed."], ["NorthDallas G.", "We've been several times and it's always been great food and service. \u00a0Only once we had an issue, but otherwise very nice. \u00a0 French food and a bit of the french attitude. \u00a0At least they make the effort to please, unlike so many other french places. \u00a0selection is excellent and quality is exceptional. \u00a0Great date night. \u00a0Not so great for kids.The one and only issue we ever had was while sitting at the bar, the bartender decided that there was just about a half a glass' worth of wine left in the bottle (and I believe it was the last of that one, since it was a one-time special wine), and he took the liberty and went ahead and poured it our glasses, without asking. \u00a0 He even commented something like \"well, that's not enough to sell\" or something like that. \u00a0 However, when the bill came, we were charged the full price. \u00a0On other nights, the same bartender has been friendly and good service, so we just paid it went on our way. \u00a0 Had this been my first trip to the restaurant I would have been more annoyed. \u00a0 Still, an excellent place for food and drink."], ["Jen W.", "Lavendou is really great!Love the French countryside atmosphere, and the food was delicious and quite authentic.My hubby and I split their Escargot, which was very well done. \u00a0I'd definitely order this again. \u00a0I also started with their Goat Cheese, Parma Ham and Pine Nuts salad, which was yummy as well.For dinner, I had their New York Strip with Pomme Frites, which was good, but nothing I haven't had before. \u00a0However, my hubby had their Veal Medallions, and we both agreed it's among the best we've had-next time I would definitely order this entree.No dessert for us, but the wine list was plentiful, with great options at all different price points.We're excited to return to Lavendou, and certainly will sometime soon."], ["A T.", "Love their French ambience! We ordered escargots for appetizer. Roasted duck with cranberry sauce is the bomb, rack of lamb is just above the average I think. I don't think they made good chocolate souffl\u00e9 on that day."], ["Cindy D.", "So, I brought my mom here for dinner on Saturday for her birthday, since she has been wanting to try some local french food for a while, and although I was expecting the food to be amazing, according to reviews here and on google, I have to say that the food was a bit of a let down. We started off with the Napol\u00e9on de Champignons Sauvages, and the \"pastry\", which was really a croissant, was delicious; however, the mushrooms and sauce were extremely salty when eaten without the pastry and they were a bit overwhelming after a few bites. We then proceeded to our main course. My mom ordered the Filet de Saumon Grill\u00e9, the salmon and sauce were cooked perfectly, as well as the eggplant caviar. It was actually good, but nothing out of the ordinary, she then regretted not having ordered the duck, as she had originally planned. I ordered the Gambas et CoquillesSt. Jacques en Mille Feuilles, a recommendation by our waiter. Again, nothing out of this world and VERY salty. Apparently that is a pattern here. After our main course, we proceeded to have dessert. Again, I went ahead and ordered the waiter's recommendation, Souffl\u00e9 au Grand Marnier. I was very disappointed with the strong egg flavor it had. I feel they should have cut it down with a bit more cooking or at least add some more liquor to hide the egg flavor a bit better. Although food was not all that bad, I gotta say, service is lacking. Every one is this restaurant was very rude! First, the hostess did not even say hello to us, she asked if we had a reservation, which we did not, and even though the restaurant was empty, she made a huge grin before sitting us down. We asked our server if he could take a picture of us, and his answer was this, exact words, \"uff, well, I am really busy, this is not a good time for you to ask me for this, but I guess I will do it.\" RUDE! Then, to top it all off, even the buss lady was rude, since we requested water with no ice. With that being said, I will most likely not return here or recommend this place to anyone in my circle."], ["Thomas C.", "This is my go to place for dates or just by myself when I wanna get away from women. I came here years ago randomly because I was hunkering for a nice damn steak. I ordered an appetizer, forgot what it was but it was good enough for me to finish the plate like a death row inmate.

The Lobster bisque had a strong fish taste to me, I did not find that pleasant both times I have had it. Their main courses, which include duck, New York steak and tenderloins; were also okay. I liked the duck (Canard R\u00f4ti au Cassis) because it was sweet in taste, but some may not enjoy that. The tenderloins (Tournedos F\u00e9lix Faure) were truly tender with a hint of mushroom, recommended.

The atmosphere is very country french... lots of yellows and blues, lots of homey sort of decorations. It's not super fancy, so you can go in a dress or not. I can say it's definitely not a \"scene\". The average age of people in there will probably be 15 years older than you are. But if you have good company, forget granny at the table next to you. Go on, have fun! Have a glass of champagne at the bar before you are seated. Order that second bottle of wine. Have that digestif! :)There's a great wine list, lots of french options (of course!)... btu the menu is where it's at. I really haven't had a dish I didn't like. The fois gras is amazing (it's a bit rich and a bit too much for two, really, but get it anyway). The Gambas et Coquilles St. Jacques en Mille Feuilles (Shrimp, Scallops, Spinach and Mushrooms with a Cream Sauce in a Pastry Shell) is to die for.

I've looking for a French bistro since that was one of my favorite places to go to with my fiance in Los Angeles. So, I was assigned to find a restaurant on the list of Restaurant Week because two of our friends from Los Angeles were in town for a trade show. First impression was...what a cute place! I love how cozy it was. Even before getting our first dish, the hostess asked us to \"keep it down.\" And to be honest, we weren't even that loud (we've been louder...trust me). We were just laughing and having a good time, We weren't even being obnoxious (we didn't even have enough drinks to be so and after that incident, we definitely didn't want to spend more money on alcohol). That really dampened our mood for the rest of our meal and I was disappointed and embarrassed that I was the one who picked out the restaurant!! The food was pretty good. The service (aside from our friendly hostess) was good. I won't take that away from our friendly waiter. Tip for the restaurant: if you plan on participating in Restaurant Week, put a note that you don't want big parties there. And if a large party is really quiet, check on them....chances are they are not having a good experience. Be worried. Tip for customers: go with a small party.

It had simple and clean flavors which is what I love anyway. The basil white wine sauce was drool worthy as well. Every side was perfect too. We had the chocolate dessert which was delish too.

Just drive down Preston until you see the giant arrow sign shaped billboard pointing you towards the Condom Sense shop across the street. Now drive around that shopping center and you'll see the French restaurant. I guess in a way it makes sense. Isn't Paris the city of romance or something like that?The exterior is unremarkable, but the inside was pretty well decorated. It definitely had a French theme going. White tablecloths, some fake flowers on the tables, a giant wall with all sorts of China on display. It has the whole moody dim lighting thing going on. The waiters are very polite. Most of the people eating here are kind of old.As far as the quantity of food goes, expect to pay double. The quality is somewhat better, although this is debatable. I think it's about on par with what you'd find at La Madeleine's. It only seems better because the nice interior is tricking your mind into thinking the food is exceptional, when it's merely somewhat above average. The baguettes at the beginning were tasty. Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. They really need to clean the plates better. You could see all sorts of grease smears all over them if you angled them just right in the light. It didn't stop me from downing two bowls of their baguettes on them though.Honestly I think you can just go get yourself some food from La Madeleine's, bring it home, dim the lights and it'll be the same quality at a lower cost."], ["Diane L.", "We had an amazing experience here; the food was excellent and the waiter very knowledgeable and friendly. \u00a0I've been told you can't go wrong with anything on the menu, and I have to say that this is most likely true.We started with the wild mushroom pastry and the escargots; the pastry was perfectly flaky and topped the most fantastic mushroom sauce I've had in a while. \u00a0The escargots were tender and served in a garlic butter that was perfectly mopped up by fresh warm baguettes. \u00a0The duck was amazing; I couldn't finish it and ended up taking it home for lunch the next day. \u00a0Even reheated in a microwave, the balance of flavors and texture remained. \u00a0The rack of lamb was delicious; make sure to order it rare.For a nice ending, the Grand Marnier souffle served with fresh whipped cream was a heavenly dessert to finish with, as well as being just the right size for two people."], ["Stan L.", "we came here for restaurant \"week\" recently... service was very spotty.. maybe because the place was completely packed.. we ordered our food before our water was filled.. and we had our appetizers before our bottle of wine arrived.. nevertheless.. the food we had was quite good.. my wife enjoyed her snails.. my salad was decent too.. as for our mains.. we both had the chateaubriand which was cooked to a perfect medium rare.. the pommes frites were perfect.. for dessert.. i had the apple tart which was excellent.. my wife's chocolate fondant was very rich but not overly sweet.. we would gladly come back here again. hopefuly the service improves.."], ["Frisco M.", "Wow!!

However, I was a little late in making our restaurant week reservations, and Lavendou still had seats. It's in a somewhat shady shopping center way up on north on Preston, but on entering, you're transported the south of France. It's one room with fairly high ceilings, decorated with bright, airy colors. We were there for the $35 prix fixe menu, but they gave us the regular menu to peruse. Their regular menu is quite impressive, and I found myself wanting to try not a few things. But entr\u00e9es are generally around $30, and while I liked the aesthetic, the environment doesn't quite fit this price range. I can see why a few people are complaining about the price, even if it is somewhat sophisticated French food. I started with the mixed green salad with pine nuts and toasted goat cheese. I prefer more leafy lettuce in my salad, but the goat cheese made it remarkable. For my entr\u00e9e I had the pork chop with vegetables. \u00a0 The pork chop was cooked well, and it was topped with a wonderful sauce. I also appreciated the relatively small portion size, which kept me from over-eating and crossing that line into gluttony.

Slight muskiness helps to bright deep flavour of the black tea.Bread was delectably chewy and hot, whereas butter was chilled. Duck Terrine was luscious. The serving was quite generous. It was not gamy. Pacific Snapper Nicoise is excellent. The sauce (reduction) of white wine, olives, tomatoes, and basil was proper melange of sweetness, saltiness and acidity that cut through rich buttery taste of snapper. Mashed potatoes were divine.

When you imagine a romantic candlelit dinner, this is what you're thinking of. I appreciated the dress code (men must wear jackets). Many of the nice restaurants in DFW allow jeans which bothers me because there's generally not a distinction between \"nice\" jeans and \"running errands\" jeans. It really affects the feel of a place to see everyone dressed well. Food: I loved all of my three courses. I had:White asparagus with poached salmon and caviar- expertly prepared, complimentary flavors and textures. A passion fruit sorbet was served as a palette cleanser which was unexpected but very nice. It felt very old world and charming.Roasted pheasant breast with foie gras- as other reviewers have said, the foie gras knocks it out of the park. It was the highlight of the dish, since the pheasant was a little on the dry and tough side.Hazelnut chocolate Kit Kat torte- to die for. It was served with a bit of frangelico ice cream and was possibly the best dessert I've ever had. My fianc\u00e9e had:Diver's scallop- \"nice but nothing overly special\"Beef tenderloin- \"the server way oversold it. It's good but not 'the best I'll ever have until I come again'. Probably not even in the top 20.\" I tasted it and thought it was very good, but I have to agree that I've had better. If it had been served without comment, I think it would have been better.Raspberry mousse- \"I actually really like this.\" He's not a dessert person and this is a big compliment to the pastry chef. He ate every bit of it.The wine list is decent. There are some exceptional vintages but of course are very pricey. There were several options in the $120-$200 range and a few under $100. We were a little disappointed at the Cabernet offerings, with vintages being either rather young (in the $120-$200 range) or very expensive. A little more middle ground would have been nice. We had a 2009 Jordan and felt that the price was fair.Okay, so, the service is where things are lacking.First of all, I had booked a room at the hotel months in advance. After booking the room, I decided to go ahead and book the dinner reservation since I figured they would go quickly for that night. I called the first time in November and was told to call back after Thanksgiving. I called the day after, and they said to call closer to Christmas. I called the week before, and they said to call after Christmas. I called on the 26th, and they said to call after the new year. I called on January 3 and asked for a reservation around 7:00 or 7:30 and was offered 5:15 or 8:30, everything in between was booked. 8:30 was fine, but it was aggravating that my reservation couldn't have been taken any of the previous times I called. We were taken care of by our waiter, a server, and the sommelier. Waiter- he was friendly and shared some information about the hotel and restaurant. The first time he said I was beautiful, it was sweet but I figured he said that to all the ladies. The second time, I figured he must really think I'm pretty. By the fourth time, my fianc\u00e9e was understandably annoyed and I was a little uncomfortable.Server- seemed very nervous and jumpy, and a little robotic. We couldn't help but hear him say the same things to every table (like the beef tenderloin comment he made \"It's the best you'll ever have, until you come back!\", or when serving deserts \"...and of course there are zero calories!\"). I'm guessing he was new, but someone there really needs to help him relax and give him a hand. Sommelier- we ordered a Cabernet and he took the red wine glasses off the table and served it in the white wine glasses. We looked around and it seemed there was no rhyme or reason to who had white or red glasses. My husband's wine glass was empty twice. The first time, it took about 10 minutes for someone to notice and pour more. The second time, after 10 minutes, I filled it.I had sparkling water, he had still. When they brought him a second bottle of water, they brought him sparkling. After our first course was served, we thought it odd that they had bread plates and butter knives but didn't seem to be serving bread. Halfway into our course, the bread came. None of these things were travesties and maybe I sound picky, but when an establishment is touted as the only Five Diamond restaurant in Texas, the staff should be better trained in etiquette and attention to detail. We dine at Pappas Bros. often and the service there is always phenomenal (if you go, ask for Henry; he is a true professional who never misses a step).Overall, yes, we would go back. But it's mostly because of the foie gras and the pastry chef.If your budget makes fine dining a rare treat, you'll get more satisfaction from the food and service at III Forks or Pappas Bros, but the atmosphere at the French Room really is special."], ["Meriel A.", "Solid fancy french fare but nothing mind-blowing (for the price) except the service.

For appertizer, we order their famous crab cakes and ahi tuna with foie gras. The crab cakes is all crab meat and no breading. I guess that's why people love it so much, but for me the ahi tuna with foie gras trumps it all. For the main entree, we got a rack of lamp and duck breast with foie gras. Foie gras is one of the my favortie thing and this place does it right. It wasn't overly seasoned because they don't need to. It was so buttery and melted in my mouth so deliciously. The rack of lamb was also very delicious. We ended the night with a Grand Marnier souffle and peanuts bread pudding. I'm still searching the a good souffle. I don't know if I just don't like souffle or what because this is really average for desserts. The souffle is indeed better than the souffle from rise no1 though. The bread pudding is good but again I preferred another dessert over this. My boyfriend loves peanut and bread pudding so this was perfect combination for him. The desserts were my least favorite part of the meal. The reason why this place is one of the best meal I had in a while is because of their foie gras.

The foie gras was cooked perfectly, a little seared on the outside and nice and creamy on the inside. I would have liked the toast that it was on to be toasted instead of mushy, but overall delicious. This was accompanied with a small glass of moscato wine. I ordered my rack of lamb medium, suggested by the waiter and it was perfect. I usually order medium rare, but tried it medium and enjoyed it. It was nice and pink in the inside and a good char on the outside. It was very tender. In between each course we were served 'palate cleansers', mini appetizers to clean our palates for the next course. Very nice touch! The Trio of Sorbets came with Olive Oil Cake, Meringue Crisp, Seasonal Fruit and Berries. I enjoyed the meringue and berries. \u00a0 My wife ordered the seared ahi tuna tarter, halibut for the entree and spiced cake for dessert. The ahi was perfectly seared and tasty.

The interior of the Adolphus Hotel, en route to the The French Room, is a fall back to the late 1800's and is tantamount to other luxury hotels of that era, most reminiscent to me of the French inspired, Windsor Court in New Orleans. But even the decadent decor of the hotel cant compare to the splendor of The French Room itself, with it's domed ceilings, exquisite murals, gold trappings, and luxurious tapestries. \u00a0The menu changes frequently, but should you be lucky enough to be offered the Squab, Striped Bass, or the Butter Cake, I can only envy you for it will be one of the best meals of your life. Meal options include a la cart, three-course pre fix for $80/person or a chef's tasting menu for $110/person. \u00a0Most meals average $90/person, making the cost of The French Room second only to Hotel St. Germaine and followed closely by The Mansion. By the time we left the restaurant, everyone from the valet, to the hostess and our large team of waiters and assistants knew our names. \u00a0Their interactions with customers flawlessly fills the gap between the necessity for upscale professionalism and the need by patrons to feel comfortable and somewhat cozy, even in this dream-like, opulent castle."], ["Udoka O.", "My boyfriend is a chef, so it is rare that I can take him out to eat and he really appreciates the food. I decided to take him here to excite is palate and OH BOY was he excited!Firstly, I am lactose-intolerant. When I told the waiter this, the chefs went through each ingredient to make sure there was no use of milk. They were very concerned for me. Which is rare considering I'm used to restaurants bringing a plate of chilly cheese fries after telling them two or three times I can't have cheese and a \"Oops, sorry!\"The appetizers were AMAZING. The BEST appetizers I have ever had in my life. My boyfriend took a bite and his eyes rolled to the back of his head. The complimentary dish was also to die for! SMOKED SALMON HERE IS UNBELIEVABLE! I could eat it for days!!The entrees were also amazing! I had the Wild King... I never eat mushrooms but I ate them this time. The duck meat is so juicy.I had a souffle... I've never had a souffle before, so I didn't know what to expect. I don't really like it... the texture is too mushy for me. So next time, I think I'll have fruit or get some lactase pills to try other desserts.OH! The wine was SO good. And I typically hate drinking wine. The waiter recommended a white sweet wine that was just wonderful!This is a fancy schmancy place. Men must wear a jacket and no jeans. No specific rules for women. I wore a business casual outfit (something I'd wear to work) but all the other women were in dresses, so I did not fit in, hah. Oh, also I'm black so I REALLY stuck out."], ["Nick A.", "Just left....Amazing food, service. I have eaten at places in Lyon, France and this is to par with those places.

My wife and I recently had dinner there as a part of our \"night at the Adolphus, dinner and theater\" celebration of her birthday.I'd be happy to rave about the ambiance, food and service, all of which was wonderful,but instead I'll just say go there, and you won't be disappointed. The room itself is awesome, and unlike every American under the age of 50, I never say \"awesome\" unless something really is.We informed our waiter that we had theater tickets and he orchestrated our meal to end exactly when we needed to leave. The Grand Marnier souffle is so good, it should be illegal. Yes, the French Room is expensive. If that's going to make your experience less enjoyable, then it is the only reason not to go. I confess, the wine-by-the-bottle prices are through the roof (and the French Room has a very high ceiling), so we stuck to wine by-the-seventeen-dollar-glass, and in the process discovered a Tuscan Cabernet that was so good, I photographed the label and might buy a case if I can find it -- just not at French Room prices.Lastly, we both thoroughly enjoyed the fact that the French Room is among a dwindling number of restaurants that enforces an upscale dress code. I can't tell you how many otherwise wonderful dinners at excellent restaurants have been tarnished because some hayseed decided it would be okay to show up in a t-shirt and his one pair of blue jeans that doesn't have holes in them, but the restaurant let him in anyway, because a buck is a buck. The French Room did not disappoint in this regard either.We will be back for the wine pairing dinner sometime when we don't have to bolt for Will Call. Our thanks and appreciation to all the staff at the French Room -- you do what you do so very well."], ["Mike I.", "One word... disaster.I booked our anniversary dinner at The French Room after hearing nothing but good things. \u00a0My girlfriend is a Pescetarian and has not eaten meat for 15yrs. \u00a0I reviewed the menu online and saw a dish that did not have any meat. \u00a0When we got there we told the captain that we were avoiding meat. \u00a0Though he was a very nice man, in hindsight is seemed that he did not quite understand our request.When our food came it was delicious, but when my GF asked me to taste something strange in her food I knew it was a type of sausage. \u00a0When the captain came back around we asked him what is was and he confirmed our worst fear, it was chorizo.Her body began to reject the meat and we quickly asked for the check, but it was slow to come. Eventually we got the check and headed for the door. \u00a0We left so quickly that our waiter chased us down to give us the rest of our meal that we ordered. \u00a0We barely made it out the door when her nausea became too much to keep in.The next day, I called to check the menu with the staff. \u00a0After being on hold for over 40 min (I called several times, but no one would answer once the Adolphus transferred me) the girl that answered the phone confirmed that the menu online was the same as what was in the restaurant. \u00a0I then asked to speak to the manager (Jim Donohue) so I could explain what had happened.After recapping the events, he offered no apologies. \u00a0In fact I felt that he was challenging me as I explained the events to him. \u00a0All I wanted to hear was an I'm sorry and an offer to come back so they could make it up to us. \u00a0I never once asked for anything. \u00a0After I realized that my concerns were falling deaf ears I informed him that he had lost me as a customer.In the end, we were left with a ruined evening and a memory of a tarnished anniversary.Customer Compassion - FAIL"], ["Brandon A.", "Consdier this review a 4.5 star review. We went here for our anniversary and overall the experience was amazing. Told them we had a food allergy 3 months in advance when we booked the table and the waiter comes and says so I understand you have a food allergy with out any prompting from us. Told us to order whatever we wanted and they would change the dish to accommodate our allergy. Food was ridiculously good to the point that we ate everything despite having largish (for fine dining) portions for all the courses. My two nitpicks:1.When we first were sat down, our waiter was no where to be found and we were not handed a menu (something only the waiter is allowed to do) for about 8 min. After that he was incredibly attentive. 2. The wine list had one wine under $100 on it and it was something like $85. I understand this is fine dining but IMO restaurants should have at least 1 wine in each section under $50. I didn't go top price hunting but they had wines over $800 on the menu. Probably a few special reserve that aren't on the menu, didn't inquire about that."], ["Stan L.", "swanky restaurant.. exceptional service.. and ridiculously delicious souffles.. prices will definitely set you back (we opted for the tasting menu)... and for my money.. i rather spend that at stephen pyles or spoon bar kitchen or fearing's.. nevertheless.. the food is solid.. just not spectacular... my wife did rave about her foie gras which i thought was too sweet.. it was paired with a muscato d'asti rather than a sauterne... too my surprise.. the combination was meshed really well... of note.. their crab cake is disgusting.. i understand it's one of their signature dishes.. but it tasted like a crab gluten ball.. i expected a crab cake like eddie v's"], ["Jon B.", "Terrible experience.

My French Onion Soup was served hot and had a nice classic flavor to it. The potato crusted chicken with lemon butter sauce was a little bland but was a generous portion. The carrots were fresh and cooked to perfection. They tasted great too, especially mixed with the rice pilaf. I think the carrots had an orange glaze on them, which was a delicious surprise. The main reason for the high rating was the service and overall feel of the cafe. It was very comfortable with a definite \"mom and pop\" feel to it, which I love. The food was good enough to get us back, as well. We also received a discount card for 20% off all future visits. It seemed like all guests were getting the incentive card, which is a nice way to get repeat business. Oh, I can't forget the chocolate truffles. There's a refrigerated counter display filled with many varieties of chocolate truffles for $3.95 each; priced kust right to justify one rich indulgence for dessert while helping maintain self-control that might be harder to do at a lower price.

I couldn't find someone to join me so I doubled checked the fine print on the voucher and there was nothing about going by yourself or having to buy 2 meals. Nothing. So I went.

There's nothing in the fine print about that and I spent plenty. He loudly said, yes it does (it didn't) The groupon title says breakfast for two as most groupings do, but Again the fine print said nothing about a requirement to order 2 meals yada yada. So he calls over the owner and I have to reiterate that I don't have someone to come with me to breakfast. After they embarrass me in this very small restaurant where everyone in the room now knows I am single and didn't have anyone to eat with me, the owner much more business savvy then the server honors my groupon. When the server comes back over with my check he continues to badger me about having eaten alone and how I was so wrong and they would fix it this time but next time you need to come with someone.

Full disclosure: I was using a Groupon, but the bill still seemed high even after taking that into account, as I had my two daughters along. Their food looked better: an egg sandwich on a large croissant and pasta with chicken. They also brought out a small bread basket to start, but it wasn't anything special. And the side of fruit (instead of potatoes) was lame: not a berry in sight - just cantaloupe and a couple banana slices and pineapple chunks.

Be sure to ask for more garlic and seasoning when you order. It comes in a little porcelain plate with half a dozen indentations. I usually don't order this but just steal one from another diner at the table. It's good enough to steal, but not good enough to justify the calories of an entire order. LOL. Their walnut chicken is also the best walnut chicken. It's probably their signature dish because I don't know of any other restaurant that serves it. They fry a chicken breast with walnuts to make it crunchy with an interesting texture. Then, they top it off with a creamy mushroom sauce. Their french onion soup is also the best and probably their most popular dish. This is important because in restaurants where they sell very little french onion soup, it just sits and sits on the warmer and the water is boiled off, leaving a very salty brew. Their french onion soup is never too salty. It is perfect. The best dishes here are walnut chicken, the chocolate cake, and french onion soup. All the chicken dishes are excellent to good. The chicken artichoke is good, too. It has a lemon wine sauce. The sole muniere is just OK. I have a very picky seafood palette and prefer seafood that was still swimming 30 min before I ate it or extremely fresh sushi. However, this is not a seafood restaurant nor a sushi bar so considering that, the sole muniere is good. They lack a lot of French classics such as Fricassee and souffle, but they have created some original dishes such as walnut chicken that nobody else has.Atmosphere (**** out of *****); Casual dining. Classy, yet unpretentious. Sometimes, they have a pianist playing at night. I don't know their pianist's schedule, though, so you may want to call in advance. I went for Valentine's day and there was no pianist, but on other nights that I went there was a pianist, sometimes. Service (**** out of *****); If it is busy and the waiter has trouble keeping up, just flag down the owner. The jolly old French guy is more than willing to pick up the slack. Monsier Gilani will take care of you. Anything you need, just ask Monsier Gilani. He makes all the difference. I've been going to his restaurant regularly for decades, even before he moved to this new location when he was located along HWY 75. I went on one of my first dates as a teenager at his restaurant. LOL. Conclusion (***** out of *****); \u00a0The tally is four stars, but I give Cafe de France an extra star for value. He has not changed his prices in many years. I mean, where else are you going to find a 3 course meal in a nice French restaurant for $13 (early bird dinner special 2-6P), Sunday night entree and soup or salad is $11. They also have a very reasonably priced lunch special menu, too. They have an extensive wine list but if you're a teetotaler, they also have a nice hot coffee, too. For a romantic, quiet, date night on a budget, Cafe de France is it.P.S. Theresa T said that she disliked the rice and the pasta is a bit bland. I agree. That's why I always substitute the rice with pasta and order extra walnut chicken sauce on the side. I pour that tasty mushroom cream sauce on my pasta. Jonathan G said that he disliked the carrots. Yeah, I usually tell him to skip the carrots and just give me the pasta instead. Yes, the salad that comes with the set meals are kinda small, but the salads ordered as a meal by itself are big, though. Jonathan also said that he disliked the veal. Nope, I never order his beef nor veal dishes. His chicken dishes are superb, the fish dishes are OK, but I generally avoid his beef dishes. Andre G, I've actually been to Paris, so I know what traditional French cuisine is supposed to be like. That's why I said in my review, \"They lack a lot of French classics....\" Floy B and Brady H ate breakfast, no comment, I've never had breakfast here.P.P.S. You know, your dining experience is exactly how you order it, in a good restaurant. I will write a negative review if a restaurant serves me poor quality food or improperly cooked food. For example, if the food was raw, burnt, or not fresh, it would get a one star review from me. However, if the food is not seasoned to your liking, the next time you go back, tell them exactly how you want it seasoned. If they do it right, then it's a good restaurant in my book. You cannot fault a restaurant for seasoning food too little or too much because everyone has different tastes. Now, if the chef refuses to cook the dish to my seasoning specifications, then, yeah, they'd get a bad review from me. The chef here always cooks the dishes perfectly to my specifications. Ordering a dish, not specifying how you want it cooked, then complaining about it is like getting into a taxi, not telling the driver where you want to go, then complain about the destination. LOL. ;0"]]}
