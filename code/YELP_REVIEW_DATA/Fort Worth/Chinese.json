There is way too much Napa cabbage vs 6 tiny (U25) shrimp ratio.-1star. Replacing Napa (releases more liquids when cooking) with stir fried celery, carrots and onions in bite size pieces in real XO sauce or Sacha sauce would be a better complement to the shrimp. XO sauce shrimp is premium dish, so U15 shrimp or larger would be better for a nice bite. -1star.

The crispy shrimp was delicious. It tasted like salt and pepper shrimp. It wasn't battered but was still crunchy from the salt I guess?If you need a quick and tasty lunch skip the grilled pork and pick from the entree bar.

You can't find much better on this side of town. I've tried pho at alot of places in Fort worth, including the overpriced stuff at the local Thai restaurants. I'm originally from Haltom City so this isn't the best pho I've had. Stay away from the meatballs, not the usual. Instead try the tofu or the beef, all excellent. Spring rolls are massive and not as green as other spots, just how I like it. Egg rolls are very sweet and crumbley, a very difficult to find gem in most of these types of restaurants.Staff is fantastic! Definitely fight for that good vibe they so desperately need. Unfortunately I cannot reccomend you go to this with a girl your trying to impress. It's one thing to be on the side of a gas station but its another to have people come in off the street and ask for money while you eat just to grab a beer out of the freezer behind you...Go check it out"], ["Lan T.", "I've only been here once for pho.

I will have to come back again some time to try their real rolls. $11 will get you in for a lunch sushi buffet. While the quality is expectedly lower than you would see from actual sushi restaurants, the quality is still decent. Options are somewhat limited and usually hit more of your Americanized rolls, but they are still pretty good. There is also some fried dumplings, fried rice, yakisoba, salad, and tempura on the side if you want a little variety. Decent place if you're craving some cheap sushi and a lot of it for lunch.

They play hip music and everybody is very lively and friendly. Apparently it has been recently remodeled, and I must say they did a swanky job.

This tells me that the other Asian restaurants in the local area is terrible. Service was ok. We ordered one plate of steamed dumpings and one plate of pan fried dumplings. When the order was brought out, she went to a different table and dropped off the steamed dumplings at that table and brought the pan fried ones back to the kitchen. It sat there for another 5 minutes and then it was brought out to our table. It was cold. Then we waited another 10 minutes for the steamed dumplings. She said that the kitchen forgot to put the order in. And they weren't worth the wait since they were the frozen dumplings you can get at your local Asian grocer. I ordered the House special Beef. The flavor was good, but they overcooked the meat. It was very tough.I thought they would have some sushi, but only salmon sashimi and seared tuna sashimi and no other kind of fish tells me they are just half assing the sushi option."], ["Jesse W.", "First of all, I'd like to complain that while I was sitting at my table, Yelp said I was too far away to check in. I was in the middle of the restaurant! Rant over. This is my second time here. Today, I ordered the Miso soup and chicken Pad Thai. Miso soup was good, just like last time. \u00a0The Pad Thai was lacking, however. I love Pad Thai, and any chance I get, I order it...but I probably won't be ordering it again from this place. The chicken was cooked perfectly, nice and moist. Not dry at all (like some places). It looked like Pad Thai, for the most part. (Sauce was a little more brown than I'm used to). It looked good though...all the normal components (egg, peanuts, etc), but the sauce was nothing I was used to. It was a little sweet and tangy. It was reminiscent of Chinese food I've had before. Not spicy at all. I enjoyed it, but I had to tell myself I was just trying a new dish (it was hard to enjoy when my brain kept telling me \"this isn't pad thai\"). And it was good....just not what I expect when I get Pad Thai.My first experience here, everything was really good...so, I will be back. Just not when I want Pad Thai."], ["Marty T.", "Very disappointed. The hot and sour soup was so salty that it was inedible. Probably old.

As a server one should be aware of common dietary restrictions and be aware of what ingredients are in what. I was super confused when it seemed like we had two servers and two people tried to drop off our check. The sushi roll itself was incredibly dry. I had been craving a seaweed salad, which they don't carry and settled for a \"cucumber salad.\" When they suggested the salad they didn't mention that is was about seven bites of cucmber covered by a half pound of crab.

Everything from the vibe, to the food, to the owners, it is always so welcoming and enjoyable. Jessica the owner has to be one of the sweetest and genuine owners from a local business, she always welcomes you visits with you when she has time. The food is always consistently good, and made fresh. For me and my boyfriend it comes down to the simple things, when a restaurant can achieve that then the rest of the food will be delicious! For us it is the fried rice, it isn't full of bland veggies or over saturated with soy sauce, it is moist and seasoned just right- its like little pillows in your mouth! The chicken is always really moist and good as well; at most Asian food places the chicken is always really dry and overcooked- here it is always spot on.One thing that keeps me always going back is there lunch specials that they have 7 days a week! It turns me off at a restaurant when I can't get a decent meal all the time. Here at Tang's you are able to get a soup and salad and an entree! This to me is a good deal, where as most places only offer an egg-roll and rice. Another item that I love is that they have really good rewards, for every $50.00 you spend you get $5.00 off, 10% is pretty good in this day and age!One last thing that makes me happy is there happy hour is really good and last a while!
