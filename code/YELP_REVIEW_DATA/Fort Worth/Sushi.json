Cabo:spicy tuna, crab, Japanese cucumber (8)South Pacific: Eel tempura, cream cheese, pineapple, scallion, eel sauce (8 pcs)Asparagus: Cooked salmon, cream cheese, asparagus, eel sauce (8 pcs)Nothing was spectacular, but they weren't bad. I wouldn't pay full price for these rolls, but HH prices are fair. I've never found myself craving it enough to come back though. The service wasn't bad. Our waitress came by to check up on us, and was fairly patient with how indecisive we were lol. The manager came by and asked how we were doing, as well. I think he came by the last time I was there, too. I appreciate that (:Overall, I wouldn't crave to come back, but I wouldn't be against going if my friends wanted to go for HH. Tip: check in with Yelp and get complimentary edamame (;"], ["Tinsley K.", "I would give it zero stars if I could. \u00a0Friends from work and I show up at 6pm (8) of us. \u00a0We check in at front and are told an hour and a half wait despite the restaurant not even being crowded. \u00a0Fine, I get it. \u00a0We didn't make a reservation like we should've for a party of 8. \u00a0However, I see several tables open that can accommodate our party; just sitting there. \u00a0I was snidely told by the hostess that those are reserved for people who made reservations. \u00a0Ok, no problem. \u00a0We will wait by the bar. \u00a0An hour and a half goes by and we ask if our table would be ready soon. \u00a0Luckily, we were able to snag a tiny lounge like booth by the bar so we could get some appetizers since we were starving, which were ok by the way. \u00a0Nothing to rave about despite all the good reviews for this place. \u00a0We were told it would probably be another hour, on top of the hour and a half we already waited??? \u00a0Again, I see open tables. \u00a0I ask why our time is being extended even further. \u00a0I was told I should make a reservation next time. \u00a0We ask a 'manager', if you want to call him that, why we were told a longer time and got the same reply, we should make a reservation next time. \u00a0There is nothing he can do, as I stare at plenty of open tables.I have NEVER, in my whole life been treated with such disregard and I'm from NY! \u00a0I've dined in NYC many, many times where restaurants are always super busy due to the sheer volume of customers and have ALWAYS been accommodated after a long wait even if we had no reservation. \u00a0Get over yourself Blue Sushi! \u00a0This restaurant is just an overpriced, Texas sushi faux pas hangout with a tacky menu and 80's decor and the staff and managers are extremely rude. \u00a0The place was barely busy and the staff couldn't handle it then, I can only imagine what kind of train wreck goes on when the restaurant is actually crowded. \u00a0That's if it ever truly gets crowded because if they let tables sit the way they did Friday evening, they are losing thousands every night.Not only did the manager blow us off, he didn't seem to care to be losing such a huge party nor did he try to make it better by perhaps comping our drinks or an appetizer or even apologizing. \u00a0I foresee this establishment being run into the ground in the near future if they treat all large parties like that. This restaurant needs better management or staff or customer service training. \u00a0I will never go to this place again. \u00a0NEVER! \u00a0We took our business across the street to Eddie V's Seafood. \u00a0They accommodated our party right away, the service was impeccable, the food was amazing, and we dropped over $1k there. \u00a0I recommend perhaps taking some notes from their management on how to run an upscale restaurant."], ["Tonya J.", "Went there yesterday and the food wasn't as great as it usually is, the calamari was just not good to me this time; undercooked and soggy.

I moved next door over a year ago. I visited several times a week and brought MANY friends. Spent thousands of $$ here, bought hundreds of $$ in their Christmas special gift cards....However, my favorite manager was promoted to open the Dallas location. He was my favorite manager because his he ran the restaurant efficiently, the food was 99 % always perfect and in the rare occasion it wasn't it was quickly attended to, his staff and his customers adored him. He got to know his customers and we always felt special going there. NOW...management has changed over SEVERAL times. Some of the same servers are still there and they care and really want to please the customers. However, the quality and efficiency (timeliness food delivered) has gone WAY down. Every time we sit down, even if we have had the server a couple of times we are always asked \"Have you eaten here before\" - then when the servers we know see us and start talking to us they realize, \"oh yeah, these people HAVE been here - probably last week, or maybe even a couple of days ago\"Last night (Wednesday) was the final straw. The edamame was over cooked. The lettuce on the lettuce wraps were wilted and brown and they brought out the dairy sauces on the plate when we asked for them not to be included because I have a dairy allergy. This meal was taking longer than expected so we asked for the hummus to be boxed up but the server came out and said the manager told him they couldn't give us the happy hour price if we had it boxed but he could bring it to the table and they can box what we don't eat. Ok, goodness. We hardly ever box anything up so we didn't know this but again, everything was taking forever and we had to be somewhere. So we asked for it to be brought out to the table with plans of just being boxed up. THEN - the hummus was delivered to the table with the buttered bread which we asked to be left off due to the allergy so the server said he would get a new one right out.....25 minutes later we still didn't have it and the server told me it was because they had to get a \"special\" cucumber and cut it a certain way. Mind you, these cucumbers are the same they serve with every hummus dip, we just asked for no bread. Finally the server said he would just get it boxed up for us to go. Almost another 10 min went by, still no hummus so we asked to just get out check and leave. Then he came out with it boxed up and the veggies were 1/2 of what they normally are. The server agreed. We were so irritated by then we just wanted to LEAVE!!!! We told the manager after the over cooked edamame and wilted and brown lettuce and he did bring more lettuce and edamame. And he also caught us at the door on our way out to give us some more veggies but when I told him how frustrated we were with the whole experience he really didn't seem to care. It was more of a \"sorry you feel that way\" but the sincerity just was lacking in his tone and body language. We have never seen this \"new\" manager before so I don't know his name. Again, it seems like there's \"new\" management every time we go in now. I know this is just one example but ever since the manager, Scott, left there have been many experiences like this but they are our neighbors so I've waited on updating this hoping it would improve. It just continues to get worse. John and Adrian were our favorite servers. John left. If Adrian leaves I'm leaves I'm not sure we will ever go back. Now if you don't frequent this place as much as we do then you might not notice all of this. However, I saw several servers bringing more lettuce out and when I told our server it was wilted and brown he said he wondered what was going on in the kitchen because we weren't the first table this happened to and claimed they were busy. The place was \"steady\" I've seen it busy. We didn't even have to wait for a table. Try Sunday during all day happy hour - that's BUSY!"], ["Holland S.", "Blue Sushi is a cool place with good food.

They include selected appetizers and some pretty amazing rolls to choose from. Drinks: Blue has a full bar plus a selection of sake. They are known for the delicious and fruity Martinis!

We ended up ordering the Snow White, Shrimp tempura, Crunchy La, Super Asparagus and the Hot Popper. All were fairly good, no complaints except for the Crunchy La which we agreed had too much chili sauce on top which softened the crunchy Pablo crumbs quite a bit when it arrived at our table. We also ordered a house margarita which was only $3 which had a quite a kick to it. All in all, it was a great birthday dinner and I would definitely come back the next time I'm in the Ft Worth area.

Nothing really stands out in my memory or in my tastebuds.HOWEVER, one thing I remember was just how terrible the service was. The place is super hip and bumpin', so it was pretty crowded. Our waitress came to our table pretty much once to take our order (after a VERY long time, we thought she had forgotten about us) and once or twice when we had to CALL her over to order some more or get the check. She kept walking past the bar without saying anything or checking up, and she even disappeared for a very long time at one point, we couldn't find her anywhere lol.Anyway, pretty solid happy hour, but with the service and how meh the food was, probably not a go-to."], ["Aaron P.", "Great Sushi.

I've tried quite a few rolls from Blue but most just aren't my taste so I usually stick with what I know is good. The food is always fresh and great tasting, and we never have to wait too long for it to come out. Weekends can be super busy though, make reservations.I would recommend Blue to anyone!

So tender and delicious.Calamari -- lots of calamari and vegetable tempura. This was an excellent started and of course great for $5.50 as a starter (happy hour price).South Pacific Roll -- this is a roll with eel tempura on top, cream cheese, pineapple, scallion, and eel sauce.

Much less hassle in that regard.I definitely recommend the lunch special - $12.99 for a soup or salad and choice of 2 maki's, 1 maki and 1 sashimi, or 1 maki and 1 nigiri. \u00a0Just make sure you get there before the lunch rush because it does get crowded!"], ["Robyn G.", "I love sushi!!

We ended up at Temaki Sushi and I can't imagine we could have had a better experience in the other many restaurants in that neighborhood. There were about 4 tables with 4 or 5 people and one table of ten. The gentleman (later found out he was the owner, with his wife, who was also there) gestured to a table and we sat down. They were pretty busy with the big table, but brought us our menus after a couple of minutes and we ordered wine and a beer. He brought it to us and we ordered the rest of our meal. Along with some potstickers, sashimi and soup, my husband asked if ordering another roll with splitting an entree dish would be too much food. He suggested we not order it til we had the entree. I thought that was pretty good, not trying to over sell it to us. They brought us an extra beer and wine on the house, and apologized for the wait. We hadn't even thought it was too long at that point. After the soup and sashimi they also brought us some edamame on the house. The table of ten asked for ten separate checks and they didn't bat an eye - took care of them with a smile.Overall the food was very fresh, the yellow tail really flavorful and fresh. We did end up ordering the extra roll because I just had to have more sushi! \u00a0It's a small place, not a lot of space, less than two years old, but they know what they're doing.

The cuts of fish were terrible and not fresh. The hand rolls were similarly bad as was the green tea (from cheap tea bags). The one thing we did like was the onigiri, which was a rice roll that had been cut, pan fried, then topped with mushrooms and other stuff. It was a nice twist on onigiri and sushi.

Is this a sign?Owner seemed nice and was prompt to get my order.Salmon/Escolar/Yellowtail Sashimi - they were very thin (pre-cut might I add..) pieces. The escolar was a little chewy but the others were okay.Seaweed salad - just regular seaweed salad, I like regular seaweed salad.Prosciutto Roll - I told the owner to get me the most popular roll. He gave me this. It is salmon with eggplant tempura inside topped with prosciutto. I will not be getting this roll again.Although most of it was okay, it fell way below expectations for a sushi joint. Shinjuku station is just down the street..

If I worked close by this would be a decent lunchtime stop for days when I'm not super hungry. \u00a0However, I can't see it as a destination in and of itself because the food isn't out of the ordinary and once you order enough food to fill up, the prices aren't either. \u00a0Here I go, busting up nearly perfect reviews again.

We split an appetizer of pork pot stickers which were probably the best pot stickers we've had at any place. I ordered the spicy tuna roll and the salmon sashimi. The tuna roll was amazing and had just enough spice. The sashimi left a little to be desired. It wasn't bad, but it was lacking something against the sushi. My girlfriend, who had never had sushi before, ordered the vegetable roll which was fresh and crispy, just what a vegetable roll should be. Our friends ordered a caterpillar roll and another plate that I can't remember the name of. The caterpillar roll looked amazing with the fresh avocado and sauce. Whenever I go back, that's definitely on my list of things to try. An added plus was the beer/sake selection.

He didn't even give me the SUSHI!! HEEEELLLLOOOO, if I wanted to be COMPLETELY ignored then I would have sat at a table.Service: The service was absolutely so slow that my husband got his meal (chicken teriyaki) so ahead of my sushi that he was almost DONE by the time I even got mine. She kept telling me it was coming, but after twenty minutes of waiting AFTER my husband got his food, (This isn't including the time BEFORE he got his food.) it was still coming...I was feeling a little impatient. She wasn't nice nor was she mean but she wasn't that \"on it\" either. THEN another server was literally fighting with the sushi chefs about how something didn't come out yet and seriously the whole thing was a debacle. I was thisclose to just canceling my sushi and leaving, but I thought I'd give it a try anyway. (BIG MISTAKE!)Food: It was AIIIIIIIGHT, and I say that sort of begrudgingly because there were definitely some hit or miss items. On the tab:1. Chicken Teriyaki - Good, but kind of cold. (A LOT of chicken)2. White Rice - Had to get two because the portion was SOOOOOOOO small.3. Miso Soup - Watery...AWFUL! It was water flavored with a tiny bit of miso and some VERY VERY VERY small garnishes in it.4. Salmon Nigiri - Great...the star of the show.5. White Tuna Nigiri - Fishy and REALLY tough like what?!6. Unagi - A LITTTLE too greasy for my taste, but acceptable.7. Tuna Nigiri - Fishy8. Yummi Yummi Roll - More like yucky yucky roll. FISHY and almost gag worthy.9. Spicy Tuna Roll - Okay. Standard.10. Almost forgot the little egg rolls. They were okay. Price: I spent almost $75 on food that was mostly sub-par so I would say this wasn't a bargain. Not worth it. I've spent $100s of dollars on sushi and felt like I was getting a bargain but this was not worth it. There was NOTHING spectacular about this place.

For sushi or sashimi, I love love love and seriously recommend everybody to try their hawaiian walu. Very similar with super white tuna but it has more buttery texture. I also love their freshness of all of their selection. I love their octopus, squid and conch. Very clean taste of freshness. To keep their freshness they don't always serve sea urchin but when they do, again, very fresh. From specialty rolls, I love fire cracker roll, walu-walu roll, sun rise roll and of course AHI TOWER.

The interior seemed nice with dim lighting and a modern decor.

Well, it was gross! It was piled high with imitation crab, and it ended up being a really bad combination. It wasn't worth the $14 price. I could only manage to eat one.We also ordered the spicy yellowtail roll, the 911 roll (spicy crab with spicy tuna, jalapeno, and hot mustard), and the tuna lover roll (tuna, avocado, and cucumber topped with different types of tuna). The rolls tasted better, but the spicy yellowtail and 911 rolls seemed to have too much sauce on them. It was overwhelming, especially on the 911 roll. The tuna lover roll was the best one we tried. Service was exceptional. Our waitress was very nice and was awesome about refilling my water, which she did very frequently! We were never rushed either. I usually take my time eating, and they were very patient and didn't constantly bother us. The only problem- they brought out the rolls before the appetizer. After the rolls came out, I asked about our appetizer, and she said they made the rolls first. So, we had to wait another 5 or 10 minutes for the appetizer, which was unusual.We weren't too thrilled with the food.

Good start! I have never been to a \u00a0restaraunt that showed a true appreciation for my business and I haven't even ordered. LolNext the crunch roll and louisiana roll came out and delish! The crunch roll was exactly that. It was warm and creamy yet still had that delicate crunch. The louisina roll was warm and served with a kind of savory southern sauce drizzled on top.The seaweed and squid salad was the perfect side refreshing, crisp and cool. Topped with squid and a sesame kind of vinegrette it was a perfect compliment to the sushi.What got me was the Special Dragon Roll ... truly it was a special roll. It came out looking exactly like the picture ( a painting of dragon using differnt kinds of sauce) ....lol I thought that was just for the picture in the menu I didn't expected it to be on the plate.You can tell the sushi is made very well and presentation ( special dragon roll ) is a small thing with a huge impact.

Noodles were al dente, and the broth was savory. The hamachi zest roll was flavorful, yet light. Rice was cooked perfectly and not too thick, allowing your palate to savor every protein in the roll, then you get the hint of ponzu that accents it. Finally, the sashimi! Everything was fresh. My personal favorite was the tuna belly, which I think is a MUST TRY for sashimi lovers. It was melt in your mouth goodness!

The noodle was a thin style, and had an excellent texture and taste. \u00a0The broth is simmered over 48 hours, and has a light flavor/texture. Seaweed Salad: very light flavor, and prepared well. \u00a0Very small portion.Uni Nigiri: The sea urchin was a little slimy, and had mild notes of the ocean, much better than other uni i've had in america.Devil's Breath: Awesome roll! \u00a0This roll was a ghost pepper tuna, with habenero masago, not some shitty \"spicy roll\" that just had some sriracha doused on it. As a lover of all things spicy, I was pleasantly surprised to see the ghost pepper implementation. \u00a0Although the presentation was nice, and the flavor was excellent, i was let-down by the spiciness. \u00a0I will say that for the average guest (white folks) this dish is likely very very hot, so please take my opinion there with a grain of salt. \u00a0Overall still an excellent roll.Spider roll: a soft-shell crab based roll, it had excellent full flavor, without any \"fishy\" overtones.\"Chef's Specials\": Nigiri Sampler, sashimi sampler & Tuna Tataki: This is what made Lilly the best sushi restaurant in DFW. \u00a0The sushi was delightfully fresh, and had no nasty film. For the nigiri, the rice had a floral plum note, wasn't overbearing in taste/abundance, and was simply amazing. \u00a0We also washed it all down with Hitachino Nest White Ale, and it was delicious, in fact I loved it so much I'm going to order some online.We'd actually rate Lilly a 4.5, but unfortunately yelp doesn't offer that option. \u00a0I can't give it a 5 because I wasn't fully impressed with the ramen, and I am a ramen guy. \u00a0Overall, we certainly recommend this place though, as it is top notch, and the sushi is amazing!"], ["Thy T.", "Located in a shopping strip, this place was actually hard to find at night for someone who is somewhat familiar with the area. I saw the word sushi on the shopping area sign so I knew it had to be in the area. When I walked in, I noticed how tiny the restaurant is. Thank goodness I came on a weekday because I could easily see this place being packed. I met up with a group of friends (total 5 people) and somehow we got seated at the special room. We had to take off our shoes and the atmosphere of the room made us feel special. The 5 of us only took half of the table though...but it was a nice experience.We didn't order anything unusual (e.g. sea urchin) from the menu and actually went with the more normal items. Since we had their more normal rolls (e.g. spicy tuna), they didn't stand out too much to me. However, I could tell the fish tasted pretty fresh! The cost of the rolls was the average price so wasn't too surprised it. Overall, nice staff and great atmosphere to enjoy some sushi. I have to come back and try their other foods."], ["Lisa L.", "Our new favorite sushi place. \u00a0Every time we have been its very fresh. Service was great and we loved the patio"], ["Christy E.", "By far best sushi ever! Small joint that fills up fast and they close early but still amazing!

Awesome establishment!"], ["Hugh H.", "Last year on the way back from summer camp, we wanted to try a new restaurant. \u00a0We found his one and now it's our favorite sushi place. \u00a0We would go more often but it's too far away. \u00a0 \u00a0This visit we both had the 48 Hour Tonkotsu Ramen and the Lilly roll \u00a0The ramen had a nice favor and we were both pleased. \u00a0The roll was very light and had a nice taste.We had the Catalonian Pork Belly and the Tempura Okra on a prior visit - it was also very good."], ["Lyndsey F.", "I sort of don't want to share this place with you out of selfishness.

This place is a mile from my bfs apt, and we have pass it a million times but never noticed it. Definitely a hidden gem! The restaurant itself is tiny. We ordered a smorgasbord... Everything was exceptional! The Pace of service was amazing! Our waitress never rushed us. We started with a bottle of sayuri \"little lilly\" sak\u00e8... It was served cold. Perfectly balanced of sweet unfiltered goodness!We also had a few bottles of Kirin... I thought the beer was very expensive. But hey we were celebrating!! \u00a0Our first round of food was the Panko Hiroshima oysters! Perfect little bites with this sticky sauce, we for sure order them again! Then we had the the ama ebi, SHRIMP HEADS!! Again they had their own special sauce! Incredible!!! Next up was the hotategai surf clams!! They were a bit chewy. Ha! Then came the Cali 69... I normally don't like Cali rolls, but these were sooo fresh made with realy lump crab!Our next in our overindulgence was the on the border roll! That was my favorite! Perfectly spicy! Our last roll was the spider roll! It was amazingly crispy!! Over all it was a phenomenal experience! \u00a0All of that our bill was $105... I think it was very reasonable and the freshest sushi I have had in DFW!"], ["Teresa D.", "FINALLY FOUND A PLACE I REALLY LIKE! I am so obsessed now and will definitely be coming back when I crave sushi again. Such a great environment and the service was on point. First time here and I really enjoyed my experience so if you are craving sushi then I highly suggest you to come here! Give this place a try cause you will not regret it! That's a promise."], ["Erica M.", "This little gem on campbowie is really delicious. \u00a0It is a little pricey so you probably end up spending at least $50 a person to eat and feel full. \u00a0That being said, the fish is always incredibly fresh and really tasty. \u00a0They have a small portion of their menu that is rotating specials. \u00a0They always have something different and new to try for the adventurous sushi eaters. \u00a0I would say that this place is definitely one of the better sushi places in fort worth. Thumbs up!"], ["Jim R.", "The sushi was unbelievable. Fast service and nice waiters. Very clean and wonderful ambience. Prices are standard to other sushi restaurants."], ["Gina C.", "This was our first visit to Little Lilly. We were seated very quickly. Our server brought us warm towels after we sat down which was a nice touch. We ordered the shishito lime with pecans. It was delicious! \u00a0Our favorites were the \"south of the border\" roll and the \"Cali-69\". \u00a0Our son ordered the tempura udon and he ate almost every bite! The service was good and we didn't have to wait long for our orders. The restaurant is small but had a nice atmosphere. The kitchen is open so you can see what is going on.

No matter where we live in the metroplex, we are very willing to make special trip to eat Sushi Tao. Now for the specifics: the super dragon roll is, hands down, our favorite followed closely by the TCU roll. They also have fantastic dessert...try the ice cream (any flavor)...you won't regret it (unless you're lactose intolerant). They have a wide variety of beer, wine, and of course, sake. Their prices are pretty comparable to other sushi joints in the metroplex.The service has always been spectacular. Most of the wait staff know us by our order (super dragon and TCU roll)...not sure if that's something to be proud of but it definitely speaks to the quality of service."], ["Krista R.", "Sushi Tao is a restaurant tucked away in a strip center off of Overton Ridge. It never is busy so expect to have the restaurant to yourself. They have a big sushi menu with some entrees like teriyaki. I wasn't really hungry when my husband got off work and wanted to go out to eat so I got miso soup and a salad. It was okay. He got a soup.. Udon noodle soup with shrimp. I didn't care for it, but he enjoyed it. The sushi was decent. We got the super dragon roll. It wasn't bad and presentation was pretty."], ["Judy S.", "I keep trying this place to see if a different meme item will meet the rave reviews. Answer --not!Over priced .. Over rated ... Over it.

I've been to \"fancier\" sushi houses but the food speaks for itself. Very good and great staff too."], ["Kari C.", "One of my favorite sushi places to go! A small but nice little sushi restaurant, that has really fresh fish for an incredibly reasonable price! Joy and Susie are an absolute delight to be waited on by! They are so sweet and suggest the best items to try. One major thing you must try is the Uni Shooter! It was so AMAZING! Check out the picture I posted of it, it has a burst of flavor right as you shoot it, and the quail egg adds a nice finish! My favorite time to go here is during the week or for lunch, just because it's slower and you get the best service! Now that I live close to this sushi place again I will definitely be coming back!"], ["Ivy W.", "I'm a frequent customer just because I live 5 minutes away. There's not much to say about this place. It's your typical sushi restaurant. Not many of their rolls stand out to me but their sashimi/nigiri is decent- not the best but not horrible either. Customer service is always friendly and their food comes out in a timely manner. They do have a full bar and the ambience is nice at night. I do have one complaint. Do not try their mochi. It is dry and too pricey."], ["Jonathan R.", "Very fresh and delicious sushi. Maki rolls, sushi, shashimi, all great!

Meh, there are so many better places to eat than this (idk about Ft Worth but def in Dallas)."], ["Veronica C.", "This place is great! My sister and I always eat sushi when we hang out and this is our go to spot. The fish is fresh and delicious!

This place is the BOMB.COM!My fiance is a huge sushi fan and is in love with this place. I'm not a fan on sushi so I get the Udon Chicken and it is amazing.

Wine and ice not a good mix, right?-It was sweet, at times tasted like cough syrup and sweet again. But did order another one And ordered the Tao sushi, since that's the name of the place. \u00a0It was very good, waiter kept checking on me if I wanted anything else which was great + I wanted to try something else but couldn't decided. \u00a0So called it an evening. \u00a0Decor was ok.

Excellent service, when you sit down you're handed a hot towel, which I particularly like. You're also served a small bowl of bean sprouts and thinly sliced veggies in a soy sauce type...well sauce. I'm not the most adventurous sushi eater but it's worth mentioning that my sushi connoisseur friends like this place as much as I do. I love the Super Dragon Roll, it's the best. I can also vouch for the miso soup. While sushi nights are usually not the cheapest of occasions, this place offers awesome sushi for a reasonable price in a pleasant enironment."], ["Julie T.", "We decided to eat here because our hotel was close by.

It's amazing...the best sushi joint in Fort Worth (or Arlington). I was a die-hard fan of Pirhana's until I ate here. Now I won't go anywhere else.

My boyfriend and I usually venture to Wasabi Sushi for a sushi date, but we decided to try Sushi Tao, having driven by it many times. We both thought it was a fair dinner. I wasn't blown away, but I did truly enjoy my meal. We had the shrimp shumai appetizer, along with the tiger roll, mimosa roll, and Tao roll--all very good, but basic. They do have a full bar, which adds to a nice dinner out. Prices were also fair, not as steep as some of the other restaurants in town. I think we will go back due to ease and location, however Sushi Tao didn't settle our score for the best all around sushi dining experience in Fort Worth."]], "Big Fish Japanese Cuisine": [], "Wild Sushi & Ramen": [], "An Zen Sushi": [], "Pan Asia": []}
