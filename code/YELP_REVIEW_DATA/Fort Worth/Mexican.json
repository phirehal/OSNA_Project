{"La Familia Mexican Restaurant": [["Richard G.", "This place has a very good rating, but it also has a lot of reviews. \u00a0So I have much to say about La Familia, especially going on a Saturday evening. \u00a0We entered the place and waited to be seated, but maybe we seat ourselves? \u00a0There was a quarter of the crowd, not a packed place. \u00a0No one came up to greet us. \u00a0I finally went to the counter in the back of the restaurant and asked the lady if we sit ourselves. \u00a0She said there should be someone there to seat us, I agreed. \u00a0Anyways, we were seated by a senior citizen that honestly had no business working. \u00a0I felt disturbed that this older gentleman was trying to keep up with the servers. \u00a0It made the place look severely under staffed. \u00a0While seated we waited for our server, and waited, and waited. \u00a0Finally, our server appears, and asks if we wanted something to drink. \u00a0And I probably would have ordered a distinctive margarita, the one with the sugar cube, but I was already disappoint by the service. \u00a0We went ahead and ordered. \u00a0I ordered the chili relleno, stuffed with chicken and covered with ranchero sauce. \u00a0To my satisfaction it was stuffed with cheese instead of chicken...very disappointing. \u00a0Of course I informed the server that I ordered the chicken relleno, so she had to take it back. \u00a0I waited, waited, and waited for my food...so disappointing. \u00a0When I did get it back it was exactly the same disk. \u00a0I wondered if they even knew how to make chicken relleno. \u00a0I gave the disk a below average rating because it was warm plate, not a hot disk. \u00a0There was nothing spectacular about La Familia, except the waiting, and waiting, and waiting..."], ["Jack H.", "Walking in was like walking into my families home! Greeted right away with a warm smile and hand shake! We were seated right away in a surprisingly roomy restaurant. The service was exceptional and prompt. The salsa tasted as if it was hand picked from a garden with the perfect amount if spice! The queso was creamy and flavorful. The complimentary chicken soup was incredible! And this is coming. From someone who doesn't even like soup! \u00a0The flaming margaritas were stunning as well as some of the strongest and best tasting I've had! The spicy beef and shrimp fajitas were tender and extremely spicy, although the shrimp was a tad bland. The beef was tender, \u00a0melted in your mouth. The chicken enchiladas were creamy, rich and delicious! Only.complaint is they don't offer dessert and drink prices are rather high. But the strength of our drinks, I don't mind! Will definitely be back for more!"], ["Juanita A.", "Never coming here again! Place has a nice atmosphere but the food was not good at all and way over priced. The server was very short when we questioned the sauce on the enchiladas, apparently her took it personal when we told him the sauce was ranchero sauce and not 'swissa' sauce. This is not real mexican food!!"], ["Melissa E.", "Loved the salsa, it was fresh and yummy. The queso on the other hand was a little flavorless. I ordered the grilled chicken dish with tomatillo sauce. It was pretty good. The beans were a little lacking in flavor as well. Maybe because they don't use MSG, haha. They stated this on their menu, do most Mexican restaurants use MSG? :( The lunch comes with bean soup or chicken soup. I was caught offguard and ordered the bean soup. It was very good. I wish I would have gotten the chicken since beans came with my meal. The service was excellent. The whole handshake thing at the door was a little awkward... especially when dealing with a 2-year old and diaper bag and someone wants to shake your hand. :)"], ["Heather S.", "I must confess- I like to drink... Whew- I feel better..Now I don't normally drink margaritas. However, when I'm elbow deep in some cheesy, Mexican heaven there is nothing better than one of La Familia's frozen margaritas to wash it down. I was introduced to this place by my favorite foodie surgeon I work with- we left an exhibit at the Kimball a few years back and he suggested Mexican. My sister and I wanted to take him to North side to the little hole in the walls we love but he insisted on this place because the margaritas come with a \"surprise\". This was a long time ago- before they finished Montgomery Plaza- and before Times Ten Cellars was across the street- La Familia sat almost alone in the now packed strip mall on Foch. We walked in on a Sunday afternoon and were promptly greeted and sat down by the same sweet man I see every time I visit. *They get very busy on Friday and Saturday nights and they do not take reservations so just show up early, grab a drink from the register and wait for it*I will say the salsa is like the kind I make at home- I prefer not to cook my red salsa because I like the fresh taste of the raw veggies and that is exactly how they do it here. The food always comes out very quickly which makes me wonder how much of it is pre made- but Its always piping hot so my belly is always happy. \u00a0The food is very Tex- Mex and over priced at that but I love how dim and cozy the ambiance is here. So- the surprise I spoke of..... Flaming margaritas.... they soak a sugar cube in 151 and light it on fire atop all the margaritas.. Don't be like me and try to eat it- it tastes horrible. Just blow it out and drop it in the drink!"], ["Kyle M.", "The food was ok. I was not really impressed with anything but nothing was sent back.Margarita was terrible. I think the flaming sugar cube is used to distract from the fact that their margarita tastes like store bought syrup mix.Staff seated us under broken lights even though they had tables open under working lights. Some guests needed their phone flashlights to read the menu. We brought this up to staff several times but they weren't interested in addressing the issue.Overall, I would be very hesitant to return."], ["Chris S.", "Very mixed feelings after eating lunch at La Familia today. We had a great time. The food was very good and well priced. The service was excellent, but nothing we ate made us crave a quick return. The chip and salsa that's brought out when you first arrive is good. According to the owner, who came to our table and explained how he cooks things, the salsa is made fresh, daily, with real tomatoes, unlike many of his competitors who use canned tomatoes. He also mentioned that everything they cook is made with corn oil, not lard, except for his tamales. Kudos to the owner, his food is great. No complaints. However, the guacamole fell far short of great. It was basically mashed avocado. That's it. Not spice or flavor added. He told me, specifically, that he likes to keep things plain and simple with natural ingredients. Unless you want avocado and chips, there's no reason to order the guac. Meanwhile, the chicken soup I had was loaded with flavor. Our main dishes were pretty good. I had the fajitas with chorizo sprinkled it. I enjoyed the flavor, but it was pretty dry. Might have been slightly overcooked. (Keep in mind, they light the fajitas on fire tableside, not sure if that had anything to do with the dryness. I'm not cook, but an eater!) Still, no complaints. I was satisfied. My sis ordered the chili relleno, which they said was very good, as were the rice and beans."], ["D. S.", "Go somewhere else for good TexMex food. Based on the name, you would think the food would be authentic; however, it is very Americanized. The interior is dark, which is may be likely hiding dirt. It FEELS grimy. Like other reviews, the wait is extremely long. Location stinks because there is no parking in the area. I have been twice, and will not return.Groups beware-- They do NOT accept reservations. This is not a restaurant for big groups."], ["Paige D.", "Walking in the atmosphere is very pleasing; dim lights, lots of seating, large collection of old family pictures, and southern decor. This really made the restaurant live up to it's name. Sadly, the positive aspect ends there. Our friends were already seated about 10 minutes prior to our arrival. When we got there, our waiter greeted us and took our drink orders. And that was that, he never brought it to us... a non-wait staff had to retake our drink orders. After 20 minutes of being there we were ready to order. That was when we ran into our second problem. Our waiter did not show up to our table again for another 20-25 minutes. An older gentleman, whom I presume is the owner, came over to talk to us. He asked if we were waiting for our waiter and we said yes. So he said, I'll stand here until they come. Sad part is, the waiter never came. The old man had to grab him and tell him that we were ready to order.... And the worse part? We were having a late dinner, so the restaurant was already starting to clear out. When we put in our order we took that chance to ask for a spicier salsa. He said yes....and guess what? He never came back with that either! We, again, had to go through the non-wait staff..The old man, brought out free queso, probably because of our wait. It was delicious, but didn't make up for the horrible \u00a0waiter we had. 2 had the steak/chicken a la Mexicana (something a la Mexicana), 1 had the combination fajitas, and 1 had the steak a la Mexicana. Either the steak/chicken a la Mexicana was really good or we were starving after the hr wait. My fianc\u00e9 wasn't too impressed with his fajitas. He asked for his onions to be cooked extra well, which they weren't, they were practically raw. The steak and chicken were too thinly cooked which made the onions overshadow it.Overall, food, atmosphere, and ambiance was good, but the wait staff was beyond horrible, which is why I can't give anything higher than 2 stars."], ["Belen L.", "Once we walked in the host greeted my party with a hand shake. That was interesting and polite.The food was delicious. Ordered the Pollo Ala Mexican ($14.99). It was spicy, just the was I like my food. Also, ordered a margarita ($8.49). It was quite stronger than I expected to me but definitely not complaining! The reason for only four stars was due to the customer service we received from the waitress. She got frustrated that we needed extra time to order. Next, we flagged her and when trying to order an appetizer she walk away as we were speaking to her. Rude! She rolled her eyes when we asked for straws. She made us feel uncomfortable to ask for anything else. Other than that, food and drinks were great!"], ["Carl A.", "The was food was \u00a0mediocre. The service was not good. The owner was a really nice guy. I'd go back just for salsa and chips. The fajitas were nothing to brag about. Check it out though.

The manager said he remembered me; I have trouble believing him. But he was nice. The food was good. I had a chicken and beef taco. Their magaritas are always good too. It was empty for a Saturday afternoon, not sure how much the colonial affected crowd flow that day though. \u00a0Other yelp reviews said it well, good standard tex-mex with a good ambiance (and random entertaining fires on their enchiladas.)

I would definitely go to a different Mexican restaurant, unless you like not being served water for 20 minutes after you sit down and then have to wait another 15 for your beer (which you had to remind the waiter about). Our waiter was anything but interested in our table. He hardly ever made eye contact, he quickly came and left without giving us a chance to ask for anything, and it took about 45 minutes for us to get our food, after already waiting 30 minutes to order it. The food is also not worth the price at all, I feel like my taco came from a fast food Mexican place instead of a well established business. All in all, I won't ever visit this place again."], ["Janie T.", "Ate at this restaurant for the first time tonite - on recommendation from a friend. \u00a0The waiter who served us was intentionally dishonest and made our dining experience very unpleasant.I ordered the veggie enchiladas and requested no jalape\u00f1os - the waiter said the jalape\u00f1os were already mixed in with the veggies. \u00a0I questioned him on this several times and he was adamant that the dish could not be served without jalapenos - he said the same about the veggie quesadillas. \u00a0I have never had a problem like that at any other Mexican restaurant. \u00a0I asked to speak to the manager because I did not believe it and in fact asked another waiter to get the manager and when I asked again to speak to the manager our waiter said the manager was not there tonite.My wife's food arrived to the table cold. \u00a0After I paid the bill, I looked around and saw a lady taking in the paid checks, and asked if her if there was a manager at the restaurant. \u00a0The lady told me she was the owner. \u00a0 The waiter obviously did not want to send the owner over to the table. \u00a0 I asked her \u00a0if the dishes could be served without jalape\u00f1os and she said of course they could, if requested. \u00a0That would never be a problem. \u00a0 She apologized for the waiter. \u00a0I have never had a waiter at a restaurant blatantly lie because he did not want to be inconvenienced.So when dining at this \u00a0restaurant, just be aware, the wait staff may lie because they do not want to be inconvenienced. \u00a0There are plenty of excellent Mexican restaurants in Fort Worth where you can get honest service.I am posting this review because I am shocked at the behavior of the waiter."], ["Stetson B.", "Personally, I absolutely love this restaurant and the wonderful owner.

It gets insanely packed on the weekends, and getting a table is done haphazardly (at least when I went, there wasn't really much of a line, everybody was just pushing and being passive aggressive towards each other to get sat first). The food is tasty though and decently priced! However, for whatever reason, the acoustics of this place tend to carry a lot of sound... so if you go on a busy night, you'll be overhearing snippets of a lot of people yelling at each other just to be heard clearly, from topics ranging from bitching about live in general to self-important dialogs.

Tea was under brewed, so I switched to diet coke. The waiter seemed annoyed. The salsa is always good. \u00a0My husband and son ordered the quesadillas and I ordered the fish tacos. Quesadillas were good. Fish tacos were inedible. The oil that they were fried in was not hot enough, so there was no texture to the fish, just an oily mush. There was also a sauce over the fish that completely overpowered everything. It was disgusting. My husband, who can eat most anything, couldn't even stomach them.

When you walk in, someone will greet you by shaking your hand and taking you to a table. The staff is very friendly at La Familia. As you are walking to your table, you will notice the decor (and be impressed) - lots of old cowboy type stuff and family photos. They start you out with yummy chips and salsa, and either bean or chicken soup. I like the chicken, I wish I could buy a bucket of it, bring it home, and eat it every day that it is raining, cold, I am sick, or really, just every day. Normally I think chicken soup is boring and I do not understand why people order it at restaurants, but chicken soup like this is worth making room for in your belly.The food here is quite good as well, I have never ordered anything I do not like. I usually go with one of the daily specials written on big spools of paper hanging on the wall. I always leave full and happy. The service here can be erratic, the same person will take your order and give you your check, but everything in between is done by somebody new.

I liked the taste of the salsa, fresh and very tomato-y. Not spicy at all though. There was a oil and pepper concoction that you could I add so I did. We also got the queso with chorizo. This was the best thing we ate all night. It had a subtle kick from the chorizo and I probably ate half the bowl myself. Ok, maybe 3/4 of the bowl....The main courses were Mexican for people who were absent when taste buds were passed out. It was so disappointingly bland. The \"spicy\" chile relleno had almost zero heat. The rice was average and the thin splatter of refried beans were forgettable. I ordered the beef flautas. It was a nice portion and tasted ok just again, bland. Nothing at all tasted seasoned. It was just meat and cheese fried up in a tortilla. The menu said they were the best. The menu is a lie.After the boring food and crappy service, I was a little upset. We waited about 15 minutes for our waiter to come and pick up the check, a bald old man sat at our table. I figured he must be the owner, Al. At 78, he was full of humor and seemed to really love being there.

I normally don't like \"fresh\" or raw type salsas, but this one had such an nice fresh tomato taste and smell, with the perfect seasoning and cilantro that I couldn't get enough.

They make the salsa from scratch with fresh ingredients (never canned) several times a day.Next, the soup was delivered. I ordered the bean soup. It was delightful. It had a nice smoky flavor from the bacon, and the bean broth was fresh tasting for the cilantro. I normally really hate to have so much cilantro in things, but \u00a0the flavor did not overpower the soup at all. It was one of the better bean soups I have tasted.For my meal, I ordered a cheese chile rellenos. I order it at every place I try. This was also incredibly fresh and well made.

It wasn't that thin canned stuff most places have. It was chunky, well-seasoned, and did not overpower the dish at all. The food here is a delight.

For starters: this is a small beef, but as a beer nerd, there's no beer list, and when I asked what beers they had available, the waiter made one recommendation (Victoria, a beer I know well, a recent addition to the American market, backed by a major importer, and probably not nearly the most interesting Mexican beer they had at the ready). Anyhoo, that's that. Otherwise, the waitstaff but was near-by often (although I did feel like, oddly, one of them hovered around our table), and dinner hit the spot.

Next time he passed by, I asked him for the plates and tortillas. He came back with one tiny appetizer plate, still no tortillas. When I tried to explain to him that we needed real plates and tortillas, he literally just walked away. We made eye contact, so he knew I was talking to him. No chance that he didn't. Just walked off mid-sentence. We walked by again, and I flagged him again, and explained what we needed. This time, when he came back, he brought 4 plates and 2 stacks of tortillas.

Certainly nothing special.I also noted several dead roaches on the floor on the way back to the banquet room."], ["Chow C.", "Went to MJ as an afterthought. Had my family with me and we had been running errands most of the day. So we swung by after the lunch crowd. There was only one other customer sitting in the dark. I asked the hostess for a table. We were seated and the hostess was courteous, and so was the little lady that brings out the chips and salsa. But holy moly, then attitude came swaggering over. The attitude that reads...\"I wish you weren't here because I don't feel like working...\" Once she took our order, I asked her for a small side of sour cream for my fajitas. She brought out the food like 30 min. later and she said, \"Oh I forgot your tortillas for the fajitas..\" Okay, everyone makes mistakes. So I waited..and waited...and waited. Then my sister had ordered the Tortilla Soup and she was unhappy about it. It had about a cup of shredded tortillas in about a 1/3 cup of broth. And only about three 1/8 size bits of chicken in it. For $6.99, you would think they would bring it in a big bowl with a good serving of broth. So, I told her to scoop it out of the bowl and place it in one of the empty salsa bowls. I gave her a bit of my chicken fajitas. The fajitas were okay..meh. The server asked if everything was okay on osmosis mode, but I had to stop her in her tracks and asked if she could bring out a little bit more broth for the soup. She looked at me and sarcasticaly told me..\"Well it is tortilla soup, that is what it's based upon..\" I said \"Well it's suppose to be tortilla soup not a masa bowl!\" Okay, so by now, she wanted to put me in my place, and she asked my sister..\"Do you want another bowl?\" I thought...(Hell no! Why to charge me again for crap?) Anyway, my sister apologized TO HER..and said to let it go. But after that little exchange I couldn't finish my meal. Made me sick. Then she disappeared for about 30 min..never asked us if we wanted refills or anything. She just cleared the table and I could see she was standing against a wall near the kitchen..talking and pointing towards our table. Sheesh! So now it's time to pay and get the heck out of there. I told the cashier about what happened and then she told the manager. Then he told me that it's a recipe that is portioned out. And at first he was trying to argue with me..but I told him about the server and what happened, and so he said that he would give me discount. I guess he figured the customer is always right. And Believe me, I have eaten at different places where they serve tortilla soup. And my friends, this is not it. For good tortilla soup, either make it at home...or try Pappas Burgers, they have an appetizer Tortilla soup and the bowl is bigger than at MJ's and also On the Border.

The Best way to describe them, is take a standard cheese enchilada and poor some canned chili over them (yuck!). For a Mexican restaurant the menu is quite small (no burritos or chimmis). One thing I will say is the manager and service personnel were quite good. The manager came to our table and tried to make things right by having us order another item. And we did try the steak fajitas and shrimp, but to be honest it was all so underwhelming. Was there a positive? Yes... the flour tortillas are made in house and are fluffy and amazing.

I had the molcajetes \u00a0special and the meat was so tender and flavorful. It had such a smoked her spicy flavor. The shrimp was delicious and it came with quail which surprisingly good. The seasonings they use made the meal perfect. My wife had chicken enchiladas and I think they were some of the best she's had! The service was so fast and friendly. We didn't have to wait at all for drink refills or our entrees. \u00a0It may not seem like much being in a shopping center but don't let it fool you, some of the best Mexican food we have had."], ["Jessica V.", "Amazing margaritas, brisket tacos are a little messy but extremely flavorful and service is fast.

You want service? Every meal I have had here has come out in less than 10 minutes.The servers fly around the restaurant filling drinks, salsa, and chips.You want taste? Best salsa in town. The other Tex Mex staples are always fresh and well portioned. One of my favorite places for enchiladas.You want atmosphere? Mariachi's once a month. TV's laid out like a sports bar. Wooden door at the entrance like in old Mexico. Restaurant located in a hole in the wall location in an Albertson's shopping center.You want good value?

I ordered a combo that came with an enchilada, beef fajita taco and chicken fajita taco. It was really good and the fajita meat was right up there with the best I have ever had. I think Fajitas are the way to go here! We will definitely be back soon, this place is so close to home. Hard to believe we have only been here once before in the 6 years living here. We have to change that soon..."], ["Karen T.", "My husband and I had a wonderful dinner this evening. The food was excellent as was the service. We had the fajitas and fajitas enchiladas and both were perfect.

A shopping center Mexican Restaurant? Well, Monday night, a late night in the office and on the way home decided to stop in. My expectations were low. I never heard about this place and my co-workers never said that they went there for lunch or dinner. The food was great. The service excellent, and the vibe of the restaurant was nice. It was a mix of business people, families, young, and older. As i soaked in the atmosphere munching on my chips and salsa, I thought, \"did I find a gem\"? When my order of Mexican Style Quail and side of Enchiladas arrived, I knew I was in for a treat. The quail, perfectly cooked and the enchilada was delicious and void of grease. The rice was moist (Not dry that you would think later in the day) and the beans were spot on. As I left, I asked myself, am I the only one that likes this place? When I got home I typed up the restaurant and saw the reviews on Yelp. To my surprise, I was not alone! I can't wait to go back next week as I have found my new lunch spot and a new dinner home for my family and friends Tex-Mex cravings. No other tex-Mex on these lips and taste buds. I am now a Los Molcajetes follower. I can't believe it has taken me this long... however, the wait, WELL WORTH IT!"], ["Breanne B.", "Love this place! Good food and atmosphere.

However I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and their delicious salsa. If you get the salsa right it's a big deal!

I have been avoiding leaving a review for this Fort Worth landmark for a while now, because I have such mixed feelings about this joint! When the weather is pleasant, I instantly crave those simple little nachos with the pickled jalapeno relish. We usually give in to temptation, wait in the ridiculous line for the patio, and indulge in a pitcher of margaritas. Then the mediocrity of the service sets in and I often think \"Whyyyyyy am I here?!\" But, alas, we keep coming back because, let's face it, the patio is bomb dot com. My last three visits to Joe T's (probably over the course of 6-8 weeks) have resulted in pretty decent food, but consistently poor service. To top it off, during the last visit I felt like the margaritas were \"off\" just a bit. This is a MUST if you're visiting Fort Worth, or are more worried about ambiance than the actual dining experience. But there are lots of other Tex Mex places with better food and service. There. I said it."], ["Marc R.", "Make reservations! \u00a0Food is pretty good, you select from a very few available items on the menu. \u00a0If you have dietary restrictions this is not the place for you. \u00a0Salsa is very good, service is good.Its more of a fad place and place to be seen than about the food."], ["S. M.", "Joe T Garcia's is one of those places that trades mostly on name recognition. It's also the kind of place where the business model involves limiting customers' options. It's kind of a tradition for Fort Worth folks. The food is good, not great. The place has great ambience for events. Cash only, and in the year 2015, that's really inexcusable for a major restaurant. That costs a star."], ["Syl M.", "One star for good service and another for atmosphere. It's a pretty restaurant. \u00a0And enormous. The food was a huge disappointment. Margarita was weak and just bad. I had beef fajitas. The portion was big but I've had way better. The queso was probably the worse I hv ever had. I was very disappointed in the food :("], ["Matt A.", "Summary: A must-do Ft. Worth institution. \u00a0The food won't blow your mind, and parking is a pain at peak hours, but I mean, come on. It's Joe T's!!!Happy to notch this restaurant. It is a really fun and interesting tex-mex place. The wait can be long on a Friday or Saturday night. Parking was ridiculous.So, this isn't really a place you come to because you want super fancy stuff. It's not a place you come to to drink all night with friends. This is a boisterous place you come to with friends and/or family for a great ambiance and family-style meal.The choices are super limited. You get fajitas or enchiladas, more or less. You are then inundated with all sorts of food. They have nacho appetizers. If you order enchiladas, you get tacos with them. If you order fajitas, you get enough fajitas for 2 people. The beans, rice, guacamole are served on big plates, family style.Although the place was packed, the service was actually really admirable!No complaints at all for this place. It just didn't get the fifth star because some of the food was average. You might find better fajitas elsewhere. You will find better enchiladas and nachos elsewhere. But you might nto find more FUN fajitas, enchiladas and nachos!"], ["Emily E.", "The guacamole was good, the service was quick, almost too quick. Those are the ONLY positives.The salsa tasted like it came from a jar. They only serve two things for dinner (no menu)- fajitas and cheese enchiladas. We got the fajitas to share and there was plenty of food for two of us. Everything lacked flavor and moisture. The meat was so dry on the outside and overcooked that you couldn't tell the difference between the chicken and the beef until you sliced it open. What flavor it did have was sweet, not savory. The rice and beans were terrible. It all just looked and tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours- which was probably the case since we got our food TWO MINUTES after ordering it. Even the waiter was surprised is came out so quickly. And we didn't come during some slow afternoon lag, the place was packed. Oh, and the grated cheese that cost an extra dollar was way too orange, had no flavor, and didn't melt- pretty sure it was imitation cheese.The margarita was ok. I'm not a big fan of the sweet and sourness of margs so this water downed version was decent to me.As many others have said, this place came highly recommended. I can only guess that's because locals grew up going there and just never realized how awful the food was. I wish we hadn't even tried it. Literally the worst fajitas I've ever had. Could have gotten better ones at Taco Bueno."], ["Juliana P.", "I used to love this place but This place is now really expensive for the quality of food.

You lost a very loyal customer"], ["Annie T.", "Can't come to Fort Worth without a visit to Joe T.s! I usually come with a big group but their large party is perfectly suitable. The line wrapped around the front of the restaurant may be daunting, but don't let it scare you. Jump in line, it usually moves fast and get a pitcher of margs to help pass the time. When going for dinner-they don't have a menu. It's either the fajitas or enchilada dinner (the small dinner is perfect size). You get complimentary chips and salsa and with the dinner your table will get plates of tacos (so good) and the nachos (the best). I seriously dream about these nachos. They are nothing fancy but the crispy round tortilla with melty greasy cheese and spicy peppers have me hooked. If you go for brunch or lunch there are a lot more options. I had never been during the day until this past weekend, but a big mexican breakfast on a sunny patio is uber hard to beat. Lot's of egg dishes like huevos rancheros and chiliquilas and various lunch dishes in addition to their regular dinner items. Margaritas, greasy nachos, and refried beans all before noon is a fabulous thing."], ["Natalie H.", "I absolutely love this place. I've been many times, and I still can't get enough. The scenery is absolutely breathtaking. You take in all of the nature while enjoying a marvelous dinner. I've never been at night, but I need to in the future. I've never sat on the inside of the restaurant, because who wouldn't want to eat and enjoy the beautiful outside part!As for the food, well it's just as good! There's also a little venue section in the back, where you can hold special events and such outdoors.I highly recommend to anyone who hasn't been, to visit ASAP!Also, it's cash only, and it gets very packed so get there early to avoid an hour long line!"], ["Chris P.", "I've never understood the antipathy of locals toward Joe T's. Let me say it this way: I think there are two types of people in the world, and a trip to Joe T's will help you sort them out in a single evening -- There are people that can have an outing with good people in a one-of-a-kind, beautiful atmosphere (bonus: margaritas) and fully enjoy it no matter what else might be going on, and there are people who literally lose sight of the forest *and* the trees because they won't stop complaining about how one particular thing isn't up to their standards.True, there's nothing that says you can't have a truly unique atmosphere and gourmet food together, but once you've figured the Joe T's situation out, I say you should know exactly what you're getting. If it's a big enough deal, revise your expectations and choose to have a good time anyway or else just stop going. It's not going anywhere."], ["Lan N.", "Margaritas, good... Guacamole..
