Would highly recommend the restaurant to anyone in the area that is looking for a nice night out.Hosts, servers, even the water guy were all so friendly and professional. No complaints with service, but they did seem cheerfully robotic. If that bothers you, get used to it the entire night. Food was cooked to perfection. I came during restaurant week (I think they do almost the entire month) and had a taste of a good portion of the menu for a fraction of the price.-Lobster mac and cheese is very notable. Worth the price. Cheese is rich and macaroni not overcooked. Good, generous chunks of lobster.-Filet Mignon was great quality. I ordered rare and it had a smooth and rich texture. Outside sear had great flavor.-Mashed potatoes were very creamy and reminded me of Brazilian steakhouse quality. Mild taste and very fine.-Green beans had a good level of crisp and flavor. It was probably one of my favorite components of the items ordered. -Clam chowder was smooth and had a generous amount of clams. Not too overwhelming. Potato/clam ratio was equivalent.-Desserts were more on the sweet side for me. I used to have a sweet tooth, but I felt like the desserts were like pouring sugar down my throat. Chocolate cake was very rich, but overwhelming. If you're a wine fanatic, there's also a great menu. I loved how there were personalized (named) wines when you first walk into the restaurant. Really added a homey feel to the environment. I wish I knew more about wine so I could appreciate what was offered. Overall, 5/5. Haven't visited a restaurant with such a homey feel and superior service in a long time. Well worth the money spent. I also recommend doing valet, which is only like $5. Parking can get frustrating during peak hours, so spend those extra few dollars!"], ["Susan S.", "The Capital Grille truly is \"as good as it gets!\" The service is impeccable, the food is great and the atmosphere is perfect for a business lunch. My sister in law and I met here because it was downtown and the valet parking made it super easy to get in and out. I had the chicken caesar salad and it was fabulous. It came with a large piece of tender chicken, crispy parmesan, fresh lettuce and the balsamic tomatoes on the side were a nice surprise. She had the scallops from the lunch menu and they came with a corn risotto and a watermelon salad. We sat in the bar and our waiter was prompt, helpful and friendly. He recommended the specials and provided just the right amount of attention. This was such a treat for an afternoon lunch. I probably won't do this very often but will definitely be back for dinner in the near future.The hostesses were friendly and welcoming when we arrived and the valets were nice, helpful and our cars were brought up quickly.

The service is ALWAYS amazing the first time I came here it was for my fathers birthday and they gave us a free dessert and took our picture, printed it out for us. The most recent time we came here was for our 4 year wedding anniversary and when we got to our table it was nicely decorated with little hearts and a card from the staff. We received complimentary champaign for our anniversary which is very nice of them! I got the porcini rubbed delmonico with balsamic and it was to die for. Cooked to a perfect medium rare and was not lacking in the flavor department. I'm drooling as I'm thinking about it now. The hubs got the dry age sirloin and he liked that as well I know he preferred my dish over his because he kept trying to sneak a bite. We had the lobster mac n cheese and asparagus as our sides. They do not skimp out on the lobster! The was a perfect amount of cheese, lobster and breadcrumbs ( I love extra breadcrumbs on my Mac n cheese). The asparagus had a nice lemon zing to it and it was actually pretty refreshing it"], ["Suann G.", "I work across the street and stopped in with a co-worker for restaurant week for lunch.The food was great and the service spectacular.

From walking in, service, and leaving, my family and friends felt really welcomed and taken care of. The server was very professional and really had her stuff on point. She got through the specials and recommendations, wasn't too over bearing, and the other waitstaff really helped her out. I am not a big fan of the iPad menu - c'mon guys, you would really trust me with that thing? And I didn't like how I couldn't adjust the brightness on the screen. I'm old school. I want a wine list on paper and desserts on paper. On to the food. It was very nice. We started with fresh oysters and calamari. On the table, we had steaks, lamb, lobster bisque, french onion soup, mash potatoes, brussel \u00a0sprouts and lobster mac and cheese. Lobster mac n cheese is glorious. Cheesey, curly noodles and chucks of fresh lobster that macaroni haters loved. The French onion soup was perfect; most of the time I find them to be salty but this broth was silky and flavorful. I got lamb as my entree and loved it. It was cooked perfectly. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food. The wine list was nice too; $39 for a bottle being the lowest priced and most are priced around the $70 - $100 range. Capitol Grille really gave us the ultimate fine dining experience.

Our server Steve has worked with the organization for a very long time and was extremely knowledgeable about their menu and wine selection. He also provided great insights into the cooking process and offered some amazing suggestions. I'm a big fan of Pinot Noir and Steve allowed me to sample a few of their most popular selections until I found just the right one!I had to go with the Porterhouse steak for dinner with a side of Brussel sprouts and Potatoes Au Gratin.Dinner was finished off with an amazing birthday desert plate. While Steve placed the birthday desert plate in front of my wife, he slipped a long stem rose onto the bench beside me to give to the wife after he left!

Salt & vinegar chips deliciousLobster roll very bland.

When we arrived at 6 on a Friday, the restaurant was practically empty. The service was fabulous, but that might have something to do with the fact that we had our waiter's undivided attention.Now, for the food - oh my god. Its good (as it should be when you see the prices). Anyways, the bread alone is to die for. I highly suggest trying all of them, even the commonly scoured-at pumpernickel. I ordered the caprese salad, which isn't actually called that, but essentially it is a caprese salad. The mozzarella was fresh and delicious, and I love tomatoes so it was really quite yummy (but very filling so beware). For the main course I had the scallops, which were perfect. Sometimes when you order scallops there are uninvited sandy bites, but that was not the case. Basically they were perfectly seasoned and delectably buttery. The risotto was relatively good but not as flavorful as I expected considering the waiter raved about it. My grandfather ordered some very rare lamb, which sounds slightly terrifying, but even my uncultured tongue enjoyed it. Our table of six ordered two sharable sides which was sufficient. The Brussel sprouts were very nice, and the lobster mac n' cheese was marvelous (better than Ruth's Chris, sorry). Dessert is apparently essential at such establishments, so my grandmother and I shared the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with fresh berries. Honestly the custard part of the dish and the berries were to die for, but the caramelized topping was way thicker than necessary and detracted from the gentle custard. Had I seen it, the check might have horrified me into rating this 4 stars. But, I can only base my rating on what I experienced and everybody agreed the food was to die for and the wait staff was wonderful"], ["Mike H.", "Love this place.

I had the bone-in filet and my boyfriend the bone-in ribeye, they were both prepared perfectly. They have a number of delightful looking desserts which made it difficult to choose. I had the coconut cream pie and it was heavenly. Both food and service were great. \u00a0We will definitely be back."], ["Ashley M.", "This place has always been a go to of mine for celebrations. I have always been nothing but overly satisfied with the service and food. Last night, however was a completely different story.My boyfriend and I were seated directly in front of the kitchen when we arrived and we had groups of waiters standing in front of us chattering loudly about their tables while the racket from pots and pans in the kitchen sounded off in the background. We quickly requested a different table and we were reseated someone promptly, which I appreciated very much. Our first course of shrimp cocktail and crab cakes were fabulous. The shrimp were huge and fresh and the crab cakes were flavorful. Unfortunately this is when our positive experience ended. This restaurant one carries one size of filets. A 10 oz. We inquired about any other sizes and they simply said no. There was absolutely no other sizes offered. We ended up ordering the 10oz Oscar style and the lobster mac and cheese. \u00a0Both have which have always been our favorites there. Upon ordering our waiter said they no longer did Oscar style which is completely unheard of at an upscale steak house. He made a huge show about having to go back and ask the chef. He finally returned saying they would make an exception but it would take an extremely long time and it was a total imposition. Finally our entrees and sides came and they were both good. The lobster mac and cheese has changed a lot since last time though... I always rave to friends about the huge chunks of lobster in this dish. On this occasion it was not the case and I think I counted 2 pieces of lobster total. At the end of our meal our server came and took all of our plates without asking and did not offer togo boxes when we had an extremely large amount of food leftover. Pretty rude if you ask me...This restaurant seems to have changed a lot over the last few months and definitely not for the better. I hope to see it change back to their old ways."], ["Pepa R.", "Celebrated a nice birthday party for a coworker. A party of 9 with no reservations for a friday night, was a little complicated.

We started out at the bar, boo with a mixed whiskey drink and me with a glass of dry chardonnay. The bartenders were just chatty enough without being overbearing. We quickly got our seats within 15 minutes and were seated as a nice booth in the midst of the restaurant. Off the RW menu, I got the salad and boo got the clam chowdah, we both got the filet's with the accompaniment of mashed potatoe's and green beans, and we ordered both the cheesecake and the flourless chocolate cake. We also threw in a side of the lobster mac and cheese as we had heard it was amazing. Nothing disappointed us! We were actually too full half way through to eat even the dessert, so they kindly boxed that up for us! The filet's were cooked perfectly - even re-heated up the next day they were juicy and melt in your mouth tender (yes, I know, I shouldn't be treating a filet this badly, but we couldn't let it go to waste!). The desserts were divine even the next day, and the service and the entire staff as a whole was just impeccable. We love Capital Grille, I'm just glad to see the standards here are just as good at any of them :) We'll definitely be back for more special events and/or restaurant week next year!!"], ["Cristina M.", "Excellent dining experience last night! It was my first time there and will definitely be going back. Food and service were terrific! This is the best service I've ever received in Texas,from Chicago.

I just came back from capital grill in Fort Worth. Really good food. They treat you really nice and they treat you like a VIP on your birthday. I had the steak, my mom had the lamb chops! Really good! My dad had the surf and turf steak and lobster! I had one bite of each of their food, oh my god was the food awesome! It's very fancy. So dress your best. If you don't plan to dress up that nice, a everyday dress for women would be fine. A collared shirt and some Jeans would be fine. Want the best waiter? Have the hostess sit you to the right of you when you walk in. Sit in one of the booths or tables when you walk in to that room. You'll have the best waiter. Also, you know this place is fancy because it has mouth wash in the bathroom. Go eat and enjoy. They have great deserts too. Their alcohol, desert, and other drinks menu is on a iPad. So if you hate apple, you might just want to steer clear of the restaurant. I'm kidding. Not about the iPad of course. About Samsung and android people wanting to steer clear of the this restaurant.

Will definitely be back."], ["Bridget V.", "First, I wanted to start by saying that I rarely use phrase \"best ever.\" A. because I am forgetful and B. I find it hard to pinpoint what would make something best because all food is different and I have shoved some wonderfully delicious things in my mouth. I am here to tell you that I had the BEST. MEAL. EVER. at The Capital Grille.My fianc\u00e9 and I were celebrating our anniversary on July 4th and he surprised me by taking me to The Capital Grille. We had never been there before, but he saw it had great reviews so he booked the reservation. We were seated right away to a table with heart shaped confetti as well as a single rose for me. It was so cute.The service was outstanding. Our server was very helpful and knowledgeable, and checked on us often, but she wasn't overbearing in anyway. She also brought us a sample of her favorite cocktail and of an appetizer for us to try. Management and the chef also stopped by our table to see how everything was and to thank us for dining with them. Usually, I am not a fan of the manager stopping over to check in, but the way she approached us was much politer and less abrupt than what I am used to. It was also between our dinner and dessert so I didn't have food in my mouth (I hate that so much! I seriously think they train servers to do that at some restaurants because then you can't complain!).I saved the best for last. The food. The bread was excellent. It was moist and there was a great variety. It definitely tasted fresh. For the main course, I ordered the porcini crusted ribeye and my fianc\u00e9 got the bone-in Kona crusted NY strip. Both medium rare and cooked to perfection and my sweet mother of God, both steaks were AMAZING! Tender, juicy, with excellent flavor. I only had a bite of the strip, so I can't properly describe it. All I remember is that it was flipping awesome! My steak had a wonderful savory earthiness. Like an umami. It was paired with aged balsamic which added an excellent tang and a bit of sweetness to break up the strong flavor of the porcini. Both steaks had a crisp crust on the outside which is arguably the best way to eat a steak. Both steaks were huge! My ribeye was the size of the entire dinner plate, and about and inch thick and the fianc\u00e9's, while a bit smaller, was at least 2 in thick! We also shared the lobster mac and cheese. This \u00a0is a must! I don't care that you might feel pretentious for spending somewhere around $18 for Mac n cheese, but that shizz is worth it's weight in gold! Normally, I am not a fan of cheese with my seafood, but they definitely picked the perfect cheese to go with the sweet and succulent lobster. It was a mild white cheddar I believe, with the perfect amount of saltiness to counter balance the lobster. There is also a buttery, crunchy crust at the top to add some needed texture. They also gave use a free dessert for our anniversary and I am shocked to say that the dessert was almost as good at my steak! They placed two individual sized desserts on one plate that had \"Happy Anniversary\" stenciled on with chocolate which I found very thoughtful and unique! One of the desserts was the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e cheesecake and the other dense chocolate mousse cake with whipped icing on the side. The cheesecake was creamy, with the perfect balance of sweet and tang. It was the lightest cheesecake I had truly ever had! True to its name, it had a caramelized sugar crust on top which gave it a slightly bitter crunch. It worked well with the sweetness and tang. Last but not least was the chocolate mousse cake. It was so dense and bitter sweet, and left me weak at the knees! Haha! It satiated my normally unsatisfiable sweet tooth and chocolate monster hidden within. The \"icing\", which was more like whipped cream, cut the bitterness of the dark chocolate and lightened up the bite a little. I preferred just eating both separately because I love bitter chocolate. \u00a0It was decadent, rich, and sinful. Just what I love in a dessert! Thank you Capital Grille for making our anniversary perfect!"], ["Diana B.", "Had our Annual Secret Santa Dinner here for a group of 9. Made reservations, but still had to wait a little over 15 to 20 minutes for a group to leave before we were seated. They helped us with all the gifts we had in the closet while we were waiting. There weren't any seating areas to wait and the bar was pretty packed, so that was a downer. The place is really dark and made me a little sleepy, as for the other girls I went with, it was the same for them. We were too close to other people, especially for a large size of 9. I think we were a little loud for other people and taking too many pictures. LOL. As for the service or our waiter, he was really nice and attentive. I didn't have to track him down at all or ask for any refills. Also, our orders were split for us if we shared, which I thought was nice and neat. I didn't expect it, but they did it for us. All good portion sizes to share. I honestly believe you can order a dish for every 2 people.Food we all ordered:Pan Fried Calamari with Hot Cherry Peppers - I would say this taste like any other restaurants. I can just eat this anywhere. It was nothing special to me.Lobster & Crab Cakes - The sauce was pretty good and the crab cakes taste fresh. I enjoyed it. I like more more crispy on the outside, but this was still heaven in my mouth since I love crab cakes.Lobster Bisque - Good chunk size lobsters in the bisque in a really good broth. it was creamy and rich. This is not part of the menu, but they had it available. \u00a0Chilean Sea Bass with Mushroom Soy Broth - My sister ordered this, but of course I tried it. The soy broth was a bit salty. If it's going to be a mushroom sauce, I like it a bit more creamy, but the chilean sea bass was soft and good, but doesn't compare to Pappadeaux chilean sea bass!Double Cut Lamb Rib Chops - I thought this taste okay. One of my girlfriends ordered it, but I tasted it too. I've had better at other places.Dry Aged Porterhouse Steak with Courvoisier Cream - The steak was moist and on point. The sauce was more of a gravy to me for which I asked to be served on the side. Definitely something to order.Pan Seared Sea Scallops with Wild Mushroom Risotto - The scallops were not satisfying to most of us who had it. It didn't have a unique taste or made me want to order it again. I felt I could have it anywhere else. As for the risotto, that was delicious!Lobster Mac & Cheese - One of the best mac&cheese I had. I loved it. It had a good amount of lobsters in it, very rich and cheesy, and I believe there was garlic bits on top which was a super plus for me with the crisp. Parmesan Truffle Fries - Did not like it. I wouldn't order it again. Just my preference."], ["Peter H.", "My fiancee and I went here after the nutcracker. I missed our reservation at The Reata because of traffic and we almost went somewhere faster because of how hungry we were. We ended up going here and thus avoided what would have been the greatest culinary mistake of our young lives.The service was excellent. Chester, our waiter, has that rare quality of being engaging and talkative without lingering at the table. When we told him we are getting married soon, a complimentary dessert with \"19 days and counting\" written on the plate in chocolate was brought out. Any other staff member we talked to showed the same attentiveness.The food, ohhhh the food. I have a habit of giving a little chuckle of delight when I eat great food. The Kona rubbed sirloin I ordered fit the bill, as did my fiancee's sea bass. I didn't so much cut the steak with my knife as I set a knife on the steak and put some pressure on it. Truly excellent.

And this year, it was a visit to The Capital Grille in downtown Fort Worth.From the moment we arrived, we were taken well taken care of. We were promptly seated in a cozy booth where they had sprinkled sparkly confetti on the table in honor of yours truly. Our server, Chris(topher) Parnell appeared quickly to offer me a long-stemmed rose (which, by the way, lasted a solid week at home in water), and to take our drink order. The servers here are for more than merely order-taking and delivery; rather, they are knowledgeable about everything on the menu and - at least in Chris' case - fluent in mixology. When I ordered my standard Old Fashioned, I was asked something I'd never heard: Dry, Sweet, or.. I can't remember the third. While this may be a bit pretentious, I found it interesting and just right for the experience.Though the lighting was a bit dim to comfortably read the menu, it's hard to argue with the ambiance. We were successful in ordering, trying \u00a0a couple appetizers first. The lobster crab cakes are a must-try; I'd say about 95% meat, very little filling, and simply delicious - best I've ever had. The french onion soup my mother had was also probably the best I've ever had. Oh, and I failed to mention their selection of breads and rolls which was a refreshing change from the norm what with warm and soft pumpernickel slices, onion rolls, and sourdough. Our entrees didn't disappoint either. My dad had the bone-in rib eye, which was tender as can be and full of flavor. My mother tried the tenderloin, and though I hate to sound like a broken record... best I've ever tasted. Finally, I had the grilled ahi tuna. Used to this coming out in tidy little seared slices, instead I was presented with a large steak, perfectly seared. The tuna cut like butter and tasted wonderful. And, to ensure that we got our veggies (entrees are a la carte), I ordered us the green beans, which came sauteed/grilled with cherry tomatoes and roasted garlic. I couldn't get enough.We opted out of dessert because - as it was my birthday - Chris brought us a trio of desserts - the perfect sampling to end an evening of fine dining. Truly a great experience. The only word of caution: you get what you pay for. Just like everything was among the best I've ever had, the price point was equally 'high' quality: not for the light wallet, even with a $75 gift card. Worth it once in a blue moon if you can afford it, but be forewarned, it's not cheap."], ["Gary D.", "My wife took me to Capital Grille on my Birthday. \u00a0The food was excellent and the service was even better. \u00a0I highly recommend anyone looking for a place to feel special to stop by the Capital Grille. \u00a0You won't be disappointed!"], ["Vishal S.", "Typical chain restaurant.

My wife had the lobster roll (I bet you're wondering if it was full of lobster. It was!) and the clam chowder. The lobster was tender and moist in every preparation. Cheryl our waitress was phenomenal. So kind and courteous. Just a joy to have her help us. Got the cheesecake and the coconut pie to go. Had them for breakfast the next day. The cheesecake was by far the best cheesecake I have ever tasted. It was melt in your mouth delicious. Perfectly tangy with moist tart berries to accentuate and offset the tanginess. The coconut was the best I have ever had as well, but the cheesecake was so good it overshadowed it. Today we received a hand written thank you note from Cheryl.

If you need a drink on a Sunday and you happen to be around the Alliance area, Houlihan's is the place to be. Domestic drafts are $3 and margaritas are only $5. I ordered one of the Traditional Margaritas. It was served to me in a pint, and it was strong as hell.

I didn't send it back because it was not over cooked to the point of being inedible or bad even, it just wasn't cooked to my liking. I got a 9 oz glass of red wine that took a good 15 minutes to come out. I would understand it was busy but it was at 3 in the afternoon and it wasn't busy. There were 3 tables in the whole restaurant. My girlfriend got the buffalo bleu salad. The lettuce was a little limp and the bleu cheese came in a slice instead of crumbled on top. I could see why after watching her try to crumble it for 10 minutes. It just stuck together in one spot and turned into a giant ball of cheese. The portion was extremely small for 12 dollars. It came with a small cup of soup as an appetizer; she got baked potato and said it wasn't bad. I got chicken tortilla and it was very good. So overall food wasn't bad, just not good portions for the price. Now to the service: always Houlihan's biggest downfall. The service was SLOW. Very very slow. Like everything was stuck in slow motion. 15 minutes for a glass of wine. 10 minutes later soup. And 25 minutes after our entree came out. The only thing that was fast was our brownie desert (which is normally delicious, but wasn't as great this time). Now getting to our actual server. It was just weird. He acted very strange. Shaking our hands at the beginning of the meal kind of weird. I couldn't decide if he was hitting on my girlfriend or just had an odd personality.

He shook our hand and was monotone in such a low baritone, I could barely hear him over the obnoxious playlist they have playing in there.

The waitress never asked me for my drink order. She did finally bring water at least...30 minutes later.2. My sister ordered the stuffed Cornish hen. The menu says to allow 20+ minutes for cook time. The dish came out after about 5 minutes. My sister did not like it and barely ate any...she sent it back but they didn't offer to refund her money. A couple hours later (yes...we were there for 3+ hours), we looked over and were horrified to see a tray of 5-6 cooked Cornish hens sitting out on top of a tall appliance. They were still sitting there when we left. 3. Aside from my sister mentioned above, everyone else's food took *at least* 45 minutes and everything came out at different times. My food took over an hour (beef kabobs & rice).4. My mother ordered the stuffed squash. The waitress asked her if she'd like shaved lamb or ground beef. My mother said \"shaved lamb.\" When the dish came out, it had ground beef in it. When my mother asked about the lamb, the waitress insisted, \"That dish does NOT come with lamb.\" She then proceeded to argue with my mother about it.4a. So I heard of something else that happened that night. Our friend also was asked if he wanted beef or lamb. He said lamb. When his meal was brought out...it was a ground meat. He gave the plate to the waitress and asked \"Is this ground beef?\" And she said, \"Yep!\" Then he said, \"I ordered lamb.\" The waitress then lifted the plate to her nose, took a big long whiff, and said, \"Oh yes, this is lamb.\" 5. I think the waitress knew we were dissatisfied with her service, but she did nothing to remedy it. Oh ok, at one point she came by with 2 random salads and said \"Who wants an extra side salad? They're freeee!\" as if that was an amazing offer.6. We were there so long (not by choice...that was mostly time spent waiting around for food) that we saw both belly-dancing performances (one at 8 and one at 11).7. My other sister ordered a cheese pita and french fries for the kids...these took the longest to receive. They were finally brought out around 10pm (perfect meal time for children). The fries weren't fries...more like homestyle potatoes. They were sizzling hot...so you'd think they were fully cooked...nope, when they finally cooled down and we could touch them...they were completely hard and raw on the inside. Yum.8. Everyone, except me, said their food was bland. There were lots of full plates, if you know what I mean. My food alone is where the 1-star comes from. So...if you have to go here, get the kafta kabobs I guess. But tell them eeeaasy on the onions! It was covered in raw onions (I LIKE raw onion...but this was too much).9. When we were ready to go...we couldn't find the waitress. This isn't really a big place, but she was nowhere to be found. Finally, we saw that she had emerged and was at the computer. She was there for, I kid you not, 25-30 minutes trying to figure out our checks. 10. We were charged an \"entertainment fee.\" LOL. $1 per person.------Since my food was decent, and I guess I was in a chill mood, I was ok with my check when it finally came. My total was $20, which included kafta kabobs, water, and crappy service. But...I really feel bad for others in my party who paid $100+ for horrible food that they didn't eat. No compensation was offered...so I'm gonna have to say the waiter service and customer service here are appalling. Maybe this girl was new.....but IF she was new, why on earth was no one helping her? And...her being new has nothing to do with the speed of the kitchen.... And...why didn't they care that customers hated their food? And....none of that can explain why a tray of cooked meat was sitting out in room temperature... So, ONE STAR - for the kabobs. And because I have to put at least 1 star."], ["Chris J.", "Great Lebanese/Middle Eastern food. The week day offers a buffet that includes a large variety of Lebanese dishes.

There aren't many options in the area, aside from Mexican, burgers, or steak. It's located in a historic commercial block and has a fabulous neon sign out front. For lunch, you can either order off the regular dinner menu, or you can get the all-you-can-eat buffet. We each chose the buffet, since it's only $8 and was quite large. It was delicious! There was a variety of Lebanese and Greek foods, including several versions of hummus, gyro meat, Greek salad, and warm pita bread. In addition, there was also several other options, including fried chicken, and my favorite, roasted Brussels sprouts. For dessert, there was also a variety of sweets and fresh fruit, including watermelon, cantaloupe, and mango. All in all, we were each very impressed.

Liked the lamb gyros and salads! Definitely going back with my lunch crowd."], ["Lauren M.", "Save your money, skip this joint, seriously. Having traveled around the world and lounged/dined at many establishments, I can say with full confidence that Byblos was by far some of the worst service and drinks I have ever had. Upon walking in, I had already stepped into the hookah lounge when a waitress with curly hair demanded my ID and for me to step back out into the lobby. No greeting, just plain rudeness. I felt like I was in trouble. After scanning my ID, she just sat at the computer so I walked back into the lounge and had a sit. About 15 minutes later, a young waitress walked in and just bluntly asked me \"Do you know what you want?\" I was dumbfounded and asked for a menu. I was handed a hookah menu only. She had no suggestions other than \"they're all good.\" I settled for the hubbly bubbly Blue Mist with Ciroc. Placing this order was like trying to talk to someone who speaks no English or else is totally lost. Was rather awkward. She ran off and I tried to flag her back down for a drink menu, meanwhile, another waitress who looked like an angry Morticia Adams came in and asked if we were there because we were bored. What? Are you criticising my choice to visit this establishment? Maybe it was an indirect sign that the night was going to suck and there must have been no other options for entertainment. 20 minutes go by and finally I am able to grab the waitress and ask for a drink menu. I got the Bahama Mamma and my friend \u00a0ordered the jalape\u00f1o cucumber margarita. We asked for specific liquors and she looked like a deer in headlights. I probably got well but paid premium. Hookah is just now arriving. Drinks take another 20 minutes and are super ugly. My drink just had a measly marichino cherry stuffed onto a Southwest Airlines looking cocktail thing sitting across the top of my drink. It rolled off the drink when I sat the cup down. My friend had a huge, hideous, dirty, and wilted cucumber slice on hers. Neither of the drinks tasted good, we're overly sweet, and I doubt there was any alcohol in them. The hookah was alright but about 2hrs in, we were way past ready to go. We asked for the check and the waitress never brought it so we asked someone else to bring it. I paid with a card and my friend paid in cash and we asked for the check to be split. Apparently this was super confusing for them to half a 50$ ticket. After one waitress said it was all another ones fault, it finally got taken care of only for my friend to be shorted by 10$. When we immediately notified them, they acted as if we were crazy and pocketed ten to try and get ten more dollars. Needless to say I will never go back here ever again. I wanted to just get up and leave about 30 minutes into my visit. Management obviously has no idea what they're doing and none of the girls communicate well, have manners or any type of service industry hospitality training. Too bad since it is a nice place and different for the Fort Worth area.

TVs are everywhere in the place if you decide to sit inside. Jeff and I decided to \u00a0grab one of the few open spots on the patio. We were there early, the weather was great, and the patio was nearly full already. The patio looks prepared for the middle of summer when it gets here. Fans all over the place with mister attachments on every one of them. Even in the seat yourself area, the staff located us right away and were asking how they could help us. The whole time we were there, they were very attentive. We had the fried pickles to start. They were good, really sour, and not greasy at all. I went with the Suicide Jack buger for my meal. Other than the buger being much more done than the medium I asked for it was also really good. Great flavor on the burger itself and the pepper jack cheese and other peppers added a nice amount of heat to the burger. A nice touch was the toasted bun. The price was right.

I always feel like I'm being a burden by needing the another drink, or even my check. I guess you have to be a \"regular\" to get good service. On the other hand usually when we sit on the patio or in the rest of the restaurant the service is quite adequate. You don't have to get out of your seat to find someone to \"wait\" on you. However, the food is really good. My husband orders the bacon cheeseburger with natural cut french fries and thinks it's one of the best burgers in DFW.

This was my first time at Flips, and I was immediately impressed with the layout. As you walk up to the entrance you see a good sized patio with a lot of bar-height table seating. I didn't see many TV's outside so we decided to go inside. Closer to the entrance doors you will see on your left that sliding glass doors are open and you can walk down a couple stairs to get to the bar. It gives a great open and welcoming atmosphere. Inside of Flips, tables are spread out nicely and there are TV's everywhere for prime viewing of various sports. I ordered a beer, fried pickles (a signature appetizer) and the BBQ Bacon Burger w/ chips. The pickles were just ok. There wasn't a ton of flavor in the batter, and just having ranch to dip didn't help. I also think the slices where just a bit too thin because many of them were shriveled up once they came out. I would probably pass on these next time. The burger was juicy and delicious. It was delivered medium as ordered, BBQ sauce was plentiful, and veggies were fresh. The bacon was piled all crumbled up, though not as overflowing as Snuffers. \u00a0The chips and fries at Flips are made in-house and you can definitely tell. The chips are crispy with just a bit of oil left to let you know they're fresh. I tried some of my friend's fries and they were good as well with that fresh hand-cut taste. Between the two of us the bill was roughly $35 total for two meals, and appetizer, and two drinks. So it was about what I was expecting. I also want to complement the hostess and waitstaff who were both very friendly and attentive. Be aware that this place didn't seem to have a lot of parking, so if you're going on a busy night, try and get there early or you'll be parking on the street. \u00a0Luckily we found a spot right up front so I can't complain about parking on my visit.I will definitely have return visits.

It always makes me nervous when some takes you ID and you loose sight of it as it's too easy to have your identity stolen. Another draw back is I'm a non-smoker and the smokers dominate the out door patio area, so there is no place there in the patio area that the drift of the smoke can't get to you.

The animals were real at one time and were bought from a museum. (I know that is a fact, because the little girl I was eating with HAD to ask the waiter, to my happiness) I have also been to the Flips in Grapevine, but this place in Fort Worth is new, big and pretty cool. FOOD: EVERYTHING IS GREAT. I suggest the Turkey Avocado sandwich, and you don't have to bother with fries unless that day you want fries. The chips are HOMEMADE. They are so yummy. Get a side of ranch to use to dip and you might reach heaven. They also have a small size cheese fries, which is nice when you don't want to gain 10 lbs. in one night. I happen to be a connoisseur of this dish, and I have to say it wasn't bad. They also have nice lovely salads. The queso is all right, I have had better. SERVICE: The service was great. Nice waiter, and he was good looking and that never hurts in my opinion. He was helpful, knew a lot and didn't forget to bring me a side of ranch. Good call. He also talked to the little girl with me, very nicely, and politely. I respect waiters who do not want to kill children. Sometimes, I think I would. He also filled up my pop without me asking. I don't like to go thirsty. COST: It's not bad. It's not too expensive, and the food is good. I know that they have $2.00 happy hour pints, and that is steal in this town. The Fort Worth and Grapevine location also have a nice patio, but I won't enjoy it until it's not 1,000 degrees outside and constantly sunny. Why sweat when you can look at a giant elephant instead?

The prices reflect that of other adjacent restaurants, but the food doesn't live up to the same quality. More recently we shared a plate of bacon cheese fries with some friends and I didn't like them at all. They were so saturated with grease that they had no taste, other than grease of course.

Know that they're unbowed at the prospect of getting to know your Benjamins -- each entree rings at least thirty bones -- but the specials are interesting, the soup and pate intriguing, the service warm and efficient. Though the prix fixe house special sounded inviting (steak frites with a mousse chaser) I ended up having my way with the Magret De Canard Fort De France, a seared Moulard duck breast with a golden raisin and rum sauce accompanied by roasted cauliflower with duck confit. It was as divine as it was filling: I entered fully intending to go three rounds with dinner, including dessert, and the tray looked terrific. But there was simply no place for additional food to go. The iPad wine list is a special kick (and awesome, I kind of wish all restaurants did this, but this one really stood out because it did), and the duck charcuterie plate was a great advance on the main course.

The chalkboard menu usually has the best offerings but there's nothing to scoff at the table menu, either. I can't imagine anything that comes out of their kitchen could disappoint. In fact, this is one of the few places where the food that arrives at the table usually exceeds expectations and pleasantly surprises. A few details: chocolate lovers shouldn't feel disappointed when they see the dessert tray, the kitchen can make a molten chocolate dish that's pretty great, although you might want to order it when your entrees arrive.

On the other hand, the scallops, which are apparently one of their top dishes, were fairly plain, though they did cut like butter. \u00a0They were served with a simple butter sauce and some simple julienned veggies. \u00a0We then had the french onion soup and the beef short rib salad; both were nothing too special. \u00a0The soup had a nice beefy flavor, but the crouton and cheese were too large and pretty much soaked up all of the soup, leaving a saturated piece of bread with some runny Gruyere. \u00a0The salad had nice components, but nothing blended together. \u00a0The short ribs were really chewy and were not braised to perfect tenderness. \u00a0Roasted tomatoes and grapefruit segments were nice touches, but all of the pieces didn't complete the puzzle. \u00a0For the entrees we had the roast duck with black currant sauce and the lamb chops. \u00a0The duck was disappointing, as the meat was perhaps a tad overcooked, thus making the meat a bit tough. \u00a0The sauce was a nice complement though. \u00a0It was served with some mediocre sauteed veggies, haricot verts, and a blue cheese potato casserole. \u00a0I must say though, the lamb was probably the best I've ever had. \u00a0It just had the perfect taste, tenderness, and even a hint of real gaminess. \u00a0Normally, gaminess overpowers a dish, but it really worked well with the strong demiglace served with the lamb. \u00a0It was served alongside haricot verts and Israeli couscous. \u00a0The couscous had nicely seasoned ground lamb in it, which made it interesting. \u00a0So, lamb was the real gem of the night. \u00a0Overall, the service was great, except at the end when the ticket came... \u00a0On comes the venting/complaining. \u00a0So the male server we had told us that an entree/appetizer combo comes at a set price, and that our entree also comes with a soup or salad. \u00a0The female server changed this on our ticket, charging us for an a la carte soup or salad, putting an addition $11 on the bill. \u00a0Though my mother and I know to pay for what we order, we were still extremely bitter about the way of calculating this miscommunication; we don't expect to pay for excess when it is not what we originally wanted. \u00a0We could have easily passed on soup and salad if we knew that it was extra. \u00a0She was adamant about this, and despite being nice the whole night, was a bit rude because in this case, \"the customer is not always right, apparently.\" \u00a0Thus, the night ended on a sour note, and we left extremely frustrated. \u00a0Come for the food, but watch out for the pricing system; it is fairly flawed, and pricey."]], "La Madeleine French Bakery & Cafe": [["Stacey S.", "I came in for a simple breakfast.

Overall- My advice is to utilize the patio seating, eat beforehand and have only cheese and other wine pairing accoutrements, avoid \"by the glass\" and order a bottle."], ["Trish F.", "This place was delicious!!! \u00a0We had the Bourbon Pecan French Toast and I can not wait to go back for some more!!!"], ["Clarence L.", "Fried chicken worth the wait time. Stellar.

I had ordered the basic breakfast, \u00a0and the grits were outstanding! My boyfriend had the fried chicken that he \u00a0loved as well. While we were waiting on the chicken (it takes a while to make, but so worth the wait) we split an order of the amaretto French toast. We devoured that rather quickly, it was so good. My mimosa never ran out thanks to the lovely wait staff. We want to come back for dinner and try the pb&j wings!"], ["Melissa R.", "Hubby and I ventured out Sunday for some brunch perfection. I wanted mimosas and a delicious, well-seasoned eggy breakfast. Max's fit the bill. Excellent service, the best chiliqueles in town, and prices that are fair, not outrageous. I also appreciate the fact that the servers are knowledgeable about wine and champagne options yet subtle and not pushy. There's a time and a place to buy a bottle for the table and there is a time and place for a $2 mimosa. We will be back for both!"], ["Sandra P.", "Sunday brunch was amazing. We came in without reservations and had to wait... But the food was totally worth the wait. \u00a0Ordered the Roasted Chile Relleno with Chorizo- I don't usually go for this popular dish but I could not resist it this time. My instincts were spot on! It was delicious! Next we shared the Lemon Bar French Toast and it was absolutely divine. You must try it! Big bonus... Excellent service from Emily."], ["Ali S.", "I've only been here once so far, but I plan on returning next time I get the chance! I work down the street and I had an early meeting one Sunday morning, a few coworkers and I decided to grab some brunch before I had to report back to work. Of course when we arrived, there was a short 20 minute wait for our party of 5. Our server had long brunette hair, and I think she mentioned she's half Japanese? I forgot her name, but she was great! I let her know I had to be back at work within the next 30 minutes and she pushed my food out immediately. I was able to enjoy some of my blueberry pancakes and head back to work on time. Although I didn't get to try much of the food, the service is what will bring me back. While we were waiting for our table the hostesses tried their best to seat us ASAP! Each staff member we encountered was very friendly and helpful. The team gave off an inviting vibe, and that's what I love about them most!"], ["L R.", "This place is a great spot for food and wine. \u00a0I am not much of a wine person, but they are very helpful and talk you through things, even if it is just one glass. \u00a0They have a constant menu and then a menu they change seasonally. \u00a0Everything is delicious, and this place is a cut above a regular chain restaurant, they have an actual chef and great kitchen staff, and great service. \u00a0I highly recommend making a reservation, because when it is busy, they do not compromise service and rush you. \u00a0Which is great. \u00a0 The biggest reason I love this place is that as a person with Celiac disease, my dining choices can be limited. \u00a0This place understands food allergies (one of the proprietors has celiac) and they have practices in place to feed you safely. \u00a0They have a dedicated fryer for gluten free items, so you can get many items made gluten free, and the best thing this place has is GF fried chicken!!! \u00a0While the menu calls it gluten friendly and has the usual disclaimer, the staff really does take care to make sure things are done properly. \u00a0The PB&J wings are a favorite of mine, too. \u00a0For dessert, the dark chocolate mousse is divine, and light enough on the stomach that it can still fit after all that food.The environment is set up like a dive bar kind of place. \u00a0Loud music with a jukebox, dim lighting, casually dressed servers and diners, but with the upscale food it is the perfect combination. \u00a0You will pay a few extra dollars for the food, but the service and quality are well worth it. \u00a0They also sell wine to-go, and host special brunches and dinners periodically.Also, free valet parking. \u00a0Something great to have in that area. \u00a0Next door is Barcadia, a nice place to check out, especially if you are out with friends."], ["Peter D.", "I don't even know where to begin. Some of the best service in Fort Worth. Great atmosphere. Amazing ros\u00e9. Even better Pinot. Even better food. fried chicken? Yes pls. If I could give 12 stars I would."], ["Becky K.", "I first experienced this charming place at a special Alice In Wonderland themed dinner a few months ago which was seriously the most fun I've ever had at a dinner event and an amazing, somewhat experimental spread as I understand... The whole event was incredibly creative and unique and I hope they continue on to make it a tradition! \u00a0I was so taken with the place that I came back shortly after for brunch and had a very generously sized egg sandwich - about the size of my head! :-) \u00a0It's a casual environment with classy food and very friendly staff - don't miss out on this gem!"], ["Patricia P.", "This is my second time coming in for brunch. Plan for a wait as they are very popular, unless you don't mind searching for a seat at the bar.First time I came in, I was sad to find out that their chicken is breaded in a jalape\u00f1o flour mix (I am very allergic to jalape\u00f1os). Our waitress went through all my options on the menu, but I have to admit I was really looking forward to trying the fried chicken I had heard so much about. But The executive chef even came out to talk to me about my allergy and my options and apologized that the chicken was also marinated in jalape\u00f1o buttermilk, and could not be made without it.Last time I tried the max & cheese. Food was ok, service was great. The girl who served us was very sweet & helped me so much finding something I could eat. However the food was a little underwhelming & I didn't feel a strong pull to come back. After seeing a magazine article & the Tiramisu French Toast I had to come back! Tiramisu is my weakness. Sat at the bar this time & Crystal took care of me. I was very excited about the French toast but was disappointed. They didn't taste anything like Tiramisu. They were good, but not what I had anticipated. Maybe if I was able to eat the chicken (which I've been told really is amazing) I would feel differently. Or maybe it's also because the only times I've come in have been on a really busy brunch. But for my rating I give 4 stars for the service and 1 star for the food. Maybe things will be different next time? The service is definitely worth coming back & searching for something to love on the menu. And in the meantime I can sip on some great mimosas."], ["Adam C.", "Great service, horrible food (for the price). \u00a0Start with the bad.PB&J wings: \u00a0Didn't work. \u00a0Loved the sound and thought it could be pulled off. \u00a0Tasted like PB wings that were missing a LOT of J (or some other flavor to offset the PB). \u00a0Was my meal, and I ate 3 of the 6.Grilled Cheese with Tomato Soup: \u00a0Very thick bread with a little cheese, so you really couldn't taste the cheese at all. \u00a0Just buttery bread. \u00a0The tomato soup tasted very basic. \u00a0I'm sure it was tomato sauce, cream and basil with spices, or very close to that. \u00a0Nothing special.Grill redfish: \u00a0Very basic and not cooked well. \u00a0Falling apart tender, as if it were cooked in a lot of liquid rather than searing and finishing off in oven.Fried Chicken: \u00a0Collard greens not good. \u00a0Mashed potatoes great. \u00a0Fried chick was phenomenal! \u00a0If I go back there, it will be only for the fried chicken. \u00a0Very tasty.Overall, extremely underwhelmed. \u00a0Decent wine selection but I expected more considering they ONLY serve wine and a few craft beers. \u00a0No liquor."], ["Cassie B.", "Finally had a chance to swing in for brunch this past weekend. The food was good, especially for the really reasonable price. The jalape\u00f1o cheddar grits almost had me doing a little dance because they were so tasty! Let's talk about the service. Even with a slight wait on food and our order being a little wrong the service was still amazing. We had a waiter in training backed up by an awesome waitress. They both were super friendly and apologetic when our order came out. I will definitely be back to this establishment and cannot wait to come in during the evening to try their menu!"], ["Tony G.", "I have visited Max's wine dive a few times always for brunch. All of my fellow yelpers had told me about this place with really great food. So I had this picture of a fancy wine bar in my head, complete with snooty wine peeps and everything. Bam to my surprise it was this quaint little Restraunt will a really chill vibe and good tunes coming from the jukebox. The staff is chill it is a fun atmosphere every one is just smiling and interacting. Now on many mission to the dive i found one big truth. You want to experience brunch at least once when the head chef is there. He seems to always have something up his sleeve that is not on the regular menu. The first visit was great. I was told to try the dreamsicle French toast and have to say this is very sound advice. It is two big slices of Texas toast fried up to perfection then cover in syrup and butter with orange infused marscapone that gives it a very special flavor. This is so good you need to eat it over and over. If you just want to try it order the children's portion nice and small and you still get the full experience. The brunch menu offers a lot of options. We tried the fried egg sandwich. Which is huge and can feed a small army. Perfect hangover food three eggs topped with tons of bacon cheese. This is awesome. Its has been so much fun frequenting this place that I am taking my folks there tomorrow."], ["Linda S.", "PB&J wings were awesome!! \u00a0They opened at bottle for me to \"share \" of Caymus Special Selection 2009 to enjoy with my wings. \u00a0Service was GREAT and very friendly."], ["Jenny T.", "Where do I even start... Found Max's Wine Dive from Yelp. Chose this place because of the delicious menu & the yummy looking Yelper's pics. We got: 3 Mimosas. Half portion of truffle Mac n Cheese. I am a pretty big fan of truffle and mac n cheese, so out them together and I'm in heaven. Half portion of Dreamsicle French Toast. My bf ate it so fast that I could barely taste it. So speaking for him, it was the BEST French toast that he has ever had! Even had to convince him not to get another order. Southern Fried Chicken w/ collard greens, home fries & Texas toast. I ordered this only bc of reading great reviews about it. This was absolutely the BEST fried chicken I have ever had! I'm not a big chicken person bc it typically comes out dry and bland but not this chicken. It was DELICIOUS!!! Collard greens were good but just borderline salty. Still really good so no need to complain. Two Eggs, bacon, jalape\u00f1o grits & toast. My boyfriend devoured his plate...in the midst of devouring mine. Eggs are eggs but they were cooked perfectly to his liking, over easy. OK, so I may sound a bit repetitive but the jalape\u00f1o grits were the BEST grits I've ever had and I don't even like grits!!!!Total Check: $53.04 I am so happy that I found this place. Thank you fellow Yelpers!!! Service was great, food was superb & atmosphere was nice. If I lived closer, I would most surely be a regular."], ["David G.", "This was on our list for a while and we finally decided to try it last Saturday night. Really glad we did. The atmosphere was great (a little crowded and a little small). The classic rock music playing low along with all the original artwork on the wall set a really laid back, fun mood. I was told comfort food and it was, and plentiful. My wife really liked the magnolia cheese board for an appetizer. She had the seared diver scallops for dinner and I had the bison meatloaf-wow! We shared the roasted cauliflower side, perfect. \u00a0We ordered a very reasonably priced bottle of wine \u00a0upon arrival and, unexpectedly, we were entertained with wine tastings throughout our meal. We found some great wines at wonderful prices to take home (a great bargain), and after all the tastings we still had the majority of our \u00a0original bottle left too.Also, I have to give a shout out to our waitress, Lauren. She went out of her way to make this a great evening for us.

We visited this location for Sunday brunch.

There was an seniorly couple on our left and a group of middle aged individuals on our left. A little loud but it's understandable because of the small space.I appreciated the variety on the menu. Some sweet options and some savory options as well. I ordered the pancakes with a side of fried chicken. My pancakes were semi-sweet, light and flavorful.

I arrived as soon as it opened on a Sunday, so I managed to beat the church crowd. The tiramisu French toast was creamy and delicious. It's definitely worth your time and money.

It would have been nice if the pasta entree came with some bread, especially because the sauce was really good!
