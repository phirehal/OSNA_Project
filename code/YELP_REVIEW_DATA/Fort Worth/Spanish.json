The beef enchilada and the chicken and spinach quesadilla, however, were both excellent. \u00a0Service was great, and my mother really liked their margarita (which she's sleeping off right now.) \u00a0For some reason, margaritas were only \u00a03 bucks this afternoon. \u00a0Definitely a great deal for great food. \u00a0I definitely plan on making Gloria's a regular stop for Tex-Mex. \u00a0There is a LOT of stuff on their menu that I still really want to try."], ["Bruce G.", "Gloria's has always been my go-to restaurant.

Gloria's now only has happy hour Monday thru Thursday. Come on, the place wasn't even half full. Sunday happy hour has always been a draw. Gloria's needs to reevaluate their marketing team because they really dropped the ball on this one. Well, needless to say, you lost a Sunday customer. I will be back.

The black bean dip tasted like... well... black beans but was otherwise nothing to write home about.I had the chile relleno with cheese and a cheese enchilada. It was a lot of cheese but I did enjoy it along with the sides of black beans, a tomato sauce, and rice. Another in my party had the grilled chicken breast, which was decently average.The menu states the chile con queso is $5 but it showed up on the check as $6.

We both got the tacos which are served with aides of chopped up onion, celantro, a black bean sauce, and a hot salsa.

Our server was great, and had genuine suggestions about the menu items. We tried the crab stuffed jalapenos which are wrapped in bacon. Apparently these are fairly new to the menu. They were good, but of course my husband boasted that his are better.... We enjoyed our experience so much that we came back the next day to enjoy the gorgeous weather on the rooftop patio. As the sun set, it got a little chilly. All of the tables near the heaters were taken. Our server saw me shivering, and had another brought out to our table. Also, another server overhead us talking about possibly catching a movie. He came back with many suggestions and movie times. 4 stars for top-notch customer service.

If you're having a private event, or just want a private group dinner, there are plenty of rooms and spaces for you to dine in. One of the most unique I find is in the center of the main dining room, and is accurately called the \"corazon.\" It's completely circular glass walls that divide you from the rest of the restaurant and it's like dining in a fish tank. On the rooftop is a private indoor geometric dome that you can also sit in and look at the starry night while dining on steaks, jalapeno corn bread muffins and the best tenderloin tamales you've ever had. The service here is wonderful and they really know their stuff. They're very helpful and hold flashlights up in the dimly lit dining space, as well as offer reading glasses to those who need them to read the menu. My issue here is the price. I don't find the food worth the price. I really don't think it's out of this world fantastic that everyone says it is. I often go here for business dinners, and I think that's really the only time I would really want to eat here."], ["Ileanna R.", "The food was very good.

The flavor was strong, but not bad if you like the taste of honey mustard; it paired very well with the mashed potatoes. He ordered a rib eye. We both ate everything and we weren't that hungry, it's just quality food! The asparagus that came with his steak was cooked perfectly, not too crunchy and not soggy, and they also gave him a roasted tomato stuffed with Parmesan and spinach.

That little tomato is packed with flavor; it's not just a garnish lol I really enjoyed my time here and look forward to trying more, they have a diverse menu and lots of dessert options! Oh one thing I did not enjoy was the starter bread. The mini cornbread tasted strange to me, I think it has jalape\u00f1os and cheese in it, and the biscuits were full of pecans. I am allergic to nuts, but my fianc\u00e9e also said he could do without the pecans in the bread. They gave me extra cornbread that hadn't touched the pecan bread which was really nice.

Atmosphere: I like the vibe here. It's un-assuming and one wouldn't guess that a chef-driven concept would be found in Keller, of all places. The music was at the perfect level, and the lighting wasn't too bright or too dim. About perfect. The decor is modern, but not uncomfortable. Cozy. Wine list: The wine list isn't what one would expect from a fine French restaurant, but offered a small range of decent wines. I was satisfied with our selection and the prices are reasonable. Especially on a monday, where bottles $45 and under are offered half-off. Cocktails: I began with FnG's signature old-fashioned, aptly labeled \"Best Damn Old-Fasioned\", if I recall correctly. And as the name suggests, they got it right. It's surprising how easy it is to ruin such an easy drink, yet Kyle and FnG's bar program really nailed it. Great job, Kyle. Service: the service was wonderful. My guest and I did not feel rushed or neglected. Our dishes arrived within the expected time frame and were as promised. Our server/bartender Kyle was fantastic, and non-intrusive. He was knowledgeable, knew the menu and didn't hesitate when asked to offer suggestions, which he did with gusto and confidence that is so rare in servers these days. Menu: the appetizers and salad/sandwich menu was the most diverse section of the menu. The entree/main course menu was surprisingly lacking, and offered little other than meat-heavy dishes. While I love steak/pork/fish options, it didn't reflect the creativity on which the rest of the restaurant is based. This was my ONLY caveat. The menu is well-designed and easy to navigate. Food: Both of our dishes were well-portioned and were delivered as promised. Not too much, not too little. The Steak Diane is wonderful, so is The Bomb Chicken. It's a shame the mussels are seasonal, because they were the best damn mussels I've ever had. Price: all things considered, the prices are wonderful. To a Chili's or Applebee's native, they may seem steep; but to diners who know and appreciate great food and service, they are considerably lower than other similarly-styled alternatives. Overall, I was very pleased (as was my guest) with FnG. The simple fact that my old-fashioned was crafted perfectly by Kyle is enough for me to rave over this restaurant. Check this place out.

I had a glass of duck horn Chardonnay was able to complete a little bit of work while hanging out at the bar before I got too \"brunchy\". The atmosphere was classy but not pretentious. Football on in the bar, a lot of families and locals I recognize from the grocery store. I ordered a bread pudding that the bartender recommended. It was great. The bartender suggested a fambois to go with it. I was stoked, I love fambois (raspberry desert wine) and didn't see it myself on the menu. He tried to lure me into it with a taste. I was sold on it before he offered it. I can't wait for my next visit. If you ever serve scallops or mussels please let me know, I'll drive from Austin to experience that. This place regardless of ownership and the name has always been a little gem.

I came for dinner and went with the bread with assorted toppings and the paella mixta. The bread was choose 3 out of 4, and we got the tomato marmalade and goat cheese, cheese, and salmon. Though all were tasty, the tomato marmalade was a bit sweet and was the best one out of the three. The paella was very good and definitely a filling option for 2 people. The paella mixta came with mussels, clams, fried chicken wings, pork, squid, shrimp, and scallops. It was really delicious. The rice was very savory and combined with the lemon juice made a winning combination. The meat/seafood was tender and tasty, but the pork was a bit dry and the shrimp overcooked. A very good paella though, overall. One minor complaint that I have is that I had to ask for the complimentary bread basket, and when it came out, I also had to request for olive oil. I thought it was strange that I had to request both, seems like they both should have come out without me asking. FYI - the balsamic vinegar is an extra charge.Service was good, and if the weather is nice, do yourself a favor and sit outside!"], ["Lisa P.", "Perfection. Every single thing. The house sangria.

Si Tapas gets 5 stars from me because it's absolute perfection...if you're looking for an amazing Spanish food experience in Dallas, you've got to come here!The location is a little hidden -- it's a tiny house that's sort of tucked away into a neighborhood in uptown, so you've got to really look for it! We walk in for dinner on a Saturday night around 8ish with no reservations and are quickly greeted and seated into a cozy little nook in the back room with a beautiful view of their cute, little garden patio. Our server is quick to greet us and we order a bottle of Rioja and decide to split the seafood paella. Food is brought out quickly and there's fresh bread waiting on the table for us. The paella is absolutely magnificent!! Plenty of seafood -- shrimp, mussels, scallops, squid and octopus. The flavors were all there and my husband and I devoured our entree completely. Everyone around us was enjoying themselves, and with good reason! Prices are really reasonable, the atmosphere is wonderful and made me feel like I was in a little cafe somewhere in Spain. The lighting was dark and romantic and there was a Spanish guitar playing from their speakers with different scenes of Spain showing on their flat screen TVs. I was in heaven. We'll definitely be back!"], ["Stacy Y.", "The restaurant itself is super cute, but also super hard to find. Look for the place that looks like a small house with an OPEN sign in the window! And once we walked in, the ambience was really romantic with dim lights and lovely music.The food, however, was a little underwhelming. We decided against ordering the sangria (which has no fruit in it) and got the Agua de Valencia instead, which was delicious but definitely on the sweet side. Between four of us, we shared seafood paella, seared tuna with fresh pepper, sirloin steak in Cabrelas sauce, and grilled pork tenderloin with herbs. The paella was definitely the highlight--it had a bunch of clams and shrimp and scallops, and was so so tasty. The rest of the dishes were so-so and very small plates. The tuna was nothing special, the steak was mediocre, and the grilled pork was borderline bad; it tasted like generic grilled meat. The amount of food was in no way enough for us, but we just decided to eat somewhere else afterward to avoid racking up a huge bill.I'd probably come back for the ambience for a date night or something, but I would not come back for the food."], ["Marissa L.", "Wandered around Uptown last night in search of a bite to eat after an event.

Overall, it was a positive dining experience. Service was good; but since we came at an odd time (right when they open on Sunday), we were the only ones there. Prices were a little high, just like any other tapas place. I would recommend trying this place out if you have the budget."], ["Mark C.", "Quaint (almost to the point of being hard to find) but very cramped. Come here on a Friday or Saturday night and you're going to wait a good long while. That's not to say it's a bad thing given the ambiance, but given how small the location is you might be better off sitting outside while you wait for your name to be called. Once seated, the menu is incredibly extensive although lacking in some places (No Dolmades?) . If anything the portion sizes were a little large to be called tapas, with a few of the dishes being almost as big as an entire meal for one. As the night led on and the place got busier, it was easy to see the kitchen struggled a little. And while tapas is meant for conversing there were more than a few tables where the occupants had far too much to drink and were loud enough to affect other guests. If you are looking for quiet dining, you are not going to get it here. Period. That's a shame, because this would be an ideal place to be a romantic restaurant. It's even set out and arranged to be one, but unfortunately the whole place comes across like a bar. Fortunately the overall quality of food made up for it. You certainly wont leave hungry!"], ["Tamara N.", "Great food. The red beats and goat cheese is one of my favorite tapas. House sangria is red.

At first, we was skeptical about the exterior but once you open those doors, you will be surprise at the crowd. We was seated and thought that the table might be a little small for our huge appetite. However, that did not phase us because the food came out so fast and we had some sort of logistic down. Highly recommend the seared tuna, scallop, lamb chops, white rice w/ tomato sauce and egg, and the alcoholic cane pitcher drink. Honorable mentions to the fried shark meat and shrimp in garlic.I will definitely come back the next time I am in Dallas."], ["Eddie C.", "For me personally, this place is normally 3 stars. The food is good, but outside of happy hour, I think it is just a tad too expensive for what you get. With that said, this place is very good for happy hour, and since I only come during this time, I am going to bump it up to 4 stars for the review. During happy hour, there is a wide array of tapas to choose from, all of which are only $3. In addition to the food, $12 pitchers are available. These drinks aren't very strong, but they are quite refreshing! Very good on a hot day! The Agua de Valencia is probably my favorite, but the Sangria and Echegaray are also good. For food, my go-to's are the fried calamari, garlic shrimp, and potatoes with Spanish chorizo. The ambiance is very nice for the area. This is an old house converted into a restaurant, situated right across the street from The Nodding Donkey. If you sit in the backyard, you will be greeted with a nice view of our beautiful Dallas Skyline. This place is usually pretty quiet making it ideal for dates. Overall, solid tapas place, but try to come during happy hour if you can."], ["Tiffany D.", "Absolutely \u00a0love this place.

It was incredibly peaceful with a large grassy area and a view of downtown.It was happy hour at the time. We got a pitcher of sangria for 12$. It was really good sangria. We also ordered meat and cheese tray with salami, chorizo, manchego, and smoked \u00a0cheese. It was delicious; exactly like i remember \u00a0in Spain. An order of the papas bravas which were very good and the sauces were homemade. \u00a0An order of the calamari which was lightly fried to perfection, \u00a0slightly salty, and delicious. The garlic \u00a0shrimp which were very garlicky, fresh, and cooked perfectly. \u00a0And lastly 2 orders of the montaditos with the sobrasada, smoked salmon, goat cheese with tomatoe \u00a0marmalade, \u00a0and a cabrales cream cheese one. The salmon was smoky and tender. It melted in your mouth. \u00a0The goat cheese and jam one was sweet and savory. \u00a0The cabrales cream was creamy and had a very unique flavor profile. Lastly, the sobrasada \u00a0which is a greasy, savory, delicious, \u00a0sausage that is almost like a pepperoni spread; One of my favorites actually. \u00a0The bread was also amazing. Perfectly toasted and freshly baked. Everything was amazing and would order it all again.

This is also one of the few restaurants that I have been to that serves Estrella. They have amazing tapas during happy hour. You should try them all! My favorite is the Papas con chorizo (potatoes), Ocra frita con sal de mar y curry (fried okra), Gambas al ajillo (shrimp and garlic), and Judias verdes con jamon (green beans and ham).

The menu has a LOT to it, but the waiter was incredibly knowledgeable - in a helpful way, not condescending at all. We decided to order a little bit at a time, which was a real help to having too many plates on the table at once. We began with some ham and cheese - served with super-fresh bread - and some olives. We moved into the pork tenderloin with onions (OMG - so good), the meatballs (yum), the cod fritters (fabulous), the cauliflower gratin (amazing), and a little \"sampler\" of the smoked salmon, tomato marmalade, and cheese on toast (SO GOOD). Hubby and friend split a bottle of $18 wine and loved it. THEN...because we hadn't quite stuffed ourselves...we ordered delicious little coffees (\"cortado\" - like little lattes) and dessert. Hubby got the house made ice cream which was very good, and friend and I split the delicious chocolate mousse which would have been enough to split three ways after all the other food! This was a wonderful experience and one of the best meals I've had in a long time. We will be back!PS - during the day, apparently, you can park in the school lot across the street.

My wife had been to Si Tapas before, but this was my first rodeo. Our waiter was super friendly and gave great, quick service. I also thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere, which was both simple and inviting at the same time. Since the general idea behind tapas is to try a bunch of different things, I think it's easiest to review the food in list form.1. Echegaray Cava white sangria: The sangria was light and crisp, which was a perfect pairing for a hefty meal.2. Serrano ham croquettes: They were creamy, delicious, and very tasty. Croquettes are one of my favorite tapas picks.3. Fried calamari with poppy seeds: The batter was nice and light, and they were fried perfectly. I didn't find just an abundance of flavor, and I'm not sure how much the poppy seeds added either.4. Shrimp in garlic: Not surprisingly, the garlic stood out the most here. The shrimp were cooked well at least.5. Fried pork belly with chocolate sauce: Fantastic! The chocolate went really well with the pork for some reason. The extra-crisp batter also made this dish extra delicious!6. Veal sweetbreads with capers in lemon sauce: I found just the right amount of lemon, which paired nicely with the velvety meat.7. Fried blood sausage: Although only for the brave, this dish was really flavorful.8. Fried Okra with sea salt and curry. The okra was, as you might expect, nicely salty. The curry was an interesting twist, though I would have liked more of it.9. Baby lamb chops on the grill: There was a nice sear on the meat, which was also very juicy. I think some black pepper would have made these even better.10. Sirloin Steak in cabrales sauce: I found a big punch of bleu cheese here. The meat was very rare, which made it really tender.11. Beef meatballs: The meat was incredibly tender, but the sauce strangely reminded me of Chef Boyardee.As if that wasn't enough food to tide the four of us over, we couldn't resist tacking on some dessert. It was hard to pick just one, but we eventually settled on the Spanish Tempranillo red wine chocolate cake. This was an excellent dessert! The red wine added a nice bitterness to the whole thing, and it's hard to compete with chocolate. There were a few parts of the meal that could have been a little better, but overall I left extremely satisfied."], ["Lee R.", "Si Tapas was a pleasant surprise. Enjoyed several tapas dishes and some \"mixta\" paella but particularly enjoyed a pork loin and caramelized onion bruschetta, crispy fried okra, and a very tasty potato omelette of sorts.Service was fine although we did have problems being understood by the Iberian waiter, even though one of us speaks Spanish as a native language.Our table in the far corner of a glassed-in back porch was the best in the house, especially on a very rainy evening. The wine selection was simple but agreeableHowever, a table of six women next to us had been hitting the sangria a bit too long and the noise volume in the room was at the occasionally-shoot-them-a-dirty-look level (which was not effective).What is it about braying, inebriated women at Dallas restaurants, anyway?"], ["Olivia R.", "Some of their tapas are really good, they tend to cheat a little on their cheese boards by putting salami, hams and cheeses that are not the ones you order, hoping that the customer won't notice.

To be completely honest, the food to me was just okay. Nothing that was mind blowing to say the least. I liked the montaditos the most probably just because of the variety in the plate. Like everyone said about the shrimp, it's nothing special but the sauce is delicious (great for dipping the complimentary bread in). Papas con chorizo was a bit disappointing to me because I felt the chorizo was a bit burnt. The fried okra was really good though, and this is coming from someone who doesn't normally like okra. Sangria is great, and us two girls downed that pitcher like no other. For $12 each, I think this place is totally worth it!

They serve bread, but do not carry butter. According to the manager Francisco, it does not follow \"traditional\" Spanish culture because in Spain, the people only eat butter with breakfast.3. There are no substitutions allowed. This is the result of a pretentious chef or owner. \u00a0According to the manager Francisco, they do not allow subs because it takes away from the \"traditional Spanish recipes\" that they have. \u00a0I understand where they are coming from, but the problem is, the customer is paying money for their meal and if they want to sub goat cheese for manchega cheese - then LET THEM!

It's a very small place, once the inside is full, you'll be seated on the patio. We ordered a pitcher of echegaray, which tasted like a mojito with a strong lime taste. We ordered 6 plates... Seared tuna, fresh scallops, pork belly with chocolate sauce, clams with wine sauce, potato omelette, and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert!"], ["Capree V.", "Valentines Day dinner was exquisite!

Nonetheless, we enjoyed some drinks out on the chilly but lovely patio before getting a table inside. There, we proceeded to destroy a selection of tapas, including croquetas de bacalao, some choice montaditos, fried okra (just like back in querida Espana), tortilla espanola, and delicious pulpo. The only weak spot in our selection was some fried pork in a chocolate sauce, which was our last dish and way to rich for me at that point... everything else was amazing! As a bonus, they even had tinto de verano on the menu, although it wasn't \"verano\" enough outside for me to order. When the bill came, the difference between LA and Dallas became immediately apparent- all of this food + drinks came out to ~$15 per person. Amazing."], ["Lindsey H.", "Wow. I LOVE this place. Such a quaint little restaurant hidden in a row of houses. The atmosphere is fantastic, definitely romantic in the evening time. The food is delicious, and reasonablly priced.

As for food, we recommend Gambas al ajillo (shrimp in garlic), Papas con chorizo (potatoes saut\u00e9 with Spanish chorizo), Ocra frita con sal de mar y curry (fried okra w/ sea salt & curry) and of course the Paella is a MUST. \u00a0We love dipping their freshly made and super soft complimentary french bread with the oil from the shrimp in garlic and potatoes saut\u00e9 with Spanish chorizo.

This place lived up to the high reviews. We got there about 7:00pm. There were tables open outside, but it was incredibly hot & humid so we opted to wait for a table inside. We waited about 15 minutes and had a drink (get the sangria, it was amazing!) until we were taken to a table in the back. It was small, and dimly lit, and just perfect. Our waitress was friendly & efficient. We ordered drinks and perused the menu. The menu had a LOT to offer and it took us a while to decide. We ultimately decided on 6 items: the shrimp & garlic, the shark, the pepper crusted ahi tuna, the brussels sprouts, marinated mushrooms & fried okra (we were hungry...)The only thing that was a let down was the mushrooms, which was disappointing since we're mushroom fanatics. They had very little flavor. All you could taste was the red wine the mushrooms were marinated in. Everything else was amazing. -The shark tasted like salt & pepper catfish, intensified. The flavor was strong and delicious. The texture wasn't as flaky as most fish, It was much more substantial.-The shrimp and garlic was AMAZING. There was some type of chili in the garlicky broth, and it gave it a very slow moving heat. The shrimp were perfect, and the leftover broth was amazing when we dipped the warm house bread in it. I wanted like 6 more bowls of this. - The tuna: AMAZING. It was lightly seared with a peppercorn crust. The tuna was served with olive oil & lemon and was perfect. The lemon accented the fish, instead of being a prominent flavor. The tuna was so tender and tasted so fresh. -The brussels sprouts were amazing. They were also tossed with horseradish, It wasn't a combination that I would have thought of, but the flavors worked so well together. I would have been happy eating this all day. -The okra was good. I honestly don't like okra, but I read that you HAD to order it. Graham loves it, so we had it. It wasn't 'fried okra' like I've ever had before. It seemed more like it was roasted. It didn't have a heavy breading on it, and it wasn't slimy. It was crunchy and had a fantastic flavor. I am SO glad we ended up here for my birthday dinner. The restaurant had a ton of character, the staff was friendly and the food was amazing, and the prices were amazing. The tuna & shark were the most expensive items at about $9 each. The only negative was the blah plating. Everything was just tossed in a bowl, and had no presence. As busy as they were though, it didn't bother me too much. Just made for bad food pictures =("], ["Kristen S.", "Really tasty food, very pretty ambiance and the waitstaff was incredibly friendly and attentive! The Happy Hour is a great deal! $4 sparkling wine and $3 tapas? How can you not give it a try?

So yay for both of us! After my gyro, I somehow mustered the space to order a scoop of their Turkish Coffee ice cream which I crave to this day. I'm not one for coffee but this one was the right texture and authentic. Lord have mercy, I'm so big on texture. And this ice cream was smooth and had coffee grinds in it which gave it this complimenting graininess. It was only $2 for the scoop but it was a really small scoop.

The lamb legs came with the bone but the meat melted right off. Lamb tends to be a little on the chewy side so having it slow cooked was an interesting experience.

They will have meat and cooked veg options, the veg options don't make me feel too guilty. I usually end with fresh fruit. I always try a little bit of everything and it's always so good. I've been to other restaurants like this kind, but this one is by far my favorite. You can tell love has been prepared with the dishes put out. This is my new favorite spot."], ["Emmy F.", "LOVE this place! My coworkers and I work in the medical district and love to order delivery from this place but last night we decided to dine in when we found out they have a bar and hookah too. The service was excellent, the food delicious and flavorful, and all in a delightful atmosphere! We were happy to see Bradley as he had delivered food to us at work, and he's just as awesome as a waiter giving us everything we asked for and super pleasant. They have Mediterranean and Italian food, which I didn't think go together but it's nice to have both options in one place I suppose.Appetizers - I've had the Garlic Bread with mozzarella cheese, meatballs (3 large meatballs in marinara sauce), and hummus (served with 2 pita breads). All of them are delicious but probably my favorite is the garlic bread and cheese, sooooo yummy! Entrees come with garlic knots which are also good, but cheese makes everything better.Cocktails I tried were pomegranate Cosmo, watermelon mojito (which taste exactly as it's name) and something with midori and pineapple which was ridiculously sweet and my friend described as drinking the beach. I like my sweet martinis so the Pom Cosmo was perfect. They also have a decent beer selection and have a normal bar as well. Entrees - I ordered the heavenly chicken... Which is super awesome! Stuff chicken with cream cheese and penne pasta mixed in a creamy Alfredo sauce topped with spinach and chopped bacon. PERFECT. Love hands down. My friends ordered the grilled salmon, penne a la vodka, and kabob trio which they all thoroughly enjoyed too.Dessert - they offered us their pomegranate and Rose ice cream. Of course we were like, \"what does rose taste like?\" And it literally taste like the smell of a rose. I can't describe it any other way but it was good! So try it if you're curious, it's definitely worth it! Oh and the pom was good too. Hookah was pretty basic, they only had about 3 flavors but the owner was more than happy to bring flavors if we asked for next time. Lounge area/patio was nice and they had the big heater lamps to keep us warm and toasty. I also appreciated the random Indie rock station they had playing (they know what I like lol) The owner also approached our table and was extremely appreciative and super nice and friendly to us! I really love seeing that in family restaurants! Makes me feel much more welcomed and wanting to come back! For a Friday night we got a table for 8 at 8pm seated within 5min. So order delivery or make your way here. Either way you will enjoy it!"], ["Jason T.", "My wife and I with our two kids (2 yrs and 4 months old) went for the Saturday dinner buffet and it was good, but not great. They had a variety of food including lamb, crab legs, baked tilapia, 3 selection of hummus, pizza, heavenly chicken and salad. The quality was not the best of what we experienced in the past. \u00a0What they didn't have much were fruits (only grapes, pineapples, and strawberries), and desert. For a buffet, we think they should have more options in those categories.Unfortunately, they did not have any juice for our daughter. The price was $18 which was a bit steep for the amount of food they had. We thought we should have order from the menu. The atmosphere was nice with friendly service and they had a patio if you want to eat outside. We have not tried the lunch buffet yet. The lunch price might match the food they have much better than the dinner buffet."], ["Christie P.", "The lunch buffet at Chadra is AWESOME!!! Definitely go on Thursday when they serve the Heavenly Chicken, and bring lots of breath mints since those garlic knot rolls are absolutely amazing!

Their pizza crust is always fresh and chewy."], ["Melondy D.", "As a picker eater, I was nervous about trying this place. I had the lunch buffet with my husband and fell in love. The food was amazing and so was the service. I liked the something-vodka penne, the garlic knots, and the assortment of different meats. My husband enjoyed the endless pizza, lol. I loved the decor and overall atmosphere. I enjoyed it so much I went the next week with a co-worker who was already into this place. I'll see you guys next week!"], ["Meredith R.", "After craving eggplant and reading the yelp reviews, I decided to try the lunch buffet.

There were plenty of meat dishes and several pizzas to try as well (but \u00a0I'm a vegetarian and have been staying away from cheese lately so I didn't try). Everything I has was extremely fresh. But the baba ghanoush needed something. That was my only tiny complaint.Besides everything on the buffet looking fresh and appetizing, it's also labeled so you don't have to guess.

My friend had saved me half a sandwich after I got off the plane in Texas and I was grossed out that it was chicken salad. He assured me it was the best sandwich he had ever tasted so I tried it. And it was the best sandwich I had ever had. I go to the Lunch Box solely for the chicken salad but I'm sure the other things are great. I like to eat there best and have it warmed up on marbled rye.

I don't care for chicken salad but I expect the other items on the menu to still be worth my money. As with the other places, I was disappointed again. I got a turkey sandwich that I could have made at home. Regular sandwich bread, a heap of turkey that looked like the same turkey I just got from the Kroger deli and an extra charge for cheese. It also came with chips and a pickle. The poppy seed dressing is ok, it's growing on me. More recently I had the quiche, which was sub par (and I loves me some quiche), that had very cheap tasting cheese on top. Meh.

That is exactly how The Lunchbox is for me. I have been dining at this perfectly quaint lunch spot ever since I can remember. After going through several well established Fort Worth owners, the Lunchbox has not changed a bit since its debut in 1974, even the original yellow and green interior adds to your luncheon experience. Fort Worth natives flock to this restaurant for their homestyle sandwiches, homemade soups and the best pies in town. The chicken salad recipe continues to be a Fort Worth mystery and the topic of several past conversations that I have had with friends or local chefs/restaurant owners - people are crazy over this stuff and rightfully so! When this particular chicken salad becomes the topic of conversation people tend to get into debates over what makes up the delicious concoction - everything but the kitchen sink is what I say but have yet to find someone that can perfect the recipe. Oh, and don't bother asking the owners or waitresses because its a close kept secret - all of that aside, its definitely the best chicken salad I have ever had, and I am a bit of a chicken salad snob. The Lunchbox is also famous for their homemade poppyseed dressing that literally sits in what might as well be vats on every table in the place, you see it going on everything from fruit salad, sandwiches, chips and heaping scoops of that incredible chicken salad, which is my personal favorite application! This hometown favorite is tucked away in the 6333 shopping center on Camp Bowie and very well hidden, you have to walk between two shops, almost to the back of the center down a paved alley to get to it, if you are new to the area you probably have no idea that this place or opening in the shopping center exists but get with a Fort Worth native and see what its all about! The Lunchbox just feels like family, you can see the owners here everyday with their smiling faces, seating people, checking you out and taking orders. I'm always running into local \u00a0acquaintances and love seeing familiar faces each time I dine here, which is pretty often, but I love knowing that some of these people have been dining here for years and years with standing lunch dates.

The hot sauce that greeted us is where we fell in love! We couldn't get enough of it! I ordered the (seasonal) Bean Soup with Jalapeno Cornbread and a side salad with house dressing, and my friend ordered the Enchilada Soup with a side salad; both were fantastic (we shared each others' soups)!

It doesn't look like much on the outside, but it's nicely decorated on the inside.Mariposa is another hidden gem off of Camp Bowie. It's tucked away in a strip center with Rocco's Pizza behind Mexican Inn. Mariposa's is ran by mother and daughter, Crystal. Freshly made food with fresh ingredients. Mariposa's started off as a catering company and they become popular so they opened up a restaurant. They have been there for 3 years! They have a very small menu. Mini tacos, tacos, enchiladas, tamales, ceviche, and salads. I ordered the mini tacos. One of each: Pork, Beef, and Roasted Chicken. The husband got Tacos. I don't remember which ones, but I do remember the beef fajita being one of them. He said the beef was a little tough. We started off with the dip trio. It was queso, guacamole, and queso with cuban rice. I absolutely loved the queso with cuban rice. Just give me the cuban rice queso and I'll be fine.The guacamole was really good too. The salsa is mild and limey. Don't expect it to be spicy.Be warned, if you come here for the tacos these aren't your normal tacos like in most restaurants here with soft flour tortillas. They fry their flour tortilla first. It's more of a tostada type taco and is not easily folded over like a taco. \u00a0I still enjoyed mine. They were really good, especially the pork.My husband and I talked to Crystal the daughter for nearly an hour after they closed for lunch. Really a nice family. They are not known for their tacos, which we figured because almost everyone there was eating an enchilada or a tamale. These tamales are HUGE. I'm walking to the bathroom looking at all the plates and I'm like wow, those tamales are gigantic! No wonder they are almost $10. Man, they looked so good though.Crystal said they want to have more Latin inspired dishes than Mexican inspired. She said starting in September (or soon, I could be wrong with the month) that they are going to choose a Latin American country and make the dish as a special.Every now and then they have a 4 course dinner special with Latin Ballroom dancing or Salsa dancing. How fun would that be?Also, during the holidays starting in November they make a turkey and dressing tamale with cranberry sauce on top and sweet potato souffle on the side. At first I was like WHAT? The more I think about it the more I want one. I bet it's awesome. Lol.Oh! Tamale classes. Every now and then they will offer Tamale making cooking classes. They give you the ingredients. YOU do everything, they just instruct you. Sounds fun as well.You just have to watch for all of the stuff they do/offer on their Facebook. Mariposa's has the potential to be big. Such a sweet place and nice family.So, remember come from the Tamales and Enchiladas. The tacos are good, I'm just telling you what to go for since they are known for those two.Now that I say all that, I think it's time I try a tamale to find out how good they are myself."], ["Jessica N.", "I really enjoyed the beauty and simplicity of this restaurant! Their decor is fresh and simple, their service was great, and their food was tasty.I got a free mini taco with my check-in (yessssssssssss!!) and it was delectable! I then ordered the pork tamale grande and attempted to eat the entire thing. \u00a0That thing is absolutely massive. \u00a0It was less of a tamale and more of a meat log - it was packed with delicious pork! I only got through half of it, needless to say, and was stuffed! \u00a0I had a big of a tummy ache after eating this meal, which makes me give it only 3 stars. \u00a0My friend, who had the same dish, also experienced the same thing. \u00a0It could have been that we aren't used to eating that much meat or something else. \u00a0No one else had problems, though, which makes me hopeful that the next time I come to Mariposa's I will have no problems whatsoever.I want to return and try some other menu items and get a better idea of what all this cute place has to offer!"], ["Andrew S.", "This place is solid.

Both of us ordered the Wednesday lunch special which was the ginger pork empanada plate. This plate came with 3 massive pork empanadas, cuban rice and plantains -- it was AMAZING! Each empanada was full of moist, juicy shredded pork and served with a gingery gravy on the side which was a perfect compliment. The cuban rice was absolutely delicious... a little greasy but full of flavor!! The plantains were good, as well but not the best that I've had.

A group of six of us made it over to their newly minted location and it is a cool little place with a nice open floor plan (by Szechuan for those that need a good point of reference).For me, the best thing about Mariposa's are their tamales. Let me say these aren't your grandmother's tamales. They are massive, stuffed with meat, and very unique. My brother I think is still in awe of the one he ordered. You just do not see this type of attention to tamales in DFW.Since I had tasted their roasted chicken tamale (The Girlfriend went on to order it), I went with the jalapeno cheddar, along with a pork taco and a beef fajita taco. Another cool aspect about Mariposa's is that you are not even forced to order an entree! You can order everything individually, hence my three choices. The pork taco was solid and I really liked the jalapeno cheddar tamale too, especially the chipotle sauce. Like the others it is massive and filling. The beef on the beef fajita taco was really interesting because it had a sort of reddish crust on it, kind of like \u00a0that of pork dishes served at chinese restaurants. This unique featured made it quite tasty, I might add. I still say the roasted chicken tamale is my favorite. Stuffed with chicken and slathered in pablano sauce and cheese, it is hard to beat. So, if you are craving tamales, make Mariposa's your tamale place. It is definitely mine."], ["Ashleigh D.", "Oh Mariposas, you have so much potential! When you walk into the strip center restaurant, you are transported into a vintage, antique-like, boho-chic dining area. It's adorable and colorful, and is lined with hand painted murals and metal sculptures. I felt right at home with the friendly service and atmosphere. When we were first seated and received our menus my first impression was that this menu was VERY small and limited. You can get a taco, tamale or enchilada for $10 with rice and beans. Mexican favorites or course, but I just felt more options would really make the place pop! We ordered chips and guacamole with our salsa and $10 margaritas. These margaritas are supposedly made with this special tequila that \"is way better than Patron,\" our waitress bragged. Upon receiving our order (quickly, I may add) the guacamole was flavorless, and the salsa tasted like Pace. The margaritas were excellent and I love the tall glasses they come in (in fact I liked all the presentation of food and drink in this restaurant), I just wish the margs were a little cheaper. Perhaps a happy hour is needed. When you check in here on Yelp, you get a free mini taco. So we showed our waitress the check-in and got a beef mini taco. Wow! The flavors were amazing. The meat was juicy and sort of melted in your mouth. I wish I ordered that as a main meal, but instead I got a single tamale (they are really big, think chili relleno big). It was decent, but tasted like it was topped with the enchilada sauce you buy in a can with melted cheddar cheese on top. No juicy meat inside this baby, it was dry and mostly corn starch. As for the enchiladas, they are nothing special. With an abundance of Mexican food and Mexican chains, I was excited to try a \"Latin\" kitchen. When I think of Latin cuisine I don't think of beef tamales, chicken enchiladas, and beef tacos. Also, when comparing to all of the Mexican food we have in the DFW, I would put this quality on the lower end of the spectrum of GOOD Mexican."], ["Catherine Z.", "A small restaurant with friendly staff.
