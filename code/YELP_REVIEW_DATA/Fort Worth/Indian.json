Tried goat curry and biryani thinking that they may not go wrong at least in the basic Indian delicacy, my prediction was wrong. Meat was half cooked in a way that we can smell the rawness of the meat.And the desert, they had rock solid rasagulla, which in general is the one of the most fluffy Indian desert.The only thing that was good is gulabjamun.I would never ever step in there again."], ["Sergio M.", "It was ok, well, not even ok.

I can't remember ordering much else, but it was always a great dish.I remember eating the lunch buffet once or twice, but, luckily I had the presence of mind to suggest it when a friend from Grapevine wanted to meet me halfway to Dallas. I'd been wanting to gorge on an Indian buffet for quite a while, but find it hard to make it to Richardson, Irving, or Arlington, where my favorite Indian restaurants are.It was everything I wanted and then some. The butter chicken and mutter paneer were delicious curries. On the weekends they bring you a dosa... don't forget the mild green sauce that goes well with them, located in the buffet. There were other dishes, all delightful, that I can't name, and the warm rice pudding was delicious. For $11.99, the buffet was well worth it."], ["Sarath P.", "The weekend lunch buffet was ok. I enjoyed the vegetarian dishes more than the meat dishes that were offered, although the goat curry was really good and spicy.

It's a giant crepe that's crispy and stuffed with masala potatoes, onions, peas and carrots. Pasand serves theirs with a coconut chutney but I tend to swirl mine in tamarind chutney because I like that tartness to cut through the richness of the crepe. Wow! It's so good!!!On Sat and Suns they've got a lunch buffet going on and it's not too bad. You get a complimentary dosa with your buffet. It comes with a good variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian items. I personally think ordering from the menu is better than the buffet. When it comes to Indian buffets, I still think that Mayuri has the best lunch buffet as there's more to choose from.

Why go to a Nepalese restaurant for Indian food?Momos are Nepalese meat dumplings. They're very unique because of the spices used. There's fried and steamed. Both are good. Try them with chili too.For an introduction to Nepalese food, try the platters. There are 3 platters - Nepali, Newari, and Thakali. A combination of the Newari and Thakali should be a good start.There are too many items on the platter. Most of them sound foreign so I can't spell them. Just know that there are organ meats on one of them. I love organ meats.I was told that there are weekend specials that need to be called in because of the prep time. That seriously piqued my interest. Will definitely RTE."], ["Eldric B.", "Based on my experience tonight, I seriously gotta wonder if this was the same restaurant that was given 5-star reviews by other users, or if I had accidentally gone to another restaurant operating under the same name.The ambience left alot to be desired - my party was seated in an area between two hanging television sets, and we were constantly having to talk over the Planet Bollywood program in order to hear one another. The noise level was so loud, that we had to flag down a member of staff to get it turned down to a semi-acceptable level, 10 minutes after we were seated and our order taken. Why they didn't have some mellow music playing instead is beyond me...Foodwise, it was more miss and less hit - the momos and garlic naan were good, but the chicken tikka marsala and curry goat were definitely big misses! Based on previous reviews we expected large \"Texas Sized\" portions - nope, not here. My chicken tikka marsala was a chopped up half an overcooked chicken breast laying at the bottom of a bowl and a cup and a half of tomato-based sauce. I spent most of the dinner dredging the bottom of the bowl with my fork, looking for ANY pieces that I might've missed, because I couldn't believe the lack of meat! The dish itself wasn't at all spicy, yet I had asked for medium - so I had expected at least SOME spiciness. My dad's curried goat was more bone (3 LARGE bones) than meat, and what meat there was was hard to chew. I've been to places where they slow-cooked the meat till it just falls apart because it is so tender, but this....not so much! Had to sit and watch the poor guy struggle to scrape any meat off the bone with his fork, JUST so he could eat! Lastly, if you want anything to drink, stick with water - $1.50 for a can of soda and even then, 1) not what I asked for (a diet soda of ANY kind - they brought me a regular Sprite), JUST arbitrarily what was available, \u00a0and 2) no refills - I wasn't even offered one.

Dikchhya recommended mango lassi at the beginning of the meal, so we got a couple of those. They were flavorful, just the right amount of sweet. Next she brought out some masala papad as an appetizer and those were the tastiest I've ever had. The vegetable samosas came out and according to Dikchhya, they were freshly made from scratch. The taste definitely reflected that fact. Then Dikchhya brought out a sample of momo, a favorite of the Nepalese, free of charge. She brought two vegetarian ones and two chicken ones. I preferred the chicken, but the vegetarian one was also good. Again, you could tell she loved to share her culture with new customers. Our entrees came out soon after trying the momo, and they were perfectly spiced. My medium-spicy chicken tikka masala and garlic naan were delicious and although I felt like I ate a lot, the food kept multiplying. For the price, the portion sizes were great. Dikchhya made sure our water was always filled (that is very important to me) and said the next time we came, she would guide us through Nepalese cuisine, since neither of us has ever had it.

Their lunch thali comes with 3 different curries, rice, different kinds of naan (a crunchy one, one with onions, and a regular one), a soup, another side item, and 2 desserts. I picked the potato curry, egg curry, and mushroom masala. They were all delicious, but my favorite was the egg curry because it wasn't spicy and had more of a tomato base. I couldn't finish all the food because they give you a lot of food. But this is definitely a fun way to eat, and its a great experience everyone should try out at least once."], ["Mai L.", "The food was pretty good, but I would say they need to work on the service.

I'd driven by it a lot and just never really thought it would be as authentic as it turned out to be. Walking in there are booth tables and tall tables, brick walls and a huge menu posted on the wall similar to snappy salads. After reviewing I decided on the veggie samosas and tikka misala plate. Pricies are very affordable and you get huge amounts of food. Good idea to share a plate with a friend. Masala plate came with rice, lentil veggie soup, lentil curry, 4 pieces of naan, yogurt and a dessert that tasted almost like gulap Jamun with rice instead of the sweet dough balls. However, you get a free order of gulap with your yelp check-in. \u00a0I really enjoyed the food here. Can't wait to try the other dishes."], ["Cat N.", "OOooo I like this place! it was such a unique experience to mix things up once in awhile. :) This place is definitely not for the usual American. You need to be able to take a lot of spices at once. Flavors will hit you before you could even comprehend what you just put in your mouth. I went with the non-vegetarian thali to try different items at one time. A thali is eating style with different selection of many dishes in little bowls. \u00a0You get two different types of rice: white and biryani. You also get a crispy naan and a soft naan. It's a lot of carbs. There's soup and a squash type soup. All that are default so you don't pick them. You pick your meat and a different veggie dish. I went with chicken curry and cauliflower. Flavor was definitely packing but the chicken had too much bones. I didnt get any meat. Cauliflower was my favorite! you also get this really spicy paste and a dessert that tastes just like a sponge cake soaked in honey!

Southern Spice is like the Chipotle of Indian food. There is a menu on the wall and you go through and order or pick already made items on the line and then seat yourself. The decor is lovely with a hipster feel to it. Since Yelp said there was waiter service, I was expecting a casual sit down restaurant. Instead what I got was the Chipotle of Indian. The menu is on the wall with no descriptions. I like descriptions. When we asked what something was the staff seemed to get irritated that we even asked. I went with what I knew best, Tandoori Chicken. My husband got the Chicken Tikka Masala. Fun fact thanks to the travel channel: Chicken Tikka is an Indian dish. Chicken Tikka Masala is a British dish. The Brits like their gravy and so that is how the Chicken Tikka Masala came about. I always thought that they were both indian and it confused me why the Londoner and From Across the Pond served Chicken Tikka Masala. Thanks Travel Channel.Anyway, the chicken tikka masala is served with white rice and a couple of sauces. The chicken tikka masala was amazing. I got the full portion of Tandoori Chicken. Kids got the half. The half comes with 4 pieces. The full comes with 8. 12 pieces of chicken were gone. I loved it. The kids and husband loved it. Full of flavor and so moist. The Lentill balls were good as well. Everything came out pretty fast except the Tandoori Chicken which took about 15 minutes to come out. No complaints on that though! Would I come back? I probably would."], ["Thy T.", "We came here in the evening near opening time and we were the only one here for a while. When we walked in, there is a strong smell which can be a little too much for some people. But your brain become used to it and you forget about it later. This is not your typical Indian restaurant. The decors are hipster-ish with bench-like tables while modern music is playing in the background. The menu is on the back wall with giant words that you can't miss. I love eating Indian food but my knowledge of the meals are pretty limited (sorry, I can't help but order vindaloo everywhere I go). So the menu was quite overwhelming when there weren't any description next to the name of the entree. I ended up ordering the tandoori chicken while my boyfriend had the chicken tikka. On top of that, we ordered garlic naan 'cause we thought there weren't going to be enough naan that came already with the meals.The garlic naan was crispy and garlicky! I highly recommend that if you want more carbs in the meal. Our dishes came out on these fajita-like sizzling plates from Mexican restaurants so they were hot and fresh once on the table. On top of that, we both got a separate round silver plate with several sauces, rice, and regular naan. It was a lot of food and we were both so full at the end. Both dishes were great! What made the whole experience better was how decently priced the foods were. Total price for everything (including a free dessert) was $21. The tandoori chicken was $8-9 while the chicken tikka was around $10. Every time we go to a regular (not fancy) Indian restaurants for dinner, an entree would cost us $15 each. Overall, love the concept there and definitely recommend it."], ["Adam G.", "Man, I keep coming back to this restaurant due their delicious Vegetarian Thali. \u00a0It's a Thali, (metal plate with several little bowls filled with different sides), style...and it's more than plenty for a hearty appetite. \u00a0In addition, it's full of flavors and more importantly...it's spicy, (just the way I love it)! \u00a0If you're unsure of what to order at an Indian restaurant, this is definitely a dish that I would recommend anyone that's wants to try a little of everything...like a sampler. \u00a0You won't be disappointed!!!"], ["Pavan Kumar J.", "Deserves 5 star.

While Southern Spice offers the more common North Indian dishes as well, I highly suggest you go to try out foods that are their specialty considering it's even advertised in their name.The place has that distinct southern Indian food smell the moment you walk in, which can be a bit overwhelming at first. The place features a large board menu akin to Chipotle. You can ask those who work there about any item on the menu since much of it is not too self explanatory, and they can tell you the types of spices and ingredients used in the dish!I personally love their Dosa--a crispy crepe made using a rice and lentils batter. This large crepe comes with two chutneys as well as Sambar (lentil vegetable stew broth) as dips. As you tear your pieces of Dosa and try out the chutneys, you'll be surprised how fast all the food disappears so quickly. Best part of it all? This huge dish is only $6 or $7 (depending on whether or not you want the Masala variation).What are you waiting for?! Go try it out!"], ["Vaibhav G.", "Good food. On the spicy side but flavorful.

Our request is to train everyone who works there on the importance of this aspect to help future patrons. Thanks."], ["Karla J.", "My first time here and I really enjoyed the food.

The portion sizes were cut down DRAMATICALLY since my last visit. The staff was mindful of how much food they were giving me, carefully measuring out items which I didn't like. I eat less than the average human my age so it was OK, but this is not the place to go if you have a normal appetite. \u00a0The food itself was good- mild spice to cater to a wide demographic.

Between the tandoor, curry, and lunch thalis, you can't go wrong, however, they do have other small plates and tiffin items that is best suited for afternoon snacks.The vegetarian lunch thali was totally awesome: The combination of delicate yet savory lemon rice, generous portion of basmati rice, and a slice of Naan was more than desired to go with two entrees and not to mention the rasam and daal. I tried the cauliflower and mint based veggies. Cauliflower, though little oily was spiced amply and had genuine flavor although I would have loved to see few potatoes in it. The mint based veg item was equally good, a remarkably noble item that I was really delighted to taste for the first time. The daal was of little thick consistency than I prefer, nonetheless cooked properly with perfect combination of condiments. The rasam was alright and the curd was good but a little heavy on salt. The papad and vada were perfect addition to the make this meal complete. The dessert item, I guess the jaggery infused inside flour ball was delicately sweet to end this great vegetarian meal. I was enjoying the food so much, I didn't even think about that small naan portion; when you have as good a thali as this, naan, a northern fare becomes irrelevant. They do, however, offer varieties of naan, parathas and biryanis if that is what you are looking for.I will definitely be back to try other stuffs. They do serve many of these items with veg, kofta and paneer making it a true attraction even for Vegetarians.

It was our first time at this restaurant yesterday. We both had mild Chicken Tikka Masala and garlic naan. The naan is the best I've ever had, by far. The flavor is pure perfection.

Food : 4 starsService : 2.5?I had a quick stop through. First off (likely my own ignorance) it is a dry establishment. Looks like it may be BYOB as a table near me was sharing a bottle of wine... But really wanted a beer or too. I was quickly seated which is always nice, and they accommodated my choice of seating which is great too. I ordered the fried jalape\u00f1os, chicken chili, and a naan. Fried jalape\u00f1os were a mixed review. I loved them, but the chickpea batter was too thick for me. But they were easily popped out so I had some with the batter and most without. Portion was generous. Sadly because I popped a bunch out I think they thought I didn't like them because they were confused when I didn't want to take them home .... I wasn't taking home batter. I ordered the chicken chili very spicy and they actually did an admirable job. I did have a little kick to it. It was very tasty too. Good amount of chicken and flavorful curry. \u00a0The naan is nothing worth writing about unfortunately. The part that threw me for a loop was the service. They seemed very disoriented. They were mostly very nice. There was a bit of a language difficulty, which doesn't phase me as I work in a global company and work with individuals around the world. After I placed my order I had multiple different staff come and ask if I was going to order anything else besides the jalape\u00f1os. \u00a0I said i did. They would go away, and then come back a few minutes later and ask the same question. It got kind of annoying after a while. I don't know if it was a new crew, but it was a Saturday night.... Not the time to expect the \"B\" team."], ["Donald S.", "When was the last time you could taste the chef's passion in the food? Not often, I bet.

He really went the extra mile to make us happy. The food was exceptional! Really the best Indian I've had in years. I had palak paneer, which was complex, nuanced, and freaking delicious. The paneer had the flavor and texture of homemade. My wife had chicken tikka masala and loved it. The sauce had a silky texture and the chicken was tender, juicy, and smoky. The atmosphere was comfortable and a lot classier than many Indian restaurants. It's not a slick designer interior, but the lights were low, the music was good, the tables had linens, and it was perfectly clean. I will absolutely eat here again soon.

The two stars I gave are for the service and for the fact that parking is validated at this location; other than that there was absolutely nothing to remember about this place. On this visit we ordered Andhra chicken, butter naan and chicken biryani. The chicken we got was either Tikka Masala or something else, but definitely not Andhra chicken. It lacked the trademark curry leaves that are put in the dish, and of course tasted nothing like Andhra Chicken. The biggest disappointment, however, was the biryani. Bland white rice with a sprinkling of spices and tasteless boiled chicken does not make a biryani! We were given salan and raita with the biryani but they did absolutely nothing to make the meal edible. I was terribly disappointed with my visit, because I'd been looking forward to eating some good food as a reward for starting and sticking with a workout program! I really hope this was a one off case, because my first visit here had been so much better!"], ["Felipe B.", "Second time here and it's always a good choice.

While we were expecting to be charged for the extra food, to our surprise they didn't charge anything. Naan is freshly made once you sit on the table, all the food is tasty and very fresh. Probably medium spice for most palates. We live over half an hour away and really don't mind the drive.Would certainly recommend."], ["Miss K.", "Great food & service.

Its a must try location."], ["Brad S.", "awesome curry! \u00a0I loved the samosas and paneer with nan. \u00a0I can't wait to go back and try more."], ["Tinsley K.", "I don't even know where to begin. \u00a0The place was dingy and dirty attached to some kind of grocery store. \u00a0The dirtiness made me question the safety of the food I was about to pickup. \u00a0The chicken tikka masala was an oily tomato soup with five pieces of questionable chicken. \u00a0The chicken curry had so many bones my husband wouldn't even take one bite. \u00a0The vegetable samosa was a mushy triangle of blandness. \u00a0I tried to give it a shot but took two bites and threw it away. \u00a0Guess when you're paying $16 you get what you pay for."], ["Racheal M.", "I love this little gem. The goat biryani was wonderful, the chicken samosa' were nice and crisp with a yummy side sauce and their chicken biryani and chicken tandoori I crave in my sleep. Service has been excellent and I love that they have a store on the other side where you can pick up spices and snacks. Love love love!"], ["Quentin T.", "Great food, they have a great menu of various indian dishes. The decor is not the most up to date, but the food is some of the best in the area. Keeps me coming back for more. The gorcery store attached is also very useful when filling a shopping list for homeade indian cusine."], ["Dennis U.", "This funny guy has to improve this restaurant I guess, food is ok. customer service is below average. No cashier the same guy who cook come out and take the money with the apron on it, because of that, it make my apatite take away."], ["Justin M.", "My favorite meal here is the fresh naan with a side of dal. The chicken curry also has a wonderful flavor with a lot of cinnamon, clove, and cinnamon shinning through (be prepared to pick out the whole spices too btw)."], ["Christian J.", "I love indian food and the lamb curry here is pretty delicious. I ordered tandori chicken once and it was very dry and almost burnt. Besides that, it's still a good place to have lunch."], ["Annla D.", "Best hidden gem in Fort Worth! Located inside a grocery store, nothing fancy, but I love love their spicy tika masala and their naan. I also ordered the curried goat, and skewers. Can't order anything bad here."], ["Jul J.", "Good biriyani and other foods, friendly, \u00a0but more of a takeout than sit in restaurant.. Needs better location, good food!"], ["Sandra P.", "I love Indian food, and this is my second time to go here. \u00a0I got the chicken curry, daal, naan, veggie samosa, and veggie biryani. \u00a0The chicken curry had some weird pieces of chicken in it, mostly bones and the sauce was about 50 percent grease. \u00a0Daal was ok and the naan was ok. \u00a0I asked what's in the veggie biryani and the cashier said it would have potatoes and cauliflower. \u00a0It ended up having mixed veggies from a can inside it. \u00a0The veggie samosas were pretty good with potatoes inside them, but they could have been frozen before, not sure if they were homemade. \u00a0The food took a really long time to come out. \u00a0One plus is the food is dirt cheap, but you get what you pay for. \u00a0Also, there is a $5 minimum for credit card transactions."], ["Hamza M.", "Halal. Cool dhabba (hole in the wall) like feel to the small restaurant next to the market. Chaat and beryani are good. price is awesome. And the chai, it's good but it kinda depends on the day you go too. all in all, worth coming back to."]]}
