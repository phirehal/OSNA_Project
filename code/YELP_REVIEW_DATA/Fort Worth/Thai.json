They will walk you through the menu, insure you understand the heat grades, and recommend many great things I have never tried. Even when I was stuck at my store one time, they even were kind enough to deliver it to me, I was in the same shopping center, but truly it is the little things in servioce and kindness you ALWAYS rmember. The chicken with cashew nuts is wonderful, but I will truly say by die hard end all be all dish there is the Green Curry Shrimp with steamed rice. The eggplant and bamboo shoots are cooked perfectly to the most delicate sweetness, the taste of coconut milk on you pallette with the high spice of curry just sends me over the edge! Rest assured though, please by all means get the heat grade right! I ususually go with a 2.0-2.5 nooooo higher! Whew! My head would tingle and explode at any higher! There are so many great dishes to try there, everytime, i taste a little something new and I am always thrilled with my new find. I will truly miss this place, as I have moved back to NC, but I wanted to take the time to give a glowing review.

It's right off of I-30 at Hulen, convenient for a drive from Dallas. Due to unforeseen traffic, I was about 30 minutes late and my friend didn't get my text, so she got there on time and waited. She said they were very nice to her and didn't pressure her to leave or give up her table while I sat in construction. We both ordered the Pad Thai lunch specials, hers with chicken and mine with tofu. We started with salad with peanut sauce, which was delicious! I want to bottle that sauce and bring it home. I ordered the egg roll, which is marked as vegetarian on the menu, and she had the summer roll. The summer roll came out before our food, but my egg roll came out with the entree. I slathered the peanut sauce on it and took a big bite...only to taste meat of some sort. I had to be *that person* in public, spitting my food out. I asked the waiter, who was very nice, if the egg roll had meat in it since the menu said vegetarian and he had to ask another lady that worked there who told him yes. He then said I should've ordered the spring roll...which isn't on the menu for the lunch specials. Just the (vegetarian) summer roll, (vegetarian) egg rolls and pot sticks, with no substitutions allowed. So, my appetizer was a waste and there were no apologies made for the incorrect labeling on the menu, just blaming me for not ordering something that was not on the menu.Now that I didn't get my appetizer, I dug into the pad thai. We both got spice level 1 and enjoyed the kick. Not too hot for my boring taste buds. The flavor was rich, not too greasy or anything. Saved about 1/3 to take home as leftovers and it reheated well. The food came out quickly after we ordered and our drinks were refilled often. The prices are lunch are a bit higher than normal Thai lunch options, $9.50 versus the $7-8 I am used to.We may return, if only for its convenience and options, but we'll see.

One lady even kept bowing. And the bad. The prices were on the high side. Like $9 for chicken satay appetizers. The menu was also uninspired, especially the curries. I had to flip through it a few times to find something that I couldn't have easily made myself at home. I gave up and just ended up getting the Oyster Sauce dish because I love mushrooms. I did not care for it. In fact, I threw away the leftovers on the way home. Frank thought his curry was good, but the portion was too small. He also didn't think he got enough rice.It really pains me to write this review. Really, it does. They still have the \"GRAND OPENING\" banner in front and everything.

About 10-15 minutes later it still hadn't arrived, so we canceled the order.

The menu indicated that the Pad Kee Mow is spicy but our waitress told me that it isn't and she was right, it wasn't that spicy for a person that can't eat spicy at all like me.

My friends and I came for their 50% off deal yesterday and we came EARLY before the place was packed. Starting from 5:30pm, we didn't leave until 7:45pm because it was taking forever for them to get our food. There were 6 of us and we saw a table who came after us who got their food before us. In addition, I ordered the Grilled Nam Tok and so did my friend and it came out cold. We made the waiter take it back to reheat it. The meat was dry but the sauce did help a little bit. This would not be a dish I would want to order again. In addition, it did take them awhile to give us our checks and when they did, the waiter forgot to add the 50% off deal and so we had to wait again. We asked them to validate our parking ticket and when we got out of the parking garage, it was actually not validated and my friend ended up having to pay. I hope this place improves because with the service that we received yesterday, I do not want to come back again.

The young lady who took my order was very friendly and VERY helpful in explaining the menu and guiding me through the process. After getting home and actually eating my dish, I was stunned. I'm no expert about Thai cuisine, but the Pad Kee Mow (I think?) was awesome. The summer rolls were incredible as well, and you can really tell that the vegetables are fresh. My first experience here was incredible and I am sure to return often. My only caveat is the serving size. I realize that this is America and we're spoiled to large servings, but as a guy with a voracious appetite I'd like to get a larger serving.

I get yellow or red curry most of the time.. I don't know if they have green but I'll try that next. I love that the potatoes in the yellow curry are always cooked perfectly, they tend to be firmer at other Thai spots. I like their Tom Kha- the lunch specials usually come with a small cup and a spring roll. I don't think I could eat a large bowl of it- it's pretty sour compared to others I've had.

I ordered a bowl of soup for my daughter and asked for scissors to cut her soup noodles and veggies so she can eat it (she's only 1) and the older waitress acted like it was a huge bother along with cheese rolls and shrimp rolls. she then took away my menu when I had told her I was waiting for 2 more people, I just wanted to order appetizers. When my sisters came we ordered even more - hot pot tom yum gai soup, papaya salad, 2 drunken noodles and 1 pad c ew. So obviously we were spending a lot of money. I had to ask several times for napkins and chopsticks. I would stack dishes so it could be removed and when the older waitresses would come by she would never take them away and I would have to ask for it. The youngest waitress was very pleasant and nice though. The soups were both ok, the pad c ew also moderate but the drunken noodles were very good. I also loved the cheese rolls and shrimp rolls.

However, the portion size is generous, and he stayed full (and heavy feeling) the entire day.

Dinner portions here are huge. I always eat half and take the rest to go so it's nice to have a second meal for later ;)Lunch portions are perfect for me because it's half the size of dinner.The last time I came here, my order was WAY TOO SPICY. Yes, I LOVE spicy. That's why I order the 5. But the kitchen made it so spicy this time that it was unbearable to eat. They are usually consistent but this one time was not the best experience.

For a Thai dish it was a bit bland most of the spice came from chili oil. \u00a0$2 extra for veggies \u00a0so in total it was about 12 dollars or so. Quality seemed a bit lacking.decent portion but lacking the Thai kick. Service was a bit spotty I guess because it's such a large group that they aren't used to that.

The wait staff is friendly and got me started off immediately with some water and salad. I ordered the tom yum goong soup to start off with. The waitress asked me how spicy I wanted it on a scale of 1-5 and I choose four. If you have eaten real tom yum soup you'd know it's supposed to be spicy and not sweet. This place had spiced the soup by adding chilli flakes and that was a big turn-off. For appetizers I ordered the curry puffs. Having had the curry puffs in Singapore these were a huge disappointment. They weren't up to the mark. However if you haven't tasted these before I'd say give em a shot.For the main course I got the black pepper beef.

Experience: loved my experience here! I came with a friend and its a great place to have lunch/ dinner with someone! It's a nice dim lighting that makes it nice to talk. The decor is nice and asian-y. Maybe not a great place for large crowds, however it is quite spacious and you will never have to wait for a seat. Really enjoyed my overall experience here. Food: every time I come here I get the drunken noodle, it's always my default! I highly recommend getting the drunken noodle if you're at lost!! There's egg in it and it's slightly spivey, and the noodles are wonderfully flat and wide. My friend got the massaman curry, and it was really good as well! Be careful when you first get it cause it WILL burn your mouth Lol. Service: super great! She did stop checking on us after a while (I had to call her to ask for more water) but it was all good. She was super nice and didn't mind that we sat there for a while. Overall, I would absolutely recommend this place if you're ever in the Arlington area and want some awesome Thai food, go to Thai house!!!"], ["Chana R.", "After I signed up to give my first review for Thai Basil Leaf I feel like I owe it to Thai House as well. Been a long time customer, would feel so wrong if I don't share their greatness with the world. First of, I like the new updates done to the restaurant. Nice new floor!People are always really nice here so five stars for that for sure. Service are quick most of the time but I like to visit when it's not usual dining time. Thai people are always friendly (most of them, really) and this place is no exception, from servers to cooks to owners they are all nice people. I don't really like curry as much here but I don't find most Thai restaurant made a really authentic curry dish compare to Thailand. Well, it supposed to be super creamy and oily goodness, a heart attack kind of goodness and to do that you need a real fresh coconut milk and lots of it and a lot of patience preparing the first step of cooking any coconut curry dish. When I crave it I do it myself.I would give Curry only 2.5 stars but seriously, most people seem to like it and as long as you do that is good enough. I love the Tom Yum Shrimp Hot Pot here! I would give it 4 stars. When I do order I ask for 10 stars spicinessTom Yum is a very deep flavor dish and no questions if they do it right. Tom Kha (Chicken is the most common served in Thailand) is pretty good too. Spicy Beef Salad. yummy goodness grilled beef with crispy lettuce and lightly sour and flavorful thai style dressing sauce. What's not to love? 5 Stars easy!Pad Kee Maw! Love it. I find it a bit too oily but the deep flavor just too hard to pass on. A bit alternative compare to real authentic dish, but good enough that I don't care about the little bitty issue. Try with pork I think it's best with pork. Pad See Ew. Love it even more than Pad kee maw!! Ask for Thai style with Chinese Broccoli instead of fusion one with broccoli. It tasted better. Very Simple dish, Flat noodle, meat (I like pork), Chinese broccoli, egg, all stir fried together, not spicy (add it on after if you like) Simply at its best!Oh Man, I almost almost forget to mention Cheese Roll! Not a chance!You can never leave this place without trying it. Please please order it and eat it when it's hot and the cheese is still soft and melt in your mouth. (be careful and don't let it burn your tongue)Minced pork (or chicken) Thai style basil stir fried. They got it right. (Not much veggies in it, just onion and sliced jalapeno pepper I think)Khao Soi Oh goodness. Well I don't like curry here as much but Khao Soi (Curry noodle) is an exception. So so good. Try it with Chicken. 5 hard stars!Somtam (Papaya Salad) is pretty good here too. Really love the flavor but I think its wee bit expensive for the amount I get. Lunch here is good value! Because it comes with Cheese roll teheheheGood lunch price, good portion, I would order curry if I feel like it for lunch since it's cheaper, otherwise I like to order my favorite pad see ew or pad kee maw or pad thai for lunch. I think it's a very good value. I usually reorder what I think it best offers at that place so these are my favorites and if I get to try different dishes in the future I sure will give you an update."], ["Desiree P.", "Great food and great service! The pad Thai was second only to what I've had in Thailand. Their Thai ice coffee was delicious and very authentic. The restaurant was clean and very well decorated.

They also have a break down on 3 spiciness levels on the menu. But if you ask the server they will offer you \u00a05 Thai spicy levels, that's if you like your food normally spicy.

Did a quick search on yelp for something close with good ratings. Thai House Restaurant came up with a decent amount of reviews and 4 stars. In the past this was a good indication that it was going to be a good restaurant however I've been noticing lately 4 star and 5 star restaurants are really not what they use to be. This leads me to believe that people are manipulating the rating system on yelp. This restaurant was maybe a 2 star restaurant. We both had two Thai Ice Tea that were so sweet that you couldn't drink them even when watering them down by 50%. My co worker ordered the cheese spring rolls for an app, which sounds discussing but she said they were alright although she only ate one. I really don't think this is a Thai dish so it sort of indicated to me that this really wasn't a traditional Thai place. I had the drunken noodles since this was one of the most reviewed item. It was OK. \u00a0Nothing special and not good enough to stop me from writing this review. My coworker had the yellow curry and she said it was ok. Avoid the dinner salad they serve. Scary mayonnaise based dressing and old looking lettuce. To some this place up, if your not a Thai lover and don't have a frame of reference then you might enjoy a meal here.

I didn't care very much for the Fried Cheese Rolls, Fried Spring Rolls or the Corn Cake. Next was the Thai Hot and Sour Shrimp soup. A nice palate cleanser for the spicy food I still had coming. I had the Beef Drunken Noodles while my boyfriend had the Combination Pineapple Fried Rice. I love flat rice noodles but personally wish they didn't use green bell peppers. Green bell peppers aren't as sweet as the red, orange, or yellow peppers; also why they're much cheaper to buy. They're actually kind of bitter when not cooked all the way and so for me, it was an unpleasant taste alongside the savory meat and noodles. Other than that, I enjoyed it. I personally don't like cashews or the use of pineapple in savory foods but the addition of both in the Pineapple Fried Rice worked. It gave the dish more dimension. Sweet, savory, crunchy, and spicy all in one hit. We ordered both of our dishes at a Spicy 3 which we felt was perfect. Spice is apparent but not overwhelming: an enjoyable spicy. Lastly, a sweet ending with Thai teas to-go. Not as sweet as I like mine to be but it was good.The staff were all very friendly and the service was quick.

We were brought small salads with a white dressing, which I couldn't identify, but it was tasty. We were starving and looking forward to the Satay appetizer but it was brought out at the same time as our entrees. The Satay was pretty standard - grilled chicken on skewers with a thick peanut sauce. The Panang Curry was pretty good - the kaffir lime flavor was strong, as it should be and my tofu was cooked well. I asked for a Mild on the spicy scale and it was still almost too spicy for me to eat. My husband's Thai Fried Rice was also good. Unfortunately, the restaurant was extremely cold during my \u00a0visit and it really hindered my dining experience. My husband and I both had to wear our winter jackets the entire meal and we were still freezing. The service left a little to be desired as well. Although the staff was nice, there was only one person on the floor at most times and they were kept pretty busy with other guests.

I generally expect shrimp tempura at a Japanese or hibachi restaurant. *kanye shrug* The shrimp tempura just tasted like the oil it was fried in and it had no real taste beyond that.

Mama added that she makes the curry paste from scratch which I believe is unheard of these days due to the tedious nature of making curry paste. \u00a0Since the number of patrons was small, they made moderate amounts of the dishes to make sure it was always fresh, but never let a pan go empty for very long.

My soup was coconut-based; I thought it was a tad too sweet and wanted it to be more sour. That's my preference of soup though.

However, this evening, I was craving sushi. When Thai and Sushi Ave opened up just a few weeks ago, over in the ever so popular, and growing Alliance Town Center, here in N. Fort Worth (Keller), Wifey and I were cautiously optimistic that we might finally have a decent sushi restaurant here in this area.Back track a few days: I popped in Thai and Sushi Ave at lunch to grab a menu. When I got home, wifey and did a double take. Most specialty rolls are in the $15-$18 range? Now, I've owned a restaurant and bar, so I know pricing depends a lot of what your overhead is (e.g., rent, payroll, etc.) Now, since there were only 3 employees working, the payroll can't be high. Since it's in N. Fort Worth (not Downtown, or Southlake), rent can't be that high. Not to mention, the square footage can't be more than 2000, including the kitchen. So, we'll rule out overhead, and must assume that they offer a superb quality of sushi. Nope, we'll eventually rule that out too.

Crabmeat \"Dynamite\" \u00a0AKA \"Slop\" (See pic) 3. 2 pieces of Tuna sashimi $53. Cashew Chicken $8 (Kid sized entree) The \"Special\" Cucumber Roll was decent, but nothing special. In fact, if there was a ray of sunshine in this meal, it was the cucumber itself. The tuna, salmon, and crab meat, was just a bunch of slop. Not quality *pieces* of sushi that most quality restaurants serve. Just mush wrapped in cucumber.The crabmeat 'Dynamite\" is as described. It looks like someone stuck a stick of dynamite in my \"to go\" box. Sushi nachos maybe. View pic and come to your own conclusion.2 pieces of Tuna sashimi. Not fresh, and not of good quality. To be fair, I've had worse {Cough Cough} \u00a0at Ha Na Bi (across the street).Cashew chicken. Americanized, and loaded with salt. Quite shitty, to be honest.$50 wasted. I would gladly pay upwards of $100 for good sushi. I do, quite often, in Southlake, or D/T Fort Worth. If you're going to charge \"Big City\" pricing, you need to serve \"Big City\" quality, or you'll be out of business. Quick!

I did ask about the soup and salad that were supposed to come with the meal and she asked if I wanted to take it to go or wanted me to still bring it out. I was really so ready to be gone I told her don't tell the kitchen and bring the soup/salad out. I was almost done and watched the people sitting at the counter walk to the front door and open and close it several times hoping some bell would go off to call the person to the front again. They finally left disgustingly. I had a few bites left and had to remind her about the iced tea until I was the only person in the restaurant at 12:45. The food was actually flavorful though lots of other things need to happen in a restaurant for it to be good.I guess there is a reason why it was empty but don't know if people sick or new person with no training but I did see a manager looking person finally pop out but never said a thing to me or anything else in the restaurant. Hopefully when new owners eventually take over, this would be a place worth my time and money. An hour and a half I'll never get back."], ["Weston C.", "We had chicken Pad Thai (heat level 2 1/2) and it was phenomenal.

We sat at the sushi bar and I had the shrimp roll special and it was phenomenal. I also ordered theCrab Rangoon as an appetizer. Everything tasted so fresh and the cream cheese mixture was spot on. I could eat it every day. Finally, they gave us a sampler portion of their homemade shrimp cocktail and WOW - I don't even like cocktail sauce under normal circumstances, but their version was absolutely incredible. The wait staff was extremely helpful, patient and friendly. I would highly recommend this place to anyone."], ["Sumi L.", "We recently moved to the area and decided to try this place out based on former reviews when it was called, \"Thai and Sushi Avenue\". My \u00a0husband was right when he said, \"it can't be good if it's Thai and Sushi\". Since it got really good reviews, I thought, \"why not? let's give it a try!\". To start off, my husband ordered a rainbow roll. That fish did not look fresh. He said it was just ok. He also ordered the tom yum pork noodle bowl. There was nothing tom yum about it. We've had plenty of Thai food all over the DFW area, and we know good tom yum when we have it.I ordered chicken pad thai. (BTW, the description on the menu is wrong, it's basically the same description for the pad kee mao, which I had to confirm with the waiter and he did say that the person who made the menu did a horrible job and they were working on it). The pad thai was alright. I've had better, and I've had worse. The noodles were more of the thinner variety, which is ok...but it could have used more flavor. My sister got the Thai beef salad. First, the meat was not even grilled like it traditionally is, and it had like 5pieces of little beef. She literally had to dig around to find it. On top of that, they used cheap iceberg lettuce--and lots of it. It was lacking A LOT of flavor. We had to ask for limes to make it more sour (the sauce is usually salty, sour, and spicy) Needless to say, she did not enjoy it. For $10 it was straight up a rip off. My little cousin got the Pad Kee Mao, which had the most flavor and the best tasting dish, but she was complaining about all the oil it was cooked it. Yup...the bottom of her plate was swimming in oil. None of us enjoyed the food. We won't be going back. I kept telling my husband we should have gone to Sea of Siam instead."]], "Thai Select": [], "Muang Lao Cuisine": [["Carrie R.", "I really like this place for the following reasons:-Friendly service -\"outside of the box\" food, meaning that while they do have standbys like yellow curry, you can get something you probably haven't tried before...unless you happen to be Thai or Laotian -The chicken broth soup with onions that are somehow soft enough to taste like onions but not have the pungent i-just-bit-into-an-onion taste-REALLY good dishes-thai iced tea that's awesomeMay I recommend the yellow curry fried rice and the salad in Laotian style? \u00a0The salad in particular was unlike anything I've ever had but it was really good.Oh and one last thing, you will get 2-3 meals out of whatever you order. \u00a0I always do. \u00a0This makes the price (which to me is reasonable anyway) even better!"], ["Paul H.", "Quiet place in the middle of a generic strip mall in NW Fort Worth, just on the south side of 820. Interior is an open space with traditional Asian decor, booths and tables. I admit knowing very little (well, nothing) about Laotian food, so I stuck strictly with the Thai end of the spectrum for a first visit.Ordered the pad ke-mao (combination meat) with a \"3\" on the 1-5 hot scale (just right). The entree came with a small bowl of soup, a clear broth with a diced starchy vegetable (potato? jicama?) that was quite good. Also ordered shrimp spring rolls we split as an appetizer, served with two sauces (traditional peanut and a sweet/spicy chili sauce). My pad ke-mao was right on the money, large portion filled with pieces of beef, chicken and a fair amount of seafood (including mussels and squid). All the food was classic to style and delicious, just the right amount of heat. Service was patient and gracious as we lingered after dinner. Glad to find a reliable Thai place in Fort Worth. I'll have to come back just to try the Lao."], ["Olivia E.", "I agree with Dianna N, this place is definately worth five stars or more! Food is absolutely awesome. It's a mix of both Thai and Laos flavors. Should you feel adventurous, and want to try something above and beyond the usual Thai restaurants then come here. It's a nice mom and pop place. They are able to accommodate large groups if you come with family. Service was nice and fairly quickly. My only complaint is the loudness from the waitresses. Just because your family owns it doesn't mean you don't have to act professionally. Loud talking and laughing is very disturbing to me and the other customers. I will probably continue ordering to-go and taking it home to avoid the unpleasant loud talking. Do order the basil fried rice, it was very different and full of fresh flavors. I also recommend the lard Na seafood plate. Delicious!"], ["Rebecca T.", "We were going to head over to D Asian Thai .... and we did, but assumed they were open yesterday night (they are closed on Tuesdays). So, we headed over to this place and I am glad we did! So good! I had the pad thai spicy level 3... nomnomnom! So good! I almost ate it all within 1 sitting. My husband had the yellow curry spicy level 4 and a coffee. We are both in love with this place and definitely plan on going back. It is very nice inside, clean, large, not cluttered. We went in and ordered our food to go around 7:30 and and left 10 minutes later. I'd say that's pretty darn fast. Good flavoring, perfect spice levels. I already want more for lunch today!"], ["Theresa L.", "The food was amazing! We got the chicken pad Thai, crab Rangoon (my favorite), and yellow curry. I would give this place 5 stars but unfortunately I found HAIR in my curry right when I opened my container. So I didn't have the chance to try the yellow curry."], ["David V.", "This is some authentic Thai/Lao cuisine. One of my favorite spots, and the construction being done on 820 makes it better.We came for lunch and ordered the red curry and the yellow curry. My yellow curry contained onions, carrots, potatoes and beef, liked it a lot bc it wasn't filled with so much vegetables like you find at some other places. The red curry was simple as well, but had egg plant which was delicious. Both were really good and had the right amount of spice. The lunches also came with some clear soup or spring roll. We chose the soup. The clear soup was really good on a cold rainy day very light and flavorful. We had also order the crab Rangoon as an appetizer. These were good because they were not really crispy but more crunchy, didn't taste like the wonton wrapper was soaked with oil, which was a good thing. The only bad thing I can say about Muong Lao is I wished they had more desserts. Overall I really enjoyed it and think they have some of the best curries around."], ["Sandy N.", "I was craving some Lao food so we drove up here from our trip to Dallas to get some. \u00a0The food was good and tasty.

No one can get disappointed here!"], ["Jason T.", "I went here with my wife and two young children. The interior was neat. I ordered Pad Si-Eiew with #2 of spiciness out of 5. My wife ordered Green Curry with #2 of spiciness, and we got Pineapple Fried Rice for our child. (We first ordered Orange Chicken, but they ran out of it.) \u00a0After we placed the orders, they brought out chicken broth soup. There were horse radish and green onion in it. It was pretty good soup. My Pad Si-Wiew was good, and it was good level of spiciness....except the dish was too sweet for my taste and a little too oily. My wife said her green curry was pretty spicy for #2 spiciness, but it was tasty...except again it was a little too sweet. The pineapple fried rice was also good but too sweet and oily, so overall, those three dishes were good but too sweet. The portion was great \u00a0for the price.I think we will come back to this place to try noodle soup and salad because those dishes simply looks delicious in pictures."], ["Phil H.", "Awesome little Thai place tucked away.

I've reviewed a few on here, and whenever a new one opens up, I'm all about trying it out. So, when Spice opened up on Magnolia, I simply had to try it out. Going at lunch time with two friends and colleague, we were promptly seated in the (almost full) dining room. The design is rather sparse/modern, but was very clean and still welcoming. After perusing the lunch menu (dishes come with a spring/egg roll and salad), I settled on the red curry with beef. If a Thai restaurant cannot get something as standard as a red curry right, then I automatically rule out the rest of their dishes. Asking for a spice level of 4 (ranges from 1-5, don't go to 5 unless all you want to taste are chilis), our server promptly put in our orders. The dishes came out with relative speed and I can happily say it was one of the best red curries I've had in Fort Worth in a while. Delicious, coconut-y, with plenty of beef and vegetables, and served with a fair amount of rice, the red curry was fantastic. The spice level was spot-on. My friends chose the Pad Thai (spice 3), and the pepper chicken (spice 4). I usually avoid Pad Thai since it is on the sweeter end of the spectrum, but with the additional chilis added, the Pad Thai was amazing. The pepper chicken was also outstanding. I will absolutely be back again."], ["Rachael Z.", "The food is delicious. Probably some of the best Thai food I've ever had, but the service can be a little iffy, so don't go if you're in a rush.

The ingredients are very fresh and not over cooked. I had the Pad Ginger with shrimp and it was fantastic. The shrimp was perfectly cooked and very fresh. My wife had the Pad Thai and it was also great. Their \"1-5\" scale of spice tends to the hot side, so ordering a dish as a 3 or medium is actually rather hot. Overall this is a great choice if you're looking for Thai in Fort Worth."], ["Humberto S.", "INCREDIBLY GOOD DELICIOUS FOOD! The service was great also.

It's a new restaurant getting service and organizational legs for sure. There was some confusion on reservations and if my party of four could be seated right away or not. We didn't have a reservation but others who called in or something did. After we were seated, a bunch of people came in and they had long waits. Perhaps because of this the first waiter seemed to rush us to put in an order. We didn't. We asked for more time and we ended up getting back our original waiter, who was kinder.

Shortly after drinks were served we placed an app order and once again some one else returned to the table asking if we would like any appetizers. A different person put app plates down and it wasn't until the apps were served and they started to put more app plates down that they realized someone had already brought some.

My husband's shrimp curry dish was also delicious and intense, and our friend's chicken and basil noodle dish with peanuts was a hit. The only disappointment was the appetizer platter -- a variety of ho-hum fried things without much flavor, and no peanut sauce for the two chicken sate skewers.
