LOL. they must come here a lot! what a cool friendly vibe im getting! one guy even sat down and the bartender just hands him a wine glass and pours. now that is service! so i ordered the grilled chicken marsala because well marsala is just so sweet i loveeee it! and my friend got the shrimp scampi with fettuccine alfredo. next our house salad comes out which is honestly. why bother? its okay its overly dressed and overly seasoned but good if you come in super hungry and just need something to eat right away other than that it did nothing. then our food came out in nice hot plates! presentation was well done on my part but the scampi was ehhh. it was the perfect portion of pasta to chicken very good nice juicy chicken with enough marsala sauce. very well executing. the scampi's shrimp was cooked perfectly not overly done served in a saucer of butter garlic and other things so seasoned well. and the alfredo sauce you could tell was not from a can and just made it was perfecto, thick sauce with just enough to cover the fet. and not murder it.all in all id love to eat here again my only complaint was the marsala was heavily oiled with olive oil had i not dipped my bread into my sauce i prob had 2 oz of oil in my plate. but id still eat here again."], ["Page P.", "They were the first Pizza in Texas. \u00a0So, most copied them. \u00a0The reason it is oval. \u00a0When they great grandmother was told \"there was a new thing in NYC, called, Pizza Pie\". \u00a0No one told her it was round. \u00a0My family has been eating at Campisi's since the 60's.

I was staying with a friend in Ft Worth for the weekend and she asked me what sort of food sounded good for lunch. I told her I never turn down Italian so she suggested we come here.I was excited to finally go after all this time. I debated between pasta or pizza, but didn't feel hungry enough to eat a big plate of food so we chose pizza since that's easier to share. The medium is enough to feed two, but it's very thin crust so if you have a hearty appetite you could probably finish this one on your own.I'm honestly not the biggest fan of thin crust because I love bread, and to me this one was a bit reminiscent of a frozen pizza in flavor. We picked our toppings and chose crumbled Italian sausage, ricotta cheese, and onion. The onion was still pretty raw, it tasted as if they threw it on top of the pizza after they had already baked it. The sausage and ricotta were good, and there was some Italian seasonings on there too that I liked. Overall though, their pizza is not something I would order again. I saw a lot of people with pasta and wished I had gone that route instead. Another thing I didn't like was that they don't give you free bread to snack on before the meal. That's one of the best parts of going out for Italian food! Total bummer. Our server was in a rush to get us to order when we sat down, and was great about refilling our drinks at first, but the second the pizza came we barely saw her again. It wasn't busy, as we came after their lunch rush, so I assumed since we only ordered one thing to share she didn't think her tip would be worth it and ignored us for higher paying tables. Just sort of a 'meh' experience all around. I know my friend has great taste so there has to be something here that was worth her suggesting it. I don't think she had ordered the pizza before either so it was a first for both of us. But I will return for pasta, and hope my next experience is a lot better than this one was."], ["Jose H.", "A friend and I wanted some Italiano, the evening was right to eat outside in their patio but instead we sat at the bar to watch tv. This was our first time eating here. I ordered the Original Shrimp Scampi, it can either be served with Spaghetti or Fettuccine.

You can either go into a small bar area where it seemed a little livelier or have a seat in booths/tables where the lights are low, candles are lit, and the mood is set! (Even though there are large tv screens playing football games, the sound is low/muted)Wait.. They also have a small patio area in the front. I did see quite a few tables full out there. Greeted as soon as we walked in, were seated in a matter of seconds as it wasn't too full (Thursday evening around 6/7) \u00a0Unfortunately most of the booths seemed to be for larger parties so we were offered a table in the middle seating area. I had a glass of moscato, friend had a beer. We ordered, for him Breaded Chicken Parm& for myself I, after help from the waitress, ordered an Artichoke & Chicken Pizza. Our bread and salads came right away. Both pretty good. Then out food followed shortly after. I didn't care for my pizza at all, of course my waitress didn't know that until she came to offer us our bill bc she hadn't checked on us since she dropped off our meals. \u00a0Thankfully the Chicken Parm is a very generous portion and I was able to steal a few bites. I had no desire to try anything else by the time she returned. \u00a0Got our ticket (minus this pizza that I only took a bite of)..and was shocked she charged me for a \"dinner salad\" really? I didn't eat your meal bc it was nasty but I'm charged for the small salad? I laughed it off as I really didn't care to complain. Would I return? Yeah.. I'm sure there are other menu items I'd enjoy.

We became acquainted with Campisi's (The Egyptian) years ago in Dallas on Mockingbird Av. as that was the only one then.The pizza is just as we like it, thin, cooked just right, and is always nicely topped with whatever you order. The small house salads are also good with a oil/vinegar dressing. We have ordered \u00a0other dishes also (Ravioli Angel Hair Pasta, etc), but the dinner sized portions are quite small and rather lackluster in taste.This is not the place to go for a GREAT Italian dinner, but the pizza is hard to beat.

I used to live near the original one in Dallas and heard many stories about the place. Everyone always said they have good food. It was about time I tasted for myself!Just like any other place with great food, you'll probably have to wait a bit to be seated. It didn't take nearly as long as expected for a party of 2 on a Saturday evening though. They will also text you when your table is ready. I wish every restaurant would start doing this.I wanted to get a good sampling of a few things they had to offer, so naturally I order the Sample Platter. It came with spaghetti, a large meatball, cheese ravioli, and lasagna. The meatball tasted like one of the better meatloafs I have ever had. The sauce was the highlight of the meal, and it was spread over all of it.And the price is very reasonable! I would put this place somewhere between the Olive Garden and a fancy Italian restaurant. Overall it is a great bargain for some delicious Italian."], ["Le E.", "I've lived in Fort Worth the majority of my adult years and I've never been here until a month ago.

My go to is the breaded chicken parm with fettuccini alfredo. The portion is huge and I always have to take some home. My husband typically orders the pizza which is prepared with thin crust. It's pretty great too.During prime dinner hour, you may have to wait for a table. From experience, after 8:30pm, it starts to clear out!"], ["Chirstine A.", "I absolutely love this place and all of the food on the menu I swear I could try something different every time. Pizza is great pasta is great appetizers as well. The only one thing that I would change about this place, is that they really need to make their ranch dressing homemade. For such an amazing pizza most Texans want some ranch on the side, but not some ranch that came out of a plastic tub. If you've ever worked in the restaurant business you know exactly what I mean it smells sour it does not taste good, they really need to step up a notch in their salad dressing."], ["Clayton T.", "Tonight's dining experience really wasn't very good. The atmosphere was nice and the waitress was very attentive.Unfortunately it was the food that wasn't very good. It wasn't horribly, just not very good. We started off with bruschetta and Joe's toast with provolone. The bruschetta was extremely tough and chewy which I wasn't fond of, but it had a pretty good taste.Both the Chicken Parmigiana and Chicken Alfredo that my wife and I ordered came out with good portions that looked good, however the taste was off on both. I'm not sure what it was that was off but neither of us ate more than a quarter of the portion.In the end we've decided Campisi's isn't for us."], ["A P.", "Food and service were fabulous! \u00a0We enjoyed the calamari, the lasagna and the spaghetti and meatballs.

However, I will never, ever eat there again and will do everything in my power to spread negativity to all of my friends and family who frequent downtown Ft. Worth. Last night, while in the cigar shop of the Sinclair Building (right next door to Picchi Pacchi, I needed to use the facilities. I'd been to Picchi Pacchi before, so knew where their restrooms were and did not know if the cigar shop had any. So I simply went over to Picchi Pacchi's. I ran upstairs, used the restroom and was headed back out. I'd eaten at Uno's and their restroom was closed for cleaning when I left, so it was my intent to simply slip in and use another restroom.After exiting the restroom, there was a male Picchi Pacchi employee posted on the stairs. He began talking to me but I wasn't really paying attention. When it registered that he was talking to me, I took in that he asked me \"did you ask someone to use the restroom.\" It was a tone and an approach that someone uses when they're looking to start a fist-fight. It threw me off. I said \"no. I didn't.\" He kept talking and raising his voice. This idiot was taking it to a whole other level, and before I did something stupid (I was 2 seconds away from waxing the floor with this rude, obnoxious idiot), I left.Picchi Pacchi - This isn't New York, and if you want to pretend like it is - either place signs up or lock your bathrooms.You're putting your employees in danger otherwise, because if you expect them to guard the bathrooms - a.) that's pathetic and b.) they're going to get hurt.

You order at a counter, and then they reheat your entree, which I don't really have a problem with; I didn't this to be a super fancy restaurant.Anyways, I got a calzone and a slice of cheese cake. The cheese cake was really great- awesome texture and sharp flavor. The clazone was a bit greasy on the inside and overly hard/crunchy on the outside (it was hard to cut it with a butter knife). I also had a bite (or 10) of one of my boyfriend's pieces of pizza, and it was pretty good. Not the best I've had, but still pretty tasty; it had a nice oregano-y taste to it.I couldn't justify giving this place more than 3 stars because of the slightly disappointing calzone, and the weird/awkward vibe I got from the guys and the lady working the front counter. They were not outwardly rude or anything, they just seemed to be annoyed that we all had long orders, and that they were all separate.

The food is pretty much always good. I've had the salads, pizza, and gyro. Great fast lunch if you work downtown, although on convention days, there can be long lines. Really there are only two drawbacks. 1.) if you order a gyro salad the price is ALWAYS different. I've attempted to figure this out by asking for receipts, double checking the menu, etc, but I've never figured it out. I've even gone with co-workers and the price is different when we order the same thing. I can't wrap my head around that. It can range from $9-$12 on any given day, but the salad is always the same. 2.) The straws for the drinks. They are unwrapped in a box by the soda machine. It's kinda gross because you watch everyone put there dirty hands in there to get a straw, while touching all the other straws. It's kinda gross, but I've come to accept it and just not get a straw there.Other than those 2 things, this place is great. I'm here usually once a week, and even though the price of things isn't always the same, it's always good. Actually, the lettuce and such on their salads might be the freshest I've had in Downtown Ft. Worth anywhere. Including some salad specific locations.**UPDATE** I have updated my review to 5 stars.

I was then informed that they owned the place! \u00a0I was blown away! \u00a0I told her that they would NOT be in business long if they keep running it like that and treating customers that way! \u00a0And I told her how her daughter had just embarrassed me in front of everyone and had been spying on our conversation and so on. \u00a0The lady apologized for her daughter as her daughter stood by giving me the worst looks, like if looks could kill kind of looks! \u00a0Then I told the lady at the cash register, that I was was NOT calling her any names, but that yes, she had been rude to me, then SHE starts to raise her voice at me. \u00a0All of this is in front of two people trying to pay for their meal. \u00a0Then they guy who is at the pizza area tells both of us to stop arguing!! \u00a0OH MY GOSH!! \u00a0Please tell me this is NOT happening! \u00a0Am I in a nightmare! \u00a0That is what I was thinking!!! \u00a0I just walked away! \u00a0I will not lower myself to their level! \u00a0It was total insanity in there! \u00a0I will surely never go back!!!My family and I freqently go out to eat, sometimes 4 or more times a week. \u00a0My husband and I both work in the travel industry and have been all around to many restaurants and have had all kinds of service from excellent down to horrible, but this certainly took the cake for the worst experience to date!!! \u00a0I was apalled to say the least! \u00a0As I told the owner, I am the customer and you do NOT ever treat a customer in such a way, that is if you expect to have repeat business and there is also word of mouth and I certainly will be getting the word out on how I was treated in there as I wouldn't want anyone else treated this way!!!"], ["Don C.", "Not bad for Texas pizza!"], ["Matthew J.", "I have had a fair amount of pizza at 2:30 a.m. in numerous cities.

Although I'm not Italian, I am a native European having vacationed in Italy for years as a kid/teenager and we had a native Italian in our company today. He did verify (and I do too) that the lasagna is REAL lasagna as the menu says. We were a group, one had the lasagna... And we tasted it. It is real lasagna as served in Italy with meat sauce. The b\u00e9chamel sauce was missing though or at least not enough. But very tasty overall with the meat sauce. No ricotta cheese to be seen ( yes, folks, that's an Americanization!!) The rest of us had pizzas. One wild mushrooms & leeks, one giancale and farm egg and one \"13th pizza\" - which it's the special - today it was with hatch chile, meat, roasted corn and fried onions. I cannot state enough how happy I was. The pizza pie was light, thin and crusty, just like in Italy as I remember. All very tasty in their own right. I sure will be back!!!!!!"], ["Jamie W.", "Pretty good pizza, wish it came out hot it was just warm!!!

It really matches the whole 7th street vibe. With the right amount of lighting to give it a very warm feel. The location is one of my favorite spots to enjoy an evening. The service was excellent. Very friendly and explained the specials with great description. Quinoa salad with fresh summer veggies was incredible. Fresh, light and delightful. We order the Iberian pie which was exploding with flavor. \u00a0Fennel salami had such a rich flavor, with smoked provolone to give it added depth. Castelvetrano olives had just the right amount to give it a bit more taste. Loved the yellow tomatoes on top, very fresh and juicy. The crust is light and crisp. Just what you would want in a perfect pizza. For dessert we had lemon mascarpone semifreddo which is frozen mascarpone cut into squares topped with this perfectly tart lemon curd , a pistachio crumble and blueberries. By far one of the best desserts I've enjoyed. It wasn't too sweet and the texture was interesting and unique. The lemon had enough sour and sweet to make it a top choice. One of my favorite meals by far."], ["Renee L.", "Based on the quality of the food, maybe a 4 but the potions are really small.

One pizza, salad and a pasta dish - $43 for this. Pizzas really only feed one hungry person. And we ordered a kale salad to go and it was the wrong salad.

I love to sit at the bar here and watch them make tasty creations. The bartenders are phenomenal. Very friendly, they make great suggestions and mix a mean drink too! I haven't had anything here that didn't delight me. I love the seasonal wood fired veggies- always rotating. I had a ricotta and corn stuffed hatch chile once- out of this world. My favorite salad is the panzanella- tomatoes, cheese, prosciutto, hand torn croutons, balsamic marinated red onion. Heaven. The pasta with bolognese is so fresh and flavorful. Garlicky- the pasta freshly made. As for the pizzas- I do try to get the 13th pie- whatever they have created for that week- or something loaded with porky bits- being a pork lover :) Drinks here rival The Usual for me. Hand crafted alcoholic treats. The ginger vodka soda is the best. I had a shot of Tuaca from a big glass dispenser that had fire roasted pineapples floating in it. It should be illegal- so tasty and I'm sure I could have kept drinking it like water. Love this place!

And Fireside Pies did just that.God I hate being *that* customer. Normally if I'm realizing that I'm hungry 1/2 hour or less before closing time, I just suck it up and have at the can of Pringles in the mini bar of my hotel. But I was with locals (your own Kendall S, in fact, Fort Worth!) and felt a bit more... Brave. And the staff here is so wonderful, so gracious, so utterly *angelic* to serve us without a sneer or even an OUNCE of reluctance. In fact, our server was just an all around nice dude. And our food and drinks came out quickly. And we inhaled them.The menu contains many amazing pizzas and I was undecided between the Burrata and the mushroom leek. I went with the latter because I love me some 'shrooms. I. Ate. The. Entire. Thing. And it was fiiiiiine. The perfect size and nice and thin. No pizza gut afterward. No deep feelings of regret.

The fresh and organized meats and cheeses in the see-through refrigerator adds to the open transparency of the place, as does the freshly made pastas hanging on drying wall racks ready for use! Well done from concept to completion!!! Oh yes!! The food...amazing!! Although a bit of a skeptic of mustard-based dressings, the Fancy House salad is nicely finished with a delightful true-mustard vinaigrette with seeds playfully dispersed throughout. The salad itself is enough to share as an opening act, or easily hoarded for oneself. Beautifully colored with field greens from the home-state (Texas, of course!) and a nice blend of perfectly sliced red and golden beets, compliment the ABUNDANT Marcona almonds and perfectly sliced old Manchego dusted with freshly ground black pepper!

Location location location--it's super important, and they definitely make the most of it. The atmosphere of the place inside really matches the overall vibe of the 7th Street/Crockett area, and makes Fireside all the more desirable of a place to eat at when you're hanging out around the area. It has been two years since my first review, and I must say that the overall quality of the place has not diminished at all. Which is impressive. Their pizzas are pretty solid and a good departure from your standard chain pizza; I really like their selection and the creativity of the pizzas. I personally like their Iberia (salami, provolone, sofritto, olives, etc.) and their homemade chicken sausage pizza. Another good one is their pizza with proscuitto and arugula--those two go really well together.

The floor is a stained concrete and the rafters are exposed. I love it! We sat near the corner where a stunning fountain stands trickling away.

I honestly could have split it with my friend who had the Kafta (?) sandwich which she said was good too. Both of our meals came with fries. My plate had a good amount but my friend noticed her unequal and small amount of fries and told me she considered asking the waitress for more but luckily the waitress came out at the same time with two baskets explaining that the cook actually noticed but just wanted to get our food out first. So yay for both of us! After my gyro, I somehow mustered the space to order a scoop of their Turkish Coffee ice cream which I crave to this day. I'm not one for coffee but this one was the right texture and authentic. Lord have mercy, I'm so big on texture. And this ice cream was smooth and had coffee grinds in it which gave it this complimenting graininess. It was only $2 for the scoop but it was a really small scoop. The disproportionate scoop was amplified in the already tiny bowl it came in. Overall, my experience was super worth it.

We were sat on the patio. It's completely covered so the shade was nice. There isn't much of a view since this place is sort of tucked away.After looking over the menu for a while and not knowing what to choose it was obvious that the buffet was the way to go. That turned out to be an excellent decision! Their buffet has a lot of the same items that are on the menu. So instead of trying to decide on one, I was able to try several. Yes, several.I'm not very big on buffets. Let's face it, most of them aren't that great. I also don't usually eat more than one plate (if it's piled right). Once I saw the buffet I knew immediately that wasn't going to be the case. I was careful to not overload on any one particular item.My favorites were the heavenly chicken and the lamb legs. The chicken was something different for me. I won't pretend to know what herbs or flavors I was tasting but I'm sure I haven't had anything like it before. The lamb legs came with the bone but the meat melted right off. Lamb tends to be a little on the chewy side so having it slow cooked was an interesting experience.

My coworkers and I work in the medical district and love to order delivery from this place but last night we decided to dine in when we found out they have a bar and hookah too. The service was excellent, the food delicious and flavorful, and all in a delightful atmosphere! We were happy to see Bradley as he had delivered food to us at work, and he's just as awesome as a waiter giving us everything we asked for and super pleasant. They have Mediterranean and Italian food, which I didn't think go together but it's nice to have both options in one place I suppose.Appetizers - I've had the Garlic Bread with mozzarella cheese, meatballs (3 large meatballs in marinara sauce), and hummus (served with 2 pita breads). All of them are delicious but probably my favorite is the garlic bread and cheese, sooooo yummy! Entrees come with garlic knots which are also good, but cheese makes everything better.Cocktails I tried were pomegranate Cosmo, watermelon mojito (which taste exactly as it's name) and something with midori and pineapple which was ridiculously sweet and my friend described as drinking the beach. I like my sweet martinis so the Pom Cosmo was perfect. They also have a decent beer selection and have a normal bar as well. Entrees - I ordered the heavenly chicken... Which is super awesome! Stuff chicken with cream cheese and penne pasta mixed in a creamy Alfredo sauce topped with spinach and chopped bacon. PERFECT. Love hands down. My friends ordered the grilled salmon, penne a la vodka, and kabob trio which they all thoroughly enjoyed too.Dessert - they offered us their pomegranate and Rose ice cream. Of course we were like, \"what does rose taste like?\" And it literally taste like the smell of a rose. I can't describe it any other way but it was good! So try it if you're curious, it's definitely worth it! Oh and the pom was good too. Hookah was pretty basic, they only had about 3 flavors but the owner was more than happy to bring flavors if we asked for next time. Lounge area/patio was nice and they had the big heater lamps to keep us warm and toasty. I also appreciated the random Indie rock station they had playing (they know what I like lol) The owner also approached our table and was extremely appreciative and super nice and friendly to us! I really love seeing that in family restaurants! Makes me feel much more welcomed and wanting to come back! For a Friday night we got a table for 8 at 8pm seated within 5min.

That's what happened to me last night at Cane Rosso. I had been waiting for all the hype (and 3 hour waits) to die down before we braved the crowds. I love the interior! The open kitchen, mismatched chandeliers and warm cozy feeling despite being very open. It wasn't very busy at all so we sat immediately and had a few separate servers taking care of us. We started with the house-made burrata which came with friarielli, arugula, crostini, and sea salt. We ended up asking for more crostini because the order only comes with 6 thin pieces and a huge ball of cheese! It's way more than enough for 3-4 people to share. The center was creamy and the arugula adds a nice peppery kick. For dinner I ordered the Paulie Gee pizza which has hot soppressata, caramelized onions, Calabrian chiles, hand-crushed San Marzanos, house-made mozzarella, and basil. This is by far one of the best pizzas I have had in recent memory. The chiles gave it just the right amount of heat and the crust was perfect. It's a knife and fork pizza for sure, but that is okay with me! The man friend ordered the Bolognese. This is my favorite thing we ate. The sauce was perfect. The noodles are made in house. It tasted identical to what my grandfather would make when I was a child. It was a massive portion and we ended up taking half of it home, along with 2 slices of pizza and half the burrata! We washed everything down with a nice red blend that one of the servers suggested- Gertrude Toscana. I had a lovely meal here. The service was good, the food was amazing and we were impressed.

Lightly breaded and tasty dipping sauce, I thought this was a winner. I was able to sway my lovely husband to ordering the capra salad (half order, plenty for us both and some for a few friends wanting samples) and the OMB. Both of these were so good, I was totally happy with our choices. We also had the opportunity to taste the proscciutto e rucola which was a complete opposite in flavor profile. It had a burst of freshness and this savory, salty party happening. Totally loved it. Another guy ordered a che cazzo. I wasn't daring enough to try it, as the visible handful of pepper seeds looked frightening. He really enjoyed it, my husband's mouth lit on fire from his sample slice. If you like heat - get this one. Another plus was definitely the service. Our server answered all our questions and walked through the basics when he discovered most of our group were first timers. He was funny and quirky and an all around nice guy.One boo point, they were either out or didn't make any sangria for the evening.

I was impressed with the sauce, it was creamy and well balanced. The spaghetti was cooked slightly over al dente but only slightly. The fresh baked bread was still warm from the oven and wonderful. The waiter was very kind and attentive and very Texan which I found funny because Bella is very clearly an Italian mom and pop shop. The hostess on the other hand was almost opposite. I'm not sure what she was doing when we arrived but she neither greeted us nor seated us.

For an appetizer we had the Mussels Marinara $6.95 and it was spectacular. The sauce was so flavorful. They serve a basket of garlic rolls. They were pretty good but I think they are too big. The food is so hearty they could go smaller with the bread I think. I tried the Capellini de Bella in pink sauce $8.95. I loved it. My date had the Chicken Portabella $10.95 and my son had the Chicken Romano $10.95 and every one of us really enjoyed our meal.

The parking lot was dark and right next to the place is a dollar store so it felt like we were gonna get robbed. Anyway....We were able to get a table right away. We ordered a calamari appetizer and we both ordered the penne vodka pasta (mixture of red and white sauce). The pasta was bad and the calamari was even worse!!!! The calamari at Blue sushi and Cheesecake Factory and Maggiano's tasted SOOOO much better, miles ahead. It was bland, like zero salt and the crust was too thick so it wasn't fried right and was falling off the squid. The squid itself was overcooked and rubbery. Probably from over-breading too! Felt like I was eating a crusty bland eraser.The pasta was not as bad but I've def had better jarred sauce. Again, it was bland zero salt bland. I had to add my own salt. Maybe that's what they do?? The penne was also overcooked so it was too soft. Definitely not al-dente. The only great thing I tasted that night was the olive oil that came as a dip for the garlic roll. But that probably came from a bottle. Garlic roll was okay. We would definitely not return, and would not recommend this place to anyone.

Needless to say, as my one star symbolizes it so well, it was a mistake. I got the lasagna. As our rule predicted, the food was bland. So bland. Nauseatingly bland. It was ever-so-slightly warm, it was gooey in the most unappetizing too-done pasta type of way, and it tasted of mostly cheese with a chunky meat undertone. A lot of the reviews mention the garlic bread, but all that was offered was plain bread. It was sliced, though, so maybe that's what everyone is so excited about?

They had an offer on Yelp to check-in and receive it for free. YUMMMM I had the chicken cannelloni. Spinach pasta tubes with chicken , cheese and spinach inside with sauce and melted mozzarella on top. It was really good. It came with house bread and salad. The house dressing vinaigrette has a wonderful taste. The garlic bread was a little dry but it was still tasty. I guess that is better than it being to greasy.

The food was fantastic. Traditional dishes passed down from family recipes with wonderful preparation and beautiful presentation. I opened up with the focaccia, mozzarella and tomatoes.

The baked ziti and meatballs were fantastic. Great texture and a wonderfully creamy meat sauce. Dessert was a great finish with cappuccino pie. I also was fortunate to taste the carpaccio appetizer as well. Very nice presentation with a soft dijon sauce.The real jewel of Aventino's is the family behind the food.

I do like spicy! There were very nice pieces of tender cubed beef in the ravioli, and that did pair well with the sweet potato, fresh sage, and champagne brown butter sauce.My husband's mashed potatoes were creamy and buttery like you love mashed potatoes to be. \u00a0The pork chop was a tad overdone, but the we loved the grilled taste. \u00a0We were expecting a balsamic glaze, or some other Italian glaze on the chop, but the glaze tasted like it had a touch of soy sauce in it. \u00a0It wasn't bad, just didn't quite fit an Italian restaurant.Dinner portions are large and quite satisfying.My only other very minor complaint is that salad is extra. \u00a0I always like a small side salad to come with my meal.During the week, we noticed that this restaurant does have nice Happy Hour offerings, so we'll have to hit that up in the future."], ["Eric T.", "A long overdue review. I came here with the Mrs. for dinner to celebrate my 40th birthday with the expectation that I was just going to have a very good dinner and be stuffed like a Thanksgiving turkey for the rest of the night. I left the restaurant with those same expectations exceeded, less full, and pleased at the same time. Here's why in brief.First, we were given the option of ordering off of the menu, or in having the chef (Scott) go completely off the book and make whatever we had a taste for. We opted for the latter, which turned into a creative fusion of asparagus & shrimp appetizers, a fist-sized salad with homemade vinaigrette, and 5-ounces of salmon and scallops that concluded the first three courses of a four course meal. The dessert was a very rich tiramisu with chocolate covered strawberries, followed by a second glass of red wine that I cannot pronounce yet had an early 2000 era vintage. As well as the red wine tasted with the three courses, it tasted even better with the tiramisu!Chef Scott, as well as his staff, were unbelievably attentive throughout the evening. So much so that the two of us would get the occasional stare towards our booth from patrons wondering why we were receiving the Queen Elizabeth treatment. The interior decor is quite decadent, if not mesmerizing when you consider an evening meal after 7 PM and with the lights turn down a bit, the music smoother. This is one of those places that you just don't ever want to leave. So glad that its in the Hulen area, right over the bridge. Thank you, Bravo! Cucina Italiana!"], ["Santanu S.", "Having attended an event here several weeks ago, I was very eager to try their regular menu. It was definitely worth the drive from workFor starters, there was no wait for a table when I arrived. I was seated \u00a0very quickly. As soon as I sat, my waiter came by to get my beverage order. My initial thought was a glass of chianti, so I got the San Fabiano Chianti.I told my waiter that I was interested in something flavorful. The Broiled Talipia with the Spicy Tomato Sauce was the lighter of the two recommendations. I ordered the Caprese Salad as the light salad would complement my entree.The salad did not disappoint. If there were any more mozzarella cheese and tomato slices, the salad could be a meal in itself. There was the right amount of balsamic dressing not to overwhelm the flavor of the cheese or tomatoes.What can I say about the tilapia? First, it was delicious even without the sauce. Since it wasn't drowning in the sauce, the fish could be easily be eaten without it. Because of this spicy sauce, I noticed I ended up finishing the entire plate, vegetables and all. Yes, I finished every piece of the couscous, zucchini and green beans.Now, when it comes to dining at an Italian restaurant, I always order the tiramisu. Well, did you know there is a dessert flight?! Yes, three small desserts which consists of a vanilla bean creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, a chocolate/peanut butter brownie, and Bravo's take on the cannoli. Choosing a light salad and a light entree provided plenty of room to eat the three \"mini\" desserts.The only mistake I made was eating the focaccia bread which is placed at each table. Like the Lay's potato chip, you can't eat just one. Fortunately for me, the salad arrived when I ate the second piece of bread."], ["Becky K.", "This was my first yelp event and I must say it was a lot of fun.

The waiters/waitresses came around very promptly for drink orders. They had choices of beer, wine and sangria. Sangria was good but very sweet. They then passed around delicious appetizers of; fried ravioli, shrimp, and mozzarella meatball sliders. They also had a buffet of pizza, chicken flatbread and tomato/basil and mozzarella crostini. While having a great conversation with my new table friends they brought out the desserts; creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, chocolate mousse and tiramisu. The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was creamy and luscious.

Tonight we started with the Shrimp Napoli, like always, and you MUST order this dish. Fried shrimp with an amazing lemony-tomato sauce. Yummmm. Then I ordered the lobster ravioli and the lobster bisque. I have a little love affair going on with lobster if you can't tell. The bisque is probably the best one I've had! So good. And the ravioli is always top notch. My bf ordered the veal parmesan (at least I think that's what it's called) and he loved it. Also on this trip we tried out the patio for the first time. We will be sitting out there from now on when the weather is nice. Service was once again great. We'll continue to come to Bravo for many many more dinners, it's our go to place if we want guaranteed awesome food."], ["Krista R.", "Bravo is somewhat new to the Hulen area. A few years ago, the Covey closed its doors and Bravo replaced it. Bravo has a classy feel to it without being classy. Good for groups, families, and a date! It's pretty on the inside.

They were bland and didn't have much going for them. I told my husband I wouldn't eat here again. However, I kept hearing good things about this place. The Brunch is supposed to be really good. The husband wanted to give it another try again, so why not! Everyone deserves a 2nd or 3rd try. You start off with bread with an oil based dip. My husband got the Sausage Tortelloni. I got the Grilled Chicken Marsala. The grilled chicken marsala wasn't on the lunch menu, but the waiter said they would be able to make it. He asked if I wanted a single breast or two, which I appreciated because I didn't think I could eat two. It comes with mashed potatoes and fresh vegetables. Their fresh vegetables were just green beans. I also got the Insalata Della Casa salad. I didn't really care for the salad. It was just lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, bacon, and crispy things with Parmesan dressing, so I don't really know what it was. I just wasn't feeling it. I was pleased with my grilled chicken marsala. Plenty of mushrooms! I liked my husband's meal as well.We had the white chocolate bread pudding and it was delicious! Bravo is a chain, but the food is freshly made and it didn't roll in on the Lisanti food truck. It's much better than Olive Garden, I think.

It's a little pricey, but definitely worth it.For my beverage I had their special White Peach Sangria. This is a perfect drink for Summer. It was sweet (but not to sweet), cool, fruity and refreshing. Each glass was garnished with a piece of orange and strawberry. Now on to the ambience! I sat at out on the patio, which was a GREAT decision. The area is filled with plenty of seating, including cushioned benches and cushioned chairs surrounding a giant marble fire place.

Finally tried Bravo! on Sunday evening - it was slow so we were seated very quickly, and our waitress was quick. So, that's good. My mom was having trouble deciding her meal, so we had to keep asking our waitress to come back. As so often happens with this situation at nearly every restaurant I've been to, there is that one-too-many \"come back in minute\" request that ends up waiting far longer than necessary. In this case, it was the same - we were decided for a few minutes and our waitress was busy chatting at the kitchen. I had to wave my arm to hopefully get attention of someone, who turned out to be the manager.Menu options were \"ok\". As a vegetarian, I was remiss to find that unlike most other Italian eateries, there were only two non-meat dishes. And, unfortunately, neither of them was appealing to me (I don't like eggplant [parmesean]; and I don't like sundried tomatoes + pine nuts + feta combinations - it tastes like throwing up in my mouth). Everything, aside from the salads and a margherita pizza, came with meat. There was no plain old spaghetti, primavera, ravioli, etc. I suppose if this is Roman food, that maybe they eat a lot of meat. The waitress said I could just tell her what I wanted and they'd make it (though, I didn't know what I wanted, just what I didn't want). I do allow myself to eat seafood in a pinch, so instead of inventing something I ordered a spicy scallop entree. It was super \"meh\". One thing I found odd: they put breadcrumbs on many items. I thought my entree would come out like a baked dish with the breadcrumbs a little crust on top, but no... it was a very juicy pasta dish with the breadcrumbs seemingly out of place atop the pile. Scallops were overcooked. Everything was soggy. Even the leftover container leaked severely on the ride home.My dad had the chicken caprese - said it was ok. He thought the balsamic vinegar on it was odd. My mom got the lobster ravioli, and thought it was good. It was a lot and she could only eat a fraction of the serving.The pre-dinner salads were ok. My dad and I each got the chopped which was tasty, but slightly overdressed and thus a bit more macerated than I'd hope. My mom thoroughly enjoyed the Caesar. Yet... we were barely finishing our salads when our entrees came out. This is a *huge* pet peeve of mine. When you have to shove all your plates around because the staff couldn't time your meal correctly. My mom wanted to finish her salad so she had to cram two plates in.. The waitress never blinked or offered to come back. Poor form, Bravo.The big rub for me was this: overpriced entrees (really, Olive Garden I think would be better) and you have to add $3.99 for a salad! The few appetizers they offer (really, few) except for the caprese, were all over $10. So, we tried something new. We were very unimpressed, and next time we'll just go to The Tavern down the street which is fantastic."], ["Le E.", "I had a weekday dinner here with a coworker and our experience wasn't anywhere as memorable as other reviewers. She and I both ordered wine and it took several back and forth trips from the waiter to actually bring our glasses. I ordered the lasagna and asked the waiter about the portion size. He suggested getting the smaller size because the diners always take leftovers home from the normal dinner size. Well I took his suggestion and once my entree arrived, it was the tiniest piece of lasagna I've ever seen. It was so sad. Worst of all as we were wrapping up our dinner and paying our tab, there was another waiter standing next to us with broom in hand waiting for us to get up. He literally interrupted our conversation so he could sweep under our table. It was only 9pm."], ["Angelica L.", "My boyfriend and I got dinner togo from here last night. I got the grilled salmon salad and he got the chicken scaloppini. The food tasted good, but the descriptions on the menu were misleading. My grilled salmon salad was supposed to come on a bed of field greens but what I really got was a thin layer of field greens layered on top of cheap iceberg lettuce. I don't know if they do this when you dine in, but it is completely unacceptable. My boyfriend's dish had good pasta but the chicken was just ok. We both really loved the rosemary bread but we wished we would have gotten oil and vinegar for dipping instead of some tomato oil dip. Overall the meal was ok. The thick layer of iceberg lettuce under very little field greens on my dish really put me in a bad mood about this place."], ["Susan S.", "I wish there was a BRAVO! in Arlington. I LOVE this place. Excellent food, service and atmosphere. Can't beat it."], ["Dave M.", "Excellent service and the food is very good. The menu selections are well done. They do an excellent job on the pizza.Overall, you will always enjoy your experience at Bravos"], ["Chuck M.", "I got introduced to this place through a YELP Elite event. I have also dined at their sister restaurant, Brio, in Southlake. I was in the area for lunch and decided to stop in and dine. I'm glad I did.My meal started out with warm bread and an olive oil infused with different spices and peppers. I ordered the 1/2 order of lasagna accompanied with a 1/2 order of my choice of salad. I decided on Bravo's Chopped Salad.My salad was delivered to my table shortly after ordering. It consisted of chopped iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, feta cheese and a very tasty vinaigrette.Shortly after finishing my salad, my entree was delivered to my table. Bravo's lasagna was very delicious and packed full of meat. It was layer upon layer of gooey goodness. I can't wait to return to Bravo again real soon to explore more menu options."], ["Jennifer Y.", "Basically, a glorified Macaroni Grill. The food was way overpriced for the quality. Typical chain Italian restaurant, but a bit more pricey than Olive Garden or Macaroni Grill. Service was slow to start, but overall no complaints."], ["De M.", "The best food, ambiance, price and service. Can't go wrong with this restaurant. Love it!!!"], ["Justin B.", "Had the Grilled Chicken with Balsamic vinaigrette. It was ok, not amazing. Price was reasonable. What I did not expect was to go to a $12+ a plate Italian Restaurant for lunch and be seated 3 feet from a 1 year old's birthday party. Complete with noise makers. There was room enough in the dining room to have separated \"regular\" patrons from the 1 year old. \u00a0They probably should have done that. I won't rush back, but I wouldn't refuse to go again if that is where the group wants to go."], ["Cheryl S.", "Ok I'm not gonna lie, you feel like you just stepped into Rome, Italy in this place. \u00a0I'm pretty sure I want to have them come decorate my crib when they get a chance and if that wasn't enough to make you want to fall in love with this place, then the mesmerizing smells coming from their brick oven pizza will definitley take you to paradise. \u00a0The staff is friendly and eager to serve you. \u00a0Check, I like! \u00a0The dishes are top notch and consist of quality food. \u00a0Check 2, I really like and oh yeah it's close to my crib, uh I mean house....Check 3, done deal!Check out their great happy hour menu of food and drink specials and their dinner dishes do not disappoint. \u00a0It's on the pricier side but you will savor every delicious bite, trust me. \u00a0The spicy encrusted planked salmon with scallops will make you feel like it was prepared just for you and the veal scallopini will give any Italian woman a run for her placement in the family. \u00a0And you know what family I'm referring to! I suggest you come check it out for yourself and when your there, I understand if it might be too hot but if you dare to step outside, you will feel like you are in a 5* resort with their beautiful outdoor seating. \u00a0I'm just waiting for them to close so I can get \"locked\" inside and pretend I live there for a night! A lot cheaper than going to Mexico ha!"], ["Kerry M.", "OK, so for me, it's all about the service. Let me start out by saying that the food was good. Lobster Ravioli and Pasta Woozie (a chicken pasta dish) was eaten by me and my girlfriend. No complaints about the food. Service was horrible by standards for this type of restaurant. We elected to sit at the bar and eat there as we arrived at almost 7pm and the place wasn't packed, but we could easily sit there immediately and typically get much better service. Wrong at this place. The Bar tenders (Robert and Andy, whose names we didn't find out until AFTER dinner had been served) waited on people on both sides of us, while we sat there and patiently waited almost 10 minutes to be spoken to, then a quick drop off of menus and to tell us he'd give us a few minutes to look over the menu. Almost 10 minutes later and waiting on just about every other person at the bar, some twice, Robert graced us with his presence, no small talk, how are you doing tonight, etc. just What can I get you? Fine, I know he's busy, White Peach Sangria for the girl and a Peroni for me. They are out of Peroni so he has to run to the back to get some (doesn't tell me this, just takes off). Ends up after Andy made the girls drink (Which was AWESOME!) here comes Robert with a 12 pack of mildly cool Peroni from the back. Opens the bottle and places it in front of me, while walking by. Now every other person at the bar is drinking from Cold Glasses. Doesn't even offer me one. I suck it up because it's semi cool. (Really Strike 2 at this point). We get our dinner and the food is fine, we have to ask for Bread, we weren't offered any. It just seemed like we were invisible to the bartenders. The only interaction we had with Andy was when Robert asked him to make the White Peach Sangria while he ran to get Peroni. Next strike came when I asked for another Peroni. It came out of the same 12 pack carton sitting on the shelf, 20 minutes later that still hadn't been placed into the cooler. I asked for a cold glass (Like everyone else had been offered) and while I saw him look in the cooler and didn't see any glasses, he came up empty, no cold glasses available, they are out. A few minutes later he must have noted the disgust on my face and finally decided to place some Peroni into the freezer and made a point of letting me know he was going to place some in the freezer for me in case I wanted any more. Sure enough, 15 minutes later I asked for another. This time in the back, there was also a magical frozen glass to be found, that apparently wasn't there before. Halfway through drinking the last beer from the cold frozen glass, I then noticed that the glass was chipped on the top with a razor sharp edge. Last straw. I did mention to him that he should probably throw away the glass as we left after paying the bill and while I offered up a meager 12% tip (I've had bad days before as well), it was nowhere near the normal 25-40% and higher that I have been known to leave for excellent service and food. Ya know Bravo! Managers/Servers/BarTenders/Owners, it only takes one bad experience to turn someone away forever. I for one will never be back. It was simply a horrible service experience and having been a bartender in a past life, simply inexcusable. Sorry Robert and Andy (Bartenders), last night was not fun for me and my girl and I hope you get the direct message, because I'm certain without a doubt you know exactly the couple you dissed with your poor service."], ["Stella W.", "We walked in last Sunday a few minutes after 1pm and there was still about a 15-20 minute wait for a table inside. The nice hostess suggested that we could sit at the bar immediately without any wait, so we decided to do that. The bartender, Ashley, immediately introduced herself and her other co-workers to us. We had the Mimosa and Peach Bellini (frozen) from the bar. I personally loved the Mimosa because it was a nice change to have it made with freshly squeezed orange juice instead of the concentrate. We were having a hard time deciding on the appetizer and Ashley was nice enough to suggest the Margherita Stuffed Flatbread which we loved. I loved the Grilled Salmon Pasta that I ordered from the \"Lighter Side of Rome\" menu. \u00a0Everything on this menu is 550 calories or less. The salmon was perfectly cooked and the veggies were so fresh and tasty. The sauce was just right and not too oily or creamy at all. My hubby liked his Pasta Pomodoro with Chicken too. \u00a0I had a taste of his chicken and liked how tender it was. All the dishes were perfectly seasoned and not too oily or salty at all. We didn't get a chance to try their desserts but Ashley said that the Cheesecake and Cr\u00e8me Brulee are a must try. I forgot to mentioned that after we had our appetizer and was waiting for our entr\u00e9e, the manager actually came over to apologize about how long our main courses were taking. We didn't even say anything at all and had only been waiting for about 10 minutes. \u00a0Therefore, we were quite surprised that she noticed and was so nice about it. \u00a0I can't believe that this restaurant just had their grand opening on 8/1, because they definitely have everything down already. \u00a0Final Verdict: Everyone must come and give it a try. \u00a0They have Happy Hour every Monday-Friday from 3:30-6:30pm."], ["John C.", "I particularly like Bravo for their brunch. \u00a0I have had the Tuscan omelette and the turkey sausage eggs Benedict and they were both excellent. \u00a0Also I cannot leave out the doping bread which is great. \u00a0The employees are very friendly and accommodating. They also have a dessert made up of small samples that is great for sharing. \u00a0Highly recommend Bravo!Added 9-10-15: \u00a0We have continued to go to Bravos. The menu has changed twice and food is still very good. They will fix items from past menus. \u00a0Really like the place."], ["Ashley L.", "Overall this place is delicious and at a very decent price.

Would surely go back again."], ["Jason E.", "Terrible service. Mediocre food. Host did not speak. It took 10 minutes for server to arrive. We only saw her once after ordering. Had to find someone else to bring our check. I ordered the pasta primavera and there was stray beef in the sauce. A busboy carried a large bag of trash out in between several tables of diners. I asked for a manager when we left and it took the hostess 10 minutes to find one. The manager thanked me for my complaints and apologized. We will not return."], ["Jon W.", "Bravo is to Italian dining as Frank Sinatra's golden pipes are to a croon-fueled seduction. I have proof. \u00a0I'm sure everyone has already attested to this new restaurant's supreme food quality as well as the classy modern ambiance. What I'd like to point out is the exceptional management and staff. At the height of dinner rush with a line out the door this place is fun and festive with staff that are calm, collected, fast and efficient, not to mention fun. This is a staple in our Fort Worth dining arsenal now. The chicken pesto was a delight (picture provided). We experienced exceptional creativity and quality in both our low cost appetizer and our moderately priced entrees. What a great value and a classy experience.

Almost too fast, cause it made us wnder if the food was being prepared fresh or just re-heated. \u00a0 The taste was good and I don't want to sound displeased, but I guess I was expecting more, maybe too much.
