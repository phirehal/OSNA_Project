Now the place is so overcrowded because the secret got out. I have to have this place at least once a month for lunch buffet. I've also considered having them cater different private events for us too. There's nothing on the menu I don't like! Saffron Chicken is my favorite, but it's hard to choose what I love most! I also like how a beverage is included in the cost. $12.99"], ["Samantha S.", "I love Terra! Whether you're going for buffet lunch or dinner, it's a good choice. I like their kabob chicken, rice, hummus/pita, tabouli, all their veggies, and curried chicken. Going for the buffet lunch is a blessing and a curse, there's so much delicious food but only so much room in your stomach. After polishing off three plates, I still crave the curry. I find myself strategizing by resisting more delicious pita bread for the cauliflower. Yummy Mediterranean food, huzzah!"], ["Alejandra Y.", "We had a great dinner here! It was a crowded Saturday night, but service was fast and consistent throughout the meal. We had the Vegetarian Moussaka appetizer which was delicious and rich; it could have been a meal on its own!My boyfriend had the lamb skewer and I had the shrimp. The plates had a ton of food, and it was all well seasoned. The vegetables could have used less oil. And I wouldn't bother with the baklava because it's really not authentic--too gooey and sweet."], ["Marty B.", "Let me preface this review by saying I've visited Terra three times in total. The first two visits were lovely, but the third visit was disappointing. The food has been consistently very good, but the service this time was a bummer. I ordered a gyro, but was only brought a plate of shaved meat. No pitas, veggies, rice, sauce...you know the drill. When I asked if the rest of it was on it's way out, our waiter apologized and said he would ask them to make me the full gyro plate and not just the gyro meat. It took roughly another 15-20 minutes for the rice, sauce and veggies turn up, but by that time the meat was cold. Another 5-10 minutes to get some pita bread (from a different friendly waitress). 20 minutes to get our check. In total we were at Terra for about an hour and a half (most of which was waiting), even though there were only two of us and the dinner crowd was pretty sparse. Our waiter, while polite, just was not on his game. I would be willing to try Terra again (because the food is good), but I hope the unfortunate service experience was an isolated event."], ["Jessica S.", "What a pleasant surprise! We stopped in to Terra on a Friday evening just to try something new... and boy were we happy we did! The food here was absolutely delicious!PROS:* Best hummus and baba ghanouj I've ever had! Super creamy and just perfect with their oh-so delightful pita bread* Awesome menu with tons of options. Our favorite was the New Zealand Lamb Kabob. Order it medium and your tummy will be very thankful you did so. This is served with a tasty saffron rice and some savory roasted vegetables.* Very personable server named Aaron. He was very honest about what to order and what not to order on the menu, and we definitely appreciated his frankness.CONS:* The layout of the space is quite awkward. Some of the tables are a bit uncomfortable looking, especially the one we sat at up against the window with a pillar halfway through our table. Could be fine for a party of 2. But there were 3 of us and this seating arrangement was pretty odd.* Staff seemed a little under-dressed and a bit on the sloppy side. Get your servers to tuck in their shirts and to look more professional. * The decor was a little off to me. Seemed like their intentions were to have a modern restaurant, but the awkward open kitchen which was half taken over by an awkward buffet, was very much out of place. The buffet wasn't even set up (and thank goodness it wasn't... I would have walked out had a noticed it right when we walked in). So, I am not sure what the point of it was. Time to rip that out and rearrange the layout of your tables."], ["Izzy W.", "I love when they do the buffets. You get to sample everything and it's all so yummy! There's normally a wait around noon but worth it."], ["Patricia E.", "Large variety lunch buffet; even at 1:30P on a Wed there was plenty to eat. Would have preferred a little more lamb options and a few less ground beef but found enough to leave there full. Waiter was very pleasant and brought my drink promptly, and a side of pita bread since I couldn't get to it through all the others at the buffet. Perhaps dropping a couple of pieces at each table with the drinks could be implemented?Dirty dishes were quickly removed and even though it's a buffet, the waiter checked on me often. Definitely worth the $12.99 price (includes tax & drink; grat extra)."], ["Michelle L.", "Favorite resteraunt in Ft Worth! Excellent food and love sitting outside on the patio. Reasonably priced."], ["Raissa W.", "Went to Terra today with a friend. Had heard this place was good but didn't truly know what to expect. I had glanced at the menu briefly before arriving so I anticipated ordering a couple things. Had no idea that the lunch rush is actually a buffet! Totally unexpected but totally delicious. Pricing was $12.99/pp for the buffet. Not terrible considering the locale. I got to try a few things that I'd probably not order and boy was I surprised. There was not one thing I ate that I didn't enjoy! Honestly I can't pronounce or remember the names of most of the food but you just can't go wrong here - so authentic and delicious. The restaurant was definitely a popular place to be. We had to wait for a table but it was a short 10 minutes. I truly recommend everyone trying this place out.

A tad on the pricey side. I've only been here with girlfriends, as my husband has simpler (ie., cheaper) tastes.On the last visit, my friend and I split a Haloumi Cheese ($10; sheep's cheese with mint and olive oil). Delicious and rich. We also had sangria, which was very sweet, on par with grape juice. For my entree, I got the Kibbie ($15; baked, though they have a fried option). The menu described it as \"ribeye beef, wheat, onion, pine nuts, served with saffron rice, tabouli salad & ziziki sauce.\" Great, we both ordered it.The waiter asked if we ever had it and gently mentioned that most people who get it for the first time return it because it's not what they expect. I asked him what he meant and he said it's the seasoning that turns people off. My friend backtracked and just got a giant tabouli salad. To Hell with the populace, I want the kibbie!Here's how I'd describe it: Mediterranean meatloaf. Yeah. The rib eye is ground with the seasoning (nutmeg, cardamom, and cinnamon notes to my amateur palate), blended with wheat and onion with a nice topping of pine nuts. My friend didn't care for the corner I gave her, but I enjoyed it. Topped it with zizki sauce and mixed in the rice and tabouli and I was in flavor country. I ate the whole thing, but I admittedly I am a good eater :3"], ["Kyle L.", "Love the lunch buffet. I would come for the bread and hummus alone. Coming from a native Metro Detroiter, where the Arabic/Mediterranean food might be the best in the USA, the struggle is real finding decent options in that vein here in DFW.

Can't beat a plethora of options and the right to stuff yourself to the gills for $12.99!"], ["Rashell M.", "I've been here on several occasions and am never disappointed in their food.

Service is sometimes questionable. But I'll continue to come back for their food."], ["Chris M.", "If you give this place any less than 5-stars, you need your head examined. The lunch buffet is only $12 and includes a soft drink. I feel like I'm robbing them, it's such a good deal. Especially since the food and gyros (all you can eat gyros!!!) are to die for. Everything is homemade and fresh. It's so good, it's ridiculous. Get here early if you're doing the lunch buffet, because the word is out. You may have to wait. Worth. The.

Now keep in mind I am not a Greek or Mediterranean gourmand, but everything I tried here was delicious! The atmosphere is very nice, and the place was very clean. The saffron chicken and saffron rice really stood out to me, I had never had anything like it before, and it is to die for! The chicken kebob was also out of this world! The coriander potatoes were fabulous. There was not one single item I tried that I didn't like. My one tip is to get there early. We were there when it opened, and by 11:30 the place was swarming with people, and by the time we left it was standing room only with people waiting on tables to clear! I can't wait to go back, it was a really good experience."], ["Suzanne W.", "I came here awhile ago, but had a pretty good experience!

The grape leaves had a weird taste and we returned them. Usually dont do that but couldn't finish half of 1. The fried kibbe was good but $4 for 1 a little bigger than a large egg is kind of a ripoff but oh well..I ordered the trout. And the bf ordered the lamb gyro plate. The trout came with this weird sauce that killed the raste of the fish. Real heavy and strong. \u00a0Fyi if u have a nice piece of trout than u don't need that sauce with it. All in all it was decent. \u00a0Will I return probably not but who knows"], ["Sunny P.", "It was my first time eating at a Mediterranean buffet, and I was a little hesitant at first, since my diet only consists of eating chicken, fish, and vegetables. As far as the chicken went, I had the saffron chicken and the chicken kabob, and both dishes were very flavorful and tender. The chicken kabob was very lean, and it is a good choice for people who are following a high protein diet. As for the vegetable dishes, I had the spinach and the roasted cauliflower. The roasted cauliflower was amazing, since I don't typically eat cauliflower, but the seasoning on the cauliflower made it spectacular. The spinach dish was good, but it was a little overly bland. Tips: 1. When you ask for a drink, you are only allowed to have one drink per buffet. 2. You pay for the buffet before you are seated"], ["Jun E.", "Their lunch buffet is great!!!

Service was good, the waiter knew exactly when he was needed and was never hovering around and always seemed to appear at the right times.They bring out delicious hot and fresh naan to eat with olive oil while you wait and it is addicting. I am glad I saved room for the main course which were kafta and grilled shrimp kabobs served with saffron rice and vegetables. I really liked how you could get a mix of kabobs to try differen things. I had never had kafta before and it was basically a spice infused lamb and beef meatball and it was awesome. The shrimp was perfectly grilled with a nice crunch on the inside and juicy tenderness on the inside. The saffron rice may have been the best part of the dish, it was moist and flavorful and really complimented the meat. Even the seasoned grilled vegetables held there own as some of the best tasting vegetables I've had at a restaurant.Everything was so good I kind of ate in a sloppy rush and wolfed it down just because it was so rich and flavorful and I couldnt stop myself. I ate every bite and cleaned the plate and it was definitely a generous amount of food. Thats how good it was.

We were circling there to be a buffet. Turns out it's only during the week, my mistake. But we decided to try it anyway. The hummus lacked flavor, I ended up making my own by adding salt and pepper and I'm not a person who uses salt. Their gyros are in a style to create your own, that was different. I ordered a Greek salad with chicken but instead it came with lamb. So I had to wait about 20 minutes for the chicken. By that time I was already done with my salad. The pita was a hit or miss. Sometimes it came fresh and others it was hard and a bit cold. I've had much better Mediterranean food than here.

Ground beef with eggplant and a tomato-base sauce on top of rice--yummy.A friend ordered the chicken shwarma, which was also tasty, well-seasoned, and totally not dry.

The waitress never asked me for my drink order. She did finally bring water at least...30 minutes later.2. My sister ordered the stuffed Cornish hen. The menu says to allow 20+ minutes for cook time. The dish came out after about 5 minutes. My sister did not like it and barely ate any...she sent it back but they didn't offer to refund her money. A couple hours later (yes...we were there for 3+ hours), we looked over and were horrified to see a tray of 5-6 cooked Cornish hens sitting out on top of a tall appliance. They were still sitting there when we left. 3. Aside from my sister mentioned above, everyone else's food took *at least* 45 minutes and everything came out at different times. My food took over an hour (beef kabobs & rice).4. My mother ordered the stuffed squash. The waitress asked her if she'd like shaved lamb or ground beef. My mother said \"shaved lamb.\" When the dish came out, it had ground beef in it. When my mother asked about the lamb, the waitress insisted, \"That dish does NOT come with lamb.\" She then proceeded to argue with my mother about it.4a. So I heard of something else that happened that night. Our friend also was asked if he wanted beef or lamb. He said lamb. When his meal was brought out...it was a ground meat. He gave the plate to the waitress and asked \"Is this ground beef?\" And she said, \"Yep!\" Then he said, \"I ordered lamb.\" The waitress then lifted the plate to her nose, took a big long whiff, and said, \"Oh yes, this is lamb.\" 5. I think the waitress knew we were dissatisfied with her service, but she did nothing to remedy it. Oh ok, at one point she came by with 2 random salads and said \"Who wants an extra side salad? They're freeee!\" as if that was an amazing offer.6. We were there so long (not by choice...that was mostly time spent waiting around for food) that we saw both belly-dancing performances (one at 8 and one at 11).7. My other sister ordered a cheese pita and french fries for the kids...these took the longest to receive. They were finally brought out around 10pm (perfect meal time for children). The fries weren't fries...more like homestyle potatoes. They were sizzling hot...so you'd think they were fully cooked...nope, when they finally cooled down and we could touch them...they were completely hard and raw on the inside. Yum.8. Everyone, except me, said their food was bland. There were lots of full plates, if you know what I mean. My food alone is where the 1-star comes from. So...if you have to go here, get the kafta kabobs I guess. But tell them eeeaasy on the onions! It was covered in raw onions (I LIKE raw onion...but this was too much).9. When we were ready to go...we couldn't find the waitress. This isn't really a big place, but she was nowhere to be found. Finally, we saw that she had emerged and was at the computer. She was there for, I kid you not, 25-30 minutes trying to figure out our checks. 10. We were charged an \"entertainment fee.\" LOL. $1 per person.------Since my food was decent, and I guess I was in a chill mood, I was ok with my check when it finally came. My total was $20, which included kafta kabobs, water, and crappy service. But...I really feel bad for others in my party who paid $100+ for horrible food that they didn't eat. No compensation was offered...so I'm gonna have to say the waiter service and customer service here are appalling. Maybe this girl was new.....but IF she was new, why on earth was no one helping her? And...her being new has nothing to do with the speed of the kitchen.... And...why didn't they care that customers hated their food? And....none of that can explain why a tray of cooked meat was sitting out in room temperature... So, ONE STAR - for the kabobs. And because I have to put at least 1 star."], ["Chris J.", "Great Lebanese/Middle Eastern food. The week day offers a buffet that includes a large variety of Lebanese dishes.

Having traveled around the world and lounged/dined at many establishments, I can say with full confidence that Byblos was by far some of the worst service and drinks I have ever had. Upon walking in, I had already stepped into the hookah lounge when a waitress with curly hair demanded my ID and for me to step back out into the lobby. No greeting, just plain rudeness. I felt like I was in trouble. After scanning my ID, she just sat at the computer so I walked back into the lounge and had a sit. About 15 minutes later, a young waitress walked in and just bluntly asked me \"Do you know what you want?\" I was dumbfounded and asked for a menu. I was handed a hookah menu only. She had no suggestions other than \"they're all good.\" I settled for the hubbly bubbly Blue Mist with Ciroc. Placing this order was like trying to talk to someone who speaks no English or else is totally lost. Was rather awkward. She ran off and I tried to flag her back down for a drink menu, meanwhile, another waitress who looked like an angry Morticia Adams came in and asked if we were there because we were bored. What? Are you criticising my choice to visit this establishment? Maybe it was an indirect sign that the night was going to suck and there must have been no other options for entertainment. 20 minutes go by and finally I am able to grab the waitress and ask for a drink menu. I got the Bahama Mamma and my friend \u00a0ordered the jalape\u00f1o cucumber margarita. We asked for specific liquors and she looked like a deer in headlights. I probably got well but paid premium. Hookah is just now arriving. Drinks take another 20 minutes and are super ugly. My drink just had a measly marichino cherry stuffed onto a Southwest Airlines looking cocktail thing sitting across the top of my drink. It rolled off the drink when I sat the cup down. My friend had a huge, hideous, dirty, and wilted cucumber slice on hers. Neither of the drinks tasted good, we're overly sweet, and I doubt there was any alcohol in them. The hookah was alright but about 2hrs in, we were way past ready to go. We asked for the check and the waitress never brought it so we asked someone else to bring it. I paid with a card and my friend paid in cash and we asked for the check to be split. Apparently this was super confusing for them to half a 50$ ticket. After one waitress said it was all another ones fault, it finally got taken care of only for my friend to be shorted by 10$. When we immediately notified them, they acted as if we were crazy and pocketed ten to try and get ten more dollars. Needless to say I will never go back here ever again. I wanted to just get up and leave about 30 minutes into my visit.

For the $$- not what is expected. Just to follow up regarding their 'odor issue' : the restroom was worrisome at best. The commode had some strange contraption attached to it. There were at least three devices in the (single) bathroom that provided deodorizing spray on demand. (!!!) There was also an extra table for the dining room INSIDE the bathroom. I visited on the way out. For me, masking or band-aiding issues is a problem. If you cannot make repairs properly or have the dignity to care about it-- then I will have the dignity to stay away from dining here."], ["Steve M.", "Nice to get a little variety in the neighborhood without the drive. Came in for lunch and was seated quickly, though service was a little slow. There was a big party of very chatty ladies coming in at various times. Typical Greek fare so I had to get my gyros going.I was looking for something small in addition to meal so asked friendly person going by who suggested Baba ghanoush. I appreciate how he offered half order since portion was big so I tried.Pita bread was nice and warm and they made regular rounds to refill my tea glass. Prices very reasonable and nothing super expensive on menu (though I did not try any of the fish on the menu board). I really liked their side salad and the gryos meat was good. Will definitely return."], ["Stephen L.", "Walking up to caf\u00e9 medi can be a bit underwhelming with the appearance of a remodeled old house and a bland ramp. BUT...once inside it is cute and private environment that suits well to groups of friends or those out on dates. The food is delicious and the service is pretty good. The biggest thing for me is the food, delicious and inexpensive. Cooked to perfection, delicious, and makes me feel like I stepped out of Texas and into my big fat Greek wedding.

Unfortunately my husband wanted to give the place a shot.I would have left after entering the front door.It was not clean...the walls were dirty just as you enter.So we sit down..get soda in dirty/glass, like old food stuck to it ...get a dirty knife.Looking to my left is a broken chair. \u00a0Food was terrible, I did not eat, told the waiter it was too much...as my husband does not like complaints.My husband gave them a good shot as he even had desert.The one star was for the waiter that was friendly.

We've been frequenters of the Colleyville location for a couple years, but their new location is incredibly convenient for those in the Keller area. The food was fresh and tasty, and the service was friendly and fast. We went in at lunch time on a Saturday, and the restaurant was comfortably full, without a wait. Our group of 5 ordered from the lunch menu, and shared the Mousaka, Gyro, Kefta, and Shawerma. All were delicious, and reasonably portioned for around $10 each. We got complimentary desserts for our birthdays (and a couple more for the table, since we were not sharing!) and sampled the Lemoncello Mascarpone Mousse Cake, Bananas Foster Ice Cream Cake, Tiramisu, and Galaktoboureko, all of which were tasty and worth the calories. For those looking for a traditional Mediterranean dessert, the Galaktoboureko was delicious, but our entire party regretted not ordering the Bananas Foster Ice Cream Cake, which was sublime. The Lemoncello Marscarpone Mousse Cake was tart and flavorful, but would have been better paired with a romantic evening and an espresso."], ["Sarah S.", "Wow! I came in to have a quick lunch by myself. I ordered the souvlaki lamb with the fattoush salad, green beans, and babaghanoosh. The salad was the least favorite part of the meal. It was good but not great. Next time I will get the tabouli for sure!!! The green beans were the best I've ever had! Sorry mom! Babaghanoosh was excited served with warm soft pitas! The lamb was cooked to medium perfection!! The service was great too! Can't wait to come back!!!"], ["Dennis O.", "Food is out of this world. Prices are great. Service is top notch.

I had the gyro ($9) which filled me up for the rest of the day and made up for my saving my appetite for this dinner. Really good. Enormous. I cannot emphasize that enough. I honestly could have split it with my friend who had the Kafta (?) sandwich which she said was good too. Both of our meals came with fries. My plate had a good amount but my friend noticed her unequal and small amount of fries and told me she considered asking the waitress for more but luckily the waitress came out at the same time with two baskets explaining that the cook actually noticed but just wanted to get our food out first. So yay for both of us! After my gyro, I somehow mustered the space to order a scoop of their Turkish Coffee ice cream which I crave to this day. I'm not one for coffee but this one was the right texture and authentic. Lord have mercy, I'm so big on texture. And this ice cream was smooth and had coffee grinds in it which gave it this complimenting graininess. It was only $2 for the scoop but it was a really small scoop. The disproportionate scoop was amplified in the already tiny bowl it came in. Overall, my experience was super worth it. The food exceeded my expectations and I liked the environment and that general area in Fort Worth."], ["Jim S.", "Gyro and hummus were very average, hummus lacked much taste and pita seemed store bought, thin and Luke warm. Italian dishes on the other hand were outstanding, meatballs were awesome and sauce was perfect to my taste. Eggplant lasagna was very tasty. First time there and in the hood so we'll be back and focused on the Italian side of the menu. Side bar on seating there were only 2 sets of guests at the restaurant and we were seated at a small table as a couple, when food arrived waitress asked where to put it?? Just a pet peeve ...why sit us at a small take when there were 40 open and as a server..figure something's out like where to put the food."], ["monserrat a.", "As new residents of Fairmount this was a neighborhood staple that was on our bucket list. \u00a0When we walked into Chadra Mezza i cannot express how excited we were it smelled delightful, there was a great Friday night vibe. The bar was fully loaded w great spirits. Our bartender Thomas immediately \u00a0greeted us and made us feel completely welcome. \u00a0He was relaxed yet professional. Funny and suggested we go with the $18 buffet as first-timers there so we can try a little bit of everything.My personal favorites: hummus, so fresh and garlicky, babaganoush, the tilapia, juicy thick pieces of gyro, the pizza, lamb shank, the grape leaves were so aromatic and lastly the chicken.Honestly this will become our favorite go to spot now. We're sold! And we're not easyily sold but Chadra has impressed."], ["Vichy L.", "The Gyro was a great size and wonderfully flavored. I got full after eating only half of it!! -I mean... I ate the fries, and they were a little cold. But, I had to drive my plate ALL the way home. The plate had a good warm heat to it, but it wasn't too spicy. The garlic knots... man... those were delicious! The restaurant guy was really nice, and the next waitress that saw me also asked if I needed help, so overall. It was a good experience."], ["Amanda W.", "I'm vegan and went in because people recommended it to me and I've always enjoyed it. After I ordered the vegan friendly grape leaves I took a bite and there was actual meat in it! I told my server and he asked if I could still pay for it.

They shouldn't offer vegan options if they don't really care."], ["Ashley N.", "Chadra, I love you. Your delicious pizza with a crust unlike any other, your chicken shawarma, your perfect falafel. Please don't ever change.

Your wait staff is also extremely pleasant & it's always clean & nice smelling in there."], ["Krista R.", "Chadra, I am sorry that I have passed you up all of these years. I always have intentions of trying you and then I get distracted and I'm like \"OHH, Esperanza's!\" or \"ohh, let's eat at so and so on Magnolia!\". Not this time!We went for lunch. The garlic knots were so good and addicting. I had to be careful and not eat the whole basket! I got the Kabob Trio. I got the chicken, steak, and kafta with a side greek salad. The salad was good, drowned in Feta. The salad dressing was tasty. Some places the chicken and steak are dry, but not here. The chicken and steak were moist and full of flavor. They have a Mediterranean and seafood buffet on Friday and Saturday nights. I will be back to try that!!"], ["Austin S.", "Super nice chef who came and talked to us after I asked our waitress to compliment him on the perfect medium rare cook on the salmon. It was very fresh and delicious!"], ["Adam M.", "I have come across Chadra a few times. They have been at many outdoor music events around Fort Worth. They'll usually have a booth set up with a small selection to chose from. I always enjoyed what I got from them but I always suspected that there was more.Last Saturday I finally made it into their restaurant. It was surprisingly empty for a weekend. We were sat on the patio. It's completely covered so the shade was nice. There isn't much of a view since this place is sort of tucked away.After looking over the menu for a while and not knowing what to choose it was obvious that the buffet was the way to go. That turned out to be an excellent decision! Their buffet has a lot of the same items that are on the menu. So instead of trying to decide on one, I was able to try several. Yes, several.I'm not very big on buffets. Let's face it, most of them aren't that great. I also don't usually eat more than one plate (if it's piled right). Once I saw the buffet I knew immediately that wasn't going to be the case. I was careful to not overload on any one particular item.My favorites were the heavenly chicken and the lamb legs. The chicken was something different for me. I won't pretend to know what herbs or flavors I was tasting but I'm sure I haven't had anything like it before. The lamb legs came with the bone but the meat melted right off. Lamb tends to be a little on the chewy side so having it slow cooked was an interesting experience. I think that's how it should be done.I don't think they have the buffet everyday. I'll be back for it soon though."], ["Denise R.", "Buffet was great and there were so many choices. The heavenly chicken was delicious! I will definitely be visiting again.The staff was extremely helpful. The service was great. It was an overall wonderful experience."], ["Sarah H.", "Their meat is HALAL!

Only complaint is there is a parking problem around the restaurant."], ["Viralyn K.", "When I want to eat a lot but don't want to eat bad, I come here for lunch. $10 gets you an entire buffet. I am so in love with their salad bar. I love the fresh veggie options and the dip offerings right around the corner. I don't know the names of all of them, but they're so good. They will have meat and cooked veg options, the veg options don't make me feel too guilty. I usually end with fresh fruit. I always try a little bit of everything and it's always so good. I've been to other restaurants like this kind, but this one is by far my favorite. You can tell love has been prepared with the dishes put out. This is my new favorite spot."], ["Emmy F.", "LOVE this place! My coworkers and I work in the medical district and love to order delivery from this place but last night we decided to dine in when we found out they have a bar and hookah too. The service was excellent, the food delicious and flavorful, and all in a delightful atmosphere! We were happy to see Bradley as he had delivered food to us at work, and he's just as awesome as a waiter giving us everything we asked for and super pleasant. They have Mediterranean and Italian food, which I didn't think go together but it's nice to have both options in one place I suppose.Appetizers - I've had the Garlic Bread with mozzarella cheese, meatballs (3 large meatballs in marinara sauce), and hummus (served with 2 pita breads). All of them are delicious but probably my favorite is the garlic bread and cheese, sooooo yummy! Entrees come with garlic knots which are also good, but cheese makes everything better.Cocktails I tried were pomegranate Cosmo, watermelon mojito (which taste exactly as it's name) and something with midori and pineapple which was ridiculously sweet and my friend described as drinking the beach. I like my sweet martinis so the Pom Cosmo was perfect. They also have a decent beer selection and have a normal bar as well. Entrees - I ordered the heavenly chicken... Which is super awesome! Stuff chicken with cream cheese and penne pasta mixed in a creamy Alfredo sauce topped with spinach and chopped bacon. PERFECT. Love hands down. My friends ordered the grilled salmon, penne a la vodka, and kabob trio which they all thoroughly enjoyed too.Dessert - they offered us their pomegranate and Rose ice cream. Of course we were like, \"what does rose taste like?\" And it literally taste like the smell of a rose. I can't describe it any other way but it was good! So try it if you're curious, it's definitely worth it! Oh and the pom was good too. Hookah was pretty basic, they only had about 3 flavors but the owner was more than happy to bring flavors if we asked for next time. Lounge area/patio was nice and they had the big heater lamps to keep us warm and toasty. I also appreciated the random Indie rock station they had playing (they know what I like lol) The owner also approached our table and was extremely appreciative and super nice and friendly to us! I really love seeing that in family restaurants! Makes me feel much more welcomed and wanting to come back! For a Friday night we got a table for 8 at 8pm seated within 5min. So order delivery or make your way here. Either way you will enjoy it!"], ["Jason T.", "My wife and I with our two kids (2 yrs and 4 months old) went for the Saturday dinner buffet and it was good, but not great. They had a variety of food including lamb, crab legs, baked tilapia, 3 selection of hummus, pizza, heavenly chicken and salad. The quality was not the best of what we experienced in the past. \u00a0What they didn't have much were fruits (only grapes, pineapples, and strawberries), and desert. For a buffet, we think they should have more options in those categories.Unfortunately, they did not have any juice for our daughter. The price was $18 which was a bit steep for the amount of food they had. We thought we should have order from the menu. The atmosphere was nice with friendly service and they had a patio if you want to eat outside. We have not tried the lunch buffet yet. The lunch price might match the food they have much better than the dinner buffet."], ["Christie P.", "The lunch buffet at Chadra is AWESOME!!! Definitely go on Thursday when they serve the Heavenly Chicken, and bring lots of breath mints since those garlic knot rolls are absolutely amazing! The Monday night pizza and pasta buffet is also good, though it doesn't have as many choices as the lunch buffet. Their pizza crust is always fresh and chewy."], ["Melondy D.", "As a picker eater, I was nervous about trying this place. I had the lunch buffet with my husband and fell in love.

I'll see you guys next week!"], ["Meredith R.", "After craving eggplant and reading the yelp reviews, I decided to try the lunch buffet.

There were plenty of meat dishes and several pizzas to try as well (but \u00a0I'm a vegetarian and have been staying away from cheese lately so I didn't try). Everything I has was extremely fresh. But the baba ghanoush needed something. That was my only tiny complaint.Besides everything on the buffet looking fresh and appetizing, it's also labeled so you don't have to guess. The service was composed of hipsters but they were friendly and attentive. The drinks and pita bread basket were refilled often.I'll be back next time in town. Maybe for dinner.

They lost a customer before we could even try their food."], ["Loren B.", "We visited the Greek Caf\u00e9 for the first time with a friend from out of town based on Yelp reviews, and found it to be a bit of a letdown. The food was fresh and the service extremely friendly and helpful. The atmosphere was not unexpected for fast food, nothing bad about it, but nothing particularly special either. I ordered a Gyro sandwich combo, which includes fries, but after 3 PM not a drink (?). Nothing about what I ordered seemed \"prepared\" except the gyro meat, which I'm pretty sure is provided by a vendor in most places anyway. The onions and tomatoes in the sandwich were raw and cold. The Tzatziki \"sauce\" was so much like sour cream it had to be the result of a spice mix stirred into store-bought sour cream. We ordered ranch on the side with our fries and the Ranch tasted exactly like Hidden Valley Ranch poured from the bottle. The pitas were dense and puffy, but also tasted store-bought. The dolmas were quite good, but came with a cup of Tzatziki that is so thick it has to be spread on the food. We also ordered a bowl of melon rice soup, again good but nothing special. I am admittedly a Greek food lover and come into any Greek place with a high expectation for enjoyment. The Greek Caf\u00e9 probably works on a fast food level, but for me the flavors and the food just didn't blend well. It was like an American fast food version of a great cuisine. Prices were reasonable. And I can't say enough about how genuinely nice the staff was. They just need to work in the food a bit."], ["Jake C.", "Got 2 gyros, dolmas, and rice all for $20.

Nice staff and cool little restaurant."], ["Una B.", "Totally casual, order at the counter place. There's a few booths and a couple of stools at a counter in the back. Food was tasty, but stick with the greek items. For whatever reason, I saw a sign that said they offered hot wings, and I ordered them in a moment of unclear thought. They were ok, but nothing special. What was I doing ordering hot wings at a greek place anyway? I'm unsure, don't be like me. Pita was soft, veggies were crisp, and the tzatziki was cool and thick.

My expectations were a nice restaurant with the charm of the old house Celaborelle was in. Unfortunately, it doesn't translate.So first, let's touch on a couple of ways the Celaborelle and Hedary's are the same.I thought the old house had ventilation problems. Which it did. It was always smokey like they just put out a fire. Somehow they managed for this to make the restaurant the same way. They left the front door open to air the place out. But after an hour there, it wasn't any better.Secondly, service was awful at the house. There was always only a single server. You filled out your own order sometimes even. The restaurant still doesn't have enough help to scale. We had one server who was overwhelmed. We waited a really long time without being checked on. Our food also took an extra long time to come out. There's a lack of overall professionalism as well. Again, in the house it was looked at as a quirky charm. Here, it's just poor service.Third, it's still a BYOB. Interesting enough, they now serve wine as well. There's a $2 a glass charge though.As for the food... I'll just leave it at the star rating of \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" My wife and I split a meat combination beef kabob plate. The beef kabobs were fine. The pork sausage (mqaniq), beef sausage (sujuk), and meat loaf (kibbi) were dry. I didn't care for them. The Kafta was relatively good. All the vegetables were scorched black.

It was busy for a 1:00p visit on Friday- we had a tough time finding a table that seated 3 and ended up at a larger \"communal\" spot where 10-12 people could share a spot. I ordered the egg salad sandwich with the chicken and orzo soup. The egg salad was sort of blended, not chunky, and I liked that. It had a great flavor and the serving size was perfect. The toasted whole grain bread was excellent. The soup was more warm than hot but had a good flavor as well. My wife ordered the chicken salad sandwich, and a greek salad. The salad looked amazing- a huge portion with fresh veggies. I was wishing I had ordered the salad too. There's a decent kids menu for the little ones, and the prices were just right.

The rolls were very good, however I didn't really like the salsa they came with. I don't want to dip a Greek-tasting roll into a Mexican-tasting dip. You know? They didn't mesh. It would have been awesome to have some kind of sun-dried tomato dip. I tasted my sister's hummus, pita, and quinoa salad and it was all good. Then I grabbed a 99c bag of pita chips to take home.

The food was mediocre. I got a sandwich of some sort, which was overloaded with meat and had very few vegetables. My friend was also not wow-ed by her food. Maybe their breakfast/brunch menu is significantly better than their lunch menu? Finally, the service was lackluster.

The environment inside needs a lot of help. It's not very inviting so I chose to walk home. I thought my food would be pretty good because sometimes when places don't look good on the outside or inside the food is awesome because the place spends time on the food and not the atmosphere. Sadly, though, the food was not that great. Over the last year as I drove by it I did notice that they have been making improvements to the outside area. Maybe now that they are carrying about the outside they will start to care more about their food. I would give it another try soon if I still lived in Ft.

Loads of other options including the ever popular gyros, falafels, and yummy hummus. Make sure to bring cash, they don't accept credit cards. If you want to imbibe, bring your own. Pretty sure there is no corkage fee. And they have live music (Jazz of course!) at night. You may not have the best service, but you will get served some authentically wonderful food."], ["Scott C.", "You may think I didn't like Jazz Cafe.....As I approached the restaurant it appeared to me as if they weren't open. As in, no longer in business. The sign in front was broken out and the neon \"OPEN\" sign facing the street was not on. It appeared dark inside. I turned down the side street with the intention of turning around but found the parking lot to be full meaning there were 8 cars. Open maybe? Also, I found another neon sign operating with the colorful and welcoming \"OPEN\" on display.From the parking lot one approaches onto the patio. A somewhat charming and inviting area, or it could be given the odd assortment of industrial equipment, vacum cleaners, hardware and tools scattered about. An area on the west end of the patio looked like it could be a great stage for a jazz combo on some pleasant evening but on my visit was doubling as a storage area of sorts. I stumbled around trying to find a door and a mysteriously hidden voice called out to me \"Can I help you?\" I replied \"I can't see you\" (The reader should know I'm hearing impaired and can't discern the direction of sound) After spinning in circles, I finally located the source of the voice partially hidden behind a wall and the assortment of equipment mentioned above. I was directed to the front door. I then proceeded to the Montgomery street side of the building but another voice pointed out my continued misdirection and extended his arm and finger toward the REAL front door. \"Front\" being a misnomer since it is on the SIDE of the building. Finally becoming oriented to enter the building, no one on the inside greeted me. I scanned the dining room and some quick math deduced that there were more cars in the parking lot than patrons but I let go of the mystery. Since I'm a big fan of patio seating and the aforementioned patio did not look as though they were serving out there, I picked a table next to a window overlooking the patio, the next best thing I suppose. I sat, sat and sat. Please note all other reviews of Jazz Cafe that I read indicate the service is less than desirable. Duly noted. Eventually, a fair natured fellow with a long gray pony tail appeared and dropped 2 menus on my table. 1 for lunch and 1 for breakfast. I looked at neither. I think you can still find an article from the Star Telegram titled \"Eat this and die happy\" A list of about 45 things in the metroplex on one should put on their gastronomic bucket list. This is a great list. On the list is the SOB Eggs at Jazz Cafe. I hope I don't need a bucket list anytime soon but I did order the SOB Eggs. Being a sneaky type and liking to order off the menu when I can, I also ordered Greek coffee like I knew what I was doing. I suppose it's also good to note that Jazz Cafe is a Greek restaurant when not doubling as a brunch locale or a storage facility.Again, I waited. Soon an attractive and curvaceous dark haired beauty with an attitude pitched an espresso sized cup on my table and without a word walked away. Pony tail man appeared with water and told me my coffee would be \"just a minute\". Good thing I brought a book. The arrival of my eggs coincided with the opening of chapter 2. Again, I was told my coffee would be \"just a minute\". The food: There are no eggs and black beans on the planet worth $10 unless they're served with sliced truffles & beluga caviar. SOB eggs are chiliquiles. Wait.... my coffee just arrived. \u00a0The eggs are served covering half the plate with runny black beans covering the other half and some pretty good pico de gallo wedged in. Since theres no room left, 3 tortillas are folded and placed on top. It was good, end food review. For those of you who don't know.... forget Starbucks for espresso. Find a greek or turkish or some mediterranean place of your liking and get your mainline caffeine fix there. They boil coffee, that's right, boil coffee in a small open pot then add sugar because no one can drink sludge unless it's sweet. The grounds and everything are left in the pot which is brought to your table. Thats why Ms. Hot Smarmy pitched me the tiny cup. You pour until its too gritty for you then stop. For me this equated to about 3 tiny cups. All good things must come to an and the closer the time came to leave, the better the service was. Odd, since not once did I think they wanted me to stay. Mr. Pony Tail now wanted to refill my water, get me more coffee, serve me another entree and clean off the patio so I could sit outside. OK, just kidding about everything except the water. So I went to pay. At the register he offered a can of coffee for purchase. I said before I could buy coffee I needed one of those nifty boiler pot thingys. At this time another gentleman with nicely coiffed hair and smart looking clothes who had been on his cell phone all morning interjected. (I think he was the owner) He told me about Halal market in Arlington where I could purchase said cookware. He told me what a fantastic place it was. But thats another review."], ["M.

My boyfriend and I ate til we were stuffed, and still took home 3 boxes.My recommendations: \u00a0Mtabbal (Baba Ganoush), falafels (HUGE plate for only $3.95), and the beef shish kabob plate. It is only $10.95 for a 16oz portion of the beef shish kabob plate, and it comes with rice and grilled vegetables. This will feed two people - the portion is THAT big. This probably would've costed double what it did at any other Mediterranean restaurant.I've also had the hummus, which was just ok- nothing special. I also don't recommend the chicken schwarma plate. The first couple bites were really delicious, until we realized how oily it was. There was enough oil to fill a whole separate plate. Wasn't sure if it was just cooked poorly that day, but we gave it another chance on a separate occasion and it was just as oily.Tip: \u00a0don't come with a big group (no more than 4 people). There is just one guy cooking and his wife helping out - you will wait FOREVER for your food. My boyfriend and I were the only ones there at the time, and it took 30 minutes for our food to come out.

Walk up and order by writing your items from a whiteboard menu and submitting to the kitchen window.Now for the extended! It is sooo worth the wait! He makes his own bread, I think it is pita, it's incredible! We ordered hummus, \"small\" falafel app (which came with 8 large ones) kafta plate, chicken swarma, medium cucumber tomato salad.

You write out what you want on the paper provided and then turn it in to the chef for approval! DO NOT TURN AWAY until you have received approval! You will sit and the food is brought to you.Then prepare to wait 30 mins to an hour! The kafta kebabs were cooked to perfection! Swarma was seasoned well and had beautiful big chunky vegetables! Hummus was a hearty consistency! You could turn that plate over and it wasn't gonna budge! Great flavor and tasty pickles as a garnish! THE PITA (or what I think is pita) IS MADE FRESH TO ORDER ON THE PREMISESThe \"medium\" cucumber and tomato salad we ordered was two full dinner plates! The dressing was so flavorful!

It could do with a face lift and probably a good scrub down, it is not dirty, it is just old! But is truly a rare gem!"], ["Craig J.", "Before I start, I absolutely love Celaborelle. This is probably the longest review I've ever posted. I tried to add as much detail as I could. Keep in mind when reading about the service, that there are about 3 people who work here. One is the waitress who disappears for a while because she goes back to the kitchen to help cook. The other two are in the kitchen as well. I'm fairly sure that they are a family. Where to start? I guess I'll start with the obvious? The service. Almost non-existent. When we walked in, there we no directions of what to do or how to order other than \"Please order from the window\". We were confused and were literally standing there waiting in what looking like a back kitchen at a restaurant for about 10-15 minutes. Finally I said aloud \"WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?!\". One of the regulars laughed at us and finally told us the deal here: You have to write down what you want an order slip and give it to the chef in back through the little hole or \"window\" in the wall. The menu is a big white board with barely legible writing. Our brave friend wrote down her order first. The chef looks at the ticket and says pretty much \"What is this? This doesn't come with this order. Go back and try again.\" So after about a combined 25 minutes of waiting around, writing down orders and re-writing orders, our food was in and under way...Now that that's out of the way...I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!...I think... The interior: I wouldn't go so far as calling it a hole-in-the-wall as much as its very rustic. This is a restaurant built inside of an old, i'm guessing turn of the century, house. The exterior is in dire need of a good white washing but the interior is all hardwood floors and pillars. There are six tables. There is also little evidence of a working A/C unit. The ambiance: This is a place that is truly \"regular'\" friendly. Your 1st visit here will be a little off putting. After you've got the routine down and know what to expect, this place is your little hidden gem! It's BYOB or BYOW...I think it might even be BYOL! All the regulars that are there seem willing to help you out. We were told by a few regulars at the next table that the food takes about an hour to come out after you order. We all laughed but they were serious. They then went on to offer some of their ridiculously huge wood fire pizza to our table! The regulars here are so nice! That brings me to my next point: The food: Sweet \"oh face\" baby Jesus! The portion sizes are out of this world. And CHEAP!!. It did take a while to get the food but it was well worth the wait. I got the 16 oz Lamb schwarma plate. That is a lie. It weighed a few pounds. When I was done, I had enough left over for 3 whole meals! My roomate ordered the same. It had a nice flavor but the meat was a little tough for my taste. HIs wifey ordered chicken kabob 8 oz. It was again, a lie. She's got at least two servings sitting in the fridge. The chicken had a nice char, was cooked to perfection, juicy and you could actually taste the individual lebanese/Meditarranean seasonings. Served over a bed of very complimenting saffron rice. My roommates sister and her mate were smart...they split a 16 oz steak kabob; Perfect to share for 4 people (I'm dead serious). All of the plates were good but probably my favorite plate was the steak kabobs. Great savory flavor with a nice kick at the end. By this point I think I've made it clear that you get a lot of food. There were 5 of use. We left with 8 full boxes of left overs...I'll be fed for a week! Bottom line: I understand all of the negative comments I've seen in other reviews. They are for the most part all true. You have to look at this place from a different perspective though. I think of it as visiting a relative's house who is ridiculously good at making Lebanese food. You serve yourself in most ways. You seat yourself, Want water or something else to drink? You have to go to into the kitchen, grab a glass and shovel your ice and get it yourself. You need a togo box? Go back into the kitchen and get it yourself. I actually like it this way! Also considering how cheap the food is, I'd rather serve myself and let the staff keep making great food."], ["Ashley L.", "After much raving by friends and strangers, I came here for dinner on a Tue night with 2 friends. Ordered one of the specials - swai fish - which came with zucchini, yellow squash, tomato, onion, carrots and spiced yellow rice. Granted, the entree was 4 times as large as at normal restaurants, I was moderately disappointed at the taste. I felt like salt pretty much drowned out any multi-dimensional taste to the dish. On the plus side, you had leftovers to last you for days. I am not however going to judge this place by a single dish - I'd be open to trying the beans and rish dish, vegetarian entree, hummus and pita, falafel, Lebanese salad. I saw a couple share what looked like 4 crowns of broccoli. It was ridiculous. \u00a0And the prices are dirt cheap - it's no wonder it's hard to get return!I do like the owner - he doesn't judge you for being a newb at ordering ethnic/Lebanese/Phoenician food.

Well for the past few months falafel has been stuck there. Not sure why, because I probably haven't eaten it in well over 20 years. So it's an odd thing to crave it. Lately I've been trying newer and healthier items. Vegetarian is foreign to me. I like meat. I love a great burger. So to try veggie options is not my norm.During one of my random Yelp searches a month ago I discovered this place, but I didn't visit until today. I had taken a look at the menu online and saw kabobs, hummus, labni and of course falafel. In my limited experience with falafel, it has always been chickpeas. Their version is chickpeas and fava beans. As the reviews before have stated, HUGE PORTIONS, CHEAP PRICES. I orderd some labni (yogurt that is dried to a cream cheese consistency), a falafel sandwich and a piece of baclava. I didn't even pay eight dollars for everything. I got it to go and the food came in two bags.............. wow.The labni was exactly what I thought it would be and it came with a fresh piece of pita. It reminded me of plain greek yogurt but a whole lot thicker. It was really good. They have another version that they serve that has garlic and mint mixed in called labni matoon. The falafel sandwich ($3.50) is gigantic. A large pita with several warm and soft falafel balls with romaine lettuce, tomatoes and another pickled vegetable and was served with tarator (a sauce made from sesame paste, garlic, lemon juice and parsley sauce) The sauce is tart and tangy and ties it all together. I did like the falafel itself. Moist and crisp and really good. I also needed a little sweet to complete this meal and had a piece of baclava. Layers of phylo and macadamia nuts with a rose and orange blossom syrup. Sweet, salty and just a perfect way to finish off a really good meal.With such options as manaeesh, ftayir, shawarma and of course kabobs there are many, many new foods to try and I will return, with others because I can't eat all of this myself.Enjoy."], ["Amanda H.", "The previous reviewer explained the service very well. \u00a0You have to roll with it and not be in a hurry. \u00a0That said, the prices can't be beat, and the food is extremely fresh. \u00a0My faves are the tabouleh, hummus with pita, and the falafel. \u00a0The baklava is to die for. \u00a0The prices can't be beat! \u00a0A falafel platter comes with a dozen falafel, rice, lentils, and red beans for $7 or $8, and it will feed three people (or two with big appetites). \u00a0If you love Middle Eastern food, Celaborelle is not to be missed."], ["Mad I.", "Parking is very limited have to drive around looking for parking heard good things about this place too bad I didn't get to find adequate parking"], ["Ravi C.", "I have no idea how I missed this place, but I'm glad I found it.

There isn't much else around the predominantly residential streets. Inside it's very clean. The original brown patinated interior was very charming and we were greeted to sit and be shown the menu. As far as I could tell there was a single hostess/server and the cook. Between the four of us we ordered 2 falafel and 2 veggie plates. We ordered starters of hummus and pita(awesome), and tabouleh. My veggie plate included a bowl of lentil grape leaf soup and a small serving of babaganouj. Delicious! Stop! Enough food. \"I'm good!\" My main plate arrives and it's huge. Black beans, lentils and rice, and a sort of hot squash dish called Kibbi, and five 3 inch falafel. Turned out the falafel plate was the same arrangement except substituting the soup and Baba with five more falafel! An absolutely ridiculous amount of food for all of us, we turned away two of the falafel dishes out of fear. Cost? Guess what...$5.95 for all my entree. I'm guessing it was about $32 for all of us to eat and drink. Do yourself a favor and go out of your way if you must to enjoy what this restaurant has to offer. Anybody under 5 stars on this one is silly and the asshole posting a 1 star should be dropped and drowned in a vat of babaganouj.

I got to pick the place, and I have to say that even though my friends thought I was crazy when we pulled up in front if what looked like a house that belonged on a scary movie set, we had the best time!
