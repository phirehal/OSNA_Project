The food is authentic, plentiful, and delicious. Each entree comes with either a soup or salad, the lemon rice soup is my favorite.

My husband and I had a craving for Greek food, did a little research and came up with the idea to try this little gem. The space is cozy enough with a cute little enclosed patio for nicer days. We ordered the arayes for an appetizer. We had never tried this dish but the description sounded delicious and it was! We both had soup with our entree. Lemon rice for me and mushroom for him. Again, delicious! By the time our main course came we were pretty stuffed with not only the appetizer and soup but the copious amount of pita we had already consumed! Wish we would have thought to ask for a little olive oil to dip the pita in but it was very good anyhow. The gyro plate was heaped with a very generous amount of meat, a little pile of fluffy rice and some not-so-appetizing looking green beans. The meat was tender and flavorful and the rice so light and fluffy. I didn't touch the green beans because they really looked like a can had just been dumped on the plate (very weird). We had so much food we ended up taking 2 boxes home with more pita for a complete second meal! All in all the prices were very fair for the amount and quality of food (sans the green beans - my only complaint). Super delicious. I totally recommend for anyone craving some Mediterranean cuisine!"], ["Kimmy B.", "Wanted to try Mediterranean food here in the area, And I'm originally from Houston.

It's a must have and must take some to-go.For entree we had the lamb shank and a chicken and beef shawarma combo and beef souvlaki. Lamb shank was very tender and meat came right off the bone. The combo we had with the beef souvlaki was great also. Especially with the sauces it came with. Am the entrees were delicious. Service was fast and great!

This spot is authentic and even though my water sat empty for 10+ minutes I almost didn't care.

The chicken schwarma was well (and correctly) seasoned with plenty of cloves and garlic added, and once paired with pickled radish (included) it was delicious.

I ordered the Lamb Shawarma: fabulously seasoned lamb stir-fried with onions, peppers, and tomatoes, served with a bed of delicately spiced rice. It was absolutely delightful (a little pricey at $17), and it paired gorgeously with the Lebanese Reserve wine I ordered (which I can't find listed on Chadra's online menu, otherwise I'd give you the name!). I had two glasses at $8 each because this wine was robust, drinkable, and had a lovely heat to it.

We went in a group to celebrate my birthday, and seeing I have been on a bit of a BBQ bender, hitting up Chadra was a nice change of pace. Stepping in, I can tell why this place is such a favorite. A large patio, with a lively, soothing atmosphere. Not to mention, they have a buffet special for each day(even on weekends), so it is hard not to find something you like. Although the buffet looked quite tempting (seafood and lamb), the line was constantly full, so I decided to go with a la carte.My usual strategy with any new place I try is to find a dish that allows me to try a bit of everything, so naturally I was predestined to order the Kabob Trio. You get four choices of meats: Chicken, Lamb, Steak, and Kafta. I chose the latter three, as I usually stay away from chicken kabobs, since so many places dry them out. Despite the $19 price tag, the food did not disappoint. Each one of the kabob skewers had great flavor, due to the nice seasoning and char flavor from the open fire pit you can see when you look into the kitchen. Steak kabobs at most Middle Eastern restaurants often suffer the same fate as the chicken, they tend to dry out. Not at Chadra, and the lamb and Kafta were great too. Kafta is quickly becoming my favorite dish to order at Lebanese restaurants, you just have to love the flavor derived from the herbs and spices mixed in with the grilled ground beef and lamb.My brother mentioned I needed to order the falafel. They came out piping hot and are the best I have had in Fort Worth thus far. I can also confirm the garlic knots are evil in their addictiveness. You will feel ashamed for your lack of self control after you eat 5 of them. Chadra also has a nice selection of drinks and cocktails. All my friends liked what they ordered and we went through several rounds as well. I kept it simple and ordered a few rounds of Arak, I picked up a love for Ouzo and Raki through my Mediterranean travels so I tend to order them or their variants at any chance I get. So Chadra definitely lives up to its billing. Great food, good sized portions, and something for everyone. My next plan is to hit up one of their buffets too."], ["Chris P.", "Know what I love?

We ended up ordering four huge platters, Turkish coffee AND a healthy (and incredible) dose of baklava for a grand total of under $30. Leaving with four overflowing to-go boxes..."], ["Ramesh C.", "2nd time here after almost a year.. Taste and quantity remains the same..

You will be taking food home, portions are cray!! The exterior is lTexas chainsaw massacre meets east Lancaster...but keep an open mind! Once your inside, you forget about the zombies cruising up and down Hemphill. Byob, always a plus! Prepare to wait a bit for the food..just know that going in! Get here NOW"], ["Chris P.", "About a year and a half ago, someone told me about this place. \u00a0So I tried to go one night. And they were closed. So a month later, I tried again on a weekend. Closed. Then I tried again, during lunch one day. Closed. So I gave up.Bottom line is that this place isn't open very often. If you would have asked me 3 months ago, I would have bet money that they were closed for good. \u00a0I think they just open their doors for short stretches when they feel like it. So last weekend, as I was trying to make a reservation at another place on my phone, I saw Celaborelle pop up. Hmmh. Surely that's a mistake, right? So I called them, and they actually were open. And it was amazing. Seriously. It's in an old house that looks kind of like a haunted house. Which is clue number one that it's going to be good. Those shady sketchy hideaway places are what really getting to know the cultural gems of a city is all about, right?My girlfriend and I got the Beef and Chicken Shawarma, with a side salad and Lentil soup. We also ordered hummus and tabouleh, but apparently the lady either didn't hear us or knew we wouldn't be able to finish it, so we never got it (and she would have been right btw, we were really surprised by the amount of food we got). The salad was made of really high quality stuff and the soup was really good as well, all for around $25.And I'm sitting here eating the leftovers, and I swear they got better in my fridge.So if you can find it, and it's open, do it. They mentioned that they're not going to be doing the buffet for a while since they don't have many customers (and I'm not an expert or anything, but step number one might be opening your doors more than once every year and a half), but it's a great, great, casual dinner spot. The service while we were there consisted of just one person, sweet as she may have been, so it might run a little long for lunch if you have somewhere to be.Still, go there."], ["Lindsey A.", "Celaborelle is the best under $10/plate restaurant in Fort Worth, hands down. The owner, also our server & probably our cook, writes the menu by hand and displays it to each table as customers walk in. The menu changes daily according to what he has available. This tells me the restaurant is evolving and making daily changes to ensure the food is delicious and fresh. STEP #1 IN BEING A GREAT RESTAURANT. \u00a0the food does not reflect the prices. i swear its too great to be so inexpensive. the portions are so large they are just waiting to be taken home in a box. heaven forbid...the soup is .75 a bowl. As in, UNDER one dollar. It is incredible One bowl of lentil & spinach soup with an order of hummus (plenty for lunch) comes to a total of $3.75. Go go go support this great local charm. Check out the weird house its in too!"], ["Jennifer W.", "It's Hedary's without the $$$$- but even better, the taste the serving size-Joseph is a king! \u00a0I'd work here for free as long as he fed me and I might just have to offer him some help since the staff is always family...wonder if he would adopt me? If they are open, go, wait if you have to -even outside- but don't come too late or they may run out \u00a0of your favorites.

We have had much better hummus and felafel, but this was pretty good.The vegetarian plate had these amazing beans with it.....one was lentils and the other was maybe pintos....but they taste amazing. \u00a0I just had leftovers for lunch. \u00a0Yum. \u00a0And I will be eating the leftovers for the next three days, at least."], ["Chadd S.", "hidden gem. \u00a0 This place has been recommended for years. \u00a0 Finally I had the pleasure of experiencing what is Celaborelle. \u00a0 It has such a strange old house exterior which leads to a surprisingly welcoming interior. \u00a0The service is a little awkward until the other patrons give you some insight. \u00a0 You will write your own order on old Carriage House order forms (recycling in action. \u00a0Love it) then pass them through the window to the kitchen. \u00a0 The chef will assess your order and nod if all is approved. \u00a0 Find your own table and enjoy the wait. \u00a0 \u00a0Food \u00a0will continue to flow until you can't imagine what else will follow. \u00a0 The falafel is the absolute best I have ever put in my mouth. \u00a0 I highly recommend the chicken livers (add a little lemon and it takes you back to the Hedary chicken livers). \u00a0 Well done beyond my expectations. \u00a0 An incredible dinner experience! \u00a0 \u00a0The most shocking part of our evening was the amount of food that was served and our tab was phenomenal. \u00a0 \u00a0A must go! \u00a0Add it to your list!"], ["Taylor S.", "A hidden jewel. One of my favorite places."], ["Jason M.", "For the money, I can guarantee you won't find more tasty or well prepared food on this planet! The ablama and the sheik al meish is awesome.

It's in a pretty run down area on the outskirts of Downtown Fort Worth. Family owned since 1908, the restaurant is in a beautiful, large but similarly neglected old home and walking up the steps to the front door comes not without some general confusion. There isn't much else around the predominantly residential streets. Inside it's very clean. The original brown patinated interior was very charming and we were greeted to sit and be shown the menu. As far as I could tell there was a single hostess/server and the cook. Between the four of us we ordered 2 falafel and 2 veggie plates. We ordered starters of hummus and pita(awesome), and tabouleh. My veggie plate included a bowl of lentil grape leaf soup and a small serving of babaganouj. Delicious! Stop! Enough food. \"I'm good!\" My main plate arrives and it's huge. Black beans, lentils and rice, and a sort of hot squash dish called Kibbi, and five 3 inch falafel. Turned out the falafel plate was the same arrangement except substituting the soup and Baba with five more falafel! An absolutely ridiculous amount of food for all of us, we turned away two of the falafel dishes out of fear. Cost? Guess what...$5.95 for all my entree. I'm guessing it was about $32 for all of us to eat and drink. Do yourself a favor and go out of your way if you must to enjoy what this restaurant has to offer. Anybody under 5 stars on this one is silly and the asshole posting a 1 star should be dropped and drowned in a vat of babaganouj. On second thought, not a bad way to go if it's made from Celaborelle!"], ["Brian L.", "Just wow, portions are epic. \u00a0Thier medium salad would easily be 5 portions at a normal place. \u00a0Worth coming out to ft worth for."], ["Josh O.", "This place is a hidden gem. You'll drive up and question whether or not you came to the right place but do not judge this book by its cover. This is the best Mediterranean food in Fort Worth and it is very underpriced. A few things- -The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. They aren't very talkative but the service is great. -The food is phenomenal. I would recommend the Beef Shwarma and you HAVE to get the pita bread and hummus. The meals are so cheap, especially for what you get. -It is BYOB so it can make a great and affordable date place. Just make sure she is ok with the \"run-down\" feel of the place. **-Do not come here if you are in a rush. The speed of service is hit or miss. They have a small staff and seem to make everything from scratch. There will be a wait for your food but it is worth it. Overall, this is worth the visit if you can deal with the neighborhood and the run-down feel of the place. It's slow service but amazing food."], ["Heather M.", "I went here with my best friends for my birthday dinner. I got to pick the place, and I have to say that even though my friends thought I was crazy when we pulled up in front if what looked like a house that belonged on a scary movie set, we had the best time! The inside is quite cute and date worthy (perhaps blindfold your date until you get them in the door - or point them here to all the glowing reviews so that they will be less put off by the exterior and neighborhood). It's also obviously great for a group of friends! I found this little gem by searching for BYOB places in Fort Worth (they provide wine glasses and don't have a corking fee). \u00a0The amount of food for the price is incredible. \u00a0You may not want to go as crazy as we did, ordering several appetizers and four meals among the four of us - we ended up with 10 to-go boxes and enough food to feed us for lunch and dinner the rest of the week.If I could only tell you to order two things, it would be the hummus and pita plate (killer pita!) and the falafel. \u00a0I LOVE their falafel! \u00a0They make the best falafel I've ever had. \u00a0Not only does it have great flavor, but the texture is great (not super dry and crumbly - here's looking at you Terra Grill). \u00a0We had a very picky, non-adventurous, non-veggie eater with us, and he devoured the falafel right along with the rest of us (quite a testament to the awesomeness of this falafel). \u00a0I also need to note that the aforementioned meat-eater with us ordered the brisket plate, and not only was it great smokey meat (with two HUGE sides!), it was only $4.99!!!! \u00a0RIDICULOUS! So grab a bottle of wine and your open-minded friends and prepare for a feast of copious yummy goodness! \u00a0You better run, not walk, or I may beat you there.Notes: \u00a0there's no corking fee, check their website for when they are open (doesn't hurt to call either so that you aren't disappointed), try to park in front of the house or in front of the house next door (at last resort, there is parking behind the house next door), share plates or have space in your fridge for leftovers, and get the hummus/pita and the falafel!!!!!"], ["Kim N.", "Due to the fact that this place has been having a lot of reviews and visitors within the last year, the owners decided to raise up the prices on their entrees. The last time I came here, I had placed an order through phone just because it takes less time to wait for your meal as if you were to be waiting inside the restaurant. The guy told me that it was an hour wait. I was completely shocked! Because all of the times that I have visited, it was never busy. When I received me lamb shawarma, the vegetables were burnt and were impossible to eat. Even though the menu says \"char grilled vegetables\". I also didn't receive any complimentary pita bread. There is only one server, he try's his best to help every customer. He is also the chefs son. One time, they were both arguing and yelling in the back kitchen.

We went there for lunch... we started off with the hummus plate and the feta plate. Of course -- we had starters because we just didn't know the amount of food that was coming. The feta was amazing -- not as strong as most fetas which made you want to eat blocks and blocks of it! The hummus was great with the huge discs of fresh, hot pita they also bring to you. I ordered the chicken and rice special that was $4.95 and my friend ordered the falafel sandwich that was $3.95. After over stuffing ourselves with feta, hummus and pita -- our dishes came out. HOLY MOLY. My chicken and rice was the size of a pig trough. It was enough to feed 4 people! My friend's falafel sandwich was... a circular pita the size of a medium pizza, topped with 8 gigantic falafels and a sprinkling of lettuce and tomatoes. We literally just looked at each other with our eyes and mouths wide open. To top it all off, the chicken and rice was delicious -- full of spices and juicy shreds of chicken and the falafels were so flavorful and moist!
