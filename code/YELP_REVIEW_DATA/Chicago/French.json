I had the salmon tartar and just about died; it was so good! I then enjoyed the best homemade meatball I've ever had! It came with their house made fettuccine and tasty sauce. My server/bartender, Jay overheard I was moving, and even brought out a sparkling scoop of vanilla ice-cream and hot fudge to celebrate. AWESOME service!"], ["Anna K.", "Came here for a drink before dinner in river north. Sat at the bar and loved it, can't wait to come back again for dinner! The decor is dark but makes you feel like you've traveled back in time and are at a supper club. Removed a star since it's slightly overpriced, but it's river north. My boyfriend said it was the best dirty martini he's ever had-- and my cocktail was pretty delicious too. The bartender was friendly and gave good recommendations, I loved how she tried every drink she made to make sure it was good."], ["Tracy H.", "I know, I know! I keep reviewing here, I don't care. I will always update this review. Had a truly wonderful b-day dinner here Friday night. Service was superb. I had one of the best meals everrrr. Got the petite filet mignon and honestly, I'm pretty sure it was the best filet I've ever had. Got an excellent sazerac (you don't see this New Orleans cocktail many places, and this one was excellently crafted). My guy got the double-cut pork chop - to die for. What else ... oh, right! The chocolate pie. You must do this, I promise you won't regret. Only drawback? This place will set you back - a lot. So just know that going in. But for a special occasion, it's worth it, and Bavette's is officially my favorite Chicago restaurant."], ["Mouse C.", "A perfect rating indeed! Bavette's NEVER disappoints. Say it with me now..N-E-V-E-R \u00a0disappoints. Ambiance is old fashioned steak house meets the contemporary coolness of all Brendan Sodikoff's establishments. Bavette's encompasses all that a steak house should. The man and I came here last Monday for a much longed-for second meal here. We were seated upstairs this time and just a tip, if you can, request to sit in the \"parlor\". It's super sexy and you won't regret it. Moving on...food/drinks:The mans went with his usual - old fashioned. Very yummy and had great, smooth flavor. Also, they give you just about any option for your old fashioned to include bourbon, scotch, whiskey, cognac. I mean, it's legit. I was interested in a robust, yet not punch you in the face red. I opted for the Sangiovese and it proved to be perfect for what I was feeling. Appetizer - garlic shrimp de jongheMains - short rib stroganoff and the bone in dry aged rib eyeSides - elote style corn and roasted tomatoesDessert - lemon meringue pieI have not one bad thing to say about any of it. I can't, it would be a sin. If you are getting steak, don't even think about looking further than the rib eye. Stroganoff melted in your mouth and fell apart just by looking at it. Corn was so creamy I couldn't even handle it. The pie was hilarious, it was 15 feet high with the whip cream. In short, anything and everything you get at Bavette's will knock your socks off. Love love love...one of my fav spots in Chicago!!!"], ["Dalia M.", "Sat downstairs - I made reservations almost two months ahead and it's all I could get for our Friday night dinner!We were seated right away. Had the salmon with toast, steak, and wine. We all liked our food. It reminds me of the restaurant group - gilt, Maude's. It was pretty pricey but good.Our server was a bit odd / intense but other than that we had a good evening.

I think I maybe have outlandish expectations when it comes to steakhouses and I'll not dare say this place didn't live up to the hype. We were very fortunate to know someone who was able to get us an early reservation for which we were thankful.Pro tip: Take the kitchen staff a bottle of JamesonWe noshed on goat cheese and bacon while we picked our main courses over Chardonnay. Both were great with the bacon being of a thick, peppery cut hinted with maple that finished very sweet. Of course it was hard to not go Chicago cut ribeye so I did. I wasn't let down. Next time I will opt bone-in but still the steak was prepared well and very tasty. I think the sides and service really won. The corn was creamy and spicy, very good. And the cream spinach was nothing to overlook.Fine job to all who helped put this meal together for us and your accolades are very well deserved.Cheers!"], ["Veronica P.", "Great atmosphere and nice ambiance. \u00a0 We had the seafoodTower which was excellent, a Caesar salad, two steaks, the Mac and cheese and potatoes on the side, all were great. \u00a0We love the fact that this place is a byob but u must share a glass w a Stranger. \u00a0Pretty neat idea.

I have never been here before, but I've heard great things. And sometimes when you hear great things about a place, it's hard for it to live up to your expectations, but this was absolutely not the case here. I'll start with the service. First of all, they do not seat people unless your entire party is here. Not really a pro or a con in my opinion, but just something to be aware of if you're dining with a large party. Anyway, we were seated promptly once everyone had arrived. We got one of those nice round booths, which are VERY comfy and made me real sleepy and content after a steak, superb sides, and a glass of syrah. Our waiter (forgot his name) was attentive (but not overbearing) and friendly. He had great recommendations and helped us order the right amount of food for our group of 4.For the food, I ordered the petite filet mignon (6 oz) and our party shared the thick cut bacon, Brussels sprouts, fries, corn, and crab cakes. My meat was a PERFECT medium rare, which as a steakhouse is really important to get right. The meats don't come with a lot of seasoning but they do bring you it on the side. I kind of prefer this because I like the natural taste of my filet mignon and I find that often times the seasoning can hide that flavor. But this is of course a personal preference. As for the sides, the fries were good, but nothing super spectacular. I didn't try the bacon because I'm not a big fan of bacon and especially not of thick fatty oily bacon, but if that's your thing, then this is the side for you! The corn was very creamy and flavorful. So delicious. The crab cakes were done very well. A great texture and a lot of crab. Definitely one of the better crab cakes I've had in my life. But my favorite side was definitely the sprouts! I'm a huge fan of sprouts and these were done so well! They were well seasoned and properly cooked and I could not stop eating them. I also LOOOOVE the sourdough bread they bring out for you, and I even had to bring a box home with me :) Honestly, I was really pleased with everything that I ate that night.Finally at the end of the night, our waiter brought us ice cream to celebrate my friends birthday. This ice cream was UH-MAZING. It's pretty hard to impress me with ice cream just because a.) ice cream is not usually my dessert of choice and b.) I've had a LOT of good ice cream. But this one was very creamy and smooth, and they chilled the tin ice cream dish it came in, which kept the texture and temperature perfect. I highly recommend ordering ice cream as a dessert! You definitely won't regret it. I don't give 5 stars a lot, so this is a big deal. I will absolutely be coming back. Worth the hype!!"], ["Lisa H.", "I heard so many amazing things about Bavette's Bar & Boeuf from friends, co-workers, and fellow Yelpers, but trying to make reservations for dinner was always a hassle. \u00a0Finally, I scored reservations for dinner on a Friday night for two. \u00a0It was three months out, but nonetheless I was finally going to experience what the hype was all about. \u00a0I decided to invite my sister since she appreciates food as much as me.Like always, my sister eats with her eyes rather than what her stomach can handle. \u00a0But what the heck....we ordered:Baked Crab Cake: baked crab, preserved lemon, and remoulade. \u00a0It was such a breath of fresh air to see the crab cake was not deep fried or full of fillers, but baked with fresh crab meat instead. \u00a0This was a simple crab cake, but it surely didn't lack any flavor.Baked Goat Cheese: served with red sauce and garlic bread. \u00a0There is just something about goat cheese and marinara sauce together that I yearn for. \u00a0The red sauce was hearty and full of bold flavors which complimented the smooth and creamy goat cheese perfectly.6 oz Filet Mignon - Petite Duchess Cut: \u00a0served with roasted tomatoes, b\u00e9arnaise sauce, and watercress. \u00a0With all the food we ordered, I was so glad the filet mignon was only 6 ounces. \u00a0It was the perfect size for little old me. \u00a0The cook and the seasoning was spot on.Double Bone Berkshire Pork Chop: served with herb jus and lemon. \u00a0This was my sister's entr\u00e9e. \u00a0She really enjoyed everything about this pork chop. \u00a0She stated that it was really tender and juicy. \u00a0The herb jus and lemon was the perfect topping to enhance the natural flavors of the pork.Elote Style Corn: chili, lime, cilantro, and parmesan. \u00a0I'm always reluctant to order elote style corn from any restaurant because it never tastes the same as the street vendors and it is just way more expensive. \u00a0But everyone was telling me that I had to try it here, so I again went against my gut and ordered the corn. \u00a0It definitely didn't taste like the authentic elote, but Bavatte's spin on it was still good. \u00a0The corn was creamy and the lime and chili gave it an extra zing. Chocolate Pie: this was the perfect ending to our feast. \u00a0The crust was rich and buttery, the filling was smooth and full of chocolate flavor, and the whipped cream was light and airy.Overall, many kudos to the chefs at Bavette. \u00a0Everything from the appetizers to dessert was perfectly cooked and flavored. \u00a0The service here was also phenomenal. \u00a0Our waiter was attentive without being too intrusive. \u00a0I can't wait until I have a chance to go back."], ["Joy M.", "i love everything about this place. came here for a nice fancy date night with my girlfriend to cap off a fun weekend getaway in chicago.the dim lighting and decor was very Mad Men-esque, like a 1960's lounge/sexy office mashup. definitely a place that you take someone special to as there is a huge selection of wines, beers, and liqueurs as well as a great menu for whatever you're feeling: oysters, salads, steaks, fish, chicken - it's all good.highlight of the night: their Oaxacan Old Fashion'd: a delightful and smokey twist on one of my favorite drinks. the tequila + mezcal went amazing with my steak.such a fun locale. definitely my favorite restaurant in one of my favorite cities.-civilities."], ["Danielle P.", "I really enjoyed my evening here.

I also had a wedge salad and my friend had the trout Caesar. I got a green tea and my friend got coffee after dinner. The coffee is french press and our server noticed that there were some grounds..

Highly recommend this restaurant for anyone!A few of my favorite dishes on their menu:- Fresh Oysters - Classic Ribeye - Elote Corn (must try!!!)- Pommes FritesOne of the greatest features of this steakhouse is that you may bring one bottle of wine for every two people in your party. This way, you can avoid the 300% mark-up and enjoy your fine wine at a reasonable price! The only ask Bavette's requires is that for every bottle, you \"send a glass\" to another table in the restaurant. It's best to send it to someone who also has a bottle where they too need to send a glass. :) What are you waiting for? This place is a must try!"], ["Ricardo B.", "Came here on a Sunday night and the environment was perfect. Different types of people but not packed. Service was quick and complete and the food was excelent and in good portion. Wine selection was fantastic and the dessert don't even get me started.

Came to Chicago from Atlanta and me and my gf made this place an official place to come in our next visit."], ["Tim L.", "I definitely underestimated Bavette's! I honestly didn't have any expectation for Bavette's since it's a bar/restaurant. My friend insisted on checking this place out so we ended up making reservations. We arrived 15 minutes before our reservation and went to the bar to grab a drink. We were lucky to grab seats at the bar and the bartender told us that we could just eat at the bar if we wanted to. Love that this place has an extensive list of entrees including steak, chicken, lamb, fish, pork chop, and etc. I guarantee you'll be able to find something you like at Bavette's.Had no idea what to order and the bartender recommended the filet mignon. He told me it's the best filet mignon in Chicago. Who wouldn't say that about their own restaurant though right?! Didn't wait long before my filet came. Cooked to perfection (medium rare) and the meat just melted in my mouth!! Bartender mentioned sprinkling a pinch of sea salt for flavor if needed but no garnishes/sauces were needed for this filet. Full of flavor and felt like I was in heaven for a few minutes!! Hands down one of the BEST filet mignon's that I ever had in my life!Great ambiance, service, and lastly incredible food!

And that, as they say, was the icing on the cake for us. \u00a0We won't be back."], ["Jane M.", "Enjoyed a pre theater dinner with my husband. \u00a0We ordered glasses of wine based on recs of our server, excellent choices. \u00a0I was debating between the lamb shank and the cassoulet. \u00a0He recommended the cassoulet as I was not likely to make it at home. \u00a0It was outstanding, so flavorful! \u00a0I also had the salad with fried goat cheese that was great!My husband loved his whole red snapper and his spinach soup! \u00a0 We had great service from our waiter and the wait staff! \u00a0Very welcoming restaurant with many choices! Will return for sure!"], ["Adam B.", "Very authentic and pretty traditional French bistrot au quartier, in other words, a little neighborhood joint with well-considered and well-prepared food. Warm, cozy, not pretentious at all. Lively on Saturday night without being too loud, certainly not hipster or trendy (although I seek those out too, but that's not Chez Moi).The first thing I noticed, food-wise, was the absolutely outstanding bread. This, I learned from Chef Dominique, the owner, who spent a long while chatting with us, is custom-made just for him in a two-day fermentation process. It's really outstanding.The menu is fairly large for a bistrot, with many French classics. For starters we enjoyed the escargots and tarte \u00e0 l'oignon aux lardons, which was nearly a meal in itself. The steak aux poivres was classique; the confit de canard (a special) was two full cuisses (leg & thigh together) with subtle orange sauce.All-in-all a very nice meal. Prices are a little on the high side if you don't choose the prix fixe, just the same as in France, come to think of it."], ["John I.", "Someone's gotta say it. \"Chez What?\" That's what I felt in the middle of the meal tonight. I walked into the restaurant with high expectations. I love simple but well-prepared bistro food. Would I have the steak frites, the cassoulet, the boef bourginon. Perhaps the onion tart or the onion soup? The server couldn't have been more pleasant, with her mastery of the language from living in France and some exploits on a California farm growing organic vegetables. Not versed at all on apertifs, though; so I just went with some bubbly and gin (French 75), which always goes down well. I had the French onion soup, which was tasty, but the broth was missing some complexity that I find elsewhere (you don't have to ask me twice to run, not walk, to La Sardine to have their soup). We shared an onion tart, one of my favorite French bistro dishes, but there was too much bacon (lardons), and it overpowered the onions and seemed to compact the buttery, puff-pastry \u00a0crust. A little Cotes du Rhone and we were starting to hum. I decided to risk my heart and soul to the red meat. Would I go for the Boeuf Bourguignon, the prime rib in pastry crust or the classic Steak Frites? I decided to be boring and go for the Steak Frites, partially because of the Yelpers that seemed gaga about the frites. Rare please. (Remember that, Yelpers; that's foreshadowing.)What are the chances that you're a restauranteur and you have a Yelper in the room? In my case, the odds were 12.5% of my table, because I happen to Yelp, and my friends do not. And what are the chances that one of eight people has a horrible experience with their food and the others appear satisfied with theirs? The steak came, and while it was about an inch thick, it was cooked to the consistency of boot leather. Even if I had ordered it well done, it would still have been overcooked. The poivre sauce probably tasted good, but it really needs a penetrable steak to go with it. I should have read the menu more closely as well, because the wonderful fries that the Yelper's were talking about were not these \"home cut\" French fries, that were OK, but nothing like the wonderfully-crisp, thin frites one might expect. One of the worst meals of my year, in November, no less.Why, you ask, didn't I send the steak back? I probably should have taken the nice waitress aside and told her to take it off my bill. But I definitely didn't want to turn into the center of attention while everyone was finishing their meals before they got me a new one. Been there, didn't like doin' that.Finally, I don't know if it was because we were in the back (former Red Rooster space, anyone?) or because someone was playing a twisted psychological trick on us, but there was a song playing that must have repeating again on again that we probably noticed after 10 times & then couldn't keep our ears off of. I found the lyrics and determined the song, \"J'appelle,\" by Alain Souchon. How did I know? The chorus of the song went, \"J'appelle, J'appelle, J'appelle, J'appelle; J'appelle, J'appelle, J'appelle, J'appelle; J'appelle, J'appelle, J'appelle, J'appelle; J'appelle, J'appelle, J'appelle, oh J'appelle...\" Literally.

The bread and butter they put out at the beginning is so yummy but make sure you save room for the real meal! The salmon was cooked so perfectly it just melted in my mouth. I also got the frog leg special, and while I realized I wasn't a fan of frog, it came on a bed of mashed potatoes with buttery lemony sauce that was heavenly. My mom got the cassoulet both times we visited because she loved it so much. I really enjoyed the French onion soup the first time I ate there too. For dessert, both times we had the Brittany cake that comes on a bed of salty caramel sauce. It's apparently their most popular dessert and I can see why.

You're paying $99 for what is supposed to be a $160 value. You receive 4 courses per person. No way does each course average $20. Sure, there are quality ingredients involved, such as scallops, and duck, but you are receiving smaller portions of them. And there is no wine included. Our meal, with the groupon value, came out to $180, including tip- and all we had extra were three glasses of wine. Not worth it. The new groupon, which allows you to order off the menu and gives you $65 worth of food for $35 is a much better deal because you are getting what you are paying for. So yes, please do come here, just not with the tasting menu groupon, if they ever offer it again. Buy the other one. Or go with their happy hour prix fixe menu for $30 a person.As for the food and experience, it was exceptional. Each of our courses was artfully prepared and delicious. The asparagus and tomato salad as the first course had a gorgeous balsamic reduction for a dressing and shaved parmesan. The scallops over mashed potatoes drizzled with honey was the second course. I didn't love the honey, but the scallops were cooked perfectly. The third course was duck leg with braised carrots. The carrots were nothing special, but again, the protein was cooked perfectly. Our dessert was a slice of shortbread cake with vanilla ice cream and burnt caramel sauce. It was the flavor of creme brulee with a shortbread cookie and some ice cream to bring it all together. The cake was a little too shortbready and I would have preferred something less crunchy, but I loved the sauce and the ice cream.The service was attentive and polite, not taking our plates until both of us were done, and not rushing us. The decor of the restaurant is lovely and romantic- the chandeliers are especially beautiful.

Was it called the Rooster or something? To our delight our server was Michael who had worked at Cafe Bernard and its caboose the Red Rooster. We remembered him.Chez Moi has different ownership than Cafe Bernard, my understanding that the chef was formerly with Bistro 110.Starters: Escargot. Garlicy. Hot. Good. I ordered a glass of Pinot Noir that struggled to stand out against this spicy dish. Next time I would order a bigger win.Main: Beef Tenderloin with Phyllo Crust. Perhaps a take on Beef Wellington? I liked it. Wife stole half of my mashed potatoes. Dish was hot and perfect. Mike suggested a Cab/Merlot blend that kept up with the dish.Final: Wife ordered Creme Brulee, I ordered the Profiteroles and pretended it was her idea. Very very good. The latter come in three, and should be shared by two people. The creme brulee would be hard to share.On our way out, chatted with India who along with her husband Dominic owns the restaurant.

My friend had the mussels, which she loved, and I had the Oeuf Muerette (to be honest I didn't even know what this was... and still don't... but it was phenomenal.) We each ordered a side of veggies/mushrooms.All of our food came out in a perfectly timely manner, with the exception of the vegetable sides which never showed. Since we wanted to get home to *cough* watch the Bachelor *cough* we asked to take the sides to go. I thought the man who checked in on us was going to cry when he found out our sides never came out. He immediately had the sides boxed up, and brought out a piece of their unbelievable G\u00e2teau Breton Salidou (Brittany cake with salty caramel sauce and ice cream) with a candle and \"Happy Birthday\" written in chocolate. Then our sweet waitress (apologizing profusely for forgetting our sides) helped us pick yet another course to take home so that we could get the full value of the Groupon.I left with 4 boxes of food, completely full and satisfied, with a grin on my face. Such a great experience and incredible food."], ["Melissa S.", "One of my favorite spots in Chicago. Every time I have been here I've only sat outside so I have no idea what its like inside.

The mussels, casoulet and duck in orange sauce were good but they were not very impressive. \u00a0Yet, the dessert was the main part.I ordered the Brittany cake aka Breton gateau which was sooo delicious tbh, I wanna like that plate xD.

While I don't remember all of the beautiful food I had (just that it was tasty), I have to point out that you must go and order the Filet de Boeuf en Crote. The portion is huge, so come with an appetite or share with a dining partner.

Relaxed, efficient and delicious would be the way to describe this bistro.I could go on and on above the perfectly done medium rare steak, or tasty onion soup, or my friend saying that her pork tenderloin was just as perfect, but I won't.

Of all the \"Bistro\"s in Chicago, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."], ["Mark M.", "Thoroughly enjoyed our Valentine Dinner last night. Both the pork tenderloin and the cassoulet were delicious. Our waiter paired glasses of wine for each of us for each course. Try the Chardonnay. What a wonderful way to get a head start for our special day."], ["Helen S.", "I've never been to France before, but eating at this little restaurant in River North was how I imagine a meal at a quaint little bistro in France would be like. You got the black-and-white checkered floors, delicious food, and the sweetest server with the heaviest French accent.We used a Gilt City offer and started off with a champagne flight, which came with three half-flutes. I'm not quite sure how champagne flights are supposed to be done - are you supposed to drink them with your meal like wine, or all before the meal itself since they gave us the flights at the very beginning? I ended up sipping my champagne with the courses but I'm pretty sure that I was doing it wrong.We both ordered crab cakes for apps, which were great. Very heavy on the crab meat and barely any filler, yum. However, the crab cakes sat on a bed of thinly sliced root veggies that were strangely sour and tasted a little weird. We also each got a $1 oyster which were super fresh.For my main course, I ordered short ribs in red wine gravy on a bed of mash. The delicious meat was fork tender and the gravy complemented it well, plus the mash soaked up any extra. My bf got the salmon, which was cooked perfectly but I didn't think that it was well seasoned (then again, I'm biased against salmon this week since I've been eating it for the past few days). My dessert was profiteroles, which were three cream puffs filled ice cream and covered with chocolate drizzle. My bf got the chocolate cake, which turned out to be a chocolate lava cake much to our surprise. Both desserts were delicious but super heavy. I came into this meal reasonably hungry, but was practically bursting near the end. Service was great - our waiter was super quick and just the most adorable person really. He made sure when we were leaving that we didn't trip on the awkward step outside the front door, and I wanted to give him a big hug right then and there because I trip quite often. Overall, good dining experience with solid food."], ["Myco N.", "My boyfriend took me here this past Saturday for my birthday. Being an avid (if not obsessive) Yelp reader, he reassured me that it would not disappoint! And it didn't, or at least the food didn't, but I'm getting ahead of myself. SETTING - very cozy and cute atmosphere. The place is unassuming from the outside, but quite lovely on the inside, if not a bit small. The Frank Sinatra and Edith Piaf songs floating through the air and romantic ambiance more made up for it, so go with someone cute and cozy up. Try not to sit by 2 very loud and immature college girls talking about their boobs, if you can manage it. It'll make for a much more pleasant experience. FOOD - The food was delicious! We started with escargots and a perfect mini loaf of baguette. I must say they are prepared with a bit of puff pastry on top which I wasn't used to, but yummy nonetheless. Wish it had a bit more garlic butter. I proceeded to polish off my duck breast in record time, while my boyfriend died over the pork tenderloin. We both loved our meals, and if it wasn't so unacceptable, we would've licked the plate. We didn't. Instead we opted to be normal people and ordered creme brulee for dessert. Which was great as well, but if you're a French restaurant, I more than expect you to not screw that up. DRINKS - I nursed a Moliere while my date sipped on his Manhattan throughout dinner. Nothing special. I would stick with wine next time instead of cocktails. They were rather unimpressive. SERVICE - The only area I was sorely disappointed in. Our waiter, though polite, was nothing short of curt and unattentive. He was dry, to-the-point, and appeared only to take our orders, deliver our food, and take our bill. We didn't get a smile, or so much as a \"How is everything tasting?\" I'd like to think it was because I inhaled my duck so fast he didn't come back in time, but I doubt that. I've gotten better service at restaurants where my bill wasn't $150, so when I walk into a fine-dining establishment, I expect the wait staff to ask me if the duck was too rare, or if I'd like more baguette (yes, in fact, I would). The same waiter took care of the 3 tables next to us, and paid more than enough attention to the others. Maybe he just really enjoyed the college girl boob-size conversation piece...OVERALL - I'll give it another go and not let a poor service experience get in the way. The food was good enough to warrant a 4-star rating. A bientot!"], ["Ian L.", "Food, 4.7 star, rounded up because there were no flaws.Service, 4.5 star.Went for Restaurant week with the partner, I thought it was incredible.First off, I had the mussels in garlic butter, a very generous portion for restaurant week.

Slight edge to the escargots.For mains, I had Beef Bourguignon which was good quality, well balanced and seasoned. \u00a0Hers was again the winner, pork tenderloin medallions on asparagus and caramalized apple.Dessert was a standard chocolate cake, extremely rich and OH SO GOOD.We loved it, will definitely be checking out their regular menu."], ["T N T.", "Came here on a Monday night for my birthday dinner with a friend. I was absolutely enthralled by the food and the service. Steven (sp?) was extremely entertaining and very knowledgeable about the food and the wine.

When the other table was leaving, they actually sang happy birthday to me! I assume a little bird (aka Steven) told them that it was my birthday. Made my birthday. I will definitely be back when I'm in Chicago again."], ["M P.", "Disappointing. Scheduled a romantic birthday dinner for my husband and the evening was a let down. We started with the cheese and meat plate, the menu said it came with p\u00e2t\u00e9 but when the plate arrived, no p\u00e2t\u00e9. We mentioned it to the waiter and he said the plate shouldn't come with pate but if the menu says it does then he would get us some, I appreciated his promptness in addressing the issue... But still a little weird that it's listed but shouldn't be? We then had a salad which was fine, a little too heavily dressed for my personal taste and then French onion soup. The soup was very tasty BUT it was all cheese! I wish there had actually been more soup under all of that cheese to enjoy! At this point the evening has been fine but this is where it starts to go downhill....My husband ordered the short ribs and I ordered the braised lamb shank at the waiters recommendation. The lamb shank was literally the most unremarkable thing I have ever put in my mouth. It tasted like mystery meat, if you closed your eyes you would have no idea what it was. It lacked any kind of seasoning, I took a couple of bites hoping it was just that bite, or just that bite, or just that bite..... But, alas, it was my whole entree. My husband tried it and felt the same. On the flip, his short rib was delicious! I feel like the lack of flavor in my lamb shank can't even be captured with words, it was literally one of the most bland things I've ever tasted.... I must believe there was an error in making the dish that night, no restaurant would intentionally serve this night after night, nor a server recommend it.We left the lamb shank plate nearly full and when the server came he didn't even inquire if we liked it/if everything was ok/if we were done, he just picked the plates up off the table. We then order the chocolate lava cake and some coffee because they were out of port. When the cake arrives it is smashed open with the ice cream placed over the broken cake, already melted. I love chocolate lava cake and order it frequently, no one serves the cake already open.... Part of the appeal is cutting into the cake and opening up the gooey middle.... If you look through photos of the dessert on yelp you'll see they traditionally serve the cake whole. It was so obvious they broke the cake and then just tried to cover it up with the ice cream. I understand it tastes the same (although the ice cream melted much faster being placed on the hot \"lava\" before being served) but I think it says a lot about the restaurant.... Clearly no one tasted the lamb shank, they make an error with the dessert and serve it anyway.... And we didn't receive our coffees until after we had finished our mutilated dessert. All in all, it was a memorable evening but not in a good way. \u00a0We will not be making a return visit. Now I'm off to try and add flavor to the giant take home container of braised lamb shank I now have in my fridge...."], ["Ashley S.", "I've heard about this place multiple times and never took the opportunity to make a reservation. Luckily a date made it for me and we loved it. We were the only table besides people at the bar at 8p on a Thursday night. But I have a feeling our server would have been awesome sauce even if the place was slammed. But maybe don't pick it if your companion is conversationally challenged. Let's break it down:Didn't offer tons of wine recos but I loved the Malbec we had and the server'sMussels - Huge and surprisingly tensor. Great startPork - I don't eat enough protein so I went with the other white meat based on the server's reco. It was tender with a capital T. I should stalk the chef to train me. Salmon - The crispy skin and excellent temp \u00a0blew my date away. Plus a dude that likes salmon is a bonus for me. Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e - Complimentary from the chef. Boy was I not sad.

We had excellent recommendations and service from our waiter, Steven, and opened with the Salad de Ch\u00e8vre, which was spectacular, and the Lobster Bisque, which was good. The bread was hot and right out of the oven and we could have eaten an entire baguette, hard on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. Our main courses were the duck and the bouillabaisse, both of which were fantastic! We finished with a flawless creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and the soft in the center chocolate cake.

The steak was seasoned perfectly and the bearnaise sauce was also really good and the fries were warm and crispy. The skate wing was also very delicious but the portion was smaller that we expected and I preferred the \u00a0flavor of the steak and fries (if I come again and want a light dinner, I'll definitely order skate wing). I've never had escargot before, but it seemed to be cooked appropriately; I really liked the sauce. The french onion soup was a bit cheesy for me, but it's the perfect thing if you like cheese. The mousse really was not good at all (very dense and boring) but the chocolate sauce on the profiterole was AMAZING and went well with the caramel (I was scraping the plate when we finished).The service left much to be desired. We dined on a Friday night and there were probably 3 servers in the entire restaurant. After the host seated us, we waited for about 20 minutes and no one came over. Another couple was seated next to us and were served automatically, when I objected the the server apologized and said \"Oh have you been helped?\" We explained the situation and she apologized and filled in, but it left a bad taste in my mouth.

Really wanted to love this place but sadly, cannot recommend it. \u00a05 stars for cocktails, 1 star for service and 3 stars for food but given the prices, I expected better so I'll have to round down on my review.We had a reservation for 8 on a Saturday night and were told it would be a little while before we were seated. No problem, we went to the bar and not two minutes later were told our table was ready. Thing is, the expertly crafted cocktails (try the Sazerac - amazing) take a long time to make. So there we stood with the hostess kinda hanging around with us in an awkward trap. \u00a0Someone should have said - no problem - we'll bring your drinks to your table. instead we let the ladies sit and by buddy and I waited for our drinks. Thankfully they were worth the wait.Our server was very inexperienced and that really played a big role in my dislike of the place. Just because you put a dress shirt on a 23 year old and give them a white apron to make them look like a Parisian waiter, does not a great server make. She was hard to find, had to ask for bread twice, good luck getting your water glass refilled and a replacement fork was no where to be had. When you spend you time looking around the room hoping your server will stop by, instead of chatting with your friends, that sucks.The one time she did stop by was right as our food was placed down. Kinda hard to know if everything came out OK if you haven't given me a chance to try it. I should mentioned the place was busy but not crazy busy.The food was hit or miss. The apps like steak tare tare and the scrambled eggs with lobster were great. The entrees were so-so. My Duck a l'Orange was meh.

The bread and butter were excellent, quite possibly the best part of the meal. I had the prix fixe meal ($30 if you go between 5pm and 6:30pm), which is a starter/appetizer, an entree, and a dessert. The asparagus soup (the soup du jour) was good. Slightly bland, my friend and I both needed to add a little of the salt/pepper on the table. For my entree, I had the lamb, which was served with an interesting (in a not-so-good way) spicy bean salad side and steamed and buttered broccoli. The broccoli was good, but the bean salad did NOT do it for me; its spice was just overdone and it was a little too salty, too. There was just TOO much going on in the bean salad. The lamb was good and tasty, not gamey, and seasoned effectively with cumin. For dessert I had the pear fruit tart with a helping of ice cream. It was quite good, and it appears to me that the chef knows breads because the crust was yummy and flaky. Overall, hits and misses, nothing too spectacular (except the bread and butter, which strikes me as somewhat telling).Atmosphere: Ehhhh...for an expensive-ish French restaurant, I expected more. Sure, there are crisp white tablecloths, expensive-feeling silverware, and bud vases on each of the tables, but that doesn't blind me to the other odd things decorating the establishment. Perhaps they were going for a French provincial look (which I'm admittedly not very familiar with), but it was just plain odd to have what looked like a welcome-mat-quality rug hanging on the wall. I guess you could say the decor was just pretty eclectic, and I'm not sure if it all worked. On the plus side, the bathroom was nice, well-maintained, well-decorated, and well-stocked with Williams-Sonoma hand soup and hand lotion. On the minus side, the ceiling was really a disappointment. It reminded me of an office building (with those long rectangular slabs), but they were textured b/c they were concrete. All of it was painted white. Oh, and the large, square-shaped, slatted air vents were very noticeable on the ceiling.Service: Our server was friendly and helpful. When my friends wanted wine suggestions, he had them. Good job with that. Other stuff was not so great. There were just service issues that would not happen at a top-notch restaurant. We drained our water glasses a number of times and had to wait a bit for refills. When they served our food, only the one server would be serving, so our food came not all at once, but in the waves in which he could carry it. (I went in a group of seven.) So two people would get their food, then three people, then two people. All in succession, but only by our one server. We should have been served all at the same time, especially as the other servers who were there were just watching our server go back and forth. This appears to be a training issue, so maybe the owners have not caught onto this? Or maybe I'm just too fastidious in my expectations? Also, when we ran out of bread (as a table of seven would when given only one bread basket), I had to ask upon receiving my soup if we could have more bread. Shouldn't bread be refilled? Maybe I'm expecting too much here.Value: The quantity of food is very good for a French restaurant at the price that we paid. That being said, the overall value, considering the quality of the food (hit or miss) and the price paid, is really not that great. I'd much rather spend another twenty bucks and get the prix fixe lunch at (yeah yeah, you know they're my favorite) Jean-Georges or Bouley.Expectations? Totally NOT met. I expected more from \"fine dining.\" But I guess people don't have many options in Hyde Park. Eh.Overall, the food was okay and the restaurant staff friendly, but the experience is just not worth the price you pay to have it, EVEN AT the prix fixe price. I can't imagine coming here to eat off the regularly-priced menu."]], "Mon Ami Gabi": [["Tom B.", "This is Chicago fine dining at its best. We come here every year on the weekend before Christmas.

The Belden is now a luxury apartment building; they stopped being a hotel a year or so ago, which was a tragedy. Regardless, Mon Ami Gabi has a a relatively small menu, but each item is carefully crafted. I got the 22oz bone in ribeye, which is pan fried and comes with fries (frites).

The fries were good, just not my favorite frites ever. Paired with a Bordeaux, my meal was tr\u00e9s bon.I will say my friend got a filet mignon with the Merlot butter and my goodness I will be getting that next time. I really enjoyed this place!"], ["Sean G.", "Pure French comfort food that's a bit more elevated than expected. My wife and I have been here a hundred times. It's on our regular restaurant circuit and we always come here for special occasions because they just do it right. Overall, this is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. It's situated in the Belden-Stratford, across the street from the Lincoln Park Zoo & Conservatory. Going for a stroll through the zoo, then coming here for dinner is my favorite thing to do on a Saturday. During the holidays, Zoo Lights and dinner at Mon Ami Gabi is a tradition, but reserve early - it's also the tradition of many others!My wife and I honeymooned in Paris, and the first time we dined at Gabi's, we were immediately transported back there. There are a few clich\u00e9d things about the decor, but it's tastefully done. The bench seats are surprisingly comfortable, and even though it looks like you're going to be cramped, you are never intruded on by other diners and the theatrical touch of pulling out the table for you to sit is always a treat.As for the food, I've tried just about everything on the menu, but they specialize in Steak Fr\u00eetes - and have many options to choose from, which is really unique. I do have to recommend the Dijon, Classique and the Bordelaise treatments - mouthwateringly delicious and tender. Now, if you've never had a classic, Parisian bistro steak, you will be in for a surprise. Unlike American steaks, they take a strip and pound it thin. If that sounds weird, don't let it deter you. It's super tender and every bite is exceptionally flavorful. The fr\u00eetes are unique, and can take some getting used to (think of large, crispy potato sticks instead of traditional fries), but are a wonderful counterpoint to the tender steak.Other stars on the menu, which is seasonal for all non-steak choices, are the traffic-stopping Beouf Bourguignon and Braised Shortrib during the colder months. I often get the Trout Amandine, which is amazingly delicate and extremely flavorful, but this last time I ordered the Lemon Salmon... it was the best salmon dish I've had this side of Paris and was beautifully presented. Perfectly seasoned and seared with unbelievably tasty thumbelina carrots and a lightly minted pea pur\u00e9e with both peas and pea pods in it. I thought I died and went to heaven. Also, the Country P\u00e2t\u00e9 is a special treat, but if you are a fan of Escargot, as I am, just get it and ask for extra bread - you'll definitely want to dip it into the garlic butter sauce after! They are simply perfect. It's very hard to go wrong here, even their soups are fabulous - their soup specials are invariably extraordinary and you'll love the presentation. For dessert, they have the usuals like an excellent Chocolate Mousse and Cr\u00e8me Br\u00fbl\u00e9e but get the Cr\u00eapes Suzette if available. You will not be disappointed.The only thing I feel are a miss are the Mussels Marin\u00ecere. I used to live on the Atlantic coast, and really acquired a taste for small, meaty mussels. What they have here are the big, fleshy ones in a white wine sauce that doesn't work with my palette, but I've seen many others enjoy them.They have a very nice wine list, and even have excellent choices by the glass in their wine cart, unlike many other restaurants. Their house Pinot Noir is a solid choice, but I prefer their C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne when not having my usual. Speaking of which, I've racked up quite a martini body count here. Because their bartender makes them so perfectly, it's hard to limit yourself to 2... even though you should!Final thoughts are to come here for a great experience: delicious, upscale, comforting food and impeccable service. Every server superlatively executes their craft, but Amber and Vincent really shine. They are a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant, so if you become a regular - and you likely will - pony up the $25 for the frequent diner card and sign up for the text promotion program. It is worth it."], ["Aashish J.", "Great food, good service, perfect for date nights! I really liked Mon Ami Gabi.Thumbs up:1. Food: Scallops Gratinees: Superbly delicious!

My only problem with this place is that the service was semi annoying. When I called on the phone to double check to see if my reservations were good, the lady acted like I was wasting her time and she rushed our conversation. The waiter we had didn't even introduce himself which I thought was really odd since that's how all restaurants are. Fortunately this did not ruin our night because the goodness delicious! Wild Boar Ragu was a great dinner choice; the meat would fall all over in your mouth. The appetizer was baked goat cheese with bread and marinara sauce. It's divine! I couldn't stop eating it. Depending on what day you go, double check with what the specials are. For some reason, we weren't told what it was, but there's a board around to show you what they have, but it's not all over their wall so Id recommend just asking the waiter instead.This is the second french restaurant I've been to and one thing I notice is that they love to fill up their space. It looks cramped, but it doesn't feel that way. The interior design has that kind of ambience of how you would want your romantic night to be.

The brunch menu is really small and there's nothing on it that differentiates it from any other breakfast place in Lincoln Park. The wait staff was pretty stuck up and they forgot to bring us 3 things we asked for. As far as the food, it was fine, but just fine. I had the salmon salad which was a piece of salmon on spinach basically, very underwhelming. My boyfriend had the steak and frites which was oily and the frites were awful. I would not recommend this restaurant. Save your money and pass on this restaurant."], ["Jean L.", "I first came here with a group of 10 and received spectacular service. The steaks are thin, which I don't know if it's a steak-frites kind of thing, but it was definitely different. I got some kind of mushroom sauce on my filet and subbed out my frites for a salad. I left full and satisfied. We also ordered muscles, snails, and french onion soup (which apparently they're known for).As for the second time I came here, I was without a reservation, on a Friday night, at 7pm. The hostess was super nice and said that her 6:30 reservation still hadn't shown up, so if I would bear with her for another 15 minutes, she would see if she could squeeze me in. I waited, and luckily the no-shows never showed! This round was also very good.To be honest, the food, while good, was nothing to-die-for, but I LOVED the cocktails!! They were strong, traditional, and pleasant. Hell, I'd go back for the bar alone."], ["Jialing L.", "Celebrated my 22nd birthday here last summer. The restaurant itself has a great atmosphere and the service is amazing. A couple of my friends were running late but they still seated us and kept bringing us bread as we waited (seriously, we had so much bread. it was so good). My friends ordered the escargot for me to try since I had never had any before and it was an interesting experience. Too garlicky for my taste but it was good. I ordered the bordelaise steak frites for my entree and really enjoyed it. The steak itself was very flavorful and the portion size was huge. The frites were fine but not my favorite type. They also brought me a chocolate cupcake for my birthday and it was delicious. Really glad i chose this place to celebrate my birthday."], ["Nick D.", "Mon Ami is always great. \u00a0It's in an interesting building (look up at the ceiling fresco in the lobby). \u00a0You can make a great night of it if you head an an event at the zoo and then pop in for some steak frites."], ["Jenny S.", "Great service, atmosphere and most of all, food! Definitely will come back again!I came with a few friends for restaurant week and had a delicious meal and overall, wonderful experience. Our waiter even overheard my love for Julia Child and commented that the iconic gastronome and francophile once visited the restaurant in the 80's and that he had actually served her! He described her as a incredibly pleasant woman (and lush).Then, I definitely geeked out. Holy Moly.I wanted to eat everything, of course, but had to settle on my own, singular meal and just taste the others my friends had ordered.I would reccomend the frise\u00e9 salad, beef bourguignon, \u00a0and chocolate mousse! Trust me! And if you love dry, full bodied red wines, try the Bordeaux Sup\u00e9rieur. Excellent! I should've gotten a bottle.It's a cozy, casual, romantic atmosphere tucked away in a cute boutique hotel. People are seated somewhat close to each other but of the 3 other tables that surrounded ours, everyone was extremely friendly and cordial throughout the night even though there was a degree of bumping eachother between servers and bathroom breaks.Whether its date night, girls night or dinner with the family, this is a very good bet!"], ["Mike S.", "This place got really busy quite quickly on a Sunday night. I would definitely recommend placing a reservation. The seating on the inside was really tight with the tables all really close together which I typically don't mind but it can be awkward for strangers to be a part of your conversation. The food:Fresh loaf of French bread-delicious and warm. French Onion Soup-very good but is a large portion, I would split with another member of your party if possible. Roquefort Steak Frites-delicious steak that was cooked perfectly with blue cheese sauce drizzled on top. Pommes Pur\u00e9e-very good and creamy, however the portion was a bit smaller than I was hoping for. Bananas Foster Crepe-delicious with ice cream in every bite"], ["Lissa S.", "Late review, but my boyfriend and I came here during restaurant week back in February. The food was delicious, the atmosphere cozy and romantic (the \"cozy\" part may have been largely due to the massive snowstorm outside, but I plan to go back sometime this summer, so I'll let you know), and the wait staff very kind and knowledgeable. I have no complaints and certainly plan to return! Great spot for a nice dinner date out."], ["Perry R.", "Sunday Brunch was great. Although the menu selection was limited all the choices were interesting and well priced. Our server Amber was knowledgeable and followed up at appropriate times. French kiss sandwich was tasty and omelettes were full of tasty bits as promised on the menu. While the red wine bottles sat outside for single pours they were chilled to ensure they did not pick up the heat of the day. Only minor complaint was that the frites were warm- not hot - probably sitting too long under the warming lights."], ["Greggory H.", "The food here is absolutely fantastic! Sure its a chain of sorts, but the steak and steamed mussels are to die for! The classic French bread served with the meal is something special.

Fantastic wine selection and perfect ambiance"], ["Michael B.", "I've eaten at the one in Oakbrook before which was a little too suburban shopping mall, concept-ish for me. \u00a0I'm generally not a big fan of these theme or concept restaurants owned and managed by large restaurant groups and they can often prioritize being businesses first and restaurants after that, versus establishments that truly take pride in their food, food sources, service and customer experiences. \u00a0Not always, but enough that's I'm cautious. That said, I was there as a guest for a birthday party in a private room with limited menu choices. \u00a0What I ordered, mushroom soup, salmon, root vegetables were all pretty good. \u00a0I know the French like to slather everything in butter and add lots of salt, which helps but not really my thing, but, hot and tasty it was.Service was professional. Good buzz, looked like a local and Sat night date crowd mix.It's not in or on the top of my rotation, but for those living in the neighborhood, it seems like a nice place to have in the hood."], ["James Z.", "I normally enjoy Mon Ami Gabi, but the service on Sunday 6 September was uncustomarily unacceptable. We had a reservation -- it was an anniversary -- and a decent table was not to be had. We were begrudingly seated at a small table by a very loud (bar-crowd-like) party, then re-seated at a table that would barely hold a sandwich, let alone two plates. We were told by the manager Whitney that everything else was booked. And yet the good tables were empty. The refusal even to attempt to accommodate us set the wrong tone, and even then, it would have been nice if Whitney came around to check on us, The food: It was not a stellar night either. Why anyone would serve pate with iron-hard bread escapes me. Some of the usual staff do not seem to be there, and I hope management will remedy the situation for its remaining customers. You might get away with this kind of service in Lincoln Square or Andersonville, where new places start up, but not at a place that had been solid."], ["Liz K.", "To be honest, I was disappointed with my recent experience during Restaurant Week, mostly due to the service perspective and less due to the food aspect.Two of my girlfriends and I met at Mon Ami Gabi for a dinner reservation this past week at 7:00. We ended up waiting past our reservation time because the hostess offered us a better round table by a window, if we were willing to wait (which we did). It was nice to be at a table that was off of the beaten path of the restaurant, but my complaint about the table itself is that it was round and the white paper on top was square and was jutting out. It was an annoyance for the entire meal, even after I adjusted my seat. Our waiter just seemed rushed and disinterested in our table the whole night. When we weren't ready to order the first time he came by, at least 15 minutes passed before he came by to check on us again. I asked for a small substitution with my salad, just balsamic vinegar and oil dressing instead of the dressing from the menu. When our food came, the salad wasn't dressed and there was no balsamic vinegar and oil. It was a runner who brought the food and our waiter didn't check back for another 5 minutes after we had already started. Although we stayed for over two hours, the waiter never once spent more than 30 seconds at our table explaining the menu, asking us how our dishes were, or otherwise checking in on us. I was very disappointed considering the good impression I had of Mon Ami Gabi before this experience...but since my friends' dishes looked good (and I didn't have anything but a salad), I may be back at another time to try it again."], ["Mike D.", "Went here with my friend on a Wednesday around 8:30. I figured we could walk in and get a table for 2 no problem, but that was not the case. \u00a0The restaurant was busy and slightly smaller than I imagined. We were given a 45 minute wait, so we grabbed 2 of the six seats at the bar.The bartender was super cool. I tried the gringolandia beer, a Latin-Chicago fusion beer that I hadn't seen anywhere else. After about 30-35 minutes we were seated. \u00a0We tried the butternut squash soup but ended up splitting the onion soup instead, which was a bad decision. The butternut squash was wayyy better. And the french bread they provide is perfect for dipping in the squash soup.We ordered a bottle of dark red wine from the south of France, which went really well with the filet mignon. I was extremely happy with my entre\u00e9 selection: The filet mignon grilled medium rare, with a side of saute\u00e9d mushrooms subbed for the fries. (Tip: most restaurants will allow you to sub a side for the 'steak frites' or whatever they have, which is basically just a fancy way of saying steak and fries). \u00a0 Also important to note was that I chose the merlot butter option, not the other filet option. My buddy got the regular and when he tried mine he knew he had muffed that one.All in all, a good place for a semi-special occasion or just for your average bro-date!"], ["Rebekah L.", "Overpriced and insane delivery fees for piss-poor portion sizes and cold food. They gave us a \"free\" stale baguette, which sucked.

Personal favorites include Caesar salad, French onion soup, steak frites bordelaise and the salmon.

I live down the road now, and my husband and I have been wanting to try it again. I was very happy with the results. The mussels were delicious. Definitely dunk the baguette in the liquid- the best part. Steak Bordelaise is one of my favorites, they cooked it to perfection. Often when I order medium-rare, it will be too rare for me, but this was just right. \u00a0Husband got Steak Bearnaise, he loved it although I did not try it (rare for me, but I enjoyed my own so much that I just didn't have any desire to steal off of his plate!). Drank a bottle of Bordeaux, paired nicely with our steaks :)We ordered the Banana Foster Crepe for dessert. I'm still dreaming about it. Our waiter was great. The one draw back was that when he came around the first time we weren't ready, and then it took him a bit to get back to us again. But honestly not an issue, we just had a late reservation so we were starving! Definitely will go back again when craving steak frites!"], ["Stephanie S.", "Hosted my best friend's bridal shower. Super cute inside but... Working in the FOH at a French restaurant myself back home, I was a little disappointed.

The main server was delightful (I didn't catch his name), though."], ["Alice D.", "I enjoyed this place, though I had chicken, at the suggestion of my sister-in-law, instead of steak; my wife did too, a different kind of chicken, a breast flattened and seasoned. My brother-in-law, who visits often, ordered everything except the entree, so life was good. The burgundy was excellent. Appetizers included crab cakes, flattened and exquisitely seasoned, salmon tartare and avocado served as if ceviche, and scallops in melted cheese in a scalloped serving dish. All wonderful. The manager and waiter were full of stories that they shared; John, the waiter, a singer, has a small cake and pastry business called Vincent Van Dough, specializing in a 6-layer Pride cake, and if the cookies he served us with other desserts is any indication, he must be doing gangbusters. It was a great meal. I'll be back to try the steak-frites."], ["Liz H.", "My boyfriend and I came here for dinner on Wednesday night, we were promptly seated at a table for four even though we were only a party of two to allow us a little more space. A baguette and an amuse bouche were brought out after being seated, both were delicious and on the house. John was our server and he was amazing, he allowed us the perfect amount of time to look over the menu and was attentive without being overbearing. We order the mussels to start, they were fantastic - I highly recommend. For our main, we split the seafood platter and for $50, it was well worth the money. We both also had dessert, I the lemon creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and my boyfriend, the chocolate soup - a whimsical take on a very simple after dinner treat. All in all the entire experience was a wonderful one and we will definitely be retuning."], ["Nathan S.", "I didn't have dinner, but I came but I came for desert.

We were seated about 30 mins later.Our server was Ryan and he was FABULOUS!! We didn't feel rushed or neglected.He brought us a warm petite baguette with this pickled carrot slaw. \u00a0We didn't want to fill up on bread so started to look at the menu.We started with the warm brie accompanied by black pepper honey, hazelnut and croutons. \u00a0The brie was creamy and mild and the honey and hazelnut balanced the dish out very nicely.We ordered and split a fris\u00e9e, kale warm bacon salad and it was heaven! \u00a0Wasn't drenched in dressing, right amount of everything and we both had a poached egg on top.For dinner, I had the chicken grandmere with a side of whipped cauliflower.The chicken was SO moist and tender and bursting with flavor. \u00a0My friend thought I was being inappropriate with my food with all the noises that I was making...LOL ( she was teasing of course)She had the caramelized sea scallops. \u00a0There were 5 huge nice and sweet tender scallops on her plate. \u00a0It was SO good. (she shared)We finished our meal off with a bowl of pear sorbet which was very refreshing.If you love French cuisine, you'll love this place...however...if you're in a hurry this is not the place for you. \u00a0This is a place to actually enjoy your meal and life!Bon App\u00e9it!"], ["Melanie S.", "Every time I come back to Mon Ami Gabi, I enjoy it more and more.Last night was the restaurant's 15th anniversary, and as part of the celebration, they were offering LEYE Frequent Diner cardholders triple points and free gift cards just for having dinner there. I'm a total points whore, so I can never pass up an offer like this.Other than a few missteps from our server (he just seemed a bit out of it), it was a near-perfect evening; from starting out with a flawless French 75 (who doesn't love a cocktail named after a firearm?), to ending with one of the best desserts known to mankind.Our appetizers were a half-dozen fresh oysters from Prince Edward Island, served with mignonette, cocktail sauce, and fresh horseradish. We find cocktail sauce a great accompaniment to shrimp, but way too sweet for oysters, so we asked for some hot sauce (when we placed the order). The oysters came without the hot sauce and the horseradish so we had to remind our server, and he brought them out quickly. One of the oysters was \"funky,\" and no one wants to end up sick over a questionable oyster, so that one was left uneaten. We also enjoyed the soup du jour, which was a chilled asparagus soup. I've never had a cold asparagus soup before, and it was absolutely delicious. It was the embodiment of summer in a bowl.Our mains were steak frites, served with bernaise sauce, and the trout almandine (with the almonds on the side). Again, these were near-perfect. The trout was flaky and delicate, and had a light brown-butter sauce and some haricots verts. I'm not a huge fish lover and I gobbled this up. The steak was cooked perfectly, and it was marbled, so it had tons of flavor; the naughty bernaise sauce only added to it. I'm not a huge fan of their frites; they're too thin and crispy, almost shard-like. I prefer matchstick fries over these.Desserts are another area in which MAG excels. Years ago, they used to have a dessert I so loved called strawberries Briand, which was fresh strawberries in Grand Marnier, and sour cream sorbet, sprinkled with some brown sugar. Then they took it off the menu and I cried, so when I spied it back on the menu last night, I was overjoyed. It was even better than I remembered. Strawberries (from nearby Green City Market) in a pool of luscious juice, nicely offset by a tart, refreshing sorbet. And of course I can't not get profiteroles, and they allow you to just get one, instead of the three that typically come in an order.Prices are surprisingly reasonable as well. My trout was $17.95; I've paid more than that for fish at Dunlay's (which is a neighborhood place), and the steak wasn't priced much more than that.I also adore their patio, which overlooks beautiful Lincoln Park. On a summer evening, it doesn't get much better than sipping a cocktail or glass of wine, eating a delicious dinner, and watching people and dogs strolling by.This isn't quite a five-star review, but it's much closer to five than four. I just love this place; it never disappoints."], ["Lauren M.", "Went here for a birthday dinner last night. \u00a0If you're looking for a celebration dinner that's not too stuffy, you should go here.Escargot was good, although I don't have much to compare it to.Bread and butter tasted actually French.I had soup, husband had salad -- both were good but not outstanding.Entrees were excellent. \u00a0I had the \"Chicken Grandmere\" -- really really delish. \u00a0Better than just any old chicken. \u00a0Hubby had the steak/frites with Dijon -- delightful.I'd go here again, but if I were looking for French steak/frites, I might be more likely to choose Bavette's (yelp.com/biz/bavettes-ba\u2026)"]], "Le Bouchon": [["Jeff H.", "We recently ate at LeBouchon in Bucktown and loved it. \u00a0The atmosphere is wonderful...not too loud and with a lovely, low key bistro flair.We ordered the roasted duck for two with sauce bigarade. \u00a0It was by far the best duck either of us had ever had and the sauce was very rich, but not over bearing. \u00a0It came with farro and cider turnips \u00a0which were a nice contrast to the duck....ahh..!We also had the creme brulee. \u00a0I often make cb and it was very good and a nice cap to a wonderful meal. \u00a0Next time in Chicago, we're heading back."], ["Gregory S.", "My wife and I came here in February. \u00a0Phenomenal restaurant. \u00a0We got the mussels as an appetizer and the Cote de Boeuf for 2 as an entree, coupled with sides of pomme frites and green beans. \u00a0The beef was cooked perfectly, sauce was delicious. \u00a0The service was great, and our waitress was extremely knowledgeable about the wine selection and paired it perfectly with our food. \u00a0Can't wait to come back!"], ["Mina I.", "Food:The appetizers that we ordered were classic French bistro fare, moules marinieres (mussels in white wine with herbs) and escargots. For someone who had been craving simple French food, it was heaven. Plenty of fresh bread came alongside to sop up all the delicious sauces. The main courses that we had, though tasty, paled in comparison to the simple dishes that preceded them. I had a braised duck leg that was good, but it was served with too much sauce,and I thought that the presentation could have been better. My companion had rabbit, and pretty much had the same reaction. Over all, the main courses were well prepared, as well as a pleasant diversion from the ordinary (when was the last time you had rabbit?). The appetizers were spot on, we could have been in Paris.Drink:An ample wine list for a small neighborhood restaurant. The focus was most definitely French, as it should be, and both the glasses of white and red were great. You paid the premium for the French imports, but it definitely enhanced the overall experience.Service:There were only 2 waiters, and at least 15 tables, maybe more. That being said, they did a great job making sure we were taken care of. We had a reservation for 7:30, and were really hungry, so we showed up at 7 and wereseated immediately. As the night went on though, the place was definitely packed. It wasn't the sort place that you'd expected to be waited on hand and foot, and in turn, it wasn't. The tables are packed in pretty close together in asmall space, and you have to embrace the bistro atmosphere.Scene- If you want to be whisked away to a small bistro in (almost) Paris, than this is the place for you. The food is good, the service is ok, and the scene is cozy. Probably a great place for a third date where you want talk, drink and get to know one another. This is the sort of place, just outside of the hubbub of Wicker Park, to start the evening, but it won't be enough to make an entire evening.Dress:Casual, jeans with a nice shirt, a jacket would be fine.Occasion:Craving French bistro food and atmosphere? \u00a0This is the place for you. Start the evening here, and move on to more engaging venue south in Wicker Park.Cost:Appetizers $10, Entrees under $20.

We split a French Onion soup as our appetizer, which was delicious, and then ordered a very expensive 32 oz steak special along with a glass of red wine. The steak was good and the wine went well with it, but the steak was a bit undercooked and I didn't feel it was anything special.

Mmmm-mmmm.Three if us had the salad Lyonnaise and one had the goat cheese salad. Both were top notch. The egg was prepared perfectly to melt into the salad and provide a tasty addition to the dressing and lardons.BIL had the bouillabaisse, Hubby had a steak frites, and Sis and I had salmon.

We didn't plan on coming here but we somehow ended up here because it was the first restaurant we saw on a rainy day. I believe it's the \"1/2 off bottle of wine\" advertisement at the entrance that got us. I thought the interior was great! I felt as if I just stepped into a mini France! It was quaint and wonderful. The tables were small and limited so there was a wait for a table. Le Bouchon seems like a place where people don't just quickly eat and go. I think the intimate, cozy atmosphere encourages their customers to relax, dine and enjoy a fabulous evening out. My friends and I waited at the bar and was greeted by the bartender. We popped a bottle of exquisite wine to start off the birthday evening. We waited for awhile and the bartender encouraged us to dine at the bar because the tables weren't moving. My friends and I were getting hungry so we did and it was actually nice to receive such quick service at the bar. Also the bartender was very polite to make my friend's birthday evening special with a birthday drink and free goodies. I ordered the rabbit for the first time (Lapin Saut\u00e9 Chasseur \u00a0$19.50). I've never had a rabbit but the guy who sat next to me at the bar recommended it and told me tasted like chicken. It did. The rabbit was sauteed in a white wine sauce with vegetables. It was actually delicious but the meat was a little too chewy. My friend Sam had a lovely salad and mussels. I had a chance to try the mussels and I thought it had a nice flavor to it. The birthday girl had the free-range chicken which was great too. The entrees on the menu seem to be generally on the heavy side which is expected in many French cuisine but the food was very comforting, and every bite was satisfying. Overall, I think my friends and I enjoyed our time at Le Bouchon and hope to come to experience the intimate atmosphere, laid back staff, and the comforting food in the near future."], ["Josh K.", "I went with my ladyfriend on a normal weeknight and we pretty much had the place to ourselves.

The onion tart good, but not spectacular, the dough needed to be flakier. I had the bouillabaise and was extremely pleased. The broth was luxurious and rich and full of flavors like saffron and tomato and seafood. The fish were also cooked beautifully. My ladyfriend had a special, a blackened walleye if memory serves, it was so good it turned her from pretty much a vegan to a seafood is always a good thing.

My dining companion and I ate dinner early (6pm reservation) on a Sunday night. \u00a0I'll start by saying the service was very good - I have no complaints about that. \u00a0It was unrushed, very informative when asked to be, and very pleasant. \u00a0It seems to me that with Brindille, Carrie may be aiming for 2-Michelin-star status, and I think the service component of that is on the right track. \u00a0I think there's a little room for polish, but for the short length of time they've been open they're clearly doing the right things when it comes to service and I have no complaints at all about that.We started with the frog legs for him and for me the broccoli soup. \u00a0I loved the soup - I think the soups at Naha are awesome and I\"m glad to see that skillset made it here, too. \u00a0The frog legs were nicely pan-fried. \u00a0They came with a blanc-manger, which I guess they should be dipped in, because the legs themselves were only very lightly seasoned.For the main course, we had the monkfish tail and the guinea fowl. \u00a0My dining companion ate the monkfish tail and it was quite substantial, with a lot of good, meaty fish on the bones, and a lot of flavor with the vegetables that came with it. \u00a0I had the guinea fowl based on the waiter's recommendation and, to be honest, it was quite disappointing. \u00a0My biggest complaint was that it was on the cool side of room temperature. \u00a0It wasn't exactly cold, and it didn't really help that the A/C system was blowing cool air directly from the ceiling onto our table, but it wasn't what I'd consider to be an ideal eating temperature. \u00a0It also seemed like a bunch of unrelated items on a plate instead of a cohesive dish. \u00a0The monkfish had a lot of things, too, but they all interacted well together - that wasn't the case with the guinea fowl. \u00a0The cockcombs didn't seem to add anything. \u00a0The morels were overpowered by the cooking liquid and quite acidic and just sopping, squishy things - not the more firm, mushroomy ones I enjoy. \u00a0I would not order the guinea fowl again - for this level of dining it was, in my opinion, a disasterous dish. \u00a0I know they can do better, and I'm confident they will, but this dish, as served to me, was a terrible showing.Finally, for dessert we had the Paris-Brest of strawberries, and the roasted pineapple. \u00a0The strawberries were very nice - we both enjoyed those. \u00a0The pineapple was ok, although I guess I expected it to be roasted further than it was. \u00a0There weren't any of the complex caramel flavors I would expect seeing \"roasted\" in a description of a fruit dessert. \u00a0It was nice, it just didn't live up to what I would consider its full potential. \u00a0But, for all I know, that was the goal with the dish, to be lightly roasted and still have some of those fresh, brighter flavors pineapple brings to the table.All in all, I will almost certainly be back after a few months to see how things are progressing. \u00a0The guinea fowl was a real disappointment, there were a couple other things I think will improve with time, but overall I was satisfied with the meal. \u00a0My dining companion was not an experienced fine dining gourmand, and is always complaining he doesn't understand why people pay so much for fancy food. \u00a0But he managed to enjoy himself, which I think speaks to the fine service we received and that most of the dishes were well-executed."], ["Diana Z.", "Amazing meal in a beautiful space. \u00a0We started our evening with cocktails at their comfortable bar. \u00a0The gentleman behind the bar was friendly, knowledgeable, and helped my husband select the perfect aperitif (or two).Our dinner was outstanding, and the standout dishes were the steak tar tare, lobster entree and lamb entree.My only criticism, if you can even call it that, is that the waiter could have offered a bit more explanation of the dishes when our plates were served. \u00a0This was certainly one of the more expensive meals we've had in Chicago, but it's well worth the splurge for a special occasion. \u00a0My husband and I will be back :)"], ["Katherine H.", "So good!

Had a drink at the bar while waiting for my friends -- had a gin cocktail wth currant caviar, which was strong and delicious! Started dinner with the oysters -- these were beautiful, delicate, delicious. Would order again in a heartbeat! Ordered the crab and the duck for main course; this is where the problems started. It took a long (long!) time for the entrees to come out; when they finally came to us, my duck, while perfectly medium-rare, was cold. I really really don't like cold meat, and that hadn't been mentioned in the menu, so I asked if it was meant to be served cold. The answer was no, so I requested that it could be fixed and heated appropriately. What a shame, because it was so beautifully prepared. My friends ordered lobster -- that, while tasty, was also borderline cold, which led us to believe that these had possibly been prepared correctly and then sat out for a while. My duck was then returned to me -- now overcooked. :( They did ask me how it was; I didn't want to complain again so I said it was OK. (yes, yes I know I could have complained again, but there's only so much complaining one can do in a restaurant). I appreciate that not everything is always perfect, but at close to $40/entree they need to be able to execute and coordinate well. (without putting the onus on the diner to be the \"complainer\"; I am not sure how my request was presented to the kitchen, but any chef would think that what was sent back out to me the second time was overcooked.) To the server's credit, he did \"top off\" my wine since it was almost drained during all the waiting for the dish!

Food & drink service was very slow and it took us an hour just to get our bills after we had finished eating. The poor waitress was stressed out as hell and apparently the credit card machine broke. But what was the ridiculous part is that instead of informing of us they just kept us waiting. We knew there were a lot of us and if they had just said they were having issues, we could have figured out how to pay in cash or something. I could chop this all up to the \"we were a big group\" issue, but as we were waiting around for everything, we saw multiple small tables (groups of 2 and 4) get up and leave and at least a few people standing and looking around for waitstaff. They SEEMED to be well staffed for a quiet evening - the place was not even half full.

I've been served by mostly every server in this establishment. Lewis was my regular server, he was fantastic- disappointed he quit.

Drinking behind the bar- what restaurant lets their servers drink during the job? I would understand an after work drink but during, no wonder the service is bad. \u00a0Once my party arrived we were seated and that's when it all went downhill.

I've read all the reviews and there seems to be a common theme of BAD SERVICE. I see the owner/mgr comment, yet, BAD SERVICE is still an issue.

While it was tasty, I was still hungry and didn't feel it was worth $12.As with most restaurants in Chicago, the outside doesn't do the inside any favors.

The same plate came out with the same untoasted bread, cold eggs, but minus the potatoes (which were supposed to be included). After sending the plate back a second time, the manager came out and comped the entire meal, and provided a voucher to come back.

My father took a steak \u00a0 Frites and was mostly satisfied with the meat but the frites were extremely salted. My sister took a Croque Monsieur which totally dissatisfied her because the bread was not grilled as it needed due to it being stuffed and puffed with the Cheese or the B\u00e9chamel they put in.My mother took a Quiche du Jour which was quite nice except it was enormous- frankly I have never seeing anything like that- and the crust was overcooked.As for myself, I took the Tagine de L\u00e9gumes which greatly satisfied me. The taste was smooth and well put together an the plate was not as big as my family's. The entrees being big made us a bit disappointed because it doesn't show the true French cuisine.

We were seated immediately and brought our menus. The selection is nothing spectacular but had some unique things- the croque monsieur and a lamb sandwich as breakfast dishes which my girlfriend and I both shared. The croque monsieur was a fluffy french toast hamd and cheese sandwich. Very savory and the cheese used was quite sharp- tasty dish. My lamb sandwich included thinly sliced lamb piled on and had a good charred favor. It was definitely different and I appreciated the smokiness although I don't think I would ever get it again. What was disappointing was that it came with chips instead of french fries! Luckily my girlfriend was nice enough to share hers with me (they came with croque monsieur). My friends at the table got a mushroom crepe, a quiche, and french toast. All seemed very pleased with the meal. Afterwards we split a banana nutella crepe which was divine!

I love French bistros and this was one of the only ones open on Sunday, so we decided to come here. The restaurant itself is insanely quaint and feels just like the French countryside. The outdoor patio is beautiful and the wood floors and little nooks indoors are very charming. While it's not your traditional tile-floored bistro, it's a great atmosphere for any special occasion. As for food, we started with the brandade (salted cod fritters) and the escargot. This was probably my favorite part of the meal. The brandade were delicious and the escargot was as good as it gets. No complaints here. For my entree, I had the steak frites with hangar steak. The steak was cooked perfectly. Loved the thin and crispy frites, the herb sauce, and the bordelaise. However, the dish was on the salty side, and I have a pretty high salt threshold. I also tried the roasted squash entree which had a bitter taste to it, not sure if I could have eaten the whole plate. That said, the person who ordered it loved it so it could have just been that bite. For dessert, we had the profiteroles and their special apricot tart. The profiteroles were very good, though it's hard to mess up profiteroles. The apricot tart was tasty, but the puff pastry was just a little too soggy. It was sometimes hard to tell that there was a tart under the apricot, but other than that, it was tasty and not too sweet. Overall, this is a tough one for me in terms of star rating because I did enjoy this place. It was a very solid meal across the board, no major flaws. However, I would go elsewhere next time I'm looking for a French bistro.

For a person who has tried french food from all over Chicago, to Willmett and Barrington... The standards here are not great at all. Fried onion rings on a serving of chicken?!? Like who does that???.... The flavor was mostly salt and onion. french cuisine is suppose to be rich and flavorful with the use of herbs or other ingredients beyond just salt. Sadly they haven't been able to allow their menus to match the authentic French places like Michaels in Willmett, IL or Froggys French cafe in Highwood,IL...

We went here for my birthday with my parents and decided on the Wednesday prix fixe meal. Having had other prix fixe meals elsewhere I was expecting less, but in both quality and quantity Bistro Campagne delivered. The Poulet R\u00f4ti Foresti\u00e8re was cooked perfectly with a very nice mushroom cream sauce and my wife's Rushing Waters trout was nicely brown. Brandade de Morue en Croquette (cod fritters) were very tasty. My daughters hangear steak was cooked perfectly and the pomme frites were very good. The wine pairings were done very well, to the point where I was taking sips after every bite. Opt for the Pain Perdu at dessert and you won't be disappointed.My actual rating is 4.5 stars, the small mark is for the food being a little more of the American variant of French classics, versus the authentic preps that I was expecting. However, the quality and flavor were superb.This is a great place for a quiet night out, good for conversation, and relaxation. They've got a first-come first-serve patio as well. We will definitely return!"], ["Jimmy F.", "This place is yes.I have been there for brunch and for dinner, and have never been disappointed. The service is always gracious without being overwhelming, and the food is great. Their drink list is also very good -they even have V.E.P green Chartreuse, my favorite!While we go for dinner only on special occasions, their brunch is what I crave every weekend. I wish they offered it on Saturday! If you go for brunch and have a bit of a sweet tooth, try the crepes suzette. Honestly, even if you don't have a sweet tooth, give them a shot. They are very well executed, and the caramelized brandied oranges are delicious. The atmosphere is cozy, and fairly quiet, which I also love, and I hear that their patio is great, though I haven't had a chance to go in patio weather. I highly recommend this place."], ["Victoria R.", "I love this place. Everything here is amazing. The ambiance is perfect for a romantic dinner or and intimate night with friends. The service is also exceptional and knowledgeable. I would highly recommend this bistro."], ["Colton R.", "Very pleasant experience. The service was attentive without being annoying and our waiter was very kind and entertaining. The food was amazing. The restaurant itself is very quaint and romantic. I definitely plan on returning here the next time I'm in Chicago and I would highly recommend it."], ["Bart H.", "My wife and I have eaten at many of Chicago's finest restaurants and after celebrating our wedding anniversary as drop ins (no reservation) on a Saturday night when the restaurant was full, we now have a new favorite. The hostess seated us quickly when I told her it was our 45th wedding anniversary and she actually apologized for giving us a small table in what was the rear dining room of several. We have since been back twice and were lucky enough to get the same table each time. We loved each experience. The servers are knowledgeable, the wine list, although limited compared to Chicago's finest, is terrific and affordable. The food has been consistently excellent and the service all three times, has been very good. We look forward to more meals at this Chicago gem."], ["Chris M.", "Only went for brunch once. The blonde waitress was pretty bad and ignored us for virtually the entire meal unless we flagged her down as if my hair was on fire. I ordered the crabcakes and the cakes and poached eggs were cold by the time they arrived which was a considerable wait. Boyfriend had a hair in his food but did not want to make a big deal about it, so we just chalked this one up to a 'do not come back' unless there are no other options (in Lincoln Square that's not going to happen). Nice cozy space though."], ["Charlotte J.", "Wonderful! \u00a0Warm and inviting atmosphere. \u00a0Friendly and attentive service. I've have never been served anything that wasn't either very good or great... salmon, steak, liver, salads, sides, escargot, mussels, brunch, wines, cocktails...you name it. Each time I walk in I have high expectations and am never disappointed."], ["ashley r.", "Our visit was prompted by a school assignment for a French Course I am taking. My boyfriend stumbled across the menu online and figured because most of it was in French, it would be a good candidate for the authenticity my paper required. Lets start with how wonderful, Patrick, our server was. We told Patrick what prompted our visit and he truly delivered such great service by going out of his way to explain every little detail he knew about any \"authentic\" French dish. He even taught me a few things I didn't know which landed me a great piece to my paper. We ordered the Strudel \u00e0 l'Oignon Caram\u00e9lis\u00e9, Patrick said that was the most popular appetizer on the menu and we found out exactly why. Then, of course, we carried on to our main courses, which were also fantastic. Patrick also recommended his personal favorite for desert, which I loved! Overall, everything was great from start to finish. I must say, Patrick is a true asset to your country feel French cuisine, as he knew everything on the menu and offered such a personable and friendly experience.We'll be back for your brunch option very soon!"], ["Yvonne K.", "No words can express my love for this place. \u00a0I have been a guest since they opened. \u00a0Living in California now, I still go there when back in Chicago every chance I get.Service, ambiance and food all amazing, every single time."], ["Andrea H.", "My husband and I were looking for a quiet restaurant with great food, to celebrate our anniversary. \u00a0We found Bistro Campagne, and both the food and service were beyond our expectations. It is a delight to find a restaurant not far from our home that has the flavor of France. \u00a0The restaurant reminded us of a restaurant on the Left Bank of Paris where we also celebrated our anniversary years ago."], ["Sam D.", "Much of the time, after the first few bites of a wonderful dish, it will begin to lose it's initial splendor. But not here. Every single bite of my Croque Madame (yes, even this simple of a dish!) was incredible. \u00a0My companion ate the Almond French Toast and had the same experience. The atmosphere (inside and out) was lovely. We enjoyed a walk through Lincoln Square after our meal. It was a phenomenal experience all around. Highly recommend."], ["Krista R.", "Absolutely adorable restaurant. The food I sampled was average (fresh tuna salad), but the ambiance, service, and coffee were fantastic.Menu options that may get me back in the door: crepes, frites, cocktails, beef bourguignon, streak, duck, mussels. Trendy and hip, great for a small group or a date."], ["Jonathan L.", "It was very good and the service was friendly. \u00a0My only reasons for marking it down a bit were:1) The escargot and steak and frites were heavy on the garlic for my taste. \u00a0Yes, those are both garlic dishes but I thought they overdid it a bit.2) The service was a bit slow, especially for the restaurant being fairly light on customers while we were there. \u00a0(Admittedly, the restaurant may have adjusted staffing accordingly.) \u00a0That was not terrible and a leisurely meal is in the spirit of the restaurant. \u00a0However, the \"bottomless\" mussels special effectively was not because by the time the server came over for a possible refill, we had lost interest."], ["Brynn M.", "This restaurant has been recommended to me dozens of times over the five years that I have lived in Chicago, so my family and I decided it was time that we try it out.And I have to say, I was really disappointed. The waitstaff was relatively unfriendly, the food pretty bland (and I got the trout, which was the waitresses top recommendation) and the prices way too high for the experience.There are much better restaurants in Lincoln Square, in my opinion."], ["Stafford M.", "French factory. In and out in less than 70 minutes. Very friendly service. Beautiful ambience. My complaints - the speed and the food. The latter being rather crucial. The escargot is cooked in Pernot and the sauce is a corn starchy thick and has a strong alcohol flavor, rather than the clarified garlic butter it sound be. Although flavorful, the boef was very tough. It may have come directly from the refrigerator to the oven, without time to reach room temperature. Perhaps the most impressionable was the efficiency in which the tables were turned at $125 / hour."], ["Jack C.", "Simply great. Wine, escargots, steak tartare, fish, beef, lemon tart. The steak tartare starter was exceptional -- even better than I've had in Europe. Try to get a table next to a window. Nice place for a romantic evening."], ["Sarah C.", "I went in last night for my anniversary and was wonderfully happy with the entire experience. Walking in to such a warm, beautifully lit, cozy place was exactly what I was looking for. Our waitress was an absolute doll and made wonderful wine suggestions. We had all of our courses paired with a wine that was more delicious than the last. And the food - my my - something to write home about. I am so very happy this is the place I picked for such a special evening. If anyone at the Bistro is reading this, thank you very much for such a wonderful experience."], ["Petya Krasteva L.", "Not sure where to start. Beautiful and romantic summer garden. Restaurant itself has a romantic and classy look. It reminded me of a restaurant in downtown Chicago. Fell in love from the first visit. Service was good and the food was so delicious. I go there every time I can and can't even wait for summer time to experience dinning in the garden again."], ["Victoria W.", "This restaurant is very beautiful, with good service. However! I couldn't believe how bad the Gratin de Macaroni was. I'm a huge fan of fancy Mac & Cheeses, my current favorite being the one at Hot Chocolate, and I figured for $18 Bistro Campagne's would be a worthy competitor.It *looked* good, all crispy and slightly burnt on top, but it tasted ridiculously bland, and beneath the crust it was barely creamy at all. It was as if they'd tossed macaroni noodles in a little butter, put cheese on top, baked it and that's it. Maybe for a little $3 side dish to more flavorful food this would be okay, but for $18 I was really expecting something that was at least *delicious*, if not jaw-droppingly so.Also, they initially overcharged us $1 on the pommes frites. As in, the receipt said \"Pommes Frites -- $5,\" so the error was in their system. Not a big deal, but I had to wonder how many people had been paying the incorrect price before we mentioned it."], ["Dilaun W.", "Restaurant Week really put this bistro on my radar. It's a great spot in Lincoln Square just up the street from Old Town School of Folk Music not too far from the El. It was very lively on a Thursday night. Our server Lindsey was outstanding, very friendly, joked around with us. Every one on staff who came to our table was just really cool. We did 3 course meal. I would recommend every dish I had... caramelized onion & gruyere pastry, steak frittes and fig bread pudding. Cute French bistro with outside dining as well. Two thumbs up!"], ["Elina S.", "Came here for a special occasion on a weeknight and had a very nice time. I haven't been to too many french places in the city, and we heard quite a few good things about this place from friends so we knew we had to give it a try. It's very charming inside, simple tables with white table clothes give it an appealing elegance. Their patio is absolutely romantic and also charming, but make sure you come here when it's really warm out to enjoy it. It even has hanging lights, so definitely a pretty spot. We asked for a nice table inside as it was chilly out and they gave us a perfect table in a corner away from the crowd. It was dimly lit and cozy so you get very comfortable right away. It was a Tuesday night and when we came in most people had mussels on their table as it is a special I suppose, something to note for the future and they did smell yummy.We ordered the escargot to start. Let's just say I wasn't the biggest fan of it, but maybe it's just not my thing. We had it at Paris Club and I think they made it a little tastier because it was in a puff pastry where as Bistro's is more garlicy and authentic. Now I had no idea what to do for my entree and since there were no diets that day, I went with their burger coupled with onion frites and I'm soo glad that I did. It was one of the best burgers I've ever had (see attached pic). Wow, good quality beef with onion jam and brie cheese, absolutely delicious. It's also huge so I could only eat half of it, but I definitely recommend it. My hubby got the steak frites with the hanger steak as everyone recommended it with the french fries. I had a bite and he ate the entire thing so it is definitely tasty. But their onion string frites are amazing, better than the pommes frites so definitely get that if your dish doesn't come with it.By this point we were stuffed but how could we not get some dessert, it's me we're talking about here. We went with the creme brule and it was amazing, one of the best I've had, not overly sweet, and the top was the perfect caramelized crunch. They even gave us a candle with it, so that was sweet on their part. Our server was good and friendly and everything was brought out correct and timely. We were definitely impressed by it's non pretentious vibe in a good neighborhood. I'll have to do some other French places before coming back, but I'm happy we came here."], ["Kathy L.", "The food was good.I had the special cassole and escargot, and a salad. very filling. the service was just ok. Our waitress really only paid attention the the guys. The big thing was my feet were freezing! We were in the back room and there was a breeze on my legs the entire time. I know it was cold but this really made me uncomfortable. Be prepared for tight quarters too. Tables are very close to each other. The main room was probably ok but they have a table near the door and I think that had to be cold as well. I think it is better to come when the weather is not so much a factor. The food is very good though."], ["Rowena M.", "This place has been on my list for some time and boy, am I glad I finally had the opportunity to visit! \u00a0Lovely, romantic ambience immediately hits you as you approach the facade of this charming bistro. \u00a0While I know that one of the draws is their outside seating, I was ok with being seated inside and found it to be a very lovely experience. \u00a0We were greeted with a crusty, warm loaf of French bread with REAL butter! \u00a0For starters, we had escargot and a goat cheese salad. \u00a0I can bathe myself in that escargot sauce - rich and flavorful without being too overpowering and made a great accompaniment to that crusty bread! \u00a0Hubby ordered the pork chops which he stated as being in the top 3 of best pork chops he's ever had in his life. \u00a0I had to beg him not to gnaw on the bone like a content puppy! \u00a0As for me, I was hesitant to order such an ordinary dish like the Amish chicken but there was nothing ordinary about the dish as it was prepared perfectly - tender, flavorful and made even more sinful with the mushroom sauce and onion frites on top! \u00a0Because we are gluttons, we also ordered a side of mac n'cheese and mushrooms and yes, you guessed it - those were sinfully delectable, as well. \u00a0Even the dessert was amazing; we ordered the seasonal special which was pumpkin panna cotta served with a side of pumpkin spice bread - tr\u00e8s magnifique! \u00a0I am getting hungry just thinking about this place and cannot wait to return!"], ["J M.", "My husband took us here for date night one day, and it still remains to be one of our most memorable.

All of the waitstaff in La Creperie were young which made me skeptical of their knowledge of the menu (sorry for marginalizing young servers...I once was one too) however they totally exceeded my expectations and were on point! Of course, I had to order a French red to start off my dinner, and I followed it up with their hot leek soup. The soup was absolutely refreshing, creamy, and delicious! Next, I went with the vegetarian crepe and the mix of cheeses which was my best decision of the week :-) The environment, food, and staff were all a treat. We had a great dinner here, and I look forward to recommending this place to my friends in the Lakeview area.

I should have stuck with my go to chicken, goat cheese and tomato crepe, because this one wasn't to my liking. I still cleaned my plate because I walked 3.5 miles to get here and I was starving, but it was way too heavy on the cream. I wanted more chicken and more mushrooms. The mushrooms are simply spooned on top rather than in the sauce, which might have taken away from the creaminess and been a better meal overall. We shared a banana sara crepe in the end, because I am no longer as gluttonous as I used to be in my younger days and didn't want a dessert one just for myself. My waistline can't recover from such indulgences anymore. It was delicious and redeemed the restaurant.

When combined, they balanced each other out pretty well, as the La Noix de Coco was just too sweet to eat on its own. I will definitely come back to try the other things on the menu, such as the Escargot, perhaps other crepes as well. The look and feel of La Creperie was utterly French - very cozy and romantic.

Come to find out, this place is HUGE! There is the front dining area next to the bar, the back dining area, and then a great patio! It was like the never ending building. Of course, the back patio was full on such a pretty day and my skepticism was put to rest. We were both tired that morning, so we opted out of booze and went for their cappuccino and we were not disappointed. \u00a0We did see other people get drinks and I really want to go back just to try them.
