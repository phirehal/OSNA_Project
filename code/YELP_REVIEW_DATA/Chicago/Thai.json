The noodles seem deep friend instead of pan fried which has happened a couple of places in Chicago. I had never had it actually deep fried anywhere else but Chicago. Not sure if that is normal.

It wasn't overly sweet, which is usually my biggest complaint. it was delicious and perfectly seasoned.

When the plate came out, it was the smallest portion I have ever had at a Thai restaurant. Usually, I get such big portions - I have enough to take home for a second meal. This was the first time I actually finished all of my meal at the restaurant. On top of that, the Pad Si Ew was not that different than any other place. I liked that they use Chinese broccoli. The grease from the plate upset my stomach for the rest of the day. I don't know if it's just me, but I used to love Thai, but everywhere I go, it all seems too greasy for me. Maybe \u00a0a non-greasy Thai place is non-existent!Overall, I would not go back because the food was average and the portions are very small.

That's how I left this place.It's BYOB, the pricing is very reasonable and the food...phenomenal.Let's start with my only real negative and then we can get into the nitty gritty. The satay was just ok. It has that same over flattened quality that you find in lesser Thai places and the flavors are not that pronounced, also.. there are only four of them on the plate. Peanut sauce is very good and the Cucumber salad was pretty good, certainly presented beautifully. Montri Thai in Warrenville, Banana Leaf in Dallas and the stalls in Singapore all have much superior Satay.We tried a second appetizer just for fun (we had been bike riding all day along the beach and we were seriously hungry) The Spring rolls with peanut sauce. These were excellent and different than others that we've had. What was cool is that they were cut into smaller pieces and easy to manage.. we ate them throughout the meal and they really seemed to compliment everything.So, we got kind of carried away with noodles.. in fact we accidentally ordered ALL noodle dishes... here's what happened:We ordered Pad See Ew with beef (we always do, it's a staple) it was excellent! Just enough of that slight tangy sweetness and crisp veggies....really, really good. As good as any of our other favorite places.We ordered Panang Curry with Chicken (we order this everywhere.. it's one of the ways we judge our Thai places) \u00a0so... normally we would get rice.. and I looked at my wife and said \"wait a minute\" a Yelp reviewer said \"don't think about it, just get the Panang Curry with noodles\" So we did. It was awesome. We asked for it very hot and it was pleasantly spicy (we have a very high tolerance for spice) I highly recommend this dish although next time we will get it with rice.. just to break things up. They put the appropriate veggies in the curry (bell peppers are the ONLY appropriate veggies in Panang curry) Did I mention that it was delightful?Then came the third option.. This is where we usually experiment.. sometimes it's Pad Thai.. or sea food or whatever looks good.. this time we got the Crispy Pad Thai with Pork. OMG, what a delicious surprise! I took my life into my own hands when I reached for an extra taste of this.. my wife had chopsticks and she knows how to use them. Traditional Thai decor, not fancy and only one small bathroom. Very polite service. The food presentations are beautiful.If we lived closer.. we would be here all of the time.We are soooo going back here. Our bill was around $44.00 and we took home a few leftovers and fortunately for me, Lisa left the dangerous chopsticks at the restaurant."], ["Shahzad S.", "I really liked their beef fried rice for the beef noodle dish and the appetizers they really had a good taste to them and they were quite spicy which is awesome"], ["Juan A.", "I Was Looking for pad thai and a Royal thai far exceeded my expectations!

If there is a Thai word for gringo, I'm sure they're muttering it under their breath at me at the aforementioned places. This is not the case at Royal Thai. The food is full of flavor, and if you request it spicy, you won't be disappointed. I've probably tried each curry dish here, and the seafood ones are special standouts. Red Curry with Talapia and the Green Curry with catfish are the true gems of their menu. What the staff lacks in timeliness, they make up with personality. The waitress is pretty hilarious. I asked her about the dinner-plate sized goldfish swimming on the back wall. She said it was convenient to have them nearby in case the kitchen runs out of fish. The wait staff other Thai places should take a hint from her. Lighten up and crack a smile every now and then. There are only two factors preventing this place from earning five stars. 1. Some times they can bring members of your group their meals considerably longer after one person in the group has been served. That's a bit weird. 2. They don't accept AMEX."], ["Dallas M.", "The food here is delicious! My favorite is the masuman curry.
