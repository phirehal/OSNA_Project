{"Friends Sushi": [["Marilynn P.", "Shereene M and I checked out Friends one cold Chicago night and her review pretty much covered it. I give it 5 stars because I thought the sushi menu was innovative. I've been to several sushi restaurants and I felt the ingredient combinations of their rolls are VERY unique. The only thing we ordered that I did not like were the soft shell crab buns. But the sushi and the shrimp chips app was bomb. See ya soon, Friends!"], ["Julia K.", "Truly disappointed. It's been difficult to find fresh, quality sushi in Chicago. We came here for Halloween dinner since we wanted something light and fresh. I ordered the chirashi since that is a good indication of how fresh the various fish is. Texture of the fish was rough and was not fresh. Only one of the yellowtail pieces was buttery and delicious but that is one out of about 15 pieces of fish. My friend got two rolls and was also disappointed. Considering that my meal was over $30 for poor quality fish, I would not recommend this place. Ambiance was dark, loud, and the furniture was weirdly shaped. It's a hip place but not a romantic Japanese meal I was looking for."], ["Kulsum J.", "Cute place. Sushi is pretty good. My fav was the tiger eyes. Their peach flavored jelly saki was good when chilled. However, did not like that my calamari was never served to me because the waiter brought it to the wrong table. They didn't even acknowledge the mistake until I mentioned I never received the calamari.If you're looking for a moderate style sushi experience. This is the place."], ["Saba A.", "What a nice hidden gem off of Rush! And what great prices and food too. So glad I came in here at 6:15 with a girl friend. Best time to come will probably be before 7 regardless on the size of your group! They don't take reservations. It's been awhile since I have seen a creative sushi menu. The place is intimate with dim lighting, white seats all around. Many people were in 'after work groups' or on a 'first date' to a small gathering of friends. I started off with some hot green tea (the flavor was very light) but that's okay because it was less than 3 dollars. I also had chicken soup and my friend had miso soup. Both soups were not salty, filled with great broth flavor, and my chicken soup was shredded, breakable, and there was tons of chicken in there! For 6 dollars it was a perfect way to start. I wasn't watching my calories so I ordered a creamy spicy tuna roll. Yes, it was spicy - and that's exactly how I wanted it. They didn't binge on any of the ingredients. Nicely cooked rice, a flavored mayo sauce, a good amount of tuna filling and lots of it. I was impressed. For 10 dollars, you will get your fill. So choose what sushi you want wisely! Service was great. Quiet, quick, and friendly. Will come back."], ["Elizabeth T.", "I'm a sushi roll lover so I couldn't leave my visit to Chicago without trying a place. My friend settled on this one from reading reviews. The place is small but cute and stylish. The seats were surprisingly comfortable and almost felt like you were at a modern home.We started with some waters. I really feel like water should always come with lemon! Takes away the tap watery flavor and the water here definitely had that taste. We reviewed the menu over and over trying to finalize our choices and landed on three: Fire Wing roll to start with. It sounded great on the menu but it was so basic--not worth the price. I wouldn't get it again. Lacked combination of flavors that I look for in a roll. Big Friends was next. This one was very delicious. Had a great combination of flavors and texture. I would get this one again and highly recommend to others. Can You Handle It? was our final roll we shared. I love spicy food and this was a spicy roll. I liked it but not too much. I would say if someone sounds intrigued by it from reading it on the menu then you should try it. If i come here again I probably wouldn't get it again. There were other rolls that I would try if I could fit more down my belly. I noticed that a lot of rolls included cream cheese which I'm not keen on much of that. The service was interesting, I couldn't really understand the girl that was serving us. I wanted to ask questions but that wouldn't have gone smoothly. It seems fairly popular as it started to fill up on a Tuesday evening after people were getting off work. Also the weather was perfect on this day!"], ["Zewditu D.", "What an interesting place. I was recently in Chicago for a conference and my boss suggested this spot for dinner. Since I wanted something light, this was a perfect choice. It was a quick walk from our hotel. But we had to look around quite a bit to find the restaurant once we found the corner provided in our directions. You walk up a few steps and enter the restaurant. So crowded! Man they pack you in there like sardines. I was seated in the aisle and it sucked having to watch out everytime someone was walking by. The tables were so small, as well. I didn't like the atmosphere at all to be honest.We ordered edamame to share. Very good. I also ordered aspargus beef roll. Mmmmm. I am not a frequent sushi eater, but I am getting used to it more and more. This was an excellent choice for me. Our waitress recommended this over the bun since she said the buns were quite small. The price was affordable and would definitely visit again given this and the great execution."], ["Morgan F.", "Our last night in Chicago with nine girls, and we were looking for something on the healthy side near our hotel for our last meal.This isn't necessarily a spot you can make reservations and arrive early to enjoy a drink at the bar, especially not for a gaggle of hungry girls. Our table wasn't quite ready yet when we got there a little early but they appeased a handful of the girls with edamame. It has this almost retro-futuristic Star Trek, I could be on the inside of a boat OR a spaceship feel with nice comfy white chairs. Our waiter was very sweet, and we did our best not to be \"those girls\" and pooled our requests together so only one person was spouting off the order which was about 10 or so rolls, a handful of appetizers, and dishes. One thing I think that would benefit this place is the paper sheet menu that they do in other sushi restaurants to tic off your order, but maybe that's just not their bag. Thank you to my fellow Yelpers for the photos of some of the great sushi rolls to help us make our choices. Top rolls were the Friends Roll and Devil's Tuna but I think they did a great job with your usual rolls like the Rainbow roll, and have two options for spicy tuna rolls, creamy and crunchy, which I like! For ordering that much it came out in a timely manner, and we were all able to fill up. I did think the Yuzu Ceviche was a little small for the price, but had some of the girls that wanted to order it anyway. Not much for sharing for more than two people, just an FYI! Our bill was around $50 per girl for apps, food, and drinks. I would say Friends Sushi is great for a few friends, but you're pushing it when you get past 6 hangry girls since they are a smaller space!"], ["Natalie M.", "Very meh.Disappointed but really nice place. The decor is pretty nice. I got the octopus sushi and a yellowtail sushi that contained some cilantro in it. They were both just okay but nothing spectacular. The service was great but I wouldn't want to come back here again...nothing amazed me. It tasted fresh enough but the octopus was chewier than I would have liked."], ["Somchai S.", "Nice modern decor.Great location.Intimate seating.Reasonably priced rolls for being steps from Mag Mile."], ["Shereene M.", "What an interesting place. When you walk in it totally looks different from what you expect. We came in around 5:30 on a weeknight and we were able to get seated right away. The service is really great and the food came out quick so we were a fan. We found some free (I think!) parking on Rush down the street, otherwise you can probably make it work within the $4 1 hr meter. What we had:Shrimp chips app- delish!Soft shell crab buns- meh, I'd skip itFriends roll- yum! my favCrazy winter roll- good as wellJazz Roll- very good!"], ["Eddie C.", "Overall: Mediocre sushi fare for high Chicago prices. Ordered a roll that was a little too sweet...Food: I got the Mad Maki and the Triple, which I shared with my girlfriend. The Mad Maki was weird... It came with like 8 pieces and was drenched in eel sauce and spicy mayo. Like the roll was soaked in a puddle of the sauce on the plate. It also had a weird sweet flavor, almost to the same tune of candy. The Triple was a lot more normal but wasn't too satisfying.Friends Sushi is a weird place. It was packed outside with people waiting on the Sunday night that I went but they seated us immediately. The interior is like a futuristic space bar.. I was nervous that the fish would taste like freeze dried space food. Instead, one of the rolls came out to be soaked in sauce. I felt my blood sugar rise after eating a few pieces. I basically ordered sticky rice with candied eel sauce for 15 dollars.Maybe the other rolls are better here but Friends Sushi was definitely underwhelming."], ["Vyvy T.", "We came here with last minute reservations prior to our comedy show. We wanted somewhere close, but casual and this place was it! Almost everything here is white; the walls, furniture, and sushi bar. Gives an illusion of a larger space because it's in a narrow building. Cute space overall. Restroom includes a TV. What was playing on it? Some spooky ghost show. There was a large mirror in that restroom. Definitely not a great combination. :P (I kid) My companions and I ordered spicy tuna rolls, chirashi bowls, and a couple of nigiris. Chirashi bowls come with miso soup in a large mug. Their chirashi \"bowls\" are huge here! The only difference between the small and large chirashi bowl is sashimi count. The large has three more. Both came in a platter with sashimi placed in rosettes. Though the sushi was fresh and I wanted to love it, but it was A-OK for me. This would be a great place to quickly satisfy sushi cravings. Service is fine. Better for small parties. Parties four or more, be prepared to feel cramped."], ["Emily J.", "I had heard about Friends Sushi from multiple friends and when I moved within walking distance I knew that I had to try it! I would recommend to get reservations if you can as the restaurant is very small and always very busy. Service was excellent-both efficient and courteous. My friend and I share a few rolls and I think the rainbow was my favorite-everything was really fresh and flavorful. This is not the quality of sushi you will get somewhere like Sunda but it's still delicious and honestly a bargain for the amount of food you end up getting! Would certainly recommend and I love that the crowd is pretty much 100% local too, so hard to find so close to Michigan Ave."], ["Amy N.", "What a little hole in the wall! I did not expect this place to be as good as it was! The outside is definitely deceiving. The hostess and the waitresses were so sweet to us. We started off with the seaweed salad $5. Really tasty and refreshing. I also ordered the Unagi with cucumber. The texture and taste was on point. Unagi was rich and buttery.We also got the Deluxe Sashimi Combo ( comes with Miso soup). OH SO GOOD AND WORTH IT. The pieces of sashimi were fresh, perfect size and the quality was kind of amazing. So yummy I would definitely come back."], ["Keisha F.", "I am from out of town, I ate here a few years ago and absolutely loved it. Came back recently and it is still as good as I remembered. Everything from the miso soup to the Friends Sushi roll. Delicious and nice atmosphere!"], ["Troy C.", "The good: Service was prompt but there weren't many people thereFood was not bad and the menu selection was also decentPrices were not bad either and good selection on the lunch specials. The not so good:Nothing really bad but if I had to say anything it'd be to change the decor. The seating seemed very dated. I'd eat here again if I was in the area."], ["Maggie H.", "The decor is very old futuristic - lots of white, bubbly looking things like you're in the Jetsons or the 5th Element. I think it has the same owners as the Thai restaurant at the same address (the employees are all Thai.) /Coming from LA and being a sushi snob, I didn't dare try the raw fish here just based on the look and setup of the restaurant, and went with the oyakadon (chick and egg bowl!). It was not the most authentic, and the rice was on the soggy side, but it hit the spot and I left satisfied.Given that you're in the heart of Chicago, I would say skip this place and keep looking for your authentic Japanese fix.If you're not picky though and just want something quick for lunch, this is an okay option."], ["Lisa G.", "Once again, popped into this place on a whim ( actually was so hungry didnt even yelp it). \u00a0The place was a little dated, with it's white decor. Had the Gyoza as an appetizer, very tastey. Liked them alot. Sushi, had the Fire wing Roll. \u00a0It was good. Nothing out of this world but nothing to complain about either. Waitress was real sweet."], ["Shirley J.", "Upon arrival on a hot Saturday night, I sat on their bench waiting to be seated and fanned myself vigorously with a Whole Foods coupon booklet that I snatched up on the way to Friends Sushi. Why, oh, why didn't Friends Sushi have A/C??? I sat there feeling like I was going through a menopause hot flash. I stopped by the restroom before being seated, which to my surprise actually had A/C. A/C in the restroom but not the rest of the restaurant? *Palm to face*Anyways, we opted to sit in the outdoor dining area. It was cute and small. I do want to mention that two homeless guys came up to our table separately while we were dining, AND a mosquito managed to have a buffet on my leg, which resulted in a bite the size of TWO quarters.We ordered the following items:- Scallop butteryaki (appetizer)- Salmon nigiri- Yellowtail nigiri- Sea bass nigiri- Can You Handle It signature roll- Spicy tuna roll- Some sort of sweet sakeAll of the sushi and the appetizer were pretty good and fresh. My favorite one is the Can You Handle It roll.The service was okay. It took foreverrrrr to get our food. Fortunately, we were lost in conversation to not care too much. Our waitress was nice, and the employees were pretty good with refilling my water though.This isn't the best sushi restaurant in Chicago, but it's worth a try."], ["Rachel W.", "Having been here multiple times, it's unfortunate that each time the experience has worsened. The quality of the sushi seems to have decreased. The maki rolls we got were overdressed with sauces which might have been an attempt to mask the poor quality of fish. The past times that I've been here, the food has been much better. On the bright side, this was the first time that I didn't have to wait for seating."]], "Yuzu Sushi & Robata Grill": [["Norm J.", "Food = 4 starsService = 2 starsOverall = 3 starsWhen I made the Valentine's Day reservation at Yuzu Sushi & Robata Grill I was told (1) they were offering a special 7 course menu and if I selected to do that option right there on the spot I'd get a 10% discount and (2) that with a 7pm reservation we would need to be out of there by 8:30pm. I was fine with this and confirmed we'd do the menu and be up and outta there at the specified time.Arriving at our reserved time we had to wait 19 minutes to be seated and all I could think about was that 8:30pm deadline. After being seated in a tight space up against the kitchen counter area we waited a good 7-10 minutes before our waitress came to ask if we wanted anything to drink and to explain the menu. Since the place was packed I didn't give her my East Coast attitude like I normally would when the service starts off at a 2 out of 10.After placing the order for the first 4 courses I felt like Ben Affleck in Gone Girl when it came to tracking down our waitress to (a) ask where our food was and (b) place the order for our remaining 3 courses because she just disappeared on us. When our food started coming out it was in such a random order (i.e the 4th course came out before the 1st course). By this time it was about 7:45pm, we only had 2 of our 4 courses and we still needed to order 3 more. By 8pm we'd received our other 2 courses and was finally able to place the ordered for our remaining 3 courses. Thankfully my Valentine was/is awesome so i didn't mind the crazy wait, that much. When course 5 (order of 5 rolls) and 6 (sushi a la carte) came out it was almost 8:20pm so I knew we'd no way/how/chance be up and out by that \"deadline\" I was given when I made the reservations. I sent a silent I'm sorry to the group of 14-16 people huddled near the door waiting to be seated because I knew two of those people were suppose to be getting seated at my table in 10 minutes. In the end we didn't get outta there until about 9:10pm after finishing course 5,6 and 7 which was the dessert.All and all I think the food was really good, but the wait time to actually get the food was terrible. Also, the service gets two thumbs down! I know it was Valentine's Day and they were packed, BUT poor planning on their part doesn't require kind words from this reviewer. Next time they want to offer a 7 course special they should hire more kitchen and wait staff.

Still my gargantuan Robata insight was ill prepared for the schooling yuzu gave us. The eggplant Robata was really as good as a plant could ever taste. Maybe if the place were just a little darker I would have believed it was meat. The meat skewers were easy on the eyes, juicy, and had great personalities. Don't tell pork and chicken but I think beef was just too enticing to pass up a second date with. You can't go to a Japanese joint without ordering at least a little sushi, I'm pretty sure it's a misdemeanor in most states actually. So not wanting to spend the night in jail, we got a roll to sample. The fish was super fresh, like it was probably alive a day or two ago fresh. I'm pretty sure the only way you could really have something fresher is to take a bite out of a live tuna but then people might start calling you \"inhumane\", \"murderer\", or \"an insidious creature attempting to conceal itself within the vain appendages of the human skin\". Whatever. All meaningless words that my psychologist throws around a lot for some reason.If I were some super peppy and cliche yelper who didn't understand that 3 exclamation marks per paragraph is too many I might say something along the lines of \"holy mackerel! The mackerel nigiri is to die for! It is a must!\". I'm not and I will not subject you to excited Babel. The nigiri was really damn fishy in taste but me so much in aroma. It was fishy enough to taste a little like the ocean and iron but not enough to be abrasive. The nigiri was like a girl who knows to show a tasteful but still alluring amount of skin.

It's a Monday night and there were 6 of us that arrived at 7pm with no reservation. The wait was a little over 45 mins but it's our fault for not making a reservation. During our wait, we saw that everyone was enjoying their BYOB. The interior design is pretty \"rustic\"? (Or didn't bother fixing up the ceiling?) and the lights above us didn't turn on? Haha but it's all good. The ambiance was chill and music was good. Perfect for a group of friends. Just be sure to make a reservation if you have a group of 4+. Food was good (I am not a foodie), we ordered their avocado mango salad, fried pork belly salad, and pork Katsu? We ordered 5 rolls ... They all taste the same to me.

Everything we ordered was grade A. I'm convinced you can't go wrong with anything you order.

It is bar none the best sushi for your buck in Chicago. I always leave with a smile on my face, a full belly, and drunk (I guess to be fair, I leave most BYOB places drunk).Whatever you do must start with some grilled stuff on sticks. My favorites are the rib eye, bacon wrapped asparagus, and bacon wrapped scallops. You can find grilled stick stuff at a few other Japanese restaurants in the city but they won't be nearly as good as Yuzu's. Their rolls and few sushi have never disappointed. Massive rolls and beautifully cut fish. My favorite rolls are the Pot River and Black Sea. Service wise, they are usually understaffed compared to their size but I've never felt unattended. They portion out food perfectly and offer buckets of ice for BOYB beverages. I've bought lots of friends here and they have all ended up going back because of how good Yuzu is. I've also brought large parties here and they take reservations.Bring some Japanese whiskey. It's the best thing to blackout with over raw salmon."], ["Heather F.", "Very cool environment. The staff is super friendly. Their sushi is good! My favorite part is select sushi rolls, they do a painting with all different sauces on the cutting board.

Dump your dining buddies who you know always show up late. Service was great in my experience, but they run a tight ship and turn over tables quickly. This efficiency might rub some people the wrong way but I understand the reasoning behind it.The rolls are larger than your average bear so one per a person is more than enough if you're also ordering a few starter dishes. We definitely over ordered calculating 3 rolls per a couple.The interior of the restaurant is hip, but not overdone.

There is no room left for coats and bags. Coat hangers can be found in the back but bags will have to sit on the floor or have it uncomfortably rest on your legs throughout the meal. For two, we shared the sashimi gold, grilled lamb, asparagus and bacon, eggplants, pork shoulder, and monster spider roll. The sashimi gold came in a beautifully assorted platter of 12 pieces of raw fish per the chef's selection. It was fresh and generous. Of what I can recall, it came with salmon, tuna, octopus, and yellowtail. The grilled lamb was smothered in a mint leaf sauce. I wished the lamb flavor itself was stronger. The pork shoulder was flavorful but the meat was not tender enough. I enjoyed the eggplants and asparagus skewers the most. The monster spider roll came in five pieces. Judging by the menu description, it probably had the least amount of sauce if that is also what you're looking for. Service was quick and I especially enjoyed how they would take note of when you finish a certain dish before bringing out the rest.

I called in for reservations and the gentleman on the phone said instead of a 7 o'clock he had a 9 oclock. Well to late for me but then he quickly said, well I have a 6:30 opening but need the table back at 7:30. An hour for sushi, plenty of time. Glad took the reservation and quickly jumped in the car to head south. I live in North center sk new it would be a drive to get there. I got there on the dot at 6:30. Nows where they earned their 5 stars. See my wife asked if we could be seated and the guy asked for the info and then stated \"oh I am sorry your table was given away. We notified you about it through text\". Now I know a lot of restaurants like this new technology yet they must understand not everyone is aware they use it and it was not told to me. I never check my phone while driving, if you didn't know it illegal and unsafe. Now my wife said it's ok, we will just go some where else. I turned and started to walk away as it seemed the guy didn't care. Thought about it for 2 seconds and thought no! No way this is not my mistake. I know they said 6:30 and I was here. I spoke with the guy at the check in and he seemed really not to care (seemed). I requested in talk to a manager as o know what i was told regardless of what some text was after I was finished making the reservation. Clearly I was no aware that's how they confirmed things. After some what going back and forth with him I requested to speak with a manager. The manager comes over and I update her with what has happened. Told her I am not hear to ramble on about what happened but would like it fixed. I know they said 6:30 and that it is ridiculous to think they would make me aware of needing the table back after an hour and half. I know as I have been a restaurant manager for years. I also stated you should have the person make new people aware, I am gonna send you a text confirming your reservation so please confirm your information. All in all she quickly handled the situation politely and got us a table right away. Food was amazing, service was great, can't say enough about presentation. Though I will say this; being from LA I have high standards of sushi. Chicago places usually tend to be over priced for minimal portions. This place is nothjng like that. Though they aren't the cheapest, they are by far one of the best places I have been. If you haven't gone, I urge you to definitely check it out. You will not be disappointed.

They happily took us in even though we didn't have reservation, however I do highly recommend you make a reservation before since they were extremely busy. The ambience inside was definitely catering to a much younger crowd with the rnb and hip hop music playing in the background.As mentioned in the previous reviews the sushi and robata were excellent. The skewers were definitely a must have and compliment to any other item. The sushi was some of the best and freshest I've had in Chicago since they have some very creative roles. Service was excellent however I do have to mention it was at times too dark to see the menu but other than that this place is a must try"], ["Carolyn I.", "I went for lunch on the first day at their new location. \u00a0There were a few problems with service, but I didn't mind since I knew they had just relocated. \u00a0Food:I was really craving poke and looked around for restaurants that had it. \u00a0The tuna poke did not disappoint. \u00a0It consisted of Hawaiian tuna, avocado, green and white onions, Japanese chili pepper, soy sauce and sesame oil. \u00a0It was delicious and the presentation was beautiful. \u00a0Another appetizer I got was the tempura soft shelled crab. \u00a0It was crispy and I loved the dipping sauce that came with it. \u00a0I ordered the beef short rib, pork shoulder and shishito peppers (Japanese sweet peppers) from the robata grill. \u00a0The meat was so tender and flavorful. \u00a0I ordered the Japanese eggplant, but they didn't have any so I ordered the shishito peppers instead. \u00a0It was my first time eating shishito peppers and I really enjoyed eating them!I also got the unagi roll - fresh water eel, cucumber and sweet soy sauce. \u00a0It was good, but my least favorite out of everything else I ate. \u00a0I think it needed more sauce.Overall, I think Yuzu has great Japanese food. \u00a0I will definitely be back!"], ["Laura F.", "LOVE the bento box lunch deal. Love eating sushi at lunch. Perfect mid-day pick me up. I'm down for sushi anytime but especially randomly on a weekday afternoon when you've been sitting at your desk all day muttering expletives about your boss. Love the cups and cutlery and plates. Love how heavy the chairs are. Cute interior. The only bad thing is that on the Maki bento box, it comes with one spicy tuna roll and one \"chef's choice\" roll. They sometimes bring out two spicy rolls which taste very similarly. Its spicy overload. I enjoy it more when they balance the two rolls!"], ["Sunny H.", "If you're an anime fan, you're going to love the decorations here!Recently moved into the wicker park area and been dying to try this place out after reading the reviews. They have a spicy miso soup that I could drink all day. a Serious highlight of dinner for me, my wife even tried to steal it!All the sushi was good as well. The only thing I did not like about the sushi was the SIZE... holy crap, some of their rolls were so big that they were hard to eat. Tasty food... just tone down the size of your rolls. I'll be back for sure regardless!"], ["Catherine P.", "Yuzu used to be my secret spot, but I have a feeling others have discovered this gem as well. Packed to the gills every weekend, Yuzu finally expanded into a sleek, larger spot that still maintains the Yuzu vibe I loved from the former location. 90s hip hop, stemless glassware, and casually clad servers help to create a unique experience. What to order: first things first... The avocado and mango salad is not to be missed. Generous slices of fruit pair nicely with a spicy, creamy dressing topped with crunchy noodles. The grilled octopus and agedashi tofu are stand outs as well. From the robota grill, I always order a few skewers of pork belly and filet. All I can say is wow. Now for the aspect that sets Yuzu apart from the rest... The sushi. Incredibly fresh, thick cuts of salmon and white tuna sashimi always kick off the second portion of my meal here. The rolls are presented with elaborate sauce art alongside robust, larger than normal maki rolls. See photos below for proof. Yuzu is Byob, casual enough to pop in on a Sunday in your yoga pants, but also vibrant enough for a date or birthday dinner. Beware of wait times... So make a reservation! Dinner for two runs about 70$, but you will leave full and satisfied, with a perfect Instagram shot of your dinner."], ["Tracey S.", "I've been a loyal customer of Yuzu since the first week they opened. My friends actually joke about how often I go there. Unfortunately, I will no longer go back. The food is excellent, but the customer service has simply gone downhill - WAY downhill - over the past several months. From reservation issues, to delivery order issues, to service in the restaurant. I love that they've grown and are so popular, but their service across the board has suffered. I actually spoke with the manager to tell her my experience and it was like I spoke to a blank wall. So disappointing. The two stars is because the food is so good. Otherwise, it would have been one. Chicago is an amazing town with a ton of great restaurants - and many, many great sushi restaurants. Good food simply isn't enough."], ["Bear D.", "Went there for my sons birthday and he we were expecting more. \u00a0Lots of flys kept landing on me as well as others so that I couldn't pay attention to the food as I was too busy trying to swat them away. \u00a0Service was good, hence the 3 stars. \u00a0The food was average but not worth the trip out to the city. \u00a0This restaurant was highly ranked but I fail to see why. \u00a0It's a nice neighborhood joint but not above average. \u00a0We ended up going to another restaurant to try to impress our 11 year old. \u00a0To be fair, I may have had too high of expectations and the flys bugged me."], ["Hayley Z.", "My favorite sushi in Chicago. Everything is amazing but the Tuna Poke is absolutely unbelievable and melts in your mouth. Oh, and the Born to Chill roll. You MUST get this roll.Their service is nothing special but the food more than makes up for it. And they just recently moved to a bigger space so it's a bit easier to get a table on a weekend night. If you're looking for BYOB with average prices and above-average sushi then this is it. Yuzu will change your life."], ["Mala S.", "This place is amazing! Great service and wonderful food. I love the Anime decor on the walls and on the restroom doors. When our food arrived, all that I could do was smile as I appreciated the work of the artist that took their time to draw a colorful \u00a0fish made of soy sauce and other condiments to go with my sushi. I had the Green Harbor Yuzu Roll which was super delish! I am most definitely coming back."], ["Jen B.", "My dinner mate and I came to Yuzu for sushi and robata this past Friday night. My dinner mate had read the reviews and made a reservation, and we both arrived early and were seated promptly. The tables have chair and bench seating. Bench seating is attached to a wall, and there are hooks on the walls for your personal belongings. Given how cramped the seating is, this was greatly appreciated. Service is attentive, but it feels rushed. The food is beautifully presented. From the fan-shaped avocado slices that accompany the tuna poke to the rainbow of sauces that frame the rolls, the food is exceptionally well-prepared and presented. Tuna poke is a good bet, with a spicy kick and generous portion size. I'm glad we ordered this even though there is a salmonella outbreak associated with raw tuna at sushi restaurants in 9 states, including IL. I took the risk, and I'm glad I did. I liked the inclusion of cilantro in the River Walk roll. The robata reminded me of Korean BBQ. I preferred the sweetness of the beef short rib over the chicken golek, but if you like a wet dressing to your meat, then the chicken golek may be your best bet. Overall, I enjoyed my meal, but I wish the seating area was larger and the service wasn't as rushed."], ["Ashley C.", "Sorry, Yuzu, this is just not working out and you are being dumped. \u00a0This is not because of their food, but because of their bad service. \u00a0In particular, we dealt with at least two different employees trying to make a reservation. \u00a0We were put on hold for over five minutes before we were hung up on. \u00a0Accidents \u00a0understandably happen so we called back. \u00a0My husband was explaining that we were on hold and got hung up on, but without listening, they already put us back on hold. We waited about 10 minutes and nothing. \u00a0My husband hung up and called again. \u00a0This time the employee was very rude which left a bad taste in our mouth. \u00a0We hung up and decided to go elsewhere. \u00a0It should not be that hard to make a reservation (get on opentable!) and certainly an employee should not be so rude. \u00a0I'll take my business elsewhere.EDIT: I am impressed that Yuzu monitors its Yelp, comments promptly, and seeks to improve. \u00a0Given their effort, I will consider returning."], ["Emily C.", "Obsessed with this place. It's a little pricey, but it's consistently delicious and right around the block...what more could I ask for? I love sushi and this place hits the mark every time."], ["Eric H.", "Yuzu is my new favorite sushi spot in Chicago. The menu is always full of creatively named and crafted specialty rolls, great appetizers, and an delicious selection of robata grill items that I like to add on to my orders for a little taste of something I may have a craving for. The staff is always helpful, kind, and accommodating. For instance, one time that I went, a roll took longer than expected to come out (about 10 min after the rest of the meal), so our waitress gave it to us for free. The late roll was the most expensive roll of the meal, so it brought our total for two people with appetizers and rolls to about $60 (a total steal for the quality). Most importantly however, the sushi is just amazing. Everything is so well balanced and made to taste and look perfect. Plus there are unique items on this menu that you just can't get as good anywhere else that I've found.Pro tip: get the Mango Avocado appetizer. The balance of spicy Ponzu, creamy avocado, and sweet mango is unreal.Highly recommend."], ["Ali D.", "This modern Japanese restaurant lies at the nexus of great taste, cool ambiance & solid value. Definitely worth a check out! Try their unique signature rolls."], ["Larry F.", "QUICK HIT (Must Go vs. Consider Checking It Out vs. Pass/Don't Bother): \u00a0Pass/Don't BotherI came to Yuzu Sushi for lunch this past week. It had been on my \"need to go to\" list for awhile, but due to the size of the restaurant, securing a reservation had proven difficult. Regardless, I ordered two orders of the short rib (seemed to be a Yelp favorite), and three sushi rolls (black sea, what's my name,and chicago spring). The short rib was quite good: flavorful, tender, well cooked. With that being said, its $3.50 for one skewer of short rib (yes, one skewer), and the quality did not justify the pricing. The sushi, which is what I truly came for, was unimpressive. I wanted to like the sushi, but was legitimately underwhelmed. The fish did not seem fresh, nor did the flavor \"wow\" me. Very disappointed. Perhaps this was because it was lunchtime, that I am unsure of, but nothing provokes me to come back at dinnertime to find out."], ["Greta D.", "I love this place.

They really have the best affordable sushi in the Bucktown-Ukrainian Village-Wicker Park area. So many creative rolls! As someone who has to eat gluten free, I love that they don't lean too heavily on tempura to make their signature rolls interesting and tasty. Means that I have a lot more options to choose from! I love that they are BYOB, and they were great about letting me bring in my cocktail-in-a-jar the last time I ate in. My takeout is always ready in less time than projected too. The staff have always been very helpful and pleasant. I am knocking off one star because they have been a little inconsistent lately. In particular, in my last takeout order, the cucumber-avocado roll contained no cucumber, and the avocado was quite underipe.

You do get a decent sized roll for the price you're paying, and they're fairly quick in getting it to your table, but nothing had a taste!I think this place has a lot of hype because it's so small and doesn't take reservations, so by the time you sit down you think you've made it and automatically begin thinking the food is better. Almost like people who think the more expensive a bottle of wine the better the taste.Save yourself some time and try Wakamono up the street from here instead."], ["Regina G.", "Best sushi in the city !

I was fairly let down. We ordered sashimi and the salmon was still slightly frozen. I also think the rolls have far too much going on. We decided to try a roll that had bacon and scallops thinking it sounded interesting. Bacon just didn't go well with sushi and there were large pieces of carrot in the roll which destroyed the texture once you started chewing.

I came at 5:05 to insure I'd get a table, and was one of the first tables here. Fast forward to almost 50 mins later, I've had excuse after excuse why my simple order hadn't arrived (2 hand rolls, 2 pcs nigiri, and one small roll)... even after I asked the server to please stop making excuses, and just bring my food when it was ready.She ignored me, and just repeated, at length, the same excuse, 3 or 4 times: somehow a hand roll can only be rolled by the main chef, but 4 people work on the rolls, which was, of course, not mentioned when I made my order. Though I didn't say so, that doesn't even make sense: then have these four guys do the myriad rolls being delivered, and have the main chef do only the things only he can!After all this, I was treated as if I was the problem for not being satisfied with the situation and the excuses. Lack of listening & customer service were the issue, but she was completely oblivious.Meanwhile everyone around me is happily eating.When my order finally came 5 minutes later, it wasn't even correct: I ordered mackerel nigiri and they gave me salmon. I was done... I just asked them to bring the mackerel I ordered, a box, and the check.They couldn't even do that right... bringing a box that would hold barely one hand roll. When I protested, they took my food, packed it up, but didn't correct the incorrect nigiri. Now I had no nigiri in my box, had to reorder it and pay for it separately, adding further to my negative experience.I waited tables for years, and would never treat anyone the way I was treated! I guess they don't care, because this place is packed, but it would have been nice for someone, anyone, a manager perhaps(?) to try to make my experience better. Guess that's just not in Toro's DNA.Went home and am glad I have my own chopsticks, because there were none in the bag. See my pics of the broken looking mackerel and falling apart negi maki... nothing tasted fresh, it even smelled fishy,and I live right around the corner. I will never never eat here again!SIDE NOTE: After I left I couldn't shake the thought that the Escolar they were touting as \"Super White Tuna\" on the menu was something I'd heard about on the news... a quick Google search confirms it: several sushi places have been outed in Minneapolis for passing Escolar off as Super White Tuna, however it is not, and those in the know call it the \"ex-lax\" fish... Even the non-GMO regulating FDA warns about eating Escolar, as it contains a non-digestible compound that can cause \"nausea, diarrhea, and cramping...\" Thanks but no thanks!"], ["Lei L.", "Awuful bad service.

They only had vegetable gyoza that came deep fat fried. So we passed on that. I had a side salad that was drowning in ginger dressing. Hubs had miso soup. It's still hard to get used to the BYOB policy that a lot of restaurants in Chicago have. Being from Des Moines, we don't have that rule. It's kind of annoying if you don't want to bring your own liquor.I got a Philadelphia roll and a crunchy and spicy California roll, which were both pretty good but not anything better than I could have gotten in Des Moines. My husband got a Crazy Horse roll and some mackerel nigiri which he thought were just ok; nothing special. We've had some really great sushi in Des Moines that we expect better quality sushi when we go to a bigger city like Chicago.

The wait got up to 2 hours, though we put our name in early.

They have great speciality rolls with beautiful presentation (see pic). Not the best sushi (even for its price) that I have had in Chicago, but I think it's a solid place that is worth coming to if you don't have too long of a wait.

I ended up getting both -- a spicy tuna roll ($7) and the garlic pork spicy miso ramen ($14). The spicy tuna came in 8 pieces -- the tuna wasn't chopped tiny and there was no mayo, so +1. As for the ramen, the noodle texture were more like egg noodles (full disclosure: my guideline for ramen is Santouka). As other reviewers have noted, the spicy miso is not all that spicy (more like a layer on top of a miso) -- and the broth is not very porky, but on the plus, there were plenty of scallions and the egg was done perfectly. As for the meat, I think I would have preferred more of the spicy ground pork and less of the belly, which definitely felt out of place (probably placed in last?) and not as tender as I would have liked.My friend had a chirashi -- at $25, it was quite large -- the size of my ramen bowl -- and she had trouble finishing it. There was a good variety of fish (eyeballing it, probably 8 or 9 kinds with 2 to 3 pieces each?) and the salmon in particular looked quite fresh.The garlic pork ramen is good for folks who like lighter broths, and it hit the spot for that particularly cold day.

Even it is late April, the tempature is still below 40F. I really needed a warm noodle soup.Umai is on the corner of Polk and S. Clark. Very comfy and earthy lobby. We did a bit research before hand so quickly chose Ton Katsu Ramen and Winter Ramen. Both were served in the huge bowl. The Winter Ramen appeared in a spicy broth which was actually not as spicy as it looked. I liked the proached egg and ground pork sauce on the top. Thin sliced beef was OK. The soup is slightly on the salty side. The noodle was cooked right with a bit chewy. An awesome bowl for this cold day. My friend's was pretty good too. She liked the pork belly a lot. The soup was also a bit salty for her. So both of us drunk a lot of tea and walked out with a round belly.We also tried a piece of Unagi which is average. Service was fine without much delay.

The roll was a decent size and perfect to split with 2 people as an appetizer. I can't explain how good it tasted! Now RAMEN! I had the ton katsu ramen which was amazing! The broth was sooo on point! The pork was so thick and had great flavor. The egg was perfectly done where the yolk was still runny. My bf ordered the spicy roasted garlic ramen. Don't let the name fool you. The garlic flavor was not overbearing. Balance was perfect! We recommend both!

It was pretty dead inside so it was no problem getting a table. The inside looked pretty nice. It had that simple yet modern kind of feel. There were wooden tables, wooden floors and big windows along the walls.I didn't get to try too many things on the menu since there was just two of us, but I thought the food I ordered was really good. I got the spicy roasted garlic pork ramen. The noodles were somewhat forgettable, but wow that broth was amazing. It was rich and had that deep pork flavor. Throughout the ramen was little bits of spicy ground pork and on top were a couple pieces of nicely charred pork belly. The runny egg was also cooked perfectly. The best part though was the strong garlic flavor. I haven't seen too many ramen places where garlic was a dominant flavor, and being a garlic lover, I couldn't get enough of it. Overall it was a very solid bowl of ramen, surprisingly better than some of the other places I've tried around Chicago.For dessert we got the green tea creme brulee and strawberry mochi ice cream. The mochi was pretty standard, but the creme brulee was a nice unique dessert. It had a nice caramelized top and sweet green tea flavored cream underneath. I don't know if I'd go out of my way just to visit Umai, but the food was tasty and I'd probably go back if I was in the area."], ["Cherry L.", "I tried their lunch ramen with some agedashi tofu...

Noodles were still a little al dente so to speak, which is something I prefer, and it also had great texture. \u00a0This isn't your normal dry ramen from college so expect to pay a little more, its definitely worth it. Also, if you're a fan of spicy, then try their spicy edamame.

Our dinner started off with \"LOLLIPOPS CHICKEN\" as the appetizer. They were near perfectly fried and the accompanying mayo dipping sauce was spectacular as it complimented them so well. Following the appetizer, we were given our sushi orders, \"NAKED,\" \"MEXICANA,\" and \"DYNAMITE.\" Their presentation for each dish was brilliant. The Naked was unique as it was not wrapped in traditional rice or seaweed, but cucumbers that offered a slimy and soft texture and taste. The Dynamite, with its sweet potato tempura and kani kana, offered perfect texture and heat. The Mexicana was beautifully decorated as the avocados and fish were an unbeatable combination. After sushi were the noodles. I ordered the Winter Ramen while my accompanying party ordered the Ton Kotsu and Spicy Garlic Pork Ramen. The Winter Ramen was great with soup that looked red but not spicy. It had a mild or close to no heat along with, perfect for my taste buds. I had a spoonful of the Spicy Garlic soup too, and the soup of that was even better than the Winter. I never had a taste of the Ton Kotsu, but according to my friend, she claims it's the best one of all. Umai is a great getaway restaurant for a date, family, or friends. It offers beautiful sushi and the ramen and udon is an extra bonus. The waiters and waitresses are all great. Although there were a couple parties present in addition to the other groups seated at tables, our waitress was always there when needed. Good time. Good vibes."], ["Angelique A.", "Very good value for lunch. We got ramen and the bento box and throughly enjoyed all the offerings.

Definitely could have used more flavor development in my opinion with the soups.

I was hopeful to try out another restaurant that serves ramen. Since it was lunch time, my friend and I order their lunch special ramen, chashu ramen. The toppings were great. The chashu was tender and the bamboo shoots were flavorful. However, the broth was very salty and heavy while the noodles were tough. Broth and noodles are such important components of a noodle soup and should be able to stand alone. After this experience, I have officially given up on ramen and will no longer go out of my way for it. Maybe I will give ramen another try if I ever travel to Japan. I also ordered the sashimi bento.

I had one of Chef's specialities - SukiYaki which is thinly sliced beef loin, with shirataki noodles, mushroom, grilled tofu, and a delicious sukiyaki sauce. It's so good that I might have to order it again when I go back to Umai. We also had a couple simple but very fresh \u00a0sushi rolls that are priced fairly good.

Just sad that there were only 2 pieces.The Spicy Roasted Garlic Pork Ramen was, of course, great. Not the best I've had but probably the best I've had here in town. I only wish there was a little more of everything in it, the bowl looked a bit bare when it arrived. I totally recommend my fellow Ramen-addicts to try it out.My only complaint were that the cocktails were a little too sweet, but that's probably our fault for ordering the girliest, most colorful cocktails on the menu (Sex and the City style).

Well worth it though./ATMOSPHEREOne way to describe this place would be small. From the outside, it looks it. Inside, it's perfectly cramped which creates a type of intimate surrounding. The booths near the sushi bar are private in a way since the walls are very high. The decor was quite warm and inviting./FOODWe went with the recommendation the waitstaff provided. It was on point.

Enter at your own risk.2 Stars - If I'm in the area, I'd pick something else.3 Stars - I would stop by if I happen to be in the area.4 Stars - I would pick this place out of other places nearby.5 Stars - I would go out of my way to dine here."], ["Michael P.", "Yelp needs to have an extra credit rating or something, because I cannot praise Kai Zan enough. \u00a0We ended up here for my girlfriend's birthday. \u00a0She used to live over this way, and when we started dating and were comparing \"This is the best sushi place in the city\" stories, she mentioned Kai Zan and stuck to it. \u00a0Every place I mentioned, she would just say, \"I want to take you to Kai Zan.\" \u00a0I put her off long enough to make it part of her birthday evening, and I am kicking myself for waiting so long. \u00a0This was the best sushi experience I have had in the city, period. \u00a0We started off with some chutoro, then dove into the Omakase. \u00a0The chutoro was delicious, better than the otoro I have had some places. \u00a0I will not recount each and every course of the Omakase as that has been done ad nauseum, but I will point out some highlights. \u00a0I would make a meal out of the escolar and maguro bites. \u00a0Delectable. \u00a0A close second in the \"eat this until I'm full\" was the maguro stuffed with crab. \u00a0The shooters course included one with oyster and one with uni and scallop. \u00a0Both had quail egg. \u00a0The uni/scallop shooter was the freshest, most oceanic thing I recall having ever tasted. \u00a0The only courses I would not rave about were the roll and the sashimi plate. \u00a0The roll was a good roll, but it was still just a roll that didn't really showcase the fish. \u00a0The sashimi plate was excellent save for the maguro which inexplicably did not seem to be of the same quality as that which had been used in the other maguro courses. \u00a0It was still better than what you get at most sushi restaurants, but by the time that course (the 10th) came, I was getting spoiled. \u00a0The service was just fine. \u00a0Very pleasant, described each dish well, answered all questions. \u00a0Only complaint is that the meal was a bit rushed as compared to other Omakase dinners I have had. \u00a0A few times the next dish was brought right as we were finishing a course, and once we had two on the table at the same time. \u00a0And I am not a slow eater. \u00a0I can be quite the pig, if I have to be honest, so I don't feel bad saying I felt rushed. \u00a0I really cannot understand any of the reviewers who have expressed disappointment with the prices at Kai Zan. \u00a0$60 for an Omakase of this quality is an absolute bargain. \u00a0Try getting all of those same dishes at Arami, Katsu, Macku Signature, Momotaro, whatever your favorite sushi place is, and I feel safe saying it's going to cost more by a decent amount, and there are not more than a handful of sushi restaurants in Chicago where the quality will be in the same ballpark. I have other daily drivers I will continue to go to, but Kai Zan just secured a position as the place I will go to when I really want to do it right."], ["Vicki P.", "My husband and I went here a few time, it has always been wonderful. This last visit a few weeks ago I was ever so slightly disappointed in a piece of sashimi we got, I mentioned it to my husband and as it turned out, the manager over heard me and brought us a new piece. I asked her why she did that and she told us how important it was that we got what we expected and that the experience was a good one. \u00a0I was truly impressed by this actually... here is a place that always gets great reviews, is always busy, but still found so much value in making sure we were happy, even without us asking.

However their slouchy long-haired waiter rubbed our entire party wrong with the lax attitude rubbed us entirely the wrong way. He had no opinion on any of the dishes, made us feel stupid for not knowing the portion sizes, and made no efforts to make first time visitors feel welcome. Also, their wait staff picked up two dishes which weren't even completely finished. Hey! We still have ginger on the plate asshole! Michelin rated for the food, not the service. This food was AMAZING but find some new employees"], ["Anna P.", "Best Japanese in Chicago. Three tips for when you visit:1. Get the omakase. Kai Zan chefs know what you want more than you do. Trust me on this.2. Make a reservation. You will never get in without one. And be prepared to get up and leave after 90 minutes; they're strict here.3. If it's not on the omakase menu, do yourself a favor and add on an order of the escolar pearls.Prepare to have your mind blown!"], ["Sarah M.", "SO GREAT! Amazing small dishes with so much flavor. I recommend the green monster roll, but you really can't go wrong."], ["Farha K.", "2 days after eating one of the most spectacular dinners of 2015 yet I'm still dreaming about every course served up at Kai Zan. I try to keep up with the foodie scene in Chicago even though I moved out to the east coast a year ago and stumbled upon Kai Zan's instagram page about a month ago. Kai Zan isn't your momma's sushi restaurant so check your expectations.. and everything you know about sushi at the door. Now step in. The decor will quite literally set the tone for the rest of the night, it's dark..moody...sexy... you may blush a little when you step in even. The staff is incredibly friendly though and you'll feel at ease immediately. If you're lucky you might get seated at the bar so you can watch the magic happen, but the cozy booths lend themselves to a more intimate seating if you're there as a couple or a small group and want your privacy. While stalking Kai Zan's instagram I basically had my heart set on trying out their Omakase menu ...but literally everything screams to be eaten and the choices are insane! how do you pick one over the other?? the Omakase is a 10 course hand selected menu by the chefs which really does introduce you to almost everything on the menu. It's special.. it truly is special. We started off with the Japanese Red Snapper wrapped around toro and topped with basil miso olive oil and tobiko... and ZOMG!!! I may have had a moment ... wink wink ....followed by more amazingness.. but my personal favorite had to be the Oyster and scallop shooters topped with ponzu sauce and fresh Uni.. how is this even real life? So glad we got 2 shooters each cuz there's no way I would have settled for just 1. I think the chef over heard me gushing about my love affair with Uni, cuz he ended up treating us to an extra course of hamachi with uni on the house.. over this amazing sweet mango sauce of some sort.. I stopped paying attention to every detail after some time.. you'll see the pictures on my IG and know what I'm talking about.  I just wanted to enjoy each bite and every moment. By the end of dinner we were sufficiently stuffed..split dessert between the two of us and had a couple drinks. Definitely made for a fun girl's night out and you really do need to go here with someone who appreciates sashimi in its best form. Save this one for a special night... but make it happen soon!"], ["Chandni K.", "Some of the best sushi I've had! I would highly recommend the Omakase for the value and variety. You get 10 courses, some of which are 4-5 bites of food. You won't leave hungry. If you're not a picky eater and like surprises, this place is awesome. You don't know what you're going to get until it's sitting in front of you. Everything was good, but I do have some favorites - the escolar pearls, uni and oyster shooters, angry crab, and fiesta maki roll. For dessert we had the seasonal mochi (sweet potato and brown butter) and the cashew panna cotta, which are good if you're not into really sweet desserts. Overall, an awesome meal and a really fun experience. Can't wait to go back!"], ["Jasmin T.", "People love this place and I always wonder why. We went up eating here when we are starving after work and the portions are not enough and the prices are sky high. Sure it's cute, but there are other places that you can go to get some great sushi. The staff is really friendly and help you make some smart choices. If you do do I recommend the calamari strings and whatever the chef's special role is. I didn't like the limited dessert menu. As someone with a big sweet tooth that is a must!!"], ["Shradha A.", "As a vegetarian, they had very limited selection so I couldn't rate this high from my point of view. I have heard amazing things from others, as the Yelp reviews indicate, for non-vegetarian selection. We had the agedashi tofu, a maki roll with some pickled vegetables, and a mushroom skewer. Request the booths - the ambiance there is quite cool. We were sat at the counter, so it was fun seeing the colorful preparations designed quite well."], ["Amy S.", "Magnificent! I came here with my boyfriend, sister, and brother-in-law. It was an early celebration for my sister, who happens to be a chef, so I was trying to choose the best meal in Chicago that wouldn't break the bank, and a place that we all haven't been to yet. And what do you know, Kai Zan was just that spot!We all got the Omakase Chef's Choice 12-course tasting. This is basically a surprise tasting, where everything is left to the Chef. Of course if you have any restrictions or allergies, the Chef will adjust the menu accordingly. I have to say, without exaggerating at all, this was the best seafood experience I have ever had in Chicago. Every single course contained the freshest and highest quality fish. I am super picky about sushi and especially sashimi, but this literally melts in your mouth. Every course was full of surprises and full of bold flavors. I have attached all of the food from the courses to this review if you want to check it out. It's BYOB but the corkage fee is $15, which has gone up from when they first started. The Omakase 12-course menu is $60/person, which is very very reasonable for the amount of quality food you get. Although the neighborhood seems sketchy, it's really not bad. Plus, parking is plentiful which makes it easier to get to.The one and only thing I would change is incorporating 1-2 dessert courses at the very end of the meal because after the \"main course\" there are more maki and sashimi courses."], ["Jeff P.", "I wasn't totally impressed with the food we did the chef's tasting menu... meh... also service was so-so we had a 10:15pm reservation which maybe contributed to that but still.... meh.... better options for a $200+ dinner for 2."], ["Maggie Z.", "The waiter that took our order wasn't friendly. He looked like he was constantly despising other people and treated us like 2-year olds. But.... the food was great! So good that we could completely ignore the waiter as he ignored us. We ordered a $70 omakase ($60 if you don't want to share), 2 chutoro nigiris and a chicken teriyaki. I can't say I enjoyed all of them, and because there was no desert so it didn't feel like a complete omakase meal, but some of the dishes were AMAZINGLY Delicious.A lot of the things were not on the menu. But if you have sth you want in mind, you can always ask them to prepare it for you.

We ordered the chef's choice and each dish that came out was presented beautifully and tasted delicious. We were stuffed when tenth course came out.The atmosphere was very cute, great for a date or small group. My only complaint was the courses came out so quickly, sometimes before we had finished the present one on the table. I know this place is popular and reservations are difficult but the two hour time limit on each table made us feel rushed. We would have finished in under two hours easily but I was very aware of the time. Outside of that I will check this place out again. Also, the sake selection was superb!"], ["Huong N.", "The service is spectacular. Although we were designated with one server, multiple staffs check in with us and brought our food. Water was always filled. They had complementary green tea. It was amazing to sit in the bar because you will have the experience to watch the sushi chefs and cooks make the food for you. It was very enjoyable to watch. They take their time and are so careful with their food. I would suggest getting \u00a0the omasake if it's your first time. It's a sample of all their specialties for $60 which included about \u00a09-10 courses of food. Personally, I thought the cooked food was alright. However, what was really delicious was the sushi and fish. I have never had fish this fresh. It's so fresh that it doesn't even taste like fish.

Avocado smoothie with tapioca all the way! It sounds like a strange combo, but it's refreshingly delicious. Also, you could split any of their smoothies between two people - in fact, you probably should if you don't wanna be so full you can't move. They have a website to order online for pick up or delivery, which is super convenient. Last I saw, they offered 10% off your delivery order if you place it online. I usually order a crunchy shrimp roll and grab one of their (huge) ginger dressing side salads for about $10. You can order a roll off the menu, or if you're in a rush, they have a small cooler with rolls and sides ready To Go. I think they have reasonably priced and amazingly delicious rolls.

I had the salmon don and strawberry watermelon bubble tea. It totaled around $18, but there are other options for $10. The rolls range from $2,80-$10. There are vegetarian options and cooked options. The Salmon don came with eight fresh, meaty pieces of salmon sashimi. The bowl was $12, something I would probably get for $20-25 at a regular sushi restaurant. It also came with a pretty big bowl of miso with LOTS of tofu (heart heart thank you).The restaurant is very clean and the food was delicious and filling. Will be back for more. Nom Nom.

There was one instance where there were weird plastic shards in my friend's smoothie, but he attests that this was a one-time whoopsie and has not been a repeat offense. The fish itself is generally pretty fresh and lacking in odor, but the prices are also a little steep for the quick, simple spot that Osaka is. All in all, in short, \"A-OK\" - it won't ruin your day, but it also won't give you any sort of mouthgasms."], ["Samantha T.", "I lived in Chicago for three years and I can't even count how many of Osaka's delicious smoothies I've had.

I have been coming here for years. I like coming to this location because it's in a not-so-busy part of Michigan Avenue and I usually can find street parking. They have their own parking lot, but the spaces are kind of tight. I love the ambience and decor of the place. They offer really good appetizers and salads in addition to their complimentary fried seaweed. The maki rolls are a decent price and aren't too crazy with multiple ingredients so that you can taste the fish. They have good drinks too. Definitely recommend."], ["Jacob J.", "The Saturday past we decided late in the game to head out for sushi. Coming from the Bridgeport area, many sushi bars were quoting hour long wait times. Here we were able to score a table within twenty minutes.In attendance were six adults and three kids. \u00a0After seating and handed menus we didn't see the waiter again for over fifteen minutes. \u00a0A busboy stopped by with water right before our waiter returned. \u00a0The late timing of our waiter would be repeated constantly over the course of our dinner. \u00a0The place was moderately busy but most tables were on the tail end of their meals.Later evening on a Saturday night, the lights were dimmed to a level where we needed to use the table votive (light) to see the menus.The place is decorated quite nicely. I guess it could be a fine dining option with friends or on a date. \u00a0The front area of the restaurant could be used as a meeting place, if professionals aim to meet clients for a meal or chat.We placed orders for 3 - 4 appetizers, 8 - 9 rolls of sushi, we had some sashimi, a couple bottles of hot sake, some noodles and a few more items. \u00a0Many of the rolls ordered were off the deluxe sushi menu. \u00a0All but two types of rolls were average stuff. \u00a0The appetizers weren't memorable except fodder for my review. For example the shrimp dumplings, which I expected to be more than a large triangle dumpling filled with a single piece of boiled shrimp. \u00a0At a cost of 4 pcs for $10.50!, we should have gotten the gyoza instead or a few pieces of ebi. \u00a0I don't mind spending money, but there should be a value realized when tasting. \u00a0For instance, the noodle dish which I want to guess was yakisoba with chicken (?) A good selection, everyone thought the noodles were tasty, however I think a bowl went for almost $13 dollars. \u00a0(Yikes) Service was so slow. \u00a0Alike another review that recalled the experiences of a large group dining, they mentioned their food arriving slowly, the same I would relate about this experience. \u00a0Slow, hard to find staff, when I called for someone to come over they motioned for us to wait for \"our\" waiter. \u00a0Wonk, wonk, wonk.. Okay experience which I probably wouldn't repeat right away. \u00a0If I'm in the hood, it wouldn't be my first choice. \u00a0But if others wanted to check it out, I'd probably join in."], ["Alexander G.", "Place was really nice - sushi was also really good - i eould come here again - I was lucky i didnt have to wait really long until i got a table, drinks and food!"], ["Amy H.", "I really enjoyed this place!!

The eel on the dragon roll was too crisp and burnt as if it was in the oven for too long. While the south scallop maki was similar to a sushi sandwich and I didnt taste anything special about that.

We all agreed that the rolls were tasty and fresh, although still slightly more expensive than what you could get in the area(and not as good as the original Coast sushi). However, I liked the ambiance and they had good cocktails.Maybe things have changed? Or maybe things are different in the delivery world. I just ordered delivery and was disappointed.

Our server was very good and she won extra points later in the dinner. \u00a0They seemed a bit short staffed so drinks took a while. \u00a0Not a big deal. \u00a0We received the complimentary tempura seaweed/kale thing. \u00a0it was tasty but you really can't go with wrong with anything that's been \"tempured\". \u00a0We started off with the Tuna Tartare, Volcano and Spring Maki. \u00a0The tartare was good but, just like Hub51, they serve it with a Styrofoam like sesame chip. \u00a0House made won ton chips are the ONLY way to serve tuna tartare or poke, people! The Volcano was good but the snow drift like tempura crumbs added nothing to the dish. \u00a0The spring maki was just okay. \u00a0Our 2nd round was the spicy tuna, crunch maki and super white tuna and Toro Nigiri. \u00a0For the first time for me, I liked the nigiri better than the maki. The toro was excellent and was the star of the meal. \u00a0The super white was also good. \u00a0The maki kind of feel flat and didn't have enough taste.Then came the biggest misstep of the night. \u00a0We were drinking Belvedere martinis, straight up with a twist. \u00a0Our 2nd round of drinks were taking a long time. Our waitress finally brought our martinis to the table and apologized. \u00a0No problem and we took our first sip and my partner and I just looked at each other. \u00a0Is there Sprite in this we both asked? It might've been tonic but the vodka was carbonated and sweet. It's bad when you go in for your first sip of a drink and taste something totally unexpected.

Their dinnerware (can't believe I just said that) is modern and trendy, and their plating is thought out. It's like your neighborhood sushi bar, turned up a notch or two. I think it would be a great place for a date-- nice enough to feel special but not stuffy enough to feel awkward. I went with a group of three girls. We all got martinis and all of them were simple and good. Don't expect any crazy mixology. The seaweed salad we got to start was everything you'd want in that dish: super fresh, a little acidic. It came with a little cucumber, too. The tuna tartare was great as well. The tuna was diced and mixed with ginger and white soy, then served with a crispy sesame cracker. The waitress also brought us a complimentary appetizer-- I think it was deep fried seaweed. It came with two super yummy and fatty mayo dips that we ended up dipping everything in. We had two maki rolls, the Crunchy and the Dragon Rock. The Crunchy roll left a little to be desired. It was covered in tempura crumbs but lacked the texture you'd expect from them. The Dragon Rock roll was savory goodness, but I'm not sure how you can go wrong with a deep fried roll filled with shrimp, avocado, jalapeno, and spicy mayo. I also had a piece of tuna nigiri (my first nigiri!) and I really enjoyed being able to taste the freshness of the fish by itself. That wasn't enough to fill us up so we ordered another round of food. Whoops. I felt kind of dumb ordering the chicken teriyaki but it was worth it. Super tender slices of chicken covered in a tasty sauce that had just the right of tang and sweetness. We also had miso soup and a side of asparagus (pretty generous portion).

Rice-less choose your own fish rolls, um, this restaurant was MADE for me!This restaurant was NOT overly packed, and in fact nice and spacious, when we arrived, which I love because I actually wanted to TALK TO MY FRIEND as well as scarf down the goods... Speaking of goods, here is what we ordered:- Edamame: PERHAPS THE BEST edamame I have ever had, every piece was salty, and there were three pods in almost ever one... And it was almost as if they were slightly roasted. YUM!- Beef Wrapped in Scallions: the beef was good, but the sauce was too much, too over powering. In fact, my friend ate one and then expressed her opinion and the wait staff took it back and wound up not charging us for it! The owner/manager of the restaurant even came over to make sure we were okay... TALK ABOUT AMAZING SERVICE! I love meeting restaurant owners who genuinely CARE about their dining patrons!- Unagi wrapped in cucumber with avocado (no rice)... I ordered this TWICE! I couldn't get enough. It was perfection. Took me to a whole other level of delicious in the sushi world... I will not be ordering this everywhere I go! Sumo, you unleashed a monster! - Salmon wrapped in cucumber with avocado (no rice): this was also extremely tasty and fresh, however the avocado overpowered a tiny bit, but that can easily be taken care of by take some out... And eating it before... After all you don't want to waste that precious healthy fat!- 6 Salmon Skin Hand Rolls (no rice, no sauce, no veggies): I judge sushi restaurants solely on their capability of accommodating this order (I order it EVERYWHERE I go) and... Sumo had ZERO problem doing it... And in fact, got it RIGHT! The salmon skin was super crispy and salty prior to be dipping it in any soy sauce... I ordered three to start but couldn't resist ordering more, and I even enticed my friend, a salmon skin virgin, to give it a go and she ADORED IT! If I could, I would have ordered six more! - Sashimi Deluxe: when my friends entree arrived, I was JEALOUS AF! I wanted that. Dammit, meal envy, even though my dishes kicked ass too. She did let me have a piece of escolar/white tuna and boy was my mouth pleased!!! So succulent, rich and FRESH! Gaaah GAHHHHH! A must order! This feast was phenomenal and considering how much food we got, totally worth the price! If I were staying in Chicago another few days, I probably would go back at least 2 moe times!Oh and did I mention how awesome the waitstaff was...

We got the Spicy Roll Combo Dinner (plain, but a lot...) which was good. The other dish we got was the Dynamite roll which was DY-NO-MITE! I think it's a good combo to get a specialty roll and then a generic roll, just to switch it up and get the most bang for your buck.I'll come back for sure.

This includes mushrooms in clear broth and salad. 3. Lunch boxes for $7.50-$12. These include 4 pieces of California roll, 2 pieces of shumai (Chinese dumplings with pork), miso soup, and salad. \u00a0Note that their cheaper items are vegetarian-based, while the more expensive ones include seafood. To celebrate their grand opening, their website has coupons for 20% off with $30 dine-in purchase.Their interior decor includes figurines and swords which adds to the authentic Japanese vibe. However, the manager and waitress attempted to speak Mandarin with me which somewhat detracted from the ambience. Don't get me wrong though - their service was still very attentive. On average, they either dropped by or asked how we were doing every 5 minutes.The -1 star is because the veggies in my vegetarian hibachi weren't grilled with enough sauce. Without the ginger and \"yummy yummy\" sauces on the side, the veggies would've been bland. I'm not sure if that style of food preparation was intentional, but the veggie fried rice pairing in my order was flavorful. Overall, for the price of the lunch special, I got what I paid for. To be fair, I'd give them another shot and try their other items, since they just opened."], ["Lori M.", "Delighted to finally try last night and look forward to going back!

DAMN their happy hour is good. For $23 you get a three course meal that is surprisingly substantial, plus a cheap tallboy beer (like PBR or Tiger) and a shochu shot (essentially fruit syrup). You could also get the two course version for $19, but that seems silly. I always get a cocktail and leave having had an amazing meal at Momotaro for under $40. Appetizers: I've only ever had their deviled eggs with crab, because there's no reason to get anything other than this. It's two pieces of deliciousness with a crunchy chip on top.Entrees: I have tried three different entrees and my favorite is by far the clams in a delicious broth with super buttery toast. Ridiculously tasty and a decent sized plate. The pork tonkatsu with cabbage was tasty, although I admit that I don't have much to compare it to. The only other place I've had tonkatsu is in a financial district lunch spot in SF. I also have had their cold noodle dish, which was huge and quite tasty, although it paled in comparison to the clams. I actually took home leftovers!Dessert: I DREAM OF THEIR BLACK SUGAR ICE CREAM. Yes, that deserved all caps. It's a small dessert with just a quenelle of ice cream atop chocolate feuilletine streusel, but it is ridiculously delicious. I've been back several times just for this dessert. I'm obsessed.One day I will make it upstairs in Momotaro, and I'm sure it will be amazing. But for now, the happy hour downstairs between 6 and 8pm is making me a very happy girl."], ["Maggie Z.", "I had always known this restaurant. But we had never been there for lack of excuse for dining at such an expensive place. Finally the excuse came!We went Saturday night with a reservation. The staff were friendly. My first impression was that the table layout was beautiful, quite Japanese. After reading the menu, we asked the waitress for recommendations. She knew the menu really well and we took some of her advice.Then the food came. They were all good! I especially like the tomato beef tartare. It's called beef, but it's really dried tomatoes disguised as beef tartare. The taste was fresh and the idea was so creative! I also really loved the nigiri sushi. The rice was compact, flavored and toppings were delicious. I have been to more than 10 well-known sushi place in Chitown, this is definitely Top 1 or Top 2. I'm not sure about this because I cannot forgot sushi in Japonais by Morimoto: heavenly good!"], ["Annie K.", "Underwhelming.I tried to get a dinner reservation for 2 for a Thursday, but alas, the only available time was either 5:30 or 9:30. Hey, this place must be cracking! Wrong. I chose 5:30 and walked into a a ghost town of a restaurant. The main floor was empty with the exception of 3-4 tables and the place wasn't even close to full by the time we left. I'm pretty sure they could've accommodated my reservation request for 6:30. (Perhaps all those tables and chairs are for decoration..?)The food was decent, but as previously mentioned, underwhelming.We started with the momo-something roll (no, that's not what it's called), which was pretty standard as far as rolls go.The nigiri omakase was good. It consisted of nine pieces of mid-range fish, and I enjoyed the flavor combinations. The scallop and uni combo was my favorite.Unagi don-standardWashugyu (skirt steak with foie)-tender but barely warm.Last but definitely least, the chili mentaiko spaghetti. This was my \"wtf\" dish. I love mentaiko, especially over rice. This dish, however, was just pasta slathered in globs of mayonnaise and raw egg. The instant I took a bite, all I could see was pre-diet Paula Deen shouting \"hey y'all!\" while I struggled to swallow my spoonful of mayo. Where is the chili?

So on to the food. \u00a0We pretty much went with Alla's suggestions from the dungeness crab with shishito peppers (definitely one of my favs), to chicken hearts, beef tongue, chicken meatballs, and wagyu beef and shishito peppers from the \"coals\" menu. \u00a0These are small skewers with two per order perfect for sharing.There was one dish that we are still asking \"how'd they do that?\" which was a tomato tartar which had the consistency and almost the flavor of a beef tartar but was entirely vegetarian. \u00a0It was amazing that Japanese tomatoes, dehydrated and rehydrated with spices and chopped could taste like this . . . .WOW!We also had the king crab (a large portion for the $26 price and it comes on a little hibachi grill as did the kuro buta pork chop (bone in and sliced another one of my favs). \u00a0Since so many had raved about the chili mentaiko spaghetti we had that too and it was worth the raves!Finally, we turned the menu over and ordered a few of the rolls from the back side including the chili mama, tuna saga at the eomomaki. \u00a0All were large, with an interesting mix of flavors and really fresh. \u00a0But if you go here and just order rolls, thinking this is \"just another sushi place\" you will have missed what makes Momotaro so special.Our server, Alla, was great, offering up many suggestions and even helping us to understand what the name Momotaro means and the story behind it (something to do with a peach and the folklore of a little boy being found in a peach by an elderly couple). \u00a0She was great in describing the items we ordered and made sure we knew that things would come up when they were ready which was fine given we were sharing everything anyway. \u00a0My suggestion is to do what we did and share otherwise some may be eating and others not.I am so glad I went with a group of 4 as it allowed me to taste a wide breadth of the menu on one go around. \u00a0So many interesting flavor combinations, and so authentically prepared and served, it reminded my friends of their recent trip to Japan.Will I be back? \u00a0You betcha. \u00a0There are still so many things I want to try off that menu and I've got to check out that more informal izakaya on the lower level. \u00a0It looks super cozy and authentic as well with the bar in the center and little seating clusters around. \u00a0Japan is on my \"go to\" list and I hope to get there next year. \u00a0But until then? \u00a0I'll just experience a little of the food culture right here at Momotaro."], ["Coleen K.", "This review is for the Izakaya at Momotaro.I've been here twice now, each time for the Happy Hour Special they have on Wednesdays thru Sundays. Both times, I was blown away by the quality of the food and service. The happy hour has a really nice variety of options, including a two course meal for ~$20, and a three course meal for ~$29, which includes a choice of starters, a choice of entrees, and an optional dessert (3 course option) as well as a tall boy beer and shochu shot. The first time I came in was with my boyfriend, and we tried the noodles of the day, the tonkotsu, deviled eggs and the ice cream dessert. Everything was awesome and really ample portion sizes. You'd be hard pressed to find a better deal! On my second trip to the Izakaya, I came with a business friend and we tried two of the three sake flights, as well as the chef's sashimi of the day, which was a yellowtail, the clams, and the fried chicken starter. The clams were to die for, and came served with this delicious dipping bread. These are a must have. To top it off, the Izakaya has it's own beverage coordinator who visits each table and introduces the flights of sake. This provided added fun and insight into the experience, as we learned about the origin of the names. Flights were large portions and paired very well. Really great place to come for both a date and a work meeting. Atmosphere is more laid back than upstairs, and in my experience, less crowded. No reservations necessary."], ["Lynn T.", "Made a reservation at 8:15pm and were seating at 9:00pm... was not happy about this but they gave us each a glass of champagne for the wait... that slightly made up for it... Aside from that, I loved the lively ambiance and modern decor. Momotaro is contemporary Japanese. It is very Americanized and \"hip\". Great place for a date or with a group. What we ordered: - Chef's seasonal nigiri selection: Very good and nice presentation. It comes with 8 pieces, one of each kind. I recommend it as sashimi since it comes in a decorative ice bowl which looks very pretty! - Baja Uni: Purple sea urchin. They had ran out of the Hokkaido uni so we opt'd for this. This uni was a bit bland and not as flavorful as I'm used to.- A5 Miyazki beef tartare: Loved how strong truffle taste was! The raw quail egg on top was a great touch.- Negi toro: Fatty tuna belly sushi rolls. This came in 6 pieces but the rolls here are pretty small.- Smoked bacon and eggs: Quail eggs wrapped in bacon on a skewer. The eggs were cooked very well. I've never had a quail egg with a runny yolk!- Washugyu: Wagyu skirt steak and foie gras on a skewer. Good but I could hardly taste the foie gras :(- For dessert they were nice enough to give us complementary sprinkled pocky sticksOverall, fun place for dinner. I would recommend this place to others."], ["Dan M.", "Date night atmosphere and terrific japanese-leaning entrees make this a weekend choice.

A terrific choice for west loop dining."], ["Ted T.", "Inconsistent service mars an otherwise excellent restaurant.I have been to Momotaro and its cousin, the izakaya in the basement, several times each. I have had consistently excellent food yet wildly uneven service. The service has ranged form excellent and professional to comically bad. \u00a0On one occasion they brought us the wrong order. It was 100% the servers or the kitchens fault but not ours. The server literally argued with us then walked away. The food runner apologized and said that he would get the proper order and to enjoy the incorrect order on the house. Before we could do anything the server re-appeared, snatched the plate away and said, \"well someone will eat this\" before storming off. \u00a0It was one of the craziest things I have ever seen happen at such a high-end place.It's too bad because as I said the food is excellent, though pricy. The sushi is wonderful and though I would not call any of the food truly authentic it is certainly creative and has flair and is delicious. The atmosphere is fun and well designed and quirky as well. \u00a0I really love Japanese food and culture and I enjoy everything about Momotaro except for the roulette wheel you spin when it comes to service. \u00a0Most of the time it is serviceable to good but I have had other sub par service experiences there as well. \u00a0So 1 to 2 two stars for service, 4 to 5 stars for food and I end on a 3 star review. \u00a0I hope they improve, as it would be an easy recommendation at that point.Also heads up... they used to serve the full menu in the izakaya, now they don't and they will not budge on that. \u00a0Oddly the menu downstairs has no sushi aside form a couple of maki rolls, but no straight up sushi. \u00a0This is a major oversight as sushi and a beer in an izakaya can't be beat."], ["Rosanna L.", "Eating delicious and fresh sushi can run you a pretty penny and at Momotaro it's worth every dime!All I've thought and dreamed about since I've visit Momotaro is the otoro (fatty bluefin belly) and it's melt in your mouth, foodgasmic deliciousness. Although I can't forget about the baby ika (grilled baby squid), kani karaoke, A5 miyazaki wagyu, okay just about everything we had was so freaking good! I also had hokkaido uni (sea urchin) for the first time and it was definitely an experience, but yummy.I didn't care for their desserts or oysters and the uncomfortable chairs we had to sit on for a 2 hour+ dinner.However, the otoro alone will have me coming back. I'll like to try the omaske next time."], ["John S.", "So I've gone back. Instead of visiting at a prime time with others I went early and solo, 5pm when they opened. I got a nice seat with plenty or room and a great waitress who was very helpful. They changed the menu, removed a bunch of items and made it a single sheet, double sided. It's far easier to navigate than the book they had before. This time I went straight sushi. Started with 4 common types that I order at every place to judge the quality of the fish. They were all very good. Next I did 4 items from the more creative section of the sushi menu, although good I didn't like them all equally. The King Crab & Aji were my two favorites and consider them A+ items. I had a couple glasses of the \"German Style\" beer from Japan and it was also excellent. I far prefer it over the Sapporo & Asahi style of beers, especially with the sushi.Since I was now enjoying myself here, unlike the first visit, I decided to get some carry out from the kitchen. A few simple item that would travel well. The grilled Ika, Grilled chicken skewers with green onion, & the Miso Cod. All were very good, Cod was a bit over flavored but still good with a bowl of rice.So I am upping my rating a star for a good visit. Momotaro is still super expensive but it's also different than anything in Chicago."], ["Carla Z.", "TLDR: Does it live up to the hype ? Not really ..I really wanted to love this place and made a point to come here while on business but the whole experience just felt off to me. I was seated promptly and ushered off to the sushi bar. I was confused why it was empty--true sushi fanatics know the sushi bar is where you want to be seated anywhere that serves omakase. Unfortunately for me at times it felt like my server forgot that I was seated there. I ordered a Yamazaki 12. Delicious and fine. Then the server disappeared again...For the food I wanted to try a little bit of each type. I had the raibu kani, toro tartare, nigiri pieces: Hokkaido uni, sake, & otoro, momomaki roll, wagyu don buri & caramel budin for dessert. The raibu kani was a Dungeness crab salad. Or so they said. The proportions were unbalanced... There was a huge pile of shisito peppers at the bottom--I felt duped. The crab was delicious but felt like it was too covered in mayonnaise goop. The toro tartare was fine but not mind blowing. As were the nigiri pieces. But I maybe it's only because \u00a0I compare all supposed amazing sashimi and nigiri to the two Michelin starred ichimura in Manhattan. Momomaki roll was, according to my server, the favorite on the menu. It was very bizarre to me. Although the spicy octopus inside was good it felt clunky with big eye tuna on top and a square of lotus root--neither served a purpose at least to my taste. Wagyu don buri was good for the first few bites. Then the ginger and soy based sauce becomes way too sweet and unbalanced. Not worth the price imo. The dish also needs a texture component. Finally dessert. The caramel budin was good. It's weird I think caramel and popcorn is the new dessert trend. Overall I don't think the food warrants the prices. The venue is beautiful though and the ambience is good for a date you're trying to impress."], ["Maria D.", "TAKE TWO: Our second dinner at MomotaroI was genuinely impressed when Adam with Momotaro's management reached out to invite my husband and I back to show us that they can do better! This gesture tells me that they take pride in their work and truly care about their reputation. Some of you might think that during this special visit the experience must have been staged and visitors off the street can't count on getting the same treatment. Not in this case, and here is why. When we arrived we were seated just as quickly as the first time and the service was just as impeccable, please note that we ordered right off the menu. The only difference was Emilio who was absolutely fabulous! He didn't just know the menu, he listened and aimed to please. We told him about our preferences and he delivered. Every single dish was fantastic, of course some absolutely stole our hearts. Among those winners were short-rib meatballs, skirt steak and shishito skewers, their unique (magical!!!) miso soup, ground pork shoulder curry ( a perfectly executed fusion of Thai Curry crossed with Tagliatelle in Bolognese Sauce)Lastly we tried two desserts, but one was absolutely mind-blowing. If you read some of my other reviews, you'd know that I don't usually care for dessert... But their chocolate cake with black cherry gelato, crispy bits and hot ganache had me scraping the plate and making inappropriate noises with my spoon - bravo!!!! Yes!

I had just ate but I really wanted to try this place before my vacation ended. As I walked in to the restaurant there were many open tables even towards the end of my dinner which was around 630, there were plenty of seating.

Buttery texture, lots of flavorSmoked aji not a fan of the smoke flavor but something I guess you have to experience and try yourself.Momo tartare- light and refreshingWasabi salmon roll- very basic, we were told this was the most popular roll. Don't get it if your trying to experience new and unique new things.A5 Mizyaki sirloin wagyu- the most expensive and the one dish that made my experience a whole lot better. It made up for all the other dishes. Juicy tender melt in your mouth beef.Curry udon- if you've ever had Japanese curry, it's udon smothered in this stuffAlmond crumble with peach sorbet- green peaches, delicious sorbet on top of almond crumbles. So good I ate it in two bites.Overall my experience here was great. But with the food, the presentation was outstanding but the flavors did not match up. I was expecting more.

Honestly, this place should probably have a 3.5, but I rounded down because it was really expensive and the mentaiko honestly wasn't something I'd come back for; it felt like something I could make at home, actually. We also ordered the uni risotto, which was a special they had that day. Once again it was good, but not something that I'd go out of my way for. The sushi, however, was amazing and actually very reasonably priced compared to everything else. We ordered the momomaki. I would come back just for the sushi and the sushi deserves 5 stars, hands down.My boyfriend and I also ordered some Japanese whiskey, which was good, but a bit strong for my taste.Overall, it was a lovely experience, but much to expensive for my taste, other than the sushi.

Note that this is a different menu from the upstairs restaurant!So, I wasn't aware that the lounge menu was different so that was a bit disappointing, but then again we were seated right away. Came on a Monday night so they offered an 'Industry Night' special which included a 2 course or 3 course meal. Chose the 3-course of Cured Beef Tongue, Pork Katsu, and the Grape Sorbet. Considering the price, it was a pretty good choice since the katsu was huge. Not much of a dessert person but the grape sorbet was excellent. Apart from the 3-course, I also ordered the Chorizo Uni Toast and the Hamachi Chili Roll. The bread of the uni toast was cut way too thick that it completely overpowered the uni and chorizo...so I just ate the top portion. I really enjoyed the celery pieces on top of the uni. It gave it a small crunch to the toast. The hamachi roll had good chunks of yellowtail with a slight, slight spiciness which I enjoyed.

I'd originally made a res at Oak + Char, but a few days before wished I had made a res at Momotaro instead. While I had heard it could be difficult to get a res at this popular restaurant, but I had a bit of hope for a Monday night. When I originally called they told me they were booked, but when I explained it was our anniversary they very sweetly made room for us. That alone deserves an extra star. Most restaurants are empty at 630pm on a Monday night, but biz was booming here. In fact, by 7pm most of the tables in the restaurant were filled with people enjoying fabulous cocktails and food. My husband and I agreed that everything we ordered was fabulous. Per our waiters suggestion we shared a variety of dishes from the menu: a little sushi, Unagi rice bowl, etc. I was full after a few dishes, but just kept eating as the food came to our table because it was so good. Dessert on your anni is a must and we finished our celebration with some sort of butterscotch pudding that I will definitely be ordering again. We should have ordered 2 since I didn't leave much for my husband, but then again he knows I'm not good at sharing my dessert after 7 years of marriage."], ["Leila T.", "So good! The matcha tea alcoholic drink was so refreshing and tasted amazing. We ordered two rolls, one that was $8 and basic and one that was $16 and more creative. Unfortunately the $16 came to our table first, we finished it, and then 5 minutes later the $8 roll came by and by then we were not impressed with the $8 roll since we just experienced the more creative one with more ingredients.

Definately legit sushi, not some fusion or watered down American version.The service was excellent, attentive, detail oriented, not intrusive, everything I want in service."], ["Tia K.", "The vintage cocktail lounge downstairs is what I came for and I loved it.

The food is fantastic. The service, however, leaves much to be desired and the staff failed to make us feel as if the delay concerned them in any way. The waiter failed to come over for at least a half hour after we were seated. It was an \"also manager\" that finally took out order.I have dined at most of the \"best\" restaurants in Chicago and understand that things happens and sometimes you cannot accommodate everyone. However, I have never dined at a restaurant that made me feel as if service was less of a concern. Even though we fully enjoyed the food, with all the other amazing options in Chicago, I don't believe I would willingly return. To be fair, Adam - one of the managers - spoke to us at the end of the night and was very receptive and respectful. That conversation alone is reason to give it another shot."], ["Alex R.", "Momotaro is a new addition to the Boka Restaurant Group's growing culinary empire; and it's a hit. \u00a0Fresh and delicious menu items, great service, and a cool atmosphere combine to make this a must-visit spot for those craving excellent Japanese food. Sushi has become ubiquitous. \u00a0Make no mistake, this is not your run-of-the-mill restaurant where you'll find rolls liberally covered in spicy mayo to mask the lack of freshness. And while that may be enough to satisfy most cravings, you aren't really tasting the fish. \u00a0Not so at Momotaro; everything tastes fresh. The Sushi Omakese is sure to please. \u00a0The dish comes with eight pieces of the chef's choice sushi. \u00a0Don't be surprised if you're tempted to order another; it's that good. \u00a0The Fu Roll is another popular item, though I wasn't as satisfied as I was with the Sushi Omakese. \u00a0While the flavors were great, I didn't care much for the crunchy bite you get from the beet inside. Other standouts from our meal included the Chili Mentaiko Spaghetti and the A5 Miyazaki Wagyu. \u00a0The spaghetti was delicious and creamy without being heavy. \u00a0For $21, you get three very small pieces in the A5 Miyazaki Wagyu (Santa Barbara sea urchin, shiso ohba), but it's worth every penny. \u00a0The silky texture alone is enough to warrant the price. \u00a0The Washugyu and the Gyutan (\"From the Coals\" menu) were also excellent. \u00a0We tried one of the Donburi Bowls, essentially deconstructed sushi similar in appearance and texture to risotto. \u00a0It was delicious, but I wouldn't say it stood out.This place is highly recommended for great food and drinks. \u00a0Some might bristle at the prices, but they are well worth it for the delicious high quality food you'll get at Momotaro."], ["Renaud S.", "A must-go place in Chicago for Japanese food lovers. Food is delicious, reffined, slightly spicy sometimes, always flavored. Broad choice of wines - we had a red Australian wine which went absolutely well with the meals.I particularly recommend their Momotaro tartare: exquisite!"], ["Laura K.", "Cool atmosphere, extensive menu, and great service.We came in for the sushi, and got talked into a few items on the other parts of the menu. Everything was good, but wished we had just stuck with our original plan because the sushi was good. The sashimi omakase was excellent and we wished we had both gotten our own. The chef selection sushi (the signature maki rolls) were all good, but the options were more limited than I would have expected. I would recommend Momotaro for a solid Japanese meal and would recommend to focus mostly on their sushi."], ["Matt R.", "Expectations were high for dinner last night but things got off to a rocky start. We had a 9 pm reservation and arrived on time. Unfortunately our table was not ready on time. We went to the lounge and were seated 35 minutes later. Along with a few other couples in the same sectionWe didn't have an opportunity to order until 10 pm. I would understand if the place was packed and it was a Saturday so they were busy but we asked the host if they had been slammed unexpectedly and he said the night was very normal and manageable. So maybe they are always late seating their guests? \u00a0A good host would have apologies for the delay without needing to be prompted. \u00a0We received no real apology. \u00a0Food was good but timing was off. We had a lot of dead time between coursing that made us feel like the expediting from the kitchen was off. I would give our wait staff a solid 4 stars as they seemed very knowledgable and did their best to make sure we had a good experience. When shelling out $200 for a romantic dinner I expect the experience to be better given all of the choices in the city."], ["Dr. Wendell P. W.", "We have always had great meals at the magical restaurant creations of Boehm and Katz ~ Girl and the Goat, etc. \u00a0However we were not prepared for the absolutely incredible delicious dinner we were in store for at Momotaro. \u00a0Perhaps it's because we are blessed with so many good Japanese restaurants in our home bases of California and Hawaii.Momotaro is located in a hot new area on Lake Street west of the loop. \u00a0You could tell it was built in an old warehouse, but as soon \u00a0as you enter, you're stunned by its exquisite and beautiful three story open design. \u00a0Then comes the creative and extensive menu. \u00a0There is something for everyone from sushi and sashimi to robatayaki and yakitori hot dishes accompanied by a nicely selected sake, wine, beer and Japanese whiskey menu. \u00a0Our server Paul and the attentive team were never intrusive, but extremely efficient whisking away chopstick wrappers and filling water glasses. \u00a0Now on to the dishes we selected.A delicious miso soup with two types of high quality tofu and kombu. \u00a0Next we ordered ebi tempura made with fresh spot prawns which is one of standards I use at Japanese restaurants. They were \"spot\" on. \u00a0The Momotaro tartare made with fresh tuna had a nice balance of shallots, tomato, shiso, capers with dollops of Maui onion mayo was very good, as well as Mentaiko spaghetti subtly with fish roe and a raw egg ~ like a fish egg carbonara. \u00a0The chicken meatball skewers were good, but the Wa Shugyu skirt steak wrapped around foie gras with grilled shishito peppers \u00a0just melted in your mouth. \u00a0A nice and unique dish was the Aji Yakusigi which was smoked jack mackerel artfully presented in a closed bowl releasing an aromatic smoke when removed. \u00a0It was Oishi! \u00a0We finished with the cedar roasted whole sea bream with shiso dressing which was amazingly juicy and flavorful.Because many dishes had two items per order for the skewers, you could enjoy working your way through this creative and diverse menu. \u00a0We can't wait to return."], ["Kateryna G.", "The review is for the izakaya downstairs.The food: 2.5/5. We had gyoza, chicken karaage, spicy beef ramen and pork tonkatsu. The good: chicken karaage and tontaksu. The bad: gyoza and beef ramen. Chicken karaage was excellent, very tasty breading and no grease. It came with some kind of wasabi(?) dipping sauce, which was ok. I also liked the tonkatsu, although it was a little on the dry side, but again they definitely got the breading right and it was excellent without any grease. Gyoza was ok, nothing to write home about. I wish they would make it the traditional way like Ramen Takeya next door. Now...the beef ramen they have is a travesty. What was that? They say it's served with \"Nagoya\" beef which just means a high quality beef, but it looks and tastes like bland ground beef. The broth is somewhat spicy, but there is absolutely no complexity to it. Sure, the broth doesn't have to be your common tonkotsu or miso, but if it's the spicy ramen it should be a balanced taste of sansho, firm noodles, textural nuts and crisp veggies. The noodles didn't have the right texture either, as they were overdone. Overall, not your traditional izakaya and the food wasn't impressive. On a side note, I was impressed with their selection of Japanese whiskey.The service: 5/5. This is where Momotaro exceeded my expectations. Our waitress was very attentive and knew the menu very well, being able to explain every dish. Once she saw I barely touched my ramen, she asked me why I didn't like it and then took it off the bill. Overall: 3.5/5. I wasn't impressed with the food at their lounge, but the service was excellent, so I'll come back to try their sushi menu."], ["David L.", "Of all the restaurants that I've been to at Chicago so far, this is by far my favorite.

Pretty bad ass if you ask me."], ["Karen C.", "This was one of the best meals I've had in all of 2015. Granted, it's only April, but I have eaten some insanely good shizz these last few months. Anyway...We arrived on time for our reservation, but they said our table wasn't ready yet. Normally, this would really irritate me... a reservation is, you know, a reservation, an agreement that we will be there at said time & our table should be there at said time. But all crankiness aside, we went downstairs and grabbed a cocktail at the basement bar while waiting for our table. I love this basement bar & I would have had no idea this even existed had our table been ready on time, so I guess I'll chalk that up to a win. The service was impeccable... our waitress helped us out SO much and was super personable while doing so. She carefully explained the concept, the items on the menu and how to order. When things started arriving & all of us were overwhelmed & forgetful about what we had ordered, she was right there to tell us again what everything was and who got what.The decor is on point... from little details like the flatware being awesome, the menus being beautiful & the lamps being amazing, I love the style/vibe of Momotaro. The concept... I love the idea that everything is small and you can get whatever you want, but at the same time it was a smidge confusing. For instance, I don't eat beef, but other people at the table eat beef. Some of the items are sold by the piece or two, so you could order exactly what you wanted, but half the time we felt pressured to order enough for the table, even though not everyone would eat the item. It's weird to try to explain, but it can get a little crazy when everyone (myself included) wants just a few specific items for themselves.The food... holy mother of God the food. We ate all the things & I loved everything. The tuna was some of the best I've ever had in my life... melt-in-your-mouth amazing. Everything was seriously so good. Order it all. The only big thing I'm bummed about is that, we ate so much dinner-type food, that there was no room for dessert! Next time, next time."], ["Giorgio F.", "Absolutely delicious. \u00a0The presentation of all the dishes is perfect.I found this restaurant to be in direct competition with Roka Akor. \u00a0Roka is more modern, Momotaro feels more authentic Japanese but the dishes look and taste just the same as Roka is not better!I attended on Saturdya May 30th, during a birthday party so I had the chance to try many different plates. \u00a0The fish was very fresh and tasty. \u00a0The steak with soybean paste was my favorite of the nightI will return to this restaurant in the future!"], ["Sheila C.", "It's a head scratcher really...this place is being hyped up all over the place ... All my girlfriends are talking about it ... That one friend from high school who blogs is reviewing it ... Chicago Magazine distinction...Blah blah blah ... And here's the deal ... It is simply AVERAGE ... Essentially a Suburban sushi joint (think FAR west suburbs ... Practically Iowa) dressed up in a Fulton market neighborhood disguise ...Crab salad dish tasted like Hellman's mayo and crab salad from Costco mixed together...no depth of flavor...no surprise notes - nothing ...Sushi Omakase was so mundane...a piece of salmon plain on rice with no garnish or flavor is your chef's very best on a Friday night?!? The coal dishes were so boring in presentation and taste that even wagyu beef managed to disappoint ... And wagyu beef cooked on hot charcoal should never disappoint ... EVER ...Overall Momotaro is \"NO-NO-taro\" for me ...strip mall sushi joints work harder than Momotaro at a 1/4 of the price ..."], ["Angelo L.", "One of the best restaurants in Chicago. Best Japanese food. The grilled items are amazing, especially the gyu-tan and the wagyu. The sashimi is solid, though I would order the other items next time because they are just so good. The Japanese steak was not too oily and was perfectly cooked. I enjoyed the steak and toro tartares too."], ["Franklin M.", "We were super excited to try this restaurant after reading so many glowing reviews on Yelp. So, it's likely that our expectations may have been at a whole nother level in anticipation of our Valentine's Day dinner but we left not feeling impressed even though we really wanted to like it a lot. Before the Momotaro groupies go berserk, I want to make it clear that our dinner was a pleasant experience, but the wow factor was just missing. Food/Drink:- Monk's journey: this was light, refreshing and a good way to start the night if you enjoy vodka cocktails.- Warlord's bounty: my wife wanted a sweeter cocktail so this is what our server recommended. She liked it, but I was not a fan.- A5 Miyazaki Wagyu: you receive three tiny, bite-size pieces for $21 and you're left wondering where the rest of it went. It was good but I'd skip this if you're looking for something more substantial. - Washugyu: two skewers each with a couple pieces of skirt steak wedged in between shishito peppers. Foie gras is supposedly part of this dish as well but it probably forgot to make an appearance on mine or maybe I scarfed it down too quickly to savor the taste as I was still really hungry after the first dish. - Smoked bacon & eggs: two skewers each with three quail eggs that I think were either wrapped in bacon or doused in some other flavor to make you think it was bacon. I'll admit I was still really hungry after the Washugyu so I devoured this one so that could be why I didn't notice whether the bacon was real. Plus, the richness of the quail eggs overpowers your senses. If you're not a fan of quail eggs, avoid this one. Thankfully, I do like quail eggs but the mix of flavors was not a tasty combination for me. - Glass of riesling & gruner veltliner: we both finished our cocktails by this point and were thirsty for more so we each ordered a glass of white wine before the sashimi omakase came out. These were nothing special.- Sashimi omakase: sushi chef's choice of 9 pieces of sashimi. They split whole pieces into two since we only ordered one for both of us. The highlight was the hamachi (yellowtail) along with the chutoro and ootoro which were medium fat and fatty bluefin, respectively. This was our first time trying bluefin sashimi and we were both very pleased! All of the pieces were very fresh though very thinly sliced.- Diver scallop: once we finished the sashimi omakase, we both looked at each other with that hungry face look and took another spin at the menu. We landed on another dish highly praised on Yelp. This was good but it's basically just one scallop sliced into four pieces along with some uni and ikura so this definitely didn't fill us up. At a $12 price point, I would not order this again. - Momomaki: since we were still hungry and wanted to try more from the rest of the menu, our server recommended this from the makimono (sushi roll) list. We're glad we ordered it as it was our favorite dish of the night. It has big eye tuna on top with spicy octopus rolled into the middle. Pure deliciousness!- Una-Kyu: we were almost at that point of feeling full but still wanted to try one more before moving onto dessert. So, our server asked if we liked unagi (eel) and we both said yes! This had barbecued eel along with cucumber and a spot of some avocado-like sauce. The barbecued eel straight from the coals is what made this one delish...definitely our second fave dish of the night.- Shittori citron cake: a yuzu cake with some yogurt and blood orange. It was light and not too sweet so it was a perfect way to cap our dinner.3 out of 5 stars with the sushi rolls being the highlight. Service:Lisa was great. She walked us through the menu, provided knowledgeable recommendations and was very cheerful and pleasant. The busboy never let our water go empty and the courses came out in a timely fashion. At the end, she did take the signed receipt before we left so I didn't like the strong hint to leave so I'm deducting one star.4 out of 5 stars. Ambience/location:Being situated in the west loop, this place has some stiff competition. It's also right next to the train so if it wasn't for the music and loud conversation noise, we probably would've noticed the train more. The tables are really close to each other though with three floors, you'd think they'd have better spacing. Overall, it still has a cool date night feel but not overly formal so you could definitely rock the jeans here. 3.5 out of 5 stars. Overall, rounding down to 3 stars due to cost/portion sizes. We also went to their lounge downstairs and enjoyed a couple more glasses of wine along with a cheddar and bread dessert. So, we left feeling super full and needing a wheelbarrow to carry us out after that but definitely worth checking out their lounge if you're looking for a chill place to hang out or a nightcap.For my money, I'd rather have the omakase experience at Juno in Lincoln Park any day over this place though"], ["Neeharika V.", "LOVE this place! Been here 5 times since January 2015 .... mostly because my first time there was so good that I wanted to keep going back. Great selection of liquor, amazing sashimi options.

We made reservation a month in advance. Very pretty interior, dimly lit, and busy! Service is great! Our waiter was very attentive of our needs and made sure we were taken care of. The hospitality overall is very good. Onto the food... Small portions, big price tags, but seriously good. The cheapest item we ordered was the seaweed salad at $6. Even the miso soup was $9. It' Was a loaded miso soup with fried tofu and other veggies inside. \u00a0The seaweed salad was good. We ordered the wasabi salmon roll which was fab, had 4 pieces of the fatty tuna and 4 pieces of hamachi nigiri...which were buttery and tasty. We had the FU Roll which was $45 for 6 pieces. That's crazy! Each piece has a specific fish/seafood... Shrimp, scallop, fatty tuna, Santa Barbara uni, Unagi, and king crab with wagyu beef inside the roll. I really enjoy the combo texture of all the stuff inside my mouth. My husband thought it was overrated..there were too much favors inside his mouth that he wasn't able to identify the fish goes eating. We also had chirashi which was good. The chili spaghetti was very good. One of our favorite dishes for the night. It was definitely my husbands fave. We also had the ribeye donburi which was so good. It was sweet and a runny yolk that you mix with the rice and ribs. So delish!We ended the night with two desserts- the shittori blood orange cake sorbet and the chocolate cake. Love the chocolate cake!The bill came out to be $235 for the food (without tip) we ordered and it was just two of us. Definitely will come back!
