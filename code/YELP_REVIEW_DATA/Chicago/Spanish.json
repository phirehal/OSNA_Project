{"Bom Bolla": [], "Emilio's Tapas Sol Y Nieve": [["Mc C.", "This place screams decadence. The food is outstandingly fresh and the service is perfect. Our server Nico was impressively knowledgable about the impressively extensive wine menu. The real MVP is the \"sorpresa de chocolate\" aka \"chocolate sponge cake\". It took everything I had not to order 7 of them. Try it with the white sangria, you won't be disappointed. I think one of the most impressive things is the prices. They are reasonable for the city. Try this place and enjoy."], ["Saba A.", "Emilio's is located in Streeterville area- an area I never go to unless I have a doctor's apt at Northwestern but it was nice to go here for a group dinner on a weeknight. The prices are great, the place is authentic- i felt like I was in Spain, and the space is large enough for a group gathering! We were greeted by two busy hosts, and got seated on a large rectangular table in the middle of the dining room. Our waiter was nice- took our drink orders quickly and our tapas orders were brought in quickly. A wonderful tapa's menu - the patatas bravas were spicy and perfect. One of our beef dishes was full of strong rosemary flavors. The steak dish was generously plated. They were friendly with bringing out extra bread and refilling our drinks quickly. I did a Yelp check in and mis read when we could get a free bottle of house wine- so they brought out complimentary tapas dishes for all of us instead. The strive on being FRIENDLY so it's definitely a warm and welcoming environment. They were happy to split checks even though we requested it at the end. Great food, friendly service, wonderful menu. Was a great place to check out and I wouldn't mind visiting in the summer and sitting on the patio."], ["MT W.", "Open since 1988, almost 30 years, that's a time.Situated in the center of the city, next to Magnificent Mile. We were wandering around Chicago in the day time looking for a place for a small bite and a drink. And we saw this one. We sat outside in the patio, so I have no idea how the place looks inside. But outside it's very Spanish. A nice restaurant and wine bar, offering different varieties of cold and hot tapas and paellas. In their specials they have grilled Octopus, it's amazing. Spanish people know how to cook octopus right. Calmares were a little bit rubbery and oily. Tortilla a la espanola, pan con tomate, jamon serrano, queso de cabra, ensalada catalana, gambas al ajillo - the menu is all in Spanish and sounds so native. But underneath you'll find the translation and the explanation in details of all the dishes of course. On weekends they have special offer for paellas: if you order one (they have four different suggestions: mixed, seafood, vegetarian and chicken with vegetables ), you'll get a free bottle of wine. But some people might think that the wine they give for free (it's two options of white and two for red to choose from) isn't good enough for them and would want to order something more extravagant and fancy.All wines here, except of one which is Malbec from Argentina, are from Spain. A decent selection for reasonable price, interesting choice of cava. For desserts: profiteroles, strawberries with ice cream, fresh Peach casserole under streusel topping with ice cream etc. The Peach casserole was a ok. I have some doubts that the peaches were fresh, looked like canned to me. But still, pretty delicious. And they offer a variety of dessert wines by the way. The server was attentive and helpful.Not luxury place, but delicious, very reasonable prices and good for lunch or just a small bite and drink during your summer walk around the city."], ["Kyle D.", "Overall: 3.5 if I could. Good, well sized tapas, but there's better in the city.The good: Tons of options to choose from, with all sorts of seafood, meat, and veggie items. Good atmosphere and service to match. Prices are reasonable. Lots of seating.The bad: Paella was lacking. Some of the tapas could have been hotter. Took awhile for them to come as well. There's better food elsewhere.Atmosphere: 8/10Service: 8/10Food: 7.5/10"], ["Aurora A.", "It was wonderful to see and reunite with very good friends with a very good place and excellent food.The service is extraordinary .

Is my food actually coming from Spain?! Restaurant was completely unapologetic, so add poor customer service to excessive wait times! If you are hungry go anywhere but here, if you want to spent 3 hours waiting for food have at it!!!!"], ["Iryna Z.", "Wonderful atmosphere, with classy service and incredible food.We were looking forward to Spanish cuisine for a while, we gave Emilio's a try for a romantic night out. What a lovely, authentic restaurant. We made reservations for outdoor seating and even though its on a busy street/touristy it was intimate and romantic. Bottle of fantastic Reserva, small tapas, and seafood paella were to die for. All of the above were very tasty, filling and presented with taste. Service was top notch, starting from lovely hostess ladies to our server. After our dinner we got caught in the rain, so we decided to go back inside the restaurant and hang out at the bar. Again, we were not disappointed drinks were incredible, bartender was entertaining and we got small dish of goat cheese. It was just divine."], ["Deborah K.", "Emilio's is the perfect stop before or after going to the movies at the AMC 21 which is only a few blocks SE of the restaurant. \u00a0The food has been consistently good and we recommend starting with the garbanzo and eggplant. \u00a0Two terrific dishes -- sorry I don't remember their Spanish names. \u00a0There's a very reasonably priced wine list and if you're looking for a red, we recommend the Los Dos. \u00a0The staff is helpful and friendly. \u00a0Check it out!"], ["Brenda D.", "YUM!

Great vibe, just like Spain. The menu is a bit more limited than some Tapas places, but there is a nice variety. We really liked the beef dishes; very tender and good quality. There's also a nice selection of Spanish wines. Service was very friendly, and noise levels are reasonable, even when busy, particularly at the window tables."], ["Lucy W.", "The food is worth a solid 4 stars, add 1 more star for the service.We ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, the lamb leg and the soft shell crab with rice. All three dishes were delicious - lamb was tender and flavorful, the rice in the soft shell crab dish was really good (just wish it's bigger).Oh the smoked salmon appetizer was definitely our favorite. It came with a white sauce, but I think the dish without the sauce is better. The service is notable. We checked in for a free bottle of wine, and apparently it was supposed to be valid only on Sunday, but the server ended up honoring it and took the wine off. During the whole meal, he was also very attentive. I'd come back for the salmon appetizer and the service."], ["Iman W.", "If you sit in just the right seat outside, you'll have an awesome view of Whole Foods. I know, I was \u00a0excited too!First things first, service was great. I was with visiting friends who'd never had tapas before and the waiter was pleasant, he explained how tapas typically works to them, even made some recommendations. He had the patience that I don't, so kudos!The food was okay. I feel like I've enjoyed my meals at Cafe Iberico more, but it was still fairly good. I like the dish with the pureed garbanzo beans. There was another dish made with chorizo that was really good. And rarely can you go wrong with patatas bravas. I ordered the empanada del dia as well, it was probably my least favorite, I felt like it was a bit bland. I honestly found this place just by walking in the neighborhood and if I happened to grow hungry while in that area again, I'd come back (hopefully with more adventurous diners). But I can't say it would be my first choice if I specifically wanted tapas."], ["Trevin S.", "Last night's dinner adventure took us down the magnificent mile on a search for an open table. After two failed attempts and frustrating crowds, Yelp directed us to Emilio's. The restaurant was about 75% full which was a relief from the 150% slam packed restaurants in the sounding area. The decoration was nice and not in your face. Music volume was perfect and not obnoxious. Finally the wait staff seamed genuinely nice and engaging.Three different plates were ordered and the three of us were completely satisfied. Also the servings were not ginormous and a refreshing size. No complaints here."], ["Chuck B.", "We found this place through Yelp, and since my wife and I enjoy tapas places, we figured we'd give it a go.The atmosphere is warm and inviting, the servers were friendly and attentive, the prices were completely reasonable, and the food was excellent. \u00a0You can even find reasonably priced bottles of wine on the menu. \u00a0I thoroughly enjoyed the visit, and would recommend it. \u00a0Would definitely go again."], ["Elsie Y.", "Hanging out with ladies.

On a typical visit, you should get about 2-3 small plates per person. A few favorites- the garlic potato salad is a must have, as long as your date agrees to eat it with you (or doesn't mind extreme garlic breath). The tuna canoli also from the cold tapas is absolutely delicious. From the hot tapas, the Bacon wrapped dates are the perfect combination of savory and sweet, but let them cool before digging in, they're super hot! Grilled shrimp, grilled calamari, and the chicken brochette are also fantastic. If you like octopus, go for the Grilled Octopus under the specials, absolutely delightful- crispy grilled octopus that melts in your mouth. The red sangria is also fantastic, get the pitcher. Oh- can't forget about the banana dessert.... Incredible."], ["Stephen L.", "Great iced tea. Pretty good tapas. Goat cheese dish is better elsewhere. Championes Rellenos were good.

They have a huge restaurant and tables on the patio for summer and nice spring of fall days. Great for people watching. I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to return unless a group of people decided to go. With the big space it's ideal for a group lunch or dinner.I originally have them three stars..

The menu is pretty extensive but definitely overwhelming to look at. I think we ordered a little bit of everything. Items that really stood out for me: Gambas ajillo, queso de cabra, crepe rellena, and Chorizo y morcilla (was so excited that morcilla was on the menu! I haven't had it in years and the last time I had it was in Madrid!). For dessert the platano con helado was my favorite. AMBIANCE- The space is well-designed. The decor reminded me of Spain and felt very culturally authentic. The mouthwash in the bathrooms were appreciated. But something was definitely missing though. It felt weirdly quiet... perhaps the music could have definitely been louder. Maybe the lighting/temperature was off? I just didn't feel cozy and comfortable being in the space. SERVICE- The service was alright. The waiter suggested we order a few tapas and after those came out we could continue ordering. I think that is a good approach to tapas dining, however not when dining with a large group (we had 10 people). We ordered 3 tapas to start with, and they were devoured in 3 seconds. Then we waited for a while before the next round came out, etc. The wait period was too long for me between rounds of tapas. I just prefer when everything comes out all together.

It had some sort of pineapple butter on it, which was amazing. Everything else was meh. Also, the sangria was terrible! It just tasted like straight up wine. If I'd wanted wine, I would've ordered it. Then at the end of the meal the server apparently gave us the wrong check, but none of us noticed. We paid the bill, left the restaurant, and next thing we know someone is running down the block screaming for us to come back. When we get back we were told we were given the wrong check and of course the correct check is more expensive than what we originally paid. Now, I have no problem paying for my meal, but if I've already left the restaurant then that's on you. I really think they should've just eaten the cost.

We had the chef's fixed menu of like 10 items for I think about $55 or 65 per person. It had most popular items. Incredibly tasty and well done.

Definitely will come again."], ["Isabella W.", "A group of 6 of us went here on a Friday night. I made reservations for 7:30 and a table was promptly ready for us. The atmosphere is very relaxing and the place is very clean!I will start off with the drinks. Of course we had to get sangrias! The first one, made with white wine, was a little weak. We told the waitress, but she insisted that it was strong. I guess we are a bunch of alcoholics that have high tolerance. The second sangria we got was made with champagne and this time, it was a lot stronger! The third one was made with red wine and it was very tasty and pretty strong as well.The food was really tasty! We got the Taste of Spain option since it is a little bit of everything that is popular, and some other small plate (that's why it's a tapas place lol). The presentation was very nice and everyone loved the quality of the food! I think my favorite one was the squid. It was very fresh! The spicy potatoes, something that I always get at a tapas place, was just spicy enough, yet not blazing hot, which is what I like. The dessert was unbelievably delicious! We got a tray of different ones, since it came with our meal. The flan was soaked in a coffee cream...fantastic! We also got some chocolate custard pie, vanilla ice cream, and the waitress was nice to throw in an ice cream pastry puff on the house. When we finished, there were nothing but empty plates and satisfied customers =).I would definitely come back! The service is very attentive and great and everything is super clean and organized...even the bathrooms! I would say this place compares to Cafe Iberico or Caf\u00e9 Ba Ba Reeba. However, those two places have things on their menu that I love, but I cannot find in Tapas Valencia. Come check this place out if you have a chance! There's paid meter parking and valet if you don't want to drive around. But beware! DO NOT park in the residential area! There is a sign posted that you need a permit, but it's really small and if you see tickets on other cars, that's usually a sign that you can't park there. I would love to try their goat cheese next time I come back. I usually order that dish every time, but no one in my group likes goat cheese."], ["Dan L.", "My wife and I have been here on a number of occasions and each time we're always really impressed with the quality of the food. In my opinion, its actually the best Spanish Tapas restaurant in Chicago-land...food wise. I would highly recommend the olives, stuffed mushrooms, and the Talapia.The ambiance is a little more low-key than some other tapas restaurants, but that actually makes it a great place for a romantic date or to get a large group together where you can actually talk. Service here is always fantastic and the manager always seems to make it to every table to see how things are going. The only downside is that being on south State, its a little more out of the way and not as central to the rest of the city. You wouldn't go to dinner here and then wander to a nearby pub or bar. With apps like Uber or Hailo though, its pretty easy to get a cab and get back to more lively parts of the city."], ["Jules H.", "Terrific food. Everything we got our tapas on with was delicious! Olives, a nice salad with octopus, beef brochette, chicken brochette with chorizo, nice sized portions for tapas, well priced!Service was good, but a tad off.

It has a different feel than most tapas places--a bit more loft/industrial, which was kind of an odd atmosphere for tapas. However, overall we had a good experience. There was a slight delay in getting waited on, but the eventual waiter made up for it by giving us a complimentary dessert (which I really appreciate--it seems like a lot of places now don't care if they give you bad service and won't even think about comping you with anything). The food was good and the portions were large compared to most tapas places. I would recommend."], ["Liz K.", "I came here when it first opened and then recently with a big group.

Now I was expecting a pretty big bill since I felt like we all ordered so much...but in the end it wasn't bad at all. At least not for what we felt like we ate. Overall, the experience would have been better if service was better. We kept getting food we didn't order and then had to wait forever for some of our dishes. Now I remember it being way better when we first went about 3 years ago...or maybe I just had too much Sangria that day. ;-)"], ["Pan F.", "Street parking was surprisingly easy, and they have valet.

For dessert I had the tarte de chocolate y caramelo. \u00a0Wow~ talk about heavenly decadence! \u00a0By the way, you won't want to share this dish. \u00a0I also tried the platano con helado. \u00a0This is like thier version of a bananas foster. \u00a0If you wanted a lighter dessert, this is a very refreshing dessert."], ["Allison M.", "Love the $5 margaritas, and the friendly wait staff who didn't even mind when I had to plug my dying iphone in.

It was about 80% full, but we experience horrible service (and I say this knowing what it's like to work in the service industry for 10+ years). Waited nearly 40 minutes for our third round of drinks. Another server who was helping out with our table told us he would get the manager to come over because he could sense our frustration, while our own waiter was oblivious. I had to hunt down the manager after 10 minutes of waiting to request that we receive our drinks immediately so we could cash out and leave. He took the final round of drinks off the bill but didn't seem too apologetic that we were neglected for about 40 minutes. Instead, I saw our server running around filling up waters instead of leaving that job to the busboys, which is the norm at most restaurants.The food was good, nothing incredible, but solid tapas food. And I really really enjoyed my mojitos (only $5 on Thursdays along with martinis and margaritas) but I really can't imagine ever coming back to deal with terrible service."]], "Black Bull": [["Walter M.", "As I stated in my Bordel Review I love Spain, but it's the food that to me is the selling point. I was a foodie before a cocktail guy.There is 1 thing that irks me, is how everyone and their mama calls appetizers or small plates the blanket term Tapas, none of them ever been to Spain or even really know what they are all about. To put it more lightly it's like going to a steakhouse, ordering a 45 day dry Prime Ribeye Tomahawk and saying \"I'll have the beef\" as if to differentiate it only from the pork or chicken or fish like at some wedding.This is what I was looking for, a place that differentiates between tapas and pintxos and the prized jamon iberico.I went with the Boquerones, white anchovies and chips, light fresh anchovies. Hontadita de mohama twas but a bite of tuna belly, complex. Langos a ala plancha, squeeze of lemon and ditch the salsa, perfect with your first beer. Mejillones con chorizo was tasty, but could use imo some shallots. No way was I paying for $9 shishitos though. Flamenquines and pulpo a la gallega were great. Serrano and manchego 2 classic Spanish flavors and the garlic chips set it off, needs a sauce to round it out. Octopus was fresh, not chewy, seared well, again missing a sauce.Paella. I was so happy to see they used Bomba rice, offering a negro version and had rabbit offerings. I went with both. I was pleasantly surprise dot see monkfish and baby scallops in the negro, not soupy at all like some other places make it. Cochinillo took a confit suckling pig which is rich and fatty and flavorful and paired it with berries and squash mousse which looked great, but ultimately didn't compliment the flavors. I would have gone with a \u00a0wood ear mushroom and sous vide carrots which gives you the color and texture contrast you are looking for. I was a little bit off put seeing the beloved Iberico ham use to make hamburger patt's, seared and wrapping dates. To me it's like taking caviar and putting it on hot dogs, just watering out it's flavors and pure essence. Next time I come I'm coming for the seafood. Cockles, razors and chipirones. D\u00e9cor is great, service is excellent, but I earned the servers respect early on and was actually greeted by the chef. Great job on some of the dishes, This really makes me miss Spain."], ["Kara B.", "Husband and I had totally planned to go to a different restaurant for dinner, but as we were walking down Division, we both decided Black Bull is a place we had wanted to check out for awhile and it might as well be that night!We were warmly greeted and offered a great table in the back.

We started with the tabla mixta which was just a plate of cheese, fruit, and meats and some herb that was on fire, so that was fun. We split a bunch of other tapas...all were excellent and the service was great.

We ordered a ton of dishes, but here are some of the highlights:-Tabla mixta: a great combo of cured meats, \u00a0cheeses, fruits, and olives. They light some rosemary on fire that is stuck inside the cheese to give off a nice aromatic smell-Pulpo a la gallega/grilled octopus: tender and not overly grilled/chewy-Cochinillo/suckling pig: the star of the night! The meat literally falls apart when you put your fork to it. It also has a nice, fatty texture to the skin (my friend isn't a fan of fatty skin texture so she ended up giving me her share, too - talk about a win!).

We had the octopus, jamon croquettes & the cochinillo - the cochinillo was fun, reminded me of my college days studying abroad in Spain. It was a bit salty for my liking but enjoyable non-the-less. The Octopus was good, not too chewy - croquettes were what you would expect.We split churros for dessert, these were only so so.Overall, the service was pretty slow and we were some of the only people in there.

The waiter was great. He was the right amount of passionate about the food and the restaurant's concept without being annoying. He also immediately fixed our table which was rocking all over the place. We proceeded to order a pitcher of red sangria and i had a Gin and Grapefruit tonic. The drinks were refreshing and interestingly presented in a medicine vial (Sangria) type thing. Thank gosh the waiter poured them. We also got an assortment of tapas, including the Empanada Gallega, Pulopa a la Gallega, Croquetas De Pollo & Jamn, Vieiras con Jamn Ibrico (scallops), Dtiles Con \u00a0Tocino, and a brussel sprout salad topped with Quail Egg. This was split between five girls and we probably could have ordered a few more dishes as I don't think anyone left feeling super full. Everything was flavorful and nicely presented but several dishes (like the brussel sprouts salad especially) were served lukewarm. Also the bus boys were overly zealous and kept yanking plates out from underneath people, it was seriously annoying. I literally asked the kid \"where are you going with my plate??\" when he took mine away. Really?? I didn't understand it because the restaurant was NOT super busy so I don't think we needed to accommodate the next reservation or something. Nothing was really amazing in my opinion except for the free deserts we got. One was free for the yelp checkin (Blueberry Cheesecake) and the other was a lava cake for the birthday girl. The Lava cake was amazing. There was also a few drinks on the menu I would not have minded trying. I may come back for the ambiance and to check out more drinks and hopefully for that cake!

The patatas bravas were not great, they lacked flavor and we're just ok (nothing like the real Spanish patatas bravas. The alioli lacked garlic). Then we ordered pulpo a la gallega.... Complete disaster. It looked and tasted nothing like pulpo a la gallega. There was so much... Way too much paprika, the chunks were so so small and the actual octopus was not fresh.The service was Just ok. The waiter seemed distracted and not very attentive. The owners (or managers) were drinking sitting at the bar on their computer not going by the tables to see how things were (they were Spanish, so maybe they didn't speak English but we were clearly speaking Spanish at the table). The lady (owner or manager) did not come by our table once. (There were literally three tables taken in the restaurant). I've worked in restaurants for many years..

The quail egg gets its own +. My friend who loves brussel sprouts said that these were just okay. Crispy Potatoes with salsa & aioli - I enjoyed the crunchy exterior of the potatoes and the soft interior. Salsa & aioli helped the potatoes along quite a bit. Mini hamburgers with spicy potatoes - Hands down the best dish of the night. Pricey for two hamburgers that are smaller than the size of my palm but 1) They are adorable 2) Taste delicious. Again, a + for the quail egg (can you tell I like these?) Spicy potatoes were fabuloussss. I need someone to cook this for me. Grilled octopus with potatoes - I'm happy to say that I tried this even though octopus freaks me out. For octopus lovers, you might like it. It's like calamari, just not fried. Blueberry Cheesecake - Um, choose 1 free dessert for checking in on Yelp! This was a great ending to our late afternoon sidewalk meal. It was not too sweet nor was it too dense for a cheesecake.

When she returned, we ordered pulpo (our fav thing), queso de cabra, patatas bravas, clams and datiles which were subpar.

It was definitely nice, but also pretty casual. Appetizer:We shared the octopus. It was very sweet of them to just split it into 2 plates for us so it was very easy and clean to share. I wasn't thrilled about the food itself as it I found it pretty lacking in flavor.Entree:- Pork Collar - it was a very tender and well roasted piece of pork indeed. Not a fan of the dead looking vegetables on the side.- Lamb shoulder - same thing. The actual chunk of meat was cooked to perfection. The lentils that came with it? I think not. Normally I think the side things a main dish is served with should bring out the best of the dish, but here somehow they achieved the opposite effect?Dessert:Olive oil cake! It was decent, nice and spongy and not too sweet, topped with some cream and rasberries for a contrast in flavor. Didn't blow my mind though.At the end we each had a drink, shared the appetizer, each had an entree, then shared a dessert. Nothing was spectacular. The bill came out to be $120 before tip. I'm all about shelling out for food, but at that price I can have a lot more bang for my buck elsewhere."], ["Melissa N.", "Came here for dinner on a Saturday night. Food and service were very good and ambiance is okay. I think the food is a bit overpriced even by Chicago standards, though, hence my lack of enthusiasm. Drink prices are good but extraordinarily high. We couldn't find a bottle of red that looked good for under $50. We lucked out on the appetizers: the burrata, the octopus, and the watercress salad were great. The sausage pepper dish was good but not as good as I expected (not a fan of soggy peppers). For an entree, I had the grilled hanger steak, which was excellent. We shared flan and a spiced cake of some sort for dessert, and both were lackluster (the cake was especially blah: super dry). Overall, I had a nice evening but things just didn't live up to my expectations."], ["Kevin T.", "After recent visits to other highly touted restaurants that failed to meet my expectations (looking mainly at you, Parachute), my expectations heading into this place were cautiously optimistic at best.Once our appetizers arrived, all doubts about the place melted away. \u00a0Every dish I tried was delicious and presented beautifully. \u00a0For myself, I had ordered the grilled pork jowl and it may have taken the spotlight from even the entrees. \u00a0Amazingly tender with the perfect balance of flavors. I'm drooling just remembering it (I shouldn't be typing reviews just before lunchtime...)The other dishes I managed a taste of were the serrano, the scallops, and the tripe.For my maincourse, I had the whole lobster over rice. The lobster was a bit overcooked for my liking, but only slightly. \u00a0The flavor of the dish overall, however, was phenomenal. \u00a0My dish may have been slightly overshadowed by my friend's duck dish. \u00a0The duck was perfectly cooked and the foie gras was maybe one of the best I've ever had in this city!Overall, Salero has found a place in the heart of my belly. \u00a0Recently, there has been a lack of restaurants I've tried that I would want to revisit again so soon, but Salero seems to have bucked that trend."], ["Lorenzo L.", "The food we ordered was nicely prepared, and beautifully served. \u00a0And in all honesty, I really enjoy a place where I can eat an awesome dinner, and go dressed in jeans. \u00a0But the service at Salero was not commensurate with the prices. \u00a0There is a certain modicum of service most of us \u00a0expect when a la carte entrees range from the mid $20-$30 and the wines by the glass are from $14-$23. \u00a0( I'm just saying...OK?) \u00a0Granted, we dined here on a Saturday night. \u00a0I call it amateur night, because \u00a0if a place has any flaws, they will always creep out \u00a0on a busy night . That exact scenario played itself out on our visit, \u00a0 I phoned to let the house know that we were running a \"few\" \u00a0minutes late, and was queried abruptly as to \"how many minutes?\". \u00a0When we arrived, the host at the door had the same \u00a0imperious attitude . \u00a0 It must have been the same person I spoke with on the phone a few minutes prior. \u00a0Our server came to the table within 3 minutes, and asked if we were ready to order dinner. \u00a0We hadn't even seen the wine list yet or ordered a cocktail! \u00a0 I had to flag him down to get his attention after we had perused the menu and made some decisions. \u00a0 Between the abrupt host and the frenetic server, I have no hesitation in saying that Salero has some issues with the front of the house that need addressing. \u00a0 The kitchen has it together."], ["Jackie M.", "I went there for the prefix lunch - 3course for $25.

For a spanish cuisine, the flavor was light and not full of spice. \u00a0The food presentation was beautiful. The pork belly was very lean and not fatty at all. The flan was very smooth and flavorful. It's one of the better flan I've ever had. The garlic soup is more of a french onion soup, except the base and the flavor is lighter and not salty. For the scallop, it came with 2 jumbo scallop made medium and just right. It taste like regular seared scallop where you can order from any better seafood restaurant, (except here for a better price) where the flavor was accented by the pesto sauce. The churro was fried fresh which it took awhile to prepare. Otherwise it was a very enjoyable lunch."], ["Juieta C.", "I love Spanish food hence was quite excited to check this place out. Luckily we had a reservation since this place was packed on a Friday night.

Out of these 6 dishes, I thought the crab and the flan was okay. Rest - meh. Burrata wasn't creamy, jamon was cut too thick, lamb somehow didn't hit the spot and the churros (which I I came here) wasn't as crisp as I would I liked it. On the positive though, service was good."], ["svetlana k.", "Cozy Spanish restaurant, great date spot. A bit expensive. For two drinks, two appetizers, and two entrees= $122 without tip. The food also did not stand up to the prices. The cocktails were reasonably priced at $12 and were probably the best part of dinner. Started off with grilled octopus ($14) and sweetbreads ($17). The grilled octopus was served with foam on top. I hate foam, it looks like spit and the texture is awful and it has NO place on an octopus. Definitely not visually appealing. The octopus didn't have that grilled crisp skin or that charred flavor that I love. It was a bit too soft in texture but at least not rubbery. It was served with flash cooked quinoa, actually really good much better than the octopus itself. The sweetbreads dish was tiny, especially for $17. Sweetbreads is the cheapest portion of \"meat\" you can purchase, for that price there should definitely be more served. The sweetbreads themselves were fine, nothing out of this world. The carrot pur\u00e9e it was served with was delicious. I would have rather ate the carrot pur\u00e9e and I do really like sweetbreads in general. For entrees, my friend and I ordered pork belly ($25) and a seafood stew ($33). It wasn't a typical pork belly, more like an actual piece of pork meat, not very fatty at all. Unfortunately, it wasn't falling off the fork kind. Had to actually use the knife and chew through it, wasn't melting in my mouth, had better pork bellies elsewhere in the city. The seafood stew was pretty large, came with scallops, fish fillet, mussels, and some fingerling potatoes. The seafood itself was cooked perfectly but not much flavor. There wasn't much soup happening in the dish. Overall, it was a tasty dish but nothing to write home about. It left me begging for more flavor. It would have been better if served with bread to soak up some of the liquid. This restaurant left me begging for more flavor. I can't say I was impressed or that I will be rushing back to come back and tell all my friends about, unfortunately. I will come back for a drink at the bar as it is super cozy and they offer bar bites. But I would recommend skipping the dinner itself."], ["Jaclyn H.", "Excellent!!

The food was spectacular and authentic, there was a great wine list & the waiter made great recommendations. I highly recommend the octopus and shrimp with heads, I split these with two others, and then split an entree which was delicious and well sized for the three of us. It's a bit pricier, but worth it for the quality."], ["John G.", "First of all the food was wonderfully prepared, however, the spices were on the edge of my comfort zone. The octopus was a favorite with a nice char over a delicious salad. The sepia was out of my taste zone but others loved it. The shrimp with heads was also quite good. We split the Lubina, which was perfectly cooked but had that taste of spices that kept throwing me throughout the meal. The deserts really shined. The flan with blood orange was outstanding and the churro were light as air. Drew did a great job of explaining our meal and made good suggestions. They had a nice selection of Spanish whites and our favorite was the Eidos."], ["Blake M.", "This is my wife's favorite restaurant. I agree with her that this is an awesome place.

We were delighted by our first visit to Salero.Cocktails and wine selection were interesting and good.Even the salad was distinctive. Nuts, blue cheese slices, and freshness that is not to be taken for granted. The trio of rabbit made an intriguing entree, including a homemade sausage, a fricase of the leg, and a tender breast. Delicious vegetables and a beautiful presentation.Our server was professional and friendly, too. She offered advice without steering."], ["Sofia J.", "Just the fact that their dinner menu is far superior to lunch menu takes away a star (based on my lunch experience I wouldn't come back or recommend, but having looked at the dinner menu I'm very eager to return).Garlic soup - tastes more like an onion/vinegar soupAnchovies (gilda & boqueron pintxo)- gave anchovies another try, still turned off, too salty, especially when paired with salty/sour condiments. If you order this, ask for bread.Cabeza croqueta - deliciousBurrata - great combination w/sweet blood orange preserves, buttery endive, & morcilla- just wish it wasn't on toast - the bread was too crusty, biting through the incredibly soft toppings and creating a mess/ripping apart your upper palate is undesirable. Halibut - enjoyable light dish (great use of fresh spring vegetables), but not something I would order again in a restaurant, too simple for my taste. Flan de Queso Fresco - outstanding, GET THIS. Blood orange, caramel, and fresh cheese flavor and texture bomb. Best part of our meal.On a service note - lunch took too long. The first few dishes came out quickly and then we waited a while before the entree came out (acceptable for dinner, not for a weekday lunch). Our busser kept forgetting to bring silverware with the food, adding to the wait time (I would rather wait 5 extra seconds but get the utensils required to eat the meal with).LOVE the decor!"], ["Katie P.", "I am a small person, but I eat a lot of food. \u00a0This was not the place for me."], ["Mark A.", "It would be in poor form to start off this review and not compliment the service. We had a fantastic waitress who knew the menu and drink list, and I always appreciate front of house staff who demonstrate they are familiar with each plate/glass.So Salero has a good PR buzz going on right now, and what made me book a reservation was its inclusion in Eater's \"must eat right now\" spots in Chicago.Some reviews have said this is the \"King of Spanish Cuisine.\" And on the Salero FB page, it calls itself a Spanish Restaurant.My friends, Salero is a contemporary American restaurant with some Spanish touches. It is far from being a Spanish restaurant. (And there's absolutely nothing wrong with this, but I don't appreciate the \"lie\" -- if it quacks like a duck, and walks like a duck, then it's a duck.)The menu has small plates/starters and main courses sections. And each dish tends to have something Spanish about it, whether that be saffron, sherry, manchego, or chorizo. But they're not necessarily Spanish dishes, if that makes sense?Ok, I'll stop whining about the bait and switch. Let me talk about the food:- Olives = fine.- Morcilla/Foie Gras = good; deconstructed so it was challenging to get all the flavors in one bite (which is what makes the dish good)- Scallop crudo = smelled horrible but tasted fine; good flavors- Chorizo stuffed quail = looks great on paper, just average in person- Duck Breast = cooked to my liking (rare), skin was soggy (if I'm going to eat fatty duck skin, I like it crispy), croquette was boring as was the mushroom preparation- Txuri = average; it wasn't bad, but nothing I'd ever crave- Zarzuela = again -- average, somewhat bland, but if that's what you want in a dish, it's probably okAgain, I need to reiterate the service was very good. But even if I know the nicest waiter in the world, if he/she works at a restaurant I don't like, then I probably won't be seeing them much.The food was ok (also, I'm a Wood fan), but I fail to see how this could be in the same category as Iberico/Mercat/Vera as a Spanish competitor. I won't be rushing back and probably won't recommend it since there are much better places in Chicago."], ["Meatdowntown C.", "Undoubtedly, the best Spanish recipes ever! \u00a0The duck a la plancha is phenomenal.

Happy Anniversary was printed on our menu's and Chris wished us a happy anniversary as soon as he came to our table. The food was excellent! There were many layers of flavors to each dish as well as thoughtful surprises on each plate. We had a four course meal but the food was so light that we didn't feel stuffed and heavy.

It was a Thursday night and we had made a reservation so we were seated right away by the nice man at the door. The place was pretty busy for a Thursday.Love the decor and environment. Urban yet sophisticated. No complaints about the food!! Everything was delicious! We had olives and the Spanish mackerel to start then moved on to the duck breast and the lobster. The flavors and portions were perfect. Finished it off with the churro. Fried deliciousness. Out bottle of wine was really great as well. Ok, the service. That is my reason for 3 stars. I don't know if she was new or what, but she wasn't great. She wasn't super attentive or friendly and when we told her we needed just a few more minutes, she didn't come back for a good long while although we could see her at other tables. I had to set our menus out on the end of the table so she could get a clue to come back. I used to be a server myself so things like this really bother me.Another thing is that she hardly looked at me once. She spoke only to my fiance whenever she was at the table. RUDE. She even had her body facing away from me and towards him the entire time. I know he's cute, but COME ON.Every other person who worked there seemed extra friendly to us except for our server. I am definitely open to returning because the food and wine was stellar. Hopefully we will get another server."], ["Marcio R.", "This is a great quality Spanish restaurant. Not your usual tapas place. This was our 3rd visit and it was PERFECT. Appetizers: oxtail and pulpo. Main: duck (awesome). Desert: churro. Waiter Christopher was highly professional and generous."], ["Mihir P.", "I had a wonderful lunch here at Salero. The decor is modernly rustic if that makes sense? Probably not.I really can recommend everything we ordered including the MARCONA ALMONDS, JAMON CROQUETAS (loved the smokey romesco sauce), and SCALLOPS A LA PLANCHA. My friend had the special short rib grilled cheese I think, and she loved it.Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable. They also have a nice bar area, so I'd come back."], ["Polishbadger D.", "This is an overdue review, so here we go. \u00a0I have had drinks and pintxos twice here and each time the service, beverages and food were delectable. \u00a0The location is clutch, near the el and tucked among other great places in the West Loop on Randolph Street. \u00a0Between my two visits I ordered every pintxos that was on the menu (minus the anchovies, can't do it). Top 3 faves are the QUIMET & QUIMET, PAPAS BRAVAS and JAMON IBERICO. \u00a0As for drinks, I stuck to my old stand by (dirty martini, vodka, up, olives), but others I dined with enjoyed a variety of the cocktails offered.After my first time here, I noticed that some people would go in a separate door and up a staircase. \u00a0Of course, curiosity got the best of me, so I inquired what was going on over there. \u00a0The lovely owner, Franco, came over and told us it is a private event space and offered to let us check it out. \u00a0The timing was perfect, because I was looking for a smaller venue to hold a professional event for work.If you are looking for a unique, ideally located, versatile, but not too huge space to host an event, you \u00a0must check this place out. \u00a0The event coordinator, Ashley, is a cut above the rest when it comes to planning and making your event perfect down to \u00a0the last detail. She is easy to get in touch with, has great ideas and in general is a fabulous person. \u00a0Pricing is very reasonable, especially for the neighborhood."], ["Ben K.", "Wow. Every bit of the night was amazing. The cocktails before dinner were delicious without being overpowering. The bar appetizers were phenomenal especially the Jamon croquettes. So delicious. The rest of the dinner continued to be above expectations. The small plates were terrific and I really loved the scallops. My favorite large plate was the rabbit though it's perhaps discontinued. The salmon was also tremendous. The three desserts we had were amazing. If you're looking for a great dinner in a relaxed environment you should check this out. Great for a romantic dinner or for a group outing. It's really perfect."], ["John S.", "OK, the food here was truly wonderful. \u00a0Appetizers included the grilled octopus, jamon and the quail. \u00a0It was very flavorful, nice presentation and good portions. \u00a0For our main dish, we had the halibut and the whole lobster, all perfectly cooked and accompanied. \u00a0The wine and cocktail menu was extensive, and the servers were very attentive. \u00a0I look forward to returning someday soon!"]], "Cafe Marbella": [], "Bulerias Tapas Bar": [], "Papa's Cache Sabroso": [], "Caf\u00e9 Iberico": [], "La Taberna Tapas on Halsted": [["Mironda R.", "Warm greeting, warm decor, live music, attentive staff, a variety of options. I wanted this place to be good. I wanted it to be great. It has all the makings of awesomeness, but it fell short by accounts of the food and unfortunately the sangrias.My friend and I tried to move across the spectrum from the daily specials, to frequently ordered tapas, to everything else.. and mostly were disappointed. We had:Fried smelts with smoky chipotle aioli - *shakes head*Chicken Croquettas - the fillings went soo wrong herePatatas Bravas - *sighs*Grilled Chicken Breast with yellow curry with saffron rice - *winning*Shrimp Ceviche with malanga chips - the chips were the best part. It wasn't terrible but it was bland in a sense.Flight of Sangrias - nice way to see the offerings, the classic is the best.Empanadas de Manzana with Vanilla Bean Gelato - *heavenly*The only thing they nailed was the chicken breast/yellow curry and the dessert. I would soo go back for both, but maybe after having dinner in the area. The musicians were great also.Looking forward to trying some of the other recs from the yelpers."], ["Julie M.", "This is a great modern tapas spot. I went to high school right around this area, and I was shocked that in the past ten years that so much has changed. The area is busy, but not so super-crowded that I wasn't able to get a parking spot right near the door. We arrived at 7 for a birthday party and by 8 most of the tables were full. I liked their twists on traditional tapas, like adding spicy mayo topping to the tortilla espanola. It isn't traditional tapas, but there are many other spots in the city for that. In addition to sangria, I loved the lime in the coconut cocktail, cider vodka and champagne margarita.We had a large party with multiple tables and they brought out our pre-ordered tapas quickly, but after that service was spotty. I think it was pre-arranged to go the bar for drinks, so I just did that. But I know some in the party complained because the server didn't come back to the table to get their drink orders. I wished that the server had come by more to check on us, because I was thinking of ordering more tapas, but I didn't have the chance. I will just have to go back another time."], ["Brooke B.", "Went here for a quick bite on Memorial Day...on off-hours, around 2pm. Sat outside on the balcony. There were about 4 other tables dining and a few people at the bar.La Taberna sangria...good choice. Mondays have $4 sangria and I was all over it. It was yummy, would've liked more fruit though.Got the ceviche, which another Yelper described as a bottled shrimp cocktail. I'd have to agree. It was a little sweet, which was strange and had the consistency of something between salsa and tomato sauce. WIth bits of shrimp...I don't even think there were pieces of fish in there.We also got a cheese plate that was served with \"fig chips\". Really, there were no crackers and no bread served (we had to ask). The fig chips were more like something you'd find in the center of a Fig Newton...nothing to scoop and hold. Also a disappointment.Service was mediocre. We were brought the wrong dish, but sent it back before touching it...from someone like a bus boy. And we had two different servers that obviously weren't communicating, as they replicated their service to us. This place wasn't busy enough to have a day of bad service on top of everything else.The lowlight of our meal was the Duck, off of the Entrees from the Grill. It states that it's grilled duck, served with carmelized figs and asparagus, and spicy raspberries. Sounds good, right? Uh, no. The duck was so overcooked we could hardly chew it and struggled to even cut it. Actually, it looked like it had been cut a long time prior to us being served it (like before it was even cooked). For pre-summer, this would've been lovely with fresh raspberries, but instead we were served a warm raspberry/strawberry/blueberry liquid that reminds me of the stuff you defrost from the grocery store to put in smoothies. Absolutely no flavor, completely flat. And figs? None. The asparagus was good to me, but my fiance thought they were overcooked.This place looked like it had potential. A cool, inventive drink menu...that alone may bring me back for a drink. But so, so disappointed in the food. There's too many other options out there to be served food this crappy."], ["magic g.", "Decor n service is great.Food on the other hand ...Sorry to say, but after living in Basque Country for 6 months and have tasted so many delicious tapa and fusion taco places in Chicago ... this food might be made from Spanish recipes, but by a gringo chef. The finishing touch is missing the flavor or even salt! Calamares a la plancha were tough. If you want Rioja & real spaniord food go to Cafe Iberico"], ["Bettina S.", "This is a great place for a group because there are so many items on the menu, and although it's centered around small plates, it's great for sharing. \u00a0The flavors are different than most other tapas that I've had although they do have some tried and true favorites. \u00a0If you have nothing else, please please try the flight of sangria. \u00a0It takes delicious to a whole new level. I make a pretty mean sangria, but they put me to shame with two red and one white wine selection. \u00a0They also have a nice little outdoor patio which is perfect for a warm day. \u00a0The staff is friendly and very helpful with making selections. \u00a0I will definitely try La Taberna again."], ["Steph V.", "My new favorite restaurant!!!

Great service, nice romantic spot with a guitarist that plays live. Loved it!!"], ["Mariya S.", "I decided to talk down the street and have some tapas to go. My experience was not great at all. I have ordered the meatballs that were very very dry. The potatoes with the octopus were loaded with oil, literally a full think layer of oil at the bottom. It was gross! last but not least I ordered the calamari that were super rubbery and impossible to chew. The only reason this place is even getting a star is because the one good thing they had was the apple turnover.So save yourself some time and money and go to a better tapas place!!!"], ["Heather L.", "Went to this place with my girlfriends for dinner today - it was a pretty heavy disappointment. A genuine tapas place in University Village would have been a hit. However, the owners are doing themselves a big disfavor by skimping on.... pretty much everything.(The staff and the live music was the only plus.)First of all, it would be a good idea to get a real sign for the front of the house, the plastic banner is getting old.Secondly, the food:- When you advertise \"Black Tiger Shrimp,\" I did not expect shrimp poppers from Popeyes.- The Dates were okay, not mind-boggling. Again, I get that this is tapas, but don't serve three or four fingerling sized, microwave quality amuse-bouche for $10.- The flavors of the Queso de Cabras were not very well coordinated - goat cheese on tomato soup, eh.- The La Taberna Paella is dry and tasteless. Is there even saffron in it?Not too late to turn this new place around, but there is a LOT of work to do."], ["Annie R.", "I've been to La Taberna twice, and I had a great experience both times! The sangria is definitely my favorite part of this place. I tried a variety of tapas, including patatas bravas, gambas al ajillo, and la taberna paella. They were all delicious! This is a great spot in the neighborhood, and it's something different instead of another sports bar. During the summer, they open up the patio - lights are hung all around and sometimes have a live entertainment. It's a really relaxing and sweet experience on a beautiful summer day. Don't forget to try the seasonal sangrias!"], ["Liz K.", "Nice looking place...Great drinks & Sangria (loooved the sangria flight). At first I did not want to try the flight because they said that one of the sangrias had like jalapenos...but it was sooo good.Like most places the Bacon Dates were great.....The patatas bravas were averageThe grilled eggplant was very goodand from the other tapas we ordered...well I cannot rememberFrom the food and service nothing really stood out as amazing(I have been to many tapas restaurants)...but I really liked the sangria."], ["Steven N.", "We've been here a few times now and we confirmed that, ironically, their tapas just don't hit the spot for us. However, we like everything else about this place...especially their paellas and desserts. Like one reviewer said, it's a quiet, non-super busy place and that's part of the charm. They have live music on the weekends and it just adds to the relaxed atmosphere of this place. This is a great neighborhood gem, I hope they stick around for a very long time so my wife and I can get our paella fix whenever we feel like it!"], ["Oceans L.", "So this place recently started to do delivery via DiningIn.com, and that's how I've tasted their food so I cannot rate on their in-house service or anything.But I ordered their delivery, which arrived on time to what was promised on the delivery site, so I'll give them a star for promptness (Although I don't know why it actually had to take that long since I literally live 2 blocks away. Yeah I could have picked up the food but I'm lazy and it's cold right now).Anyway, I ordered the Taberna Paella which was DELICIOUS. LOVED IT. WILL ORDER AGAIN. But I am a paella whore and love paella in general... But here are the star winning points for the paella anyway:Quality of seafood and ingredients was terrific, which is what wins this place 4 stars on a very shallow experience:Mussels were NOT overcooked = tender and juicy, not rubbery or too raw.Shrimp was soft and flavorful, not watery nor bland.The paella rice was not mushy which can often happen, but this came fluffy and well seasoned.Also ordereed the taberna flatbread pizza, which was flavorful, although the bread was slightly soggy because it's delivery but I'll deal with that. No stars off.Overall, I had a good experience with their delivery.

I came on a Friday during 1PM and it was not busy with only a handful of tables occupied. I decided to try the lunch special, which comes with a serving of Patatas Bravas, 2 choices of tapas and the dessert of the day for $12. Sounds good! While the staff was friendly, the food (which is why you go to a restaurant) was SUB-PAR. I don't know who the chef in the kitchen was, but he/she may not know what salt is and therefore almost everything I tried was grossly under seasoned. Patatas Bravas: the only good thing I ate here.Crema de Champignones (mushroom soup): an overwhelming olive oil taste, really did not taste like anything else besides.Queso Fundido: tasted like they used some fake cheese, no seasoning whatsoever, the only saving grace were the ancho and chile sauces.Flan: I'm guessing since this is the free dessert that you get, they totally skimped on ingredients and/or made it first thing in the morning because it was just a gelatinous mass of yucky. So gross I didn't finish it.It also took FOREVER for me to get my check to pay and was truly an inconvenience since I had someone waiting for me. Safe to say, I will not be coming back.
