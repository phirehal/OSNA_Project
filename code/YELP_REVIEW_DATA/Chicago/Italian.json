We were audibly assaulted by the noise of the street level place, the live music being more a cacophony than background, and the place was packed with people, the closest of which were families with children (hotel guests perhaps?)But I digress. The reason I mention the audio rampage upstairs was that it only served to heighten the disparity with the tranquility below ground. It was...as quiet as a tomb...but not at all in a bad way. One wall lined with wine, the other I believe had a fireplace, a small bar at the back with perhaps four barstools, and a curing room at opposite, with meats and cheeses hung on display.Elliot, our waiter, was present without being overbearing, steered our wine choices toward the more flavorful (even if more expensive) wines and told us the top selling plates. By the third small plate, and glass of wine, we were sated. The burrata was divine. I shall return."], ["Crystal G.", "Favorite hidden gem in Chicago! We travel to Chicago from Central Wisconsin.

You walk into Francesca's and go down a flight of stairs that I would never have noticed. Suddenly you'te in a rustic wine cellar, with low mood lighting and leather chairs. This place is primarily a wine bar. If you come here with the intention to eat a full meal, their selection is very limited. It is mostly just appetizers, and there are three main course dishes that are all pasta (which is a problem if you're on a diet). The truffle egg toast is very delicious, I recommend it, I love anything with a runny egg on it. The ravioli was good, but it's a small portion that I gobbled up in a minute. The Staggioni pasta was ok according to my friend, just a bit salty. Come here to get boozed up on wine and share some small dishes I'd say. Good for a date!"], ["Larry C.", "Stopped by for a dinner since the environment seemed romantic and the food looked good...environment is definitely 5 stars...in a wine cellar with rocks/stones as the wall and dimly lit...but the food started with a bang with the eggplant meatballs!!

First of all, let me warn you that you will go through a glass door that says \"DiSotto Enoteca\" to get into the building but the restaurant you walk in to is NOT Disotto. Disotto is actually downstairs and what you walk in to from the street is Francesca's. My sister and I made that mistake and we were seated at Francesca's thinking it was DiSotto. Luckily we had an amazing waiter who allowed us to order from the DiSotto menu even though we were seated at Francesca's. Now on to the food. Food was delicious but very heavy! We had the pork belly with figs, egg in bread thing, burrata, and beet salad. The egg in bread thing, though it looked really cool, had too much bread IMO and was pretty blah - my least favorite. My favorite was the burrata. Soooo delicious and enjoyed the next day as well.

The space itself is located in the cellar level of Francesca's on Chestnut which is connected to the Seneca hotel. A separate door entrance can be found next to the hotel.Our dinner featured a 3 course menu and open bar and took place in the entire Disotto space from 5:30pm to 9:00pm. The food was great - portioned as an Italian meal should be. If I were to make a suggestion, it would be to be mindful of the time allotment for a private event. When 9:00pm hit, the space was open to the public and even though we were still wrapping up, strangers were able to wander into the space. All in all, a home run for a private dinner event.

Hidden away under the bustling Francesca's, it was quiet, dimly lit, and cozy - the perfect ambience for a romantic evening or glass of wine with friends. One star for ambience and one star for wine. Everything else was a complete flop.The food was nothing special. The cheese and meat we selected were just ok although the fig accompaniments were flavorful. The burrata was bland served with equally tasteless tomatoes. As for the eggplant meatballs other reviewers raved about, I was disappointed. They just tasted like cheese, which is probably why people liked them. Who doesn't like a deep fried ball of cheese? As for the sauce they came in, it was too salty and almost inedible.The service. Oye the service. Nonexistent and poorly trained. Upon asking our waitress \u00a0 how a certain cheese tasted, her response was \"semi firm.\" Um ok. When we got the cheese we realized it was a blue. Pretty sure that would've described it accurately. Given that there are only a few cheeses on the menu, it's not too much to ask that your server is knowledgable about them. She never stopped by while we were eating to check on things, only after we were finished to ask if we wanted anything else. At one point, we sat with dirty dishes in front of us for about 5 minutes. Just waiting for someone, anyone, to remove it from the tiny table. Had the place been larger and she had more tables to wait on, I would've understood her inattentiveness. However, the place is small and she only had a few tables. Not acceptable.I would recommend this place for wine only.

The small plates of DiSotto isn't ideal for a dinner, but we were able to order from the regular menu of Francesca's upstairs which turned out to be pretty great too.Loved the ambiance at DiSotto, surrounded by wine caves and wine bottles and hushed tones all around, it feels like an escape from the crassness of downtown - agree with several Yelpers here that DiSotto may be one of the most under-rated winebars in town, let's keep it that way!"], ["Amy D.", "After a good fill of fun Chicago dive bars, I was ready for a nice glass of wine. \u00a0I did a Yelp search and Francesca's quickly pulled up. \u00a0We walked in, it was nice but the typical restaurant bar atmosphere.I see a stairwell and inquire of \u00a0the bartender what is downstairs.

Very generous portion for the price, and it featured some excellent prosciutto. Highly recommended.The pastas are all made in house. The gnocchi was great, tagliatelle was excellent, sauces were so good, and the portions will satisfy even the hungriest diners. The only notes I have are related to the service.

I don't see any reason to pay fifteen dollars for pasta with marinara and peas. Not very filling. Just not a spot for people who don't like to burn their money. It was a very nice set up inside, and the staff was attentive and even helpful with recommendations. (Not just looking to tack on the bill, but actually helpful and knowledgeable. They pitch well.)

We had pasta (forgot what we had, but it was great) and then went downstairs to their Speakeasy for a post-dinner drink. \u00a0We promised that when we returned, we'd try the pizza made in their wood-burning pizza oven. Fast forward more than a year later and we made our way our to Letizia's from our River North hotel. The restaurant was weirdly empty, but oh well! \u00a0No one to judge us for eating too much. And bonus: we learned that Tuesday and Wednesday are $10 pizza night. (All pizzas on the menu are $10.) \u00a0We started with the calamari saute appetizer. \u00a0Delicious! \u00a0Next time we might just order that for our entree! We then had the Caprese Invernale. \u00a0Turns out I'm not much of a fan of roasted tomatoes. It was ok, but I'll skip it next time. \u00a0We ordered the Capricciosa pizza with an egg on top, and then followed with dessert (chocolate cake thing). \u00a0Pizza was great. \u00a0We also ordered a bottle of wine with dinner.Service starts with the usual bread and olive oil. \u00a0The bread wasn't anything too special.Service was excellent. \u00a0It's very relaxing. They have a lovely outdoor dining area plus a small bocce ball court. \u00a0What makes Letizia's so special is its relaxed vibe, consistently good food, atmosphere (great music track), and service. It's worth it to make your way here. Get away from the crowded, noisy restaurants with long waits and average food. Letizia's is about 4 blocks north of the California exit off the Blue Line, so easy to get to/from downtown (for you out-of-owners). There's also a Divvy station right next to the restaurant."], ["Amy O.", "We went here on a lark. We wanted a decent dinner without dealing with the crowds on the Square. So, we found Letizia's on an Open Table search. But we didn't make a reservation, and this seems to have been a mistake. When we told the fellow (manager?) that we didn't have a \"resie\", we were escorted to the basement...excuse me, the \"Speakeasy\". First impressions of the place is that it's cute and well put together, but the basement was, well, a basement, complete with giant trash can and smelly mop bucket. We like to go out to eat and spend a little more than the food is probably worth for the experience. Atmosphere is very important. The last thing I want is to look at a trash can with dirty dishes pilled on top and smell bleachy mop water while I'm drinking a $9 glass of wine. The basement area was a mess. It seemed as though they had thrown it together with little thought to its actual utility. But more importantly the SMELL was terrible. Our server did her best under the circumstances. This place clearly has some management issues. There were 6 or 7 tables in the basement and one server. This wouldn't be such an issue, if they hadn't sat ALL of the tables within a 20 minute period. Our poor server was slammed, but she handled it with a smile. Meanwhile, other servers and the *owner* simply looked on without lending a hand. So, it took us much longer to actually get food and drinks than it really should have. We left a big tip for our lovely server.Meanwhile, the wet mop sat in the corner smelling up the place and the phone rang LOUDLY and incessantly. It felt more like a crappy sports bar than a nice-ish restaurant. I figured that the main dining room upstairs would be packed when we left - surely this would explain why we were relegated to the bowels of the building. Alas, there were at least 4 empty tables when we left. I'm sure the upstairs experience is far superior.The food was good, though our order was wrong (we didn't say anything as we were moving into hour 2 and needed to get to a party). A messed up order happens in that chaos (again, management should have stepped in to help our server).I haven't written a yelp review in years. I don't like to complain in public forums unless it is to serve some purpose for others. So, I just want to warn potential patrons to ask to NOT be sat in the basement. And hopefully, the management will see this and do something about it. Take into consideration that your patrons are not just paying for food, but also for the experience. Build a broom closet, for crying out loud. Organize the place and make sure the musty basement, mop water smells are gone before you ask people to eat there. I also plan to write an e-mail to the restaurant to alert them to these issues. I'm sorry to say that, despite the delicious food, we probably won't be back."], ["Lucyanna D.", "Incredibly Roman and just down right delicious. Service is also superb.

My wife and I enjoyed everything about it. Here's the blow by blow...Cocktails: Negroni was spot on and Ugo was a refreshing gin & elderflower drinkArancini cardinale: killer crisp exterior with great flavor both inside and in marinara that surroundedInsalata Estiva: Salad was amazing - great use of limoncello to provide acid and sweetness Pizza: oh, my goodness, right on. Got the del Bosco and loved the mushrooms. But, the crust and oven-fire cooking made the real different. We're sure all of the pizzas are delicious and intend to find out. Give us time.Pappardelle ai funghi: great truffle flavor without being too rich and overbearing.

Our server was very attentive and the food was great. I am not a fan of the pots they have as decor covering the walls in the back room but it hardly detracted from the experience. There is also a speakeasy in the downstairs that looks like a good time.I had the ravioli and it was wonderful. Not as filling as I would have liked it to be but I had my fill on drink and bread.I would go back!"], ["Duncan C.", "We had our first date here a year ago today. The weeks later, we got married. Came back for our anniversary. The home made pasta is superb. Logan Square is lucky to have this gem."], ["Eugene C.", "From the outside you wouldn't expect the massive amount of room this place has. The decor has that vibe of a modern restaurant with old world flair, classic graphic design posters so a lot of attention was paid to the details. The service was very attentive and friendly. I was seated right away even though my date didn't show up yet which was nice and they also served me bread and olive oil while I waited. She finally arrived and we decided to go with the whole experience. We started out with the Arancini Cardinale which was fried rice balls with cheese and beets. Three delicious treats floating ever so lightly on their marinara which was great for Fare la scarpetta! For those who don't know that is the ritual of using the table bread to sop up the sauce. We also got a caprese salad which was full of flavor but way too cold in my opinion. Not a deal breaker and it was tasty but I don't want to taste the cold initially. The main dishes were the star of the show. My dish was the Fall special - Sweet Potato Gnocchi with sage butter.. it was great! My date had the salmon ravioli and that was good too. We complemented the meal with a really bold Sangiovese which I forgot the name but it went well with the meal. We ended with a slice of pumpkin pie which was decent.. It was surounded by these spots of sugary caramel spots that were great for dipping. Overall it was a good dining experience with delicious food, attentive service and a pleasant environment to eat in. I'm looking forward to trying out the patio area in the summertime."], ["Sam F.", "I had previously only been here for coffee and soup or other quick lunch items, which were all pretty good. \u00a0Then towards the end of summer my wife and I went out on a limb and booked a dinner reservation at Letizia's with 2 other couples. \u00a0We were a bit apprehensive, as we booked via Open Table on fairly short notice for a Saturday night (for a party of 6) and they had wide availability.We sat outside, and they had some nice lighting around the seating area... It was a really nice atmosphere, plus it helped that the weather was great. \u00a0I had never realized coming during the day that they had outdoor seating for dinner, so that was my first pleasant surprise. \u00a0Our waitress was also very attentive and friendly, so that was good as well.My expectations for the food weren't super high to be honest, but boy was I blown away! \u00a0And it wasn't just me... Everyone seemed to love their food. \u00a0I had a pasta dish with mushrooms for my main course and it was awesome! \u00a0The pasta was so fresh and al dente... It tasted like it had been made from scratch just before being boiled, which it probably was! \u00a0And the sauce was spot on as well.No offense to nearby Buona Terra, but I went there for dinner once and came away not understanding what all the hype and positive reviews are all about... It was ok, but in a Sapori Trattoria kind of way (overcooked pasta that tasted like it was store bought), which I also don't get the rave reviews for. \u00a0Not trying to hate, just being honest from my experience at each. \u00a0Letizia's was WAY better than both in my opinion."], ["Michael B.", "Yes, I'm a fan. \u00a0Family owned and operated, wonderful people. \u00a0SImple fresh home made delicious causal Italian pastas, food and desserts. \u00a0Everything is delicious! \u00a0It was one of those meals we sat around and talked about while having our coffee and dessert. \u00a0Good reasonably priced wines complemented our meal perfectly. \u00a0Sweet, genuine, authentic wait staff round out a lovely night out with friends."], ["Antonio A.", "This place is like no other, welcoming and comfy, besides the greatness of the place, the food is great, I had a pizza from here, they actually use the wood burner and hand tossed. =)The flavors just busted in my mouth =)"], ["C. A.", "I have never once come here for dinner. Seems like it has a really nice, romantic kind of atmosphere in the evenings, and I'd be eating alone, so ... yeah.That's not what the review is about anyway. I love this place in the daytime.They have lovely little sandwiches - there are a few I like to rotate between, but they heat 'em up on the grill for you, and god. SO GOOD. There's one with mozzarella, tomato and pesto that's so simple but so fucking good. Gaaaah. Love it! As the morning wears on toward lunch, they bring out pizzas and some other things as well, but I'm usually in around breakfast time.Daytime also features a great dessert case, with a good range of cookies, crostata (TINY PIES), and other items like muffins and bagels and lord knows what else. I have yet to be disappoined with anything, though the chocolate chip cookies aren't really my 'style.' Still good, but a little weird. I'm obsessed with their crostata, though. Teeny-tiny single serving fruit pies, man! Fuck!They also make a pretty solid hot chocolate. Nice selection of hot beverages, as well as cold drinks in the little cooler thing by the register, and another cooler full of Naked juice ... it's just a nice, cozy selection all around.And the staff is super friendly. Really solid place all around, and I come through fairly regularly. Really do need to check out the dinner sometime, though."], ["Evan L.", "Great little place with good coffee - a great place to get work done.

Grand Avenue pizza is totally different and delicious."], ["Rich B.", "Went to dinner last night with my girlfriend at this place for the first time. Had one of the worst experiences of my life. We were seated outside on their side seating area and it took about 10 minutes for the server to even acknowledge our presence. The buser was very attentive and we probably talked to him twice before I asked him to ask about our server. The server came over and took our order for wine and salads and then we did not see him again for 20 minutes at our table, he walked by us a couple times, but never acknowledged our existence when we tried to get his attention to order our main courses. He then just drops off our salads and wine and then again walks away for awhile. He took our main course order finally about an hour after we sat down. He made excuses that the restaurant was poorly laid out and not conducive providing easy service and that is what the delay was, but how is that possible when you walk by your tables and ignore them multiple times when they are trying to get your attention. That is not a layout issue, that is a server issue. The food was so so, but the service was so bad we discussed twice just asking the buser to tell our server to bring our check (once before our salads arrived and once after they did before we ordered our main meal). I will never go back to this place ever again. I understand places have off nights, but this was beyond anything I could even remotely tolerate."], ["Michael W.", "We walked in close to closing time. Service was ok. We got the arancini. the server described them much larger say a little bigger than a golf ball. It came out much smaller than described. For rice balls we expected more.... Pizza was great and pasta was decent.Not a bad place."], ["Stefanie K.", "Great place for an Italian dinner. My bf is Italian so we rarely eat it out, bc homemade is always better. This place is just as good! Always have new specials to try as well. Yum!!"], ["Don H.", "Tremendous. That alone justifies the five-star review from these hands.Letizia's, to me, was always another neighborhood caf\u00e9. But recently they decided to turn the caf\u00e9 to an upscale Italian eatery during the evening hours, boasting of their 40 bottles for less than $40. (Don't worry: most of them are between $30 and $35.)I made a last-minute reservation for a Friday night on OpenTable for about 6:30p and came into an empty restaurant. We thought we had made a mistake but it quickly filled up. The ambiance is quiet, easy to have a date night in but also one can imagine having a small group of friends for a going-away party or something low-key. The crowd varied for sure.Now, on to the food. The menu was, well, pricey. And that's okay because the experience of eating was well worth the cost. We started with insalata finocchio, which they nicely split for the two of us. The oranges were the highlight of course one, dominating the calming flavors of the fennel and the strangely-tasteless olive.Next was the garlic bread. This is when I realized I needed to suspend the idea of Olive Garden-style Italian food. Here was a thin slice of bread gently garnished with delicious olive oil and garlic. It wasn't overwhelming, but just right.Then came the mains. Homemade. Scratch made. Totally-made-for-me pasta. The black grouper was just heaven. The noodles were imperfect but had a great taste on their own. The mini tomatoes burst in your mouth and touched every one of of my taste buds individually shaking them from their dormant state. I love fish and this was prepared by someone who gets that and isn't scared to make a fish dish fishy.My partner's eggplant ravioli (and she does not like eggplant) was done to perfection. For once the eggplant wasn't mushy. It nearly had the texture of a fine ricotta. It was pressed into a hand-made ravioli and brushed with a scrumptious tomato cream sauce.(I am using a lot of adjectives I don't normally use. I apologize.)Now, we're full at this point. But we cannot stop ourselves from at least looking at the menu. And we're not committed by any means. We can stop. We ... will ... try at least.But we lose to a pumpin cheesecake and a chocolate cloud. Let's start with the cloud. Imagine a round ball of chocolate, about the size of a softball, maybe a little larger. Then imagine it filled with a mousse-like substance. Then imagine putting big pieces of cake inside this mass. It doesn't seem possible, but it is incredible.And I've saved the best for last. I love pumpkin and cheesecake. The best cheesecake I've ever had was at a place that no longer exists. But this one is out of this world. The owner herself made this recipe and it is by far the most amazing cheesecake. It's like the entire month of November was dumped into this one slice. There are notes of nutmeg, vanilla, rich pumpkin and the sweetness (not over sweet) of the cream cheese and a bit of sugar. Then topped off with a semi-sweet caramel. It's just incredible and just works so well.With two apps, two entrees, a bottle of wine and two desserts the total comes to $101. That's a great date night, but definitely one of those places you cannot go EVERY night. To top it off, Letizia herself came around and chatted with us a couple times as though we had known each other for ages. And that's what sends it over the edge for me. You know it's made with love, tenderness and with passion. And every bite shows."], ["Annette U.", "My friend had her birthday party here. She was able to reserve the downstairs room which had a bar and some tables in it. I really liked the ambiance and the decor of the place-very intimate and calming. The bartender informed us the cook had just started making his own giardiniera, so we had the pizza with italian sausage and giardiniera on it. The pizza is typical very thin crust traditional Italian style-which is my favorite. I thought it was a little pricey, but I really liked the vibe of the restaurant. The staff was also wonderful as well. Very beautifully decorated space."], ["Joseph C.", "I just wanted to say that I absolutely love this charming coffeeshop/cafe by day and Ristorante Italiano by night.

Also, it the the 2nd year in a row that I have ordered their specialty Pumpkin Carmel Cheesecake and brought it to Thanksgiving dinner, which is homemade from scratch (i believe they make their own pasta and breads as well, but don't quote me on that). \u00a0It was devoured and everyone raved about how delicious it was again this year. \u00a0Thanks Letizia, for having such a funloving staff, and great food! \u00a0Nice job!"], ["Paul K.", "Letizia's makes the best drip coffee I've ever had. I love it so much--especially with a good muffin. The only problem is, they no longer serve good muffins. I used to get oatmeal chocolate chip or blueberry or double chocolate muffins at least once a week. There were so many kinds to choose from. The last few times I've gone in for coffee, however, there were only a couple kinds. The last three blueberry muffins I bought from Letizia's had no more than 5 berries in each muffin.

Bottom Line: \u00a0Food was decent, basic trattoria. \u00a0Service sucked.Specifics: Potato gnocchi with venison bolognese. \u00a0The gnocchi itself was decent \u00a0-- tasty but could have been a little lighter. \u00a0The venison bolognese sauce was mouth watering \u00a0--true \u00a0five star \u00a0-- deep and rich and wonderful flavor.Chicken thighs: \u00a0Ok. \u00a0Pretty standard, nothing to complain about but nothing to \u00a0write home about either.Shrimp entree: \u00a0Same sides as the chicken thighs -- carrots, broccoletti (a touch too al dente) and roast potatoes. \u00a0Again, okay, but nothing to write home about.Coffee: \u00a0Dead and cold.Service: \u00a0What would have been a perfectly pleasant evening was ruined by the lame service. \u00a0There was one server (male, Sunday night) who had -- count them -- all of four small tables to take care of the entire evening. \u00a0It took him 20 minutes to bring a cocktail to the table. \u00a0Another 15 minutes to bring a glass of wine. \u00a0We ordered two entrees to share between three people and he couldn't get the concept of bringing dinner plates for each of us and spoons so we could scoop up the food and put it on our plates. \u00a0When we asked for these things, he mentally rolled his eyes like we were being way too much work. \u00a0At the time, the dining room was basically dead.Hopefully, this place will soon start doing better business and be able to attract some professional staff in the FOH."], ["Christi D.", "We visited on a Saturday night with a reservation for 7 and were seated immediately at a lovely table with Emily as our very informative, pleasant and attentive server. \u00a0We all loved the bread, fried risotto and cheese tray before dinner with great wine. \u00a0Every entree was delicious, herb gnocchi, tagliatelle, risotto special...so different and full of great tastes. \u00a0We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves."], ["Tina M.", "I would recommend this place to run in and get a coffee and muffin but we won't be back for dinner. \u00a0Food was good/decent, service was HORRIBLE."], ["Kelsey K.", "Letizia's has quickly become our favorite Italian spot and our favorite place to bring guests looking for less-than-adventurous cuisine. \u00a0That's not to say that it's not creative and completely delicious! \u00a0To start, they bring you this amazing bread which which they are gracious when you ask for seconds (or thirds or fourths). \u00a0They make homemade risotto balls and a fresh risotto of the day and they are both scrumptous and always creative. \u00a0We have had ones with different Italian hams or shrimp or vegetables and each has been a treat. \u00a0Their wine menu isn't large, but has a great selection and you'll surely find something that you love. \u00a0They also make amazing homemade pastas and all of their pizzas are handmade in a wood fire oven. \u00a0The decor is great and the outdoor patio is wonderful when the weather is nice. \u00a0I am happy that they have opened in the neighborhood and am looking forward to many meals together. \u00a0Also, if you're in for a post-dinner libation, head downstairs to the Speakeasy where there is a full bar and live DJs. \u00a0You'll have a great meal with great late night entertainment, all in one spot!"], ["X C.", "The food at Letizia's is really good, but recently they've devoted more and more restaurant energy to their dinners (which are $$$. \u00a0Unaffordable if you have a small income or are in school).I have been frequenting this place since it opened but have found myself cutting back for numerous reasons. \u00a0They no longer use the brick oven for the cafe (only for dinner), so their sandwiches are pre-made and grilled on a panini grill now. \u00a0This means that sometimes the food is semi-cold and sometimes you can't even get food, because they've run out. \u00a0Also, there's not as much selection since it's not baked fresh. \u00a0And they took away the best item on the menu- the garlic bomb!! \u00a0Another thing that I find somewhat frustrating is the inconsistent service. \u00a0At times I get exactly what I ordered, but more than a few times something is missing. \u00a0But again, since the oven is not in use, there is less chance of that happening.Don't get me wrong, the food here is very good and the coffee, too! \u00a0I'm giving it 3 stars, because I dislike the recent changes they've made. \u00a0What made Letizia's special before was the fresh-made food and the brick oven, and now that they have done away with both those things, it feels like just another generic cafe."], ["Chris A.", "Have visited this restaurant many times since the initial review.

Both of us loved all three. The plin is their signature dish - it's basically like cheese ravioli's - what's not to like? Not sure it's MIND-BLOWING but they're addicting and tasty! Carne Cruda is their steak tartare - not the best I have ever had but was also enjoyable. The Tajarin was recco'd by the waitress - pretty basic angel hair pasta with some mild seasonings. I enjoyed it but I'm a sucker for white carbs & garlic. Second time we went with the Vitello Tonnato, Plin & Gamberini. We asked the server between the Vitello Tonnato & the Carne Cruda - and he said FOR SURE Vitello Tonnato, so since I had the CC before, we went with the VT - big disappointment. This was literally deli meat on a plate with a soft boiled egg which unfortunately didn't add much to the dish. I love raw meat and I love eggs and this was a miss. Don't listen to your server - go with the carne cruda!! My parents weren't wild about the plin but they did like the Gamberini - fried shrimp served with garbanzo beans. This to me was something that you'd see duplicated at any restaurant with fried shrimp. While tasty, it felt out of place. For the main dishes, the first time we went with the rabbit and the lamb. The rabbit was the favorite but the lamb was surprisingly inside pasta! The lamb was also really yummy. You could really taste the olives which I love. The pasta was light if you can imagine that in a white pasta, but I think that's a sign of high quality? Maybe? The rabbit was also a waitress recommendation. It's wrapped in pork belly which acts like bacon & it's incredibly juicy and crisp. Would order this again in any situation.With the rents - we added to the rabbit/lamb and went with the steak. The steak was disappointing though i'm not sure what we were expecting. it was 5 tiny small bites and white it was well seasoned it did not feel like the highest quality meat. I hate to say it but almost resembled hamburger meat (in flavor not in looks). My dad who is a meat and potatoes type guy, and struggles when my mom and I make him share everything was not overly thrilled with this one, though he did like the rabbit. Comments around the lamb this time were around how garlicky it was... I didn't remember it quite so garlicky the first time around though it wasn't a turn off for me.The ambiance:This place is cute. It is a gem on Armitage street - twinkle lights all around. Across the street from the tasty freeze :) Would love to try outdoor dining in the summer.The first time I went it was just my boyfriend and I and we were at a small two top table along the wall. The table next to us was SO LOUD and because they were so close to us, there was really nothing we could do about it. We weren't about to ask to be moved considering it was a busy Friday night but overall the restaurant is loud. This was also an issue with my parents who are 65+... I would recommend to all servers everywhere, if you are waiting on a table with older folks, PROJECT YOUR VOICE. No one can hear you and then it just gets awkward when you have to keep repeating yourself...Service: The owner came to our table on my second visit. He told my mom, dad and me all about where the inspiration for the restaurant came from - the little region in Italy that borders France and was invaded by the Austrians - hence why there's more champagne on the menu than prosecco.

I spent a lot on my meal but I don't think it was worth that much money... Also I hate it when waiters pester you to order a drink.

I received two voice mails and another follow up phone call and text after I confirmed. We thought that was little funny and knew there was no way we could not make it now. We drove and the nice part is it's pretty easy to find parking. Added bonus was since it was Sunday the parking was free. When we arrived we were seated right away. Only one in my party of 3 drank, but she said the bartender did a really good job of helping her decide what to get and mixing the drinks. The owner of the restaurant was a sweetheart. He came over to explain the theme and to tell us about what part of Italy the food is inspired from. The menu is in all Italian, so it was nice he gave us a round down on all the food items. We absolutely loved all the food we ordered. We started with an appetizer of the Polipo (which is Octopus). I am a fan! For my main meal I had the Tagliatta which is steak with fried asparagus. Check out my pic because this was delicious! My friends shared a salad and had the risotto, which was also good they said.The portions are on the smaller side, so we definitely saved room for dessert. We tried 3 of the 4 desserts listed on the menu. We had the Semi Freddo (sort of like an ice cream cookie), Cioccolato (chocolate cake with ice cream), and the Nocciloa (Hazel Nut cake). We shared everything. I'm sad to say the dessert was a let down for me. I found the hazel nut cake (one I ordered) to be on the dry side. In all fairness I'm not a huge fan of chocolate and definitely not dark chocolate, so I didn't like that at all. All in all our experience was good and we plan on going back to try more items on the menu. Excellent service, Gracious owner, and flavorful food."], ["John F.", "My preferred restaurant. This is a provincial restaurant highlighting the cuisine, wine and culture of the Piedmont region.

Hubs thought it was pretty good though, so I'll add a star.The majority of my distaste is that it's expensive and small food. I think I should be able to spend $50 a person and feel full, but that wasn't the case here.We had the vitello tonatto to start, which is basically deli cold cuts with half a soft-boiled egg and some sauce. Majorly underwhelming.We also got the risotto, which on this day had pork belly and a lamb sausage. The amount of pork belly was pretty laughable (a bite for each of us), but the risotto was pretty tasty. Hubs said it tasted \"like gyros\" (not sure if that's what they were going for).I had the tagliata (NY strip with some greens and potatoes), which was barely OK. The steak (about seven or eight bites-worth) was tough to the point that it was hard to chew (and I had ordered it medium). The three or so small potatoes were very nice and crispy, but the greens had a not-so-tasty vinegar-y dressing that made me leave most of it uneaten. Hubs had the rabbit (coniglio), which looked and tasted like chicken. None of the gamey taste, but I think that's what hubs had been gaming for (pun intended).None of the desserts looked appealing so we passed. But there were a number of nice and affordable wines by the glass, so props to that.There are a dozen or two other places in town at this price point I would go before here again."], ["missallfun H.", "I was very excited to try this place , as the menus regional flair was right up my alley. The experience fell flat when the food was just ok and the portions were a far cry from sharable. I wouldnt expect the portion sizes to be so small with such a high price tag. The Lobster antipasti was mediocre, whole foods does a better version of this. The beet Salad was average. The octopus was also forgettable. The house made pasta was a total let down. Presentation overall was also below par for this price point. Main courses were somewhat encouraging. $3 bread service was an insult. Come on, build this into your costs already. Unless its special by some means dont hype it. Save your money & time and go to Nico downtown. Your check wont be that much higher, the ambiance is def better, you can hear your server and the food is honest and executed beyond expectations.

The wine recommendations were spot on, the food was devine, and the service was friendly and thoughtful. I am still basking in the afterglow of the Plin -- perfectly al dente, pillowy, creamy, buttery, thymey -- just so freaking good. I loved the light and fresh octopus, while my wife devoured the cauliflower and nettle flan. The steak was cooked just as we ordered and the reduction and fondue accompaniments were fantastic. We were in a rush, so no dessert, but I can't wait to go back.

This is not to say that I didn't enjoy Brand (I did), but all one has to do is look at my profile and notice that I'd want my last meal to be in Piedmont and with a ton of amazing Barolo. Since I can't accomplish that, Osteria Langhe is more than an acceptable substitute.I really like what they have done with the old Brand BBQ location. You still have the tables along the wall, but the feel is very classy and there is a bar right in the front. I like how they have used what was in place, but they've definitely have changed things up too.The food was done perfectly. I love the cuisine from Piedmont as it's rustic and savory. You don't see much pasta from here, so this may be some unfamiliar territory for a lot of people. So, take away your normal conceptions on what Italian food is, and enjoy the hell out of this. I started off with the Panino Aperto and the daily spread was crab. This is me nodding with a grin on my face. I then moved onto the roasted chicken. While that may not be the most exciting dish in the world, it was done beautifully. The sauce alone was worth the price of admission. I also sampled some of my friend's salmon (that was on special) and they did a killer job of this too. I can't end my review without mentioning how fantastic the owner Aldo is. You can really tell his passion for all things Piedmont. This passion follows through with the food and the killer wine list. I'm not gonna lie, it was gonna take something downright awful for me not to be a real fan of Osteria Langhe. But, even with me having a good bias towards the food and wine, Osteria Langhe executed every expectation to perfection. This is a great opening and I really hope people give this the support it deserves.

Overall was disappointed in our experience"], ["Karen S.", "Phenomenal. I could list everything I loved but that would basically be copying and pasting the menu. I went with a group and we did a lot of sharing which was perfect. I'd have to say the home made pastas were my favorite. I could eat the plin every day for the rest of my life. I loved that the menu was a combination of familiar and the unknown. I tried barnacles and veal fries for the first time. I had a perfectly done steak and was surprised to fine that I enjoyed that parsnip puree just as much. The service was excellent and they did a wonderful job of walking us through the menu and answering any questions. Don't go expecting to order just an entree and have left overs for tomorrow. The idea is to have an Italian meal which means multiple courses. The courses are portioned correctly so that you're not full after the first course. Allow time to enjoy a slow dinner and make an evening out of it."], ["Katie Y.", "I loved everything about our meal here. My husband and I stopped in for dinner a few weeks ago, and I am still thinking about the wine I had and the vegetarian crepe dish (FONDUTA like whoah). The service was everything you want it to be - friendly, attentive, and well informed. The owner came over to chat with us which was nice. The wine list - so good that I took it home with me. If we lived closer to this place, our bank account would hurt, but our quality of life would skyrocket."]], "Quartino": [["Tiffany L.", "I've heard many good things about Quartino, so I was disappointed to be very underwhelmed upon my visit. The food was very mediocre, and the service was extremely slow.Calamari: I enjoyed the light texture of the breading of the calamari. The calamari itself was also well done, avoiding the pitfalls of hard chewiness that often is the issue with squid. However, I was not much of a fan of the tomato sauce; I appreciated their attempts to go beyond the typical cocktail sauce, but I felt like the sauce was missing the sour tang to balance out the slightly more rich nature of the breading.Pesto gnocchi: I love love love pesto, so naturally I went straight for this. However, I was very disappointed to find the sauce far too salty, the gnocchi doughy and too chewy, and the vegetables a major distraction from the pesto flavors.Paparadelle: I liked this one slightly better than the pesto--the noodles were a nice texture, and the tomato based sauce went very well with the tender braised beef. I found this dish also very salty, but not as bad as the pesto. Tiramisu: This was by far the best dish of the night. Extremely light, slightly sweet, and very well balanced out with the more bitter chocolate and espresso flavors. Overall, was quite unimpressed with the food. Perhaps I should've have gone for a pizza rather than two pasta dishes, but the food overall was extremely mediocre and too salty for the most part, with the tiramisu being the one saving grace."], ["Jordan N.", "Fun dinning space, comparable to a Marchella's or kind of like a Bravo type restaurant. We tried 3 flat breads and 6 pastas for 11 people. Although they say pasta is to be shared, truthfully they aren't huge portions. Favorites we're the 4 cheese flatbread.The ravioli was unexpectedly in a thin broth sauce with lima beans and prosciutto...not a combo we were prepared for (I didn't personally read this on the menu so not sure how it was described).Also, the spinach salad was enough for 3-4+ to share, but be aware, it is highly acidic. In fact toward the bottom it was inedible, and it burned our lips for being so salty/acidic. For such a large portion it had maybe 4 thinly sliced apples on top, so primarily a bowl of spinach and dressing. Overall my party had a great time, our waiter was great dispite appearing very busy and food was good."], ["Sonia L.", "Italian food... tapas style?! Quartino is a dream come true. My brother and I were visiting from Texas. We both love Italian. And we both have big appetites.... We ordered the bruschette, dates wrapped in pancetta, polenta fries, calamari, gnocchi, ravioli, Tuscan sausage risotto, and ended it with the zeppole. Every single dish made me drool. Did I mention you can get your plates in half sizes?? Bonus for the girl who loves to try everything.The couple next to us saw our food and literally ordered the exact same appetizers. They couldn't finish it, and if we didn't have any decency, we would have finished it for them!Our waiter/bartender was an absolute delight and very attentive, even though it was a crazy-packed Saturday night. He gave us a shot of limoncello, I upped his tip (that's how it works right?). I wanted sooo bad to come back the next day, but unfortunately we never had time. I promise, I will be back!If you're ever in the Chicago area, PLEASE go here! Reservations recommended if you dislike waiting, because this place is so damn popular. And rightfully so."], ["Maxie H.", "We love this cute Italian tapas restaurant! This place is surprisingly huge! There is inside and outside seating. Although, I do recommend sitting inside since Quartino is located at a busy intersection. Their homemade bread with olive oil and vinaigrette is so good! We highly recommend ordering 2-3 dishes per person. My favorite dishes were the Soprano pizza, Veal Meatballs Napoli and Tortellini. I love how thin and crispy their pizza is. Dip the crust in the olive oil and vinaigrette, and you'll fall in love even more. The combination of the meatball with the golden raisin is quite a pleasant surprise. We loved eating the prosciutto with the tortellini. Also, you MUST get the Tiramisu. It's probably the best tiramisu I have ever had. AVOID the Angus Beef Carpaccio - it's super bland. I'm not a big fan of beets. But if you're looking for a vegetable dish, the beets are pretty good. To be honest, there is a wide variety of dishes on the menu suitable for any guest. We highly recommend it for everyone! We will definitely come back and try some more dishes!"], ["Olivia B.", "Had an awesome meal here! Went on Saturday night at 6:30 and got a table without a wait.For a table of 2 we left full (with leftovers), our bill was under $60 (with a bottle of wine!), and we loved the food!We had:-Polpette al sugo di pomodoro (veal meatballs in tomato sauce with fresh ricotta on top)-Dates wrapped in pancetta-Asiago cheese and olive assortment-Gnocchi (with a different preparation)Everything was awesome...except the olives. Just don't order them. Weird, gross flavors, bad textures, etc. Don't waste your time. Everything else, A+!Server was attentive, helpful, and pleasant.Would say I wish the plates had come out together because it would have been nice to eat the dates with the meatballs, rather than just eating a bunch of dates... but everything was so good we didn't mind :)Thanks Quartino! We will be back!"], ["Win C.", "We came here on our first night in Chicago because we were both starving and it was relatively close to our hotel. We were really debating whether or not we wanted to try deep dish in Chicago. We opted to come to Quartino and we were really glad that they served thin crust pizza (which I love). We were able to get 2 flavors on the pizza and ordered half Prosciutto and Arugula and half sausage. Pizza wise, it was good and deserved 4 stars. We also ordered the gnocchi with pesto sauce and the flavor was just weird. We weren't a fan at all. Hence, I'd give this place more of a 3.5 stars. Service was great and attentive!"], ["Heather D.", "I came here for a luncheon for our racing group. It's a cute place with some pretty delicious food. We were upstairs. The staff was friendly and the waiters made sure your drink was always full. If you wanted more of something, all you had to do was ask. And if you are a meat eater but your friend is a vegetarian....not problem. They have something for everybody here. I really enjoyed the various bruschetta that they gave us, especially the cherry tomato and mushroom. (they are separate ones) We had an interesting ravioli with braised pork, but I really enjoyed the Cavatelli (?) with tomato sauce, basil and ricotta. Our waiter asked if we wanted another dish of that and we all said \"yes!\" The last part of our luncheon was a dark chocolate fondue with fruit and Biscotti to dip. THIS STUFF IS LIKE CRACK! It is so unbelievably good and it took all the power in me to not grab the mini pot and drink it. I don't meant to put this paragraph right after the food paragraph, but you must go to their bathroom.....just to try the powdered soap. Seriously. And don't worry, there is no man/woman walking into the wrong bathroom. Just the first couple glass windows that you can see each other when you first walk in since the doors are right next to each other. We had a \"wtf\" moment with a guy in which we both looked at each other through the glass and he turned around to look on the door and make sure he was walking into the men's bathroom. lol."], ["Emily W.", "Delicious food. The short ribs were the winner. It might be my mouth but things seemed a touch salty (the pizza with the duck prosciutto was define bit saline).Joe was our waiter and was fantastic. The manager came by to check on us and stuck around for maybe a long time (two or three times) and definitely seemed to be hitting on the gentlemen whom I was dining with. (Who wouldn't love such interest and focus and getting her card and giggling over their non-jokes? Hey manager, how bout don't make a huge todo about giving your digits via card to strangers, especially when the date of one is right there and the other is wearing a ring) I did not love it. That part was a bit funny but didn't change how good the food was."], ["Donna C.", "Loved, loved, loved this place! Great food, good service and busy atmosphere (just how we like it). Our server was knowledgeable and the food was quick and delicious. The table for our party of 4 was a bit tight with all the food we ordered, but that was only a slight downside to a great meal. Plan on going back when we are in Chicago again."], ["Olivia H.", "Quartino is a high quality, tapas-style Italian place, so if you're on a budget, it is key to note that some of the dishes are available as half portions (mostly pasta and seafood plates)! This means you can try more things without sacrificing too much financially! Of course, Quartino is still by no means cheap. For my friend and I, our bill still came out to be ~$50 (with tax and tip) for 3-4 plates and a 1/2 liter of wine. But everything we ate was phenomenal! My personal favorites were the roasted baby octopus and the duck prosciutto. The baby octopus was tender, well seasoned, and served alongside some greens. Such magic. The duck prosciutto was served in tiny pieces, but each bite was so deliciously fatty and flavorful that we were able to make it last for quite awhile.Ultimately, this is worth the visit. Think you'll still be hungry? You can always stuff yourself with free bread (the college student way), or plan to come here for a pre-dinner snack."], ["Chris C.", "Go to Quartino! \u00a0Italian + tapas + sangria = wow!Sat outside on a warm September evening, recommended by friends. \u00a0Good food, very casual environment with staff that seems to be having fun.Huge tapas selection gives you plenty to choose from!Will come again!"], ["Ann W.", "I wanted to like Quartino more than I did. I'm hovering between 3 and 4 stars, but to be honest, they're more like 3.25 stars, so I gotta round down!First and foremost, if you want to come here, make a reservation, even if it's a weeknight. My sister and I visited on a weeknight and the entry area was chaotic with people wanting to get a table and the place was hoppin'. We were definitely glad to be in the minority of people who actually made reservations.Our service was friendly, but spotty. We each ordered the tomato soup to start, but they brought them out one by one, so that my sister was almost done with hers by the time mine arrived. That seemed really odd. The soup was really good with nice chunks of tomato floating in a thick tomato puree. My sister also ordered a couple of veggie dishes and I ordered the Bianca Pizza, all of which came out relatively close together. My sister like her veggie items, but the potato puree she ordered was just too rich for her to eat much of it. My Bianca Pizza was ok, but not spectacular. They overdid it on the onions which would have been much better if they had been caramelized and the other ingredients, rosemary and chilis, were too sparse. I ended up taking most of it back to my hotel for breakfast and then ended up dumping most of the leftovers in the garbage because I just couldn't stomach more of it. Our waiter took my sister's potato puree off the tab, which was nice. She hadn't actually complained about it and we would have been happy to pay for it. My sister gave me some cash to help cover her portion and I gave our waiter the cash and my credit card and he agreed to charge the difference between the bill and the cash tendered. When the credit card receipt was presented, the cash was gone and he had charged the entire amount of the bill to my card. I would like to think the best of people, but I kinda think he was hoping I wouldn't notice so he could pocket the cash. He did rerun my card, so I'm hoping it went through correctly and there are not duplicate charges. I will know in a few days. This is a restaurant that I think probably has potential to be great, but the service was off and food wasn't consistently great. Next time I visit, I definitely will not make a beeline for Quartino."], ["Quoc N.", "I had high expectations for Quartino but I'm not sure I was blown away by the food or the atmosphere. The food was just okay but nothing that other tapas bars can't replicate or execute better. We ordered some of the more popular dishes like polenta fries, veal sliders, shrimp and sausage risotto. \u00a0My favorite was probably the polenta fries since I've never had it presented that way before. It also came out piping hot which was a plus. Veal sliders were decent and my friends seem to liked them quite a bit. \u00a0I was not as impressed with the infamous pork shank. Ours came out dry and was tough overall. \u00a0It tasted a lot like leather after chewing my way through my first bite. However, as I got to the center of the shank, it got better and the meat did indeed slide off the bone. My biggest gripe though, is the seating arrangement. I get that restaurants want to utilize their real estate as much as possible, especially when they're likely paying both arms and legs for competitive spaces smack-dab in the middle of downtown. \u00a0However, this place takes it up a notch as you can probably taste the food of tables around you if you tried hard enough. \u00a0Again, I don't blame them for doing this to accommodate their large volume of customers but I had hoped for a less intimate experience with the foodies that night."], ["Kuma N.", "Mafioso style Chicago Italian restorante. \u00a0Excellent atmosphere taking you back in time.

Be sure to ask for vinegar because they don't give it to you unless requested. The short rib was so small. It was very soft and the meat just melted in my mouth. The problem with this was that it was somewhat bland. There wasn't as much flavor as I had hoped. 6/10 on this We also ordered the linguine with clams. The clams were awesome.

The place was pretty loud and was crowded (it was Saturday night so not surprised). We ordered pizza, egg plant Parmesan, polenta fries, and the white bean and garlic dip. Of these the pizza was good, polenta fries was average and white bean dip was average. The egg plant Parmesan was not anything great, i have definitely had better. Though we were so full I wanted to get some desert to make us feel happy :PSo ordered the Torta al Cioccolato, which was like s scoop of venilla ice-cream on top of molten hot chocolate cake.

The meats are cured in house. I loved the eggplant salad. It was fresh, light and perfectly seasoned. We also shared an order of rigatoni with lamb sugo and burrata. It was spectacular! We ordered a margherita pizza (for our kids) and zeppoli with chocolate sauce to go. They disappeared quickly, so I'm guessing they were good as well!Our server was friendly and attentive and the manager stopped by our table to say hello and make sure everything was to our liking.

Perhaps Yelp made our expectations too high, but those two dishes were nothing to write home about (and were quite expensive).

Along with old school Italian hospitality and made from scratch pasta and sauces this place puts me in a food coma from a delicious overdose every time. Keep up the great work you guys."], ["Emily H.", "we followed the reviews online and ordered the meatball salad and pork chop sunday gravythe meatball is different that i originally anticipated, it is \u00a0not as juicy or flavourful, but nonetheless it is still very good. I espeically liked the greens and dressing, it is not just some veggie they throw together to make a salad, the dressing is very refreshing and greens very freshthe pork is very tender and great texture, highly recommend portions are hugewe especially liked the owner would drop by to see how we enjoyed everything, very tentative. the environment is very cozy, would definitely come back to try other dishes"], ["Neema P.", "This place was delicious. We came here to celebrate my brother's birthday. We had 10 people and I had made the reservations from a week ago. I had made changes to the amount of people at least 3x and they were so accommodating and nice. Given that the restaurant gets super busy on a Saturday night during prime dining hours, our food came out promptly and hot. I got the rigatoni Vodka and so delicious, tasted authentic. I can't wait to go back and eat it again or try other dishes. Side note, we did get charged $3 for a sharing fee, but he gave us $21.00 complimentary desserts so I guess it evened out. The Tiramsu and the salted caramel gelato is like heaven. 5 thumbs up guys, can't wait to come back again!"], ["Shelli U.", "Without a doubt, the best Italian restaurant in Chicago!! The food is incredible ... meatball salad is to die for (I know it sounds weird but just try it), burrata with balsamic roasted tomatoes and crustini is the perfect starter and all of the entrees (meats & pasta) are filling and delicious (my favorite is the eggplant parm). Not only is the food exceptional but the service makes you feel like part of the family! I LOVE THIS PLACE and you will too!!"], ["Breanna B.", "Oh, the parpadelle! Everyone has had that moment where they wish their stomach was a bottomless pit to enjoy every morsel of a meal. This was one of those moments for me. I ordered the vodka parpadelle and I never wanted it to end. I wanted to keep eating, but my body told me I had to stop. It was creamy, rich, and the pasta was cooked perfectly, evidently homemade. It had just the right about of bite and the sauce coated each noodle. I'm salivating... If you do one thing when you come to Viaggio, it's order the parpadelle with vodka sauce. I finally found my favorite and it's in a city I don't live in. *single tear slides down my cheek* Other things you must try include the meatball salad, it seems unusual, but it makes sense when you eat it. Lettuce and savory marinara mix together with a bite of tender meatballs. The burrata is wonderful. One must always enjoy burrata at an Italian restaurant, it is a requirement. Coupled with many glasses of prosecco, it turned out to be a wonderful night and the service was top notch from beginning to end."], ["M K.", "Love the non-ritzy ambiance and class at Viaggio. Meatball salad is amazing. Was there for lunch and was very pleased with my grilled chicken sando. \u00a0Can't wait to come back to try the lasagna, have heard great things."], ["Cara L.", "Never in my life did I think that a meatball salad would change my life, let alone be something that even sounded remotely good. But holy.crap. I was wrong. My first night in Chicago and my savvy colleague set up a late dinner for a small group of us at Viaggio. When we walked in I noticed this place looked like it had been there for a while, or at least had a history in the area. I really have no idea if that's true or not, but when it comes to Italian eats, the older the decor, the more homey and authentic it feels. My colleague insisted we try the meatball salad, so I elected him to pick the apps for the whole table. He did damn well. But the big stand out was definitely this unique dish. Sure, warm meatballs on cold, crisp lettuce sounds like it could be disastrous, but Viaggio makes it work so hard. It was like a lightly dressed, Italian side salad with homemade meatballs on top. They cut them up at the table and then serve the guests. Please, just try it. I saw they had homemade gnocchi on the menu, so I opted for a heaping dish of that with their vodka sauce. Good. God. I've never had such a filling pasta before! I could barely make it through 1/4 of this rich dish of epic deliciousness. Another stellar part of this meal was the service. Our waiter was on it. He knew the specials by heart and described them perfectly. He made our entire party feel super special and even brought over complimentary, house-made, REAL limoncello. I'm normally not a fan, but this was so tasty. Lastly, while we were waiting for our cab, the owner chatted with us like we've been friends for years. So nice. Thanks for the great experience, guys!"], ["Tiratat P.", "I came here twice now. The food is very delicious both time. The service is very friendly and fast.The first time I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass. It is delicious! The portion is very generous. But I would try to improve on the presentation.The second time I ordered stacked eggplants and a chicken parmesan. Again they are both fantastic.By the way, they have a chilled glass for beer!Also there is a ice cream shop called \"Cone Gourmet Ice Cream\" nearby that you should check it out. It's within a walking distant."], ["Anna B.", "This review is LONG overdue. This is my absolute favorite restaurant in the city of Chicago. \u00a0I would say my husband and I come here at least 2-3 times a month for dinner, drinks, dessert or appetizers. We never leave without having their meatball salad, a dirty martini with blue cheese olives, and a shot of their house limoncello to end the night. I can't forget about the house peppers - I can eat them every single day. We live in the neighborhood and this restaurant is truly a gem. We have a hard time leaving the neighborhood to try new places because I KNOW we'll have a great meal at Viaggio. Nico, Matt, Kristin, the WHOLE Viaggio team make you feel like you're a part of their family. We have been celebrating birthdays, anniversaries, and special occasions there for the last couple of years. We celebrated NYE 2015 and got engaged there in a surprise proposal that the staff helped my husband create. I can't say enough good things - BEST meatball salad, BEST dirty martini, BEST limoncello, BEST Italian restaurant in the city, by FAR. It's impossible to be disappointed."], ["Jeff K.", "This is quality food, lived up to my expectations and would go back."], ["Natalie P.", "Oh my goodness is this place the best! I wish I lived here so I could come all the time but in my short 4 day trip I came twice!!!!! Nicholas was the best server and the food was to die for!!! I got the fettuccini Alfredo and added chicken and it's the best fettuccini I've ever had! I cleaned my plate every time'! We had a lemonchello and the V Cosmo and were in love, definitely a must try. But goodness is this place delicious!! Can't rain to come back to Chicago to get more! A must stop."], ["Jade S.", "This is family style traditional Italian at its best. Be prepared for huge portions and friendly bubbly service.

We managed but it would have been nice if there was a bit more room to spread about."], ["Celina D.", "I'm not sure why people are raving about this place. The meatball should be called a dumpling it had so much bread crib in it. Yes it's tender, but only because it's 70% breadcrumbs! Sauce was super salty.

Great little Spot. \u00a0Tight seating so make a reservation."], ["Dana W.", "First off, prior to ever eating here I did NOT eat meatballs. Meatballs were just not my thing... I know strange.. everyone loves meatballs, especially at an Italian restaurant. My cousin and I stopped in for a quick bite midday and I order the Calamari and she ordered the 'Meatball Salad'.... I didn't even ask her what it was due to the word 'meatball'. She got full quite fast and the scavenger I am, went in for the kill and actually tried the meatball and liked it. Actually.. LOVED it is the truth. The meatball was seasoned well, not overcooked, it was by far my new favorite dish.. in the world. The Meatball Salad is so tasty, you can get it as a 'starter' prior to your main dish, or as your main dish. Whatever floats your boat really... but I highly suggest trying the amazing 'Meatball Salad' if you ever venture out in the West Loop... perhaps test it out before a Hawks game?! :)"], ["Jenn D.", "This place is awesome!! Get the meatball salad it's the most delicious thing ever. The owner is phenomenal, makes you feel like family in 2 seconds. Service staff is beyond amazing. Limoncello martini is fabulous! Never disappointed here!"]], "Briciola": [], "Osteria La Madia": [["Suzanne H.", "Back again. Menu had changed quite a bit with more pasta on there than I remember. \u00a0We went on a Wednesday night with no reservations. Sat in the front bar. Service was good, timely, made good suggestions. We split a mushroom pizza (as good as I remembered) and a salad that wasn't. But the greatest thing was the wild boar with pappardelle noodles. That dish was excellent. I wish we'd had the full portion instead of half. It was really good. House wines good as always. Still one of my fav Chicago places."], ["Blake M.", "Been back since and with the renovation of the concept, and changes, it's went super downhill. Servers have no idea how to make recommendations for wine with food, and when they do, they point at selections and say 'guests like this one.' \u00a0Who is training these people on the beverage?? Pretty lackluster showing. Wine selections used to be much more diverse too and showcasing fun. Now it's a lot of things that don't really stand out. Too many brand names and not enough stuff that is unique or different. This place used to be awesome and a perfect date night spot in River north. Now it's just another average place with above average decor.In river north there are much better options. Go elsewhere."], ["Josh V.", "When did they add the Osteria? I leave town for a few years and everything changes! Well, the menu here has changed a bit, but the food is still good. But the service has gone down hill. I recently visited for brunch and for dinner, and in both cases while the food was tasty, the meal took much longer than it needed to. For brunch, the restaurant was only half full and it still took close to two hours. And for dinner it took a very long time (I estimate 20-30 minutes) just to get our appetizers (bruschetta, nothing complicated) with no acknowledgement from our server.I hope they can get their act together, because their pizza is quite good (especially the triple pepperoni)."], ["Lindsey S.", "This place has excellent Italian food. I had the tagliatelle pasta and it was to die for. Their mushroom appetizer was really good as well. The wine we had was really good as well. The service was excellent as our server recommended everything we ordered and it was all really good."], ["Magdalen H.", "This place is GREAT. My friend and I were both from out of town, and I was leafing through a copy of Where Chefs Eat at Anthropologie, and one of the recommended restaurants was this one, a short walk from our hotel. We were tired and thinking of getting room service, but boy are we glad we didn't!The $1 bruschetta is a fantastic deal, and the mushroom one is one of the best things I've ever eaten. As a Caesar salad connoisseur, theirs is one of the best I've had- the deep fried anchovies were a nice touch. I had the gnudi the first evening (yeah, we came back the next night) and the tagliatelle the second- both were amazing. Eat here! The service was great, as was the wine list. I don't remember which wine we had, but we requested it again the next night. Delicious."], ["Joanna T.", "I seem to have luck in restaurants that begin with Osteria! I will, however, stick to the Osteria at hand. This is my second visit here and this gets 4 stars for the pizza. We shared the tomato and the arugula salads, which both were good, but the pizzas were very flavorful and both times I've taken one to go. Osteria literally means an establishment serving wine and simple food, and this is the perfect description, for both food and ambiance. Perfect spot for an early evening dinner. I wanted to try a pasta but I can't resist the pizza and I just can't say no to the tasty delicious carbs. Ahh, next time."], ["Michael W.", "Delayed Review: \u00a0 I Came here with a few friends back in MayFood: \u00a0 I ended up ordering \u00a0lamb meatball And coppa picante and burrata puglia, \u00a0The food was amazing. \u00a0 My expectation for this place was fairly high after reading the reviews. \u00a0It has met the expectation. \u00a0Nothing was overcooked, \u00a0nothing was under cooked. \u00a0that is a huge key for an italian restaurant to succeed. \u00a0 \u00a04/5 \u00a0Service: \u00a0Great staff service. \u00a0Attentive to details such as cleaning the plates as soon we finish a plate, \u00a0refilling water. \u00a0 Provided great suggestions. \u00a0 \u00a04.5/5Atmosphere: \u00a0I do wish this place was a bit more specious. \u00a0When we went, it was fairly packed and the tables were so close to each other. \u00a0 Other than that, it was fairly well decorated and very neat design place. \u00a04/5"], ["Kyle W.", "Cool, rustic vibe in a big space. Not as crowded or expensive as some other River North options. The pizza is excellent but there's lots of pasta and entree options if you'd prefer those. Plenty of vegetarian options. Try the white pizza with roasted grapes...delicious! It's nothing extraordinary but it delivers on what it's going for and is a reliable option."], ["Hannah C.", "Not everything is great here but the great stuff is pretty darn good. Get the triple pepperoni pizza with truffle oil, side salad, and spinach fondue. The fondue is not conventional, more just bread with sauce, but the sauce is delicious. The pepperoni pizza is really quite good - a greasy thin crust personal alternative to deep dish.We also tried the fennel sausage and burrata bruschetta. Neither was remarkable and I wouldn't order then again."], ["Anshul S.", "I had the white pizza here and it didnt turn out to be good, i would rather go for the white pizza at Coalfire pizza which is 100 times better than this.Just the fancy restaurant and prime location"], ["Dino A.", "After returning from taylor street, we could not find a restaurant open at 845 pm. We came to this restaurant where we were served by Alex. He was very nice and served us quickly. The food was delicious. We were surprised. The pasta was fresh and delicious. \u00a0The sausage pizza with Carmalized onion was fantastic. Excellent food, great service."], ["Elle M.", "I'm giving two stars here mostly because there are tons of better options in the immediate area alone. The food was decent, the pastas are homemade and solid. The grape and taleggio pizza was great, but the pork belly pizza fell flat. The dessert was sort of a joke- \"zeppole\" with gelato and Valrhona chocolate sauce is basically nothing more than a limp Krispy Kreme sliced in half and filled with crystallized ice cream and a weird spot of what I assumed was frozen chocolate sauce. I think the part that really made this meal hard to enjoy was the fact that it was about 80 degrees out with high humidity and they had the whole front of the restaurant open with no AC on. I mean you've got a pizza oven in the back! The restaurant was absolutely sweltering. Toward the end of the meal my mom actually had to leave and walk back to my parents' place because she couldn't take the heat anymore. I get that you want to have your windows open on a beautiful day, but it was not a beautiful day. There are so many amazing options for this type of food; next time I'd choose a different one."], ["Timothy N.", "A lively scene with great Italian bites. Start with a selection from their excellent, moderately priced wine list. Then onto the small, but highly efficient kitchen that turns out pizzas and a number of exceptional small plates with remarkable speed to pair with carefully crafted salads and cheese and salumi plates. \u00a0 \u00a0We didn't get a pasta, but what we saw flying past our table looked good. \u00a0Our main was a tasty Chicken Milano that put two breaded cutlets on a bed of ratatouille and orzo with an emulsified citrus eggplant sauce. \u00a0Tasty, inventive. \u00a0Maybe most notable was the moderate prices for this part of town, or maybe a sign that the competition is fierce with nearby Eataly, Pizzeria Via Stato and Quartino.Despite the frenetic pace of La Madia, the team service approach keeps the place humming, but I can understand some reviews from disappointed diners that fell between the cracks at peak dining hours."], ["Tina L.", "I love this place! It *might* be because I had an awesome birthday party here, but everything about the experience was wonderful. Even if you don't come for an event, and if it's a small group or date night...you will NOT be disappointed with your experience. Put it down.Let's start with the private event coordinator, Julie. She is the most professional, friendly, efficient, event coordinator extraordinaire! And she made planning (for my boo) so incredibly easy and smooth. From what he told me, she was quick to respond to emails and answered all his questions and made all the requested accommodations as best as she could. She deserves most of the credit for this beautiful experience (and maybe a little credit should go to my boo. Good job, honey!)We pre-ordered dishes from the menu for the party and we had dinner family style. This was a genius idea, since we all love to try a variety of dishes, and this way, we were able to try all of the delicious dishes that La Madia is known for. I have to say, all the food that we ordered were phenomenal. I can't wait to go back and dine, again!For starters, we enjoyed the Steamed PEI Mussels, cooked with melted leeks, fresh fennel, garlic, and white wine Brodo. OMG, we all wanted to drink the soup!We had the Beet Salad as well as the Romaine Lettuce Salad. Both were refreshing and delicious. I highly recommend them both! If you had to only pick one, though, I would probably go for the Romaine Lettuce again.I've listed the pizzas in order of most to least favorite, but I just have to add this disclaimer that ALL of them were really really delicious! Slagel Farm Wood Smoked Pork Belly (Tuscan kale, garlic, caramelized onion, caciocavallo cheese), Seasonal Wild Mushrooms (smoked mozzarella), Parma Classic (Mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, prosciutto di parma, arugula), and Clam & Fresno Chilies (Pecorino, garlic and fresh thyme). I think some of them are a tie...I don't know. They were all delicious in their own way!!~I was too full to try the Tagliatelle and Shrimp risotto...but everyone agreed that it was delicious as well. Hopefully I'll be able to go back again soon to try a couple new dishes, as well as a couple favorites that I'd like to eat again.One more note: if you order the limoncelli, it's pretty strong! Sip!"], ["Ziyan C.", "This is my friend's absolute favorite pizza place in Chicago and I was glad to get a meal here on my short visit!La Madia's definitely got a cool, sleek vibe. The lighting is dim and you feel like this could easily be turned into a happening lounge late at night with its modern, tasteful decor and a bar area that looks like the place to hang out. Yet you the kitchen is pretty visible, mostly out in the open, separated from the tables by a low counter. I had a full view of the pizza oven. Our reservation was for 5:30pm on a Monday night, which was unnecessary as only a few other tables had customers. We had a very professional, responsive, and efficient server, and overall had a great dinner here.PIZZA* Parma Classic (red. arugula, prosciutto di parma. $19) - 4.5 starspic: yelp.com/biz_photos/la-m\u2026The best pizza of the night in my opinion! I tend to like reds so I may be biased, but even for a red I thought the prosciutto was sharp and complemented the arugula and fresh tomato sauce really well. Their crust is thin and soft with a crisp, though not quite as fresh-out-of-the-oven as I'd prefer. The outer crust could've done with being a little more stretchy when I pulled it apart, but this is me being picky on a 4.5 star pizza!* Wild Mushroom (white. smoked mozzarella. $16) - 3.5 starspic: yelp.com/biz_photos/la-m\u2026Not a huge fan of white pizzas, and not a big lover of mushrooms, so this wasn't a winner for me flavor-wise. But it was well made and I will say the mushroom wasn't too overpowering and had a fairly well-balanced flavor. Overall I found it a bit bland though.* Moroccan Spiced Lamb Sausage (white. mint pesto. $17) - 3.5 starspic: yelp.com/biz_photos/la-m\u2026This was my pizza and it wasn't as impressive as I'd hoped! The sausage wasn't very spicy, and its texture was a little chewy, reminiscent of chain-restaurant delivery pizza. ENTR\u00c9ES* Tagliatelle (foie gras meatballs. $14 half) - 3.5 starspic: yelp.com/biz_photos/la-m\u2026This was exciting for me because foie gras isn't allowed in my home city of SF anymore. I couldn't really taste the foie gras to my disappointment though - if I hadn't been told what this was, I would have thought it was just regular meatballs. The tagliatelle was not as wide as I've had at other restaurants, but had a texture that was balanced between being soft and al dente. I found the sauce to be a little plain, and rather watery. It was nice to have the option of a half order.Menu: yelp.com/biz_photos/la-m\u2026"], ["Beth G.", "Went here last night with 2 friends- made a reservation on opentable which I always love. Our waitress was incredible and great at recommendations. We started out with the bruschetta and the pizza fondue dip. The FONDUE dip was amazing.

Overall great restaurant."], ["Jenna C.", "I miss the old La Madia and their delicious, reasonably priced pizzas. I've been going here for nearly 7 years and after a visit this weekend I won't return. The quality of service has declined, the pizzas are much smaller and now more much expensive. I used to contend their $12 margherita pizza was one of the best on the North Side. This last visit we ordered the Parma Classic and the arugula on our pizza was old and full of wilted holes.

The space is split into two sections, bar side with lots of light and restaurant side with booths and much softer lighting. \u00a0We both ended up ordering the Chef's lunch which consists of your choice of soup of the day or salad and a choice of pizza. I decided upon the salad and fennel sausage, onion and gorgonzola pizza. \u00a0The salad consisted of little gem lettuce, it feels and tastes like a butter lettuce and looks like romaine \u00a0lettuce, roasted tomatoes and a house dressing. The salad was crisp and fresh with dressing on every surface of the lettuce, yet it wasn't too soggy or overwhelming. It was simple and delicious! The pizza was piping hot and a great alternative to Chicago deep dish. All three toppings stood out. The gorgonzola really mellows out in the wood-fired oven. I was worried it would be overwhelming. The crust was thin, light and chewy. I eat a fair amount of food and was thoroughly full after 3 slices. I \u00a0also had a slice of my friends margherita pizza and it was equally tasty.

The wine list is really great - I actually haven't tried any on there that I didn't love.

One that they are known for, the Tallegio and Three Hour Roasted Grape Pizza, may sound odd but it's such a delicious marriage of salty and sweet that you will understand why it's one of their signature items. Also can't go wrong with the standard margherita but I have tried and loved the Spinach and goat cheese, the kale and pork belly, and a number of the other awesome pizzas. Bottomline, they have really delicious and creative ingredients that they put atop their chewy amazing crust and I don't think any of the pizzas could turn out bad.

My wife prefers the pomodoro, but myself and several others swear by the brown butter sage-short rib entree: slides right off the bone. Excellent. -bone in ribeye (w bone marrow): incredible flavor. Very nice cut they get daily from a butchery. -pork Milanese: so simple and so good.

Absolutely amazing!"], ["Mary T.", "I do not like Restaurant Week, I will not bore you with the why, but I'll simply say that we planned our dinner double date around places convenient to all and away from the RW madness. Through a happy accident, we failed on one account.We were happy to scoop up a last minute reservation for four on a Friday. When i arrived, I was warmly greeted by our patient and friendly server. Emphasis on patient. We were long overdue for a dinner and spent way too much time catching up and ignoring the menu.Had our server not pointed out the one RW menu tucked in with all of the other menus at our table, it would have gone completely overlooked. Afterall, we chose Enoteca Roma because we thought it wasn't participating. We gave it obligatory scan, passed it around the table and all looked at each other. It was a pretty fantastic deal; the RW menu had a pretty sizeable cross section of their regular menu items and included many of the items we intended to order. In the end we all went for it. After a round of drinks, we also ordered a few bottles of wine for the table.We treated the appetizer course as a shared course getting two portions of the bruschetta (each person could select three varieties), an order of the mussels and an order of the calamari. Of the starters, the calamari was my least favorite; not because it wasn't good, but the other dishes were executed so well. The mussels were delectable and a standout.For the Primi course, I went with the seafood risotto, which was quite good. I received a nice portion with generous amounts of seafood. The table also got the penne arrabiata, venison bolognese and wild boar ravioli. The dishes received rave reviews from my dining compatriots. For the Secondi, I went against the grain and ordered the pan seared whitefish with spinach and potatoes while my friends each got the polenta. I rarely deviate from pasta when I get Italian, but I loved my fish, it was moist and tender.By the time dessert rolled around we were pretty full. The three of us who ordered the chocolate raspberry truffle cake barely made a dent in it. The caramel cheesecake though was devoured by my partner in crime.I would definitely make another trip back to Enoteca Roma, the experience was great. We were also pleasantly surprised at how good a deal the RW menu was; the quantity and quality of the food was outstanding."], ["D O.", "Yum! Yum! Yum!I've been craving risotto for days and boy did their risotto hit the spot! It's rich, just the right amount of cheese, rice cooked perfectly, the spinach base was flavorful and fresh.... I'm almost drooling thinking about it now!We also had a bruschetta flight, also magnificent. Specifically, the roasted eggplant one had great texture and grilled flavor that went perfectly with the exact right amount of goat cheese. It was also artfully placed on top of the goat cheese, so that the eggplant bits didn't fall off. Brie and apple bruschetta had a lovely balance of sweet, sour, and creamy. Those were my 2 favorite, but the others were good too. For dessert we got the panna cotta trio. Again, the texture and flavor made me very happy. Portion sizes here are fairly generous. At lots of other places I can finish the entree in 5 minutes. Enoteca's entree was large enough that I had some left over to take home. There's a lot of other stuff I want to try on the menu.

This was some of the tastiest pizza I've had in my life. Next the price: for an app, a full pizza, and 4 glasses of wine our bill was less than $60.

YIKES!You must try the gnocchi, OMG it's so delicious. And the Lamb Ragu, my husband hates lamb but loved that dish, I woke up today craving it. That being said, things go down hill from there.My husband and I stopped in on a Tuesday evening a little after 6 pm. It was my birthday and I LOVE Italian food, since a tavola is with in walking distance to our place we figured we give it a chance. When we arrived we were the only table and were told by someone that they weren't allowing people to sit on the patio because they didn't want to move them later when it got to cold. Okay, it's a Tuesday, really you can't sit us where we'd like to be sat. Okay, whatever, lets move on. Our waiter is soft spoken and mumbles, so its tough to understand what he's saying sometimes and there is younger guy following him, although we have no idea why. He just stands there and stares. It's a little weird. My guess is he's training but I don't know maybe tell the table what's going on cause it was very creepy at times.The waiter explains the menu and how it's meant to be ordered which is fine by us. We order a bottle of wine and figure out what we want to eat while we wait for our wine. While the waiter is pouring the wine he takes our order and gets it mixed up a couple times, you could have just waited until you were done pouring the wine to take the order. We are still the only table.We order a lot of food, thinking leftovers will be yummy for lunch the next day. 2 salads, the gnocchi and lamb ragu and 2 entrees. The pork shank which is one of their specials that evening and the beef spare ribs. About 10 minutes after we place the order our salads arrive. Great perfect. Yummy salads, we enjoy them.We finish those and the plates are removed, at this point a couple of tables are now full and 10 minutes later our pasta comes out. They are small portion pasta and the waiter warned us so I wasn't surprised. I mean price wise it's a bit silly but they were both so good that I didn't care. We finish the pasta (which wasn't the original plan, we were going to take some of the pasta home but) they take the plates away and now we have 50 minutes to wait for our entrees. I get that they want you to relax and enjoy your meal but seriously. If the dishes are going to take that long then I suggest you tell the patrons that before they order. If I would have known I would have said screw it I'll eat more pasta.FINALLY our food comes out and my beef short ribs are swimming in a pond of brown broth. It doesn't look very appetizing seeing as the risotto is now drenched in a lot of liquid, but I try the food anyway. The beef ribs are very salty and the risotto is almost hard, like they've some how separated into these little bricks of rice. My husband says his pork is okay but not as good at the pork I had a few days ago at a different place on the north side.SO after all that waiting, we only take a few bites of our food and then sit for 25 minutes with our plates in front of us waiting for our waiter to return. At this point there are now 8 tables and our waiter is the only one on, so he's running around like crazy. Finally he comes by to check on us and asks if we're still working. We say no and he offers a dessert menu, my husband agrees that we'll take a look. Now we're not dessert people but we usually get something to share on one of our birthday's but this time I said no. I turned down my husbands offer for an after dinner drink, espresso, dessert, all of it because I knew it would take forever to get it. We were now out of wine and again it took 20 minutes for the waiter to come back and ask if we wanted any dessert. At that point my husband handed the waiter his credit card and asked for the bill because I was over it. I really wanted to love this place. Especially after eating the gnocchi and lamb ragu but the price is high the service is slow and I just didn't feel welcomed at all. It felt very stuffy, so we'll see if we go back. There are better places in the city I just really wanted it to be GREAT since it's so close to us.

So why the 3 stars?Sadly the portion/price was off. There were not a lot gnocchis for the price and the other dish we had (I forget now what it was) was also kinda small. We did also have the grilled vegetable platter app so that held us over for the night. But I guess if you are on a date and money is no object, this is pretty good.Apparently their patio gives out free money or something because while we were happily eating indoors, every party that came in asked for the patio and was disappointed when it was already full. Some even lamented they made a reservation just for the patio, but as the hostess repeatedly said, the patio is not guaranteed and first come first serve.

Small, quiet, romantic. I'm pretty sure I got bonus points for even knowing about it- A Tavola is so tucked away and non-descript that it feels like you're privy to a closely guarded secret. Unfortunately, it only gets 3 stars from me. We ordered a trio of different meats, served carpaccio style, which was wonderful. I ordered the gnocchi, which had been billed as their house specialty, and he ordered the short ribs on risotto. My gnocchi was pretty undercooked and as a result- gummy. My date tried it and concurred- I still managed to eat about half of the dish, but when pressed by the waiter, (\"...But it's our house specialty!\" ) declined to send it back. (New relationship- too nervous to come off as high maintenance, which I most likely am) His short ribs were great, much more flavorful. We got a bottle of red and spent probably $160 with tip.Otherwise, while nice, and tucked away, the jazz playing via cd on an old boombox under a server's station where we were seated upstairs kept skipping/stopping, and the waiter kept having to futz with it. That kind of kills the mood. (And really- CDs? Is this 1992?) Also, I wish there were more reasonably priced wine options by the bottle. Otherwise, still a good evening."], ["Amanda P.", "This place is as good as everyone said! I went here for a special occasion \u00a0and was very worried it would be just eh a dinner.

Wine was good, dinner was great. Gnocchi was great, I had it as an entree since I am a veg, the Beef Tenderloin was huge. Service was very attentive, but not overly so. Dessert was amazing, forget the name now but it was the vanilla one. Make sure you get it! Do not hesitate to go here for a great and memorable dinner!"], ["Casey F.", "My husband and I dined here last night for New Years. This place had been on our list for awhile after some friends recommended it. The restaurant is literally an old house and was really cute inside with a nice atmosphere. We started with a Tuscan blend wine which was delicious. The menu is designed to be a 3 course meal- first an appetizer, then a pasta course and ending with an entree. \u00a0We opted not to get any appetizers, mainly because nothing really jumped out on the menu. \u00a0For the pasta course, I ordered the gnocchi with brown butter and sage and my husband got the lamb ragu. I had high expectations for the gnocchi after reading various other yelp reviews and while I thought they were good, I have had better gnocchi elsewhere. They were super light and pillowy - so much so that my fork broke them apart when I tried to eat them. My husband's ragu was the show stealer. It was such tender braised lamb and a great sauce. Also it was a much larger portion. For our entrees I got the duck leg with garlic spinach and potatoes and my husband the braised short rib with saffron risotto. Again, his dish was by far the winner. My duck was overcooked. The middle was pink however the ends were well done and basically inedible. The spinach was the highlight of my dish. On the other hand, the braised short rib and risotto was amazing. So tender, so flavorful and the risotto was perfect. If I had ordered what my husband did, I probably would give this place 4 stars. Also our service was very slow. We were there for an hour and 45 minutes when we only ordered 2 courses. We were nursing our bottle of wine. Our server never checked on us during our entrees, which would have been nice considering my lamb was overdone. I didn't think this place was worth the money. Next time I want high quality Italian, I'll be heading to La Scarola instead."], ["Jeff S.", "Absolutely amazing. Atmosphere. Service. Style. Presentation. Flavor.I accomplished two major feats this week. One - I introduced 4 native Chicagoans to a tavola - in a city of fine restaurants none of them had heard of a tavola until I recommended we dine there based upon the recommendations of my fellow yelpers. Which brings me to Two - by now we should have four new yelpers!What an amazing experience. For starters, we felt like we were entering the restauranteur's home, as the restaurant is a refurbished row house. Upon entering, we received a warm welcome and were escorted to our corner table. From there, the fine service began. Everybody was completely attentive to our needs.The menu is limited on purpose, and for good reason. Many items are grown fresh in the backyard garden, and the pasta is made on site. So where to begin? A fresh spinach salad? Salad calabrese? (I had the Calabrese - completely fresh and totally delicious). Second course is a pasta. At the recommendation of many fellow yelpers, we had the gnocchi - and the yelpers were right. Best gnocchi any of us have ever tasted. I also ordered pasta tagliatelle bolognese. We passed it around the table, and all agreed that a tavola bolognese was the best we had experienced. On to main course. I had the filet, medium rare. Seasoned with olive oil and sea salt and cooked over wood it was outstanding. It was accompanied by sauteed spinach with garlic and roasted rosemarypotatoes. A lightly breaded grouper filet was also offered off menu, and three of my companions enjoyed this wonderful dish.The dessert selection included four items, all prepared fresh in-house. Of course, we tried all four accompanied by either cappucino or port (guess which I chose) and the meal concluded with smiles all around.A tavola is definitely worth a visit. I know that when I return to Chicago I will look forward to a return visit."], ["Anonymous F.", "My husband and I went to A Tavola for my birthday recently. Three stars: service was 1 star, the food was 5. So all over a 3 star place.We got there and the waiter asked if we wanted tap of bottled water. We requested tap water. He came back about 5 minutes later and asked us if we wanted bottled or tap water. OK, we were only one of two tables at this point. Bad memory?Anyhow, we ordered our food. They forgot to bring our salad, and we thought it was taking a long time.... One hour and 10 minutes after we sat down, they brought our main course. When we asked about our salads, they offered to bring them out, but at this point, we had hot food in from of us, and it was too late. Our waiter came by and made a comment \"oh, looks like they forgot your salad.\" I felt like saying, \"um, YOU forgot our salad.\" But whatever.The waiter also forgot to bring our wine that we ordered, and we had to ask for it. It arrived well after our food. While the food was fantastic, the waiter never once stopped by our table during the entire meal to see how everything was or if we needed anything. As mentioned, we had to flag another waiter down to get our waiter to get the wine.My husband had asked for a candle in my dessert (clearly NOT a big deal to me), but it arrived without. And finally, when the bill came, the salad was still on the bill. We tried to flag down our waiter, but because he was never checking on us, again, we had to get another waiter to get our waiter to ask that they remove this charge.Oh, also the 2 top we were at was like sitting on wooden boards, which it literally was. A Tavola was highly recommended to us, but we were quite disappointed, and will not return."], ["Yvonne Y.", "Solid Italian food with the pasta primi and meat/seafood secondi. \u00a0For the primi, we had the gnocchi and the daily special pepe e cacio. \u00a0Fresh pasta with the right amount of seasoning. \u00a0Only downside was the pepe e cacio was cold (supposed to be warm) by the time they served it. \u00a0Very tender beef ribs served over creamy polenta. \u00a0Easy to find parking.Older clientele averaging 50s."], ["Mahsa T.", "The food at A Tavola did not live up to the hype. The pear salad was lackluster. The brown sage butter gnocchi was decent, but the sage over-powered the whole dish, I've had better gnocchi at a handful of other restaurants. My braised beef short rib was good but exactly half of it was pure fat and bone that I could not eat. The risotto that came with it was runny and had a weird flavor to it because of the lemon zest. My dining companion liked his beef tenderloin. Good wine selection. We decided not to have dessert. A meal here can be quite expensive and I'd say your money is better spent somewhere else. The menu is extremely limited and if you have a limited menu, each entree better be phenomenal, but this was not the case. Nothing tasted authentically Italian to me. Atmosphere and dress are casual. You may have trouble finding this place, it looks like a house from the outside, no sign. It is in fact a house turned into a restaurant, the small living room is basically the dining area. Just a handful of tables with slow turnover so make sure you have reservations. The place feels cozy and service was excellent but the food is what matters and sadly, A Tavola did not deliver."], ["Melanie S.", "It rather pains me to have to drop two stars when my multiple previous visits were all worthy of five stars. I went again last night because it is (was) one of my favorite restaurants and it had been quite a while since I had been. A good friend was taking me for a belated birthday dinner and since we both loved A Tavola, going back was an easy sell. We didn't make a reservation, but since we arrived on the early side, we had no problem getting a table on their patio. It was a perfect evening to sit outside and enjoy a leisurely dinner. We wanted to start with wine but the wine list on our table was empty, as in the book had no pages in it. After we were finally able to flag someone down, we were given the wine list and we decided on what we wanted to order. I ordered a ros\u00e9 and my friend ordered something white that she couldn't pronounce (this will be important later). Our wine arrives and we're asked about our food selections. We always share an order of gnocchi to start and I opted for the lamb special, medium rare, and my friend went with the fish of the day. Our gnocchi arrives, already split, which I always appreciate, and while it was good, it just wasn't nearly as good as I remember. Our empty plates sat there until our dinner arrives...thirty minutes later. We were never offered second glasses of wine which we would have happily drunk. Our server simply plunked our plates down and scurried off. My lamb was frightfully overcooked but since our server didn't come back to check on us (I never even saw her on the patio after that), I couldn't send it back so I just ate it because I feared it would be another half hour before a new dish was prepared and I didn't want my friend to eat alone. The other odd thing was that both of our entrees were to come with potatoes - that's potatoes, plural. What we each got was one sad little new potato (and I mean tiny), cut in half. Did potatoes suddenly get really expensive? Last time I checked, they were one of the more cheap starches (hell, I used to buy a bag of them in college and subsist on them for a week), so why so chintzy, A Tavola? After we finished our entrees my friend decided she really wanted a second glass of wine but again, finding our server was next to impossible. When she finally came out, she had to ask my friend what she ordered. My friend said \"The wine I couldn't pronounce earlier.\" The server said \"Oh, I'll figure it out\" and walked away. The server must have passed by our table at least six times in the next ten minutes but never looked our way or delivered the wine. My friend got up to go to the bathroom and our server came to me and asked if she had ordered white wine. I said \"yes\" then she ran off again. By now, my friend returned and still didn't have her wine. I would have ordered dessert to enjoy while my friend was drinking her wine but we were never asked and since the wine situation wasn't looking so promising, we decided to just find the server and tell her to cancel the wine so we could get out of there. Again, we couldn't find her so my friend got up to look for her and found her and told her to cancel the wine. The server remarked that it \"was on the table\" and my friend had to tell her that it wasn't and to just forget about it and bring our check as it was getting late. The server then brings the wine, apologizes and tells us she won't charge us for the wine. Okay, great. Since we got the wine, I decide to order dessert so I can eat it while my friend has her wine. Again, it took our server several minutes to bring the dessert menu and take my order. I finally get my panna cotta and we eat and drink in a hurry as we've now been there 2.5 hours. Another server brings our check and asks us if we want gratis limoncello shots to make up for the long wait. It was a nice gesture but we declined as we just wanted to leave. An apology was nice, but it was kind of too late at that point (and it would have been more appropriate if it came from our own server). So all we wanted was a leisurely dinner, and by god, we got it. 2.5 hours later, we were out of there. I'm hoping the bad service was just a fluke, because I really love A Tavola and prior to last night I'd had nothing but good experiences there, but it may be some time before I go back and give it another try."], ["Tim H.", "I had the best meal of my life at a tavola.The place is totally unassuming, which I see some people consider boring, but I found charming and unpretentious. \u00a0Our waiter couldn't have been more friendly or helpful, and with so few tables, it was easy to get whatever we needed.But the food was unforgettable. \u00a0We shared a porterhouse that was flawless. \u00a0I thought I knew what gnocchi could be...but no, I was shown a greater thing. \u00a0If I was about to die, I'd ask the executioner for a tavola's panna cotta.To be fair, though, we spent a ton of money ($350 for two). \u00a0But it was without a doubt the best meal I've ever had."], ["Shelby B.", "Wonderful food, but an even more wonderful experience because of our gracious and lovely waitress, Aubrey. A fantastic time. Great pasta dishes, and wonderful dessert. Charming."], ["Alexis S.", "I am in b/t a 2 and 3 star review but overall I would not recommend this restaurant. It's cute on the outside but the inside felt pretty ordinary to me with not much decor to make it feel cozy (there are only 10 tables and its pretty quiet so you can hear everyone) or anything to make it unique. We also had a table right by the door which wasn't that great.. every time someone opened the door we felt the cold breeze and as people came in they waited by our table which was awkward. Our waitress was nice but she wasn't experienced, causing some problems later on. I think at a restaurant like this (which is expensive) waiters should be experienced. Two people at my table ordered the rack of lamb medium rare; their lamb came medium well which was really disappointing. Between our 2nd entree and 3rd (their are 3 courses) it took 45 minutes to get our food, which is really unacceptable (the table next to us, who came in 30 minutes after we did, got their entree before we did and they also ordered 3 courses). They did provide us with a free entree b/c the lamb was cooked incorrectly which was nice but still disappointing b/c neither person in my party could really eat their entree. Also my mom ordered a side of spinach with her pasta and they forgot it and brought it to her like it was a dessert course (the timing was very awkward). My arugula salad was simple but very good and I enjoyed my pasta. Just very disappointed in how they cooked the lamb and it took to long to get our food.

I asked for medium rare, and goddamn it, they gave me medium rare. \u00a0Perfect lamb. My boyfriend got the roasted chicken, which I wasn't impressed with, but he liked it. \u00a0The best part of our meal was the ambiance - this is a seriously romantic restaurant - the type where you can lean into your lover and hold hands and whisper and giggle.Cons: The roasted chicken came with a savory bread pudding, which was way too salty and buttery and greasy - quite below par for the rest of our meal, which was delicious. \u00a0Neither of us could stomach a second bite.The service definitely needed some improvement. \u00a0We had a reservation, and yet we still had to wait twenty minutes until someone even came by to get our drink order. When the waiter finally did attend to us, he said \"uh, has anyone come to help your guys or taken your drink order yet? \u00a0Oh. \u00a0I guess I'll be your waiter tonight.\" \u00a0The service was slow for the rest of the night, too, which was fine, because who cares when the food is good? \u00a0But when the waiter did come by, he was flustered and rushed. \u00a0He also didn't check on us even once after we got our first course, or even once after we got our entrees. \u00a0To be fair, when we got our bill, they hadn't charged us for my single glass of wine, and when I pointed it out, he said \"because things were crazy tonight.\" \u00a0I appreciate it, and I'm glad they were aware of the problem, but I'd rather have paid for my wine and had good service.Also, as yelper Shradha pointed out, they didn't really have good vegetarian options. \u00a0We weren't vegetarian, but we were scoping out the place for future visits with my parents, who are, and I can be assured that this isn't a place to bring them. \u00a0It's 2012, and vegetarians usually love Italian food - they should try to have something to accommodate them."], ["Heather M.", "This place is truly amazing, a total gem, and totally worth the schlep over to the area.

Nothing fancy here - just \u00a0really delicious food. I can't wait to go back with a big group and order one of everything on their menu. I was lucky enough to attend a cooking demo with Chef Dan, where he whimsically taught us to make his fantastic gnocchi (literally, the best I've ever had) with sage brown butter and tons of parmesean. I will be back to this restaurant for the gnocchi alone. He also taught a simple chicken recipe, and showed an awesome trick on trussing the legs (I'll let you go and find out for yourself.)After that, the man did something with oyster mushrooms that made them so flavorful and wonderful... it was one of the standouts on a giant table of delicious food. And they only had a tiny pat of butter!!! Amazing. (The portobellos, as often noted, are also delicious.

A Tavola might be Chicago's most boring restaurant. Based on my diet, it is not for me and I would not return. I eat fish but not meat, and that severely limited my options here. What I could eat was, at best, unmemorable and, at worst, completely tasteless. Meat eaters might have an entirely different experience.We started with a very good grilled mushroom appetizer (one of only two appetizers I could eat, the other being a boring preparation of mixed vegetables). I then had very nice, if unremarkable, gnocchi with sage and brown butter (the only pasta on the menu I could eat). My entree was the fish of the day (again, my only choice), an unidentified whitefish served with unseasoned (?!) potatoes and broccoli. This unbelievably unimaginative preparation was high priced hospital food. Easily the most bland dish I have ever had in Chicago and possibly my life. I could not believe how tasteless and boring the dish was, especially for this price.

Always a good thing. 2. Shows that you have breadth and depth beyond the stapled neighborhoods of Lakeview, Lincoln Park, Wicker Park and Bucktown. (But it's not TOOOOOO far). 3. A goodnight kiss. (If that is what you so desire). Ok, I can't promise this one, but play your cards right, order the correct wine, languish over some finely cooked food...and well, the rest is up to you, mmmk?A TAVOLA! It's an upper scale Italian restaurant on Chicago avenue nearing Western. There is a sign that whispers...but does not scream. There is no valet (but street parking is very easy). There's just A Tavola, sitting there inhabiting a former home, with a sprawling (city standards) back patio. It's a white-table-cloth-kind-of-place (and priced accordingly, for the most part). It's nice, but you won't feel under dressed in jeans and a jacket, or even just jeans and a button-up shirt. Girls, I'd leave the flip flops at home (but hey, I always think that). It's not a \"judgey\" place, but it is the kind of place you'll feel a bit proud to be at (and protective of), and thus...adorn accordingly. Typically at fancy-ish type restaurants, the food is small and perhaps unintelligible from the menu. At A Tavola you get wonderful homecooked classics with a twist, all freshly prepared and created that very night.

No. A Tavola is more like having dinner at a friend's house. A friend who grows their own lettuce for the arugula salad in the back yard. A friend who's fresh herb garden provides the added accent to many dishes. A friend who's mom must have come from the \"old country\" to be able to make food as good as this! We started with a couple of their appetizers. The portabella and shittake mushroom special was amazing. Marinated and then freshly grilled- who knew mushrooms could taste this good!

We then ordered two of the pasta dishes- the gnocchi (an extra large portion as my friend said he was going to take some home) and the pasta with the homemade bolognese sauce for me. Let me say right now- that there were no leftovers of either. Both were delicious! As for entrees- my friend ordered the red grouper which was the special of the day (served with caper sauce) and I had the grilled lamb with fresh spinach. These, too, were perfectly prepared and still were \"praise worthy\" the next day when I had them for leftovers. Finally ,we split the panna cotta. This rich dessert drizzled with vanilla sauce had a firm, fresh texture that made for the perfect ending to our meal. Service was outstanding. There were no missed steps and our server's recommendations were spot on. She knew her stuff. On the night we were there- there was a private party in the main dining area so we were seated upstairs. Upstairs lacks the ambiance but the food is just as good. If you are going to celebrate a special occasion- make sure you are seated on the main floor or you will miss some of the magic of what is A Tavola. Street parking is easy on this stretch of Chicago- just don't forget to pay the meter box. And there is no need to get dressed up as this place is casual yet nice.If you are looking for that special place to enjoy a night out with some great food, excellent service with an intimate ambiance, try A Tavola.

My finance had the arugula salad (all freshly grown in the back) \u00a0and I had the mussels and clams in a tomato broth. Both were a perfect start. \u00a0We split the gnocchi in butter and sage and I was somewhat disappointed that we shared as it was so good. \u00a0I wanted more! \u00a0The lamb and braised beef entrees were terrific and we savored the ambiance as we finished our wine.

Call your order in for faster service."], ["Janelle N.", "So delicious. \u00a0I had the seafood pasta with oil and garlic sauce. \u00a0The shrimp had a cajun seasoning that made the combo very tasty. \u00a0Bf had the chicken alfedo. \u00a0Very different with the cauliflower and carrots in it. \u00a0Both come with garlic bread and the portions are very generous. \u00a0The homeade lemonade, spiced iced tea, carrot cake and german chocolate cake are also good. \u00a0Going back to try the Gourmet Chicken part."], ["E W.", "Yes. Oh yes. I can't get off the tilapia dinner. It's expensive ($14 or thereabouts) compared to other places in the area, but it is worth it. There's never any leftovers to speak of when I order from here. Also, I love the lemonade & recommend it."], ["Kimberly A.", "Will never ever ever eat here again. I arrived at 8:00pm door was still open. I arrived at the register, reviewed the menu and then the male cashier informed me they were closed. As I am standing at the register what the heck! I go to the other side looking for the manager . The manager then decided to make the cashier/cook/prep/cleanup guy take my order prepare my 4 chicken wings I had ordered and then he begins to mop the floor. Once he decided he thought he should prepare my take out paper items he never washed his hands!!!!! Salmonella, disgusting bacteria from the mop handle and other germs. I asked for a refund and will never ever ever ever ever return."], ["Big Brown R.", "Chef Luciano! Fully Remodeled to fit in with South Loop's push past Cermak road, with seating, BYOB (although you can buy beer/wine) and food still has the same love.

Casual, yet comfortable, but great for carry-out."], ["M C.", "I'm not going to give away all the secrets I've learned about this place but I will let you know that you MUST EAT HERE, the food is spectacular and the people that work here are incredibly friendly and helpful. \u00a0The most recent (and fantastic) things I ate here were pesto pasta with shrimp, fried plantains, curry chicken and peri peri chicken and they were all totally off the hook."]], "Zia's Lago Vista": [], "Formento's": [], "Ameritalia": [["Erich B.", "The food was amazing. I had the pepperoni breadsticks and spaghetti and meatballs. It's very well prepared and melts in your mouth. Also the staff is very homey. Easy to talk to and make you feel welcome.

When I told the chef I was visiting- he kindly gave me lots of great recommendations to his favorite local spots."], ["Jean N.", "Awesome!!! \u00a0We have dined in and had takeout from Ameritalia for months now but the crowning moment was my 50th birthday party celebration last night. \u00a0Brad worked his magic in helping my husband select just the right menu and then worked even more magic in the kitchen! \u00a0YUM!!! \u00a0Pepperoni bites, bruschetta, garlic mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts, green beans,Chicken Saltimbuca and Beef Tenderloin (complete with Brad at the carving station)!His wife, Holly, is super smart; quick with a smile; and works so hard to make every detail just right!Congratulations to you two on creating a fantastic niche for yourself in the South Loop!"], ["Joshua W.", "This place is amazing! I live right down the street and just now got around to visiting. The lady that helped us was very friendly. We both had the Deluxe Stromboli.

We met some friends here after a busy day at Shedds aquarium. Based on previous yelp reviews I was not surprised when the food was as fantastic as people had said. I got the chicken parm and it was superb! The homemade pasta was perfectly cooked and the chicken bites were muy bien. My only complaint was that I wish there would've been more sauce. My friends got the parm burger, and they raved about it. I will definitely eat here again when I'm in the area!"], ["Jennie B.", "I had a great veggie calzone. The polenta fries were definitely worth trying!! \u00a0Daughter had meatball and pepperoni calzone and she loved it too!"], ["Aly N.", "I'm glad I found the Yelp reviews on this place. It's delicious! My friend and I shared the spaghetti and the parmburger. \u00a0It was all homemade and fresh. The meatballs were soft and juicy, \u00a0and the noodles were the best I've had. For this level of good, it does take a while to make, so don't expect fast food. The service was excellent, too...very friendly. Definitely give it a try."], ["William C.", "This is a wonderful restaurant with friendly staff and a delicious menu that is a new spin on traditional Italian food. The pepperoni sticks are a great appetizer. I was delighted to find all the food here was very crisp and clean and not at all greasy as I have found at many other Italian restaurants."], ["Ellen S.", "My Italian friend from Jersey wanted to find some Italian beef. \u00a0I looked this place up on Yelp. \u00a0He went next door to score a bottle of Chianti. \u00a0We spent the time chatting with the mother of the owner who's family was from a place in Italy near my friends origins. \u00a0The beef was wonderful and the whole experience was memorable."], ["Ezeibe A.", "I lived close by for 3 years, never stepped inside. I MISSED OUT!!!I was on the search for \"Italian Beef\", sort of like a Philly Cheese Steak, but...Italian? Any who, went in and had the Beef and Sweet Peppers (House roasted and sliced Italian beef with sweet peppers on a Spoletti). It was the best damn beef/steak sandwich I have ever had. Yes, the best.I don't usually write reviews after only one visit but I think this was worth it."], ["Zack D.", "Great choices, great location, the service is also great, \u00a0it's a creative pizza and American/ Italian restaurant. I definitely will come back next time I'm in the mood for Italian food."], ["Eric P.", "The meatballs and marinara in my calzone made me nostalgic for the sauce and meatballs my grandma and mom used to make. That's a very powerful feeling when food can take you back to childhood memories. There are many other things I want to try and I will definitely be back."], ["Matt H.", "Still saddened that Panozzo's closed, but Ameritalia is starting to win me over. \u00a0Ameritalia's vibe is a little different. \u00a0It's strikingly clean inside with a modern & minimalist decor feel. \u00a0 All of the food is made to order, so expect to wait a few minutes as they make your meal. \u00a0It's a small, casual space for dining, and it's BYOB.. though I'd suspect the vast majority of their business to be take out/delivery/catering. \u00a0Try the sausage stromboli though! \u00a0You won't be disappointed."], ["Eduardo P.", "Excellent establishment in the SLoop, and very accommodating. \u00a0For the Chicago Marathon last year, they allowed us to host a group of ppl at their place, and equally important allowed us to offer a customized menu for the group. \u00a0Two weeks before the marathon, I contacted them to reserve a table for 10, and to also see if they could make some items that were not on the menu, such as a pasta with Bolognese sauce. \u00a0They offered our group a delicious salad, three types of pasta, and cupcakes for dessert; everything was served family style. \u00a0It's a great place for a meal, and also for catering an event. \u00a0Cheers!"], ["Sharon H.", "My boyfriend and I were so happy that we found this place based on other reviews! We felt completely welcomed as soon as the owner/chef took our order. While we waited (maybe 10 minutes) for our food, we had a nice chat with the owner's mother. The food was delicious! We had the parm burger, which was juicy, cooked well, and bursting with flavor. The jojo potatoes on the side were also quite tasty. We had the Ameritalia salad on the side, which was made with fresh ingredients and dressed well.We'll no doubt be back to this warm and friendly family-run business to try more of the wonderful food!"], ["Brandon S.", "Me and my wife stumbled in here by accident. The food reviews looked great so we have it a shot. The food was amazing. Super flavorful home cooked Italian. The stuffed banana peppers where insane. Aside from the food, the place is really casual and comfortable and the service was great. The owner took time to chat with us and was so friendly. The passion for the food is obvious Id recommend this place to anyone and everyone. The other Best part was its BWOB so we bought a bottle of wine at the grocer next door and enjoyed it with our food w no corkage fee!!!"], ["Zac R.", "Pepperoni sticks dough was sooooo good but wish this item had cheese!Veggie calzone was great but wished it had more sauce.Sausage stromboli was awesome!"], ["Eliot L.", "The parmburger was one of the best burgers I've had. The rest wasn't amazing - polenta fries didn't really work (although they were much better once they cooled down) and the sausage stromboli was just good. The cannoli cupcake didn't really make sense. My partner the cupcake snob was underwhelmed, and I'd rather have a cannoli. But I'll definitely be back for the burger."], ["Kathy L.", "Drove down to check this place out as I wanted to see the area as well. Very friendly \"mom and son\".

I will go back if in the area again."], ["K B.", "Seemed like a family owned place which is great, and everyone was super friendly. Walked over to get a sub for dinner, but I was a little let down by the meal as I had high expectations based on the reviews. These are simple subs, nothing particularly memorable here, but happy to support a local business."], ["Louise S.", "A small local joint serving outstanding pasta, sandwiches and stromboli. \u00a0Me and my husband ate there tonight after visiting the Field museum. \u00a0It was a good choice. \u00a0The dough was delicious, and had the lovely complex flavor that comes from a long slow ferment. We had the polenta fries and pepperoni sticks for an appetizer. \u00a0Both arrived on the table in mere moments, hot and delicious. For a man we had the deluxe Stromboli and the meatballs and spaghetti. \u00a0Both were tasty. I was impressed as the spaghetti wasn't mushy but perfectly al dente and the marinara sauce was rich and smooth. It was obviously cooked low and slow for a long time as it had that great depth of flavor that only comes from several hours at low heat. \u00a0Many marinara are acidic and harsh with the amount of \u00a0herbs added, this one was perfect. We stopped eating early so that we could save room for a half a cup cake. Glad we did, the tiramisu cup cake was worth the space. If you are in the area and need lunch or dinner then stop here. \u00a0You won't be disappointed."], ["Alexander C.", "Owner is super nice and it's a byob in south loop with solid food. \u00a0South loopians know that's hard to come by. Don't expect the full restaurant experience with sexy ambiance and a waiter to guide you, but you'll definitely enjoy yourself. Good for a quick meal with friends or date. Great bang for your buck as well. \u00a0Go Grocer is literally next door, perfect for that byob. \u00a0Parm burger is silly good."], ["Sandy T.", "I used Ameritalia to supplement my finger food for a housewarming party. \u00a0They gave me a great list to choose from. \u00a0I went with the mini calzones which were a hit, meatballs and caprese skewers. \u00a0All plates were empty by the end of the night. \u00a0Great food and a great way to reduce the amount of cooking you need to do for a party."], ["Alex M.", "happy to see these guys open for business in the former Panozzo's space as of this weekend, and happier still to see cupcakes on the menu!!! [ the South Loop is kind of a dessert desert if you take away all the grocery stores.] \u00a0the cannoli cupcake was rich and delicious, w/a delicate frosting hiding all kinds of Italian goodies and baked chocolate imparting a little moisture to the cake. \u00a0the perfectly-cooked polenta-crusted provolone cubes were phenomenal: a unique approach to cheese curds that this WI boy would love to see take hold up nort'. \u00a0service was excellent, prices are great, layout is sleek and modern, and who doesn't love BYOB?Ameritalia's entrees left me pretty disappointed. \u00a0the parm burger consisted of 2 mounds of unseasoned ground beef w/irregular films of parmesan on a generic 250+ calorie kaiser bun w/blink-and-you'll-miss-them veggies, not at all what i was expecting from the description. \u00a0the cavatelli and cheese was also kind of a let-down--since white cheddar doesn't pack much of a punch the whole dish was pretty flavorless, though the texture of the very fresh pasta was appreciated.will be back to give their other mains--including grilled cheese and stromboli!--a shot soon"], ["Merrill O.", "Went with friends and ate family-style, so we were able to sample a lot different things. My faves were the Polenta Fries and the Stuffed Banana Peppers for starters, the Pamburger for the main (wow....those Jojo potatoes are amazing!!), and the Chocolate Chocolate Cupcake for dessert (lovingly baked by the owner's mom...she deserves a gold medal for the chocolate icing). Also solid were the Meatball & Pepperoni Calzone, and the Cavatelli & Cheese pasta. Excellent service....awesome owners....decent prices....and it's BYOB for now, with no corkage fee. Yep, I'll be back! So, don't let the casual atmosphere deter you...just have fun and enjoy the food!!"], ["Andrew L.", "Food was amazing! Great Stromboli and calzones. Service was even better!

We decided to come here for dinner on Fri night. Its a small, casual neighborhood place, with some interesting Chicago skyline art on the walls. The food was amazing!! I ordered one of their salads and hubby ordered the veggie calzone with a side of fried potatoes. The food is served in big \"kadai/wok\" like containers and it looked really cute. I loved my salad... fresh, simple and flavorful. The calzone was delicious. It came with a tomato dipping sauce, very much like marinara. The calzone dough was chewy, yet soft and you could taste the veggies stuffed inside. I quite liked it. I will definitely be coming back to taste other items on their menu. I take away half a star because, the ambiance could be a little more inviting and warm."], ["Lisa T.", "We have been to Ameritalia several times since it joined the neighborhood, and each time fall more and more in love with it.

We love being able to support a locally family owned business, and look forward to many more delicious meals from Ameritalia."], ["Michael G.", "I stopped in to Ameritalia to pick up food for dinner last week. The menu looked great and the meatball sub I got was really good. My wife got a great pasta dish. I am glad that I took my food to go though as the decorations in the restaurant look unfinished.

All-in-all, I was very happy with the food and will place orders for take-away from Ameritalia in the future."], ["Tyler P.", "I had the parmburger which was excellent!

I would recommend this place to anyone!! Try it!!!"], ["Shashank C.", "I had a parmburger... It was great! Really juicy patty, good size of meal.... The tiramisu cupcakes weren't great, so I wouldn't advise them. They were hard, not fluffy at all... But the burger was so good, that the cupcake is inconsequential :-)"]]}
