{"Birreria Reyes de Ocotlan": [["Jenn T.", "My Mongolian friend recently moved to Chicago, got married and also got pregnant in the same year~~ life goals achieved! So... one of her biggest cravings during pregnancy was goat meat, which is easily found and popularly consumed in her home country. I'm not familiar with Chicago's food scene as it was my first time visiting but being a birria lover from early childhood, I knew I could find a place with Mexican style goat soup. BOOM! Found one in this cute neighborhood not far from downtown Chicago. We immediately took an uber and walked right into it. They were doing street and building construction when we visited a few weeks ago so we may have easily missed it if it wasn't for the OPEN sign.The Birria was super rich.... Lot's of meat and available in either medium or large bowls. We got two large and shared between three people. They loaded us with warm tortillas and all the sides that you NEED to add to this tasty soup. The service was quick and clean.Lots of Latino locals frequent here with kids and the like of family and friends. Its more of a hole in the wall-hidden-tasty-gem. Worth the try! And my friend was so happy and satisfied.. I am sure she will be going there often now."], ["Tanya B.", "It wasn't great. There's a cheaper one closer to my house. This place does have good goat though. They were definitely generous with the meat when it came to the tacos. We heard about this place from a book \"1001 Places You Should Eat At Before You Die\". I think I could have happily died without eating here.The heartburn when you get home is TERRIBLE.TL;DR Nothing to write home about.. I guess I'll write a Yelp review though. Bring tums."], ["Ben N.", "We had a disastrous experience here.But it didn't have anything to do with the great Birrieria Reyes de Ocotlan or any of its welcoming staff.No, this one's all on me. \u00a0See, I accidentally turned our tiny two-top into an impromptu bowling lane. \u00a0With the \"pins\" set up in front of my wife. \u00a0Transmogrifying myself into a world-class doofus for a half-second too long, I carelessly allowed a bottle of smoky hot salsa to tip over. \u00a0Not only did it spray my wife's sweater, but it tipped over her Diet coke into her lap, flipped her taco out of its basket and onto the table, and dumped a bowl of dried chiles onto the floor. \u00a0Holy Baby Bejeebus: \u00a0Horrible, and incredible. \u00a0You can best believe that she was none too happy. \u00a0But luckily for me, my wife is a forgiving person!(Anyway, they say \"50 million Elvis fans can't be wrong.\" \u00a0Don't know about that. \u00a0But I say that 4 billion goat-eaters can't be wrong. \u00a0(Although goat isn't the most-produced meat on the planet--Western consumption of huge quantities of pork, beef, and chicken makes sure of that--it's apparently eaten by a larger percentage of the world's population than any other.) \u00a0I'd been waiting to get to a birrieria for a long time, and then I went and ruined the experience.)Our idea had been to do a mid-day taco/pupusa crawl on 18th Street, but I went and spoiled that, too, by being unable to refrain from eating too much food. \u00a0Ordered goat and cabeza tacos and a cup of goat stew here. \u00a0Order got lost in translation, and I ended up with an extra taco, and goat consomme instead of stew. \u00a0I had thought that the $2.50 and $2.75 prices for the tacos sounded a little high, but they are huge. \u00a0Nonetheless, I had no self-control, devoured everything (including the extra taco), and pretty much destroyed my appetite for the rest of our project. \u00a0Everything was terrific, as just about everybody else here says.Minor complaints: \u00a0The huge, succulent, juicy tacos come rolled up in wax paper, and by the time you get through your first one, your second (and third and fourth?) will already be getting soggy. \u00a0And as I noted above, my order got lost in translation a bit. \u00a0(That obviously won't be a problem for Spanish speakers, who are by far the main clientele here.) \u00a0But our server was very clear in communicating that the disaster I created at our table wasn't a big deal, and I was very appreciative for that."], ["Yumin H.", "DO NOT GET THE TACOS. Get the BIRRIA (goat platter)!Now, dont get me wrong. The tacos are tasty. We had the cabeza, lengua, goat, and goat liver tacos -- all were delicious except the liver, which tasted a bit like cardboard.But the birrrria.. Wow. It is luxurious and flavorful, with well spiced and moist bites of meat. Bright cilantro contrasts \u00a0the spicy yet thin and healthy broth. It is better than pho, and -- sorry, Chinese ancestors-- I might even prefer this to chinese beef noodle soup. It the stuff of dreams.So yes- don't get the tacos. Just get the goat platter (aka, the birria stew)."], ["Adam R.", "I already knew I wanted birria. That was the easy part. Chicago's birria selection vastly outshines New York's, and probably every other town on the east coast.

Birreria Reyes de Ocotlan is a temple to the taco god. Specifically the birria sect. Totally cool by me. I got the goat, because goat. And it was fantastic. Juicy, messy, flavorful, delicious. Everything I wanted.But after savoring my taco, the guy behind the counter gave me a free taco that I think was liver. He'd asked if I'd had one before, and I said no. Just like that, free taco.

With us walking a good amount and in need of nourishment, we came upon Birreria Reyes de Ocotlan. I've had this bookmarked for trips down to Pilsen and now was the time to finally check it out. If one were walking down 18th, this would be a place that you may just pass by and not really notice. Well, quite frankly you'd be missing out on some absolutely amazing mexican food. My friend and I only got a couple of things as we just needed some recharging. I got a beef and goat taco. I also made sure to get a small bowl of the goat stew. These were extremely wise choices by me as the tacos were just utterly killer. There was a ton of flavor to both tacos and it was really hard to decide which one was better. While the tacos were awesome, the stew was amazing. Granted, I did seem to order a bit too much (so I only had half of my stew), but this was subtle and complex. It really was something awesome. Birreria Reyes de Ocotlan was exactly what the doctor ordered for us. We needed a place to stop by quickly and take a few minutes to recharge. The fact that this was some of the best mexican food I've had also helped. Next time I come here, I'll have to spend more time as this sneak peek was a beautiful tease for what I can imagine that they bring."], ["Stephanie O.", "Great spot! Real deal mexican. Small menu but what they have they do really well. Out of the way south of downtown but definitely worth the trip. \u00a0I got birria (goat) cause that's their specialty, and rightfully so-delicious.

They were very nice! Cash only."], ["Chris F.", "Mexican goat soup. If you are a fan goat or lamb chops. You gotta give this place a try. They have some really tender goat meat and some goat soup broth that comes along with it. I've been here a few times. The last time I was here the goat soup was overly salted as if salt was on a black Friday sale. Also if you like super spicy they have this habanero pickled onions that will light your behind on fire. This is a nice hole on the wall joint. Think it is cash only too."], ["Joseph D.", "By now you've probably gathered this is the place that serves goat tacos and the meat is surprisingly tender. But in terms of flavor, not a whole lot going on. As we went there on a taco crawl, we of course had a goat taco so my review is limited to that item. Perhaps there are other dishes which fare better than the goat taco but unfortunately, I found it to be just eh.First off as stated, the meat was kind of bland with no real flavor.Then there was tortilla which simply fell apart as I was eating it. I expect the tortilla to be hearty enough so that I can get most of the way through before it splits and this was not the case.Then there were the toppings. Standard cilantro and onion but the hot sauce was well, not very hot. And I am super sensitive to spice and I didn't even sweat. Pretty mild, perhaps too much so.Overall an interesting concept (goat tacos) but given the other options in teh area, if you're looking for tacos, I'd say look elsewhere."], ["Cindy W.", "I had the tongue taco and split the goat plate with four other people. The tongue taco was amazingly tender and flavorful. Plus, they will give you a bowl of onions, cilantro, and lime on the side. The hot sauce was pretty great too. I'm very happy with the tongue taco but a little disappointed with the goat plate. The one pound of goat is meant to be split among 2-3 people. I would veer more towards the 3 side but we split it among 5. Though the meat was moist and tender, it didn't have as much flavor as I wanted. Perhaps it's just the taste of the goat meat itself. I did, however, enormously enjoyed the horchata. It's not too sweet and has just the right amount of cinammon.Also, the wait staff is INCREDIBLY kind and patient. They were really helpful and advised us on what to order when we took a tad too long.TIP: Cash only!!!"], ["Thomas N.", "Juicy and flavorful. You will get free refills of the soup and can keep going until you are filled. The meat was tender and the tacos fresh.

That's all you really need to know.I really loved Birreria Reyes de Ocotlan. The food is simple, wonderful, and addictive. Here's the lowdown:(1) Portions are large, but they'll happily wrap things to go. If you make a mistake and order too much you'll just have to \"suffer\" through great leftovers. (2) The homemade salsa is incredible. I didn't indulge in too much of it this time, since I wanted to focus on the flavors of the food alone. Next time, I'll take full advantage of this rich, spicy, and unique blend of flavors.(3) The cabeza tacos are unbelievable. They're tender, flavorful, and a must-try item.(4) Oh yeah, it's a birreria, right? Lots of goat. Actually, pretty much all goat. And it's very good.(5) This is a great place for sharing. Order the large goat plate (basically a large bowl of stewed goat meat in broth) and a few tacos. You will not be disappointed. (6) If you're not feeling too hungry then try a bowl of the goat consomm\u00e9 and a taco on the side. On a chilly day, this is a perfect lunch.Otherwise, just enjoy. The cabeza and goat are the best. I've had better tongue elsewhere but still do recommend it.

I do admit the goat head was my fav...so tender \u00a0that it just melts in your mouth. The tacos are pretty big and three is enough for one person. They also give you a bowl of pickled spicy onions along with limes. Warning these little pickled spiced onions pack a good amount of heat!

And it was, by chance, one of my sophomore English students that told me to go check out the restaurant his mom owns. \"You should go on a weekend because that's when I work!\" he said--the adorable little peanut face that he is. And so a co-worker and I did a little research and found the Esquire magazine article where Bayliss lists this place as his favorite fast-food. Other famous chefs were also interviewed, naming such obvious places as Dairy Queen, In-n-Out Burger, and Burger King--(seriously Guy Fieri and Bobby Flay??) Not that there's anything wrong with chain restaurant fast food meals--God knows I love me a Daily Double from McD's--but you could sort of tell Rick Bayliss had pure comfort food in mind. I ended up going with a few other co-teachers one hot August day right before school started. It was frighteningly warm in the place--a puddle of sweat collected beneath my running shorts in the booth and I know I looked like a red-faced gringo sitting there, sipping goat consomme and choking down the deliciously spicy pickled onions and peppers. But that's all part of the experience at Birreria Reyes de Ocotlan. It feels so much more special with it's 90-degrees outside, as if you're actually eating birria at some local favorite hotspot in Mexico. I now equate the flavor of chivo with warm weather and I have yet to visit Birreria Reyes when snow is on the ground, and I wonder if that will spoil the experience. On my first visit, I ordered the traditional meal: the goat meat served with consomme. It is accompanied by lime, cilantro, onions, and then a little dish of hot, pickled onions and peppers. I made individual tacos and dunked them in the consomme before each bite. The goat meat is absolutely outstanding--there is no gaminess, no odd flavor. It is tender, with little sinews of fat interlaced to beef up the flavor and provide the right amount of juiciness. I gave my student and his mother--the owner--a hug that day and was ecstatic to find that he presented me (and my fellow teacher accompaniments) with a Mexico soccer jersey with their advertisement on the back at school the following Monday. I'd be happy ordering the same thing at this place every time I went, but my student enticed me to the other menu items. \"Would you like to try a cabeza taco?\" he asked one Saturday afternoon.Hell, yes.And there it was---all tender and flavorful without a gristly part on it. It was a heavy taco, stuffed with cabeza, but not at all runny. This wasn't a taco that with a disintegrating tortilla. No, this was a perfectly made cabeza taco with onion and cilantro. I told him how good it was. \"That's because I made it,\" he beamed and brought me out a few samples of Mexican candy and some fresh pineapple juice. I've come to the conclusion that birria in Chicago is like what the \"world's greatest cup of coffee\" is in New York. There are hundreds of places that claim they've got the best there is--even several right in the same neighborhood as Birreria Reyes.

They make birria, which is a goat stew. I've had this stew before in Mexico and since it was 100 degrees out I decided to pass on that and went for the tacos. Their menu is simple (basically goat and a few types of tacos), but there were definitely some items that were new to me (cows head, goat liver, tongue). I opted for 2 tacos and I'm glad I did two instead of three because these were quite filling. I got the chiva (goat) and cabeza (cows head). Let's talk about the cows head first. This taco is filled with various parts of the cow's tender head meat (brains, cheek, eyes, tongue), but if no one told you what you were eating you would just think it's the tenderest, juiciest beef taco you've ever had. If you can get past the idea of what you are eating, or at least convince yourself that it's something else, then you are in for a treat. The goat taco was also pretty good, but I've had goat a lot before so this wasn't as new and exciting as the cabeza. These tacos were packed full or flavor and were the type that needed two tortillas. I paid about $6 for the two tacos and a horchata - not a bad deal at all. The only complaint that I would have is that the air didn't quite seem to be working at full speed so on a hot day it was not as comfortable as I would have liked."], ["Chan K.", "I ordered the \"chico\" \u00a0plate and got a ton of food, enough to serve 2 people for sure. \u00a0The meat was flavorful and melted in my mouth while being pretty lean for goat. \u00a0I enjoyed both the meat on its own in self-made tacos and making a stew by putting the meat dried peppers, onion, cilantro and lemon juice in the absolutely amazing consomme. \u00a0The consomme is rich, earthy and complex. I can probably down a quart of this stuff on a cold day. \u00a0The side of pickled peppers and onions were a nice balance to the bold, pungent flavors of the birria. \u00a0I just wish it weren't so hot in there and that the servers were more fluent in English."], ["Joe B.", "So after reading an interview with Rick Bayless in Esquire magazine (something about street food favorites of top chefs) I decided to give Birreria a try. Not that I need an international superstar to force me into eating amazing tacos...it's just that this place would have been lost in the sea of pedestrian tacquerias on 18th st otherwise. Ah, yeah, so anyway....amazing. And here ends the review. OK, fine...I'll continue. I started with 3 of the goat meat tacos and wolfed them down in about 12.7 seconds. The horchata was also very fresh and tasty, and I generally just do not like it--so that was another pleasant surprise! When the server came back with a polite \"mas?\" the answer was a resounding \"SI!\" My friend ordered it up, and we awaited.....ROUND 2Aforementioned friend hands me a taco. I ask him, \"is this the beef that you had earlier?\" He says, \"yeah...it's beef.\" So I take a bite into the juiciest, most tender and delicious beef of my life and he says, \"so, how do you like cow head?\" Uh, evidently I love it. So when in Pilsen and in the mood for goat meat and brains...please stop by the Birreria. But seriously people, don't screw this up for the rest of us. This is really not the place that folks outside of the neighborhood go to, so help me keep it my little secret.

I stumbled into this place after a long, cold walk from UIC and was immediately overwhelmed by two things: the extreme humidity in the restaurant, and the luscious smell of goat. This sort of restaurant is truly a refuge from the Chicago winter. The next thing that struck me was how homey the entire environment was, from the decor to the people. The restaurant was virtually empty, but this was absolutely fine. I split a pound of birria with two friends, which was just the right amount. One thing that was distinctive about the way Reyes de Ocotlan serves their birria is that it's accompanied by an entire bowl of soup, which is more of a meaty stock. It's definitely enough to go with your meat and drink by itself. Their tortillas come nicely charred. The horchata was also very good. Another perk of eating here -- it's two or three blocks away from Don Churro. Mmmmmm..."], ["Arthur M.", "The goat is good."], ["Janet E.", "I tried a little bit of the goat stew (they are known for it) and it was very good and flavorful.

This past mother's day weekend I decided to take my Tejano mother to eat one of her favorite meals at this quaint little birria joint in Pilsen. Let's start with the service, they were quick to attend to their customers, friendly and very hospitable indeed. When I walked in the door, I didn't even have to look at a menu, my mind was focused on one thing and one thing only, rolling up my sleeves, putting the napkin on my lap, opening up my can of soda and getting ready to just dig in. The aromas of birria steam danced circles around me, seducing all of my senses. \u00a0I went right to ordering one pound of birria to share, which is a very nice & plentiful order to share. All of the add ons accompanied the one pound of meat...a nice plate of cilantro, onions, and limes. Each of us also received a nice steamy bowl of their very tasty consomme and over a dozen of hot and ready tortillas de maiz. The meat was tender, it almost melted in my mouth. I made myself a few tacos with all the condiments and dipped each bite into the consomme and not once did I mind that the juices of the meat ran down my arms and sleeves. And that tasty bowl of consomme, was good to the last drop, I had absolutely no shame in pickin' up that bowl and drinking it until the last drop of it went into my mouth. :) Like I said, I knew when I walked into this place, I was ready to do some serious birria-eating business. For just about twenty dollars, we both ate a meal that was fit for a king. I'm going to say that the name REYES (meaning \"kings\") might be the name of the family that owns this little hot spot, but REYES could also define that this birria itself has a definite ROYAL quality of impeccable flavor. All I can say is that if the American guru of Mexican cuisine, Rick Bayless gave this place some major props, then *you* know it is thee place to eat! I can't wait to go back!

The service was friendly and quick, which helped us get in and out in a little bit of a rush.At the end of the day, I have to say that there's not a lot to distinguish these tacos from the tacos I might get (and pay less for) at a place like Los Comales in Aurora.

The root vegetable chips served with the salsa were tasty.Side note: I took my husband here for his birthday and before we went, I told two different people that it was his birthday and asked if they could put a candle in the dessert or something of the sort. I was assured that this was something they did. When our donuts were served, they were placed on our table and the woman turned to my hubs and said, \"Happy birthday!\" Don't get me wrong, that is nice, but not what I had asked for, nor what I was told I was going to get."], ["Craig C.", "No Mas.Small plates could work here if the food was good. The ceviche was way too salty and gross. The fish and ribeye tacos are pretty mediocre, the best one was the chicken tacos, which actually turned out to be chicken taquito things, but was still pretty good."], ["Michael G.", "Went for Sunday Brunch. I had the Mas Benedict and my girlfriend had the Verdologas. Good blend of savory and hearty without being greasy. Service was very attentive. I enjoy brunch but don't like waiting 45 minutes for a table on Randolph street. Mas is just down the street (from Randolph), the food is great, and there is no wait to be seated. We'll be back."], ["Kiki P.", "I went to Mas with 5 people and we all ordered a variety of small plates. Everything was amazing. We started with the guacamole and 3 salsas and then ordered a little bit of everything. There wasn't anything we didn't love. The watermelon Margarita was so good. I should also mention the service was exceptional - really sweet and accommodating to our party."], ["Chirag P.", "Dead, when I got there, dead when I left there... don't no why.

Very good food. Great service. \u00a0High end restaurant, very worth it."], ["Jennie C.", "Food was decent. I can't stop thinking about the guaji-machi ceviche, though I'm surprised to find cooked fish instead of raw. Did not like the fact that you can only order 2 or more of each taco variety. Meatball was huge but not bad if you like meatballs. Lamb dish was too skimpy for the price and the lamb was way over-cooked. Drinks were tasty. Hated how the music got so loud as the night progressed it felt more like a club than dining room. They do takeout so I'll probably just do that next time."], ["Dean A.", "Drinks are creative and tasty. The food on the other hand not the greatest atleast what I tasted. Both the watermelon margarita and the worcestershire sauce based michelad were on point, especially the chelada which is rarely found outside Mexico in that style. So why two stars? The food! Had the ceviche mixto and was by far the worst ceviche I have ever had in my life. The chef who made it completely lacked inspiration; boiled seafood with a hint of tangerine flavor and pickled shallot is not ceviche - it is, at best, a Mexican seafood cocktail. Worst yet, adding unrippened avocado to this abomination hit the nail on the coffin. Didnt bother with any other food - \"french\" style mexican food isn't worth paying for if they can't do basics right."], ["Leila T.", "Update: based on my comments below and the fact that we ordered 1 appetizer, 2 drinks, and were only there for 20 minutes max, and based on the not pleasant experience we had, I only tipped 15%. Come to find out the amount on my final bill was changed to incorporate a higher tip. Which is fraud. I will never be returning.Mixed review.Watermelon margarita was good and refreshing, not sure if there was much booze in it.Cucumber jalape\u00f1o margarita was HOT!!!! There were jalape\u00f1o seeds within the drink. If one happened to get into that sip you were taking, you were doomed. Very very spicy.We got the signature three taco flight and the fish one was good, so was the steak one, but the pork belly was awful. Pork belly should be crisp this was mushy and sooo fatty.

Conveniently min away from the Theatre District where we enjoyed a great comedian and then ended the evening with a fantastic meal.We started with the Chicharron Guacamole (the plantain chips are a nice touch) and a couple of the Agua fresca and Bramblin drinks, shared the two taco samplers (taco flight - really glad this was added to the menu as an option so that different tacos can be sampled).

I took my servers recommendation and went with the Fiesta Mole, loved all the sauces but the macadamia was my favorite. Overall the food was great, most importantly our service was terrific. We initially decided to sit on the patio as it was a nice day out, however after a while it started getting very windy (surprise surprise, right?) so we asked to be moved inside. They were able to accommodate all 6 of us inside very quickly. We ended lunch with a tres leches cake, take my advice and try it, you will not be disappointed. The overall experience was great, our server explained some of their main dishes and their origins, as well as a bit of history on the restaurant. I'll definitely be back on my next visit."], ["Lissie B.", "I love this spot! New Rebozo is a hidden gem right, quietly tucked away in Chicago's Mag Mile tourist scene.

They make a mean margarita too (an important, but oft disappointing, staple for Mexican dining)!This place has wonderful service; they are very accommodating with gluten free options - yay! - and other food allergies/dietary restrictions. When I dined here my birthday with a group of friends and they brought out a dessert and a little toy car - how adorable!But seriously, that mole!"], ["Laura V.", "Second trip:Soup was still amazing, they didn't split it for us (like before) so it was very messy to share...

The restaurant makes 16 moles but only serves 6 per day. It was an amazing treat. My favorite was the pumpkin mole but I honestly I wish I could have an IV of all six! The restaurant is a must go if you are in Chicago. The guacamole was fresh and tasty and the nachos were also warm and salty. Ensalada de Nopoles gave me a chance to taste a Mexican specialty that was delicious. \u00a0Tamal de Mango was also quite tasty and decadent. Overall, a great meal and almost a 5 star."], ["Simon S.", "This place is a great find. \"Avante garde\" Mexican!! Gourmet! Every meal was a taste sensation. Reasonable portions and great margaritas.

Recently, I visited New Rebozo nestled in the neighborhood of River North, it is a real gem among many branch restaurants near by shops and offices so if you work in the area and want to grab lunch or dinner or if you live in the area and want a delicious breakfast lunch or dinner or even if you are shopping and your appetite starts to tell you is time to eat. Go to New Rebozo. The ambience is perfect, very intimate and the decorations are of an authentic traditional restaurant in Mexico City, San Miguel de Allende, Tepoztlan or Oaxaca City. It brought me memories of dinners with friends in my beloved Mexico City. I felt I was in one of the restaurants of Coyoacan in Mexico City, \u00a0with everything from the venue to the food presentation and the flavors have remarkable depth. I had a great waiter a guy from Mexico City as wok and everyone else were very attentive efficient to any of our requests. New Rebozo has traditional gourmet authentic Mexican food. You won't find burritos or chimichangas there because those are not typical of Mexico. My husband had a \"chile en nogada\" a true delicatessen of Puebla Mexico. I highly suggest you that item and it is a seasonal item since one cannot get all the ingredients all year long. They also suggested a fiesta del mole. I do love mole and I am very picky when it comes to mole but these moles were delicious. I can't wait to be there soon everything is home made. The ingredients they use are fresh from local farmers and providers which not only makes the food fresh but is an excellent option to support the local economy. I highly recommend New Rebozo \u00a0to anyone who's got a hankering for great food, foodies, maybe someone who is trying new, enjoys a romantic and artistic atmosphere and appreciates a great, attentive & positive staff! Stop by you won't regret it."], ["Wilcox A.", "Beautiful fresh flavors. \u00a0Good tequila selection. \u00a0I LOVE mole so this place rocks. \u00a0Absolutely not your corner Taco Bell. \u00a0 Really good upper level food."], ["Sean G.", "We had a really great experience at New Rebozo. \u00a0Showed up without reservations on a Saturday evening around 7pm and just had a short wait. \u00a0Reena, the manager there, is outstanding. \u00a0She was seemingly apologetic that it took so long for us to be seated. \u00a0I was thinking to myself 'really?' We showed up without reservations on a Sat evening in Chicago a block off Michigan Ave and she is feeling bad? The service was great. \u00a0While mole is their strong suit (try the fiesta mole!), I was really feeling in a the mood for the Tacos al Pastor. \u00a0I got a side of spicy sauce and the tacos were amazing. \u00a0So tasty and they were full of tasty pork. \u00a0Just the right amount of sweetness from the pineapple and every bite was delicious. \u00a0The Camerones al Aljillo were also supurb. The shrimp were cooked to perfection and the flavor was great. \u00a0For dessert, we had the eggnog and chocolate flan. \u00a0Both were stellar. \u00a0I believe the eggnog flan was a new offering. \u00a0The chocolate was really really good. \u00a0All of this while sitting on the patio out front and the temps in the mid 70s. \u00a0The inside looked perfect for a date night or relaxing evening out with friends. \u00a0This place will definitely become part of my Chicago rotation!"], ["Carol K.", "Let me go on record that while I LOVE the New Rebozo in Oak Park, this city version left me feeling a little underwhelmed the other night.Was it because Chef Paco was not there with his infectious \"ohmygodohmygodohmygod\" effusive welcome? \u00a0Or was it that on this busy Friday night there was only one server who raced between tables but who was not able to keep up with the demand? \u00a0Or was it that this place just lacked the charm and character that I have come to associate with New Rebezo?Whatever the reason, while the food and signature margaritas were good, there was just something missing for me. \u00a0And my friend who I dragged along felt that it didn't live up to my ravings either (yes, I'm a big fan of Chef Paco!)We started with some guacamole which was creamy and delicious. \u00a0My friend went with the signature dish which are 6 small enchiladas smothered in the house made mole sauces of the evening. \u00a0Her favorite was the chocolate. \u00a0I went with the steak tacos which were quite tasty. \u00a0And while we would have happily sat and drank for awhile, it was impossible to get the server's attention so we ended up flagging down a bus boy for our check and we left.The ambiance is rather stark with hard wooden backed banquette along the wall. \u00a0The patio looked darling with it's brightly colored umbrellas but it was too cold to sit there on the night we went.If you drive, the bar across the street has valet parking or there is a parking garage around the corner on Rush (but know that option is expensive ($35)I think it was an off night given the rave reviews on Yelp. \u00a0But if anyone has been to the Oak Park location, this just lacked any of the personality of the original. \u00a0It's going to be a hard sell to get my friends to go back."], ["Jeff J.", "This is the New Rebozo--apparently the old one is in the suburbs. If you can eat here without thinking about our 37th president, you are younger than me. No one can hear the name Rebozo and not think of Dick Nixon and his BFF, the alleged mobster bagman, Bebe Rebozo. But I digress.This Mexican restaurant serves much better than average food and has way better than average service. The servers will explain the menu, show you pictures of menu items on their IPads, and bring you samples to taste. Plus they are very pleasant to chat with. Can't ask for more in the service department.So what do they serve here? The chips are superior and the salsa is great, with just the right degree of heat. Jicama salad was refreshing and well presented. I would have preferred more cilantro and lime though. By contrast, the house margarita, though made with better than average ingredients, is premixed. The result is acceptable but nothing to write home about. The real star of the show are the moles. The chef has 18 moles and makes 1 every day, so 6 are always available. You can get them all in one dish, the fiesta mole. This is 6 enchiladas each with a different mole and fillings of your choice. The moles I had were all good, especially the mole poblano, but also pumpkin, walnut and hazelnut. The fillings were tasty, guacamole, chicken, and beans, but not the cheese--it was bland and barely melted. This is a special dish you won't get elsewhere, because few Mexican restaurants make more than one credible mole, and it's always mole poblano. My only slight quibble is the dish comes with no sides, like rice or beans; you have to order them separately. Really? I didn't order dessert because they were \u00a0out of flan.P.S. Here's a link that will tell you what a rebozo is, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re\u2026, and this link will tell you more about the notorious Bebe, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch\u2026.So I say, raise your margarita to toast Nixon's memory and enjoy the moles and service at the New Rebozo."], ["Kris F.", "Chef Paco is passionate and thoughtful about his cuisine.

My wife and I went just after 5:00 and there was understandably few patrons there. There were however a large number of waiters and a couple hostesses. A curious decision they make is making people wait 5-10 minutes to be seated while they are doing.... I'm not sure what. This happened every single time a new patron came in. The patrons were put off, while the table was \"readied\" in an almost empty restaurant. Then, echoing other reviews, the waiters were simply AWOL often.

Then came the Fiesta de Mole, which was so exciting. 6 different sauces, and I went with the chef recommended fillings, 3 cheese and 3 chicken. Filling was delicious, and the moles were all excellent. Rich, smooth, and flavorful. I loved the guava the most, and then it was a tie between peanut and pumpkin seed for second place.

Sat in the outdoor patio seating just off the street which is nice and just below street level.Service was pretty good no complaints there. Food was pretty good too though not the best I've had. Got the enchiladas sampler and honestly I couldn't really tell a difference in the various mole sauces even though I'm pretty sure they should be pretty distinct. Regardless, it was tasty. Also had some margaritas which were tasty as well. With a lot of places in the city to try I'm not sure I would immediately think of this to come back but certainly worth the try."], ["Grego B.", "Excellent restaurant, service is great but food is even better.

One was steak, one shrimp and the the last pork. Each one was fabulous in its own right. They were fresh ingredients and the flavors were unbelievable. Our son had a chicken dish with a multitude of sauces. He could not identify the best since they were all fantastic.We had premium margaritas and monitors.

However my husband is a big fan of Mexican and he also prefers low-key places. So I looked at a few similar places when I was preparing to surprise him for his birthday. I couldn't have made a better choice! This is the cutest and most unique little restaurant, with the most personal approach where chef Paco comes out to you and offers you his most successful creations based on your preferences. He managed to satisfy a foodie like me with his stuffed chili pepper (it knocked my socks off) and yet made my son some steak quesadiallas he enjoyed (with unsophisticated taste buds of a 12 year-old) \u00a0My husband loved everything we shared as well a quick service and laid back atmosphere of this wonderful place!"], ["Stella W.", "OMG...now i don't have to travel far to the Pilsen area to get a really good yummy mole!!!

Our server was really nice and attentive. And her advice of picking the cheese and chicken enchilada for the moles were right on...I really loved chorizo, so I asked her if one of the 6 enchilada can be chorizo and the chorizo flavor did overpower the moles that goes with it, just like she had adviced...the cheese and chicken ones were more mild, so the moles flavour comes through...and the chocolate mole was on the chicken enchilada while the pecan one was on the cheese enchilada...lolthe special grilled pork dish and the new rebozo soup were all really good and flavourful too...love the slightly creamy horchata...Such a hidden gem! :)"], ["Chris B.", "This place is a real hidden gem! We were here for work and we're looking good Mexican place. The bigger places were all full so we decided to give this one a try. We were not sorry! The service was excellent, very attentive and quick. The food was amazing. Lots of unique choices like lobster empanadas and I had some delicious steak tacos.

The tables were all full but it's not too loud inside; this is my second time here (the first was cinco de mayo) & we were so pleased by the service. The chef came out to tell us about some specials on the menu and give us a little lesson on their mole varieties, which is his specialty. We ended up ordering the stuffed poblano pepper (SO GOOD. I wish the pepper was bigger so I could savor it longer) & the fiesta mole dish (six enchiladas so you can try all six mole varieties). Both dishes are something I would definitely come back for! Prices are expensive for Mexican food, but I definitely see why--this is some high class stuff that is worth every penny. The only knock I would have against the restaurant is that their margaritas are a little small. They have a number of delicious flavored ones as well; I'd recommend the tamarind. We'll be back!"], ["Tarek E.", "Yes, it's true: These are the best moles in the whole city. My friend ordered the steak tacos which were the best he ever had.

The restaurant is in a small area surrounded by bigger restaurants. \u00a0Don't let that intimidate you. \u00a0It just makes the experience more special.We started out with a tamarind shaker margarita. \u00a0Our server gave us the history of this fruit and told us how they prepare the pulp from scratch. \u00a0Well we had to try it and it was FANTASTIC! \u00a0One bottle of margarita served us both for the entire meal. \u00a0The fresh tortillas and homemade salsa were incredible! \u00a0The salsa had a slow heat.I ordered the Tacos Pacos with chihuahua cheese on the side, plus rice and beans. \u00a0I don't care for onions much, so I would ask for none next time. \u00a0The accompanying sauce is phenomenal. \u00a0The corn tortillas had a nice mild flavor and were supple. \u00a0Super!My daughter had the kids steak quesadilla. \u00a0She loved it and adored the rice!My husband went for the fiesta mole ~ a combination of 6 enchiladas filled with cheese, chicken, or beans. \u00a0It really doesn't matter the filling. \u00a0The moles are the star of the plate. \u00a0Chef Paco rotates through a variety of moles each week. \u00a0There are amazing, unique, unprecedented flavors that may make you hesitant, but don't be. \u00a0He is an amazing chef and foodie. \u00a0My husband finished the plate. \u00a0The original restaurant is in Oak Park (for 23 years) with the downtown Chicago 2 years old ~ our server has been there the entire time, is an expert in moles, and is the best!! \u00a0Chef Paco is a darling, an expert, and an artist. \u00a0We spoke with him several times throughout our lunch ~ he is genuine, sincere, and really concerned about our enjoyment of his restaurant and food.This was an amazing experience. \u00a0The restaurant was quiet for Sunday lunch (but weather was cruddy). \u00a0We plan to go back for dinner before we leave town on Tuesday. \u00a0This is truly a gem and must be shared with EVERYONE!"], ["Christa Lei S.", "Admittedly, this is my go-to date place for Mexican food. If I haven't brought a date here, I've definitely tried to... Whoops, guess that's my tell. ;) I used to come here more often when they had just opened-- but wouldn't mind coming back. In any case, it's a smaller restaurant, tucked away in a small area right off the Chicago red line. The moles are BOMB but use nuts-- so if you or your date have a nut allergy, you might want to veer away from that. I like the atmosphere, and it's romantic enough for a date, but lively enough so that it doesn't feel ultra fancy. I believe the lunch and dinner menus are basically the same, with the same prices... So no need worry about ripoff pricing. I've seen Chef Paco around during the afternoons, interacting with customers... Though this may not be the case now. I'd suggest any of the mole dishes-- I still find their house chocolate to be the best of the bunch though! If not, I went on a date here and he really liked his tacos? Can't vouch cause I did not taste them, but I trust his judgment. The horchata is delicious and worth a try... But then again, so are the margaritas. :) service can be slow though... But food more than makes up for it!"], ["Adam A.", "Coming from a person who grew up on Mexican cuisine, I can honestly say that this place is just the bomb when it comes to serving traditional Mexican food.

I would recommend trying any of the margaritas and the 6 enchiladas in 6 different mole sauces entr\u00e9e."], ["Cla S.", "New Rebozo is tucked away on superior, off of Michigan. A great location. We were starving and it started rain-snow-hail-wtf-ing so we ducked in for a meal.As soon as we walked in I could tell this place was new. It had plainly suffered a failed makeover, the staff was over eager (not to mention heavily numbered given the size of the place and the number of patrons) and the 'new' in the title was the obvious indication, along with the smell of desperation cooking in the air.We were given the specials but they were ratted off quickly, so I didn't get all of it. We were then told our waiter would be Pedro but a lady named Reena attended to us all evening. Odd. Here's what we ordered and the verdict:Guacamole- This was well presented but a touch salty and onions should be cut way finer. Same goes for the table salsa, which was a bit watery as well. Tacos chetumal- a 3 steak tacos with bacon, onions, bell peppers, melted chihuahua cheese served with pancho villa sauce. The cheese choice was an issue for me and it came melted but in that one solid glob kind of way that ruined the combo.Tacos pancho villa- a 3 tacos combo again, steak or chicken with guac, onions, cilantro, and limes. This was even plainer than it sounds and the meat (beef) wasn't well seasoned so maybe try the chicken for better luck.Six moles- Almond, Hazelnut, Cinnamon (Canela), Sunflower, Pobano and Pumpkin. You can get cheese or meat and we tried both. I found the whole to be disgusting, but another diner did have a taste and liked the almond and sunflower. Overall fail though.Passion fruit mojito- While this tasted like passion fruit juice meets mojito, it was not worth the try or cost. But it didn't disappoint, it just didn't wow. Very well presented but needed more mojito and less juice.We tried the Flan Trio for dessert. This came in a vanilla, mint and chocolate variety. The traditional vanilla was our favorite. But this was the best part of the meal cause, while the flan wasn't very light/fluffy, at least it tasted right.BASICALLY this place is a peg over fast food, and maybe a peg under if you know good mex joints. The city has a lot to offer in this sense, esp. outside the loop.My advice (who-am-i-though) would be to fix the menu stat (spelling mistakes and confusing layout), re-train the staff (the inattentive waiters in contrast with intrusive water boys who refill glasses to the rim every 4mins), invest in more comfortable seating (heck, a re-makeover if budget allows) and knock the prices down by a considerable margin. I RECOMMEND- Going down the street to Joe's Steakhouse or Heaven on Seven.EXTRA TIP- I hoped Rebozo works out its kinks but since putting up this review I've been harassed by what seems to be staff and friends of the restaurant so I doubt they'll take any constructive measures to improve their food. Donning a better attitude (get off Yelp and get in the kitchen) will go a long way."], ["John W.", "This is the sixth star of yelp. Amazing. Chef Paco is a master of mole.

I love the sidewalk cafe and attentive staff. The chips, guac, salsa and margs were all excellent. The most popular dish is the Fiesta Mole, which features a sampling of different mole sauces. A few members of my family tried it and enjoyed trying all the different flavors. For vegetarians like me, there are plenty of options.

I didn't feel like they were organized or made customers their priority. It didn't seem genuine. I felt like my server was new and didn't have much knowledge of the food and at times felt awkward.

Will definitely be back!"], ["Tiffany W.", "Okay, so this is my very first Yelp review. I actually created an account just so I could review El Maya. I feel it is my sacred duty to recommend this place to as many people as possible. I am a HUGE fan of Mexican food. However, I have always been very disappointed in the lack of excellent Mexican restaurants in Chicago...other than Rick Bayless joints. I am so glad that the other Mexican place on the corner was closed on a Monday night because it allowed us to discover this wonderful gem. I finally have a go-to Mexican place in the city that doesn't cost an arm and a leg! The first time my boyfriend and I went here, I believe it was in August. We have been back probably twice a month since then. My favorite appetizer is the queso fundido...I dream about this stuff. It's soooooo delicious. It's a creamy, gooey mix of cheeses that is perfectly spiced and served with toasted bread. It's seriously amazing...easily the best I've ever had. Their salsa is also very good and slightly unique. The last time we were there, we tried the meatballs. They were also tasty!My entree of choice is the Piramide. It is so tasty! It's kind of Mexican lasagna of sorts with an excellent green sauce on one side of the plate and a very good mole sauce on the other. I have a hard time ordering anything else when I go because I know this dish will hit the spot. I have also tried their enchilada trio with a chicken, steak, and cheese enchilada. It was very good...maybe I'll have that the next time I go! My boyfriend generally gets their chicken molcajete or some other chicken dish that he always loves. The owner is awesome and lets my very picky boyfriend make a few substitutions. They are extremely accommodating. I'm usually too stuffed for dessert, but I did once have their Mexican chocolate dessert. It was very yummy. The icing on the cake is that it's BYOB, but they have the most excellent margarita mix to go with whatever tequila you bring in.Um, so obviously you can tell I love this place. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but I promise you won't be disappointed if you give it a try.

The host, who doubled as our waiter sat us immediately at the table we wanted. Through the meal he was very attentive, without crowding us and helpful when we got stuck being indecisive. Perfect service.We read that it was free BYOB and that they offer virgin margaritas if you bring tequila, so we stopped at the liquor store next door and picked up a small bottle of Patron. The waiter saw the bottle and asked us if we wanted to him to make us a pitcher. Considering half a small bottle was used and a virgin margarita pitcher is $11, that's only $22 for premium drinks for two to have for the whole meal.The priced are very reasonable for what you're getting. Altogether, it $70 for two meals with one appetizer and dessert to share. The food may not cost an arm and a leg but it sure tastes like it did.We had the queso fundido to start. I had the Envuelo and she had the Cochinito. To top it off, we split the chocolate tamale. Seriously, who would've thought that cornmeal and chocolate stuffed in a corn husk would be so good? An insane person, that's who. A mad genius! Everything is amazing. I'm not going to go into detail about it, because I'll run out of descriptors for how awesome the food tastes.I'm glad they take reservations because if they keep up with this level of service and quality, they're going to be packed every night."]], "Xoco": [["Joyce H.", "Some days when I'm daydreaming about sandwiches, I think back to the ones I've eaten at XOCO. I'm a huge fan of Rick Bayless, so this place has always had a special place in my mind/stomach. I was pretty excited to go back and eat here the last time I was in Chicago. I initially had a disappointing experience with the service but they totally redeemed themselves, keeping with the all around quality that I have come to expect with Bayless' restaurants! I had the ahogada, a pork sandwich in a spicy tomato chile broth. That broth is addicting. My friends got the vegetable caldo and a carnitas caldo. We also shared the apple empanada. All the food was great.Our last friend's meal never came out even after we had essentially finished our meal (didn't want that bread to get too soggy!) and when we initially approached the staff about it, they tried to reassure us that it was just a busy day. We had waited a while, so when I brought it up at the pick up area, I didn't say much but they picked up on my disappointment (and perhaps impatience). The manager ended up coming out with his favorite Mexican dessert - one for each of us, and deeply apologized for not bringing out our order correctly. It totally redeemed our experience, living up to their good name. So with that, 5 stars for the amazing food, and 5 stars for their desire to satisfy their customers."], ["Arshiya F.", "I'm a pesceterian who frequents xoco and usually get their mushroom torta, but decided to diversify and get their veggie caldado ( soup in a bowl) at the recommendation of the staff. I regretted my decision the minute the food arrived. The broth was incredibly salty and I wasn't a huge fan of warm sliced avocados in soup.If you are vegetarian, I would recommend the torta or salad. The caldado will not give you the best taste of how well xoco does simple food.Also- get the guac with toppings. It's delicious!"], ["Basil D.", "This is a marvelous little place for authentic Mexican food. \u00a0I like Rick Bayless, but I'm not a fan of Mexican food in general. \u00a0That said, this was an excellent experience all around. \u00a0The Cubano (I get the irony here) is the best torta I've had anywhere. \u00a0For some reason they know how to combine flavors perfectly. \u00a0The pork they use is excellently seasoned and the bread is perfect. \u00a0They balance the portions (which is so important in a sandwich) just right. \u00a0Their lemonade is a nice change since they don't offer the regular offerings of sodas. \u00a0Their guac and chips are great. \u00a0I love their salsa, which is pureed beautifully with lots of garlic. \u00a0It has a full, rich flavor. \u00a0They have a marvelous menu that I look forward to discovering in detail in the future, thankfully I live only a block away!"], ["Lin P.", "I usually hate eating alone, but I made an exception for Xoco and I'm so glad I did! I listened to my fellow Yelpers and went with an ahogada and pistachio glazed churro, topped off with a sangria on a Thursday afternoon after walking for hours at the Mag Mile. It was my first ahogada and I swear I will never eat another one unless it tastes exactly like the one I had here!!!!! The bread and the sauce are the stars of this dish. It was so good that I didn't need to use any hot sauce!Sigh. Counting down the days until I can visit Chicago again just to eat here...."], ["Steve A.", "I don't really understand the hype about this place. I realize that the desire is to try to take Mexican food and do something new and original with it. The problem here is that everything \"original\" is not an improvement on the original version. When you eschew \u00a0the traditional bread from a Mexican torta and replace it with a baguette-even a tasty one-it turns into something other than a torta. And when you make churros really skinny they get tough. And when you cover them with sauce they get tough and soggy.That said, most of the flavors I had were very good ones. And the habanero salsa that came with the sandwich had a wonderful flavor, although it was really too hot to eat, as I was warned.So if you want something different, you might try it, but if you want a tasty Mexican lunch, look for the little food counter at the back of most Mexican grocery stores. You'll get better stuff there."], ["Lena P.", "Loved their Chilaquiles and Huevos Rancheros! I wanted to go back the next day to have it again!Chilaquiles was too small! because I wanted more!

I'm not sure if churros in Europe or any other Spanish-speaking country are supposed to taste like this, but I'm not a fan. My husband and I had already had dinner, but wanted a late night snack. When I got my churro, I was disappointed in the size. For the price you pay, you get this little loop of a pastry the size of my hand. Costco has set the bar pretty high for how much you get for your money. I can say that it was very well fried. Crispy and not oily at all. Another one of my gripes was the seasoning? The churro was covered in some dusting that made it taste like a churro tortilla. It was basically if you take a tortilla and dip it into some sugar and cinnamon. It was more tortilla than churro. That's why I didn't like it very much. As for the chocolate espresso, very VERY strong. And I thought Vietnamese iced coffee gives you a jolt. Hopefully I get to come back and try the other food so I can give this place a better rating."], ["Lambert P.", "I've been to Xoco before years ago but only for coffee and the churros. \u00a0This trip to Chicago I wanted to actually sit down and eat there this time and have more than just dessert.My wife and I walked over to Xoco on a Friday knowing if we didn't get there on Friday or Saturday that they'd be closed Sunday and Monday. \u00a0This place is small, very small for the amount of people that want to eat there. \u00a0There is a line up leading up to the check out and while you're in line you're asked where you want to eat (inside, outside, take out). \u00a0Basically the person asking where you want to eat knows what seating is available and will marshal you to that area as it's not a self seating type of place. \u00a0You can also order a drink while in line so you can have a drink while you wait which you must pay for up front. \u00a0The seating marshal will then tell you what your table number is and you'll be assigned that seating so you don't have to scramble for a place to sit down. \u00a0This place is pretty noisy inside. \u00a0The only seating available was outside which has both stools and low chairs. \u00a0We had low chairs. By the time you get to the register you have to give them your table number and know what you'd like to order and pay there. \u00a0We went with a Cubana sandwich and my wife had a watermelon and goat cheese salad with a guacamole with bacon and queso fresco to start. \u00a0We also ordered churros and my wife wanted a coffee but not until we were done our mains.The guacamole was ok. \u00a0I can't say it was amazing. \u00a0The chips were good and they also came with a couple different salsas as well.My sandwich was good but not great. \u00a0The bread I'm used to being more crusty and toasted more than it was. \u00a0This is a standard for just about any Cuban sandwich I've ever had in Miami or just about anywhere that wants to make it as should be. \u00a0Their torta simply wasn't as good as I'm used to and generally speaking every place in Miami does it the way I was expecting it to be. \u00a0My wife's salad was a disappointment for her that or it simply wasn't what she was expecting. \u00a0She was expecting way more watermelon than she received (only about 5 small pieces) and there was barely any goat cheese in her salad. \u00a0I looked at it and it was rather sad looking. \u00a0It definitely wasn't worth 11 dollars.We ate all our guacamole and mains and we had asked to receive our dessert. \u00a0I had asked for a single chocolate and peanut churro and my wife had the trio of regular cinnamon and sugar with her chocolate cafe con leche. \u00a0The coffee I tried and it was really good. \u00a0Honestly I think Xoco's strong suit is the churros and coffee. \u00a0The food was in my opinion nothing really special.Rick Bayless or not I've had better torta in Miami at walk up places and for me the bread is the maker or breaker for sandwiches. \u00a0My wife's salad seemed \"skimped\" to say the least. \u00a0The churros and coffee however are as we remember them, great."], ["Angela C.", "Really great authentic Mexican, that is really well priced. Nice format: order at the counter, choose your seat (indoor or outdoor) and they bring the food to you. Our drinks were refilled often, as the staff was very attentive.

I love the concept - fresh Mexican (street eats) that lean towards the more casual tortas, guac, soups, etc, all made quickly and perfect for takeaway. All that being said, my buddy Corey and I still sat inside and enjoyed our lunch. First of all, the naked guac was pretty fabulous - incredibly fresh and flavorful and perfect with my fresh juice. However full you may be, start with some guac, my friends. When it comes to the menu, I've got to be honest, I wasn't totally bowled over by my main order - the ahogada. I should have read the description closer as the sandwich comes with a *very* spicy broth and not only am I not crazy about dipped sandwiches in general, but more so, my mouth was absolutely on fire. And I can handle heat. So there's that.Even though the sammie wasn't my fave, the grilled pork was flavorful and delicious, and everything I sampled was super solid.

Well, then I told her to order me the fish, pork and chicken taco's (comes in a pair). The fish taco's was very tasty and not too doughy with just the right touch of red cabbage lettuce.

Yeah. That's totally Antique Taco. Don't get me wrong - I wasn't expecting truly authentic Mexican food from a place marketed to hipsters, but the food here tasted like it was created by a stoned frat boy. ** Fish Tacos ** The fish itself was good and cooked nicely, however, it was completely and utterly DROWNING in a Sriracha-based tartar sauce. The sauce was NOT good - at least not at that volume - and tasted like it would be better suited for a sushi roll. I tried to scrape it off, but it had already soaked into the tortilla and breading. The parts of the fish that weren't completely doused in sauce (the ends of the tacos) were really good - it's a shame they ruined it by going overkill on the rest of the taco. ** Cheese Curds ** Then, there were the cheese curds, which I ordered because they seemed like a popular item based on Yelp reviews. However, when I bit into one, my mouth literally filled with oil... kinda like biting into one of those Gushers candies. I dumped the cup out (for some reason they were squished inside a small Styrofoam cup) and out came a sea of oil. I tried to salvage them by mopping up the excess oil with napkins, and finally gave up. The picture below was taken AFTER I had already used 5 napkins to clean up the grease.

Actually the only thing I really enjoy eating the most. It's really unique to combine chili with cheese curds and it was topped off with tortilla chips. Unique and tasty. Guac & Chips - Pretty good but I think for $7 is too overpriced. All the tacos consume had way too much going on. The meat was plentiful but the toppings attached, made the flavoring off and it wasn't satisfying. I had pick out a lot of the things out because it was way too much going on.

Pork taco was by far my favorite: would order these ones again (and probably only these ones.)- Cute lil baskets to transport your food. Sometimes you can judge appearances and Antique Taco does a good job.- Cheese curds live up to the hype. Yum. Lots of flavors, good textures.- Service was pretty quick and nice!- Drink menu was fun.Cons:- Fish taco was a let down. What can you expect, it's Chicago fish.- Beef taco was a little chewy. Good flavors, bad execution in my opinion.- Super long line/wait (food comes quickly once you order, but getting through the line is hard)- Each order of tacos is a set of 2, that are really filling. This makes it hard to try multiple flavors/spice up your life.- Guac is a little too expensive given the size."], ["Vee V.", "Have you ever encountered the table police? I have. Antique Taco hires them, not a pleasant experience. I'm sorry mom and dad, but I committed a crime today.I've been walking around downtown Chicago all day, and my boyfriend has been talking about these chili cheese curds he just had to try here. We walk in and I just sit down at a table I see nearby since there isn't a hostess stand. I'm tired. My boyfriend goes to put in our order.The place is trendy, community seating, which I hate. You wait in line, order, get a ugly ass number spool thing, then wait for your food. The place wasn't jam packed when we got there, nor did it get that way during our stay. There was a good amount of people, but plenty of open seats. I've been sitting for two minutes when an employee (I'm not using the term server here because I feel like servers are accommodating and friendly) stops in front of me and asks if I ordered yet. No smile, no hello, no hi, no how are you. Just \"have you ordered yet?\" I say no, but my boyfriend is right there in line. She says \"you can't sit here, it's first come, first serve.\" I kinda felt like saying I came here to the table first, but I was so shocked and a bit embarrassed, so I just got up. I get in line with my boyfriend and told him I was asked to leave the table. We get up to order pretty quickly, and to my great pleasure it's jerk face girl I just encountered taking our order. It wasn't like we waited long before I was allowed to sit again, but it's the principal. My boyfriend made sure to ask her after we ordered if it was okay for us to sit or would we need to wait for our food to be in our hands. She says oh sorry, you can sit now. This was the first \"apology\" I heard, it would have been nice to hear when she was kicking me out of the spot. \u00a0She then points over at a open section and tells us we can sit there. Although there were at least 4 other options around us. Plenty more on the other side of the place. I guess you can't select your seats even if it's community seating and the place isn't full, you sit your ass where they tell you to sit. We got the garlic shrimp tacos to share, and the chili cheese curds. The shrimp tacos came with fried kale and cauliflower. Humongous disappointment. Super bland. Corn tortilla was good, but it needed mounds of sauce. Some sort of pickled onion would have helped.The chili cheese curds were mediocre. I don't know if they make their own chili, but it was like dog food...well I don't know if my dogs would have eaten the chili either, so it was more like dog shit. The presentation on both were fantastic, but tasted like shit. It was a butter face. Body looks good, but the main attraction (taste in this case) was ugly as fuck. I have photos, but I will not be posting them. Perfect case of \"looks are deceiving.\" The napkins they give you are towels they wash and keep reusing. The towel was once white, with a blue stripe. I open my folded towel and it was ripped and stained. My boyfriend comments that it's probably safe and clean...okay. It might be washed, but at $9 a taco they can't replace cheap, ripped, and stained dinner napkins? Wtf. When we finished what we could I looked around a bit more and noticed a sign that said \"please order before sitting.\" Well excuuuuse me. It's not like there were people standing with trays of food with no table. I didn't inconvenience anyone, it wasn't busy. They just felt like enforcing a dumb policy. Policies shouldn't be hard and fast in a restaurant for fucks sake. I also noticed none of the workers were smiling. That's too bad to hate being at work so much, but then again I hate it here too.This place left me with an awful feeling. My god, when we finished eating, we still had beer. I was terrified. I kept watching to see if jerk face was coming back to tell us we needed to leave the table immediately. Imagine if you were on a long flight and the attendants were handing out tiny bags of pretzels. You're starving so you ask for another bag. They have a giant box full, but they tell you no. You only get one bag of pretzels. Wouldn't you think wow, they sacrificed service over a petty request just to stick to policy? That's how I felt. I'm sad about the whole experience. I'll never come back here. I'll never recommend this place to anyone. Food sucks, service is even worse. Top 3, maybe even #1, shitty restaurant experience of my life."], ["Yash S.", "Chicken Taco with Honey Yogurt, freshly sliced jalapenos and a smattering of divine goodness. I absolutely love their tacos - so well put together and delicious. The habanero hot sauce is amazing too - a little sweet with a lot of heat. I go back far too often, but don't really have any plans to stop soon. Other great menu item \u00a0- Kale Salad, Shrimp Tacos"], ["David C.", "Five stars for the food, but the poor/overall lack of service has forced me to downgrade my review a star. I heard this place is supposed to rival Big Star, so I had to see that for myself. We came on a weeknight and the place was PACKED. We waited what felt like an eternity in line (probably more like 20 minutes, but still). We ordered our food at the counter, then we were seated. Well, someone pointed where to sit; there wasn't really a server assigned to us--just food runners. We had been worried about seating, so I was appreciative there was an actual system in place. They brought the horchata milkshake, which I loved. The banana really adds something special to it in a cool take on horchata. It could have used even more of that cinnamon. Then, we got our fried cheese curds. Cue drooling like Homer Simpson. These were just that good and an absolute MUST order, in my opinion. They were covered in a spicy-ish sauce, scallions, and tons of beef at the bottom. Drool. Finally, we got our tacos. Mine came a little after my girlfriend's, which was a little annoying, but fine. My beef tacos were delicious and did indeed surpass Big Star's, although I have to admit I was never really a Big Star fan to begin with. We ended our meal with a homemade poptart, which is nothing like real poptarts. Trust me, that's a good thing. It was a delicious pastry and also a must-order! Really, the food was amazing and completely worth all the hype it has been getting the past year. However, the service was disappointing and confusing. No one really brought us anything and it took a while to track down someone to bring us the poptart (they don't bring it out automatically because there's ice cream and they don't want it to melt). If they're expecting people to tip, then there actually needs to be some service to speak of. What we did receive wasn't at all attentive. I shouldn't have had to go all the way to the front and awkwardly stand around waiting for someone to acknowledge me to request having the pop-tart; if they were really serving us, they would have noticed we were ready. All that aside, I'll be back and I'll still recommend Antique Taco, just with some caveats."], ["Gino W.", "Wondering what to have for lunch, I was in Wicker Park on the hunt for an Indian restaurant that turned out not to be open for business yet. Well, across the street was Antique Taco and it looked like there was plenty of seating.Guacamole and chips. Garlic shrimp tacos. Keema empanada. Strawberry ginger margaritas.Let me first say that the price for the entire meal came out higher than I expected. I should have paid more attention to the prices while I was being excessively hungry. But that was not a problem.I had recently been spoiled by having some chunky guacamole at a Mexican restaurant, so the creamy guacamole at Antique Taco was good to me, just not outstanding. The shrimp tacos were worth writing home about, and ordering again during future visits. The keema empanada reminded me of keema samosas that you get at Indian restaurants. The meat was in a sauce rather than simply flavoured. And the strawberry ginger margaritas were perfect for washing everything down.Antique Taco seems to be a hot spot, much like most restaurants in Wicker Park. Although I arrived shortly after the doors opened for business, about 30 minutes into my dining experience, the restaurant filled to capacity and there was a long line at the door. I get the allure. If you want to enjoy your meal inside, I suggest and highly recommend that you arrive at the opening of business."], ["Susie C.", "My husband and couple friends came here for dinner before we went to an event at Jackson Jungle which was across the street. We came a little bit after 530pm and there was already a good amount of people inside. It's a first come and first serve seating and you order up in the front. We were lucky to get a table of 4 since there was a group leaving couple minutes after we got there. It is pretty casual atmosphere, dimly lit. I had the mushroom tacos and part of the pork tacos. I really enjoyed the flavors of both of these tacos. My husband shared the pork along with the ribeye. He really enjoyed the taste but his stomach did not feel too good afterwards. He had to make couple trips to the bathroom. We think it could be the ribeye taco he had since none of us had that and we didn't have any issues. My \u00a0other two friends each ordered their tortilla soup. One thought it was a bit too spicy for her, and the other enjoyed it. They both said that the soup tickled their throat when they drink it..it's a weird feeling. They each had tacos, but I forgot what they ordered. They said it was tasty too. We shared chips and guacamole..and I really like the guacamole. We chat for a bit and once 630pm kicked in the line got really long...it went all the way \u00a0out the door. We felt obligated to leave so others can get a seat.

The tacos...Fish tacos: I think this was the group's favorite out of all the tacos. The filet is huge, and the batter makes it nice and crispy on the outside, and hot tender and flakey on the inside.Shrimp tacos: This was probably my second fav, since there was so much flavor.Carnitas tacos: It was a little on the sweet side, but you can't really go wrong with carnitas.Ribeye tacos: I was a little disappointed in the ribeye tacos.

When we got there, there was a line so we figured it was just really busy. Then someone came by asking if we wanted anything to drink so we ordered our agua fresca with vodka and was told they have a big party upstairs in their venue so aren't taking any food orders until they get caught up. Why wouldn't they plan that better so customers coming in at the restaurant don't have to wait 15 minutes in a line that wasn't moving at all? Then the next annoying thing was they were letting people that were getting food to go, to go in front. I understand their point but I think the fact that people are walking in and going in front of everyone that has been there for over 20 minutes in line is pretty silly. And then when we finally did order, it was just weird and slightly rude.Anyway, the food!

A woman and her chef husband come together to bring us antiques and Mexican food. So while you eat, your eyes can enjoy all of the lovely antique pieces they've collected through out the years. I'm a sucker for antiques and this place is full of them. I pretty much want to own all the pieces in there. Antiques give off such a homey feel and you find yourself wondering where the piece might have been before you came across it. I love that, the history behind every piece. Good to know that some of their items will be going up for sale soon. To the food! Chili Cheese Curds served with a chorizo chili and topped with some crema, fantastic. We also ordered Pork Carnitas Tacos and Crispy Fish Tacos. Both were delicious but I have to say I enjoyed the Fish tacos more. I'm kind of upset that I didn't try more food, with that being said, there's no doubt I'll be back to try more of their tasty menu items.

The line stretched all the way to the front door, but, with 2 registers, moved quickly. \u00a0I opted for their seasonal margarita (an ancho orange carrot maragarita) and their mushroom tacos, while my friend got a margarita of her own and the prime rib tacos. \u00a0The margaritas were light and refreshing! Served in mason jars dusted with salt and ancho chili on the rims, they were the perfect drink for a summer evening in July. \u00a0The tacos were spot on too! For the mushroom tacos, they were juicy and had lots of flavor, complimented by pickled veggies and a cilantro cream. They come 2 per order and were more than filling. \u00a0Street tacos like this are my absolute favorite and Antique Taco definitely delivered in terms of providing fresh ingredients with a ton of flavor.So, to sum it up, my Antique Taco experience was what I would thought it would be and more.

While all of them were very good, I would highly highly recommend the garlic shrimp and perhaps the mushroom. The garlic shrimp came with basil based sauce that complemented the stronger flavors of the garlic, and out of the four I tried, it was the clear standout. The service was fantastic--the waitress and cashier were both extremely friendly, the food came quickly despite the large crowd, and I enjoyed the attention to detail that was put into the shop--cloth napkins, glass jars for water, for instance. Great place for solid food in a more casual setting."], ["Maria R.", "3.5 stars bc it is kinda pricey and some food not so great.Their horchata shake tho...mmm. You should go just for that. Their other (alcoholic)drinks are yummy too i guess.The space is awesome and they have some mexican staples you dont find often (or at least not in Wicker park. you need to go to like a supermercado somewhere) like Mazapan candy. Food can be hit or miss. stick to the less weird food items. the good ones are really good."], ["Dan B.", "This place is amazing for modern tacos. We've had the shrimp, mushroom and fish tacos. With mushrooms like this, who needs red meat? The shrimp taco has cauliflower elote topped with crispy kale and the fish is lightly battered tempura style that was crunchy and the fish was moist and perfectly cooked. My wife and I have been a few times and look forward to going back to try the other options. The guac is amazing as are the salsa's in a laid back atmosphere decorated with antiques. I do suggest to get their early before the rush if you don't like lines although it's well worth the wait."], ["Justine M.", "I enjoyed my experience here and didn't have any issues. We were asked a few times to clear our items to make room for people, which is understandable. Their process is a bit confusing to me. You go up to the counter to order, then sit anywhere. Once you're seated, you can order more food at the table, no need to go back in line at the counter. I assume this would make for an extremely crowded situation where individuals are fighting for seats. Hm, whatever! Whatever works for them.We got a few items - Guac, Cheese curds, Shrimp tacos, ribs, fish tacos.Gauc - good. A bit small for my likingCheese curds - yum! Chili is overpowering but other than that, they are great.

Goo flavor and enough shrimpfish tacos - mediocre, surprisingly. A bit too much fried batter for meRibs - good, nothing noteworthyOverall good experience and cute decor. Come at an off time.

Still hoping to try a few more, but I'm thinking nowhere else can match the quality or quantity (for the price) at Antique. The line was to the door when we walked in at 9 on a Friday night, which we took as a good sign. This is a casual spot--you order and pay at the counter, find a seat, and then you're served from there and someone will come around every so often to check if you need more food or drinks. The margaritas seemed priced a little steep and they had some Half Acre cans so we stuck with beer and started with chips and guacamole. I've never met a bad guacamole (knock on wood) and there was nothing super special about this one but it was solid. We were surprised when our food came out only a few short minutes after. We had:The antique taco salad, with pork: huge salad. Must have weighed a pound. Filled with deliciousness. They did not skimp on anything--fruits, veggies, MEAT. This is a kale salad so know that before you order if you're averse to kale. I am not so I loved it.Pork and steak tacos: they are 2 per order and they are big; not those wimpy little miniature tacos with a teaspoon full of meat. They range from $7 to $8 per order of two but you get your money's worth. I can't wait to come back here. Will probably try Kokopelli just next door and see how they stack up. At some point I will need to try one of those margaritas too."], ["Darren B.", "This place has a great, open, clean and antique vibe to it and their tacos are no joke. I came here recently after my brother suggested I try Big Star. It was a review I read about Big Star that led me to Antique Taco and another that solidified it for me. It turned out my brother had been to Antique taco too, but it had been so long, he forgot how great they are. When \u00a0posed with the dilemma of choosing between both Wicker Park options, I thought of the only option possible...BOTH!We started at Antique Taco and I knew ahead of time I really wanted to try their Crispy Fish taco which includes: Tempura, Sriracha Tartar Sauce, Smoked Cabbage, Scallions, and Sesame Seeds. Not only did this taco include a great sized fish filet, but all the flavors combined perfectly together. The smoked cabbage was unique and tasted great and the Sriracha Tartar sauce tied everything together. The fish was cooked perfectly and the batter was tasty and crisped to the right degree.The second taco we went for was their special which was the Lamb taco. I am so glad, my brother suggested we try this one because it was equally as delicious. In addition to the succulent, tender and juicy lamb, they also add cumin, roasted jalapeno & garlic, sweet potato crisp, mint yogurt and cilantro. The mint yogurt was incredible and married with the lamp so very well.The tortillas were awesome too and very likely made in house. While eating both tacos, my brother and I each had a few of those I can't talk right now, I'm in taco heaven moments which only happens when you have tacos worthy of transporting you to taco heaven.One thing I love about these tacos is that they are legit gourmet tacos (and without the gourmet price). There is an artistry to their design and execution and only the best ingredients are utilized. Tacos are so easy to put together and there are near limitless options one can include. But there are definitely varying degrees in excellence when making a taco. Between Big Star and Antique Taco, there is a stark difference in quality and passion that goes into each taco. Nothing against Big Star, I will go there again and grab a beer, but I will eat my tacos here first.On our way out, I recognized the owners from the website and got the chance to chat with them briefly. They were super nice and their \"CEO\" is adorable.After future visits, this could easily increase to 5 stars. The only downside to coming here before Big Star was that I wished I had reserved the stomach space used on Big Star for some more Antique Tacos!!"], ["Maliha S.", "We showed up Tuesday night, an hour before closing. The place was full without being crowded. Because it was my first time trying this place I asked for recommendations and the staff was very helpful and nice. They recommended the fish tacos, which I liked because the fish was deep fried :) The shrimp tacos were just okay- I personally think they should be served warm. It was also a little weird to have corn in my shrimp tacos. My date got the horchata drink, which was delicious. I got an agua Fresca drink, which I thought kind of tasted like watered down lemonade. The chips and salsa were 5/5. The ambiance reflected the hipster neighborhood. Lots of young millenials who are obviously regulars. I would go back for the fish tacos. Also, we didn't realize the place closed at 10 and the staff was nice enough to not kick us out."], ["Steve W.", "I expected this place to be better based off the reviews.

The chili cheese curds are phenomenal and downright sinful. The carnitas tacos are out of this world, and the sweet and spicy chicken tacos are good as well. While I'm not a seafood fan, my friends rave about the crispy fish tacos.There are a lot of great taco places in the Wicker Park neighborhood -- but Antique Taco, undoubtedly, has the best food.A couple small improvements:- I'd love to be able to order one taco at a time so that you can mix and match rather than having to stick to two tacos of the same variety.- Service here can be quite slow. Aren't tacos usually pretty speedy to put together?- Waiting for to-go orders can be awkward. The restaurant is usually pretty crowded.

That seems to be a little bit of the case here although I will admit they were pretty delicious. The place is a bit small and can be confusing. You walk in and order at the counter then you sit down with some weird spool looking thing and they bring you your food. You go and get your own napkins, water and silverware which we had no idea about until we asked.And it's a first come first served table situation. You best hope a table comes available once your food is ready. We saw a few people with kids wandering around looking for somewhere to park themselves and their stroller. Not a good place to bring kids in my opinion. I had goat tacos with red curry sauce, my friend had the crispy fish and we shared some carnitas and a guac. Food was no doubt solid but a bit pricey. For tacos, 2 beers and some guac we were at $60+. Yikes...Overall a solid choice as the quality is there but if you're thinking a cheap night out cuz we're just going for tacos, think again..."], ["Carolyn T.", "Ive been dreaming about the delicious meal we enjoyed at Antique Taco yesterday. Everyone in the reviews seem to be comparing it to Big Star, so I'm going to hop onto that wagon and declare that I absolutely prefer this place to Big Star in terms of the food quality/taste. My taste buds were in heaven after eating here! (+):Fish tacos were great. It was a significant portion of fish and it was fried to crispy perfection without having too much fried/breaded gunk. There was plenty of white fish to enjoy, piping hot. Even though $4 per taco may be a bit much, the taste made it worth it. Fried chili cheese curds were pretty amazing. There was a LOT of fried cheese curd to go around. You could easily share this app with three people and everyone still gets a decent amount. I will say that it isn't very spicy (even with the jalape\u00f1os on top) and this is coming from someone not very tolerant to spice. There's also meat in the sauce, so vegetarians beware (I easily ate around it as a pescetarian). The homemade pop-tart was incredible. It was basically like a huge stuffed cinnamon-sugar empanada with tons of delicious, decadent chocolate inside complete with a marshmallow, too. We enjoyed eating this with the ice cream it came with, vanilla with cinnamon on top. They seat you based on how many are in your party. I appreciated that they did this because we were concerned about being able to find a table because it was so busy. Meh:The Horchata milkshake *was* pretty good, but it tasted overwhelmingly like banana rather than the sweet cinnamon milk flavor I love about Horchata. Honestly, the oatmeal shake from Irazu in Logan tastes more like Horchata. I think I would appreciate the shake more if they called it cinnamon banana instead of Horchata. (-):The wait was very long. Perhaps we were naive to think the wait would be reasonable at 8 PM on a Tuesday night. We waited for ~20 minutes in line before ordering! The only way I can think of rectifying this brings me to my next point. The service was very lacking. We were really unsure of the setup initially, so we didn't leave a tip at first. We had to order at a counter, then someone would just bring us the food. That's just like a Noodles 'n' Co and clearly more of a fast food that also has seating type of place. Before we were directed in where to sit, we were informed that we should let the staff know when we were ready for the pop-tart because the ice cream could melt. The food took a very long time to appear and my boyfriend's tacos came out a full five minutes later than mine. The timing was generally really off for every part of our meal. Halfway through, we finally were able to flag someone down for waters (which we noticed had been brought to other tables). We had three different people bring us food, so they were more like food runners than servers. We later spent 10 minutes trying to find someone to tell we were ready for the pop-tart. This place gets really, really loud. It was difficult to enjoy the food when we couldn't even communicate with each other about how amazing it was. Overall, even if the general customer service/organization aspect of Antique Taco left a lot to be desired, I LOVED the food, which contributed to my four-star rating. There are definitely kinks this place needs to work out. They need more staff and they also need to decide if they're fast food or a sit-down restaurant. It feels like this place has been open only a few months even though it's been open much longer than that. All that being said, I will definitely be back for the food!"], ["Natalie C.", "Came here on Cinco de Mayo and it was bumpin' (although not a crazy long wait like Big Star had, despite the rather chilly weather). You wait in line and order at the front counter (food and beverages), then take a seat and they bring your food to you. \u00a0If you want to order any additional food/drinks, they will take your order at the table. \u00a0Kinda a weird merged process, but I guess it works for them.I ordered the pork carnitas tacos, my two friends order the shrimp tacos, and one of them ordered a side of spicy pickled veggies. My tacos were really tasty - topped with bacon and avocado (I could eat bacon and avocado on pretty much anything) however it is kind of pricey for the two small tacos you get. \u00a0Although it's Wicker, so that's pretty par for the course. \u00a0Antique Taco is very tasty, however definitely not what I would call 'authentic' - but their flavor combinations are interesting and the ingredients fresh."], ["Julie O.", "We walked over after Renegade Craft Fair. Not a big line and a few seats, so score for all that. There were printed menus on the counter, but we did not see those 'til we got to the counter. Anyhow, we were prepped to order off the board on the wall and the beers on the shelf. The paper towel holder receipt number was weird but they got our food to us and it did not take long at all. Maybe 10 minutes. The ribeye tacos were wonderful. I was more than full from two. My partner's pork tacos were pretty good, just not as good as my ribeye tacos. We got the chili cheese curds to share. Fun. Margarita was not sweet. Lots of canned beer options, including Modelo,Tecate and a couple locals."], ["Dutch B.", "great really great.. only down side is the wine is awful, but that's Chicago for you..... but the food rocks the house folks.. fish, mush, pot tacos are AMAZING..!"], ["Emma G.", "I have been on a duck binge and the duck tacos did not disappoint. They weren't dry or over sauced just loaded with meat and a delicious slaw. The horchata milkshake wasn't bad but it tasted more like a smoothie with a strong banana taste to it. Level of sweetness was good and not over the top with a creamy good consistency.My boyfriend had the fish tacos and after getting sick at Big Star each time we found a winner here. HE loved them and fish tacos were redeemed for him by Antique Taco. Servers were great and helped recommend the top favorites since it was our first visit. Great atsmosphere and kind staff. They noticed we didn't have all the hot sauces and brought them from other tables so we could enjoy all the restaurant had to offer on our first visit. Also we had the guacamole and chips which was the perfect size to share and had other food without filling up. Overall great place and look forward to trying more of the menu next time."], ["Aimee M.", "Thoroughly enjoyed our late lunch at Antique Taco. \u00a0Loved the open feel of the place, the distressed wood tables, old farmhouse kitchen and seating. Touches like this along with good food made for a wonderful experience. Chili fried cheese curds, fish tacos, a cheese quesadilla for the kid. \u00a0This sounds pretty basic but the flavors were nothing but basic and the presentation was gorgeous. The chili cheese curds, base is chorizo chili, topped with perfectly fried cheese curds and presented with chopped scallions and crema--it was gorgeous and every bite was delicious. The crispy fish tacos is tempura battered, topped with smoked smoked red cabbage and sriracha tartar sauce. \u00a0I love cabbage slaw on my fish tacos and this rendition of it was delicious. \u00a0You get two tacos in the order and the servings were so big I ended up packaging half the cheese curds and one taco to bring home. The horchata milkshake is heaven--they add a little banana to the usual rice milk/cinnamon flavor profile and it just brings it to a super tasty level. No wonder my kid inhaled it. The quesadilla is pretty much two servings too, comes with a small side of chips and slices of avocado--a really nice touch! The only negative--Eh, Servers/counter folks didn't seem happy to be there."], ["Michael H.", "4.5 Star Joint/ reminds me of being in Austin.. You order at the counter and can sit either inside (No AC) or outside. The tacos come in about ten different varieties and are two to an order. They also have guac and some other like appetizer items. I tried the Al Pastor & Grilled Ribeye tacos.. they were phenomenal! Homemade corn tortillas and very high quality ingredients made for some very unique flavors. Not sure what kind of salsa they have on the tables but it's orange and tastes amazing on the steak tacos! Had to have been like a habanero salsa because of the color & KICK! Always busy and there's def a reason why.. get dat did!"], ["Angie K.", "My third time at antique and I'm trying to stay summertime fine. I got the antique salad aka big-ass kale salad and shared corn off the cob with hubby. He had sweet and spicy chicken tacos. All I can say is dayum! Not only has antique won me with amazing fish tacos and Abuelita's pop tart, now I can even go when I do my crazy diet thing! Woo hoo! Something for every crazy side of me. Kale is crisp and not drenched in oils so you know you're still gonna be skinny after this. Corn salad is best corn dish I've ever had. Perfectly light for summer and not too heavy in creamy stuff. He said spicy chicken tacos had an Indian flavor which made them memorable.Thanks to antique, the fatty and skinny sides of my taste buds can be satisfied and I'll still fit in my skinny jeans.

Missing the atmosphere big time. Crispy Fish Tempura Sriracha Tartar Sauce, Smoked Cabbage, Chives, Sesame. I've eaten a lot of fish tempura. I can tell you this has to be the airy, lightest, crispiest tempura batter ever!!! Each ingriedient harmonized like a choir in my mouth!! Keep Calm & eat antique taco. You won't be dissapointed.

I love the interior decorating of Antique Taco. I am a sucker for places with nice wooden tables. There is also outside seating for sunny days. I ordered the ribeye taco. They give you a spindle thing instead of a number to bring to your table. That was pretty interesting. In addition, you get your own water and utensils at Antique Taco. My tacos came pretty quickly. The potatoes and pineapples went well with the ribeye. The ribeye by itself was alright, but when you eat everything together, the taste was perfect.One order comes with two tacos. It was just enough to make me feel full which was good. Definitely will be back! Love the food and I will try different flavors of the tacos next time."], ["Kristin H.", "Margarita failed, tasting like nothing but sour mix. \u00a0Food came sporadically and untimely. \u00a0Nondisclosure of ingredients caused folks to not be able to eat their meals. \u00a0Standing in hot space and slow line is a dumb system. \u00a0Curry chicken should not be paired with strawberries.

The guac was average-- next time I'll definitely forego it for the chili cheese curds instead. The chicken tacos were delicious - the jalapenos really gave it a kick. The fish tacos were my personal favorite!! They have 2 sauces -- one hot sauce and another smoked mayo kind of sauce...both are delicious! I highly recommend dousing whatever you get in those sauces.

I saw the great yelp reviews at this place and decided to try it out for Sunday lunch. The only thing I knew about this place was that they did pork right, and that was enough for me to head out to Pilsen.When you walk in, the place will look CROWDED. But there seemed to be 2 lines, 1 for dine-in and one for take out. So if you're scared by the wait if you're dining in, it might not be that bad. I was with a party of 3 and I had to wait around 20-25 minutes, so yeah you'll have to wait a bit. But they were nice enough to give us free cheese and potato tacos while we waited in line. The restaurant is small and pretty cozy, but the line moved relatively fast. Once you get seated, service is lightning fast where you get your corn tortillas, salsas, and food within 5 minutes. And even though it's fast service, the wait staff were still sweethearts.The food really took this place to the next level. It's a small menu, but everything we got was SO GOOD. We got 1 pound of mixed carnitas meat, cactus salad, 3 pork brain tacos, and free chicharons with yelp checkin. The carnitas was really good with the corn tortillas (which are free and unlimited btw!) and cactus salad. Juicy and tender. The cactus salad was tasty and had a great bite. The pork brain tacos were nice and spicy. The chicharons were not too hard and flavorful.But really the most amazing thing was the price of the food. Meal for 3 for $18 with great food and service. There is a bit of a wait, but this is really as good as it gets."], ["Pete C.", "Got a great lunch deal for about $7. It came with carnitas and chicharron to make your own tacos and a drink. There was enough food for both my wife and I. The service was good and the food came fast. The salsas were tasty too. Can't beat that deal if you are around there. The chicharron was nice and crispy and the carnitas were juicy and flavorful.

Read it now.I was turned on to Carnitas Uruapan by Food Network's Aaron Sanchez, who you may know from Chopped. My historically favorite Food Network show is the lesser known Heatseekers, where Aaron and Roger Mooking go around stuffing the hottest possible things in between their lips. Right now, Chef Aaron is seen hawking tacos on Taco Trip. The show's debut city was Chicago, and Sanchez did indeed visit Carnitas Uruapan.I don't have much more to add to Anthony's review other than noting that everything he writes makes these carnitas sound extra delicious. In addition, Carnitas Uruapan offers a \"value meal,\" which is a half-pound of carnitas (you can pick the cuts or ask for a sample medley), a side of chicharron, and a bottled drink (go Jarritos), all for an astoundingly low $5.99. The half-pound comes out to 4 tacos, which is more than enough for one person.You can also order by the pound or by taco. The former is a great option for group dinners and easily taken to go. The to go option also holds some appeal, as the gentleman slicing your meat up front gives you a handful of tastiness as a sample.Of note, Carnitas Uruapan is a bit of a hike on the far west end of the Pilsen, but has quickly becomes one of my favorites in the area. It's also just off the Pink Line, making it one of the easier places to get to via public transit."], ["Robert S.", "Great carnitas. \u00a0 Moist. \u00a0 Tasty. \u00a0 You can buy them from half a pound on up. .., \u00a0 Only $8.50 for a whole pound. \u00a0 \u00a0If you eat there they give you warm tortillas, warm chicharrones.

I had had very little to eat that day, and I needed a change of place. Nitecap is friendly, but cool. Carnitas Uruapan is friendly like all-out, down-home family friendly.

I that the last place I had had them (other than from a nasty plastic bag, probably from 7-11 or some truck stop) was Publican, and it felt too much like I was paying too much homage to the hipsters to remember them. Here they were crisp, non-greasy affordable-to-everyone food.The pork was beyond delicious: moist, with browned bits. I did my duty to both the United States of America and the United Mexican States and wrapped the goodness into the plentiful, hot fresh tortillas (they asked me at least twice if I had enough), spooned on some salsa and sighed with appreciation.But a half pound of meat with all the rest for $8.50?

I noticed on Facebook that they post a weekly secret word on Wednesdays. All you need to do is mention the word and you get 2 tacos for the price of 1. I then went to there website where I learned that they only serve carnitas. I thought to myself if they make one kind of taco, then it must be amazing. Time to read reviews on Yelp and with a 4.5 star rating I knew it was time to bookmark and visit this gem. As soon as I walked in, the waitress approached me speaking Spanish and I attempted to use the secret word...\"La Serena\". I think my high school Spanish paid off because she smiled and spoke to the owner who was walking out the door. The owner Marco was nice enough to stop and talk to me. I love meeting owners because you can see there passion for there business. I pointed out to Marco how socially savvy his business was and informed him that is how I got to his front door. It is good for them to know that the social posts work on creating awareness and getting new customers. Marco then informed me that I could also get a free order of Chicharr\u00f3n, if I checked in on FourSquare or Yelp. I showed him my app already checked in and said, \"I know and thank you!\" I love check-in gifts. I asked Marco to help me order. What I learned is that you must know your pork when eating here. There is a chart on there menu, at the tables and I posted it as a tip. You can pick where you want your carnitas meat to come from for your taco. At first I thought that is so cool and then I panicked. I wasn't a butcher! What do I choose? Where do I start? I thought all pig was created equal?Marco was a huge help and he ordered 4 tacos for me in Spanish. He suggested for my first time I get Pork Shoulder and Pork Rib. So I decided to get two of each. While I was talking to Marco his cook, who was slicing the carnitas to make my 4 tacos, offered me a sample of the meat. I thought that was really nice. I had already ordered but he wanted me to have a sample still. I think he was proud of his pig. The process of roasting the pig is two hours until it transforms into succulent pieces of pork. Marco suggested I get the shoulder and rib because those were the safest choices for my first visit and because they are mostly meat. He said as I get more adventurous I can start adding more fatty pieces of the pork like belly. So you really need to know your pig. Don't look at this and be afraid. Look at this as a culinary challenge to make the most delicious carnitas ever. I was carrying out my food and got my 4 carnitas and a bag of fresh Chicharr\u00f3n all for $5 and some change. Thanks to the secret word and checking in. Social Media Rocks! The bag was very heavy. They do not mess around here with there meat. When I got home my wife remarked at how delicious the smell was. I had to prep her on the know your pork, before we dived in. I explained which tacos were which, before our eating adventure began. I must say we enjoyed them. We loved the pork rib carnitas because they were the juiciest. You must be careful with this one because the bones and cartilage are still on there. I quickly pulled the bones out and saved them for my home made stock. Score! The carnitas came with a nice big container of green salsa that was very delicious. I wish I could make the salsa they make here. It worked so well with the carnitas. Yes I'm having salsa envy. There was so much food we couldn't finish it all. I think one taco might be enough for one person, in fact I was stuffed. I was just happy that I had a meal of carnitas waiting for me the next day. \u00a0These leftovers are worth it. You definitely get your monies worth when eating here. I also enjoyed my Chicharr\u00f3n. This was the first time I ever had real Chicharr\u00f3n and not out of a processed bag. It was yummy and I've been nibbling on it all week. For those of you who have never had it, it is deep fried pig skin and it is so delicious. I'm sure it's not healthy because something that tastes that good can't be healthy. Thanks to Marco and his friendly staff for making me feel welcome on my first visit. I can not wait to return. The menu also expands on the weekend (Sat & Sun) with more available dishes. I'm now thinking that those items must be really special and I'm sure this place is packed on the weekends. This is also a family business. Marco's Dad started this place in 1975 and 39 years later they are still pumping out quality food. Congrats to Marco for keeping the family tradition alive and to another 40 years of carnitas love in Chicago. So know your Pork, pick your meat & get ready for the best carnitas that Chicago has to offer. Enjoy because I know I did."], ["Rachel P.", "Small spot with great pork, which is good since that's all they serve. Skin, shoulder, belly, and rib, sold by the 1/2 lb. There are a few tables for sit-down service, and a very popular take-out counter. I've seen the line double back on itself on a weekend!

And good Lord, it is amazingly delicious.I came on a Saturday morning and was greeted by a young girl at the counter who told me to sit anywhere. It's a very cozy interior, meaning it fills up fast when people get hungry for good authentic Mexican pork and coolers with Jarritos in the back.I decided on three tacos, one from the shoulder, one from the belly, and one from the loin. They were all delicious and juicy, with the pork loin taco being particularly tasty, with the skin of the pig still on the meat. I also got a free order of chicharrones, or fried pork skin, with a check in. It's not healthy for you at all, but it's a very tasty snack. I recommend coming early for breakfast on the weekend, as they also feature crispy tacos with potato, which I am a fan of after the girl offered me one for free when I asked what they were. So tasty.Mucho gusto!"], ["Jesus G.", "Was there this past weekend and omg.. I was not disappointed!! The carnitas are seriously the best I've ever had in Chicago. The chicharron was also amazing, very soft and crunchy. While I was waiting in line I got a 'taco dorado' for free and a piece of carnitas to try. The staff were very attentive and one of the guys that works there noticed that I was checking in on Yelp and offered the \"free side of chicharron\". I didnt experience the crazy crowd but I was there around 1pm which might have been the reason for that. I enjoyed the carnitas so much that we are getting them catered for my mom's bday next weekend! Kind of pricey ($7.99/lb) \u00a0but they are worth every penny!"], ["John C.", "Carnitas', its the best ...nothing else to say.i can't wait to order a couple of pounds with family and pig out...you must try this place..careful it's addictive"], ["Delightful D.", "Omg I been to a couple carnitas locations in pilsen but this one is best.

Recommend getting just the meat portion when ordering carnitas (I'm not too crazy about the skin). We also got the spicy cactus salad, beans, menudo, and the FREE chicharon (yelp special). I guess they were pretty much done with selling the menudo, as the waitress told me she had to warm up a bowl for me (I got there late afternoon). It was a little lukewarm but ok. I can only imagine how amazing it usually is when it comes out piping hot early in the morning. They ran out of the crispy tacos when we got there, so that'll be something to look forward to. All this food, with 3 sodas, came out to less than $30!!! Came out satisfied, with a doggie bag of tomorrow's lunch!"], ["Yami L.", "I am so sorry to be the bear of bad news. In my opinion the place had a lot of issues. 1) We walk in and the waitress's stare at us like deer in the headlights.2) Once we walked towards the tables we were told to sit wherever. 3) Once we sat all the salsas were rushed to our table and we were bombarded with questions of what we wanted to order. 4) after we order the plates were almost being thrown on the table almost being stacked if we didn't catch them.5) At one point they shoved a plate in my face because I was looking away from the waitress In my opinion they could of had side orders to add to the meals for example guacamole, cheese, sour cream ect. It was just a disappointing experience and the food was flavorless and cold. The owner was attentive and the salsas were good in flavor, these two reasons are why this place gets 1 star."], ["Antonio r.", "This spot is a gem. I met the owner and have been meaning to come here a while ago.Finally made it and I have to say the meat is so well prepared. So good and tender.

We asked them to bring the temperature up a bit, so they whisked it away just as the carne asada arrived. About that carne asada....HOLY HELL was it spicy! Between the heat and how chewy the flank steak was, I could barely choke it down. Again, we hailed our server to let him know and he promptly took it away and replaced it with the oaxacan-style carne asada which was a super tender rib-eye packed with flavor. The hot bass finally reappeared and it ended up being delightful, yet understated. We particularly enjoyed the mashed potatoes and maiitake mushrooms on the plate. They comped us another round of margaritas, and we finished off the night with a flan duo. The service was top notch, but the food was just ok, given all the hype. If I'm paying $25+ for an entree, it should nearly blow my socks off...."], ["Barnali D.", "Came here for a weekday lunch and was impressed! \u00a0Great food, good service, and central location.I loved my goat enchiladas - they were super flavorful! \u00a0My dining companion really liked her tortilla soup and \"street food\" dish.The service was prompt \u00a0and friendly, which was great given how bustling the place was on a Tuesday afternoon.I was staying at the Aloft Chicago City Center, and this place was just a block away.Perfect place for lunch!"], ["Jake V.", "This place didn't quite live up to the hype for me. We tried a few different sampler plates, and everything was good, but nothing was amazing, and for the price I wanted amazing. The drinks were fantastic though."], ["Austin Y.", "One of my favorite restaurants and quite possibly my favorite restaurant in Chicago, I have yet to experience a restaurant like Frontera anywhere else in the country. Over the course of a few visits, standouts have been:Tortilla soup ($8.50): remains one of my favorite soups ever, the broth is fantastic and the tortilla strips, crema, avocado and chicken come together perfectly.Mole poblano enchiladas ($12): one of my favorites, I love Frontera's mole poblano and these enchiladas are the perfect pairing to really let the dark, roasty, slightly sweet mole come through.Striped bass in almond mole ($25): absolutely loved this dish, the portion was generous and the almond mole was smooth, nutty, and slightly sweet, perfect for the tender striped bass. Squash that came on the side was outstanding.Duck in date mole ($25): Duck breast came in long tranches and was perfectly cooked. Date mole was complex with roasty flavors of date and nutmeg, very slightly sweet.Mole trio ($23): another standby, I am a huge fan of mole and especially loved the mole poblano enchiladas and root veggies in green mole. Pork in yellow mole was also tasty, but less interesting than the other two.Holiday empanada ($8): warm, flaky empanada filled with some sort of warm cranberry compote. I was blown away by the phenomenal homemade chestnut ice cream that came with it.Duo of flan ($8): traditional vanilla and coconut. Both flans were the perfect consistency, the coconut was especially delicious and the crumbled (lemon?) cookies added flavor and texture.EDIT: Frontera is now tied with Longman & Eagle for my favorite brunch in Chicago.Bajio-style eggs ($13): A creative, delicious take on eggs benedict. Instead of the standard english muffin or biscuit, these poached eggs rest on two incredible masa cakes that are slightly crispy and mealy. The chorizo on top is extremely flavorful, and the jalapeno cream sauce is absolutely perfect with this dish. One of the best, most memorable brunch dishes I've had in a while.Enchiladas in mole ($15): Make sure you ask for a side of extra mole poblano! These chicken enchiladas are always great with Frontera's signature mole, which is dark, roasty, slightly chocolatey and sweet. Even the black beans on the side are noticeably delicious, especially when topped with a little extra mole. I really appreciate this dish during brunch.Gorditas ($13) was also excellent, the black bean sauce is addictive. Their guacamoles are good, but I'd really rather pay a few extra bucks for an extra entree.Whatever tamales Frontera has on offer are pretty much excellent across the board. I also remember trying the queso fundido with duck, the street food trio, and guacamole which were all well prepared, just not as memorable. Never tried any of the taco options. Reservations are still hard to come by here, and for good reason, I'd gladly go for brunch, lunch or dinner any day."], ["Jess P.", "Excellent Mexican with a seasonal menu, closed Sundays and Mondays.I'm a fan of the other gring@ with extensive knowledge of Mexican cuisine-- Diana Kennedy-- so it took me a minute to get into the wiry Rick Bayless. But I enjoy his books, lots of people think he's more accessible, and I tried and enjoyed his food at an airport before. On this trip, I intended to check out Xoco based on reviews here, but it was closed, so I wandered into Frontera Grill. The hostess explained that the bar seats are first come, first serve, so I sat at the counter, facing the wall (poor choice on my part, but solo dining is sometimes awkward). I waited a while for a menu, and the server offered his disculpas. The restaurant is full of amazing Mexican folk art: beautiful etchings, hand carved sculptures, colorful paintings, and a day of the dead alter with photos of famous people who have recently passed. Even the bathroom is pretty, with the doors to the stalls made of light and dark stained wood, with lines and cut outs. I had the Xoco margarita, which is pleasantly sour, slightly sweet, and refreshing, made with Cazadores Blanco, Citronage, fresh lime and cucumber, and homemade lime bitters. As a weary traveler, I opted for the red chile kale and topolobampo tortilla soup (sopa azteca). The kale was served in a tiny iron skillet, and the rich, mildly spicy guajillo sauce, onions, and potatoes complemented the kale very well. The sopa was incredible: a soothing dark chicken broth, avocado, thin strips of tortilla, cream, chicken (sustainably raised), and rich, handmade Jack cheese. It had the perfect balance of heartiness and spice. The side of tortillas were fresh and soft, but definitely not among the best I've had.I thought the portions were fair for the price, similar to what you would pay at a sit-down restaurant in D.F. It's an ideal place for sharing food: I really wanted the bacon guacamole, fall version, but alas, they only offer a portion for sharing."], ["Rob T.", "Food is great. \u00a0Drinks made to order. \u00a0Dietary restrictions double checked. \u00a0Your seated promptly based on your reservation. \u00a0What's not to love! \u00a0Wish all restaurants worked like this. \u00a0 The only thing that sucks is that the place is always packed that you have to wait forever to get the reservation you want or take a chance on sitting around as a walk in."], ["Kinnera P.", "Don't see what the hypes about.

Can't wait to go back soon!"], ["Natalia K.", "I've been here before when I was young and poor and anti \"weird\" combinations and so I ordered something plain and cheap and didn't really get to appreciate the awesomeness of the food here. Luckily, I have returned since, enticed by a Groupon deal. The deal provides you and your friend two margaritas, a street food item to share, and two entrees. I unfortunately could not have any of the margaritas because they all contained some form of orange liqueur and I am weirdly allergic to oranges, but my friend said he was happy to have two, and so I ordered the Paloma. The waiter described the drink to me as he was pouring it into the martini glass and told me it would be spicy because the mezcal is infused with peppers for two weeks. Our street food item was the pork tinga tacos and we accepted the offer to have it come with some spicy salsa on the side. The pork was perfection. I nearly ruined my second taco with a healthy helping of habanero sauce, not realizing just how spicy it would be. My mouth burned. My lips swelled. But I finished the taco, and am still able to say that I enjoyed it, mainly because I felt like a badass. And the Paloma? Not spicy at all. All I tasted now was refreshing grapefruit.My entree was the Oaxacan Carne Asada. Omg. Huge piece of meat. Sweet plaintains. A pile of black beans. And guacamole. I was in heaven. Ate everything but half of the beans. Steak was cooked to my liking, the guacamole was amazing, and the plantains were a nice bit of sweetness. The tortillas that come with the meal were useful as well- to make a couple more tacos with more of that awesome habanero sauce. That's right- I became immune. My friend enjoyed his Carne Asada Brava as well, though he said the tamales were on the bland side.For dessert, I tried their dessert margarita- the Cafe Tacuba, which was a cold coffee and chocolate concoction. Strong and very, very good. We also tried the flan duo because we clearly didn't have enough food, which was comprised of a vanilla flan and white chocolate flan. I much preferred the white chocolate flan, but both were light and creamy and delicious and we couldn't help but finish them both off.My only complaint about this place was the wait on everything. Reservation was at 9, but the table wasn't ready for a good 10-15 minutes. Then we had to wait a while for our waiter. Then our drinks, which came after the app. I felt like I was in a doctor's office. Once the food comes, however, it's worth the wait. Is it also worth the price? Not for an everyday meal, but definitely for a special occasion (or with a groupon)."], ["Michael T.", "The Saturday Special: ribs and grits, can't go wrong! \u00a0Also enjoyed the garlicky black beans, white rice and plantains with cheese. Adventurous!"], ["Jennifer H.", "From recording his tv shows to owning several cookbooks and even salsas and marinades from Rick Bayless, yeah, you could say we are fans. Of course, it makes sense that the very first meal we have in Chicago would be lunch at his restaurant, Frontera Grill. Before the restaurant even opened at 11:30am for lunch, people were already lined up to enjoy their long awaited savory experience. To our surprise, it really didn't take long for us to get seated since we lined up early.Basil blackberry margarita made its first appearance. It was like that first kiss that you anticipate. Is it going to be sweet? Is it going to be salty? Too overdone? It perfectly met the taste buds with the fruity aroma from the blackberry and the basil evened out the flavor by assuring the sweetness would not be overdone. Definitely unique. Surely worth a try.The duck quesadillas. Growing up, my mom always prepared duck and although it was one of my favorite dishes, it was always a battle between cooking the meat enough so its not too chewy and still preventing it from being so well done that it becomes stringy and hard. This duck at Frontera was incredibly tender and flavorful with each bite. It was cradled in Mexican cheese and blanketed in cooked tortillas that were crispy but still thick. No need to worry about an oily mess, because the dish was so neatly put together.The Big Wood Grilled Taco Trio. Amazing. The skirt steak became an obsession for me and I could not stop eating it. Order it medium rare on the rarer side and you will not be disappointed. The tender juiciness combined with the spiciness screamed at your senses with each bite. The pork in its red al pastor type marinade (or sauce?) also had its own powerful flavor and it was not overshadowed by the skirt steak. The Gunthorp chicken was not as spicy as its other \"siblings\" on the platter but still was very tasty. However, the chicken, soft in texture, and seasoned well, met the taste buds with more politeness.My hubby enjoyed that Mole Trio. It was served on a longer platter with the traditional mole in the center. The center mole was classic and every bite seemed familiar and what you expect a mole to be! The vegetarian mole on one of the ends which was actually green surprisingly one of may favorites on his dish. I did not get a chance to eat the third mole because he finished it before I did. Ho-hum, I guess I'll just have to come back some other time and try it myself!!One extremely exciting and unexpected treat was we actually saw Rick Bayless. Only the girls sitting at a table adjacent to us noticed and their gasps gave the news away. He simply was rearranging some of the pictures (or awards?) in the hallway on the way to the restrooms, just matter of factly and casually went to another area of a restaurant. They wanted a picture so badly with him, that I was almost tempted to ask him for one with them, but my hubs beckoned me not to bother him. Next time, I'm not listening to the hubs, I'm going to say \"hi!\""], ["Jennifer K.", "2.5 StarThough I wanted to dine in one of Rick Bayless restaurants during my weekend in Chicago. But I doubt I would ever wait for a table here again unless I have a reservation.When we first arrived at 5:30 pm and put our name on the list, our hostess inform us the wait would be around 2 hours or so and would text me when our table is ready. We went for a drink and pre dinner snack and back to check with the hostess and of course our table was not ready as yet. And Finally, we got seated around 9:00 pm. I would have just say forget it and eat somewhere else, but some one in our group really wanted to eat here.So does the food worth the crazy long wait? Not really....Margarita was weak.. I was glad I stuck with my beer.We ordered quite a few items to share, with some hits and misses and some just meh.The grilled meat plate we ordered were overcooked and tasted bland. The cerviche was a little dried. The Mole was really good, love the complex taste profile. Definitely order the dessert, which is probably the best part of the meal.I doubt I would be coming back to Frontera Grill again in my feature visit, unless I have a confirmed reservations and my travel mates are dragging me here.

The question is...is the hype deserved or is it overrated? After having wanted to dine there for a couple of years, but never finding the time during a visit, we finally made it to Frontera Grill. The resounding answer is YES, the hype is worth it and NO the restaurant is not overrated.LOCATION & ATMOSPHERERick Bayless seems to dominate the block where Frontera Grill is located. The restaurant is collocated with two of Bayless' other restaurants: Topolobampo (high-end Mexican cuisine) and Xoco (fast-casual sandwich concept). Frontera is in the heart of tourist central and is flanked by such exciting culinary destinations as Rainforest Caf\u00e9 and Maggiano's! It blows my mind that there were people dining and better yet WAITING to dine at these chain restaurants when such divine culinary art is happening all around these tourist traps here in Chicago. My gain, their loss is the way I look at it.It is still very much a pain to secure a reservation at Frontera as it primarily is a walk-in restaurant. They do offer few reservations for both lunch and dinner services. If you hate to wait and being in/near lines like I do, reservations in advance is the only way to go. You can always check the day or so before and if there have been cancellations you can snag one of those reservations.FOOD & BEVERAGESo, if you go to Frontera you absolutely have to try a margarita or two. They are delicious and there is a wide variety on the menu. From smoky mezcal-inspired concoctions to more traditional margaritas - there really is something for everyone. My 'at home' margarita recipe is from one of Bayless' cookbooks and my version is damn near close to what I was served at Frontera Grill. I saved my coin and only had one since I knew I could recreate something very similar at home. I had to test it out though to confirm!The food -- the food! As one would expect, this is where Frontera shines. We opted to explore the small plates/sharing portions of the menu versus having large entrees. This was the best way to go in my opinion as we got to try a little bit of everything. As many a reviewer behind me has said - the Ceviche Trio is a must have item for the table. Each ceviche was fresh and unique - great flavor combinations. The 'Street Food Trio' is another great item to share at the table. We ordered some of the vegetable sides and were happy with each of our choices - the Modern Black Beans, the Red-Chile Braised Kale with Local Potatoes, and the Pickled Jalapenos were great accompaniments to our meal.I'm so glad we finally had the opportunity to visit Frontera Grill and this will absolutely go on our rotation of restaurants we visit when we are in Chicago again.As I'm re-reading my review (congratulations if you made it this far!) -- I can't even believe I didn't mention the INSANELY obnoxious family beside us. The mother's voice were like nails on a chalkboard and they were all so unnecessarily loud. So you KNOW the food and drink were great for me to forget the obnoxious diners."], ["Adriana O.", "Me and my husband had been trying to come to Frontera Grill for almost a year. Surprisingly it seem to be closed all the time!! (Reason for giving them only 4 stars). After about 5 failed attempts we finally were able to get a reservation and it didn't disappoint.

Never had gourmet Mexican; Rick Bayless is hella famous; and I do find myself at Frontera Fresco often for lunch during my hour break between classes, so this seemed like a good choice. Food was delicious. However, the plates were tiny and way over-priced. I had to remind myself, it's GOURMET Mexican. I'm just not used to paying so much for Mexican food. I probably wouldn't pay to come here again, but would recommend to others for something different. Warning: read my second sentence.

I enjoyed the Sopes Rancheros most, it had a good blend of flavors and the taste came together very well.My friend and I also tried the Old School Frontera Trio, which consisted of chicken taquitos, quesadillas, and ceviche tostadas. Of these, I liked the ceviche tostadas most, but I've had better ceviche elsewhere.Overall a pretty decent place, but not one I would keep coming back for if I had the choice."], ["Annon Imus X.", "Normally when we visit Chicago, we don't like to repeat restaurants because there are just too darn many to try.

From the outside you don't even think that it is a restaurant, it looks like some kind of cool new modern store (or something). On the inside, it still has a bit of the same store feel until you notice all the tables and the three-sided bar.

There also appeared to be some outdoor seating, perhaps they even open the \"windows/walls\" when it's nice out.

Eventually the manager (who is so weird and super awkward) came over and we hinted that we weren't getting good service. He said something to our server THEN THEY BOTH DISAPPEARED. No one came over. No one apologized. Finally I asked this other waitress behind the bar (who was standing there doing nothing and watching the Bears game) if my friend could get a water- she brought over one glass, didn't bother to fill the empty glasses, and didn't even offer to get us more drinks. Finally I had to go up and ask for our check. Seriously? If you're not going to check on us or let us order more drinks at the very least let us leave. SUCH awful service. And so embarrassing that the dumbass manager was standing right there and didn't do anything. Moron. I'll never go back here. Which is sad bc I used to love this place back when Mark was the bartender. Save your money and go to Rockbottom next door."], ["Elizabeth R.", "This seriously may be my favorite downtown restaurant and I don't even love Mexican food all that much!But I do love the ambiance- their menu is fantastic and they have some really unique items such as the bacon wrapped jalape\u00f1o stuffed shrimp if I remember correctly, plus table side guacamole. Plus the ambiance just feels so swanky!you just sink into the booths and settle in with a tequila fused cocktail and omg I could probably make this my whole night. If you have a larger group- ask to be seated in the semi private dining area upstairs. Great view of city at night from the floor to ceiling Windows. Truly a great space and excellent food."], ["Wendy L.", "This place shines for its ambiance and decor, but food not so much. It's a reasonable choice for date night, especially if your date likes Mexican. The music is lively and the service is reasonable, not super quick but if you're having a great conversation, then it's perfect. It's loud, but not too loud where you have to shout to hear the person opposite you. They give you complementary chips and salsa; our chips were warm and fresh and I enjoyed the salsa. There's an extensive drink menu and their dinner menu also covers all the bases. We got barbacoa enchilada and carnitas tacos. I preferred the carnitas; the barbacoa erred on the salty side. The green beans that came with the enchilada tasted like cafeteria food and the rice was also sub-par. Overall, I was not impressed with either dish. I've had way better Mexican food at a cheaper price point.But I still had a great time :)"], ["Sam N.", "I should preface this review by saying I am not one of these people that go around asking myself \" where can i go eat and drink and then give people a hard time about a sub par experience\" I look for good experiences.Me and my friend were at the bar on Friday night and we took 2 seats at the bar. Now I thought that the bar was kind of dirty at least the space we wanted to sit at . It had some type of green residue possibly some chimichurri or light green looking substance that was lighgtly stained.I told the staff I was going to sit there and I waited 15 minutes for someone to come and tell us we could order over there. Upon further clarification it looked like the chimichuri stains had been there for a few days and the place smelled like a cross between a dirty mop and guac. But I like guac so I stayed.I got some guac and then the skirt steak. The waitstress/bartender asked us what we wanted but in a tone that was not entirely positive. The meal was ok.I think either the place has seen better days or a bad few days but maybe when cleaning the place all the lights can be turned on to see if maybe a spot has been missing in the clean up efforts...like the bar :)Since I am not a shit head, I will come back like in a month to see if it has improved because I realy do like the place and think it can do much better"], ["Carmen B.", "Can't go wrong with Happy Hour drinks and appetizers!

Beautiful inside and friendly attentive staff. We ordered a side of guacamole which they make right at the table - delicious! Let's talk about the divine tortilla chips - warm and just the right amount of salt paired with two tasty salsas I was obsessed with the darker coloured salsa and had a hard time stopping dipping !! This was just for lunch and as I was going out later for deep dish pizza i didn't want to eat too heavy so I just got a bowl of chicken tortilla soup really good !! Our waiter was great and checked on us during our meal and brought the bill promptly. My friends also enjoyed their meals. Lovely clean bathrooms too. I highly recommend it ps they have a great bar and drink selection too !!"], ["Anamaria H.", "Six words: Strong margaritas, delicious chilaquiles, relaxed brunch.I decided to check out Cantina Laredo on the Sunday of Riot Fest for breakfast. Sounds weird when you think about it but I had read in the Friday edition of the RedEye that they were offering a margarita special that morning. I just couldn't pass that up, especially considering beer at the festival was running $8 \u00a0a 16oz can and the margaritas were only $5 and double the alcohol content. So it made total sense if you thought about it.My Riot Fest buddy and I arrived around noon and were ready for food. It had been a good 16 hours since our last meal so we were ravenous. Brunch runs from 11:30am until 3pm and there are a ton of options! Tons of eggy-breakfasty types but then some interesting combinations. I ended up opting for the Chilaquiles and my friend got the Crab Cakes. We both got two Casa Rita margaritas and the drinks arrived first and were amazing. If you like your margaritas to taste like tequila, then come here! If you're looking for something that masks the taste of alcohol, I wouldn't recomend these for you. Personally, I like my margaritas strong so I was quite happy.I was also in love with my entree. The chilaquiles were absolutely delicious. I've been on a chilaquile kick these past few months, grabbing it every time I see it on the menu for breakfast/brunch. Something about the tortillas, salsa verde, and fried eggs just screams amazing. But I also am someone who loves a savory breakfast and I often opt for the breakfast item that has the most vegetables in it. The entree also came with this delicious potato salad - that I devoured in a hot second - and a little fruit salad in some sort of cinnamon pastry shell. It reminded me of the sopapillas you find everywhere in Arizona and New Mexico but much drier and less flavorful. I took one bite of it and was done with it. If you're going to put food in something edible, at least make it taste good. That was my one fault with the entire meal. They could've just gave me my fruit in a bowl and I would have been happier. Overall, I definitely enjoyed the brunch experience. It kept me full until about 7pm, which I thought was great, especially considering I spent the entire afternoon running around a muddy field, rocking out to great music. I definitely want to come back here for breakfast. It was quiet and fairly empty and super casual. I was dressed in punk-fest clothes (think combat boots and an oversized band sweatshirt) and I didn't stand out. But I feel as if I came here during dinner I would have to dress a little nicer, just based on the vibe of the restaurant. Tons of fireplaces and cute little couch areas."], ["Foodie F.", "My wife and I started frequenting Cantina Laredo from the day it opened. \u00a0The modern architecture is stunning, with clean lines and a very large dining area. \u00a0I found their Cointreau Margaritas fantastic! \u00a0The table side guacamole was superb. \u00a0I typically ordered the Carnitas tacos, made with very fresh ingredients. \u00a0The service was also extraordinary, with management frequently going from table to table making sure everything exceeds the customer's expectations. \u00a0This was in the beginning. \u00a0We continued to dine there over the following year and were disappointed to watch the quality slowly drop. \u00a0Eventually, the quality of the food and service was not worth the opportunity cost so we moved on."], ["David S.", "A solid three star joint. \u00a0The house Margs were decent albeit they were relatively small to what I was expecting. The tuna taco app was pretty good. I had the Barbacoa enchiladas which delivered pretty good on the over taste scale. I'm not sure why other reviews complain about menu selection. I actually thought the menu was rather consice instead of including every combo of every typical Mexican ingredient."], ["Jacqueline B.", "The ambiance and drinks alone will have me coming back to Cantina Loredo!I came here for dinner on a Friday night with a group of 11 girls. The company was fab so we were bound to have a great time regardless, but the fancy drinks and delicious food helped :)We had a reservation and were sat upstairs at a big table near the bar. It seemed pretty busy so I'd assume a rezzy is the way to go for dinner!We started with a couple orders of their top shelf guacamole made table side. One was made mild and one spicy. The guacamole was definitely fresh and tasty, but for someone who likes spicy food I didn't think the one batch had enough kick.Speaking of kicks, I've been on a minty drink kick lately, so I ordered their Ginger Mint Mango Rita (Milagro Silver Tequila, fresh lime juice, mint leaves and mango puree topped with ginger beer). I thought this was a refreshing and fun take on your classic margarita! It was really good.For my second cocktail (of course there are seconds on ladies night), I went with the Cabo Flip which was a suggestion from our server. He said it was the smoothest marg he's ever had. Sounded good to me so I got it. This lovely beverage is a fresh lime margarita made with Cabo Wabo Reposado and Grand Marnier Orange Liqueur with a lime boat full of tequila. You read correctly. A lime boat. Full. Of. Tequila.It was so yummy! Again, super refreshing and even fun to flip that little tequila lime shot over in your cocktail.With all this boozin we of course needed dinner. I haven't had barbakoa for quite some time, so the Enchiladas De Barbacoa caught my eye. These slow-roasted brisket and monterey jack cheese enchiladas topped with ranchera sauce made me not regret my decision that's for sure.I was pretty full from all the chips and guacamole I had prior to our meal, but of course I powered thru. Now for someone who's tasted a lot of really authentic Mexican food I have to say, this wasn't a five star food experience for me. Don't get me wrong it was good and I'll most likely be back to explore the rest of the menu, just not the best Mexican I've ever had. 4 stars though.All in all this was an awesome place to come with a group. Our server was attentive and hilarious which made everything that much more fun. If you haven't been yet, definitely check out Cantina Loredo!"], ["David B.", "I am always wary of chains, but I've never been disappointed by Cantina Laredo. This was my 2nd or 3rd time there, and the food has always been top-notch. The table side guacamole is fun to watch being prepared and even more fun to eat. My entree of the stuffed green peppers (with shrimp and cheese) was delicious and makes my mouth water just uploading the photo."], ["Andrew C.", "Its a Solid 3 Star Spot. wondering why? I will tell you!The Decor is nice but its a little dark in the evenings for me. it doesn't exactly feel like a date spot but the mood lighting definitely will make you sleepy :)The staff is super friendly (WAY TO GO MIKE!) but on the back side the \"bag check\" they offer you at the front door is just putting your bag in the unlocked closet in the front...and in our case the waitress got off work when we went to pick up the bag and the guy that helped us had NO IDEA IF THE BAG WAS ACTUALLY OURS. So just say you should keep your bag with you or take the risk of some random person taking your dope Gucci :)The food was a mix of MEH and MORE! The Fresh-made-at-the-table-Guac was incredibly flavorful and exactly what I needed to start the meal. I mean the tacos were tasty but by the time I got them it was obvious that they had been sitting under a heat lamp for quite some time. the beans also had become hardened and dry from the constant heat and the rice didn't fare much better either. I'm sure if it wasn't under the heat lamp the food would have been GOOD but it wasn't so MEH!I will come back and try them again, because the staff was on their stuff (aside from the fiasco with the bag) so maybe it was just a crazy night in the kitchen."], ["Joanna T.", "Just another place where ambience and drink menu rule. So I would recommend you come for that. Mojitos are adventurous and good, margaritas as well. Did I mention the decor? Fabulous! Open, airy, sleek and modern. And lively, so come for that, too, if the mood strikes. So, not a home run. I planned to have dinner, but after the fish taco app which was not very appetizing, at all, the drinks, can you please give me a decent chip to scoop guacamole with? The guac was good, by the way. I finished my drinks and called it a night. The flavor is just not there when it came to food. Didn't stick around to find out if dinner would be better. Also, no shrimp or steak tacos on the menu. Is this an oversight? I should have checked the menu instead of assuming, so my fault. A skip. Except for drinks, and guac, byo chips."], ["Elora H.", "The table side guacamole was excellent. I had a chicken enchilada with mole. The mole sauce was very good. The other guest in my party had the shrimp tacos which they said was very good.

I HIGHLY recommend:- Steak nachos (~10)- literally strips of steak on each nacho with refried beans, cheese, tomatoes, guac and sour cream. This app has around 8-10 nachos and is MORE than enough for 2-4 people. It can easily be served as an entree. - Carnita taco entree (~$12)- Cantina Laredo overnight cooks the carnitas so they are so flavorful, juicy and to die for. Comes with three tacos, rice and beans.DO NOT order the fish tacos. They are dry and flavorless. Such a waste!!!Other notes:- Trendy, upscale, date-like atmosphere- There are private rooms that have big flat screen TVs for your use- Nice outdoor seating (with firepit)- If you order the guacamole, they will create it in front of you all fancy and such. Bit pricy for what it is, but it certainly adds something extra to the dining experience."], ["Dusty S.", "Had a great post-business dinner alone at the bar at Cantina Laredo.

My friend and I went here after work one time during happy hour. They have this really cute upstairs lounge that they were serving everything on the menu at half price up there. Everything on the menu! Also the feel of the lounge was pretty great! They had oversize seats and it almost had the \"coffeeshop\" feel to it. It was someplace where you were encouraged to sit and hang out for a while, rather than eating and leaving. My favorite thing might have been the guacamole that we ordered. They made it right in front of us at the table and it was so fresh! Also as far as their drinks go they were a little on the stronger side. They still tasted great, but it was a drink that you could definitely taste the alcohol in."], ["Dan B.", "The space is amazing but that seems to be all it has going for it.

A mild and a spicier - the spicy is warm. Warm salsa, yummmm. The chips are thin, so they break easily. But I love thin chips!My friend got three tacos - ahi tuna. He said they were delicious.

We started with the guacamole. They make it fresh table side, which was fun. The taste was very bland though. Definitely expected more out of such expensive guacamole. I had the chicken tacos. Flavors were okay, chicken was a bit dry. Probably wouldn't order them again. Had a bite of my friend's queso dip though and that was good! Sort of tastes like Qdoba queso. The drinks were all really good too. I had the mojito and it was great. Overall a fun restaurant. Good for a date night or a nice dinner with a large group.

I had a friend visiting this weekend and after walking down Michigan, seeing the bean, and divvy biking around all morning, we were ready for some munching. Purple Pig quoted an hour wait and we were too hungry so we just walked around until we saw this place. We sat down immediately and started stuffing ourselves with chips. Said no thanks to the table-side prepped guac but now I wish we hadn't because it looked tasty. We ordered two brunch entrees, the chicken fajitas and the spinach and artichoke omelet, which both came with a Bloody Mary or a mimosa. The bloody was definitely from a store bought bottle but at that point in the day a Bloody Mary is a Bloody Mary is a Bloody Mary and sometimes you don't really care about the mix. The fajitas came out sizzling and the omelet was tasty--served with potatoes (which I doused in hot sauce) and a little fruit cup made of a fried crispy cinnamon sugar tortilla... The perfect dessert. Our waitress was super nice and did a great job. The inside of this place is gorgeous too! More people should check this place out!"], ["Ziyan C.", "My review's from last summer (July 2014), when I organized a student networking event on behalf of my nonprofit. I had contacted several restaurants that had space for such an event, but most places had a minimum spending that was way beyond our nonprofit's budget. Cantina was ok with us spending a minimum of $400 on appetizers for a group of 40. I worked with Rhonda over email, and she was very accommodating, responsive, and flexible. We were able to have the Northeast Lounge reserved for us. The space had low tables with seats, as well as a longer table with tall bar chairs that ended up being a better area for networking and moving around. It was plenty of space for the 50+ people who showed up, and it was really nice with huge windows, lots of natural light, and a good view from the 2nd floor at downtown Chicago.I was able to set up a little before our students started showing up. There was a main server who checked with me throughout the night on how we were doing food-wise, and I was very happy with the service as they made good suggestions and were attentive. We got a lot of appetizers, from guacamole to salsa to flatbreads, and all were good. Thank you for helping us host a great event; I highly recommend Cantina Laredo for this!"], ["Jennifer G.", "Craving Mexican food, we have gone back twice since I wrote the last post. \u00a0The first time, I stuck with a chicken and mango salad - figured it was better to get a dish that was supposed to be cold. \u00a0It was good. \u00a0But again - my margarita wasn't that great.Then we went for New Year's Eve and their special menu. \u00a0We ordered their special champagne and margarita. \u00a0Now - those drinks were delicious and you definitely felt it after two of them. \u00a0The entrees for both my husband and myself were lukewarm - almost on the cool side. \u00a0We sent them back and would you believe that the rice was still not hot when it came back?I know - you're probably wondering why we keep going back? \u00a0The restaurant itself is really beautiful and I think the wait staff is really good, too. \u00a0Next time (I can't help myself), I will ask beforehand to make sure my food is hot."], ["Chris R.", "Sat at the bar yesterday after marathon with out of town guests for a quick snack/drink.The young woman behind the bar sort of taking care of us (understatement) was apparently having the worst day of her life and it was rubbing off on us and her co-workers.

I have often walked by and seen this place but never thought about trying as i figured River North could not have a decent taco joint.I came over one day around 5PM to take advantage off their half off food menu. I guess the deal is only valid in the upstairs lounge which looks really nice with bar, hi-tops, and couches/love seats around near a fireplace equipped with intimate lighting. I was excited to try the food here. Sad to say I was correct about a joint in River North not having good tacos as I am used to having tacos with flavor. I got the barbacoa, fish and short rib tacos. All were very bland as I found myself stuffing almost a whole taco in my mouth to get the experience over with. The chips and warm salsa which is free proved to be a better meal. Service was pretty good as the bartender was able to whip up those margaritas in a quick like manner.The saving grace for this place other than the ambience was the margaritas. Their signature margarita (Casa Rita) was pretty good as well as the Pineapple infused Rita and Cinco Margarita. I would try the place again but would not have high expectations for the food at all."], ["Kent T.", "We were invited to meet friends here while visiting Chicago.He said they had the BEST margarita's in the area! I don't drink, but I guess they were right because everyone else had a few and raved about how delicious they were!We ordered \"table side\" guac. Can't get fresher than that! I wish it had been a bit spicier, we ordered spicy but alas it was not really. And it needed a bit of salt. That is to my taste. Still good guac by anyones standards.For my dinner, I had the Mole Enchiladas. The sauce was great, the chicken stand alone did not have a ton of flavor. That is one of my tests for a fancy Mexican, taste the meat with out the sauce. It will tell you a lot about the place! It should have flavor, not taste plain. But over all the dish was pretty good.For desert, we ordered churros for the table. YES!!

Very modern and the architecture/design is really wonderful. Unfortunately, that was probably the best part of my experience here.I came here for a birthday brunch on Sunday, and we were seated in one of the enclosed areas.

One was warm and the other was served cold, and both were flavorful. I ordered the spinach and artichoke omelette, which comes with a side of cheesy potatoes and fruit in a little bowl made with cinnamon-dusted pastry. I asked them to leave out the cheese and mushrooms from my omelette. When my plate came out, they told me they didn't serve me any potatoes because those came with cheese too. What? I'm not allergic to cheese, I just prefer to not have cheese with my eggs. That doesn't mean you leave out an entire portion of my meal... especially if you didn't even ask me beforehand. Baffling. The actual omelette was okay. I've had better elsewhere and flavors were uninspired. The entree came with a free mimosa, bloody mary, or non-alcoholic drink, and I opted for the mimosa. Good, but nothing special. (The best I've had was definitely at Sunda). Service was okay. Satisfactory but not great.

Pretty much sums up my experience at Cantina Laredo. \u00a0This is a large location in downtown Chicago, so it's great for groups or after work drinks.

When we arrived at the right table, it wasn't cleaned or set up from the party before us and we had to wait an additional 5 minutes. I was prepared to let this slide as the place seemed chic and professional. After ordering drinks from our waiter, he said he would bring us water. We waited 20 minutes for water.

We also had not seen our waiter since he brought the drinks. I went to speak to a manager who simply looked at me and said, \"I will go check in back\".

What could've been better: ambiance, it was LOUD..

Also the shrimp-stuffed chile relleno with veggies & cheese. Each dish was a perfect mix of the right ingredients. Entrees range in price from about $13 for tacos to $30 for a ribeye.

Chips are good but too flimsy, each time I scooped sauce- it would break.We ordered tacos, fajitas, and enchiladas. All good but chicken wasn't that flavorful.

The ceviche was okay but nothing special.

After bothering the crew to come out on a Friday, we scored some 6:15 reservations to try Cantina Laredo.We were seated in a booth on the north wall, which was illuminated by natural light coming from the ceiling, this was unusually cool and made the whole atmosphere a bit brighter, literally and figuratively. We started with a couple Casa Ritas, which were just OK, but not exactly $9.25 OK, but in my experience all cocktails in the city are around $10, so whatever I guess.Read the reviews of the tableside guacamole and had to try it. Very interesting procedure, I just wish the person making it was a bit more sociable. It kind of reminded me of how Coldstone Creamery forms your ice cream when you order a bunch of stuff mixed in. Anyway, we ordered it \"medium\" and were very impressed by this guac. I wouldn't consider myself a guac expert, but this was definitely better than most places, I do recommend it. The traditional chips and salsa were good as well, we voted the hotter of the two was better.Entrees included 2 tamales, enchiladas Veracruz and pollo chipotle fajitas (maybe enchiladas, can't remember). The tamales were very interestingly wrapped in a corn husk. My dish was the pollo chipotle enchiladas, which were super awesome. They came with tortilla shells and it was kind of like \"create your own\" with all the toppings provided. The little amount of bacon that came on them was fantastic, and made for an interesting flavor combination. The traditional rice and black beans (great) were included as well, making this dish actually pretty large for being around $17. My only gripe about this dish would have to be how messy it was. Granted I was being a child and using my hands, but still felt the interaction with the food was a necessary mess. We did order desert, almost one of everything. I had the churros which were yummy, especially with the sauce, which wasn't quite chocolate, but my memory escapes me what the correct terminology for it would be.Overall, the food was fantastic, not too expensive and definitely different in a good way.My reason for subtracting a star is definitely because of the service. Our waiter did not make any conversation aside from taking our order, removing plates, replenishing our chips and showing us the desert selections. He didn't do anything wrong, he just didn't make the experience a 5-star one, which kind of sucks for him because we usually tip a quality server quite well! Regardless, the demeanor of our server didn't change the fact that our food was awesome, we had a good time, and didn't spend too much $.

It's worth it to come here just to try one of these - I haven't seen them in any other Mexican restaurant in the city. The bread is smoky and spicy while not being very soggy and holding it's own. Be prepared to have messy fingers though. The meats are juicy and well spiced, tempered by cool lettuce and cheese. Glorious. The other food is quite tasty as well, but not necessarily more exceptional than you might find at other places in the area.

Amazing! You also get a heaping helping of rice and beans. \u00a0The asada was perfect! I was so full after destroying the chips, guac, and one taco, I had plenty leftover. \u00a0My friend ordered the burrito dinner with a large horchata (they do not serve alcohol here nor is it BYOB and it's cash only - I think those are charming characteristics of El Habanero). \u00a0The horchata was gargantuan and our server, she may have been one of the owners, joked and asked if I wanted a straw too. \u00a0My friend devoured half of his burrito, rice, and beans and was done-zo. \u00a0Side note - while we were just about stuffed full, a guy came up to our table, thanked us for dining with them, invited us back, shook our hands, gave us a tip on how to reheat the burrito, shook our hands again, then walked away. \u00a0We assume he was also one of the owners.

The chips were greasy and the house salsa tasted like marinara sauce, while the table tomatillo salsa was bland. As vegetarians our waitress was helpful in going over the menu (they don't have lard in their beans, by the way). We ordered huevos rancheros as well as a rajas con queso gordita. Everything was really underwhelming: the ranchero salsa was very plain and looked like mostly tomato sauce; the egg yolks were mostly cooked through; the rice and beans were pretty basic (with those bits of frozen veggies common in tex-mex rice); and the gordita, while better, was rather greasy and \u00a0definitely needed some seasoning. It took quite a while for us to be served, which was odd considering they weren't very busy. The manager, once he noticed this, walked away, and it was again another few minutes before we heard from anyone. Once we did order, the food took quite a bit considering there were few customers. I'm not too picky when it comes to service, and if the food were great then I would've definitely looked over this, but the service was a bit off. To be fair, they did notice (or maybe we looked grumpy?) and were extremely kind to us for the last half of our meal (3 or 4 different people would come by to ask us if everything was okay). The worst part is that my friend and I both got sick from the food. She threw up a bit and we had to get some pepto bismol on the way home. I wanted to make sure that it wasn't the stale popcorn that we'd eaten earlier in the day, so I went ahead and ate the left overs, and the food is making my stomach turn for the second day in a row. They do seem like nice people, but the spotty service and really underwhelming food would make me warn others from going."], ["George K.", "Can't say enough about this little family owned restauraunt they are so sincere and welcoming from the owner to the employees. Now to the food. Phenomenal steak tacos great steak and the toppings very fresh. Guac was to die for and the rice and beans were home made you can taste it! Love this place and totally recommend!!"], ["Lauren D.", "BUEN PROVECHO! I am updating my review. The simple menu is filled with scrumptious surprises, from the different taco choices to the enchilades to huaraches and Pambazo sandwiches. I had the pambazo con carne asada, which I rate with 3-stars. My husband ordered the hurarches with carne asada. He said it was very good and he went with 4-stars. Our Server said,\"Buen Provecho\" as she carefully delivered our food to the table. The red salsa was freshly made and thick. I loved the taste of fresh cilantro in the salsa. Portions are prodigious. Well, like a fat kid who loves chocolate cake or a huge bag of chocolate chip cookies I love El Habanero!Of course, there is no easy way to eat a pambazo sandwich. You have to get in there and shove it into your mouth fast and furious. In and out, fast, in and out, fast. Yes, it is very, very messy, but worth every single stain! Now, now, get your mind out of the gutter -- stop your dirty little thoughts from getting the best of you, people! Your hands, fingers and face will be stained in red-orange from the guajillo (gu-a-he-yo) pepper sauce applied to the exterior of the bolillo (bo-lee-yo) bread. The bread was very fresh and fluffy, but I wished it was grilled a bit longer. IMO, it did not appear to be grilled enough. Regardless, it was good and worthy of 3-stars (last year it was 4-stars). I only wished my pambazo had more carne asada. Last year, the ratio of meat, lettuce, sour cream and cheese was simplemente perfecto y ten\u00eda mucho sabor. The carne asada, this time, was dry and bland. The meat didn't taste fresh. Maybe it was left over from the previous day -- I don't know. I am not sure if we came on an \"off\" day. We ordered a side of yellow Spanish rice. You can easily share this with another individual. We did. Sadly, the rice was not seasoned very well. I never, ever put salt on my food, but the rice was missing something. It lacked flavor, so I lightly salted my rice. Maybe they need to pick up some spices at \"The Spice House\" para darle m\u00e1s sabor al arroz amarillo. I highly recommend their POZOLE, which is excellent, hearty and 5-star worthy. This is a version of Mexican stew, but it is not a heavy, thick broth like other stews. You can taste the amalgamation of garlic, onions, cilantro, ancho and guajillo chiles and other fresh herbs and spices. Oh, spice, spice baby! The pozole tiene mucho sabor, and will not disappoint. If you have never tried pozole before try something different. It may become one of your favorite dishes, and try it with one of their many sandwiches. The thick chips are complementary. They were fresh, plentiful, but greasy. I had two or three chips with the red salsa. The green salsa has a bit less heat to it, but was nicely balanced. NOTE: A second round of chips will cost you $1.50. The red and green homemade salsa is worthy of 4-stars. We parked on the side street (Spaulding) where there are several angled parking spaces (with meters). Look for the bright vivid orange awning (corner of Spaulding and Fullerton; one block east of Kimball Ave). It is across the street from the Bella Cafe.Fifteen minutes after we arrived four other customers strolled into the restaurant. I was super fain that we weren't the only people here on a Friday afternoon. Mexican cooking has been coming of age for the last several decades, especially in the City. There are so many choices in Chicago, from the south side to the north side. We have our upscale places, too, showcasing the gastronomic styles for several regions of Mexico. These Mexican taquerias appear to be in such profusion, that -- if taco trucks are also considered -- you are now never very far from a very good and inexpensive taco joint. Yes, it is still BYOB. YES, DAMMIT, CASH ONLY ($20 should do it for lunch -- maybe $30 to 35 for dinner). Our final total: $15 and change (excluding tip). We both had water (we do not drink soda pop). We enjoyed our lunch and the Spanish music in the background added to the vibe of this sparsely, but vibrantly colorful joint.This time, the food fell short for me in terms of taste and quality. The meat was not tender, moist or flavorful. Service was friendly, polite and ebullient. We appreciated the owner's kindness, attentiveness and warm philoxenia. However, service was lackadaisical. I have reduced my rating by one star due to some of the above issues. TIPS: (1) There is a Walgreen's Store on the corner of Fullerton & Kimball with a Chase Bank ATM; (2) This area is Pay to Park; (3) Parking is FREE on SUNDAYS ONLY and (4) They serve breakfast all day long!El Habanero has been my jam for a while. If you are ever in this neighborhood, hit them up and make El Habanero your jam too! I will give them the benefit of the doubt, because this is one of my \"go to\" joints which I always enjoy. The Owners are always friendly and kind. I'll assume they were having an off day when we came here."], ["Adrie Rose L.", "I have never been disappointed coming here. My family and I come here at least 2x/week. I have tried almost everything on the menu a few times as my family and I share plates.

We also tried the chile relleno soft tacos which were quite a surprise. I'm a huge fan of chile rellenos but I have never had it in taco form. Each $2 taco came with a full (smaller sized) deep fried chile filled with these. Delicious!The show stopper was without question the chicken pambazos. I have never had this dish before, and I can't wait to try it again with different proteins. It's basically a sandwich... like a torta, but the bread is slightly crispy on the outside and super moist inside. It's dipped in this bright red huajillo pepper sauce, which provided exceptional flavor. It was all sorts of messy and very addictive.Great spot!"]], "El Nuevo Mexicano": [["Rustygirl M.", "Cramped inside but has cute patio in back.

The guacamole was delicious. \u00a0You could tell it was made to order and it was fresh. \u00a0They made it with the right amount of spice for us. \u00a0I also really liked the salsa that came with the chips - \u00a0a nice zing without too much. I managed to get two different entrees the two different times I have been in for dinner. I had the shrimp with garlic and mango and then the fish tacos. \u00a0Both were very good. \u00a0The preparation is simple but executed well. \u00a0I liked both dishes and found that the fish tacos were more filling. \u00a0I also really liked the side salad that came with the fish tacos with the jicama. \u00a0 I also was surprised at how much I liked the chipotle mashed potatoes -I couldn't stop eating them! \u00a0 My dining companions seemed to like their dishes as well - from the beef burrito to the steak tacos to the amish chicken, everyone was pleased. \u00a0As soon as the food came, it was quiet which is always a good sign. The drinks are good, but as most places, this is where things can get expensive. \u00a0Yet, our waiter was very helpful in getting everyone something that they liked. \u00a0Service was friendly and quick. \u00a0I was surprised at how quickly our dinner came out of the kitchen.

They had raved about it being the \"best Mexican in the area\" so my expectations were set fairly high.The management and staff accommodated our large group very well- I felt that the service was exceptionally good. Orders were taken and filled quickly as well as accurately. Meals were prepared and served quickly especially considering that we visited in prime time on a Saturday night.It was nice that the menu has clear descriptions of each dish for those who may be unfamiliar with Mexican cuisine. The complete descriptions encouraged some members of our party to try something new rather than their old standbys. There are a couple of interesting sounding vegetarian/vegan choices on the menu that I nearly ordered. There is also an option for gluten free quinoa instead of rice for those who prefer it.I felt most of what we were served to be average/typical at best; having said that, the chile ancho sauce that my shrimp was served in tasted spectacular and I felt was a major cut above on the flavor scale. This sauce had the perfect balance of heat and sweet for my taste buds. I only wish I had ordered extra rice to be able to soak it all up.So, although El Nuevo may indeed be the best Mexican in Chicago's Lakeview- I feel that it is hardly the \"Best Mexican\" in N. Illinois and S. Wisconsin. For most people it will be a fine if somewhat spendy choice.Side observation- obviously not the management's responsibility, but during our meal, several couples came in, studied the menu for 10 or more minutes and left without being seated. I found this to be curious behavior to say the least.My rating: Service 4 stars, selection 3 stars, presentation 3 stars, food quality 3.5 stars, prices 2 stars.Worth a try if you are in the area."], ["Isabel C.", "Just got home from dining here and the small restaurants in Chicago never cease to amaze me. El Nuevo Mexicano was no different! I went tonight for a friends birthday, we had a party of 8 people and a few were late. The staff was nice and did not rush us on ordering, just kept refilling our drinks and our chips and salsa, which were amazing! Margaritas were so so. Finally we ordered and of course I changed my order at the last minute to chicken tacos on corn tortillas. Pretty plain but I'm not too adventurous with Mexican food. That is my only upset, that the menu is not laid out for easy reading and browsing. It is all in Spanish and not very organized so I did not see everything thus changing my order at the last minute to the same as what my friend got. The food did not take very long and came out looking beautiful! Besides the presentation it as delicious! Double layered tortillas and fresh chicken breast that was so tender it was starting to shred itself, not that cubed stuff you often get. Big pieces of lettuce and red cabbage, my favorite! Also came with a small side of rice and refried beans! The perfect portions of everything! Lastly my friend got a free piece of tres leches cake because it was her birthday and the staff sang to her with maracas and even put a sombrero on her!

The Carne Asada Steak & Pollo Adobo Marinated Chicken are very close 2nd favorites to the pork. Which one wins would clearly be a matter of personal preference. The fish taco was a little too tartary for my taste but that's literally my only minor critique. Their guacamole is made with dried cherries & who knew that would make it so delicious - but it does. They are generous with homemade chips and their red & green salsas are available at your table. Green is way spicier!You order at the counter, cash only.

Ours were loaded with the respected meats. The best of the night was the Gringo which had perfectly charred steak cuts and what I thought had an excellent flavor in conjunction with the melted cheese. It also comes with rice and beans which were both by far my favorite rice and beans I've had in any Mexican restaurant yet. The Al Pastor taco was my second favorite. I just loved the pineapples with the pork - maybe because it brings me back to my origins of tropical happiness. Ok, so yes, the tacos are incredibly oily...and everything is probably loaded with a ton of salt too, which in combination naturally makes it a heinous crime to eat....but sometimes, when you crave that delicious, beautiful carne asada taco...you're allowed to throw all that out the window.L' Patron is the place to go.Note: it is practically a zoo in there on weekend nights.

Usually I feel pretty terrible once I leave because I ate wayy too much food, but oh man I love it. I ALWAYS ALWAYS get:1. Gringa: their house special with al pastor meat. First, why al pastor? Well, it's thick chunks of pork marinated with a bit of spice AND GRILLED WITH PINEAPPLES. Next, what IS the house special? It's the al pastor meat sandwiched between two corn tortillas smothered in chihuahua melting cheese. Omg. Can I just have this delivered to my lab every day? It also comes with a side of refried beans and rice that make it amazing. 2. Carne Asada torta or burrito: depending on my food, I either get more or less carbs. Both are amazing, and the torta is a nice switch up.I tend to come early to avoid the traffic and the cashier seems to recognize me since I order the same thing every time. Highly highly recommended.Oh and you can find plenty of (free!) street parking off some of the streets."], ["Dalia H.", "Just came in tonight with the family, 4 of them kids.

SCORE! We ordered the sweet corn and green chile tamale, grilled steak, chipotle chicken, and cochinita pibil torta grilled sandwiches. The tamale was great with bits of fresh corn studded throughout with creamy goat cheese and ricotta. My favorite torta was the cochinita pibil -- pork was tender and spicy with the pickled onions adding a punch of acidity.

The food (and I can speak for this location and the Skokie location) is awesome. This time around I had the chicken quesadilla and salad, with a side of chips and salsa, all of which were amazing. The only complaint I have here is that the salsa portions are pretty small compared to the amount of chips and food you get to go along with it.The only other thing that brings this down a star is that while the cashier and other staff were friendly, they all had a problem with vocal projection. The first woman who helped us with the chips was right in front of us, separate by the counter/glass and I was having issues hearing her... this is a loud place, you need to use your outside voice if you're working! Then the cashier came over to us (the line was backed up a bit) to ask for our order. Then she went back to the register and shouted a couple questions to us about our order, unfortunately she didn't shout loud enough since she was at least 15 feet away, so we could not understand her. The wait time was not the fastest, but acceptable considering it was a Macy's day after Christmas sale, and there were probably about a dozen orders in before ours, and I constantly saw food coming out.In any case, I will definitely eat at the Frontera Fresco brand restaurants again, and would definitely recommend this to a friend."], ["Brian S.", "Tough one to rate.

I didn't really care about waiting at all, at least he caught it before she ate it. But then he asked if I wanted him to wrap one up to go home, and gave us some guac and chips to snack on while my friend was waiting. Superb service for a restaurant in a food court! Now on to the actual food itself. The tortas were amazing-- I think I may have liked these better than the couple of ones I tried at Xoco-- crunchy on the outside from being grilled and soft and delicious on the inside. There was plenty of shrimp and avocado in the sandwich too. Definitely will go back. My coworkers are hooked too- one said it was the best meal he's ever had downtown.

I ended up trying the chips&salsa/guacamole with Chipotle shrimp tacos. I got the guacamole just regular, but they have a whole bar of toppings you can add. I might recommend adding toppings because having it plain wasn't anything fantastic, I've had better. Salsa tasted really fresh but just was too watery for me. On the other hand, the tacos were pretty good. You get 2 sizeable ones for about $7.50, which seemed a little pricey at the time for lunch but the ingredients did taste quality.

I had the pulled pork tacos with pickled onions; while tasty, they were very greasy, and frankly were not as good as the ones I get at Burrito Parilla Mexicana in Lombard and Naperville. I think Mom hit the jackpot with the Huarache (sort of like a flatbread pizza thing).

I said \"WHAT tax did you charge me!?\" He said 10.5% I said ok you still overcharged me I want my drink.

The tacos were very greasy, the meat had a lot of fatty bits in it, and they did not come with the traditional lime/onion/cilantro combo. It was just some grisly meat in a tortilla with lettuce on the side. Furthermore, they use a lot of lard in the food. I am originally from California and maybe the Mexican restaurants there are forced to be a bit more health conscious, but I am not particularly excited about eating food cooked with lard in 2015. BUT, the salsas were good and fresh, service was very quick, and it's cheap. CASH ONLY though. They have an ATM inside that charges you $2.50 to withdraw and my bank charged me another $2.50 so that was kind of unpleasant as well. Overall, I don't see myself coming back here out all.

I really like it - it's more homey which fits with Lincoln Park and is better for more casually meeting friends for tacos or drinks. I've stopped in for drinks, for dinner, or even for a midafternoon snack. Just grabbed one taco for a couple bucks and move on. Taco Joint has some good tacos. I think the ones listed on their regular menu are good, nothing really mind-blowing, but the daily specials are definitely the best part of their taco offerings. I've had some truly great brisket tacos and pork belly tacos. Oftentimes I just wish those daily specials would be the regular menu items. I always get one or two of the daily specials when I go.The margaritas can also be a good deal. I really like the bourbon-based one, very strong but has some really cool flavor to it. That one isn't available in a pitcher, but the others are, and, if you've got a couple friends, pitchers are definitely the way to go."], ["Amanda M.", "More of a 3.5 (same rating given for RN location).Came Sunday evening around 8pm and we were seated promptly, although place was still quite busy.We got the traditional guacamole to start and I got the cochinita taco and the taco del dia which was pozole. Everything came out wicked fast which was nice.I noticed right away the discrepancy between the amount of guacamole and chips. While I liked the mix of chips including plantain chips, there was just way too much to suffice the amount of guacamole. I didn't mind the size of the guac but it didn't make sense to me to have that many chips. \u00a0Anyways, aside from this minor annoyance, I was disappointed in the lack of flavor of the guac. I thought it was bland and basic. I definitely can make better guac than this.Now, on to the tacos. I enjoyed the cochinita more than the pozole. Both were decently tasty, but nothing was amazing and all that memorable.Overall, our service was great. Food came out very fast, waters were refilled, and our server was delightful. However, think there are better gourmet taco places around."], ["Maria R.", "Good, but not great. Tacos are good, homemade tortillas always a plus. Customer service a hit or miss depending who you get. Party of 3 had to wait to be seated until 3rd person got there, it was not busy yet. We sat at the bar to wait and ordered margaritas and guac. Upon my friend asking if the guac could get more hot pepper in it, the bartender informed us he could not, as it was batch made. Ok, sure. 5 minutes after delivering guac he returned asking if we wanted sliced peppers on the side... not sure why this wasnt offered as an option in the first place. When our 3rd person arrived, we informed the host and he said it would be a 20 minute wait, which seemed steep considering we had been there 20 minutes prior and were already on list. Server was great, and food was good. Definite points for having street elotes! that probably made my night. Churro donuts, not so great...they were essentially dunking donuts sugar munchkins haha."], ["Julie T.", "My rating is on overall experience with taste and service. Food is 4/5 just because the flavors are really unique and tasty. I never ever complain about having too much meat but taco joint really put too much meat in my taco for such a small tortilla! Had the time Tuesday which offers 3 tacos for $7. Pretty great deal for al pastor, barbacoa, & cochinita (chicken, beef & pull pork). All three tacos had its own unique taste which was great. The chicken taco stand out the most because it had a sweet tangy pineapple mix into it. We also tried some street food like the corn and it was amazing! We also had guacamole which was not traditional and I wish we got the traditional but our waiter recommend the other one and I was not a fan. The chips that we use to dip was very unique. At first it was a hard acquire taste but you get use to it. \u00a0Service however was more like 3/5. The food came out really quickly which was good because we were so hungry. But we weren't too fond with our waiter. We overheard a conversation that made us really uncomfortable. A customer was asking for condiments like hot sauces and etc and the response he gave to the other guest was not really polite. He basically tried to convince the guest to not use any additional sauces with the taco because the spices were seasoned to 'perfection' but everyone's taste bud is different so he had no right to make that decision for them and in the end, they didn't even get any sauces. I mean I would come back because the food is really amazing but their customer service might need more work!"], ["Abbey K.", "The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because I think the food is a little over priced. The tacos were great, and the service was EXCELLENT. We also tried some of the guacs - it was nice that they had a variety. Great for a lunch - or casual dinner."], ["Richard K.", "Tacos were great. They have a bar with a nice cozy environment. \u00a0Cost per taco averages about $3.50. It's worth it.

Four stars only because I haven't tried the entire menu yet."], ["Brian K.", "Taking two stars off for a couple reasons. 1. Every time I go, they're packed (with good reason), and I have to sit at one of those awkward, inconveniently located side tables. So uncomfortable, too much traffic.2. They removed the michelada taco from the menu. I understand the menu is seasonal, which is great, but don't remove your best seller and replace it with an inferior version. Again, I love this place and will definitely continue to dine here."], ["Patoja R.", "Had a girls night out here and it was a winner. We spent a few hours here drinking, catching up and eating. We all enjoy everything we ordered. From apps to different tacos and drinks you'll be very pleased. Service was good.

When we finally got our table everything just keep getting better."], ["Bao L.", "Taco Joint's unassuming name doesn't do it justice - they really should consider changing their name to 'The Best Damn Tacos in Chicago', or something similar to that. These are the dankest tacos in Chicago by far.My friends and I went here for dinner on a Friday night and we were starving. It was crowded, but we somehow managed to get seated at the last open table of 4 (the food gods obviously had our backs that night). We sat down, quickly perused the menu, and ordered our food and drinks (the Paloma Negra is on point btw). We ordered:-Rojo guacamole: pretty good. It was on the creamier side with nice big chunks of avocado for some added texture. It comes w/ tortilla chips and plantain chips, so be sure to try em both w/ the guac (I love salty things, so I prefer the tortilla chips)-Queso fundido: amazing. We ordered it w/ the chorizo instead of the grilled corn. The queso was heavenly and had the right amount of gooey-ness, and the chorizo was perfectly seasoned. -Carnitas taco: SO GOOD. The carnitas was tender, seasoned beautifully, and had a perfect amount of crispy/charred pieces to give you some texture w/ each bite. The tomatillo salsa topped it off great. Note: eat this taco at the end because the adage \"save the best for last\" definitely applies here! I did not heed my friend's advice and ate this taco first - which lead to me ordering another one immediately after I demolished this one, and before I even touched my other 3 tacos...whoops-Cracklin' duck tinga taco: there is so much going on in this taco (just look at all the ingredients!), but that's what makes it so good. The duck was tasty and the slaw and pieces of chicharr\u00f3n added a great crunch-Steak jalisco taco: another huge taco that was delicious. The sirloin was grilled to perfection, and any time you give me chunks of avocado you're doing great in my book. The chili was a nice touch - I think this was the first time I've ever had beans in a taco, and they were a surprisingly welcome ingredient.-Camaron taco: the taco of the day. 5 huge pieces of buttery shrimp goodness. I wish this was offered every day because this would definitely be one of the tacos I would get every time I come in to eat.My friends also got the barbacoa, al pastor, and cochinita tacos. I didn't get a chance to try them but they all said that their tacos were amazing as well.Service was excellent - everyone from the hostess to our waitress to the busboy was polite and kind. I'm definitely coming back here multiple times so that I can try every Taco Del Dia; Tongue 'N Cheek taco, I'm comin' for ya"], ["Irene H.", "I think I've become a taco snob. \u00a0I tried 4 different tacos here, the guacamole, and the queso fundido and I thought everything was just ok. \u00a0The tacos were pretty standard and I was hoping they would be more flavorful. \u00a0I was excited about one of the unique taco flavors - the Sweet Corn and Truffle - but it turned out to be my least favorite. \u00a0The service here was great but I was unfortunately not blown away by the food."], ["Yvonne B.", "Taco Joint is definitely a victim of it's hip location combined with it's own success. It's freakin' noisy and crowded!I walked in and was immediately confronted with a wall of bodies and noise after struggling to find parking. It's dark and looks like a bar and ONLY a bar. Nothing about my first impression indicated that it could possibly be a restaurant and serve tacos.We used the app to track the readiness of our table while we enjoyed an adult beverage at the bar next door. It took a solid half hour for a \"table\" along the hallway wall with the kitchen door swinging and breezing our backsides. Waiting guests leaned along the edge of our table and didn't move when we were seated. It was absolutely shameful.The alacrity of our server, our sweetly refreshing house margaritas and scrumptious tacos redeemed Taco Joint. The Taco Joint Margarita was served in a tall, skinny glass with an option of either being on the rocks or frozen. We chose rocks. It had less lime and more agave than other places; however, it went down easily.These were our tacos:Conchinita - the server's favorite. The shredded pork has some flavorful heat that is immediately cooled and complimented by the slaw on top.Al Pastor - probably my all-time favorite chicken taco but not my favorite taco at Taco Joint.Steak Jalisco - Delicious and well balanced. A little hard to eat because it had so many components that could fall off. This was very different and FAR superior to the version at their Ontario location.Crackin' Duck Tinga - MY FAVORITE. It was crispy, flavorful, and rich. I loved it. I loved it as duck oils seeped out of it.Camaron (Taco del Dia) - M had this one and she kept it all for herself. I can only report that she would not share.These tacos were really delicious. All of them had interesting flavor combinations, good textures, and quality ingredients. They were well-balanced and distinctly different from one another.Even though Taco Joint was slammed our server didn't rush us to pay or leave. He allowed us to sit while we conversed and M nursed her second margarita. We genuinely appreciated him and he admitted that serving is one of his callings. We agreed!"], ["Angel L.", "Unbelievable place!!! Best tacos in town and the margaritas are the bomb! Left this place full and buzzed.

Small joint but cool and casual, we didnt notice the tables at the restaurant but fortunately they had tables towards the back of the rst we asked to be seated there instead of the stools we felt sandwhiched in between the isle and the small table. But all in all a nice place to have a good taco and a drink. :)"], ["Diana S.", "I returned to Taco joint only to find out that my favorite appetizer have been modified. They are the flautas . They would bring them to you in a bowel with a delicious salsa sauce on the bottom and they were made out of chicken. The new appetizer is made out of beef in a platter. It ia Not as tasty as before and extremely dry. What happened to the sauce/salsa that it used to come with it?Other than that, \u00a0eating gourmet tacos for 3 to 4 dollars each it's still pretty good. It would be so awesome if they brought back the previous flautas appetizer."], ["Tracy Y.", "I don't know why I never ate at Taco Joint until this past winter. \u00a0I am so glad I met my friend here on a really snowy night. It's become a regular place to go when we want tacos or margaritas. My most recent visit was last weekend when I had a friend visiting. The restaurant is fairly small so get there early or prepare to wait. The margaritas are good! Lots of flavors to choose from. I think we've tried almost all the tacos. They have a daily special taco too. Last weekend we tried their guac of the day which was mango based. I love all things mango! Service is great too!"], ["Jose B.", "I have to give this place some credit.The tacos were good. Must order the habanero sauce with them.The service unfortunately could use some work.

These are, MUST-try-yourself tacos! Definitely worth $3-4 dollars each. They each had the most appropriate toppings and the tortilla itself was delightful. We had the guacamole del dia (of the day, ;)) which had pineapple, papaya and special kick. Worth every penny. Last but not least, we ordered Chile Mango Margaritas, which did not disappoint. The jalape\u00f1o added an extra punch of flavor. This Mexican approves this joint!"], ["Aimee C.", "I can't stress enough how much I love tacos. Essentially, they're my favorite food group! Having been raised in SoCal, where my palette indulged in bountiful and authentic tacos and taco trucks alike, I am pleased to report that Taco Joint houses the BEST TACOS IN CHICAGO!My friends and I recently came here on Cinco de Mayo to indulge in some good ole' tacs and margs. For drinks, my friend and I settled on a pitcher of the Fruit Margarita: pineapple-blood orange, while another friend ordered the Pina Colada. The pineapple-blood orange Fruit Margarita was recommended by our server and was quite refreshing. As the name suggests, it was on the sweeter side and the fruit flavors were so heavy, you could barely detect any hint of Tequila (which, for me, could make for a very interesting evening lol). I tried a few sips of my friend's Pina Colada, and boy was that tasty! I normally don't gravitate to coconut flavors in my mixed drinks, so I don't have many others to compare it to, but this Pina Colada was delicious! I just wish they offered it in pitcher form. We started with the Tradicional Chips & Guac. Refreshing with a very subtle kick of spice. It's served with corn tortilla, malanga (taro root), and plantain chips. I appreciate the variety of chips they offered, since each had a very distinct flavor profile that complemented the guacamole nicely.\u00a0\u00a0For tacos, I ordered the Carnitas, Ceviche, and Aguacate (Tuesday's special). Started with the Carnitas taco, which was simply melt in your mouth deliciousness, with a very rich pork flavor. By far, my favorite taco at this place! Next came the Ceviche taco, which was a light and refreshing follow-up after the Carnitas. This particular taco is served on a hard shell, which tends to fall apart with that first bite. So be sure to scoop up those bits of dropped shrimp and avocado with your fork (Or is that just me and my fat kid tendencies?). Rounded out the trifecta with the Aguacate, which you can't go wrong with when you have beer battered avocado, black bean salsa, crema, and pico de gallo in every bite. The customer service never disappoints, from always making sure you are eating to your heart's content to consistently refilling your water glasses. The downside is that this place doesn't take reservations and unless you go at odd hours, expect to wait, since seating is fairly limited. The silver lining is that they have a bar near the entrance to bide your time and your thirst.\u00a0\u00a0I am definitely coming back here for my next taco fix!"], ["Sean J.", "These tacos are the bomb!.. 2nd time here, my favorites are the al pastor and barbacoa.Also try the strawberry water it's delicious!!!"], ["Danica J.", "If there's one thing I've learned from my time living in Arizona, it's that I've become a taco and burrito snob. On one hand, it sucks because sometimes super cheap tacos from some random place just don't cut it. On the other hand, it forces me to seek out good taco spots I wouldn't have hit up otherwise.I wound up getting the mole and fish tacos, which were both excellent. Honestly, their mole sauce is some of the best I've had since I left Phoenix, which definitely means I'll be coming back in the future, but for me the stand out was the traditional red michelada. Modelo is not my cerveza of choice, but it definitely shines in their take on the classic Mexican cocktail. And then there's that rim and their mix, which are both this perfect balance of savory and a little bit of spice to keep it interesting.Taco Joint is one of those places that's worth venturing out of the neighborhood for. While it doesn't quite remind me of the Mexican food I left behind in Arizona, it's a good twist on it that makes for an excellent meal."], ["Morganne B.", "Great tacos here... Beats out Big Star any day. Chicken is very dry though. Can't go wrong with barbacoa and fish. The rojo guacamole was great--huge chunks of avocado--and got devoured before I could get a pic. I wish it would have been spicier though. I mean, you're a Mexican restaurant after all. The chips that come with it aren't your average tortilla chips. There are some plantain and veggie chips thrown in there as well and they were probably my favorite part of the whole meal. Margaritas are pretty strong, but overpriced. At least they salt the glass. Is it just me or are places doing that less and less lately? Bring on the hypertension. Service is hit or miss so just get drunk before you come so you aren't waiting too long on your drinks. To be fair, we were a large obnoxious group so thanks to the staff at taco joint for putting up with us."], ["Neha S.", "Most delicious tacos I have ever had! All their tacos are absolutely amazing!

They have authentic tacos, and also creative recipes which makes this spot stand out from all of the other tacos restaurants.The types of tacos that they have are very street type from Mexico, a little on the smaller side as you would see in Mexico, but that's ok, because they have other items that you can choose from to taste such as tortas, elotes, guacamole and chips. The guacamole and chips are interesting as they give you a mix of chips that include plantains. That's not very Mexican more Caribbean, but it is the creativity that I appreciate.You can get 3 types of guacamole which is great! You can get traditional, a spicy type or the guac of the day. We where seated quickly, our server was attentive. It was a very good experience!"], ["Craig R.", "What a tasty little Taco Joint! Pun intended.I went here on a Tuesday for the 2 dollar tacos and was not disappointed. I highly recommend the Barbacoa taco, delicious!

The Cochinta (pulled pork and habenero), Barbacoa (braised beef) and Carnitas (pork shoulder) were absolutely delicious.

Our favorite was the barbacoa, which had a nice soft texture and lightly spiced and marinated flavor. We also had the estilo baja. It had a buttermilk flavor and the fish was soft. The rajas was creamy and a good vegetarian option. The steak jalisco was also pretty good but I wouldn't choose it over the barbacoa. I would also recommend the vegetable escabeche on the side. It wasn't exactly what I had in mind, more oiled than pickled, but the peppers were a nice complement to our meal.Not to mention fantastic service.

Pretty close to the Red line and the 8 bus stops rights in front of it. I went on a Wednesday night and it was busy, but got seated in about 10 minutes. The service was fast and our waiter was very friendly. The margaritas are really good and pretty good size. I got the classic on the rocks and would highly suggest.The taco are really good. I got the two vegetarian ones (corn and soy chorizo) while my boyfriend got pork, chicken and a fish one. We shared the rojo guacamole which was a good size for two to three people as a starter. All in all this is a super good Mexican joint for a casual but delicious dinner or would be a great place to stop for drinks and appetizers."], ["William B.", "Definitely in the \"hipster taco\" category rather than the \"Mexican taco\" category, and unlike California's Tacolicious, I can't say they pull it off. \u00a0Nothing was bad, and the service was nice, but . . . Chipotle is better. \u00a0Henceforth let's use the \"Chipotle test\" as a baseline for taco places in Chicago. \u00a0It's a reasonably high bar, since Chopotle is tasty, but there's a Chipotle near my office and my house, so if it can't beat that bar, I don't need it in my life."], ["Olivia M.", "I went here based off a recommendation from a coworker and wasn't disappointed. I tried the sirloin Monday special taco (my favorite), chicken al pastor, tilapia (also delicious), duck, and carnitas, plus the guacamole. \u00a0Everything was consistently tasty across the board but I do wish they included some salsa/chips and was disappointed with some of the toppings on the tacos. The chicken al pastor taco was disappointing in the sense that it had a very, very small piece of pineapple on it. My server was also extremely busy flying around so I never had the chance to ask for a side of limes - but she was very friendly and happily answered all questions. Also, the seating is kind of strange here. When you walk in there's a pretty cramped bar as well as some bar seating that faces a wall and all the table tops are in the back. The tables are close together - not really great for a first date or an intimate conversation. Just a heads up!"], ["Conny H.", "The tacos here were pretty good! I tried the fish taco, duck taco, and ceviche taco. The fish was tasty but nothing spectacular. The ceviche taco came in a taro shell which was very unique! The shell is hard so it was a bit difficult to eat since it fell apart pretty easily. The flavors were great though! My favorite was the duck taco. The meat was tender and juicy! The cracklings inside added great texture as well. We also tried their guac of the day which had watermelon in it. Sounded funky but somehow it worked? Overall, not a bad place to try out some unique flavors!"], ["Lisa N.", "This place is really good! I've been three times and I love all the tacos I've tried so far. The only reason I'm giving them a 4 is because I tried the queso fresco and it made me feel really sick afterwards."], ["Morgan Richelle M.", "Probably the best Mexican Food in Chicago. My mom and I dropped in as it was a restaurant she had been dying to show me (I was visiting from San Francisco). We were in on a weekday afternoon, so we didn't have any wait and were seated right away. The interior has an authentic and festive vibe. It's super clean, staff is friendly, and the service is speedy!Our waiter was a sweetheart. We ordered a pretty light mid-afternoon \"snack\" which was the Queso Fundido (Queso Chihuahua, queso fresco, & roasted poblano peppers). I could see why she was so in love with this place! The Queso Fundido (comes with 4 tortillas) is heavenly! That cheese is delicious- I could have eaten all four of the tortillas, but instead we shared them and ordered a side of chips and salsa. It was wonderful!"], ["Brandon W.", "Dayumn! Great Americanized tacos. Great cocktails. Chilled out hip atmosphere. The only problem I've had on more than one occasion was the food wasn't very hot. \u00a0I mean, \u00a0it wasn't cold but I'm sure the tacos would be even better if they were straight off the grill. Oh well, \u00a0I can overlook it. Highly recommended."], ["Michael B.", "As it is near my house, I eat here way too often, but it never lets me down. Almost all the tacos I've had here are great, especially the cochinita, which has a nice spice to it. I've also had the guac, elotes and queso fundido, which are great as well. The only complaint is I feel they could give you a bigger portion of guac.Normally it's pretty packed inside, but if you do takeout, it only takes 10-15 min. So go grab a drink at Marquee next door while you wait!"], ["Tish S.", "Tacos were really good, I got 4 buffalo, 1 rotisserie and 1 shrimp and grits. All were tasty.... Total was 35bucks."]]}
