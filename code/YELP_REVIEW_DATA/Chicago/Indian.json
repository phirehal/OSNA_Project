But I feel I needed to write this to forewarn people before they go to this place. Many Chicagoans and foreigners might like the food but what they are liking is the idea of Indian food which in it's essence is spectacular. However the execution of the idea by this restaurant has been appalling. If this food was an ambassador of India then people out here have been fed lies since it's inception. We tried 3 appetizers and one dessert. Let me begin with the Paneer Tikka (Cottage cheese). We paid $18 for something that tasted like an eraser, we could have got a cheaper one at staples. Paneer is supposed to be soft and melt in your mouth. The Chandni Chowk Aloo Tikki sounds and looks great in theory however in practice it was a mash of bullshit. The pattie was terrible and lazily prepared. The samosas were mediocre at best, however no where close to how it is supposed to be. I forgot about the poppadum, it was not fully cooked and had corners which were raw not roasted. However the cook was more generous with the Gulab Jamun (dessert.) Probably too generous because he burnt the dish. And the server had the audacity to bring the burnt dish to our table and \u00a0 place it there in a nonchalant manner.The service was alright. The only reason I gave this place one star is because the Bollywood music is good, but the melodious tunes only mask the disservice that the people in this place are doing to Indian food."], ["Norm J.", "My friend and I went here for the lunch buffet on a Saturday afternoon and the place was empty (so glad I made that reservation).

When I finally got to my room to reveal my vegetable korma that I had been craving I found what looked like veggies from my grocer's freezer in a bright yellow sauce. Having had korma in many cities and on many occasions, I would venture to say this wasn't korma. I went to try it and realized I had no utensils or napkins which was enough for me to call back. Come on. I'm in a hotel, not a home and the rooms don't come with kitchen utensils. The order I made for almost $40 was not found in their system for some time and then the manager got on the line. He really did try to fix things, bless his heart. He sent the delivery woman back to my hotel and I met her downstairs after getting out of my pj's for the second time (I guess I could have gone Walmart style and worn them downstairs). This time she brought a napkin, a plate, and a fork. She was very kind and apologetic. I thanked her and asked to forward my thanks to the manager as well. I still didn't get korma but rather a tomato-like dish. By the time I had utensils (they did beat room service!) my basmati rice and naan were cold and the experience was pretty much unrepairable.

We had another 10 minutes to decide, and when he came back to take our order and we both started to list our choices off the menu, only then did he tell us that it would be more cost-effective and still an absurd amount of food if we ordered one restaurant week meal and one appetizer or entree on the side. Granted, that was a good piece of advice, but why did we waste 25 minutes getting to that point?I love Indian food, and I loved the baigam bartha (spelling? probably way off) with the rice and the naan, but the chicken in the other dish we ordered did not even come close to par. It felt slimy but overcooked, if that's possible. There really was so much food that when the dessert menu came out, I didn't even want to think about any other food. Granted, it was good, but I was just sooo full. I felt like the servers were trying to get us to leave as the night wound down.

I ordered the seekh kabab masala and chicken khadai. I was intrigued by the seekh kabab dish as it is typically served as just a plain kabab to be accompanied with naan and not in a curry. After ordering and having both dishes delivered I soon found out why this dish should be served alone. The curry prepared for both the seekh kabab and the chicken khadai were the exact same! I know quite a bit about Pakistani food and Indian food and I can tell you that that's not right. In addition, you should never have a curry that has onions that are simmered in the sauce that are still crunchy. Onions are typically cooked in curries to enhance flavor but this was overwhelming! There were huge chunks of onion almost salsa like cut onions in what should have been a traditional Indian curry. The only highlight to the meal was that the kababs within the curry were prepared well and flavorful. Still, the purpose of ordering different dishes from a menu is that they taste unlike one another and are fresh. I definitely cannot say that this restaurant was able to do this. What's more, the $48 price tag on the dishes with one naan is too much to spend and should be reserved for more properly prepared Indian dishes, such as the ones that can be found on Devon.

Ignore the humble decor, anyone serious about food knows that is the least important factor when determining a notable restaurant. We ordered the butter chicken, chili chicken, four pieces of beef kabab (not sure how it's listed on the menu but it wasn't the plate), biryani rice, some aloo samosa, and naan. My only complaint is the kababs were dry but WOW everything else was outstanding! The naan was so warm and fluffy, perfect for dipping into the butter chicken's sauce. The chili chicken reminded us of this house-made jerky my brother finds in NY Chinatown, and that is a huge compliment if you knew the fresh and tender jerky I am talking about. As if it wasn't enough to serve incredible food, they are open 24/7 and everything is under $5. What a steal.

For $16, the two of us ate until we were about to pop our jeans open, I had lunch for two days, he brought home lunch for his roommate, and I sneaked in another dinner out of the food. We ordered Aloo paneer (spinach), chili chicken (red), green chili chicken, and two parathas. So much food.

The most recent visit was about a month or so ago. It was as good as I remember. For 3 chicken biriyanis (1 spicy), 3 pops, and 2 pieces of naan it was like $20 or less.

I do still wish they had other kinds of naan. I like this place because it is cheap and they give you a lot of food. They also have a prayer room in the back so their customers who need to pray. I would suggest you grab your food head home and eat there because it can get loud and very busy. Also I like eating Indian food and watching Parks and Recreation. Great food, cheap.

We ate at an Indian restaurant in Bali that burned us but in a good way and we were now seeking that kind of heat in Chicago.Chicago has a great corridor of authentic Indian restaurants on Devon Ave. The problem is deciding which one to go to. My wife and I ended up here. \u00a0I am so happy we did!When we walked in my wife wanted to carry our food out. \u00a0I totally understood why because this place looked aged. \u00a0In fact, it looks a little scary but I was not going to let the appearance change my mind. I wanted authentic. I did not want a fancy white table cloth place.The lady at the front counter was really nice and patient with us. There is a giant board of food with names and pictures. I realized that the board has the same dish but served three different ways. 1) You can get it as a build your own sandwich. Served on a fancy metal prison tray. That scared my wife but I thought it looked cool. 2) You can get a giant bowl of it. And add on 2 bread or one rice for a $1.3) You can get it all mixed with rice.Once I realized the dishes then the giant menu board seemed to get smaller to me. I was not really looking for what to order but how I wanted to eat it. Since we were going family style we went for option #2. On a side note, I made up the 1-2-3 ordering process so do not walk in here expecting to see that. You are going to have to still point at the board and pick your dish.We decided to go with Butter Chicken and Chili Chicken. Both were amazing. We also added on one plate of rice and 2 bread. We asked for the Naan but were told that they were out of it. We then asked the lady behind the counter what her favorite was and she said the Paratha. Guess what? That is our new favorite now. I will never ever want Naan again. The dishes also came with a bowl of sour cream and raw white onions. We were using the Paratha and making our own sandwiches. It was so messy with delicious juices running down our hands. If this could be food porn, then it was. Every bite was better then the next.The butter chicken was so yummy. We came home and started looking up recipes. Yes we are going to try this at home one day soon. The sauce for the butter chicken was just decadent. I wanted a spoon to start eating it like soup.The chili chicken was fantastic. I pointed out to my wife that the spices in this dish were similar to the Colonel's Secret Recipe for Original Chicken at KFC. She agreed and is forcing me to mention this in a review. Now I must be honest I haven't had KFC in over 10 years but those original spices stick with you. I am now thinking the Colonel went to Indian and stole this recipe. Yes I am stating that here and for the record. I must say I mean no disrespect to the Chili Chicken here because it is 10 times better then any fasts food chicken at KFC. Next time you are here I want you to think about this before you bite in and then shoot me a note if you agree or disagree.We also mixed our chickens with the rice too. So we had the best of all worlds. Sandwiches and rice bowls plus some samosas on the side. This was a feast for lunch.Our quick lunch excursion took us 2.5 hours roundtrip back to downtown Chicago. Here is the sad thing. As I was driving down Roosevelt Road at Halsted I noticed they had a second location at UIC. What? We could have been here in 5 minutes. I am not reviewing that location yet. That will be for another time. But this is a much cleaner version of the original. Personally I think you have to go to the original to experience it all.On a funny note my wife thought we ate at a different restaurant on Devon. She had a fancy place all marked. So when we walked in here she was in total shock because the photos of the place did not even match. I did not find that out until a week later. We had such a funny laugh when we realized we might have eaten at the wrong place but I love food stories like that because it seems more interesting. Plus it makes for a great story!If your looking for delicious Indian food that isn't going to cost you a lot of money then this is your place. I highly recommend the Butter Chicken and the Chili Chicken. All dishes are under $4.99 and you can add rice or 2 bread for only a $1. Samosas were only .50 cents and came in beef or potato. Go potato! I really did not care for the beef. Our whole lunch was $14 and we even had leftovers to bring home. We are so happy we found this place. It is open 24/7. The interior is not very fancy, so don't expect very much. But I promise you the food is amazing."], ["Carlos T.", "Its a ok place. The price for the food is not bad.

This food in this place is absolutely amazing and their prices are even better. We ordered the Chili Chicken, Butter Chicken (so delicious), rice, 2 naan breads and 2 cans of pop for $16. The chili Chicken was very good, a few of the pieces were cold but the line was way too long and I was way too hungry to wait for another one. Then I tasted the Butter Chicken, WOW, mind blown! That was by far my favorite dish and I will be ordering it every time I go from now on. Their Naan bread was warm, soft and very fresh and the naan bread for me is a very big deal when it comes to Indian food. I ended up with the plain white rice which I was disappointed later cause I didn't get one of their Biryani's which looked pretty amazing but none the less it was fresh and pretty good. I can't wait to go back, I want to try everything here except the goat. Expect to wait in line to place your order but it moves pretty quick.

They apparently restock their supply of stuff at 8am, so by 3am the next day a ton of their more popular items (lamb/goat biryani, meat thali, a bunch of other meats) were already out. The $5 portions of biryani were humongous and pretty yummy! I imagine they cook the rice in giant batches and don't season them as well, because my friend's portion was significantly more bland than mine, but at least the meat was tender and flavorful. The meat:rice ratio is decent, since the chicken pieces were big. Ideally if you broke up the chicken into bite sized pieces, you'd probably get a piece of meat per bite of rice. The boneless beef is shredded and integrates pretty well into the rice.

Know your order before you get to the counter because these people are not about frills. ALSO CASH ONLY. Have cash on you.I ordered the chili chicken paratha (3.99) and a bowl of dal (1.99) and after I was done eating, I was stuffed - full out food coma stuffed. The paratha was delicious - I ripped pieces off and stuffed onion slivers and the chili chicken dipped in the yogurt sauce in the paratha, and it was a party in my mouth. The chicken was amazing. Perfectly spiced and super tender - I'd definitely come back again just for that. The dal was also really good - thick and filling with tons of spices and flavor. And I think that was the most food I've ever gotten for just six bucks in Chicago. Only gripes - no forks? That was kind of weird. Had to use a spoon for everything which was a bit annoying.

Samosa, tava veggies, Chana masala, paneer kofta, kadhi pakoda were few veggie items in the menu. For meat eaters they had fish, goat curry and chicken tikka masala. Fresh sizzling tandoori were being served for every table. Since we are no meat eaters, we opted out. Dessert menu was the best- mango ice cream and soft gulab jamoons. I started off in fact with two servings of the mango ice cream, even though it was chilly and windy outside!"], ["Joseph B.", "My favorite Indian restaurant in Chicago. \u00a0I love the salmon tandoori which we ordered very cautiously but then fell in love with. \u00a0My friends loved the kadhai chicken, the lamb roganjosh, and one of them were crazy about the Indian Manhattan which had cumin in it. \u00a0The ambience is nice and the service is very good. \u00a0You will not regret dinner at India House."], ["D W.", "I'm a big fan of good Indian food and by this place had a good rating, so...We made a reservation which was a good idea. The place was packed - always a good sign. Getting right to the food, everything was wonderful. Flavorful and very nicely prepared. The naan was as good as what I've had in India. Overall, the food was outstanding!Our waiter, however was rude and inattentive. I hope it was a bad day and not the way they do business. I'll go here again but a 3rd time will depend on the wait staff."], ["Steph F.", "My friends and I were initially going to eat at another restaurant but the wait was ridiculously long. We decided to yelp another place to go for dinner and stumbled across India House Restaurant. Yelp did not fail us and the food here was delicious. The three of us shared the following items:- samosas- Chicken makhani (butter chicken)- lamb biryani- garlic naan- Khumi naan (stuffed with garlic, ginger, and carrots)While everything was really good here, I especially liked the samosas, khumi naan, and lamb biryani. This was by far the most fancy Indian restaurant I've been to. The servers were very friendly and helpful when we had questions about certain dishes. I'd definitely recommend this place if you're in the mood for some good Indian food."], ["Srishti S.", "Best tandoori chicken I have had in the Midwest. Sizzling, succulent, juicy, well marinated (could taste the spices and marinade all the way in) and cooked perfectly to be really tender. Loved the fact that the gulab jamuns were not over the top sweet like most other places. Although I really liked the food, for the price, and from what I had heard from friends about this place, I was expecting a bigger buffet. I would like to put in a recommendation to add 'chaat' items like pani puri, sev puri and/or dahi vada for at least the weekend buffet. Overall, great authentic Indian food right in the heart of the city!"], ["Sara H.", "The service is excellent but quite serious. There was only one waiter who smiled. I had the India House Meal and it was delicious overall. The dahl was a bit bland, not great texture, no perfume but the grilled tandori chicken, lamb kabobs and fish (mahi) were awesome! The servings are generous. The meal for one was more than enough for two. I would order the two person one for four, really! And I like to eat, trust me. Wasn't the best nan I've ever had but bad nan is impossible right?The rice pudding was also delicious. Nice atmosphere too."], ["Ankur S.", "After reading the reviews for this place I expected a lot better. While the restaurant was nice and the service was good, I hate to say the food was a little overrated. While I've been to many restaurants, I can honestly say I've had better.The Aloo Tikki Chaat was not bad, but I would not recommend the Paneer Tikka Masala or the Chicken Biryani."], ["Rin C.", "Terrible service. I ordered online and waited over 2 hours to get the food. I called the restaurant multiple times and whoever answered the call had me on hold for few minutes only to cut the line. The rare times this person (always the same one) chose to speak, it was usually one line \"order is on the way only 10 minutes\". The food delivery guy said he only received the items \"10 minutes\" ago when he showed up. So not worth waiting 2 hours, food was oily, i drenched 3 tissues to get it all out, still couldn't eat it. Never again to this \"10 minutes\" food place. If only i can trade the one star on yelp i'm obligated to give for all the minutes i had to spend dealing with this place."], ["Shaheda K.", "Went to Chicago around March, and 3 out of the 4 days I was there, I ate here. 2 days we dined in for the buffet, and 1 night was take out.Coming here during buffet was perfect, because they had plenty of options for vegetarians. There's nothing really that notable I can recommend because truthfully I was just blowned away by the gulap jamon, and the potato things only... but this place was always packed, so I'm sure the non-vegetarians were enjoying their dishes. I knocked off a star cause the service there could've been better."], ["Rachael N.", "This is hands down the most chic Indian restaurant I have ever been to, regardless of the fact they dress up their non-Indian waitstaff in salwaar, which we got a good laugh about. It is also, in my opinion, one of the best in Chicago and a great option to hit up if you're in River North. Of all we ate, the naan, kulcha, and fish tikka masala were delicious. The fish (swordfish) was a little dry but the sauce was delicious. Oh, and they give you NAAN before your meal! Whaaaaaaat! We were starving after a long day of failed shopping so that was much appreciated.I have tried A LOT of saag paneers (that's my dish), and this one was just too salty for me. However, I was plenty happy eating their amazing breads and that fish curry.Final call: a very, very close second to Gaylord's up off Michigan Avenue and first place if the occasion is a first date."], ["Sharanya A.", "The prices are a bit on the steep side. \u00a0A lot of previous reviews complained about the service. We thought the service was decent - no complaints there. The food was delicious. I had the vegetarian thali while my friends had the thali with the different types of tikka masalas (chicken, lamp and shrimp) and the kadhai chicken. All of us really like our meals. The portion sizes are a little big, so if you are a light eater you'll probably have to take home about half of what you ordered."], ["Jill G.", "Out of towner + conference +broken foot = Lots of delivery to the hotel! I really wanted Indian, but was very hesitant because of others' bad experiences with the delivery here. Happy to report that everything went off without a hitch. Now, the delivery *is* expensive. There's a $5 delivery charge, plus tip. That, plus tax, took my $33 order to $50. I was very clear in the order notes that I was on crutches, in a hotel, and needed silverware/cutlery. They came through with the silverware, and packed paper plates for me too (which was much appreciated!). Delivery guy was super nice, and the order arrived in a timely manner. Food was scrumptious, and the portion size was ample. Spice levels are Mild, Medium, and Spicy. If you normally like you Indian food over a 5/10, I suggest going with Spicy. The Medium level was a little weak for me, and I typically go with a 6 or 7 out of 10 spice. All in all, great food, great delivery experience on a Monday night, but a touch expensive."], ["Ashli H.", "Raising to 3-stars due to a much improved experience a couple of weeks ago. Since Kim invited me back to dine, I took my friend to the Sunday buffet. This was actually a much better deal than their regular menu. In addition to the buffet selection, the servers bring out naan and a chicken dish. Since I'm vegetarian, they switched out the chicken for tandoori vegetables. Aside from the buffet being a good value ($17.95/pp on weekends), the service was much better which was my primary concern about returning. I'd expect better service during \"a la carte\" hours versus during the buffet, but I won't complain because it was a decent experience and our waiter was very thoughtful. Nothing particularly blew me away this time around, but I'd now consider returning again for the buffet (still won't go back during the other times due to my prior negative experiences). --------I just spoke with Kim and I will say I'm impressed with her response. It's nice to know that customer concerns are taken seriously and that they are making a concerted effort to prevent experiences like these from happening again. Kim invited me in to dine again and if the experience is more positive, then I will definitely consider raising my initial rating since the food itself is pretty tasty. Giving an extra star now just for Kim's kindness and genuine interest in knowing the details of what happened last week. ---------Never again. The service at this restaurant is absolutely abysmal. It's unfortunate because the food itself is actually not bad and offers several options for vegetarians, but I will never keep patronizing a place where the waiters are condescending and curt. The only reason I decided to try this place again after the first experience where we waited *1.5 hours* for two entrees is because they were offering 1,000 point tables on OpenTable and we wanted Indian cuisine. We arrived to the restaurant 1 minute after our scheduled 6pm reservation time and found out that the restaurant moved us to the 6:15pm slot which only was worth 100 points. Honestly, this was the least concerning subpar service we received. My friend and I came here after a busy day of work and weren't both super hungry. Given that I had been here before and was aware of the portion sizes, I suggested we split the vegetarian tasting platter and an appetizer along with some drinks. When we went to order this, the waiter told us that each entree is meant for one person, but we told him the amount of food we ordered would be well suited to our appetites. He rudely snatched away the menus to the point of giving me a paper cut from the loose page and briskly walked away. My friend and I just looked wide-eyed at each other like, \"Whaaaaat did we just walk into?!\" When the waiter appeared again 10 minutes later, we reminded him that the dish we ordered came with soup or salad but we forgot to state our preference earlier. After asking for the salad, he snapped, \"It's already coming with salad,\" and again walked away without any care to our experience. Not to mention that the rest of our service was awful since our meal came out before the appetizers and no care was given with regard to a few other minor details. It even got to the point where we were asking the waitress working other tables for water, etc., because we didn't want to deal with our waiter's attitude on what was supposed to be a nice night out.Oh, the bill still came to $28/person even though we split one appetizer, one veggie platter, and non-alcoholic drinks. I'm not sure what all his fuss was about for not ordering separate entrees. That's still not what I call \"cheap.\""], ["Nancy Z.", "I was really impressed with their food and service. They had the best okra dish (bhindi amchur) I've ever had at a restaurant...the dish is seasoned well, flavorful but not heavy. They have a dozen different varieties of nans as well. Try their ginger limeade (non-alcoholic). It is really refreshing and has a nice kick."], ["Pranitha P.", "Food: The food was fantastic. We ordered two dishes for three people - chicken vindaloo and aloo gobi. Everyone was naturally stuffed by the end because of the naan and rice paired with our entrees. Service: Quick and friendly service with intelligent staff who know about the food and what all the spices are. Environment: Great atmosphere and setting.

Service was very prompt, with drinks, naan, and tandoori chicken arriving to our table within five minutes of us being there.

However I was so craving for my mom's pakistani food and some real good biryani that you have no idea how much I was looking forward to this place after all the good reviews.YES! It was one of the few good places i liked. We got garlic butter naan, lamb chops that came with a side of soup, and some veggie. I got the lamb biryani with raita, aloo paratha and for drinks I decided to try the tamarind martini. The martini was good---I expected a little more sourness. The biryani with the Raita was absolutely delicious. My partners lamb chop was just excellent and the naan was made well. The only thing we didn't care for was the aloo paratha---too thick and not the kind I am used to (which is thin, crispy that you pull spar the two sids of bread with warm spiced herb potatoes inside)It was a lot of food...I really wanted to try their chai but \u00a0had no space for it at the end. I was too full. We took the leftovers home because too good to waste it. The service lefts to something desired a little. They were just--blah and a bit slow. I would go back. It is a little pricey than other Indian places. The drinks are overpriced here so i wouldn't get another cocktail because for $14 it wasn't that good. but food is great.

I love Indian lunch buffets like I love Chinese-American buffets, and those buffets love me because I always fill up on the cheap stuff.

Being super hungry, I was unable to choose just one dish. The India house special has a variety of food and is served with rice, naan, salad, and a desert. It is enough to feed two people and it's delicious. The rogan josh is amazing. The rice is cooked perfectly. The naan is light and satisfying. And I haven't even talked about the tasty fish tika, chicken tika, lamb kabob. I gave them a 3 only because it took an hour and 50 minutes for my food to arrive.

The dress code is casual, but every time I go in a polo I feel a bit under-dressed. \u00a0At the end of the day the price prohibits me from coming more often (they do offer deals online sometimes if you search around).Papdi chat is a great appetizer, comes with a lot of sauce, but is the best version I've had so far in Chicago. \u00a0Chicken Makhani is solid, and be sure to order Naan or rice to use with the sauce, too good to waste any. \u00a0Lamb rogan josh in a cardamom sauce didn't impress, the flavor wasn't too strong in my opinion. Chicken madras on par with makhani, perhaps better depending on how you feel about coconut. \u00a0Naan bread is all high quality, my personal favorite is the garlic variety. \u00a0Comes in pieces but fills up a basket, lots of it but also $5. \u00a0Mango lassi was really thick, and tasted strongly of mango, I thoroughly enjoyed it. \u00a0While I've not had the weekend buffet, there are lots of options and they look appealing, ask to take a look before you purchase."], ["Preet K.", "I even didn't wana give this place half star if I could. Buckle up it's going to long rant. we had lunch at this place about 8 months ago and it was there famous lunch buffet and it was am average food not that bad.

I mean is there any authentic place in illinios where you could get authentic North Indian food?First of all the guy at the counter was little rude and unpleasant as we seated like he just to take our order and get over it with it kind of an expressions ( not a big fan) the only food that was tasty was their bhel as I liked it too much I don't have the pic. I would have complained about the food but I have this fear that when you complain god knows what they would do with your food. We order tons of food for two but it was unappetizing.

Than there was this flavourless daal makhni and very expensive salmon but hopelessly dry.

They bring you unlimited naan and tandoori chicken. Don't be a fool and eat a bunch of rice like I did - save room for some samosas that you can a bunch of different sauces over. They also had mango ice cream and rice pudding as desserts included in the buffet - definitely get both.Also, they have cheap valet parking (which I didn't know about and thus wasted a bunch of money parking elsewhere), so take advantage of that.I would give this place 4.5 stars if I could, but alas, that is not an option."], ["Dave B.", "Wow.

I've reviewed a bunch on here from Austin, my current home... but nothing really compares to the food and feel of India House.India House's buffet never disappoints... and the magic of the whole thing is that it's not always 100% great... but the shear size of it means that you're going to have a few dishes that are exceptional every time that you're there.It's a large buffet... with many vegetarian and meat dishes to choose from... and to add flair to the buffet, they put sizzling tandoori chicken on the table, which is also all-you-can-eat.. you just have to order more from your server. \u00a0The tandoori chicken is moist, spiced correctly and amazing... that is one item from the buffet that is ALWAYS on-point.The downside is the price, but it doesn't take stars off for me... you get what you pay for here. \u00a0It ends up being about $20 per person... which isn't bad if you realize how incredible it is. \u00a0People who complain about the price have probably never really been to Indian buffets or one that is as diverse as this one. \u00a0The average cost of a buffet is $8.99 - $12.99. \u00a0Above that is too much unless it's this place... below that and you're going to equally get what you pay for.Great food, great venue, nice servers... this place is spot on. \u00a0Don't be turned off by the price... take my advice seriously... it doesn't get better in America for Indian Buffets than India House."], ["Austin Y.", "I've only ever been to India House for their lunch buffet, so this review is just for that option. The inside is sleek and modern, not what you'd expect for your typical Indian restaurant up in Devon.Their tandoori chicken is some of the best I've ever had, and it's unlimited. It always comes searing hot on a skillet, full of spices and tandoor flavor on the outside and moist inside. Honestly, it would be worth it for me to come to India House and just get their tandoori chicken and unlimited fluffy, warm garlic naan....but of course, I usually also go for the butter chicken, fish curry (vindaloo was very good), and try a bit of whatever goat curry is available. Saag paneer and chicken hyderabadi were very heavy handed on the cream and butter. Samosas have been hit or miss, gotta get 'em when they're fresh. I do wish they offered spicier curries on the buffet line.Pass on the gulab jamun and focus on the mango kulfi for dessert. It's creamy and icy with lots of mango flavor, a refreshing way to polish off your meal after you're full of tandoori chicken and naan. The rice pudding is also very good, though a little sweet.$18 is positively astronomical for an Indian buffet, but you pay a premium for higher food quality, greater variety, ambiance, and outstanding service - and the premium is justified at India House."], ["Fab S.", "Great indian food, great location, great service.

I pretty much tried all items on the buffet and loved them all, well except for the pieces of tofu that seem to find their way in more than a few dishes. Tofu just doesn't do it for me at all. I would say this though, India House had some of the best curry goat I've ever had, so spicy and full of flavor! yummmm!

My kulfi dessert was also served in a bowl which which was very difficult to eat in due to the kulfi being very hard. There is one seat at the bar which seemed to have a computer which was weird.

It was spectacular with the sauces they brought. We also had Tawa Paneer which was cheese in a sauce. Again hard to describe but tasty. I forgot the pita type bread with the tomato spicy sauce at the beginning. For entrees we had shrimp curry, cuts of salmon and shrimp masala. Each could have been shared so we'll have leftovers.

The service was good; attentive 90 percent of the time. I will state that we had a couple of instances where one of our waters was empty. Another thing I will sate is that the price for the Channa Masala I ordered was $14.95. It came with no sides or anything else. The naan I like to have with my dinner cost me another $5. It was also \u00a0the exact same amount that I receive from a BYBO Indian restaurant I frequent, that costs me $10.99. That cost includes either rice or naan. Its hard to justify 9 extra dollars just for ambiance and location. Just saying. The other thing I want to mention about my meal is that it was extremely oily. After dishing some from the serving bowl to my dish, the oil separated to about 1/4th inch on top. The things I liked were that my garlic naan was perfect texture and plentiful with garlic. However, it was quite buttery as well. The spice was spot on when I asked for a bit in between medium and hot in my masala. I was pleased that they know how to make a proper dirty martini and that their wine selection extensive. I really enjoyed the new age style and cleanliness of the restaurant as well."], ["Evetty S.", "AMAZING! Randomly decided on Indian food - went to Yelp and it was a great choice!

Order total came out to $60 which is pricey for two and for a casual eatery by all means. The gravy in the chicken was sub-standard and the chicken was not tender at all.

Spotless silver chaffing dishes were lined up neatly to offer a variety of warm vegetable options and what seemed to be an impressive array of meaty goodies. The lunch buffet featured 3 areas: Salad bar, main courses/sides, and dessert. The salad bar was surprisingly tiny, which is a disappointment if you're yearning to take a healthier route. There were also no tofu options or sweet potato anything..anywhere that day. I realize that sweet potatoes clearly divide us as a people into two specific camps: The Lovers and The Utterly Repulsed. \u00a0There never seems to be a middle ground with them for people...sort of like Mopars. But, I digress. While flavorful, the dishes \u00a0lacked the heat I had been anticipating greatly. \u00a0The spiciest dish I could get my hands on was a chic pea salad that had a nice kick to it. \u00a0Even my complimentary Tandoori chicken seemed to be missing the mark in some small way. \u00a0An attentive waiter was kind enough to bring me two slightly savory sauces from the bar to smother my Naan in.

I will acknowledge that their two dessert options were both delicious, so there was indeed a sweet finish to my meal. I came armed with a Groupon.

I really enjoyed the complimentary naan and dipping sauces provided in the beginning. However, we ordered separate garlic naan and while the texture and consistency of the naan itself was good, it was lacking in garlic flavor. I had the chicken vindaloo and I loved how spicy and flavorful it was. However, my chicken was very overcooked and very dry. It was also a tad odd that they give you a small bowl of rice for the whole table, although you can ask for more. I did enjoy the small rustic pot/bowl my dish came in which was very attractive.Service was okay but quite slow at the end. Didn't see our waitress for awhile.

Unfortunately when I paid for my food I wasn't able to eat it there because there is pretty much no seating available over the lunch hour. I didn't count the number of tables but I swear this place can't seat more than 15 people without the fire department shutting them down for overcrowding.Anyway, after a cold walk back to my office I was floored at how delicious my lunch was. The lamb was cooked well and the tikka sauce was flavorful and generally not very spicy. I was disappointed with the tiny piece of naan you get with your meal there too and would have liked a little more given the size of the bowl you receive for the rice. For a place called \"Naansense\" you'd expect naan to be a big focus of each meal but apparently not.The food at Naansense is great but due to the lack of seating and the small amount of naan you're given I can't give 5 stars.

It's not like they're rude or stand off ish, but it feels like the entire staff has ADHD. If you eat at Naansense do not bother ordering pickup or delivery....If you order pickup they will not have your order ready when you get there... it just means you'll be waiting by the cash register while they make your food instead of going through the line. If you order delivery, I assume it's the same as pickup only instead the delivery person has to wait for their food, and if they're running late I can only assume you will get your food even later than expected. ( IE, today it took over an hour and a half to get 2 chicken naanwiches... got a call around an hour after the order telling us it was running behind and to apologize, they said they would add some samosas to the order to make up for it.... which they forgot. )Anyhow, to sum it up.

Only complaint about the food, is that the naan was pretty bad - hard and cardboard-like. The place is small, but the line moves pretty quickly. The staff was very well-trained, and did a good job of helping you make your choices in a quick manner.

I was glad to get there at 12:05 and just beat the rush - this place gets busy! \u00a0I liked also that they had infused water and self-serve cups while you wait in that line.Because it is the only place of it's kind that I know of (\"fast Indian\"), I have to give it the 5 stars, and look forward to it's inevitable expansion."], ["Rick F.", "I've eaten at the storefront location and the food truck in front of my building for lunch.

The taste was even more horrific. Warning: Indian food does not taste this bad. Sauces were complete garbage. It seems that they used google to look up sauce recipes.

The chicken is season well and tender, ingredients are fresh, and the makhani sauce ties everything together.Since I'm on a healthy streak I figured why not try the spiced fries. Ummmmm.....DELICIOUS! Definitely not spicy, but the flavor is far from the norm and I like the soft texture (not a fan of crunchy fries). The weird yellow dipping sauce for the fries wasn't that good, but to me anything beats ketchup so there still winning!

Thankfully, most of the tables were empty because everyone who came in took it to go besides us (this is more of a carry out place then dine in, but dine in possible). Anyways, I went in on a Tuesday night. They only had 2 workers so if it gets busy, you'll have to wait (a while). This place is very similar to chipotle, but it's wrapped with a Naan and they have some indian sauces. Besides that, it's like chipotle. They do have samosas, but they are average. My friend said the mango lassi is good, Indians love that! They have options for vegetarians and meat eaters. If you want it to be extra spicy, let them know, they'll do a good job of it!

We thought that not only would we be getting dinner but also a comfortable environment inside the restaurant to eat. Although the bowl of Chicken Tikka was good - I found it very hard to enjoy the bowl without dying in the intense heat inside the restaurant. It felt like 100 degrees inside. How do you run a restaurant without air conditioning? We ended up throwing out our bowls after eating half of it because we were unable to sustain the environment in the restaurant.

No, french fries are not usually something you would think to see on the menu at an Indian restaurant but that is just one of the many examples of Naansense's modern twist on traditional. These fries would be great on their own but when dipped in the curry sauce that comes alongside...heaven!

For my side, I had the veggie samosa which did not come with any accompaniments. The coating was thick but well fried. The interior was filled with mashed boiled potato. It was subtly spiced and chutney'ed but the potatoes were slightly raw even though the coating was well fried. I assume they were in a hurry to make a fresh batch and left the fryer on high instead of slowly frying and turning it for a more well-rounded completion.

My boyfriend never changes the spice level of his dishes and just orders his as is but his dishes often come out waaaaaaay spicier than mine?!? I'm not sure if it's a miscommunication between staff or if we just don't know how to order... It would be nice to get exactly what I want, which definitely leads me to rate this place with only 3 stars! We are obviously returning customers but knowing that my dishes never come out the way I order them is pretty disappointing! The appeal of this specific Indian Restaurant is that it's in our neighborhood, it's convenient. They make it hard to love this place, I don't know why I come back for disappointments.Again, we have been coming in for dinner for some time now and every one of our visits the place is TOTALLY DEAD?! Seriously, every time, we are always the only ones dining in... I'm not entirely sure how I feel about that or what to make of it. The restaurant offers a lunch buffet, which leads me to believe most of their customers are more inclined to take advantage of that and maybe the option of delivery. I could be missing something...Before I write this place off I feel like I should check out their lunch buffet."], ["Rachel B.", "I don't know what's been going on here, but my last few takeout orders have just been disappointing!Not sure why this place refuses to vary their spice level per order, but no matter how many times I request \"mild,\" my entree always varies between medium and oh-my-God-save-me. But that's nothing new- you just suck it up and deal be aside the food is good. Or was good...First, get it together with the naan. How hard is it to bake flatbread properly? Last night, my naan was burnt on one end and raw on the other. The time I ordered before, \u00a0I got onion naan when I ordered lamb. Then time before that, my plain naan was so scorched on the bottom/middle that's couldn't eat it.Aside from the total disregard for spice level, the quality and quantity of the entrees has diminished. I had 5 lousy pieces of chicken in my tikka masala last night. Time before that, my container was filled about an inch from the top- major deviation from the norm. This batch was a little watery too, as if they didn't have enough left in the pot for a full order and were trying to make it work.For $10-15 an entree and $3.50 for a slice of bread, step it up and stop skimping. In talking to you owners! Competition on the Indian food market is fierce and I want to see you survive- you have such potential!"], ["Maud K.", "This was pretty good Indian food, and in convenient walking distance from Union Station. \u00a0The staff was friendly. \u00a0The buffet was a bit expensive at around 13 bucks. The food was nicely spicy, and there were lots of different dishes to choose from, including five vegetarian options. \u00a0I have celiac disease, and was able to eat most things on the buffet safely, with the usual exceptions of naan and gulab jamun. \u00a0The only reason I didn't give it a higher rating is that all of the dishes tasted very similar, like the same combination of spices and flavors was used for every dish."], ["Hinna S.", "I went here today with absolutely no expectations. I haven't tried many Indian restaurants in Chicago however this was a delightful surprise. The customer service was great and the food was superb.

Pretty much, the only thing I know is that you point at a dish and some spicy, molten hot liquid comes out with chicken in it and I will most likely suffer indigestion and/or diarrhea for some time. This is no exception.I got the something vindalu and my wife got the tiki whatever. I liked her tiki whatever better, although my something vindalu had well cooked chicken. Both were good. Indian rice sucks. It's not the restaurant's fault that I like sticky white rice. The service was great and they always came over to ask if we were okay.Well, there you have it. I tried Indian food.

The vegetarian options on the buffet were good, like they had saag, daal makhani, paneer mattar, gobhi, and bharta. I think those were all of them. The food was OK - I mean I really only enjoyed the daal makhani. The rest were average.In terms of appetizers, I thought the selection was a bit on the weaker side - all they had were these mini-samosas; which were OK, but I just expected a couple of options for a $13 buffet.Lastly... the dessert... they had gulab jamun, pista kulfi, and kheer. I went with a taste of the kulfi and kheer. Interesting, because the sweetness levels were VERY different. I probably should've eaten the kheer first, because it was not very sweet - well, relative to the kulfi. The kulfi tasted good, but it was kind of icy, which means it wasn't prepared correctly. Neither kulfi nor ice cream is supposed to be icy.It takes me quite a bit of coaxing to have an Indian buffet, because I eat the food often enough and secondly restaurant Indian food is super heavy; creamy, oily, etc. So it has to have been an excellent experience to win my vote."], ["Laurie W.", "I love me some Indian food, and this was the perfect dining experience for my husband and I.

My favorite is the sagg paneer. The chicken is not fatty which can be challenging sometime at Indian restaurants...between tikka masala and butter chicken, I say live it up with the butter chicken. The food is spicy yet has a ton of flavor which is what makes it good. What is surprisingly not good is the naan. I keep ordering to soak up the delicious sauce but it's too thick. Also the dal soup isn't memorable. Anyways, it's my go to spot because honesty I think it's just as good if not better than Jaipur for a fraction of the price."], ["Laura Kathryn S.", "Stopped in because it was raining and I didn't want to walk all the way to the grocery store.

This is because of the fact that the food is tasty enough, the staff are cordial enough to even adjust your order based on the quantity you will end up getting if you order in excess.Lastly, this is a place where you can be vocal and literally sing your heart out, for they seem to enjoy the fact that people are enjoying their time here.

There was samosa, plain rice, chicken biryani, palak paneer, mutton korma, chicken tikka, daal makhani, a sabzi salan, and I think the last thing was aloo gobi.I liked everything I tried.

Why? Because the lunch buffet is 4 stars--all your favorite dishes, pretty well prepared, lots of choices and tasty.But dinner only rates 3 stars.

The second person said this is the way they make it here. The third apologized and promised to get me another order. She did, and when it came, it was exactly the same as the first--no stuffing of any sort. Honestly, I don't understand this, and no-one could explain it..The people who work here are nice but some of them could not speak English too well.I also ordered a lamb dish, karahi gosht, made with tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, and \"mild spices\"--at least, that's the way the menu describes the spices, mild. Frankly it was too spicy for me--but if that's the way they season here, you just have to ask for REALLY mild. Still \u00a0someone could have told me, or asked how hot I like the food--if they spoke English.Everything is a la carte, so rice is extra--but they serve a mound that easily would serve 2-3 people.

Chicken vindaloo (spelled vindalu on this menu) was as spicy as it's supposed to be, with a decent balance between meat and potatoes. The naan was nice, although one piece was a bit undercooked. My primary complaint and the reason I've knocked off two stars is the fact that entrees come with nothing. If you're going to charge $13 for an entree, I shouldn't have to spend an extra $3 on rice. This is the only Indian place I've ever been to that didn't offer the choice of rice or naan included in the cost of an entree. Perhaps that's why the place was empty save for my friends and I. We enjoyed the food itself, but cost matters, regardless of if you consider yourself \"fine dining.\" I've been able to order a meat entree with rice AND naan for less than $14 at other establishments and the food was just as good if not better. I'll probably come back because this place is a few blocks from where I work and I like the taste overall, but I hope whoever is in charge deeply considers reducing prices or at least including a side with entrees."], ["Billy K.", "I freaking love this place!

No beef either.I really enjoy the goat curry, butter chicken and chicken tandoori. There's also lamb. They do vegetarian dishes incredibly well. I would say the veggie options slightly outnumber the meat in the buffet, but they're really good and have the perfect flavor combinations and spices. There's enough spice to keep it from being bland but it's on the mild side. That's great for me.

Definitely the best tandoori chicken I've ever had. Not dry and extremely flavorful.

There is also a parking lot right next to the restaurant for 2 hours for $6 or street parking.The restaurant itself is on the smaller side, but the interior is nice. There are a mixture of tables, booths and the buffet is located on the right side of the restaurant against the wall. We went with the lunch buffet, which was $11.95 and what I recommend to get a sampling of everything. For the price you pay, it's super cheap compared to many of the other Indian restaurants in Chicago and the quality of the food is amazing. Everything on the buffet was piping hot each time that I went to get another helping of food. Additionally, I always saw the staff switching out the dishes with fresh batches, which is always a plus - definitely not one of those buffet restaurants where the food has been sitting out for days.I hear that the food on the buffet rotates on a daily basis, but on the day that we came, there was:-samosas (deep fried pastries with potato and pea filling - really good!)-masala papadum (spiced Indian cracker)-dal makhani (black lentils)-sag paneer (cubes of cheese in spinach sauce)-baingan bharta (eggplant curry - one of my favs on the buffet!)-bhindi masala (okra in tomato sauce)-goat curry (had bones, but was worth it - tender and delicious)-chicken jalfrazi (chicken in a tomato/bell pepper sauce - best meat dish!)-tandoori chicken (tender and succulent!)-basmati rice (really fresh)-chicken dum biryani (basmati rice with chicken)-nan (hot and fresh - great for sopping up sauces)-ice cream (pistachio - had the consistency of shaved ice)-kheer (rice pudding)-gulab jamun (balls of milk dough that are soaked in a honey sauce)Besides these dishes located in large chaffing dishes, there is also a cold salad bar that includes items, such as mint, tamarind and mango chutney for the samosas and naan, fruits (oranges, watermelon, honey dew), raita (yogurt) and etc...Overall, Mughal had a great offering of delicious items on the buffet. This is definitely my new go-to place for Indian buffet! The service is great as well. The staff is very attentive with refilling drinks and clearing plates off the table, even when my dining buddy and I stayed for nearly 2 hours!

There were a few other Indians who came in and that was a hint that there is some authenticity to the food, indeed. Most of the patrons were American.As to the buffet, the saag paneer, chana masala, daal makhani, and mixed vegetables were worthy of being put out for the dining experience. I don't recall there being any basmati rice, but there was some yellow rice with mixed vegetables in it. That was okay, as I mostly resorted to eating buffet items that I could eat with naan instead of with rice.While my colleagues described the restaurant as a place where the cab drivers love to frequent, they must do so when the sun goes down.

Basmati rice, sweet potatoes, and corn muffins are really tasty too.They also sell semi-fresh juice(pre squeezed that morning or day before), they even have incense for sale on the wall left of the registers.I've heard its not super authentic, but remember it's Indian with American & Asian flare.

The kerala fish curry was a huge disappointment: everyone gave the dish one and only one try. The paneer and daal were standard. I would recommend trying the garlic cheese naan.

The Bhel was the best dish by far. The rice puffs were crispy, indicating they had assembled the ingredients at the time of our order and not en masse ahead of time.

I don't know if the management has changed or just slacked off, but when I'm spending $90 on takeout food to feed four people, I want the restaurant to PAY ATTENTION TO THE DETAILS.They offer dishes with varying levels of spice: mild, medium and spicy. They used to actually make the dishes to your request. Now, whichever one they see first, they make all the dishes like that: all dishes I order come spicy or mild or medium. It's just pure laziness on the part of whoever is processing the orders.There is also a lack of standardization in the recipes. On occasion, the dishes have felt positively watered down. Chicken Korma is on occasion as rich and thick as I've anticipated it would be, and on other occasions, it's watery as hell. I'd be okay with some variation in execution if this were an Indian restaurant with $10 entrees. But it's not. It's a place that charges $3.99 for rice. Please get with it Jaipur.

Service was awesome and they refilled our waters and sauces without having to ask, which I loved. The only complaint, and this is from my husband because he knows the drill, is that for the cost of the dish, naan & rice should have been included. Prices were about $20 per entree and then we paid additional $5 for rice and $4 for naan.

The waiter that served us he water spilled the water all around the table and didnt even offer to change our table given that the restaurant was empty and there was still no food on the table... then, he started talking loud with the other employees in spanish. honestly, he ruined all the experience! i would give 5 stars to this restaurant, bc the food is amazing and the environment is cool but i really think that you should pick better your employees..."], ["Saurabh P.", "Food was good, service was ok.

Also, the rice is so sticky, I would expect the rice to be separated in biryani. I also tried chef special non veg started it was tasteless and I couldn't eat it.

I had booked it for my graduation dinner. We couldn't even talk to each other at the table. Even the waiters looked haggard and frustrated.The food came out fine--pretty tasty and only reason for 3 stars. When it came time to pay for dinner they charged our credit card twice.

Highly recommend to check this place out."], ["Robert K.", "Amazing food. It is very rare that a place gets fhe heat level right.. \u00a0i had to go thru a mini interrogation when I asked them to jack up the heat, bhot joku style, on the chicken tikka masala. These guys are the food equivalent of sommeliers. Perfect. I needed heat to shake a cold, I got heat plus flavor. The fact is that at most places if you say \"hit me\" flavor is sacrificed for heat. \u00a0Not here. The kitchen experts can attain serious heat without losing any flavor. In fact, my amped up masala ended up being a symphony of heat and flavor. To imagine this level of hot think Nepalese wayside heat, it is almost certain you trade flavor at 99 pct of places. Not here. Hats off masters of the tandoor. Also loved the cheese naan. And golub jamon? Sorry I cant spell. This is Chicagos goto place for Indian food.

The jazz music, bright white furniture, warm and contemporary wall color and art.We were a larger party and our waitress was very patient and sweet. The samosas were pretty standard compared to other places but the shell was softer and more flaky. The baingan bharta was overloaded with peas that I couldn't get to the taste off the eggplant and its soft texture. The biryani was moist unlike most others which are baked and more dry.

(They kept the restaurant open for 30 minutes longer so that we had enough time to eat)!So:"], ["Ritu D.", "My parents have enjoyed their food in the past, so when they came down for dinner one Saturday night, we decided to head over for dinner. I made a reservation but when we got there, the place was not busy at all, so it wasn't really necessary (but I've come to find out in Chicago, you're better safe than sorry!)Like I said, the place was not busy by any means, yet the service was insanely horrible. The excuse our waiter kept giving was that \"they are packed and it is so busy\", but I would hardly consider a restaurant that has half their tables vacant (if not more), packed or remotely \"so busy\".The guy refilling our water must have come by no less than 4 times before we were actually greeted by our server. I checked in on Yelp when we first sat down so I was able to easily keep track of the time, and our waiter welcomed us and took our drink orders 21 minutes after we sat down and blamed it on the busy night.... We ordered everything right away since we didn't know when we would see him next. (Good thing we did, we didn't see him until we were almost done with our entrees when he rushed by to ask how we were enjoying everything- at least he did that, I guess). I used a check in offer for a free app and got the appetizer sampler, which ended up on our bill. We didn't notice it, which is our mistake, but once we did- rather than blaming us and telling us they'll give us a free one next time (yeah right), the charge should have been reversed.As far as the food goes, it was pretty good- but not anything extraordinary which would make me want to return after bad service. The appetizer was pretty good- it came with a samosa, some pakoras (peppers, squash, potatoes), and cutlets. the potato filling in the samosa was flavorful. I wasn't the biggest fan of the pakoras- there wasn't much taste to them, just plain deep fried vegetables with no taste to the batter. I LOVED the cutlets. Very flavorful and decently spicy. And I liked the green chutney that came with it. They have a table where you can pick up some papad (fried dough), chutneys, veggies, pickles, etc. That was a very nice complimentary touch and was helpful when we needed more chutney for the samosas and our waiter was nowhere to be found. For entrees, we ordered the palak paneer, dal makhani, and bainghan bhartha (excuse my spelling!!). The palak paneer (spinach with Indian cheese) was decent. A nice kick to it and pretty tasty. I wasn't a big fan of the dal makhani (lentils)- it was pretty average. The bainghan bhartha was not to my taste because it was a bit sweet, but my parents really enjoyed it- so that's just my personal preference. For breads, I got the garlic naan which was huge and absolutely delicious!! My mom ordered the rumali roti, which is an incredibly large, super thin roti and my stepdad ordered the paratha- they both enjoyed their breads as well.Like I said, food was decent, but service was lacking. With plenty of other Indian restaurants within walking distance, I don't think I'll be returning soon, but maybe it was an off night as far as service goes since the rest of the reviews are favorable- so maybe give it a shot?"], ["Iris T.", "Indian food is something I must have once a month. It's also usually safe for me to eat when I need to (or want to) eat out. I pretty much follow a Jain-like diet and most Indian restaurants understand this diet so it tends to be easier to dine at Indian restaurants.We got breakfast down the road from this place and passed by it. To my surprise, Hubby mentioned it when it was time for lunch so we returned. I guess he wanted something salty and heavier than the usual sandwiches that we had mostly been limited to on our trip. Indian food was pretty safe - the question was what could they offer us. They had some tables already seated. At least half of them were Indian. That's a good sign! They had what looked like a pretty extensive buffet going on which I was tempted to view, but decided not to. I hate it when I can't eat something and I don't quite enjoy torturing myself if I have the choice, because I was about 110% sure we wouldn't be able to take advantage of the buffet, other than probably the breads and dessert. The decor was definitely geared towards \"fine dining\" with cloth-covered tables and wine glasses for your water. They also had a bar near the entrance.We were seated and our glasses filled. I then told the man that we ate Jain and that we would need the menu. He looked amazed. (East) Asian people? Jain? He questioned us and I told him that we pretty much followed their diet (easier that way). I'm not sure if he quite understood it. In fact, I'm pretty sure he thought I was telling him we were actually Jain, but either way, as long as he understood what we could and could not eat, I didn't care too much. We were told we could only have three items on their menu. Not too shabby, but not all that great of a selection, either. Especially when you see how many items there are on their menu (and buffet). Couldn't complain too much though! It was still food and it wasn't a sandwich or a salad. In fact, I'm pretty sure it wasn't all that healthy either.We got the Bombay Aloo (spiced potatoes) and the Paneer Makhani (Indian cheese in a butter-tomato-cream curry sauce) with some naan. Carbs and fat. Awesome. I felt like I needed it, though. Yelp had some sort of deal where you can get a free appetizer. I mentioned Yelp and before I could finish, the man told me that yes, I would get an extra 10% off my bill. O_o Well, why not? It's likely what I could have on the appetizer menu would have been underwhelming so having a discount of sorts would have been better. I took it. It took a little bit of time but the food did come out. I could hear the man-waiter talk to another person about us being Jain. I stifled a giggle. We were going to order a lassi to share and even considered something else like an appetizer, but it's a good thing we didn't. The dishes themselves weren't huge, but the portions coupled with the actual content and rice - not to mention the naan - was going to be crazy. With us traveling and not likely to return to the hotel until night, we really didn't want to have leftovers to take out. We did it! We finished every bit of the potato and paneer as well as the sauce and sides. Both were good and mildly spiced. The potato was tender but not falling apart and mashed potato-esque. It was well spiced and flavorful. The makhani had a decent amount of paneer in it and the sauce itself was rich. It frankly reminded me of Tomato Bisque. O_o In fact, were there any spices in there? By the time we were done, I was completely stuffed and more than satisfied. Service: amusing and helpful, but felt somewhat awkward at times.Food: good; could do with more choices, but can't really blame them (much)Facilities: not too loud and pretty clean... bathrooms could do with a little bit of work, though. It's 'fine dining' but a number of the customers were dressed pretty casually and that bathroom definitely wasn't upscale. Verdict: a pretty popular place (buffet seems to be very popular... boo on how I couldn't experience it) and the food I could eat was good. Struggled at around 3.4 stars, but decided to round up, just because it was the only hot, savory, and filling meal we had in Chicago other than sandwiches, but that doesn't count."], ["Shuang Z.", "I feel this place is actually better than Indian Garden. So if you decided to have lunch in streeterville area, I recommend this one over Indian Garden. They have a wider variety of dishes for their lunch buffet, I love the shrimp curry, which is not offered at Indian Garden. They have typical saga paneer, vege curry, lentile curry etc. My favorite thing at Gaylord is their ICECREAM!!! The flavors differ from day to day, so far I've had pistahcio and Mango.

We had eaten at Fogo the night before so we wanted some veggies so we were pleased that there were lots of vegetarian options.

The service was poor. I got there before my boyfriend and was largely ignored before two \u00a0gentlemen came into the establishment. Suddenly the host appeared and tried to show them to their seats. Before I could say anything, one of the men told him that I had been there first. So, after I was seated I waited ten minutes for water in a not too busy place. When my boyfriend arrived our waiter came and asked us what we would like. He tried to discourage us from sharing an entree and when we finished our order he asked us what else we'd like. He was pressuring us to order more. I ordered garlic naan because he led us to believe that our meal (Vegetarian Delight) only came with one piece of naan but this was untrue. We ordered mango lassi and if he had been more attentive I would have ordered another one. Multiple times we had to get his attention through the busser (I honestly wish we could have given the tip to her!). At one point I looked over at the table near ours and he had his fist on the table with his face inches away from some poor girl's face.

We've tried quite a few Indian places in Chicago (Rangoli, India House, a few along Devon) and Gaylord was definitively the best. The saag paneer, Kerala fish curry, and onion kulcha were seriously amazing. The fish was perfectly cooked and the saag was creamy with tons of paneer. I highly recommend both of those dishes. With our Yelp coupon we also got a samosa chat for an appetizer, which was like a samosa curry with tamarind sauce, mint chutney, and chickpeas. Really yummy and spicy. And it's right near Sprinkles which is great for dessert, though we'd love to try Gaylord's desserts sometime soon.This place is not hip like India House, but the atmosphere and wait staff are warm and cozy.

Everything was neat and well organized.

I'm sure the wait, if you arrive after 7pm, will be substantial. The food was mostly good. The chili chicken was spicy, as I had hoped. The chicken Madras was flavorful and the garlic Naan fresh. The only dish that was off was the biriyani. It was basically chunks of white rice, stirred with mild spices and a few pieces of chicken. The flavor was quite disappointing.

It seemed like every time someone came to our table it was a different person; thus, we'd have a waiter drop off beer but they'd scurry off and not take our entr\u00e9e order.

The khasi, which is more aromatic than a traditional indian goat curry, lacked flavor. It missed cinnamon or cardamom...something was very lacking in this dish, and considering it's my favorite goat curry, It was a huge let down.The butter chicken was not bad, but not the best either. It could've had a stronger flavor. The dal was the worst, it lacked a lot of salt and spices and aromatics. I could've gone with out tasting this. The best things on my plate were the palak(spinach) and the chefs vegetable mix. \u00a0They were REALLY good, but the lack of flavor in the meat dishes really couldn't be compromised.

For example, the naan bread is very thin, almost like flatbread, but with a bubbly crisp crust around the edge. We had the garlic version, and it was some of the best I've had. Because of its thinness, it wasn't too filling, yet made a great scoop for picking up sauce.We tried three entrees. The shrimp saag was rich and had a good spinach taste amidst the spices, but the strong flavors made the inclusion of shrimp pointless. Next time I would get it without any protein.Chicken Madras was extremely creamy, and the chicken was moist and succulent. I hadn't had this dish before, and really enjoyed it.But by far the best was the lamb korma, not so much because of the lamb (which was fine, but not tender and succulent like the chicken) but because of the wonderfully complex flavors in the korma sauce, one of the best versions I've tasted.The meal starts with a basket of papadums and two sauces, mint, and tamarind. The mint sauce was a bit thinner than some, and I like more cilantro in mine, but the tamarind sauce was outstanding, almost like fresh cherries in its fruitiness. Very different from the dark, cloying versions served most places.Service was extremely friendly and helpful. There are a large number of nice wines by the glass.

The food menu was fairly large, containing not only Indian, but Nepalese food as well. We skipped the appetizers and ordered entrees. Before we ordered food though, we got a light refreshment of chips and two different sauces. One was green (made with cilantro) and the other was dark brown. They were both delicious! Definitely a must try. For the entree, I got the Tandoori Chicken and my friend got the Chicken Tikka Masala. Both meals were finished pretty quickly and were served with naan. The Chicken Tikka Masala looked delicious! The Tandoori Chicken came out on a hot skillet. It also came with a dipping sauce. I have a low tolerance for spice, but this was seasoned just right. They also have a full bar with an average amount of wines, beers and cocktails. They served a few desserts as well, but we were already stuffed so we opted out of those. Maybe next time! I must say that the servers were very attentive, kind and prompt. They were quick to refill glasses without being asked and kept an eye on all of their tables throughout the evening.

For my entree, I ordered the lamb madras, which entailed \"boneless lamb cooked in a savory and exotic coconut-flavored creamy curry sauce with delicious indian spices and curry leaves\" (quote taken from the menu). I loved the coconut curry sauce and enjoyed that it didn't taste overly spicy. I can handle some spice and I didn't find this baby spicy at all, really. This was a great date night spot, especially for a first date! The atmosphere was romantic and classy, it was not overly expensive, we could easily converse without any loud conversations from the tables next to us or music playing, and (the best of all, in our case) the menu was really vegetarian friendly while still catering to meat eaters.

We couldn't hear our server, even after asking him to speak up. There wasn't a clear division of labor, so when we finally flagged someone down to refill waters, it was the manager, who was delivering food. He set down the food at the bar to bring us water before then resuming his trip to the other diners.It's very convenient to my place, the prices are reasonable, there's no music to talk over (plenty of din when the place is full), and so I'll be back.

Really? Not sure if I had an off experience, but it just didn't translate for me. Fianc\u00e9 and I ordered take out from Cumin on a night our go-to Indian place was closed. The order took all of the 35-40 minute estimate and then some to get ready. I found all of the dishes underwhelming in flavor and overpriced to boot! $14 for Chicken Tikki Masala and no rice or naan included?! There are way better deals in this city with better flavor too.The garlic naan was only mildly garlicky, but the thickness and overall portion was good. The basmati rice did not have the appearance or texture of basmati I'm accustomed to from other establishments; it was more akin to a white rice you'd pick up from Chinese takeout. At $4 a side on top of the $14-15 entree prices, I was not impressed!Our other dishes of the evening included Lamb Keema Samosas (very dry), Chicken Jalfrezi (okay, but pretty bland), and Palak Paneer (spinach dish, also under-seasoned).Bottom line: Cumin was just okay. Not terrible, but certainly no where near the best Indian food that I've had. I doubt I'd try it a second time given the countless other options here in Chicago."], ["Rachel M.", "Great little Nepalese and Indian food place in Wicker Park. They have an amazing all you can eat lunch buffet for just $13! They have tandoori veggies, butter chicken, palak paneer, and soooo many more entrees, and a killer rice pudding for dessert. Plus their naan was incredible. Go here asap."], ["Annmarie G.", "I've been here two times within the last year. The first time, I went during their lunch buffet to try out all the different types of Indian food they offer, which was great because at the time I was fairly new to Indian cuisine. The second time I went was for dinner, which was excellent. They serve you complimentary chips and dips (Sorry! I am unsure of the name) to start, which I have never had at an Indian restaurant before. The chips are light and not salty, and the two dips we had were fun to try ~ a good pre-dinner snack.For dinner, my boyfriend and I ordered the chicken saag and the chicken chili masala with garlic naan. Rice was complimentary with our entrees. When our food arrived, I was pleasantly surprised by how generous the meat portions were in both of our dishes. I am used to seeing pieces of protein drowning in a bowl of sauce, but this was not the case at Cumin. The sauce-meat ratio was spot on.As for this dishes, here's what we thought: The chicken chili masala was tasty with some spice to it, adding a bit of a bite. My boyfriend and I completely demolished the chicken saag, and would definitely get it again. The chicken and spinach sauce complemented each other nicely. Additionally, the garlic naan was some of the best naan I have ever had. Cooked perfectly and light, with just the right amount of garlic flavor, it was the perfect addition to our meal.I gave this place five stars because, while I haven't been to too many Indian Restaurants, this one is clearly the best one that I have been to. Their dishes are tasty, \u00a0their staff is friendly, and their decor is classy.

The decor is brilliant, the owner has decorated the place with original oil on canvas art work from a local Nepalese artist.

Will not recommend the dal and other vegetarian dishes because they are not anything as well made as the meat ones."], ["Camila H.", "I'm a huge fan of Indian food. I've been to Cumin between 5 to 7 times and I've never been disappointed. I've tried both their buffet (what a deal!) and their regular menu.

The guy says they don't deliver to me, and I mention that I know I usually have to pay a bit more delivery fee. The guy insists they flat out don't deliver to me, and that he doesn't see any prior orders in the computer from me; when I question why they would have my information AT ALL, he just hangs up the phone on me.Really?

What made me excited is I know that this place is always packed and busy so that has to be a sign of it being good. I made reservations for 7:30pm for a party of 4 that day and they were able to accommodate us which was nice. We came like a few minutes late and they still had our table ready and didn't give it away. Upon seating, three of us were already there and we were waiting for just one more so I told the server to give us a few minutes before ordering. That few minutes turned into at least a half an hour where no one besides a buss boy even approached us. That left a sour taste in my mouth right away since our 4th party member came 5 minutes later and yet no one came up to us. After a half an hour I asked a buss boy to get us a server, and we didn't get a server but we ended up getting the girl who seemed to be the hostess but either way she was super nice. So as you can see, service is a no no here, they really seem understaffed or overwhelmed and they should work on that. But fortunately, the food was pretty amazing and would have me coming back for more and here is what we got.Chicken momo - steamed dumplings of minced chicken seasoned with nepalese spices and herbs, \u00a0served with himalayan tomato-cashew sauce. This was super yummy and definitely a Nepalese classic, not greasy and all and loved that sauce.Goat chhoela - diced and boneless goat meat marinated in nepalese spices and herbs, grilled in tandoor and flash, cooked with flavorful nepalese spices, served with cumin signature flattened rice. This was okay, definitely moist and not dry but the flavors just weren't for me, I guess I prefer my goat dishes not boneless. Chicken Tikka Masala \u00a0-spice-marinated diced boneless white meat chicken cooked to perfection in tandoor, simmered in rich creamy tomato sauce. One of my favorite dishes of the night as it was the best version I ever had, not a super large portion but definitely delicious and great to dip all that naan into.Chicken biryani - basmati rice cooked with spice-marinated boneless chicken in indian biryani spice mix. Very yummy version here with carmelized onions on top which I never had before and loved. I would definitely get this dish again.Overall, fantastic food, liked both the Nepalese and Indian dishes, decent prices, decent portions, yummy naan, loved the flavors but the service definitely needs some work. I will definitely be back some day. Oh and the atmosphere is trendy with red walls and cuter than many other Indian places I've been to."], ["Sarah V.", "Ever since I found Rangoli, I haven't been back to Cumin. \u00a0Although Cumin is in an ideal location (surrounded by bars), the food is just so mediocre. \u00a0If you've been to Viceroy of India that's the kind of food you can expect. \u00a0It's okay, nothing to rave about and definitely nothing to go out of your way for. \u00a0The staff was accommodating and friendly which is the main reason I'll probably stop in to try their lunch buffet."], ["Allison B.", "Excellent weekend buffet, all the items were hot and fresh and delicious! Neat ambiance with the open brick walls. Fairly spacious seating for an urban restaurant, I loved that I didn't feel like someone else was sitting at our table.

Just spicy enough and the meat tender as a newborn.But our guest, who used to live in London where there's a curry shop on every corner, had the most demanding palate. He ordered an old standby, chicken tikka masala, white meat chicken cooked in tandoor and simmered in a creamy tomato sauce. Well??Superb! Love this joint but watch yourself.

I know this place gets very busy but they still keep their cool and try the best that they can. Very genuine people. Love the food there, there aren't much to say but to know that they have great curry dishes, and you have to get their garlic nann on the side with those dishes. I would recommend certain dishes but there is no way I could remember the names of them. But for appetizers, try their vegetable samosas( I personally think it's better than the meat one), their steamed bun with meat inside. And btw they give you freshly made chips and dip when you sit down. Street park, paid or free depends. Easy to find, there are always spots so don't worry. Now I crave Indian food again!"], ["Deborah C.", "I LOVE INDIAN FOOD. When I fall in love with an Indian restaurant, I return over and over and over. When I was in undergrad, I went to this one Indian restaurant an average of 3x a month for about 6 months (and then slowed it down to once every couple of months for reasons of saving money and my scale... lol). This wouldn't be impressive if not for the fact that I was maxing out my dining out budget AND I had to drive super far every time.The buffet is good, I will say that. Came right when it opened on a Saturday and it was fresh food with a decent selection of mains and sides. Their fruit bar was varied and surprisingly in-season and their kheer was bomb (I am picky about kheer because the aforementioned favorite restaurant had amazingggg kheer).Naan is okay, but I prefer garlic over plain naan (which they didn't have with the buffet)!Also, you know those pieces of plastic that hold pricetags to clothes? Those clear ones that look like a T? I found one of those in my curry. Actually, I was eating a bite of the curry and I was like... this is hard... and then took it out and yep... it was a piece of plastic. I told them about it and the guy was like \"oh... yea it probably came from our baskets or something,\" which I didn't quite understand. No effort to really apologize or make up for it. If you take into account the price (I think it's $15 per person?) and the incident, it's a 3 star place. If we're talking about just the food and no other bias, it might be a 3.5-4. The food is tasty, but not insanely delicious enough to warrant craving any of the dishes. I might be back in 1/2-1 year, maybe not... on to try more Indian Restaurants!"], ["Eric P.", "Great restaurant with amazing food and friendly service. \u00a0This is not your average Indian or Nepalese food. \u00a0The negative reviews about whether rice is included or delivery zones changing should be glossed over. \u00a0You shouldn't be comparing a restaurant of this caliber to average, delivery focused, inexpensive restaurants."], ["Hayley N.", "I love Cumin and would eat there everyday if I could! I always recommend it to people \u00a0just moving to Chicago or natives that want good food with a great atmosphere.I would have been more than happy to give them a 5 out of 5, but recently I tried calling and it took me 19 tries and 30 minutes to get a hold of someone on the phone for take out. There was no answering machine and several times I got a busy tone. For a restaurant that is always so busy, it would behoove you to get a few more phone lines and set up your answering machine. It is 2014 people..."], ["Tiffany G.", "I am giving four stars for now, as I've only been once and need to return a few more times to test consistency. If Cumin passes the mark, I'll gladly increase to five stars.I am extremely picky when it comes to Nepali and/or Indian cuisine and so often I am let down. After dining at so many of these establishments, literally around the country, I can only count on one hand those I'd frequent myself, and reccommend to others. Cumin is one of them. Very warm service, high quality meats/ingredients -- all well-executed. While we ordered various items, including the tandoori chicken (which was a very good version -- not dry like it is elsewhere), the chicken momos are really their stand-out. The momos are apparently their signature dish and indeed, are well worth ordering -- Cumin's are in fact the best rendition of this dish I've ever had. Based on the number of patrons who poured in on an early, cold weeknight, I'd say this restaurant is building up a steady and loyal following, and it's well deserved. This will definitely be our new, designated go-to Nepali / Indian in the Chicago area -- I hope it remains consistently good."], ["Magu S.", "We ordered all veg dishes and the food was average. service was bad, either they are short staffed or not bothered!

The vegetable samosas and butter chicken were good, but still the least good versions of them I've had. The rice with peas was just that- no spices at all. The lassi was syrupy sweet and from a jug. The set up is very fancy, white tablecloths and suited servers, but not a great date spot because you end up sitting closer to other daters than your own. What are you supposed to do when places with cloth napkins serve gross chicken parts? I ended up just swallowing a lot of connective tissue (also bland).

I can't handle too much heat in food, due to my family not incorporating spices in anything we ate growing up, but Cumin offers dishes to accommodate every heat tolerance level.We arrived at around 6:45 and were sat right away - no wait thankfully. Once we were initially sat down our server disappeared for awhile but once she returned we began our ordering of appetizers and Naan. We ended up ordering a couple of entrees as well to the table and shared all the food family style which was awesome and gave me a chance to try a lot of new things.What we ordered:Garlic Naan - will order this every time I come!Aaluko Achar - This was a bit too spicy for me but the table really liked it. The paste it's served in has a smooth creamy texture.Chicken 65 (Gateway of India) - This was probably hands down my favorite dish of the night. The makhani sauce with mustard seed, ginger, garlic, curry leaves, garnished with cilantro is amazing and I'm a huge fan of the flat rice it comes with.I can't remember the name of it but we ordered some kind of fried vegeateble appetizer dish. It was pretty good and light!Chicken Tandoori - I didn't find this dish extraordinary, and our chicken was a little dried, but it's tasty enough to give a try.Chicken Dum Biryani - I love Biryani rice apparently.. so this dish was a win for me.All and all we really enjoyed our food and the overall experience. My only real complaint is that our server kept disappearing for long periods of time throughout the night - delaying our food and drink orders considerably.Final Verdict:It's right down the street from me and very good! I shall be back again - for that Chicken 65 alone!"], ["Oliver R.", "Mixed review. I love the food here. Having Nepalese alongside Indian means there are lots of interesting choices. Goat being one of the choices. We had the chargrilled goat, which is great. My son had the eggplant curry, my wife a cauliflower dish, and I had the chicken chili masala. The chicken dish was refreshingly spicy. I'm tired of weak curries. The downside with this place is the service. The people are very nice, but the staff needs training. It's chaotic and you struggle getting someone to give you basic service because they don't seem to have the skills. I had to ask the manager to take our order, which he gladly did, but it shouldn't come to that. You couldn't come often because the service issues would drive you mad."], ["Joseph D.", "I'd say the average of these reviews seem to be spot on if not a little high. \u00a0As far as Indian food goes, in another city it would be top notch- with all the choices in the city it would be par if not slightly below.We got the light and dark tikka. \u00a0Spice level was low for what I'd consider normal. \u00a0Table side service was very good considering how crowded they are. \u00a0Prices were high, but they appear to be the only Indian in Wicker so I get it.The main issue with this place is the overall service. \u00a0Especially seating- since they are one of the only Indian places nearby they get slammed on the weekends and routinely disregard reservations for walkups to hit top capacity. \u00a0We waited 1 hr past our reservation and others who were waiting for theirs left in frustration. \u00a0Manager says he tries to balance between reservations and walk ins, which means if you walk in at 8 you and the person who has a table reserved at 8 wait the same amount of time. \u00a0He also stated this is every single weekend, and not an unusual occurrence (which makes an odd excuse). \u00a0Just not up to expectations.Id say if youre from the area, definitely worth going to for a lunch or weekday. \u00a0As someone who was looking for a less than 10 minute Indian option I would stay away any night/normal busy hour to avoid the hassle. \u00a0Plenty of on par food options with superior service as long as youre not stuck in Wicker."], ["Sonny S.", "You can smell this place a mile away! ...but in a good way! As soon as you walk into the restaurant, you are instantly hit in the face with an explosion of aromatic spices. The interior of the restaurant isn't a terribly large space, but it has a welcoming and cozy environment I would liken to visiting my Indian Grandmother's home, if I had one. The menu is enormous offering both Indian and Nepalese cuisine. My friend and I came craving Indian food so we ended up choosing the vegetable samosas, chicken makhani, lamb sheesh kabob, and of course, naan bread. VEGETABLE SAMOSASThe spiced-vegetable filled cones of deliciousness was everything I'd imagined it would be. The dough was fried to crisp (non-greasy) perfection and the vegetables had a nice kick of heat without being aggressively spicy. They were served with a coriander sauce as well as a chutney which helped tone down the heat.CHICKEN MAKHANI This dish, also known as butter chicken, is one of my absolute favorite Indian dishes. For those who don't prefer spicy dishes, chicken makhani is perfect for you. They use dark meat chicken which I quite prefer to white meat that is marinated and cooked in a tandoor. These luscious chunks of boneless chicken are then bathed in a velvety tomato sauce which is mild in flavor. Note: get your own order because you will NOT want to share!LAMB SHEESH KABOBAlthough I'm partial to butter chicken, this dish was delicious as well. Cooking in the tandoor really makes a difference because cooking it at such a high temperature allows a gorgeous crust to form on the exterior while keeping the inside nice and juicy!Service was on point. Our server checked in on us a few times, refilled our drinks and did a great job answering any questions we had about the menu. Parking is pretty easy with meter parking along the streets, but can get a bit congested later in the evening. Solid option for Indian food in Wicker Park when you don't feel like truckin' it out to Devon."], ["E W.", "Authentic, tasty Indian food. The absolute bonus for me is that they deliver.

Make sure you save some for when your main dish comes to dip in the sauces. o.m.g! We ordered the lamb stewed in a coconut spice sauce. This was phenomenal. The flavors were spot on and it wasn't too spicy so I felt like I really got to enjoy the sabor. The rice that came with it was pretty standard; however, add some of the sauce from the lamb and you're good to go. So why three stars?? Our sever was PAINFULLY slow and extremely un-attentive! And... The lamb portion, for $16, was wayyyy too small. We literally counted eight pieces of meat. It was just swimming in sauce. overpriced and horrible service? Not good, Cumin, not good.

The yoghurt was slightly sour. The Jhane Ko dal was lovely too. Palak paneer is more Palak than paneer which is how I like it, but paneer needs to melt in your mouth darlings, which it barely does. It needs to be cooked into the Palak so that they don't taste as separate items. The chicken makhani is exactly the way everyone I know loves it. Papad could be fresher. The kheer needs some sprucing - dry fruits and \u00a0caramelising.

I haven't had the dahl yet, so I won't speak to that. But again, I was left underwhelmed by the chana. It was very watery, soft and in general, not very flavorful.

Their garlic naan however--so so addicting! I literally could have just kept ordering naan because it was amazing. And the Napali aloo (potato) dish was also pretty good, but I will say that all of the entrees to split were a bit on the smaller side based on my indian dining experiences. But the Palak Paneer with all of that spinach really was pretty darn incredible too. That was another dish I just wanted to eat every bite of. And the Chicken Chilly Masala was also decent and had big green chilies in it, so it definitely packed a bit of spice which was a nice comparison to the other more mild dishes we got. They also have some affordable bottles of wine here too which is a nice addition to a meal for not adding a ton to your bill.

The spice is a little bit above what I would expect for an Indian restaurant in America, which I respect: for instance, the veg platter has a breaded hot pepper which lingered in my mouth for 10 minutes afterwards, which required copious amounts of Taj Mahal lager to quench. As Ali G says \"Respek!\" \u00a0Of the Nepalese choices, I highly recommend the chicken mo mo: it's like Chinese baozi with Indian spices and flavors. \u00a0The downside is that the prices are at least 2-3 dollars above what you would pay in Devon for a smaller plate so I can't say there is much value for the amount of food provided.So why one-star? My main complaints center around the atrocious service which detract so completely from the overall dining experience. \u00a0We came in around 745 and it took well over an hour for our entrees to arrive even though the place had only maybe 3-4 other parties. \u00a0Once our entrees finally arrived, various waiters asked every 4-5 minutes, \"are you done with this?\" as if they were very keen to have us leave (they close at ten and we weren't being excessively loud either). \u00a0Lastly as the piece de resistance, when I attempted to use my yelp check-in offer, the waiter had told us that the offer was only for maximum 10 dollars off which is apparently detailed on the print-out. \u00a0Now, I've used yelp check-in offers at many other restaurants and businesses in Chicago and they merely glance at my phone and comply. \u00a0However, these guys were so insistent on this fine-print on the print-out that the manager became involved and only after much hemming and hawing did they finally \"relent\" and give us 15% off (bear in mind, we ordered 3 rounds of crappy Indian alcohol swill so you would think they'd be more willing to provide the discount). Not a good way to promote your restaurant in a crowded Chicago South Asian restaurant scene, guys.So, in brief, Chicago curry house will not be replacing Devon options anytime soon for me. The lack of value for average-quality food and the abominable service combine to make this place only a choice of last resort if you're in the South Loop. \u00a0I hope they pull it together because I do think they have a nice niche with the Nepalese entrees, but the execution leaves MUCH to be desired."], ["Alex N.", "The food is good but the service is either great or terrible.

It is ALWAYS a goos sign when the Restaurant's ethic group is eating there!Next comes the main course....did I steer clear of my comfort zone and order a Nepalese goat dish? Hell no....stuck with Chicken Makhani (aka butter chicken) because I have a hard time finding this back in Charlotte. And I'm glad I did! The chicken was super tender and the sauce was \"sophisticatedly\" delicious. ....meaning much better than your standard Indian buffet-style sauce. Just a little heat to cap it off but not \"hot\" at all. Just yummy! Only complaint was that the food temp was luke warm. But the taste and texture more than made up for that. Oh the waiter recommended the garlic naan as an accompaniment. \u00a0Great idea as it was! This version of Naan was more flatbread in style, which was ok but I'd prefer it slightly more \"bready\" than crunchy. Good nonetheless.Finally for dessert I ordered the Gulab Jamun, which was a fried pastry covered in saffron syrup. It reminded me of a lighter version of a donut hole soaked in a light cane syrup. It was good, but not the \"dumpling\" as it was advertised.I ordered the Taj Mahal beer, hoping for something truly Indian. But honestly it tasted like a Budweiser lagger. I prefer big dark beers but this was light and not really my style. But at leasf it was drinkable.Overall a really good food night. If you're closeby you need to come check it out.

Our entrees were dal makhani and (I forget the name) paneer cubes with peas in a creamy, light colored gravy. Both were good - my problem with dal makhani is that I don't really care for the pinto beans that commonly come in the dish. I've had various people tell me this isn't really \"traditional\", so if that is true, I'm not sure why Indian restaurants do this - maybe to stretch the dish? Either way, it had good flavor, nice and creamy, but could have done without the pintos. The paneer was great - the nice rubbery texture I love in cheese like this, plus lots of green peas and a delicious (and probably heart healthy) gravy that was perfect with rice and naan - I would frankly be fine basically eating the sauce to most Indian dishes if you just gave me a bowl of rice.I am adding this to my list - Reasonably close to the loop and nearby hotels, nice atmosphere with friendly service, and pretty good food.

I was expecting just some rice to go with the main dish, but instead I was brought a second full main course of biryani rice. \u00a0I was by myself, so it seems odd that it would be assumed I wanted two full meals. \u00a0So there I am, with two full meals and a confiscated beer. \u00a0The place was about empty, and at all times it seemed that anywhere from one to four waiters were hovering around my table, watching. \u00a0Maybe they thought I would reoffend with my beer-smuggling, but they seemed also to be hovering around the only other occupied table. \u00a0It was very uncomfortable, even claustrophobic, even though the restaurant is a very large place. \u00a0Then it got worse. \u00a0A family came in with three very loud, very animated (I.e., screaming, I.e., obnoxious) children. \u00a0Even though the place was very big and almost empty, they were seated at the table next to mine. \u00a0By this point, I couldn't take any more, so I asked for my check after hardly making a dent in either of the two full meals I had been brought. \u00a0So I paid and got the hell out. \u00a0In summary, one of the very most unpleasant dining experiences I have ever had. \u00a0Certainly I have never paid so much to eat so little food. \u00a0Not to mention the lost beer. \u00a0I just couldn't stand to be in that place for another minute."], ["Ameer S.", "good service brought a friend visititing from Pakistan who approved of the authenticity of the food.

Our breads consisted of naan, garlic naan, keema naan, paratha and chapati. I could have made a meal on those and the dal alone! The keema naan was a little soggy for my taste, but all others had the perfect chewy/crisp combination and were awesome.

Excellent. Well the place looks nice at least but that is about it. I started with the shami kebob appetizer. It arrived looking like two black balls of soil. It was burnt beyond recognition with a pathetic pile of lettuce sloppily thrown down next to it. But since they had removed our menus some time ago and I had never before had this dish I gave them the benefit of the doubt that that was how it was supposed to look. It was awful, literally a centimeter of burnt skin that you had to penetrate before you could extract the little bit of dry meat on the inside that wasn't horribly burned. At this point I know I should have just sent it back but I had already torn it apart and you know how it is, you are always reluctant to send something back in the moment for fear you will look like a jerk.

The butter chicken also has an option to pick your level of heat, although I don't think it played a role in the dish. I chose medium, however. The baingan bharta was very spicy. It was the kind of spice that sits at the back of your tongue and your throat and slowly builds. I really enjoyed it, but will make sure that I get the lower level of spice next time. This is one of those great places that knows what the word \"spicy\" really means. It was creamy and I ate it straight with a spoon.

I ordered, I mean, MY stomach ordered the food at quarter to 7 and I didn't get it until quarter after 8pm. The next problem, which irritated me more than the first problem, was that my food was cold. Well not ice cold, more like lukewarm.

The Mutter Paneer TIkkah Massala was decent, it was noting spectacular if I had to compare it to other places I've eaten at, but it wasn't horrible.

It was just there.Lastly.. THE MANGO CHEESECAKE!!Oh if I had only known how good this was.. Had I known... I would have ordered a WHOLE cake.

Until it was done and then I fell back to earth and wanted more. (I may have cried a little cause it was over too soon.) The only bad thing I can say about the Mango Cheesecake was how it was delivered to me. The deliverer did not handle with care.

Sometimes it's too salty, the rice is too hard, the naan isn't fully cooked, etc. The grill items seem to be consistently good. Wish I could say the same about the biryani and chicken tikka masala. I personally don't feel it's overpriced if they were consistent. But when you get food your not happy with, that bill can be heavy."], ["Sarah S.", "Love this place immensely. Service is always great. Especially when your whole party is late. Tandoor is always so accomodating. Halal steaks always taste so yummy and basically everything on their menu is to die for!

What started out as a 6-person dinner ballooned into a party of 18, and they were nothing but accommodating the entire time (and after my many phone calls adjusting the number). Service was spot-on and the food was (as always) awesome, but the way they handled this large party with ease for such a big group was so amazing. They were extremely helpful about splitting the bill (we ended up just paying in cash but they said they would take as many credit cards as needed) and let us bring in a cake for dessert.

It's moist, huge, fresh, and the garlic naan had actual pieces of garlic. The veggie samosas are HUGE and filled with deliciousness; the mango lassi wasn't the best I've had but it was still delicious. The palak paneer was a bit of a disappointment; it was runny, the spinach was just chopped and thrown in, not actually ground up into the sauce. All-in-all, it was ok but I've certainly had better. The delivery was within the hour, which I was super happy about. It also arrived hot and fresh, which is always a nice surprise. I'll definitely order from here again."], ["Habiba Z.", "Went last night for the second time, had a wonderful time, starting from great service as soon as we walked in. We had an amazing server, Micheal, who really was kind, social, and not in a rush, although the whole place was full.

Steaks can with potatoes which were a perfect \u00a0pairing with the steak. Also I enjoyed the Tandoori Sauce with the steak, very unique flavors.Tandoor Char House always has superb service and high quality food, plus the ambiance is just perfect.

It is a huge plate, I took half of it home (and just ate it for breakfast)! I really enjoyed the meal.The service was spectacular as well. They were considerate enough to explain the different foods and sauces to us, a nice touch for a cuisine I was unfamiliar with.

We got butter chicken instead---which was not very good. The naan was good! Overall I think you can get better and more cost-effective food in Devon."], ["Rits M.", "I came here to specifically try out the fusion food. While we only got one dish of that, i have to say the food was pretty spectacular. We had the chaat fries, the kebab, dal, the biryani and the penne tikka masala. With 6 people, the bill came below 20$ each with tip and tax and there was mass amounts of food left over. Each entree is enough food for 3 people, so keep that in mind when you place your order. For dessert we had the gulab jamun, which was exceptionally well made. I found the lassi a little thinner than I am used to, but the mango flavor was delicious. The place has undergone a revamp and it now looks like a cute date place, or lunch with the ladies place. Good service and attentive people, willing to accomodate requests within the menu."], ["Rachel C.", "Love this place! My boyfriend and I went here for the first time in February and have been twice since. Each time, the food and service were wonderful. The last time we went we got the mixed grill which comes with a side of tikka masala for dipping your garlic naan. So delicious! They also give you a salad, rice, and side sauces for free. The mango cheesecake changed my life. It will change yours too.The owners go above and beyond the norm of hospitality. I'm so excited that they have plans for expansion so more people can dine in and have the true experience.

Enjoy it and give this place a chance."], ["Francois L.", "Not impressed - food was average. I had the Chicken tikka masala and my wife the tandoor paneer. The tandoor paneer had lots of onions and vegetables, but hardly any paneer. The tikka was too liquid and insipid. It is supposed to be creamy and spicy. Quantity of meat was small. Naan was good, so was rice. But it was definitely not worth the price paid."], ["Krystle P.", "Our favorite Indian place in the city hands down.

Waitstaff was nice, owner (who is very involved, and speaks with each patron) came to our table to make sure we were enjoying ourselves and the food was good. Overall great experience! It was funny, because we got the vegetarian samosas, which were amazing. Upon finishing, our waiter asked what we thought of the two sauces, which we didn't receive, so I asked, \"what sauces?\" He was overly apologetic and got us a new order of samosas, which were equally as amazing, this time with the sauces. If you've seen their samosas, you know that eating two will probably fill anyone up. But alas, they were awesome and the sauces were great. He also comped us a free dessert, which was completely unnecessary but much appreciated. They also have this crazy super spicy carrot relish stuff... not sure how to describe it other than unreal. I've never had anything like it and it's amazing. SUPER spicy, but very fresh tasting too. I wish I could just get a huge tub of that stuff. After looking at the menu, I think this stuff is called Achar. Usually we get takeout, which is just as good as dining in (something that can't be said of most restaurants). The Mutter Paneer Tikka Masala is ridiculous and very flavorful. Usually my wife and I will get an order of veggie samosas and split the paneer tikka misala and we're both sufficiently full and satisfied. Big portions and awesome food."], ["Chad S.", "A great first experience! The space is cozy, accommodating and tastefully decorated.

I wrote a review 2 years ago and gave this place 5 stars and that was well deserved. \u00a0I came here last Sunday and the food was 2 stars at best. The service on the other hand was excellent. I have been telling anyone willing to listen, \"Tandoor Charhouse had the moxy to open up next to Raj Darbar which is a Michelin Bib Gourmand restaurant means they have something to prove.\" That statement held true until this past Sunday. \u00a0It's time to break it down. The Tandoori Chicken was atrocious. \u00a0The chicken legs were burnt, dry and miniscule. At this point I had a sinking feeling that we were in trouble. The Paneer Pakora was good but nowhere near as good as I remember. \u00a0The Vegetable Pakora was decent. The Chana Masala looked delicious and my excitement quickly turned to despair upon my first bite. It was light on flavor and the garbanzo beans weren't cooked all the way through. \u00a0They were hard and barely edible. \u00a0The Mattar Paneer reminded me of the old Wendy's Where's the Beef ad except in this case it was \"Where's the Mattar (peas)\" This dish was basically a creamy tomato soup with an occasional pea and a few lonely chunks of paneer.. Next up, \u00a0the Lamb Karhai which was good but nothing to write home about. The Aloo Paratha was boring so skip it. To round out this review on a high note, the naan and garlic naan were spot on.

I had the chicken tikka masala, and asked for medium spice (they give you a choice of mild, medium, or spicy). The spice level was about right, and the chicken was really tender and not dry. They served the basmati rice family-style, and as far as I can tell, refills on the rice were free... they brought us more after we finished and it didn't appear as an extra charge on our bill. The garlic naan was also delicious. Between the three of us, we ordered three entrees, had the basmati rice that came with it, and ordered one serving of naan, which I felt was about the right amount of food. I personally thought the prices were a bit steep at $15 for my chicken tikka masala - I'd actually really wanted to try one of the fusion options they had on the menu, but those were even more expensive.So, everything was solid - I just didn't think the food was rave-worthy. I'd probably check out some other Indian places in the area before coming back here."], ["Kaela W.", "Terrible. Will never eat here again. Ordered delivery and arrived in 30 minutes.

Italian and Indian fusion doesn't work in my opinion ...and one of my friends ordered a shrimp curry dish that had only like 5 pieces of shrimps !!!

Perfect.We got in the door at 10:20, (walking past a neon \"OPEN\" sign). The restaurant was about half full. The host informed us that the dining room was closed. I was surprised, since I knew they were actually open til 11:00. So I said we came there because it says online that they are open til 11:00. He told me \"well the kitchen staff gets annoyed if we seat people too late\". Are you kidding me? I worked in the restaurant industry for 8 years. I know that the time you say you close is the time you SEAT until. And it's not like we were the only people there, as I mentioned before. Also, how extremely unprofessional to speak ill of your kitchen staff to a customer. And to act like there is nothing you can do. I told them they should change the time on their site and we left.

I was in Chicago, on my way to Madison with a close friend, and met up with a friend that was a grad student.Ghareeb didn't have any naan left: at 1:30 PM, they shut down the naan operations. Imagine the feeling of a red rubber stamp hitting you on the forehead with some red ink that said \"No Naan.\" The man at the counter offered a naan equivalent: he saw the look on my face and knew I needed some form of bread. They also were out of paneer, and didn't have some of the lentil dishes either. We ended up ordering the chana masala, a mixed veggie curry, a potato (aloo) curry, and a spinach (palak) curry.The chana masala was great: it wasn't too spicy, and the chickpeas were nice and tender. The palak is something I won't order again: the blended spinach was just not my cup of tea, and not because I don't drink tea. I can do saag dishes, not but palak dishes. The potato curry was decent. It had this lightness, which was very surprising because lightness is not the first thing that comes to mind when I think \"potato.\" The mixed vegetable curry was a bit disappointing. I need to stop ordering mixed vegetable curries: they always end up mushy. \u00a0This place was super cheap; each entr\u00e9e was only a few dollars, and my friends and I only spent 25ish dollars on enough food for two or three meals.

You're telling me that they don't sell naan here?...That should have sealed the deal.The chicken marsala that I ordered came in a small container and wasn't anything to write home about (minus this Yelp review, eh?) It felt very basic and unimaginative, and seemed like they had simply reheated up some existing curry and dropped in some pieces of chicken.On top of that, I felt very uneasy after eating at Ghareeb- even resulting in some full on hiccup episodes that lasted for a good two days, That by association may be enough for me to not want to come back.

I think if you come here expect to receive quantity over quality. This restaurant is similar to Ghareeb Nawaz on Devon ave. However, I believe that the restaurants share the \u00a0same name but they are different establishments and they offer different food options.It seems like the restaurant creates mix and match food items. They create a few dishes in bulk, and then allow the customer to order them together. For example, you can order chili chicken with a paratha, in a paratha roll, with rice, or mixed into rice like a biryani. The great thing about this restaurant is that the food is very inexpensive and the quantity is large. You can have a filling and full meal for about five dollars a person.I ordered the gyros and the seekh kabobs with paratha on two separate visits. I found the gyros to be salty, but I really liked the seekh kabob. It was delicious and I \u00a0though it was spicy, had a smoky flavor, and \u00a0grilled flavor.I also got an aloo samosa, and the taste was okay.My mom ordered the chili chicken on two separate visits, and she said she enjoyed it.The service at this restaurant is nothing to write home about. You order at the counter and then you pick it up yourself. The people at the front are surly, and they seem distracted with other orders as you give them your order. I don't like this at all.

Just the right heat while still allowing you to taste the underlying flavors. Chicken can be a little overcooked sometimes, but overall a very solid dish. Frontier chicken is also very tasty, but i have found that it can be inconsistent. I have had it many times and it can be sometimes under seasoned. When prepared properly; very tasty (I should add that I've only received a very under seasoned version once really). Frontier beef is the same as the chicken, but seems to be more consistently seasoned. I always order parathas, and while they are not the traditional kind they are still very tasty. They spinach and chick pea dishes are what I always get as a vegetable (I will try to update with names next time I go) and are also very tasty.Bottom line: for the price, this place simply cannot be beat.

But it's right on the corner, if you get off the halsted bus at roosevelt you'll definitely see it.Most you'll pay for an entree is $4.99. But some, like the Butter Chicken (tasty!) doesn't come with parhata (bread), or rice, which is what you eat it with. Thankfully those extras are $0.99 each. I got a butter chicken and two parhata - one with oil and one without. I'd recommend the one with oil if you're not a regular Indian food lover and don't know what in God's name to order. It has a better taste and is easier to eat - without oil is dry. Customer service is decent, not mind-blowing but they're kind. Wish they didn't run out of samosas, though. I love those things. Their Mango Lassi - it's kind of like mango-flavored creamy milk - is very good, not too sweet but goes well with the food.You'll leave satisfied with money still in your wallet.

Both meat eaters and vegetarians will be happy with the extensive menu, and prices are very reasonable.A word of warning: if you order something spicy, it will melt your face off! They don't mess around when it comes to adding some heat to your food if you request it.

I didn't understand the correlation of a new menu and non availability of their chef recommended dish. That said, we were pleasantly surprised by the food that was available. Although, not authentic Nepalese, our Chicken biryani, the Lamb Khasi and keema nan were all well prepared. The food alone would warrant a visit again! However, between their service and certain charges such as a $7 corkage and $2 for a few slices of raw Onions (a staple with Indian food), we might only do takeout or delivery. They don't close until 10 but by 9:15 during our meal, the server came twice to remove the pickle and chutney container, since it had to be washed before closing. Did I mention, we were still only half way through our meal? For a restaurant that's almost always empty, they can make some very minor tweaks that would earn them repeat customers including myself....oh, well one can hope!"], ["Aiman T.", "The phone in the resturant keeps ringing with order and ruins the quite environment.

The best curries and flavors come from the freshest ingredients which must be layered into the dishes.

The first odd thing was the choice of plates at the buffet. It was a small shallow bowl-kind of plate, good for soups and such. I thought that the regular plates needed to be brought out and I asked the waiter for regular plates. He gruffly said - these are the plates for the buffet. Okay, then! It was impossible to eat from that plate. Every curry mixed in with the next one, super messy and a VERY BAD way to eat an Indian buffet. We sat at our table with our vegetables and curry waiting for over 10 mins for the naan to arrive at our table. I had to flag 3 ppl down to tell them that we were waiting for naan. Terrible service and people skills.

Either the rice portion of it was over done or the grains they used weren't the authentic basmati ones. \u00a0The chicken 65, was pretty tasteless, just fried chicken dipped in red batter, and the portion was extremely small for being $9, I literarily got 7-8 pieces, and each piece was less than a thumb size. Chicken 65 is known to be a spicy dish, which was very lacking in this. The chicken tikka masala tasted okay, the best from all the dishes I had ordered. Is wasn't as very saucy as the original recipe is suppose to be and the presentation was lacking. The mix pakora was a huge disaster, again tasteless. Just fried veggies in a yellow batter, served with sauces. It was very soggy and not crispy. The onion pakoras were very good, and tasted like actual pakoras. Fried well and crispy. The raita that was served with the biryani was actually the best dish. It was amazing, very cool and refreshing. Overall, the food isn't anything amazing, and below par for myself.

All tasty, though. The dessert was a rice and cashew affair that was quite nice. The samplers seemed pricey at $24 each, but they were enjoyable.The staff was courteous.

I won't be going back though. First off, I was waiting for maybe 2 min before I was seated. \u00a0Customers should not have to wait more than 10 seconds before someone talks to them.Yes the lady was inside the kitchen getting food outside but that ain't my problem. Hire more staff!The naam came out within minutes which was great. Problem is, I didn't expect it. I actually wanted tandoori roti made out of whole wheat. Not sure if I want to deduct anything here but I think a nice thing would have been to ask.Now the food was mediocre at best. The indian snack that looked like bhel poori is NEVER EVER to be left out like that for a Buffett. \u00a0We all know it will get soggy and a soggy bhel poori is like ordering an extra crispy fried chicken only to be dumped in some gravy and then delivered 15 minutes later to be consumed. Ordered crispy cause u want a crispy chicken, not soggy. (Best way to describe).Cut veggies as salad is awesome but having ice cubes on them in the buffet? Are u serious? \u00a0Why would u do that?Tried one Samoa which was average. The mixed pakora were horrible. They were just soaked with oil. Now I know fried pakora are deep fried and I have had them all my life. But you do not get oil gushing into your mouth as you bite into a pakora. Dont u want ur customers to come back or do u want to overclogg their arteries before they never make it back to u?The chicken was really good..FYI for those that dont know this. The texture of the chicken here is EXACTLY how a butter chicken should be. U go to usual indian restaurants and they give u large chunks of chick breast that are now dry. Wrong method. This place serves it the authentic way. Taste not bad. Too Americanized in my opinion but Im not gonna complain about that.The naan was made very well.I had two used plates on my table before the lady came and picked them up. Again, they were not super busy and if they need more staff, so be it. Lastly, I regret not using my 15% off yelp code as I was in utter shock that the buffet cost 11.99 on a Tuesday afternoon!!!!! Now that meal was worth no more than $6 to $7 for the amount of variety and quality of the food and service.This is probably my most elaborate review of an Indian/Nepali restaurant because I am really tired of us Indians putting together a few chairs and tables under a roof with lousy food and just terrible service and calling it an Indian Restaurant. Come on guys, improve your services. A little smile will not harm you. A little checking in with your customers is in no way going to offend them.

The food was delicious, with a small but savory Nepali menu and a more expansive Indian menu for those not as culinarily adventurous. Dining with a group. Of fur, \u00a0we tried two Nepali and two Indian dishes, all four were outstanding. The buttered chicken, while a safe dish, was superb and the perhaps the best I've had. On the Nepali side,we ordered a meat and a vegetarian dish. Both were savory, with the one caveat of the meat dish being bone-in. (you are well forewarned in the menu, but it's prudent to check your goat or lamb before just chomping down.) Perhaps the most outstanding dish was the chicken momo, which was an appetizer that looked like Asian sticky buns. Advised by other Yelpers to try them, the momos were the a huge payoff.Ultimately, this place was so great we went back again for dinner the next day and again had prompt, delicious service.The only reason to knock off a star was that when we tried to order a bottle of wine that was out of stock, our server tried to suggest an alternate bottle, failing to mention it was $80 more than our originally ordered bottle.

Now, I have ordered about a dozen times the same dishes and I can tell you, this was not correct. He tried to explain the chef was different this evening so the dishes may look different but assured me the ingredients were the same. I tried them and was immediately disappointed. It was so unpleasant. Let's see: the tikka masala- yellow, watery and gross; the chicken vindaloo- a mess of bad seasoning, chewy chicken and weak taste; the chicken 65- well, we got lamb so that should tell you how that went; even the samosas were so unbelievably unpleasant it was barely edible. To top this off, the person on the phone was rude and unapologetic. All in all, the meal basically went straight to the trash and we were left with a very bad taste in our mouths."], ["Girish Chandra K.", "Veggie momos were good.

They have a solid selection of north and some South Indian dishes, and everything I've had has always been super fresh, flavorful, and incredibly delicious. I get the Chana saag often as well as the lamb korma, queema, and chicken vindaloo. Unlike many other places I've been, their vindaloo is not only hot but SUPER tasty; it burns a lot to eat but I just can't stop shoveling it into my mouth, which is exactly what I want from a really hot dish. They have some chaat as well, and the chutneys and relish are always fresh and on-point. Their sweets are light and not dense or overwhelming, even heavy ones like gulab jamun are fluffy in texture even if covered in syrup. Their queema is well spiced and never greasy, which is another problem I've had at other restaurants. Their kebabs are always juicy, tender, and flavorful. Whoever is in the kitchen here knows what they are doing and cares a lot about making delicious food with a homey feel. I don't know much about Nepalese food and haven't had their Nepali dishes, but I can only imagine they are just as good given that this is their specialty. Delivery aways arrives hot (or cold if its a cold dish) and carefully-packed, and they are always really nice on the phone. I cannot recommend this place enough. If you live far away from Devon avenue, go here. They have never let me down."], ["Lo S.", "I luv Indian food!! Nepal house has awesome food!! Not too oily which I appreciate! Prices are fair.

It's conveniently located at 13th and Michigan and is a welcome addition in the South Loop. With Indian restaurants in particular, I believe the best way to judge them is to order one of the classic staples and see how they perform. If they can't make one of the most beloved dishes well, then there's really no need to sample further in the future. Chicken Tikka Masala is my go to dish for these cases. I've had better tikka masalas (from British themed pubs no less), but Nepal House does a good job with it. It's different though from the other variations I've encountered. I wouldn't say better or worse, just different. I believe this stems from the Nepalanese influence, but seeing as I'm no expert in this field, I'll defer to someone else that knows more. Garlic naan was light and fluffy and soaked up all the sauce like a champ. Generous portion of naan so one per person is more than enough. I'd like to try their chicken saag next time I order. Worth checking out if you live in the neighborhood."], ["Ram J.", "So you're on Grub Hub, looking at a few Indian restaurants, all with moderate reviews. That's a scary place to be in my friend.

My only complaint is that they don't include enough rice with the entrees, so I always have to order a side of it. I put that little 5th Yelp star that they could've had in the rice and it adds a satisfying tinge to my meal."], ["Chicago J.", "Walked in, and the man behind the counter was talking to someone. \u00a0I waited a few minutes.

Are they buffet only? Other yelp posts indicate they are not, so what am I missing? The food itself was just as I initially thought - meh. Standard Indian buffet items. I thought this was Nepalese? Some weren't labeled, but there was a daal, and a saag, cabbage masala, butter chicken. I noticed several people from the back come out and get items from the buffet to fill in containers. I assume they were either eating it themselves (lunch break?) or they were to-go/delivery orders. \u00a0At no point was I asked if I needed/wanted anything else, or asked if everything was okay, the kind of thing typically inquired at restaurants. Negative.Towards the end of my meal I noticed the restaurant was starting to fill up. The server passed by my table without filling up my water (I guess there has to be a specific amount missing before he'll re-fill it?), which was another negative, since I tend to drink a lot of water when dining out. A few minutes later a woman came from the back, distractedly filling my water glass. \u00a0She looked all around the restaurant as she did so, spilling quite a lot of water I may add, not acknowledging me at all, even as I thanked her for the water. \u00a0Speaking of drinking a lot of water, I needed to use the restroom.

What if I wanted dessert, or *gasp* more food?? \u00a0I guess they decided I was taking up too much of their time? So I grabbed my things and went up to pay. \u00a0There was no one in sight. No one at the front, no one on the floor. If I was a less ethical person, I would have walked out. \u00a0I COULD have walked out. Several people I re-counted this experience to today said I SHOULD have walked out.

It was a little awkward because there was nowhere to stand and wait except for near the door where a small crowd of people were already standing. We patiently waited for a table to open and when one finally did, we were informed that it was reserved! For such a small restaurant, I don't think it's a good idea to take reservations or at least just have one large table reserved for big groups. While waiting, we looked at the menu and figured out what to order.We ordered: veggie samosaslamb saag w/basmati ricemutter paneergarlic naanEverything was delicious! The lamb was so tender and the garlic naan was fresh and hot. I had been craving Indian food for awhile and was extremely satisfied with all the dishes.

HIGHLY recommend this place!"], ["Connie P.", "Chug your wine, 'cause you are outta there!Starting off, I want to say that if I could separately rate the food versus the service, my rating would be different. However, since I cannot, this place get a 3. I didn't want to do 2 stars, but the service was so horrific that I wish I could give them a 1 star. If this peaks your curiosity, read on.A group of us came for a 7:30pm reservation. By the time everyone showed up it was closed to 7:45-7:50. We were seated in the front, in 2 tables. There were 7 of us total, but they only gave us 3 chairs. if you have been here before, you know that each table is essentially good for 1 person on each side. We were forced to have 4 people on one side, which was very, very, very annoying, as there was so much food on the 2 tables that eating was a sport - make sure you don't spill on yourself, make sure your arm doesn't hit the other person next to you, make sure your smallest movements don't cause a domino effect of things falling on the table. It wasn't thought out well. I asked for another chair, so we could at least have 3 people on the side, and rudely I was told they had no chairs and that we would need to have all 4 on one side. Who does that? How do you not have enough chairs? We ordered a ton of food. A ton. The food was fantastic. I would come back here for the food anytime. However, the service was shotty. We ordered naan, and it came last, after all the food, and we had to ask again to make sure they were bringing it. After they brought it, we asked for the sauces, which should have already been given to us. Nope. We had to ask. And they were not the most polite about it. We had to continually ask for these sauces, as there were 7 of us, and they gave us 1 small dish. We also had to keep asking for water.Normally, these things would not bother me as much if the last thing didn't happen. But it did, so now this place is tainted in my mind.We finished eating and since it's a BYOB, we were still finishing our wine bottles that were open (3). We were asked by 2 separate waiters that we needed to go, because they needed our table. I have never, ever, been asked to leave an establishment when we are still not done with our drinks/food. I could understand if the entire place was packed, people were waiting in line outside or in the front, or if we were there for 3 hours and still not leaving. But we weren't even there 1.5 hours and were being forced to leave. We had full wine glasses full of wine, and we had just had the table cleared! It was appalling. You NEVER tell your guests they have to leave when your establishment offers BYOB, forcing them to essentially leave what they have behind.We ended up chugging our wine because we got asked again to leave. All of us were in shock that they had the nerve to ask us again to leave. We were respectful the entire time, but it seemed the politeness only was one sided. It's a shame, really. Because terrible service is a big factor in choosing where you want to spend your money. There are plenty of restaurants in chicago to choose from. Even though the food was great, the service is what got me. It won't be the first place I'll suggest for indian from here on out, so if you don't care about being treated like you don't matter, then go to this place. If you actually want the establishment to appreciate you as a customer, then I would suggest going elsewhere."], ["Natasha S.", "Excellent all around.

However, I left thinking, I'm glad I tried it but it was nothing special or amazing. I read that it gets super busy so I decided to check it out on Sunday afternoon for an early dinner right when they open at 4:30pm. Well that was genius since no one was there and we got to pick any table we wanted. They have one table right by the open doors which is nice when the weather is great to catch some Chicago breezes. I mean you know it's about to get hot in your mouth so you need some extra air, right? Right. So upon arrival, the place is very nice decorated with little pillows, funky chandeliers, definitely liked the vibe. The service was good the entire time as everything was brought out fast and served hot just like we like it.Here is what we got that some people recommended with our friends to share: Gobi Manchurian -Cauliflower florets golden fried, saut'eed with chopped garlic, ginger, spring onions, with a hint of soy sauce. Super yummy, my hubby hates cauliflower and loved this dish so it's a must get and get it medium spicy.Keema Samosa (2pc) Crisp, deep fried turnovers stuffed with mild minced lamb and peas. These were a little dry in my opinion and couldn't really taste the lamb nor the flavor of it.Chicken Tikka Masala- Marinated white meat chicken cooked in tomato based sauce with herbs and spices. Something we get at every Indian restaurant and it did not disappoint. Loved dipping all their fresh naan into it. Oh, and get the butter naan, you'll thank me later.Vegetable Biryani-Basmati rice and vegetables cooked in aromatic spices; served with raita. Okay, so I didn't love this version as I've had others I liked before. Plus, our curries came with rice already so I wasn't sure why a server didn't let us know before we ordered this as well. Lamb Rogan Josh-Boneless lamb cooked with mild dry red chilies with a hint of yogurt. Our server told me to get this dish and he said it's a little spicy. A little spicy?! OMG, it was on fire. I can't tell you my thoughts on this dish since it was basically fire in my mouth and I couldn't taste anything else.Overall, some classics like tikka masala were awesome, loved the gobi manchurian and of course all their naan, but other dishes were all so eh.

The location of this area is quite unassuming and there are not a whole lot of eateries around this place.The place itself is not huge but has some decent seating area , the white wall background with dim lighting added up to the d\u00e9cor.They have a menu which is a good mix of traditional Indian and some Indian fusion(Indian Chinese) fare.

Cauliflower is coated in a flour layer before tossed in sauces.* Paneer Masala - Indian cheese cubes cooked in creamy tomato sauce.* Lamb Biryani - Traditional basmati long rice cooked with curried meat.* Plain and garlic naan - Bread with butter and garlic flavor.First the food overall was really good.Gobi Manchurian is a must try it had some really good flavors. The entr\u00e9e paneer dish was also tasty , we wanted little more spice so we got the Indian pickle on side($1 extra).

I'm pretty sure they hadn't worked on my order yet because the woman was very confused, asked for my name and address multiple times, said GrubHub about three times, and then ended the call with the ubquitious \"the driver just left\"About 30 mins later we received our food. It was piping hot which is great but is what lead me to believe that our order hadn't been picked up.The food smelled wonderful. I ordered buttered naan and received regular naan. I wasn't going to call for the $1 difference but it furthered my annoyance. We loved the Gobi Manchurian. I ordered everything at the least spicy possible and our dishes were super spicy. I'm a wimp when it comes to heat but even my boyfriend was sweating and drinking lots of water. It was painful to eat but we were so starving and it did smell great."], ["Angie K.", "Rangoli got it going on. Rangoli has surpassed my expectations every time. I've been here with friends, family and even hosted my hubby's surprise 30th bday party. For the party, the staff let me bring a cake beforehand, decorate the table with corny bday crap and when his fam rolled up with coolers to BYOB (which is why I love them), they didn't even bat an eye. Their food is phenomenal. Something that stands out here is the gobi manchurian which I always get. It tastes like calamari but it's cauliflower. How the f? I've had the samosas, naan, roti, tikka, the kofta which were all excellent. Recently I said yolo and tried the navratan korma, which was sweet and peanuty and a beautiful break from spicy food when you need it. Hubby loves the lamb korma and pretty much every lamb dish here. Every time I've been, I've shut the place down and they've never said a thing. Truly the nicest staff ever!I love Rangoli forever ever."], ["Steven Y.", "Rangoli was a mesmerizing experience. They have the best lamb samosas in the city. Beautiful pyramid shape and accompanying sauce. I had butter chicken as my main dish, which is a bold choice on my part - but it was perfect, with thick cubes of chicken and perfectly seasoned rice. The best part, though, about Rangoli is the fact that they serve chilled water without ice. Ice is overrated. Oh, and the price is pretty great too, as well as the plentiful parking nearby. 5/5 would go again (because I already have)."], ["Kelsey W.", "Here's the catch-22: Rangoli is best with pickup or delivery (you get more food, meat is more tender...I know it's weird!)

I think the problem lies in management because the food it so good."], ["Anshika A.", "Took my friends for some good Indian food and nice evening. Great decor, good lighting, small space and good food. Saturday nights are busy though so get urself a table reserved. The service needs some improvement and they are short of waiting space."], ["Vanessa Y.", "Loved it!! Food was great - not the absolute best overall Indian food I've ever had, but it was close! One of the vegetable curries we tried (had pineapple in it) was one of the best veg dishes I've had in recent memory. What really made our experience great though was the service. When we ordered the lamb vindaloo (which had 3 chilis next to it), the server cautioned us about its spiciness, so we we asked for it to be medium spicy instead. Even with that adjustment, it was ridiculously hot to our weakling palates. Our server and a guy who I think might have been a manager kept their eyes on us, checked in to make sure it wasn't *too* spicy, and then kept our water re-filled and gave us a cooling yogurt sauce when they saw that clearly it was. I really appreciated their level of consideration and desire to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.Will definitely be back!"], ["Aditi G.", "I finally made it to Rangoli! I heard a lot about this amazing restaurant from reviews and articles about it online. I myself am Indian and have been eating and going to Devon Street since before I could walk. If my family, friends or I ever wanted authentic, no bullshit Indian food, we would go to our favorite places there. I think it's great that Rangoli is located in a different area so people don't have to drive all the way up north to Devon to get quality Indian food. When I looked at their menu online, I nearly screamed and jumped out of my seat when I saw that they serve gobi manchurian! (DO YOURSELF A FAVOR and order this if you haven't already!) The last time I had this was when I was visiting family in India and I haven't been able to find it anywhere in Chicago since then. Its a Chinese/Indian fusion cauliflower appetizer and beyond that I can't describe it too much - you just gotta try it. They make it so well that I feel like I am in India eating it. My friend ordered a mango lassi which I tried and it was the perfect consistency and not too sweet. Awesome! We also ordered gobi manchurian, veggie samosa, naan, butter paneer and rice. The entire meal was incredible. This tastes like homemade food. Take it from a caramel sista!"], ["Dustin H.", "We started with the onion Bhajee. Onions in spiced chickpea flour, tossed with herbs and beautifully fried. It was like an Indian bloomin' onion and unsurprisingly addictive. The Mutter Paneer was silky and savory with it's fresh homemade cheese and peas in a buttery cream sauce. Perfect. On the menu, the chicken Vindaloo is described as being \"hot and spicy\" and holy hell, boy oh boy, is that ever an understatement. It provides your body with waves of sweaty thunder bolts that makes you both nervous and excited to be alive. Beautifully seasoned and really really spicy. I attempted to cool my mouth with some onion naan dipped in mint chutney but NOPE that was spicy as hell too. At that point I said fuck it and dipped some of the garlic naan in the perfect spicy pickled onions. Sure it was all really hot, but it was also so so delicious and harmonious in my mouth. I was in love. Sweaty sweaty love."], ["Danny W.", "I do Indian food about as often as I watch Bollywood films, but I'd consider Rangoli the Slumdog Millionaire for my stomach cause it was definitely some feel good food for the summer. Get the Gobi Manchurian. It's basically orange chicken except with cauliflower instead of meat and the garlic naan is good to start as well. For entrees, either the Mushroom Masala, Lamb Rogan Josh, or Lamb Korma are all amazing options and none of them gave me indigestion either which is usually not the case when I dabble in this cuisine. They do lots of deliveries, but it's a great place to dine in on the account of the lavish d\u00e9cor, being BYOB, and the incredibly attentive service. It was a really nice touch that they kept coming up to make sure things weren't too spicy. They must have sensed my stomach is usually sensitive to the spices, and it was very comforting to see they cared bout what the aftermath of the meal might be for me. Overall it was an excellent experience. If you're not into heading all the way up to Devon for awesome Indian food Rangoli is a really good option without the hike up north."], ["Rebecca C.", "I was so happy Rangoli opened so close to me. I have had their food many times and delivery to my house is always on time. I have tried most of the menu all has been fabulous and my favs for sure are the Butter Chicken and the Vindaloo Shrimp.

I loved the palak paneer, which was light and fluffy with plenty of paneer, and the naan, which was flavorful and fresh. He liked the gobi manchurian, so I suggest those 3 dishes if you're into veggie dishes.We came right after work, because we were starving, and it was pretty early and for some reason it felt kind of awkward there. I suggest coming when it is busier and with just one other person or three other people (so your party is 2 or 4) because the set up is 2 or 4 person tables.

We tried the samosas here once or twice and weren't impressed; they may be decent eating in but take out was disappointing.The restaurant itself is nice and cozy. They're usually pretty busy most nights, and especially weekends, so expect a wait. The same goes for take out orders; it's usually the longer end of their estimated wait time.

This was ridiculously uncomfortable. Imagine a booth/chair set-up, but all of their booth sides had two plates at each table. There was no way that adults could sit here comfortably. I know it's because of the small space, but it's really degrading to the dining experience.I have to take off a full-star for this cheap set-up.As for the menu, it's classic Indian fare, which I love. They had a lot of staples there with a range between mild and super spicy. We kicked it off with the Gobi Manchurian. It's basically a garlicky, saucy, cauliflower appetizer. It was a little spicy, but not bad. It was a decent sized portion for three people.Then, we ordered Palak Paneer, Mutter Paneer, Malai Kofta, and Garlic Naan. It was served with a plate of basmati rice. It was all really delicious, but I have had better Palak Paneer. I couldn't really put my finger on what I didn't like about it, but I know I have had other palak paneer that I like better.All in all, it was pretty good. Our bill came to be about $60.

Well with Rangoli, I have finally found it. And best of all it is BYOB.We always start off with samosas here. They have two different type: lamb and veg. There are two samosas in each order and are huge. Not large but huge, like the size of genetically modified tomatoes big. We also started off with gobi manchurian, which is like Indian orange chicken. I think next time, I will order a different app. It was ok but not outstanding.We ordered two mains: butter chicken and vindaloo lamb. They come in small bowls. When the dishes arrived, I thought they were very small, but as always, my eyes were larger than my stomach. The mains come with rice which they attentatively refill. We ordered two garlic naan which were great too. The two mains were great. The vindaloo sooooo spicy, which my friend really liked as well as the wifey.

Delicious appetizer with a similar texture of sweet and sour pork).I haven't had Indian food in quite a while, so I was already excited for dinner. But everything was truly awesome.

Highlights were the samosas as well as the naans and the shrimp vindaloo. Chicken tikka masala wasn't bad but not as good as we've had back in London. The pastry shell of the samosas were cooked to perfection with a delicious savory filling, while the naans were doughy goodness.Definitely order the mango lassi as the yogurt in the drink helps lessen the spice.

They really are the best Indian food in the area. Most of the time.However, their delivery and take-out service is a bit of a problem. When picking up from the restaurant, they are almost never ready when they say they will be. Usually I am asked by at least two employees about my order, where I placed it, what I ordered, and they have to search through a mess of bags to find the order, while people pile up in the crowded front of the house.Still, that's better than ordering delivery. With a recent order we waited two hours for our food to arrive. During that time we could not get anyone at the restaurant to pick up the phone. All calls went directly to voice mail with a mailbox that was full. The delivery driver missed the delivery window the restaurant gave GrubHub by 45 minutes. When he called, he claimed to be waiting at the door, but was actually still driving down the street. He claimed he had just gotten the food (I was worried it would be cold). If that was the case, what was with all the bad estimates with GrubHub? On top of that, we got a sub-par portion of their Butter Chicken, usually the best thing they make.I understand a good restaurant gets busy, particularly on a rainy weekend evening like during this last order. I would hope that the management would be a little better at setting patron expectations, however, when this happens. If you're going to be late, ok, tell us.

For the breads I got the garlic naan and the onion kulcha. ALL OF IT was amazing. If anything the flavors of each item complimented each other really well. I'm usually not a big fan of curry, but this was a game changer. According to my friend you can't go wrong with any entree. But either way the gobi manchurian is a must!

Mutter paneer had fewer peas than usual and a hint of thai peanut sauce. My wife had chicken vindaloo. Upon consultation with the waiter, she had it \"medium\", which to her was very hot.

It was good overall."], ["Kerry D.", "This is the second time I've ordered delivery from Rangoli. Both times I have wait two or more hours for my food to arrive. Last night I called the restaurant when it had been 90+ from my order time. The man on the phone called the delivery driver, then told me my food would arrive in 5 minutes. Twenty minutes later I was about to call to cancel the order when my food finally arrived. The food was actually pretty tasty, but it doesn't blow me away. I'm definitely not willing to wait 2 hours for it, so I think I'll be ordering Cumin on Milwauke next time I want Indian food delivered."], ["Sarah S.", "Best Indian food in Chicago outside of Devon street. They have a South Indian influence, so the food tends to be a bit spicier and have more curry leaves and whole spices, which I love. Particularly recommend the Gobi Manchurian and Chicken Korma. If you are feeling adventurous, the Chicken Chettinad has a great flavor, but the spiciness level of molten lava. Large delivery area, but nice seating inside and BYOB,"], ["Akbar M.", "Restaurant is in a nice location and has a very warm and festive ambiance, but the service is horrible and the food was way too spicy. Even though we asked for it to be not too spicy."], ["Jenny H.", "Saturday night, 8pm at Rangoli:We stood around awkwardly at the entrance, until we noticed everyone else already got on \" the list\". We tracked down the guy with his pad of paper, \"thirty minutes\" he said. Silly man, trix are for kids. My coworker-friend and I continued to stand with wine in hand... for AN HOUR AND A HALF. Originally we were a group of six, but at last minute we were a group of four and a baby. Blessing in disguise because we would've had to wait longer.*Mango Lassi: delicious!*Gobi Manchurian: or \"chicken 65\", my coworkers really liked it because it was crispy rather than the conventional sauciness*Tarka Dhal: okay*Chicken Vindaloo: even on medium spiciness, we were all BURNING! Get dat yogurt!*Garlic Naan: generous portions, a little on the dry side*Roti: I preferred this over the naanI brought a bottle of Gew\u00fcrztraminer and paired super well with the spices. Loved the BYOB aspect, but after an atrocious wait, my coworkers (coincidentally ended up being all Indian) thought the food was only okay. I'd agree that it wasn't worth the super long wait. I wouldn't mind coming back, but with one other person and not on a busy saturday night."], ["Sarah V.", "My only grievance is that they don't take reservations. If you go on a Friday or Saturday evening be prepared to WAIT! I was told around 30 minutes and it was more like an 1 hour and 30 minutes. \u00a0The food is delicious though and very fresh which is why I keep going back despite the horrible wait times. I was able to find the tandoori chicken on their appetizer menu which seems to be the only grilled chicken item on the menu. Really good food and once you're seated it's good service too! I'll definitely go back, just not during their Saturday night stampede."], ["Karl C.", "Rangoli has decent food, but they have some of the worst staff and delivery I've ever seen. They take forever and their phone number only goes through like 3% of the time, so good luck if you need to get in touch with them. I've had terrible experience after terrible experience with them. They need to get shut down and replaced with an Indian restaurant that will actually complete an order and answer the phone."], ["Zach A.", "I really enjoyed this place, I thought I had to go to Devon and Western for good Indian! \u00a0The place was jumping when we arrived, I loved the BYOB. I can't wait to go back with my wife and some \u00a0friends."], ["Mark J.", "Excellent food!! :) fast service and very enjoyable!! And great delivery in the neighbourhood. Tasty, spicy, and happy they are here in humboldt park :)"], ["Srinivas P.", "The food was amazing, we had gobi manchurian which was really superb. Small space though, but the food tastes really authentic and they have fast service which really impressed me. One of the best Indian cuisine restaurant in Chicago."], ["Jennifer C.", "The manchurian cauliflower appetizer came out crispy and fried, looking like kungpao chicken but it did *not* taste anything like it (thank god). It was extremely crunchy outside and had the consistency and texture of potatoes inside.The kishiri naan was filled with dried fruits and spices but not overwhelming sweet, and went really well with the curry sauces. In fact it was rather light and not as greasy as other naan I've had. My malai kofta (chopped vegetables pressed together with cottage cheese and fried or baked, and served in curry) tasted like a veggie meatloaf and it was in a butter sauce. It was savoury and flavourful and textured much like falafel, but really could have been spicier. I know I could have asked for it hot though because there were no symbolic chilies next to my menu item. My roommate got a mango chicken curry and said he didn't taste mango but it was good nonetheless. He thinks it may have been mango puree. My dad had a chicken curry with cashew nut sauce and said it was adequately spicy; however the sauce tasted better than the chicken--go figure.It's nice that rice comes with each of the dishes as they are about $10-13 each, but very filling given the butter and full-fat yogurt-ridden content of the sauce. We were too full for dessert.The waiters looked sort of miserable but they were courteous and kept coming to refill our water. The ambiance is decent. Elephant-gilded chandeliers, hardwood chairs and seating close to the street available. (And if you're worried about that kind of thing: I didn't smell like curry when I came out.)"], ["Richard W.", "Let's get to it! \u00a0Chicken Tikka Masala was way too tomato-y (in other words not as creamy and seasoned as it should be). \u00a0The Lamb Vindaloo while very spicy was off somehow and the lamb itself was slightly overcooked. \u00a0The Keema Naan was okay. \u00a0The rice was fine, fluffy, but missing the added touch of saffron. \u00a0The keema samosa's were okay but a little underseasoned. Service was good and attentive."], ["Arsalan K.", "Rangoli is a nice place with a great ambiance. \u00a0The food is good, but the portions are tiny. \u00a0There is better food at more reasonable prices at numerous locations closer to Devon street. \u00a0However, if all you are looking for is good indian food with a great ambiance then this is your place. \u00a0I would say overall look elsewhere..."], ["Eliza B.", "My husband and I order take out from Rangoli probably once every couple of weeks and it never disappoints! Our favorite is the Chicken or Lamb Korma which is the best I've had anywhere! My husband also enjoys spicy foods and likes the Rogan Josh as well. The food is always top notch and comes in great portion size (we always have leftovers!). I've been in the restaurant once to eat but I have a lot of allergies to strong fragrances and the incense they burn in there was a little overpowering for me. However, the staff was friendly and service was prompt/attentive. Overall it's our go-to take out place and we love it. Highly recommend it if you enjoy Indian food!"], ["Gagandeep K.", "Went here with a group of friends. All I have to say is the food was amazing!!! Haven't had this kind of Indian food in a resturant. Make sure to make reservations, place is small. Will go back again and again!!!!!"], ["Jerrod B.", "Rangoli has quickly become my favorite restaurant in the neighborhood. I discovered Rangoli in November and I have probably dined there three times since, as well as ordering delivery from there once. Service is always attentive, and the food that was delivered was the same high quality as when I dined in.I have had numerous dishes at Rangoli and they have all been exceptional. Favorites of mine include the butter chicken, lamb rogan josh, and madras lamb korma. The appetizer gobi manchurian is also a unique dish, I normally don't care for cauliflower but the indian take on chinese food is quite tasty. All the different varieties of naan are also scrumptious. One thing I really appreciate is that they will spice the dishes to your specifications. Sometimes I don't want anything too spicy and they tone it down, other times I'm in the mood for a little heat and they leave me sweating.I would highly recommend a visit to Rangoli if you like Indian food. I've even brought family that usually don't like trying new things and they've found something on the menu to suit their tastes. It is also BYOB so you can save a few bucks on alcohol."], ["Kristin C.", "Eating Rangoli is like eating a hug. It is that good and it makes me that happy.I live near here and usually get takeout, because if you want to BYOB it and eat at Rangoli, you must eat EARLY in the evening; this place gets packed! When I did dine-in, the experience was lovely and the service spot-on. I was not familiar with Indian food and the waiter gave us great suggestions from spicy veggie dishes to delectable meat entrees. Now that I am more of a Rangoli regular, I always always order the same thing: Chicken Tikka Masala. It is so so so so delicious. I crave it. For an appetizer, I always must get the Gobi Manchurian. It. Is. Heaven.Rangoli is a Humboldt Park destination spot that everyone must try. If you like happiness, you will love Rangoli."], ["D M.", "The food is amazing, \u00a0but the delivery is horrible. \u00a0Expect to wait forever! \u00a0Typical delivery is over 2 hours.No phone number to call because it automatically goes to a full voicemail. The food is great, but not worth the hassle. \u00a0Oh and I live in humboldt park, \u00a0it's not a far delivery which is more than disappointing. \u00a0Peaquods delivers faster and answers the phone. Get a pizza!"], ["Nabila L.", "Loved, loved, loved Rangoli. My mouth is watering just thinking about their food again; I hadn't had Indian food that good in a very long time! I tried the onion bhajee and chicken tikka for starters. The chicken came sizzling and covered with fresh veggies, and was divine - a must try if you're dining here. The bhajee was my least favorite dish of the night, but don't get me wrong, it was still really good - very crispy and wonderfully spiced. It's just that compared to the rest of the excellent meal it was probably the dish I could do without. For entrees, we had the chicken vindaloo and the bhindi masala (an okra dish). We were warned that the vindaloo was very spicy, but I actually thought the bhindi was way spicier and there was little heat in the vindaloo in comparison. Both dishes were delicious, but do be wary about the spice in dishes that aren't marked as hot on the menu. We also got the garlic naan, which came fresh out of the oven and was smothered in fresh chopped garlic. It was delicious and paired perfectly when dipped into the vindaloo/masala. The portions in pictures may look deceivingly small, but we ended up having to take half our food home because there was so much. We each paid ~$25 which I thought was extremely reasonable given both the quality and quantity of food.The server was very attentive, and made sure we always had water. He overheard me mention to my friend that we didn't have knives, and he came over with a couple right away. The host was cold and scowl-y which I normally wouldn't give a crap about when the food is this good, but he was much friendlier to another party which was really off putting (and the reason I can't give 5 stars). Regardless, I recommend Rangoli to anyone looking for some absolutely fantastic food, that's also reasonably priced!"], ["Katie G.", "I love Rangoli. Like, love, love, love. My favorite place to order Indian from in Chicago. It's become my comfort ~treat yourself~ place due to the price but in my opinion it's always been totally worth it. I've gotten delivery from here pretty consistently over the past year. I'd say definitely over ten times and I've never had an issue. But tonight, hoo boy, tonight we had issues. I ordered at 6:54 and was given an estimate of 8:20-8:30 which I wasn't bothered by at all. Hey! It's a Friday night, I get it! When 8:30 rolled around, I didn't panic because, again, busy nights are busy nights! Totally understand. When 10pm hit without word from rangoli or grubhub, I began to change my tune. Couldn't get through via phone, so I contacted grubhub who did the legwork for me. Was told the driver was on their way and to expect my food by 10:08ish. Cool. Finally! Yay! Well as I write this it is 10:58pm. Rangoli has now been closed for almost an hour. No one is answering the phone. Haven't heard a peep from the delivery driver. I get that delivery sucks for restaurants on busy nights. I really do. And I hate complaining after spending the majority of my formative years in customer service. But this is bad. I would have rather they just canceled my order than stretch this out this long. I don't relish the idea of getting cold food after four hours of waiting, if I get it at all. \u00a0So...I don't know. Eat in or order extremely early. I probably won't be doing either anymore which is a shame."], ["Jen U.", "I really want to give Rangoli 5 stars... I really, really do. They are the best Indian food you can get without being near Devon Ave. The food is always delicious and runs on the spicier side. It's not the cheapest but it's also not the most expensive I've had. Based on the food alone, they deserve 5 stars and I can't bring myself to give the restaurant 3 stars. \u00a0So why no 5th star, Rangoli?Their delivery service. Their delivery times are consistently 90+ minutes. It doesn't matter when I order, how well I tip my driver, or how often I order. I only live maybe 10 minutes away. I don't know if they need an extra driver or what but the day they can get their delivery times under 60 minutes will be the day I give them 5 stars.The joke is really on me though because I'll keep ordering from them no matter how much my stomach grumbles while I wait. The food is worth it."]]}
