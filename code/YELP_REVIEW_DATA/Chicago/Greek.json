{"Pegasus Restaurant & Taverna": [["Renaud S.", "Had diner there on Saturday night. We arrived around 8PM and the place wasn't fully booked inside - but they had a little bit of waiting for their rooftop, so we decided to seat inside.A friend who never had Greek food was here with me, so I wanted to give him a nice overview of this delicious cuisine.We first ordered Haloumi as appetizers - they were really good, small portions but very tasty.Then, he had the Pikilia #1, which seemed to be very good. He had me tried some of the dishes and they were all very good. I ordered Spanakopita, I had a small appetite that night, but it was extremely tasty.Also their bread is good - this is something I like a lot in Greek restaurants, the bread and butter.Finally, service was really good, our waiter was extremely nice to us - I appreciate a lot!Great experience!"], ["Jake C.", "A) I am well aware the Greek wine I ordered was not a sherry, I did not mention anything about sherry when ordering. I don't drink sweet wine, most sherries are actually not sweet FYIB) Server was a condescending snob, grouchy 70 something year old. C) Yes I asked for more tomatoes, when I asked server shook his head and stormed off.D) What the hell does it mean when I, as a paying customer, is asked by my server, \"your not from around here, are you?\" Supposed to mean? F) I did not order feta, I ordered goat cheese. The server said the goat cheese was from Malta. Yes it was highly salty compared to what I have had at other establishments nearby. I can assure you all of my experiences in my original review are accurate. Thank you for your concern."], ["Mike M.", "First off, this is NOT the best Greek restaurant in Greek town. That would be, hands down, Greek Islands. If Greek seafood is what you want in a more intimate environment, without the noise and ooopa, then Santorini is the place. But, if you would like a warm friendly place to go, drink some reasonably priced cocktails and eat some decently good Greek, after parking your car with free valet parking, in Greek town .............. all while sitting on the nicest rooftop patio in or around the Chicago loop, then Pegasus is the ONLY place to go. Seriously, the Pegasus rooftop is great. Now if only Greek Islands food was served there."], ["Emil V.", "I don't often leave Yelp reviews, nor do I often find anything of value when I read those posted by others, but last night I had the most enjoyable evening at Pegasus!It started while I was waiting for my guest to arrive at the bar with the enchanting bartender Brooke. \u00a0She suggested a light and fruity white wine from Greece but the name of which escapes me. Brooke was extremely inviting and friendly and even offered a couple of menu suggestions for my approaching dinner.When my guest arrived we were seated by a friendly hostess, were met promptly with water, and shortly after our server greeted us and introduced himself. \u00a0He eloquently described the specials for the evening and quickly brought us our drinks from the bar. \u00a0Not being a foodies or Greeks, we had so many questions about the expansive menu. \u00a0This is where I was most impressed. Howard was able to answer every question we lobbed at him. \u00a0When my guest asked for a couple of vegetarian options he quickly pointed out three specific dishes that all sounded delicious! She had a vegetarian pasta with artichokes and sun dried tomatoes that even my carnivorous self couldn't help but want to taste.I had the tomato braised Colorado lamb (a confirmed suggestion by our server and bartender.) This was possibly the most tender, moist, flavorful lamb preparation I've ever had. Couple that with delicious Greek style green beans and I was in heaven!For dessert Howard convinced us to step outside the box and try the house made Greek yogurt with \u00a0dates, pears and figs. \u00a0I will never be able to eat another Chobani again. \u00a0This yogurt was light and fluffy and the dates and figs with honey was just the perfect amount of sweetness. I can't wait to return to Pegasus to try more of the items on the menu. I highly recommend chatting with Brooke at the bar or Howard at a table, they will guide you through your meal effortlessly, all while delivering flawless service."], ["Dolores Z.", "We headed to the rooftop on a perfect Friday summer night. Free valet service, no parking headaches, pleasant and speedy service.We were seated within minutes, though the place was pretty full. Waters on tables within minutes, rolls, too. Our server, Bojanna, brought menus promptly, and wine list when we requested it. We chose a young, light, Greek white. Refreshing, and delicious. Tableside chiller. Small plates only on the rooftop! We started with saganaki, not served aflame, but hot, fresh, and good. Horiatiki salad, fresh and light. Zucchini chips, shrimp on a skewer, meatballs with potatoes. All tasty, except sauce for meatballs was a bit too salty for my taste.We finished the evening with rice pudding and a couple of Greek coffees -strong, small and smooth, as they should be. Server was very helpful and friendly, gave great info and suggestions. Great atmosphere, skyline view. The only bad part is the season up there is so short. Can't wait to return. Opaa!"], ["Michael R.", "I've eaten at most of the Greektown establishments over the years and recently tried Pegasus for the first time. \u00a0 It pales in comparison to the nearby standards in terms of service, food quality and value.I was part of a decent-sized party on a Friday evening (8:00 reservation and the dining room was 2/3 full when we were seated for context) and we were there for 2 1/2+ hours and only 2 of us had drinks and no one ordered dessert. \u00a0 The server would be around but wouldn't offer to refill drinks. \u00a0 We received 1 basket of bread and even after ordering a tzatziki appetizer, two orders of saganaki and other dishes, weren't asked about or offered more bread until after ordering dinner.Beers were room temperature-a frosted mug only does so much. \u00a0Entrees and sides were average at best. \u00a0Pork souvlaki was the best item that 2 of us ordered. \u00a0 Potatoes and rice were bland, and moussaka, a staple at Greek restaurants had almost no b\u00e9chamel sauce and was dry.I was fairly surprised at the total bill-I am ready to spend money when dining out and particularly in Chicago-but didn't feel it was worth the price. \u00a0I'll revisit other spots and recommend others do the same."], ["Joseph P.", "Was craving seafood, but was unfortunate enough to be located in the Midwest region. However, I was told that this place's probably got one of the best seafood cuisine in Chicago. On top of that, I never had Greek cuisine before, so naturally I had to give it a go. I heard a lot about the infamous appetizer known as the \"flaming cheese\". The waiter brought it over and literally lit the cheese on fire on a metal plate that is also abundant in alcohol and olive oil. The flaming process fried the cheese and gave it a crispy exterior while maintaining an interior of melted cheese. Exquisite! \u00a0My sister in law also ordered baby octopus as an appetizer. They not only grilled the baby octopus to give it a little charred flavor, but it was so well done that the texture of the octopus transformed from soft to chewy. Talk about satisfaction!For main dish, I chose to go with lamb cut with seasoned artichoke hearts. I find myself astounded by the texture of the lamb. For it to be so juicy and tender requires a lot of work, especially for lamb. The dish is covered with a cheesy sauce that appear heavy at first, but surprisingly easy to eat. Definitely would come here more often if not for the fact that I am watching my weight...but hey! Treating yourself once in awhile can't hurt :)"], ["Frank T.", "The food was fantastic. Saganaki X 2. The portion size of the gyro appetizer was huge. The 3 meatballs appetizer were excellent and huge. The only negative was our server was grumpy and slow. \u00a015 minutes to get a glass of wine."], ["Michael C.", "Really disappointing. We had intended to go to Greek Islands, but they had electrical problems and were closed. We reluctantly walked across the street to Pegasus, well aware of the 3.5 rating on Yelp. Overrated, as we were soon to learn. NB: I visit Greece several times a year on business. I lived in Athens for several years as a youth. Greek cuisine is my favorite cuisine. I've eaten at good tavernas and bad tavernas. I'm perfectly happy with average taverna fare. We asked to be served mezedes style, as we ordered saganaki (I know...my daughter wanted it), kalamari, horiatiki, horta, and the lambchop plate. They brought out each dish individually: first saganaki, 15 minutes later the kalamari, 15 minutes later the salad. When the older Greek gentleman (owner?) stopped by the table, I had to specifically ask that the Horta and lamb plate be brought out at the same time.I would have been embarrassed as a Greek to have served the horiatiki salad with a laughable solitary 1 inch cube of feta (no exaggeration) on top. I mentioned it to the Greek, and he brought out a dainty plate with 5 more little cubes (well after our salad was finished). If this were an American run place, I could forgive, but the presence of Greeks in the building made this particularly egregious. They could not keep their hands off of our plates. The wait staff kept trying to remove dishes from the table that still had food in it, plates from in front of us that still had our food on it. The first time it happened, we asked nicely to leave them as we're still finishing. The second time, I was annoyed. The third time, we laughed and pleaded \"Please stop touching the plates!,\" to which the waiter defended the busboy by saying \"He's just doing his job.\" We understood that as an indication of him being equally annoyed with us.The food quality was not bad (I.e. nothing tasted bad), but it was below average and less than what I would expect from a Greek-run restaurant. They know better, and based on other reviews here in Yelp, the ownership has no interest in improving their service or their food quality so that it is a more authentic experience."], ["Jackie H.", "Poor customer service, unacceptable way to be treated in a restaurant let alone any service based industry. No need to discuss further as you read the reviews, I wish I had yelped first."], ["Pete C.", "The service was great and that's why I gave 4 stars. The staff was friendly and courteous. Free valet parking was a plus! Ability to make reservations on Open Table app was nice too. The food was good. Saganaki is always a crowd favorite an was great. The mussels had good flavor as our appetizers. My main entree off the specials menu of the Lamb was pretty good. I wish it had more au jus on the plate. My lamb chops were good but tended to be slightly dry and over cooked. The spinach rice kind of disappointed me, it had a creamy spinach mixed into the rice which was also mushy. The 2 put together had the same texture and I thought it would have been better with a harder rice texture. My wife had the oven roasted chicken, which was really good. The roasted vegetables and potatoes were done perfectly. We also splurged on the desserts with the baklava and rice pudding. The baklava was made just right with the texture and not over powered with the syrup. The rice pudding was made nicely as well. All in all it was a good time with good food and great service."], ["Tom H.", "A really nice dinner here. Started with a big bowl of avgolemono, a rich cream of chicken with rice soup that you squeeze a half lemon into before enjoying, accompanied by a loaf of good Greek white bread, with its crisp crust covered in sesame seeds, dipped in excellent Greek olive oil. \u00a0For my main course I had \"Pikalia #2\", one of the two combo specials. A huge plate of lamb, chicken, rice, pastitsio (kind of a lasagne of elbow macaroni and ground beef), spinakopita spinach pie and potato. To drink, I had a 500 Ml bottle of cold retsina, a white wine flavored with pine, which is a bit of an acquired taste, but if you 'get it\" is crisp and refreshing, cutting through the richness of the food. \u00a0I then carried my last glass of wine up to the rooftop deck, with it's breathtaking view of the skyline, to toast the sunset. It wasn't quite like drinking to the sunset in Santorini, but close enough."], ["Evie H.", "So the food is closer to a 3 just because it's very very salty and you will need a lot of liquids for the night. However, our service was excellent and we were given pretty good recommendations. Plus, the rooftop dining area gave us a relaxing late afternoon in the sunshine and breeze. Basically, an overall pleasant trip had me rounding this up to a 4. \u00a0I came for post-work tapas with 3 of my co-workers and we very much indulged in a whole slew of dishes after a busy day. I think tapas are a great option for small groups that want to try a ton of different plates at a reasonable price. I would recommend getting a couple of dishes to start off and then adding more if stomach allows.Soutzoukia - The meat balls are delicious but the sauce tastes like Greek pasta sauce. Skippable or not depending on how much you really like meatballs. Gyros - Awesome! Comes with lots of beef and lamb. Very flavorful but salty to the max.Dolma - Excellent homemade yogurt sauce on the side. The dolma was standard.Souvlakia - Pork kabobs! One of my favorite plates but also very salty.Arni Kebob - A good choice if you're into lamb. I thought this was just average but lamb isn't really my thing. Melitzanosalata - This grilled eggplant spread with pita bread is such a good appetizer if you're looking for a lighter type of spread. Tirokafteri - This one is a spicy feta and cheesy spread with pita. I wouldn't say this was spicy at all and it's heavier and saltier than the eggplant one but I still enjoyed it."], ["Valerie B.", "So what I ate was tasty but it was a strange meal overall. Service was lacking. They didn't come over enough to check in. My food wasn't right. I ordered a gyro meal and then got a gyro salad. I knew it wasn't right but didn't complain because as I stated above it was tasty. And in the end it did save me a few bucks, so there's that I guess... \u00a0Then when we were trying to pay the bill, my friend and I were splitting it on two credit cards and the employee took them and then was gone for I'd say at least ten minutes. He finally came over and said it would just be another second but if the system is down, tell people a little faster so we're not confused about what's happened to our cards. Really I'd give the service tonight probably just two stars. Shame since my friend raved about this place. My friend liked her spanakopita. It looked good and big, nice portion size. My friends salad wasn't nothing to write home about. \u00a0And my gyro salad was good but way, way, way too much dressing and sauce. I didn't care for my 'apple pie' dessert but my friends liked the lemon dessert they shared. I wouldn't jump to come back here which is a shame because I love Greek food and the restaurant is pretty. It has a nice feel. Oh well \u00a0we'll see what happens."], ["Bee F.", "Food was amazing! Missed a star all because the water service delayed and I was thirsty. Other than that, nice environment. Friendly staff. OPA!"], ["Gemma D.", "Pegasus is amazing. Beautiful inside, great authentic food. The waiter, Alexander, was amazing, it was his first day and he treated us like family.

We've been wanting to try Greek in Chicago, and this place was a GREAT representation of what Greek food is!! When you first get there, they offer complimentary valet!!!! \u00a0When you enter the restaurant, the atmosphere was very nice. Tablecloths on the tables, candles lit, and then lots of color!! The welcome in was very nice and made me feel at home. It's important to be \"inviting\" upon arrival. When we sat down there was bread of different kinds brought to the table, with a tall bottle of olive oil to be poured on the plates for dipping the bread in. We ordered the Saganaki, which is also known as \"the flaming cheese\". They have the cheese centered and pour Greek alcohol on it, then light it in fire......followed by the ever so popular word, \"OPA\"... It was time to try the cheese, and it was delicious!!! \u00a0We ordered a fantastic Greek salad with kalamata olives, fresh tomatoes, onions, and lemon juice with olive oil....topped with a nice squared slice of feta cheese, (of which we both wished there was more of)..For the main dishes we ordered the Kotopoulo Fournou and the Moshari Tashkebob. The Kotopoulo is a half chicken with oregano, olive oil, and lemon juice. It is served with potato riganatti and roasted vegetables. The Moshari is beef cooked in a wine tomato sauce served over rice pilaf, which happens to be Orzo. These dishes had so much flavor, it was unbelieveable!!!It was an overall amazing dinner, and it was beautiful!!! \u00a0We are definitely going back there!!! *****If you're going to Chicago or if you live there and haven't been to this place. Please go there!!!!! I promise you won't be disappointed and you will be thanking me later!!!***** OPA!!!!!!"], ["Samantha S.", "The highlight of the visit was definitely our server. He made our meal much more enjoyable. We were nearing the end of our vacation and had a very cranky toddler when we met up with family here. The server was so kind and friendly with our son. Our son absolutely loved him. Probably because he kept giving my son treats like cherries. Then he would yell \"opa!\" For my son which he loved and mimicked for the rest of the day. The food was great. Plenty of food was served to us. I had saganaki, salad, moussaka and baklava. Everything tasted fresh and delicious. Valet was kind enough to help us flag down a taxi afterwards.

He even made friends with my 6 month old daughter. Throughout the night, she kept looking for him. As soon as she saw him, she giggled, smiled, or gave him \"raspberries\". Frank even offered her something to eat. When Greek Islands has a 15-40 min. wait time, just walk over to Pegasus. You get a good meal and great service in a shorter amount of time. We recommend getting their yogurt with honey, figs, and apricots for dessert with Greek coffee medium sweet. \u00a0The yogurt is made in house, so it has a milder taste. Also, we recommend trying their daily specials. I had a braised lamb shank with carrots and artichoke hearts. Lastly, just for fun, get the saganaki!"], ["Tony P.", "Probably the worst dining experience I've ever had downtown. \u00a0The portions were small and overpriced.

I'm tired of places giving out the cold, rice only version which I read as \"cheap\" so this gets extra credit in my book. The gyros strips were dry and should have been tossed out IMO but I had come for authentic Greek food. The spinach pie was a delight, much like grandma used to make. Even the potato gets high marks! They put chicken in the egg lemon soup which I'm not accustomed to so we'll give that a plus as well.I also had a Greek brandy Metaxa for $5.

((Then again, any meal that cost more than 5 bucks or didn't consist of ramen noodles was typically pretty darn good.)) From what I remember I would have given it 4 to 5 stars. Now, I'm stretching for 3.Does the atmosphere remind you of something straight out of Greece? Sure. I assume so anyhow. Either way, it's cute and different in a Greek family home kind of way. No modern and contemporary designs here. However, the food lacked a little something to be desired and the service a whole lot more. Don't get me wrong. The food wasn't bad. In fact, it was pretty good. Just not for the price tag. Example: 15 bucks for a plate of gyros? I expected those babies to be top notch, otherwise I would have walked a half of a block and grabbed one from Mr. Greeks, which is equally as good and a third of the price. I ordered the Yuvetsaki ((a fave from my college days)) and found it to have the same delicious flavors, but was significantly more salty and oily this time. The braised beef could have been a lot more tender as well. Boo. I did love the baklava, saganaki, and the dolmas. But again, kind of expensive for what you get. The service left me irritated. Our server was very hands off and often scarce. When he did wait on us, each of our requests felt like we were putting him out. I didn't think that asking for water and lemon was a big deal. Thank goodness the server filling up the puny water glasses was on top of it or I would have been taking numerous trips to the bar for refills. But, the best was yet to come. We ordered a couple rounds of Ouzo and was fairly grossed out to find hot pink lipstick residue on some of the glasses. Gross. I don't want to know where those bright pink lips have been. When we told the waiter, we got them replaced with nothing more than a shrug. No comp, no apology. Nothing. Would I go back? Eh. Maybe. I'm confident in saying I would try somewhere else first.Furthermore, I think I need to stop living in the past and off of nostalgic memories.

Knowing we wanted to try something different, he suggested we try Greek. we arrived and were greeted and seated. Our waitress Gigi was very attentive and described several dishes to us. We ordered our food and then a bottle of wine. Everything was very good. We had lamb, a baked shrimp and orzo pasta dish and spanikopta. I rarely \u00a0order desert, but we were enjoying ourselves so much and everything was so good, we indulged. Great food, great service!"], ["George R.", "For being named after what is presumably one of mythology's faster animals, the service doesn't match up. We waited forever for our water to arrive, then longer for our server to greet us. Then another long period passed before he took our order. Our food took forever to arrive too, and we had a long wait between each course. The flaming saganaki was enjoyable as always, but I thought it was kind of bland and not as good as the flaming saganaki at Parthenon. The Kolokithakia was probably the highlight of the meal (pre dessert) for me. The veggie Mousaka and Spanakopitakia were okay - average, no complaints. I really enjoyed the homemade Greek yogurt with caramelized fruit for dessert - and this was probably my favorite part of the meal. I'd say this place would be average/3 stars if the service was better, but for now, two it is."], ["David S.", "Great night to sit out on the patio.

Our server was fantastic as well and made great recommendations. If you're in the mood for Greek, look no further."], ["Nick S.", "I would recommend the combination plate, plus their Greek village salad. They have a rooftop that is awesome.

I was immediately greeted by a *very* friendly host who gave me a flower, which I put in my hair, and seated us in a busy section, though there were a number of open tables throughout the rest of the place. We quickly learned that our waiter had been working all day and was extremely tired and beyond caring what kind of impression he made. I wondered why the host didn't seat us in the fresher, more energetic waiter's section, but it seemed that was too far away from his wandering eye?It took a while for us to order and receive our drinks, and the flaming saganaki came out with a half-hearted Opa... It was delicious, however, and we proclaimed little Opas! of our own over the salty lemony gooeyness in front of us. For my entree I had the spanakopita and this is always kind of a bland, but still good plate of food, no matter where you have it. I liked it, but as a plate it's kind of colorless and not exciting. I'm all about a regular home-cooking kind of place that doesn't add foams and useless garnishes just to make their plates look pretty, but when you get a white plate with a colorless square on it that has some dark green and white coming out of it, you kind of wish for a tomato or something to brighten things up.When I asked to submit my groupon, my phone disappeared for what seemed like a very long time and I had to wonder whether I was going to get it back with the kitchen-staffs' dirty pictures on it. The decor and service were tired, but in one case (overly) friendly, and the food was good and appropriately-priced, but not spectacular. I'd give this place another chance though, if only to get another blossom for my updo."], ["Jaime G.", "Roof top is awesome. Food is really good but service is lacking.

I had fried zucchini from the appetizers with fantastic tzaziki sauce. The yogurt in the cucumber sauce tasted very fresh. We had wonderful Greek coffee for dessert.

We had terrible and slow service. I was expecting the slow part, but not for the waiter to call us names. Plus, the food was even worse than expected.

The waitress was very knowledgable and helpful. First drinks were simply spectacular. Very smooth made to perfection, appetizers were also extremely good. Olive oil and bread exceeded my expectations. Main dish was ordered off the daily special which is not on the menu and various regional dishes was amazing. Some of the best lamb I've ever had, the potatoes were so different yet so good. Desert was a raspberry chocolate piece of cake which put the finish on a great meal. Highly recommend listening to your waiter or waitress on the specials. Upstairs has a full bar and a buffet which is perfect on a summer night. This is a must return."], ["Jennie C.", "YUM! Came in to use my voucher and really loved the bright, airy space the moment I walked in. Maybe because it was Monday evening, the restaurant wasn't as noisy and hectic as Greek Island across the street. We started with the always popular saganaki, then two lamb entrees. The lamb loin was tender but a tad dry in some places. Friend's leg of lamb was juicy and melt-in-mouth tender. Would've been perfect if it came with some veggies rather than two giant potato balls. We ended with creme caramel, which was a bit too rich and sweet for my taste. Service was excellent. Also gotta love the complimentary valet parking. This could very well be my favorite Greektown restaurant. Highly recommended."], ["Shradha A.", "Enjoyed their patio dining on the rooftop. Service was very patient and quick for a 12-person table. They only serve small plates upstairs but we enjoyed such a large vegetarian menu option. Especially enjoyed the dolma and warm/fresh pita with the various dips!"], ["Shera L.", "I wanted to like this place. I really did. I heard about it from a friend of mine who highly recommended this joint for some authentic Greek food. I think they forgot to make Greek food; it was more like low-budget Italian food. Think a step below the Olive Garden. My dish had so much oil in it I had to pour it out on a separate plate, and it was suffocated in a garlicky cheese. There are places out south that I can go to get the same quality of food for seven dollars a plate, but with more flavor. However these plates cost an astronomical 20 bucks each. My husband and I also got mixed drinks, which were also horrible. My husband's drink was very watery, and mine had way too much thyme syrup. I only drank about a quarter of it. How horrible! It's Christmas Eve! I want a buzz not a sugar rush. * insert sad face* We also had the meatball appetizer, which tasted more like an authentic Greek dish so if anything get that, even though that was only just okay as well. Overall I think this place would've been right on time for a greasy spoon joint if the prices mirrored the quality of the food and I was drunk and hungry as hell. I'm definitely never eating Greek food in the city again. I'll just have to travel to Greece for the real deal.

She says yes why do u ask? Waitress then says because u tipped me so low. A bill like this is normally a 20% tip. Teresa went in her pocket to give her another $8 and walked down the stairs. Yep I had something to say once she told me what happened. First of all I'm not required to tip you anything and u will not tell me how much to tip.

And when you open them, the decor and waitstaff will only help your imagination along!This place is CROWDED and for good reason, but the staff and managers seem to have an awesome system that files people in and out in no time, aka: there is virtually no wait for a table, regardless of the number in your party. There was three of us and immediately we were directed to our table, that overlooked the kitchen... Now for the tasty details! Here's what we ordered:- Eggplant Dip: simple yet tasty as hell thanks to the garlic and the creamy texture - Flaming Cheese: smelled like what heaven must smell like, which means it obviously tasted good too.- Grilled Octopus: my favorite thing ever, grilled octopus is chewy, yet sweet, yet meaty, and just hands down delicious!- Grilled Squid: I actually think I liked this dish better than the octopus as it was a bit crispier (without being fried) and the tentacles were PERFECTLY COOKED!- Whole Roasted Seabass: go big or go home, so I went big and got the whole Seabass, bones and all, and pretty much sucked every morsel of meat off that sucker. Had to get my money's worth, not like it was all that hard considering they give you a WHOLE FISH for $20.95!- Two sides of Vegetables: I don't like potatoes and our server listened to me and made sure to serve me up two sides that had minimal potatoes in them. These stewed veggies kicked some serious ass! Reminded me of my dad's cooking!- Moussaka: I know my friend LOVES THIS... Because even though she was pretty full when the main event arrived, she still tried her best to finish it, alas: she did get a doggy bag so she could make her co-workers JEALOUS at lunch the next day!- Salad with Gyro Meat: my friend who got this really wishes she didn't load up on McDonalds right before coming to dinner! The meat was flavorful but not dripping in fat. Lent a wonderful flavor to the salad greens. - Salad with Cheese: this went down the hatch in five seconds. Clearly a winner. If I could, and honestly, I really think I could convince them, I would go back to The Greek Islands again tonight and re-order the grilled calamari... And then order other items on the menu I wanted... It would honestly be a whole new experience because there are so many different offerings!! I'd probably devour the salmon and swordfish.

When we got to Greek Islands, I was immediately blown away by the atmosphere of the restaurant. I feel like they really went out of their way to make the place feel authentically greek. Once we were seated, we decided to order the saganaki because obviously, and it was absolutely wonderful. I then ordered a dish from the Saturday specials menu with slow roasted chicken.

The menu had 5 pieces of chicken was included. We only got 4. And the 2 pieces of dark meat and drumstick were small. And then on top of that half the meat on both drumsticks were missing.

Your water/ice tea gets refilled and the waiter always checks in without being intrusive. Memorable dishes include the saganaki, the Greek salad, and the gyros.

I could go on and on about my experience working at Greek restaurants, working at a restaurant IN Greece, my grandmothers recipes, my mother cooking them all my life, Greek citizenship, yadda yadda yadda, but I won't. \u00a0First things first: The staple of Greek food, the reason why it's so good, is that everything is always fresh, which is why I was disappointed from the get-go. \u00a0Everything tasted and felt like it had come out of a pan prepared at the beginning of the week. EVERY item we ordered was bland and lacked even basic seasonings outside of salt. \u00a0EVERY dish was overly oiled and greasy. \u00a0Cold spread Sampler: the taramo had no flavor outside of salt and was a weird neon pink, there was no lemon in it. \u00a0The melitzanosalata tasted like it had been sitting in the fridge for about two weeks. The tirokafteri was the saving grace. \u00a0The bread was tasteless, and we had to ask for pita.Saganaki: the reason you light this fried cheese on fire with cheap brandy is because it has no taste. It was sliced way too thin, and as soon as you cut it, it loses shape and flops around in the oil in the pan.Salad: the fresh dill in the Marouli salad tasted like it had been harvested weeks before, and the salad didn't even have any cheese in it, so there was no rounding out of flavors. The cheese would have added salt, and was the one dish that desperately needed it in the dressing.Main: She went for the Pastichio, I went for one of my favorites, Keftedes. I thought it would be the one thing they couldn't screw up. \u00a0 Neither of us finished more than half our dishes, I couldn't bring myself to try hers, but it was covered in this thin tomato sauce that looked like it had come out of a can. \u00a0I'm guessing it was the same that was dumped on my dry, flavorless meatballs sitting sadly on the plate. Nothing in this place tasted fresh, it all felt like it had been sitting for days in a vat, then loaded on a plate, put under a heat lamp, and served. \u00a0I was heartbroken, all I wanted was something familiar; the comfort food I grew up with. \u00a0I paid up and will stick to the two remaining high quality Greek places in the city in Lakeview and Bucktown."], ["Andrea G.", "greek islands is our go to place for dinner, anytime.lambchops outstanding! fish outstanding! vegetable dishes! outstanding!atmosphere is lively and happy. waiters are fantastic.I am getting hungry just writing this review."], ["Rita S.", "The \"cheese on fire\" is delicious.

The gyro meat was perfectly seasoned and a good sized portion. The salad was average. Of the main course options my favorite was the pork on the spit.

Moved on to a cup of Avgolemono soup which was spectacular. Next came the big decision of The entr\u00e9e. I went with the combination plate recommended by our server.

Great service! Delicious & bountiful menu."], ["Jeff J.", "Almost 1,000 reviews for this Greektown spot, what can I add?Like that's really going to deter me. Not.Went here for the first time for an event luncheon. Sunday around noon this huge restaurant was packed, but we had a dedicated crew of servers in a private room. Course after course was served, plates were cleared, silverware replaced, water glasses filled--it was professional in the extreme. We even got a visit from Gus, who apparently owns or founded this restaurant, wears a cap, and provides local color.Appetizers included saganaki, tzatziki, taramosalata, gyro and feta salad. The tzatziki was awesome, really tart and refreshing, and the gyro (a combination of beef and lamb) was well-seasoned and moist. The firm block of feta cheese was nice, not too salty. Main courses were endless. Among the ones I tried, the roast lamb was tender and tasty, the chicken kabobs well seasoned and just a tad dry, and the vegetarian moussaka was delish. These came with a sort of Greek ratatouille (briami) that was terrific. The desserts--all the usual suspects--were pretty ordinary.The only dish I had a problem with was the taramosalata. It was overly-whipped to the consistency of air, did not taste of fish at all, and was bright pink, the exact color of Pepto-Bismol. That color must result from food coloring and additives; it cannot exist in the real world. Krinos Taramosalata in a jar is better.So for an event lunch in a nice room with very generous servings (and containers offered for taking home the leftovers), this place cannot be faulted for its hospitality. \u00a0Overall I liked the food. \u00a0I did leave with one question, however--who eats like this at noon on Sunday? Answer: plenty of people, judging by the crowd here."], ["Tish D.", "A Chicago favorite! \u00a0If you want great Greek food, you go to Greek Town and this is the only place to dine.

Let's start with \"Getting into Greek Islands\" (or anywhere else in that general vicinity). You basically have a ton of cars trying to park depending on how busy it is, which also happen to be waiting on the free valet as mentioned. \u00a0So might you be waiting? Absolutely? Is it also now somewhat hazardous to try to get out of your car to even get into the restaurant? You bet.Thus is the pain of a successfully busy area. Not only do you have a crazy valet line, you have a crazy waitlist as well. \u00a0I think we waited about 20-30 minutes before we got a table that worked for us.With that said, getting in basically sucks. When you're in however, you're heading into good, good greek food. You really can't go wrong with food at Greek islands. As long as you know your greek, you're heading towards amazing things.The grilled pork is amazing (yes, I had meat), the vegetarian options are awesome - I could eat tzatziki with grilled vegetables every day of my life, and all in all the food is good. The gigantes are also uniquely made here and so good that we made them at home as a result. I strongly suggest them. It's not hard to make a meal just out of appetizers., Really not much can be said other than \"eat here\", which is notable and good. \u00a0Oh yeah, and try the muscat wine. I warn you that it's really strong (muscat is extra fermented/extra alcohol), but also sweet and delicious. \u00a0Food/drink/appetizer, you can't go wrong.Uniquely: for the musicians such as myself who are coming here after orchestra concerts, coat check will accept fullsize instruments (such as my cello)."], ["Leon W.", "Everything is so tasty...even wines are good.Little bit salty but tasty.These are what I tried.

Wish I had known about Greek Islands prior to then as it's definitely my favorite spot in Greektown (Athena was my prior #1). Started off with a Greek beer and three apps - the flaming cheese, grilled octopus, and dolmades. Flaming cheese tasted like the best part of a pizza (the cheese thats a little too warm and might be a tad overcooked). It was phenomenal though I did miss out on the initial tableside lighting (it came over already on fire). The octopus had a nice char to it. The dolmades were solid as well. For dinner I went with one of the lamb specials and it's was excellent. It was lamb cooked in a tomato sauce with orzo. The lamb was very tender (flakes with a fork) and the orzo was a nice compliment. I definitely recommend sticking the bread into the sauce as opposed to just butter (or ovo). The rest of my table also got specials (two different lamb dishes and one got pork schwarma). Everyone really liked their meals. Perhaps too much as there was no room for dessert."], ["Jasmine B.", "Great food, fun atmosphere and a great place for groups. I had the spinach pie, which was tasty.

A few refills on water, and within 10 minutes or so, I was through with the gyro. It was alright - pita was great, not enough tzatziki or tomato, plenty of onions and unfortunately the gyro meat was relatively dry.

So filling, so yummy.I didn't love the wine we were suggested to get after they were out of all 3 bottles I tried to get. Wine selection is very limited and mediocre. And I always judge restaurants by the wine glasses. The glasses here are tiiiiiiny. Also, I've had much better baklava elsewhere. But the slice is huge.Good savory, not so good on the sweets and wine. But... Worth the savory!"]], "Taxim": [["Greg D.", "What a great find in the Wicker Park neighborhood! We stumbled on this place after making a pilgrimage to nearby Violet Hour. The space feels very Mediterranean and features beautiful high ceilings and Greek Orthodox looking iconography. Though I have not visited Greece, it certainly made me feel that I had found a little piece of it in the US. Our server was super sweet and her enthusiasm for the cuisine was infectious. She recommended a great Greek wine to go with our varied meal of mezze that paired beautifully with everything we tried. I was really impressed with the wine list that featured a wide spectrum of seldom seen Greek wines. Standout dishes were the lamb sausage, lentils with barrel-aged sheep feta, grilled octopus, and grape leaf wrapped shrimp. Presentation of the food was rustic, simple, and elegant. The flavors of the dishes were refined and everything we ate was perfectly cooked and seasoned. If I lived in Chicago, Taxim would be a once a month place for me. Highly recommended!"], ["Meredith K.", "We came here for our 9th anniversary. They couldn't have cared less. LOL! We were seated in the back next to a baby. So romantic! I'm not a fan of the bench with too many overstuffed pillows. Its awkward for everyone, they slide around, the person seated last has to deal with all of the extras.We arrived a little early thinking we could hang at the bar and have a drink. Good thing they were empty and could seat us right away because there really isn't a bar to hang at.The service was just ok. She explained a number of dishes to us, and came around from time to time. She did take a plate that still had food on it without asking if we were finished. That is one of my pet peeves at a restaurant.I had a glass of wine that was ok. My boyfriend tried one of the Greek beers and it was outstanding. It was the darker beer of the two and was like delicious coffee. To eat we had olives which were eh. A lot of them were bitter or really sour. I was on my own with them as my boyfriend only sort of likes olives. He likes them when the brine is tame and with nice flavors like citrus. The pickles were just a few peppers and I think okra. It was 90% olives.We had their version of hummus but it was called something else. It was very expensive for what you get. We liked the pita that it came with. We also tried the pastry. If it hadn't been served with the house-made feta then it would have been just a boring, but nice, pastry. The cheese was the star. The fried cauliflower was great however they were really stingy with the cheese. If they had doubled what they gave us then it would be outstanding. As it was the plain friend cauliflower was nice but dry. The octopus was the star of the night. That was delicious. Wonderful flavors, perfectly cooked.By the time we ate all of these dishes we were kind of ready to go. It didn't feel celebratory so we decided to go somewhere else for dessert.I think the food was ok, the portions were a little sad, but it was like they were trying too hard to not be Halsted Street. And the service was underwhelming. The next time I'm craving Greek food I'll probably go back to the tried and true."], ["Danielle L.", "Let me preface with I am not one to write a poor review unless it's absolutely warranted. That said, my experience at Taxim was by far the worst dining experience I've ever had at any Chicago restaurant after dining in this city for 8 years. Why was it bad? The service. Our party of 7 on the rooftop had a server that had to be called over to even order drinks, ask for menus, and fix a very wobbly table. It took 45 minutes for us to order and receive a round of drinks and then finally put in our dinner order. The waiter was flustered and a poor communicator when trying to order. Once we finally ordered, our 1st appetizer came out 30 minutes later. It was okay, I've had better hummus and pita from the grocery store. It's now been an hour and a half since we arrived and we've still only had 1 appetizer and a couple rounds of drinks. Our inattentive waiter comes over and asks if we're ready for the check. What!?!? We've only received one app and are still waiting on salads, skewers, and our main courses! We asked for the manager at this point as its 10pm, we're hungry and clearly our waiter has no idea what's going on with our order. The manager comes over and he's just as poor of a communicator as the waiter. Tells us the kitchen lost our ticket, they'll comp us some food and then storms off as we're still talking to him. We wait another 10mins. At this point we've decided we're going to find dinner elsewhere and tell the waiter to just cancel our order and bring the check. We wait 10mins. The bus staff and waiter come out with plates of skewers after we had already \u00a0said to cancel the order and bring the check. We tell him we do not want this food and just want to leave. He YELLS at us and says THIS IS FROM THE CHEF! Great, we're not eating it and please bring us our check. We wait as we watch the waiter and manager fiddle with the POS system. Instead of causing a scene back at our table, I walk up to them and kindly ask for the check there and reason with them that we should at the very least get some of our drinks or the 1 appetizer comped. They agreed and print out a check. The check has ALL OF OUR FOOD THAT WE NEVER RECEIVED ON IT. I hand it back and say no I'm sorry we're not paying for this and they say oops we printed the wrong one. Next try, the check has ALL OF OUR DRINKS ON IT AND 18% GRATUITY INCLUDED. \u00a0I say I'm sorry please remove the grat and comp some of the drinks. Next try, he prints off a check with all the food on it and no grat. Nope. After the 4th attempt at printing off a viable check we had made up our minds this place was a joke and we are leaving. The manager says loudly YOU DONT HAVE TO PAY and we left so quickly as the thought of being in that place 1 second longer made me sick. In summary, the service was so poor that even if the food we never received was the most delicious Greek food in the world, I would still never return to Taxim. I will in fact recommend against going there if I ever hear someone speaking about it. Get your act together, Taxim. Hire capable wait staff and managers because the ones we had to deal with should not be employed at any reputable restaurant."], ["Anna G.", "Dinner at Taxim was fantastic! Had an 8:30 reservation on Friday night and they seated us right away. The interior is quite lovely and not what I expected (just based on the years of walking by and seeing the deli style counter at the front). The decor is very true to mediterranean restaurants and reminiscent of my trips to Greece and Turkey. Our waitress was friendly and helpful. She recommended their driest rose (the Akakies), which is also available by the glass and went especially well with the phyllo cheese plate. For food, we decided to go with an assortment of small plates rather than traditional entrees. Hummus--what everyone says is true: you don't expect something as basic as hummus to be noteworthy, but theirs is great! I loved the lemon flavor. The house made pita bread is really good as well. Baby okra--a nice veg optionPrassopita--SO tasty! I could have easily eaten two of these phyllo pastries. You can definitely taste the dill (so if that's not your thing, beware) and the goat feta was delicious. Fried cauliflower--flavorful and not greasyFried beer battered mussels--I don't remember much about this one. It was just ok and we probably could have just skipped it.Ground lamb--I'm not big on lamb, but I really liked this. The spices and yogurt blended really well. Loukoumades--I don't think you can ever go wrong with fried donuts. You get 4 of them in the order and they're all a decent size. We actually only split one and took the rest home because we were so full. \u00a0After paying, we took the rest of our wine upstairs to their newly opened rooftop. We actually wanted to eat dinner up there to begin with, but they serve a different, limited menu up there. That was really the biggest bummer of the evening. Not sure if this is a business decision or something with permits because the rooftop isn't really so far away that they couldn't carry the orders from downstairs. Anyway, I loved the rooftop space! It pretty much spans the whole roof so there are a lot of tables, a separate bar, a loungey seating area, and you don't really hear much of the Milwaukee Ave noise. All they need to do to spiff it up a bit more is string some market lights around. You could definitely stop by just for apps and drinks. Overall, I really enjoyed the ambiance and food at Taxim. It would easily please anyone: date, family, group of friends. Definitely great for groups. Pricing was fair."], ["Chris M.", "Came here with some of my bro friends last week. After almost three years living in the burbs with minimal visits into the city as of late, I am out of touch with the trendy, posh filled restaurants of Milwaukee Ave in Wicker Park. We enter, they have a rooftop and we decide to sit up there b/c it's a nice summer night. Turns out the upstairs has a different name, and therefore a different menu than the one we looked at before coming here. Yeesh, had to go downstairs again. Luckily, the dining room is beautiful with the high ceilings and nice ambient lighting. Still though, wt...?The highlight of the meal was the octopus. I have NEVER had octopus that isn't the slightest bit rubbery in texture until trying this dish. The octopus was tender, the onion was an amazing compliment to the sauce that was used. A+ I would come back for this dish alone. In fact, this dish alone is the reason Taxim gets three stars. The rest is downhill. Our waitress was a beautiful and well spoken woman, but when we asked what she recommended, we got a robotic description of a few menu items without an inkling of excitement or notion that she had even tried the dishes. As a former server, I LOVED it when people asked for recommendations!! This didn't seem to be the case on this evening.I decided on the duck gyros based on Yelp. This is a weird dish to me, as it resembles absolutely nothing to that of a gyros sandwich from the bread to the meat. It was duck meat rolled up into egg roll form, cut into four pieces and placed on top of a lake of tzatziki sauce. Too much sauce, the sauce was heavy on the cucumber/pickle flavor and it overpowered the dish. The Pontian Satz \"bread\" was like phyllo dough. My buddy scored the winning dish with the lamb chop dish. I was able to try some and thought it was good enough to possibly get me to come back here, along with that octopus."], ["Allison J.", "Best take on Greek food I've found in Chicago! Like I've said before I'm no expert on Greek food, but I do consider this a unique, fresh take on Greek food. We were really torn between 3-4 stars (AKA my boyfriend remembered a 3-star experience and I remember a 4-star experience)! The ambience is really nice, but in order to fully experience it, I would recommend sitting in the back of the restaurant. Otherwise, you are seated at the front window having every passerby on Milwaukee watch you eat your meal.. We decided to stick with smaller plate options to share. We ordered 5, which was 1-2 too many, which is a common theme between that my boyfriend and inexperience. Veggies- we got the eggplant served with pita. It's served cold which was surprising but it was perfect and the flavored were all great. This was one of my favorite dishes! Small plates - fried cauliflower was meh. I wasn't too impressed. Lamb kebabs were ok, nothing special. I really think I prefer gyro meat over kebabs. Octopus was tasty, but I always think octopus is served too salty. The pork belly was surprisingly the best small plate we ordered, huge fan!"], ["Lorenzo L.", "Heard and read lots of great things about Taxim, and can honestly say that the food and the service were really very good. \u00a0The selection of tapas-style apps ran the the gamut from the ubiquitous greek greens and charred octopus to simple freshly made salads and flatbreads. \u00a0However, if you are hungry, make sure to order one or two more of them.......serving size is definitely on the smaller side. \u00a0For the main course, we sampled a lamb shank, and both duck & fish gyros ( fyi these authentic style Greek \"gyro\" are more like a grilled burrito). \u00a0On the downside, the wooden banquettes are rather uncomfortable ( even with the \u00a0pillows that are furnished). \u00a0The noise level can make conversation with your neighbor seated across the table from you, very difficult. \u00a0While the wine list had a great \"variety\" of Greek wines (with numerous selections from the Moschofileros and Malagouzias \u00a0varietals), it was for the most part, overpriced. \u00a0Three glasses of wine \u00a0( 2 red, 1 rose) cost \u00a0$48. \u00a0 Bottom line, good food, high prices."], ["Vanessa Y.", "Super delightful.I've been to Taxim twice now, and I've been extremely happy with the experience both times. Service can be a tad slow, but the food and ambiance more than makes up for that. The best things I've had here, all small plates:-Mussels-Pork belly w/ honey -Fried cauliflower -Pita bread and hummus (I know, you'd think, \"how good could hummus and bread be?\" but trust me, it's AMAZING)-Fried dough balls (dessert)But really, everything I've had here has been delicious. The food is exciting and fun to eat, so definitely try it out if you're looking for an experience, not just a meal."], ["Dan S.", "It's the lone Greek outpost in Wicker Park/Bucktown area and while Chicago has a Greek town, Greek food in Chicago has been pretty much a \"meh\" (exception perhaps to the noisy Greek Islands restaurant in Greek town). Having all but written off Greek food in this town coming any where near what it is in Greece, I decide give it a shot. The verdict, pleasantly surprised. The Octopus is pretty decent, the eggplant wasn't bad and the Okra was tasty. So what would make the food better: more seasoning. If the chef reads this, please throw a little more salt, aleppo pepper, oregano and other herbs in your food - it will def take things up a notch."], ["Unna N.", "We are regulars here and know our staples. You just have to try out the many dishes. More often than not, you will come upon dishes that keep bringing you back. Each time you go, there are more dishes you add to the amazing-list. The dishes are all titled in Greek, so it's difficult to keep in mind, at least for me. I think the photos speak for themselves. Go here."], ["Tiffany Y.", "I had reservations at 8:30, and arrived a bit early, the restaurant was pretty packed on a Friday night, and I was glad that I had reservations, the seating here is awkward and not meant for a romantic date night, they have a long \"communal\" table in the middle, which I don't particularly enjoy most of the time because I find that these tables are too small, I would rather them have a large table in the middle. \u00a0I know that these types of set ups are intended to foster conversation, but often times they are more annoying and awkward. We ordered 4 dishes to share, homemade hummus + pita bread keftedes - lamb meatballs $14grilled octopus $17 fakes - lentil soup. $10My favorite dishes of the night were the grilled octopus and the lentil soup. \u00a0The grilled octopus was soo tender and tasty, I ate every last bit, even the onions. \u00a0The lentil soup is made the traditional greek way with a balsamic vinaigrette. \u00a0It was delicious, the lentil soup was warm and great for a healthy tummy filler. We also ordered 2 of the desserts to share, loukoumades ( fried dough with wildflower honey and rose cream), and galaktoboureko ( egg custard between layers of phyllo dough) \u00a0These desserts were perfect, the doughnuts were so warm and fluffy, and the honey was the perfect condiment for it. \u00a0The galaktoboureko was served warm with a wedge of lemon, ( this dish is baked when ordered, and takes about 15 minutes to come out ). \u00a0 The custard was also light and fluffy, and not too sweet at all! I cannot wait to come here again, and try all the other foods on the menu, although I would try and come on a Monday - Thursday, so it isn't that loud and you can actually hear yourself talk. \u00a0I would also probably come with more than 2 people, so I could try more dishes."], ["Jamie B.", "Solid 3 stars. I thought the food was overpriced for the taste/quality. Service was ok, nothing special. The wine list was priced high, it's Greek wine with California prices. \u00a0I would not rush to go back, still a great experience with our friends but the couple next to us looked angry the entire time."], ["Leslie B.", "Had such a phenomenal dinner at Taxim! Came in with 4 girlfriends on a Saturday night and the place was packed, reservations are definitely needed. The interior of Taxim was probably the best surprise of the evening. It's a beautiful and well-decorated space. We were seated in the middle of the restaurant and the atmosphere was great. Our waitress came over right away and helped us navigate the wine menu. None of us were familiar with the Greek wines on the menu, but she helped us select a Pinot Grigio-esque bottle that was very delicious and under $30! When it came to ordering, we decided to share multiple plates.There were a bunch of items we were debating between and our waitress was helpful in recommending some. First, Taxim makes all of their own phyllo and it's awesome. We particularly enjoyed the one with dill and goat feta. The squash fritters (kind of like falafel), roasted eggplant, grilled octopus and fried cauliflower were all incredibly flavorful and well cooked. These dishes were also easy to share which worked well for our group. We also ordered items in waves which was really nice. When we were still hungry or wanted to try something new, our waitress was there to grab our order. The only entree we tried was the duck gyro and it rocked. This is definitely not your typical gyro, but it was incredibly flavorful and rich. It was actually great to share, large portion and came with a ton of tasty duck fries. Overall, Taxim exceeded my expectations in every way. The decor was beautiful, wine reasonably priced, service attentive, and every dish we tried was delicious. Highly recommend for a girls dinner or date. Note that if you come with a hungry man, it could get expensive as the small plates are kind of small. For sharing with girlfriends, very reasonably priced."], ["Jason L.", "A great blend of Moroccan, Greek, and Mediterranean fare! I have been here a couple of times with family, and every time the food is tasty and the service is decent. Wines are a bit overpriced, and the drinks are average at best. The appetizers and entrees, however, never disappoint. Although it can get a bit noisy with Milwaukee Ave and the six corners not far from the place, it features great ambiance that is reflective of the culture of the cuisine."], ["Bobby H.", "The food here was delicious, but slightly overpriced. \u00a0Also hurting my rating is the poor service, as the waiter came to my table to 1) collect my order 2) give me a coke - which he charged as two 3) give me the check. \u00a0#3 only ever happened because we asked through the water dude (sorry, but what the hell do you call them?). \u00a0This lack of attention was strange as the place was at a guesstimated 30% capacity. \u00a0But it would be unfair to leave out that there was a very, very drunk and loud party of 8.To the food! We got 6 small plates. The wood grilled shrimp rocked (but should for $3 a piece) and the grilled octopus impressed as yelply advertised.

I would come back and try one of those."], ["Inna B.", "Taxim has been on my radar for a long time, and I was excited to try it because it looked like a cute 'date night' spot. Unfortunately this was the worst Greek food I've had in Chicago, without exaggeration. We tried three small plates and the lamb shank entr\u00e9e. Each dish had either an absence of flavor or tasted like someone accidentally tripled the amount of salt in the recipe. Everything seemed pre-made somehow and did not have the fresh and vibrant flavors that Greek food is known for.

Came to 118$ for four before tip with two cocktails. Definitely would return."], ["Karen B.", "A great disappointmentWe had friends in from Dallas for the Restaurant Show, and I was searching for a neighborhood gem. Past reviews of Taxim were strong, and the menu was diverse and interesting. We were greeted immediately upon arrival, and was offered a table that was suitable, although it did not meet our Open Table request. The noise was deafening. The room is all hard surfaces without so much as a curtain or upholstered seat to absorb the noise. The owners need to rethink that aspect of the decor as a conversation was difficult if not impossible to maintain. The menu was as presented on line, but the execution certainly did not match the online reviews. Each plate seemed skimpy or full of fillers. For instance, the heirloom tomato salad with feta (Greek salad) had tomatos that were under ripe and sliced paper thin. The sardine small plate which was voted \"taste of the year\" was full of lettuce and we could barely find the sardines - not white and a few very small pieces. The artichoke item was full of potatoes with few artichoke slices, and although tasty, was not satisfying if one was looking forward to artichokes. The duck gyros, although tasty, came with a plate full of fries. . . once again, more fries than duck. I will say that the bottle of wine we ordered was the best item of the evening.The service was very slow, to the point of cancelling the dessert we ordered. It took 2+ hours to eat, and we found ourselves constantly waiting for the next plate to be brought out.

We were in Taxim for about 20 minutes. We arrived, and were immediately directed to table adjacent to 6 extremely loud bros. There were at least 20 empty tables in (relatively) quieter areas, so we helped ourselves to a more secluded table. While sitting at our table, we heard a (1) baby screaming a lot, (2) very loud music, and (3) obnoxiously loud laughing at something that was presumably not that funny. It was a cross between an echo chamber and an airport terminal from hell (assuming ORD isn't actually, you know, hell). After 20mins of this without much activity from the wait staff, we decided to give up and go to Whole Foods instead. That was a good choice."], ["William B.", "There are a lot of things I like about Taxim -- the location, the menu, the fun Greek wine list, the fact that they take reservations, and those reservations are not impossible to come by even at peak times. Unfortunately, one of those things is not really the food. \u00a0The food is perfectly fine -- grilled octopus, lamb sausage, shrimp wrapped in grape leaves, etc. are all done competently, but none of them make you go \"oooh.\" \u00a0And Chicago is a place sufficiently full of restaurants that make you go \"oooh\" that that is a problem. \u00a0On the other hand, a lot of those places either don't take reservations or they're too hard to come by . . . . which is why I sometimes come here. \u00a0Think of it as an emergency workhorse, not a destination to impress."], ["Amer A.", "Taxim has completely changed my impression of Greek cuisine.

My favorite dish from the \"Salads and Vegetables\" section of the menu is the Fak\u00e9s Kas. Fr\u00f3ssos - lentils with house made feta and a balsamic reduction. \u00a0The acidity of the vinegar balances the lentils perfectly, and the feta is unbelievable. \u00a0In the small plates section, you must try the fried cauliflower with capers and the wood grilled octopus with fennel. \u00a0The octopus is charred nicely and I love the crispy ends. \u00a0If you're being adventurous, get the ouzo (an anis flavored apertif) that is paired with the octopus. \u00a0For entrees, you cannot go wrong with either of the lamb dishes**. \u00a0The duck gyro is also delicious, but it is a bit underwhelming in comparison to the ridiculously good lamb dishes. \u00a0Overall, if you're looking to have a wonderful and authentic Greek/Mediterranean experience, Taxim is your place. \u00a0If you've been on the fence about visiting Taxim or simply haven't gotten around to it yet, Taxim should shoot to the top of your list.**I was watching TV the other day and my Tivo changed the channel to record an old episode of Iron Chef. \u00a0The Chef of Taxim, David Schneider, was the challenger at kitchen stadium! \u00a0I know, I know, it's old news, but I thought it was cool. \u00a0The secret ingredient was lamb, and the judges went nuts over his main entree. \u00a0This chef knows lamb."], ["Sagar S.", "Taxim has good food, good drinks, and a fantastic rooftop.

After finishing everything and sitting there for 15 minutes with empty plates, empty drinks, and without the water we asked for, our server finally stopped by and we asked for the bill.

I didn't get a chance to sample any entrees but the table next to us got the lamb, the chicken and the fish and they were all huge, beautiful portions. Our server was also very sweet.

I did not like this place at all. For starters, they have no real front of house- I walked in and there was a guy standing behind the bar, just staring. No greeting, no response- nothing.

Anyway he did end up setting the table and seating me, so ok. We had a group of 6 and it took forever to order food and eat. We were there until 10:30! I only saw one server and while she was very nice, and they were not very busy, it took way longer than necessary.Portions for the small plates are a joke. I rarely complain about portion size but Taxim needs a reality check. For prices in the $9-12 range, there should be more than they give you. The spinach and phyllo pastry appetizer is literally the size of a dinner roll and it was $10. Give me a break. As a side note, they brought out a plate of something (I think feta and olives? Or yogurt and olives) on the house. We also didn't have to pay for the long-ass hair that came out of said yogurt.

The pork belly was delicious ! The arugula salad, though, was almost inedible because of the amount of salt on the salad! On the description it sounded kind of like the Middle Eastern fattoush. It was obviously their twist on it, just WAY TOO MUCH salt !We got the lamb chops and chicken. The lamb chops were delicious. The chicken had a great crunch to it and the potatoes were great. But again. A super heavy hand with the salt. I ended up drinking more water than the wine I ordered because of how salty all my items were. Boo. I was looking forward to a nice buzz with my meal!For dessert we had the loukemades and chocolate dish. YUM! Both came out amazing and hot.

The decor of the restaurant is beautiful, especially the main dining room. the vaulted ceilings and dim lighting with cool artwork, which made for an awesome vibe. My issue here was how uncomfortable the seats were. I was on the bench side of the half booth/half-seat table and I was so close to my neighbors that I could hear their conversation and had a pretty hard time getting in and out of my seat.

I'm not a large person by any means, so I can empathize with anyone that is even slightly larger than me or isn't as able-bodied to get around as easily.The service was also pretty slow. We had to get our waiter's attention multiple times and remind them of our orders placed. I understand it was a packed house with lots of demands going on, but maybe they need to be staffed a little more when they're at full capacity. It wasn't the waiters fault. He did the best he could and he's only human but it still kind of ticked me off.We started with the chicagopita, chickpeas and grilled octopus (AMAZING!). I had the sea bass which freaked me out a little since they present it totally whole at first (bones and all) and then later take it back to chop it up. My bf had some meat (I forget) and we shared the greek yogurt desert with honey. The food was perfect and that made up for the other flaws, so I'm trying to not let the other stuff get the best of me.

The beat salad was just OK for me. The fried cauliflower was not good at all. It was very salty and greasy almost. Not to mention the fact that the pieces were so small (and so little of them) it just tasted like fried batter. The fish gyro was PHENOMENAL. I was expecting perhaps something on the side besides a few scatter chips for the price point...definitely not worth $20.They did this weird thing where they took our plates away before the gyro came which would be fine except that we were still eating off of them.

I liked my Shrimp De jonghe but my husband's Shrimp Scampi was extremely buttery and greasy. The rice pilaf I ordered as a side would put any Greek grandma to shame. This was an insult to the genre as of pilafs. It was just a plate of plain rice with some yucky red tomato sauce on it. The potatoes my husband ordered as his side was dry and some pieces were under cooked (for some really good Greek-Middle Eastern style potatoes, I recommend Pita Heaven on Michigan in the South Loop).We were very disappointed with the food. I would never ever go there again. I should have guessed from the unappealing food pics on their website. Also when we asked our server about family style food options, he had no idea what we were talking about. He had to go and ask someone and then came back and told us that you need a minimum of 8 people to order family style (note that Greek Islands does family style with 2 people or more).

Unfortunately, the egg lemon soup was just \"thin\" consistency but it had a nice flavor. \u00a0The salad however, was thick with wetness - apparently the victim of a heavy hand in the kitchen as admitted by the manager when he walked over and asked, \"is everything to your liking?\" The server had gone to fetch me additional greens so as to disperse the liquid but even taking dry lettuce \"to go\" mixed with some of the wet lettuce...still rendered it a soppy mess. \u00a0(I'm just not one to throw things away, but this one should have met the bin.) The manager was aware of my dismay however did not offer to comp the salad or to say anything except mention the heavy-handed guy in the back. \u00a0I was glad that I did not order a larger meal.

When they brought it out I was a little bit blown away by the portion size. I expected something pretty small but it was a good 6 inches of filo wrapped lamb which I had no complaints about. I wish I had had enough of an appetite to eat all of it in one sitting. It was quite delicious. My friend had ordered a vegetarian dish I can't recall the name off but she equally had no complaints about her food. After the very filling main course I decided I'd try and fit in some dessert as well. I ended up going with the rice pudding mostly because it was the smallest dessert that was offered. This was probably where Santorini fell a bit short. The rice pudding was pretty mediocre, even a little bit tough around the edges. Not bad, but not great.

I had my mind set on going to this restaurant purely because it was named Santorini. My fiance and I just booked our honeymoon to Santorini next year, and today is actually our -1 anniversary (we are getting married next year on August 8). Prior to eating here, we have both eaten at the Parthenon and Greek Island so on top of the name being the place we will be honeymooning, I thought it would be fun to try a different place. We started with the Melizanosalata, which is our favorite of all of the different types of spreads. It was delicious! Sometimes It has been my experience in the past that the eggplant can get over powered by all of the spices and seasonings added to the dish. I don't mind that, but here the taste of the eggplant really came through, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. After this, our entrees came out, and though \u00a0I cannot speak for my fiance's meal completely, I can say that she really enjoyed the Tuna steak, and it looked as if it had been prepared perfectly. I ordered the Chicken Alexander because it sounded like a dish I had never tried before. I could not have been happier with my choice. I would have finished the whole thing at the restaurant but it was definitely big enough to make two meals out of so I took it home and had it for breakfast today.The highlight of the meal for me though was the dessert. I'm not very good at deciphering flavors, but it seemed like they did something a little different with their baklava. Whatever it was, I am pretty sure I would go back just for the baklava.On top of the food being superb, our waiter was very friendly and gave us great service all night. He moved the meal along at a nice pace, and when we mentioned we would be going to Greece had some nice conversation about it. \u00a0The wine was also very nice. We got a bottle from Domaine Sigalas, which I believe is a winery in Santorini."], ["Jenna S.", "Very good and authentic. It was my first time having traditional Greek cuisine and it was excellent.

Walked in on a weeknight and the place was half empty. The atmosphere was quiet, lighting was low and romantic and the fireplace made the dining room nice and toasty, a welcomed contrast to the bitter cold outside. We started with the saganaki (which is a must in Greektown), and I was surprised to learn it's a type of goat cheese (which I usually don't care for). The attitude was definitely more laid back than Greek Island across the street. I thought the cheese was a tad too caramelized, but liked the nice smoky flavor. For entrees we had the lamb youvetsi (a humongous plate of tomatoe-based, slow stewed lamp chop and pasta) and the lemon sole. The lamb was melt-in-your-mouth tender and had a rich flavor that only comes from slow cooking. The lemon sole was cooked to perfection and lightly flavored with Santorini sauce (lemon & olive oil, salt & pepper). Loved the simple preparation which really showcased the freshness of the food. We ended the evening with a lemony flan that balanced out the sweetness of the caramel. Even though we stayed way past closing time, we never felt rushed at all.

Since I probably haven't had legit Greek food in months, it sounded good to me. Of course I failed to realize the time my aunt made a reservation, so we got to the restaurant too early. Thankfully there is a bar. The place had been busy from the time the clock hit 6, but we didn't have to wait for our table at all. It was in the back corner, and it was perfect.We had saganaki and a plate of the spreads for appetizers. Tirokafteri is my favorite thing ever, and it didn't disappoint here. The garlic spread was good too, and I had a bit of the eggplant spread. Saganaki always tastes good, because if you mess up setting cheese on fire, you probably shouldn't have a restaurant. The guy who served it was totally not into the whole yelling \"opa!\" thing.When we finally got someone back to place our entree orders, I chose to get pastichio. I like how it says lamb on the menu there, but beef on the online menu. Well, whatever it was, it was decent. We also had two bottles of some Greek Sauvignon Blanc, and it was pretty good. It was nice to have Greek food again, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to get back here again when I'm back in town.

Is it my fault for trying certain things? Probably. However, I was a little disappointed at the \"beans\" = green beans\" implication. So, at Santorini you are provided copious amounts of bread to start out, which is nice. I think copious might even be an understatement. Meanwhile, the service for food itself, was a bit slow.I decided that, having eaten plenty from my Orchestra concert prior, that I would select a number of appetizers and have that as a meal. While normally greek appetizers are basically awesome, there were mistakes made on my side and on Santorini's alike.I decided to order the greek green appetizer (Fasolakia). It was, to say, disappointingly green beans. There's this greek beans recipe involving butterbeans and tomato sauce which is basically awesome. This place apparently had their own spin involving green beans and a somewhat modified sauce. \u00a0So that was disappointing but somewhat my fault. I mean ti was okay, but just...a little bit too greasy, and a little bit not enough flavor.Next, we have the Kolokithakia, which I have always traditionally loved. Santorini delivered. There was enough garlic in the Skordalia that comes with it to kill the average individual who is not obsessed with garlic (aka just right for me). I also elected to get the dandelion greens, which were claimed to have oil and lemon with them. Maybe the dandelion is ridiculously strong, or they didn't use any oil and lemon. I'm not sure if it was my own taste preference, or something else, but this tasted like a combination of spinach and grass and had absolutely zero seasoning. It was legitimately difficult to eat, but I'm also to blame for having ordered it.I'd say the place was a bit loud, but mostly the slow service detracted from a five star review. Nothing of great concern, the place wasn't horrible, but I wish my meal didnt' take 2+ hours due to simply waiting so much, even though the food was pretty good."], ["Christina L.", "This restaurant seemed more interested in keeping the restaurant appearance than keeping customers happy.

Seeing that I was so glued to my drink, the host could have been a little more creative in his actions. This was a sign that my experience wasn't going to be great. I turned around, crossed the street, and went to the 4 star restaurant, Greek Island. They were hesitant, but allowed me to enter the restaurant with my drink. I immediately poured it into the empty water glass sitting at the table, and that was that. I'm glad that I took my $90+ bill and 5-star Yelp review elsewhere.P.S. This restaurant was only half packed compared to the restaurant across the street.2 stars:1 Star because the mints at the front hostess station looked cute (aka, no real reason), also because I didn't try their food... but I'm not very impressed by some of the other reviews.1 Star because Yelp forces me give them 1 star."], ["J N.", "Went for an early dinner with people from work. the place as has a nice, warm feeling and the decor is pleasant. \u00a0i think this would be a great date place :).

Also ordered the fresh oysters and wow were they fresh! Overall the food was fantastic and no complaints could be had on my part.The only issue was the staff. Our server was pleasant for most of the dinner but at the end we payed with a card and wanted to leave the tip in cash. After he picked up the card I assume he thought we weren't going to tip him because he stood right behind us, leaning against a wall, and waiting for us to leave. The busboys also began putting the chairs up on the tables long before we even had dessert. I find if a customer comes to your establishment orders apps, a nice meal, wine, and dessert you should at least wait before they leave before trying to close the place down. Also, the staff was VERY rude to the busboys and treated them horrible. I mistakenly asked a busboy that was nearby how large the red snapper was and the manager came over and shooed him away saying, \"Oh he's just a busboy. He doesn't know anything.\" I don't care if he's the guy that mops the floor, you don't talk to or about employees like that.

With the abundance of Greek immigrants to Chicago since the 50's, I would expect every Greek restaurant in Chi-town to be amazing. Located in Lincoln Square, the old German neighborhood, it's a great location and upon first sight, I liked what I saw. The interior was very nice from what I observed on my way to the bathroom, which were not great btw. We had a loud, drunk group so we decided to have a seat in the outdoor patio, aka \"the tables on the sidewalk\". We didn't have a lot of time, so after we were ignored for about 10 minutes, I challenged our waitress to get our food out in 10 minutes. We all ordered gyros, so I assumed it wouldn't be a problem. I didn't use a stopwatch, but I would say they hit it dead on. However, back to my central theme here, the gyros were not great. I would judge them as \"State Fair\" quality at best. At least it was a fair value for Chicago standards. We had 4 gyros and 4 beers and I think the bill was about $75 + tip. To sum it up, the service was A-OK, the food just OK, the overall value: A-OK.

I could have done a better job by going to the frozen section of Jewel and microwaving the peas myself. My baked potato was burnt and chewy. The bread was stale. The Greek lemon soup was bland.

Their Mousaka and Pastichio are quite good too, but the bottom line is: Come here for the lamb!My main criticism is that their side of peas that comes with many of their menu items is really disappointing.

I'm totally going to steal that idea for my kitchen!The classive flavors of the creamy egg-lemon soup and oven-roasted citrus potatoes brought back fond memories of college, which you wouldn't know anything about. But they were magnificent and evocative of the olden days. If you don't have ancient memories of lemon soup and potatoes, I pity you.After the meal, there was strong greek coffee that invigorated our desire to stay awake another 12 hours, along with baklava that drowned our desires with honey and returned us to the sleepy sated state of gluttony once more.The only thing better than this meal was speculating on whether the ceiling would catch on fire from the explosive Saganaki flame columns erupting all around us.The only downside was being seated by the porch doors, which were not adequately winter-sealed.

The location of the restaurant, in the heart of Lincoln Square, and its \u00a0fa\u00e7ade -- think of the white buildings in the Cycladic islands -- give it prominence, but as soon as you take the first bite you can't help but wonder if they are trying to get away with justifying the price with the gigantic portions.

Taramsalata was a bit oily. Lamb chops were ok, but a bit over cooked. And without getting into the other food, I can say it wasn't bad, but it was rather mediocre.

We walked by this place and it looked really nice from the outside looking in - white tablecloths, polished oak bar, and generally a very clean, crisp looking place. So, we popped in. We were seated right by the front window, which always makes me feel special. I wasn't too hungry so decided to opt for a soup and the Greek salad. Let me mention that I love Greek salads so much that when I was in Greece, Greek salads were often my preferred meal. I feel that they should be the litmus test for Greek restaurants - sort of like rating Mexican joints by their beans and tacos. If you accept that premise too, then Barba Yianni fails. The tomatoes were pale looking, they skimped on the feta and olives and it was just tiny and sparse looking. The soup offerings were chicken noodle and egg lemon - uninspired, to say the least, so I skipped the soup altogether. In fairness, my friend had the roast lamb and said it was delicious and just like the one her dad made when she was a kid (she's Bulgarian; so, she knows a thing or two about lamb). They had live Greek music and the place started getting really packed as the night progressed. Surprisingly, people are allowed to smoke cigarettes, or at least the people seated near the dance floor, which was a bit off-putting.My overall impression, though, is that this place is only ok.

Not because I had bad experiences, but because there are so many wonderful restaurants in and around the Lincoln Square area. After our little dinner on Tuesday night, I am adding Barba Yianni back to my list of preferred restaurants.We entered into a large room, and were escorted to a table in an adjacent room, to a raised area, near the windows, next to a large (unoccupied) dance floor. Although the temperature outside was bitter, the seating area was very comfortable. I thought the dark red color of the walls made the place very pretty. I liked the atmosphere.There were maybe four or five other tables occupied in the same area. Not a busy night - too cold, I guess - but enough to give the serving staff something to do, other than their nails. There was a pleasant noise level of conversation, nothing obtrusive. We passed on the wines, since we had someplace else to go after dinner. The Engineer ordered appetizers only - a cup of the lemon/rice soup and a cold appetizer, a fish roe spread called taramosalata. I went with the vegetable kabobs, and soup was included with that entree. I also ordered the lemon/rice.Let me tell you, that was one good cup of soup. Really, really good. Just the right amount of lemon, creamy, with bits of rice. It totally hit \"the spot\" on a cold night. It was very filling, too.The vegetable kabobs were sauteed vegetables, although not served on a stick. A little bit of potato, zucchini, onion, green pepper, mushroom, all delicious. It came with rice that had a red sauce, and peas. It was all delicious. I really did get pretty full with the soup, so I only ate half my dinner and took the rest home.The Engineer was very pleased with the taramosalata. We already had been served some bread with butter (yes, little foil packets), so she used that bread for her fish roe spread. She actually got two small cups of the spread, so she had more than enough to eat.Service was just fine. We were greeted, got out water and bread quickly, ordered quickly, and got our food in a reasonable amount of time. My coffee cup was refilled promptly.We were both full, I had take-home, and the bill was $21.00 and change. That works for me.All in all, a good experience. I would go back again. In the summer, they have tables on the sidewalk. I bet that's really nice. I am looking forward to trying that."], ["Rachel L.", "Meh. It's decent Greek food but nothing spectacular. I thought the rice tasted weird, though I can't really describe the taste. I guess that makes it easy to keep your carbs down, lol. The good news is that this place is quiet, so you can hear your dinner partners without screaming."], ["Kristin M.", "I've been here several times and it's always been a 3 star experience. \u00a0The food is not creative or mind-blowing, it's just your standard Greek food (in a good way). \u00a0It's nice when I want to stay in my neighborhood and not go all the way down to Greektown.The inside is a little old school, but they have a nice patio and we were able to enjoy our meal outside.The service was what really disappointed me this time. \u00a0We were there for about 2 hours and about 1/2 of it was spent waiting for food. \u00a0It was certainly not busy but not secluded either. \u00a0I feel like they just kept forgetting about us. \u00a0The food was ok, not great. \u00a0The tzatziki and pita were good. \u00a0The chicken kabob was ok, but it only came with one skewer! \u00a0My friend ordered chicken breast stuffed with cheese and spinach and then topped with cheese. \u00a0It was more exciting than my kabob, but still nothing special.I'm not sure I'll be back."], ["Jennifer E.", "Great ambiance and good food.Start off with the Saganaki!

It's even better in the summer when you can enjoy the patio and eat while you people watch Lincoln Square. The food in one word is AMAZING. Some of our favorite are....Starters: Skordalia (Garlic Spread), Saganak i(Flaming Cheese), Egg Lemon Soup, \u00a0and the Baby Octopus and Kalarmari.

I admit, the place does look a little dinky and also way at the furthest northern part of lincoln square, so of course parking is somewhat hard to find.I have never been there on nights that they have live music, but those must be interesting for sure. So we had:Saganaki (my friend had actually never had it, if you can believe that). Saganaki was as good as always. I mean if you like it, you'd like it. Pretty simple. Same goes for their falafel, although it was interesting how the tahini sauce was really light and the falafels were really soft. The stuffed mushrooms are awesome, and a great addition too...it's stuffed with the same stuff you'd find inside Spanakopita but with cheese on top. \u00a0If there's one thing that stuck out though, (even above the combo plate) it was the Kolokythakia. They bring it out with this ice cream scooper sized heaping of garlic (which is the bane of all people that will be with you after you eat) but the batter fried zucchini with the garlic and/or any other appetizer mixes excellent with all that garlic! Meanwhile, I pity anyone who tries to kiss someone who has been eating so much garlic.All in all, the meal was good, and although a little bit pricey, it's nice to see that the meals come with soup and the bread keeps coming too. I wouldn't be surprised if 2 people just wanting to try some greek food could eat for $20-30 tops if you're not ordering a lot. Otherwise, probably a $50 tab ish. I'd still suggest it to anyone who wants some real greek food though.edit: update: I forgot to mention, the service is indeed slow and the meals take a while (but appetizers come pretty fast).

I was impressed by the prices. Real, decent entrees for like, $11-$15. That's pretty damn good. And many things for cheaper than that. The bf and I got the greek salad and a half chicken to share. It was plenty of food. The greek salad wasn't super greek, but definitely good. The chicken came with soup, and we got the lemon egg soup. I LOVED it! The chicken was very home-grown tasting. Something my mom or my grandma would make, and that is a good thing! Just good food. The rice was not the best, but still, when you mix it all up in that chicken sauce, it was just delicious. We slurped up that whole plate.

We were seated at a table along the front in the corner which was perfect. The bar is well stocked but no draft beer - however they had a couple of interesting selections in bottles.We started with the saganaki which was very good but how can you go wrong with flaming cheese. My wife had the broiled calamari for dinner and I had one of the specials which was a roasted lamb shank with spaghetti. We also shared a greek salad with their balsamic house dressing. Eveything was very good but I never get a craving for greek food so I have nothing to really compare it to. The last time I went down to greektown downtown was the 80s.Service was very good considering there was a birthday party with about 50 people in progress and all the waitstaff, including our waitress, were helping to serve the massive group. Our salad came after our entrees but that was no big deal.Overall I would recommend Barba Yianni's for dinner and I will be back to try some other dishes."], ["Will K.", "This is without question the best Greek restaurant on the north side of the city, and it's up there with Greek Islands in Greektown. \u00a0Mythos on Montrose is good but pricier. \u00a0As someone who grew up on, and has been eating Greek cooking all his life, I can tell with the first appetizer if there's a Greek in the kitchen. \u00a0Contrary to what the misguided yelper stated below, there IS a Greek chef (from Greece) in this kitchen. \u00a0I think his name is Vangelis and his lightly pan fried kolokithakia (zucchini) with garlic dip appetizer is as good as my mother's. \u00a0The avgolemono soup and lamb chops entr\u00e9e (the several thinner ones-didn't try the thick cuts) were great, and considerably less than what you'll pay on Halsted Street. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nice to have a solid Greek option on one of the prettiest blocks in Chicago."], ["Dennis C.", "Sometimes the food used to be great, but sometimes in recent years it has been only OK.

If you are looking for great Greek food, skip the joints downtown and come here. My favorite dish is the lamb with spaghetti. The lamb is fall off the bone tender paired with a wonderful red sauce that has great flavor. I would also recommend the leg of lamb sandwich which is another personal favorite of mine. As far as the atmosphere goes, Barba Yianni has a very welcoming and warm, homey \u00a0feel. It is very spacious so you can either cozy up to the bar or sit at one of the many tables. \u00a0In the summer they have a really nice patio to sit and grab a drink. Speaking of drinks, I am a huge wino and Barba Yianni has an extensive wine list that is one of the best values in the city. The house wine that they carry is above far average from any house pour you would get at another restaurant. They also have an extensive reserve list featuring rare vintages for those that want something really special. And again, the prices for both the drinks and food are more than reasonable. If you get a chance, come on a late Saturday night and check out the belly dancers. My friends and I like to go and get a bottle of champagne and hang out. It's a lot of fun listening to the music, watching the dancers, and there is always a big crowd that shows up. \u00a0Lastly, the owner Anas is extremely friendly and always makes sure that you are one hundred percent satisfied.

The food was great though and we were served promptly and courteously. The prices are reasonable and if you can choke up the \"everything is great at this great restaurant\" waitress mentality, you'll love it.

Someone ordered the chicken skewers and every piece of meat was raw. So naturally we sent it back. The food returned with half of the pieces cooked and the other half still pinker than a breast cancer parade. We insisted on talking to a manager. A large, elderly man came over and asked what the problem is. We responded with showing him the cooked pieces and the raw pieces. He was shocked and said \"this is the first complaint in 47 years\". Based on the yelp reviews, that's shocking to me. In addition, he said \"do you know what a marinade is\" and \"I don't understand why some pieces are cooked and why some aren't. They were put in the microwave for the same amount of time\". For the record, yes I know what a marinade is but it's very insulting when an owner is talking down to a customer about their mistake! I think the bigger problems are that he didn't understand that some pieces are larger and take longer to cook and that a restaurant uses microwaves to cook their food.

BEST COOKED LAMB i've had in a long time... meat fell off the bone and was perfectly tender and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.Deserts - Try the chocolate mouse cake and THE BAKLAVA -- the waiter was generous and offered us to do a split half and half so you could try 2 deserts for the price of 1... Restaurant was very clean, our waiter was very nice and generous who offered a fair share of honest opinions which is very important to me and he was not pushy at all. He made our dining experience very relaxing and even brought me a few cucumbers for my water!Will definitely come back and in my opinion top spot in GREEKTOWN!"], ["Katie K.", "This place is awful, on so many levels, don't waste your money, go some place else.My boyfriend and I went here with the Groupon deal back in October, I was incredibly disappointed with both the service and the food. \u00a0Also the Groupon is not much of a deal anyway, they have family style ordering on the menu for similar prices. When we arrived we informed our waiter we were using a Groupon and he was polite about it. \u00a0He promptly brought the \"house wine\" \u00a0which, no doubt was watered down and came from a box. \u00a0What can you do, we thought. \u00a0It tasted like church wine, maybe. \u00a0Next we ordered our cold appetizers and hot appetizers. \u00a0Our waiter then brought out the salads. \u00a0The salads were made with iceberg lettuce. \u00a0 \u00a0They were also drenched in olive oil. \u00a0The soup was next, it tasted like cream of chicken soup bought in bulk with lemon juice added. \u00a0It was basically disgusting. \u00a0The waiter acted insulted that I didn't eat it. \u00a0This was comical because it was not like the soup was homemade. \u00a0After the waiter brought our appetizers, I asked if we could order and he acted insulted that I was requesting to order. \u00a0I really did not understand. \u00a0I thought it was weird we had not ordered, or been offered to. \u00a0We ordered our entrees and after that we never saw the same waiter again. \u00a0Some how we insulted him to his core... not sure how. \u00a0The entrees were completely so-so. \u00a0I ordered the chicken kebab and to me it was inedible because it was drenched in oil. \u00a0Very disappointing. \u00a0It was also dry. \u00a0My guest ordered the combination plate and everything tasted old, not fresh and pre-made. \u00a0It tasted like it had been sitting out awhile too. In the end we got our desserts to go. \u00a0We left a tip on the table and left. \u00a0We figured that be fine since our waiter had not been paying any attention to us for most of the meal. \u00a0But naturally, he noticed and chased us down, letting us know we need to pay \"4.50\" in tax. \u00a0This I found to be absurd. \u00a0Why are we paying tax on the cost of the Groupon when 1. the restaurant does not get the full groupon amount (groupon takes a cut) 2. I did not pay the full groupon amount (promo code). \u00a0It seems to me they were trying to squeeze a little extra cash out of every groupon. \u00a0I was appalled and found this practice to be unethical. \u00a0Overall, major disappoints in food and service. \u00a0I recommend never visiting this place even with coupon/deal/ etc. \u00a0We would be better off ordering less food and real wine at a better restaurant. \u00a0We would probably pay comparable prices to this \"Groupon deal\" after tax and tip.Don't go!!!"], ["Rohan D.", "One of the first restaurants we came to when we first moved to Chicago as a family, then later I came here on my first dates out of the neighborhood I grew up in. \u00a0I like the touristy decor, the food is still good American-Greek with nothing fusion, pretentious, or nouvelle. \u00a0This is where they invented Greek-American, like saganaki (when we were in Athens as a family, dad ordered saganaki and the waiter derisively called us \"Americans.\"), both the cuisine and the restaurant style. \u00a0This is a dependable place to eat before downtown shows, you'll pay less than you would at the trendier places, and they will get you in and out more predictably. \u00a0There are two bars (not sure why) and they would never upcharge you for ordering Ouzo or Greek Brandy wihout ice. \u00a0 \u00a0 I lived for a while in Greektown way back when I was working my way though a couple of degrees at the University of Illinois Chicago Circle Campus (now UIC), and I asked myself many times, is the Parthenon really any better than the dozen other Greek-American restaurants around here? \u00a0Well no, but I've got a number of fond memories here, and it hasn't changed in a lifetime. \u00a0I find value in that."], ["Eric F.", "After moving to Los Angeles where there are very few good Greek restaurants I really began to appreciate the wonderful and authentic Greek eateries on Halsted St. in Chicago's Greektown. And of these eateries, The Parthenon is one of the most established. I have been going there since I was a kid. And little has changed since.First and foremost, this is one of the best places to get really good inexpensive lamb, including chops off the rack. Also, leg of lamb, and frankly any lamb dish here will be good and not expensive for what you get.Now to the meal. The Parthenon offers a large menu of traditional Greek fare, including specials that are especially authentic (like tripe soup which is delicious), plus combo plates, and family meals for sharing. But whatever you get, I recommend starting the meal with a glass of Retsina (a white wine with resin, which gives it a slightly turpentine flavor that is unique and surprisingly satisfying when matched with the food), and the Saganaki (cheese doused in brandy and then set aflame with the waiter shouting \"Opa\"). Once those two things are consumed, your personal meal choices can begin. The Greek Salad is good here, but the AgvoLemano soup (creamed lemon soup with rice or orzo) is more interesting. And don't even bother getting the Greek Salad if you are not going to have it with the anchovies (only my opinion but in Greece they looked at American tourists like they were from the moon if they didn't eat the anchovies). Another starter that I like is the Grilled Octopus (Greece is one of the few countries that favors octopus, along with Sicily, Spain, Mexico, Peru, and japan). Of course you can also get appitizers that have nothing to do with Greece even though we all think they do, like Hummus (chick pea paste with olive oil and tahini) or Baba Ganush (eggplant dip with garlic), which are both Lebanese dishes brought to Greece by the Ottoman Turks.Then of course there are fried Calimari Rings, which everybody likes, even kids (for them I think it's the Catsup, which adults are not allowed to use of course). As far as main courses go I am always stumped, because I really want the starchy items like Mussaka and Pastiscio (both are like baked Lasagna, but the Mussaka \u00a0is meat sauce and eggplant with beschemal cream, while the Pastiscio is meat sauce and wide hollow noodles like macaroni). But I also always want the meat to, like leg of lamb in a stew, or chops. There are about six types of lamb dishes at the Parthenon, all different cuts, and all different preparations, and the are all good. But whatever you do DON\"T GET THE GYROS (unless it is on the combination plate). Of course it is as good here as at any Greek Gyros stand in town. But think about it, you can't get lamb chops or Mussaka at a Gyros stand, so why waste the opportunity.Whatever you get... make sure to order the vegetable side dish of green beans stewed in tomatoes and served over rice. When I was in Greece, everyone ate this with almost every meal.For the real starch lover, there is also a Greek Spaghetti, which is surprisingly different and good (a nice dish for fussy kids). The sauce is burnt butter and Greek cheese.There are so many good things to eat here that honestly, I usually order a combo, because I need to taste everything.After the meal it is nice to have a Turkish Coffee (they call it Greek Coffee because they don't like the Turks, who ruled over the Greeks for 400 years), and a nice piece of Baklava. As a side note: the owners and the waiters and all Greeks are friendly and talkative. Be prepared to have at least one conversation with one of them. It is part of the meal."], ["AV G.", "I moved to Chicago in the mid 70's. \u00a0I worked at a Stereo store where we \u00a0sold an 8track with speakers installed for $49.99..

My girlfriend and i were so stuffed by the time the main course came around but I was super grateful that the deal let me try just about everything I wanted to on the menu.They first started off with bread which felt like it came from a supermarket stand. I really wish it had come warm and baked instead of cold. Still, I can never reject wonderful free carbs before a meal. The hot app came out pretty quickly and it was fun to see flaming cheese. The dish went really well with the bread served prior and though it was served alone, it definitely needed a starch alongside it. Next we had the hummus which strangely didn't taste like any hummus that I've had before. It had very subtle flavor but great fluffy texture to company the hot fried pita. Next came the salad and soup which were both pretty meh. Soup could've been warmed from a can -it was lemon rice- while the salad was decent only for the feta blocks. My girlfriend got the gyro and damn it was delicious. It was nothing like the stuff you get from a Coney- it was meaty and well seasoned. I had the chicken riganati which was an entire baked half chicken. it was super tender and had just the right amount of acid. The desserts here were nothing special but the impeccable service more than made up for deficiencies in some of the food. Fun times in Greek town! Almost took my entire entree home and that never happens."], ["Believer C.", "I love greek food, and I especially love dining in Greektown, but this was my first experience at this restaurant and it will be my last. I decided to take my date here on a Friday night at around 8:30pm. I was planning on dining at a different greek restaurant just a block away, but figured since we were already next to it, to give it a try. We walked in, and no hostess. I was a bit taken back cause the staff walked right by us and did not engage us with a smile, or hello, someone will be right with you.. nothing. 5 minutes past by and the hostess finally showed up. She sat us right away, but it seemed as if she was drained and unhappy. We look around the room and notice that we were surrounded by mature couples in their 50's, 60's, 70's.. There was absolutely no energy or laughter inside the room. The restaurant was beautifully decorated, but lacked energy and sign of life. The waiter comes by, and takes our drink order. 2 minutes later, a second waiter comes by to take our drink order. We inform him that a different waiter took our order. He looked frazzled and confused, not to mention that he was sweating and had greasy hair. Not exactly someone that I would want as my waiter serving me my food. The first waiter was no prize winner either, but nothing we could do at that point. The staff looked underpaid, unhappy, and overworked.We ordered a glass of cabernet each. I want my wine in a wine glass and unfortunately they arrived in smaller glasses. I asked the waiter to bring us regular wine glasses, and it took him forever to find 2 wine glasses for us. We ordered the greek salad for 2 to start with and when it arrived it was a dry little sad plate for 1. Normally, I love dipping my bread into the sauce, but this time.. there was no sauce to dip in. I ordered the octopus with rice and potatoes, and my date ordered the chicken. The octopus was ok, but the rice and potatoes was a dissapointment. It's normally my favorite part of the meal. As if things were not weird to begin with, that 2nd waiter comes back to our table and starts rambling on and on about the mix up that happened earlier. 5 minutes later, my date and I looked at each other in disbelief.The whole experience was like the twilight zone."], ["Melissah L.", "Came here with a Groupon deal and definitely got my money's worth!

However, when my mom and I started looking for a large room to host a get-together for my family after my wedding abroad, The Parthenon had far and away the best options as far as private room and event menus went, so we decided to give \u00a0a new place a try. Starting with the free valet service that they offer, everything at The Parthenon was great. The room we had was large and colorful, has a dance floor and stage, a private bar, and a projector and an audio hookup so you can play movies or slideshows and play your own music. The waiters and bartender were all very nice and helpful and our food came out at the perfect pace so we didn't feel rushed. We had Saganaki (flaming cheese), Greek Salad, Taramasalata (fish roe dip), Gyros with tzatziki dip, Avgolemono (egg lemon) soup, Moussaka (beef and eggplant casserole), Dolmades (beef and rice wrapped in grape leaves), Pastichio (a greek lasagna with noodles and beef topped in a bechamel sauce), Lamb, Chicken, Rice, Potatoes, Baklava, and Galaktoboureko (custard pie). Yes, it was a serious feast! Everything was delicious and everyone was totally overwhelmed by the crazy amount of food. After dinner we danced the night away until they told us it was time to go. The only downfall was that the room was incredibly hot, even with the A/C turned up all the way. We were definitely sweating when the dancing began.

We had already printed our menus off and picked out what we were interested in within the price ranges. No flexibility in ordering more expensive entres and paying the difference, we asked just to see what they said.I have liked the Greek Rose Roditis in the past but this tasted more like an even cheaper white merlot in an unmarked bottle (picture a LARGE box of Wisconsin White Merlot back there with a funnel). \u00a0We are going to go get some Roditis for a taste test and I will report. I don't think that house was the Greek Rose Roditis. But it was cold and wet and part of the $46 package, and of course we drank most of it. Update. Had some Roditis at the Greek Village in Schaumburg, MUCH better, they are decanting that stuff at the Parthenon out of boxes into unmarked bottles.Went with Flaming Saganaki for old times sake, were warned off the homemade sausage by our able server Peter and went with the Eggplant/babaganoush, good enuf. Went with Peter's recommendations on our choices and had the rotisserie lamb and the broiled octopus. Both were good, the lamb portion was ENORMOUS, we took home 2/3 of it, tender and not overseasoned and my octopus was also very tender and flavorful, and I took half of that home. The lemon soup was ok, so was the Greek salad. We went with the teramisu and Vanilla pudding wrapped in philo with honey, we thought both were good.Our bill was about $5, half the tax which Peter had told us in advance, and we tipped $19, nobody suggested any amounts but we can do the math on the hypothetical bill, and liked Peter's recommendations. So our total was $46 plus $24, $70 with LARGE leftovers. Service was slow and it's loud in there. I don't think we'll be backwithout another Groupon like that one. \u00a0We would probably rather find someplace to eat that has outdoor seating and better wine and just order a couple appetizers and split a main course, might be the same $46, but we thought the Groupon package was a DEAL and today we are FANS."], ["Tami S.", "My maternal grandfather had an oft-repeated saying: \"If anyone here goes home hungry, it's their own fault.\" Normally I reserve mentions of this phrase for jovial but fond reminisces around the family dinner table, but it TOTALLY fits in relation to my experience at the Parthenon.We (co-workers and I) had a group dinner here, and the food just kept on coming. It felt like we ate everything on the menu, but that'd be exaggerating. Barely. Service is \"family style\" in every sense of the word. You share the food. And the service was like \"family,\" too -- you're a guest in the restaurant. (Except you'll get a bill at the end.)In came plates of the saganaki. We got the show... alcohol poured over pans of cheese, then lit on fire with a woosh. It was especially good with the crusty bread that came to the table. The bread also went well with the tzatziki and the fish spread. The gyro meat was flavorful. I snagged a couple crispy pieces and was quite happy.Thoroughly enjoyed the lamb. Lamb is tough to get right (pun intended), but they do a very good job here. Chicken was tasty, but was especially good with a bit of the sauce drizzled on top of it.The Greek salad was really tasty. Lightly dressed but full of oregano. I could eat a whole platter of that for dinner and be happy. Yum to the pilaf and the potatoes as well. They also brought out plates of pastitsio and dolmades, which I did not try... but both looked good and were popular.Along with dinner, we had bottles of red and white wine (the Tsantali Rouge and Blanc). Both Greek. Both good. Don't hesitate to try them. And of course, they go well with the food.I can't eat baklava, so I couldn't try the dessert, but it looked tasty and well made, and others seemed happy with it.

There were eight of us in total and we had made a reservation. We were seated when all of us were present and did not have to wait to be seated (i.e. they had set aside a table for us). When they brought us back to the table it was not completely ready. They had not put all the place settings down and had to bring more white paper to put over the table. Okay, not a big deal but we were seated 10-15 minutes after our reservation time so I would think they'd have it all set up. We waited a bit for the waiter but it was nothing out of the ordinary. We ordered a bunch of plates of saganaki for the table and it came fairly quickly and was very good. Then we told the waiter we were ready to order but he must not have heard us and walked away. Once he came back everyone ordered. We sat for a while waiting for our food. When it did come out it came out in spurts (i.e. 2-3 people's food came and then a few minutes later 2-3 more plates came). My boyfriend and I were one of the first people to receive our food. We had ordered a chicken dish which was supposed to have vegetables on the side and a vegetarian macaroni dish. The chicken dish came out with rice pilaf instead of vegetables and both dishes were lukewarm at best. Both dishes tasted awful due to the temperature and must have been sitting in \"the window\" without being kept heated while they waited for other food to be ready. When the waiter came (he did not bring any of the food) I caught his attention and told him both dishes were cold and asked if we could have them heated up. Instead of apologizing the waiter looked at us and said, \"really? Both dishes?\" Yes, we want both dishes taken back and heated up. I then repeated what I had said, that both dishes were cold and seemed to have been sitting around for a while. When I said this he rolled his eyes at me, said okay, and walked away...without taking our food. He went to the table behind us and spoke with them for a few minutes and then came back to take our plates. He brought them back (the same food we had had) with vegetables instead of rice for the chicken dish several minutes later. The food was the appropriate temperature this time. The vegetarian macaroni dish was okay. Nothing to write home about. The chicken dish which was stuffed with feta and spinach was also okay but again, nothing I would order again or go out of my way to have. When the bill came we were charged full price for everything. I was not the person paying the bill so I could not complain but had I been paying I would have asked to speak with a manager. I did not deserve to have a server roll his eyes at me when I asked for my food to be re-heated. I'm sorry I know what food tastes like when it has been sitting around for a while after being cooked but I grew up and worked in the restaurant industry.

Out of the lamb dishes our server recommended the rotisseries-roasted lamb but he brought out the spare ribs. It was fine and I didn't feel like sending it back so I ate it. The meat was tender and fell off the bone but lacked appeal. The pile of roasted potatoes on the side were just there and unappetizing. The folks? A combination plate and the market whole fish. They were both pleased with their choices so that was a win for me. My date went with the kotopita. Crisp phyllo filled with chicken, veggies, smothered in a creamy white sauce. \"Not as good as when I spent a week in the Mediterranean\", she remarked.

Actually it was more like a Greek Tragedy. Appetizers were wonderful, Saganaki is hard to mess up. And so are meat and cheese pies that are wrapped in phylo. My dining companion ordered a T-bone steak as they were out of the NY strips. (As indicated by the waiter). Great, ordered the T-bone. When it arrived the steak was NOT well-done as he had indicated it to be cooked. It was hot pink on the inside a clear indication of a medium-well. You are probably thinking that is not a big deal and it isn't but unfortunately the steak smelled as if it had been marinated in garbage, shit and blood. The steak was rotten. Completely and disgustingly rotten. The kitchen had literally taken an old steak and cooked it. The manager came over and said, 'We don't specialize in steaks, we specialize in lamb but this steak is overripe.' Who the hell cares? And what the hell is 'overripe'? You had steak on the menu. Why not say that you are out of steak, like the waiter originally did with the NY strip?I had the braised lamb. It was not much more than a fatty chunk of meat that was covered in an unflavorful red sauce that was more grease than red. The rice pilaf was also swimming in this sauce. Disgusting. For $25 an entree, I am sorry but I expect more.Totally and completely unacceptable. And the last thing the manager said to my companion was that 'They didn't do it on purpose.' What didn't you do on purpose? Serve a disgusting rotten steak to someone you thought wouldn't know the difference? Shame on you.Never again. Never again.

However, I blame that primarily on our server. ((He brought on big attitude...imagine that...)). Why is it that when you whip out a Groupon or coupon of some sorts, servers immediately tune out? Not to mention I received a good amount of attitude and up charges when asking for accommodations due to food allergies and intolerances. The food itself was a mixed bag. Some things were amazing and others left me wishing I was elsewhere. My biggest complaint is the abundance of olive oil used in everything. Even olive oil can make a dish fatty and greasy...

This is the only reason why this review is getting two stars. I have been to the Parthenon before but usually with a company meeting or when I was younger, with family so I wasn't accustomed to dealing with the service. I had always noticed the kurt nature of the staff but attributed it to cultural differences. On Sunday, I decided to take my girlfriend to the Parthenon. I saw the Groupon they placed and it was a great deal. On the Groupon it clearly states to mention you would be presenting it at the beginning of the meal and to tell your server. When our server arrived, he seemed pleasant enough - that was until we mentioned and showed him the Groupon I had pulled up on my iPhone. He became instantly frustrated, rattled off what we were \"allowed\" to get, then grabbed the phone from my hands (without asking) to mark it as redeemed, then walked away without taking our order. I thought I was maybe being a little sensitive but my girlfriend confirmed that he was outright rude - which only got worse. As the night went on, he never checked on our table and we had to grab him to ask for refills, to take our menus, to take our order, and each time he was visibly annoyed. Then he pleasantly greeted the table next to us and I was about to get upset until they pulled out a printed Groupon. The server audibly huffed, snatched it from the woman's hand, and walked away. The woman at the table was surprised and gave a look to her partner. I asked the woman if the server was rude and she said, \"Absolutely!\" This happened to two more tables around us with Groupons. To the point where even the floor managers were rolling their eyes when the server walked past and whispered, \"Ugh, Groupon.\" It was almost like the staff wanted us and the other Groupon users to feel ashamed or guilty for coming in. But that's not even the worst part. After we were finished with our meal, (my girlfriend didn't even get what she ordered but felt scared to even mention anything to the server so she just ate what the food runner brought to her. Ps. If your staff is making your guests feel intimidated, you're doing something wrong) we waited a full 30 minutes for someone to come to our table. I had to grab our server as he was walking past our table and ask what the protocol was since we had paid and he said, \"You'll get a check.\" Confused, since we had paid, we assumed it was a formality and the check would be so we could tip.He returns with the check, sets it in front of me, tells me I have to pay taxes on the meal (which was not stated in the Groupon fine print) and details how much everything cost - as if I was a child. Then bluntly states, verbatim, \"You HAVE to tip me on the total. NOT what you paid for the Groupon.\" I was a server for six years while I was in college and I would have been fired for saying something like that to a table. I get it, you're annoyed that people bring in Groupons but to openly and flagrantly show your disgust and to make people feel guilty is childish, low, and unacceptable. If I hadn't previously been a server, I would have stiffed him but I felt bad and gave a reluctant 15%. As I we walked past the host stand, the manager just looked at us. I said, \"Thank you,\" and he didn't even smile or say a word. \u00a0I have been coming to the Parthenon since I was a child and this will be the last time I ever walk through those doors again. The obvious and outright disdain for not only us but those around us, seemingly supported by the management was unlike anything I have ever experienced. They lost my business and everyone that will hear this story forever. Whatever you do, just don't tell them you have a Groupon."], ["Li L.", "Great staff, very friendly.

My friend and I were choosing out a cake for my birthday and artopolis came up on yelp as highly rated for cakes, they supposedly have one of the best tiramisus in the city. Not that much parking in this area so we parked a few blocks away. We also ordered a chicken kebob plate with grilled tomatoes, rice pilaf, and tzatiki sauce. \u00a0I was able to try the mango mousse, tiramisu, and raspberry chocolate ganache cake. The chicken kebob plate was about $5 and had a decent amount of food on it, but not enough to justify the price. After trying the cakes I picked a mango mousse cake to order, and was not disappointed. The mango mousse cake is so light creamy and fluffy!! I would buy this for every special occasion if I had the chance. The other cakes were good as well but not enough to get an entire cake worth."], ["Jeana C.", "Pastries 4 stars and food 2 stars making it 3 stars. \u00a0 \u00a0We loved our dark chocolate mousse, tiramisu and lemon tart. Food, on the other hand, was a huge disappointment. None of our pizzas had enough spicy tomato sauce. In fact, the people who I was eating the inferno with all agreed there actually wasn't any sauce on the inferno. I believe they forgot to put it on. As a result, our pizza was dry. Besides not having enough sauce on the mushroom pizza, the overall combination of the ingredients just weren't on point. The feta cheese made it too salty. The orzo pasta with the beef wasn't anything amazing here either. I will not be coming back for the food. Only dessert."], ["Jill O.", "Artopolis is easily one of my favorite bakeries in Chicago. They're a cafe as well, but I've never come for anything savory. I head straight for the desserts!They have three or four bakery cases when you walk in, all filled with amazing treats. Behind that there is a display of all of their fresh breads. I have yet to have anything bad here. Most recently, we loaded up on baklava, chocolate-raspberry mousse, lemon tarts, and cheesecakes. The chocolate-raspberry treats were delicious. They're covered in ganache and are so rich, you almost think you can't finish a piece. Then, of course, you do. The lemon tarts I think are my favorite. They are just the right amount of both sweet and tart, the filling is thick without being too much. The crust is super crunchy and really sweet, which is a nice contrast to the tart lemon curd. The cheesecake... Well I never got to try that because my dad ate all of it. I think that's a good sign. The baklava is textbook and delicious, with heavy doses of honey and nuts with flaky pastry. I make a point now to come here whenever I'm in the neighborhood, and it's given me a reason to venture up to Greektown more often. I'd definitely recommend it. But, it's all so good looking and tempting, be prepared to walk out of there with a full box of treats."], ["Ken O.", "Three of us came here after having dinner at a near by restaurant for some desserts. \u00a0Upon entering, this bakery / coffee shop, I had noticed how lively this place is. \u00a0This place is very well lit and just a cool vibe.You walk up to the counter and start to look at all of your options for desserts, coffees, teas, and soda. \u00a0After placing your order, just find a table or seating area and your order will be brought to you. \u00a0The service and food were outstanding. \u00a0I would recommend this place for great service and food and a little time to relax."], ["Vaishali B.", "Love this place!

So order in advance."], ["Deena H.", "I don't speak Greek but this restaurant should be Greek for DELICIOUS. if you live anywhere in Chicago, you must visit this place and order the lukamadies. I might have spelled that wrong but regardless, the food here is really good. The ambiance, decor and service are all wonderful. If I remember correctly, the bakery has a ton of selections. The bathrooms are very clean too Street parking is scarce but it's right near the blue line at UIC Halstead. Just exit the Halstead side and head north. This restaurant is in Greek town and close to the University of Illinois Chicago campus. It is totally worth a visit or two."], ["Tiffany J.", "I DON'T EVEN LIKE UNSWEETENED COFFEE, BUT IF YOU'RE A COFFEE DRINKER THE ESPRESSO FREDO IS TO DIE FOR.

They give you some sugar on the side and one packet of sugar was just enough for me! Baklava, Almond Baklava, Kataifi: All of the desserts that I have tried weren't EXTREMELY sweet. It was just a nice hint of sweetness to it, but wasn't overpowering. I highly recommend the Almond Baklava, it was very flaky and you can taste just the hint of almond in it. ALL REALLY GOOD.

My co-workers and I came here for dessert after dinner. I had the mango yogurt mousse cake and shared with them. They all loved it - it was not too sweet, moist, and light. One of my co workers ordered their espresso tart - very chocolatey.. I thought it was very rich in chocolate so it wasn't for me but she really enjoyed it. My husband ordered their hazelnut prarline cake which he thought was okay. Really enjoyed just hanging out and chatting with some yummy desserts. Great bakery. Yummy desserts!"], ["Chrissey N.", "One of my favorite places to get brunch and lunch in Greektown- the artopitas are my favorite! They're buttery, flavorful, and flaky; they just simply melt in your mouth. Truthfully, the sandwiches are okay, they're pretty good but nothing special. The artopitas are what truly steal the show. The two free sides that come with food are their potato and pasta salad- I have had both. I think the potato salad is flavorless and quite bland, and that the pasta salad is absolutely spectacular. Most of the people I have brought here seem to agree.The atmosphere is nice, cozy, and a perfect place to take someone if you wan to sit, chat, and relax."], ["Judy L.", "This review is only for the desserts. \u00a0I ordered the Ekmek and the Valrhona Chocolate Mousse. \u00a0Both were only ok. \u00a0The Ekmek was flavorful with the Katiafi crust and the light custard and honey while the Valrhona was not sweet (bitter from the dark chocolate) and very one note. \u00a0I love chocolate, but this just didn't do it for me."], ["Eddie F.", "My Greektown Haven.

A group of us 4 girls came in to grab coffee and desserts around 4 p.m. on a rainy Sunday afternoon. It was packed! We couldn't find a host so we looked at the delicious treats behind the window and the girls working there were so helpful with helping us choose what we wanted to eat! The mango dessert was suggested more than the white chocolate dessert but my friend who loves white chocolate got it and loved it. There were two macarons left and we got the pistachio and vanilla one. I am picky about macaron's so if you are too- this is where to get them!Since we weren't getting them to go- we had to order by table service but we just sat down on our own with a help of a hostess. When we got our waitress she was very friendly and took time with our order. I got a hot cocoa, my friend got the Americano, and my two other friends got the frappe in which they were able to choose if they wanted it sweet, medium sweet, or no sugar. They both choose sweet. We all loved our drinks from the taste, quality, and presentation. Temperature was perfect and we enjoyed talking and mingling in a loud- chatter environment, \u00a0cultured with decorations and ambiance, with a large crowd of people. Perfect for families, large groups, or a semi casual/romantic date. I would love coming in here after a good meal or for just coffee with a macaron. I haven't tried them all, but I'm voting Artopolis as my favorite coffee/dessert place as I'm sure it is for many of the locals in and near Greektown. Can't wait to visit again!"], ["Linda B.", "Devine service and the food was delectable. Our waitress was 03 Mariia sugest her she was very informative. We came back for desert and coffee.

I like how it's a bar/restaurant and market in one. The food is good, although a little on the pricier side. My one request to the management: I wanted a simple pita filled with the tabbouleh, hummus, and feta that you had in the cooler. Essentially a build your own pita with all your existing components. The gentleman at the counter said I had to be charged for each of them as individual sides: pita, tabbouleh, hummus, and feta. They came out with portions much larger than I needed to fill a pita, and it cost $16! I wish it was simpler to get a simple Greek style pita that didn't break the bank."], ["Chary H.", "Four stars for the pastries. The tiramisu is my favorite in the city. Everything I've had so far has been delicious and fresh. The service, \u00a0however, \u00a0is very slow.

Had $40 worth of Groupon to spend here with a friend and I knew it would be no issue using it up.My friend and I considered ordering alcoholic beverages, but then decided on soda and whatever this one guy near us was having which was a frappe, and I could choose the sweetness level. I chose lightly sweet and my friend joked about putting in some alcohol but the waitress completely ignored the statement as if it wasn't even a possibility, even though we were kind of serious about maybe adding some Kahlua or Bailey's. Guess not.My friend ordered a sandwich, which comes with a choice of pasta or potato. She wanted a side salad. No, not possible. Not even an apology- just a no substitution attitude- you can have only pasta or potato. Ok, let's go for the potato then. No nonsense here! I ordered the 5 cheese pizza. I expected a very thin crust, personal pizza situation with a thin layer of mozzarella with maybe a smattering of other cheeses, but instead received a very doughy crust, huge dinner plate full of very cheesy pizza, showing the four kinds of cheeses that went into it and a huge glop of goat cheese in the middle. I would be lucky if I even finished half and took the rest home. I wasn't just lucky, I was enjoying it.We also had dessert, needing to make up the Groupon total, and my tiramisu was delicious, light in texture, but heavy on espresso flavor. Perfection. Because I had 90 cents left over in the total, our waitress offered me a couple almond cookies to take home to make up for it. I very much appreciated that- usually the restaurants say nothing and let you waste the rest of the deal. Plus, the cookies were really good- crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and tasted like marzipan, which I love. I will definitely be back- for the bakery, for the coffee, for the food."], ["Greta K.", "Great food at great prices! I love their Mediterranean salad!! And their mediterranean feast dish has some of the best hummus I've had. If your going to be there, dessert is a must! Basically anything you get is AMAZING!

Was kind of saddened to see Greek Coffee blacked out on the menu...so I went with a Iced Cafe Latte instead and split the galaktoboureko with my family.The galaktoboureko was interesting. It was a lemon custard wrapped in phyllo. We were surprised that it was brought out warm...which probably explains why the phyllo burnt on one end. First bite, pretty awesome. There was a good balance of textures from the flaky phyllo to the smooth lemony custard. But ultimately, we found the dessert to be much too sweet, from the added syrup they put on. And because we let it sit in the syrupy topping, it became ever more difficult to separate and eat. The atmosphere within Artopolis was nice and laid back. The upstairs loft seemed mostly occupied by students from UIC, while the lower central seating area seemed occupied by tourists and 'regular' customers fraternizing with the staff. The staff really doesn't seem to mind if you sit hours on end either.

This is a really cute space with a bakery, coffee and food section that is surrounded with table seating. We ordered the Mushroom Pie and the Chicken and Artichoke Pie. Both came with a side of our choice - pasta salad! The crust was so flaky and the fillings were delicious. We ordered a piece of the almond baklava to share and it was so good!

Both were not life changing, but good. There is tons of seating, and its got a nice cafe-like environment.

Fun to say and even more fun to eat. \u00a0For those two desserts alone, Artopolis gets the maximum stars. Baklava? Sure, they have it, and several varieties to boot, but after I sampled the supercalafragalisticexpialidocious melomakarona and the angel trumpets died down, suffice it to say, I was hooked. \u00a0Don't misunderstand, the baklava here is very good, and again, the variety is also a wonderful thing, but my taste buds adore this melomakarona. \u00a0And what exactly is this tongue tripping magical dessert I am crushing on? It is traditionally a Christmas cookie (but again, 5-stars to Artopolis for providing it year round). \u00a0Its primary ingredients are finely ground up walnuts, honey, olive oil, and everything else at the discretion of the baker. This cookie is oval shaped and moist, almost taking it into cake territory, but not quite. \u00a0The taste is like a very mild gingerbread. \u00a0To quote Candy Crush, (these cookies are) Divine! \u00a0I must always buy some when we're here. \u00a0 Galaktoboureko is another favorite, and not because it is so fun to rattle off. \u00a0Like baklava, it is a phyllo pastry dessert. Unlike baklava, it incorporates lemon custard and is doused in orange syrup. A slice of this with some coffee or tea around 3-4pm will be sure to dispel any afternoon doldrums.While those are the standouts for me, the other cookies, tarts, and pastries at the Artopolis bakery counter are also quite good and should not be overlooked. There is a cafe portion too, but my palate has been faithful to another Greek restaurant up the street, when lunch is concerned. On a slightly eclectic note, the shelves near the entry way with a variety of ouzo, evil eye charms, beads, and blown glass lamps are interesting to look over."], ["Annalee T.", "We have had Artopolis cater a couple of events at my work and they are always prompt and pleasant.

For example, you can ask Alex a million questions about the pastries, and she will answer all of them without a hint of annoyance.

Coworkers LOVED it and one even considered ordering cake from there for her wedding because the shortcake was so good.

I stop every time I'm in the city because their baklava is the best in my opinion. I purchased a box of almond baklava last night (at around $5 a pop). Got them home (three hours away) and realized it was nut-less baklava. Someone wasn't paying attention when making this batch. Accidents happen. It's understandable. The reason I am giving Artopolis a low rating is not because I received a poor product but because the manager attempted to make it right by claiming that the almonds were just ground up and I couldn't see them.......I dissected the baklava layer by layer and there are absolutely no nuts! I also tasted the baklava. No nuts! The only thing worse than the disappointment of the baklava not being right, is being fed a line. Being truthful goes a lot further!!"], ["Amanda S.", "Food is always good but service is extremely messed up.

Each day on our walk to downtown we passed Athena and admired the big, beautiful patio we could see through the window. Eventually we conceded that we must pay the restaurant a visit before the end of our trip.We made a reservation for Sunday night, and luckily so because the place was packed and we had to wait a little. Once we were seated our server was prompt in coming to introduce himself and bring water. We ended up ordering Greek wine wine upon his recommendation and dolmades to start. My friend then ordered the moussaka and I got the vegetarian moussaka. Everything was brought out very efficiently and was delicious. The moussaka itself was an extremely large portion and we each struggled to finish it.Overall the service was very solid and the restaurant seemed authentic with a majority of Greek staff. Having been to Santorini before I'd have to say that it really did give off a similar vibe. The white decor and patio brick wall with overgrown ivy and flowers really added to the ambiance."], ["Nataliya A.", "Came here for dinner with a friend because I live in the area and absolutely love seeing their patio. I was very impressed with food and service so I am not sure why all the negative reviews.We came in on a busy Wednesday night but got lucky and were seated right away. The server came by fairly quickly and spoke to us about food and wine options. After looking through the large menu we decided on the combination plate and saganaki to share.The food came out in good timing and the saganaki was spot on. Then the combination plate came out and we were almost shocked at the amount of food, it was a huge portion for the 2 of us. I am usually not a fan of the grape leaf rolls but they were absolutely delicious! What impressed me the most I think is the rice. So simple yet so delicious. There was a perfect balance of spices and moisture added with the peas, I could have some right now!

We promptly arrived but only to wait 40 minutes for our table. The host was apologetic whenever I asked how much longer it would take. To my frustration, he could not give an exact answer. First, he said our table will be ready once it is cleaned. But when I asked a second time, he stated there were four tables ahead of us. I was not pleased. The point in making a reservation is to skip a long wait. If they cannot handle the capacity, they should regulate the number of reservations to accept. We were eventually seated and we had no time to waste. For appetizers, we shared the saganaki and char-broiled octopus with lemon and olive oil. The octopus was light with a generous portion. Each piece was tender and succulent. The saganaki is the flaming cheese so do expect it to be a bit oily. It goes well with the complimentary bread or by itself. For us, one order was enough to go around. I think our waiter should have given us a heads up when it was brought out. Nobody in their right mind would want a flaming surprise within a few feet of their head full of hair. For entrees, we ordered six entrees: dolmades, mousakas, loukaniko, paidakia, vegetarian mousaka, and veggie kabob. The paidakia was the highlight of the meal. A plate came with five thin slabs of butterfly lamb chops. It was perfectly grilled with a heavy usage of Rosemary but it did not overpower the lamb's natural flavors. The meat was particularly tender and juicy. Along with the lamb chops were a side of rice and potatoes. The rest of the meal was average. The dolmades are rice and ground beef wrapped in grape vine leaves and drenched in an egg-lemon sauce. It comes with a side of green peas. If you are unfamiliar with the cuisine, the grape vine leaves are edible. We had the mousakas in two versions and their appearance is similar to lasagna. The ground beef mousaka came with eggplant, zucchini, potato, cheese, and bechamel sauce. The vegetarian version is the same but without the ground beef. Both came with a side of rice. The loukaniko is homemade Greek sausage served with a rice and potatoes. It has a slice spice and is great for sharing. The veggie kabob can be skipped. One plate came with two skewers of tomato, onion, eggplant, green pepper, and zucchini. The items were drenched in olive oil and flavors were extremely light. To end the meal, we shared three desserts. The baklava and galaktobouriko were delightful. The latter is a light vanilla flavored custard in honey dipped filo dough. Both were served in square pieces so it was rather easy to cut and divide among ourselves. The Greek yogurt was served with dried fruits and honey. It was highly recommended by our waiter but it fell short of our liking. The yogurt was very creamy and the fruits were exceptionally sour. For approximately $30 per person, we had more than enough food and we brought four boxes of leftovers home. It is a good deal for that price and the grilled lamb chops deserve a return. But I do not see us returning in the near future. We would not mind taking our exploratory cravings elsewhere with better management."], ["Tracy S.", "After reviewing reviews on yelp I saw this place and photos and thought we would try it out.Looks like they just did a makeover, the decorations and ambience were very updated and very nice.FOOD: we started with the fried cheese, and it did not disappoint.

Maybe the best patio I've experienced in Chicago. My husband and I went for an early dinner (6:30) without a reservation got seated promptly to enjoy an alfresco meal. The service was so friendly and attentive. Our meals were superb. We got a bottle of wine, the gyros plate and pork sausage for apps which were amazing and ended up being so much food. Entrees we got a braised lamb shank and lamb with artichokes. I requested that my rice and potatoes be subbed out with green beans and I was pleasantly surprised that they not only obliged but they put together a veggie mix complete with green beans, peas, onions, peppers and tomatoes. Absolutely amazing. The lamb was so unbelievably tender it just fell off the bone. The prices are so reasonable especially considering how much food you get!! And that patio.

No honestly a real Greek raised and born in Athens and i hate going to Greek restaurants abroad simply because most of the times they offer food thats not even greek or reminds you of something Greek.

Most of the dishes taste exactly as the ones you would have in a greek restaurant in Greece. Very good ingredients and a hige variety to choose from.Topping that is their wine list which surprised me with the variety of Greek wines they had.

That is how I felt with Athena. After seeing the amazing looking outdoor patio when passing by on Halsted I wanted to give it a try. To be fair the patio is very impressive. Open air on a beautiful night with an ivy covered wall and views of the buildings in Greektown is definitely an experience. Unfortunately that's the highlight.This could possibly be unique to my table but the service left a lot to be desired. We didn't order drinks for 15 minutes and once we ordered our maybe we weren't checked on the rest of the meal. My party agreed we would have ordered at least another round of drinks if we had the opportunity. At least there were authentic Greek beers available. They tasted similar to polish and other European beers that many Chicagoans might be familiar with. The food was standard Greek fare. Saganaki was a must, just a warning if you're eating outside it doesn't get flamed at your table to avoid embarrassing situations in which your hair might catch fire. The calamari was ok, here you get the large rings but no tentacles if that's your thing. My party agreed the best dish was the lamb loin chops that were on special. They gave three nice sized chops grilled well. Everything else seemed kind of blah. The combo plate was just stuffed with food. I don't think any of it was particularly great but it was a lot. My wife got the moussaka and it just seemed like there was a big tray of it in a warmer and a square just gets plopped onto the plate. The only thing I'd have to recommend is the saganaki. It was rich and lemony and amazing. Athena was a bit of a let down for me. You get a great atmosphere but really average food. If bringing someone here to show off the city and wanting a cool ambiance is important to you, this is your place though. Just don't expect to be blown away by the food."], ["Stefanie A.", "When the sun finally shines and the weather hits 70, the best place to enjoy dinner is outside.

A retractable ceiling allows for dining in this part of the restaurant even if an the weather doesn't want to cooperate.For dinner we had the grilled octopus app, swordfish kebobs, roasted lamb, and a side of the greek vegetables.

She only had one bite and left it all.Our server was not very courteous, welcoming, or friendly. \u00a0No follow up asking us how our food was or even attempted to make eye contact despite seeing that we were done eating and just waiting for 20+ minutes for him. It was not a full house and he clearly had plenty if time to ask his other tables around us how everything was and even take them all soda refills.So, \u00a0while I don't like to be unfair and judge a place based on ONE server, I decided to get up and ask for a manager which in turn was also a waste of time, not a single apology or even an attempt to fix the situation. With that being said, I am extremely dissatisfied and will never return. What a waste of $38, I would have gotten better service at McDonalds. Only reason they don't get a 1 star review is because the setting and food earned them the one star.Don't waste your time or money at this place."], ["Shannon N.", "Came back (9 years after my first visit...) recently for dinner, and had a great meal. \u00a0Started with the saganaki, which actually wasn't particularly great -- not enough of the alcohol burned off, oddly. \u00a0But shared a bowl of the excellent egg lemon soup and that made things better. ;) \u00a0I had one of the night's specials, a braised lamb dish that was different than their usual braised lamb dish, which another guest at the table ordered. \u00a0I think mine had lemon in it, and it wasn't a thick tomato sauce like my friend's dish. \u00a0I loved it. \u00a0He liked his, so that's a win-win. ;) \u00a0For my son, I ordered the appetizer Kotosouvlakia, chicken skewers, and it was a very generous portion of four big skewers cooked perfectly. \u00a0Awesome! \u00a0Another friend had the \"Chicken Breast Lemonati\" described in the menu as \"Strips of chicken breast saut\u00e9ed with vegetables in lemon sauce and served over rice\". \u00a0None of us liked this one - the chicken was meh, and it was just a big mess of veggies and some strips of chicken. \u00a0Rice was buried in there. \u00a0Definitely wouldn't order this one again.Service wasn't particularly great, but overall it was a great meal and I would return. \u00a0Definitely more of an upscale experience compared to the neighboring Rodity's, but I think I give them the edge on the food overall."], ["Adam K.", "Just love Athena.

I stepped into the restaurant feeling like I was on vacation in paradise. It was a perfect day and a perfect place to enjoy a nice sunny Sunday afternoon. The complimentary bread with the sesame was tasty. I tried the fried calamari appetizer which had gigantic pieces of calamari rings. While the portion and size were generous, the batter didn't cling to the calamari well and I wish they were smaller so it could be bite size. I felt like it was too big of a mouthful eating one whole piece but cutting it up meant the outter batter fell apart :(The entrees are also gigantic portion. I tried the combo plate and the beef kebab. The combo plate was a nice way to try a lot of their classic greek dishes. My favorite was the mousakas (layers of eggplant, zucchini, potato, ground beef and cheese, topped with bechamel sauce). The pastistos (like mac'n'cheese with ground beef) was interesting but probably not something I would get again, haha. I haven't had a ton of Greek food so this was a good option for me. The beef kebab was like the godzilla of kebabs! I don't think I got through more than 1/4 of it before calling it a day but the meat was tender and the veggies grilled well. The beef didn't seem like it was marinated; it was a pretty basic salt and pepper preparation so I wasn't overly impressed.Our experience was ruined a bit by all the bees that came around our table towards the \u00a0end of our meal. Not sure why but it was enough to make me want to dine and dash despite loving the actual seating area. I would definitely come back for the ambiance especially on a nice summer night!"], ["Allison J.", "Awesome outdoor patio for the summer! Definitely one of the best!! Food is average.

Veggies, rice and potato all very run-of-the-mill as well.It's Greektown, the options are endless...but I will say I love the decor and ambiance here."], ["S S.", "This is our second time here, and the food and service were fantastic.

He had many great suggestion. He would also be a great tour agent if you wanted to go to Greece! !

My co-worker and I were greeted promptly by a man in a jacket and tie and escorted to a table in a large, glass-enclosed dining room. There were three other parties seated at the time, lots of open tables, and enough waiters to fill a football team. We were brought bread and water shortly after being seated. No words, no eye contact, and no one ever came back. We stacked our menus and started looking around. No one took our drink order, no one looked at us. After 15 minutes we got up and approached a group of three waiters standing around. We asked them if someone could come by and take our order. They all looked at each other, said ok and then scattered in different directions like cockroaches. Still, no one came back. We got up and went down the street to Mr. Greek Gyros (yelp.com/biz/mr-greek-gy\u2026) where they don't have a nice, bright dining room or waiters, but do acknowledge you and take your order. One star, because zero stars isn't an option. Hard pass."], ["Zaad T.", "The food was OK. That's all I can say. I got the platter to get a sample of different dishes. Everything was dumped on a plate. The tastes were mixed. The sauce from one food was leaking to another. I end up not know what I actually ate! And what each was supposed to taste like. The staff were super nice though and the dessert was good. These two made it a 3 instead of a 2 star!"], ["Melissa B.", "This place taught me to stick with my Greek town favorites from here on out. My girlfriend insisted we meet here as opposed to our usual (Greek Islands). I don't think she will make that mistake again. On a Friday night it never filled up. We were there from 5:15 to 8:30 and it never once got crowded. The atmosphere was almost like a funeral home. I felt like everyone there wanted a quiet boring dinner. It's just not what I'm used to. The food wasn't good enough to make up for it. The grilled octopus the waiter recommended was chewy. The saganaki was good (hard to mess that up). My chicken kabob was overpriced and bland. It was a very tiny portion for the price. They didn't even put enough peppers and tomatoes on it! Dessert and coffee were good. Service was great! I would consider drinks on the nice patio in the summer. Then I would head elsewhere for good food!"], ["Believer C.", "This restaurant is very beautiful. I would say that out of all the restaurants in Greektown, this is a bit more lively and perfect for the under 40 crowd + they employ a lot more eye candy waiters than most Greek restaurants. Sorry guys.. there is a shortage of woman waitresses. The restaurant has a section where it opens up in the summertime and gives you a small glimpse of how it's like to dine in Greece. Makes your dining experience that much nicer. The food is your typical Greek food. It's delish depending on what your taste buds are like. I can't say that they offer dishes that are more unique than other Greek restaurants, but it's very consistent time and time again.

Left satisfied. They give you starter bread. But boring I was expecting pita or something more Greek. Water in the tables then they left a pitcher onwards. Started with flaming saganaki (?). Bit oily and they couldn't light it because we sat outside. Tasted \"greekish\" cheese. Not like feta cheese but more like fancy burned cheese dough. Ordered Greek salad. Bit disappointed as I ordered no dressing and olives. Came with both but the sever quickly changed it. Tasted plain can't say it's my favorite Greek salad because that's at Cheesecake Factory. Ordered rose wine. Bit bitter would only recommend it with snacks and not main course. I also ordered a Hillas beer. Quite refreshing with nice malts and hops comparable to blue moon meets a coors light.For dinner I ordered a gyros appetizer and my colleague what looked like a Greek version of lasagna. My gyro came with two pieces of pita bread. It was hard to eat because I was expecting a gyro type bread like for a sandwich. I tried some of the lasagna \"moussaka?\" It was quite tasty. We tried to order tiramisu for dessert but they were all out. Overall service lacked and I guess I wasn't sure what to expect because it was my first time.

I also decided to order a side of Cajun fries.I really wanted this place to hit the spot but it just didn't. I thought my starvation would work in their favor but it was a let down. First there is what I have coined as the Chipotle effect, when you don't get to the good stuff until you're half way through. I had to eat half some biga** wrap just to get to a part I would enjoy. While I have a big appetite I have a small stomach so by the time I hit the sauces and fries, I'm full. I couldn't stop though because it's exactly what I was waiting for. Needless to say, it just wasn't that great. The sauces and fries inside the wrap were its saving grace. I noticed almost everyone else in front of me order spicy wraps so maybe that's the way to go.While the wrap was whatever, the Cajun fries were sooooooo freaking good.

The owner Peter is one of the most friendly guys ever. A #2 with Chicken or Pork is a standard. You can get hot sauce as well on it. They load it with fries and all sorts of good stuff. If you're normal, you could probably break it into two meals, but go for gold and chow down if you ever go to S.P. kebab.I went there for years, its great bang for your buck.

The falafel is great, the salads are fresh and the fries are amazing (though I recommend ordering them as a side instead of inside the sandwich). The feta cheese is a great, distinctive addition to the falafel sandwich, and if you order it spicy, it's actually spicy. Sandwiches come in either a Lahmacun wrap, which is neater and easier to eat, or on a crispy flat bread that IMHO is tastier.

Yeah...). DO NOT go here if you want something halal or actual Turkish food. It's better for when you want to feel like you're eating \"ethnic\" but still maintain a white privilege hipster bubble.

As I started working my way through the Chicken Kabab, on bread with salad and spicy sauce, I realized there was one thing missing... flavor.

And this is not european style shawerma, doner or gyros either.First of all, if you are opening a kebap place you should do beef kebap too.

It's partly because it's one of the closer places to Logan Square, and also because they have plenty of parking. I had just left the gym, and was looking for a good way to gain back the calories I burned, so I yelped \"gyro\" and found Outdoor Grill. On the drive over, I was hoping that it wouldn't be a pain to find street parking. When I saw the nice private lot they had, it was a relief. But most importantly, the gyro sandwich was awesome.

He took all our orders swiftly and promised my soup immediately--which didn't exactly happen. We got our orders fairly quickly (3 #1s, an outdoor grill platter, the soup, breaded mushrooms and mac n cheese bites). And he still forgot my soup...eventually he brought it ): The owner noticed that all the seats in the restaurant only seated 4, so he told us we could grab a small table to extend the booth. After we had a few minutes to indulge, the owner stopped by and asked us what brought us here today. Since I'm usually the one in the group that looks at Yelp reviews, I told him it was my idea to come here and he said that many people had come in that day because of Yelp. And was happy to serve us. He seemed to take a liking toward my friend and his jokes, so the owner offered him a sample of a milkshake he had just made. Uhmm, okay? What about the rest of us?My gyro was decent; nothing to brag about. I tried some of the other things my friends got and again, not spectacular.

Burger, hot dog, and gyros with ice cream for dessert win me over. I will definitely visit this place once in awhile since I do drive pass this place often.

First up is Pita Heaven, a perfectly decent pick up and go place that offers solid off-hours dining (they are open from 10 to 10 err'day). Ordering is counter and food comes out in a jiffy.My go-to is the gyro wrap, decently priced with a heaping of Sysco-frozen, elementary-school crinkled-cut fries. The gyro meat isn't the best, but isn't the worst either. I like it far better than the kabob meat and bifteki, which are both too dry without being flavorful enough. Pita Heaven loads up the pita with a pileful of delicious tzatziki, so if you're a sauce fan, this pita is for you.The chicken wraps come, somewhat puzzlingly, with dijon mustard instead of tzatziki, which provides some insight into this place's target consumer base. If you weren't already tipped off by the Italian beef and hamburger offerings on the menu, that is. That said, the tzatziki is easily substitutable on the chicken shawarma or kebob wrap. Just ask.The baklava is packaged and available on the counter and always looks enticing, but so far I've managed to resist. Service is friendly and expedient, making this a good option in a rush."], ["Mia C.", "Huge portions! We ordered a Chicken Shawarma plate, a Combination plate and some Greek Fries.

The service is fast, the restaurant was very clean, but I felt like my food was missing some depth of flavor and balance. We ordered the gyro wrap which was a good portion, but had way too much meat and it was rather dry. The potato salad was good, slightly sweet in flavor. I've definitely had better gyros than this, but it was a pretty good price here. If you are looking for fast and quick and inexpensive, this is your place. For more tasty, authentic gyros, I would suggest somewhere different."], ["Dalia M.", "My boyfriend had a looooooong hair in is gyro plate.

The meat was neatly packed into the box with some salad and sauces on the side and pita blanketing over everything; it felt like I was eating at an outdoor bbq. -Mouthfeel was again, just ok. The kebabs were not that appealing. Tough, dry, chewy, bland; just a few words I would describe them as. -The cost was astronomical for basically a backyard BBQ platter. $13.00 for the meat combo and $6.00 for a small tub of tzatziki sauce an an extra pita? Way overpriced for what you get. If your only criteria is to be full and you have lots of dough, I'd recommend this place. Otherwise, your money is probably better spent elsewhere.

Although I don't walk by as much, today I finally decided to try a pita as my post-workout meal. And it was good, but not \"as good as it gets.\" Yes, I am a fan.I tried a falafel wrap because I'm a sucker for falafel. The bread around the wrap was pretty soft and pleasant, the tzatziki sauce on the wrap was a not-overpowering and a good accompaniment, and the veggies (lettuce and tomato) were fresh. The falafel itself was well-fried and had an interesting taste. But there were no pickles or strong garlic or spice flavors; the falafel did not have great herb flavors or a great crunch; and overall, it was lacking a little. I was happy with it and all. But it was nothing that would pull me back, like the super-green flavor explosion I've had at other falafel spots (such as Olive in Chicago and Oasis in Iowa City). With those other options, there is no reason to come back here... at least not for the falafel. The menu is quite diverse, so other options could be stand outs. The homemade potato chips that came as a side were actually quite good, so quality does not appear to be in short supply at Pita Heaven.The restaurant was clean (as others have mentioned), the staff was friendly, the service was super quick, and all the other non-food tangibles were good stuff. Pita Heaven is a convenient, quick, and not expensive spot that likely could appeal to many palates.

Maybe it's because I've been eating dry lettuce for the past three weeks but it was possibly the best gyro ever. It was so hot it nearly burned my hands off- definitely worth it.

The chicken shawirma had a load of chicken that was moist and very yummy. My plate the chicken rotisserie was a bit dry in my opinion, my brother however said that it was perfect. Who knows. The baklava they have here is... mediocre at best. I ordered 2 different types and they both seemed a bit old. Very soggy and not so much flavor.

I appreciate the generous portions, thinly cut onions, and delicious taziki sauce. Bread is always warm and perfectly chewy.

We brought half bottle of wine and poured the wine by ourselves ( no service person attended to serve us), well they still charge us $5. One more thing they round up your tax charge! My opinion if the business cannot get their liquor license, it's too bad. That's your own problem. In America, food portions are usually big. A petite woman like me I never order a whole entree for myself. I cannot eat that much I always share with my husband and friends. Beside most restaurants won't charge a fee for sharing a plate. It is even more pathetic that the owner explained to us that because the business was not doing well they had to charge extra fees. Excuse me? Should I care about your business is doing well or not?

I think if you aren't ready to be social she could be a lot to handle, but we just loved her. She basically told us was to order as newbies and even brought out a try of something we didn't order just because she wanted us to. We had the chicken (moist and tasty, but also not mind blowing to me) and the pastichio which was a huge bubbling hot portion of delicious meat and noodles and creamy sauce. Honestly the pork that my husband got was the best dish to me. Looking forward to swinging by when we are in the mood for something a little different on a cold winter nights this year and letting them treat us.

She ate half, and when the waitress returned asked if there was something wrong. \u00a0GF replied chicken is undercooked but besides that yes. \u00a0Waitress took dishes away and apologized.-Here's where it gets good...or terrible.-The waitress advised the owner of the chicken misstep, so the owner instructed the waitress to take $5.00 off our bill. \u00a0We thought \"great\" that was nice of them. \u00a0My gf slips the waitress a visa.-Waitress comes back and processed the visa but had forgotten to take the $5.00s off. \u00a0We asked why so she explained that she would only honor the refund had we paid cash!!! \u00a0Credit card processing fees = no refund.-We left scratching our heads and won't return.-Overall lesson for Mythos...If you are going to \"do the right thing\" please don't over promise then under deliver. \u00a0You are better than that. \u00a0We would have been happier had you never offered the refund in the first place. \u00a0I feel badly for the waitress because she was noticeably uncomfortable giving us the bait and switch routine that her boss advised her to execute. \u00a0 Stick to Greek Town for your Greek fix!!!!!"], ["Kelsey K.", "We went here with a group of friends and it was very good. \u00a0We really loved the food and the service was very enjoyable. \u00a0HOWEVER, I don't get this whole \"corkage fee\" thing and it really turns me off when restaurants do it. \u00a0Either fork up the dough and get a liquor license or be a BYOB. \u00a0Don't charge your guests to bring their own alcohol that they paid for already. \u00a0I know that it's legal in Chicago, but just because something is legal doesn't make it right. \u00a0We ended up spending over $30 in corkage fees for the group which seems superfluous. \u00a0Off my soapbox now. \u00a0If you're looking for fabulous, authentic Greek food, this place is a great option. \u00a0They are very friendly and the place is one of those old, divey Chicago finds. \u00a0The flavors are spot-on and the menu is varied. \u00a0I would definitely go back, just maybe not on a boozey night!"], ["MaryEllen S.", "After all the raves on Yelp I was expecting exceptional food, but most everything was just mediocre.

If I'd seen the owner's comments first, I'd never have gone to this restaurant. Totally unprofessional."], ["Ericka A.", "Amazing Greek food and a pleasant experience from start to finish. If I had any complaint at all, it would be that they are pretty slow. If you're in the mood to relax and in no rush then it wouldn't be a problem. Just be warned that it could take up to 3 hours from start to finish if you're with a group of 5 people.Everything is made to order, so the spanikopita, for example, takes about 30-40 minutes to prepare. Some of the other entrees also take about 30 minutes. We put our spanikopita order in first and everything came out together about 30 minutes later. Time flew and we ordered three appetizers to keep our appetites at bay. I recommend all of them. We tried the seasoned sausages, zucchini and Parmesan patties, and the saganaki. I would definitely order any of them again.The bread basket is small, but the bread is fluffy and filling. They serve it with a thick garlic-infused butter and you can order extra baskets for $2. Try not to fill up on bread though, because the entrees are where it's at. Each of us ordered something different and were impressed with each dish. We tried the half chicken, the biftekia, pork, spanikopita and the braised lamb. We all agreed that the braised lamb was the best. I had it with a side of feta and couldn't have been happier.For dessert, we ordered the orange cake. You have to get this. I'm tempted to return here just for the dessert if I find myself in the area again. It had the consistency of a thick angel food cake, but it was soaked in some type of honey (possibly with brandy) and orange syrup with a real candied orange on top. It was heaven on a fork.We split 3 bottles of wine during the meal and were charged $3 per bottle as a \"recycling fee.\" They were nice enough to chill the bottles for us in back and open them up and put them on ice.

We shared it.* Prices were reasonable and friendly.* Quiet and slower paced room, if that's your speed.NO NO NO* Did'nt ignite saganaki at tableside. Kids didn't like, was deprived of OPPAA!* We ordered 2 lamb shanks.One was brought out 30 min earlier. Old batch?* The lamb shanks tasted a tad bit salty. Told server but he did nothing.* They played what sounded more like Middle Eastern music than Greek music.* On a Friday night from 5:15 to 7:00, only 3 tables were filled. Something wrong?* Of those 3 tables, they were seated right next to us. Why cramp us in?* Was not greeted or visited by the friendly owner or chef.* Propped open door to save on AC, then let the bugs in?

The pastichio is absolutely to die for and easily rivals my father's, which I swear is the best around. The lamb chops, loukaniko, horiatiki salad... delicious. I also recommend the soutzoukakia (mini angus beef meatballs), which my sister ordered-- \u00a0they were fabulous. Finally, order the galaktobouriko for dessert. You'll thank me later.

In true Greek fashion, the meal does take a little while, but the food is lovingly prepared and more than worth the wait. Plus it's BYOB, so you can enjoy some wine and conversation before the food arrives. Vicki and Toni, the sisters who run Mythos, are warm and welcoming and always walking around to see how the meal is.

The place inside has robins egg blue walls, nice decor and well laid out, made me think that I was in someone's home. And I think that was the impression they wanted to give us. Very warm and welcoming staff, super friendly and helpful. We got the mediterranean platter, the angus beef meatballs, the spanikopita and the chicken souvlaki (mum doesnt like the bone-in chicken, so we got the next best option). For dessert we had the Orange cake. From the platter, I would recommend the taramosalata- GET THIS FOR SURE even if you don't get the whole platter. It is AMAZING, and from someone who doesn't eat fish, I could literally eat this every day. Mum thought it was super authentic too, and the woman has lived in Athens. The spanikopta is NOTHING like you will get in Greek town- very light, not fried at all, baked to perfection. Even the dampness of the spinach didn't affect the phyllo at all. Also, get the meat balls, those were really well prepared, juicy and well seasoned, and not dried out at ALL. I wasn't a big fan of the orange cake, since I didnt like the texture too much. It had a lot of syrup in it, which didn't appeal to me either, the base had the texture of grits - so not really like a cake, more like a baked sweet dish. We went over to thank the hostess after the meal and she was so warm and friendly- talked about Greece and life in general. I'll be back for those meatballs, and will definitely say hello once again.

My husband and I went there after seeing it on Check Please where they boasted about the restaurant's moussaka. When we got there, we were told the moussaka is only available on rare special occasions. The chef recommended the pastitsio instead. This is a heavy dish full of pasta and mashed potatoes so my husband and I wanted to split it. We were charged a $5 fee for that. This place is byob and so we were charged another $5 for corking. The latter, while on the high end, is more understandable. But we spent $10 for nothing; to line the restaurants pockets. And if we had a party of people, they would have charged each person $5 for every plate shared. This is anti-Greek custom of filoxenia where family-style sharing is part of the culture. We could have had another dish or dessert for that price. I'd rather pay higher prices than see that they penalize me for eating there.

The place was pretty snazzy feeling with teal walls, tan seating, and dim lighting. This place would almost feel romantic if it weren't for the noisiness, a common consequence of high ceilings, minimal partitions, and hardwood flooring. It was actually hard to hear my fianc\u00e9 sitting across from me. I had actually just driven 10 hours from Kansas and was feeling really nauseous but the staff was great, the hostess made sure we got bread right away and was concerned but not over-bearing. Our waiter was helpful with the specials and made sure the order was put in almost the moment we sat down since it would be a 40 minute wait for their signature dishes. Waters were promptly filled and the menu warns you that bread and other things take a while because everything is almost made to order.Food: The zucchini...fritter.. appetizer was pretty tasty. It was piping hot from the oven with a crispy cheesy crust and warm fluffy center. The feta cheese spread was two balls of herby cheese served with freshly toasted/grilled-tasting bread which was light and enjoyable. Both the appetizers tided us over until our food came. The roast chicken signature dish which you wait 40 minutes for was excellently cooked, moist and tender with a salty peppery skin... but the spices were nothing revolutionary. The Greek lasagna which took similarly long to bake was a ziti pasta topped with uniquely-spiced ground beef topped with a thick fluffy cheese layer that reminded me of marscapone, a hint of sweet and creamy. The rice was really not that great, one of the worst I've had at a restaurant but the accompanying green beans were really tasty with some magic spiced tomato-y sauce.Overall our meal was pretty heavy on cheeses with the chicken and rice being the only truly light dish. The dishes were all tasty but I never once had mind-blown. Aside from the lasagna, none of the spices or herbs were strong in flavor nor very memorable. This place seems to excel in one thing, freshness. Our fritters, chicken and lasagna were freshly baked, our feta bread freshly toasted. The flavors are subtle and the textures excellent but in the end I was waiting 45 minutes in a noisy restaurant and paying a premium for food that was not boring but also not exciting. Again, the food might be a 3.5 but we appreciated the excellent service, nice decor, and their gourmet emphasis on freshness (whether that is worth the wait/cost is up to you)."], ["Richie D.", "Due to all the positive reviews on Yelp, I'm a bit nervous to post this review...but I'm gonna keep it real by sharing my honest opinion.I was ultra excited to try Mythos Greek Taverna out for the first time. \u00a0Vicky Zervas, the owner, boisterously greets each guest with enthusiasm once you step in the door (just like the aunts you see in My Big Fat Greek Wedding). \u00a0She loves to take care of her patrons, and this is completely obvious. (If you don't believe me, read the other reviews. \u00a0You're at home in the Taverna). \u00a0Greek food is within my top favorite 3 cuisines and I couldn't be in a better U.S. city to experience the most authentic specialties...at least when it comes to Chicago's own, Saganaki \"Flaming Cheese\". \u00a0I ordered the Saganaki here and unlike Katie's remarks, it was exceptionally crispy and tart with lemon juice. \u00a0I even dare to say that it is better than Greektown's Parthenon's Saganaki where it is said to have originated. \u00a0On the other hand, Greektown at least ignites the flame with a grand olde, \"OPAA\" which makes the customers gasp in awe. \u00a0Mythos does not provide such a show, as noted on their menu. \u00a0Still, the Saganaki along with their homemade bread that is served at every table is heaven.As for the rest of the dinner, the entrees are pretty overpriced starting at $15+. \u00a0The amount, quality and flavors of their food just aren't all there like Greek Isles and the Parthenon. \u00a0I wanted to try the oven-baked Grecian-style Roasted Chicken Reganati rubbed with oregano and sea salts (which is tied as the taverna's best entree with the Pastichio, per Vicky) however I was steered away at the 40 minute cooking time. \u00a0By the time my lukewarm, fatty Lamb Shank had arrived 35 minutes later, I determined that I should have just waited a few more minutes for the well-known chicken.I'm wrestling with myself about whether to support a friendly family-owned restaurant versus the touristic, theme-based, yet more authentic tastes of Greektown. \u00a0I doubt I'll go back to Mythos because it didn't blow me away (flame or not), especially for the price. \u00a0Location, on the other hand, being located outside of Greektown on the northside is a plus. \u00a0Keep in mind, although Mythos has a little bar inside, it sells no alcohol--BYOB."], ["Brittany K.", "My husband and I went here on Friday night and it was absolutely perfect. The waiter we had was very knowledgeable about the menu options and suggested dishes that we could share; we had the Pastichio and the braised lamb.

As we live right down the street from here, we will definitely be back for some deliciously authentic Greek food."], ["Chrysa L.", "My Greek bff told me that Mythos has the best Greek food in the city. She makes amazing food herself so I decided to trust her. I would say that it is an accurate assessment.Delicious tzatziki (cucumber yogurt sauce), tiropitas (phyllo dough stuffed with cheeses), and loukaniko (Greek sausages). I had heard that the pastitsio (like a Greek lasagna) was really good and since it is one of my favorite dishes, that's what I ordered. It is served in a huge glass bowl. The waiter slices it up and plates it. You know it is made to order because they give you fair warning that it takes 35 minutes. It was worth the wait. \u00a0I had one slice left over the next day and was scooping up every last morsel.The place is BYOB, which is nice. The service was somewhat slow. I don't know if it is because our group was on the bigger side, but the pace probably could have been quickened a bit.I think when I am in the mood for Greek food, I will probably skip Greektown altogether and head straight to Mythos."], ["Yvonne Y.", "Fresh, tasty Greek dishes being prepared upon ordering. \u00a0Had the spanakopita and braised lamb shank. \u00a0Heavenly. \u00a0You may find the lamb shank a bit too salty. \u00a0They have nightly specials like fried pork chop and moussaka. \u00a0I heard they only serve moussaka once every two weeks. \u00a0Will definitely be back for the pastitcio and other dishes. \u00a0Be prepared for a long meal as they prepare everything from scratch. \u00a0Helpful staff who provides lots of details on the dishes and are very friendly to families. \u00a0Tips: \u00a0BYOB, pay in cash to get 10% off, allot 2 hours for your meal"], ["Erica P.", "Love this place, by far the best Greek food I've had in a loooong time!

First because it's not located in Chicago's Greektown; far from it. Second because it serves food far better than the typical Greektown restaurant. You can walk or drive past this restaurant on Montrose Avenue and not notice it. It is unpretentious and welcoming. It has no liquor license. No valet parking or a parking lot (though street parking was easy on a Saturday night). But it has what matters most: care and focus on delicious food.The menu is deceptively sparse. The dishes are carefully selected. The service is friendly and attentive. And the atmosphere is truly convivial.During my recent, first, and certainly not last visit, our party tried the zucchini fritters, tzatziki, horiatiki salad, pastichio (Greeks' notion of mac and cheese), \u00a0braised shrimp, veal chop, and biftekia (grilled meatballs). For dessert we had yogurt with sour cherry syrup, bougatsa, and orange pie.The appetizers were great; the fritters quite notable.The grilled meatballs were outstanding. Moist, nicely grilled, with fragrant spearmint, just great, as close as you get to the real thing.Pastichio (tubular pasta, beef sauce, bechamel, all baked together) was also great. It takes about 45 minutes to prepare because they bake it fresh. The ground beef filling was perfectly seasoned with cinnamon, cloves, and a touch of nutmeg. It doesn't get more homey food that this. Worth every minute of waiting.The veal chop was an exercise in perfection-through-simplicity: good quality meat, barely seasoned with salt, pepper, oil, and lemon, grilled to perfection. Very good.The braised shrimp were good as well. Not as garlicky and I'd like them but a perfect combination with the rice and the green beans.What was out of this world, I-cant-believe-they-make-it, was the orange pie. It's some sort of lumpy semolina custard, flavored with orange syrup, and topped with a slice of orange preserved in syrup. The nearest thing I remember is \"kousmeri\", a local delicacy in Ioannina, Greece.In a town where Greek desserts are limited to baklava and kataif and other syrian/ottoman varieties of syrup-soaked pastry, this orange pie stands a cut above them all. It speaks volumes about Mythos and the care its owners take to provide patrons with honest-to-Zeus, home style, Greek food."], ["Louise M.", "Came here for dinner several months back on a week day. It definitely wasn't worth the drive fighting rush hour from the suburb to dine here. Atmosphere was so so, I mean they had a christmas tree in the middle of spring - clearly not the holiday season. Some of the dishes were really good, and some were just meh. I went with a big group of people so we got to try many of the appetizers. The appetizers were great. I was loving the spanakopitas, the sausage, and some other stuff that I unfortunately forgot. But the entrees were just ok for me. I ordered lamb and the lamb was good but I hated the canned veggies they served the lamb with.Yeah - meh, summed it up.Update 08/19:To Tony D - Sorry about the meh rating. I would review it the same if it was fresh or later. However, I didn't say I was disappointed. I liked some of the stuff I had there as it was delicious.

I will give it a try again sometime soon when I'm in the neighborhood if you didn't agree with what I said."], ["Bj M.", "To bad I can't give zero stars. In all my years of waiting tables and eating in Chicago, I've never experienced a chef coming out of a kitchen to berate the customers. We went there because my partner had a good meal there and it seems from reviews you either have a good or horrible experience. The waitress was nice but didn't seem very attentive. The saganaki was cold but they did remake a decent one. The chef explained that they don't have a warmer plate. We I ordered rice pilaf with my steak it came back with tomato sauces and the green beans looked horrible. From what I remember rice pilaf doesn't have tomato sauce. That left me with a steak that just flat out tasted funny. Regardless we tried to be nice about it and when we complained to the waitress she looked like a deer in the headlights. You could tell she didn't want to tell the chef. The chef came out and I asked if we could just have it taken off our ticket. She said no and began arguing with us. We ended up paying full price for a horrible meal and the chef berated us, told me to act like a lady and shook her finger at us. This is a spotty, horrible restaurant and yes, stay in Greek town for good greek food. Or take your chances and hope you don't get yelled at if you don't like the food. \u00a0If the management is the same as the staff then they won't be around for long.There is a first for everything and this was it....yelled at by the chef and still had to pay full price for a meal I didn't eat.

Who knew?A friend and I went here last night at her suggestion for a somewhat impromptu dinner out. She'd been here a couple of times and loved it. It was either Mythos or La Gondola, and as much as I love LG, it was time to try somewhere new.We were one of the first tables to be seated at about 6:30 and we were given a lovely table by the window. The inside is split into two rooms and both looked to be equally charming.We decided on splitting the fried zucchini for an appetizer. After about 20 minutes, we still hadn't gotten it, but once it arrived, the delay was forgotten. It was delicious and just lightly breaded and the fresh lemon was a great complement.For our entrees, we both ordered the Chicken Regante, which came with a choice of rice pilaf or roasted potatoes and today's vegetable. The waitress advised us that the chicken took 45 minutes to prepare as it was cooked to order. That was just what I wanted to hear. You order something similar in Greektown and you get it in 10 minutes because it's all prepared in advance. Me no like that. I want fresh food.Waiting all that time for our mains gave us the opportunity to catch up so we didn't mind the wait at all, especially once the food got to our table.The half chicken was nice and crispy, and sitting in a pool of light sauce of olive oil, garlic, lemon and oregano. It was really juicy and flavorful and light years away from the cafeteria food one finds in Greektown. The potatoes were fantastic too, but I was hoping we'd get green beans with our meal as several others had raved about them; instead we got mixed vegetables, which I am not such a fan of. They just remind me of the nasty Swanson tv dinners I had to stomach growing up. After a leisurely dinner, we were presented with the bill, and as others mentioned, we were given two totals: one at \"regular\" price and one with the 10% cash discount. I knew ahead of time that they offered this so I made sure I had cash on me.

I really enjoyed the spanakopita; the pastry was buttery and flaky while the spinach and feta filling had a very good ratio and nice texture. The chicken (which was actually a half chicken) came with a side salad and a loaf of bread, the latter of which I found rather stale. I loved the vinegar sauce that came with the chicken; I just wished there was more of it given that the chicken was rather dry and somewhat tasteless once you got past the drumstick. I also loved the steak fries, which went extremely well with the vinegar-based sauce (despite not being a fries person!)The standouts of the night were easily the steak fries that came with the chicken as well the spanakopita.

We were told to go to the ATM around the corner. When I said we were going to pop over to our bank, the older lady (the owner) at the register made a face and demanded to know why we wouldn't use the ATM that was right next door. She loudly asked again and made a comment about us not being able to pay for our meal, eventually an older gentleman stepped in and told us to go and come back. Which we did. Today I realized that they had in fact charged our American Express card for our dinner despite the fact that we paid in cash. When the same woman called me about the error, she was again rude. Instead of apologizing for the mistake she yelled at me and even blamed the waitress saying she was new even though the older lady admitted that she was the one who charged our card and had meant to void the transaction. In the end, I told them to just keep the money. Like I said, fabulous food, really nice servers but rude management even when the mistake is theirs.UPDATE Omigod! I have to add after the above encounter the owner began texting me late at night on a Sunday. Arguing about how there was no evidence that they had charged our card. I sent them a screen shot that showed the charge and she continued to say that it wasn't charged. Hello?! You are looking at a screen shot complete with transaction id for the charge you made to my card that you're saying you didn't make! I have never had a business owner ever send me texts with snarky comments and combative arguments. I'm still shocked that this is how they do business.

The outer skin was blackened, the inner meat was succulent, juicy, flavored to the bone, and served on top of the Greek fries.Those fries were something from another world too.

I couldn't finish the whole meal so took the rest home - but as you would assume, the fries were no longer crispy when reheated. So eat your full when they're fresh!!! The boyfriend got the gyro and he hungrily scarfed it down. He loved it! I will say it didn't make for great smelling burps when he was drinking beer later but he sure enjoyed that gyro! The waitress suggested the feta and it was great feta but .. I didn't just want to eat feta alone. They should make it a feta and ___ dish to that highlights the feta but doesn't leave it just by itself. Adorable and intimate place in Lincoln park. The food is filling and tasty so get ready to leave a little fluffy (and maybe take a nap after)."], ["christoph g.", "I always wanted to give Athenian Room a try since I live in the area so we decided to try it for dinner last night. I scanned the Yelp reviews and they were mostly positive so we went expecting some good Greek food. The atmosphere is cozy and had a good buzz about it. The food was so disappointing though. We ordered the soup expecting a tasty Avgolemono but it was basically a bland rice soup that was obviously reheated numerous times. The salad was a chunk of iceberg lettuce with two slices of tomatoes and one olive. The shrimp appetizer was obviously brought in then straight from the freezer to the deep frier. The pork kabob was so dry it was hard to swallow. The flank steak was tender but so salty my girlfriend couldn't even finish it. If you are in the mood for some authentic and fresh Greek food I would recommend that you keep south on Halsted about 22 blocks until you are in Greek Town and try some of the options there."], ["Phil T.", "Totes great comfort food if you grew up eating gyros as a kid. This is basically no thrills just concurrently great food with great service. Food comes out fast and full of flavor every single time. The taramosalata is waaaay beyond addicting and is a must order for an app. The soup that's only served during winter is the standard lemon rice soup but still very good and again comforting flavors. For entree the gyros or the chicken you can't go wrong with either. I basically choose if I want white or dark meat and that decides the dish both of them are pretty equally Delish. For Athenian I tend to lean towards gyros bc im always eating chicken. Every time I'm glad I do bc they are Delish and full of flavor. Best thing about this place is you don't walk away with gyro burps like you do with other places. :-). Those be nasty!!The Greek fries are great but I like to change it up and do the feta fries. Both are good!"], ["Hilton B.", "Always good. \u00a0Have never gone wrong at this place."], ["Hannah C.", "We ordered the gyro dinners. Gyro was good, if a little dry - although that was easily remedied with the plentiful tzatiki sauce. The fries were absolutely amazing - fresh, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and flavorful. Some people got significantly more of the fry sauce on their plates - and I would have liked a little more since it was so tasty! The baklava was great - it was less sweet and more cinnamon-y than most and very moist. A great treat! Pretty good food and fast service at a reasonable price. A good spot to have near your apartment."], ["Kate G.", "OVERRATED. \u00a0Sorry, Athenian Room. \u00a0Go to Greektown please! \u00a0Bad parking (unless you valet), small space, inattentive servers and mediocre food. \u00a0Someone raved about their \"Greek fries\" but it's just olive oil and herbs on top of chunky steak fries. \u00a0Meh. \u00a0Look somewhere else for authentic and more delicious Greek cuisine."], ["Christa F.", "We hit up Glascott's one evening recently and ordered from the Athenian which is attached. It's kinda nice that a non-food bar has a restaurant attached to the rear!I ordered the Chicken Kabob Dinner. It came with Greek French Fries (uh?), Pita Bread, Tomatoes, Onions, and Tzatziki Sauce for $10.50. They failed to add Green Peppers to the list (bleh), but I removed them. The chicken on the kabob was nicely grilled and had a great flavor! The french fries were good too (with all the Greek seasonings), but the olive oil and butter that they had been tossed in got poured onto my plate. I couldn't make a pita with the meat and bread due to how soaked the pita was with all of the grease. That was a huge negative to an otherwise great dish!The boy ordered the Gyro Dinner. It came with basically the same thing that my dinner had. His fries were not all greasy like mine. It was almost as though they tossed both of our fries together, took his out, then dumped the rest of the stuff on my plate.The gyro meat was piled very high! All gyro meat comes from the same place no matter where you are in the country. I don't think people know this. So, unless the restaurant is making it themselves, it will taste the same as the next place you go to. The important thing is that they keep it moist. This was dry, unfortunately. Still tasty, but dry. The waitress that came over from the restaurant was friendly. It didn't take a long time to receive our meal. It did seem to take a while to get our credit card back. That could just be due to the 2 places being separated.This seems like an ok neighborhood joint. There were a couple of things that they could improve on though just to keep their dishes consistent from customer to customer."], ["Molly M.", "One of my fav local spots. Great for dine in or take out. Very large portions! I always get the gyro dinner with Greek fries, but if you are in the mood for a burger, it is also really good!"], ["Lucy W.", "The thick cut fries are delicious.I just wish there was a vegetarian option other than a salad!

And it is offered with one of two sauces: traditional yogurt and garlic sauce, or a red sauce similar to BBQ. Get the yogurt sauce.This is not the Gyros you will get outside of Chicago; which is mostly lettuce. Th Gyros here are all meat, overflowing so that you need ten napkins, The secret is that they use the Chicago based Gyros meat spools that rotated perfectly on the vertical cookers. The best places for Gyros in other parts of the country are the ones that use these same Chicago spools (never get a gyros that comes pre sliced and is warmed on a grill). The Athenian Room also offers Souflaki, Greek Salads, and thick steak fries. Get the fries. They're good.You can eat in or take out. Both are great. But the place is not quite a regular Greek restaurant. It is more like a fast food Greek Place with table. They do not offer alcohol as I remember, but it is adjacent to a bar with a door going directly to it.Eat a Gyros here. You will not be disappointed. I love this place."], ["K K.", "True Chicago Staple - have been Craving their food for almost 25 years.

It's a regular in my book & I'll keep coming back!"], ["Mario D.", "Been here one time I must say I was impressed. Place is old and not updated but the food was good.

I mean it's 2015Other than that the steak I had was so good I will go back again."], ["Dominique M.", "Small greek salad was big enough for two of us to split and was delicious. Tarmosalata was also very yummy and they gave us french bread and pita bread with it. I ordered the gyro dinner and my friend ordered the feta burger. Both of our fries were drowning in juice under our sandwiches, although they were good. The burger was supposed to be served on a pita but came on a regular bun, although we were hungry and ate it like that anyways. Huge chunk of feta came on it as well. The gyro dinner was HUUUGE. Supplied me with enough gyro meat to eat as leftovers for 2 nights after. Everything was seasoned perfectly and cooked to perfection. We would've preferred to sit outside, but there was a long wait so we settled for the little table in the back corner of the restaurant."], ["Rahul G.", "I went to this place for the first time in several years the other night. Still so good. I used to live right around the corner and it was my go to. It can get crazy busy so make sure you go at a good time, no reservations. I love their gyros, so yummy. The fries soaked in the oil/lemon juice is amazing, so flavorful. Service can be hit or miss, with the ladies running around everywhere. The food comes out quick though."], ["Lisa D.", "This place was very disappointing. I took my parents here for dinner and as I ordered my food I asked for additional tomatoes. The response of the waitress was \"sorry, we don't do that here.\" What? What do you mean 'we don't do that here?' I just thought it was very strange. The service remained very poor and I was very disappointed."], ["Jonathan S.", "My parents were so great to do take out to my place. \u00a0Avgolemono soup was our starter. Followed by a gigantic Greek salad with enough feta cheese to feed a small village. Finally I had an amazing King size gyros, pita on top of meat, resting on a batch of incredible Greek fries. I showed such restraint by only eating 2 fries and really only ate a little more than a third of everything but it was fabulous. \u00a0Thank you for a great meal. ~Jonathan"], ["Maggie M.", "Good place! But the prices on here are all wrong!! Please check with their internal menu before you order!! Gyros salad said 5.50 on The yelp menu-- then showed up and it was double. $10.00 still a great deal!"], ["John W.", "Honestly this place would be an amazing place to eat but there are a number of flaws holding it back.The service is poor. The waitresses are lifeless and often make you wait a long time before picking up your check.The owners nickel and dime you for stuff that should be complementary. For instance, sodas don't come with refills and you have to pay an extra 50 cents for a second pita when the gyro dinner clearly comes with enough meat for two gyros. They also take a maximum of two credit cards for a table.Quality control is poor. I've had some of the best gyros I've ever had here and also some of the worst. At times the gyro meat is very succulent but frequently it's very dry. Almost dry to the point where you would want to send it back. The skirt steak is very good but it will never be cooked the way you want it so I don't think they should even bother asking you how you want it. By the way, they've raised the price on that from 14.50 to $17.Other than that, the place is cramped. If you can get past all these flaws it's a good place to eat, especially if you're lucky and come at a time when the gyro is fresh. Try to avoid off hours because they'll serve gyro meat that's been on the spit for too long. Oh, by the way, when they ask you if you want feta cheese - that costs extra, not that they'll tell you that unless you ask."], ["Kristine N.", "Delicious food! You can bring it over to Glascott's to eat while watching a sports game, or you can bring drinks from Glascott's over here nice set up.We ordered the kalamata chicken which came with salad, bread, and fries.

I've heard the gyros are pretty good also. Maybe I'll try them next time!"], ["Sabrina A.", "I like this restaurant very much. It is very inexpensive for very nice quality food. It's a little cramped yes but if you come on an off hour it won't be bad.

This place is one of Chicago's hidden treasures. The Athenian chicken is by far the BEST that Chicago has to offer. You get a half chicken that is baked in the oven with their secret recipe of wine and Greek herbs. Included in your order are their steak fries, Greek salad and bread. If you want some extra secret sauce they will take your dish and add more secret sauce to your dish. If you want some extra secret sauce on the side, this is not allowed so don't ask. Try it yourself and see.Their homemade Taramosalata (Greek Caviar) is a must have!Another dish that is well known is their Athenian steak. The portion is so big that they have to fold both of the sides of the steak in order to fit it onto the plate. For dessert you have to try their baklava simply delicious."], ["Dana C.", "Am I missing something? Why do people love this place so nuch? Went here with my boyfriend we both got the gyros.

If I hadn't had such high expectations from all the hype I may not have been so disappointed.

Cheap, delicious, you can't go wrong!"], ["Leslie S.", "Our friends highly recommended the Athenian, and so we went with them one snowy evening in January to try the much-praised Kalamata chicken. For both me and my husband, it was a disappointment: chicken absolutely soaked in vinegar is not something that appeals to either one of us. We were expecting chicken with strong lemon flavor, and what we got was a big drink of vinegar. The Greek fries, underneath the chicken, were so soggy by the time they reached the table that they were really inedible. The chicken was also served with a salad, which was rather bland. If I ever found myself at this restaurant again (and for me, it wouldn't warrant a second trip), I would request the \"juice\" on the side of the chicken, and I would skip the salad altogether. I like a glass of wine with dinner, and so the whole idea of walking next door to order a beer or cocktail mid-dinner doesn't sit well with me. I am really puzzled as to what kind of license the Athenian has, and why its customers can't BYOB if they can go to the bar next door and bring back a drink. I would infinitely prefer to bring my own bottle of wine, rather than leave the table twice to refill my drink. (Above all, I would prefer the waitstaff to bring me another glass or bottle, but...)In terms of bright spots, we ordered two portions of taramasalata, which was actually very tasty. Service was also extremely attentive; our waitress was friendly and very prompt to respond to our needs and requests. The restaurant itself has an intimate feel to it, and was very warm, which I appreciated! The prices were also very, very reasonable.

The fries were just as delicious, the sauce just as creamy, the gyros just as yummy as I remembered it.

My friend and I caught a quick dinner here prior to a holiday play and it was just what I was in the mood for-filling, tasty, and inexpensive. I got the large Greek salad with gyro and pita and it was excellent. The salad is a good size and is full of very fresh lettuce, cucumbers, olives, and tomatoes with a delicious and light olive oil and red wine vinegar dressing. I asked for feta as well and was presented with a legit hunk of cheese doused in olive oil, it was delightful. The gyro here deserves a whole five stars on its own. Perfectly balanced between salty and sweet, crispy and chewy, it is the quintessential gyro and probably the best I have had. The pita here is great too-soft, warm, and served with fantastic tzatziki. I stuffed my pita with salad, gyro, tzatziki, and feta for a flavorful combination. If you have the appetite for them (and who doesn't), don't miss the vinegar soaked fries. Served with pita, lettuce, tomatoes, and gyro, these fries are top notch, but be warned-they are extremely filling. Aside from the fabulous food, the prices at the Athenian Room are unbelievable! Entrees are $10, some even less and the restaurant doesn't serve alcohol so you don't have to worry about that added cost.

The dishes are big enough to share (and we did), and I feel like it's really a great deal for your money. I'm sure we will be back again!"], ["Alexandra K.", "Athenian Room has some of the best Greek food I've ever had.

I would recommend to anyone looking for delicious greek food in Lincoln Park."], ["Brittany H.", "I used to work near Greek town, and I've tried a bunch of the restaurants there. I have my favorites, and I would've never expected a Greek restaurant in Lincoln Park to take the cake. The food was amazing and very affordable, and it has the typical family owned Greek restaurant feel, so you know it's authentic. The gyro platter was delish- the meat was seasoned perfectly & it was a very good portion for the price. The Greek fries are also a must try. A bunch of people had the chicken dinner, which was literally half of a chicken. There's definitely no skimping on the portions at this place. Next time you're craving Greek food, skip Greek town & try Athenian room."], ["Justin B.", "Glad I came by to try this, but not sure I'll be back. \u00a0The gyros at Niko's and Falafel & Grill are so good and so close to my house AND so cheap that even at $7, Athenian Room loses out on the gyro price front. \u00a0The fries weren't as tasty as my other faves, but the space in the restaurant and the staff were solid. \u00a0And the feta cheese was fine but didn't take me back to my time in Athens or in Santorini. \u00a0A-OK, indeed."], ["Myka C.", "whoever helped me out earlier over the phone was rude and unprofessional"], ["Jennifer S.", "We've been going to the Athenian Room for 25 years.

The kalamata chicken and gyros are better than Greek Town. Surprisingly, their burgers are delicious, too. It is family owned, homey and personable. Anna has called us by name and remembered our children's names from the time they were babies in their car seats -- a welcome and unexpected personal touch in a big city. We're never disappointed."], ["Laila C.", "Their chicken is delicious but their owner is a bitch. She yelled at me and I saw her yelling at a couple of other people too.

Pretty much every Sunday night I order a caesar salad with chicken for take out. It's always available right when I walk in to pay and the salad is one of the best I've had. The croutons are absolutely amazing, dunno if they're tossed with garlic, parmesan, or what, but they're superb. The caesar dressing is homemade and it's fantastic, definitely distinguishes itself from most other dressings. But the highlight - the chicken. Whoever thought of taking chicken doner and putting it on a caesar salad was a genius...a mad genius. It's superb. I could eat that chicken forever.I've also had their kebab plates which were very good. Pretty much got the sample platter the first time that had all their meats \u00a0- the chicken, doner, meatball, kebabs, and even salmon. Everything was very good. Sizable portion as well so I took maybe 1/3 of it home. I'd definitely get it again. Some of the doner was pretty greasy, but that's the only complaint and it's a minor one.The bread deserves a mention as well, not entirely sure what the bread is, it's like a pita but stuffed and more fluffy on the inside. It's great and the hummus they have pairs with it perfectly.Highly recommend Zizis"], ["Juieta C.", "Oh hell yeah!! \u00a0That Adana kabab roll is the bomb!! The meat is juicy and succulent.

It reminded me of my mom's rice pudding and really had a good ending to the meal."], ["C.C. H.", "Good hearty bread abounds at Zizi's Cafe, from the pita and spiced carrot-yogurt spread that came first to the cubes of crusty bread lining our Iskender Kebab platter. The storefront on Sheffield is unassuming but the restaurant is actually quite spacious and we were staffed by a kindly young woman who dealt with our indecision with good grace. We eventually got the starter combo platter - an impressive array of textures and flavors - and the Iskender platter which I was a little disappointed by - the lamb and beef was good but not as lively in either flavor or texture as I would have hoped for from something supposedly freshly grilled. I also couldn't taste the contribution of the spicy walnut butter. Nonetheless, this was a nice quiet place with good food to have a late afternoon lunch on Saturday and I would come back to try other items on the menu."], ["Ben A.", "Stopped by for dinner with some friends. Complimentary carrot appetizer and homemade bread. The carrot dish is a cold shaved carrot salad with non-acidic dressing. I couldn't figure out what the carrot dish was but it was great especially when eaten with the bread. I ordered Zizi's kale salad with a side of chicken. The salad was made up of chopped kale, garbanzo beans, pickled beets and portobello mushroom and tossed in a red wine vinaigrette. The salad was fresh and crisp and the chicken had a ton of flavor. My only complaint was the dressing was a tad too acidic for me. Nonetheless I finished the entire salad. My friends ordered a variety of dishes and they all enjoyed their dishes and complimented the taste and flavor. Overall, nice place for casual meal and to catchup with friends. The entire meal took nearly two hours and we never felt rushed. We had about 7 people in our party and even though they couldn't provide individual checks they allowed us to pay individually at the register. It's BYOB, affordable, and steps from Beercade and Diversey Brown Line."], ["Olivia H.", "If you like Mediterranean, Zizi's Cafe is worth visiting for three reasons:1) The food is fresh.2) The restaurant has a relaxed, family-owned business ambience3) They have a BYOB policy! And the owner is sweet enough to put your unopened beers in the cooler while you eat.As far as food highlights go, the complimentary carrot spread and homemade bread is delicious! \"Carrot spread\" sounds strange, but it's essentially grated carrots mixed with a yogurt sauce. SO GOOD. I also loved the red lentil soup - deliciously spiced! I wasn't as impressed with the falafel, but it came with a nice yogurt sauce, so that helped.Everyone here is very friendly, so if you have questions, don't be afraid to ask! They will make sure you have a great time here. :D"], ["Hannah C.", "Really 3.5 stars. We had the Zizi's favorite wrap, which was quite good. Loved the lamb and beef doner.

I thought I was coming for a simple lamb kebab and a bowl of rice. I walk out of here with an addiction and a complex.There were times when I couldn't even take bites, not because I was full but because I just wanted to stare at my food and think about everything it was doing to my life -- I needed answers. Each bite made me feel as if I were flying, riding the lamb kebab around like it was my little unicorn horse and the only thing that could unhorse me was another lamb kebab riding another lamb kebab, armed with a javelin made out of more lamb kebab. The ultimate jousting weapon. But what's this? The kebab plate comes with some kind of magic zucchini saucer? I need to eat this saucer? what if I just rode it to space instead, rode it through the night and maybe fought my other self atop those crazy lamb kebabs, bending time and reality to my rule like the puppet master i was born to be. As tempting as that sounds, just eating the saucer is even better than that. I don't need to fly anywhere unless that other planet is filled with these silly saucer. Maybe the planet could be made out of them, maybe then space travel would be worth the investment. The bread comes out strong and thick, like a clay discus. It's fitting because I often think of myself as an olympic athlete, one specializing in joust. The bread goes well with the rice, the meat, the vegetables, the yogurt sauce...but most of all, the bread goes well with my face. Yeah, that's right. Yogurt sauce covered bread is tasty, but it's even tastier if it goes directly into my face. No questions asked, yet all answers given. I've been up for hours just thinking about it. I don't want to sleep, if I try to sleep I might realize that I was already asleep and that this whole meal was a dream, which would make more sense than it actually being real... \u00a0...all for less than $20."], ["Cem A.", "Currently one of the most authentic Turkish restaurant in Chi town, if not the most.

It's an unassuming, family-run hole in the wall serving up extremely flavorful food that reminds me of d\u00f6ner places I stumbled upon during a short stay in Munich.First off, the complimentary bread has been served warm, fluffy, and pleasantly crunchy on the outside every time. Typically I'm not one to fill up on bread baskets, but Zizi's makes that very hard, it's terrific.Smoked eggplant salad ($7) was indeed very smoky, and the silky texture made it perfect with the bread.Carrot spread ($4.75), which Zizi sometimes serves us on the house, is packed with garlic and yogurt, pretty addictive with the warm bread as well.Lahmajun ($4.50) flatbread was large and filling, with just enough lemon flavor, the ground beef was very strongly seasoned.Lamb adana ($15) was extremely flavorful with a big hit of cumin and pepper flavor. Mild couscous and yogurt are a great choice for the strong flavors of the lamb.Iskender ($16) is one of my favorite plates of food in Chicago, and is really the dish that made Zizi's a 5-star for me. It's heaps of shaved d\u00f6ner sitting on an equally huge amount of their amazing bread, cut up into chunks. The slightly sweet and spicy tomato sauce and yogurt/walnut butter mix on the side are refreshing for the heaviness of the dish. It's enormous, but I finish it every time.On our visits dining in, Zizi and one waitress were pretty much taking care of the entire restaurant. They were working very hard, but when it gets busy, service may not be the most attentive. I'd keep coming back to Zizi's just for the iskender, but the other things I've tried more than merit a visit as well. It's incredibly well priced and tops the places I tried in Munich as well as a lot of d\u00f6ner shops I experienced in Istanbul."], ["Rose M.", "Zizi's is so good! I went for lunch and ordered the Turkish feta salad with chicken. It was a huge salad but I had no problems finishing it. The salad was fresh and light but super filling. I didn't mind paying extra for the chicken because they give you a large amount. I could probably eat the salad every day, to be honest. Dine in if you can, because then you get free homemade bread and the carrot spread. It was so difficult to not eat the entire bread basket by myself because it was SO DANG GOOD. The woman working at the register (I'm assuming Zizi's wife? I don't know) told me they make it twice daily. I've never had anything like the carrot spread and it was also fantastic. I ended up eating it with a fork because I was trying to resist the bread. Spoiler alert: I ate the entire bread basket. Worth it. I left feeling full and energized. I can't wait to bring my friends back here, it's a treasure!"], ["John I.", "I asked the somewhat-reserved Turkish woman who served us which she preferred between a couple dishes. It's always good to get the opinion of someone from the heartland of the cuisine, I always say. She said she liked eggplant; so she would choose the Bosphorus platter: grilled meatballs and eggplant ratatouille baked in the oven with mozzarella on top. Mama would be proud that I ate the ratatouille, given that her ratatouille and her hard-earned, meticulous Julia Child masterpieces were wasted on me when I was young.Turns out that the server was Russian; so her recommendation came from a much different ethnic heritage. More fool me. Nevertheless, the dish was delectable: well-seasoned beef, delicious eggplant, and an un-American amount of cheese--just enough, without turning it into an extra-cheese thin crust pizza. The decor looks a little like a cross between a sandwich/gyro place and a cozy restaurant. I like being able to see the kitchen where they're cooking, but it looks a bit like a take-out counter. The dining room is simple, but nice, and even had small flowers on the tables. We had a dessert of Kazandibi, described as a Turkish flan. It had a white, gelatin consistency and seemed to be broiled or otherwise flamed on the top. It was very tasty, and it actually tasted a bit like s'mores, much to the delight of my tongue. Now I could give proper ethnic advice from the heartland about a good s'more.They took reservations, which was nice, except that the place was only about half-filled on a Saturday night.

Bread: 4/5 -- Solid, warm bread fresh off the oven and served with cool carrot spread. Very addicting!Falafel: 3.5/5 -- Your typical falafel, certainly full of flavor and served with yogurt. Did not find anything too special about this one. Iskender: 3/5 -- Now this is where I left disappointed. I love meat (I can eat pork/beef straight up for hours at Korean BBQ's), but I found this dish very underwhelming. The flavors from the tomato sauce unsatisfying. Personally didn't find the d\u00f6ner and the underlying bread to go together too well and was disappointed that the peppers and the walnut better were not a larger part of the meal. Baklava: 3.5/5 -- Zizi's Cafe did a decent job with this famous dessert; it was crispy, warm, rich, and had a good balance of honey and nuts. I liked the owner, but I found the service very inattentive. It was hilarious how the owner mockingly looked down on my friend when she ordered a chicken kebab (too typical and ordinary for the owner, I guess)."], ["YY W.", "Ordered a Pizmahmagun Wrap with chicken. Really tasty, better than your average chicken shawarma or mediterranean wrap. Lots of flavor and extremely juicy, at the same time not super greasy and drenched in miscellaneous white sauce.

They were oh so sure that their Doner would be better! At some point i even gave up due to all the BS i have tasted! So a few days ago i have had a craving for a Doner but didn't want to be disappointed and pissed off (FYI i take my food very seriously) and didn't know where i should turn! I use to just Google \"German Style Doner\" and would call those places but this time i used this head of mine and used Yelp (which I should have done a long time ago). So my search for Doner \"Zizi's Cafe\" came up. I took a peek at the pictures and almost had a heart attack. I thought i was going into cardiac arrest but i caught myself before!I called the restaurant and asked him not to BS me and that i will be very pissed if i showed up and this Doner was not what i was asking for. He assured me and said \"If its not like the one in Germany; your meal if free. So i showed up and man was i surprised. They were real Turkish (as in it was 100% Turkish owned and ran). They knew exactly what i was looking for. Come to find out Zizi speaks German and i think he use to live in Germany.My Doner came up ASAP! Wait was less than 10 minutes, Now when it comes to a Doner its all about the bread and the sauce. ZIZZI GOT IT RIGHT!! He came through with his promise and served me my Doner the way i LOVE IT. It was perfect and i was VERY VERY VERY PLEASED. This place is a definitely must go for some great Turkish food and more! His food really took me back to Germany and reminded me of all the good times i have had as a kid.Zizzi came and checked on me a few times and made sure that i was pleased with my food.

Maybe I'm just biased, having recently come back from Istanbul and Cappadocia where I had some very delicious and very mediocre Turkish food. I've found--as a lover of sauce--I prefer cuisines of other coasts along the Aegean and Mediterranean. In Istanbul especially, I found the food fairly dry.I have the same complaint about Zizi's, so maybe that's on me. But dry doesn't have to be a bad thing, if the food is also tasty. We got the hummus, along with a complimentary chopped carrot appetizer, to start. The hummus was fine, not anything special. I got the beef-lamb doner kebab, while the wife picked the chicken wrap. The sandwich was moderately flavorful and fairly dry, with a relatively tasteless tzatziki to complement. I did really like the bread in silo. The sandwich bread is the same as the complimentary basket, which worked well with the dip but less so with dry meat.Atmosphere was a little sterile, and service came with the brusque Turkish style.

Zizi deboned the fish at the table with a knife and fork rather expertly. Ha! Z made sure to take out some of the better bits for me insisting I try. The fish was very good and flavorful; my partner said it was some of the best he's had for a while. He also enjoyed the salad which was by his admission simple, but had great dressing.I had the chicken shish platter with cous cous. For some reason it was plated with a portion of cous cous, some white long grain rice, a couple of grilled zucchini slices, three small toast disks, and yogurt sauce. The grilled chicken was good but as Zizi said himself to my companion \"it's grilled chicken.\" then they both shrugged. The yogurt sauce was great, very fresh and not overly seasoned. The cous cous and rice were a disappointment. I really like more inventive and playful cous cous recipes. As a surprise Z brought dessert. Like the whole Sea Bass I don't believe it's on the menu. It was a generous piece of custard pie that was rich in texture but delicately flavored of vanilla. Very similar to a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and served with fresh strawberries.

The chicken was slightly dry but seasoned nicely. The rice while flavorful, really was more fitting for dinner than for lunch. The salad is nice and the hummus is about average from what I would expect. The pita that comes with the meal is nice and chewy with an interesting taste. However, the falafel is awesome. It is super flavorful and well spiced. They are fried to a perfect brown and crumble nicely when bitten into. After my first visit, I now frequently order the falafel plate which comes with a bed of lettuce with falafel, Jerusalem salad, pita, and hummus. I top the falafel off with some nice tahnini sauce and some housemade spicy sauce (quite heavenly).Overall, I really like this place.

You mean, I can have all the wonderful flavors of a gyro all packaged in a somewhat healthy format?! I didn't need much more convincing that a healthy portion of gyro meat nestled on top of a bed of greens to partake in a delicious lunch offering from the meager selections in the loop.I ordered the salad for pickup on Grubhub as Taza is only about four blocks away from my office. When I walked in they were just starting to assemble the salad, so I was able to watch how it was made and they asked me questions about some of the items that I may or may not want, which was nice. I only had to wait about 1-2 minutes for the salad to be completed, and they were incredibly friendly during this quick interaction.Upon getting back to my office, I eagerly dug into the salad. One has the option of tzatziki sauce or their signature dressing, and I opted for the traditional tzatziki. The sauce was homemade and delicious--there were large chunks of cucumbers and plenty of dill. This made for a scrumptious and traditional pairing for the gyro meat. As for the meat, it was a bit more thick cut than what I'm used to seeing on sandwiches, but I won't hold that against them. The meat was well seasoned and flavorful, so no complaints here. I do feel that their salad bowl itself deserves an honorable mention--the romaine was incredibly fresh (even after a 10 minute walk under piping hot gyro meat) and had a great crunch to it. There were other fresh veggies mixed in as well, ranging from peperocinis to green peppers, with a few olives and tomatoes thrown in. Also, you get four HUGE chunks of feta cheese as well, and this was some of the most flavorful and high quality cheese that I've seen at a quick lunch spot downtown.

I got married and would take my children there after a day at the beach. One very unhappy day they were just gone. George has retired and John returned to Greece. At long last Dino has opened his own place and using the original recipes from his Dad has brought this gem back to life. They actually make their own gyros. This is not the gyros meat that you get at all the other gyros places. This is authentic and tastes great. Their greek potatoes, saganaki, and greek sausage are great too.

I assumed after a minute in the work microwave I would be delighted in my lunch but that was not the case. The fries were all clumped together and had no flavor and the gyro was also totally flavorless. The lamb was almost spongy which is not a word I like to use to describe meat. Thankfully they included silverware which I had also asked them not to do but it did include a salt packet which I emptied between my sandwich and the fries to salvage my $10 plate of food. The various dips were good which is why I gave them 2 stars instead of 1.In the end, I think the only person who enjoyed the food was my dog who got a good helping of the spongy gyro meat."], ["Ashley B.", "I first discovered this restaurant about 9 months ago and I've eaten here on a weekly basis since then (primarily takeout). They make one of the best gyros I've ever eaten. Always fresh, seasoned to perfection and great portion sizes.

Lots of fresh tomatoes on the side.Chicken souvlaki plate - huge pieces of juicy chicken breast which were extremely flavorful. Comes with some grilled onions and tomatoes.Sides - Dino's potatoes, green beans braised in olive oil, grilled veggies, and rice. We were fighting over the potatoes--they were that good. Kind of like vesuvio potatoes, but even better. The green beans melted in my mouth. The grilled veggies and rice were pretty standard, but fine.We had a ton of food, enough for two full lunches the next day. All plates come with two sides and are only $11. It's a lot of food for not a lot of money.Service was great, and the owner brought over complimentary shots of Ouzo after our meal.With its name, this place sounds like it could be a fast-food establishment, but I assure you it's not.

He was really attentive when it came to making sure we felt at home. The bartender was fun and funny, which is important when you're behind a bar. For starters, a bottle of wine and some Ouzo shots. We had no clue what kind of wine they have on the menu because it gave the brand name, not the wine type. We told our server what we were looking for and he nailed it. They also have a pretty decent craft beer selection which surprised me. On to the food. We started with a Greek salad, it was a very typical Greek salad (feta, tomatoes, kalamata olives, cucumbers, etc), but I like Greek salads so I enjoyed it. \u00a0The Gyros are simply amazing, perfectly cooked, and perfectly seasoned. The Gyro plate dinner is HUGE. Tons of succulent gyro meat, a grilled pita, two sides (I recommend Dino's potatoes and grilled veggies). The tazaki sauce is AMAZING and I don't even like tazaki sauce, not kidding! I almost couldn't get enough of it. For dessert we had baklava (and more Ouzo) and it was the perfect way to end our meal.

The old place was dark and seemed old. While I really liked feel of the old place, the new version is light and modern and very nice.So why does this place take me back? Well aside from seeing the pictures of the old place, the gyros sandwich tastes exactly as I remember it. Even if you are not in it for the nostalgia, I recommend giving this place a try.

We've been wanting to go for awhile and since the weather was in the 50s, we decided to walk there with our little one. Great location and looks like they have parking too. Additionally they have an outdoor area that we will for sure try out when it gets warmer. Now on to the food and service! We came on a Sunday at about 1 pm and there were people there, but it wasn't packed. They greeted and seated us promptly, accommodating our stroller as well (which was very nice). Our server was kind and knowledgeable - she walked us through the menu and explained the drink specials. The drink specials were good, but we weren't in the mood to drink so we passed. We both decided to get something simple, the gyro sandwich. Hubby got normal fries and I got greek fries (+$1 for feta, oregano and vinegar of some sort). I will definitely be getting the greek fries again, but make sure you like oregano before you venture to these beauties. The gyro was insanely flavorful and complete perfection. Just the right amount of their tzatziki sauce which is clearly made fresh in house daily. That sauce combined with the meat made the best gyro I've ever had. Service was consistently good throughout our stay and even other workers came over to see our daughter which made us feel very warm and welcomed!

This place could use some comfortable seating and mood lighting."], ["John K.", "After a recent conversation lamenting the lack of 'authentic' gyros in America, a friend told me to check this place out, as it is family owned and not a chain, and the owners prepare the daily gyros spit, same as in Greece. \u00a0I admit, i was so pumped to have a taste of home that i showed up giddy.They weren't particularly busy so we were promptly seated, and allowed to move to an adjoining table when we got a little chilly from the direct AC flow. Our server was quite pleasant.I saw a number of nostalgic items on the menu i'll go back and try, but my friend and i both tried the 'basic' gyros sandwich that makes or breaks any 'souvlatzidiko' in my book. \u00a0We also tried the saganaki cause my friend is addicted and i'll admit it was among, if not the best i have ever had. \u00a0Crispy on the outside, perfectly gooey on the inside, and with a lemon brandy caress in every bite. This saganaki has not known rubberyness in its existence, and i would go back to order that alone.I didn't expect it to be a sit-down restaurant, but was delighted by the napkin-wrapped silverware and high-quality olive oil available for dipping when they bring you bread.While the gyros is unarguably better than ANY gyros i've ever had in the states, it doesn't come close to what i was expecting. Perhaps leaning a little towards the over-spiced, \u00a0if you're going to have gyros it should absolutely be here rather than anywhere else. The sandwich was stuffed with it, and the traditional tomatoes/onions/tzatziki sauce garnish was pleasant enough. \u00a0I personally found the tzatziki to be on the thin side, and not as punchy as it should be. But remember these are the comments of someone who looks forward to pigging out on gyros in Greece more or less yearly, and came here expecting to find the same damn stuff you find in Greece.My friend loved everything. \u00a0We both loved the sides and beer.So, even though i was a little disappointed, this isn't greece after all and i still give these guys a 5 star review for great portions of delicious food at the price point.I'll definitely spread the word."], ["Jaime E.", "So good!

The service is unbeatable across the board! They also make stellar cocktails (a'hem, at 11am) with a relevant and affordable beer selection.

This place allows you to get a sandwich, salad or a plate. What I like about this place is all of the options you can pick to choose with your meal. I decided to get my gyro as a salad. The guy grabbed romaine and I asked him for some spinach too. He looked at me like I wasn't suppose to do that but he didn't say no. I then had them add tomatoes, olives, red onion, spicy feta & cucumbers. The menu board was a little confusing. I asked the guy what else I could get on the salad and he pointed at the board and said anything. I then said how about some hummus and he told me that would be an extra charge. That is where my confusion was. I told the guy not to worry about it and skipped that option. I got the Greek Vinaigrette as a dressing. Then I saw the words spicy tahini and asked for a side of that. I love spicy. I was not a fan of the vinaigrette because it was a little bland. Instead I used the spicy tahini as a light dressing. It was amazing. There was also a pita on the side but I didn't eat that because I was trying to eat light and skip the carbs. I really liked this place. I loved having all of the fresh options and customization when making your food. I do wish the board was a little more descriptive. I was confused just looking up at the menu and the staff really did not take any time to explain it to me. They kind of stared at us and kept talking to each other. I kind of wished they would have asked if we needed help or walked us through the menu. Besides the lack of customer service the food was delicious and fresh. \u00a0I will come back and next time I should be a pro at picking my food items off the menu.

It was the first impression that I was given of this beautiful city. Every bite that I took was so incredibly delicious that as I write this review, I'm not sorry to say that I'm kind of drooling... I realized that tapas seem to be a big trend in Chicago. This restaurant offers a large menu filled with delicious mediterranean tapas. My favorites were the spanish octopus terrine, braised pork shoulder, pig's ear and eggplant with goat cheese spread. I suggest you get around 3-4 dishes for 2 people. I went with a larger group, so we were able to try more dishes. The dishes are relatively small, so if you can eat a lot, GET MORE!I will definitely be back here next time, but I'll look into making reservations because as a hot spot, the wait can get a little long."], ["Aaron P.", "This place is super hyped up not just by my friends but from people I don't know who I meet in other cities like New Orleans who visit and tell me to go here. I think it fell a little short of expectations. The menu is absolutely daunting. There are so many choices of things to order. I'll be planning ahead next time I can get in here. Both wines we ordered were fantastic, the Cabernet-Merlot blend from France and the pinot grigio from Greece. In hindsight, the white wine didn't pair well with any of the food we ordered so again better planning on our part would have made sense.Let's go through the list of things we ordered:Greek Cornbread- I'd pass on this one. This was a crumbly version of cornbread with honey and goat cheese. It sounded really good but was just mediocre in my opinion. Also, it's a pretty small portion even for $6.Duck Neck Rillete- This was good. I enjoyed both the duck meat and the jam spread it came with on the fresh, warm bread. But I probably would skip this to try the pork pate next time.Olive Oil Poached Tuna- Apparently my brother got all the tuna in this dish. I was only able to get one bite. As a salad, this was excellent. But the portion size is crazy small for the paltry amount of tuna in here.Crispy Pigs Ear- I enjoyed this but the ear just tastes like fried not much like pig. I appreciated the kale and peppers, but I'd probably go for the pork jowl instead if I did this again which also comes with a duck egg.Bone Marrow- I liked this one a lot. The bone marrow came with a heaping of ultra fresh parsley and capers. Lamb Ribs- These were delicious. I forget what was in the little salad underneath each of the ribs it included some pomegranate seeds and greens. Milik Braised Pork Shoulder- Really good, rich pork flavor. \u00a0 Panino con Nutella- Not bad. I don't have much to say about this one. I preferred the brioche doughnut.Sicilian Iris- This was awesome! Essentially a brioche doughnut filled with ricotta and chocolate. I devoured it.This place has a great staff. They were very attentive. Again, I wish I came in here with a better game plan because of how large this menu is and because the wine needs to be paired with what you're ordering. Rookie mistakes on my part."], ["Sana S.", "YASSSSSS! Finally a place that is wonderful all around, great food, drinks, customer service, location, and ambiance! We ordered a few small plates so we could try a few different things and everything was outstanding. Tuna with quail eggs and roasted bone marrow are the reasons why I'm giving this place 5 stars (oh and the wine too, can't forget the wine). You MUST get the bone marrow, I don't care how unadventurous and basic your palate is, just TRY it! You will love it. So tasty and perfectly flavored without trying too hard. This place just lets the natural flavors of the food take over and I love that. Get some wine and cheese spreads if you want something lighter and are just there to hang for a few. Those are great as well. Just try it and be adventurous, and if you're a non pork eater like myself, don't worry there are plenty of other options here."], ["Celine L.", "Came here as we were passing by after dinner and decided to eat some more because we've heard so many good things about this place! Since this was our second dinner, we only ordered appetizers and drinks to share at the bar (we did not want to wait for a table). We originally decided to stop by as we wanted the pig ear but they ran out for the night, so we tried a couple other dishes. Roasted Bone Marrow with Herb Salad & Sicilian Sea Salt- The bone was MASSIVE. It was twice the size of the ones we get in LA, an it was a beautiful sight. There was so much marrow, and with the salt and the greens, it was delicious! I basically finished the whole thing by myself...Octopus with Green Beans, Fingerling Potatoes & Salsa Verde- The octopus was crisp on the outside but super soft and tender on the inside. Great pairing with the beans and potatoes, and it was the perfect amount for the two of us. The bartender, Mark, who served us was very sociable and friendly, and I actually found out that we were from the same hometown (Whittier, California) and went to the same college!

(3.75/5)A La Plancha: Seafood Saganaki (Shrimp, mussels, sepia, grouper, tomato & feta - $20): I was overwhelmed by the sourness from the sauce. Would I get it again? NO. (2.5/5)Dessert: Sicilian Iris (Ricotta & chocolate chip filled fried brioche, $7): For some reason, the kitchen took a long time to prepare this dessert (we waited over 15+ minutes). Good crispy brioche with warm chocolate chip filling. Would I get it again? YES, BUT THE WAIT WAS TOO LONG. (4.25/5)***Personally, I think the Purple Pig is slightly over-hyped and you might get some hits and misses here. I personally prefer food at Girl & the Goat over the Purple Pig."], ["May C.", "Wow, this place is fantastic! I had high hopes after reading the reviews on yelp. My boyfriend and I arrived 10 minutes after it opened and the place was already packed! A full restaurant in just 10 minutes. Luckily, we were the first ones on the wait list. The restaurant has a lot of seating, but it's not so much individual tables. They have long tables that seat multiple parties together. It felt a bit crowded. The servers didn't have enough room to put food on the table. You had to lean to the side so they had room to put food on the table.Service was okay, nothing too exceptional. I know our waitress tried her best to check up on us as much as possible. But she seemed very overwhelmed.The food however was really what made this place 5 stars. My boyfriend and I shared the JTL Pork Jowl, Milk Braised Pork Shoulder and the Sicilian Iris dessert. The pork shoulder was my favorite of the three. It's a very deceiving dish. It looks very small, but it'll fill you up very quickly. The pork jowl was delicious as well and the sicilian iris was the bomb. The chocolate chip and ricotta filling was good, but when you mix it with the brioche bun, it was phenomenal. The bread was warm and fluffy but it also had a bit of crunch to it which was nice.Overall, had a great time here. If you can get here right when it opens, I'd recommend it. The wait can be very long and during peak hours, it can get very tight."], ["Tracy H.", "Went with my fianc\u00e9 and sister who was visiting from DC. We shared a variety of plates and left absolutely raving about our meal and service. We shared the calamari, stuffed fried olives, fried manchego cheese, milk-braised pork, meatballs and chocolate caramel cake dessert. Everything was AMAZING. The calamari salad? I could eat that all day/every day. So tender but very nuanced. Lots of flavors going on. The pork? Falling apart tender and delicious. This place was such a hit. We were all totally full when we left, and the total bill was about $60 for three people (no drinks). Not bad! Quite honestly one of the best meals I've had in ages, and that's high praise."], ["Ali W.", "I came here for lunch and had a pretty good meal. \u00a0Here are what I ordered and liked:* Pork Jowl, Tomato, Frisee, Pesto Aioli, and Duck Confit* Roasted Bone Marrow with Herb Salad and Sicilian Sea Salt* Pig's Ear with Crispy Kale, Pickled Cherry Peppers, and Fried EggI suggest getting there right around opening time, as the place fills up pretty quickly.1 star off: Everything is very greasy. \u00a0There is at least one fried or fatty item in each dish. \u00a0If you want to be skinny, this is not the place to be."], ["Brenda L.", "The purple pig is a fun and creative restaurant with very inventive dishes.Came here at lunch and got seated right away. So happy we did not have to wait long like other yelpers did. Tried and true: we had the squid stuffed with breadcrumbs and prosciutto. YUM! Very tasty and interesting flavours! though I did find it a bit over salted. \u00a0A pretty presentation of the dish. The milk braised pork shoulder. Comforting dish with tender meat. The gravy and mashed potatoes complemented well. The pork neck ricotta dip/ spread. Came with 6 slices of toasted bread. A very delicious appetizer. The pork neck and melted cheese with the tomato sauce was to die for! This was quite a filling dish. The purple pig is tapa/small dishes style and surprisingly 3 dishes was enough for us two. So many dishes still to try! Will definitely have to come back next time I'm in the Windy City."], ["Colleen M.", "My friends and I waited about 45 minutes - 1 hour for dinner on a Saturday night - totally fine by us, as we got to walk around for a bit on a cool end of summer evening. It was around 6pm, and we knew that there would be a wait, so no worries. If anything, we were surprised that we were seated so soon for a party of 4. The party that had just been seated at the table - communal seating - were pretty rude and kept asking the host \"We have shitty seats, why can't we sit there and they take these seats,\" because they were closer to the door. They eventually just moved seats altogether (thank god), but I really felt for the host. We ordered:Roasted bone marrowPig's Ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers & fried eggMilk braised pork shoulder with mashed potatoesStuffed squidSeafood saganaki\"Birthday Dessert\" (We literally asked what we could get with a candle in it) which were fresh donuts drizzled with honeyOverall... We were pretty underwhelmed. While well plated and beautiful, Greektown just does it better.The must get?-The Pig's ear - I would eat that on my own again and again and again.-Stuffed squid - You really can't go wrong....As for the bone marrow, I don't know about you, but you can get bone marrow at this quality pretty much anywhere these days. It's a fun group plate, though.Don't get...The milk braised pork shoulder. It's tender and delicious, but it is pork shoulder and mashed potatoes the size of your fist. Try something else, really.THE SEAFOOD SAGANAKI was so disappointing. It was like eating a bowl of seafood marinara ahhh."], ["Gina G.", "This spot is right off Michigan Ave, so naturally it brings a lot of traffic whether people are coming in on a whim or have it as a must go to spot while visiting. Since they don't take reservations, I imagine it to be busy whether you come for lunch or dinner. They take your name and number down and call you once a table is ready. This allows you to walk around the nearby shops if you don't want to wait. Our wait was estimated to be 45ish minutes, so my bf and I decided to grab a drink from the bar and wait indoors. If you're lucky, the bar area is first come first serve.The place was packed around 2 PM, so I kind of felt like I was in the way just standing around waiting around the bar area but the workers were all friendly and accommodating. They have an extensive wine, cocktail and beer list to enjoy while you wait or with your meal. Our table was ready a little sooner than expected and luckily sat at our own table rather than the communal tables.Based on some of the recommendations here, I ordered the bone marrow spread, crispy pig ear and pork shoulder...meats galore! The bone marrow came with bread to spread it on, herb salad to toss on top and sea salt...this was new to me but it was very flavorful.Crispy pig ear- doesn't sound appetizing, but trust it is a must try! It's fried pig ear mixed with crispy kale, and some sweet peppers with a sunny side egg on top which is meant to be cracked and mixed in with everything. It was delicious and I loved the texture!Braised pork shoulder-came with mashed potatoes and the meat was super tender. Some people say its too salty, but our order tasted just fine. This was probably our favorite of the 3It is a little on the pricier side for only tapas, but it was great trying those 3 that seem to be some of the most popular dishes. The service was quick, a little rushed since they want to get through the wait list as fast as possible it seems like. Also, the food didn't all come out at once which wasn't that big of a deal but sometimes there's waits in between until the next one was ready."], ["Dana Y.", "Two hour wait on a Saturday night - I guess it's reasonable seeing how popular the place is. We put our name down and headed back to our hotel and waited for a call. Luckily, they call people because I was not about to stand in that cold. The place was very nice. Actually, I didn't get to see the inside, only took a peek when I put my name down. We were seated in the outer patio area which had heat blazing from the top. The heat felt sooo good! We ordered four things - the fried pig ears with sweet peppers and kale, milk braised pork shoulder, seafood saganaki, and squid stuffed prosciutto. 1. The pig ears did not disappoint. I loved the kale and sweet peppers, it was a great combination with the fried pig ears. It was a great starter, get our taste buds going. 2. The pork shoulder was way too salty. We didn't eat much of that. But the mashed potatoes was amazing. It worked well with the salty pork but when the mashed potatoes ran out, we stopped eating the pork shoulder itself.3. Seafood saganaki wasn't too great either. Although I loved the mussels and shrimps, the sauce was too salty and heavy. If they'd lighten up the sauce and let the seafood taste come out, I think it would've been a better dish.4. Squid stuffed prosciutto was amazing. I'm not the biggest squid person but I wanted to try it. The sauce was amazing and the squid was cooked perfectly so it was chewy. I enjoyed my experience! I definitely want to return to try the other things that they offer. Apparently the menu changes at least twice a day, everyday, so I'd love to see what else they offer."], ["Brenda C.", "While strolling around Chicago after the architecture tour, we happened to walk right past this place as they opened. Luckily, we were able to land a communal table without waiting. ( Perks of sitting at communal table is you get to ask your neighbors what they would recommend )Of course, everything on the menu looked and sounded delish but the two items that really changed my life are - The Fried Pig Ears and the waygu beef in bone marrow is the best pig ears and waygu beef I've ever had !"], ["Juan F.", "Probably my favorite food spot that we tried in Chicago was The Purple Pig. My friend recommended this place and the reviews were great so we had to pay a visit. Everything was we tried was outstanding and delicious. Service was also impeccable. Chorizo Stuffed Olives: Never had fried olives before. They stuffed it with chorizo so it was a nice spice to it. The yogurt sauce underneath was pretty tasty.Roasted Bone Marrow with herb salad & sicilian sea salt: No joke, probably the biggest bone marrow dish I have been served. It was humongous! I am not complaining but damn I was surprised. The marrow was really good. if you haven't had bone marrow in the past, give it a try. The best way to describe this dish is meat butter. The herb salad was nice and light which went nice with the rich and fatty marrow. Add some sea salt for additional flavor and texture. The toasted bread was nice as well. Pig's Ear with crispy kale, pickled cherry peppers & fried egg: My GF and I loved this dish. I could eat those pig ears every day for the rest of my life! The crispy kale was also very good. The pickled cherry peppers give it a nice acidic and spicy kick and that amazing egg yolk just coated everything to make the dish rich, creamy, flavorful, spicy, crispy and acidic. SO GOOD.Octopus with green beans, fingerling potatoes & salsa verde: The most tender octopus I've had. Seriously!!! Now I keep like I've been ripped off at other restaurants when they claimed their octopus was tender. The salsa verde was a bit oily but it went well with the green beans and potatoes.Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with mashed potatoes: Super tender pork shoulder with mashed potatoes. Literally - it was fork tender. You can't go wrong with this dish.Amazing meal. The only con is that they don't do reservations. We got here 15 min before they opened and there was already a line. The restaurant had a 1 hr wait by the time we left. Crazy good. Well worth it."], ["James T.", "LOVE this place! One of the few Chicago eateries I tried that I knew I would be recommending to friends and family who come to visit.The Purple Pig is a very happening foodie hub, set in an intimate dining layout. You share food in a tapas/small plate style, so come with a few friends and prepare for foodgasms and endless flowing wine (that you can all chip in for). Make sure to come early and grab your seats, since there are no reservations! We waited 45 minutes before they opened up a table. You'll probably be sharing a table so if you're not a conversationalist .. position yourself elsewhere.What's good for grub? I'd recommend whatever the waiter/waitress tells you is their special for the day. Oh and don't forget about the bone marrow, pig ear, and whatever wine you want to pair with. YUM? OH YEAH. Definite YUM."], ["Norah C.", "My mouth is watering as I write this review.Located across from the Chicago Tribune building on N. Michigan Ave, this place is a perfect lunch or dinner spot for \"small plates.\" I put small plates in quotations, because these small plates you can actually share and be STUFFED!If you can, make a reservation - not sure if they take them though. It is DEFINITELY worth the wait. You can put your name down and walk around and they will text/call you when your table is ready. They indoor and outdoor seating - if it's nice out you can see the river. Staff was very friendly and informative. I even got to practice my Spanish with the busboys. It's recommended to get some of the meat and cheese plates, but we decided to splurge and get the bigger items. Everything we had was nothing short of amazing.My friends and I got:Charred Cauliflower w/ toasted breadcrumbs, cornichons & parsleyOlive oil poached tuna with quail eggMilk braised pork shoulderBone marrow Everything was absolutely delicious and we could barely finish everything. This place is to DIE for. A MUST for a foodie visiting Chicago."], ["Lucas B.", "My girlfriend and I came here on our trip to Chicago at the end of August! We hadn't really done any of our normal food researching before coming here just because we were staying with her sister who knows pretty much everything about Chicago anyway so we knew we'd be in good hands.Her sister recommended this place to us after we passed it on Michigan Ave one day and said it was great. We had the choice of either getting deep dish or Purple Pig ... thank God we didn't go for the pizza. I would hate myself if I knew what I was missing out on here.We got to the restaurant around 11:30ish on a Saturday so it was relatively busy. It was only the two of us so we were able to squeeze in at the end of the bar. Best. Seats. Ever. We were RIGHT next to the action. All of the grilling, braising, pickling, plating was right in front of us! We got to see every plate go out while we were there and man that kitchen was ROLLING out food. I definitely recommend trying to get the end of the bar seats (there are 4) if you're not looking for any super intimate 1 on 1 time with your food partner.On to the food:3/5 - Fried manchego cheese with membrillo - the membrillo tasted like a sweeter version of ketchup. Would have rather had a spicy sauce or jelly. Cheese was good!3.5/5 - Octopus with green beans, potatoes, salsa verde - I'd have to say the star(s) of this dish were the green beans and potatoes. Fantastic. Not enough char on the octopus for my liking!4/5 - Pig's ear with kale and an egg - What everyone sees when they look this place up. this dish didn't disappoint! Once you cut it all up and mix it together it's got soooo much flavor. Lots of acid from the cherry peppers but I loved it.5/5 - BROCCOLI - i don't even LIKE broccoli. This was the surprise of the day. Served with breadcrumbs and an Anchovy Vinaigrette. Best vegetable I've ever had probably.5/5 - Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes. This dish hit all my personal buttons. Gravy was spot ON. Potatoes so smooth. The pork fell apart from itself with just a fork. This is a must get.4.5/5 - Sicilian Iris - Ricotta & Chocolate Chip Filled Fried Brioche - I'm usually not a fan of super rich desserts but this one hit the spot for me. Brioche filled with chocolate and ricotta, split open and it runs out. This is a meal where I really had fun from start to finish. The food was great, the service good and quick, and the seats we had just topped it all off. If you've got a little time to wait and are looking for a great meal, this is your place!"], ["Ang S.", "Maybe Chicago is not for me. This is the third restaurant I went to over the weekend that ran out of their signature dish that I've been dying to try. How could you run out of Milk pork shoulder when it's only 4:30pm on a Labor Day weekend? :( At least there was no wait, so I don't feel utterly disappointed. The fried pig ears were truly delightful as many had expressed. Crispy kale and pickled pepper added perfect balance to those unimaginable ears. The octopus with green beans was a solid dish as well. Very flavorful but I wish they weren't drenched in as much oil. And lastly, to my dismay, the turkey leg was suggested in place of our order of the pork shoulder. Surprisingly, this giant piece of leg was so tender and moist that the meat fell off the bone with only a slight touch. As much I'd normally not like turkey, it was delicious!Now on to the service, which was what chewed off a star that should belong to this review. Our waitress was nice and tentative. As we get close to finishing our meal, there were at least 4 different people trying to clean our plates while there were clearly food remaining. Our dessert menu mysteriously landed on our table before we even finished our main course. And so did the check before we got to the last few bites of the butter pecan soft serve ( The ice cream was delicious in case you want to know). I guess there was a line forming and they needed to turn the tables quickly to take advantage of the business. Guess what, there are other ways of making a restaurant more efficient than making your guests feel unwelcomed."], ["Tiffany T.", "Minus one star because this place is tight and loud; def not a romantic place to take your partner on a nice date. Service was okay; great at explaining the menu but not very attentive; the bussers were more attentive. First we started off with the brussels sprouts; nice crisp and perfectly seasoned. Bone Marrow came out second; DELICIOUS!! Everything perfectly goes together; spread the bone marrow on the bread add some salad topped with salt and waaala! After that the pig ears came out and it was also good I loved everything about it except the peppers; personally I felt the flavors were perfect the peppers added a \"surprise\" taste that I can do without. But definitely a good dish after leaving the restaurant I wanted more of this! Last and least of my favorite was the stuffed squid. Yuck one bite was enough. Affogato for dessert and I was done! Some dishes were good but I don't think I'll be back when there's so much other places to try."], ["Ana M.", "This place is very casual with delicious unique food and great service... Ive tasted many different types of food this is a place I will come back to when visiting Chicago Our server was very friendly and helpful when it came to deciding what to order .. Tried ten different things and they all tasted delicious but my fav fav was the bone marrow"], ["Katie L.", "I wanted to rate this place four stars, but not only did I never go back, I never really had a desire to. So while I was very enthusiastic about my one time here, and would recommend it to someone interested in it, I'm just not sure it deserves four.Except....Well, the Purple Pig was where I first discovered that bone marrow, delicious fatty meat jelly, is an institution. The Purple Pig's bone marrow set me up to be disappointed with other bone marrow, too -- there were big pieces of textured salt, and it came with greens to put on top of the marrow and salt and your crispy crusty bread, and overall it was just done so well. I've tried to replicate their bone marrow many times, with varying levels of success, and bone marrow at other restaurants has paled in comparison. A recipe that I take away with me is worth four stars for sure.Otherwise, the theme of the restaurant was to some extent it's downfall, and the reason I did not return. After a full dinner of pork tapas, I felt gross, like a ball of fat. Everything was wonderful and creative and yum, but I wanted more variety.So yeah -- I'm penalizing them a star for their core theme, their core value. I think that there are ways to do the pig that don't feel like Too Much. But I would totally go here once, do it up right, order lots of things, and enjoy."], ["Neal C.", "Yeah, this place is awesome. But man, be prepared to wait, and pay a lot for smallish portions.That said, the quality of the food is totally worth it. Especially the lamb ribs, brussel sprouts, and seafood saganaki. Really fresh ingredients, super tasty, and artfully presented.One disappointment to me was the quail eggs and the smoked trout dip. The portions were extra small, prices $8-12, but the taste just wasn't overwhelming.The interior is very intimate with a few communal tables thrown in. Since most people tend to linger for a few hours, the wait times really pile up after 7. If you get there before that, wait times aren't too bad."], ["Livia G.", "OMG the foods here are bombs!I've been always wanted to try this place. I heard so many good things about this famous purple pig that made me want to experience it my own. It was pouring a little and chilly outside, so we decided to go early before dinner time to avoid the waiting time and.. rain. I was a little disappointed to see what a crowd the restaurant has during normal hours cause it means another waiting time for us. Well, thank God we directly got seated. We were so pumped!Alright here we are flipping over menu confusing ourselves what to get. After looking some photos references on yelp, we finally decided to go with pork shoulder with milk mashed potatoes and pig's ear with crispy kale. Oh and not forgetting one thing. You know what they say.. always save room for a dessert! We ordered sicilian iris for closing.Finally the time we waited has come, the waiter brought in our ordered and I fell in love already with the pork shoulder. It looks so good and amazingly it tasted better than its look. The pork was so soft and juicy while the mashed potato itself was just a perfect fit. Then the first bite of the crispy pig ear was just delicious! The crispy kale though, my fave! I never thought kale could taste as good as it is. It's definitely a must try menu! The last but not least.. the sicilian iris was a 9/10. It was a little bit too sweet for my preference, but overall it was just perfect. The moist brioche sugar powdered on top and the chocolate chip filling.. Do I really need to get in details? Nahh.. You got the picture. Yumm!!We'll definitely be back here, it's worth the trip!!"], ["Kevin Z.", "I can definitely see why this place attracts so many people. \u00a0It's located next to Millennium Mile shopping street so expect to see a lot of tourists. \u00a0We were here around Noon on a Sunday and was able to be seated right away. \u00a0Alright so here is the damage:1. Bone Marrow: they give a pretty good portion of bone marrow and you smear it over bread, season with salt and top it off greens and BOOM! It's magic in yo mouth 2. Calamari (antipasti): I was expecting something fried but it wasn't. \u00a0Not my favorite. \u00a0It's okay.3. Pig Ears: sounds adventurous but they are fried so you can't really taste them per say? \u00a0They cook it with a crisp kale salad and man it was good!4. Pork Shoulders - Get it period! They injected something into the sauce! It's not even fair to talk about it. \u00a0Just get it! 5. Seafood sakanagi - Again these weren't my favorite. They are okay. \u00a0It is served with their own italian-esque sauce over the muscles and couple shrimps.The staffs were super attentive. \u00a0Friendly and helpful with the menu. \u00a0Keep in mind this place is a tad in the higher cost than what I usually pay for these small tapas in the same quality. \u00a0They are unique I'd say though."], ["Liz K.", "More than 3,000 reviews averaging in a 4-star restaurant has to mean something, right?Get here early and plan to be sharing your space with others from start to finish. They do communal tables and the private tables that are \"separate\" are in actuality very close to the others - per the Chicago norm. It's cool to see how bustling the inside of the restaurant is but if you want it to be a little quieter, your best bet might be the patio.It was awesome. I wish I had a bigger appetite because I mean really, I could have kept eating their delicious food. Two of us for lunch ordered the bone marrow spread, feta spread, sausage-stuffed squid, and pork meatballs. My favorites were the bone marrow and the sausage/squid, but I will warn you that you must be ok with strange textures to like the squid dish. It was overall very mushy, which was the only unappealing factor. The feta was our least favorite just because it was so salty...flavor was good but overpowered. I would recommend sticking with just one spread if there are just two in your party; it ends up being a lot of bread and, while they weren't disappointing, I would have liked to try another larger dish.I'd recommend trying this place but am not sure I'd wait 2+ hours for it, myself. I'll also say you should be going for the food and not necessarily the environment, especially if you're looking for a more intimate, private setting. Take my advice and get here around 11:25 before it opens at 11:30 for lunch and you'll be happy you did it."], ["Hoyan L.", "4 stars only because the food was slightly too salty! Otherwise our experience here was great! We also like the restaurant's name, reminds us of Purple Kow in SF but that's a boba shop..We arrived on a Tuesday around 8pm with a party of 7, they told us the wait time would be approximately 2 to 2.5 hours and we almost had a heart attack! But luckily, it was our lucky day and we got called for an available table just 20 minutes later! The restaurant interior is very nice, upscale, rustic, and classy. They also have an outside patio area which is very nice as well. Our waiter was very informative and told us the dishes recommended on the menu. We ordered the meat platter, bone marrow, razor clams, pork shoulder, pig ears with cripsy kale, grilled octopus, and the duck confit. The dishes that stood out to me the most are the pig ears, duck, and the octopus!!! The texture from the crunchy pig ears mixed with the softness and creaminess from the egg and crispiness from the kale was just perfect! I wish I can have more of this dish. The duck confit was gigantic and took quite a bit of manual labor to get the meat out, but the duck meat was very tasty. The grilled octopus was probably the best octopus I've ever had. The outside was crispy while the inside was super tender. I've never had octopus this tender! Actually all the tapas we ordered were very good if only they are not so salty! I was dying from the high sodium intake and drank a ton of water. Overall, it's one of those must-try places when you visit Chicago. We spent about $50/person, which is pretty reasonable for what you get in return. Be mindful that tapas are usually pretty small (so the pictures may be deceiving), but we all left the place happily stuffed."], ["Bridget L.", "This was our second visit after enjoying it a few years ago. On this visit we enjoyed the patio seating, \u00a0a few beers, and meat & cheese boards. \u00a0Cheeses and meats were good but not exceptional, and we expected more creative board displays.Nice touch to leave water jugs for those who drink a lot of water and don't want to wait for staff refills, yet staff comes by to refill as well. \u00a0 The location is very good, right along the magnificent mile."], ["Pranitha P.", "Disappointing. The Purple Pig has been on my list of places to go in Chicago and every dish that came out (except the dessert) was lacking. My roommates and I were told there would only be a 45 minute wait. We were finally seated after about 1.5 hours of waiting. The hostess told us they would call our cell phone once our table was ready. After 45 minutes, we went to check on our seating and they had marked us as seated although we never received the call. We were finally seated, and I ordered the beets (picture below with goat cheese and pistachio) and the endives (terrible to say the least). I tried to save the order with a greek yogurt smear. This had a unique and better flavor, but not sure if it was really worth it.Now the dessert options here are fantastic. We got the Sicilian iris, Loukoumades, and Greek cheesecake. I LOVED the Sicilian Iris.. I mean how could you not loved a filled donut? They slightly redeemed themselves with the dessert, but overall I will not be returning to this restaurant. Wanted to note that my two roommates ate the meat dishes and they were mixed on their review. They ordered the bone marrow (3 stars), pig ear (3 stars), pork shoulder with mashed potatoes (5 stars) and the razor clams (4 stars).They're doing something right because the wait is always long. Just not right for me."], ["Eunji K.", "They don't take reservations. We went at 5:30 and we still had to wait 1.5hrs.We ordered the pig ears, bone marrow, and stuffed squid. We feel like everything is too hyped up... Pig ears- We couldn't really tell that there were pig ears because of the fried batter. We really liked the kale in it though! Bone marrow- Didn't taste like anything. They told us to spread it on the bread like butter, but all I could taste was the bread. Stuffed squid- it was way too salty! We really liked the cider that our waiter recommended though! We got Vandermill Totally Roasted. I think the cider was our favorite from this meal."], ["Angela L.", "Heard a lot of great reviews about this place, so have been meaning to come here for a while.

The service staff was also accommodating with changing our seating arrangement when we discovered a water leak above our heads.Would definitely recommend pairing a wine with the tapas, we ordered the Cava Sangria which was very crisp and sweet.Really liked the bone marrow spread, fried manchego and fried cauliflower, the size proportions were just right for the flavor it packed.Also ordered the milk braised pork shoulder and fried pig ears with kale per prior Yelp reviews. Although the pork shoulder was extremely tender, did feel that both dishes were almost too savory, and difficult to finish entirely. We much preferred the pork blade steak, which was cooked through to just the right texture, and paired with a great salad with feta cheese.Overall, a great dining experience with well proportioned meals to satisfy all appetites, will definitely be coming back again!"], ["Emily P.", "Everything here was tasty, service was great, but there was a lack of cohesiveness in the meal and the flavors.

Mrs and I ordered calamari with fregula, cucumber, and pistachio, milk braised pork shoulder, and smoked pork butt panini with Mediterranean slaw. \u00a0Calamari was delightfully zesty and refreshing and crunch of other ingredients added nice texture to the dish when chewed on. \u00a0Good amount of calamari in the bowl. \u00a0Milk braised shoulder was extremely tender and gravy + mashed potato added a nice flavor to the dish. \u00a0However it was a bit on the saltier end. \u00a0Smoked pork butt panini had a good flavor with a hint of curry like spice. \u00a0Bread was crunchy but not hard enough to the point that it would scrape the roof of your mouth. \u00a0Mediterranean slaw on the side complimented the panini well."], ["Tony N.", "God Damn must be the Midwest. Everyone's so high high strung out here. Sixteen plus tip for rabbit? What is this the fucking walking dead. \u00a0Merle and Daryl were feeding off rabbit. Sixteen bucks. \u00a0I could catch my own rabbit in the Midwest and prep that rabbit to \u00a0taste as good in a post apocalyptic world. Anyone interested should head to the woods catch a rabbit serve it medium well and add a bullshit guacamole sauce (cali representing) to it and make a fallout 4 style restaurant out of it. Also don't let the patron next to you eavesdrop on your threesome conversion. She'll probably get upset. Fucking Midwesterners. So high strung. Ended up in and out for less than a hundy for two. \u00a0Still not worth it. Merle happened to be the name of our server, ironically enough.

Well whiskey at the Misfit."], ["Trina J.", "I FINALLY made it and I did not have a wait. I know. I get it. I was just as shocked as you probably are right now. The potential waiting time has discouraged me time after time. Because while I heard nothing but great things, I struggled to bring myself to make the trek and potentially wait to eat in a city with good restaurants every 40 feet. But I packed my patience and did not need it. The tell all sign of a great meal is a uncomfortably full belly. We came. We ate and left full enough to pop. Two people, five items \u00a0and a doggie bag later, we were glad we ventured over.We ordered the broccoli dish, the roasted beets with goat cheese, fried manchego, pork shoulder and the chicken kebab thighs. Loved it all. \u00a0It was very filling. The plates are small plates intended for sharing but 2-3 per person is plenty. Anything more is going to be left behind or taken to go. There's little chance you can eat much more than that. Trust me, I tried. It's practically impossible. I would definitely return if downtown and would be inclined to order all of the same items with the exception of the pork shoulder and beets. They were good but both are items you could order at many other establishments with trendy selections."], ["Christopher T.", "Exactly the same review as some other Yelp-ers: it was good food, but I didn't give it five stars because it's way too over hyped. It's good stuff, not life-changing like I was lead to believe. In my opinion, a few of the dishes were like taking a bite out of a salt lick. Bottom line: I'm not convinced the food and price for this restaurant are worth the wait - especially when you're in River North. Hope this review is useful for everyone!"], ["Jenny K.", "Visiting Chicago, The Purple Pig was highly recommended but I have to say I left unimpressed. I went in for lunch on a busy Sunday afternoon and sat at the bar. Had a few local crafts which were good. For appetizer, I tried the Fried Pig Ears. I liked the concept and the different textures of this dish but everything in there was heavily seasoned so it was extremely salty. Honestly if the crispy kale wasn't so salty, the overall dish would have been 100 times better. For the next dish, I tried the Pork Shoulder with Mash Potatoes and Gravy. Good size portion, well seasoned, and very tender. No big complaints but nothing that blew my mind. Was expecting a little more from all the yelp raves but it was just...okay."], ["Jenn T.", "Came here off of recommendations from both yelp and friends of ours. The wait was long as expected and we were warned that it would be long. We got a bottle of wine while we waited, which is pretty cool because they let you drink outside in the waiting area. As we got seated, the waiter explained the menu, stating it's a Mediterranean tapas style. Everything on the menu looks so delicious it was hard to pick a few things to try. We got the cheese board as well as the meats selection, which went well with our wine. We also got the octopus which was very delicious, lots of great flavor & highly recommend it. We also tried the steamed fish which was so savory I'm glad the waiter recommended it. My favorite dish was the bone marrow which was so rich and full of flavor, it came with bread and was very yummy. The pig ears was also highly recommended, and we tried it and it was also very good. I really like the crunchy fried pig ears with the kale, they went well together. \u00a0Brussels sprouts were also very yummy as well.The staff was top notch here. The service was great. Definitely highly recommend this place even with the long wait."], ["Mel O.", "I'm so hooked on the pigs ear and kale salad AND the bone marrow salad. Both are salads so I hope it counts for something. Oh - and a glass of Picpoul Pinet is also on the line up!It's always busy but since I'm doing the city solo I've snagged at seat at the bar.

Located in the heart of downtown you cant miss it. The menu literally screamed out 'PIG' from all sides. Packed on a weekday this place seems popular with locals and tourists alike.

Savory and crunchy"], ["N F.", "Bone marrow:I was presented with two very large bone portions with a great deal of marrow, suitable starter dish to share with a companion. \u00a0The zesty citrus cilantro topping contrasted extremely well with the fatty marrow, making it a palatable balanced dish without feeling the diminishing satisfaction one would get eating rich tasting foods like marrow. A more complex sensation of flavors, would overwhelm a plain jane. I've had a lot of bone marrow, and this place knocks it out of the ballpark.... By light years away.The Pork shoulder:Can't go wrong with braised pork. A savory fish with a hint of sweetness. The meat held it's form well while the strings of the meat fell apart with ease. Nice and simple. Iris dessert:Much like a beignet, it has a crispy outter shell and is filled with warm hugs. It has a hint of nutty flavors mixed with melted chocolate chips. Perfect amount of sugar coating. I would have finished this dessert had I had room.In summary, for the amount you pay you will get to quality foods. If one had to choose only one item to order from this restaurant, it's definitely the bone marrow. hands down."], ["Saad S.", "Last night, I went on a date with to the Purple Pig. The atmosphere is very modern with low hanging lights dimly lit with plenty of candles going around the place. We opted for a table instead of the bar since I'm not much of a wine drinker and was mainly there for the food.We started with the Greek Cornbread which was topped with some goat cheese (amongst other things like herbs and stuff) finished with a honey drizzle. It was extremely warm and almost melted in your mouth along with the cheese and the perfect finishing touch of honey balanced all the sharp cheese flavors. I'm not from the west so I haven't had a lot of cornbread but I can say with certainty that this is THE best cornbread I've ever had.Gyro Pita with Beets and some herbs was an interesting item on the menu. I've had Gyro Pita at plenty of diners and regular hole in the wall places so I was curious to see how it was done at an upscale Michigan Ave. restaurant like this, I was very glad that my date ordered it cause there was too many other interesting items (like rabbit roulad!) on the menu for me to waste a choice on this. Boy, was I glad. The gyro was sizzling hot with just enough Tzatziki sauce and I enjoyed having some greens and beets (even though I hate beets) with it.Pork Belly (with something something): Having grown up in Saudi Arabia, the first time I ever tasted pork was shortly after my 17th birthday. It was an honest accident when I thought sausage in a breakfast sandwich meant beef but the weird sweet-ish taste threw me off and my relationship with pork has just never been the same. Last night, at The Purple Pig, I actually genuinely *enjoyed* eating pork for the first time in my life. I think that says enough about this dish.Lastly, and most importantly, the one dish that stole the show was the Rabbit Roulad. Gosh, I couldn't pinpoint whether the taste was closer to chicken or beef. It was unique served with a delicious green sauce made from some truffle (black truffle?) and tasted absolutely yummy.First 5/5 rating for excellent service, delicious food, and great atmosphere. Thank you, TPP!"], ["Maggie H.", "Giving this place 3.5 stars but rounding down because service took longer than I liked. I thought place was wayyyyyy overhyped. We had the bone marrow, pig ear salad, octopus, pork shoulder, meatballs, and Sicilian iris. Honestly my favorite part of the meal was the Sicilian iris, a fried brioche with cookie dough and chocolate chips, followed by the bone marrow. Don't get me wrong, everything was good but definitely not amazing like everyone said it was. In terms of service, the food came out as it was done but getting our check and having them pick it up and then bring it back for us to sign took a lot longer than necessary."], ["Angelique A.", "Excellent service...the place was packed and they went out of the way to accommodate our party of 10 on a Saturday night!Since the wait was 2 hours, we ordered drinks and appetizers out front by a spectacular and cute waiter who was insanely chill despite the tornado of customers around him. We consumed our drinks and apps on a bartop counter in the back before being seated to a real table. I got the 3 Amigos drink ( with pork and rosemary in it!) which was delicious and tasted like caramel sherry. For food I ordered the panini with bacon jam and green tomato jam, which was a super satisfying combo of savory and sweet flavors. I finished off with a lemon cotta dessert which was very creamy and fruit forward...super balanced!My only issue was that they had issues splitting the check 4 ways and our table waitress seemed pretty sour, but it was late on a Sat night by the time we got seated."], ["Michelle W.", "It's tasty, but didn't quite live up to the hype. There was a long wait and they don't take reservations, but we lucked out and managed to find a spot at the bar. They serve the full menu there, so it was perfect! We ordered the whipped burrata cannolis to start -- that was absolutely amazing! It's really brilliant! I like cannolis, but sometimes find that they can be too sweet. However, this one had the perfect texture with the whipped burrata, but was mostly savory and had a little bit of squash to sweeten it. We also ordered a cheese plate and the bartender helped us select the cheeses. They were all very good. Now on to round 2: we got the \"JLT\" it was good but a bit too salty for my liking. It theory it sounds great, but I wish they tempered it down a little bit. Maybe a little less salt in the flavoring/curing or perhaps pairing it with something else a bit more muted? Dessert, though redeemed the dinner. We ordered the fried dough stuffed with nutella. It was fantastic! You really can't go wrong with nutella...the fried dough, though, was light and fluffy. And I believe freshly fried. Also, had a bottle of great wine there! Wish I could tell you what it was, but the bartender chose it for us...Cannoli and dessert: 5 starsJLT: 3 stars"], ["Kelly G.", "Paid $150 to get stuffed with delicious food and wine!*Pigs ear salad - TONS of fried pig ear pieces, not much fried kale.

Nice meaty dish*Morcilla sausage with lobster was sweeter than I expected for a blood sausage. The lobster was perfect and the pea mash was delicious and completely polished off*Duck rillett? some kind of spread. It was alright, but I was sooo full by the time it arrived to the table. Staff recommended a nice pinot noir to accompany everything. Liked the communal seating - this way you could spy on everyone elses dishes and if you were still hungry could order what they got. From this observation we surmised that you shouldn't order the meatballs. Everyone who did seemed genuinely surprised at how little was in the bowl. They are tiny meatballs and there are only maybe 3-4 pieces. No reservations so be prepared to wait +2 hours on a weekend evening. We arrived early Saturday afternoon, 3p to ensure open seating."], ["T B.", "Not worth the hype. Pig platter was good and cheeses ok. Don't get the pig ears. Just ok. Not great flavors. Tasted very oily. The hostess can out of the bathroom and didn't wash her hands. No fan went off while I was waiting after her.

If you're a foodie, like me, it is a fantastic experience.There was a one-hour wait, on a Sunday night, but the bar is first-come, first-served, so you can keep an eye out for open bar seats (which is what we do). The cook line is directly behind the bar -\u00a0there is no kitchen - so sitting there is a front row seat to the food being prepared, and it is a finely-tuned machine. Sous chef, Max Robbins, calls back the orders, and ten line cooks weave in and out of one another's personal space to make them happen. As constant as the movement is, Max always seemed to have time to chat up guests, as they looked on.We started with some Illinois beers -\u00a0Gatecrasher, by Temperance -\u00a0recommended by the friendly and attentive bar staff, and an anitpasti of Cured Mojama Tuna with Quail Eggs and Almond Tarator Sauce. It was very delicate in texture, but robustly flavored.We moved on to some small plates of Fried Chorizo-Stuffed Olives, and the Roasted Bone Marrow Smear. I enjoyed both tremendously. The Pig's Ear Salad looked pretty amazing, as did the Roasted Green Bean Salad.Plan to spend at least two hours in the restaurant, as the food is all prepared to order, and be ready to drop at least $100. It's worth every minute and penny, though."], ["Sallyann Z.", "I have looked forward to dining at the Purple Pig since I moved to Chicago a year ago. Two days ago, I finally had the chance to go with my roommates and we were sorrily disappointed. The food was just okay, leaving us unsatisfied and without a desire to return.With only a 45 minute wait, we were ecstatic that our spontaneous trip to PP was actually happening. My vegetarian roommate ordered the beets (which came with a creamy goat cheese and cruncy pistachio complement) and the endives (our waiter highly recommended this). She had such a look of displeasure after tasting the endives. The robiola tasted terrible and she couldn't believe she had paid $11 for this dish. Because the endives were such a failure, she wanted to redeem her experience at PP by ordering the greek yogurt smear. This was pretty good and a unique taste. Was it worth $12? Questionable...I ordered the classics: bone marrow and pig ear. The flavors of the pig ear were good, but in the end, I felt like I was just eating unidentified crunchy fried bits. There was also too much cherry pepper for my liking. I've only had bone marrow one other time, but something was off about the gelatinous texture of the bone marrow here. I wanted to love it, but I just felt greasy and discontented. My other roommate ordered the pork shoulder with mashed potatoes and the razor clams and loved them both! Glad at least one of us enjoyed their meal.Three hungry girls went in and came out of the dinner portion still craving soooo we ordered three desserts: the Sicilian Iris, the Loukoumades, and the greek cheesecake. My personal favorite was the cheesecake.. so creamy and flavorful! My roommates loved the sicilian iris, a chocolate-filled brioche, which was absolutely sinful!Overall service was fine. We went in checking our our table and they had crossed our name off the list because apparently they had called and received no answer. I guess there was service issues, but thankfully, we still seated shortly. Our server didn't check in too often, but all in all, the Purple Pig didn't live up to our high, high expectations. Don't think we will come back soon, but obviously there are many fans of the place so good for them!"], ["Randy W.", "Excellent food. \u00a0Great atmosphere, friendly staff.Enjoyed the bone marrow salad, foie gras, and the mild braised pork shoulder.There are so many shared plates that I wanted to try.

Olives were horrible. Broccoli and cauliflower was ok too. Others were non memorable Only thing that was good was the wine.

Got seated right away on a Tuesday afternoon, and the servers were very friendly and great at explaining the menu.My bf and I ordered the crispy pig ears, bone marrow, and octopus. The crispy pig ears were my favorite. They were super crispy, mixed with crispy kale and an egg on top. The pickled peppers added a great kick to the dish. The octopus was my second favorite. It was tender and not chewy at all. The salsa verde was a great sauce with it as well as the fingerling potatoes. The bone marrow came with some grilled bread, and was just okay to me. For dessert, we got the sicilian iris, which was recommended by our server. It's like a big donut stuffed with chocolate and ricotta.

When we arrived at 8PM on a Friday night, we were told the wait would be 1.5 hours. Fortunately, they have this system where you put your cellphone number down and they call you when your table is ready.We were lucky and the wait turned out to be only 50 minutes! We explored a nearby candy store while we were waiting.The restaurant is actually somewhat small considering its popularity, although they do have a few outdoor tables as well. The interior is on the darker side, but is fairly modern with some of the lanterns covered with the restaurant's menu. It also gets pretty noisy indoors.Service was not bad during our visit. Our waiter was attentive enough, although different people sometimes brought out our dishes or refilled our water.As for the food, it's tapas style and the portion sizes of various plates can vary considerably. We ended up sharing six dishes between the three of us. All of them were pretty darn delicious, and attention was paid to presentation as well. See all of my photos for details!It IS a little pricey, but you are definitely paying for quality food that is carefully executed. I definitely think it's a great restaurant to come to celebrate a special occasion!"], ["Joy S.", "This place is way too hyped up compare to what it actually is worth. It has exotic menu which made the place popular. Pig ear is overly fried so it lost the crunchiness of the natural pig ears. And you can taste the oil they use to fry it needs to be changed. It tastes old. Bone marrow tastes really plane. The publican has better bone marrow for sure. The octopus is pretty plane too. \u00a0I enjoyed the lobster and sausage dish, the rabbit, the stuffed squid. The pork should is tender. But the spices tastes the same as the prepackaged corn beef from Walmart. Overall it's more for an experience rather than the actual food. If you want exotic food, go to an actual greek, or Chinese restaurant. This one is too Americanized. It tries to hard to fit Americans appetite. Plus the price, I'm not coming back again."], ["Ashley D.", "Wine List - lots to choose from. Two different size pours available and a bottle. Cheese - we had our server choose three cheeses for us to try. Loved them all. Swine - we had the meat plate. Loved it! Other: Beets - these were good, not out of this world. Nutella Crepes - I'd pass on this next time. Atmosphere - I'm not really into sitting at large tables with other people I don't know.

Colleagues/friends and I went there for a rather late lunch (near 2pm) just before heading to the airport. Food was great. Place was crowded. We had roasted bone marrow, fried pig ears, turkey leg, octopus, and braised pork. Everything was delicious. My personal fav out of what we ordered was, to my surprise, the turkey leg. It was the fall-off-from-the-bone turkey leg! Highly recommend the place and if I have the chance to visit downtown Chicago again, I probably will go back to try their other dishes!"], ["Ellen W.", "I could eat here every day. They are always changing their menu with the seasons, their service is fantastic, and their wind selection is great. I love getting the pig platter and a bottle of wine to share with a friend.

Perfect for date nights though!"], ["Marya M.", "We came here on a Saturday at 1145am and got seated outside right away. We got placed on a large communal table. This place is very happening.

Not a must though.The squid - well madeChicken kabob - I would skip this one ...too fatty. Unfortunately for us both desert items that we ordered were also not great. So also skip the crepe and the doughnut hole.Overall it would a good experience.... I would come back to try different items on the menu."], ["Jasmine K.", "The Purple Pig has been me and my husband's all time favorite restaurant for as long as we've lived in Chicago (6 years). This little spot tucked away on Michigan Avenue is home to some of the best foods of Greece, Italy and Spain- served by by the incredible chef, Jimmy Bannos Jr. You can't go wrong with the delicious milk braised pork shoulder, the broccoli with anchovy vinaigrette, any of the smears (but the pork neck bone gravy and roasted bone marrow are the best), pork blade steak, razor clams and the octopus. Of course their charcuterie is top notch, so always a great starter. The servers and bartenders are all very well versed on their extensive wine list which is always helpful, although we always decide to go with a Spanish red, typically a tempranillo. Lastly, if you have not retained any other information from this review, make sure you do not leave without having a Sicilian Iris for dessert! This is definitely one of my favorite desserts of all time. Imagine this... fried brioche filled with the melted deliciousness that is chocolate and ricotta cheese. They sometimes go quickly, so I often reserve one when ordering dinner.The only downside to this restaurant is they do not take reservations, so there are long waits. the best thing to do is get there early, when you aren't hungry, you can put your name in and they will call you. During this time you can explore the Magnificent Mile or grab a drink at the busy bar area. Remember the bar is first come first serve, so I often scope out the area for people getting their checks and scoop up their seat. I think we've eaten more times at the bar than at an actual table. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Eat here, you will love it!!!"], ["Irene H.", "They don't take reservations so expect a wait after you put your name and number down. For a Saturday night we waited for 2 hours to get seated. Good thing our hotel was across the street so it wasn't bad, but the location is also central shopping grounds, so you can kill time. Also they change their menu on a daily basis so always expect a surprise, of course there are some items that do stay consistent throughout or might cycle back but there is no specific order.Overall the service was great, waitress attentive. The food was a little disappointing. We ordered the Pig Ear and Kale and the slices were too thin, you could really only taste the crispy exterior but not the actual chewiness of the pig ear. The kale was done well but overall, I thought there was too much seasoning and a tad salty for my palate. But the cracked egg over the top and you had to stir in combined really well with everything else. The Seafood dish was very good, it was mixed seafood combined in this tomato based sauce. Great flavor and a larger portion than the typical tapas. We also got the Milk Braised Pork Shoulder and that was done very well, the meat came right off. I wish there was a little more sauce because by the time we got to the center of the pork shoulder it was a little dry and not enough sauce left to coat the meat so we didn't finish it. We also got a dish that consisted of squid stuffed with cheese and that was delicious, the cheese and squid combo sounded interesting but tastes amazing, a truly unique creation. Not exactly sure if the two hour wait was worth a couple of the dishes were delicious."]]}
