If Yelp allowed half stars (and they should) I would also give this location a 3.5. A strong 3.5. I rather enjoyed the food. It's fun. It's fast. It's affordable. It's mobile (well at least the bao buns). You can either order at the kiosk and get a number or order from the cashier and get a number. The big stackable steamers where the bao buns live kind of remind me of the whack-a-mole game, but instead of whacking moles the servers are grabbing buns. They have 6 packs of bao buns; you pick the flavors, for under $10. Combo of salad or different soup and 2 bao buns for $8. Absolutely delicious cold spicy noodles, sauce served on the side. Fresh ginger, ginger ale's. Well it clearly has fresh ginger in it, but it concerns me a little that it's coming from a tap, makes me feel like it might be mixed with something on the less than healthy side. Regardless it was refreshing and went well with the spiciness of the food. I ordered a chicken flavored bun and a bbq pork bun. To be honest, I couldn't tell you which was which, but I can tell you they both tasted good. I am definitely going to check out the other locations and eat my way through those hot Asian buns (that's their tagline, not mine)."], ["Sarah G.", "I first had Wow Bao at Riot Fest where I got two boas for $6 which for festival food pricing isn't too bad.

So we go into the tower to find there are no tables by this venue (I guess there are a few up the escalators maybe??) but here I could get 6 baos for less than $10!!!

Here is the run down of a few worth mentioning:Whole Wheat Edamame: not the best...thought it would be tasty and a healthy bao, but \u00a0it just had no flavor...Kung Pao: so so good and spicy! packed with flavor!

The soup was packed full of crisp vegetables in a clear broth and was exactly what I was craving. I then ordered vegetable lo mein, which was a thinner noodle than I'm used to in lo mein, but it did not disappoint.

This is the first time in a restaurant I came across porridge served with a raw egg (optional but highly recommended) that you can stir in once it's served. The heat from the porridge cooks the egg. I had this growing up and it's been a couple years since I last tried it. But I still love it as much now if not more. We also had their beef noodles, authentically cantonese. Even my bf who's not used to canton food really loved the beef noodles. I also liked their home made hot sauce. We had tried hot sauce from various asian restaurants and this one is right amongst the top of the list.

When I got home... oh my... there was so much food in that carton and I had only paid $6.10 including tax. I was too focused on eating so I didn't take a picture (sorry guys), but it was literally large enough for two people, easy. I ate it all solo.And why are they open at all hours of the night?

Along with their beef satay noodles soup, fish with sweet and sake sauce is delicious too.The way the Chi cafe is set up is pretty cool, their tables have drawers so the diner can help themselves with napkins, chop sticks and soups.

I feel like some of the places here have been I underwhelming or letting me down a little. What we ordered:Sizzling beef - try it even if it's one too many dishes you order for one visit. The meat is so tender and juicy and the sauce is the right amount of sweetness and savory. Plus. It's sizzling when it comes out. So you know it's cooked right then and there just for you to enjoy hot off the skillet. Salt and pepper squid - I try this dish at every Chinese place I go to, so I just had to try it here. I've heard that it's actually a little inconsistent with the amount of salt used because my friends actually said they've had it when it was a mouthful of salt before. This time tho, it was just right!String beans - your usual tasty string beans. I have yet to have bad strong beans...Congee - it's done right here but I'm not entirely sure how one goes wrong with congee lol. You can add a little soy sauce for flavor or not. You can add a little spice. Or not. It's simple, filling, warming and comfort food to the max. Noodles - I thought our group might need one more dish to help with the variety, so I pointed at one of the noodle dishes on the page and said \"this one\". He asked if I wanted rice noodles or egg noodles. \"Whatever is in the picture here.\" So it was a nice plate of rice noodles that was good but in conjunction with the other dishes right next to it on the table, I would have to say it was the least favorite of the meal. It's still good tho, don't get me wrong. Overall. A great lunch here and will definitely come back for the sizzling beef. Maybe late night eats like everyone else has reviewed."], ["Tamir G.", "Good food, fast service, kid friendlyHad a good experience and enjoyed our lunch. They do tend to go a bit salty so beware.

For main course, I always choose fish fillet with ginger and onion, an excellent hong kong style dish which packs a lot of flavor with chinese ginger and onions. Yesterday we also tried the fish fillet hot pot which had tender fish, chilli powder, cooking oil, cabbage & bean sprouts. It was not as flavorful as the ginger fish, but not bad."], ["Linda C.", "This place was the place to go after long hours of partying.

We were tempted to order appetizer along with our meals but we're glad we didn't! If not, we would have ended up tossing our food at the hotel. I know mommy said ' don't you waste food'.

We were also very lucky because there was one table left. The guy that seated us didn't hesitate to give us a booth that could have easily seated 6 people even though we were only 3. Some restaurants might have made us wait and saved that booth for a larger party. So high marks on the excellent customer service we immediately received. Our arrival time was perfect because a few minutes later there was a line out the door and outside in the plaza. Our waiter Leo was really nice and had a great friendly attitude. As he went to set our table he opened a hidden drawer underneath our tabletop. I immediately pointed out how cool that was. I asked Leo if every table had the drawer and he looked around and said that only 90% of them had it. So your odds are pretty good to get a table with this high tech secret drawer, if you eat here. I told Leo that I thought it was a great idea and he told me that he wants me to feel like home. \u00a0He was very funny. I was so happy I was eating here. When Leo walked away, I couldn't resist checking out the drawer. I even snapped a few photos and thought this should be installed at every restaurant. The secret drawer did come in handy when my little one wanted chop sticks and a few extra napkins. I didn't have to try and flag down a server. I was able to fix the problem myself. Everything on the menu looked fantastic and all of the options looked really good. We decided to start out with a pork egg roll and some shrimp dumplings. The egg roll was really good and I will need to come back and get my own. Luckily I was able to secure a tiny bite before my little one finished it. The girls were not fans of the shrimp dumplings which was good news for me. Finally I was able to get an app to enjoy mostly by myself. This seldom happens in Chinese restaurants. The girls said we would not order that again but I'm thinking I may have to get it all to myself next time. For entrees my little one ordered a giant bowl of Meatball Vermicelli Soup. It was perfect for kids. Lots of thin spaghetti, with 5 meatballs, some bokchoy & a broth. The entire bowl was thoroughly enjoyed and the little one used the chop sticks to eat the pasta and meatballs. I was really proud of her. I know there was no way I could have done that at her age.My wife ordered the Sizzling Beef Tenderloin in a black pepper sauce. This was probably my favorite dish of the day. I would order it but it is my wives favorite and I don't want to ruin her once a year moment. The flavors were so good and the dish came out sizzling hot. The presentation reminded me of fajitas in a Mexican restaurant but tasted more fantastic. The beef was cooked perfectly plus it was nice and tender. I was lucky enough to get the finished dirty dish and I mixed the white rice in the remaining gravy and loved my little snack. Yum!On a side note there is no extra charge for rice here like some of the other restaurants around here. The extra rice per person charge can be annoying. One of the reasons I came here was that there menu on their website had Sichuan Spicy Chicken. This is one of my favorite dishes but when I opened my menu this dish was missing. I asked Leo if the chef could make it. He said yes but then I asked why it wasn't on the menu any more. Leo told me that customers didn't get the dish because they didn't like all the chili peppers on there. I was so surprised because Sichuan and spicy kind of tell you it's going to have peppers. Leo assured me that even though it is not on the menu the chef will make it for me. I totally feel like I'm ordering from a secret menu!I was really happy with my dish and I would order it again. I am sad that it is no longer on the regular menu. I was lucky they haven't removed it from their website or I would have never known about it. In fact, that dish was the main reason we chose to eat at this restaurant. So thanks to the chef and Leo for being so accommodating in my request. I loved the spiciness of the dish but I wish it was hotter. It is a little hotter down the way but I wanted to try a new place. There was also toasted black pepper and possibly anise seed. I'm not sure but the flavors were very different in my mouth. I love eating such dishes that remind me of nothing I've ever tasted before in my life. This dish definitely delivered that experience. We had a great lunch and it was nice to get away from our regular Chinatown restaurants we typically visit. This makes us richer and adds another restaurant we can go to, when we are in the mood for some yummy food. Our service was out of this world and I owe all that to Leo. I know when I come back I will ask for him because he made our meal an enjoyable moment. And if you do come here make sure you check out the hidden drawer. It is really cool and I guarantee you will want this at every restaurant you dine at. \u00a0Thanks Chi Cafe for a great day."], ["Rachel T.", "Very good Chinese food and it's open very late! Food is cheap and generous. It's always fun to bring a group of people and get a bunch of different dishes to share.

I never order anything except for the salt & pepper squid and sizzling beef w/ sweet saki sauce~The only problem with the beef is that it's kind if a strange texture (I saw it mentioned in another earlier review *chewy/rubbery texture*) and the onion to beef ratio haha. We're always like did we order onions with beef or beef with onions? I don't really like seafood and definitely had no desire to eat squid at that, but this is the only kind I'll eat.There was only one bad experience I had with the squid where it was super overcooked and I couldn't even bite through it because it was so hard, but it's been perfect the last two times I've been there~"], ["Veronica X.", "4 people, $50 and I liked all of the 7 dishes we ordered except for one (beef in satay sauce). Very short wait during lunch hours on both of the two weekends we went.XO Sauce Rice Noodle Rolls was a little spicy and very tasty. Congee reminded me of home (sliced beef congee was better than the fish congee). Braised beef brisket was always tender and flavorful. Even lamb (something not usually on the menus of Cantonese restaurants) was quite good.

I can't say enough great things about this place! From the food to the quick service to the prices! I mean this place is truly a stoner's delight. You get ALL this food(great portions) for such a good price. I recommend ummm everything on the menu?! The beef satay is juicy thin sliced succulent and just delicious! A must try. The crab Rangoon I can't rave enough about perfectly crunchy and filled with cream cheese yum yum yum.

A must try if you're in or around Chinatown."], ["Amie G.", "So I went here because it had a great review and seemed fairly cheap. There were a lot of options of food and maybe it's because I had the American choice (Orange Chicken) but I wasn't that impressed. Some of the other and more interesting choices of foods seemed a bit tastier looking. My food was hot but overall sort of bland. The ornate chicken was fried so it did not seem to be breaded in house which is a shame. My banana smoothie was even lacking some taste. The interior however was beautiful!"], ["Pretty M.", "Service is ok. Food is pretty good. I had the beef spicy noodle. Not the best I have had so far but it is ok"], ["Mandy Y.", "The big draw to this place is that it's 24hrs and it's decent Chinese food but I don't get all of the raving reviews. My isssue is that they blatantly serve the Chinese patrons first, as soon as they sat down they were poured fresh coffee while we had to wait a considerable amount of time. Whatever. The food was on par with Panda Express at about the same prices and quality. Happy hour menu was decent and my husband was happy that they served large clean shrimp in their rice. Their Kung Pao chicken was okay.... Significantly lacking spice but maybe they thought I couldn't handle it. Haha All in all, the food was good enough to return after a long night but I think there is better Chinese to be had in Chinatown."], ["Contessa R.", "New place looks nice. However, I don't like how they have seating side by side with other guests. Also I was freezing despite my warm tea. The acoustics in the new space are BAD, waiters can't hear you, it's just too loud. Fail. The tables are nice but smaller. When I come with my boyfriend I usually like to sit side by side next to each other in a booth. I think this option is no longer available. Finally the bright light above the tables are too bright. I do like the warm lighting over the tables in the middle of the aisle.Overall, I love the food, the hours and most of all the price. I actually liked the service, but since the acoustics are off now, you lose some aspects of the service. If any of these change I may end up not coming back. I hope they fix the insulation issue before winter or prepare to wear your coats, hats and gloves to dinner!"], ["Tira R.", "I love this place. I just ordered delivery and the driver arrived within 30 minutes which was fast. I live in the loop which is like 15 minutes driving from the restaurants.

I thought to check this place out because of the volume of the people eating there compared to its nearest establishment that serves tomato beef on rice.I also order hot milk tea to go with my tomato beef on rice. The food is good. It might be a little sweet for my taste but overall it tasted good with a hint of homecookedness. I love the hot milk tea. Since they left it up to me to add the sugar, it was under my control if I want to keep it a little bitter (which is how I like it).I ordered Singaporean noodles and Black Pepper Beef noodles to go as well. When I brought it (Singaporean noodles) to a friend who hasn't eaten much due to stress, she went for seconds and thirds. The Singaporean noodles is indeed very good. The Black Pepper Beef noodles is alright. The noodles and the black pepper beef/ broth are given to me in separate containers. I may try and eat the Black Pepper Beef noodles in the store instead next time. I'm not quite sure if it is good reheated.Overall, I love the homecooked taste of their food.

I love this place and the fact that it's open until 2am! We always seem to get the same thing (as pictured) - salt and pepper wings, sizzling beef tenderloin in black pepper sauce and seafood fried rice. I tried the hot and sour soup once and it was also really good. The friend rice here is very unique with a hint of curry and coconut. I love that! The beef is always on point and goes well with the rice. Wings are delicious! I'll have to try new dishes here and their menu is huge!! The price is really good for the food as well."], ["Victor N.", "Currently living in Columbus, OH, where there is no Chinatown...oh how I've missed good Chinese/Asian food. Everything we ordered was pretty on-point. Fried fish fillet in sweet saki sauce was bomb. Sauce was semi-sweet and was great to eat over the rice. Eggplant in garlic sauce was tasty. Beef in rice noodles were great. Fried tofu was really good - came with a bunch of fried fishes - small, anchovy-like? They were crispy and limey - gave a great contrasting flavor. Price wasn't too bad; each plate was $7-$10. Only thing I could have maybe wished more for was more white rice. Each (non-noodle) dish came with a small bowl of white rice. 4 dishes for 3 of us...we could have probably gone with 3 (to give you an idea of portion sizes)."], ["Thai N.", "Best chinese restaurant in China Square!!!Fast service + great food and that with an awesome reasonable price.RECOMMEND!!!"], ["Kendall N.", "This is the most mediocre Asian food I've had in a long time.

We tried the Garlic Chicken Wings, Rice Cake with Sizzling Beef, custom noodle order of rice noodles with shrimp that came with a free Milk Tea, and Shredded Chicken that came with really dry jasmine rice. The best thing was the Shredded Chicken but the West Coast does it way better. We only came here to try Asian food in Chinatown and this was an utter disappointment.

The waiters here all speak Cantonese which is great because I've noticed the majority of asian transplants in Chicago speak Mandarin. They have many different items to order here, you can probably find something new that youd want to eat each time and theyd all taste delicious. The food comes out really quickly. I have ordered the tomato beef rice, curry beef rice, wonton noodle soup, breakfast menu rice porridge, beef tendon noodles, and XO sauce pan fried noodles. \u00a0All the items tasted exactly how they usually taste, except I feel that the noodle soups could be a bit larger. \u00a0You would need 2 noodle soups to feel full.

I love the design of the inside, very modern and lively. I wasn't too hungry so I only ordered the shrimp wonton noodle soup and it was good. It was with egg noodles. I felt like the soup was pretty bland, just tasted like egg noodles. The wontons were good, gave some flavor to the soup.

My go-to dish is the Sizzling Beef Tenderloin in Sweet Saki Sauce. It's completely worth the headache I get afterward from the MSG. You can order it without the MSG, but it won't taste completely the same.My other dishes are the Sizzling Beef Rib with Black Pepper Sauce (spicy) and Garlic On Choy (but be prepared to have major garlic breath afterward). I think their beef dishes generally are pretty solid. Their Bamboo with Baby Bok Choy dish was not good though.The watermelon smoothie with tapioca is made from real fruits and tastes good, but I like Lee Wing Wah's smoothies better (down the plaza).

You've heard of xiao long bao (aka XLB or Shanghai soup dumplings), right? Well, these aren't soup dumplings but rather juicy dumplings. Qing Xiang Yuan delivers divine dumplings in a secret location that is literally off the map - the food court of Chinatown which I never knew existed until recently. Like many carts/merchants in Asia, Qing Xiang Yuan specializes in one thing and does it very well. These dumplings are full of juice from the fat that melts from the filling as they are cooked. They have more juice/soup inside of them than other places that were supposedly xiao long bao. One bite, you'll immediately notice that each one is freshly handmade since everything is made to order and the filling is packed with meat juices. It's like the Gushers Fruit Snack from the 90's for northern Chinese dumplings. These delicate and flavorful little pillows are heavenly. The great thing about Qing Xiang Yuan is that there is no secret menu, you don't have to order in Chinese, the food is consistent, and each order is pretty large. The real secret is the location. Just go down the alley, take a left, down the stairs, and it's the third or fourth vendor. I don't know what Qing Xiang Yuan means but my guess is that it literally translates to Heavenly Meat Juice Gushers Dumplings."], ["Lisa H.", "Qing Xiang Yuan Dumplings is located in the food court of Richland Center. \u00a0There you can find many other types of restaurants, shops, and even a barber. \u00a0The restaurant specializes in dumplings which are the only options on their menu. \u00a0Don't fret my friends, they do offer a wide array of dumplings so there are something for everyone (unless you don't like dumplings...then I have no clue why you are even considering this restaurant).The dumplings are made to order, so be a little patient. \u00a0I shared an order of 16 dumplings with my sister. \u00a0We opted for the pork, shrimp, and leek dumplings. \u00a0The dumplings were delicious: piping hot, bursting with flavor, and oozing with soup. \u00a0Be careful biting your first bite, the juices are super hot and you can get burned.If you want a quick and satisfying snack, definitely give this place a try. \u00a0The owner is extremely nice and can help you make a decision if you can't decide. \u00a0Don't forget to use the vinegar and hot oil for that added flavor."], ["Amy V.", "this place is in the Richland Mall. \u00a0we were a bit lost because no one could help us locate where this was. \u00a0it was actually really easy.Go inside the front entrance of Richland Mall. \u00a0look to your left and you'll see some stairs. \u00a0go down those stairs. \u00a0the food place will be on your left about 3-4 places down.got the shrimp and pork dumplings. \u00a0very good. \u00a0soft and juicy. \u00a0the outside wrapping was okay. \u00a0good but I've had better.overall, I liked it!"], ["Daniel N.", "I got some soup dumplings to supplement the noodle soup from another restaurant in the food court.

It was a tad annoying because it was difficult to pry the dumplings off the wicker basket. If you've had soup dumplings, you know how sad it is when they prematurely burst and you lose all the delicious broth.There were about 16 dumplings per order, priced around $9 each."], ["Jeffrey C.", "I'm sad I found this tucked away dumpling spot so late in the game, otherwise I would have spent more hard-earned money on these fantastic dumplings. We'll just call it QXY, and it's located in the underground Richland shopping mall that's only sparsely populated at all times.First of all, the minus one star is for the absurdly long wait time it takes to get these dumplings. It's a double-edged sword, really. QXY handmakes all its dumplings to order (you can watch them being made in the stall), which is a plus-plus in my book. That means the make plus steam for an order can and ought to run you 20 minutes. That's a fine wait for these delectable pockets of tasty. Unfortunately, if there's any number of orders ahead of yours, the wait time increases three-fold. We always paired the dumpling order with a bowl of soup from neighboring Yummy Yummy Noodles. Those bad boys come out in five minutes, whereas a typical dumpling order has ranged from 30-60. All of this is a roundabout way of saying that if you want to eat these things without an absurd wait, call ahead and be prepared to speak Chinese, or come at a very off time and hope there isn't a plethora of orders ahead of yours.As for the actual dumplings themselves, they rock, as you'd expect from made-on-the-spot. Each order comes with 18 dumplings for a very reasonable price ($6 on the cheaper end, $9 on the higher). If you're coming into dumplings entry-level, try the pork and cabbage (or pork and coriander if anti-green). If you're feeling bolder, go with a lamb choice. Those can be steamed \"soup dumpling\" style in a traditional bamboo steamer, providing an extra oomph of juice into every bite. There are other beef, chicken, and seafood options to satisfy your fancy.There's no special sauce here, but QXY provides an array of soy sauce, vinegar, and chili oil to create your own."], ["Tian Y.", "This place is inside the Richland Center food court on the edge of Chinatown Square near the El and the parking lots that no one I know has ever ventured into because we always thought stuff there would be sketch and bad.I really craved dumplings though but hadn't thought far enough into where I'd go to get them, and it took us some effort to find the booth.It's definitely not a quick meal. They wrap and cook all the dumplings to order, and you get like 18 in an order for around $7. That's a lot of dumplings to make on the fly. Add a side of kelp salad for $1 and you've got the homiest cheap meal in town from a really friendly family business. The dumplings themselves are good. They're not like the ones my mom makes, that's for sure. I think personally, I prefer Katy's in Westmont still.

AND they're only about $6-8 for 18 dumplings. I wasn't feeling all too adventurous, so I ordered the pork and leek, a classic combination. The first thing you notice is that the dumpling skin is not very thick - I personally really like this. There was a nice stuffing-to-skin ratio (aka, it was high). Next, the filling itself is surrounded by a nice pool of soup. These are your classic soup dumpling you'd find at, say, din tai fung, but they are DELICIOUS. You can make your own dipping sauce with soy sauce, vinegar and chilis. I added about equal volumes of each and it was perfect for me.

This place does take time to cook. It was pretty much a 45 minute wait for our soup dumplings (pork and cabbage & pork and onion). It wasn't served together at the same time so I got some pretty cold pork and cabbage dumplings. When they're hot, they're delicious-- the soup pops in your mouth. I'd like to come back again and try their other dumplings (and call ahead) so I can enjoy their xiao long baos as they were intended: hot and piping.

I had read about this dumplings joint in the Chicago Read: chicagoreader.com/Bleade\u2026And every since then I had been wanting to visit. 3 months later I finally got the chance and I am very impressed. It is located in the basement of Richland Center in Chinatown. You walk into the sliding glass doors and you want to take the stairs on the left going down. Don't bother reading the sign that lists the different stores inside the center because Qing Xiang Yuan is not listed. At first walking down the stairs was a bit awkward, I had no idea what I was walking into. Once you enter the actual foodcourt it was a bit awkward too, nothing glamorous, about 15 ish tables, which must not be enough during busy lunch hours so plan to have somewhere else to eat your food if you come during busy hours. I have been told by Qing Xiang Yuan that during lunch hours the lines are super long. Many varieties of dumplings to choose from, I ordered the Lamb with Corriander and Egg, shrimp and leek dumplings. My favorite are the egg/shrimp/leek, but that is because personally I am not a huge meat eater. I was told that the lamb with corriander is a very popular option. The skin of the dumplings had a great bite to it, not very thick. The lamb with corriander dumplings has soup on the inside. They do make them from scratch when you ordered, I had told the lady I wanted extra veggies and less meat and she was very willing to accommodate. The whole process takes about 10-15 min to wait out, but honestly, you'd have to wait that long if you were ordering at a restaurant anyway. It is so very worth it for fresh hand made dumplings that are made to order. Everything comes labeled on the container if you were to take out, I interacted with two ladies who work there and they are very friendly, honestly, friendly workers are hard to come by at Asian joints. I was informed that they have been open for 8 months as of May 2015. There are also bathrooms inside the food court. All in all, $7.99 for my shrimp, egg and leek dumplings and $8.99 for my lamb and corriander dumplings. I did not count how many there were per order because I was too eager to eat them, but one reviewer did say there are around 18 and I will not disagree."], ["Keith T.", "The best place you would get dumpling in Chicago!

Just. Whoa. I read all the reviews before I went, so I thought I knew what to expect.

The lamb and coriander is the hands-down winner and I would eat it every day if I could. Ok, maybe not everyday, but I was so incredibly giddy eating those delicious little dumplings. It is totally not cliche to say it was a \"party in my mouth.\" Seriously. Take cash, be patient, and just get ready for the goodness. Proof that it's not about a \"celebrity\" chef or \"destination\" brick and mortar restaurant. It's all about the quality and authenticity of the food and Qing Xiang gets it exactly right.

The last two times I wanted to try these handmade dumplings, I was turned away by an alarmingly long wait time. It was quick baffling at the time how a food court place could queue for 40 minutes... but after finally getting a chance to try these handcrafted dumplings, I can see why. The menu is pretty straight forward. Dumplings, dumpings, dumpings, and some small sides. the dumplings come in many varieties, which allows for multiple trips to try them all. For my first time visiting I went with the traditional pork and leek dumpling. The dumplings are made to order and because of that come out super fresh. As soon as I put in the order, I saw the nice lady taking the order and starting to wrap. Because of this though, the wait time can seem a bit long. However, the wait is well worth it. The freshness of the ingredients really shine through as the dumplings pop with flavor and soup as soon as you bite down. The simplicity of it is key, as you are able to mix your own dipping sauce out of soy sauce, vinegar, hot spicy oil, and sesame oil. Overall, this place is a steal. I ended up counting 18 dumplings on my plate for the price of $5.99! I definitely will be back again to try all the other varieties they have to offer (probably during an off hour or calling ahead so the wait time is manageable)."], ["My B.", "Handmade deliciousness. \u00a0We had the pork & shrimp and the other was chicken. \u00a0Even my kids went nuts for them.The wait is long but well worth it. \u00a0If you are a first timer don't come starving and expecting your order to be ready in 5 mins."], ["Sarah T.", "I get why people don't like coming to this food court.

However, Lao Sze Chuan more than made up for its atypical location with relatively authentic Chinese food. One of our guests had spent 2 years in China and said this food was among the best he had had in the states. The venue is a little atypical as well. The setting was very modern and top 40 music was playing lightly in the background. The staff was friendly, prices were reasonable, and definitely go with a group if possible and plan to share meals family style. Just a heads up, the spice is for real so if a dish is labeled as spicy, it will have a kick to it. We had the dumplings, green beans, spicy lamb, general tsaos tofu, and several other sides that left us all very full and happy. Our only minor complaint was it took a long time to get the check at the end. Overall, a very cool spot!"], ["Mike M.", "Pretty good food but horrible service...I heard great things about the Lao Sze Chuan in Chinatown and saw that they recently opened up a new location on Michigan Ave, so we decided to check it out. I've been to some restaurants where the quality of the food was location specific, so I was hoping that wasn't the case for this place. \u00a0Ambiance: When you first walk in there's a small lobby area and you take the elevator upstairs to the actual restaurant. The decor of the restaurant was actually really impressive. It had a very new and modern feel to it. We had a pretty large group, so they sat us in the upstairs area, which was a bit more private and had 5 or 6 huge round tables. FOOD: Luckily, the food was actually pretty good. We ordered a bunch of different things to get a good variety of food. The size of the dishes are on the smaller side, not like the huge plates you usually get at any local Chinese restaurant. Chef's special dry chili chicken - This is one of their more popular items. Chunks of lightly breaded chicken that were coated in some sort of awesome spicy dry rub mixture. Super tasty chicken, especially if you're a fan of spicy food. Half of the plate was covered in chili peppers. Definitely made me sweat.Orange beef tenderloin - The beef was very good. The meat itself actually had a crispy texture on the outside and was tender in the middle. It was covered in a very thick and sweet sauce. Solid dish.Tony's 3 chili chicken - This was crispier than the dry chili chicken with a bit more breading, but definitely not as spicy. Still had a good flavor. It's closer to the pepper chicken that I've had at other Chinese restaurants before. Pork dumplings - Steamed dumplings that were filled with mostly green onions inside. Meh.Singapore noodles - Very thin noodles mixed with chicken and vegetables. It didn't have that much sauce and I thought it was kind of lacking in flavor overall. Twice cooked pork - Thinly sliced pieces of pork. Came with a great sauce and the meat was fatty and flavorful.Crispy shrimp in lemon sauce - Loved the crispiness of the shrimp (guess it lived up to its name). It was coated in a sweet and sour tasting type sauce. House special hot and sour soup - This place does not mess around when it comes to spice. My friend always complains food isn't up to his preferred spice level, and he was put in his place tonight. This soup had him sweating and tearing up a little bit.Usually I like to focus mostly on the food in my reviews, but the service was just so bad that unfortunately it overshadowed the whole experience for me.Service: TERRIBLE. I'm usually pretty tolerant of bad service, especially when the food is good, but they were just so many mistakes and it wasn't even that busy when we went. \u00a0STRIKE #1: Messed up ordersSince we had a pretty big group, we wanted to make things easier for our server, so we figured out all the orders for the table and had one guy give the order. We even wrote it out in our phone so it was clear what we were ordering. The food came out surprisingly fast, but we were missing 3 of the dishes we ordered. We figured it might be coming out in phases so we just waited. Nope, guess not. Our server didn't even check up on us after the food came out. The girl filling up the waters was the only bright spot in terms of the service. She called our waiter over for us. Missing one dish is understandable, but 3?? By the time we got the missing food we were literally already done with the other food and weren't even hungry anymore. \u00a0STRIKE #2: Slow/Unhelpful ServiceThe service was pretty slow the entire night, and dinner definitely took way longer than we anticipated. It took so long to ask for anything. First it took forever to straighten out all the missing orders. Then after we finished eating, we simply wanted to see the dessert menu. Even that took 10+ minutes. We had no clue where our server went. It shouldn't take that long to grab a pile of menus. By the time he finally came back we didn't even feel like eating dessert anymore. We just wanted to get out of there. But even that wasn't an easy task. We asked for our check and once again our waiter disappeared and we were just waiting there to pay. Since it was our first time here, we weren't sure how much food would be good for a group our size. We took a best guess and asked our server if he thought we ordered enough food. His response was that we could order whatever we want and if we wanted to, we could order another 10 dishes. Okay...that wasn't even really the question and an absolutely useless response. Overall:Again, I like to focus on the food at the places I go to since that's what I'm really interested in. It takes a really bad experience to distract me from that. I'll be generous and not give them 1 star just because I enjoyed the food. And as bad as the service was, it could probably still improve since they did just open up a few months ago."], ["paul d.", "Food was good.

My husband and I knew about this place after trying their samples on the street. We came here for lunch. There were only three tables occupied including ours. We ordered Szechuan dumplings and Dry chilli chicken and it took about 20mins. So we were wondering how long it will take when this restaurant is full. The taste of the food: I gave it four stars. The dumplings and chicken were very tasty. The chicken was spicy just like how we wanted. The quality and quantity of the meal: I gave it three stars. The dumplings offer 8 pieces for $7.95, which is alright. The chicken was $14.95, and there was 40% chicken and 60% chilli. Of course, I don't think anybody would eat the chilli. So personally, $14.95 for an entree which I can only get 40% of chicken, isn't worth the price at all. Moreover, the entre here doesn't come with rice, which I find it quite strange, as most of Asian restaurants offer rice with the entree, either brown or white. Here, you will have to buy a tiny bowl of rice for $1. And they only offer white rice.Overall, I gave this place three stars. I would come back here again to try another entree since the taste of the food is delicious. I just hope they will modify the quality of the food and somehow shows us the meal is worth the money..."], ["Ann H.", "Was very excited to try this new restaurant. Reservations were over the phone and straightforward. We were seated within 3-4 minutes and ordered the Xiao long baos in the steam basket. The dumplings were consistent with the other Tony restaurants. The skin was a bit thicker than I am used to though it isn't quite fair to compare them to ding tai fung. The second dish we tried was the orange beef tenderloin. Dish was pretty salty to come without rice. I'm not sure how they expect diners to eat it alone. The dish came lukewarm - cold outside and warm in the center. Note that ALL Lao Sze Chuan restaurants charge for rice and tea (1.00 ea). I was surprised at the charge for rice- it's not typical of Chinese restaurants but we were swiftly educated by the host that this is common place for Tony Hu \"Lao sze chuan\" restaurants. Still, it's strange to have to pay for rice regardless of it's grade. I rather it be built into the dish price than see it as a separate fee. Two waitresses handled our table since one was training. The service was acceptable.Water came quickly from other wait staff.Jury still out in this restaurant, perhaps a few kinks to work out with service since it's just starting out. I do hope this stays since Lao 18 was in our neighborhood and since closed.

We were immediately greeted from a distance by our (host? Server?-- she turns out to be our server) and seated. Through the whole experience, our server was attentive to our needs and questions. Kudos to her. Now the menu takes a bit of time looking through because of all the options available but we knew hindsight what we wanted to get. Plus, we were given complimentary spiced cabbage to kick start our meal. Starting with the appetizers, we got the spring rolls and crab rangoon. And to be honest, you'd best skip these two. Nothing really special about the spring rolls. It looked pretty sub standard compared to the ones I've tried from other chinese establishments. Had a nice texture and flavor but I expected better. The crab Rangoon was a major let down and not worth the price. 5.45$ for four pieces of fried wonton with cream cheese and a bit of nonexistent crab. I was thinking to myself that these were going to be large because of how much they were giving you (only 4) and the price. All it is are fried wonton with the corners of the wonton scrunched together meeting at the center. Not really impressed. You want good crab rangoon? Go to Mo's kitchen on 159th west in Orland Park. Those large triangular goodnesses are stuffed to the gills.Afterwards, we ordered some dim sum and a few entr\u00e9es. \u00a0We got the Sheng Jian Bao and the Xiao long Bao. For the entr\u00e9es, we ordered the ma po tofu and Singapore rice noodles with chicken. Both of the dimsum dishes were delicious and satisfying. They both came with a small ginger dipping sauce that really enhanced the taste buds and the dishes. I would of wished we ordered these from the start. The ma po tofu was most definitely the saving grace of our dining experience. The flavor was beyond anything to describe. It wasn't too overpowering in spice and heat but it had a nice balance of flavor that left me wanting more after our meal was finished. On a more neutral note, the Singapore rice noodle was ok. It want the best and it wasn't the worst, it was ok. Great texture and hints of curry but it was overall kinda bland. There was nothing that really grabbed me about this dish. next time we will order something else.To conclude our meal, we decide to settle with some dessert. We got an over priced 9.95 for some four measly cheese cup cakes. As good as they were, we will opt out getting these next time. And we also got some rather humbling red bean balls, deep fried and sprinkled with sesame seeds. It was good. Our entire order was served to us pretty quickly.

Seems like just a few slices of garlic placed on top of steamed bok choy.Stir fried duck: very little duck meat but a lot of celery which is good from a nutrition perspective!But in River North, you don't have many choices for Chinese cuisines other than PF Changs and Big Bowl - not that they're really serving Chinese food."], ["Allison H.", "I was looking forward to Lao Sze Chuan give that it's billed as the best Chinese food in the world. They also have lots of vegetarian options. I settled on the Bok Choy and mushrooms. The dish was a bit gloppy and not all that flavorful. It also didn't come with rice--it was an add-on. I did like the hot and sour soup which was vegetarian. The service was glacial. I came on the early side when it wasn't crowded. I was sitting at the bar, so maybe that was part of the slow food service. My entree came before my soup. It was hard to catch the attention of the server. Even though this is a less than glowing review, I would try it again. Maybe it was an off night for service. And I would try something of the best seller or chef's specialty menu, not just the plain veggie menu. The food did smell amazing."], ["Sunny K.", "I'm not sure I like this half as much as the Lao in Chinatown. Consistency in dish flavors across branches does not seem to be Lao's strong suit, nor is branding. This branch sticks out like a sore thumb against the others because of how much it blatantly diverged from the original Lao Sze Chuan, an authentic szechuan experience. The only redeeming factor is the duck, which they only serve at this location. PRO- Location- Size of venue. It is humongous and much snazzier than Lao in either Chinatown or Evanston. Whether it's nicer, I'm unsure.CONS- Why is the tea not free? Why are premium teas $7+ ? I don't understand what you're trying to do here.- The Dry Chili Chicken, which I've gotten 4+ times at this location, is NOT spicy.- Mapo Tofu also not spicy. Are you watering down dishes at this location because nothing tastes the same- Xiao Long Bao is alright, not soupy at all, lukewarm at times- Why is no one ever at the desk at the ground floor Lao entrance? And then I get out of the elevator on the 4th floor, and no one is at that desk either. Usually I kind of wander around the restaurant to find someone who works there, who tells me to \"talk to that woman over there\" in order to get seated. - All the maitre'ds at this location are aloof Eastern European women who operate very slowly. This is less a comment on their ethnicity and rather a comment on whether they're right for the restaurant. At other Lao Sze Chuan locations, not only is the maitre'd and staff all Chinese, but they have a thorough understanding of the menu, expected level of service & speed, et cetera.- More expensive. Again, what am I paying for here?2/5 stars, because I very much believe a great restaurant deserves praise only when it consistently delivers on quality, taste, service, rather than flashy modern decor."], ["Gloria Z.", "This is the best Chinese cuisine in US!

There were an average number of people and we were seated immediately. Our server came up and took our order as usual. We ordered the Five Powder Beef, Double Cooked Pork and the Chef Special Dry Chili Ribs. The beef came pretty fast, and then, the server gave us TWO plates of the dry chili ribs ... remember there are just two of us, and it would be highly irrational for us to order two of the same dish. Anyways, I told the server than he might've gotten the order wrong. He took out the piece of paper that he used to take our order, with at least five other tables orders on them, and pointed at us that he indeed wrote down the same dish name twice. He then proceeded to leave the plate on our table with \"you ordered this\" ... Just as I was becoming angry at his attitude, the table beside us said that they ordered the dish and so they could take it. Now I think about it, they placed their order right after we did, so the server must have put their order down as ours. Anyways, the server gave our extra dish to the other table and everything's good again.After 30 minutes, we finished our two dishes but our last dish still have not shown up. I asked another server to check on it, and finally, he brought it back to us within 5 minutes. Clearly that the server that took our order did not write down our order properly.When we got our bill, the magical thing happened. The server told us that \"tip recommendation is at the bottom\", and we were like \"okay sure whatever\", and then he added \"it's 8 dollars\". We were speechless. No way we'd tip 20% for that kind of service.Food:Beyond mediocre, worse than the Chinatown location. Rib's too breaded, with very little actual meat. Five Powder Beef is just beef on worcestershire sauce, very salty and no \"smell\" that I expected from an authentic five powder. The Double Cooked Pork is okay-ish, but still not as flavorful as the Chinatown location. Sze Chuan cuisine is a lot more than just spiciness, there's the smell, the irresistible feel, that I simply did not get from the dishes I ordered.Overall, I'll just go to the Chinatown location if I ever crave for authentic Sze Chuan food in the future."], ["Priya N.", "This is my go to for Chinese.

When I want Chinese food, I'm looking for dirty, cheap, potentially health-code violating places located at the bottom of apt. complexes in Chinatown. Places where there is a limited command of English but an unlimited depth of flavor. Places that are served by Asians, serving primarily only other Asians. Lao Sze Chuan, being located on the upscale Magnificent Mile, violates all of these tenets of Chinese Food. That said, the food is actually pretty damn good.Came here with my family and ordered Duck Soup and Xiao Long Bao as our appetizers, and Then 4 Entrees(Peapod Leaves w/Garlic, Dry Chili Chicken, Chairman Mao Pork, Sole Filet w/Chili Bean Sauce). The Duck Soup and the Xiao Long Bao were tasty, but the latter were very small and probably not a great value($9 for 8 small dumplings). As far as the entrees went, my family agreed that there were no strikes here; every entr\u00e9e hit the spot and all the meat dishes were served with generous portions. Our favorite dishes were actually the Chairman Mao Pork and the Sole Filet w/Chili Bean sauce, which were both wet dishes with a plentiful amount of either perfectly tender braised pork, or slightly crispy fish tossed in a balanced sweet and spicy sauce. The Peapod leaves were cooked well, but they were out of season so they were more chewy than we would have liked(Not the restaurants fault). One downside: you have to pay for rice so to accompany your entrees expect another $1 per cup.Hits: Any of our entrees. To be fair, we stuck exclusively to the 'customer top #20' menuMiss: The Duck Soup and Xiao Long BaoYou have to understand coming here that you're paying a premium for location and d\u00e9cor, as the Chinese food here is a 20% or so more expensive than comparable places. \u00a0However all the dishes they make are authentic and expertly flavored, and you'd be hard pressed to find a better Chinese Restaurant in Chicago outside of Chinatown. \u00a0And it is quite nice; Lao Sze Chuan is a great compromise for a formal(and by that I mean not completely grungy and casual) dinner with solid service in a nice locale, without sacrificing culinary authenticity.

All of these are small issues, but what started deducting stars started when people who ordered 10 minutes after we did got their food 10 minutes before we did. Next, by the time we got our food two of the dishes (cumin lamb and the stir fry green beans) were lukewarm. Next, they charge $1 for each bowl of rice (refills are free) which I think is ridiculous. Also, servers came to our table twice with dishes asking if we ordered it...I don't think any restaurant should make that mistake. Finally the main reason why I'm giving this place just one star was because I found hair in the third dish we ordered, which was fish fillet and tofu. The hair was actually wrapped in pieces of tofu, stringing the tofu pieces together.

I've been to this location TWICE to give the service a second chance but they blew it off.Food:To be quite honest, some of the food was great. I had the eggplant and string beans were wonderful. We also ordered a whole Peking duck and a chef came out with a cart \u00a0to slice the duck. Here is where the problem starts. He slices the duck so thinly that when you wrap the duck in the pancake with cucumber and scallions, you aren't able to taste the duck. There is no duck flavor but \u00a0you can taste the oil in your mouth. I've had better duck around the Michigan avenue area for a much cheaper price and better tasting duck. $88 is a ridiculous price for the amount that he cut from the duck we saw.The second time we went we ordered their \"number 1\" dish chicken with chili pepper. When we actually received the dish - instead of chicken being the main focus all I saw was dried chili peppers. 3/4 of the dish was chili peppers and 1/4 of it was chicken. I can't understand how and why that would be ranked the number 1 dish on the menu.Service:I'm not a picky person - I don't need the servers to give me a lot of attention. If they know what is on the menu and not sound or look confused when taking my order - I'm happy. \u00a0However, our server looked and sounded confused and never came by the table at all other than to take our order. There was no one to fill waters and it was not even busy.The first time we ordered a bottle of Pinot Grigio and the server came by the table with a bottle of Pinot noir. She opened up the bottle and proceeded to pour it into our glasses. My friend thought she said Pinot noir and even apologized saying that she wanted Pinot Grigio and not Pinot noir. The server told us that we did order the Pinot Grigio. Then she stopped pouring and looked at us very confused before apologizing and taking the glasses out. She told us that the bartender gave her the wrong bottle. As a server - isn't it your responsibility to check if the wine was correct? If you didn't have the time to check, do you not know that Pinot Grigio and Pinot noir are two different grape varieties? One is a white wine and one is a red wine. Either the server doesn't know the difference between wines which means the restaurant doesn't train its staff members OR she wasn't paying attention/care that she was serving wine to people. We didn't make a big commotion about it and proceeded through our dinner with the horrible Peking duck and all and asked for the check. . We weren't offered rice - she had 5 bowls of rice brought to the table with the food. She charged us $1 per bowl. If I asked for the rice and I was charged I don't think I would've been as upset as I was. You would think that at a CHINESE restaurant RICE would come WITH the food. \u00a0I'm not asking for 5 star service - I just want to receive what I asked for. Some of us weren't done with our wine and she took our glasses from us before bringing us our check. Our bill was $296.45 they charged us 21% gratuity for 5 people. It's my first time being charged 21%. Usually it's like 18% max for 6 people and we were surprised but we didn't say anything about it. The five of us put down our credit cards and asked to split the check. The server charged our credit cards $60 each. The last time I checked 60 x 5 = 300 and 300 does not equal to the 296.45 that was our total. $3.55 is not that much money but it doesn't change the fact that we were overcharged. Whether we tip or not on top of the service charge is our choice, the fact that she overcharged us does not change regardless of the amount. \u00a0296.45/5 = 59.29 not 60. My friends and I work as servers as well and we understand that sometimes things happen and maybe we were being harsh on her so we decided not to complain and left.So we gave it a second chance and went back. The second time I went it was four people so our server didn't service charge us. We didn't order wine so she couldn't mess up our order again. This time she actually offered us rice and we rejected the offer so she wasn't able to charge us for that either. The server came by asking about satisfaction after she recommended a dish and someone came by to refill water and clear the table. So we thought that it was an improvement. However when we asked for the check again . . . our bill was 95.85. We put down 4 credit cards and were charged $24 each. 24 x 4 = 96. Again - it's not a large amount but the fact that we were overcharged does not change. \u00a095.85/4 = to about 23.96. \u00a023.96 x 4 = 95.84. IF they really cared about the extra penny - she could've charged one of us a extra penny.

Everything was really tasty and had it's own unique flavor. You really can't go wrong at any one of Tony's restaurants. It's a solid establishment and I do feel fortunate that our service was better than most others seemed to have experience. Prices are reasonable, and there are very few really good Chinese restaurants downtown and am glad this spot is here."], ["Stafford M.", "This is one of those places that, had I checked Yelp beforehand, I would not have gone.

The names are a mouthful and seemingly harmless but most of the dishes are drenched in hot oil and chili peppers just the way Sichuan cuisine should be. Just fill your bowls up with lots of rice and soak up that oil. It will be an extremely spicy and flavorful meal, so be sure to have a full glass of water ready by your side. If you have a huge party, be sure to call in advance so they can rearrange a few tables for you. Also, the free garage parking doesn't begin until 5PM.

I've never had more fantastic Sichuanese food in my life. Mind you, my experience is somewhat limited, even living where I do, so coming here was not only a surprise but now a favorite place--and I only tried two dishes!I had to try the Bon Bon chicken; slim strips of chicken in a vinegary, spicy sauce with green onions. This dish straight up boxed with my taste buds, and I enjoyed the beat down. I tried to order the Tiger Skin Pepper Dish: peppers in a black vinegar sauce. It sounded like it had hurt written all over it...and I wanted it.Sadly, the sweet man returned to my table and said that they were out of peppers, so I had to find something else. I'm glad I did, because the second dish was my FAVORITE of the two. For some reason, it's called \"Heartbreaking Rice Jelly\"?Maybe because it's so spicy, oily, oniony, vinegary, peppery yet strangely cooling with the cilantro that you don't want the taste sensation to end. I slurped up the gelatinous rice noodles (like a clear udon noodle) with such enthusiasm, the noodles flung spicy oil all over the white butcher paper carefully set over each table. Smartly.I love hot food, and Chengdu showed me who's boss (note: it wasn't me.) I'm definitely coming back.

I usually go with my boyfriend and the dilemma we usually face is not having enough people to order the 10 or so dishes that are whetting our appetites. Start with the garlic pork on the appetizer menu. It is REALLY good if you like garlic, pork belly, a savory but slightly sweet chili, soy, and Chinese vinegar sauce. And best part, it is $6.95, but is enough to be an entree portion. Cumin lamb is also great, but I think it is prepared inconsistently from time to time. Sometimes it is breaded, other times it is sauteed. What? Want some greens? Get the pea leaves in garlic. Why isn't this 5 stars? The A/C is rarely turned on and it's the middle of summer!

Rangoon was fine, while he said the egg rolls and beef with broccoli were very good.I had hot & sour soup, scallion pancake, and the dry chicken chili. The soup was good, although a few too many water chestnuts for my liking. The scallion pancake was different. Instead of being doughy, it was flaky like a pastry. I would have been okay with this, but it didn't have many scallions and scallion flavor for that matter. Also, instead of a light soy sauce that it's usually served with, it came with a duck oyster type sauce, which I enjoyed but was just unusual. I enjoyed the dry chili chicken, although it could have been spicier, but it definitely sufficed my spicy fix. I was pleased to see that the chicken was lightly breaded and fried and not too heavy. It was cooked perfectly, with plentiful dry chilies, ginger, and garlic. Our two entrees came with two white rices, which is traditional.Prices are about right. Of course could be a couple dollars cheaper per main dish, but this is LP, and even some places in Chinatown charge the same prices as this place.Can't wait to try more dishes and actually dine-in.

The food you would find here is typical of any restaurant in Chinatown. \u00a0Sorry I didn't post a lot of pictures on the food. \u00a0I was too distracted by hunger that by the time I realized I hadn't taken any pictures of food, only half of the food we ordered remained! \u00a0At any Chinese restaurant, I usually order the same thing so I can compare one restaurants food quality from the other. \u00a0In this case, I ordered my fave: Beef with Chinese broccoli and stir fry egg noodles and a small bowl of egg drop with mushroom soup. \u00a0In all honesty, the taste of both dishes were average. \u00a0I guess I expected more from this place with regards to flavor. \u00a0When you've visited Chinatown several times over the course of many years, its becomes rather difficult to compare one food from the other since everything starts to taste similar to each other in dish presentation and quality. \u00a0So MingHin I will have to give you a generous 4 stars for your restaurant. Until then, I'm still on the hunt to find an Eden of Chinese cuisine...."], ["Liz H.", "Being from Houston (where there's an endless amount of amazing Asian food), I've been skeptical about getting dim sum in Chicago. Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised at Minghin. It's not the best dim sum I've ever had, but it is tasty and manages to satisfy any cravings I might have of home. My only issue with this place is that they do not readily give you chili oil (which is actually some of the best oil I've had) and soy sauce for your meal. I had to ask for it a few times before it was given to me, and I find it odd to eat dim sum without it. I've never been anywhere that doesn't serve these items with their dim sum, but be sure to ask them for it!!"], ["Christina C.", "This place is awesome for dim sum or a nice meal.

We ordered shrimp dumplings, shrimp crepes, meat crepes, BBQ steamed bun, lotus root and pork, and so many more.The waiters aren't the most responsive or helpful.

The best plates on our table were the pot stickers, the pork buns, and the mango pudding.

We picked this restaurant because of extensive reviews on the food.We ordered the typical dim sum items: shrimp dumplings, sticky rice in lotus leaf, roasted pork crepes, egg yolk buns, Malay sponge cake (my favorite), etc. I have to say they were all very delicious. One way you can tell if a restaurant has good dim sum is their shrimp dumplings. The shrimp has to be fresh and a bit chunky, mixed with minced pork. Also, the wrap has to be thin to point it's translucent and lets you see through inside. Each dumpling needs to have a good amount of shrimp (but not too much pork), so you can have a good taste of the fresh shrimp. MingHin's shrimp dumplings did pass the test. All the other items we ordered were very delicious. The oolong tea we ordered was also fresh and aromatic with a distinct taste of black tea. The service was very good, better than what you find in a typical Chinese restaurant. All the servers were very patient and friendly.

For context, I will rarely eat it in my hometown of Seattle because it's just not good, but I'll make the trip up to Richmond, BC to get my grub on. MingHin's dim sum completely blew me away and is on par with the Richmond establishments I frequent. While located in Chinatown, the restaurant is clean and nicely decorated (chandeliers!). One of my biggest pet peeves is how dirty and smelly Chinese restaurants typically are. There's nothing worse than sitting in a stained or sticky seat with sticky chopsticks, and dishes that have a layer of film on them. MingHin had none of that.While there was only two of us dining, we made the most of it with:Pan fried green chive cakeBBQ pork bunCrispy pork bellyYu choyPork rice noodle roll in xo sauceBaked egg yolk bunThe food was excellent and the baked egg yolk bun and crispy pork belly were SO good, we ordered extras to go and flew back to Seattle with them!Bottom line: I wish MingHin was in my backyard."], ["Basil D.", "This is a marvelous place for delivery.I've never been to the location, but suffice to say, this is the real deal. \u00a0I'd like to take a month or so to just work my way through the menu. \u00a0Their Peking Duck is marvelous, and frankly, you get quite a bit of food for your money which is unusual for duck dishes. \u00a0The duck is as expected, delicious, crispy duck with not much fat. \u00a0The skin is delicious. \u00a0They serve it on bao rather than pancakes which is a sweeter bread and certainly fills one up more. \u00a0Another duck dish served with rice accompanies it, so there's easily enough food for two. \u00a0The shrimp balls are a fantastic appetizer. \u00a0The bad news is there are four for $6. \u00a0The good news is there are four for $6! \u00a0I'm always suspicious when seafood seems incredibly inexpensive I worry it's not fresh or simply just bad food. \u00a0These little fried shrimp balls were better than expected!

Other sauce for this dish often has a very chemical aftertaste for some reason. \u00a0This does not. \u00a0It's excellent. \u00a0The chicken pieces are cut in to perfect sizes to pick up and eat, rather than stuff a huge chicken piece in your mouth and attempt to chew it, or cut it with a fork first. \u00a0They are cut smaller and longer, yet the breading doesn't overpower the taste of the chicken.They have an expansive menu including chicken feet etc...authentic cuisine. \u00a0Be adventerous! \u00a0I promise to be with my next order.This is the only place I order Chinese delivery.Here endeth the lesson..."], ["D R.", "This is a much deserved review.

We were presented with a color DimSum menu with pictures and color codes to help with ordering. There are probably 60 items you can order from the dim sum menu. Everything looked great. \u00a0Every dish was fabulous!"], ["Louise M.", "I had been to Ming Hin more than I could count with fingers on two hands. To me, it is one of the best Chinese restaurants in Chicago, and it could also be one of the best anywhere in the US (according to me). I guess I kinda spoiled my whole review as it would be glowing all the way through.First time for me was back in 2011 when I was invited for Chinese New Year dinner and we had a feast fit for the emperor of China! I didn't even realize then it was the Ming Hin people were talking about. Yes, they were the talk of the town for awhile. It was simply awesome food you dreamed your mom would cook except these are actually better than mom's. Don't tell her that. It's only because the foods here were just more elaborate. However, my fave thing to come here for is dim sum.By the way, dim sum or yum cha is a Chinese meal consists of small plates of food served in a bamboo circular steam container, usually consumed in the morning but can be eaten anytime of the day. Yum cha actually means to drink tea as that is what we do when eating dim sum, you drink tea with it. In China, people young and old go for dim sum, and they talk for hours over tea. Some quietly sip tea and read newspaper. In America, we just gobble it up and order more! In a typical Dim Sum place, there will be carts being pushed with these offerings on it, and when the cart passes you, you can take a look of what they have on the cart. Then you order what you want. The cart pusher will then mark your tab with what you took for your bill to pay later.When I went here for dim sum, we always had big parties of six to ten people. \u00a0It was a perfect size for a round ten top table and it also meant that we could order a great variety of foods. Going with a small party is not as fun as you could only order so much as you will get full rather fast. Then, you will get jealous of the big table next to you when they fill up their lazy Susan. Every other thing will look even better than what you just ordered.We always order quite a bit of stuff: shumai which is a pork and shrimp steamed dumpling, harkau which is a shrimp dumpling wrapped in rice paper, tofu skins stuffed with with bamboo shoots, BBQ pork belly, chong fun (flat thick noodle stuffed with meat or shrimps), several different kinds of congee (rice porridge, the abalone and chicken congee is da shit), Malaysian steamed cake, egg custard pastry, BBQ pork buns, Bean stuffed buns, BBQ Pork Belly, and the Pineapple cake.Most of my Chicago friend think that Ming Hin has the better dim sum than the others dim sum joints in Chicago Chinatown. I happened to agree. The pineapple buns and the crispy pork belly are exceptionally delicious. The pork belly had a very crispy crunchy skin, and it just crunched in your mouth as the inside of your mouth is coated with the fat from the belly part. It's definitely not a health food, but damn good piggy foodgasm once in awhile. The pineapple bun, now I had the misconception thinking it is bun stuffed with some type of pineapple jam. I love pineapple jam and \u00a0I'm also a big fan of pineapple tarts, nastar, and the sort. But no....no buns stuffed with pineapple jam here at Ming Hin. Turned out, pineapple bun was a bun filled with this thick runny yummy filling made with sweetened egg yolk that was so decadent and rich beyond belief. It's called \"pineapple bun\" because the top of the bun resembles a pineapple because of the sweet streusel like topping on it. Oh, it's just so delicious. I crave this pineapple bun often enough and it would trigger a road trip to Chicago.Ming Hin to me is just a more upscale and clean compared to the neighboring dim sum places like Phoenix and Triple Crown. The place is modern and new with no sticky table tops and nicely decorated. They offer private rooms, and their foods just scream quality and finesse. Yet, there's no cart here for dim sum. I actually don't mind the no cart style. In the past, I had a hard time waiting for the right cart to pass my table. You ended up waiting or you had to order what you wanted to the waiter anyway. At Ming Hin, they gave you an order form with colored pictures. You just write down how many you want next to each picture. Simple.I talked a lot about their dim sum - it sure is a must try. However, their lunch and dinner menu are also exceptional filled with tons of seafood selections. I just never had a bad meal here. Call ahead and make reservation. Their dim sum line is insane on the weekends. They expanded that restaurant so much and they're a huge establishment now. Good for them. As long as they keep up the quality, I will keep coming!"], ["C.C. H.", "I've been hearing good things about Minghin for a few years now and finally made it over there for late-night dim sum.

The egg custard and spring rolls were perfect. \u00a0The Shumai was also a hit.Cons: It didn't feel like a dim sum restaurants at times. \u00a0I miss having a jar of chili oil and a bottle of soy sauce and red vinegar at my table. \u00a0Instead, they have a small dish of sriracha and one of hoison sauce. \u00a0My pork ribs with black beans were also a little tough and came with more taro than ribs it felt like."], ["Rosemary T.", "One of the most expensive dim sum place in china town.

We ordered a beef noodle dish, the vegetable buns, turnip cakes, spare ribs in black bean sauce, shrimp in crepe wrappers and fried donuts in crepe wrappers. What I did like: the turnip cakes (great texture, although a little lacking in fillings) and fried donuts in crepe wrappers (still crunchy!), spare ribs (sweet, with good flavor). What I didn't like: the beef noodle dish we got was definitely underflavored and undersalted, and the wrapper to shrimp proportion was way in favor of crepe (obviously not ideal). Overall, I think this is good for dim sum in Chicago, but (not to sound like a snob), definitely not as good as dim sum I've had elsewhere. Service was prompt and friendly."], ["Mykaila D.", "Definitely had some favorites. This place is crowded, brace yourself.

New York needs to get on your game! However the food is not up to par. The dim sum was overall meh compared to what I've had in NYC, HK, SF and CN. I know dim sum in America will never be as good as Asia but I expected it to be on par with East and West coast. I ended up leaving with disappointment. The texture of the food was either off or the flavors were bland. I admit they have a better ordering system. They give you a menu where you tick off how many of each dish you want and then they ring it up and check it off the list as each one arrives. I like this system better than having to flag down old ladies with push carts. The photos on the menu also helps because it gives you an idea of what you're going to get so you don't end up with an unpleasant surprise when your food arrives (happened a few times to me when I decide to be adventurous). The system and layout works, the prices are okay just the chefs need to step their game up.

It was fantastic. Actually, it's the best we have had in Chicago's Chinatown.Their dim sum was delicious and the hot sour soup left you craving for more. The shrimp dumplings were generous. The potstickers had a thick dough and were a bit oily though. Their steamed pork buns were classic, medium-sized and tasty.Their rice noodles in my beef & noodle dish were overdone and clumped, but the flavors compensated for the texture. The beef was tender, tasty and not fatty.I'll admit, we are unaccustomed to eating the exotic seafood or things like deep fried pigeon or Australian abalone, so I'll admit the pictures on the menu were culturally educational for us. I'm thankful because the 11 year old would have freaked out if it arrived at the table as pictured - plucked, skin-on, with a face.

The menu has awesome pictures, which I appreciated. For me, I don't know a lot of Chinese dishes, so the pictures were very helpful.I ordered the salt and pepper shrimp. I love the shell and the head, so I eat all of it- even the tail. It was so good and crispy. It was delicious. My boyfriend ordered BBQ pork tenderloin. It was okay. His dish took awhile to come out and it was warm, but not steaming hot. I liked the taste, but there were times where you were biting into straight fat. I wasn't a huge fan of that.

My first impression was MingHin has a contemporary feel and that is very different that the other restaurants in China Town. The dim sum are not ordered from carts wheeled by but you order them off a paper with pictures. My kids and I do prefer the carts because they add an element of fun but can make you wait longer for what you really want. After ordering the first round of dim sum came out fairly quick and additional plates came after. Everything tasted fantastic and we all enjoyed the atmosphere. In addition to the dim sum is a full menu that we ordered a few items from. The menu is huge and has everything you can imagine. When we left there was a crowd of parties outside of MingHin each waiting for their names to be call to be seated.

Ingredients were fresh, but the veggie dumplings, veggie noodles, and veggie spring rolls were greasy. (And, yes, I understand frying occurs in oil. ;) ) The spring rolls were chewy and just slicked in oil; even an oven reheat the next day didn't improve the sogginess. \u00a0Aside from that, I wasn't wowed by any flavors; I felt like I needed sauce for everything.Service was poor - we had to flag down our guy, as he never came back. We ran out of hot tea, and it took forever for our check to be rung out (and not by our original guy, either).The $47 pre-tip price tag for two (9 items = averages $5.20 per dish) was just too much given the lackluster flavor and preparation.

Got seated upstairs, service was incredibly fast.Their menu is a picture menu which was very helpful! They offered dishes I never seen at any other dim sum place. Food came out quick. Every item was delicious! Only downfall was we ordered the last baked bbq pork buns which was my favorite.Def order baked bbq pork buns, pork belly, shrimp dumpling, and congee!ANDDD cheapest dim sum meal I ever had.

The Service: After reading some of the other recent reviews, I came fully expecting horrible service, but I was pleasantly surprised. Our service was excellent. We ordered on two occasions, and our food came out pretty quickly both times. When we asked for additional sauce, it was brought promptly to our table. We received a refill on our tea minutes after we indicated the pot was empty. Perhaps it's because we came on the early side of Sunday brunch, but the place was pretty packed at 9am, and we were still checked on regularly. We also were not rushed out the door. We were able to eat leisurely and chat. :)"], ["Michelle R.", "My husband and I went to MingHin on a Saturday afternoon for lunch.

Normally, that'd be enough to turn me off and try another restaurant but the place was swamped, always a good thing, and the smells coming from the kitchen made my mouth water so we decided to stick it out. We were not let down.The food is amazing. It reminded me of the dim sum we had in Hong Kong. We ordered the BBQ bao, shumai, pork bun, sticky rice and the shrimp and chive dumpling. My husband loves shumai and MingHin did not disappoint but the surprise winner of the lunch was the pork bun. It was light and delicate yet meaty at the same time. It was heaven.

Overall decent food, great ambiance and services, however I feel it is still a little bit over priced."], ["Steve A.", "The combination of restful setting, superb food and faultless service make this Chicago's best Chinese restaurant, and one of its top restaurants overall. It's particularly delightful when it's warm enough to eat on the terrace, a surprisingly serene environment considering it's just a half dozen or so floors above Michigan Avenue.We put ourselves in our waiter's hands, and he assembled a delightful multi-course meal for us.We began with an assortment of six pieces of dim sum, individually plated for each of us. This item is not listed on the menu (nor is any form of dim sum sampler) so it is worth asking about. Although I am not a huge dim sum fan, this was clearly the best I have ever had; each was light and flavorful, and even the crab rangoon managed to be delicate and appealing.Next we shared a split serving of hot and sour soup, also the best I've had, with less vinegar and more broth flavor. Plenty of tender lobster chunks made it special.Peking duck is available in a full or half portion, and the half is perfect for sharing as an appetizer. It's served with the traditional cucumber, scallions, pancakes and sauces, but the duck was so perfect we ate most of it by itself. Crispy skin and no layer of fat at all made it among the best duck dishes I've had. Next time I might try the five spice duck to compare it.For entrees we shared scallops in black truffle sauce, and a spicy shrimp dish. Both were good, and were different from anything else we'd had, but I felt the preceding courses were better.Perhaps the highlight of the meal was an amazing red rice dish that I didn't see on the menu. It was vegetarian, and included various nuts, broccoli and other tidbits, and had a rich, mouth-filling flavor that was remarkable. I would definitely ask for this again.Finally we finished with a fruit and sorbet plate. Our waiter added a bit of coconut sorbet, which turned out to be the highlight.A well-conceived wine list offers many selections designed to accompany the food, including a small half bottle section. Wine prices are erratic, with some barely above retail, and others sky high, so careful browsing is required, but will be rewarded.This was a great meal, and I'm sure we will return often to this surprising oasis in the midst of the city."], ["Kelsey M.", "Whenever I go to Chicago, grabbing drinks at the Peninsula Hotel's terrace is a must. Sure, the cocktail menu doesn't have the most variety; however, the calming atmosphere is enough of a reason to stop by. After a long day of traveling or walking around the city, the Shanghai Terrace feels more like a relaxing oasis in a excluded island than a hotel bar. Adorned with canopy seating and lots of foliage, it is a breath of fresh air. As for drinks, the terrace carries your typical cocktails, wines and beers; however, there's nothing crafty or extremely creative about the selection.Additionally, the service is usually fantastic. One time, a waiter randomly gifted me a stuffed bear with the hotel's logo -- a very sweet gesture!"], ["Catherine J.", "There need to be more great chinese restaurants in the midwest, but for now Shanghai terrace will satisfy my chinese food cravings.

Dessert:Asian Pear Tatin - macadamia cake, pineapple cream and mandarin sorbetI didn't finish the dessert either. The sorbet and cake were good, but the pear was very hard to eat. I expected it to be a lot softer in texture.Drinks: Sour Cherry Old Fashion - orange infused makers mark, ginger ale, sweetened cherries and thymeThe drink was too strong for me so I asked my server if the bartender could add more ginger ale.Service:Our server was very friendly and I liked how she explained every dish that came out. \u00a0Ambiance:It's a beautiful restaurant.

The Wagyu beef was good, Kung pao chicken was very average and Happy rice should have been sent back, but wasn't.

Having said that, I was not impressed by the food. The ingredients used in its dishes were not truly Chinese (e.g. button mushrooms in lieu of shitake/dong gu, no true Chinese vegetables were used in the noodles and stir fries - think broccoli instead of bok choy).I would only go back if I were in a bind or were staying in the hotel and didn't want to venture outside beyond the confines of the hotel and expose myself to aggressive Chicago winds."], ["Dee C.", "This is by far my favorite rooftop.

I think we had like 5 waiters serve us and they were all dressed up (men wore suite and tie, women wore cultural red dresses). You have to dress nicely to come here (business casual is fine), do not come in with t-shirt/shorts or street clothes. Make reservations ahead and request to sit on the rooftop. It gets pretty busy at night. There were two of us, and we ordered the CHEAPER stuff on the menu. With appetizer and 2 dishes, we paid $65 including tax. I was unsure on how much to tip because we had so many waiters. However, expect to pay like $100 per person if you order drinks and eat the more famous dishes from this place. I'm not a fan of Ducks, so I didn't bother trying it."], ["Gary N.", "This little gem is hidden inside the Peninsula Hotel. The ambiance and decor very nice lighting not to bright or to low. The wait staff extremely attentive and almost too efficient, i will address this later. Our table ordered dim sum to start out with and for our entr\u00e9es we ordered the Peking Duck for 4,...$72.00,(Ouch) but worth every penny and shanghai fried noodles.The dim sum dishes ordered were veggie spring rolls, fried crab wontons, lobster/chicken dumpling with black truffles. The rolls were ok i would not reorder them again flavor was fair. The fried wontons were crispy and really delightful. The best of these was the dumplings they were indescribably delicious.The peking duck was out of this world the skin was crispy and duck meat was succulent. This was served with the traditional pancakes with a choice of either the plum or the hoisin sauce. Flavors were sublime. The shanghai noodles were a great accompaniment to the duck. All the food was good with several of our choices ranking excellent. For its price point it is a little hit and miss. The service excellent but a little to efficient wait staff literally hovers over you and as soon as you are done the whisk everything away. Its a very off putting.Overall a good dining experience."], ["Katie M.", "The atmosphere is lovely. Being on the terrace is wonderful so don't sit inside! My boyfriend and I were celebrating our anniversary and it was great. We ended up ordering several different dim sum dishes instead of a full meal, and they were all great! If you enjoy rangoons, the fried wonton is your best bet. If you love more potsticker style, order the foie gras and duck. If you like more traditional dumplings, the seafood seiwmai is delicious, and the barbeque bun is fluffy and flavorful. As we paid for our meal, they brought us a small slice of dessert on a beautifully prepared plate and wished us a happy anniversary. Every staff member on our way out did so too. My boyfriend and I intend to spend all our anniversaries from now on here."], ["Tanya K.", "This is a review for the food only, along with a tip. The tip is, if the restaurant tells you that they're completely booked (even for 5 o clock seating, really??), then go to the Pen bar. I've been to a few Pen bars around the world and they're cozy dens full of interesting people. This one serves basically the full Shanghai Terrace menu and the staff is very friendly and helpful.So for the food, I quite like it. I had the vegetable dumplings and the salt and pepper tofu. Both were good. I loved the crunchy salt and pepper tofu. The bartender said it was the only tofu dish he's liked. In the MidWest that's pretty serious ;) The vegetable dumplings were also good. I would have liked a more traditional Chinese dumpling dipping sauce. But they were fine dry. They would have been awesome with the right sauce."], ["EOEater J.", "Having eaten at various Chinese restaurants in California, NYC, and Asia, and upon hearing that the food here is excellent, I had high expectations, especially after seeing the prices. The ambience and decor were quite nice. Service started out well, with several attentive servers catering to our needs. However, as our dinner progressed, we noticed that the servers have disappeared, leaving us to wait for any kind of response for a long time. I also noticed that I was the ONLY Asian patron in an Asian restaurant (which is usually a bad sign, if you want authentic, great food). We started getting antsy and irritated as we just wanted to leave. We had to flag someone down to get our main server to give us our check. Yes, the food was delicious, but severely overpriced. Over $17 for a small serving of fried rice? I mean, sure, there were big chunks of shrimp, but that is uncalled for, even if the restaurant is situated in the Peninsula Hotel. Frankly, I've had better food at hole-in-the wall restaurants elsewhere. The pork buns were tender, but not any better to warrant $10 for two. Will I ever go back? Only if someone else foots the bill. Otherwise, I can get much better, more authentic food and more attentive service elsewhere."], ["Lu Y.", "I'm not quite sure why this place is called Shanghai Terrace since most of the food isn't Shanghai style but rather Cantonese... But it is very yummy, just not for the price (which brought down the rating from 4 stars to 3). \u00a0If you are there for dim sum and are Asian or have been to Chinatown before, the items are severely overpriced for what they are (but do try the interesting foie gras and duck dumplings!). As a result, you would be disappointed so only go if you want exquisitely presented Chinese food at over the top prices.Ambience: \u00a0Definitely romantic with the oriental decorations and dimmed lighting. \u00a0Also, you should dress business casual unless you want to stand out in a tshirt or shorts.Service: \u00a0most of the waiters are from China or Hong Kong and are kind, but our particular waitress seemed to have some issues understanding what we were asking for. \u00a0They also didn't come to our table very often, and we literally had to wave to grab their attention (and this was a Thursday night).Food: \u00a0the cocktails are superb (I highly recommend Ning Sling). \u00a0The dim sum is alright, with Shanghai style soup dumplings that have a ton of flavor it a lack of soup. \u00a0For entrees, I would highly recommend the crispy duck even though it's pricey (compared to the same duck you'd get in Chinatown). \u00a0For dessert, we had mooncakes since it was the Mid Autumn festival - these were some of the best ones I've ever had! \u00a0The fluffy and light pastries were stuffed with a rich, egg custard. \u00a0Mmm mmm mmm!"], ["Jack G.", "After being seated we immediately became excited about all the delicious dim sum we found on the menu. Our server however had other plans and bullied us into ordering some horrible westernized crap covered in mayonnaise. Feel like we missed out on the good stuff :( . Also turned out to be Chinese/American 'Fusion'; We were shocked to receive a fried wanton full of cream cheese. On a positive note the Peking duck was top notch!"], ["Saba A.", "Romantic hit of the day, fine service, beautiful Shanghai inspired decor, a nice go-to day spot. My husband and I decided to come in for cocktails and were seated comfortably with a drink menu, and bar snacks, the best bar snacks I've ever seen. A nice cocktail list, but we ordered our usual favorites, for him a Bacardi and Coke and for me a mojito. We knew the wait was a little long because the bartender did a fine job in creating our drinks and I appreciated that. My mojito had lots of fresh mint leaves, with the sweetness touch of sugar, and a giant lime. It was strong, and for 9.50, it was a great deal. We enjoyed our time together, and all thought it is a romantic spot, I would love to come back for a quiet lunch as the food appeared delicious.My husband got a separate coke bottle with Bacardi poured in a glass. During a busy summer season, this is a nice quiet escape on a rooftop and we're so happy we went. Close to Michigan Ave, it's nice to get away from the crowd and relax."]], "Lao Sze Chuan": [["Max L.", "Place just got shut down because they had roaches in kitchen! Never again!"], ["Sunny K.", "Where to begin talking about Lao Sze Chuan! For starters, I go here EVERY weekend. The servers know me. I also order the same things each time I go, which expedites the process. Going to a restaurant every week does become (relatively) expensive, but here's three dishes as to why Lao is worth it:- Mapo Tofu: The mapo here is fantastic! It's spicy, it's got a lot of tofu, it's warm and oily, it's szechuan. This thrown on fresh rice is my dream dinner. On some days the flavor changes slightly (this last weekend, it was a tiny bit saltier than usual. The weekend before that, it was perfect) but this dish is a consistent winner. I've tried to recreate this flavor at home to utter failure.- Dry Chili Chicken: If fresh, the Dry Chili Chicken is crisp, spicy, and rich. Basically, it's a bunch of wonderful fried chicken pieces thrown in with a lot of chili and other spices.- Garlic Spinach: Spinach in oil and lots of garlic. We started ordering this because we thought \"ah but we can't NOT eat vegetables\" and ended up sticking to it because it's delicious. It complements the other two dishes nicely.I've also tried the Green Beans and the Boiled Szechuan Beef, which are excellent.Some pitfalls:- Depending on the time of day you arrive (especially during weekend dinnertime), it can be impossible to find parking nearby. This can mean wandering around Chinatown for 30 minutes looking for that special person just about to leave as you arrive. This can also mean walking about ten minutes from the parking lot by the train station, which is brutal during Chicago winters.- Also depending on the time of day you arrive, there may be a wait. I've gotten savvy enough that I've never had to wait more than ten minutes. Going during lunchtime helps, because crowds gather for dinner.- There's a special table nearest to the kitchen area that each time I've sat there I had to wait an hour to get my food. Sometimes, their service dwindles. Other times, the food comes out so curiously quick you wonder if they defrosted a batch from last week.- I've read some articles about Lao Sze Chuan having issues with sanitation standards and also with the FBI raiding this branch, which is slightly alarming?!ALL IN ALL I love this restaurant and it really does make my weekend. I love the free tea, the spicy cabbage, the not-overly-friendly attitude of the employees, the inexpensive food. I'd give them 5 stars if not for the service and the sometimes-not-so-fresh food."], ["Rowena N.", "Came here around 1:30-2pm on a weekend, and no line.We had :-Three spiced chicken, which semi-resembled teriyaki chicken - bit hit with our friends. Chicken was tender, sauce was little sweet and salty. Pretty generous portion size.- Fish in hot pot with spicy oil- my friends love spicy food so they finished this up easily. It came with cabbage in the oil as well. If you haven't had this before it is like a small pot with sliced fish and braised cabbage drenched in the hot chili oil. As expected this is hot hot hot (both in temperature and spiciness). - Eggplant in garlic sauce- this is legit my favorite dish of all time. They saut\u00e9ed it perfectly. It has a nice sweetness to it, and heat. It is mildly spicy. Def recommend.- Steamed soup buns- Pretty good. These are like tiny buns filled with pork meat and some soup coming from the meat/chives/other veggies in the filling. I felt there are other places with better version but these were okay. Nothing too bad, nothing too memorable. -Chicken fried rice- Pretty generous with amount of chicken included. My friend got this as his \"safety\" dish in case he did not like any entrees. It was average, although I am not sure who can make chicken fried rice that much more spectacular.- Pork kidney saute- this was our \"adventurous\" dish. I did not know pork kidney smells but yes it does. The taste is not bad, but for those of you with strong sense of smell, this probably isn't for you. It is saut\u00e9ed with slices of bamboo shoots and mix of greens. Half of us liked it, half of us did not touch it.Service was pretty good. Ambience is bit peculiar. Throughout our meal we were watching a man (who either is manager or owner) with thick gold chains greet customers loudly and guarding the door...Overall, I'd recommend the food there. We came with relatives from China before and they feel it is pretty authentic, so I take their word for it. For those who love spicy food, you will leave this place with your mouth numbed in a very good way."], ["Will K.", "The food was great. The crispy chicken with red chilies was very spicy, coming from a person who loves spicy food. Would be 5 stars, but the service was subpar.

They have so many selections on their menu and although I tend to stick to my tried and true classics, I always see people ordering up the most interesting and delicious looking dishes!!I probably eat here at least once a month, I start off with the deliciously saucy and spicy ma po tofu, I highly recommend this- it's a crowd pleaser- even if you think you're not a fan of tofu, eating this on top of some white rice is delicious!!!They're known for their Sichuan spice so I like to get the three chilli chicken which is scary because of the peppers but so delicious! The three pot chicken is so flavorful and tender, I think this is another favorite (of mine at least lol). Today we also got the Orange beef tenderloin which was so deliciously crispy and amazingly flavored. They were really busy so they gave us two additional white rices for free! I don't know what other way to say it- I love this place"], ["Sarah S.", "If you like your Chinese food spicy, Lao Sze Chuan may be your ideal Chinatown restaurant. Come in non-peak hours to avoid the wait which can climb to very high numbers early in the evening. Our server was a very friendly lady and we had much better service than I'm used to in Chinatown.Chef's Special Pork with Sizzling Crispy Rice $12.45 -This pork is in a very light sweet and sour sauce. It was a great sweet & sour sauce that was a refreshing change because it wasn't heavy at all. The pork was not deep fried either which leaves you feeling like you've eaten something semi-healthy. Getting the dish is kind of cool because they pour the hot soup over the crispy rice making for a sizzling mixture right before your eyes. It ends up being like a soup but personally I still put it over regular white rice to cut the sweetness a bit.Orange Chicken $12.45 - I found the orange chicken not to be very flavorful though I did taste the orange a bit. This dish had some of the best chicken I've ever had at a Chinese joint. It was perfectly deep fried with the right amount of crisping to it, great crunch without drying out the chicken at all - completely moist protein. Overall I thought it was quite a delicious dish but would probably skip it next time just to try something new in hopes of getting a bit more flavor.Spicy Pork Intestine $11.45 -Personally, I liked the small crispy pieces the best. The bigger pork intestine pieces were a bit more chewy so I was happier avoiding those pieces. I really enjoyed the flavor in this dish and if you can stomach intestine, it's worth a try.Chef's Special Diced Beef with Tofu $13.45 -My least favorite of the bunch. I found this dish to be a bit bland. There was quite a bit of tofu at the bottom and a lot of diced beef (of course) in a soup type of sauce. This dish was just fine but it didn't really jump out at me.Steamed rice is $1 extra per bowl.Overall, I'm glad I finally made it into Lao Sze Chuan - I've eaten at just about everywhere else in Chinatown! It's definitely worth a stop, however with the hit or miss dishes and slightly more expensive prices, I will probably opt for other Chinatown spots in the future."], ["Shuo F.", "This place is as authentic as it gets for Sichuan food!

I don't think tier service is so bad that they deserve a 1 star. We normally wait a little bit before we would get our water refilled, but it's definitely not that bad.

We went on a midweek evening and they weren't crowded at all which we thought was odd being that this place was very popular (maybe the recent FBI raids scared patrons?)

They were loud and obnoxious. We almost opted to change our order to takeout. I was tired and hungry so we stayed and tried to make the best of it. Our appetizers took 20 minutes to get to us and the entrees another 45 on top of that. So over an hour to get our meal in a restaurant with maybe 4 other couples. Perhaps this was because there was a table of literally 8 employees laughing and carrying on and OF COURSE they had their food. If the owner so chooses to respond to this review, I will gladly post the photos. They had one young lady working the floor serving dishes and waiting tables. When the food finally got out to us, shocker, it wasn't even hot. The flavor was there and we both felt that had it not sat around it probably would've been really good. Such a shame.

Give this place a try and get some of the dimsum and appetizer dishes to see what I'm talking about.Smoked pork rollStir fried lamb with cuminSzechuan stir fried string beans (yeah, you find this elsewhere too but it is especially good here)The cucumber pickled dish (forget the name)Not your standard Chinatown faire. Really good! You can order from them on Grubhub too, an extra plus. And they serve fresh soy milk here too!"], ["Chaos M.", "Good Northeastern\u00a0Chinese food.Try this if you already have lot of Sichuan style Chinese food."], ["Adam K.", "Was down in Chinatown doing work for some Triads and celebrating the Chinese new Year, Eds Potsticker house was crazy packed like a bowl full of potstickers so I wandered down the street smoking Marlboro menthol lights until I happened upon this place.My child paused to zip up her coat and a couple got in the door ahead of us, they took the last table open. Then they ordered a coke, and a water, and got up and left. They made us stand up for like 20 minutes for no reason. Such prickles. Anyway.What an interesting little place, worth a stop in if you are in the neighborhood and looking for some authentic Chinese food. Its a small little place that has a lot of actual Chinese people in it. Enjoyed immensely the variety of choices that are available, the fish was a little fishy tasting for me, but the nice caucasian couple who left so we could sit down in this small restaurant gave us the rest of their bottle of wine. I asked what was good here and they said this was their first time but they really liked the cabbage and pork soup but warned how sour it was. Sounded a bit much for the first time so I got:Celery & Pork Dumplings: this was on the special new years menu, way good and tasty, loved the dipping hoisin sauce. It wasn't hoisin I dont think but it was awesome and sour.Hot & Sour soup - highlight of the meal, best thing ever. Warmed my black soul. Pancake & Mackrel - the lady told me this was awesome, and it was on the specials menu for CNY, taste was superb. Very good, but so filling I took like 3 bites and that was it. Spicy fish - forgot what this is acutally called, but it was spicy and good, again 3 bites and I was out. Nice place, may return if I am in the hood and Boss Chan wants me to go to war with the Flying Red Scorpions again."], ["Josh P.", "I used to have to travel to Chinatown for grub like this, but now I don't even have to leave Bridgeport. This is a great BYOB that doesn't hurt the pocketbook. It looks like the Michelin Guide just recognized them for their chili-centric menu. Our favorites are usually the cumin lamb. I've also had some delicious squid there too."]], "Go 4 Food": [], "Lao Hunan": [["Xiaoxi L.", "I ordered takeout when my usual Chinatown spot was closed for remodeling. It was an empty night for the restaurant and my order was quickly ready. Am I ever glad I discovered this spot. I think I may have found my new regular takeout spot. I got lucky with my order and was transported back to my childhood. This was the most delicious beef brisket noodle soup I've found so far in Chicago. I'm no seasoned foodie, but have tried quite a few places in and out of Chinatown. The broth was perfect, not too spicy that I did not find myself distracted by huffing to cool down my tongue. The noodles were tasty and just firm and chewy enough. I was not disappointed. It reminded me of the kiosk on my street when I lived in Harbing and ate beef noodle soup every weekend. I also ordered the spicy wood ear salad and chili beef tendon appetizers. Both were perfectly flavored and delicious. My hunny ordered kung pao chicken and vegetable fried rice as he usually does from any Chinese restaurant we visit. He prefers the kung pao from our usual spot in Chinatown, but Lao Hunan's was a close second. I suppose from this one experience, I could say they score much higher on the authentic Chinese side of the menu. I can't wait t come back and try some more items from the menu. They have a great variety of meats and veggies I don't see often offered at other Chinese places. Thanks for a quick trip down memory lane. I'll be back to do it again soon."], ["Maria L.", "My new favorite restaurant in Chinatown (I'm Chinese, I'm legit). What a quirky place with the political figures on the wall and Communist uniforms, but thats beside the point. The FOOD, wow!I've been a handful of times now and have to say the flavors at Lao Hunan are out of this world tasty. Just imagine the flavor combos of spicy, sweet, vinegary all fused into one delicious bite after another. My favorite items and must-tries are their fried dishes, they really do a perfect fry. Try the dry chili fried fish and the hunan style fried eggplant, SPECTACULAR! Also highly notable mentions are the Mao style pork belly, the Hunan style peppers, stinky tofu (if you're into that), Hunan style chicken dishes, and the whole fried sweet and sour fish. Go in to Lao Hunan with an open mind/mouth/stomach and try all the authentic dishes, you won't be sorry!

But what really stands out here is the combination of affordable pricing, huge helpings of food, super fast service and incredible level of spice.For example, my husband and I are willing to bear through a little burn to get through a bowl of the \"Famous Hunan Chili in Black Bean Sauce.\" I usually give in and mix it with rice, but the hubby actually has a higher tolerance for spice than me and eats it straight up. We've had other items off the menu from the chicken, beef and veggie sections that mostly tend to have that traditional spicy flavor and strong aroma."], ["Peter Y.", "Let me preface this by saying that I was born and raised in Hunan, and had Hunanese food for the past 21 years of my life. I go back to China every other summer, and the most consistent thing I do is probably eat like 5 times a day. I eat, sleep and breathe Hunanese food.So when my friends and I were walking around Chicago's Chinatown, and I saw a sign for my hometown cuisine, I literally dragged them inside with me. The insides were quite nice, with the servers dressed up as communist soldiers. This may seem completely random at first, but Hunan was the home place of Mao, the biggest propagator for Communism ever. Anyways, I got a bit too excited talking about my hometown. Time to move on to the food.I haven't been to many Hunanese restaurants in the States, but I have to say that this was by far the most authentic experience I've had. I mean, when you're getting served authentic cuisine with servers dressed up like communist soldiers, what can go wrong?We went family-style and ordered 4 dishes for the three of us. We had their Spicy Marinated Beef appetizer, Home Fed Chicken Xiang Xi style, Lamb with cumin powder and Sichuan String Beans. The marinated beef was delicious, though a bit too spicy. It wasn't great as an appetizer dish, as it numbed our mouths too much. However, if you're into spicy food, then by all means, get this. The home style chicken tasted exactly something my mom would make, so that got an automatic 5 with me.The lamb was my friend's favorite, deliciously seasoned with generous chunks of meat.The Sichuan string beans were cooked to perfection, doused in a delicious sauce. Oh, and they have free white rice, which is what most places should do, but don't.Anyways, we walked into here extremely hungry, left extremely satisfied, and still had enough left overs for another meal.

The diced chicken was superb--spicy, tender, juicy bits. This is how chicken should be done.Also, service was excellent. Extremely fast (dishes came within 7 minutes of ordering) and the waiters/waitresses were very willing to take photos for us/ talk to us about dishes, etc. Also sold us mooncakes for 5$ (yes it's after the holiday but hey--that much food for 5$ ain't a bad sale).

Great food and super fast delivery! Usually I have to add soy sauce to my fried rice but not with this place. Everything has just the right amount of flavor. Oh if you like Crab Rangoon, definitely order it from here. Best Crab Rangoon in town!"], ["Spencer L.", "This place is great. The food is pretty good for what you're paying for. The main reason I'm giving them 5/5 is because their portions are awesomely huge. So much so that they have to staple the containers shut. There's a guy on here that complained about that and I think that is pretty petty.They have a huge range of food and they get that food done in a decent amount of time. I got delivery and it took about 45 minutes for 3 different entrees. It also came with a pair of reusable chopsticks which I thought was wicked awesome.Finally a go-to Chinese place for me in Logan Square."], ["Eric C.", "Nothing revelatory here, just good, fast, cheap, and consistent Chinese takeout within walking distance of my house. The food is always fresh and tasty, the service fast and friendly, the kitchen clean and bright, and the prices tough to beat."], ["Tom C.", "Another of my favorite fast food Chinese restaurants that I love. Delivery is quick and food tasted amazing. I usually get their egg rolls, pot stickers, and fried rice. With a bigger group I add the orange chicken or beef and broccoli. Could not recommend this place enough if you want quick take out or delivery and have a craving for chinese food."], ["Josh G.", "OK the saying always goes there is no bad pizza. Trust me there is. However I've always thought there really isn't bad Chinese takeout places just OK to really good. This is in the really good category. Having just moved we are a little low on food around the house. Having had a few friends over for drinks on a Sunday afternoon I was feeling a little tipsy and needed some sustenance like now. So, I thought I would walk the few blocks to Dante's my pizza slice dispensary of choice in the area. However while walking down Armitage I saw this place and was like CHINESE FOOD! Stopped in ordered a large sweet and sour chicken to go. What surprised me in a good way is the quality of the chicken used. WHITE MEAT! Noticed that right away. The only complaint I have was the container of sauce they gave me, it was bigger than the rice container and as full as the one with chicken.... Seemed a little heavy handed. Won't keep me from coming back because it was really good for a cheap price."], ["Kristen P.", "Great portions, inexpensive, perfect Chinese food (albeit Americanized) and super friendly staff."]], "Emperor's Choice Restaurant": [["Herschel S.", "When my cousin from Taiwan came to visit, I had to rack my brain as to what food would be good for him to try. I suggested maybe we can try American Chinese food to which he responded with \"Huh? What's that?\" And so I embarked on a journey to find what would be a good American Chinese restaurant for me to take out for him to try. I ended up here at this restaurant because it was closest to me at that point in time.I got the orange peel chicken, kung po chicken, and black pepper beef. I absolutely love the orange peel chicken. It's not as sweet like how most restaurants make it. You can really taste the orange when eating this dish. The kung po chicken and black pepper beef are also very good. All these dishes were a hit with him. \u00a0And of course, American Chinese food is not complete without fortune cookies so we also had them.Service is decent enough. I was ignored the first few minutes when I arrived at this restaurant but once I was seated, they were pretty attentive."], ["A B.", "Four of us stopped by for an early dinner and were thoroughly pleased. Everything was hot, fresh, and tasty. Service was great. We had Lo Mein with Shrimp, Sweet & Sour Pork, Beef & Broccoli, Won Ton Soup, Vegetable Soup, & Shrimp Rolls. Highly recommend."], ["Hector G.", "Me and the family ended up here because the original place we were supposed to go was closed for renovations. Turned out to be a blessing in disguise. We had dinner here on mothers day which we expected to be packed but we were immediately seated. To start off we had some long island iced teas and they were not shy with the liquor which is how I like my drinks. For the apps we had egg rolls, bbq pork, and wonton soup. Egg rolls were nice and crispy and flavorful. Bbq pork was tender and the sauce was delicious. The wonton soup was good and not watered down like a lot of places make it. For our entrees we had combination fried rice, mongolian beef, sweet and sour chicken. All of the food was excellent as well as the customer service . I do not have one negative comment about this place and I cant wait to go back and have it again."], ["Jason S.", "When it comes to great American Chinese delivery in the South Loop, Emperor's Choice takes the cake. Whoever picks up the phone and takes my order is always pleasant and helpful. Delivery is always much faster than the estimate they give you. And even the delivery guy is always very friendly. But most important of all - the food has been consistently delicious. I love their sesame chicken. The crab rangoons are excellent. They even went out of their way to prepare a dish I love that's not even on their menu, Chow Fun with Beef in Black Bean sauce - and it was the best I've ever had!"], ["Lorelli R.", "Delicious meal! For starters the seaweed soup with pork set the stage for an amazing meal! The Chinese broccoli with shrimp was excellent and paired nicely with the Crispy Chilean Sea Bass. Service was very pleasant and very efficient . Overall experience super fantastic"], ["Daniel H.", "Uh-may-Zing!!!! The food here is simply the best Chinese food I've ever had. Very fresh & the good tasted like it had not been sitting under a heat lamp all day ether That is not fast food. So, of you're looking for that, there always Panda Express. The food takes it's time because they're making it on the spot. Can't beat that!Great service too. Very family friendly."], ["Amber W.", "I had been here once in high school on a trip, and I remembered the food being much better that time than it was when I ate there with my boyfriend. We had the crab rangoon and some sort of fried noodles, along with green tea. The tea was lovely, with a refreshing, warm taste. The crab rangoon was truly odd, though. They were sort of greasy and super garlicky. Usually garlic wouldn't bug me, honestly I love garlic, but it just tasted weird. Our noodles tasted good, but they were also really greasy. We also had a hard time getting service from our waiter at times. It wasn't the worst, but it was just sort of meh. Maybe a little less grease and a little more attention from the staff."], ["April S.", "Enjoyed a family dinner here last night. Food was very good. We ordered chicken dumplings, egg rolls, won-ton soup, and sweet and sour chicken. Our food was brought to us by a pleasant and efficient server. Clean washrooms had nice finishes and were on the main floor."], ["Mandy P.", "This place is great for good food and fast delivery! \u00a0The portions are very generous and they always pack extra sauces and cookies. \u00a0I'm not a huge fan of Shrimp Egg Foo Young but my boyfriend is and so he always orders it when we find it on a menu. \u00a0I have to admit I LOVE this dish there! \u00a0This will definitely be my go-to place when I'm craving Chinese. \u00a0Only negative (which is why I left off one star) I have yet to try a chicken dish that I really enjoy, but I will keep trying! \u00a0Great place overall!"], ["Tegan E.", "Food was great. \u00a0Best hot and sour soup I have ever had. Crab Rangoon came with the lunch special that was also great!!"], ["Tina S.", "The food was delicious! Starting with the seaweed salad and crispy green beans, which came out quickly. Both dishes were very tasty and set the tone for our entrees..... broiled whitefish with black bean sauce and vegetable egg foo young with brown rice.... Both were well seasoned and fresh... My sister and I definitely enjoyed our dinner...Only complaint is that the restaurant is kind of small and the tables are extremely close together.... it's not conducive for private conversations or even a quiet dinner."], ["Benjamin B.", "Cheap family-style restaurant with quality food. The waiter was amazing and suggested all the right dishes for my family of 14 visiting town. He only made us order as much as we needed and brought an array of lovely dishes. All were great but everyone loved the coconut shrimp, orange chicken and shrimp-fried rice the most. I would reccommend Emeror's Choice to anyone wanting an authentic family-style chinese meal with dishes from all over China."], ["Brittany Y.", "Wow. Well, I will never listen to other Yelpers ever again. You guys.... you.. guys... how could you? I've been trying to find a new place to get salt and pepper tofu because the place I go isn't in the best neighborhood but theirs is delicious. Plus, it's kind of sad that I live walking distance from Chinatown and I've never eaten there. Since there are so many choices I figured Yelp would be the best place to look so that I could narrow down the choices. I went to this place because all of the comments about the salt and pepper tofu were great, things like \"surprise of the meal!\" and \"tofu packed with flavor\" had me VERY excited to try it. Well, I can say I sure was surprised....Especially given the reviews.The tofu almost tasted like water.... like it had NO FLAVOR....Salt and pepper tofu?It tasted like little chunks of water. I couldn't taste any salt, and no pepper... I mean and it wasn't just the tofu, it was the vegetables in it. It was as if someone deliberately sucked all of the flavor out of the dish to crush my spirit. So yeah.. that happened.Then the spring rolls, I don't know what was in them, but it was something very slimy and gooey about them. The only vegetable I know that does that is okra... yeah it was okra slimy.I don't want to leave such a bad review because the servers and were very nice and patient with me but... there's bland and then there....eating air....Plus the slimy spring rolls :("], ["Ganesh N.", "The Singapore Noodle and Moo Shoo pork was fabulous. \u00a0Orange chicken not so much. \u00a0Loved the service. \u00a0Plates were clean and beautiful. \u00a0Plastic rather than disposable chopsticks. \u00a0Tasty sauces - which truly differentiates Chinese resturants."], ["Krystle M.", "Stopped in for lunch one day after doing some work at a nearby school. I ordered the General Tso's chicken w/ rice lunch special. The portion was HUGE! It also came with soup and an egg roll (or was it Crab Rangoon?)...can't recall. Either way, there are plenty of places to eat in Chinatown but Emperor's Choice should be your first choice! Especially if you find yourself roaming the area and are looking for good food and quick service."], ["Yang S.", "Haven't been there for a while and I'm happy to see they newly remodeled the whole restaurant. New menu, new plates, new bathroom. This is definitely a fresh experience to me. I love the Peking Duck, spicy eggplant, and lemon grass pork. Fried rice is good too. I'll try their lobster next time when I go with friends."], ["Scott V.", "My 2nd time in Chinatown Chicago, and I wanted to try a place that was a little more upscale instead of a cheap, big eat place with no ambiance and d\u00e9cor like most places around here. Had no problem paying $10 or more as long as the food was good quality and I got it here. My friends had the eggrolls and I tried pot stickers and was not disappointed. All appetizers come with three different sauces and I must say, the hot mustard sauce was spicy and tasty. I got the show mien noodles with shrimp and again I wasn't disappointed and my friends got poultry and rice and were impressed.I enjoyed the ambiance of this restaurant. White table cloths and Asian music in the background made me feel like I was at a more classy restaurant. The service also deserved high praise. I am one that always likes to try different places, but I would go here again and suggest this place to friends."], ["Ryan M.", "As another reviewer noted, this restaurant is trying to cater to the American crowd with the telling signs being the decor, menu, and higher prices. \u00a0Why go down to Chinatown to have Americanized experience? \u00a0The best part or the meal was the egg rolls. \u00a0All the others dishes we ordered we disappointing. \u00a0Restaurant appeared clean and wait staff and service was fast and attentive."], ["Todd G.", "We got off the bus, I Yelped the highest rated restaurants w/ in 2 blocks and Emperor's Choice Restaurant popped up. It was everything I was hoping for when we went to Chinatown on our first stop in Chicago. Great atmosphere, good food and even better prices. I needed an extra fork to keep my wife and kids from trying to eat my General Zhao Chicken. They didn't like their entrees nearly as much as mine. (Why don't they just order what I order for Pete's sake?) The service was very good and the Crab Rangoon actually had crab in it! It was the best meal I had on our 7 day vacation and cost about half of what we spent everywhere else."], ["Nick P.", "Service was outstanding and food was even better! Get the crunchy green beans they are to die for, along with the hot and sour soup. Definatly would reccomend for anyone visiting the city or just trying to chow down on some asian cuisine."]]}
