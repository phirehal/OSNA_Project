Perfect date spot as the atmosphere is very cozy. You can usually walk in on a weekend if you have a small party but might want to make a reservation. The bacon wrapped dates and ceviche are two of my favorite apps. Everything I've had on the menu is seasoned very well. The service in the restaurant is great too! They give good recommendations and don't rush you. The only negative is that they don't have a double door so it's pretty cold inside in the winter from the door constantly opening."], ["Colin W.", "Bacon wrapped dates, hummus, mussels, etc. OMG! Everything was excellent!! The downside was that we were in town for a work convention (all 7 of us) but they would only allow us to use 4 credit cards. Our employer is kooky about expenses. This put a damper on the evening."], ["Comensal A.", "When I last visited Kurah a little over a year ago, I thought it was OK, but maybe needed a little more time to work out some kinks. The concept seemed promising, so I was eager to give it another try. Sadly, things were no better -- in fact, I liked it less this time. The d\u00e9cor is charming, but the food was hit-or-miss and the service lacked any sort of polish.On our last visit, we especially liked a complimentary starter of pita served with olive oil, za'atar and olives; this time, it was not complementary and was way too salty. We ordered two share plates -- beef & lamb shwarma was tasty but quite gristly; maldoum was tender & flavorful, though the somewhat mushy couscous could have used more seasoning. For dessert, we had a fig & pistachio phyllo purse; we liked it last time, but this time it was dry and very chewy.Service was a letdown in that only one server seemed knowledgeable and attentive -- others lacked any hint of grace or polish (language/culture issue?, lack of training?). Another flub was that an umbrella stand in their outdoor seating area was pushed up against the side of the building adjacent to our indoor table, and was banging against the window due to the wind; when we brought this to the server's attention, we got a shrug, but he didn't seem to know what to do about it.I won't be back. It's a shame, since the dining scene in the south Loop is so dismal (as bad as Hyde Park, in fact)."], ["Basia U.", "Cute, cozy place perfect for a romantic date or just a casual lunch. Small delicious \u00a0 plates great for sharing and the food quality is better than I expected. Our server was very helpful and friendly.

I bet the upstairs would be perfect for private parties."], ["Lauren G.", "I love this small neighborhood spot! The space is inviting and intimate, and service is very polite, efficient, and helpful. By far, my favorite item I have tried is the spicy hummus. This is not your average hummus - the spice is unreal! The falafel is also nice - they're smaller sized falafel, and taste fresh. In one visit, my table also tried the Middle Eastern cheese flatbread, which was decadent, totally unnecessary, but delicious all the same. In other visits, I have tried the tabouli and the ceviche, which were decent but not my favorite. As far as main plates, I've only tried the chicken kabob plate, which I remember tasting fresh and delicious. I have yet to be disappointed in the food! At each visit, my table has ordered carafes of sangria. While the red sangria tastes like your average sangria, I suspect it must be pretty full of juice or whatever they use to make it, and not too full of wine. I always expect to feel a little buzzed, but always end up just feeling full of sugary juice. That said, I have yet to go to Kurah and not order sangria so...Overall, great experience. Keep up the good work!"], ["Hiroki K.", "Pretty meh. Mediocre food for the price. Also, my waitress kept disappearing. I liked some of the decor (e.g., the upstairs area) but other parts of the restaurant weren't decorated enough, making it feel imbalanced."], ["Saahithi G.", "One of those randomly yelp find of mine for a spontaneous dinner with friends on a Saturday night. The moment I walked in, I felt I walked into some ethnic middle eastern world. Took a long half an hour wait although we had a reservation. We ordered almost every dish on the first page of appetizers. Falafel was great tasting, and the best hummus I ever had. My friends rated the bacon wrapped dates and lamb chops are finger licking good. Few of the bad choices were the squash and the stuff grape leaves. I recommend not even both to taste them. Almost forgot, the mussels are a plus as well. Spicy potatoes are nothing but tiny fries but tasted good."], ["Shannon S.", "We went on a Saturday for lunch and were the only people there... for the whole time. \u00a0I expected that the place would fill up but nope. \u00a0Not a soul. \u00a0Weird. \u00a0The interior is super cute, new, modern and clean. \u00a0I really liked it. \u00a0The bar looked nice and the industrial drop ceiling was covered in Edison bulbs - really funky, Chicago vibe.

It was definitely worth the $12 because 2 of us chomped on it and took 1/2 home. The mussels were full of sand. \u00a0All of them. \u00a0And that's sad because the sauce was good. \u00a0Oh, and my water glass was dirty and the server saw it but filled it with water anyway :( I think there's a lot of promise. \u00a0There was another gentleman working and I think he was the owner - he seemed highly invested and he was very nice."], ["Ahmad A.", "this restaurant is not that good , and it's very expensive, they serve 4 pieces of Kupah for 12 USD !!"], ["Johnny A.", "Holy smokes!

Unfortunately, this one was probably my most disappointing. I love Mediterranean food and this place looked like a modern spin on some of my classic Arabic favorites. I ordered the waiter's recommendation of kebbah and the fattoush salad. Both missed the mark. On one hand, they weren't close enough to the traditional version, but on the other, they weren't far either enough to make anything delicious and modern. So disappointed! I don't understand all of the good reviews here."], ["Matt H.", "We live in the neighborhood, and Kurah is in our regular rotation for take out or random dinners when we don't feel like cooking. \u00a0It's a good change of pace when we're in the mood for a warm meal that's not pizza or Thai/Chinese. \u00a0The dining area is nice and airy with vaulted ceilings, and they have one table for 6-8 people in the back corner has the feel of a private dining room (though note that it's bench style seating without back support in case that's a problem for people in your party).If you walk down 14th, you can peek in the window and see the kitchen, and they have a small outdoor dining area along 14th in the non-winter months. \u00a0We've tried most things on the menu and have yet to find something we didn't care for. \u00a0We keep coming back!"], ["Mary K.", "I ordered takeout here and the food was delicious --I had a kibbeh and flatbread and my friend had the beef skewer.

I have standards for my Mediterrranean food - this place didn't live up to those standards. I think my main issue with this place is that everything is preprepared and sitting in mettle warmers like how they do it at Panda Express or Chipotle. Nothing is freshly made so everything tastes a little old, a little overcooked, a little bland. I ordered a wrap with chicken and basically everything else and just found it disappointing. The flavors you expect from Mediterranean food were just not there. It tasted like a normal sandwich. The hummus was no better than the generic hummus you can get at the grocery store. I guess if I was a professional always in the area I would value this place for it's fast service and it's uniqueness (meaning it's not a Panera, Corner Bakery, McDonald's or Chipotle). And if you haven't really had Mediterranean food before you would probaby find the $10 meals a great value. But I've been to better places for cheaper and I don't work in the Loop so you definitely won't find me here again."], ["Bitty L.", "Love this place!

The restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly. The food was flavorful but over all okay....all the food is kept cool, so nothing u eat will be warm. I ordered the rice place with falafel as my protein - I got 3 sides/topings with it and 1 pita bread. I took the cucumber & tomato salad, couscous and eggplant curry. And also took addition sides of onion and hummus which were 50 cents each. The Falafel was unique since they don't completely mash the chickpeas. Compared to other express cusine like Chipotle, Piada - found this to be okay ...maybe worth trying once but nothing I will crave!"], ["Jennifer H.", "This Mediterranean chipotle like-chain is very good.

This restaurant is kind of like the Mediterranean food version of chipotle. You have a ton of options of what you want on your plate, sandwich, or salad. They have a huge variety of sauces, meats, and toppings. The employees are also really great. If you are skeptical of the food they are more than willing to answer questions about how spicy the sauce is or what the falafel tastes like. It is difficult to say whether I like Naf Naf or Roti better. I think I like Naf Naf's pita's better, but Roti has a bigger selection which is better if you are picky when if comes to your food. Overall, great experience with great customer service."], ["Jeff F.", "I'm addicted to the steak r\u014dti in a laffa wrap with couscous, feta, and olives. I love it. It's different but not crazy, a nice break from the saturation of sandwich joints right up the street.The service is quick, and the lunch rush is no exception. It's set up like Blackwood BBQ up on Lake (another spot I highly recommend). You can get in and get out without much of a fuss; the line moves quickly because you order your food and toppings as you go.It's a great spot when you want to break up the monotony of the common restaurants in the area."], ["Jess Y.", "For a fast casual place to grab a tasty bite under 10 bucks, I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was. I had their Sultan Sandwich - chicken (grilled?) with some delicious spicy sauce (you can choose to nix this if you're not a spice fan), hummus, tomato and cucumber salad, lettuce, and red cabbage slaw. They also have other dressings you can add, like dill yogurt or tahini. Note I ate this pita \"sandwich\" with a fork - it's one of those places where they layer things so if you want even tasting bites, you have to mix it up yourself. The pita bread was soft, moist, and denser than I expected. Chicken had great flavor, possibly due to the spicy sauce. Veggies looked and tasted fresh.Extra points for happy hipster background music - Passion Pit, Coldplay, Ben Howard - this was my first time at a Roti and I wouldn't hesitate to go back."], ["Meg S.", "One of my favorite lunch spots in the Loop.Food is always fresh, flavors are consistent and and unique.

It's a great place to try out if you're in the area."], ["Kendrick W.", "Roti is pretty solid. \u00a0All of the food tastes fresh and everything is well flavored. \u00a0They're a little stingy with the meat, but other than that, I really have no issues. \u00a0However comparing them to some of their competition like Naf Naf, I think they might want to be a little more generous. \u00a0It would also be nice if the pita was warm."], ["Kenneth Y.", "good for lunch at work. The portion size is great and nothing short of cutting you out of the picture with the food. I liked my dish and the pita pocket that came with it.

That being said, it was very tasty.I had a rice plate with veggies, hummus, cous-cous, tomato-cucumber salad and pita. It's a ton of food, and I didn't even come close to finishing mine. The cous-cous was my favorite. Kinda sweet with raisins. I would have liked a bigger piece of pita. My S.O. had the beef & rice plate and enjoyed it. Pretty affordable and yummy. I think ATX needs one."], ["Melissa F.", "So good. I like a nice healthy chicken lunch or dinner but hate bland chicken. This is not a problem at Roti. The other ingredients are also delicious and packed with flavor, like the olives and the creamy hummus. The spicy sauce (schug?) is not mind-blowingly spicy, but it's very good nonetheless.

The entrees don't stand out as much, but most people will like the generous portions. If you like desserts, their kenafeh is da bomb. Last but not least, patio seating (summer is coming!).What could be improved: the room-temperature pita and inconsistent service - I suppose it comes with the territory of running a mom-n-pop establishment in the high-traffic Old Town.Recommendation: give Old Jerusalem a try. For a casual date night or a group dinner over decent Middle Eastern fare + BYOB wine, you could do much worse than this homely restaurant."], ["Alicia D.", "Really great food!

My dad was in town from the burbs so I dragged him along for lunch. I was expecting slow service,but we greeted its as soon as we walked in, and the service remained attentive it entire visit with it making us feel rushed.We split the an appitizer and then we both got sandwiches. Everything was flavorful and not over or under seasoned. We both enjoyed everything and we'll likely be back. For the food I would likely go 4 stars, but factoring in the price it gets bumped to 5. With tax and tip it was under 25 which can be hard to do in the Gold Coast/old Town area. Not much ambiance, but I am okay with that for solid food and service."], ["Kymberly J.", "I've been here a few times and have always been satisfied. This place has some of the best lentil soup around. It's so comforting on a chilly Chicago day! I take a star off because the service is so very much served without a smile. And not in a mean way like I want to stiff her tip, it's more like in a sad way. I feel sorry for the woman who is always my server. Maybe it's because she is never allowed a day off but there is something about her that makes me feel like she might not want to be there or she is overworked. Anyway, lentil soup, tabbouleh salad, falafel sandwich, whatever you get you wont be disappointed."], ["Emily J.", "Great spot for lunch in Old Town.

I had my expectations high from previous reviews and the traditional ambiance. To start, the bread was cold and my yogurt appetizer was watered down. \u00a0Had the shawarma plate for a main.

V.", "Quick delivery service via GrubHub. Service in restaurant is slower than it should be (especially for premade items ie:hummus), especially when the weather is warmer and they have the outdoor seating.

That's all I ordered and all I was craving the entire day. Old Jerusalem has some good lentil soup. They are located in the Old Town neighborhood in Chicago.

I was craving lamb and very purposefully ordered a braised lamb wrap with a side of herb fries. It came out to a little over $10. The service wasn't too friendly but not rude either, short and succinct.I got my number and waited at one of the tables. Most of them seat 2 and there's quite a few. The wait was around 10-15 minutes. When I picked up my order, I was surprised at how heavy it was - they definitely aren't stingy with portions. The wrap was close to the length of my forearm. I'd say the best part was the flatbread, grilled to perfection and oh so soft. I may never go back to hard, tasteless burrito wraps. The lamb was the perfect texture, but not the most flavorful. Maybe a little salt would have helped; I applied the spicy sauce it came with liberally. The wrap was well-balanced, the crisp veggies setting off the soft flatbread and lamb delightfully. I also have a problem with Mediterranean wraps getting too soggy towards the end, and happily did not have this issue with my Zaytune's wrap.In my humble opinion, the herb fries were disgusting. However, other reviewers seem to love them so maybe I just caught them on an off night. Mine were drenched in oil, soft and soggy, though the herb seasoning was scrumptious. I'd pass instead of risking that again.If you have even the slightest affinity for Mediterranean food, you HAVE to try Zaytune."], ["Lily Z.", "I came here with a friend on Friday and I loved it.He ordered the lentil soup and baba ganoush. I ordered the grilled kaftka wrap and herb fries. Baba ganoush - Loved that they provided warm bread to dip! I've never had it before so I can't compare it to anything else.Grilled kaftka wrap - Surprisingly large and fresh. Herb fries - Very well seasoned. Maybe a little bit too salty. Everything tasted fresh and delicious. I was very surprised that I liked everything. I'm usually pretty picky. Haha. I'm glad that I've found a closer and better version of Pita Inn."], ["Lyndon M.", "Fries were epicness. Had the chicken grill platter and it was quite good. Will get this next time I'm in the area."], ["Unknown K.", "Good food, especially the herb fries. They didn't have kafta and offered no reason why.

And I'm so glad that it's so close to where I live because I can get my middle eastern food fix whenever I want now! My friends and I decided we wanted something a little different for lunch besides the typical rice boxes from Chinatown (don't get me wrong - I LOVE those rice boxes along with a side of fried chicken wings...ooooh really hits the spot, but I digress - I was just in the mood for something else!)I've had take out and dine in and both were pretty damn good. The restaurant itself is pretty small with maybe 10 tables...maybe. The menu is posted on the wall and you order at the counter. The staff was really helpful when it came to explaining what certain dishes on the menu were and offered great suggestions. This isn't a fast food joint, so don't expect to get your food in 5 minutes. They make everything to order so expect our meal to be fresh and hot! Even the flat bread is made in house daily!Here's what I usually get: -braised lamb leg shawarma wrap ($7.75): think of the wraps as middle eastern burritos loaded with lettuce, parsley, onions, cucumbers, tomato, hummus and tahini sauce wrapped with grilled flat bread. The braised lamb leg was really tender and succulent. The portion was large enough for me to eat lunch and dinner and I consider myself a big eater. The wraps come with hot sauce as well, but I suggest asking for extra tahini too. This was my favorite!-chicken shawarma wrap ($6.75): the chicken wrap contained similar ingredients as the braised lamb, but just different protein. Pretty good as well. The chicken is grilled nicely and juicy.-falafel ($3.50): I've tried a lot of falafel and this is some of the best. The outside is a crispy golden brown layer and inside is soft and flavorful. It comes with a little hummus to dip.-herb fries ($1.95): I call these crack fries because they're so damn addicting! Paired with the kalamata sauce (purple sauce), it's a spectacular combination. I asked for extra sauce because it's so delicious. The fries come out crispy, hot, salty (in a good way) and are seasoned perfectly. This is a MUST TRY!-baklava ($2.65/3 pieces): The walnut baklava was sweet, flaky and yummy. Not the best I've had, but they're decent.There's a good amount of street parking in the area, as well as some spots in the residential area. Overall, if anything, just come here and order the herb fries!"], ["Josh S.", "They do a good job. Nice lean cuts of meat and great service.

I pass by this place many times and the vet I bring my dog is right across from here. I love Mediterranean food too, so I do not know what my excuse is for never coming here, but I sure do regret it. That is all in the past now because this place is yummy.I came here with my gf on a Sunday afternoon and it was kinda slow. We ordered herb fries, falafel wrap, and grilled steak shawarma.
