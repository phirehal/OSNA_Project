{"Three Amigos Mexican Restaurant and Cantina": [["Stephanie Y.", "Ok so, I went here on a date. \u00a0This review is long overdue as I'm no longer seeing said guy, but whatcha gonna do. \u00a0Yes, this is a very unassuming location, but don't let that fool you. \u00a0The food is delicious. \u00a0I had the enchilada special and the taste was phenomenal. \u00a0I tried pork, beef and chorizo and am hard pressed to pick a fav. \u00a0The accompanying margarita was also potent and good (though nothing special, but still good). \u00a0The chips and salsa were also on point. \u00a0 The perfect thickness and kick to the salsa. Ok for rating this five stars I wish I could write more. \u00a0But simply put this is the best Mexican I have had in Charlotte. \u00a0Note it isn't approaching best of all time...that goes to La Rancherita in Quad Cities, IL. \u00a0That spot is the one thing I miss about the Midwest."], ["Shawn H.", "I am writing this review on behalf of my roommate. His only review is that:\"They forgot my guacamole.\"....nuff said Sincerely,Lonely Without Guacamole"], ["Brittany Joy M.", "Delicious! They only serve lime margaritas but they are fresh and amazing. The pico, guacamole and fresh salsa paired with their freshly made chips easily make this one of the best Mexican Restaurants in Charlotte. The staff was attentive and the atmosphere was very chill. Great for families and date nights."], ["Peggy C.", "I am about to say something that may cause a lot of backlash... I don't think this is a Mexican joint (and by \"Mexican\" I am referring to the Americanized version of Mexican I'm used to, mainly like that of Azteca or Monterrey). Don't get me wrong, there's absolutely nothing wrong with not being a Mexican restaurant, but I wish I know the true origin of their kitchen and then I can just order what they are great at.Just let's talk about the logic behind my statement. I have eaten here many times now, and something about their finished products just don't look quite \"Mexican.\" They have potatoes in their rice, which is more yellow and not that orange color. Excellent rice, but just not quite Meixcan rice. Then the other night we were there for a group dinner and when Arroz Con Pollo came out, it looked like Fried Rice! There was no tomato sauce, or melted cheese, or sliced avocado. It tasted good, GIANT portion, a great deal to be honest, but then it just wasn't the Gringo Mexican style Arroz Con Pollo one may be craving for.SO - here is my verdict: eat here because it has good food, but I wouldn't say this is the BEST Mexican place since I'm not quite sure it is Mexican. And I hope one day they will have a side menu of the real origin of their kitchen staffs, because I am honestly dying to know what am I \u00a0really missing here.P.S. If you are to have their empanadas, go for the beef or veggies - somehow their chicken ones tend to be dry and tasteless."], ["Sam J.", "GO! Just go.........and make sure that it's on a Friday. Why? Grande sized house Margaritas are $5 each. I always drink two, because they are Fergalicious!!!Be warned.....they are both delicious and potent, which are both good things in my book. After two 'Ritas yesterday, I had a little trouble walking for a second or two. Other random thoughts.....WIBBLY WOBBLYMy initial booth's table was so wobbly that it wasn't possible to eat at that table. I asked to move to an adjacent booth. My waitress complied with no comment, other than a smirk. If that table had been a horse, ala 1950's westerns, \"they\" would have shot it in the head to put it out of it's misery. MARGARITASecondly, you ARE going to want a second Margarita. Even though they are large, my first one was almost gone before my food arrived. How large you ask? I got in a pretty good arm curl workout drinking those 'Ritas. Curl. Sip. \"Ahhhh.\" Curl. Sip. \"Ahhhh.\" Repeat. Feel the burn!Three Amigos' Margaritas are made with freshly squeezed lime juice, good tequila, triple sec, lime and orange slices, and a ton of salt on the rim. My waitress, who was also serving as the bartender, showed me their placard as having been selected Charlotte's BEST Margarita. The two that I had were the best in recent memory, so I don't dispute their claim. (They are also made QUICKLY!) yelp.com/biz_photos/thre\u2026GUAC ME, BABY!A MUST is ordering their chunky guacamole with pico de gallo, because it is amazing! I always get a small, appetizer size, portion to go along with the chips and salsa. I have never eaten better guac. The appetizer size is plenty for one, but for two or more people you'll need to order a larger sized portion. CHIPS, AND SALSA, AND GUAC.....OH, MY!Oh, speaking of the chips and salsa....the chips come out warm and covered in some type of red spice. They are good.The salsa \"appears\" to be homemade, and it is filled with bits of onions, tomato, and chiles. I have not had better gratis salsa anywhere else. I usually add a little hot sauce for good measure.TACOSEntree: I ordered the TACOs AL PASTOR today for a change. They were just \"okay.\" Three Amigos scrimps on their taco filling as it is, but there were only one or two pieces of pineapple in both tacos. The flavor was also not as good as their charcoal grilled tasting carne asada tacos, which are very good. I still have not found an entree dish that has blown me away yet, but I'm still hopeful. The carne asada tacos are $7.95, and the tacos al pastor are $8.95. Both are too expensive for the meager portions received compared to other places. To offset that a bit.....the refried beans and yellow rice are wonderful. I cleaned my plate, which I rarely do in a Mexican restaurant. SERVICE? Usually good to excellent.ATMOSPHERE? Loud! The Hispanic music here reminds me of an 80's Latin disco dance party. This place rocks! There is Tele-MUN-DO comedies on the TV, which get funnier and funnier as the Margaritas go sippy sippy. CUANTO CUESTA? Expect to pay $20+ per person, IF you go full tilt boogie and order a little bit of everything, including a couple of drinks. I like to splurge once in awhile, without worrying about prices. I used to go to a good steak house, but more and more lately I find myself craving tacos, great guac, and grande Margarita(s). Maybe I'll see you there next Friday."], ["Mary M.", "This place is really cool! Great food & drinks! It was really busy a good sign that people really like this place!

I drive trucks all over the country, including to the edge of the US-Mexican border, and this is by far the best I've had.A good measure of this place is to taste their refried beans - wow! I had a burrito last time I went and am craving another visit to have one again. They also have plantains. They're super delicious and would be a perfect desert if I didn't prefer having them as an appetizer. I didn't see them on the menu last time, but be sure to ask for an order, they're still available.

We ordered chicken and shrimp chimichanga take out on a Wednesday night. They didn't want to give us chips and salsa at first but i insisted on it. Forward to at home and eating. The chimichangas were horrible. The queso it was drenched in was unusually watery ( I wouldn't have minded if it was good, I love queso). Ew. My 'shrimp' chimichanga only had 3 small, overcooked pieces of shrimp. Pathetic. They effectively gave me an overpriced, tasteless bean and rice burrito. It was in serious need of seasonings as well. My bf felt the same of his chicken chimichanga, I took a bite and found the chicken was terribly dry. We will not be ordering take out from here again. I'll give it one more shot for the endless enchilada special but I won't be back if I'm not impressed.

We both got the Mixed Fajitas with Chicken, Steak and shrimp. \u00a0Perfectly seasoned, not greasy at all, and a mountain of food. \u00a0 YUM!We also had a complementary Empanada from the Yelp app. \u00a0It was basically deep fried ground \u00a0beef and queso. \u00a0Had good flavor when it was hot.....but we had so much food at the table, i only ate a couple bites of it. \u00a0By the time we left....the restaurant was extremely packed with lots of people crowding the door which is by the bar...and everyone was getting their drink on. \u00a0But we never felt rushed to leave.I will definitely go back for dinner here in the future....as it was authentic...and very good!Been in CLT for 13 years .....hate ive not come sooner."], ["Clint W.", "Our first time there- Delicious food! It was busy, around 6pm on a Saturday. We were seated immediately and the service was great. Quick and friendly service with a smile. I ordered the chicken burrito which was smothered in cheese. My boyfriend ordered the nachos which were huge- enough for 2 or 3 people to share. \u00a0The large house margarita was a steal at $7.50, delicious Margarita. He loved the salsa but I didn't eat it. Only down side is that it was super hot- not sure if the a/c was broken but the thermostat on the wall said 81. I would've stayed for another drink but left after eating because it was so hot in there."], ["Clint L.", "Last night leaving this restaurant I was torn between giving this restaurant 3 or 4 stars. The food was OK, nothing spectacular, but not really bad either. The Cheese dip was very bland and very runny so I don't recommend that. The salsa was decent. I have enchiladas that again, we're OK but nothing go make them stand out and my fianc\u00e9e had fiatas that were the same story. The service was really slow. We were in the restaurant for nearly 2 hours (not including our wait time) and our drinks ran empty several time and I just feel like we were placed on the back burner. But all in all, good enough for a 3 star I suppose...... Until this morning when we both woke up running to the bathroom. \u00a0It's definitely extremely rare for me to get sick from food so not sure what went wrong last night. I guess the best piece of advice I can give is to stay away from the chicken.

Goes to prove the quality of the place !!"], ["Ernie And Dora H.", "This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Three Amigos Mexican Grill and Cantina located in the Midwood area of Charlotte. Dora here. You getting tired of Midwood yet? I'm not. :) This restaurant located in a small strip center provides an ideal location for a quick drop-in lunch or a family get-together for dinner.As part of an online app promotion, we started with a free Beef Empanada, a pastry shell turnover made by folding dough over a filling, beef hamburger in this case, sealing it, and frying it. This Empanada was great, fried golden brown, with a juicy filling including cheese. Dora here. And what a great start it was! Gooey cheese pocketed in the perfect crust. For the meal, I ordered the Fajitas De Camaron, shrimp fajitas cooked with onions and green peppers served in a cast iron skillet along with sides of rice and refried beans, delivered to the table, sizzling. The shrimp and vegies were tender, but I would have liked more seasoning to bring out the flavor. Be prepared for ginormous portion sizes. If we'd known, we could've easily shared.Dora here. So hubby knows that I usually order fajitas at Mexican restaurants. At his prodding to try something different (I find it interesting that he ordered fajitas, don't you? What's up with that? :) ) and the server's recommendation, I opted for the Bistec Encebollado, grilled steak with onions along with rice and refried beans. And tortilla shells, of course.In my opinion, this tasted much like steak fajitas and I would've enjoyed it with a bit more zest as well. Other than that, the tortillas, both flour and corn, tasted like they were made on site and the beans and rice were good. Overall, the meal was pleasant.I would rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food.

I visited on a Tuesday night with my friend and surprised at how small the place is! It's a true hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurant.We ordered the (small) house margarita and I found it to be a bit bland. I didn't get much flavor or 'oomph' from the drink. I've definitely had better margaritas. We were given the standard complimentary salsa and chips and I ordered a small portion of the guacamole. The salsa? VERY good and the chips were slightly seasoned which provided a nice flavor. The guac was good, it tasted very fresh but nothing else that was of note to remark about.I ordered the enchiladas de horno (chicken enchiladas with cheese, onions, cilantro and avocado) which came with re-fried beans and rice. I loved the portion size of the enchiladas. They weren't your standard oversized portion found at other Mexican spots. My biggest problem with the meal was that parts of the rice was overcooked. Like, crunchy bits of rice which is a big downgrade for me.I've had better Mexican food but I'd definitely give Three Amigos another try!"], ["Chelsea D.", "A weird mash-up of hip typography and craft beers with very traditional Mexican and Dominican offerings. The service was strange: I am still not sure which of the three peopl who tag-teamed our table was our actual server, and in spite of the group effort, it was weirdly slow to get our order taken and drinks refilled. The dip trio was not worth getting--the table salsa was significantly better than the pico (and I like chunky salsa!), which had a strange aftertaste. The guacamole was chunky and needed the piquancy of limes. The queso was served with a skin. The rice was dry and the beans were mediocre--but for me refried beans are only worth eating if they taste like bacon fat. My chicken chimichanga was fantastic. And the sweet plantains (I know, odd combination) were heavenly. It was a relatively inexpensive meal, though perhaps I'm just used to Alaska prices, and I left full. A solid choice but I've had better."], ["M C.", "8pm 4th of July Dinner and starving:We decided to check this place out because it was the only restaurant that had quite a crowd.

No butter? I asked another server to show me the menu again because I found it out that the chef would not have any butter. The nice waiter quickly remedied the problem, got me my salt, pepper, and butter but darn it, by the time I got back to our hotel I realized Katie never gave me utensils or napkins so I had to go back down to our lobby to request utensils and napkins. By the time I got my order to go, and got to actually eat my food was nearly 1015pm and cold...No butter? Really?

I tried to accept with a fresh frame of mind. I knew better than to order a Margarita this time as orange juice margs don't do it for me, so a simple glass of wine was fine. We ordered queso for the table. Tasteless and runny. No one raved about their dinners and lots went back when the table was cleared. I got a taco that I ate because I was quite hungry at the end of the workday, but anything would have done the trick.

I've been there three times now and each time keeps getting worse. We sat on the patio all three times and have had terrible service. We've had waiters disappear, forget orders and drinks, and bring out wrong orders. The trio was meh - the salsa was way to spicy, the queso water, and the quac bland. I've had several tacos which were also sub par. This past time I had the chicken fajitas and had the most measly piece chicken served on a plate. For the prices of the drinks and food I would expect more.If you want good tacos and margaritas, head to Bakersfield."], ["Olivia J.", "I am completely RuRu's obsessed. No shame. My favorite part about RuRu's is the amazing atmosphere. We sat on the patio a few weeks ago and it was so delightful- beautifully done. It is so unlike anywhere else that I have ever been in Charlotte. The service can be a little slow at times, but I actually prefer that over pushy waiters/waitresses. Both the guacamole and queso are delicious here- even the salsa is extra good!I have tried every salad that they offer and they are all delicious and unique. I did not enjoy the burrito bowls as much- I would definitely not order one again. The tacos are also excellent, but very small. RuRu's also has great drinks- I LOVE that they serve frozen margaritas. Ask for the Mango, I promise you won't regret it!! If you can't decide about whether or not to try RuRu's, I would definitely say give it a chance. I had very positive experiences here and can't wait for more long dinners on the patio during the summer!"], ["Katie I.", "First off, where are you supposed to park? We found a spot in the back in a tiny parking lot, which then put us in the back entrance of the restaurant which is set up like a long narrow house. We had a group of 7 - and they put us in what I guess would be the living room with bookshelves, a fireplace and a few small tables. Which is unique, but where are we supposed to eat? I ordered a $10 margarita - it was ok. A little tart for my liking. And we all shared the trio which was guac, queso & salsa. This would have been better to share if we were sitting at a table! We all ordered some tacos and honestly no one was impressed! They were fine, but Ive had better. The prices were a little on the high side so not sure we'll be back."], ["Patricia M.", "Likes: This is not a traditional mexican restaraunt but more eclectic texmex. Good neighborhood location and fun atmosphere and decor with a variety of good margarita-inspired cocktails. Calamari is delicious and I highly recommend it! Gripes: The guacamole and cheese dip is mediocre at best. Honestly, it's hard to mess up fresh guacamole when fresh avocados are used (which they are here) but it tasted bland. The tacos are not consistent - some are great and some are just ok. If it were not for the location, I probably would not return."], ["Shannon M.", "Everything was amazing except bar service. Our dining experience was most definitely 5 stars. Server was quick, super nice and our food came out excellent. Afterwards, we wanted to go grab a drink outside but it was too busy so we opted to sit at the indoor bar which was nice. However, after asking to have the channel changed to something other than golf... The bartender had to be asked twice...then he had to go ask the manager...and 30 minutes later the channel never was changed. Needless to say, we finished our drink and got the bill. This is only frustrating because 1) no one else was watching the tv 2) we were really enjoying our time but felt that we were more of an annoyance than appreciated customers. This would have been a 3 star if the food service wasn't as amazing as it was."], ["Basshector J.", "Must haves: For app: Tommy Love Wingy.

It was gone within a few minutes.I ordered the papas tostadas & the short rib taco. I really enjoyed the short rib taco, the papas was alright. All of my friends really enjoyed their meals. Another highlight was the salsa sauces. Dangg were those delicious!! The green one... LAWD! I could not stop eating it and am embarrassed to say I used 3/4ths of the bottle. That itself was worth it! Soooo delicious, and fresh.This would be a cute place for a date!"], ["Marcie C.", "Have been here several times and everything each time has been great. The bartenders do a nice job keeping up. Was there last night, a Friday, and we got there just before the rush--about 615. They do a great job making fresh margaritas and definitely recommend a pitcher if we a groups of 3-4. They have a nice tequila selection (would love it even more if you would stock Ocho Tequila) and appear to have a good bourbon selection. The guacamole is really good along with the sauces. I have now tried all of the tacos--favs are the braised beef and the mole tacos. The others are great too--full of flavor! \u00a0Typically very fast but I think they lost our order last night as it took a while and the manager came to apologize. Not a big deal as they were slammed. Not sure if they have improved the parking situation or not, we parked at the Teeter.

If I was ten years younger and still enjoying cocktails I would rate five star. But, since I'm not I can only give it a three. The tables in the restaurant only accommodate the larger parties-a party of two will find themselves eating at the bar. The food is good (not great or unique) I give it 3.5 stars. The presentation of the food is nice and service quick."], ["Corey Tess T.", "Interesting little spot with good margaritas. Hipster Heaven.Cool interior and a a cool crowd. They do margaritas by the pitcher or individually in mason jars - I give them a B+We walked down to try it because a friend had been to the one in Cincinnati and really liked it. My first impression was that it was way too crowded for the amount of space inside and extremely loud. It has picnic tables, barrel tables and some cute booths. I liked the garage style doors that open to the street - that was my favorite feature.The specialty drinks were few - i usually have to try specialty cocktails wherever I go, but both of the choices on the menu were heavy duty liquor.. so i skipped that. I can't handle bourbon or whiskey... :-/We had to wait about an hour at one of their standing bars and we had some chips and guac. The guac was pretty fresh - I give that an A - the one item I give an A+ is the cheese with Chorizo - that was awesome!They serve tacos \u00c0 la carte and that seems to be what their \"thing\" is - the tacos are mock street-style (I say mock because they don't taste anything like street tacos, but then again, i am from Los Angeles... so take that with a sprig of cilantro) They weren't bad - they just weren't really authentic in any way. I had a few different kinds... just to be sure :) I wasn't really happy with the wait considering how long it took them to re-seat empty tables and to wait on tables that were already seated - and they have a large empty area near the front door/bar that could accommodate about 3 or 4, 2 tops.. that could have alleviated some of the back up of people mashed together in the walk areas.The server we finally got when we were seated was extremely MEH - we joked with her and she acted like we were annoying her by being silly or humorous. Maybe she was just tired... but hey - so were we after standing for an hour - waiting for a table.I might be back.. not sure..."], ["Fabiana F.", "I freaking love this place. So much that Timmy Tom and I came here every Sunday for about 2 months. We thought it was becoming such a serious addiction that now we try to limit ourselves to bi-weekly visits. Let's see, the place itself is very cool. I like the decor, the picnic tables, the huge bar, the johnny cash music, and the old west movies. Right away, it feels very homey. Next, the food. TT has tried every taco, tostada, and torta, and is always happy with whatever he gets. As for me, two milanesa tortas just inst enough - I love them!! The milanesa chicken is always cooked perfectly and the avocado lemon mayo is so refreshing and tasty. They are the perfect size and I am basically ALWAYS craving them. When it comes to the tacos, short rib all the way. This has to be everyones favorite - its so juicy and tender - ugh, heaven! I have a little secret - I ask for the short rib torta as a tostada. Extra meat, crunchy taco, and a little lettuce - it's the perfect compliment to my two milanesa sandwiches!! I think their margaritas are quite tasty and a bang for your buck. In fact, the whole menu is very well priced, in my opinion. I feel like we eat very well and don't walk out poor. I thought their limited menu would get boring quick but I was wrong. I am so happy this placed opened up and that its so close to me because if any place is going to become my 'Cheers,' it's Bakersfield."], ["Melissa J.", "Great restaurant. Get the queso, different tacos, and margaritas. Only get the pitcher of margaritas if you have 3-5 people... You learn your lesson when you try to split it with only 1 other person."], ["Evan R.", "Yum! This is not a typical Mexican or taco place. It's more of a California twist. We had the chicken Milanese sandwich and the short rib sandwich. They both were a lot of food and had amazing flavor! \u00a0I can't forget to mention the app- we had the queso with chorizo and jalape\u00f1os. It was the best queso I've had recently! Their chips are good too. The inside is really nice, there are garage doors that roll up, so will be really nice this spring! Great bar set up too. Drinks looked good, but we didn't try any. One note, it is really loud. They could turn the music down a notch. (We are younger with no kids and thought it was loud). The only other minus is the parking set up. Very hard to find a spot and the spaces that were open specifically said they were not for Bakersfield parking. Hopefully they can get that worked out!We will definitely be back!!"], ["Scott L.", "Neither food nor service are impressive, hopefully the drinks will keep this place alive until Spring. I dropped in Saturday as tacos sounded a great idea on the last of the warm fall days. When I sat at the bar & caught up with a friend for 5 to 10 minutes, it took the bartender asking to refill my friends' drinks for her to come over and even then I had to get her attention myself to get a menu or water.Perusing the menu was as disappointing. No entrees, chips & salsa are $3. Within 3 blocks is Moe's & Tijuana Flats. I get that Bakersfield's chips & salsa are made daily but do you really decide where to eat based exclusively on this side item? Tacos are $4 each and they're small. They are tasty, but flour tortillas aren't available, tacos are served on white corn tortillas only. My friends had the short rib sandwich earlier and remarked it was good but a lot of bread. I ordered 3 tacos, one pastor and each style of chicken. They came out in a timely fashion and the pastor is a good example balanced with fresh pineapple. I couldn't tell the difference between the two chicken styles. Still peckish, I had the veggie tortilla of fried potatoes, black beans, guac and lettuce. It's quite a treat!I like the decor, the roll up doors and naked lights are a relaxed vibe. While I again waited for the bartender's attention to get my check, I noticed the bar back squeezing lemons for their margaritas. Since my friends stayed and had a pitcher they must be pretty good. It seems like a great place to drink which isn't my thing. Given the lack of parking, other places with equally good pastor tacos at better prices (la unica on central) and no reservations you could very well hunt for parking, find it, and have an hour wait. **The manager sent a yelp compliment and clarified they have more valet spots than those at Berrybrook up to 40 spots total** Still I hope the owners have the cash to survive until spring when margaritas or beers with a gentle breeze blowing in off East Blvd is a great idea."], ["Kieran M.", "We were definitely excited about a new Mexican-type restaurant opening up, so we checked out Bakersfield on a Saturday. \u00a0This place is definitely more of a bar than a restaurant, so we were a little bit disappointed. \u00a0Think of it as a Mexican themed All American Pub. (in terms of atmosphere and crowd)It was pretty loud and crowded by 7pm. \u00a0We waited 45 mins for a table, and then we were finally seated at a picnic table with some strangers. I hate eating at community seating when I go out to eat. \u00a0It just makes me think the restaurant is cheap and trying to cram as many humans into a sardine can as possible. When you eat at a picnic table you don't really ever settle in and enjoy yourself, either.In terms of food and drink, the margaritas were good and the tacos we ordered were very good. The short rib one was probably the best, but the rest were serviceable. One nice thing is that you can order them a la carte, so you can try the different ones out. Unfortunately, they charge you for chips and salsa, which rubs me the wrong way as well. \u00a0They aren't even good or special. \u00a0I may go back here for some drinks and to sit at the bar, but never again for eating. \u00a0The value is in the margaritas, not the overpriced food you get to experience at a picnic table with strangers, while people slam into you as they shuffle around the bar."], ["Jeff S.", "I stopped here on a stormy Tuesday thinking it might be less busy and I could easily find a parking space. \u00a0Wrong....apparently the place still has the newness factor and I drove around 10 minutes trying to find a parking space \u00a0 I tried the valet parking across the street but they were full and I ended up driving around before settling on a space 3 blocks away.Thankfully there were a couple of seats at the bar which I claimed one. \u00a0Looking around the place, I felt really old here. The place seems to cater to the younger crowd even at 8pm. \u00a0The bar was busy. It was about 10 minutes before someone even acknowledged me. \u00a0Then I asked what their beers were and she explained them (little did I know that the menu she would hand me in a few minutes would contain a list of their beers). \u00a0Thankfully they have a bunch of craft beers on tap. \u00a0The food menu is small and consists of apps (think chips with salsa, queso or guac), salads, tacos and such but your choices are limited for all of them.I went with the recommendation from another review of the queso with everything except chorizo for an app and 2 tacos rojas which were all vegetarian. \u00a0Another disappointment when both arrived at the same time. \u00a0The queso was mediocre at best. \u00a0It was very grainy and the extras of black beans and jalapenos were on top of a cheese crust rather than mixed in the queso.The tacos were decent but nothing i would consider better than average.Service is what caused this to be a 2 star review rather than a 3. Although there were 3 bartenders, only one seemed to be 'my' bartender but she disappeared and I didn't see her after one \"Are you ok here\". \u00a0 Another bartender asked me if I wanted another beer but that was it...at that point I was ready to close my bill. \u00a0The 3rd one asked again if I needed another beer and I stated I was done and finally I received a check. Unfortunately at the time it was too late to make up for the other mistakes.So if you like trendy places in trendy neighborhoods with limited parking, perhaps you would enjoy this one. But honestly, my other choice when i chose to stop here was Moe's down the street. After spending some time at Bakersfield, I wish I would have chose Moe's. \u00a0This place seems to be popular with some of the locals but if you check their website, it appears they are yet another chain with their other locations in the midwest. \u00a0In order to survive here they need to be open to people over 40, improve their bar service and make their restaurant a destination where people will walk for \u00a0blocks to get there. \u00a0I cannot see myself coming back here until something changes."], ["Elyse B.", "I'm so glad Bakersfield has finally moved in! The space is beautifully designed with a great wraparound bar as the centerpiece. Nearly every spot at the bar has coat/ purse hooks AND individual outlets (woot woot!). There are benches at the front of the restaurant for groups and booths on both sides of the bar.Drinks: I highly recommend starting with the house margarita. It's the perfect combo of tart, sweet, and salty. And it's served in a mason jar.Food: The queso is very good. We've gotten it plain each time, but I'm trying it with beans and/or chorizo on my next visit. The tostadas are larger than I was expecting and flavorful, but kind of awkward to eat. If you're on a first date and trying to look cute while eating, they probably aren't the way to go. The tacos are also delish. We've had the mole, rojo, fish, short rib, and cochinitas. The fish was the only one we didn't love. It was a tad too frozen fish sticky for my taste.Service: They're attentive, friendly, and go above and beyond to make you happy. I've only been a few times, but our previous servers have recognized me on each of our visits and stopped by to say hi.Reservations: Make 'em now! If you don't have a res, they'll call you when your table is ready.Hopes & dreams: I hope they put the game on those awesome TVs on game days. It'd be a great spot for football watching. Also, I'd love to see them expand to weekend brunch service (pretty please??)."], ["Paul C.", "Great addition to the vibrant Dillworth scene, this Cal-Mex (not really Tex Mex) place has a limited menu but it seems that they do that on purpose to focus in on quality. And the food is definitely quality as they make their own chips, tortillas and breads. We got a boatload of items, starting with the Queso and Chorizo with fresh tortilla chips. Great flavor but we felt it could have used more heat, so we added some of their roasted red pepper sauce. Followed that with their Short Rib Torta, which was outstanding! Super tender and fkavorful....not sure of the arugula though. Next was the Tostada with chicken. That was pretty good, nice flavor especially when adding the fresh lime they give you. Now for the tacos. I know....we're pigs...oink oink oink. Had the Chicken Mole and Pork Pastor. The pork taco was better. Being from Chicago and my buddy being from NYC our definition of Mole is FAR different than Bakersfield's. Their mole jyst didn't have the requisite \"sweet heat\" that defines mole. There was too much chocolate and it wasn't Mexican chocolate. Honestly just not a very good Mole.Other than that this is a solid 4 star restaurant.

It's located in what's nearly a \"hole in the wall\" in a strip mall next to a buffet restaurant.This is a 'taqueria' by the most pure definition of the word. This is street food in a restaurant. I've ordered all the traditional tacos, and they are all delicious. The tortillas are perfectly cooked, the portion size is spot-on, and the radish, along with the toppings for each taco are fantastic. I could eat a dozen of these at a sitting, but I try to stop at 3.I've also tried the refried beans and the rice, both of which taste amazing. The beans are creamy and mild, and the rice is savory, but not over-salted.This place is authentic, and the owner is very friendly and engaging. I only drop one star for a few reasons: I wish that the chips and salsa weren't charged after the first basket (it's a low priced/loss lead food item, so not sure why they charge for extra), I also wish the wait staff was a bit older/more seasoned. Finally, I wish there were some milder salsas. I love Mexican street food, but this gringa in Charlotte can't take the heat! Their green salsa is the mildest heat-wise. I'd like more flavor and a bit less heat as an option.Still, 4 stars from me, and I recommend this place highly. I'm developing a craving again, just reviewing it!

My only negative is that the menu is kind of pricey, and chips and salsa does not automatically come with your order.

I want to give it more based on the location, vibe, and service, but the food simply isn't very good.First off, the chips, salsa, and queso. The chips were stale, the corn salsa was nothing more than underripe tomato chunks and corn (no seasoning whatsoever), and the queso was quite clearly microwaved velveeta. Not a good start. For entrees, we split the specialty tuna and bbq mahi tacos. Both were one-note and heavy-handed on the sauces. Requested tuna medium rare, but received overcooked tuna. Way too much wasabi on the tuna--not too spicy, it just overpowered every other flavor. Bbq sauce was incredibly sweet and drowned out the flavor of fresh, well prepared mahi.

Better the devil you know, right? \u00a0So Cabo was the answer.Got talking to our waiter (also the bartender as our table was next to the bar) and I mentioned that as much as I'd wanted to love Cabo, so far I'd been greatly underwhelmed and I asked for suggestions. \u00a0Immediately he suggested the Tavarua Tuna tacos.. And I regretted asking lol. \u00a0See, I don't do meat/fish with fruit. \u00a0Of any kind, ever. \u00a0I greatly dislike sweet and sour food combos, I don't like sweet elements in a savory dish. \u00a0Tavarua Taco has all of these elements - blackened, lemon rubbed wahoo (blackened=strike 1 for me) in a kiwi-pineapple marinade (strike 2) with a honey-wasabi sauce (definite strike 3 for me).Grudgingly I ordered a Tavarua Taco along with my Carne Asada taco figuring at least I knew the steak would be ok as I've had it in the past.In a word, WOW. \u00a0I started with the Tavarua Tuna and honestly, I'm not sure I've ever eaten anything tastier. \u00a0WOW. \u00a0I now know fully why people RAVE about this place.. If you've been unimpressed, I promise you're ordering wrong! \u00a0The GM came past our table to ask how we were enjoying our meal and I told him how..bland our past experiences were (I've always had either the carne Asada tacos or the beer battered fish tacos - and he agreed with me that it is fairly easy to get a better beer battered fish taco elsewhere, but that's not what they're about and often people are disappointed thinking the fried fish taco is a \"signature\" dish, when the reality is the fresh grilled fish and all the clean flavors are the star of the show.Genuinely, I could eat there everyday - the Tuna was SO good that the Carne Asada taco afterwards felt like punishment, and I ended up leaving it and the side (spicy avocado pasta salad - tasty!) in favor of ordering and having the room to eat a second Tavarua taco. \u00a0Unbelievable yum.We will be back. \u00a0We will be back often. \u00a0I will be getting the Tavarua tacos, you can bet on it :)"], ["Dylan A.", "Not well prepared, low quality ingredients...I don't get it.

I noticed in the menu, desserts was spelled \"deserts.\" \u00a0I did not order any, but it was not because of the misspelling.

I usually head to Don Pedros or Azteca when the craving for a Nopales burrito hits but this place works just as well.They do good business at lunch, but the space is cavernous, so there's never a wait. Slaw and watery salsa in your face immediately as you sit. Optional white rice, if you ask. They're cool about being picky, so you can request all three sauces on your 'rito, if you'd like, or get fresh AND pickled jalapenos, or add veggies, no cheese, etc. Nothing's particularly deeply flavored or spicy, but for 5 bucks, Margaritas lunch can't be beat."], ["Misha T.", "Their lunch specials are nuts portion wise. From somewhere between $5-7 you can get pretty much a double portion of a lot of mexican standards.

Never have I had anything bad."], ["Cindy S.", "Las Margaritas is known for its fantastic carnitas de puerco, which come in a huge portion size, garnished with such gastronomic delights as pickled red onions and guacamole. I've also really enjoyed most of the vegetarian menu, which is about the same size and selection as many other Mexican restaurants in town. The pollo poblano is wonderfully rich with mole sauce. If you're looking for a cheap dinner, the burrito supremo with either chicken or ground beef is the way to go; it's big and topped with tomatoes, cheese, and guacamole.Lunch is cheap, delicious, and generous. It's the only time they offer the delicious avocado tostada. You can get the lunch specials on weekends, which more places should do.The decor is bright, with an open-ductwork ceiling that has been painted the same yellow as the walls. Recently I noticed they've hung some sombreros from the ceiling in between the lights. The overall effect is festive and feels more open than it really is.Portion sizes are downright majestic on many of the entrees. It's not the most authentic Mexican food around (for one thing, they use a lot of yellow cheese), but it's delicious and served by a friendly and attentive wait staff. They're quick to offer seemingly endless refills of the free chips, salsa, and a pico de gallo that I want to just eat up with a spoon all by itself."], ["Jon W.", "I have been to this place at least 50 times. While they are not my favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte, (that would be Monterrey at Windsor Square), they are still good. Las Margaritas is only a few blocks from my work place, so it is one of my regular lunch places. The food is good and their prices are great. They have over 20 lunch items all around $6. They give you tons of food even at lunch. (Compared to Monterrey, who's lunch portion is about half the size of dinner.) The staff is always very friendly and service is good. A few issues I have are 1) sometimes their shredded chicken can be a little tough, I think sometimes they don't shred it enough. 2) The orange cheese (cheddar I guess) , though I have learned to live with it. 3) Salsa is so so but I do like their pico.My favorite dishe is the Chilaquiles. It is tortilla chips cooked with some kind of sauce with shredded chicken and some sort of white cheese. Doesn't sound that good, but it is delicious. Love the vegetarian burrito, the enchiladas (ground beef), Pollo con arroz and Carnitas. Because I normally only eat lunch here, I can't really judge the more expensive entrees.Overall, large portions of good food, for a reasonable price, served by friendly staff.

It was near my best friend's home, and a huge group of us went one day. I wasn't an adventurous eater then, so I ordered something that looked pretty tame. I had the nacho cheese burritos, with chicken. That was in 2001 and for the past 12 years I have ordered the same thing every time I visit. There is a short list of \"must visit\" places every time we go home, and Miguel's is #1 on that list. When you pull into their gravel parking lot, look past the outside of the building and it's location. When you get inside, look past the decor & the cracked, red vinyl booths. Take a seat (there is no host/hostess, just sit where you want), dive in to the chips and salsa (I could eat their salsa with a spoon!) and get ready to enjoy a truly delicious meal. This visit Graham & I both began our meal with a margarita. We were heading to a movie after dinner, so I got a small one. If you're not going to sit through a three hour, really depressing musical (Les Miserables... really good, though) order a pitcher. They had them on special that night and it the pitcher was cheaper than what we spent on the drinks we ordered. Graham thought his was weak, and ordered an extra shot of tequila, I thought mine was perfect. We devoured two baskets of chips and salsa while waiting for our meal. Finally, it arrived. We were starving, and of course this was the one time that the service was slow. But our food came out and it was worth the wait. I know the burritos don't look like much... but oh baby.The cheese sauce is absolutely delicious, and the inside of the burrito is stuffed with huge chunks of chicken, bell peppers, tomatoes & onions. Every single bite is delicious. I was craving some black beans too, so I ordered a dish on the side. Black beans are usually pretty bland at most restaurants, and these were too. But a spoonful of the delicious salsa and some salt worked wonders. Graham is a little more diverse in his meal selections than I am. I find something I like, and I tend to stick with it. He typically gets something different each time. This time he ordered the Enchiladas De Chorizo. This was excellent. The chorizo was perfectly cooked and really flavorful. Miguel's is truly on my list of my favorite restaurants of all time. The food is delicious, the service is quick and the staff is always pleasant. The same people have worked there forever, and back when I still lived in Charlotte and ate there every week, my server would bring me a sweet tea without even asking.

They use shredded chicken but it actually had flavor as was cooked with onions and peppers. My husband got a pork dish and really enjoyed it. He suggested the homemade hot sauce. We topped it off with sopilla which you can't go wrong! Overall was good food.

But it was all good when I got inside.I ordered the Quesadilla Rellino (sp) and a side order of guacamole. Of course the guac came out first and maybe its because I make a mean guacamole but this was a watered down avocado mousse with very little seasoning. I had to ask for a lime and shake some s&p before I could convince myself to eat it. Not okay!! My quesadilla however was awesome!! The chicken was seasoned so perfectly, I really could have eaten buckets of it. Overall, I will definitely try this place again san guacamole."], ["Shawn S.", "Excellent 'Dive-Mex'. \u00a0Easy to eat lunch for \u00a0less than $5. \u00a0Plenty of outdoor seating when the weather is warm"], ["Chris P.", "Definitely the best part of the day after being screwed by the airlines.

This was 5 min from my airport hotel. The chimichangas had moist, tender chicken with onions and peppers. The tortillas had a nice delicate crunch and savor under a generous helping of guacamole and sour cream. The refried beans were earthy.

Service was a bit indifferent for me - otherwise the food is 5 stars."], ["Curtis M.", "Mixed review: chips and salsa were good, atmosphere good. I was told by my party that the chicken was good in the enchilada. My food, vegetarian burrito/cheese enchilada combo, was really basic and had no imagination in flavor.

Outdoor seating option was cool and it was very popular."], ["David C.", "So unbelievably good! Had an overnight layover in Charlotte and the shuttle driver recommend this place. So glad I listened! The food was outstanding, employees very friendly, decor so cutie, and service was very quick. The menu was huge. Around 8 pages.

That was pretty good. The second time I brought my wife and we ordered the special Steak Burrito plate. We also ordered guacamole on the side. Nothing was authentic and nothing was fresh.

I tried the spicy beef instead and loaded it with pico de gallo, guac, garlic mushrooms, rice, and cilantro on a whole wheat tortilla. The end result was absolutely delicious. The beef was juicy and flavorful with a nice kick to it. Everything meshed really well and there was just so much flavor to it all. It was indeed sloppy to eat so I highly recommend asking for a plate and getting a knife and fork to dive into it. The chips and guac are also dirt cheap and makes for a nice afternoon snack.

I thought if you ordered a burrito it would just come with everything on it that was listed, but it's just a typical conveyer belt like ordering counter. You have to ask for all the toppings individually. It also set me off that the only types of cheese they have are, feta, mozzarella, and nacho cheese sauce? How is this an \"authentic californoa burrito\" without jack or cojita cheese? After my confusion at the counter, I finally got my bean, rice, and cheese burrito. Meh! That's it. Absolutely no flavor with the rice or beans, and the tortillas aren't fresh. I thought the only saving grace would be the salsa bar, but each salsa was just as bland as the next. They had no flavor, and no spice. What's the point of having a salsa bar if they all taste the same? My husband got the tofu burrito (we are both vegetarian), and it was the worst cooked tofu we've ever had. If you are vegetarian DO NOT get the tofu burrito, it is wet and slimy. Terrible texture, and as bland as the rest of the meal. I'm willing to give this place another shot based on all the amazing reviews, but I have a feeling this is not a good place for a vegetarian. Even with all the veggie options, it's not worth it. If the rice and beans are flavorless, even if I order another dish I'm worried it's not going to get better. This place might have great meat dishes, but based on the flavor and quality of ingredients, this is in NO WAY \"California style burritos\". This is just another americanized, bland, burrito joint. Nothing special."], ["Tony M.", "This is my first time here. Was in the area figured I'd try it. Customer service is 10 out of 10. Salsa bar has about 7 selections nothing too spicy but good flavor.

The menu is pretty straight forward and on par with what you would probably be expecting to see, but both of the burritos we ordered were great - and huge.

Thank God for Yelp. 4.5 stars strong? I had to come see what all the fuss is about.Dollar tacos on Tuesdays? Yes please! They do beef, pork, and chicken options for the special. I went with two spicy chicken and a beef. Sidenote: the woman in front of me got a salad. Listen honey, you're doing Tuesdays wrong. I love the long laundry list of toppings you can choose from here. I can't really think of anyone else who does this. I was really impressed by the size of the tacos. At a lot of places, a Taco Tuesday special is pretty skimpy. Not here. My tacos were loaded. Another bonus: THEY HAVE A SALSA BAR!! You know my motto, all places should have a salsa bar. Hell, I would put one in my living room if my roommate would let me. Wonder what she would do if she came home one night to find a salsa bar in place of the coffee table? My tacos came with free chips, so I was super happy to try #allthesauces. It was pretty warm in there for lunch, but it was 103 degrees outside. Every place in Charlotte is warm right now in this heatwave. I didn't mind it a bit. I enjoyed eating my lunch alone and watching all the action in the restaurant. All the workers were really nice. There was a pretty steady stream of people coming in and out for lunch. I don't live near here anymore, but I will definitely be coming back. It's well worth the drive. My only regret is that I never gave this place a chance sooner. However, that may be a good thing or else I would weigh 300 pounds. \u00a0Kudos, Burrito Factory. I really dig what you guys are doing here."], ["Anthony B.", "REALLY good shrimp burrito.

I was in the area a couple of weeks ago and thanks to my yelp app, I saw that BF was literally a hop, skip and jump from my location. I went in and noticed that the place was empty which may have had something to do with the fact that they had a sign posted on the door stating their A/C was down (mind you, this was during one of our heat wave weeks). I looked at the menu really quickly and decided to go with the juicy chicken burrito.What I immediately found odd was that I couldn't see any of the ingredients. I had to rely on the list that was posted on the plexi glass in front. Maybe they were keeping the ingredients covered due to the inside conditions (no A/C and all) but I was really turned off by that. I like to be able to see what I'm choosing! The guy who was working behind the counter was very friendly and made sure that I was aware of all my meal and sides options.However, I wasn't all that satisfied with the taste of the burrito. I couldn't place the whether the 'different' taste I experienced was in the tortilla or rice but I was not a fan.

However, I wasn't crazy about a lot of the sauce and salsa options and that's an important part of a burrito. They have several different hot sauces so I was initially pretty excited when I saw the salsa bar but I had trouble finding one I really liked. They all had a strange creamy taste to them and none of them were really spicy. The habanero one is the best (you have to ask for this one) but I've had better habanero sauces before.

I chose the lime mint dressing for my salad, which blended well with the flames shooting from my bowl. The only complaint I had was that the lettuce could have been cut smaller or maybe shredded. Otherwise, my salad was far better than the other Mexican places we have tried. My wife's burrito was huge, she only finished half, she took the rest home with most of her tortilla chips.

I was so excited to not only have a place with several delicious homemade salsas - some without Cilantro - HALLELUJAH!!, but also California style burritos that as far as I know aren't anywhere else in town. For me, the most exciting thing was that they had Sopes. Not sopa (soup) but Sopes, which is kind of like an ultra thick corn tortilla fried which is used as a base like a tostada. It's only made in certain parts of Mexico, so until now, most of the Mexicans who owned restaurants in Charlotte were from non-sopes territory apparently. At the factory, they top their sopes with spiced pulled chicken on top of the beans and I usually like mine with ground beef, but they're so nice I'm sure they'd customize. They also had a number of really good looking salads that I will definitely try. Even their chips are delicious, and their tomatillo salsa and an orange creamy chipotle sauce is to die for. In addition, they had flavored waters (like uncarbonated soda) and the pina colada was really delicious. We got a horchata to go as a dessert. :)It's exactly what you want a burrito place to be - fresh ingredients, unique combinations, great salsas, fair prices and delicious salsas. Perfecto!

You can put basically anything you want on them to build your own and that's awesome!! The burritos are okay. We've tried the steak fajita, the chicken, and the california wet burritos. The first two lacked any kind of real flavor. No spices or salt or anything else appeared to have been used. However these burritos are packed full of ingredients and they don't skimp. The California wet burrito is better but again just okay. They give you salsa, and they have these other sauces. The orangeish looking sauce is my boyfriends favorite. He always wants me to order extra extra of that stuff as he can't get enough. It will save the burritos lol!! The plantains are good (hard to mess that up) and the queso is good but could use jalapenos in my opinion. We order delivery from them frequently and the poor delivery guy apparently has issues. He's really nice but sometimes I feel like he lacks awareness. He's delivered to us like 4 maybe 5 times and he still calls to ask exactly where our complex is because it doesn't show up on his GPS. I really am going to need him to update his GPS or use google maps!! However our food still always arrives pretty hot so that's a plus, the negative is my sour cream arrived melted into a soup so I just don't order it anymore lol.

The portions must have changed too. Like I mentioned, they were good sized and I left with a too-full belly. The veggie burrito was huge and around $5...for dinner! The salsas were good, chips fresh, and I really liked the individual salsa cups with a mini jar to pour your own. I really liked the bright colors and the art on the booths; it made the ambiance cheerful. The service was very friendly too. Need to catch up on a novela? It's playing in the corner. If you are in need of some chicle, you're in luck, they have that at the cash register. Tip: No rush to pay, just go to the register when you're ready. What a difference a year makes!

When I come here, I purchase carnitas, barbacoa, queso fresco, tortillas, and salsa. \u00a0For $12, or thereabouts, one can make enough food to feed five or six people very well.Another suggestion is to stop at the nearby Compare supermarket on North Tryon, and purchase at least two or three ripe avocados. I have never found Hass avocados cheaper than at this Compare supermarket. I add sliced avocado and sour cream to the above ingredients, and the carnitas are heavenly.PS: I take the huge portion of left over tortillas, cut them into quarters, and fry them in peanut oil on the stove top over medium to medium high heat. I sprinkle them with garlic salt as they come out of he oil. I pair the fresh tortilla chips with salsa or guac., or whatever foods that need some added crunch."]], "Azteca Mexican Restaurant": [["Wei L.", "Got very full eating here. Food was great.

Chips and dip were served when we sat down but instead of red and white sauce we got red sauce and Cole slaw. Kind of interesting for a Mexican restaurant. My dining companion had chicken fajitas, I had the chicken taco salad. The fajitas were very well prepared and the chicken was delicious. The taco salad was not very good. Chicken tasted funny and was served with cheddar cheese instead of the typical Mexican cheese which mixed differently with the chicken.

It's basically ceviche with no meat. I ordered carnitas. Pork of course-they offer beef and chicken carnitas, which is weird. The portions are very large and come on a huge plate. Rice and beans were as expected (surprisingly they are sub-par at a lot of places-not here). Carnitas normally are hewn from a large roast (can be fried). They serve 1\"cubes. Not really traditional. Pretty good flavor, but if you like carnitas, these won't satisfy. Served with pickled onions. Good but odd. Should be lots of fresh onions and cilantro. \u00a0Also, there was more slaw, and excellent nopal (cactus) salad.

The food is delicious and the portions are huge for the price you pay. Service is always friendly and prompt. The restaurant is hopping on a Friday or Saturday night, and it's always a fun place to hang out. The mariachi band that plays on the weekend is a blast. On one of our last visits, they asked us if we wanted them to play us a song. We said sure, but we didn't know which one, so we suggested they play us their favorite song.

The staff are friendly and they especially warm-up if you speak Spanish. We ordered the \"Macho\" and veggie fajitas. Very good and large portions! We also ordered the fresh guacamole since many of the previous reviews raved about this. Even though it was delicious, I thought it was a tad pricey ($7 for one avocado) after thinking it was only $3 (I guess I mis-read the menu). The salsa was on the watery side and I'm accustomed to the chunkier, but it was still good. As we were leaving, a table was having a birthday and it was such a fun site to see! Most of the staff came out singing and sombreros in hand. At the end of the birthday song, one of the waiters got up on a chair and was pretending to do a little strip-tease with his apron.

However, it was worth the wait....The restaurant week menu offered A LOT of food plus a margarita for $30/person. The drink special was the No Name margarita (very good!) with offering of four other courses. First course was choice of queso (beef, white, or yellow) - my table ordered each one since there were three of us. ALL GOOD!Second course offered choice of pork nachos or guacamole. Two of us ordered the guac, which is prepared table-side with choice of it being smooth/creamy or chunky and level of spice. I asked for chunky guac and for it to be made 'medium' but I didn't really taste much spice.Third course was choice of tacos, various enchiladas, or fajitas. I went for the three tacos (get choice of tortilla): Shrimp, fish, and turkey club tacos. The shrimp taco was my favorite with choice of beans and rice.For dessert, choice of tres leches cake or brownies with strawberries. I went for the brownies.With all of the choices offered, you would think the portion sizes would suffer but they did not. Everything was delicious and generously sized.

I added some delicious Chili con Queso and voila, excellent way to start off the lunch.My friendly waiter made some recommendations and I went with them. He suggested the slow braised beef brisket, and I also selected a chicken fried steak taco. Man both were really excellent! Very flavorful with sweet/heat contrasting flavors. But while i knew the brisket taco would be good, the chicken fried steak was even BETTER! Halleluiah! Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Highly recommend this one!Oh and the beans. Can forget about the charro beans. They have brisket in them with onions. Very savory and tasty. The only negatives was that the rice was average and the cole slaw sucked.

Menu wise, I think I get something different each visit based on what I'm craving. I'm a big fan of the Classic Tex-Mex enchiladas. I mean, how can you go wrong with something covered in chili and cheese? Chuy's also does daily specials and has different drink deals each week night. I've always had great service and everyone is so nice here. It's hard not to smile when you're here. It's just a fun and happy place."], ["Michelle L.", "Funky d\u00e9cor. \u00a0Large patio space. \u00a0Found myself here mid-week happy hour time and didn't want dinner, but a margarita and an app sounded good. \u00a0Service was good; I can't remember the guy's name but he was friendly and funny and attentive. I had something about a Grandma's margarita - it was good, nothing spectacular, but good.The 3 stars is for my nachos. \u00a0It was a fried tortilla sliced up 6 (or 8?) pieces, with canned refried beans smothering it, a splash of cheese and a couple diced tomatoes with (more) canned jalape\u00f1os. In the center was a dab of guac on some lettuce. \u00a0It just looked sad. \u00a0We asked for sour cream and got a spoonful in a bowl - no seriously I'll post a pic. \u00a0I took the pic just in case they upcharge for condiments, which I'm happy to report they did not charge us for the spoonful. The server wanted to warn us the sirloin was ground, and I assumed it would be ok but this stuff wasn't even the consistency of ground. \u00a0How could you ruin good steak by grinded it to itty bitty specks of nothing??? If I go again, it likely will be for another rita, but I'm pretty sure I can find a better deal elsewhere"], ["Lisa C.", "We had just returned from out of town and I was craving Mexican but the man wanted to watch the game. We decided to use Eat24 to order Chuys and unfortunately we both agreed we should have starved instead of ordering from them. But to back it up let me mention that I was super excited for my Elvis combo. I wanted to try a little bit of everything with all the meats! I also ordered a soup because I love tortilla soup and I am pretending it is fall already so it is prime soup season! The man ordered a chicken \"big as yo' face\" burrito.Now it probably wasn't the restaurant's fault that we waited for 2 hours before our lukewarm food showed up. However we were getting 'hangry' by the time it showed up only to find we had the completely incorrect order! Ugh! Since the receipt for what we ordered was in the bag of different food I think I can put this one on the restaurant. So this review is for the random food items we received.Nachos - the chips were super-duper salty and the salsa with them was not impressive. Whoever ordered them left off the cheese and beans which would have made it better I think. The chicken fajita burrito that we received had a couple pieces of chicken and a little bit of cheese. The rest was all beans. If you want a bean burrito definitely order this item, but not if you want chicken. I had the unfortunate experience of the veggie enchilada which had very few vegetables or cheese and a semi spicy sauce but was mostly tortilla. The best part of the meal was what I think was the deluxe tomatillo sauce. Thank you random stranger for ordering this it made eating everything much better! Now all of this would have probably warranted a 2 rating except for a couple things. First, Chuy's charges a \"packaging fee\" for to go orders. I didn't see any mention of this anywhere on their website. Hidden fees are not cool! The other reason for the low rating is that both of us had upset stomachs after eating our various items."], ["Abby L.", "The environment is very welcoming and happy. I tried this place because they always bring free food into my work. I absolutely love their salsa! So fresh and spicy! They food is never disappointing. Very good spicy ranch sauce also.

ORDER IT!) and queso.. \u00a0I usually eat so much I have no room for anything else.. \u00a0But we are going to pack this in like golf through a straw! \u00a0I then prepare myself for a Chuychanga (a fried chicken burrito?!?!?!) which usually comes out so fast that I'm not ready for it. \u00a0If you're craving Mexican food and live in SC ..... \u00a0This place is a must try! \u00a0Because if you had Mexican food in SC .. \u00a0Your judgement on Mexican food is very cloudy and I understand why it wouldn't be your first choice. \u00a0But I guarantee you that you have been missing out on this your entire life! \u00a0Nooooow go get you some!"], ["Corey Tess T.", "Mexican cafe with lively atmosphere and decent pricing. This place was not at all what I expected from the outside. I used to come here when it was a place called M. It was totally totally different then. \u00a0Anyway, it's now a very very bright and colorful Mexican cafe. Enchiladas with Boom Boom Sauce and Mango Margaritas were good. I think I'd like to come back in summer and sit on the huge patio. Really good Tres Leches cake too.I just can't get over the interior though - I think the lighting is just SO BRIGHT, they would do themselves a favor to get a lighting scheme designer to come in and adjust things a bit - make it less of a cafeteria. It reminds me of a place in California - Chevy's... same sort of set up and theme. Lots of families and kids. No sense of intimacy - so not a date spot for sure - a good casual place to chill after shopping at the Pottery Barn though.. The server we had was a little sleepy but he was nice. I think he needed a nap though."], ["Natalie S.", "Authentic Mexican food! A friend claimed this was the best Mexican food in Charlotte - and he might be right. As soon as we sat down, they served us an endless amount of chips + salsa. The chips were thin and fresh and the salsa had a bit of a kick. We ordered the queso and Mmmm, so good. If you're deciding between the house margarita and the Texas martini - go Texas!! Same price and you get much more bang for your buck. I was most excited about my main course - the southwestern plate. so good!! A sunny side egg on top of soft blue tortillas filled with pulled chicken pulled chicken, topped \u00a0with an impeccable sauce. Comes with rice, beans and a little bit of lettuce. So authentic and fresh!"], ["Saniqua P.", "If you get a kick out of all things kitsch then you will probably enjoy the d\u00e9cor at Chuy's. Personally, I'm a little confused by it because it's a mix of American diner circa 1950's, a helping of Elvis memorabilia, and various Mexican accoutrements scattered throughout. Their outdoor patio has a completely different feel with it being adorned by tall tulip figures. I like their outdoor patio better and prefer sitting out there over the very busy inside.I've been to Chuy's a couple times and am always pleased with their service. The wait staff is very friendly and willing to offer suggestions and accommodate any changes to the meals/drinks, if need be. You start off with complimentary chips & salsa. The salsa is a little on the watery side but packs a silent punch when it comes to the heat. The chips are light and not too greasy, have a nice crunch. This go round, I decided to give their blackberry margarita a try. According to our waitress, Meaghann, the blackberry marg is specifically made with top-shelf liquor. The house margaritas run $6 (they're served on the rocks or frozen) and the blackberry margarita runs $9 and is only served on the rocks, so keep that in mind if you're looking to drink at certain price. I found the blackberry margarita to be all right but it wasn't too strong on the blackberry flavor. I could tell it was made was some sort of artificial flavoring.Each time I've been to Chuy's, I usually order some sort of enchilada. To me, nothing pairs better with a margarita then a cheesy, loaded enchilada or taco. I decided to try one of the combinations (which are a great deal and good way to try other types of things) - the #4 with your choice of enchilada and relleno. FYI: a relleno is a stuffed pepper. I got the chicka boom enchilada (trust me, I felt just as silly saying it as I did typing it out) with green pepper sauce and a cheese-filled relleno. The relleno was fried and coated in two types of sauces plus a drizzle of sour cream. Because of all that, I didn't really taste much of the pepper. The enchilada was delicious and I wish I had ended up ordering two of those instead of the relleno. The standard sides of refried beans and rice were good as well.Since Cowfish (which is located next door) is crowded quite regularly, Chuy's is a good alternative and encourages you to have a little bit of fun with your meal."], ["Chris S.", "Zip-A-Dee-Do-Da it's a wonderful day -- the day I stepped inside a Chuy's for the first time! It's colorful and inviting. Our waiter could not have been more upbeat and helpful. They even have a free mother-slapping NACHO BAR!!!! The colors and smells and sights, they combine for a delightful time. I went with friends so it was even more enjoyable.I ordered the Elvis Presley combination and had no idea how giant it would actually be -- not to mention is was only $11 and change.I almost forgot to mention the amazing ranch/jalape\u00f1o dip -- I need an intravenous drip of the stuff because it's THAT good. So, yourself a flavor and find a Chuy's. They're even changing the way I think about chain restaurants -- maybe."], ["Jessica M.", "I love this place usually. However tonight when I along with 4 others dined we didn't have great service. Our server wasn't the friendliest. He tried to talk one of us out of getting an item. An item that he always gets. Then when we asked for an empty to go cup to pour our left over dressing we were told that would be a $1.35 charge. That is beyond ridiculous. I can not believe that we were charged for an empty to go cup. That blows my mind. I have never been charged to take home something I've already purchased. Very disappointed in this trip to chuys. Let's hope I come back."], ["Kelly C.", "I came out for dinner last night and had the deluxe quesadilla. My friend (10 year old Layla) had the 3 soft shell tacos, refried beans and rice. The queso was an excellent decision and Meg came around to refill our chips before we ran out. Everything was delicious - but let's talk about our server Meg for a second. She was awesome! Super friendly, energetic and helpful. Not once did we have to ask for anything, she was on top of extra napkins, drink refills and drinks to go! Meg really made our visit wonderful, and I highly recommend her. She bumped it up from 4 stars to 5 stars."], ["Hania A.", "Best Mexican in Charlotte! \u00a0We loved the chicka chicka boom boom.

My first trip to Chuys was a complete disaster and left me really hating the restaurant but a unique circumstance brought us back for a second visit and I've been happy ever since. The chips are light and crunchy, the salsa is sweet with a touch of spicy, and the jalapeno ranch is so good I would take a bath in it.

We were greeted \u00a0and seated immediately. As you walk in you'll noticed a mixture of 50's diner furniture, some fun paintings, patio lights and Mexican mosaic tile patterns. What really makes it stand out to me though is the tortilla station. Literally someone was making fresh tortilla for your meal. The results of the freshly made tortilla? Superb. The salsa tasted so fresh and the flavors were great. I thought it was a bit on the salty side but still delicious. I was a little disappointed that they do not serve my favorite Mexican drink. Horchata! It is a refreshing cold drink made of rice, almonds, cinnamon, lime zest and sugar. Even though the drink has a milky appearance it is completely dairy-free. At least the manager or owner came out and apologize. She wish she knew the ingredients so they could provide that to customers who knows their stuff. ;) I was starting to think there wasn't any great Mexican restaurants around the Charlotte area. Then this place said \"No Wendy, come to us and we will change your mind...\" \u00a0and guess what? It did.

Felt like I was in paradise with the palm trees! We started off with the usual chips and salsa (which the salsa was amazing!). I had the chile relleno, and my goodness it was one of the yummiest cheesy goodness I've ever had! The crusted and fried chiles were stuffed with the perfect balance of cheese, meat (I think I asked for chicken?) and yummy brown sauce (I don't recall what it was...just how good it was!). Got two filling meals out of my one dish! Next time I'm in the Southpark area, I'm definitely going back!"], ["Candyce B.", "So I finally made it over to Chuy's!Right away I noticed the d\u00e9cor.

Our waiter was pleasant and quick; he gave us plenty of time to look over the menu and informed that we had arrived during their \"happy hour\" so there were chips, queso and beef available in the back! It's been discussed enough in all the previous reviews, so I'll just say I enjoyed it very much! But I'm a sucker for unlimited queso and chips! For my meal I went with Combination #1, which is a ridiculous amount of food! It comes with comes with enchiladas, chicken flautas, a taco, guacamole and chips dipped in chile con queso. It was all very tasty but my favorite parts hands down were the chicken flautas. They were crispy goodness. I could have had an entire plate of them! Yum! Overall, the prices weren't bad and the portion sizes are good so I can see myself coming back!"], ["Shakira D.", "The place was good. Different from any Mexican restaurant I've ate at. It seems they actually make their own house salsa. I think the refried beans must be house made not the typical retried beans I see/eat at the other Mexican restaurants that looks like the mush from the can. I also tried enchiladas for the first time. I can't remember they exact name but it was chicken with a cheese sauce. I would order again.

Food was ok but service was terrible. Apps and food came out at the same time. And too fast to be fresh. Our waiter was frantic and inattentive. He didn't bring water or napkins. He tried to clear the table while we were still eating. He was fast at bringing the check. He seemed like he just wanted us to get of there. He never offered coffee or dessert.

They've done a nice job of revamping the joint so that it looks nothing like Zink - though Zink was actually a pretty decent place (especially that patio!) before.On the inside, you have trees, and noise and kids and, like others have side, IT IS LOUD.

Gluten-free menu.\" What the heckity heck does that mean? As I scanned down the list, I could have one menu item, no sauce. Regardless of whether or not you are gluten-free, the fact that everything on their menu contains gluten in some form or other - rice, sauces, sides - is a pretty big indicator that you are getting absolutely nothing fresh. Except avocado. I could have a freshly pitted avocado for dinner. As my kids were about to munch into some tortilla chips the waitress casually mentioned ... \"The chips aren't gluten-free either.\" Sooo... I think we're done here.

I was super excited to try the new Park Road location and even more excited that they were opening for weekend brunch, but this experience was one miss after another. I'm hoping it's just because they're in a new location and trying to get acclimated, but...We got there on a Sunday at 9:00 am when they open, and I wasn't sure we'd walked in the correct door because there was a ladder in the lobby and numerous cardboard boxes, and construction workers were milling around. A guy walked up to me, and I asked if they were open; he said they were, gave us his name (but I still have no idea if was the owner, manager, etc.), and proceeded to take us on a tour of the new location. Call me cranky, but it's early on a Sunday morning, and I haven't had any coffee - just seat me and feed me! He let us pick where to sit, which some might appreciate, but I can't make decisions before coffee, and the new location is so huge, I felt overwhelmed. He also came over again mid-meal to tell the fella how they have TVs and the NFL Sunday Ticket in case he's into football or fantasy football. Our waiter was super weird. He kept trying to pronounce the words on the menu in Spanish (being funny?), so he asked us how we liked the \"Mehican\" food and tried rolling his r's. It was awkward to say the least. He rarely made eye contact with us because he was watching the TV over our shoulder. He also never refilled our drinks, and when I finally asked about more coffee, he forgot. I waited and waited, and when I finally saw him again, he told me they were out of coffee and it was brewing. This was at 9:25 when they'd been open for 25 minutes, there were literally 4 people in the place, and one of them - the fella - wasn't even drinking coffee. The cup he finally brought me was so bad I couldn't even drink it. Thankfully the waitress for other couple saw that we were out of water and refilled that.Onto the food... I got the Mexican Lager Pancakes with bananas, scrambled eggs, and bacon. The bacon was way spicier than I'd planned on, but the pancakes were good. The banana slices come in the batter (much like they do other places), but our waiter made a scene out of yelling to the kitchen staff that there were no bananas, and then he made me cut into my pancakes to prove that they were in there. For. The. Love. The fella got the Chorizo Burrito, which was deliciousy cheesy. Oddly enough, our waiter brought chips and salsa to our table... at 9:00 a.m.Alllll that said, the new location is bright and spacious, and I'm glad for the ample parking.

Went on a Saturday and it was packed, so we sat at the bar, that had plenty of empty seats. The bar tender was very attentive, making the guacamole by hand in our presence. Throughout the meal, she check on us consistently and even offered advice about the menu. I had the salmon, which came with potatoes and spinach. The salmon was smaller than what I expected, but was really tasty and ended up being filling. So I guess the proportions were adequate after all. My friend, who is a vegetarian had the wild mushroom quesadillas and she liked them a lot. The guac that came with them was small compared to the amount of quesadilla. So I would ask for heavy guac if you order a quesadilla. Additionally, I had the house margarita. Tasty and I had a little buzz.

Not as great as people make it seem. We went on a Friday night and we expected it to be packed but it wasn't so we were happy because we had forgotten to make reservations. The inside is beautiful and it's definitely a great place to go have drinks and socialize with friends. But as soon as they sat us down, that's when it all went downhill. Our server was horrible! He took our drink order and after bringing us our drinks, he then took our food order. Little did we know, we were not gonna see him again. Waited 15mins, there was no sign of him. We needed a refill with our drinks and we needed refills on the chips and salsa. Where did our server go? Who knows. We waited patiently another 5 mins, and didn't understand where he went because it was not even a busy night at all. After waiting a total of 20mins, my friend for whom we were taking out to celebrate her birthday got up, walked up to another server and asked her to come refill our drinks and to bring the manager as well. When the manager arrived, he was very professional about the whole situation and apologized for our server, and gave us a discount which we were not expecting at all. I don't remember the name of the manager but he was tall, brown hair and had glasses. Only thing that bothered us was that even though we had already spoken to the manager, our servers attitude did not change. He continued to do his own thing, refilled our drinks one time again after we got our food and didn't come back to the table until it was time to give us the bill. But get this, the whole time that he didn't come to our table, we definitely saw him going to his other tables, which I thought was very rude. He walked right passed us and couldn't even ask if we needed anything or see if things were okay. Service definitely needs improvement!Now onto our meals, it was good but not spectacular. I was expecting a lot more from this place since there was a few good reviews about it on yelp. Don't expect authentic food, this is more American tex-mex. As for the prices of meals, they were more on the pricier side. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind paying $20 for an entree but if it's just some tacos on a plate that taste like any other place I don't think it's worth it. I won't say I'll never come back, cause I will. Every place deserves a second chance but the second time will be for drinks and tapas. So because of the way the manager handled the situation in a well mannered way, I give this place a 2 star."], ["Craig M.", "Table-side guacamole is fantastic.

I find those places a little better since there are more options. For example, as a vegetarian, at Moe's in a burrito I can opt to choose tofu instead of meat and also put in mixed cooked veggies like peppers and onions. Picante does not have a tofu option. I saw a man making peppers, but it was not available when we ordered so I cannot speak to it being available. Also chips and salsa are not included, they are extra. \u00a0Now, on to the positive feedback- the burrito itself was pretty good. I ordered a vegetarian burrito with a spinach wrap, white rice, black beans, lettuce, tomato, corn salsa, cheese, guacamole, cilantro, black olives, onions and pico de gallo salsa. It was decent sized and tasty. Went on a Tuesday/yesterday, which has specialty pricing- $5 burritos and $2 tacos.

If you are a fan of Chipotle, Qdoba and Moe's, then you'll probably like Picante. The chicken, steak, shredded beef, and fish are really good. They occasionally introduce specials and new items to the menu too (buffalo chicken or philly cheesesteak burritos).

The veggies here looked nicer than other chain places.On to the dislikes... $1.60 extra to put Guacamole on your burrito ...what?! To be fair they were nice enough to put a little scoop on me for free because management saw me say noooo thank you. Also, I couldn't taste the herbs in the chicken and my rice was a bit tough (even for brown) as I was served the last scoop in the container. The food wasn't terrible but it wasn't really good either. My hope is that they will put a little zing into the food to separate it from the competition.

Can't wait to go back! Thanks!"], ["Catherine G.", "Tonight was my first time at Sabor Latin. Overall: Delicious food, friendly service, and a great locale. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the margaritas were a little weak (in that they were lacking tequila). But other than that, everything was perfect! We started out with the queso, which was the perfect consistency and temperature, then we had guac and a papusa, both of which were really tasty. We had tacos authenticos and nachos for dinner and were really pleased with the whole experience. Oh, and don't forget about the salsa bar! They have several different kinds of salsa, including some salsas for spicy food fiends like myself. It was awesome!This is definitely our new neighborhood mexican joint, and I would highly recommend it to others."], ["Sydney A.", "I went back to Sabor again this week to introduce my boyfriend to the best tacos in town and we were not disappointed! \u00a0He and I have now agreed that the Arepa is the best item on the menu that we have tried thus far.I raved and raved about the pineapple salsa in my last review, but on this trip it wasn't nearly as good. \u00a0I could tell immediately that the color was different. \u00a0The first time we went it was white and looked almost like queso. \u00a0It was chilled and sweet with a touch of heat. \u00a0This past time it was the color of applesauce and SUPER spicy. \u00a0I mean, really really spicy. \u00a0The good news is that we know they must make it fresh.

Just make sure you order a few so that you don't have to share.The Carne Asada fries: delicious! I can't believe we are here a few times before discovering these, but they're now my go-to.

Wow, let me tell you about this place.First when we walked in it was SLAMMED. It has to be good right? So there is an extensive menu of all kinds of things, burritos, tacos.. and huge nacho plates and other mex dish menu. As I was looking at the menu and the surrounding patrons I see that most of the best choice to get was tacos. LOL, not sure if it was on sale or what, but hey, I'll be part of the incrowd.I got 2 beef and 1 chicken taco with a side of guac and cheese dip and their homemade salsa. The guac was so creamy and chunky with the fresh ingredients . I loved the embrace that this place has to cilantro. I LOVE cilantro. Tacos had them on it, and if you even wanted extra you can ask for it. The dips came with 1 bag of chips for each side. So be prepared to be overloaded with chips for easy dipping. The chips were great! They seemed to have some chili seasoning on them. What make this place so unique than the others? THE SALSA BAR! You have such a huge choice lineup of different salsas depending on what you were in the mood for. There was super hot, hawaian and others that looked awesome. You can put as much as you want into tiny to-go cups for easy transport. **just don't take more than you can eat* \u00a0:)I am highly impressed with this place, and I will be a returning customer, thanks for the great service."], ["Emily P.", "Sabor is across from Hawthorne's Pizza. It has some outdoor seating, but it's limited to the sidewalk. I dig this place because I do feel like its street food but you pop inside and order at a counter and a few minutes later you have your order to eat there or take out. They offer fried plantains, empanadas, burritos, quesadillas and some quinoa bowls and more. I was craving a fish burrito from Phat Burrito but wasn't near by. I got a fish burrito at Sabor instead which was almost as good but it would have been even better with a sweet/spicy fruit salsa. I do dig their salsa bar. They don't mess around. They are nice and spicy and have a few to choose from. They are always fast and friendly and offer beer and will even make you a margarita.

We've hit them up at least once a week since the opening and love it more and more with every visit.They're ran by the same guys as Three Amigos and the menu features normal favorites like burritos, tacos, quesadillas as well as arepas, elote loco, and sabortias.

During my last visit I used the the $7 for $10 yelp special and the free chips check in.For $7 I got two tacos authenticos, a veggie empanada, a side of guacamole, a huge bag of tortilla chips, and about 5 different salsas from the salsa bar. Wow. It was about \u00a02 meals worth of food.Love that Sabor has a private parking spot not too far from uptown. All food is made to order making it a perfect lunch spot. The inside is a little wonky. Not really decorated, an old building, nothing really special. They have $4 mojito specials on Thursday and other weekday specials (see photo).Now for the food. I was a little disappointed with how dry and unflavorful the chicken in my tacos were but with enough salsas smothered on I was pretty delighted.By the time I got to try the empanada it was a little oily/soggy which I cannot blame on Sabor, but was disappointing. Aside from the texture it tasted authentic and was very tasty.The chips and guacamole were delicious! I swear the bag of chips was the same size as a tostitos bag.Overall, 3.5 stars for food and 5 stars for convenience, value, and salsa bar.

While I can't say that for this place but yelp currently doesn't have a 4.5 rating scale so I will be rounding down to 4. The restaurant in itself is a no frills place but what more than makes up for it is the fantastic food. Combining different Latin cultures the menu is a smorgasbord of different cuisines that would satisfy your cravings.We had gluten free and vegan requirements in our group and this place can serve both. Corn tortillas for the gluten free and tofu for vegan option. I myself had the arepa and shredded chicken authenticos taco (which basically is a corn tortilla taco) and it was amazing. The melted cheese and sauces combined with the slow cooked marinated meat made for a great taco! \u00a0They also have a salsa bar for different types and heat levels of salsa.

The meats were seasoned and juicier than last time, everything just tasted so much better together than last time when it seemed a little bland.Again, I'm not saying I had a bad experience the first time I ate, I'm just saying this visit improved on what I had last time."], ["Ryan W.", "Second visit in 3 days because the food is really that good.

Beware if you have extra guac and take it home it will go brown the next day bc it's so fresh!Definitely get the tacos authenticos with steak and fish.

The place is small, easy enough to find but definitely not fancy by any means. But they do have some outdoor seating which would be really nice when it gets a little warmer. The ordering process is easy enough, the menu is listed on two large boards as soon as you walk in, and you simply place your order pay on the iPad and then wait for them to make it. I have to admit that I was pretty bummed I missed Happy Hour (Monday-Friday 3-5pm for $.99 tacos autenticos) but I found the prices here were pretty reasonable. After a quick chat with the guy taking my order and telling him it was my first time and asking for some suggestions I ended up ordering two tacos authenticos (one chicken and one steak), a chicken empanada and an order chips and guacamole. Yep. All that...don't judge me. While I waited for them to get my order ready, I stopped by the salsa bar. It definitely didn't look like some of the pictures I've seen, a lot were either out or in squeezable containers but at least they had the super spicy green one that I'd heard was \u00a0super spicy and delicious. So I helped myself to a container of that and before I knew it my order was ready.Tacos Authenticos: Classic. I preferred the chicken over the steak, but that's just my personal preference. I loved how all the flavors came together (especially the cilantro and lime juice). For an extra kick, add some of that spicy green sauce (which I'm sure has a proper name) and it's so good. Empanada: Ok, first of all they are huge. Second they come packed with meat and fried up to golden perfection. And third, it was by far my FAVORITE part of the meal. My only complaint....I didn't order two. Chips and Guacamole: The chips were seasoned and warm. I thought they were okay. And the guac was good, but nothing too special.

I ordered the Vida house salad, it said mixed greens but it was iceberg lettuce (which I dislike), other then that it was meh, nothing special. What really did it for me is the price, I don't mind spending $100 for dinner for 3 people but I would like the quality food to match the cost, I did not feel it did. The one constant thing is the service, they are pretty attentive, cleaned up quickly and I never noticed my water glass empty. I won't say I will never try them again but It will take some time and some convincing from my friend that LOVES mexican."], ["Elizabeth M.", "Came here on Friday night (around 6pm)........should have known better and made a reservation. Since the Eagels were playing that night, Vida was slammed! Without a reservation, it was an hour and a half wait. We had other plans for the evening, so we decided to see if we could grab two seats (or heck, one would work!) from the bar. No such luck. I felt bad cause there were many couples, like us, hovering around the bar just waiting for one of those coveted seats. No joke, we literally stood behind these two women sipping their beers for almost 45 minutes. Probably, two of the most slowest beer drinkers I have ever met....but I digress.....Anyways, we soon discovered that the wait to sit outside wasn't very long and we put our name on the list. We were seated outside (wasn't too cold....they had a heater out there but it wasn't turned on).We ordered a bucket (5 beers) of Coronas and some guac. I really really love guacamole.....like, it's an issue. They have some fantastic guac. Nothing truely beats the guac I make, but this is a close second. We also chose to split a burrito meal. We were bar hopping that night and figured we didn't need two meals. Man, so glad we split. The serving was huge!! The burrito was delish. The grilled corn as the side was so good! All in all, I would have given this place 3 stars, but the food was so good it made me forget about standing behind the slow beer drinking women! Since we walked here, I can't comment on parking. We have been here numerous times in the past and will continue to return."], ["Benjamin G.", "I've been to Vida multiple times and seen all iterations of service here. Lunch, dinner, brunch, special events, during the DNC. It's a prime location in the EpiCentre with a killer patio and great mezzanine. Here's the breakdown:Bar - Two. Upstairs and downstairs. Both have relatively the same offerings. Bartenders are friendly and attentive and make up a mean margarita. Most recently, we had some killer margaritas with Cointreau Noir -- much better than standard Grand Marnier. They have a decent selection of beers, but they stick to the Mexican food-centric bottles/draughts. Food - Incredible guac. Let me rephrase that -- I'd eat a whole meal of guac and chips and be a happy camper. I've never had anything from Vida that I wouldn't get again. I will say that my favorite time to dine is now brunch on Sunday. Try the chilequiles and thank me later. *drops mic*Only downside that I can really comment on is the unassociated parking situation for the EpiCentre. \"Yeah, yeah, yeah....WE KNOW, Ben,\" they exclaimed and clamored exhaustively. We all know it. We all hate it. It's expensive, validated parking isn't the norm, and so on. Just buck up and pay the piper. It's worth the meal. OR, find a spot on the street post 6pm or on the weekends when it's free as well.Vida, thanks...for everything. I can haz guacamole?"], ["Kans M.", "Delicious. From the drinks to deserts. Waitress was nice. I guess her name is Ashley. Definitely deserves 5 stars!"], ["Steven B.", "I love little hole-in-the-wall Mexican joints but there are times when I want more of a fine dining experience. \u00a0So with the help of the Yelp Mobile App I aimed myself at Vida. \u00a0When it comes to Mexican my standards are very high. \u00a0That's because I live in the Philadelphia area and that's Jose Garces country. \u00a0If you are a foodie you know that he is a very well-known and successful chef and also holds an Iron Chef title. \u00a0He really knows how to do Mexican and Mexican-fusion! \u00a0I've visited his restaurants many times and he was on my mind when I walked into Vida.If you enjoy modern d\u00e9cor and atmosphere you will like the look and feel here. \u00a0The place is huge and is on two floors in addition to outside patio seating. \u00a0I sat at the downstairs bar. \u00a0The day of this visit it was brutally hot outside and delightfully cool inside.My bartender was Chelsea and she was beautiful and a great conversationalist when you could get her attention. Unfortunately that was a bit of a challenge and the bar was only half full. \u00a0So my service wasn't bad but just OK.As many others have said the margaritas here are excellent! \u00a0They are made from scratch without using the typical bottled sour mix that lesser places use. There is something else here that is excellent and that is the guacamole. \u00a0It is OMG fresh and tasty and is paired with excellent tortilla chips. \u00a0The small size goes for $8.99 and is worth every penny. \u00a0If you stopped in for a guac and marg meal you would say five stars for sure.I think every Mexican restaurant in the word has combination plates. \u00a0The one that I ordered had the incredibly imaginative name of COMBO 1 ($13.99). It included a chicken taco, carne asada taco, and a green chili pork and avacado enchilada. \u00a0It arrived quickly and was plated beautifully. \u00a0In a weird way I am both sad and pleased to say it was just fine. \u00a0Sad because I was hoping for more. \u00a0Pleased because there was nothing wrong with any component of my plate. \u00a0Everything was tasty but nothing was great. I've had similar combo plates in dozens of places.My fellow Yelpers as a group give these folks three and one half stars. \u00a0In my view that is absolutely correct. \u00a0With my admittedly high standards I'm going to give them three."], ["Rob G.", "The food here is mixed quality and a bit inconsistent. First some of the appetizers I have tried include the guacamole (pretty good), mushroom and vegetable quesadilla (also good), black bean tortilla chips (meh) and these little chicken egg roll things (just ok). For entrees, I have tried different types of tacos and all were lacking. they neede for flavor. The drinks are very good actually, including the margaritas, and the restaurant has a decent beer selection. The bartenders are also very attentive. So the place is just okay. My preference is to go during happy hours but I go elsewhere for dinner."], ["Trey S.", "I really like the ambiance of Vida. \u00a0Located in the heart of the Epicenter, Vida is perfect for dinner before Bobcats games or events at Time Warner Arena, or before going to the clubs, bars and lounges that populate the upper reaches of the Epicenter. \u00a0I had the pleasure of dining at Vida for brunch on Cinco de Mayo, and was treated to a Cinco de Mayo to remember.Ordered the steak and eggs which was amazing. \u00a0The steak was juicy, tender and had a great grilled flavor to it. \u00a0I will say, I asked for my eggs scrambled w/cheese and received no cheese. \u00a0But other than that, everything was spectacular. \u00a0The fruit cocktail containing strawberries, watermelons, and a variety of other fruits was great and the perfect complement to the meaty steak, eggs and bacon. \u00a0I also had the chance to sample their margaritas and was truly impressed. \u00a0And of course, the Dos Equis Amber on draft might be the single greatest beer drinking experience known to mankind. \u00a0Be careful, parking can be expensive in the garages near and around the Epicenter and Vida doesn't validate parking (I know because I asked). \u00a0Overall, I must say, brunch at Vida for Cinco De Mayo was nothing short of Cinco De Amazing!"], ["Tyler R.", "Chips, Salsa, CLUBBING.Well, not really. \u00a0But almost.We walked past two ladies taking some serious booty pictures by the door as we were walking in. \u00a0Yes, they were literally pulling their pants up high (way over the butt makes the best booty pictures?) and posing. \u00a0Mmmmhhhmmm.Walking in the door I was hit in the face with the Manhattan club scene - Sean Paul was blasting and I could barely hear the hostess over the music and the people. \u00a0I'm good with that - I've been to plenty of Mexican restaurants that play authentic Mexican-style music, but I say there's nothing wrong with a little dance dance music while you taco up the night.We opted for guacamole to start, which wasn't quite table side - we got a bowl of pre-chopped avocado mix with another bowl of chopped cilantro, onions, and tomatoes that was mixed in by the guy that brought it over. \u00a0Table side or not, it was still pretty good.The thing that stood out to me the most was the salsa - we pretty much drank the stuff. \u00a0It was super smooth, and had the perfect mix of cilantro and onions. \u00a0It was the closest thing to my favorite salsa ever, handcrafted by La Carreta in Nashua, NH. \u00a0So now I can say my two favorite salsas can be found in New Hampshire and North Carolina, two places which fail to share a boarder with Mexico and probably wouldn't pop into your mind if you were asked to \"name states that makes the best salsa.\" \u00a0So far - NH, NC. \u00a0Boom. \u00a0There it is.For food, we both opted for some type of taco, one with beef and one with chicken. \u00a0They came on a not quiet hard shell not quiet soft shell briefly fried taco deal, which was actually pretty good. \u00a0It was crunchy but still foldable.We left full, happy, and after a day's worth of driving causing what might be referred to as mild dehydration (mixed with exhaustion)....a little tipsy (let's call it SUPER relaxed) after the second round of house margaritas, rocks, no salt."], ["Devanshi P.", "I have been here twice and after the first time I realized that this isn't the best mexican food out there. I have had better mexican in Charlotte. However it is a good place to have drinks while catching up with friends. I enjoy spicy mexican food so Vida isn't the best option for me, but those who do not like spicy do enjoy this place. I have had their margaritas and they are great. Their guacamole is also really good and their salsa is good, the spicy salsa (you have to ask for it) is really good and definitely has a kick."], ["Michelle P.", "There are a few things I like more than a good brunch: Cam Newton, driving a convertible, the Charlotte Bobcats winning a game and a pair of shoes that actually fit my stupid arches... I like Vida just as much as I like those things because they don't have just a good brunch; they have a great brunch... The staff was fantastic... You could barely finish your meal before they would ask if you were done with it... They do not believe in letting plates sit around and clog up a table... I like that... The refills kept coming without a lull, which was also great... I went for the chorizo tacos and I was not disappointed... You could probably put jalapeno bacon on anything and I'd eat it, though... lol \u00a0Seriously, scrambled eggs, cheese, cilantro and chorizo? \u00a0All wrapped in some floury goodness? \u00a0I was full midway into the second one, but I kept trying to finish... I still get a tear in my eye when I think about that last bite I left on my plate... I couldn't focus on just the tacos, though, because the potatoes they give you were awesome! \u00a0That's probably because they had jalapeno in them as well... The fruit was very good... They've got to get their stuff from a market, that wasn't grocery store fruit... lolI loved the look of the restaurant and since we were seated upstairs, it gave us a nice view of all the goings on downstairs... The drinks were fantastic... I had Cointreau Noir and Vida margaritas... They were both sublime... The frozen Vida margarita didn't have that weird, watery taste that most frozens end up with, so I was very excited about that... The prices weren't bad at all, but they don't validate parking, so I would suggest going there, but making better arrangements than the dreaded Epicentre lot... lol"], ["Bernadette C.", "I have been here twice now, once for lunch and once for brunch. \u00a0Both visits were on par with what I expected. \u00a0Decent food and fair prices right in the heart of uptown. \u00a0The service is friendly and quick, even during busy time (like brunch for Cinco de Mayo) and the portions are a healthy size to make it worth your buck.I was seated upstairs both times I have visited, and though you get a little bit more of an intimate area, you kind of miss the buzz going on downstairs if you are looking for a scene.Not sure if this is related to Vida or not, but while there on Cinco de Mayo, the most memorable piece for me was the DJ! \u00a0He was rocking all of my favorite 90s music, that I made a mental note to hopefully find him again!Worth a visit if you are in the area and looking for a fair priced meal and good service."], ["India W.", "Great food with a nice outdoor option! This is a great Sunday afternoon spot to eat at with friends or solo. My fiance loves Mexican so we decided to try them out due to the fact that we could not eat there on Cinco de Mayo like we wanted to. The food was delicious and service was nice."], ["Donna A.", "Came with a large group. Service was good. Food was yummy. My favorites are the guacamole and their margaritas!"]]}
