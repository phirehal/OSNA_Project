Even though members of our group speak Spanish fluently, our pale skin immediately sent the hostess for the English speaker on staff. Can't blame them, I guess, but in case she's not there when you are, you can still get a good meal!As others have mentioned, the menu is fairly large, and encompasses a few different regions. We ordered everything from stuffed plantains to chicken and steak tacos to pinchos to a beautiful shrimp and fish dish, and some were accompanied by fantastic house made tortillas. I ordered the chicken pinchos. YUM! Perfectly cooked, a nice sauce, rice, salad, fried plantains, and a small odd shaped hot dog tasting thing (we've made our best guesses, but I'll just tell you it mostly tastes like a hot dog and looks like it went through a cookie cutter). I couldn't finish my large platter, and actually most people couldn't finish their plate. Hello, 4th meal!We asked if they had any draft beer, she said \"yes\", but it was all from the bottle. Oh well. Pretty good service, jukebox, delicious food, I'm ready to go back!! CMYE??

Only ordered the chicken flautas to go, and OMG, \u00a0it was so good!!! I haven't eaten these since I left NY, and it reminded me so much of this Mexican joint I used to always go to. It was just an appetizer but they add lettuce, tomatoes, onions and guacamole so you could easily have it for lunch or dinner.

But if \u00a0you want authentic, quality food that Latino people actually frequent on a regular basis, then this is it. My husband and I were taken aback when we were greeted in Spanish, and saw that the restaurant was full of Latin Americans, but it was a GOOD \"taken aback\"! LOL. What went through our minds was: \"Oh yes, we're in the right spot!\" And the food did not disappoint.

Some sort of empanada wrapped entirely in plantain and deep fried, filled with some sort of rice pudding. Deserty. But delicious.It can be a struggle to eat here if a) you don't speak a lot of spanish and b) if you're vegetarian, but both of those apply to me and I left very, very full. As we were poking at our various foods, enormous Platos Typicos were steadily streaming out of the kitchen, all large and enticing. Veggies will stick more to breakfast, empanadas, pupusas, and burritos. Be emphatic - some menu descriptions forget to mention ham, etc.Ask for the spicy salsa when you sit, as their gringo Red is mucho boring. They also do Botela Coke - enough for two to share. 6 dollar lunch specials daily. Breakfast combos served all day long. Lots of wood and curved doorways.

Beer was not ice cold, and no draft selection. Food was pretty good. I can't remember the name of what I got but it was pork chops on top of a bed of typical Mexican restaurant salad fixings, shredded lettuce, tomato, with a side of white rice and refried beans and fried plantains which were good but some of them were dry and almost cold.

I pointed out to the waitress that my friend was overcharged on the bill and she refused to correct it and was icy from then on.

More often than not, we carry out, but we've also dined in a number of times. Carpe Diem is located on the amazing strip in Elizabeth, along with Customshop, Passion 8, Viva Chicken and Earl's grocery to name a few. The restaurant is quite large with a large bar area up front that is great to get a drink or have a more casual dinner. The dining room is nice and quite formal though you can easily get away with nice jeans and a collared shirt. The menu is fantastic. We've never had anything we don't like. A few favorites...fried chicken and scallops. In my opinion, this is the best fried chicken in Charlotte. Amazing crust, very tender and juicy. It is served with mashed potatoes and a pepper gravy. The scallops are my wife's favorite. Tender, always great texture (important with scallops)."], ["John H.", "This place is on point. \u00a0Ate at the bar with a friend, bartenders were fun and skilled. \u00a0The cappuccino martini was sooooo good!Ordered the cheese plate, with some amazing candied cashews and spreads. \u00a0The duck confit was out of this world! \u00a0Green beans with some sort of crunchiness mixed in...yum.I need to come back with a small group and try the dining area, but if it's anything like the bar experience this place is a gem!"], ["Kristy A.", "Really good experience here, but not going to be my newest food addiction. The house salad included strawberries, feta cheese, and pumpkin seeds, which I inhaled. They had enough salt/pepper on the salad as well as balsamic dressing done right. I also had the shrimp & grits, which had pinto beans. That was unique, but flavored well and the shrimp were large and w/out a tail. A vegetarian option that subbed mushroom for shrimp was available. My friend had the duck confit and was pleased. Their butter for the bread was a bit salty. Service was great, as the waitress had an impressive command over an expansive menu. Drinks were tasty, but weak. Overall, I see why this place is hyped. Everything was really flavorful and made from quality ingredients and the service is second to none."], ["Nicole E.", "We came here on a Saturday evening for a dinner date. A bit dressy here so I'd recommend looking nice. The service is impeccable- the waiters were always checking in on us.

My only complaint is that I wished there was more. \u00a0And then dessert came... our waitress, who was very friendly and personable, informed us that one of the sisters that owns the restaurant also makes all the desserts and they change pretty frequently. \u00a0That night my fiance got what he calls the 'best thing he's ever eaten' which was a pumpkin gingerbread trifle (I believe) with caramel sauce. \u00a0I had the blueberry cobbler which was also really really good. \u00a0Overall, we loved this place and can't wait to go back the next time we are in the area!"], ["Marco F.", "I had been wanting to try this place out since I first got to Charlotte so when I saw they were participating in restaurant week I made a reservation right away ($30 for a 3 courses). We came here last Saturday night with our friend Paul who had never been here before either. While RW can sometimes take away from the experience certain restaurants would typically provide, it's a great opportunity to see what the restaurant might be all about without walking out of there with a $200 tab. What it really comes down to at a place like Carpe Diem, $30 would typically get you just an entr\u00e9e. So you can look at it however you would like, but pretty much just tell myself that I get a free appetizer and desert with my meal.All 3 of us participated in the 3 for $30 - However, since they were offer their full menu as well, we started our meal by sharing the seared rare tuna as well as the steamed mussels. Both were VERY good. I then had the potato soup. It had a little bit of truffle oil and what they call \"duck bacon\". Paul and I both agreed that there is only one type of bacon in this world and it comes from animal that goes \"oink oink\" haha. With that said, the soup was tasty and of course I inhaled the entire thing. I then had the pork chop - I would have to say this this was just average. However the mashed dumpling squash that came with it was very very good. It might have been the highlight of the entire entr\u00e9e. I had a bite of the hanger steak as well as the fried chicken and those were both delicious. Of the 3 entrees that came out I would say the pork chop came in last place. For dessert I had the coffee cr\u00e8me brulee. For my liking, the top was a little over cooked/torched - I really had to press down to break it with my spoon - but I didn't mind it. The custard was delicious so it kind of makes up for it.Since meeting Paul, he's been really teaching us a whole lot when it come to wine. There's a reason why he's the \"wine guy\". He's picked up on the types that we like and brought a GREAT bottle of wine to dinner for all of us to enjoy (THANKS PAUL!!) Overall, I had a great evening and I got to enjoy CD with GREAT COMPANY. I can't wait to come back and try this place again!"], ["Nicole T.", "Great dinner experience here with a close friend and Charlotte resident! \u00a0She had previously heard good things about the establishment and wanted to try it out, so we did. \u00a0The atmosphere is classy and chic. \u00a0Began the meal with cocktails, which were good but on the weaker side. \u00a0Our waitress recited what seemed to be 15 different specials for the evening, and new every detail of each--down to sauces and ingredients. I was quite impressed! For the main course I ordered the Duck Confit, and it was tender and fell right off the bone. \u00a0Overall a good dining experience!"], ["Paul C.", "Went here for Restaurant Week with my friends Marco and Allyson. With all the rave reviews, I had high expectations, and Carpe Diem delivered!The first thing you notice is the decor. A LOT of work has been put into making Elizabeth Avenue Charlotte's premier dining destination, and it really looks great! The trolley will FINALLY provide service this summer after a decade of work, and I'm sure the business owners can't wait to finally get that trolley up and running. The interior of Carpe Diem is very beautiful, with dim lights but not \"dark\" (don't need to use your smartphone camera light to read the menus....yeay!). Lots of wood all around and a very romantic atmosphere.Since we all chose the Restaurant Week menu, we of course were limited to that selection. However, we couldn't resist ordering a couple of things off their \"regular\" menu, and we got the Seared Tuna and Mussels Apps, The Mussels had a cilantro white wine broth that was delicious. The tuna was cooked perfectly with that nice sear with sesame seeds on top. So off to a good start!I started off with a potato soup with truffle oil. Now if you know me, I order anything that's got the word \"truffle\" in it and it was a solid effort. I would have liked a bit more truffle oil as I think they put just a couple of drops so I really couldn't taste too much truffle. Allyson got the salad with goat cheese and THAT was quite tasty as the goat cheese was lightly coated and flash fried. Love chevre!They then surprised us with an Intermezzo sorbet with Thyme to cleanse our palates. Nice touch.Next up was the Hangar Steak with crumbled blue cheese and creamed kale. I asked our waitress to bring it however the Chef recommends, and she asked if Medium Rare was good. I said yes! But it came out more \"rare\" than medium, but it was still tasty. I'm not a huge blue cheese lover, but the older I get the more adventurous my taste buds become so I now order things I never used to. While good, it still confirms that blue cheese is not my favorite. The creamed kale was average, and this also confirms that I do not like the hard, chewy texture of kale.My buddy Marco got the pork chop and Allyson got the fried chicken. After tasting both, I thought Allyson's chicken was the best thing on the table. It was juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. In comparison, this chicken was better than the famed Leroy Fox's. The pork chop was good but not mind blowing.The piece de resistance was the dessert! I got the Chocolate Crepes with caramel sauce and creme angliese. OMG were these things DELICIOUS! They were filled with a chocolate mousse or creme...no matter, it was EFFEN GOOD! Marco got the coffee flavored creme brulee and that also was quite delicious!Because my friends were kind enough to invite me to this special meal, I brought a great Napa Merlot (their fave, not mine) from Nickel and Nickel. I figure IF I'm to endure a Merlot, might as well bring a top notch one, and it paired nicely with our food! Their corkage fee was only $15 which I find very reasonable for such a top end place.So thanks to Marco and Allyson for making a generous invite. We've all become good friends in such a short period of time....remarkable how FOOD can bond people, even though I'm more than 20 years older than them.And thanks to Carpe Diem for delivering another really good restaurant week experience! I look forward to going back!"], ["Amy C.", "S'wonderful, s'mahvelous. \u00a0What a wonderful evening in a beautiful restaurant with delicious food! \u00a0The other reviews about the romantic atmosphere are spot on - the exposed wood, low lighting, gorgeous light fixtures, white table clothes, comfy chairs, artwork... everything is just perfection. \u00a0We had an early reservation that on a dreary January Tuesday evening wasn't really necessary, but it's always nice to have the option - I would imagine that on date nights, this establishment is packed. \u00a0We were able to easily park in one of the two large lots for Elizabeth Ave businesses. \u00a0Be mindful of the tracks that run down the street, cracking your ass in front of a first date could be catastrophic (or a good story for later). \u00a0Fresh, warm bread and butter (plentiful butter, instead of one tablespoon that people have to fight for) were brought to the table. \u00a0Our waitress explained the specials of the evening in detail and gave us time to look at the menu and decide.I opted for the fried (boneless) chicken breast and Yukon Gold mashed potatoes, sauteed spinach with shallot-black pepper gravy. \u00a0My serving was two smaller chicken breasts that were fried perfectly, not greasy at all, and were very tender/juicy. \u00a0The mashed potatoes were buttery delicious and the sauteed spinach was seasoned just right. \u00a0The portion and flavors were spot on!For dessert I had the cherry cobbler which was served with vanilla ice cream. \u00a0Again - perfect. \u00a0Buttery cobbler with just-tart-enough cherries, and just enough ice cream and whipped cream to complement the dish, but not dairy it down. \u00a0From the moment we walked in the door, I could tell it was going to be a wonderful evening. \u00a0The host was friendly and helpful (asking if we were celebrating any kind of occasion), the waitress and staff were attentive without hovering and the food was one of the best meals that I have had recently. \u00a0Queen's Feast 2015 is starting soon - I would definitely put Carpe Diem on the list as a stop!"], ["Rod O.", "Beautiful! \u00a0Romantic! \u00a0GREAT Service! \u00a0Fantastic FOOD! \u00a0Impress a Date or Client! \u00a0Funny, I have Never taken a Date here yet! \u00a0So it is a nice place to take a MaleFriend and have a quiet Dinner! \u00a0Not as Pricey as you would think for the Total Experience!Beef is usually what I want here and I have tasted many of the other dishes my Friends have ordered...

However, I think a solid 4 stars is quite spot on. Here's why:I was pleasantly surprised with the large portion sizes because many restaurants tend to skimp for these kind of events. I had the kale salad and the mister had the goat cheese salad to start. Both were delicious and entree-sized portions. I appreciated the gelato as a palate cleanser between the first and second courses. We also sampled the pork chop and the shrimp and grits, which appeared to be regular items on their menu. The pork chop was massive, and the squash puree was a nice complement. I love creme brulee, so the dessert was the star of my meal. I also had the Southern Julep cocktail with my meal, but after having lived in Kentucky for several years, I can't sing the praises of a julep without the mint leaves, so that missed the mark for me. The mint was supposed to be infused according to the menu, but it seemed to have zero mint flavor to me. As as an aside from the food, many other reviews noted the ambiance, but truthfully, I wasn't digging it. For a Friday evening at dinner time, the restaurant was surprisingly quiet for being busy, and I wouldn't necessarily describe it as having low, romantic lighting either. The crowd seemed generally older, so maybe a great place to take parental visitors."], ["Jim M.", "Yelp said the restaurant was the 8th best vegan restaurant in Charlotte (7th on Google Maps). \u00a0But there was nothing on the menu that was truly vegan. \u00a0How does this happen? \u00a0And when I asked for a Vegetarian dish with no cheese I still got cheese. \u00a0This is an expensive restaurant and you would think that the waiter would get your order right. \u00a02 stars for mediocre service, high prices, and no vegan options at the \"8th best vegan restaurant in Charlotte\"."], ["Winn M.", "Favorite restaurant in Charlotte, hands down.

Our server was friendly and attentive- he recommended a nice chardonnay for my dinner and was pleasantly surprised it was in the $8 range.The atmosphere was a little stark- nicer for a quiet date than a girls night.

It's a lovely restaurant- beautifully appointed and as Julia S points out - stellar service and impeccable pacing. I've taken many of visiting family members here and I've never had anything less than an extraordinary meal. It's not a cheap meal, but it's well priced for the quality and quantity. For two of us with a few courses and a bottle of mid-price wine we usually spend about $120-$150 (including tip). Some of my favorites...Warm Goat Cheese (salad): I mean, really, it's warm goat cheese over delicious greens with hazelnut crunch. It's so good you basically want to start fist pumping through the restaurant.Cheese Plate: A very generous and tantalizing plate of cheese of the day. As Julia said - the accompaniments make it stellar. Scallops: I've had them so many different ways here I can't even count. One time they had some vanilla essence another atop of risotto. Both times they were out of this world. Cooked and seasoned perfectly. Plus they give you a very generous portion of large scallops.

After ordering we were attended to just the right amount: not too pushy, yet not absent.While enjoying the bread, which is fabulously fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside, we soaked in the ambiance: romantically lite room, beautiful woodwork, and mesmerizing back-lit vines.For the first course, we shared two salads, the goat cheese \u00a0and the grilled grape. Both are fantastic. I particularly enjoyed the blue cheese vinaigrette on the grilled grape, which only hints at its blue cheese roots.Next, we had the (famous) buttermilk fried chicken and vegetarian cous cous. Again, both were wonderful. The chicken was slightly battered and fried, which was a refreshing contrast to to more traditional fried chicken. The cous cous is a cornucopia of veggies and, well cous cous, in a light tangy sauce that I couldn't get enough of. Both are highly recommended.Finally, dessert involved sharing a walnut and pecan pie (delicious, but I like my desserts like I like my chocolate--with chocolate) and a chocolate (yay!) bread pudding. The latter earned a paragraph unto itself.Through years of diligent research, I've reached the conclusion that many chocolaty cake desserts are a let down. They are either not moist enough, too sweet, not sweet enough, too much, or just not satisfying. Yet still, time after time, I trepidatiously order the chocolate whatever in hopes that somehow, this time would be different. Usually, I am let down. However, this time at Carpe Diem it was different: this was the perfect mix of chocolaty goodness delivered via an appropriately moist vehicle for facilitating the devouration (yes, I just made that word up) of said chocolatly goodness (the bread pudding). I realize my error has always been relying on the traditional 'cake' delivery method. No longer. If ever you get the chance, you need to devourate (oops, I did it again) this chocolate bread puddingIn a final note, there is the bar area and the official dining area. We actually preferred the bar area on account of the lighting and more intimate nature of the experience. Still, the dining area has beautifully crafted art nouveau woodwork, a flower centerpiece, and wonderful artwork. I would return just to admire the place."], ["Linda L.", "OMG.

I speak Spanish and there has been occasional confusion anyway, but they always jump to fix anything that you think might have gone wrong with your order.

What made it even more difficult is the fact that they had a whole fried fish on special for $6.99 that day and I can never say no to fried fish when it comes whole! It came with a salad, rice, refried beans, and a homemade salsa and it was TO DIE FOR! This is the type of food us immigrants seek in the U.S. because one bite and we are instantly transported to a beach somewhere back in our country (mine is Venezuela!). I don't remember what my husband ate, but we did get several types of pupusas, tacos, empanadas and other sides as well. I felt like we were at one of those Brazilian steakhouses where the food just keeps showing up at your table because to reach $35 we had to just keep ordering A LOT! Needless to say, we both went into food comas and were completely worthless the rest of the day, but it was totally worth it. This is a really great place to try too because it has a huge variety of offering, not just Salvadoran food, but Mexican as well.

The food was unexceptional, but I did not try the entire menu, so my review is not negative for that reason alone. The service is what motivates this negative review: it was terrible. I do not know whether we had a new hire--a fast speaking fellow that wore red framed glasses--but it was apparent upon our first introduction that he didn't have much time for us. The real indication arose when we (my date and I) received a lackluster artichoke marinated in vinegar. It looked and tasted like something pre-prepared at the grocery store. I gave it a try, hoping that it might taste better if I tried the heartier bits, but it was no use. It sucked. We left the artichoke untouched, expecting an inquiry by our server as would be common at most high end restaurants. We waited, and waited, until the server came to take our plates away. He finally asked how it was, and we told him we didn't like it at all. He took our other plates and left this grocery store concoction on our table. We waited again. We discussed between ourselves whether there was some miscommunication, so we awaited the waiter's return. When he arrived, he asked if we wanted him to take our untouched artichoke. We said yes, and tried to imply what he should do. We very kindly asked if we could have another appetizer instead. He didn't seem to understand, so we said it again. At this point, he seemed visibly annoyed. He asked point blank, \"so are you saying you want Empanadas?\" Assuming he'd understood our plea--or just hoping--I said yes. He returned with them; they were alright. And then the check arrived. There I was greeted with the charge for those nasty artichokes in addition to the Empanadas. I was perplexed. I flagged our waiter, and reminded him that he forgot to take the artichoke off our bill. \u00a0He was even more perplexed, and visibly annoyed. He asked, \"didn't you order that?\" Yes, we did, but it was terrible, and we spoke about this already! He sharply exclaimed that he'd talk to his manager. He must have because the bill was quickly and hardly plopped on our tabletop without a word or look from the waiter. The artichoke billings had vanished as quickly as our resolve to return.

Apparently, the prices they list for liquor are only for drinks on the rocks, which he claims are a larger pour. So, if you decide to have a drink here, remember that they have a system all their own. They do not measure out a shot, like every other bar in the country. They pour more than a shot (though I didn't see the increase) and charge an additional fee (without note in the menu or any word from the server) if you order neat."], ["Jan M.", "We opted to revisit Dressler's for our anniversary.

It was the perfect refreshment to celebrate the return of warm weather. The calamari we ordered was the best calamari I have ever had. Instead of the small over cooked and greasy ringlets most restaurants serve the calamari at Dressler's is cut into long juicy strips and is topped with a glorious peanut sauce that has wasabi drizzled without. We also sampled the crab cake, which was good but paled in comparison to the calamari. After a brief interlude with a split wedge salad (a salad came with the deal) we got to taste our entrees. My filet was done perfectly and the cut was one of the more tender steaks I have had. The asparagus were lightly seasoned over creamy mashed potatoes. The only flaw was the sauce on the filet was a little too sweet and I think it would have been better done if the cut of the steak was more lightly seasoned to show off the natural deliciousness of a filet.We ended with the cheesecake which had an enviable lightness, though neither of us cared for the cinnamon sprinkled on top. The waiter was very friendly and kept our drinks full. We will definitely be back to sample more of the menu!"], ["Joelle J.", "Awesome service, exquisite food, lovely setting. Jerry was our server and was knowledgeable and attentive."], ["Rachel A.", "This review is long overdue! I've dined at Dressler's with my mister, taken prospective employees out to dinner here, and hosted a retirement party lunch here. Like a lot of people, I fall into restaurant ruts, but that is not the case with Dressler's. So, why the multiple visits? To start, the view is great, especially if you happen to dine on a warm evening and can eat outside. Lots of great people watching from that vantage! The decor inside is sophisticated enough to impress a client or for a celebration, but casual enough to have a nice meal without a lot of fuss. On my several visits here, the food has been consistently good from appetizers through dessert. I have to say, I am partial to the pork chop or the ribeye steak. I want to note as well the expansive gluten-free menu with a range of options beyond salads like a lot of other restaurants. I also want to second how seamless event planning is here. Rhonda was a pleasure to work with, and the wait staff were so accommodating. I work for a state agency, so we can't expense alcohol, but the bar staff was still able to create a custom \"mocktail\" so that we could toast our retiring staff member. Great, right?"], ["H M.", "While visiting Charlotte dined at Dressler's for a business dinner. Service and ambiance are top notch. Dined on the pear salad which was amazing. For the main course I had the famous halibut. It was good however the sauce was richer then I expected, would have enjoyed it more if I omitted the sauce or put it on the side. Desserts are amazing here, especially \"Mother's Desserts\". we had a sample of several desserts. The pumpkin cheese cake was such a hit we ordered more for the table! It was hands down the best pumpkin cheese cake I have ever had.

Every single part about the meal was \u00a0delicious. I do not know how, but they managed to perfectly marinate and dress the entree and sides.

With all the reviews and how pricy the menu was, I was expecting excellent service and food. It was all ok. We started with the calamari which I saw many rave reviews about online. It was definitely not my favorite. Very different with a wasabi sauce and a light fry, but I've definitely had better. We both had stead for dinner. The potatoes were good, but the steak was not. For the price I was expecting way better but what I got was equal to one from Outback Steakhouse. It was way overdone (I asked for medium and it was definitely medium well to well done). And it didn't seem like high quality meat. For dessert we had the chocolate cake. It was an ok cake, but the chocolate sauce was sour for some reason, and I didn't see anything about raspberry or anything in the description. As for the service, our waitress was nothing exceptional like it should be for a restaurant of this caliber. We are a young couple, and it seemed like she didn't want to give us too much attention because we obviously weren't going to buy the most expensive bottle of wine. Didn't offer us straws when she did for the table right next to us, nor lemons for our water. The bread came after we were completely done with our appetizer. It just didn't feel elegant.

The last two ordered a vegetable plate that one said was terrible and one said was good. The appetizers of oysters and flatbread were excellent and the service was good. To give the place credit they did give us a big discount when we told them we thought the food was lousy. So they avoid one star because they do good business. However it is a higher end place and for the price Halycon does not deliver on quality. The food is disappointing and it was honestly maybe the worst steak Ive ever eaten. They even try to gourmet up the bread with this gross butter contraption that stinks. Overall Halycon tries to be elegant but there food is lousy and Id rather eat somewhere with better food. \u00a0They do have a unique menu but I think its overly unique to the point that its ridiculous especially when the food doesnt deliver.

A sleek modern terrace abutting the Mint Museum in downtown Charlotte, it seems that nothing on Halcyon's menu is anything less than excellent. I recently went with a group of nine people during their brunch hour and was able to try a wide variety of what they offer.HighlightsPork Belly BLT: An open faced pork belly sandwich topped with crispy bacon, avocado slices, and herb aioli. The pork belly was rich and velvety, the bacon cooked to crunchy perfection, and the marriage of avocado and aioli added a slightly tangy/buttery character to expertly balance out the meat.Cinnamon Apple French Toast: French toast on steroids...No joke this toast is comically large and fluffy. Our waiter told me it was once normal bread that got angry after being zapped with the gamma radiation machine Halcyon keeps in the back. But this plates transcendence is not solely in the heft and consistency of the bready goodness. The cinnamon and apple blended seamlessly with the butter and syrup to make what I can un-ironically (but totally pretentiously) describe as the platonic ideal of French toast. \u00a0Every French toast I've ever had has wished it was this French Toast. If you like shitty music this is the Beyonc\u00e9 of French Toast. If you like shitty TV shows this is the How I Met Your Mother of French Toast. And if you like shitty restaurants this is the Olive Garden of French Toast. If you ever get to Halcyon, do the responsible thing and order the French Toast. I've only eaten three things that I consider to be bucket list meals: Ron's Biscuits and Gravy at Nosh in Durham, The Brisket at Franklin's in Austin, and now the French Toast at Halcyon.Though I didn't order any for myself I was able to try most of the table's cocktails and can say they were consonant with the quality seen in the dishes, though perhaps even more unique.And all this without a mention of cool, modern, \"organicy\" feeling d\u00e9cor that somehow makes you feel both avant-garde and cozily local. The only downside is that once the dinner hour strikes Halcyon's prices jump precipitously, but if you can get there in the morning/afternoon your money will be very well spent."], ["Jacky M.", "Wonderful food set in an inviting atmosphere.

The hibachi is thinly sliced, with a hit of sea salt, and served with grapefruit and multiple smears, a wasabi one that was best! In addition to the hamachi, we received complimentary bread with a rosemary butter, yum!For entrees we chose the scallops and roasted chicken.

I also had the french onion soup (seasonal) which was fantastic.Another time we went for brunch/lunch while museum hopping and had an awesome sweet potato waffle and the burger. Personally, I seriously think it's the best burger in town. Juicy, perfectly pink, flavorful. It had fried green tomato, jalapeno cheddar and a chow relish that didn't sound good from the menu but my husband ordered it and it worked perfectly. YUM! \u00a0They also have a lot of locally grown stuff on the menu. Another time I brought my mother from the wine country here and even she was impressed. \u00a0I would definitely recommend this place, especially for out of towners.

We ate there last night, had ceviche and the steak tartar for an appetizer. The ceviche has a bland marinade which overwhelmed the fish, but at the same time did not provide any unique or exciting sensations for the taste buds. The fish was fresh and in no way would you say it was bad, but it was not worth ordering again. The tartar was pretty much the same as the ceviche. It was there, it was not bad, but it failed to excite. For the entree we had the rabbit, as recommended by the waiter and the boar bolognese. These were a step up from the appetizers, but again failed to create the \"I can't wait to go back\" experience I was hoping for. \u00a0All the ingredients were there, but it was not assembled in such a way as to make a great experience.

It's two weeks out of the year, folks. Do it up and do it right.That being said, I was absolutely jacked to try The Mint Museum's newest addition - Halcyon! Their fresh (no freezer on site) farm to table concept is just as lovely as their decor. Gorgeous twig chandeliers, lots of deep, rich browns, ocean blue wall, interesting silverware and more. Plus, that patio is going to be stunning during the warmer months. Service was friendly and efficient and we were in and out within an hour. I can, however, imagine staying a while once CRW is over. The food, however, is where Halcyon fell a bit short of wondrous, both in flavor and in portion sizes. I see on their Yelp biz categories they listed small plates and new American, perhaps I should have paid more attention to the small plate mention. Listen, I don't expect grandiose portions, but I left Halcyon hungry. That's sayin' a lot. Here's what I had:Amuse Bouche - Hummus w/pita points: 3/5: This was actually a generous helping of hummus, especially for an amuse bouche. Our server brought us extra pita points because the heaping pile of hummus only came with three. Ha. I love carbs, I'd like some extra pita. I just wasn't wowed by the flavor of the hummus,Farm Salad: 4/5: Local butter lettuce with a few sunflower seeds, tasty tomatoes and a delicious mustard vinaigrette. Great texture and full of color. I really, really enjoyed the dressing. Short Rib: 3.5/5: Let me put this out there right away - I love the flavors on the plate. Loved the tender short rib, the tasty glaze, the potato puree and the root veggies. My problem with this dish? There wasn't much of it. At all. Three very small slices of short rib, two bites of potato and the equivalent of two baby carrots diced. Normally I offer hubs a few bites of my dish, but I didn't have any to share. Color me disappointed, but they said this was supposed to be a main course*? Maybe I got the runt of the short rib \u00a0- it was very short. *In the same vein, hubs ordered the chicken and I chuckled when they set it down. The chicken was the size of a kiwi with a protruding bone. Creme Brulee: 2/5: Very cold inside and the texture was pretty off. Not smooth, creamy and delicious as I had hoped. Plus, the flavor was lacking. So, maybe I should have paid more attention to the small plate classification? I'll take a bit of the blame, but that could have been advertised a bit better on their CRW menu and website, for that matter. I know I'll come back to Halcyon as I really adore the concept, but I'll be sure to have a snack before I arrive."], ["Jeff S.", "I stopped here for lunch after a couple hours exploring the Mint Musuem. \u00a0The restaurant is not a big place but it is laid out well with counter seating and several tables. \u00a0There's a patio out front with large tables so you won't feel crammed. \u00a0The view from the window is a great one of South Tryon Street. \u00a0I was greeted immediately and seated at the window. \u00a0My server was there almost immediately and started me out with an unsweetened iced tea with mint. \u00a0She also explained the menu to me a bit and explained today's soup a watermelon and 3 other ingredient gazpacho.On a hot day, a cold soup would be quite refreshing so I ordered that and the Monte Carlo sandwich with dressed greens.The gazpacho was amazing with a bit of spice to it. \u00a0It was so refreshing that I could have jumped in if the bowl were larger. \u00a0The Monte Carlo was an interesting and very flavorful open-faced sandwich - BBq pork with cheese and a slaw on top. \u00a0Service was outstanding and I definitely thought I needed to schedule my dinner group here."], ["Gabriela G.", "Terrible service, I was there yesterday around 3:30pm after visiting the museum.

I don't understand why anyone will go and pay twice as much for mediocre Latin food at some of the hipster places around town when this restaurant is so close to the city, particularly South end.

He was friendly, patient as we perused the extensive menu, and attentive. *That* review would've been 5 stars. We (a family of four adults) returned tonight, and it felt like a Twilight Zone episode...but not one of the good ones. Everything looked the same and the food was still high quality; however, the server had morphed from the esteemed Mario to an 18(?)-year-old who perhaps started his career in the restaurant industry, say, earlier today. He seemed to have not been trained at all. It was not only that he lacked significant social skills, but his poor attention/ memory caused us to get some (minor) incorrect food...even after another server came back to confirm part of the order. But the biggest problem was simply that he clearly had no interest in his job. This included ignoring our party for most of the evening while chatting with the 5+ female servers.
