The white table clothes and smartly dressed waiters definitely add to the romantic atmosphere. However the mood is dampened a bit by the small and rather close together tables.The menu is thoughtfully laid out starting with a good, but not overwhelming, selection of appetizers, traditional Indian dishes and modern Indian dishes. The samosas come beautifully plated with a hot sweet and sour chutney. The seared scallops are my personal favorite because they always come cooked tender on the inside with a distinctive seasoning seared on the top and bottom.I am still a novice when it comes to Indian food so my go to order is the chicken tikka masala and I love the creamy tomato sauce it comes in which they do not prepare with much heat. I have also tried the dahl makhni which was also a solid choice for those still experimenting with all the new flavors of Indian cuisine. While Copper dishes have been consistently enjoyable I am not quite sold on the value of the meal. They offer a single slice of naan to begin the meal, but if you would like additional naan, even plain, they charge. That seems a little too opportunistic when they are already charging $20 for most of their meat dishes and $15 for vegetarian. At least they do include the rice in the meal price.Other people have noted that the wait staff can be a bit off-putting and we have experienced that before but our last two visits the waiters were very attentive and had a courteous and friendly demeanor.

Indian EDM thumps incongruously from a mounted speaker, quite at odds with the relaxing environment.There is a 'Coppertini' menu along with a fairly impressive wine list, with a few decent whites by the glass, including a light and refreshing Indian Chenin blanc, which is what I went with.The menu promises not just the old Indian restaurant standbys but also some modern takes on the country's cuisine, including a tandoori-spiced duck leg confit (not cooked in the tandoor, of which none exists in this restaurant) and dhana dal with scallops.'Masala Chili Cauliflower Florets: Zesty Soy-Tomato-Scallion Glaze, Toasted Spices, Ginger' ($9) sounded good. In reality what arrived was essentially a pretty poor plate of gobi Manchurian. I understand that the taste in Indian food is towards very crispy batters but this was something else, nowhere near pliable with a fork, and the glaze was reminiscent of over-salted ketchup more than any of the promised spices or zest. Some complimentary naan and completely extraneous chutneys arrived with this, the bread clearly out of a bag, as well as some raita.For entree I chose 'Kashmiri Chili-Fennel Roasted Lamb Chops, Wild Mushroom Pulao, Lamb-Mushroom Redux' ($27) and was sorely disappointed. The lamb chops, which I requested medium, came rare, and needed knife and tooth to be prised from the bone. That would be excusable were it not for the nearly total lack of flavor. Some fennel came through, but the lamb-mushroom redux on top was simply overpowered by the burnt edges of the chops. The pulao was a bit better, having a genuine earthy hit to it, but not enough to rescue the lamb. With this dish came more of the naan and a vast bowl of basmati rice. Yes, rice to go with the pulao.I was of no mind to try a dessert after that so that was the end of the meal. Service was professional, if quite reserved.For just short of $50 this was a hugely disappointing experience. Frankly I am baffled at Copper's excellent reputation. It's a beautiful space and clearly a great deal of thought has gone into the menu, but the food is nowhere near good enough at any price point, much less the one charged."], ["Trent S.", "Really good Indian food--heard about this place from one of my coworkers from India. The naan and rice are great, and the entrees include traditional, fusion, and vegetarian options. Of the two vegetarian entrees we tried, the goat cheese koftas were really good--the dal makhni seemed to be a little bland. The setting is fairly formal but not over the top (converted house), and the service is very good.The prices are slightly on the high side, but you can defray some of the cost by using vouchers from Restaurant.com (as of this writing). This is definitely one of the better Indian places in the state, but will probably only return on special occasions, and the outstanding lunch buffet at Taaza Bistro in Burlington remains my overall favorite for food, selection, and value."], ["Abby A.", "Disclaimer: might have given four stars if the service had been better.My beau and I went to Copper on a Friday night to recreate our second date (from four years ago). We made a reservation for 7:30 and arrived right on time. We were seated promptly and then completely left alone for 8 minutes. I know, because I checked my watch. The dining room was busy, but not slammed, however there seemed to only be two waitstaff for the entire business on a weekend night. Seems ludicrous.We ordered samosas, saag paneer, their lamb curry and garlic naan. The food came out in a timely manner and tasted really good. I had asked for no cilantro garnish, but there was a significant dusting of cilantro on everything we received. No biggie, I picked it off and stuffed myself full. Now that we are done with our food we waited nearly 15 minutes for a waitress to come around so that we could get our check and go.I am not slamming the staff, as they were curteous and prompt when they were around, I am admonishing the management. It makes no sense to fill your restaurant to 90% capacity and have barebones staff. Copper is not an inexpensive establishment, and with the prices that are posted, diners expect to have not just tasty food, but a full food experience. That is simply not possible when you aren't properly staffed."], ["Jane S.", "Very rarely do I go to a restaurant that, upon leaving, makes me keep thinking about when I can return.

Indian restaurants, to me, have always been more or less the same when it comes to taste of food and ambiance. Copper, on the other hand, takes Indian dining to a whole different level:Food: Had the mango lassi, naan, and Saag Paneer (my go-to Indian dish). Everything was spot-on and amazingly flavorful. Probably the best Saag Paneer I've had. Ambiance: One of the things that set Copper art was their location - a historic house-turned-restaurant - in the heart of South End.

They didn't take from it because we agreed to a sample. \u00a0I ordered chana masala with no spice. I found out later they call this \u00a0'baby mild' :-). However there must've been some confusion in the kitchen, because the owner told us that there was already an order of chana masala at level four that was confused with my baby mild. \u00a0They brought out a new order of Chana masala (still spicy) that looked suspiciously like my original AND offered a complementary order of any other entr\u00e9e of my choosing. \u00a0The owner strongly suggested the paneer with fenugreek leaves.

Wow, I would have never ordered this if it had not been for the recommendation of the manager/owner. \u00a0 But it was really delicious!Naan - \u00a04.5 stars. \u00a0The naan was very fresh and tasty. Chicken Tikka Masala - Cubes of chicken roasted in a tandoor clay oven cooked with mildly spiced tomato gravy and served with basmati rice - \u00a03.5 stars. \u00a0While the dish was flavorful, it was not the very best Chicken Tikka Masala I have ever eaten. \u00a0I got a 3 out of 6 on the spicy scale and thought the spiciness was just about right. Chicken Khorma - Pieces of chicken cooked in mildly spiced cream sauce with fresh cilantro (coriander) - 4.5 stars.

The samosas were fresh made and light, the breading not too heavy as can happen.

Charlotte had its share of Indian restaurants, few as they might be - but none of them had a good biryani, a good gobi manchurian, or a good (fresh) samosa. There were places with good north indian curries (mostly because of the amount of cream they used), but they either did not have the biryani, or if they did, they made it in the most horrible way possible.This is a brand new restaurant - its barely been 3 weeks since it has started (and I've already been there 10 times - that says something, doesn't it?), and while they are still experiencing growing pains, and having trouble dealing with the crowd that comes in, curious about the new place, the quality of the food, as well as the taste, is amazing. I can flat out say that these guys make the best gobi manchurian I've had in the US (and I've tried it at MANY places). I've already said a lot about the biryani, but let me add one more thing - it takes you back home. Its very tasty, doesn't have the raw masala we come to expect in Indian restaurants in the US, and its very well done.The curries they have are great as well. Due to the limited menu they have currently during the opening weeks, I haven't been able to try all the varieties, but of what I've tried, all of it is super tasty, not extremely creamy, and feels good in the stomach (if you've ever had indigestion issues after eating in some of these Indian restaurants, you know what I mean). The staff are extremely friendly, helpful, and very eager to help. Right now, Bhim (the manager) is probably the only one who is good at what he is doing, but as I said, its a new place, and it will improve over time. The chef is also very friendly, and is always open to any input you might have.Overall, relative to the other places around Charlotte, this easily gets 5 stars.

He tried to order something else that he saw on the online menu, but the server, who we assumed as American, had no idea what he was talking about and looked at my bf like he was an idiot. The server was kind of rude and dismissive in general. I've seen worse service, but still...When the food came, I must say that it looked delicious. It was very well presented and seemed to be very well prepared for what it was. The vada was tolerable. The idli was too heavy. The sambar was not that great, but the coconut chutney almost made me throw up (for an hour after we were done eating). I kept trying to eat, but with every bite I took, I cried to God for mercy. My bf asked if I wanted to order something else. I said only if he was going back to the kitchen to cook it. The dosa was pretty good and the uthappam was alright but I learned that you cannot take your leftovers home unless you want your car to smell horrific after the food cools down on the drive home. We had to stop and throw it out. I may give this place another try, but I'm pretty sure nothing will beat that man's home cooking.Three stars for what was probably decent food to other people, minus one for that rude server."], ["Annie W.", "A huge thanks to Julia S and Tonya P for turning me on to this place.

None of the food items were flavorful for what they were. Schzewan rice was very bland - no hint of vinegar or soy sauce or garlic. Samosa chat was dry and soft, the crunch was completely missing.To top it all, the servers were rude and paid little attention. We had been waiting for one item that we ordered and kept waiting until we could wait no more and decided to leave because of the the main servers asked us to \"empty the table\" as other people were waiting for a table.

However, let's just say the water isn't stellar/filtered. Or if it is, they need to change it.Anyways, what did we order? We ordered the 1. Butter Chicken - I enjoyed this dish. I know I listed this first, but I actually ordered this last because I was curious on how it tasted. If you question on what to order, this is a pretty safe order.2. Goat Curry - I wanted to try something new. The problem with this dish was that it's a little unknown on if you're just going to get a bowl of basically bones and not much meat. That's what made us a little scared about ordering this dish. What came out was a mix of what we expected, some of it was just bones and not a lot of meat, and then some of it was full of meat. It was sort of like half and half.3. Chicken Chettinad - Chef's special. Weird one here. I asked the waiter if it was dry or if it had sauce to it. The waiter said it was just dry rub. In my mind, I'm thinking okay just dry. What came out was it was extremely close to one of the other dishes that we order. I can't remember if it was the Goat or the Shrimp. Anyways, it did have sauce to it. 4. Shrimp Vartha Curry - This dish wasn't bad. It had shrimp mixed with a very similar curry. Both my parents and I enjoyed it.In the end, what did I think of Persis? Definitely a stop for our family if we're craving for some Indian food.

I ordered a Goan breeze to start, was pretty good. It was like a strong pi\u00f1a colada. We started off with gobi manchurian and were sadly disappointed. Gobi manchurian is supposed to have this crunchy texture. It's almost like you shouldn't be able to tell the difference between this and orange chicken which was just lacking here. The we ordered the malai kofta and goat pepper fry. The malai kofta had 4 small, round dumplings and the sweetness of the dish overpowered the spice. On the other hand, the goat dish was so spicy it couldn't be finished. We also ordered the chicken biriyani. It had good flavors but was also lacking in heat. The waiters didn't check on us once nor asked the desired spice levels of our dishes.

It's harsh and spicy but amazing! Unfortunately, the last time the Gobi was not crispy even though we ordered it extra extra crispy. When brought to the server's attention, he argued at first until we asked him to take it back to the kitchen. He returned shortly thereafter only to tell us that the kitchen said it was perfectly done. Since I've been to Persis and ordered this exact dish many times and it's always been crispy, I'm going to overlook it. But it was not a pleasant experience and made me reluctant to go back for a while. To be fair, the waiter later told us that the main chef was off that night, so I assume the Gobi got tossed in the sauce and left to get soggy for a few minutes. Timing is key on this dish. We've also recently tried the Chicken Tikka appetizer, and it was great. \u00a0It's served on a cast iron skillet with cabbage, onions and extra sauce in the bottom so no bite is without flavor."], ["Bony M.", "Always great food here, whether it's biriyani or any other curries.

There was multiple babies crying super loud because it was around closing time and the owners and customers refused to find s baby sitter and brought one year olds to a restaurant. It makes me unhappy that a place that had decent food had to ruin the nuance for its customers and I wish they improve on all of these points. Besides that, the flavors were good for the food but even with only 5 tables in the entire restaurant, the food came out barely warm.

Both dishes are consistently phenomenal. \u00a0Their korma sauce is not your standard creamy sauce with raisins and nuts. \u00a0This is more of a mix between a korma and a tikka masala sauce, and it's my all-time favorite variation. \u00a0The shrimp are also nicely sized and perfectly cooked. \u00a0Their methi is similar in color to a korma (wit just a bit richer color), and it has a more complex flavor. \u00a0The lamb is always cooked perfectly. \u00a0We love our bread, and Persis's naan, roti and paratha are marvelous. \u00a0We always order extra so we'll have some with our leftovers. \u00a0And there always are leftovers, which usually taste even better than even the first time (if you can believe it)!The dining room and atmosphere complement the food. \u00a0 They now play soft, relaxing music, which has improved our dining experience tremendously!

The food on the buffet, while reasonably tasty, is typically served at varying temperatures. I do not know if this is a \"feature\" of Indian cuisine, or if the buffet table itself was broken, not being an expert, I just know that there seemed to be a difference in the temperature level of some foods.Also, while some buffets will provide good service - clearing plates, filling drinks, etc - Saffron is not one of them. The plates tend to stack up and the glasses empty quickly without being refilled.

When we passed on the feedback to our server (point to note: very politely, making it known that we just wanted it cleared because the paneer tasted stale), he actually argued back saying the paneer was fresh.

I have been there at night and I think Saffron is a whole different place in the evening.I consider everything they cook amazingly good, but their specialty, in my opinion, is the chicken tikka masala. It's usually on the buffet and I eat entirely too much of it every time I go. It's probably contributed to at least one dress size that I'm battling.In addition to kick-ass food, the service is impeccable. You take a single drink and someone is right there to refill your glass. Plates are whisked away quietly while you're at the buffet loading up again.Now, as a side note, which may or may not be important to you, the decor in the restaurant is truly lovely. At lunch you notice it and appreciate the delicate artwork and calm but spicy color scheme. But in the evening, this is a great place to take a date. With the colors and soft window dressings, this restaurant is elegant and understated, without being stuffy and expensive.

It was during the lunch buffet and since I'm a vegetarian, \u00a0I thought to myself that you can never go wrong with Indian food. Since we've been to 2 others in the area (Spice South Indian Cuisine which is now Peacock Indian Cuisine and still amazing, and the other place being Jaipur) we thought this place would be a nice spur of the moment change. \u00a0First off the vegetarian options were very slim with only about 4 options versus the many chicken dishes. I got some of the vegetable biryani and naan and my husband got the other vegetarian dishes that I didn't get. I took one bite of the naan and the biryani and was instantly done! The flavor was non-existent and the rice was dry. I tasted the dishes that my husband got and they tasted like baby food and like they had come from a can and cooked in the microwave. I am not Indian, nor do I consider myself an expert on the subject of Indian cuisine, but, Indian food is my favorite kinds of cuisine and I've eaten and cooked enough of it to know that this was NOT good Indian food. Anytime I can cook your food better than you and I'm not \"you\" there's a problem. The food was elementary at best. We spent less than 5 minutes in this place, and even though I didn't feel like I should have to pay a rusty nickel for such a rudimentary execution of a meal, I did ($25 + a $5 tip for NOTHING) simply because I was already so disappointed and just wanted the experience to be over. Anyone that knows me, knows that nothing messes up my day more than bad food.

The first line has a few sauces and a salad with iceberg lettuce, peppers and carrots. The second line had soups and the third had four vegetarian and four chicken options.

They give you a basket of naan upon sitting down. It too was bland and even tasted a bit stale.

We went on a weekday night and there was only one other table seated, so service was good.My lack of experience with Indian food meant I was relying on the menu for guidance. The menu seemed fairly descriptive and I was able to get a pretty good idea of what I was ordering. I was a little confused as to which items were spicy and which ones weren't. It turned out pretty much anything could be spicy (on the ol' 1-5 scale). However, since I wasn't aware of this at the time and wanted something spicy, I decided to go with the chicken vindaloo (which had the word \"HOT\" in the description). I went with a 3 on the spiciness. The dish was quite delicious and it was certainly spicy. In retrospect, I may have actually been okay with a 2 on the spiciness since this left me with sweat dripping off my brow. My chief complaint was with the portion sizes. I thought all the portions we had at our table were on the small side, especially for the price.Though the food was at least 4 stars in my book, the price and small portion sizes of the entrees mean I can't go above a 3.

We aren't talking a super long wait either, just a few minutes extra compared to some other restaurants.Several reviews mention the decor as a drawback. The decor is pretty wacky but I don't eat decor so I really do not care what the place looks like as long as the food is good.

My companion had the Nepalese version with a different sauce, also great. Home made nan hot from the ovens. Quite a tasty experience. The portions were just right, too. I was there on a Saturday night and the place was only half full. This is a small family operation that is barely hanging on. Most everything is made fresh to order and takes a bit of time.

I had never tried Nepali food before and thought that it'd be interesting. Got mango lassi to start which was really good. The owner's wife took down our orders and was really nice and helpful. She suggested that we try spice level 2 (they rate their spice level for all dishes 1-5) as even that might be very spicy. I wondered if my girlfriend would find that too bland, but she thought it was perfect. As for me, even spice level 2 had my nose watering a bit.When we ordered Momos as a starter, she warned us that it'd take time and we could probably get that for a main course. We wanted to split it anyway. So we also ordered a curry (Bodi Tamaa - bambo shoots and black eyed peas) that she recommended and got Garlic Naan with it. I also ordered a Chicken Chowmein. It was a lot of food and we had to get some of it packed. But it was great reheating that for Sunday brunch :-)Service - 5/5. Very friendly, came around multiple times to make sure we were doing al right. And I appreciated the warning that Momos would take time. Food: 4.5/5 - I didn't try any of the Indian dishes. But I really liked the curry and the Naan. Also liked the Chowmein even though it was a little oily (well, Indian chinese is usually really oily) but that wasn't unexpected. I liked the flavor of the chicken pieces in it and liked the slight tanginess of both the chowmein and the curry. I didn't like the Momos as much as I'd expected but my girlfriend loved them and the tangy dip served with it. Overall, very happy with the meal and would definitely return. My previous fave Indian place in Charlotte had been Passage to India near Univ. But the last visit had left me disappointed - maybe the chef had changed or was on holiday.

Instead of choosing just one dish, we were able to experience multiple items from their lunch buffet, and many of them were very good. My favorite was the Chilli Fish, fresh tilapia marinated with spices, fried and tossed with bell pepper and onions. The fish was lightly battered and perfectly cooked. Dora here. Tilapia typically isn't a fish I'd choose, but I really liked this dish. Not too fishy and great flavor.Another favorite was the Tandoori Chicken, marinated in yogurt, ginger, garlic & fresh spices and grilled in a clay oven. This dish was outstanding with the ginger and garlic shining through and the chicken carried a smokey favor. The Goat Curry, baby goat cooked in onion, tomato, and ginger gravy was great over the Basmati rice. My wife's favorite was the Chicken Tikka Masala, boneless chicken breast marinated in ginger, garlic, yogurt & spices and grilled in a charcoal clay oven. Dora here. The Chicken Tikka Masala was moist and tender, and sported just the right amount of heat. Unlike the Chicken Biryani which lit my mouth on fire! One taste of the Biryani and I was begging to switch my iced tea to diet coke. lol. And I really liked the Gulab Jamun, sugar-soaked balls shaped like doughnut holes, and that's what they tasted like: dense, sweet doughnuts. Ernie wasn't a fan. For dessert, we had the Mango Custard, made with fresh fruits. Not too sweet but just the right amount of fruit in a creamy milk sauce. Dora here. The mango custard was light and refreshing, not too heavy after eating from a buffet. And that's another thing. Normally, buffets leave me stuffed and bloated, but neither of us felt that way when we finished eating.Overall, this experience was enjoyable and I would eat Indian food again. I would rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant that serves great food.Ernie & Dora HiersFiction Faith & Foodies Blog"], ["Mohith S.", "Nice place..Loved the Paneer chettinad and Kashmiri naan...Absolute delight.."], ["John G.", "3.5.Food = 4Service = 3I'll rate a 4 to give the benefit of the doubt. The Indian food was pretty good. I was satisfied but it isn't the best I've had. I'll just lay it out there that I'm totally fine being the closed minded American eating Chicken Tikka Masala, and they did that pretty well with it. Service could have been a little quicker though. Also very reasonably priced which helped the rating."], ["Sid F.", "Best Indian food in Charlotte"], ["Brandon A.", "Great food. Restaurant was clean and well kept in a nice area of town. Dinner menu has many options and they'll ask how spicy you want your food. Chicken curry was great! Server was running the register, seating guests, etc, but service was great as other members of the staff seemed to float around and help each other out. This place also delivers if you're in the area and don't want to go out. From what I could tell this was a popular option, as I saw many meals bagged up and ready to head out."], ["Fiana L.", "we decided to try Passage to India out during dinner time, which it's not very busy at all. When you first walk in the place, the curry smell hit your nasal right away. I order a mango lassi \u00a0which taste more like a dessert. \u00a0We got Samosa for appetizer, and \u00a0shrimp biryani, curry chicken, garlic naan and plain dosa for entree. Then the cheese ball and rice pudding for dessert.Overall, the food is ok not very impressed. I do love the garlic naan, which is crispy outside and soft inside. The price is a bit expensive for the amount of food. I probably wouldn't go back here again."], ["Ron B.", "My girlfriend and I went to Passage To India for the first time last night. \u00a0Neither of us have had Indian food before and we were kinda hesitant. \u00a0We heard Passage To India was the place to go. \u00a0They were correct. \u00a0The food was amazing!! We simply explained to our waiter that we have never had Indian food before and could he please help us. \u00a0The dishes he gave us were amazing. \u00a0The place is small and doesn't look like much but don't let it fool you. \u00a0You will not be disappointed!!! We loved it so much we just ordered it for delivery!"], ["James M.", "Lunch box. Do it. Your mouth will thank you. It's cheap. It's tasty. The only thing this place is missing is a drive through."], ["Adam S.", "Absolutely, positively, the BEST Indian restaurant in Charlotte!!What you get at Passage is more than just some of the tastiest Indian you've ever tried in your life. You also get a really unique atmosphere. As soon as you smell the cuisine from outside, you know it's on like freaking Donkey Kong man!!! If it's your first time, check out their lunch buffet. It's a little bit cheaper on the weekdays, but if it's the weekend, you'll get more variety. I find it difficult to try everything I want to try in one trip, sometimes two trips. It's seriously all good! You're going to want to try the Paneer Tikka Masala or Paneer Tikka Masalam as it is the best in town and the Onion Pakoras are fantastic too. Make sure you try a Mango Lassi to drink! If you're not as hungry, ask for a \"lunchbox\". It's only $4-$5 for naan, rice, and enough curry to make most anyone full.Passage is one of those few restaurants that if the place went out of business, you would be really depressed. It may also make you consider not moving if you live close by it. You may or may not be a fan the first time you go, but as I tell all my friends, go three times. It's something about that third time that will make you a fan for life!Also, ask for Andy the owner or Avito and they'll take care of you. By no means am I affiliated with PTI...just a super fan!"], ["Nick L.", "Ordered here this afternoon (Delivery) was definitely quality food nice balance of spices unlike some Indian restaurant I have ordered from in the past where they feed to the misconception of indian food being purposely blazing hot. \u00a0Very professional attendants and food arrived precisely on time (50 mins). \u00a0I had ordered a plate of Lamb Biryani, Goat Vindaloo and some Butter Naan. \u00a0The only disappointment was that the food was a bit cold by the time it arrived, however it is a bit chilly outside today. \u00a0It would have been nice if the restaurant took measures to ensure the food remained hot by the time it reached. \u00a0All in all cant complain, I will definitely order again."], ["Sam J.", "Namaste.I took a coworker here for lunch. Now you've got to imagine, my coworker and friend, was the living embodiment of Aunt B. from the Andy Griffith show. My mischievous nature thought that it might be interesting to introduce her to something outside of her comfort zone. Passage to India is a neat way to be introduced to Indian cuisine, since lunchtime features a buffet. One gets to try a little of everything. I have to admit, that I didn't know what I was eating the majority of the time - but it was flavorful, and spicy. I was smart enough to get plenty of the yogurt dish, that I characterize as an \"Indian fire extinguisher.\"Service was very good. The buffet was kept fresh, and the employees were friendly. Prices were reasonable. When I asked \"Aunt B.\" if she enjoyed lunch she said, \"yes.\" When I asked her later on if she wanted to return she said, \"uh uh,\" - translation: no. The spiciness was just a little more than she bargained for. ;o)PS: Parking here is pretty much like trying to squeeze into a sardine can, so arrive early or park down at the left side of the building and walk up. There is more parking on the left, next to Arby's, and less chance of door dings. Also be careful of \"idjits\" driving around the blind narrow corner too fast - it happens."], ["Ryan G.", "If you find yourself around Harrisburg, and you like Indian cuisine, this is definitely one you should check out. As an UNCC alumni, I know my way around this area well and there really isn't much on this left-front corner of campus. It really can be hard to spot at first, as it is wedged in the Campus Station shopping center.This place has a pretty sweet buffet. Although I've gone here once, I highly enjoyed their food options and felt it was an average size buffet. The food was of overall decent quality and the service was very tentative. I'm sure most items ordered off the menu are equally as good as what was available in the buffet.The location is not a bad walk from campus. The lunch buffet runs until 3p, 3:30p on weekends. The business delivers and takes orders online."], ["Allen H.", "My girlfriend and I ate there over a month ago. Right when we got inside, it felt awakard as if we were unwelcome and waited to be seated. Of course it was our first time there so we didn't really know much of how the procedure and process of the restaurant works. Apparently, we went in the afternoon because they were still serving their lunch buffet yet we wanted to order from the menu since I've checked few reviews about it. It took them a few minutes longer than average restaurant to give us the menu and take our order, including bringing our drinks. So let's cut to the chase, I couldn't order what I wanted because it was lunch time and that was the whole purpose going there; therefore, my girlfriend and I shared her entree and appetizer. Overall, the food was pretty good and different. The water had little ice and by the time it was refilled, all the ice had melted away already (like really, no kidding). Service wasn't the worse but had an unwelcoming environment. I'll give it another try (next year)."], ["Jerrod D.", "Ate here with some coworkers again lastnight, and again the food was flawless along with the service!!! I couldnt eat anymore I was so full!!! We are so happy we found this little gem!"], ["John H.", "Came here for their lunch buffet. \u00a0The restaurant is located in a strip mall with an awkward parking lot, but once you get into the place, the entire dining room is filled with the aroma of food.Yes it is a buffet, but they kept it very well stocked and very neat. \u00a0 The food was good (I ate too much naturally). \u00a0Lots of vegetarian options. \u00a0Now, I am not an Indian food expert, but I felt pretty satisfied with the price and the food.Servers were very nice and kept our drinks refilled and the tabled bused even though the lunch crowd was growing and busy.The place is pretty cramped and doesn't have much atmosphere, but face it, it really makes the food the star. \u00a0There is a nice mural of the Taj Mahal on the wall but other than that, nothing too tricky or gimmicky here."], ["Ali S.", "I won't lie, me and Passage to India go way back. I used to live in Charlotte, and when I visit Charlotte:I always visit, my Mom, Dad, brother's, sisters, In-laws, and Passage to India. Some times all at the same time if I am lucky.Andy has done a great job, I know he has been there since 2011 at least, and he has come a long way, the first time I met Andy I believe it was at Bombay cuisine an upscale Indian restaurant that I never really ate at, I did some wholesale deliveries there. What Andy has done for Charlotte, was made the best Indian Buffet, and made it available to the masses. I am perfectly comfortable with the prices, and it is well worth paying the extra for the weekend buffet. I am always sure to stop by and visit him when I am in Charlotte.Things I like on the buffet:Gulab Jamon (Usually Weekend)Rice Pudding Chilli GobiGobi fish (Weekend)Tandoori ChickenButter Chickenanything NaanNot going to lie, I don't know all the dishes by name, but I eat it and love it. I remember another reviewer mentioning a paneer dish. Definitely need to get that on your plate too.I usually come for the lunch buffet, as I am more of a budget/binge Indian eater."], ["Sai D.", "Food : 2.8Quality : 3Service : 2.8"], ["Mandip S.", "I dated a girl who lived in front of Passage to India and eventually got married to her. We went there several times and always enjoyed food! Food is prepared with heart! You will enjoy going there too..!"], ["Bruce K.", "This place definitely hit the spot for me and a fellow yelper (Grace check her page out!)We came here for the lunch Buffet which was reasonably priced. ($10 for all you can eat) They had a very nice assortment of Indian food and they all tasted pretty good. And I was told from a friend of mine that it is quite authentic as well. The butter chicken was pretty good and after two plates I was full. Overall, I liked the atmosphere and how they catered to giving you the sense of an Indian culture.But I definitely enjoyed the food and will recommend people to come here to eat their buffet and get a taste of that butter chicken. (and all their other delicious food!)"], ["Priscila S.", "First review I ever make here in Yelp, but I felt like I had too.My husband and I just came back from having a GREAT dinner at this restaurant.It was clean, yuuummmyyy food, great service and the prices are good!I would highly recommend this restaurant!!:)"], ["Elizabeth A.", "Unfortunately for Passage To India, I compare every Indian restaurant to Woodlands and It's hard to match that level of quality.Everyone else's reviews raved about the buffet, but I was here for dinner on a Tuesday. I will definitely try to make it out to the buffet if I'm in University at lunch time.I had been here years ago when the place was Udipi, it doesn't seem like much has changed. We split the CHILLI PANEER appetizer. It was good. I definitely liked it more than my boyfriend but I'm a sucker for any Indian food with lots of paneer. The texture of the panner in this app is a lot like tofu with almost a sweet and sour type sauce over top. Served on a bed of mixed greens, rather like a salad.I tried the MUTTER PANEER as my entree. I told the server I wanted it at a medium level of spicey, but it was pretty mild. Maybe I looked like a sissy and he didn't think I could handle it? :] I was still happy with my selection.My boyfriend ordered the MUSHROOM PALAK, which was okay, Nothing special, nothing bad.We shared POORI BREAD and GARLIC NAAN. Not the best we'd ever had, but still yummy."]]}
