They pay attention to detail and add little touches like cucumber with shrimp sauce on the side when you order crab rangoon. Pad Thai is excellent. Fried rice has flavor. Fried veggie spring rolls are small but are perfectly crispy. Order plenty-you will want more! Crab rangoon is the best I've ever had.

Also had Sauteed String Beans, which were nothing to write home about, just a big 'ole plate of beans.The service is where they set themselves apart.

Don't expect to be blown aware by culinary complexity or innovative dishes and presentations here. But, hey, they carry most of the westernized classics.US CULTURE TIP ON THE USAGE OF THE TERM \"CHOW MEIN\":I learned from my experience here that there is a difference in the US between East and West coast conceptions of chow mein. On the West coast (where I was raised), chow mein refers to the steamed soft noodles and \"Hong Kong style\" refers to the crispy style fired noodles. However, here on the East coast, \"chow mein\" is assumed to be the crispy Hong Kong style, while \"lo mein\" refers to the soft steamed style. Who knew?At Cherry House, however, chow mein seems to refer to a bunch of fried rectangular morsels of friedness. I think they are the ones that you find in soup sometimes. In any case, I was a little let down.That said, in a fix it is a perfectly viable option. The lunch combinations are a fantastic option at $6-$8 for main dishes with fried rice and egg roll, spring roll, or crab rangoon. A filling lunch for two coming in at under $13? I've had worse."], ["Faith D.", "Pretty cheap, pretty good. They offer delivery in a certain areas (so call to verify).

My wife and I were greeted at the counter and took a minute to look over the menu.I went with one of their \"house specials\" the spicy tangerine chicken, ordered with white rice, and an egg roll for $7.

I have gone to other restaurants and ordered $10 worth of Chinese take-out and received an egg roll and soup too- not the case here...although before it use to be- new management ?..or are they just getting cheap?

It wasn't exactly complex in flavor, but it's tough to screw up crab and cream cheese deep fried in wontons. I had a General Tso's combination and I can best describe my impression as underwhelmed. The chicken was a little to crunchy/chewy for my taste and the sauce was not as spicy as a like my general tso's but I suppose these are both excusable if they happen to be your taste. What was not excusable, and really what is prompting me to write this review, was the egg roll. The only reason I was craving Chinese so badly was because I wanted an egg roll. You know how boiled cabbage can be kind of odiferous? Well imagine a wonton wrapper which contained nothing (no egg, no pork, no nothing) but cabbage that smelled, not mildly, of parade route (anyone who has ever marched behind mounted cavalry knows what I mean).

The service at lunch is also great- my glass is never less than half full and the servers are friendly.My favorites here are the Sa-Cha scallops and the Bento boxes. If you order a chicken dish, you can also ask for all white meat for an additional 50 cents. Overall the prices are very reasonable. \u00a0And there's usually a lunch special with soup/salad and entree for like $5 or so.You won't be blown away by this place but you'll have a good meal here.

Crab rangoons tasted typical, no wow factor. For the entree we ordered sesame chicken and chicken Singapore noodles. I actually enjoyed my friends sesame chicken. The portion was more than enough and the sauce was delicious! As for the Singapore noodles, it was rather bland, definitely needed more curry.

We were to go but everything went very smoothly. Food was hot and was ready in 10 minutes on a weekday night.The average: One thing I'd say is that the summer rolls were a bit plain. Very fresh with a touch of basil to differentiate, but without shrimp or seasonings they were all texture. The included peanut sauce didn't mesh with them, IMO. I'd also like their fried rice to be a little more exciting/better as I know day old rice is the best but this may have been a day and a half or maybe two. Very few veggies/egg.The good: Our main courses, MuShu and a veggie stir fry, were delicious. The MuShu in particular was probably the best I've had in Charlotte though I'll admit I haven't tried a huge gamut. They included enough pancakes (thank god!) and the flavor was excellent even without the plum sauce.The veggie stir fry was a bit plainer but honestly we also got the plainest sauce that wasn't my first choice.

Nice flavor overall, but shrimp had that frozen/ peel- n-eat taste and texture... Watery and bland, rather than rich and chewy. \u00a0This shrimp problem is way to common in our Queen City. \u00a0 We also shared chicken with black bean sauce . Sauce was tangy and good - broccoli \u00a0was fresh and crunchy. The chicken was thinly sliced but texture/ taste not great.

The rice was good, veggies okay, but I felt the shrimp was probabaly frozen. I wanted to give them another shot for an entree so went this past Thursday and ordered the vegetable egg roll, wonton soup and chicken with mixed veggies. The egg roll, one of the most bland egg rolls I have ever had. It was cabbage only with an overwhelming flavor of pepper and served with an absolutely extreme mustard sauce, ugh. Spit it out and passed on that one. The wonton soup had a good broth, however I felt it needed a little more flavor. And, the wontons, there was no pork inside, just raw wontons, another ugh! The chicken and veggies was good, finally a Chinese restaurant that serves fresh chicken. The veggies were good, but the brown sauce was a little greasy, and the bottom of my plate reflected that.

It is not on the menu so ask for it, in fact, if you are heading there, call ahead to insure that they will set aside an order or two for you.My wife and I fought over the final one and ended up making a second order which we laughed through as we slurped them down. \u00a0So yummy will go there today for lunch.Their won ton soup is PERFECT, being golden yellow, flavorful and not greasy or infused with soya sauce. \u00a0Marvelous with those soft delicate won tons. \u00a0Do wish that they would have a larger order and one with vegetables. \u00a0Will have to ask for the \"wor won ton\" type of soup.I find that the portions are fair, but not generous. \u00a0Rice is a measured bowl and the servings are OK for two people, but far short of what you get at other places. \u00a0You might find that where you order two mains you might want an appetizer or a third main.And don't expect spicy. Cantonese food is generally not spicy, so please ask if they will juice it up if you like more zip to their dishes. \u00a0Some dishes they will and others, no. \u00a0Chef's call.It was no surprise to me when I found out that the chef of this family-owned restaurant is the former chef of Wan Fu in Charlotte. \u00a0This is another reason to know who is in the kitchen. \u00a0It makes a lot of difference.Jade Dragon is located in Quail Hollow, off of Rea Road in South Charlotte. \u00a0It is in a Harris Teeter shopping center which also contains more of our favorites, like Brooklyn Pizza, The Lodge and Mai Japanese Restaurant.It is a great restaurant."], ["Amy M.", "Just tried this place for the first time tonight.

The beef and broccoli-bland and undercooked. \u00a0The meat was definitely a shade of pink inside.

The curry sauce tasted more in line with flavors I'd expect from Indian food - sweet and heavy on the turmeric - and like it maaay have had its origins in a bottle or package of some kind, but it was still good, and pleasantly, mildly spiced. There were large chunks of vegetables in the mix, and they are not stingy with the shrimp. The brown rice was good and chewy, and spring rolls served piping hot and crispy, straight from the fryer.It may not be the most authentic international cuisine you'll ever eat, but when pressed for time and watching your budget, Soho is as great as anything you could want.One last thing - be care with the address!

The egg roll and scallion pancakes were hot and tasty, but our entrees were disappointing. I ordered honey walnut chicken and was served honey walnut shrimp. This wouldn't have been a big deal, but I have a shellfish allergy. They corrected the error, but when the chicken was served, it was burned and it was clear that the veggie garnishes were transferred from one plate to the other.

What worries me however is that I visited for the first time as I was coming off of a smoothie cleanse. At that point I'm afraid anything would have satisfied my hunger.We ordered the Korean-style wings, an order of beef bulgogi and pork dumplings. The wings were meaty and I will say I was a fan of the sauce. However, at just over $1/wing I can't help but feel kind of ripped off. The bulgogi was one of those things that I was happy to see as I typically only get to indulge in it in New York or DC/Northern VA. I'd say it was \"good\". It was almost \"very good\" but for some reason I kept getting a very \"gamey\" flavor from it. Other than that it was a generous portion and the rest of the flavors hit the spot for what I'd consider decent bulgogi. That brings us to the dumplings. These I would most certainly pass on! If they weren't from a bag of frozen dumplings from an Asian market then I have serious worries for the cook given that my first attempt at making homemade pork dumplings was light years ahead of what I got out of the dumplings here. Like I said, I can't help but think they were just frozen dumplings and for that I would avoid. I know this can sometimes be difficult when dumplings (otherwise a delicious nugget of goodness) are on the menu.Service was great! We were in for lunch and although it was just us and another table the server were very attentive and didn't make us feel rushed.

I don't know how their Chinese or American dishes are since I never get them, but the Korean dishes are great!This time I had the Dolsot Bibimbap and it was very well serviced. The cute cashier asked me if I'd ever had it before, to which I lied and said no. She gave me a very nice and friendly lesson on the dish, the name and what it means all while practically prepping it for me and serving it. She stirred my pot (no pun intended) and suggested how to eat it and what not. Very nice.Before my Bibimbap arrived they bring out a bowl of shredded chicken soup, some kimchi and this sweet pickled radish with sugar which was out of this world.So, all in all, it was a great visit, great food, great service and great info.But let's knock off a couple stars.One because I've had better Korean food and because when you first walk in, you can get a little confused between the Chinese and Korean and hamburger signs on the wall.The second star was lost (and I'm being nice here as I usually knock off two stars for this sin) because they serve you unfiltered water.

You want the Korean menu, which has detailed descriptions of the dishes and photographs of most of the options, making it less intimidating for first-timers.I was pleased with everything we ordered including the delicious Korean seafood and scallion pancake, the noodle dish japchae, the BBQ pork and the bi bimbap, a personal favorite. One disappointment was that the selection of banchan or panchan - tiny dishes, often pickled served with the meal - was limited to just 2: tasty kimchi and pickled radish. At other places (of course I'm comparing to Atlanta) you get at least 4-5 different options or possibly more. Still, I can't complain since the main dishes and the banchan we were given were delicious and definitely hit the spot and satisfied my craving for Korean food.

You get an egg roll, soup, an entree, and a fortune cookie for under $10. Mine usually lasts me at least 2 days- that is, if I don't end up eating the leftovers the same night.

How much time needs to pass between meals?)I also, as a general hater of restaurant websites, find their website pleasantly well-organized and informative. Hours, location, menu, types of payment, tasty pictures of food, and printable coupons. Winning. They do deliver, but since I can see their building from my front door, I pick up.

Now it's time for me to give them props :)The restaurant is very clean and well lit. When we've gone there (usually at lunch time it isn't super busy) and we've gotten great service. Very attentive.

I give a lot of credit to the servers because from what I've seen they're responsible for guests dining in and dealing with phone/takeout orders. Not easy to do. In any event the service has always been great.The food...To be honest I can't really speak on their selection. I haven't really perused the menu too much. The lunch specials have been too appealing to look beyond them. I've tried a couple of things on the lunch specials menu and they have yet to disappoint. Not only were they good entrees, but the portions are big and they come with choice of Rice, choice of soup and an egg roll. I know that it's not uncommon for Chinese restaurants to have lunch specials which include those things, but it's always nice to get value for your $$$. Good food + good portions + sides for a low price = great deal. Now to be fair, the food doesn't blow me away. It's good, and it's better than mall food court asian food in terms of quality of ingredients and taste, but doesn't necessarily stand out compared to other traditional sit-down Chinese places that I've tried. But I've always had a good overall dining experience there and the food is always meets my expectations. It never disappoints. If I could I'd give it a 3.5 I've done carry out from them as well.

The tofu was sort of just added to the sauce (not prepared with it) and the vegetables added were literally the \"peas and carrots\" you'd find in the frozen section of a grocery store.

Burned on the outside, dry on the inside and the gravy had the consistency of peanut butter. Sweet and sour pork is just ok, more breading than pork, sesame chicken was bland and overcooked. My last visit on 1/28 was perhaps the most disappointing of all. I walked in to order take out. I ordered sweet and sour pork and vegetable lomein. Got my order and got home to find vegetable fried rice instead. First let me say they do not seem to use regular rice, it's more like instant rice in all their dishes. I have never gotten anything with actual fresh vegetables, the have to be either frozen out of a bag or come from a can. The only difference in the vegetable fried rice is they add some soggy broccoli and and those little corn cobs out of a can. Otherwise it was simply a big pile of fried rice. The only thing consistent about this place is that the portions are large and it's cheap if that's your thing. To me cheap and quantity is still a waste of money if it is not good.

Another thing I like is they offer dinner specials that won't clear out your wallet and with that you get the entree, fried rice, eggroll AND your choice of soup. And the entree comes in a snazzy, durable container that will bring me more use in the future. I got the sesame chicken dinner and loved that it came with fresh veggies (I am using the plural loosely as it was only two pieces of broccoli but don't mind because it was so green and fresh and not drowning in sauce). The egg roll was a mini eggroll but really, after all that food, I don't need an eggroll on steroids. The hot and sour soup was standard but it seemed spicier than other places and left my nostrils clear and pleased. The dinner portion was huge which left half for me to enjoy later.

Since we're just around the corner from Beijing, we thought we'd give it a solid, college try. We looked up their website (beijingcharlotte.com) and were pleasantly surprised that their menu was available online. We scanned through and ordered the Crab Rangoon, General Tso's Chicken, Shrimp Fried Rice and Beef w/Mixed Vegetables. What can I say, our fridge was reeeaaallly bare, we wanted leftovers! I wish their website offered dish descriptions of each item. It would be helpful to know what exactly composes Schezwuan Beef. Hubs went to pick it up, as they do not have delivery service as of yet. A local food review mentioned that they were hoping to add that service in the near future. While I didn't pick up the food, hubs said that the place was decent inside. Nothing crazy, but a comfortable spot to stop for some quick food. Our food was ready in ten minutes - nice! Once our Chinese feast was brought home I tasted each dish. The General Tso's was my favorite of all the dishes. It's not the healthiest menu item, but the chicken had a well-spiced sauce on it and it wasn't heavily breaded. I could have handled more heat, though. The shrimp fried rice was just ok, I was expecting more veggies and egg within the dish. It was mostly shrimp, fried rice and chopped onions. The crab rangoon was quite tasty but the beef with mixed vegetables was fairly bland. I don't want to write off this place just yet, as their dishes were prepared fresh and none were greasy at all. I think I'll try a few new items next time and maybe ask for a bit more heat in my dish."], ["Hailey H.", "Hungry for chinese food mid afternoon on a Sunday, the proximity of Beijing to my house made it rocket to the top of my list.

Super pumped it would be ready in under 15 minutes, but everything kinda dwindled after that.We both got a chicken & veg dish (moo goo gai pan and chow mein), but since the only starch in either was fried rice, the only difference between ours was the vegetable selection. Yes, the sauce tasted exactly the same, like thickened water with a touch of chicken flavour. We also ordered the steamed dumplings, which were good but the top to the sauce wasn't put on all the way so we were forced to eat them dripping in pure soy and sodium. We also ordered a salad with ginger dressing (I know, I know, from a chinese restaurant) but the \"dressing\" was so thick it was just like eating shredded marinated ginger on lettuce. You win some, you lose some.

We even ordered fried pork intestines. For those of you who are adventurous, the intestines are worth a try. The outside is crispy with a soft and chewy interior.

I turned to Yelp to find the highest rated spot and Dim Sum seemed to be the best option. I called my order in and figured the food would be great based off the very thick accent on the other side of the phone. My meal consisted of basic Chinese-American fare which I figured would be a safe bet for takeout. I got back to the friend's apartment I was visiting to find that there were no utensils in the bag with our food (none were on display at the Dim Sum restaurant counter either.) The friend I was visiting had just moved in that day and had no accessible utensils, causing me to leave AGAIN to run to the nearest store and pickup forks. When I finally got to eat my dinner, I was severely disappointed. The sesame chicken was okay- the flavor was adequate but the meat tasted cheap and the sauce appeared to be cut with water. The thin, diluted sauce pooled at the bottom of the bowl making the undersides of the chicken soggy. I tried to ignore the fact that the sauce had been contaminated since, after all, it appeared to just be water.Then I tried the fried rice. My biggest regret in life is that I swallowed the bite off my fork rather than spit it back out. Knowing that the rice was being processed by my body severely grossed me out for the rest of the night. I couldn't decide what would be worse- digesting the rice or the taste of throwing it back up.Enough about how the rice made me feel and more about the reasoning why: It tasted like it had been soaked in a marinade of water and half decayed cigarette butts. There were no vegetables mixed with the rice and the texture itself seemed as if it had been through a continuous cycle of sitting out, getting microwaved and then set back out again. over and over. When I went to throw out the entire container after my first bite, my friend protested and offered that he would eat whatever I did not wish to finish. Some background on this particular friend of mine: He will literally eat anything. My friend took a forkful of the rice and had the same immediate repulsion that I myself had endured. His exclamations reasserted my claim of the cigarette taste that clung to the underside of the throat in a heavy aftertaste that entices one to get sick out of some evolutionary reflex.Maybe the actual Dim Sum cuisine is fine if dining in. Maybe the kitchen doubles as a smoking lounge. Whatever it may be, I regret the overpriced $20 I spent to not be able to actually eat my dinner."], ["Vladimir P.", "I knew the food would at least be alright when I walked in: my group and I were the only non-Asian table there.

I just haven't been able to find a Chinese restaurant in center city that lives up to it. They're all either not as good, more expensive or both. The only conceivable complaint I can see being made of this place is that the wait staff can be a bit terse and may make some feel rushed.

I think they just know that nearly all their customers are regulars and figure they know what they want almost as soon as they sit down."], ["Mark L.", "A fellow passenger on us air recommended this restaruant, and after 2 visits, \u00a0its a good recommendation. \u00a0This is probably the best chinese food I have had in town, however I am only giving 3 stars because of the way they serve the food.I think most people would experience chinese food as served family style. \u00a0In otherwords you may order a dish, but its pretty much a free for all when it gets to the table. \u00a0Thats how it works in my family anyway (disclaimer, I am not chinese)If you haven't been here, its kind of hidden at the farthest north part of the parking lot."], ["Jackie C.", "First of all, This review is only base on lunch time because I've never been there at dinner, HOWEVER this place been open for a LOOOOONG time as far as chinese restaurant goes in that area, this place is PACKED for lunch almost ALL the time in the weekdays but the service is incredibly fast and the food comes out quick too so the wait is usually minimal or none at all. \u00a0their lunch special is only around $6-$7 so very reasonable and its always delicious i've been there for probably over 30 times for lunch and i've never had a dish i dont like, \u00a0their meat, their sauces is very flavorful! if ur in the area and have a thing for some good ole chinese food for lunch, give this place a shot! u wont be disapointed!"], ["Ryan N.", "This place is a good value for the amount of food you get. I love their hot and sour soup. I highly recommend it as a lunch spot but it wouldn't be the first on my list for dinner."], ["Kristi H.", "This is my go to Chinese place in Charlotte. The night I moved here I went with my parents, my mom is really picky about Chinese, and raved about it for a week after. I went again a few weeks later and ordered something different and again everything was amazing! Their hours are a little weird so make sure you look them up before heading over. My fav is the black pepper chicken. The chicken is perfectly cooked, seared not boiled like most Chinese and the veggies are perfectly tender with just the right amount if bite."], ["Tony B.", "My favorite Chinese restaurant in Charlotte. We've been going here for over 10 years - the scallion chicken is my favorite. The food is always very good and very reasonably priced. I'm puzzled by others' comments on the service - We've always had good service."], ["Zia T.", "Had lunch here today and had the best Orange Chicken I have ever had. It was crispy and perfectly seasoned! Orange chicken, rice and an egg roll was $6.95! I don't typically go here - it's a little out of my way but today reminded me to go back! Service was great!Taipea South is located in the Food Lion strip shopping center behind Burger King and across the street from Lowes (Johnson Road near Highway 51)."], ["Brady H.", "I haven't ate here - but wanted to ask a question. I popped in to check out the menu since I was really excited to find a restaurant with the word \"Taipei\" in the name. However, none of the dishes looked Taiwanese. The menu is typical Americanized Chinese food. Maybe there is a secret menu?Can anyone who is familiar with Taiwanese food and not just standard Americanized Chinese food comment?thanks!"]]}
