This was decent but not nearly as good as the chicken dish. I had to add a little soy sauce to bring out the flavors. But it WAS good. I guess I've eaten at so many great Thai places around the Continent that my expectations were a tad higher.One criticism is the lack of a decent wine list! With Asian food they should have some semi sweet whites by the glass to choose from. They didn't, unless you count White Zin in that category. I don't.

I think it was maybe wet dog. Service was really good, and we ordered pretty basic dishes; I got chicken pad thai, and he got chicken something. Mine was fine, but just a little dry, and his was better. For those two entrees and two glasses of wine, it was $35. Not too shabby.I'd give it another try, but I'm not in a hurry."], ["Michael L.", "My kids and I eat here every time we get a chance. The spice is perfect and the curries are spot on and delicious.

I've actually never noticed this restaurant despite the millions of times I've frequent this road and passed this exact location. One of my friends recommended Bangkok Ocha and raved that this is his favorite Thai restaurant. Let's be honest, I ignored him. The dull, insipid exterior does not exactly scream \"GREAT, AUTHENTIC THAI FOOD HERE!\" Nonetheless, the boyfriend and I decided to pop in last night and give Ocha a try!We ordered the stuffed chicken wings as our appetizer. \u00a0I must warn you, patience is key since everything is made to order. Boy was it worth the wait! The dish is accompanied with a sweet and sour peanut sauce. Crushed peanuts floated on the sauce's yummy horizon. I added some spicy peppers (\"hot sauce\") and BAM, perfection! Kinda felt horrible, but I couldn't resist asking the waiter for TWO refills on the sauce.For the entree, my boyfriend settled on the Curry Fried Rice and I went with one of my Thai favorites, Pad Kee Mow (pan-fried noodles stir fried with various vegetables, tomatoes and FRESH basil!). We asked for a level 4 (out of 5) of spiciness for both dishes. The main reason why I LOVE Thai food is the abundance of flavors, herbs and spices. \u00a0WOW.. Ocha delivered just that! Not at all exaggerating, but with the first bites into the entrees, all my worries drifted to the ceiling and I was in food heaven! SO many different, yet distinctive flavors between the two dishes. The Pad Kee Mow was steaming of fresh basil. The Curry Fried Rice was what really stimulated my taste buds, the most compelling flavors and spices that I've ever had in a Thai dish. Level 4 of spiciness allowed the perfect amount of spicy that complemented the other flavors and not at all overwhelming. We topped the prefect meal with Thai tea. I couldn't believe my luck, even the tea was more abundant in flavor than other Thai teas I've had. That was it. I officially fell in love with Bangkok Ocha!The only recommendation I have is to reflect the amazing spice and flavor of the food onto the design of the restaurant. I love hole-in-the-wall restaurants as much as anybody, but the flat decor and exterior does not do this place any justice! The restaurant is nice and clean, but the lighting is dark (and no, I do not mean dim), rendering the place dull. I think with a little bit of color and lighting, Bangkok Ocha will get the attention it deserves! Regardless, the service and food is so amazing that once they get people in the door, they're hooked (noticed most of their customers are regulars that the staff knew by name!)."], ["Julia M.", "I have not been to Bangkok Ocha in quite a while... but came to have lunch with my sister here the other day. \u00a0We both decided to get the chicken Pad Thai on this visit. \u00a0I ordered mine with a spicy level of 3..it was good, but it was not quite as spicy as I had hoped. \u00a0The menu is very reasonably priced for lunch. \u00a0Service was good. \u00a0I definitely need to get back over here for dinner sometime soon, since I really like their version of Penang Curry here."], ["Rowdy S.", "Nice atmosphere.

I was happy to find solace in Bangkok Ocha for lunch with a deer chum of mine. Certainly a diamond in the rough for those who have not tried it. A quaint Thai resto with a lack of glitz and glam - my kind of joint. All about the food and service. You can't set your drink down without them filling it right back up! So rad. Food: They start you off with soup. It's some sort of rice-y, broth-y soup that has a somewhat peculiar color. Off white-ish. Very flavorful and salty. Contains some sort of protein as well. Either tofu or chicken, but not certain. I ordered the Pud Kee Mow. One of my favorites at any Thai place. Flat, pan seared noodles with veggies, chicken and plenty of spices. The flavor is very earthy and peppery. Huge portion for lunch, too. They give you a nice spring roll with your entree that isn't incredible, but definitely a nice touch for an already generous meal. Me and my buddy ate for just $18. Not too shabby, in my opinion. Definitely will be back for lunch again soon. This city has so many Thai options and I'm happy Bangkok Ocha is one of them!

Not sure where that came from, but it tastes like a watered down egg chowder for me. I'll pass on that. But, I ordered the pad see ew (which on their menu reads pud see ew) and it was quite tasty. A generous portion of chopped up flat, rice noodles with a soy sauce base, a bit of broccoli and bits of tender chicken. Considering it was lunch and I still had meetings to get to, I asked for a 3-star spice level (out of 5 stars) and it had quite a bit of heat!

That's what the spice tray at each table is for. (Rant complete!)

I'm not sure where they went wrong but it was terrible all around. Instead of choosing your protein (as is common with the dish), this chef is confused - they include chicken, shrimp, and something else I couldn't quite make out; the flavor was just 'off' from what Pad Thai should be - that's as best as I can describe it. The spice level also left much to be desired - I ordered 'Thai Hot', the spiciest they have and the dish packed as much punch as a wet noodle, no pun intended. Lastly, the consistency of the noodles was just wrong - either it was too soggy or too wet and the noodles were round instead of flat so it didn't feel quite right in the mouth. And the price? At $14.95, this was the most expensive Pad Thai I've ever had; I wish I could say it was worth it. On our way out (based on what I could see), I noticed that they didn't have a single Asian/Thailander working in the kitchen - it just seemed like a bunch of Southerners trying to mimic Asian cuisine; maybe that's why the food didn't have an 'authentic' taste. Maybe I'm being way too harsh/overly critical, but I'll tell you this - this is the first review I've ever given less than 4 stars; that's saying something. I really wanted to love this place, I did (especially since we live across the street from it), but based on tonight's performance, they're going to have a really hard time winning me back. Oh and did I mention they don't have a lunch service? A Thai place with no lunch - that's like McDonald's with no breakfast."], ["Diane U.", "I found myself at Basil after a haircut and decided to get some takeout and wait for it at the bar. The restaurant is really beautiful and has a classy atmosphere. Our go-to thai dishes are larb, Pad Thai, and panang chicken. Panang curry was not on their menu so I ordered larb, Pad Thai and a shrimp and vegetable dish. I noticed it was pretty expensive, so was expecting it to be really good. I drank two drafts while I waited and the staff was really nice. The manager stopped by and spoke to me, he was very personable. The bill came to $64. When I got home, my husband and I opened it up and found a very skimpy portion of larb. It was tasty, just not very much. The pad thai was fine, not great. Clumps of noodles not mixed in, chicken was dry. The shrimp dish was a container of steamed broccoli, cauliflower and cabbage with 5 grilled butterfly shrimp. The sauce was on the side. No rice. Overcooked shrimp, undercooked broccoli, wet cabbage, sauce was ok. This was a $25 dish and I was not impressed. We usually have at least enough leftovers for one person to have lunch the next day, but that was not the case this time because there just wasn't that much food.Since I can get delicious succulent Thai food from other places for half the price, I won't be returning to Basil."], ["Michelle H.", "Really enjoyed our visit to this restaurant! \u00a0The food was absolutely delicious with so many vibrant flavors! \u00a0The ambiance was really nice, and Howdy provided great service with some wonderful recommendations.

The panang duck was tasty as well - nice thing about duck is it is fattier than chicken so can take some overcooking, and I think mine was a bit over. It was complimented by plentiful broccoli, carrots, and snow peas. The sauce had a good level of heat for me - which is to say, spicy but not too spicy.

Our service was good - the waiter was very nice and kept my glass filled, so no complaints here.We each ordered lunch specials, which come with a spring roll and soup. The soup didn't do much for me - I assumed (which is my fault) that it would be a creamy tom kha-type soup, but what we got instead was vegetables in a clear broth. The soup wasn't bad by any means, it just wasn't great. I could take it or leave it. The spring roll was good, though. Crispy, not too greasy, meatless filling.I can't speak for what my companions had, but I ordered the Pad Krapraw with chicken and it was pretty tasty. I'd give it 3.5 stars. At Thai restaurants I haven't been to before, I always get medium spice instead of hot just in case it's a place that is generous with the chili peppers, and I'm glad I did here because the medium was quite hot. Not, like, blisters on the insides of my cheek hot or anything, but it wasn't a medium. I'm okay with that though, since I like my food on the kicky side. The rest of the dish was perfectly spiced too - you could tell the basil and onions were there, but they didn't overwhelm the dish.

Their version has a lot of savory gravy (so if you are into the dryer stir fried chicken wraps, this may not be for you) Stir Fry: Pud Prig Pow, which is the classic thai basil stir fry. Nice flavor, with good amount of basil.Noodle: Lard Nar. This one isn't always available at some of the other Thai places around town.

AMAZING. (and they didn't even charge extra)Let's talk about the spice level... most places around town it's on a scale of 1 - 5, here it's 1 - 4... and 3 eventually triggered the waterworks.

The equivalent difficulty in cooking a few of these dishes would be chicken wings, spaghetti, and beef stew. \u00a0I tasted everything (I chuckle now when I say \"taste\" simply because of the name of this restaurant) and did not enjoy a single thing. The meat was either dry or tough, the flavor was either lacking in one dish or foul in another. \u00a0It also seemed like the cook was trying to be \"creative\" but ended up tasting (haha, there's that word again) like a disaster.This place is busy and I have heard good things about it from locals. \u00a0I have also heard that before this place opened, no one really has had Thai food before. \u00a0My experience with people and Asian food, actually food in general in NC, is that people don't know the difference or don't know any better. So readers....here is my recommendation - skip Thai Taste and go to Thai 1st Bistro @ Blakeney and get yourself some decent Thai food! \u00a0It's worth the drive.A message to the Thai Taste owners: stick with simple basic Thai cooking. \u00a0Stay true to the flavors and ingredients of Thai food by keeping it authentic."], ["A W.", "Never in my life have I been ACCUSED of something when simply trying to pick up my to-go order! I walked in to retrieve my order of Pad Thai, to be confronted by a hostile, fire breathing woman asking me if I had written a negative review on the Internet because whoever did....placed an order similar to mine. I told her no, that it wasn't me...because surely there has to be another person on earth that has placed an order for meatless Pad Thai. She asked me again. I told her once more that it was not me. She then summoned an older women to the front where they exchanged foreign language shenanigans and at that moment, I no longer was ok with this bullying by little angry Thai women. It was also apparent that they had decided I was the guilty party before I even arrived, so I definitely was NOT ok with eating that (probably tampered with) food. I was a patron of this mediocre place because it was closer to me than Basil Thai...but from now on, I will drive further for better service and better food. And now....I definitely am writing a negative review and will shout it from the mountaintops that this place has horrible service with food that is extra average & should not be patronized!"], ["Peter E.", "I find myself in agreement with some of the other reviewers (some of whom I'm never in agreement with). I've been here several times for lunch and a couple times for dinner.There are few options in Matthews-Mint Hill for Thai food, so Thai Taste Matthews serves to fill that void. A unique corner space in Matthews Station across from Town Hall, Thai taste is elegantly decorated and staffed by warm, welcoming employees.For lunch, they are fantastic. A variety of menu items that arrive well executed. I find their lunch portions to be just the right size, too: not so small you find yourself snacking but not so egregiously large that you need a mid-afternoon nap. I'm not the biggest fan of heat, so you order your spice level using 1-5. Two is usually where I fall, especially if it's in a coconut sauce with a slight sweetness to cut the heat. Friends who are into hot and spicy are happy with a 3.Dinner, on the other hand, has not been as kind to me. The prices are noticeably higher for many of the same dishes and the quality seems to lag. Maybe I've just been on bad nights, but it has happened more than once and worthy of noting.For a quick Thai fix, especially when the mood strikes midday, Thai Taste will certainly fit the bill if you are in Matthews."], ["Todd R.", "Not only do I love this place, but I'm quick to send friends. The soft spring rolls are fresh and very authentic. The taste brings back memories of Southeast Asia. when within 30 miles and looking for Thai, this should be your first pick."], ["Seth A.", "Thai Taste has good reason to be the oldest Thai restaurant in Charlotte; its bursting with flavors, very attentive wait staff, and reasonably priced. \u00a0I recently visited the Matthews location (across from Beantown Tavern and the public library) and I was filled and fulfilled with what I ate.My friend and I began with the spring rolls. crispy and not saturated in oil. \u00a0Our waitress explained the different lunch specials and combinations of meats (4 meats and tofu) and curries (three of varying heat). \u00a0I ordered the sesame chicken lunch special. \u00a0Unlike sesame chicken at Chinese restaurants, the sauce was not at all heavy and sweetened beyond recognition. \u00a0The chicken was white meat and lightly fried, covered with a spicy, sweet sauce and fresh broccoli florets, served with a large bowl of clumpy white rice. \u00a0I sipped on hot jasmine tea from a small kettle, which the waitress replaced twice and offered a third refill. \u00a0Who does that?For $14, I think is a great place to get a \"catch up\" meal with a friend. \u00a0If you eat too much, you can always walk it off in downtown Matthews. \u00a0Kudos, Thai Taste!"]], "Mai Thai II": [], "Basil Thai Cuisine": [], "Thai 1st Bistro": [], "Deejai Thai Restaurant": [["Samantha K.", "I went to Charlotte for a concert and went to Deejai before heading to our concert.

It is way less filtering of to go orders like Thai Taste on East. Great intimate dining space to enjoy some of Charlotte's best Thai! The service is top notch and the food is outstanding. I enjoyed the Pad Kee Mow with chicken (spice level 4 , +1 to the typical) and it was full of flavor AND heat which is rare! The chicken was no mystery meat. We also enjoyed the spring rolls - those were top notch!"], ["Claudine S.", "This was a wonderful surprise. My parental units were tired and asked if I would bring home some grub. I wasn't in the mood for the usual pick up and take home - so decided Thai and something on the way to get my girls their dog food as well. So Yelp pointed me this direction.. They are def on my de-lish list. I was immediately greeted once entered. I sat at the bar, ordered a chardonnay while I looked over the menu. I ordered the Basil Fresh Rolls, Tom Kha soup with Tofu, Pad Thai Beef and the green curry with tofu as well, this was plenty of food for 3. I even had left over's for the next dayMan, it was damn good! It is a bit pricey, but worth it! I will be going back for sure!"], ["Dimitri T.", "The quality/price relationship doesn't get any better than this family owned Thai restaurant. \u00a0Excellent place to meet with friends or a business lunch. \u00a0Service is always good, and the food excellent. \u00a0I'm addicted to Panang Curry (with chicken), I often have to force myself to order something else."], ["LH P.", "Worse Thai food ever!!!!!! Absolutely NO flavor, too salty! Meats smelled like old rotten fish! Fish was a bit fishy seem like have not been cleaned good. Nothing taste like Thai! Not recommended! The 1 star is for the water boy and the nice outside sitting area."], ["Liz K.", "Really good Thai food. \u00a0Desserts were ok, I liked the fried bananas, though."], ["Kellie K.", "I always forget Deejai Thai exists because it's tucked away next to the Manor, but it popped up on my radar screen one Wednesday night, and away we went. \u00a0I like going to Deejai a little bit later on a weeknight because parking is easier in the strip mall lot, and when it's full, it feels full. \u00a0Honestly, the crowd usually makes it or breaks it for me. \u00a0The night we went most recently, it was about half full and felt energetic, and I didn't feel like I needed to scoot my chair all the way in til it hit my spleen to get some room. \u00a0However, I do love that it's dark and romantic... because then I don't have to wear makeup.The service was prompt as usual, and I got the chicken pad thai ($12.99) while the fella got beef pad see u ($12.99). \u00a0Since it was a Wednesday night, one of their bottles of wine was half off, so we got that, too! \u00a0I was in the Clean Plate Club after about 20 minutes of inhaling my dinner, and the fella said his was good but mine was better.I really need to do a better job of remembering that Deejai is out there. \u00a0Now if only I could figure out how to pronounce it..."], ["Linda H.", "The food was excellent but walked in at 2:45 and it was very obvious the hostess wasn't happy about it.

Won't go back, at least for a good while."], ["John F.", "I moved here from San Francisco and San Diego (homes of great Thai food) and this is by far the best Thai restaurant we found in Charlotte. It's just as good as my favorites there. We have yet to eat inside the restaurant - we order takeout. The Pan ang Curry is just as delicious as my favorite Thai restaurant in San Diego. Also, the Pad Thai is delicious."], ["Jen C.", "The sushi and thai dishes here are amazing. \u00a0I love to get a curry dish with a request that it be a level 3 spicy, which is the spiciest. \u00a0The sushi here is amazing, as well. \u00a0I would definitely make a reservation on the weekends if you can. \u00a0There is usually a Groupon offer - $22 for $40 but they are currently sold out of those so that was a disappointment. \u00a0My boyfriend and I consider this \"our place\" because we went nuts here one night and everything was absolutely amazing!"], ["Shauna C.", "I went to Deejai Thai for dinner yesterday and really enjoyed it. I decided to go with the Lemongrass chicken and it was spicy but mouthwatering. I opted for noodles rather than rice and it wasn't a problem. The dinner portion was a great size for $12.99, and it would be enough for leftovers (though I'll admit I ate the entire thing). I also tried a bite of the Pad Prik which was slightly less spicy but very flavorful as well. I loved all of the veggies in both dishes- they were plentiful but light at the same time. We started with spring rolls and basil rolls- both were tasty- but I don't think I am as big of a fan of basil rolls as some of the other folks here though as I could have gone without them. The atmosphere is nice & clean, and the service was good as well. I will definitely be back to try some of their other dishes. Great prices and delicious food!"], ["Erica L.", "Mom treated me to a birthday lunch yesterday. \u00a0We beat the lunch rush since we got there around 11. \u00a0Nicely decorated, cozy seating. \u00a0It looks like they also have a nice outdoor patio seating area when it's warmer.Started off with complementary chicken rice soup (although the menu says free soup or salad with dine-in, we were not given the choice) and those addictive crunchy fried noodles with the sweet chili sauce. \u00a0Of course we ordered Pad Thai to honor the tradition of eating noodles on one's birthday \"for long life\". \u00a0It was yummy with the jumbo prawns. \u00a0We also tried the Pad Prik with seafood, but turned the spice dial down to mild. The second dish was just okay, and there was a higher proportion of rice to seafood and veggies. \u00a0We both split each meal and had enough to split a second smaller meal the next day.Service was fast and friendly. \u00a0I would not mind going back to try a meat dish or their dinner menu."], ["Julia M.", "I met a co-worker at Deejai Thai for lunch on the way to a meeting. \u00a0We met at noon and were seated right away. \u00a0 \u00a0We both decided to order Penang Curry w/Chicken. The service was super-fast and the food was very good. \u00a0 I would definitely eat here again."], ["Maddie M.", "Let me start off by saying that the food here was very good and if I just had to judge them by food I would give them 4 or maybe even 5 stars. We ordered the green curry with scallops and eggplant, the Pad Prik and the basil rolls. Everything was delicious! The green curry was mild yet full of flavor. I think they have at least three different kinds of green curries, but the scallops one was good, especially the eggplant part. Usually eggplant (if not cooked all the way) makes my tongue itch and I've heard it happens to a bunch of people, but theirs was very well made and I felt nothing but bliss on my tongue. Careful with the Pad prik though, it can get spicy. If you are not very good with spicy, you might want to ask them for a spice level 2 (default is 3), but I would never make the mistake of making it 4 or more unless you KNOW you and your insides can handle it. The basil rolls were really good as well. All the flavors melded well and the sauce was not too peanutty. Someone else from our party had the mango pudding with rice for dessert and were really happy with it. They said the mango had a very nice flavor. The ambience was nice as well.My only problem was that these guys don't have a baby changing station despite having a big bathroom. We had a four month old baby with us who needed to be changed so I accompanied her momma to help out and was very surprised to not see a baby changing station. The bathroom was big enough to fit one in, but nope. We had to lay the baby down on the floor (of course we put a changing mat under her) and it was just weird for her mommy and I to be squatting down by the toilet, trying to change her up while she kept wriggling around and flailing her hands off the mat on the bathroom floor. Normally I wouldn't strike down the stars to three for not having a changing station, but last night's experience with a baby and us on the bathroom floor was just not a nice experience at all. Also, the server took forever to bring our checks. We were just sitting there for 10-15 minutes after we finished out dinner and the plates were cleared, just waiting for the server to bring us our checks. I'm not sure I would go here with a family again, but for date night it might be good."], ["Paul S.", "Deejai, I want to love you. I do. Sometimes you take me in your arms and give me what I crave. Other times, it's like you aren't even there, like you don't care any more. I deserve better than this, but I keep coming back to you. It's embarrassing when someone I care about comes into town and it's my responsibility to take them to a favorite local place and really show off what Charlotte has to offer. And I bring them to, say, Deejai Thai. We order. We get two bland dishes. We send them back and reorder, and get 1 amazing dish and another bland dish. I can't keep going like this, Deejai. I need someone who's there for me all the time. I want to give this place a 3, earned wholeheartedly by their curries, spring rolls and their drunken noodle. They are hands down the best in the area. But without the support of a good Pad Thai and many other dishes, I can't reasonably give this more than a 2. Stray not beyond the confines of those few dishes, for you will wander into a world where taste, spice and flavor have been forsaken. And you will be sad, and embarrassed if you've talked the place up to an out-of-towner. Celebrity most likely to enjoy eating here: Charlie Sheen: I imagine he'd be too drunk to care about the blandness of the dishes. Half hour to live and I have to get my last meal here: The drunken noodle never disappoints."], ["Tim H.", "Awesome atmosphere, friendly staff. \u00a0Only reason I didnt give 5 stars is because the pad kaprow only had ground beef and not beef strips. \u00a0But that's more of a personal issue I suppose."], ["Rachel S.", "I really enjoyed our Deejai experience.At first I was a bit skeptical because the place was so crowded and it took forever to get a seat... we learned our lesson and will DEFINITELY book a reservation next time. Deejai is a TINY restaurant and is very crowded because the food is the bomb, so take my advice and call ahead!Once we were seated the experience was truly top notch. They had great sake (I've never had bad sake, just to be fair), Thai beers on the menu, great spring rolls and some mouth-wateringly good entrees. I ordered the mixed vegetable dish with chicken (I think the Thai name for it had Ruam in it, but I honestly don't remember). My fiance ordered a chicken curry dish that was spicy and absolutely delish!We'll definitely return, but next time we will be armed with a reservation :)"], ["G.R.
