Came with a horseradish spicy dipping sauce and marinara sauce, which were both good-Bruschetta Quattro: the bacon and ricotta bruschetta was incredible, the steak was also really good, and the other two were standard but good options. Great app to share!-Side salad: I give this a separate mention because it was HUGE; filled me up before my entree with the apps and was very tasty with fresh lettuce, tomato, onion, and cheese-Mediterranean shrimp: only 5 shrimp but they were flavorful, juicy and each were fairly large so no real complaints. The orzo was decent as were the vegetables it came with.The service wasn't great by any means. Our waitress filled our drinks, was quick to take plates and was fairly nice, but they messed up multiple orders. One of my colleagues specifically asked for no gorgonzola on her salad but they put some on anyway. Then she didn't want to make us wait so she asked for the lobster bisque soup rather than having them cook steak for the salad over, but our waitress returned with minestrone instead. The food was also very, very slow to come out so I would avoid this location at lunch time if you're trying to get a semi-quick bite and get back to the office."], ["Jon B.", "Whenever I'm around the mall during the week, I always try and make it a point to stop here for happy hour. From 2-6:30 (and 9pm-close) they do bar bites in the bar area ranging from $3.95-$5.95. They also have a selection of cocktails ranging from $4-$6.HH Drink Recommendation: The Italian lemonade ($4) -- vodka, gin & orange liqueur blended with fresh lemonade. It's basically a long island without the Coke ... and it's basically delicious. It's loaded with liquor, so you're definitely getting your money's worth for $4. HH Bar Bites Recommendation: 100% first order should be the Black Pepper Shrimp ($5.95). It's 12 pan seared shrimp served over crusted eggplant (think eggplant parm without the cheese) and covered in a delicious pepper cream sauce. The Sausage, Pepperoni & ricotta flat bread ($4.95) has great flavors to it. It's just the right amount of spicy sausage toned down with ricotta & a house made tomato sauce. New to the menu is Italian \"tots\" ($3.95.) They're good, not quite what expected. They're basically breaded/crusted mashed potato balls with bacon & cheese.

I tend to snag lunch from Brio at least every other week and have stopped in for happy hour several times as well. I have never had bad service and the food is top notch. Stellar patio with a cover area if you please. The steak bruschetta is the way to go for an app but I also end up back at the lobster bisque as it is stupidly good even in the summer. I usually wait until they bring the bread at the beginning and then dip it in the soup - your service will bring sourdough bread as well as crispy, thin, seasoned pieces to start off with. I have no clue what the crispy pieces are but they sure are tasty. The beer tends to be a little higher priced as $6 for a Blue Moon is more than I'm used to but hey, welcome to South Park.

The eggplant/shrimp dish is scrumptious; it has a very yummy sauce and the carpaccio is HUGE, especially for an appetizer. It comes out in the biggest plate you will ever see and has a tasty salad, flatbread slices and capers on top to make it even better.

Both were pretty good (a little light on the liquor) but still very tasty. Appetizers:My dad ordered the lobster bisque. It was fabulous! Very creamy and rich...with perfect flavors...Be prepared to practically lick the bowl! Yum. My mom had the Chopped Salad-cucumbers, tomatoes, feta cheese and black olives. It was also very tasty! Really good combination of flavors...and the dressing was delicious. I chose the Bistecca Insalata which is basically their version of a wedge salad. It's a wedge topped with Gorgonzola cheese and bacon with a creamy Parmesan dressing. I was a little disappointed with the ratio of lettuce to toppings...I could have used more cheese and bacon BUT the dressing was divine! Like, so good I asked for extra so I could dip the bread in it! Ha. Dinner:My dad chose the Sausage Peperonata Pomodora it comes with sausage over angel hair pasta and tomatoes....delicious! It was a huge portion and the sauce was awesome! My dad really enjoyed it! \u00a0My mom had the crab and lobster cakes again winners...nice chunks of crab and lobster not a lot of filling or breading....I'm still dreaming about them!

And the steak came out exactly as I ordered...and that cheese was to die for..I could seriously eat this...again and again! The only downer was the veggies, they were a little over cooked and not seasoned to my liking. But when everything else is so delicious this seems irrelevant! We were wayyy too full for dessert!

When I go out to eat, very rarely do I opt for Italian since I can make most of the dishes at home. However, I had a BOGO coupon for this place and decided to check it out. It was a gorgeous night so we had a short wait for the patio area. I like how they have cushioned seats outside where you can get drinks and also eat if you choose to instead of waiting for a table. They had an intriguing selection of wine and I had a smooth, robust pinot noir while waiting for our table.The service could have been better as our waiter wasn't too attentive. He did the job but forgot an item or two that we requested however the artichoke crusted beef medallions redeemed the bad service. They were absolutely perfect---cooked just how I ordered and they melted in my mouth. It was served with mashed potatoes and a hearty portion of fresh veggies and I couldn't have asked for a better meal. Others got the pasta which wasn't drowning in sauce, which is a nice change of pace compared to some Italian restaurants in the area. The chopped salad was wonderful as well-it reminded me of a greek salad.I absolutely love the patio area, selection of wine and was very happy my meal along with the variety of their menu.

I can't blame them; great location, valet parking and decor that makes Olive Garden a 70's mom-and-pop Italian Bistro. I could honestly care less about the superficial details of any restaurant. Atmosphere will never hide the taste of mediocre entrees. And that's the case with Brio. The atmosphere of the restaurant is classy, service is great and made me feel relaxed. This all dissipates when your main entrees are served. You're brought back to the reality that there was a hidden cost to this atmosphere. My order was a Chicken Parmesan with their much coveted \"Italian Herb Pasta.\" When you look at the picture of what I was served you will understand why I have the following opinions.It looked like a novice chef beginning his first day on the line. Nothing was special about the meal at all. Herb pasta was probably the only part of the dish that had any new or exciting taste bud busting flavors and even that was short lived. I looked around at the other meals being served at my table and it was pretty much the same. Olive Garden dishes in a fancy location. For the record, Olive Garden is just as sub-par and I'm in no way promoting Olive Garden rather providing a comparison for you to visualize. I'm not a person looking for massive quantities when I come into a place like this, but I'm expecting fresh ingredients. The salad was withered and the fresh vegetables looked just the same. If you're looking for a great dinner atmosphere, then by all means come and enjoy the place.

And since the VA one was in a mall, it lacked the outdoor seating that this one has. Which is a definite plus!The food here is terrific. I'm a fan of their pastas. Good portions, nice flavor. Good stuff.We also had the chocolate molten lava cake. I must say, it was delicious. Service was fast and attentive. Our meal was out pretty quick.

It was kind of awkward for me because there were only a couple people in their 20's there, but at the same time, it was pretty interesting to see, lol.I really only came here to eat though, and have a couple drinks before going out. Food was on point. The bread and crackers were delicious. I preferred the crackers; there was cheese on it or something. We started off with some calamari and then I had the veal marsala classico. Calamari is always good anywhere-- the pieces were pretty large too. It came with two sauce, a mayo that I thought was too rich in taste and a marinara sauce. I like to mix the two...

The patio is great for chillin out with appetizers and wine in the summer time.. the place does get packed during special occasions, but they move pretty quick..

While the mozzarella didn't meet my ideal (i.e. buffalo-milk-based bits of heaven), the salad was fresh-tasting and hit the spot. I also tasted my dining mates' salmon salad, baked ziti, and shrimp scampi. All were good, but the grilled salmon salad really stood out. \u00a0It came with a diverse assortment of marinated vegetables (artichokes, mushrooms, red pepper, etc) that really elevated the salad beyond just plain ole lettuce & fish.I regret not getting to try out Portofinos' pizza, as I was repeatedly told how delicious it was. \u00a0You can watch the pizzas being made through a glass partition, which was a nice touch.

I had my mind set on ordering a sauvignon blanc but was told that they didn't have any so I settled for a glass of pinot grigio that very much tasted like a cheap glass of wine. I ordered the arriabbate which came with a side salad and Italian bread.I decided to try the house salad dressing, which is tomato basil, and it was very good. Not too heavy but not too light either. The Italian bread was the true star. It was slightly warm and served with butter. Absolutely delicious and I even asked for a second bread basket #allthecarbsplease.My main dish, the arriabbate, was just OK. I was expecting to taste more of the flavors but all I could taste were tomato and olives. The prosciutto that it's supposed to have was very inconspicuous to my taste buds.

Why don't you set your nicest restaurant in the group apart by offering a truly different menu? And two items our group ordered were nothing special (snapper and lasagna). Only my hubby's mare (a high-end version of seafood linguini) was worth getting again.3) Service was extremely slow, and our server was not very attentive to our group. Again, it wasn't what you would have expected from a high-end restaurant. I much prefer Luce over Toscana, and will likely never return here for the reasons I mentioned above.

The menu is interesting, local and broad. Nice wine list and attentive service. They even added a special chocolate Happy Birthday message to our desert.

I definitely will go back to experience the rest of the menu."], ["Alissa H.", "Great food and service. Went hear to celebrate our met-iversary \u00a0(1st time we met). Service was the best I have had in a long time. The waiter, Rich, explained everything. I liked that he said the prices of the specials and additions without having to inquire. We ordered the lobster hush puppies. They were good and the jalopenos \u00a0were very spicy... Great flavor. I ordered the lobster and grouper. Lobster was delicious and buttery. The grouper was okay not heavily seasoned but the rice like( I think to risotto ) was yummy in the sauce. My fianc\u00e9 got the filet done medium. It was cooked to order and he enjoyed it. The food came out nice and hot. \u00a0And everything timed perfectly. We also each got the Caesar salad ... Well worth the $3 each additional. He did order a martini ... He liked it but the name I can't remember but it was citrus and champagne like. For dessert we tried the beignets \u00a0... Yummy and the accompanying coffee gelato was impressive!! Definitely recommend this place. It's nice, intimate and worthy of any special occasion (including just because)."], ["Rod And Can R.", "FIG TREE RESTAURANT- was absolutely fantastic. We went for my Birthday, this is defiantly a hidden gem in Charlotte. Very Romantic setting, friendly waitstaff.We both had the ribeye which was very tender and seasoned perfectly, every bite left you wanting more. \u00a0The dish was served with Char and a cream sauce with mushrooms that was good as well. in addition to the meal we opted to add on a lobster tail which was just okay. \u00a0We finished dinner with cheesecake which was overrated for the price.This is defiantly a Special Occasion or a Fancy Date night kind of place, very pricey."], ["Ashley N.", "Fig Tree is one of the best restaurants in Charlotte.

Everything that I have ever ordered from seafood to desserts has been excellent. They have an expansive selection of wine. You will not be disappointed with the Fig Tree."], ["Chris H.", "Very enjoyable experience. The bread, and cheeses are fantastic. I can't lie; the entrees were a little underwhelming for the price. Do: - Take advantage of the lengthy wine list- Order the flight of ice wine"], ["Zack H.", "Excellent restaurant! My first time dining in Charlotte was a great experience at The Fig Tree. You can eat outside on the front porch on a beautiful 80 degree evening.The garlic spread was way too strong for me, but the Lobster Hush Puppies and Chorizo Stuffed Calamari were amazing. Ask for the Calamari to be pre-sliced for bite sized portions. I guess they normally serve it as one large piece, but our request for smaller pieces was nicely met. They should consider serving this way, as the presentation was quite nice.The Grouper and Maine Lobster Tail over Rissoto really couldn't have been any better! Not fishy at all, and bursting with flavor!"], ["Sapna B.", "I SO badly wanted to give five stars to this review -- however I had to deduct one due to all but TWO dishes (out of about 8) being average.I came here Saturday night with my husband and another couple. \u00a0We started with a few appetizers -- Escargot, Scallops & Foie Gras. \u00a0Everything was amazing. \u00a0All the flavors were so well balanced, the dishes were flavorful and we were very pleased. \u00a0The Scallops were cooked PERFECTLY and I know that's not an easy ingredient to perfect. \u00a0For entrees we ordered the Grouper & Lobster, Elk Chop, Veal Chop and Truffle Ricotta Ravioli. \u00a0The Grouper & Lobster was AMAZING. \u00a0It was served over a Saffron Risotto which was delicious and the fish was cooked perfectly. \u00a0The lobster had a delicious flavor to it but you could also taste its inherently sweet flavor. \u00a0However it was definitely a small portion of fish and lobster for the price of $42. \u00a0The Elk Chop was disappointing. \u00a0The sides that it was served with didn't complement the dish well and also the meat was very dry. \u00a0My husband sent it back and ordered Scallops instead which were good, but not great. \u00a0At $37 for 6 scallops, it should be great. \u00a0I didn't get to try the Veal Chop but it looked amazing and my friend had rave reviews. \u00a0The Truffle Ricotta Ravioli was a BIT on the salty side -- but delicious none-the-less. \u00a0For dessert there were so many delicious things so we ordered three items -- Peanut Butter Pie, 5 Layer Red Velvet Cake and Beignets. \u00a0I thought the Beignets were the BEST. \u00a0They were freshly fried and served with a delicious cinnamon creme and also accompanied by a scoop of coffee gelato. \u00a0The sweet beignets with a bite of the coffee gelato was to die for. \u00a0The Peanut Butter Pie was good as well, I loved that it was served with a caramel peanut brittle. \u00a0The Red Velvet Cake was good too -- more chocolatey than red velvet though, which is a good thing to me.I would definitely return if we come back to Charlotte!"], ["Nick V.", "Loved the menu. Wide variety of seafood and game. Service was delightful and the cheese was stinky and satisfying- local honeycomb superb touch.

Enjoy!"], ["Georgia O.", "The whole experience was amazing. We started with the ginger martini and the sparkling pear. The drinks were delicious and a perfect balance between sweet, sour, and strong. We ordered both the escargot in a Gorgonzola cream sauce and the foie gras with bacon praline. Both were amazing and our waitress did an excellent job pairing a wine selection with each. As for entrees I ordered the rabbit saltimbocca and my husband ordered the elk chop. While my rabbit was quite yummy the elk was out of this world perfectly cooked, seasoned well, and melt in your mouth tender. We finished the meal with the chocolate Aztec cake, rich moist and spicy. It was served with a delicious horchata ice cream. The best restaurant I have had the pleasure of dining at in Charlotte."], ["Dawn K.", "Amazing wine selection. \u00a0Impeccable service. \u00a0Had trigger fish special delicios!

We started with an octopus appetizer which was pretty good and went onto to our entrees I had the Elk chop and my husband had the Grouper with Lobster. The Elk chop was nice and tender and the horseradish spaetzel was okay. The grouper and lobster was pretty good too. However the reason why I am giving it three stars is because I think it is a little over priced. Our total came out to be around $150 including two glasses of wine. I think the overall experience was good but for my husband and I, the food here was not worth the total on the bill. We don't mind paying for a nice meal but not if the food is not worth it."], ["Craig R.", "Great ambiance, mostly attentive staff and food was so so.

My boyfriend and I went here the other night just as a regular date night. Our server JD was more than helpful with menu items and had a very bright and cheerful personality. We shared a bottle of wine for dinner and I got the Sea Scallops which were divine. My boyfriend got the pasta dish (I forgot what it's called), but he gobbled up the whole thing so I'm assuming it was very tasty. Even the dinner salads that come prior to the entree were amazing. It is a bit pricey, but if you have nice company to share a night out with or have a hot date ;) this place is the spot to go."], ["Steve C.", "Wonderful experience.

Food - My husband and I ordered an apple dish for an appetizer. He was reluctant but I figured it cannot be bad! It was actually good and refreshing to eat. Definitely a great starter before the main show. I ordered the scallop dish in a bed of beluga lentils. They did a great job with the temp of the seafood. It was perfect for me (I do not like them undercooked). I find the lentils very interesting and it complemented the dish. My husband had the lamb and he really loved it.Price - Definitely a pricey place, but you get your money's worth for a $$$ restaurant. Place - Very cozy decor, home feel, but nice restaurant setting. In some areas, I feel it is a little too small or cramped (especially upstairs). \u00a0I saw people parked next door where it said do not park..Special - The waiter and staff was kind to personalize your birthday or anniversary on the dessert plate. It makes the occasion/dinner special! Service - Our waiter was nice and attentive. It did take awhile to get our check though.. But ah well. Although our experience at The Fig Tree was good. That's one checked off on places to go have dinner dates in Charlotte. I was just not blown away with the place and venue. I tend to prefer the more modern, upscale restaurant for that price.

They did a wonderful job of making it special and pacing the meal so you can enjoy it thoroughly. We were impressed when our appetizer arrived and we were not quite ready to order our entree... The waitress took our menus out of the way so we could enjoy it and then brought them back when we were through. We sat outside on the porch which I highly recommend. It was a very warm day but cooled off (not a ton of sun) by about 7pm. If you plan to arrive by 6 on a week night it will be empty (we were literally the first people there). It gets busier later which adds to the ambience. The feel is quaint and romantic. Our waitress recommended the scallops which my husband ordered and I wish I had, too. I never order scallops and always worry they won't be filling but there were 7 medium sized scallops and they were delicious. The salad was wonderful, too fantastic dressing) and I highly recommend adding the goat cheese. I was pleased with my trout as well. Their wine list is extensive with bottles ranging from $30-$2000. We thoroughly enjoyed our bottle of Walt Blue Jay Pinot Noir.I would give it 5 stars if the feel was a little more up to date (it was a little outdated IMO) but overall our experience was very enjoyable and I would definitely go back."], ["Michael M.", "well prepared and delicious.

We will be returning again for sure."], ["Joshua R.", "A cheese plate featuring 100% water buffalo cheese, elk chops, and the cayenne pepper triple chocolate cheese made for one of the best and most unique Charlotte meals I have ever had. My only criticism, however minor, is the music: \"It's Beginning to Look a lot like Christmas\" and \"Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer\" played on a loop can get absolutely maddening through the course of a one hour dinner service.

As I sat down our waiter brought me my own personal purse rack so my bag didn't sit on the floor. I've never had that happen before at a restaurant! Such great service. I think our server was Chelsea and she checked on us often and was very friendly. They were prompt with water and bread and it was hot and delicious. For dinner I ordered the veal Marsala which was perfect! It wasn't breaded which I love and the sauce had beautiful portobello mushrooms in it. As good as that was, I think the angel hair pasta on the side was even better. Just simple marinara and it was delicious! I had a lovely martini and wedge salad before which were also awesome.

We were able to enjoy the evening and feel like we basically had the place to ourselves! Our waiter was Fernando and he was awesome! He was supper attentive and we always had what we needed and that's no easy task when you have 14 starving ladies! We started off with some sangrias and the bread with marinara. Those sangrias definitely packed a punch. Don't think of your typical sangria mix....kick it up a few notches and you have the Luciano's version. So good! To start, I ordered the Wedge salad which come topped with tomatoes, bacon, parmigiano dressing, and gorgonzola cheese. It's a classic, \u00a0not overdone or too fancy. Add to that the dressing was perfect! I'd definitely recommend. For \u00a0my dinner I ordered the Shrimp Fra Diavolo. My goodness.

How I wish he had ordered a flat bread instead...Anyway so we get our items and very excited to start.... And I taste something weird in the first bite and the bites to follow.... There was sour taste to the ravioli, my other confirmed the sour taste in his too and we told the server and manager about it,..They confirmed that they received the ravioli just a day ago so it wudnt have spoilt etc... I asked the manager to taste it to check if that was how it was supposed to taste... Of course he dint taste it and offered to get us another one..... We should have just asked for something else at that point...Anyway in about 20 mins me and my colleague got our raviolis again and this time with much lesser sauce....it still tasted sour !!!The manager stopped to check and I was blunt about the sour taste again..., and then he says... This time the chef confirmed they received the packet with goat cheese stuffing in the ravioli and that might be resulting in that different taste.....Well I would have loved to know this before ordering as I can't stand goat cheese at all!!!All said and done, I dint enjoy what I ordered but that won't stop me from going back....

Reservations were made so it made dining on a Saturday evening a breeze.We were greeted and immediately seated in the room off of the main dining room. The main dining area is very nice, all black & white decor. Our table of fabulous ladies started off dinner properly with glasses of wine. To note, if you order a glass of red wine, the wine will be poured into a comically oversized wine glass. My glass of sauvignon blanc appeared in an adequately sized glass.For appetizer, I ordered the fried zucchini. Forgive me, because I forget the actual Italian name for it. They were delicious!! Thin zucchini patties served with arugula and a side of marinara sauce for dipping. Main entree, I ordered the seafood cannelloni. I wasn't as happy with this dish. It tasted a little too shrimp-y for me. Dessert, I got the chocolate cannoli. It was good but nothing special.I found the portions to be just right and the meals were spaced out with just enough time in between. A lot of the time with restaurant week menus, the wait staff seems to rush to bring out the dishes with you not being able to fully enjoy each plate.

However, because of the beautiful way it was handled and the incredible understanding and sympathy of not only our waitress but also the manager on duty, I can hands down say that it was a completely honest mistake on the part of the kitchen, something that after our experience would be examined and re-examined so as to never happen again. With that saying, we truly had a, aside from this one incident, an incredible experience and I would visit Luciano's again in a heartbeat. I always forget how much I love Italian food until I have fabulous Italian food, Luciano's reminded me of that love once again (note: my partner in Italian, that is no accident friends!). We were lucky enough to be able to set up a reservation an hour before we wanted to eat online and walked in and were seated right away. Immediately we felt welcomed, by our waitress and the manager, who at the time we didn't even know was the manager. I love that they have a manager on duty that greets each table and brings bread, water, etc., just welcomes people to the restaurant. The bread is made out-of-house by baked in house and is fantastic, especially when paired with an incredible, somewhat spicy marinara. Funny, my Italian partner makes homemade sauce often, and his favorite thing is to dip fresh bread into the sauce, must be an Italian thing! For entrees we ordered the BBQ Chicken Pizza: Smoked chicken, red onions, avocado, fresh cilantro, and the chicken parmigiana. I honestly couldn't say a negative thing about either dish, they were superb. The pizza would be a good two person meal or appetizer. I loved the new take on BBQ chicken, the avocado, red onion and cilantro complimented it perfectly. It's not often, after having a \"bad\" experience in a restaurant, that you'd rush to go back.

They also do a very respectable calamari. We tried the lunch \u00a0combo's; choice of salad, sandwich & dessert for $12ish. Service is solid except our waiters name was Roy! Shouldn't it be mandatory that they be named Guido or perhaps Alberto. We had fun with that!"], ["rene m.", "Had the Duck two way for dinner ,it's a \u00a0very delicious and rich plate.The service is good and if you like people \u00a0watching get a table outside.Will come here again."], ["Fabiana F.", "I tried to think of some reason as to why I shouldn't give Luciano's 5 stars and, as you can tell, I couldn't think of a single one. I absolutely love this place. We've lived less than a block away for over a year and finally just ventured over and we're SO happy we did! I like the inside of the restaurant as it's decor is very nice but not stuffy, it feels homey while looking like quite a 'fancy' restaurant - which is hard to accomplish, but they did it.To start, our servers have always been 100% spot on; Great personalities and great service. Along with our main server, there is plenty of staff to keep our waters and delicious bread filled. We have also never waited long for our meals, no matter how packed it been or what time of night. Managers come by and sometimes there is a band playing. Plenty of people to keep you happy while at Luciano's. Now for food...holy delicious. Our first time we tried a pasta and one of their chicken specials for entrees and both were a great amount of food, not too much but very filling and both just tasted so good(note: I have been looking everywhere for a chicken marsala as good as my dads and Luciano's is as close as it gets). Tom was really impressed with how many meatballs and mozzarella were in his pasta (apparently other places really skimp). Another time we went for just appetizers and I'm gonna lay this out because we were amazed. We got the carpaccio and I swear, enough for 6 people and perfectly done. There was plenty to go around for just us two and the aioli and arugula salad on top was great. We also got the calamari which were cooked perfectly and also had the great aioli sauce to compliment it. However, for me, the Holy Grail was their Scallops and Artichoke antipasti (bow your heads for a moment). It was perfect. The scallops were cooked perfectly. The long stem artichokes were tender and so so tasty and perfect. The pancetta, perfect. And...the lemon sauce, perfect. I had to ask for an entire other bread basket just so I get every little bit of that lemon sauce. Amazingly perfect. Okay, enough about my obsession with the food and scallops. We love this place. They always find us a seat, we always have great service, there is complimentary valet, the vibe is awesome and the prices are surprisingly modest for the quality and amount of food. I can confidently say, this is my favorite Italian and restaurant in Charlotte so far. Check it out."], ["Brittni C.", "FAVORITE! As most foodies know, Charlotte has a lot of great Italian restaurant options and I'm a pasta lover through and through! Luciano's is my absolute favorite. The menu has so many options, the appetizers are all amazing, and the wine selection is perfect! I've never had a bad meal or anything less than exceptional service! I'm a pasta + wine person and my boyfriend had pizza + beer -- we were both happy! I've been for regular dinners as well as special occasions - Luciano's is perfect for both! I can't wait to go back and enjoy the patio : )"], ["Lucinda L.", "I really can't find any objection to my recent trip to Luciano's. I ordered a flounder dish which is new on the menu. Another dish had English peas which I love. I asked that they be added and the chef was happy to do so. Wine by the glass was very good and the service at the bar was attentive.Luciano's is a really good restaurant- I need to go more often."], ["Sarah C.", "Let me explain..FIVE STARS for valet parking, excellent service, excellent atmosphere, excellent ambience, excellent dessert. THREE STARS for our dinner which was such a bummer. Again beautiful presentation but the taste lacked. The Fettuccine Alfredo was runny almost a soup needed heavy cream and a egg yolk to thicken in our opinion. The mushroom ravioli was ok, needed more sauce and maybe a tad more salt. The baked goat cheese dip was yummy and the bread was very tasty.

I went there with my family for Easter brunch and was so impressed by the food, service, and ambience of the restaurant. We were able to order from both the special Easter brunch menu and their regular lunch menu. We started with calamari, which is the best I've ever had. The breading on it was not overwhelming and it was perfectly cooked. Half of the table ordered blackened salmon (with linguine) and the other half ordered sea scallops and risotto--both were impeccable. The salmon was well-seasoned and cooked to order, the pasta sauce tasted fresh and homemade. I was especially impressed by the scallops. I have often had overcooked scallops but these were tender and flavorful. The risotto was out of this world. Again, everything so fresh. The service was wonderful. They were polite, friendly, and accommodating, checked on us, and offered us a rack to put our purses on. They kept our waters full, and our tables clean.On a side note, I was also very happy with their restrooms. Often, restrooms are neglected or unkempt. On the contrary, this restroom was very clean, stylish, and they had the best quality toilet paper and paper towels to use. They even had Listerine for use as well. It's the attention to detail that makes the difference.I would recommend this restaurant to anyone, and will definitely be returning. It made our Easter brunch very special."], ["John C.", "After being spoiled with the fresh Italian food from Vincenzo in Cincinnati, this is the closest one that we can find in Charlotte.Start with their Carpaccio and Calamari. Then you should ask for the spicy black ink pasta. It's not on the menu, however most of the time they have this on their special menu. The secondary option would be LINGUINE FRUTTI DI MARE."], ["Jeff S.", "Some of the food at this restaurant is decent but the whole experience is not worth the 5 stars many reviewers give it. \u00a0I was tempted to give it a 2 star rating but I figured 3 is a good rating for an average restaurant. \u00a0The decor of this place is beautiful...a far change from what used to be there before. \u00a0My friends and I were seated at a table next to the window. The place was not too busy when we arrived on a Saturday night but it quickly filled up. \u00a0The odd thing is that our server explained the dinner specials before even taking our drink order. \u00a0I ordered a Chianti which was about average in my book. \u00a0I later switched to a dirty martini which the first one came without olives? \u00a0Our server said he would go get some but they never arrived. \u00a0Maybe this is a new trend but wine glasses are not even filled halfway anymore and they still charge you $8 or more for the wine. \u00a0Also here, they charge you for the vodka and add another charge for a martini. \u00a0I just thought that was strange. \u00a0And $10.00 for a martini with the house vodka. \u00a0Ouch. This place serves bread with a marinara like dipping sauce which was quite tasty. \u00a0One of two things today that were worth my money.I ordered the lasagna and a chopped salad. \u00a0 The salad came out right away and it was tasty with an Italian vinagrette dressing. \u00a0The lasagna looked more like a gourmet casserole with what looked like wide egg noodles instead of lasagna noodles. \u00a0It looked appetizing but once I bit into it, there was no flavor...no garlic, no Italian spice flavors. \u00a0Shame. \u00a0I actually had to smother it with red pepper flakes to give it some flavor.Service was really hit and miss. \u00a0It took forever for the entrees to come out. \u00a0It took forever for a second round of drinks. Overall, \u00a0this place is average. \u00a0Average food that you can find and the run of the mill Italian place and average service. \u00a0Dinner prices are reasonable. \u00a0They have a few expensive items like chilean sea bass and a few others but where they get you is with drinks. The kicker is that my friends and I still do not know why this place has a higher rating than Fiamma on the the other side of Dilworth. \u00a0Fiamma is by far better than this."], ["Lorees R.", "I am really sadden to say that I was under-whelmed and very disappointed by my experience. I planned a wonderful surprise bday dinner for someone special in my life and the service of the restaurant did not come through. Though the staff members \u00a0were nice, \u00a0it left me regretting my restaurant choice (which was between 2 other Italian restaurants). First, I made reservations and added a note \u00a0to the reservations that this was a bday dinner and to please make it special..only to get to the restaurant 10 minutes before our reservation and still had to wait almost 30 minutes..to which my partner asked \" what's the point of making reservations\". While at the restaurant I told the hostess that it was his bday and to surprise him with his name written on the dessert plate, but when the dessert came out there was no bday message. And to top it all off, the spaghetti served with our meals lack any flavor. My selection of this restaurant was based on its advertisement of a more sophisticated, sexy ambience, but when we got there it was bright, cramped, and noisy. Now I understand that you can't select who comes in and how they're dressed or how loud they speak, but \u00a0if someone makes a reservation with specific notes that's this is a special date and also tells the hostess upon arrival the same, the least that could be done is to call and notify the person or at least write happy birthday on a plate. Bright side, the mash potatoes were good. I gave it a 2 star because the staff were friendly, unfortunately they were not helpful."], ["Carl S.", "Solid neighborhood Italian spot.

Lunch portions are enough to fill you up. \u00a0I had the omelet special with roasted potatoes and fresh fruit. \u00a0The omelet was stuffed with onions, peppers, mushrooms, ham and cheese. \u00a0It was delicious. \u00a0The birthday girl received a free strawberry cheesecake which was delish. Service was excellent. \u00a0They tacked on a 20% gratuity which we thought was a bit much. \u00a0But, one of us crossed that out and added her own tip amount. \u00a0I keep forgetting to do that. \u00a0But, will remember next time. \u00a0Atmosphere is lovely with tablecloths (even for lunch) and chandeliers. \u00a0Very nice."], ["Michelle S.", "This place has it all.

Ambiance- romantic, classy, yet still good for a family dinner with little ones2. Decor- modern with traditional accents3. Service- courteous, attentive, and inviting4. Food- light but decadent enough to allow those Italian flavors to come through5. Value- a final bill for a family of six in the amount of $88!!!! It would have been higher if we would have ordered their seafood or angus steak plates. Next time.Our server Ronald went above and beyond attending to our table. Patient and attentive. He didn't up sell on any dish and pretty much told us we can't go wrong with anything in the menu. Overall, our plates ranged from individual pizzas, chicken under the oven, Fettuccini Alfredo, and chicken piccata, which we all loved. The bonus was making our daughters birthday dinner here more special by presenting her with a chocolate brownie with a side of ice cream. It was absolute bliss, according to my daughter.

The Chicken Parma is the best I have ever had due to the freshness of the chicken and the preparation.I do have a problem with this place and several other \"Italian\" restaurants in Charlotte. The ownership group being from Latin America does a great job, but the red sauce here is not a priority for them. I love red sauce at Italian places and their red sauce is not great. Fiamma is also has Argentinian roots and does a bad job with the sauce.Also what Italian place have you ever heard of that puts sun dried tomatoes on the table in oil for dipping bread?

Very tasty, but I could have gone for some dipping sauces...because...why not.When we saw this place open up, I thought Carrabba's would have competition, but now we are thinking Sullivan's will have to step their game up to keep us from going to Luciano's for a nice meal."], ["Allyson D.", "I will definitely be returning to Luciano's!

My husband had a few remarks he wanted me to add to this review so the following is from him. His entree came with olives and he asked if they could be removed because he's not a fan of olives. When his salad came, he remembered he forgot to say no olives, which it typically comes with. Knowing that he did not want olives on his entree, the cooks took the olives off of his salad as well. HUGE WIN for the kitchen. He ordered the trout special for his dinner. He was not a fan. The trout was breaded with marinara sauce on it.

The chicken portofino has everything Italian food should in my opinion, alot of well seasoned tender meat, rich creamy sauce, and a huge helping with enough for leftovers. The shrimp parmigiana isn't quite as perfect, but I still enjoyed it and like that they use really fresh jumbo shrimp. Kudos for their tomato sauce too, some places have a tendency to make theirs overly sweet, but Portofino's keeps their sauce a little tangy, just as a tomato should taste.I feel that great service can make average food subconsciously taste better, but luckily the quality of their food and service shine through in both areas. Their staff is superbly friendly and they come by frequently to check on things. They clearly want you to have a great meal, and as you can probably tell by my review, I like Portofino's quite alot.

The service was prompt and we all left saying that was some of the best food we've had before. I highly recommend this place."], ["Charity M.", "We've been regulars at this location for years. But lately, I feel that they've slacked on quality and flavor. The last few times we've eaten here, the food has been bland. Their pizza is still top notch and I love the bruschetta. However, the pasta dishes have been disappointing, with runny sauces and no seasoning. Even a little salt could've helped tonight!"]]}
