Delicious steamed fish, sting ray, every week when my parents have the chance they ask what's special to the chef and he blows us away every time.Inside, the ambiance is a nice laid back sushi bar with several big screen tv's and if you walk around to the left side there's a grill for hibachi. Everyone is friendly, and the service is pretty good. But honestly, what gets me is the food. The flavor is good, it's not too oily and they don't put too much MSG as some restaurants do.

This is a nice appetizer.I had a curry flavor from the Chef's Specialties. It was perfect. Very well cooked vegetables in the curry, made me happy. The meal was big for me after I had roti so go with the big appetite. I have to pack the left over but I know it would taste yummy next day. Any spicy food taste delicious next day.

It was pretty standard and exactly what I expected. Nothing out of the ordinary. It was filling, but we all know the problem with sushi....Give yourself 30 minutes and you're hungry again! Blast! I should have ordered more to go! Service was a little sluggish and our food was brought out in oddly spaced waves. Not a deal-breaker, but it was a little inconvenient. I can't wait to go back and try one of the chef's specialties. I love the feel of this place as it is rather open with plenty of seating. A drawback is the odd placement and parking.

We went on Saturday nigh so my review is a couple days late. We had a 45 minute wait( which was unusually short according to other people waiting) which is not bad because they text you when your seat is ready. So you can visit the shops around the restaurant. Started off with the tuna nachos and they were freakin awesome!! We had decided to try the burgushi even though the burgers and sushi looked amazing around us. I got lamburgushi and my wife got dougs filet roll. Dougs fillet was the way to go though. I got a yellow tail roll just to try some sushi and it was absolutely perfect. Great service and good food. Probably should expect a wait. It's first come first serve at the bar. Next time I'm just going to get a burger because I really wanted one after I saw a few come out."], ["C G.", "Wow.... amazing food, great atmosphere. I was shocked how fast food came even with how crowded it was on a Friday night! Had the salmon sandwich and a black bean burger. Both were fresh with amazing taste. Onion rings were good and Cole slaw fresh. Wait staff was on it and front desk people were pleasant and alert. An all around amazing visit! Will bring in visitors that come to visit me."], ["Ken K.", "2.5 stars.....Sat in the sushi bar area, at the bar. Cool touch screens built into to counter tops, except they don't work very well at all. Still pretty cool. LOTS of staff about, except they are all cleaning and not really paying attention to customers.It took a WHILE to get an order in, couldn't get my check in a timely manner, didn't get my tea refilled....this actually became pretty amusing, then frustrating. It was after traditional lunch hour. (I arrived about 1:40 pm, and the efforts of the employees present were spent on doing everything except looking after me.)Ordered the lunch special bento box w/burger, which also took a while to receive. HOWEVER, it was really, really good.So, my experience: Kitchen - \"good\" -- Service - \"Lacking\" -- Cleanliness - \"good\" as I witnessed a LOT of cleaning going on around me, and not-so-much attention to getting me in and out at lunch time.I will go back when I have lots of time for lunch, and will revise this review if I experience better service next time."], ["Matt F.", "I've been here a couple of times, and just have not been able to come away happy. Cowfish has a cool interior, as well as the wait time and higher price you would expect from a restaurant in South Park. Which is totally fine and as expected.I have them another shot after they re-opened (for the second time) after their rhinovirus scare. It made sense that their lines would be shortest, and their kitchen would be cleanest, after their recent shutdown and extended cleanup.That was correct, and no one in my party got sick. Indeed, Cowfish was about half full, and I was able to get in and seated immediately.On my last visit, I was disappointed with some of the burgerushi, but was really impressed with some of the sushi. I was determined to stick with the sushi, which was fresh and delicious.I'm not sure what my waiter's name was, but it should have been, \"10 minute minimum.\" Because every single thing took at least 10 minutes. It was at least 10 minutes until someone came to my table. Again, the restaurant was hall full. I am unsure if I have ever had someone take my dinner order after my appetizer had arrived. I am certain that has never happened after the appetizer had arrived but drinks had not. At least, before my recent visit to Cowfish. Pretty certain Chilis can manage such basics, but somehow a place that goes $50/$60 a plate cannot.I am done complaining about all the waiting I did during my 100 minute long dinner. How is the sushi?The sashimi is my favorite in Charlotte. Their sashimi is easily the freshest, juiciest, tastiest I have had in this town. Nothing like a big bowl of their fresh fish on ice, especially when it is fantastic fish.The rolls are good. I would not say better than a number of other sushi joints, but good. Inventive. A little weird (I think mine came with burger sauce or something I didn't try).I really wish they had better service, because they could potentially be better than Baku, Pisces, Yama, or a number of other sushi restaurants.

A slow day. We both had the Guru bento box. The Guru roll is great and we both enjoyed them. This bento box gives you 4 pieces of their signature roll. We both ask for a substitution on the fruit (she asked for soup and I asked for a small amount of seaweed salad) and she asked for just tuna sashimi instead of the piece \u00a0of salmon and white fish that comes with the dish. Ryan told us there would be an up charge for the changes which we agreed. Before describing the up charge, let me first tell you the food was very good. Not great except the guru roll, but very good. Now for my ax to grind. The up charge was $5 for $12.50 meals. The charge didn't result in bankruptcy but it's the principle that the changes weren't that significant and the place was lucky to have a hand full of customers for a rainy Saturday lunch. Face it, you got to make a decision what to charge based on the charge, they did and I doubt we'll go back. There are too many other options for good sushi and there was no need to stick it to the few customers you got. By the way, I didn't think it was Ryan's call on the up charge, so his tip didn't suffer, albeit on the lower side our usual 20%. He was enthusiastic and personable but didn't adequately represent sticking I was going to get."], ["Chad E.", "Hmm. Definitely one of the stranger names I've heard. Usually \"guru\" is associated with technical prowess - and rolling sushi is more of an art form than technical, but who am I to judge?The inside of the place is nice enough, and service is friendly, but not quick in any way, even when no one else is there. And when I say no one, I mean no one. I mean perhaps even a sushi chef, because a simple roll took forever to come out.Once it did arrive, it was good enough, but I don't know if it was worth waiting as long as we did. I have no problem waiting (within reason) for something worthwhile, but this was just a little insane."], ["Aleks K.", "Finally made it out for sushi in Charlotte.

I got a tempura bowl off of their lunch menu also and it was soggy and the choices in vegetables were unconventional and also there was no rice in the bowl. Everything was overpriced- especially for having a lunch menu. The waitress we had was nice to us but there were two people coming in and she said that they \"always bitch\" and the other staff were using profanities in front of customers.

One weekday, my friend and I stopped by here around 1:30pm for lunch, we were both starving because we had just gone to the gym. We stood around the front of the restaurant for about 10 minutes and nobody came to greet us or seat us. Finally some guy that was eating his lunch on the terrace part came and told us we can sit where ever we wanted. We sat down and waited and waited... We saw one of the servers chatting away (for about 20 min) with one of the customers at their table. Finally another 15 min later, a different server came out of the back and said \"sorry I will be right back with a menu\"another 5 minutes later she finally bought us menus and took our drink order. We were so hungry at this point we chose right away what we wanted to eat and ordered with the server when she bought us our waters. My friend ordered a spicy tuna roll and another roll and I had the Salmon lover and Negi hamachi roll. By the time we ordered, the restaurant was all empty leaving my friend and I with only one other table (who had already finished eating and were having a meeting)tick tock tick tock....2:30pm rolls around still no food. We could NOT understand why 4 little rolls were taking so long to make because obviously we were the only table who have not eaten yet. And the whole hour we waited, none of the servers stopped by to refill our water or to tell us why the food was taking so long. Finally around 2:45pm we got our 4 rolls. Still No apology or explanation why it took so long. The rolls tasted whatever. Definitely NOT worth waiting an hour to get our food. Stay away!! Horrible Horrible service. Will NOT be returning."], ["Tatyana C.", "Amazing, fresh, yummy sushi. I asked the waitress for the best tuna sushi and she hesitated for one second then a huge smile crept up on her face. She said it would be a surprise and that if I didn't like it I could choose another roll. Let me tell you people, this was one of the best tuna rolls I've ever had and mind you I am a sushi snob. The surprise tuna roll wasn't on the menu either! So I felt so special!! It was called the super tuna crunchy roll. The sushi was a bit expensive but i don't mind paying for quality food.

So far, everything I have tried off their menu has been great! My favorites include the Sashimi Pizza, Hamachi Hottt and quite a few of their specialty rolls. I also like their miso soup because it's not overly salty. The last time I was in, I was pregnant and couldn't eat any raw fish - they offered to make any roll of my choice with the fish fully cooked. I got the Salmon Lover Roll and loved it with the cooked salmon! I'm not the biggest fan of the sake cocktails, though I did enjoy drinking some of the flavored sakes they offer.

Much improved and now I'm hooked. Love their Fire & Ice. Lots of flavor and very filling. Go with extra broth and add an onsen egg :) Try to go early to beat the lunch and dinner rush. You usually get seated immediately if you do so or you'll wait a good 15+ mins. Seating is tight, still no hooks to hang coat or bag. Music genre is random and loud at times.Old review when they first opened:3 stars...for now. UGH. I know. I will be back... they need to work on some kinks, hopefully before their grand opening. It also doesn't help that I was already mentally comparing Futo Buta to Ippudo NYC and Momofuku. Just reading the menu reminded me of Ippudo's items. Upon entering, the place is cozy, small. I can only imagine the wait once they start picking up. Love the decor which reminded me of Momofuku's and a little bit of Toki Underground and Daikaya in D.C.. They could use some hooks underneath the bar and community table for purses, bags and jackets. I ended up pulling my purse handle up my leg to secure it. Staff is really friendly. While waiting for our food I noticed a few customers take their left over ramen to-go. WHAT?! Who does that??? Immediately my husband said, ratio is off, too much noodles, not enough broth. Once we got our ramen, I realized that was that was very true. I ordered the Niwa (vegan) and hubster ordered the Fire & Ice (salmon). For appetizers we ordered Shishito pepper and the Eggplant Buns. Here we go:* Shishito Peppers - Best thing we ordered from the menu. We enjoyed every Bite of it. Flavorful, made us want more.* Eggplant Buns - Fail. TWICE. First time, the buns came very chewy and undercooked. Second go, same but just barely undercooked. Eggplant itself was tasty.* Niwa - Could use a little more flavor. Noodle texture was perfect. You can tell they were homemade and fresh. Too much noodle, not enough broth. Plenty of veggies in there.* Fire & Ice - Salmon is smoked which gave it that earthy flavor but it was too salty and maybe a little too smoky as well. Cooked perfectly. Too much noodle, not enough broth. Fresh noodles. Overall, it was fine, underwhelming. As I mentioned earlier, a few kinks and fine tuning and this place will be great.

The taste of miso was very light. My friends had fire and ice ramen and the signature one that I can't remember the name right now. All the broths are flavorful and distinct from each other.

Having been to countless ramen places around the US and in Japan, I have to say that this is no where near authentic Japanese ramen. We've been here twice now and both times we left very unsatisfied. The first time we went we thought it was bad because they had just opened but the second time we went ( last week) it was just as bad. We've tried all the ramen on their current menu and our least favorite was Tonkotu and miso. The tonkotu soup is so bland and it really lacks depth in the flavor. The miso one was so bland at first and 2/3 of the way done, I realized that all of the miso was at the bottom ( no wonder it was so bland! The staff should inform you to mix it before eating) I mixed it up and boy did it turn salty! It was so salty I couldn't finish it. Although it was salty after I mixed it, it still lacked in the depth of flavor. It was just plain salty broth. The cha-shu is too fatty in my opinion and for the appetizer, the tori karaage is way over priced for such a small portion. The fire and ice ramen was okay in flavor but I don't think you call that ramen. Its not really ramen. I know it hasn't been too long since they opened so I am willing to try this place out one more time in the future and hopefully it will become better. One more thing, their ice cream they make is really good! First time I went I had the peach ginger and it was so good. not too sweet and perfect! Second time we went, I had the strawberry basil and my friend had the chocolate sesame chili. The strawberry one was delicious but the chocolate one was pretty bad... I love how they don't make their ice cream too sweet!!I would definitely come back just for their Ice cream =)"], ["Clara R.", "This Japanese Ramen place is pretty decent. Coming from New York where there is numerous ramen places in the city, Futo Buta was pretty good. I would recommend getting their pork belly buns.

Having been spoiled like crazy by the wonderful sushi and value at New Zealand on Monroe, and still saddened by the closing of Mai Sushi at Colony/Rea, we ventured down to Quail Corners in search of our new neighborhood spot. While the atmosphere is great, the food was not our cup of tea. We started with an order of edamame, which is difficult to mess up. But the beans were clearly not fresh - they tasted like they had been frozen too long because the texture was mealy and the pods were wimpy. Move on to the sushi order - a couple of sake (salmon nigiri) and a spicy tuna hand roll. Well, it was all.. okay. The fish was fine, but nothing special. It was all pretty much tasteless, in fact I think the sushi I've picked up from the fridge in Harris Teeter was tastier, and half the price. I mean, I would eat it if I were really desperate for sushi, but considering how close we are to SouthPark, Park Road Shopping Center, etc., and the fact that Umai's prices are pretty steep for what you get, I would definitely head in another direction the next time I crave sushi.Now let's talk noodles for a second - because my son is pretty much a ramen afficionado. He is only 12, but has been eating ramen noodles since he could eat solid foods (not the kind that come out of the wrapper). He has an amazing palate, and he certainly does know good ramen... and this was the worst he's ever tasted (according to him). The broth was just wrong (I tasted it, too), like maybe they added some miso then boiled it, which is a huge no no, or maybe the broth had been revived from the day before one too many times. I have no idea, but all I know is that we're not fans. The ramen noodles had pork as the protein, and the texture was tough and inedible. I've never seen my son leave a bowl of noodles uneaten, but despite our best efforts to salvage it with a touch of soy sauce and some sriaracha, we just had to let it go. Just for full disclosure - I did order a seafood stir fry dish carry out for my husband and he ate every last bite - but he's not really that picky and he was really hungry... The dish was $18, so it should have been way better than \"good\" in my opinion. It didn't look any better than the seafood dish we've ordered from Chi Thai (in Arboretum Harris Teeter) for years and years, and was much more expensive. Anyway - I've had better in Charlotte. If you like authentic tastes and textures of Japanese food, you are probably better to steer clear of Umai."], ["Chris Y.", "I travel down to Charlotte pretty often for work and this place is my go to for sushi!

The edamame was topped with sea salt and warm to the bite, yum! The spring roll was also great, lightly fried and not greasy, with a variety of veggies inside. So, my starters were the best part of the meal. Onto the sushi. I ordered salmon nigiri, a spicy tun hand roll and the Japanese Mafia roll. The salmon was good. Spicy Tuna, ugh! Unfortunately there were a lot of tuna veins throughout the roll and it was hot, and not hot in a good way. Oh, and to top it off I received a roll of entire rice, and not a hand roll. And, as for the Japanese Mafia, it is a cooked roll, but the fish was cook too long that it smelled and ruined the flavor of what was meant to be. I did enjoy the crab salad in the roll though, since you usually see crab sticks.Overall, everything was okay, but not a sushi spot I would run back to anytime soon."], ["Linda H.", "I've had lunch at Umai four times and each time it has been outstanding! \u00a0Not a sushi lover so thoroughly enjoy the chinese menu.

It was a pretty slim sushi roll selection, and about 8 different nigiri choices. Only about 4 fish options for nigiri.

We got the Rainbow bowl, salmon belly nigiri, spicy hamachi crispy rice roll, wagyu tartar, robata chicken livers and robata pork belly. The sushi dishes were delicious! Fresh fish and beautiful presentation. The wagyu tartar was over seasoned and was way too salty for our taste. If you have a great piece of wagyu why kill it with all that seasonings??

The music was audible but wasn't too loud that we could not hear ourselves speak. We were unaware that the menu was Japanese 'tapas' style, but our server gave us a long rehearsed speech about the menu and restaurant style. The Queen's Feast selections were described well on the menu but the portions were rather small. The spicy chili edamame was great, but edamame isn't hard to mess up. I ordered a type of maki roll with yellowtail; it came out in 4 tiny pieces. The tiger prawn & vegetable tempura consisted of 2 skinny tiger prawns, a 1/4 of a mushroom, 2 asparagus stalks and a piece of eggplant. Quite disappointing.

They should've changed out our plates at least once during dinner as our plates were drenched in oils and flavors from the other dishes.

The A5-12 Japanese Wagyu Beef Nigiri ($8/pierce) with Burgundy Truffle and Hon Shiso was another one of my favorites. I was very disappointed in the Salmon Belly Nigiris as that was what drew me into wanting to go to this restaurant. The salmon belly was fresh but the flavor was off because the chef had a big dab of mayonnaise on each piece. \u00a0The flavors did not go together and the mayonnaise took away the flavor of the fish. I feel that this was my main problem with this restaurant... the combination of flavors just did not go together. They would have fresh ingredients that are amazing even all on its own but then they would add something that overpowers the main ingredient. Another example was the yellowtail sashimi ($12 for 3 pieces)... the yellowtail was great, the truffle ponzu sauce was great but then they added this overpowering pickled smoky onion in it which in my opinion, totally ruined the dish and seems like such a waste of good quality fish. They could've added some onions but not so much where it was more than the fish itself. Another example was the Foiegras and Scallop dish ($28 for 2)... foiegras.. perfectly cooked, flavor was great... scallop... perfectly cooked, flavor was on point... and then they add this mint leaf that tasted like licorice in the middle which totally caught me by surprise and added this overpowering, pungent flavor that had a bitter aftertaste.

My BF got the tempura tiger prawns, beef & asparagus skewers, & soft shell crab maki roll.The shishito peppers came out first. They were tasty & not really spicy. They came with a little dipping sauce made of soy sauce & chili flakes. $7 was a little steep for a plate of peppers but I enjoyed them & would get them again.The tempura tiger prawns came out next.. $12 for 5 pieces of fried shrimp.. what?? I kind of laughed when the prawns came out because at that price we were expecting at least ONE more to make it an even $2 per prawn. I did not eat them & while my BF seemed to like the prawns, he said they weren't really anything special.Next up was the wild mushroom kamameshi pot. It came to the table unstirred, but I was unable to get a picture of it at the time because our server stirred it while explaining the dish. I enjoyed the flavors but again felt it was overpriced at $17 for some rice, mushrooms, & a few vegetables. The nice touch was that the rice on the bottom was a little crispy from the hot pot.. love it!My BF got his beef & asparagus skewers (I think it came with 2) & soft shell crab roll. The skewers looked much better in person than that shitty picture I posted (blame the BF for that!) I think he liked the skewers & the roll was comparable to Cowfish prices but definitely not in size.. Cowfish wins that hands down! I don't remember the exact prices of these 2 dishes individually, but together they must have been around $25 based on our bill.Overall, the service was great, sake was awesome, & the food, while good, was definitely overpriced. We weren't particularly blown away by any of the dishes which is kinda disappointing for a meal close to $100 (including the tip). We will probably be back because my BF wants to try the duck & a couple of other grilled meat dishes, but Baku will likely not be in our regular rotation."], ["Travis W.", "Wow, thought I had already reviewed this place but apparently not. \u00a0Well for starters you have to love the interiors. \u00a0As stated in some of the other reviews, the upstairs area is preferred if you are looking to lounge. \u00a0I loved the ambiance of the place. \u00a0We came on their first official night open so there were some kinks in the armor, mostly relative to bar menu and drink selection but the service was friendly and prompt none the less.The food was fantastic, the pork belly melts in your mouth and the shrimp tempura was divine. \u00a0The peppers we had were incredible and although considered a small plate, I found the portions to be fairly large enough for two."], ["Michael W.", "As good as it gets for Japanese in Charlotte! Went here on a whim with a friend and it didn't disappoint. The rolls were very well made and the presentation was excellent. The Alaskan crab roll was one of my favorites. The food is mostly tapas style meant to share... and most of the small plate portions are a little small. Everything grilled is cooked on a Japanese grill with coals imported from Japan which gives it a very unique flavor. Their black cod was excellent... I'm gonna say it reminded me of Nobu's... though the execution was a little off. All their beef is prime, we also had the Waygu NY strip and it was delicious. Cocktails were ok, nothing out of this world and the service was decent. Overall I think they did a good job, albeit the NY city prices... this is a place good for an expense account."], ["Matthew J.", "Me and my wife really enjoy this restaurant! They are always on top of everything when it comes to service. The sushi is very fresh and tasty.

We sat upstairs across the room from a table of 8 men and it was very loud! We ordered the lobster/avocado roll and a dirty martini which were both excellent. As for the three course meal, I chose the spicy blue fin tuna rolls, the tempura prawns and veggies and the mango pineapple cake for dessert. I would get something other than the tempura if I had to do it again only because the veggies were a little greasy. The salmon course looked really good as an alternative. Overall, the experience was a good one.

My husband got a gin & cucumber concoction which he thought was kind of like lemonade. I got a wild tea vodka & cucumber drink. It was a little sweeter than I prefer but glad I tried it!Now to the menu . . . our waitress, Morgan, was very thorough in explaining the style of the restaurant. She suggested an item from each page, but that seemed like a lot. But I guess in the end we probably ordered that much! We started with the calamari which was delicious! Lightly crispy and delicate! We decided on two sushi rolls. Spicy tuna - yum! - and Forbidden Rice roll which had white asparagus. It was unique and tasty! For our next round, I asked about the baby artichoke skewers which Morgan highly recommended, as well as the rice bowls. My husband wasn't up for either, so we focused on entrees. We ordered Grilled Branzini b/c we'd never had it. It was 2 small slices of grilled fish (not much flavor!!) and a tomato salad. Very small portion and disappointing flavor for $24!! Since our waitress asked about it, my husband told her it was just ok and didn't have a lot of flavor. When she brought the bill, she informed us she took the Branzini off the tab! We greatly appreciated that!All in all, it was good but not a great experience and not worth the $65 (total without the entree).

The Paul's roll was very creamy with fresh tuna, cream cheese and avocado. There was NO crunch at all in it, which is OK. But the Bagel Roll was unusual in that there was NO bread or \"bagel\" component to it at all. I believe the roll was oh so lightly breaded then flash fried to give it the TEXTURE of a crispy bagel.

I ordered a miso soup, house salad, Firecracker Roll, and a Volcano Roll. \u00a0Below are my thoughts on each.Miso Soup: \u00a0Watery. \u00a0Very little flavor with mini tofu pieces.House salad: \u00a0Dressing was good, but the lettuce was brown and tomatoes were not yet ripe.Volcano Roll: \u00a0Menu said it had lava sauce on top. \u00a0i guess my image of lava sauce is a deep red chili paste sauce. \u00a0Their version was some type of congealed slop with a sweet (rather than spicy) taste with waaaayyyy to much tossed on top of the roll. \u00a0Gross.Firecracker Roll: \u00a0The best of the night. \u00a0The sauce was redder and thinner than what was on the volcano roll and was more in line with what I would think of as lava sauce. \u00a0Still, the tempura breading was pretty thick and was too overpowering for the tuna. Finally, service was friendly, but I sat at the sushi bar. \u00a0There were no chairs at the center of the bar with a wooden panel that could easily hold the sushi going out. \u00a0However, this held the stand to put the tickets on when servers picked them up. \u00a0The sushi was placed directly in front of the patrons sitting at the bar, so I spent most of the night with servers hanging over me either waiting for the orders, or picking up the orders...directly in front of me."], ["Fleece P.", "I was very satisfied and impressed with this sushi.

Don't get me wrong- I appreciate that they take sanitation seriously! But ever since then, I have enjoyed my rolls and sashimi consistently, but the smell kills it for me and just doesn't put it at the top of my regular rotation.

The sushi isn't bad by any means but not memorable - nothing that blows me away. At Ru Sans I covet the Firecracker roll. At Sushi 101, I always snag the Sir Justin roll.

Pretty average sushi here with no special sauces, ingredients or anything that makes me crave this eatery.However, props to the bistro for the atmosphere. It's a sleek, modern design with plenty of room between the booths and tables so you're not invading anyone's personal space.

They have Vietnamese, Thai and Sushi. I just don't expect a restaurant with a broad menu to have amazing \"omg, I have to live here\" food (which is my normal reaction to a restaurant I love :P), but Akahana is decent. It's a good place to go when you're indecisive or if you have a large crowd with different tastes.I've tried all three cuisines here and the Vietnamese dishes are my favorite.Reviews for all three cuisines:The Vietnamese dishes are very affordable. I believe all dishes are $10 and under. The pho is pretty good, but it varies. From experience, it is really good on Wednesdays lol I'm not really sure why. The Pork Chop Rice Platter is my go-to plate since it has never let me down! It comes with grilled pork chop, an egg, rice and vegetables. Very delicious and filling! I would also recommend the \"Vietnamese Shaking Beef (Bo Luc Lac)\" and \"Seafood Crispy Egg Noodle (Mi Xao Don)\" I think most people will be overwhelmed by the Seafood Crispy Egg Noodle. It is a stir fry over a bed of fried noodles. It is HUGE and looks like a bird's nest lol The Thai dishes are also affordable, about $10 and under as well. I've only tried the Pad Thai and I wouldn't really recommend it. The flavor is decent, but the noodles are never done correctly. They fall apart with every bite.SUSHI! The sushi rolls are generally more expensive than other places (prices comparable to Cowfish, but not as yummy). Though the sushi is BOGO so it's decent. My favorite is the Spiral Ecstasy Roll! It comes with three different types of fish and avocado! :D The Tropical Exotic Roll is interesting. It's a sushi dish but it comes in triangles.

In fact I didn't even see the sushi guys in front of us making them, so I'm not sure where they came from.As many have mentioned, this is not a cheap place to eat. However, I do give them credit. The nigiri pieces were fresh, of good size and not too much rice. I was told that they always have toro & uni, which are rare in Charlotte.

It's not a bad thing, just a thing. When it comes to other items (hibachi, etc), the dishes are also good, but nothing earth-shattering. Again, it's like more time is spent on the appearance than anything else.Now there isn't anything wrong with a lounge being a lounge, but a lounge being a restaurant? To borrow - and paraphrase - from Jerry Seinfeld, there isn't anything wrong with that, but it lends airs that just make it seem a bit indifferent.

Both were good and fresh. But both were also missing that Wow factor....that je ne sais quois.Now the bartender was awesome, and his drinks rocked!

I love the chili oil kick of this one.Kissy (mango, crab, cream cheese in soy paper, re-wrapped with basil and rice paper) There is just something so clean and delicious about this roll.XoXo (crab, avocado, topped with baked scallop and a honey mayo eel sauce) The topping just takes this roll to a new level.I'm also a big of the Tuna Bruschetta for starters and Tempura Oreo with green tea ice cream for the grand finale.

Although I like it, it's not my favorite food on the planet, (that would be my wife, she could eat sushi every day for life) but sushi 101 is incredible. I've never had a bad experience here. The sushi is DELICIOUS and I'd say it's fairly priced as far as sushi goes. On our last trip I ordered the Super Crunch Roll- one of my faves and one of my \"usuals\" and the Ballantyne roll. I expected the SCR to be great, and it was, but that Ballantyne was to die for. It has crunchy salmon skin on the inside of the roll and raw salmon on top. (Ugh, wish I'd gotten a pic of it) it was absolutely delicious and it might become a new favorite of mine. We went with a large group of friends and everyone enjoyed their meals and the service was pleasant and fast. Oh, the edamame as an appetizer is a MUST! It comes out warm and flavorful and we couldn't stop eating it. My father in law ordered the chicken fried rice (I don't think he's a sushi fan lol) and they brought him this massiveeeee plate out of the most delicious rice ever, he was in heaven!

They have great noodle bowls(ramen yaki style with veggies is my favorite), good vegetable fried rice and their jasmine roll wrapped in cucumber instead of rice is pretty yummy too! Good miso soup, and if you need a sweet the mochi (flavored icecream wrapped in gummy rice) is sooo good! I love this little place for a quick bite, a late bite to eat or even take out!

The staple app tossed in a delicious sauce. One order may not be enough for your table.Spring rolls: These were tasty, but they were all different shapes and sizes. Nothing wrong with that... just threw us all off when they arrived.Crispy Maki 101 Roll: Tuna or salmon rolled in nori and lightly fried. Topped with a mayo and chili sauce. I usually get this every time. I like that it's not too heavy for a fried roll.Professor Vu Roll: Shrimp tempura and cream cheese topped with avocado, tuna and crab salad. Everything is better with crab salad on top.Sushi 101 has some great drink specials throughout the week, but note there are no specials on Fridays and Saturdays.

So when we order fried rice, they didn't turn up their nose or anything.Now I get that it probably isn't their speciality - it's not like we were eating at Fried Rice 101 or anything - so it wasn't spectacular, but it was perfectly serviceable, so when we're in the mood for sushi, we'll give it a shot."], ["Heather A.", "For the price this sushi cannot be beat.

It was a very casual place with a come as you are vibe. \u00a0The server was very friendly and made a point to check on us without being bothersome. I was able to ask questions and she was knowledgeable with her answers. I ordered 2 sushi rolls, salad, and miso soup for myself. My only complaint was the salad was too large and the dressing tasted like there was a touch of mustard. I would probably not order that again. The sushi tasted very fresh and was some of the best I've tried in Charlotte. My daughter ordered miso soup and nothing green and fried rice with only egg. There was no problem with her special request and the food came out exactly as she asked.I wanted to try sushi tonight, but they have different versions of noodles on the menu. One is served in a broth as a soup. For this, you are able to choose your type of noodle and the protein. I would like to come back soon to try this. Perhaps this weekend."], ["Crazy N.", "This is one of those places I would recommend all the sushi lovers to check out.

I stopped in a little after 1:30, I wanted to make sure I missed the heavy lunch crowd. Lucky for me the place was pretty empty. I scored a seat right in from by the window and was presented a menu. The menu is pretty extensive so that was very impressive. And they have a pretty good wine list and daily drink specials...whoo hoo!In an effort to \"try something new\" I got the Crispy California Roll which comes topped with napoli sauce. Think delicious california roll...deep fried...classic flavors a little bit of crunch...I really don't know what to say...other than it was just okay. I really did enjoyed the napoli sauce ! But everything else was just pretty basic. Nothing really stood out to me, I mean don't get me wrong, it was not bad by any means. It just didn't WOW me. However, service was good.

We were very impressed!First and most importantly, the fish and all of the other items inside the rolls were very fresh. We ordered 4 of the special rolls and loved them all, especially the volcano roll - so tasty! Be aware, though - some of these rolls are HUGE! Took a few tries to fit it all in my mouth! The miso soup was, well, miso soup (can't really go wrong here, let's face it we are eating seaweed and tofu). The Crunchy Roll was also delicious, as well as the Panthers Roll. The sauces that were put on them made the roll, gave it a little kick. Prices were what you would expect - anywhere from $5 to $9 for the specialty rolls and $4 maki rolls.

I saw this place on Yelp and went down to check it out. It's a small place with only two stools for seating, so you'll definitely want to get it to go or have it delivered. The selection of rolls is pretty standard, but varied enough for my tastes. The maki rolls are about 4 bucks, and their \"special\" rolls are about twice that. Maki rolls are pretty much the size you would expect. We picked up a few of those, along with a special roll -Rainbow- that was nice and plump.The quality was pretty good. The fish tasted fresh and the sauces were tasty. I thought the rice was very slightly undercooked because it was a little looser than expected, but that's really a very minor issue that will probably vary from day to day. Overall, I'm pretty happy with it. It's great to have a take-out sushi place downtown. I'm sure I will be going back there many times."], ["Bela M.", "I love this place!! After moving to Charlotte, KO quickly became my favorite delivery place. It is so convenient and fast! The sushi is always fresh (lovee the Rainbow Roll) and they even have specials!

The best part is that you can order online and by the time you get home from a hard day's work, they are already at your door.

Heh heh I haven't been compelled to write a review in a VERY long time....so either this is good or bad....unless you spaced and didn't notice the actual reading, I won't spoil it for ya. Also, I don't feel it is really needed to caveat this, but just to put this review in perspective - I am half Japanese, born and raised in Japan....so I kinda know a little bit of what to expect...just a little. \u00a0;)I popped in on a Tuesday night, around 7:00 pm, nice decor, seemed to be busy for a mid week night with friendly service folks. I elected to sit at the sushi bar and found myself to be the only customer at the bar. As I walked up to he bar, I looked at the fish in the cooler and immediately wanted to leave. The color of the various fish was off(as in obviously NOT fresh) but alas, blame the wife...I was determined to find some decent home country fare. I immediately noticed how unfriendly the sushi \"chef\" was. No real greeting and I sat in silence until a waitress arrived several minutes later. Ordered a Sapporo draft beer and started looking at my \"wish list\" of sashimi and sushi. I checked off the seven piece sushi dinner that also comes with a California roll($18) and also added a four piece sashimi of yellowtail(for $10) and a four piece sashimi of white tuna/escolar(for $8) and handed my sheet to the \"chef\". As I contemplated what hashtags to use when I undoubtedly take a pic of my dinner for Instagram and sipped my beer, my dinner was presented forth to me several minutes later (which I initially appreciated the quick turnaround) and I was again IMMEDIATELY disappointed and realized there would be no Instagramming after all. :( The dinner came on two plates, sushi on one and sashimi on the other. What struck me so quickly was how THIN the sashimi was cut! When I mean thin, I mean thin enough to see THROUGH the slice! Seriously, wtf??? I was OFFENDED. This \"chef\" is blatantly trying to rip people off. The whole point of sashimi is to enjoy the flavor of the fish without rice...how in the hell can I taste any fish when it is like 3mm thick??? Not to mention, the slices were sitting in little pools of water, which means these \"cuts\" of fish had been frozen for too long. Seriously. What. The. Frick. smhThe sushi platter was no better. Sloppy California roll(I freaking hate it when they include the ends of the roll!!) in some weird, rounded triangle shape that barely held together. \u00a0The sushi themselves had thicker cuts of fish and was presented better, but again, I was struck by the color of the fish. It came with a tuna, shrimp, salmon, eel, squid(I think...it was weirdly soft and not \"crisp\" as fresh squid would be and I couldn't tell by the taste either), seabass and one more I can't even remember. The tuna had a dull, magenta color(indicates it is old) and had no taste. Neither did the salmon or any of the other pieces have any taste, for that matter. \u00a0The shrimp was very dry and the other pieces lacked any.....texture. If you have enough experience with sushi and sashimi, you will know what I mean by \"texture\". Horrible, irresponsible old cuts of fish. None of the fish had any taste and these cuts, when fresh, have a VERY distinct differentiating flavor between them, but not tonight. Not here. The four cucumber pieces had the most flavor out of the entire meal....at least they were \"fresh\". Some of you may find this review overly harsh, but I write this specifically to share what to look for for those that do not know any better. It PISSES me off to NO END when individuals run a \"Japanese\" restaurant that is wholly not representative of my culture or the quality expected. I am a proud half-Japanese man and I take offense to those that misappropriate my country's culinary culture to just rip people off who are unsuspecting or those that do not have the experience to know any better. As for any other food offered at this establishment, I cannot comment on. However, if you are contemplating sushi and/or sashimi, take your hard earned money to an establishment that strives to do better for you and offer you a genuine Japanese culinary experience.....neither of which this restaurant is succeeding at."], ["Ben S.", "I've been to a good number of these places because they are pretty popular for group dinners in conjunction with meetings and training classes. \u00a0Of the ones I've tried, this place ranks in the bottom third mainly because the staff was pretty unenthusiastic (except the bartender), the performance aspects were lacking and the food was uninspired. \u00a0It doesn't help that our chef was something of a slob and didn't try very hard to do a good job with our meals. \u00a0Sauces were strewn across the table. \u00a0A co-worker who is allergic to shellfish had the shrimp appetizer deposited on his plate anyway. \u00a0Another co-worker who ordered a combo was given the wrong food. \u00a0One of my scallops was accidentally thrown into the mayo-based dipping sauce due to how the chef was slinging hash. \u00a0The grill cleaning portion resulted in a significant amount of scrapings leaving the cooking surface and landing on the table surface. \u00a0Etc, etc, etc."], ["Mike K.", "I had plans to meet a friend for dinner and this is the restaurant that he picked. Despite living in the University area for almost 5 years now, I had never been to Nakato. Nakato offers Teppsn Yaki (hibachi) and Sushi. My friend and I were both in the mood for sushi so we did not sit at a hibachi table. The sushi/non-hibachi section is a decent size. It has a full bar with seating and then probably about 6 table/booths with seating for 4 at each. Obviously hibachi is this restaurants main selling point which is always a cause for concern when you order the sushi whether or not it will be any good. I've been to other hibachi places that also offer sushi but it seems more like an after thought and isn't that great. However the items we ordered from the sushi menu were great! Off the sushi appetizer menu I got the Hawaiian poke salad with tuna and the tuna carpaccio. I visited Hawaii last May and fell in love with poke. While it is definitely better in Hawaii this salad had a a good flavor. The tuna carpaccio was also delicious. \u00a0I also ordered a sushi roll. The rolls here aren't that special or creative - again I think it has to do with the fact that hibachi is its main attraction and the sushi is more of a secondary menu item. My friend ordered \u00a0the sashimi Omakase and the sea urchin. He was excited that they actually had the sea urchin. He told me other restaurants that list it on their menus often tell him they do not have it in stock.The parking lot is a little strange, especially if you get brought in the back. The outside decor is pretty stark and bare for the most part. You might drive right past it. The inside is very nice and clean. While the sushi was nothing special it was fresh and delicious.

They do not seat you until your entire party is here, but sink into one of their leather couches in front. You will not want to get up.Our party of 16 or so sat at 2 grill tables, circled around. I knew off the bat I didn't want teppanyaki, so I asked for a sushi menu. I started with the hawaiian poke salad (mix of salmon and tuna) and then two rolls. The 49'er roll (ode to the SF Niners) which was a CA roll with smoked salmon, spicy aoili (fancy word of spicy mayo) and scallions. I also went with another typical favorite roll of mine, the Rock N Roll, a crunchy roll with spicy tuna and smelt roe on top. Everyone was served salads and soup, and I also had a nice bottle of hot sake. Although I prefer cold sake, this one hit the spot. Service was great, but when the show began, we were definitley at the dull table. The other cook put on a fun and exciting show, doing tricks and everything you would normally see. Ours was...the quite opposite. When I asked him where our fun show was, he did a volcano thing with the onion, and THE END. The hawaiian poke salad was okay, too much sauce that was overwhelming. The rolls on the other hand were delicious! I was surprised at the freshness of the fish, and I liked how they didnt clump so much rice on the rolls. And surprisingly I was still hungry! Usually I can barely eat two rolls, but I was still wanting more! I decided to order another, the Spicy Snow, salmon, cucumber, and jalapeno. My coworker and I also shared an order of 4 pieces of fatty tuna. That was amazing, but for $32, the slices were awfully thin. Everyone seemed to enjoy their teppanyaki, and the noodles were good too. They do seem to cook their steak very well, so tell them your liking if you prefer it more raw.My roll took forever, and people were wrapping up so I asked for it to go. It was delicious but the jalapenos were HOT! After one burning my lip, I had to take them all off.We had two birthdays and I asked them for their options. Ice cream is free, but a birthday cake, song, and photo was $10. We opted for the latter, and the birthday gals enjoyed their treat. The cake looks almost home made, but maybe store bought. Its a good size for about 6-8 people, and it was really light and delicious! Overall, a great experience! Would come back again for the sushi! Service was great in the beginning but as more and more diners came in, it seemed harder to get a hold of the waitresses. I do appreciate them turning on the channel for the A's/Tigers game for my avid A's fan coworker."], ["Jacqueline A.", "This is our fourth visit to Nakato's and this time we were mostly pleased with our meal. Previous visits have been hit and miss. This visit was more \"hit\" than miss.For appetizers, we started with miso soup and baked scallops. To not be jumbo scallops, they were quite pricey, but the flavor was good. We got 3 scallops for $4 a piece. That was a bit high. Next, we had the Gyoza. The Gyoza could either be pan fried or deep fried. The waiter didn't ask which my husband wanted and they just brought deep fried which he thought were \"ok\". We ordered the baked mussels which were good, but my husband didn't care much for the mayo topping. Next, they brought our sashimi plate and a spider roll. The mackerel, eel, hamichi and salmon were fresh and we were quite pleased. The sashimi was the highlight of the evening. However, the spider roll was smaller than we expected. The size was not what we had in the past.Lastly, I ordered a small shrimp hibachi plate with vegetables and garlic noodles. The vegetables were lukewarm and it was as though the plate sat for awhile before it was brought to the table. I probably will not order that dish again.We like Nakato's. It's a good spot to go to when you want some good sushi in the University Area. The sashimi is fresh and the presentation is somewhat artistic. Some menu items are just \"ok\" and others are a bit pricey for the amount that you do get."], ["Shannon K.", "Food was great! \u00a0Service excellent only bad part was our chef was so boring, didn't talk nothing! \u00a0You pay for entertainment too not just the food! First time there I would go back but ask for an entertaining chef"], ["Christina W.", "Food was delish. \u00a0We had the seafood combo which included salmon scallops and Shrimp and the Filet Mignon and Shrimp. \u00a0All dishes come with soup, salad, shrimp appetizer noodles and rice. \u00a0Great food at economical prices. Will definitely be back."], ["Kia L.", "Love this place. The food is always delicious. And you won't be leaving hungry. With entrees you get onion soup, ginger salad, white or fried rice, mixed veggies, and noodles. I always substitute the salad for an extra soup which they have no issue with. I love that. We always end up here on someone's birthday, and when you tell them they song in English and Japanese and you get a cake and a photo! Anyway...go here if you're looking for a good hibachi place!"], ["Tiajuana T.", "Went here today for lunch. Only tried the sushi bar this time, sushi was amazing. \u00a0The onion soup was good too. \u00a0The waiters were nice and attentive but not to the point of being annoying. \u00a0From the sounds coming from the other side the chefs were great. \u00a0Will definitely bring my kids back to try it. Gave 4 stars instead if 5 because the frozen drink that I got was weak."], ["Joan H.", "Never again! \u00a0 \u00a0We had a party of 9 and we had to wait for all to arrive. \u00a0 Our reservation was 6:30, by 7:30 we were told we had to wait another 30 minutes because there was only one chef. \u00a0 Really! \u00a0 Ending up leaving and going to TGIF.Sorry I won't recommend."], ["Leesa D.", "Oh, no!! \u00a0Maybe I'm spoiled but what is a crab stick?? \u00a0There is no hamachi Kama sushi, only grilled. Does that make sense? \u00a0The food doesn't have any flavor. The sushi guy has major attitude. The sushi is not worth your time. How do you screw up shrimp tempura appetizer? \u00a0I know.. Don't cook the vegetables long enough so you're biting into hard vegetables. And the shrimp you can get as Costco for cheaper. This is a pass!!"], ["Louis M.", "We sort of liked parts of Nakato, but thought the overall picture didn't really add up.The sushi was good, but was served very late in the meal, despite being ordered first thing. One of the pieces I received was totally different from what I ordered. When the waiter fessed up, I was still charged for it. That is the type of restaurant this is.The show was not among the best I have seen, and the chef looked like he was not really interested in the performance. The food was VERY salty, with everything getting a healthy dose of soy sauce. The portions are quite large. \u00a0The soup was watery, and did not have the obligatory fried onions, the salad was typical ginger dressing, but not sweet at all. Our meal was quite expensive, well over $100 for the 3 of us, not including tip. \u00a0Ultimately, we feel this restaurant is yet another lame ripoff of Benihana, which is better, but no longer among the best of these restaurants either in my opinion.We would not go again, having experienced far better. However in the current climate in Charlotte, this restaurant will probably be around forever."], ["Pete C.", "Nakato is wonderful. We went here for my wife's birthday and it coming from South Charlotte it was well worth the drive. The entrance has high ceilings and an overall great atmosphere. Had the hibachi and it was dinner and a show as the chef was very good at making a delicious dinner but he was very funny as well. The portions were good, the fried rice was great, and my standard steak and shrimp was all I could ask for.We had a great time and we will be back."], ["Selene R.", "Very Good food, but... Maybe making it for so many people at the same time doesn't let the food cook throughly, still very delicious and fun place."], ["Chris O.", "Tremendous! First time here, the restaurant itself has a nice open feel to it when you walk in, we sat at the sushi bar. The staff were all very friendly and attentive, the ginger dressing on the salad was different than any other place I've been (in a good way), miso soup was good... sushi was awesome! Next time I'll have to try some of the specialty rolls, they looked GOOOOD.Prices are fair, it's not the cheapest sushi around but the quality is there which is more important (to me) than price. I'll be back for more.... :-)"], ["Aishah S.", "WE went for sushi, and sat at the sushi bar on a Saturday night. \u00a0The sushi list was long, but kind of repetitive, and a lot of the rolls had the same ingredients. \u00a0The rolls we did get were fresh and were made quickly. \u00a0To supplement the lack of rolls with various ingredients, I ordered nigiri. \u00a0Honestly, this is hands down the best sushi place in the University area. \u00a0Kabuto doesn't seem as fresh and any other place is whack. \u00a0Ru Sans will forever wear the sushi crown in Charlotte!"], ["Jessie W.", "Just went for sushi. Superman roll was good. Overall I would prefer Pisces or Ru Sans, but this place was nearby and it did the job. Service was also good although it wasn't busy at the time."], ["J T.", "From out of town and this was my first visit and I enjoyed the food. We had a fun cook which was also nice."], ["Aaron F.", "Excellent food! We enjoyed that they are one of the hibachi places that actually uses the ginger sauce on the side to dip with. The early bird special they currently run at $13 for a chicken and steak combo is an amazing deal too. They also serve noodle as well as the normal fried rice."], ["Sheena G.", "I got take out. The sushi was edible but by the smell of it when I first took it out of the box, it was not as fresh as I would like. There is not much of a raw roll selection.I am used to more creativity in rolls and this place was lacking. I'm new to the area and this is the second place I've tried for sushi so far.It's in 2nd place out of two. And it's pricey!"], ["Bruce K.", "Lets just say... This place knows how to cut costs! I know that the economy has been hard on everyone, but whoa. I commend this restaurant for taking actions to minimize the amount they spend. This nice restaurant I believe sunk $5 million dollars on the property. Now, I'm going to update my review from my 2011 review. And the outcome, as you can tell by the stars is ummm... not good.Now, lets start off by the menu. I came with a party of 5 and we all got seated down at the hibachi grill. Menu is pretty standard as far as hibachi grill food items goes. I came to Nakato because from word, the owner owns a farm out in Colorado and farm raises all the animals and also their freezer blast freezes their seafood. This is an important fact because when you blast freeze seafood, it's usually 50 or more below 0 degrees Fahrenheit keeping the seafood fresh and bacteria free. So, this was definitely a reason to try this restaurant out.So, lets get back to the menu. Looking at the items something pops out. Fried Rice..$1.75. So, fried rice doesn't come standard with the meal that costs $15+? Steam rice on the other hand is free (which I picked). I ordered the combination of Chicken and NY strip. My party all got the fried rice when it was asked because they were under the assumption that it came with the meal, and I'll break down to you what that fried rice consisted of.Fried rice: Eggs, Sesame seed, and Soy Sauce. That's it. No green onions, carrots, and all that other good stuff. On top of the lack of extras with the fried rice it had no taste. Bland.Meats that I ordered weren't bad on the other hand, but the portions were a little too small in my opinion. Their noodles that also came with the meal wasn't filling, and just left me a feeling of not full but at the same time not hungry. And mind, I ate two of my party's portion on noodles.We also had some tempura. The tempura, I had no taste for it. I've definitely had better. The batter had no taste, as well as the sauce. The veggies that was served in the batter surprised my mother, which found out it was just a whole half of an onion dipped and fried in the tempura. She also wanted to tell me that what made it worse was that the onion had no flavor, the batter, and on top of all that the sauce!Finally lets get on with the end when we pay our bills.Sitting with us at our grill was another party of 5, 3 kids and 2 adults. One of the child's birthday happened to be that day. So, you usually get a dessert, or a cupcake, or some ice cream right? Not here! This lucky girl got a nice candle, in a sauce dish. Well, they did sing the birthday song to her.But wait! That's not it! The table sitting directly across from us also had a birthday. So, they take the candle the little girl just blew out and lights it again to give it to the other birthday person. Mind, these meals cost I believe $15+. Easily.Way to cheap out your customers there, Nakato. Charge extra for fried rice that's bland, and some pretty expensive dishes, with no complimentary birthday dessert. Now, that's how you run a business: Cutting costs, and try to recuperate losses."], ["Donald R.", "Me and wife love this place. It is our favorite Sushi place. Love the atmoshere, the decore, the staff, the hot towels, and of course the food. They have a beverage and a sushi bar. This is also a Japenese Steak House, but we mostly come here for the sushi. They have 16 Teppanyaki Tables in the main dinning room and 4 more tables in private roomd that you do not need a reservation for, but you have to take your shoes off and sit on the floor."], ["John M.", "In the style of Beni Hana but a little \"up scale\". The seating and service was prompt and courteous. The food ( steak and scallops) was totally delish. \u00a0In a departure from similar restaurants, noodles instead of bean sprouts were served with the vegetables. Next time I visit Charlotte (from the left coast) this place will definitely be on the itinerary!"], ["Jon C.", "I'd give this a 3.5 only due to lack of rolls. Sushi (nigiri) was great,but I like some crazy rolls on the menu. \u00a0Had one that was good but not a huge selection. \u00a0I'll be back.. It's close to the hotels so easy walk."], ["Joe S.", "Very pretty restaurant. \u00a0By far the nicest ambiance Japanese steak house in the clt area. \u00a0Food was quite good also. \u00a0Service was excellent. \u00a0Sushi menu was quite varied for a steak house. \u00a0Overall and excellent experience."], ["M.dayanara F.", "Yumm!! Don't forget Sushi!"], ["Khemary S.", "This place used to be good. Keyword used to be! \u00a0The fried rice was over done by garlic and if you love garlic you would understand why I didn't like it cause I love garlic. It was absolutely too much. Nothing else complimented it. Short ribs were horrible we didn't eat it and still was charged for it even though we told our server it wasn't good. Service was fine... But I think their hibachi isn't worth the money. The chefs can hardly entertain!!! \u00a0Anyways. Good luck on you're trip."], ["Stephanie T.", "I brought a co-worker here for a business dinner while in town and thought it was great. We had some downtime when we first sat to talk about work and then enjoyed a great, reasonably priced, hibachi. Portions were abundant."], ["Terri W.", "I have to say overall I am not very exited about this place. The ambient is not so bad, \u00a0a lot of tables and the waitress was cute. ... About the Shusi... ;) Got Vulcano, Tuna and Superman roll. The Miso Soup was hot but the taste only average. You could get the Kirin beer only as draft when you don't want to drink the 12 oz bottle. I am not why draft beer has a frozen foam...The rolls were as well nothing exiting average again someone said something about pricing and it is right 38$ is not ever age... Would I go again!? I might but will look for different places as well..."], ["Lauryn C.", "On my way to a movie in Concord and I was craving some sushi....I thought of Nakato I had been once before for lunch and remember it being pretty good. \u00a0I've never eaten the hibachi - but they have a decent sushi bar, prices are a little high, and they lack on selection when it comes to rolls. \u00a0I really enjoyed my miso soup, and tuna tataki though. \u00a0If i'm in the area I'd come back but I wouldn't drive out of my way."], ["John S.", "If you want a little entertainment mixed with your meal, this is a good place to go. \u00a0This is a teppanyaki place, meaning they cook your food on a big cooktop right in front of you. \u00a0Think Benni Hanna if you're familiar with that chain.The food is good and the service is usually pretty good too. \u00a0The one down side here, as far as service goes, is they don't start cooking until they fill up the cooking area, which if you go with a small party might add a few minutes or more to your way. \u00a0At least that was the case the times I have been. \u00a0The regular order I have is chicken, which comes with a clear broth soup, white rice and veggies. \u00a0The soup comes from the kitchen first, but everything else is cooked right in front of you. \u00a0They also serve several sauces, which are tasty combined, by the way. \u00a0You can get the same thing with steak or shrimp instead of chicken. \u00a0For dinner the same meal also comes with a few grilled shrimp regardless of what meat you order. \u00a0They serve it as sort of an appetizer for all dinners I think.Overall, it's a good place for some light entertainment with your meal."], ["Marie A.", "Good average Japanese steakhouse for hibachi but this isn't Benihana...at all.I went to this location after seeing all of the reviews on yelp, which were mostly positive but I saw a few things wrong.The hosted greeted me and my date immediately, and got us seated quickly since it was a Monday night and virtually empty except for the hibachi area, which was what I came for.Seating is wierd here, they had half empty hibachi tables but insisted on putting me and my date at an empty table. Part of the hibachi experience is the show, which is usually better when their are more than two people at a table of eight!!! People trailed in the door but only a group of three were sat at our table and at the other end...what?The food made up the bad seating, I had the Nakato Delight, and chose the NY strip instead of the filet. It was great....steak was cooked perfectly, shrimp not overdone and the chicken was tasty. The hibachi chef was in good spirits, although he gave up on the entertainment portion of his job since the group of three across from us were ignoring him and kept talking amongst themselves.This Nakato has a nice albeit dated interior, but much better than the run down Kabuto on Pineville Matthews. The prices were in line with most hibachi places, 18 for chicken and around 22+ for combos. And you will have leftovers for sure!"], ["Mary M.", "love it here! esp the early bird special chicken and steak if you are there before 6pm!"], ["Rebekah P.", "For those of you who have been to Nakato before you know that it is separated into two rooms, the sushi bar and the grill room where the chefs cook the food for you. \u00a0My experience here has only been in the sushi bar, and it was a pretty good one. \u00a0The sushi itself was very good, fresh and really big. \u00a0It was a mouthful to eat a whole piece. \u00a0Plus I'm beginning to think it's kind of hard to mess up spider rolls, but then again I may just be spoiled. \u00a0Then there was the udon soup. \u00a0It was really good, but not any better or worse than other udon I've had. \u00a0I was kind of impresses that they had one of my friend's favorite foods, inari, that came with the soup."], ["Sam S.", "This place is GREAT! I can't wait to go back! Went with my boyfriend on a Sunday evening, we ordered the Pacific Fried roll, the Superman roll, teriyaki chicken, teriyaki squid, and a side of rice. Both of the sushi rolls were AMAZING, seriously some of the best sushi I've ever had! It's obvious they have a very experienced sushi chef. The staff was friendly but they did switch off a little and got our teriyaki squid confused (we ordered it cajun and it came out plain). The restaurant itself was very beautiful, minimally designed and very open and bright, and they bring you hot towels before your meal. We sat in the sushi bar area and it was very quiet and peaceful, even though it is next to a cook-in-front-of-you performance area. From what I overheard of that, it sounded a lot less obnoxious than some other Japanese steakhouses I've been to where the chef is more concerned with cracking jokes than cooking food. I did not get that vibe from Nakato and cannot wait to go back with a group and sit around the grill. Very satisfied.Oh and PS, this would be a great place to take a date! Sit in the sushi bar if you want a more intimate, relaxing evening or sit around a grill if you want a more exciting night!"], ["Amanda B.", "This is the best Japanese steakhouse I've ever been to in a long time. The food is outstanding, the wait staff is friendly and accommodating, and the seating doesn't make you feel like you have to rub elbows with your neighbor. The place is divided into 2 sections. The hibachi grills and the sushi bar. You have a choice of sitting in chairs at the hibachi grills or going into 1 of their rooms where you have to take your shoes off and sit down on the floor (they provide pillows). I haven't had the chance to sit on the floor yet, so I won't include that in my review.You make your selections off the menu and have some time to sit and chat with other people at the table. Their iced tea is always perfect (whether you get sweet or not), and your glass is always full. The 1st items to come out are the ginger salad and soup. I normally pass on the soup, but I love their ginger salad. It's not over powering with ginger like most dressings that are in this category.Next comes the appetizers and sushi. I would recommend the calamari steaks (but don't take left overs home, they don't save well) and for the sushi, try the one that has \"Pacific or Pacifica\" in the name (sorry, I can't remember what it's called). Every time my husband and I have their sushi, it's always fresh and tastes wonderful. The entertainment begins when the chef comes out to cook your meal. I like how they confirm your order and they pay special attention to any modifications that you've made to your order. This part is great for kids. They cut the tails off of the shrimp and throw them in their hat, light an onion stack on fire and make a train noise with the spatula, and they do an egg roll before throwing it in the air and breaking it in half on the spatula! The meal portions are reasonable and get extra shrimp sauce (it's the pink stuff)! Of course, everything is nice and hot when it hits your plate and fresh because it's cooked right there in front of you. On my first trip there, I was pleasantly surprised that I wasn't hot from the grill (yes, I've been to some places where I was sweating when the cooking was finished).If you have a birthday, this is a great place to go! You get your meal like always and they give you a cake (that is so sweet, your teeth will rot with 1 bite), they sing to you in Japanese, and you get your picture taken and it is framed (a paper frame, but hey it's still cool lookin).I can keep going on and on about how great this place is. I will keep going back until they close! I do have to point out, if you're not careful, the bill can get a bit high if you keep adding all the goodies they offer. If you want a good comparison, go to Kabuto's and then Nakato's and you'll see a huge difference."], ["Tracie S.", "I love Nakato! \u00a0They always have the freshest sushi, and I love the variety of special rolls. \u00a0 I have never had a bad experience here. \u00a0The staff are fantastic as well. \u00a0This is the place to go if you're in the University area!"], ["BJ S.", "Domo Aragato for Nakato!!!!Yum is all I can say!! \u00a0Walking in to a grand foyer to be greeted by friendly hostess' and a minimal wait for the hibachi! \u00a0SO we mosied on over to the bar and made the decision to hit the mai tai! \u00a0Something fantastical about that drink! \u00a0LOL... \u00a0Once we made it to the hibachi grill the waitress took our order,being vegan I asked if they would be able to avoid the egg in the rice, once I said that she immediately offered all suggestions for me to eat! \u00a0I was shocked at the offering, usually not a normal approach from the wait staff!! \u00a0The MISO soup was by far the most flavorful that I've ever had! \u00a0It was flavor explosion in my mouf!

Wife had a hibachi craving, and fellas, we all know how that goes...best to say, yes dear and ask where, and the \"when\" is immediately. Not going to lie, I'm glad it was hibachi and not ice cream :). You walk into Nakato and are greeted immediately. We made a reservation so we checked in and got a buzzer. Only strange thing was the 2 story lounge/bar area and the TV's in odd locations. No worries, just grabbed a spot on a couch while we waited. Only 2-3 minutes. Upon being sat, our waitress came by right away and she was very nice. I can tell they take their service commitment to heart. The menu is extensive with hibachi offerings. They also have sushi, so if you want that make sure to ask for that menu too. Went with the \"Nakato Delight\" which came with shrimp, chicken & NY steak for $23.95. Most of the entrees (combo) are around $20. For extra items or premium like filet or lobster expect and extra $5 or so. Also went with the fried rice which was $1.75...kind of annoying, but no big deal, as I like egg in my rice. Came with onion soup, salad w/ginger, shrimp app (small), noodles & veggies (surprised variety!), rice and of course the meat. I was doing fine on my \"timing\" until the the noodles & veggies came. Soup and salad...gone, no problem. Then a FULL plate of noodles/veggies...as I'm eating, I see the rice start an say oh \"SH&T\" and start to eat faster while my wife watches and is content letting her plate rise with goodness and not concerned about \"timing\". Little did I see/know as I finished shoveling the noodles/veggies that the rice had their own separate bowl and did not need a place on my plate...ha...oh well, there was room if needed now!
