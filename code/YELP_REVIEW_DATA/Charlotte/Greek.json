The only downside is Friday nights - we've been a few times and they've run out of hummus!!! A mediterranean place without hummus is disappointing - but the babbaghanoush is solid and the falafels are also very good.

I would skip the Zataar, the Babba Ghanouj and the Falafels.

Today I was told no we can't do that! I explained we always order the same thing every time was told, No! The manager looked right at me and said NO, then hung his head down and wouldn't look at me. He didn't offer any solution! He could of said well I am sorry but we can do that but we can... Or we can but its going to cost a little more, just a flat at No we can't to that! I waited for a solution, but he was unresponsive. Total lack of customer service and no healthy options for children! Only fries as a side for kids - I am sure in Lebanon they don't just give fries to kids. \u00a0Restaurants should offer healthy options or substitutions for kids not just unhealthy fries. To be blunt parsley, tomato, onions, mint & \u00a0bulgar is not pricey! My 18 month old loves tabbouleh, kibbeh, falafel, & hummus. \u00a0After we were refused service we went over to the Kabob Grill in Ballantyne and they gladly served my 18 month old chicken and tabbouleh, \u00a0(subbing the fries) no questions asked. The server even commented how well she ate. Needless to say we will not be returning to the restaurant due to the extremely RUDE service and lack of management skills. \u00a0I recommend you check out the Kabob Grill in Ballantyne or Dilworth.

It's not fast food but well worth the wait for such high quality food. Service was given with a smile and quite efficient. The baba ghanouj was smoky, creamy, with tender pieces of eggplant and wonderful notes of herbs, lemon, and olive oil. Personally I favor Greek pita bread over Lebanese, but it was a great vehicle for this delicious dip. The chicken gyros sandwich was perfectly prepared, tender and juicy chicken, with a fabulously fresh tzaziki (yogurt and garlic sauce), and just amazing. I swear I was licking my fingers!

They come fully loaded with pieces of shaved beef and lamb, \u00a0diced tomatoes and the greatest tasting tzatziki sauce to ever cover this middle eastern taco. Everything \u00a0seems to be made in house, hence the freshness. Therefore, depending on how busy they are; expect to wait anywhere from 10 to 20 min to get your food. It's worth the wait.

During a foray into the adjacent Dippin Dots, I saw people filing into this joint and thought it was worth a yelpy lookup. It has deservedly acquired four and a half stars from the yelp community and here's why:* Education: They take the time to explain the meat/entree offerings in a way that doesn't demean, but offers insight into which you might prefer. You can also see the skewers of meat right in front of you in a visually *enticing* cooler. They also have detailed explanations of all those tongue-twisting Mediterranean food descriptors, e.g. shawarma, fatoush, tabbouleh...* Variety: Please note that vegetarians can actually grow both fat and happy here. From a simple hummus to lumps of perfectly crispy falafel or perhaps baba ganoush, eat your fill. As I didn't sample the meat options (we all know why), I had to depend on the Mr's refined palate, which suggests that the chicken skewers are the way to go. They also serve Lebanese beer and wine. Cheers!* Atmosphere: It's Mediterranean quick-casual. FINALLY. You don't have to go somewhere promising Friday night belly dancing in order to partake in this savory, fresh fare. I, whose belly will remain shirted, am delighted about the atmosphere. Nothing at all fancy here. Simple plates, self-serve soda/tea fountain, friendly staff (who recognized us when we returned only two days after our initial visit).* Food: Delicious. An excellent choice for a Ballantyne-area lunch or quick dinner that won't leave you feeling bloated and ready for a nap. Great value as well. I'll probably not order falafel anywhere else, because my poor, spoiled taste buds would likely revolt.All in all, this spot is definitely worth a visit. If you live in the area, it's an added bonus.

Not mushy or overdone. \u00a0Simply perfect. \u00a0And the tanhini was applied judiciously, adding some nice nutty flavor to the dish without dripping all over my hands. \u00a0The hummus was rich and creamy (perhaps not as much garlic as I like), but just so FRESH. \u00a0And the salad was great. \u00a0An abundance of crumbled feta cheese and a really wonderful dressing on top of fresh lettuce and green pepper. \u00a0I will definitely be back."], ["Bob F.", "Everything here is fantastic.

The choices on the menu were limited, we ordered a few of our usual. The food was very good, as good as can expected for this type of place. I thought the prices were maybe a little high (for the venue) but not too bad. The service was unexpectedly slow but very friendly, we weren't in a hurry anyway.

We went a couple of weeks ago on a weeknight, and I have to say, I'm impressed.Having traveled to Italy and Greece, we are not strangers to Mediterranean food. Still, it was refreshing to have one of the young men in the restaurant meet our eyes as soon as we walked in, and ask if we'd like an explanation of their menu. He took us over to the case and showed us their kabobs, as well as their sides. He explained how we could order the different combinations, and then left us to confer amongst ourselves.We each ordered a platter. I ordered the chicken kabobs, my husband ordered the trio of kabobs. We ordered different sides in order to sample them all: hummus for me, babba ghanouj for my husband.We sat down to wait at a table, and after a few minutes they brought out our orders. Interestingly, our kabobs came with the wrong sides on the plates, but frankly this wasn't an issue since we were just doing a big old taste test of everything we could get.An older gentleman (perhaps the owner?) came by to present me with a garlic aioli sort of dip for the chicken. It was DELICIOUS and so garlicky! We asked for more, and asked what they called it. \"Chicken sauce,\" he said, with a laugh as he gave away the secret recipe of garlic and fresh mayonnaise. I don't care how simple it was, I loved it.The food was fresh and delicious. The staff was smiling and friendly. I couldn't ask for more from a restaurant. Well - maybe if it was sit down service with menus, but I won't dock them for that. Zeitouni is what it is - a counter service restaurant. Their food shines beyond \"counter service\" which implies almost a fast food style. Zeitouni is not \"fast food\" in my opinion. It's delicious, flavorful and fresh, designed to be savored. So it's a bit of a disconnect, but I forgive them for that because well, if you taste this food, you'd forgive just about anything else.My recommendation for dining at Zeitouni is that you call ahead and order delicious meals to enjoy in your home. If you're looking for a tasty and fresh lunch, or out for a quick dinner, it's an okay place ambiance-wise, in which to enjoy it, but the fast food feel might turn you off for a date night out. Regardless of how you enjoy their food, it is amazingly delicious food that is meant to be enjoyed. We'll be back again and again, but likely with a carryout bag to savor in our home.

The prices are inflated for dinner. For reference, at Kabob Grill, a vegetarian plate and chicken shawarma wrap cost us $24 for takeout before a tip; no drinks or extras included.

I understand that falafel is dry in nature, but it shouldn't be this dry. Btw, the shawarma is dry too, but it seemed better after the falafel.

Decided to grab all of these to-go.Goodness. There was nothing left once we were done eating. The hommos is sooooo creamy. Not a speck of grittiness to be found. The falafel is crispy and herby and works great on its own or in a pita as a gyro. The tabbouleh isn't my favorite, but the addition of bulgur wheat is nice. The shawarma is my favorite.

Hardly any chicken on it and it came with no sides. I ordered the mixed grill plate. The meats were pretty good, but the kafka was bone dry and my sides were awful.

We always walked by and considered trying it out but never did until a friend told me they serve the best gyros she's ever had. Great recommendation! We love this place now. I always order a gyro, either chicken or falafel. The chicken is delicious, very simply prepared with tzatziki, tomato, lettuce and red onions, but still flavorful. The falafel is good, too. Sometimes a bit under-seasoned, but still good. My husband prefers the burger. It's seasoned well and you can add American, mozzarella or feta cheese. They have seasoned french fries, too. We like them all: lemon-oregano, cumin and garlic and, plain with sea salt. Their hummus is delicious too. The flavors change weekly, my favorite is probably the rosemary hummus. The restaurant itself is small but comfortable. It's in a great location within Blakeney. The staff is awesome. They're so nice and you can tell they take pride in what they do. Gr\u00e9co Fresh Grille is a great, quick Mediterranean restaurant."], ["Anna D.", "One of our favorite places in Ballantyne. Kid friendly, fast service and delicious food.

Coming from New Jersey, I've tried many Greek places in the NY/NJ area. Never have I tried a place as authentic and as delicious as Greco Fresh Grille!

Pastitsio was listed as a special with the description of \"Greek Lasagne\" - sounded good but I was there for the gyro and fries. The food was great, but I wish they'd offer a combo with side items other than fries. Perhaps some hummus or a small greek salad. It's so easy to go there and get a gyro and fries, and then leave feeling like you've eaten something as heavy as 5 Guys next door.The owner is there every time I visit, and he stopped by to check on how things were going. This is still a winner of a place to me. It's exactly what I'd hoped for when they opened."], ["Eric B.", "I'll go ahead and reiterate what everyone has already said, this place is fantastic. There isn't anything I can even think of to nitpick, their ingredients are fresh, consistent, and certainly filling. The gyros are awesome, the lamb is juicy and well seasoned, the tzatziki is creamy, and the onions are nice and crisp. The baklava is fresh and flaky as well. As good as their sandwiches are, the fries are even better. Probably top five I've ever had, and some of the best seasoned. I've ordered a couple orders of their fries in different flavors for parties and it's always a crowd-pleaser.

Only get one order for the table though; as the portion is ample and you WILL clean your plate.The tzatiki is so creamy and light...I always get extras.Mmmmmm, I am hungry remembering the lamb burger on pita; wow...I call that happiness on a plate.Greek salad and shrimp pita are just some of my other favorites.Oh, I almost forgot the prices are so reasonable for the quality and if you want extra tzatiki, they don't nickel and dime you; they happily give you more with a smile.And they are family owned; very nice people.Gotta go; I need me some Greco love."], ["Ruchi M.", "Being from new york, I have tried greek food at several places. I didn't quite like the food at Greco as it came across as not authentic at all. The chicken in the gyro was very dry and hard to chew. The hummus that came along with the meal was cold, stale, dry and not tasteful at all. I can say garlic hummus that is store bought could taste better. Overall, My experience was not great.

They no longer offer the delicious Melitzonasalata, I was told because locals are not interested. Galaktompureko sorry no we don't have any, I didn't see any spinach pie ... it's pretty much down to people lining up for Gyro and \"Greek\" fries. Even the gyro (which is still good) is not what it used to be - more grease, less flavor ... is that pressed lamb meat? Not the same.I brought home the Lahano salad, which turned out to be nothing but shredded cabbage with a tiny bit of Arugula, essentially $7 for a plate of slaw. Studying the menu after the fact I see I was supposed to spend an \u00a0additional $3-$4 for chicken or some other protein on top, Greek salad? I think not. \u00a0If enough people notice maybe the owners will raise their standards but I won't be holding my breath."], ["Benjamin G.", "Finally ventured into this little Blakeney gem. My wife had been before and had great things to say so, needless to say, we were long overdue. Resting amongst more attractive and simple options for suburban folk, I'm happy to say Greco Fresh Grille is local-biz lover's haven. Small, shotgun setup on the inside and a handful of tables out back. The outdoor seating is great, but goes quite fast if it's a nice day. Get at it quick! Always nice to see filled tables at an off hour. Telltale sign this place is doing something right. Friendly service behind the counter. Welcoming and helpful. Here's our order: Got cups for water. They have pepsi products. (No hard feelings. I'm just a coke guy through and through. I'll make an exception for Cheerwine, however. Viva NC)Spinach Pie. To the Greek-savvy, Spanakopita. Amazing. The phyllo is perfectly crispy, flaky and crunches/dissolves with each bite. The spinach filling is savory and not too rich and creamy. Comes with 6 pieces, so perfect for a table of two. If you're sharing with more than two, you'll have to fight for more than one piece! I'd get this every time. My wife got the veggie gyro. Great mix of roasted red peppers, cucumber, red onion and great tzatziki. I'm a fan. The pita is thick and chewy, but not offensively so. I'd be hard pressed to shove a few pieces of the spinach pie in this bad boy! Loved all of the textures and flavors. Not overpowering and a great veggie option. I got the lamp gyro. Voted best in the QC by the Observer. I say rightfully so. Generous helping of lamb, balanced well with fresh veggies and, yet again, a nice slather of that great tzatziki. Each bite was great and I was only disappointed once it was gone. Prices are very reasonable. We ate for $20 and were happily full!Parking can be an issue, as there aren't many spaces directly in front of the shop. Not uncommon for Blakeney spots. I'd park over near the Starbucks. Can't wait to head back and stuff my face with more Greek food. Opa!Cheers."], ["Peter S.", "I love this place. The chicken gyro is amazing and extremely well priced.

Lamb gyros, chicken gyros, vegetarian stuffed grape leaves, lemon oregano fries, etc.. \u00a0I have had the chicken gyro, the plain hummus, and the lemon oregano fries. \u00a0The gyro is delicious; they do not skimp on the chicken, and there is a lot of seasoning and oil on it. \u00a0Do NOT remove it from the foil lest you would like oil dripping all over you. \u00a0The hummus is probably the best I have had around here. \u00a0It's very fresh and there are no fillers in it. \u00a0The menu states \"If it's harder to pronounce than a Greek last name, then you shouldn't be eating it.\". \u00a0The lemon oregano fries are decent. \u00a0They are not necessarily my flavor preference, but they are good for what they are.The people working, from the Greek cooks/owners, to the teenage girls usually running the register, are all very friendly. \u00a0So if you want a good, fresh gyro at a fair price in south Charlotte, Greco's is the place to go."], ["Megan B.", "Very good and reasonably priced. \u00a0Love the gyros and the different fries. \u00a0My boyfriend is Greek and he gives it a thumbs up too. \u00a0We've been coming here since it opened. \u00a0I believe the man who opened it came here from NJ. \u00a0He and his family are very nice and friendly."], ["Sree N.", "Authentic Greek restaurant!

I can't wait to go back and try other menu items. Highlights: Food was the star of the night. Service and ambience a close second. Waiting to head to the Charlotte Film Festival on a cold and rainy night, I stumbled upon this place on Yelp & decided to give it a go. I was quickly seated on a Friday night at 8p. The menu overwhelms the mind a bit, as it has many traditional Mediterranean centerpieces, a good amount of seafood choices, and a handful of other entrees and sides (such as pizza and lasagna).I began with the falafel appetizer, and it did not disappoint. 4 perfectly fried balls of goodness, swimming in a shallow pool of some of the best tzatziki sauce I've ingested. I lived in the LA area for 10 years, and this was one of the top 3 falafels I've ever experienced.As for the entree, I asked my waiter, Daniel, his recommendation, and without hesitation, he suggested the Lamb 'Youvetsi Me Manestra'. It is described as \"slow braised lamb shank, tomato shallot orzo, mizithra cheese.\" Wow. Just, wow. It was very close to a perfect dish. The lamb was tender and fell apart as the mizithra cheese slowly melted into each bite, adding another layer of flavor. Spices were mixed in well, and the perfectly cooked orzo complimented each bite . It was a good sized portion, but I had to finish it. It was one of those meals you didn't want to end.Do yourself a favor and give Ilios Noche a try. Date night, anniversary, or just after a long week of work, this is the kind of restaurant that deserves to be celebrated."], ["Kia T.", "I came here for brunch and I wasn't impressed by their brunch menu. It lacks depth and creative choices for brunch options. There were three fritattas and some omelet options and of course waffles and pancakes. I was just searching for something more creative. \u00a0It was a little heavier on the lunch side than brunch. I got the chicken and waffle sandwich. I had issues with it and had to send it back. I'm not one for sending food back unless it's just wrong. The chicken wasn't well seasoned and desperately needed some salt. \u00a0The waffles were rock hard, you could Crack a tooth on them. I was with a large party and 3 of us hard waffles and we sent them all back. Both times my sandwich didn't have the honey&hot sauce and ligonberry jam on it as described on the menu. When I asked about the jam, no one seemed to know or realized that the jam was supposed to be on the sandwich. And I never did get the honey & hot sauce combo. The Greek fries were great. I actually paired them with their homemade tzatziki sauce, which I was charged $1 extra for a small ramekin of. If I come back here, I will try dinner and not brunch. Maybe their dinner dishes are winners. Fingers crossed!"], ["Gideon R.", "Ilios Noche has a great menu! I start with the Musclun Salad, which has candied walnuts and blue cheese.

The decor is generic-upscale wanna be, there's nothing ethnic or cute about it.We love Greek and Mediterranean food in general. We were very interested in this place and their take on that type of food. I'd say after dinning at this place that we enjoyed their appetizers more than their regular entrees. Their menu is too much of a mix of things, tries to please too much: pizza, pasta, some Greek dishes.For appetizers we got the fried zucchini and eggplant chips (they were very good) w. cucumber yogurt and the meatballs (they're just OK). For entrees we chose their pork chops (read good things about them) which were big, too much meat, dry, kind of bland, I couldn't sense the lemon flavor or coriander (they were supposed to have). Their fries were good. The coleslaw with olives (not the most Greek idea for a dish in the world) came later, way after they brought the pork chops with the Greek Fries. If I pay around $20 for an entree, I want all the components \u00a0that are listed in the menu to be brought in the same time (it's just coleslaw). The service wasn't that great, they don't bring the coleslaw when they're supposed to, but then they keep coming to your table to rush you to finish the food with a typical question:\" Still working on it?\" - I'm eating, not \"working\". \u00a0Overall, this place doesn't have flavor in their food as well as in their decor.

I wished they had actually called the dishes their real Greeks names (ie: gyros, souvlaki) but they have to appeal to Southerners who aren't always up for weird words. (gyros = yeee roes).Anyways, we had the hummus and salad plate which was very good. The chicken roll ups were nice and warm with a definite Greek flavor, the shrimp kebabs were entirely too spicy, though. My 11 year old loves spicy so he ordered these knowing it would be a little hot. They were scorching hot. I wish they would've noticed that a kid was ordering this and said something. The \"pick 2\" that my 16 year old got was less successful. He opted for the cookie side dish -other choices were salad, fruit, dessert or hummus which is a nice selection - but his sandwich was TINY and the cookie didn't round out the meal much by making it full-size. Go for a bigger side dish unless you aren't that hungry! My one complaint was the pita. It's very good here, warm little triangular pieces served with the meal and with the hummus, but they don't give you enough! There was easily a half cup of hummus on my salad plate but only 4 triangles which was probably the size of a small pita or even half of a larger one. I asked for more when I went inside (we ate on the patio which was nice) and the girl there seemed baffled. They should be throwing this stuff around left and right because it is dirt cheap, calls out for hummus and a drink and really makes for a well-rounded looking meal. So, I said we had too much hummus left and needed more pita. She brought out...4 triangles. We actually laughed because these things are about the size of one Doritos chip. Oh, well. It was tasty, at least!The bill came to $35 for 2 meals,1 half sandwich and cookie and 1 hummus and salad plate. Not expensive but not cheap. Healthy and fresh and nicely different.

I live steps away from Zetouni and I like different items on the menu from each. The staff at zetouni is pleasant, attentive and efficient. There were 2 tables of 2 when I came in. The teenager working doesn't say hello, doesn't look up at you. As she's looking at her phone says \"what do you want to order\". RUDE. I ordered one of the specials for the night. Gyro sandwich and SALAD. Fine. Seems easy enough for a Greek restaurant no? I nicely asked for extra tomatoes and onions. The nasty lady behind the counter gave me a dirty look as soon as she heard it. Fine. 10 mins go by as I watch the child working stomp her feet around the restaurant in her leggings and Tshirt - very professional. My food is ready and again, without looking up, \"utensils?\" \u00a0I reply \"no thank you, may I have some tatziki sauce on the side. The nasty one in the back chimes in \"that'll be 70 cents\". The child proceeds to turn to me and for the first time actually looks me in the eye \"it's 70 cents\". The lady in the back will not hand her the sauce yet. Fine. I only had a debit card on me so that's what I handed her. SEVENTY CENTS. she swiped my card for seventy cents. Good luck with that credit card processing fee owner!!! I have NEVER in my life seen anything like this. She slaps the receipt and my card on the counter, nasty in the back hands her the sauce. She puts it on the counter and walks away. I am really not a difficult customer nor do I expect anything I don't pay for or deserve. That being said WHEN I ORDER AND PAY FOR SALAD IT'S MIND BLOWING THAT I GET HOME TO FREAKING FRENCH FRIES. ?????What gives here? It's a shame because the food is actually good. Which is why I gave the extra star but after my experience today- whether they care or not - they have lost me as a customer. It really is too bad because there used to be a very sweet lady running the counter who couldn't have been nicer.

The tzatziki sauce was $.65 extra but it's some of the best I've tried. The tea is sweet, but that's how I like it. \u00a0The fries are big, thick steak fries (I prefer crinkle). The Greek salad is wide cut iceburg lettuce (I like the stingy kind better), a peice of red onion, a couple grape tomoatoes, a cucumber, I sliver of green pepper, one seeded kalamata olive, a tiny bit of feta, and on the side you get ample olive oil vinagarette, which they make too tart and peppery for my taste (too vinegarey, if that's a word). \u00a0I put some of the cucumber sauce in my salad to take the tartness off and will probably do that every time. The salad was ok, not outstanding, but fresh. \u00a0I'd like it cut up more, but, hey, they did give me a plastc fork and knife. The prices were very good.
