When Graham and I were going to bed Friday night it dawned on me that we had no plans for Saturday morning, so I decided that we needed to have brunch. I hopped on Open Table and made a reservation. The restaurant is over on a side of town that was always pretty shady when I was a kid. So it's very cool to see it being revitalized and filling up with excellent, local places.Graham and I started with cocktails. I had a $3 mimosa and he had a bloody mary. Their bloody mary bar is pretty awesome. You pick the vodka, and choose from a variety of mixers and add-ins. I had never had a bloody mary before, so I had a sip of his. I took one sip and promptly realized I don't care for them and would be sticking with mimosas.Graham had a breakfast that was, in his words, \"a vegans nightmare\". This was two eggs, a potato cake, and steaks with carmelized onions and bernaise sauce. This breakfast made me wish I liked runny eggs, because this looked so, so good. I did try the steak though, and it (and the sauce) was so delicious.His breakfast had nothing on my french toast. This was a huge piece of brioche, fresh fruit, syrup and orange zest. This was sweet, delicious and filling. I typically don't like syrup on my french toast, but with the fruit and the hint of orange flavor, it really worked. I would order this again and again. I did order a side of bacon (un-pictured), which was just okay. It was thick, but wasn't crispy at all.The server was a little slack (it took way to long for her to return with drinks and to take our orders, since there were only 2 other tables in the entire restaurant, but whatever. She was friendly and our food was delicious."], ["Janeka H.", "I went here for Sunday brunch on Father's Day and I was expecting to enjoy some good food. \u00a0However, I didn't really enjoy the food or the service. \u00a0It seemed like I waited forever for the french toast and bacon to come out. \u00a0And once I got it... I wasn't pleased with the quality. \u00a0It was just mediocre. \u00a0From the buffet, I had their watered down cheese grits and their not so fresh watermelon. \u00a0The items that I thought was okay at the buffet was the biscuits with white gravy and their Mac and cheese. \u00a0Typically their buffet is $20 but for Fathers Day...I paid $30. \u00a0And it was a complete waste of money. \u00a0I don't think that I would ever come back here. \u00a0Sorry Bistro La Bon, I'm just not that into you."], ["Elisabeth B.", "Countless incredible meals later I'm ready to lay five stars on Bistro La Bon. Their cuisine consistently is innovative enough to push your food comfort zones- lamb belly anyone? Served in a comfortable and gracious environment. You may have dined here for their famous brunch buffet. I implore you to try them for dinner. For an extra special good time:1. Sit in the spacious bar area. Many tables and several couches. The couches are where it's at. 2. $6 cocktails on Wednesdays. And yes they even ran that special on New Year's Eve. 3. Snag a handful of bar bites. These offerings are a teensy tiny bit smaller than the small plates served in the dining room but a couple bucks cheaper. You won't be missing out. 4. If it's on the menu-Try lamb belly, tuna tartare, lavender chicken (it's often listed as a main too and the best chicken you'll ever order out), their mussels are divine and the grilled octopus is on point. Oh yeah, the bread pudding is worth it. It's the bar I compare all bread puddings too. Perfect way to end a meal."], ["Kaitlin L.", "Amazing dessert, wonderful food, and great atmosphere!

This is definitely not a typical brunch menu--you won't see pancakes, sausage links, or cereal stations here. Instead you get a variety of dishes like kielbasa and streusel, chocolate waffles, brisket, and biscuits and gravy. You can still order scrambled eggs and bacon direct from the kitchen to your table, but don't look for those standard items in the brunch area. A nice treat is a wide variety of freshly baked sweets, including MACAROONS. The macaroons pretty much sold me.Service is also very good.

The pictures looked great, there were rave reviews, should've been an easy win!I ordered the french toast - but, it was a bit burnt on the edges. Not like caramelized burnt, just burnt. And, nothing really special about it to be honest. However, the bacon was phenomenal. I wouldn't recommend the french toast nor order it again. Next time I would order probably a classic breakfast (the people next to me had this and it looked awesome).

And a decent selection on the buffet including jalape\u00f1o macaroni and cheese, Swedish meatballs, pot roast, sausage and cabbage, grits and biscuits and gravy.The highlights for me were the meatballs, biscuits and gravy and sausage and cabbage. The French toast has a bit too much orange zest for my liking and the grits and mac and cheese were classic. Nice job! Honestly, everything here is worth trying!

The decor was simple Moroccan/Mediterranean prints and patterns, with pillows everywhere - don't let the strip mall location throw you off; the inside of this restaurant is absolutely adorable. The in-house menu is much more extensive than what you'll find online, and is full of traditional Moroccan/Mediterranean dishes seasoned with cumin and saffron spices. (I had the kafta tagine - small beef meatballs served in tomato sauce with peas and onions ... delicious!) And to top it all off, our server was incredibly helpful: at restaurants, I always want to find a dish that can't be easily replicated (by myself or by another restaurant) and so I lean heavily on the wait staff to help me make my decision; our server was very honest about all the dishes on the menu and proffered his opinion which ultimately led to my decision of the tagine and to our decision about the appetizer. At the end of our meal, he recommended a mint-and-honey tea which was a perfect complement to the rest of the evening's food and drink. Highly recommended!!"], ["Brad B.", "Been here a few times for a local book club. Atmosphere is nice and food is good. I'd recommend giving it a try."], ["Mandar V.", "Food maybe delicious... But if you are hungry, don't even think of stopping by here! Too much waiting time... I am concluding after a few number of visits. I am writing this as I wait for my next order gets served!!"], ["Justin D.", "This place has so much potential. What they do well - namely, the couscous, gyros and tagines - they do damn-near perfectly. Where they fall short, improvement would be easy and inexpensive. So, like a middle-school English teacher with a bright but lazy student, I'm simultaneously pleased, annoyed, and yet hopeful for progress.First, the praise. I've tried the baba ganoush just about everywhere in Charlotte you're like to find it. Casablanca Cafe's is easily the best. I simply can't recommend the lamb couscous highly enough. It's truly a thing of beauty; full of big chunks of fresh veggies and a generous size of perfectly seasoned lamb that really does fall off the bone. The French bread they serve with it is a delicious and authentic reminder that Morocco was a French colony until 1956. The tagine is very good and quite authentic, but lacks the vegetables you get in the couscous. For a simple lunch, the beef gyro is fantastic with a creamy garlic sauce. Try it wish their slightly smoky hot sauce. It's called harissa, although the girl at the counter didn't seem to know that. A repeated source of frustration is their continued failure to actually provide what is on the menu. Where a side of grilled vegetables is offered you will have to make due with a decent but unremarkable salad. And don't even bother ordering the Moroccan Symphony (assorted Moroccan pastries). They never have it. Seriously, never. Which is a shame, since the mix of French influence and the Islamic affinity for sweets makes Moroccan pastries some of the best in the world. I've been coming here since it opened about three years ago. At that time it looked like little more than a gutted Subway whose future was yet to be determined. Since then they've made some small efforts to impart some Moroccan style to the dining room. However, dimming the lights, painting the walls a dark color and draping some fabric like a tent to hide those bland and decidedly un-Moroccan ceiling tiles would go a long way to making the place feel much more authentic. Also, as enthralling as those soap-operaesque music videos they play on Arabic MTV are, there must be a better musical option than Egypt's answer to Ricky Martin's \"Shake Your Bon-Bon\".

We walked around for a couple minutes and came back to find the door locked again, this time when we looked in the window we saw two staff members looking back at us and then ducked/hid behind their curtains.

No where is empty on the weekends, and I don't think anyone stays home on the weekends for dinner!!! This place was completely empty. We were the only customers the entire time we were there.

Their stuffed grape leaves were the best thing we had the entire meal.Hubby and myself both ordered tagine, I got lamb and he got the fish. The fish was fishy...I like fish, but this just wasn't exactly right, and I can't put my finger on where it went wrong. The lamb was tender but dry...I know that sounds strange too!!! But, it was pull apart tender, but there was no moisture, no succulence...it was ok.Our other issue is that we wanted \"authentic\" Moroccan food...If you have ever read any of my other reviews...we really really like different foods.But, when we were ordering the waitress told us that \"authentic\" came with french fries, and the \"american\" style came with rice... This just doesn't seem right to me. But, the rice was nicely cooked and flavored.Sometimes an ethnic restaurant can suffer from trying to stay too true to their roots, and fall short because the ingredients are lacking here in the states.But, sometimes an ethnic restaurant can suffer by trying to americanize their menu...and going way too far.I think this is the problem with Casablanca.

The chicken roll ups were nice and warm with a definite Greek flavor, the shrimp kebabs were entirely too spicy, though. My 11 year old loves spicy so he ordered these knowing it would be a little hot. They were scorching hot. I wish they would've noticed that a kid was ordering this and said something. The \"pick 2\" that my 16 year old got was less successful. He opted for the cookie side dish -other choices were salad, fruit, dessert or hummus which is a nice selection - but his sandwich was TINY and the cookie didn't round out the meal much by making it full-size. Go for a bigger side dish unless you aren't that hungry! My one complaint was the pita. It's very good here, warm little triangular pieces served with the meal and with the hummus, but they don't give you enough! There was easily a half cup of hummus on my salad plate but only 4 triangles which was probably the size of a small pita or even half of a larger one. I asked for more when I went inside (we ate on the patio which was nice) and the girl there seemed baffled. They should be throwing this stuff around left and right because it is dirt cheap, calls out for hummus and a drink and really makes for a well-rounded looking meal. So, I said we had too much hummus left and needed more pita. She brought out...4 triangles. We actually laughed because these things are about the size of one Doritos chip. Oh, well.

Had to get another server to fix our drinks because our server was, once again! no where to be found. The price is great. And from the looks of everyone else's plate since I still haven't gotten mine after about 30 mins, I can't tell you how it tastes.As I look around... I see that those around were served quickly, while friend and I, whom are African American, we're not waited on as quicky. Very disappointing.

The fella and I stopped in for lunch on a Tuesday around 11:45, and by noon, the place was hopping. And our waiter was just about the nicest, friendliest, smile-ist person I've ever met. Maybe because he eats there all the time and it makes you happy?I got the kofta (beef and lamb) kebabs, and the fella got the chicken kebabs. We were just boring enough to get the same two sides, too - rice pilaf and steamed veggies. He liked my meat better than his, and I liked his meat better than mine, so we gave each other one of our two kebabs. His chicken sauce was like a spicy, Crisco, and my sauce was tzatziki but a little thinner than I'm used to. The rice was almost sweet... and I ate almost all of it.All of that was only $21 (we both got waters), and the service can't be beat.

The servers are extremely nice and have great knowledge of the menu. They'll make a custom order with just about anything without really breaking a sweat.Food:Here's where I got some disappointments. I ordered the lamb over rice with a lentil soup * Falafels. The falafels were pretty good, the soup not so much, with the lamb being fairly dry. I got some garlic sauce on the side which really brought out the flavor of the lamb over rice. However, if I didn't order it regularly from other Mediterranean places, I would've been really disappointed with me meal.Venue:Very nice venue that seats a surprisingly large amount of people (even if it does look small). Extremely clean with plenty of room, has a very charlotte-esque feel.Overall, I believe this place is extremely overhyped, maybe because there's a lack of good Mediterranean food around the area.

My dinner companion had the Philly cheesesteak, which he enjoyed, and the chicken shawarma pita, which he said was not great - the pita was hard. The baklava was very disappointing.

Plus, in the University area, they were expecting a good deal.We started with the falafel appetizer, and we both really enjoyed it. Very tasty.My wife ordered the mixed kebab - three kebabs on rice with mixed veggies. I ordered the Turkish kebab with the rice and the lentil soup. We both highly recommend the soup. It was delicious, and we'll be making it ourselves in the future.The kebabs were all cooked very well. Seasoned and spiced very well, and very tasty. The rice was light and very flavorful. The only miss of the meal were the mixed veggies - apparently a nod to western tastes. Avoid them and get something that comes from the Mediterranean. The service was pleasant, and the place stayed busy. Overall, this is the best kebab/Mediterranean meal we've had in Charlotte, and we highly recommend it."], ["Mike K.", "The food at Le Kebab Grill is great! Everything tastes extremely fresh. Appetizers - The hummus is absolutely delicious! Lots of fresh soft pita bread. If you love hummus there is really no comparison when you get delicious fresh made hummus versus the stuff you get at the store. Lunch Special - You can get a skewer and two sides for a reasonable price. I usually opt for the kofta skewer, lentil soup and a salad. The lentil soup is very good. The salad comes with a delicious oil and lemon juice dressing that is very light and fresh. I have also had the gyro wrap and french fries. The gyro wrap is very good, the meat is soft and tender. The fries are crinkle cut. Service seems to be hit or miss here. Some of the servers are extremely friendly and helpful. Other times you get a server who seems like they just walked in off the street and aren't really sure what's going on. Also some servers are very good about timing what comes out when with your order and others not so much. Today our waitress was awful. Only came to one side of the table and asked us to pass food and pass our glasses for her to refill. It just was bizarre, like she didn't realize she could walk around to the side of the table. She also brought out french fries about 10 mins before our entrees. One take away when you look around at other patrons in a restaurant is if the ethnicity of the food they're serving matches that of the patrons - when I visit this restaurant there are always middle eastern patrons.

There are a lot of cheap options on the menu and they give you a big proportion! The hummus is amazing!!! You have to try! I don't usually like hummus, but this one is a must. I believe I got shawarma chicken with the yellow rice. It was very filling and the white sauce that come with it makes it taste even better. I got a salad as the side, but the dressing was a bit too much. I couldn't even eat more than two bites of the salad because of that. Besides the salad, I would recommend eating everything!

And it won't be my last time!Started with the Falaffel balls, with a delicious Tahini sauce. Very tasty and well seasoned. Due to the Yelp reviews, I tried the Lamb Shawarma which came with 2 sides, so I opted for their very delicious Lentil Soup (everyone who reviewed this was indeed correct - YUMMY) and the yellow basmati rice. The lamb didn't have any \"funk\" in it that it CAN have (at less than reputable establishments) and it was very delicious. A little \"odd\" in that they were small strips and not \"Greek Gyro-like\" in thicker strips....but boy do they give you a LOT of it. My only criticism is that the tahini sauce, which was the same they served with the Falaffel, didn't seem to go with the Lamb. A yogurt based sauce (like Tzatziki) would go better with the Lamb. But the lamb itself was delicious by itself.And just because I'm a Hummus Junkie, I had to leave with a side of their Hummus. I had it for breakfast the next day and it was very good! I'd personally like a tad more garlic in it but hey, it was very creamy and delicious.Oh, the staff and my server were all SUPER nice and friendly, and made sure my experience was a great one. It was. And when she found out it was my first time there, she threw in a Baklava for free. And it was very yummy as well!Overall a really great place for Simple but DELICIOUS Mediterranean food.

They were very funny and pretty much required me to try a sample to taste because they thought it was something I would not be familiar with and therefore I might not like it.

It will vary greatly with the potential language-barrier with some of the staff, but in the end They are very accommodating. It has indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating isn't on an enclosed patio so be prepared to be just kind of out there on the sidewalk. But it's cool :-)They do take quite a long time if placing a carry-out, for obvious reasons (freshness perhaps) so I do recommend calling way ahead.

Highlights: Food was the star of the night. Service and ambience a close second. Waiting to head to the Charlotte Film Festival on a cold and rainy night, I stumbled upon this place on Yelp & decided to give it a go. I was quickly seated on a Friday night at 8p. The menu overwhelms the mind a bit, as it has many traditional Mediterranean centerpieces, a good amount of seafood choices, and a handful of other entrees and sides (such as pizza and lasagna).I began with the falafel appetizer, and it did not disappoint. 4 perfectly fried balls of goodness, swimming in a shallow pool of some of the best tzatziki sauce I've ingested. I lived in the LA area for 10 years, and this was one of the top 3 falafels I've ever experienced.As for the entree, I asked my waiter, Daniel, his recommendation, and without hesitation, he suggested the Lamb 'Youvetsi Me Manestra'. It is described as \"slow braised lamb shank, tomato shallot orzo, mizithra cheese.\" Wow. Just, wow. It was very close to a perfect dish. The lamb was tender and fell apart as the mizithra cheese slowly melted into each bite, adding another layer of flavor. Spices were mixed in well, and the perfectly cooked orzo complimented each bite . It was a good sized portion, but I had to finish it. It was one of those meals you didn't want to end.Do yourself a favor and give Ilios Noche a try. Date night, anniversary, or just after a long week of work, this is the kind of restaurant that deserves to be celebrated."], ["Kia T.", "I came here for brunch and I wasn't impressed by their brunch menu. It lacks depth and creative choices for brunch options. There were three fritattas and some omelet options and of course waffles and pancakes. I was just searching for something more creative. \u00a0It was a little heavier on the lunch side than brunch. I got the chicken and waffle sandwich. I had issues with it and had to send it back. I'm not one for sending food back unless it's just wrong. The chicken wasn't well seasoned and desperately needed some salt. \u00a0The waffles were rock hard, you could Crack a tooth on them. I was with a large party and 3 of us hard waffles and we sent them all back. Both times my sandwich didn't have the honey&hot sauce and ligonberry jam on it as described on the menu. When I asked about the jam, no one seemed to know or realized that the jam was supposed to be on the sandwich. And I never did get the honey & hot sauce combo. The Greek fries were great. I actually paired them with their homemade tzatziki sauce, which I was charged $1 extra for a small ramekin of. If I come back here, I will try dinner and not brunch. Maybe their dinner dishes are winners. Fingers crossed!"], ["Gideon R.", "Ilios Noche has a great menu! I start with the Musclun Salad, which has candied walnuts and blue cheese.

Their menu is too much of a mix of things, tries to please too much: pizza, pasta, some Greek dishes.For appetizers we got the fried zucchini and eggplant chips (they were very good) w. cucumber yogurt and the meatballs (they're just OK). For entrees we chose their pork chops (read good things about them) which were big, too much meat, dry, kind of bland, I couldn't sense the lemon flavor or coriander (they were supposed to have). Their fries were good. The coleslaw with olives (not the most Greek idea for a dish in the world) came later, way after they brought the pork chops with the Greek Fries. If I pay around $20 for an entree, I want all the components \u00a0that are listed in the menu to be brought in the same time (it's just coleslaw). The service wasn't that great, they don't bring the coleslaw when they're supposed to, but then they keep coming to your table to rush you to finish the food with a typical question:\" Still working on it?\" - I'm eating, not \"working\". \u00a0Overall, this place doesn't have flavor in their food as well as in their decor. The food lacks the Mediterranean flavors and the place lacks the Mediterranean fun!"], ["Rachael B.", "My boyfriend and I went here for dinner tonight and we were not disappointed. \u00a0Our server was Phillip and he was absolutely phenomenal, very knowledgable and friendly. \u00a0We ordered the humus, olives, chicken souvlaki, caesar salad, and the fennel and grape salad with lamb. \u00a0All of the food was cooked and seasoned perfectly. \u00a0I was extremely happy to find out the founders are CIA alumni as well, it's always amazing to see what our alumni can do!!"], ["Rick T.", "Really good lamb burger, didn't like the bits of red onion in the meat though.

This item featured tzatziki, baba ganoush, roasted red pepper, and hummus dips. The flavors present in these dips were authentic, fresh, and very satisfying. The dips were accompanied by warm pita slices that provided a perfect accompaniment. For meals we enjoyed the combination of two different Mediterranean salads and a pita wrap. All of the food was fresh, promptly served, and everyone was pleased with the outcome. Additionally we were all surprised by the quality of the Greek potatoes that accompanied the pita sandwich.

Both me and my friend had the same platter and both used our mezz dips to drown the fish in. Neither one of us finished the fish. Could have used more artichokes in the potato, salad artichoke thing which was mostly just potatoes and nothing spectacular about that either.

We actually stumbled upon this place in some online listing as I haven't heard many people talking about it elsewhere.In general the venue didn't seem very well kept. The same owners manage the grocery store next to it so I imagine they are torn between the two spots at times. When I visited there was a table covered in food that looked to have been sitting there for a while and nobody in site to clean it up. It took some time for the one person who was working to come out, tidy up a bit and wait on us. In general wouldn't have been a problem with just one other person staffed. I suppose this is to be expected in a small space but could have made a better first impression if it were addressed.For the food, it could just be that this particular cuisine isn't my style, I'm willing to admit that. The cevapi was suggested because it was a specialty so I went with that. Again, I'm willing to admit it might just be a preference of mine but this dish really wasn't very appealing. Back to the staffing issue, it took a while for our food to come out and when it did, I wasn't impressed by the presentation, how greasy it was and how limited the options on my plate were to break up the greasy meat and greasy \u00a0bread it was served on. Unfortunately, I really can't see myself going back as I prefer cuisine with a bit more variety. I will say however that the meat pastries on the menu looked pretty good as well. If I were to head back, I'd give one of those a try."], ["Ben N.", "I love trying places like the Euro Grill & Cafe.I didn't know the first thing about Bosnian food going in, or any Balkan cuisine for that matter. \u00a0But I'm not sure the Euro Grill & Cafe broadened my knowledge to any significant degree because the menu actually features few purely Bosnian items. \u00a0Instead, it's sort of a catch-all cafe, offering schnitzels, burgers, gyros, and even a Philly Cheesesteak. \u00a0There is a focus on cevaps, though. \u00a0That item consists of excellent kofte-like sausages served on a roll or flatbread similar to focaccia, but softer and oilier, along with housemade sour cream, a flavorful roasted-veggie spread (mostly red bell peppers?), and diced onions as condiments. \u00a0Overall, delicious. \u00a0Served in combo plate with fries that weren't especially noteworthy but that made for a huge amount of food for nine bucks.There's also a sopska salad, which is much like a Greek salad but without the kalamata olives. \u00a0It comes in a huge serving that could probably satisfy a table of four as an accompaniment to other entrees.The business consists of a tiny cafe with just three or four tables, plus a small market selling mostly Eastern European items in the back. \u00a0The lone fella operating the cafe and store on a quiet Friday evening (we were the sole diners eating there, although several take-out orders went out during our stay) was very warm and welcoming."], ["D.

It makes me sad to see places like fast food chains or even my beloved Panera filled to max capacity but yet little mom and pop places like this remain empty. Do not be intimidated by the menu or the fact that it's not your typical American dishes, this food is approachable and tasty!I consulted yelp prior to my visit and knew I had to give the Cevapi a try. While they look like sausage links they certainly do not taste like sausage! If anything it is very similar to Gyro beef/lamp mixture in a link form. The bread it is served on is simply outstanding. This is served plain with onions & tomato or with two sauce options ajvar, which is kind of similar to blended roasted red peppers and/or kajmak which the server referred to as sour cream (and it tasted identically). Anyway, both taste great. If you want an average sized lunch (and very filling at that) go with the smaller version...trust me, it is plenty. We also decided to split the ground beef burek - it was good but didn't compare to the cevapi in my opinion. It was served with a side of pickled cabbage & carrots. Our server recommended putting the \"sour cream\" on it as well. We ended the meal with two cups of Turkish coffee. Well as it turns out I do not like Turkish coffee very much. I can't fault the restaurant for this at all...I am usually one who skips the sugar but doubles the cream - so this was too stout. I will say if you're a strong coffee lover Turkish coffee is a must. The atmosphere is quiet but seating inside is limited and a bit cramped. This is also connected to a Bosnian grocery store as well. The service is friendly -though distant, \u00a0but all in all I was fine with everything.It is VERY reasonably priced for lunch - everything I describe came to $14 and I left food on my plate at the end of my meal.

I got everything to go since I was late for work already, and the food took about 20 min. to prepare. A man, who I'm guessing was the owner, was there all by himself today cooking, waiting tables, bussing tables, and working the register at the market next door. After about 5 minutes of waiting, he brought me out a salad on the house for me to eat while I waited. This was unnecessary, but extremely nice of him and I devoured the delicious salad. Before I left, I asked him what kind of cheese he put in my salad and ended up buying two pounds of it! The cheese is Krinos brand, Bulgarian White Cheese and is very similar to feta, but milder and not as dry. Walking to my car I was positive of 3 things: I was going to burn the crap outa my fingers, I was going to spill on my work clothes before even getting to work, and I was going to start eating before taking pictures, I was ok with all of that!I ate most of the Zeljanica (Spinach pie) on the way to work and it was absolutely delicious! The pastry was flaky and crunchy on the outside and the dough had a bite to it on the inside. The spinach filling was delicious and reminded me of something my grandparents (French and Hungarian) used to make when I was little. I cut up some of the cheese I bought and ate it along with this spinach pie and I was in heaven. The Burek, or meat pie was just as good. I believe the actual pastry was the same, it was just filled with meat instead of spinach. It was delicious and I dressed it with a bright red vegetable sauce the guy gave me along with my food. If had some spicy mustard I definitely would've put some on the Burek, I think that would've complimented it really well.The last thing I tried was the Cevapi. It is a Bosnian flat bread that they split open like a pita. It had 5 skinless sausages in it, it's just ground beef which they shape into sausages, and it came with some raw onions on the side. The whole thing was great, but the bread was outa this world and now I think most sandwiches should be make with it! After a little research I found out it's called Lepinja, it's kind of like a fluffy pita/Ciabatta/Fry bread combination and it was delicious! I found a couple of recipes online but next time I'm in there I will ask if he sells the bread on its own so I can make all sorts of sandwiches with it!This place is great and the prices are very reasonable. Each of the pies was $4.50 and one would be enough for a lunch on its own.

The place is small but, even late at night, there was pretty good business. \u00a0The owner looked straight out of The Hobbit trilogies and wasn't super warm and fuzzy. \u00a0I think this place was too hyped up in my head after reading the glowing reviews. We had taken our food back to the hotel and unfortunately, the food did not live up to the hype. \u00a0I don't think anyone finished their meal. \u00a0I love me some spices but the entire meal was entirely too overly spiced. \u00a0It might have been due to the meat tasting a bit off...so maybe the heavy hand in spices was to offset that taste/fact? \u00a0I was especially excited about kibbeh being on the menu but instantly disappointed when I popped in the first bite. \u00a0Too bad I ordered a bunch of everyone. \u00a0We are huge fans of kafta but we could barely finish ours. \u00a0The kids even quit early and they loooooiiove kafta/kufta/kubideh.Overall, the portions were decent and the food ok if I hadn't had anything to compare it to. \u00a0Maybe this was just an off night since I'm sure the reviews are glowing for a reason."], ["Muath A.", "Great food and prices!

Both were very solid, but not better than what I can get at the Kabob Grill in Stonecrest. \u00a0However, the pricing at La Shish Kabob is much cheaper.

Amazing food!"], ["George R.", "Four stars +A year and over three dozen meals later I'm raising its rating. No, not everything is perfect, that doesn't happen anywhere but the food consistently more flavorful than it has right to be for a falafel joint - I suspect the owner is a foodie himself. Usually with Arabic food I'm not drawn to meat dishes primarily, La Shish being the exception. I really like the Adana kabob, the mixed grill with special rice is a meat eater delight, even the chicken shwarma made me go like Larry David : \"don't know what the Palestinian did with the chicken but it's out of this world!\" Well, no it's not but it's really really good. I recommend sharing a Foul Madamas appetizer, the taste always bring a smile to my face. I usually take home a container of their humus, priced like supermarket crap but so much better. \u00a0One thing: made without preservatives so you really want to eat within a few days. \u00a0The local Muslim community fully supports the restaurant \u00a0and it does a brisk business (Friday after prayer is a zoo in there!) but in spite of the many positive reviews I rarely if ever saw fellow gringos or gringas eating there. We've never felt anything less than 110% safe eating there ourselves, but I did hear otherwise from locals so I'll end with this caveat: For adventure tourists only ! Not recommended for the tour bus or all inclusive cruise crowd. \u00a08^P"], ["Red S.", "This little restaurant is a gem. The owner is a sweetheart and recognize me each time I come in.

The portions are large, so sharing is definitely an option (that is if you can pull yourself away from your yummy dish).The restaurant is cozy with a really friendly manager, he's very helpful and kind. I've been here a few times, and I think I finally have a favorite. Shwarma's are great, and the homemade hummus is something I could eat by the spoonful O_o !!! I love getting the 3 Kabob plate which comes with lamb, chicken, and kafta. KAFTA KAFTA, so so so yummy. I mean I pretty much ate all of that first, then the lamb, followed by whatever chicken I could fit into my belly. This is a good choice if you want to share or try a few different things.

My weekends are not complete until I have had at least one meal from La Shish... it's usually a Sunday afternoon takeout.Basmati rice so perfectly cooked, to go with the perfectly seasoned chicken kabobs (the lamb kabobs are good too, I'm just a bigger fan of the chicken ones) \u00a0Warm pita bread with fresh falafels, topped with hummus, fries and garlic dip on the side. It doesn't get any better than this. In my experience, the food has always been fresh and flavorful, and the portions are big! Really great value for your money.

Maybe I'm hungry at 11 cause I didn't get a chance to eat earlier & don't feel like a high fructose corn patty from MickeyD's or some other fried abortion swimming in grease. Too harsh, I love bar food and late night Chinese, but sometimes I need something else that's open late besides, fast food or a Denny's. Something I won't completely regret eating.Too much ranting about the inconsequential...again.La Shish is a hole in the wall Mom & Pop establishment. There's no pretension, no linens, no giggling strumpets on dates with tall doofuses, just solid Middle Eastern food at reasonable prices. The simplest things are always the best. They serve up well seasoned grilled lamb, chicken and beef kabobs. Their fries are a meh minus, but I feel like an infidel getting them here anyway. Then there's my favorite refrain for any restaurant: the food is not oily or greasy.As far as I know (which is not much), this could be the best shawarma and definitely the best tahini sauce in Charlotte. The \"shawarma wrap\" is not unlike the donner kebabs that are ubiquitous in many European countries that serve as their version of fast food, late night drunk munchie snack and hangover placebo. Fucking delicious. And definitely better tasting than fast food with REAL meat and REAL vegetables. I mean, they even cut the meat off of that big thing, you know, that big thing.Fairly vegetarian friendly; I like a good falafel every now and again & they have one.\"Okay my friend\" is what the owner behind the counter always says when your food is ready. This is a quickie joint, not a Michelin star place, so expect the service to be \"authentic\" as well."], ["Chelia S.", "The staff was rude and the falafels were stale.

Finally somehow I eventually made it to the counter, although there was never ever really any line or anything, where there was a guy behind it on the phone. He didn't greet me, but acknowledged me with a glare and I told him the order I placed. My second opportunity/cue to just leave...Nevertheless I paid and he placed my order on the counter without a word and walked away.

I had a chicken shwarma (?) sandwich that left me wanting more and needs something with a twang in it. Either a pickle or that plant that's pink that's found in Mediterranean food.

Both the chicken and steak were a bit tough but not to the point that it was bad per se. The falafels were really good which is why I'd prefer giving 3.5 stars but since that's not possible I'll round down. The hummus I didn't like... Not even a little bit and the pita bread was hard and not very fresh. The rice and veggies that came on the side were good but I would have liked more veggies!!
