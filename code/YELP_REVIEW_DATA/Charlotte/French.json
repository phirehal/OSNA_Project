{"The Capital Grille": [["Julie A.", "Myself and my wife are regulars for a reason. We have yet to be disappointed with both the quality of the service and food.Their food is only eclipsed by their staff. They have some of the best in Charlotte. We are almost always greeted by name when we walk in, and our favorite waiter George knows our order before we do. Their lunch prices are great. A bone in dry aged steak cooked to perfection in the 20$ range is well worth twice as much. Definitely go for a great lunch or dinner. Ask for George if he is available. You go in a customer and leave a friend with an incredible meal."], ["Jenelle K.", "\"I'm in the mood for a juicy steak!\" are words that I rarely utter but \u00a0my experience at Capital Grille literally had me eating my words. On this night, my friends and I took advantage of The Capital Grille's Charlotte Restaurant Week menu that consisted of three courses. For my starter, I went with the Wedge salad topped with applewood smoked bacon and blue cheese. The salad was simply delicious and dressed perfectly with the right amount of dressing. For the second course, I chose the porcini rubbed tenderloin. This is the part where I drool... that steak, man that steak! That piece of meat was prepared and seasoned to perfection; it was hands down the best steak that I've ever had! This marvelous piece of heaven was served with green beans and mashed potatoes. And now for the grand finale: chocolate espresso cake (close your mouth) lol. This dessert was simply marvelous. The coffee and chocolate complimented each other making each bite better than the last. The texture of the cake was a hybrid between a mousse and a cake...very creamy. I can't end this review \u00a0without mentioning the impeccable service. We were seated nearly 20 minutes later than our reservation, but upon being seated, we were greeted and served with a smile for the remainder of our dining experience. Eating my words never tasted so good!"], ["Dennis T.", "I went for lunch with some colleagues and had the tuna. It was a bit overcooked and clearly not fresh. The ball of rice was also okay. The green beans were steamed fine. My colleague's ribeye sandwich was apparently pretty good but why go here when youre not on business?"], ["Sheritta R.", "My husband and I ate at the capital grill tonight for the very first time it was outstanding. I started out with a capital cosmopolitan and he had the adult only Arnold Palmer, \u00a0then I had the lobster crab cakes it was to die for. For dinner I had the \u00a0porcini Rubbed Bone-In Ribeye with the grilled asparagus and the lobster mac and cheese OMG is all I can say, the steak was so tender and juicy, he had the Wagyu Cheeseburger with Fried Egg and Crisp Onions and truffle Parmesan fries. The serves was absolutely \u00a0wonderful \u00a0our waiter name was David he was always there he never missed a beat this whole experience was absolutely great. We had a ball for the food was GREAT!!!!!!"], ["Nikki W.", "I have to move this over to my 5-star club.Every experience I have here is just amazing. I love to sit at the bar. Paul is just a tremendous bartender and all around great guy. He takes such good care of us every time we come in for drinks or food.My must get app: the calamari. With the peppers, it doesn't need any kind of sauce. Holy.Item I'm currently obsessing over: the Chilled Seared Sushi Grade Tuna. I always get steak when I come here (I mean duh, why wouldn't you?), but I've recently become addicted to this. Absolutely delicious. I go with the bar menu version. Smaller portion than the entree. I pour the wasabi oil over all of it... then take alternate dipping pieces in the other two. Money.End every meal here with a shot of Sambucca. Trust me on that one."], ["Giannabrie F.", "Had a dinner date with my best friend here during restaurant week. \u00a0I've never been to Capital Grille so I was excited to try it out. \u00a0I have only heard good things so I can't say that I wasn't a little disappointed with a few things...I thought it would be safe to try a place like CG for Restaurant week because it is truly a chance to get more bang for your buck. \u00a0However, I am pretty sure everything switched once we said we were there for Queens Feast. \u00a0The server had been so polite and accomidating up until the point of our decision to order from the Queen's Feast. \u00a0After that moment I don't think we saw him the rest of the night, not even to bring us our food. \u00a0Seriously! \u00a0You may think I am kidding but I'm not!He brought us bread with literally only 2 small rolls in the basket. \u00a0We had bread envy because we could see all the other tables with with bountiful bread baskets! \u00a0We figured it was because there was only two of us but the other tables only had two people as well but they had way more! \u00a0Well, we ended up asking for more bread and he never brought it. \u00a0We asked the other gentleman that was supposed to be assisting with our table as well and he brought it about 15 minutes later. \u00a0Our glasses of water were empty the majority of our time there.We both ordered Filet Mignon which was very tasty. \u00a0It was warm, not hot when it came out but still very tender and nicely flavored. \u00a0We both ordered it medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. \u00a0Two sides came with our meal and I think they were supposed to be family style but they were really what you would see if they were served on an individual plate. \u00a0The mashed potatoes were sticky/gummy and lukewarm. \u00a0They were served in the smallest family style portion I have ever seen. \u00a0Unless it was a small family of ants, I would say we got screwed on the potatoes. \u00a0The string beans were cold and hard (undercooked) and inedible. \u00a0Didn't touch them.The desserts were decent. \u00a0The flourless chocolate cake was so rich it was unbearable. \u00a0It was the dark bitter chocolate flavor that just wasn't very good. \u00a0The small bite of cheesecake was good though. \u00a0Just....small.Overall, I would say this experience was subpar, especially for the reputation of the restaurant. \u00a0Why does service and quality AND quantity have to suffer because it is restaurant week? \u00a0They did all seem overly busy so I understand that everything isn't going to be perfect but we didn't even see our waiter the rest of the evening until he flung our check at us. \u00a0I guess I would say it was just overall disappointing. \u00a0The steak saved the day. \u00a0That was some darn good steak.Not in a hurry to come back....other competitors have won my heart."], ["Brittany K.", "I have been here twice now so I think I am able to give a good overview.

So shout out to him.Pros:Everyone is super friendly, accommodating, etc.PARMESAN TRUFFLE FRIESGreat wine by the glass selectionfast serviceSuper nice waitersroom for improvement:I ordered my steak Med Rare and it was most certainly rare. VERY rare. (I know some people don't know what Med Rare, or Med, etc really means, but I do.)Wedge salad= waste of money. Not really good, bulky to cut/eat.Overall, I will def come back, especially because it's super convenient for my client. I would expect a steak place to cook a steak to my requested temperature and if I had more time I would have probably sent it back to be cooked more."], ["Eric M.", "I took my family here for Charlotte's Restaurant Week the other night to celebrate my dad's birthday. There were 5 of us. Let me just say, it was incredible. I've done the Restaurant Week thing before on numerous occasions and, it's very easy to come across servers and restaurants that are focused on getting you in and out as quickly as possible. This was absolutely not the case here.Being that it was Restaurant Week, there was a set menu for us to choose from. Unfortunately, there was not a vegetarian option (my fiancee is vegetarian), however the server spoke with the chef and they were able to come up with an incredible vegetarian pasta that she loved. The server was very conscious to avoid any soups that had a meat broth as well. In addition, at no point were any of our water glasses ever empty, every interaction with the server was met with a smile, and what's more important, we never felt rushed. The server found out that it was my dad's birthday, and brought him a cheesecake with a candle for dessert (complementary). As for the food, I can say that this was without a doubt the best steak I've ever had. The filet was so tender and cooked perfectly! For some perspective, I've eaten at Ruth's Chris, Del Friscos, and several other high-end steakhouses in addition to working at a very high-end country club. Capital Grille blew all of them out of the water. I truly can't say enough about our experience. My dad said that it was the best birthday he'd had in a very long time, and attributed it to his experience at Capital Grille. If you are looking for a great place to eat, with great service, I can't recommend this place enough."], ["Koli D.", "We sat in the bar when we came I because we had just left a Hornets Game, didn't feel dressy enough the sit in the dinning area. But it was Delicious! Great wine selection, fabulous customer service and down to earth bar tenders, very accommodating."], ["Candyce B.", "This place was definitely worth the wait! I met some girlfriends for Restaurant Week. It's always super busy bit with our early evening reservations we didn't feel rushed through our meal at all. The service and wine selections were phenomenal. Our glasses were always full, we didn't ever have to ask for anything and \u00a0our waitress offered excellent wine pairing selections with our dinner. For my meal I ordered the Caesar salad, filet cooked medium well and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e cheesecake for dessert. The salad was just average. Nothing really special but the steak and cheesecake were absolutely fantastic. The steak was cooked perfectly and so tender!!! I enjoyed every single bite. And the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e topping in the cheesecake was a nice spin on such a classic dessert. I'd absolutely go again."], ["Joe P.", "For my money, there is no steakhouse as consistently outstanding as The Capital Grille. Whether I'm in Atlanta, D.C., or Charlotte, their steaks are always cooked to perfection, their service always world class, and their wine selection second-to-none.My wife and I recently dined at the Charlotte location during the Queen's Feast Restaurant Week, and for the absurdly low price of $30 a person, each enjoyed a delicious 8-oz filet, two sides and a dessert. As luck would have it, our local Restaurant Week happened to coincide with the Capital Grille's Generous Pour event, so we each enjoyed glasses of four different red wines for just $25 each. When the bill finally arrived, we couldn't believe what an incredible deal we just had!I could go on about why The Capital Grille is far and away my favorite restaurant, but you'll have to experience it yourself to understand. There's no better place to celebrate a special occasion, take a client for a business lunch, or just enjoy a fantastic steak."], ["Corey Tess T.", "Dropped in for lunch at an odd hour between lunch and dinner. The place was empty so we had the best server to ourselves and a great table.This is one of those places where even for lunch, you are going to drop a dime to eat or drink the awesomeness. I started with a cup of the clam chowder, then had the sliders along with the homemade grapefruit soda. YUM!The french onion soup is really good too. My friend had that.Everything was awesome. Normally this sort of place is too \"stuffy\" for my style - but I have to admit, the experience is always perfection. Our server brought us over a little amuse bouche' as well - the squash soup - so yummy - it tastes like the season."], ["Kevin S.", "Upscale but...My wife and I celebrated our 35th anniversary last night at The Capital Grille.The food was excellent. We had both the lobster crab cakes and shrimp cocktail for appetizers. Very delicious. Just the right spice and temperature. For our main course my wife had the salmon and I had the night's special steak. My wife enjoyed her salmon but did have to add salt which I found a bit unusual since she rarely does that. My steak was cooked to perfection and our sides of Sam's mashed potatoes and asparagus were also prepared to our liking.I can find nothing but great things to say about the quality of food.The only thing keeping me from giving me The Capital Grille five stars is the service. It struck us as being rude when we were at the reception station and the host told one of the wait staff to \"go sit these two\". Not really what I was expecting from a place such as this. Our waiter was \"Ok\". Nothing special. He was semi-attentive but as we were having our first sips of our after dinner drinks he brought us the check. Really? Do you want us to leave or do you want us to sit and spend some more money.? It was Halloween and its not like the place was slammed full. Call me picky but if I am dropping $250 for dinner then I would expect that the service equal my expectations.I do want to give The Capital Grille a big Thank You for going the extra step of setting up our table for our anniversary. My wife was thrilled. Thank you!"], ["Aleaha R.", "We visited during restaurant week and one thing to note is the service was outstanding. She was awesome, attentive, helpful and don't find service like this much. Overall the food was good. We got salads to start, nothing special what you would expect for a Caesar salad. The filet was good but could have been a little more tender. I find many steak restaurants have an issue cooking to med-well. It was good just not great. The side were really good, we got potatoes, beans and man & cheese. The mac & cheese is to die for...awesome!! Desserts were good, the chocolate flourless cake was great but super rich. Overall good experience."], ["Andrew A.", "Had never been to Charlotte, NC before or to this restaurant but all I have to say is Wow! \u00a0Amazing meal as I had the Filet Minon and it was one of the best meals I have ever eaten. \u00a0As and added bonus the waiter pointed out that the DT Suh from the Miami Dolphins was at the next table over and when he got done I went and asked for his autograph and he was very nice and gave it to me. \u00a0This place was incredible from the moment we walked in to the moment we left. \u00a0It is on the very expensive side but well worth every dime we paid. \u00a0I would recommend this place to anyone visiting who wants an upscale atmosphere and a great top notch dinner."], ["Apache T.", "Just to let everyone know the capital grille is doing a steak & salad special. They have three different options of salads and steaks to choose from. I got the spinach salad with fire roasted tomato and house mozzarella. I forgot was how my steak was prepared but I got it cooked medium. I paired it with a grapefruit buck cocktail because it was the lunch hour after all. One of the many reasons why I'll keep coming back is the older Caucasian lady that works there.

I personally really like my steak charred, so maybe I can be biased when it comes to reviewing their steaks. The lamb was a dissapointment to me completely. I did not enjoy how it was cooked, or how it was seasoned. I felt like the entrees were sub par. The Au gratin potatoes wer DELISH though. The Sam's mashed potatoes are probably the best mashed potatoes i've had at any steak house here."], ["David M.", "Don't always need reservations. Have walked in a few times without reservations.

Since it was late (almost ten) we opted for an entree only and no other accompaniments.I went with the Scallops and Mushroom Risotto and my friend had the Chilean Sea Bass. The Scallops were really good - and with five on the plate it was the perfect size entree. Some of the best scallops I have ever had. The Sea Bass was interesting, as it was served in a beef based mushroom consumme broth.That was a little different and would have been better in a bed of something else (like the risotto or maybe some spinach). \u00a0We will be back!"]], "Lumiere French Kitchen": [["David L.", "They have the most professional service in Charlotte and their food equals or exceeds the finest restaurants in Charlotte.

Nothing more to say except; there is a new sheriff in town and it's called Lumiere. Take your special person here and they will \u00a0know they are treasured by you.3/8/15 They recently added a Tuesday classic French special: for $25 dollars you get a glass of wine and the special entree. There is not a better deal in Charlotte. I have tried it three times and I would be there every week but my bathroom scale vetoed it.6/8/15 Last week I tried their wine tasting and it is a great deal at $15. You had a selection of four French wines, two white and two red all from Burgundy, plus they served the best \u00a0prosciutto I have had in Charlotte. Over the past year I have eaten there quite a bit and I never had anything but a wonderful meal. I would suggest to those reviewers that did not have an A+ experience that they give it another try. As to the price, this level of food in NYC would easily be triple the price; we are lucky to get such value in Charlotte."], ["Maxine S.", "Fabulous dinner.

The Spinach (Organic baby spinach, feta cheese, red onion and dried cranberries) and The Mission Bay (Garden greens, tomato, roasted corn & black bean salsa, sliced avocado). I order both of these with a vegan patty on top and the CREAMY CILANTRO LIME dressing... best dressing ever! My boyfriend is not a vegetarian like me, but doesn't eat as much meat as the average omnivore, he usually orders a veggie burger instead of a hamburger. But he's totally fallen in love with the quality of the Certified Angus Beef Burger here at Lebowski's.

My brother and I came upon this place hearing good things about it. I, wasn't hungry (surprised?) but my brother was so he got a meal and told me to order some appetizers. We ordered the mac n cheese and the buried treasure which was covered in beef, cheese, on top of waffle fries. They were delicious. The mac n cheese wasn't bad but the only problem I had was it was a little on the salty side. Though, I didn't have a good beer to wash it down so that's probably why it's a little salty. If you have some alcohol with that I bet it would taste awesome.The service. Not bad. When we went in there it was during late afternoon so it was sort of dead.

Well normally I would tell you to keep dreaming because no bar has all of things at once right? That's what I used to say before I went to JackBeagles!I first discovered this place a couple of years ago while hanging out in NoDa shortly after moving to Charlotte. \u00a0Since then I've been back several times. \u00a0The staff is always friendly, it's like they actually enjoy their jobs and want to be there. \u00a0I can't say that I've ever had a bad experience here with any of them over the years. \u00a0I was pleasantly surprised by how friendly the other patrons are and how inviting the atmosphere is at a whole. \u00a0One of the \u00a0few bars I've come to where you can really just sit down and feel free talk to anyone. Just about everyone seems to be having a good time enjoying their food/drinks and very social. \u00a0I've met all kinds of people here. \u00a0If you come during evening hours they usually have some good music playing in the background as well.But enough about the people, let's talk about the food. \u00a0First I have to get into the Mac n Cheese because this is the dish that's going to keep most coming back. \u00a0JackBeagles has hands down some of the best Mac n Cheese I've ever eaten (and I've eaten a lot of mac n cheese). \u00a0They have several different styles but if it's your first time then I recommend starting with the signature Jack's Mac. \u00a0Prepare to be blown away. \u00a0On your subsequent visits (because you'll probably come back), feel free to try the other flavors as they're all amazing. \u00a0My other favorite is the Mexi-Mac.If you need something more then you have to try one of their hot dogs. \u00a0Trust me all you need is 1. \u00a0These things pack a delicious wallop. \u00a0For the bravest souls I have to suggest the Buried Treasure Fries. \u00a0These aren't your traditional cheese fries. \u00a0Once you order them and see all the things topped onto them, you'll realize why they're called \"buried treasure\" fries. \u00a0 You might want to share these with your date as it's quite a bit for one person to handle.I can't recommend this place enough. \u00a0If you're only in Charlotte for a short amount of time and want to experience a good bar atmosphere and at the same time grab a delicious meal, head to JackBeagles. \u00a0Good thing I don't live in this part of town or else they'd have all my money haha."], ["Katherine C.", "The energy of this Charlotte restaurant makes you feel like you are in a city.

There is usually good music.The food- there is a solid breakfast/brunch crowd. It gets busy. The lunch/dinner menu is good. The hamburgers are juicy and cooked to order. The best thing is the Mac and cheese. There is a Mexi Mac type that is especially incredible. This place feels like a diner. It has a good, low key vibe.

Not only was it undercooked but it tasted mediocre. I could taste the runny eggs in the French toast. It was disgusting. I even told the waiter it was undercooked and he did nothing about it.

A big one for me is that they serve instant sweet tea, not brewed. Huge difference in flavor guys!! I love me a good glass of sweet tea with my meal. Also, when asked for my biscuit to eat my gravy with, it was literally hard as stone. No kidding. I showed it to the waitress, and she did bring out 2 fresh ones. But, it was a joke at our table.

Outside seating is covered and internet jukebox is ready to play. The bar set up is great, but if you're looking to sit at a table, outside is probably best. Inside deist have very many tables for groups.I took one star off because on the weekends at night it fills up with a lot of douchey (for lack of a better word) people. They have live music a lot on weekends, but 9.5 times out of ten, it's not very good. They do get lucky and get a good band every once in a while though. The best time to go is lunch or breakfast.

You can get a hot dog, with variety of toppings (I usually get mine grilled with sauerkraut and spicy mustard), for just $2.50, add a side, like fries or coleslaw, for $1. Best deal EVER! Beers on tap are local and are changed frequently. Addition: The macaroni and cheese is to die for.The music is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get. I've heard Prince, Smashing Pumpkins, TLC, it's all over, but usually themed for the night, i.e. the night I heard TLC was mid-late 90s hits. Sometimes it's 70s funk, or 80s rock.... Aaaand it's awesome. You get the picture. Our favorite bartender is Kristin or \"Bunny.\" She's attentive, efficient, and super sweet and pleasant. There isn't much seating, so if you're a group of 5 or more, good luck with grabbing a table inside. I think they have live music out back and more seating, but smoking's \u00a0allowed (it's outdoors).To sum it up: Jack Beagle's is a hipster dive bar, with good music, decent beer selection, and low prices.

Not only did I stand and wait 10 min until someone acknowledged me, I saw them give my to go order to someone else!

It was good and I ate it all, but reviews would have me believe it was the best in town. Definitely not the case. \u00a0Service was pleasant but very slow, especially for a quiet night.If I lived in the area I could see coming by here on a whim for a drink and a bite.

Still no word. Then 30 minutes.... Our waitress comes up to us and says she \"doesn't know what happened\" but it \"shouldn't be more than a few minutes.\" Now we are going on 45 minutes, all of the surrounding tables/bar stools have eaten and already left and have been reseated. Our waitress comes up again and gives a pretty insincere apology, saying to us \"it should be coming soon, but I don't know if you want to wait any longer or just leave.\" Since we waited so long, we figured we would give it a few more minutes. Yet another 10 minutes passed... So, hungry and frustrated and without a sincere apology or explanation, we walked out. Not proud of walking out, but an hour of waiting is inexcusable.

With so many beers on tap, I had no clue which to try first! So she let me sample some of her favorites and I found that the Kolsch was a winner!! It was light and refreshing and a perfect compliment to our appetizers. We ordered the Brewery chicken nachos and Southwest egg rolls, both were delicious! The nachos come with an entire dish of freshly made salsa and the they load you up on the toppings: cheese, sour cream,black beans, chicken, onions, jalape\u00f1os and guacamole. The egg rolls are deep fried and stuffed with chicken, beans, red peppers, zucchini, tomatoes, corn and pepper jack cheese! Yum. For dinner I went with the Southwest Turkey burger. The turkey burger is mixed with peppers and onions which adds a really nice flavor to the meat! They then top it with lettuce tomato, avocado mayo, fried peppers, sliced avocado and pepper jack cheese. I really enjoyed it! The fries weren't my favorite...they were shoe string cut and a bit too crunchy but at least they came out hot!

I came here with a friend who wanted some of their beer as well as their food. And sadly, I wasn't impressed. Inside though they completely changed the outlay of the dining area from the last time I came here, which was about 2 years ago... They added ramps as well as new things to look at and admire, such as the glass between booths and some paintings. But, overall it's all the same with the looks and what not.I had two things from the menu: Fish Tacos (RB Taco) and the Southwestern Chili.Now, the good first. Southwestern Chili. It was awesome, I felt like it was very good and chunky. However, I wish the portion was just a wee bit bigger just because it was so tasty!Another plus was the service. My friend ordered a steak and it was a little overcooked, the waiter completely understood and took it back to get another steak cooked medium rare. It was fast and I believe even the manager came up to fix the problem. They offered a soup or whatever, but my friend declined (I was wondering why he didn't get me another chili!)Now the bad. Eating the Fish Tacos was like grabbing a handful of seasoned salt and then eating it. Every single bite was just a burst of not just salt, but just sodium with a little heat kicked in, but that was probably from the amount of salt and it made it seem spicier. After drinking water, it was still stuck in my mouth. Kick back the salt Rock Bottom and pull out that flavor of the fish! After all, it is a fish taco.Overall, not bad, food is average. Service is pretty good though.

A.", "I cannot believe all of the rave reviews on this site, or Zebra's place on the shortlist of restaurants to visit in Charlotte. My experience there was incredibly disappointing. First off, when you walk in, you have the dark, tacky decor that's very dated and over-done. Huge wine list, of course, Napa big red focus, with many decent bottles around $40-$50, although the choices seem a bit standard to me; mostly big, predictable names. Their selections for by the glass were overpriced and disappointing ($8 glasses of Salmon Creek and Korbel?! Really?!). Then there's the food...I got two very small tenderloin sliders and pommes frites for $17 at lunch. The fries were decent, but came with standard ketchup (tasted like bottle ketchup, but came on its own plate with a spoon); at these prices, and for a French joint, I'd expect bearnaise or a good house-made mayo or aioli. The sliders were not good. Small, squishy bland white roll, a few strands of micro arugula (too few to provide any flavor or texture), and a hefty amount of a bland mayonnaise-y sauce. All squish; no crunch, texture, or discerning flavor, other than some pepper on the meat. That, with an $8 bottle of Pellegrino, and my check for lunch for one, with tip, was over $30. I'd say stay away, but I did only try lunch, not an entree, and only once, which is why I give two stars instead of one. Seeing the prices for dinner though, I think I'll stay away. The bottom of the menu advertised that they \"support\" local, sustainable, and organic sourcing, but no mention was made in the dish descriptions of which ingredients or how many, and no farm names, dairies, or advertised local sources.

Here's a brief summary of each visit.Visit #1 I had been given a Gift Certificate to use (thank goodness because I would have been ultra bummed to spend my own money this time!) and went with a girlfriend for brunch. First impression: It was cold. It was the dead of winter, ice outside and they sat us, in an empty restaurant, by the glass door. Bad form.Our waiter was a super chatty guy who kept nudging his way into our conversation. At one point I had asked my friend where Purdue is and before she could answer he, who had been sweeping around a table next to ours, chimed in. Strike two.Our breakfast came out and it was ok, not impressive though. The potato cake I got was most likely made the day before and reheated, the bacon was cold and they were out of all but one kind of bread for toast. The eggs were cooked nicely but the grits were too heavy. \u00a0Not terrible but also, not great.Take two (a few days later, actually):I went with my husband for our wedding anniversary lunch. It was nice, quiet but there were customers around and this time we sat in the main dining room where it was nice and warm. I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken with angel hair pasta and red pepper coulis. Oh. My. Gosh. I practically licked the plate. Seriously, it was that good. The chicken was perfectly cooked, moist, crunchy on the outside.. the pasta had a nice bite and was tossed in a lovely cream sauce and the pepper coulis was fresh and bright. I LOVED it. I tried my husband's dish, which I can't even remember now.. and it was good, but nothing like mine.For dessert I had creme brulee which was also lovely. By the time we finished eating I had forgotten it was our Anniversary and that I had disliked the breakfast I had there previously.Third: I went with a friend for dinner and it was just perfect. The room temperature was adequate, the wine was smooth, the filet was at the perfect temperature. It was a great meal. I think, perhaps, Zebra is a little pricey for it's quality but it's in a rich area so it's to be expected. Don't go unless you can afford to spend some real money. Make a reservation for dinner, for lunch it wouldn't be necessary unless it's the weekend. I don't recommend bringing kids there, but it would be good for groups. In fact, when we were there the first time there was a baby shower in the main room. I DO recommend this place.

We have tried the mussels with chorizo, the steak with pommes frites, their oysters and the crispy Brussels leaves with a fantastic balsamic drizzle. Everything has tasted so great each time we order it and for the fact that each dish is either $1, $5, or $7, it is a lot of food. The mussels are some of my favorite, it is a huge bowl of mussels with a great broth, tons of chorizo, and their bread is fantastic. The steak is enough for two to share, cooked well and with delicious pommes frites. If you only get one thing off my list, the crispy brussels leaves is where it is at. They are cooked perfectly and the balsamic drizzle is 'lick the plate' delicious. We actually got a second order because we each wanted our own, that's how good they were. The oyster deal is pretty great too considering their usual cost and they also have a few drink specials, though we usually just get wine. All in all, I really like GB for Happy Hour and have actually wanted to come for a full dinner (review to follow). \u00a0The service is always great near the bar, the food comes out quickly, and we leave happy.

The sauce on top comes off a little too sweet for our liking but that doesn't stop us from ordering 4 more plates. $12 bottomless mimosas, can't beat that. No complaints there. Services wise.. Not so great. We were seated by the host and then ignored for the next 10 minutes. None of the servers came by but they all seem to notice we were sitting there.

It's now our favorite French restaurant in Charlotte. We started off with some $1 oysters (happy hour special) and some Onion soup. The soup actually used the lion crocks that you see in Paris, and it had just the right amount of wine in the broth. It was among the best we've ever tried. My main course was a bison bourginon. I've never had braised bison, but this dish will make me want to make it at home. The meat was tender and flavorful. The pearl onions were caramelized, yet retained a soft and satisfying crunch. My only concern was that it was undersalted, but this was an easy fix with a twist of the salt grinder. My wife had the chicken, which is a half-bird cooked all-at-once (rather than partially cooked and reheated). It was juicy, well-seasoned, and served with mashed potatoes and a truffle sauce. \u00a0We skipped out on dessert because we had our fill. The ambiance was perfect, with cafe-style tables outside, a mid-20th century Parisian decor inside, and Yves Montand playing softly over the speakers.

Served with a bourbon glaze syrup. -- The Salmon & dill Benedict is an awesome meal if you're looking to switch up your typical brunch routine ... just the right amount of lemon & dill to make it fresh yet delicious.-- The house nachos are MUST for your appetizer selection. Topped with beer cheese, tender pulled pork, pico, BBQ sauce, and jalpenos ... YUM. -- The smoked bacon Cesar melt is a great sandwich, staked with a generously sized piece of tender chicken. -- if you're looking for a light meal, 100% recommend the blueberry walnut salad. For some extra umph, top it with a piece of nice seared salmon and don't look back."], ["Kristy A.", "Went here for another soccer game. Had the mahi mahi tacos. They were spicy and delectable. I wish the pieces of mango were bigger, but I was certainly satisfied with this choice. My soccer loving friends were disappointed in the lack of intensity from the crowd and believed others were not true soccer fans, but here for happy hour and just supporting USA. Apparently in real soccer fan bars, people are obnoxious and you have to stand up most of the time. I'll take this level of enthusiasm as it seemed people were into it.... Just didn't know all of the soccer chants or give the game their undivided attention. Additionally, there were mule drink specials for $5 and they weren't stingy with the booze.

But tonight a bouncer who said he needed to \"let the heat out\" by opening the front door, when it is freezing outside, causing everyone in the downstairs bar to be uncomfortable and miserable, was so incredibly rude and dismissive when multiple people complained. We all asked that the door be closed. He refused, saying people were complaining about the heat. Not true. No one, and we asked, complained about heat. The bar was a great temperature until the bouncer decided to prop the door open against everyone's wishes. We asked to speak to the manager and when the bouncer dismissed us again we met and spoke to his boss. This employee door shut for us.

I was craving Cracker Barrel (pancakes for the win!) but the ridiculous storm outside caused us to just stay at Draught. I got the Caesar melt (since they don't have wraps - boooooo!) with fries. Both were good but not great. My boyfriend got the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and greens. I tasted his and was not a fan. In conclusion, this place isn't the worst. It also isn't the best.

Well the first two entrees I selected were unavailable. \u00a0They were out of scallops and did not have a pasta dish. \u00a0My 3rd option was salmon with a hoison sauce. \u00a0The sauce overwhelmed the salmon so I would suggest cutting back on that.Still, I would like to come back here and give them another try.

Don't bother with the Hoisin-Glazed Scallops, there are several other yummy items on the menu (like the Pub Burger!) Overall the food, atmosphere and overall vibe are pretty awesome!

It has a lot of potential but missed the mark on several points. \u00a0Situated in the shadows of the Panthers stadium and offering a nice view of uptown from the patio, Draught caters to a lot of the uptown bankers after work as well as some of the locals.It appears to be an old textile mill with wooden floors and brick interiors and exteriors. \u00a0The menu advertises \"house made pasta\" made in someone else's house (Pasta and Provisions) however they were out of it. \u00a0My wife ordered a salmon burger but they were out of that. \u00a0She opted for a veggie burger instead and I got a regular burger. \u00a0It was decent but at $12 it was a little overpriced. \u00a0They have a decent amount of beers on tap, but not as much as I expected with a name like Draught. \u00a0Our waitress was okay but we had to ask for napkins. \u00a0My wife asked for may for her veggie burger since there was no sauce on it. \u00a0She waited a little bit for the mayo and then the waitress did not bring anything to use to put it on the bun. \u00a0I went to use the restroom and the men's room on the main floor was closed. \u00a0They directed me to one in the basement where there is another bar and more tables.Our experience would have been a lot better if not for the points mentioned above. \u00a0I have a feeling they never have the pasta, but when a place is out of the first two of three things you want to order, you have to wonder how the place is being operated. \u00a0If the management can't order the product that's on the menu, can they really operate the place well? \u00a0The waitress did give us a 20% off card to use next time. \u00a0We'll use it and hopefully I can come back and add a star to this review."], ["Kristen M.", "Feels like home!

That plan, however, was quickly derailed. After maybe about an hour, every TV was changed to \u00a0the Miami game. At first we thought it was a malfunction, because the picture quality was so terrible. In fact, we realized that they were actually streaming this game from someone's computer - you could even see a cursor hovering in the corner. We asked the waitress if she could get someone to change a couple of the TVs in the area to one of the other 6 games that were going on at the time. She agreed and hurried off, only to return with bad news. She advised us that the front half of the bar was designated for Miami and that the back half had other games on.... but there were no available seats in that area. To make matters worse, a group of rather obnoxious Miami fans were sat next to us. Part of the experience of going out for a football game is getting there early, staking out the best view in the house, and settling in for some beer and wings. What's the point of getting a table if they are going to change EVERY screen to a different game? Draught succeeded in alienating me and my friends.

The wait staff was able to slip in almost unnoticed to refill glasses and clear plates the whole night. We started the night with the Bentley's Oysters which were floated with Rose Champagne and topped with cr\u00e8me fresh and White Sturgeon caviar. These were the best oysters I have ever had. So decadent, so delicious! \u00a0For our main we decided on the Chateaubriand Bouquetiere, which was a wait but completely worth it! The tableside preparation was a great touch that added to the presentation of the meal. The sauce the server poured over the meat after he flamb\u00e9ed it was amazing.This is one of the few restaurants in Charlotte that maintains exceptional standards which enhance the special event experience of dining here. This restaurant has shot to the top of my list of splurge night out dining. PS the cocktails were reasonably priced, my Bentley's Martini (pineapple inflused vodka as the base) was only $12. For an opportunity to take in such an amazing view in a classy atmosphere I will probably be back for a cocktail fairly soon."], ["Abby L.", "This restaurant is beautiful. \u00a0It is a hidden gem that no one knows is up high in a gorgeous building. \u00a0I love to come here. I love the food and service. Always make me feel special."], ["Inchang Moses S.", "I am now convinced that this is the best restaurant for fine dining in Charlotte. The food, the decor, the ambience, the service all deserve thumbs up.We got to sit on the opposite side from where we sat last time. I loved the view over Charlotte including the Bank of America Corporate Center and the Hearst Tower on one end and the BB&T Ball Park at another corner. We actually got to see the game from our table. Yes, we think we got the best seat in the house. Early birds do catch the worm.The same person who waited on us last time was one of the three that night. They were all professional and knowledgeable. I always look for, not just manners and confidence, but intellect. Outstanding hall staff know when to interrupt and even make out what you murmur even if it's not clear - and get it right! At least two of the three were super last Saturday night. They recommended the tuna/crab/filet trio for appetizer, which was great, and always had my champagne glass full. But they never came over when we didn't need them after my wife told them that it was our anniversary.And the food - We had the tuna/crab/filet trio for starter, bourbon filet and shrimp for entree, and got the creme brulee on the house. All amazing. Even my wife, who's not a big steak fan, was awed by my bourbon filet mignon. Her shrimp was great as well. We also ordered a bottle of Moet Chandon after our cocktails were done. We loved it.I'm sure there are many more foodies and Yelp elites who have experience more restaurants in Charlotte than me; and I do not doubt that some will disagree. But I really vote for Bentley's as the best fine dining restaurant here in Charlotte after going around for 3 years now. It could be my preference. I do like places with a great view, excellent food, and it can't be too loud. The famous steakhouses here are mostly on the first floor, the other one on top of another building is too loud. Yeah, I like this place."], ["Michael L.", "You're gonna spend a bunch of money for the best view in Charlotte with excellent food and service. \u00a0It's really just that simple. \u00a0I'm guessing you're reading this review (and others) because you haven't been here yet. \u00a0If you're looking for the answer to a perfect date night, birthday, anniversary, business meeting or...

Others (eg veal) were not. Waitress was not. At over $700 for four we expected great to excellent in all aspects. Has the feel of a previously excellent place on the decline."], ["Judy R.", "3.5 stars. Caveat can be found in the food section below.I was here for a company group dinner last night and would have to say that I was a nice experience.Ambiance: being on the penthouse level of downtown Charlotte, this restaurant has (I think) a 360 degrees view of the city. Just magnificent and romantic.Service: along with the top prices you pay here, the services is TOP NOTCH, which I would say that I'm quite impressed with the wait staff. Just very professional and very polite which positively contributed to my overall experience.Food: \u00a0I would have given this restaurant 5 stars if I my meat would have been done right. Let's break it down:Apps: shrimp cocktail was fantastic. The shrimps were humongous and my colleague really liked them. I did not try them myself.Tuna carpaccio: I thought this was pretty good.Escargot: omg so delicious on the tiny toast! \u00a0Very nicely seasoned with garlic and herbs. I really have enjoyed this dish.Fried calamari: OOOMMMGGG! Best fried calamari EVER! You have not lived until you've tried this calamari! Well if you're a calamari person. I called this fried calamari steaks! Lol. Cut into thick slices and delicately breaded and seasoned, they were fried to a perfect consistency. The slices of sliced calamari were perfectly cooked, juicy and melt-in-your-mouth tender. Just absolutely amazing! the aioli was just phenomenal!Side salad: standard salad but the balsamic dressing was way to acidic for my taste.Entree:Bourbon filet mignon: I didn't eat this but my colleague told me that this was very good. Mixed grille: I was a little disappointed with this dish... The mixed grill included 3 different meats: lamb, bison, and filet. The lamb was fantastic! The filet was a little too salty and over cooked (medium instead of medium rare) and the bison hanger steak was cooked correctly but lacked flavor. I was surprised how lean the bison hanger steak was, and I thought it lacked flavor. The red wine reduction was too salty. \u00a0The bamboo rice was very good.Bananas fosters saves the day!For dessert, I shared a bananas foster with my colleague and we were all pining for more!!! It was a show and a desert because they prepared it table side and we can smell the caramelizing sugar while the waiter prepared it. I would have licked the bowl if I was alone! LolOverall, very good restaurant and had the prices to match it. However next time I will \u00a0order fish instead of the steaks."], ["James D.", "We were lukewarmly \"welcomed\" by an older lady with blonde hair. A smile would have been nice. I was a little surprised someone with such a cold manner would be allowed to be a hostess. The young girl with dark hair that appeared to be in training was a bit friendlier but it seemed the older lady was training her to not smile or greet guests warmly when they walk in. After that, everything went great, especially the awesome service from Ray. Ray's friendliness made up for the cold, aloof greeting. The food was spectacular. My friend raved about the steak. I would definitely return."], ["Dan B.", "In Charlotte with wife to meet our daughter who had to take the second part of a three part Optometry national board exam. After she completed the exam decided we needed to celebrate so I checked the reviews and off we went to Bentleys on 27. We arrived a little early so we had a cocktail in the bar. When your 27 floors up you can see for miles! After a short time we were seated. The dinning room is very nice. Elegant table setting, service was fast and consistent. Now I have to point out that we were the only table in the entire section. If possible request a table by the window. The view is great! My daughter ordered the filet and shrimp which looked wonderful, and it went well with her champagne. Wife had a salad from appetizer menu. Sorry but I don't recall what type it was but she did say it was delicious! I had the dover sole over vegetables with what tasted like a lemon sause and absolutely loved it! We all enjoyed the experience at Bentleys on 27 and would recommend it to friends and family should they find themselves in Charlotte. We are here for four mites and may go here for dinner again. It's a little pricey but very elegant with wonderful culinary fair!"], ["Victoria P.", "Both food and view were perfect ! Customer service was not bad but could've been better and a little more attentive. Seemed like our host was assisting a table beside us the whole time and would walk right past our table. We'll probably go back because the food was great and hopefully have better customer service. Would recommend to people but definitely not 5 stars in my book."], ["Matthew E.", "Attended a seat dinner with large event party. Set menu with a choice of 3 entries. The service was great, very classy. The food was also very goo. I had the salmon which was a hair overdone but considering we had a huge group you expect that. The sauce and side made up for it. Dessert was also very good, creme Brule. Good for groups, not sure what the regular restaurant has to offer."], ["Katie S.", "Hands down the best restaurant in Charlotte. The classic French cuisine, service, beautiful views and ambiance is impeccable - worth every penny. The atmosphere is relaxing and romantic, perfect for a special occasion.

The atmosphere was inviting and fancy. The service was top notch, everything you expect for a high end establishment like this. The french onion soup was good, salad was ok, the filet mignon was the star of the show. Super tender and flavorful, just an amazing cut of meat. The cheesecake was amazing as well. A great meal from beginning to end and you will pay a pretty penny for it, I dont usually eat at places this nice except on super special occasions or like this instance where my company took care of the tab."], ["Scott P.", "I took my wife here as a surprise for her birthday and we came away a little disenchanted. It began with a Reservation that was made online a little over a week before our dinner. After reading all of the reviews about the view, I requested a table by the window and that a bottle of her favorite wine be table side when we arrived. I received a confirmation in less than 5 mins.When we arrived, the hostess escorted us to our table. This would be my first disappointment of the evening. She put us in a table as far away from the windows as possible. I noticed this was the only empty table and to top it off the blinds were down ( they did open them as the sun began to set but we had to get up and walk over to the window to enjoy any part of the view) so I tried to hide my dissatisfaction and move on. There was also no bottle of wine waiting for us either, but they did bring it right after our waters were poured.We both ordered our meals and 2 of the window tables opened up. I walked up to the hostess and told her that we would like to move to one of the tables by the window that just opened up. She told me that she could not re-seat us as it was not fair to the other guests??? I told her that my reservation clearly asked to be seated there and she told me that there was no guarantee on where you would be seated. So, why wasn't this stated anywhere in the website or even mentioned in the confirmation? Why couldn't the hostess have told us when we arrived that the table I requested wasn't available and given us the option to wait or take what they had? I went back to my table and explained to my wife what was going on. She said that what appeared to be the Manager was making his rounds through the other tables and that I should talk to him. So I decided to wait until he got to us. In the meantime, now there were 4 tables unused by the window and it was quite obvious that they had no further reservations for the evening.As we waited for our food, we finished our glasses of wine, water and the piece of bread that was brought. Now, when you are paying $50 for a $9.99 bottle of wine, and over $50 per plate, I would expect to NEVER have to ask for more wine, water or bread, yet, that is exactly what I had to do. The wait staff was very attentive once we engaged them, but really? Why do we have to point out these things? This place prices itself to the extreme high on the fine dining map yet can't get the little things right.When the food arrived it actually looked good and was prepared perfectly. I had the Bentley Ribeye and my wife had the Mixed Grill. The food was quite enjoyable. For Dessert we ordered the Bananas Foster. This was prepared table side and it was delicious.We never saw the Manager (my guess is the Private Party they were attend to in the other room had his attention) so I could not voice my dissatisfaction with their seating policy and as we got up to leave and there was STILL 4 empty tables at the windows that no one was ever seated in, I became more angry then I was when we arrived. The view and the seating were the main reason that I chose this particular restaurant as well as giving my wife a great dining experience. The food was good but it didn't make up for the other things that this place lacked and the total disregard they had for regular people that come there to drop well over $200 on a meal AND an experience. Save your money - you get treated better, and spend less money at the Melting Pot, The Capital Grille, Ruth's Chris or probably any other place in the City. This is one place that we won't ever patronize again."], ["MJ M.", "Our company worked with the owners and staff at Bentley's on 27 to host a 100+ dinner event. From the very beginning (months before the dinner) to after the event, we received the top quality service.

Bentley's is very impressive! It wasn't crowded at all (we dined on a Monday evening around 6:30pm). The wait staff is very attentive & welcoming.We ordered drinks that were perfectly balanced and the kick came a little later. I had the Bently Martini (2) & my husband had a Pink Lemonade cocktail but I don't remember the name. Both delish!For an appetizer we started off with the crab cake. While small...it was mouth watering. I actually closed my eyes to savor the moment, ha! Definitely more crab than cake, seasoned & cooked to perfection. We both ordered the Filet Oscar served with whipped potatoes and asparagus. Beautiful presentation and so filling! We both were unable to finish oir entrees & I didn't have to eat a single thing else for the rest of the evening. After finishing up with our entrees then came the surprise surprise! For my birthday they brought out the most delicious Creme Brulee. I don't even like custards and puddings but THIS...wow! As stuffed as I was...I couldn't resist.Bentley's gave us a great 1st time experience with amazing views of Charlotte! Service was prompt, food was delicious & the setting was perfect! Definitely recommend."], ["Drew K.", "Absolutely delightful food!!! But the view is outstanding!!! Ask for a table near the windows when you make a reservation. The filet mignon for 2 is finished table side, definitely a great option for dates. The staff are amazing and Mr. Bentley is always around if you have a problem. One of my top favorites in Charlotte!!"], ["Jane A.", "Just okay. My family and I stopped here the Saturday after Thanksgiving for dinner on the way from Georgia back to New Jersey. It wasn't as crowded as we expected it to be on a Saturday night.The waiters were just okay. I found that one spoke too loud for the environment and interrupted conversation. The other continually put food and drinks down in front of the wrong people. The only plus was that the water glasses was always full.The drinks from the bar seemed fine. Everyone else at the table seemed to enjoy their food. My entire order was a strike out. Malbec by the glass was awful. French Onion soup was just okay. Nothing special. I then had the peppered steak with mashed potatoes and green beans. The steak was bland and fatty. The potatoes were bland and less than creamy. The green beans were well seasoned or marinated.My dad ordered the calamari for an appetizer. Warning: It can feed three to four people, which they fail to state on the menu or out loud when its ordered. The only redeeming quality to the calamari is that the pieces are huge and fresh. The restaurant was also out of tuna tartar. A crab cake was ordered, as well as the adult mac and cheese. The adult mac and cheese has truffle and lobster in it, but is way too rich for one person to finish by themselves. The crab cake comes over couscous in some sort of creamy pesto sauce which was okay, according to those who had it.The lamb chop is delicious, as is the bison steak. The bourbon filet is just okay, but if you're into bourbon then it may be right up your alley.I certainly will not be back based on my personal experience."], ["Nic Yongwan J.", "A-ok placeView n atmosphere is perfect but they can do better for there food...It is just ok food.....we order lamp n shrimp something....it is nothing amazing about it....even dessert was just bland.....possible out of bag...."], ["Maurice M.", "From the outstanding responsiveness of the staff to the wonderful dishes \u00a0prepared by the chef....

Perfect romantic sight with a great view."], ["Carol K.", "Great view. (insert sounds of crickets chirping here) But that's about it. Bentley's really didn't impress me the other night. When we got there- the hostess asked us to take a seat in the bar as our table wasn't ready. Okay. So we sit in the stylish bar in front of the fireplace and a woman comes over to take our drink order. At that point the hostess came and got us for the table and the server basically never got us our drinks. In most fine dining restaurants- once the drink order is taken, it doesn't matter if you drink them in the bar or the restaurant; they take them to where you are. But not the case here. So we never got that first drink. That was the first service mis step of the night. The rest of the service errors were due to the server who we had (or didn't have, as the case may be, as this guy was missing in action for most of our VERY long dinner). We were celebrating a birthday and had asked for a window table for this occasion. We were seated in the perfect table- right on the edge of the window looking out over downtown Charlotte. This was off to be a great night. Or so I thought. Our server came over with a couple of bottles of champagne to tempt us but we were in the wine and cocktail mood so we passed on the champagne. Maybe that was our mistake as this guy didn't come back to our table to get our drink order for at least 15 minutes. No drinks. No bread refresh. No fresh ground pepper (other tables had it) No service. Where is all this \"southern hospitality\" that my friends down here talk to me about? Not at Bentley's on this Thursday night, that's for sure. We placed our order. Too bad for me that they didn't have Grouper on this night although it was printed on the menu (my fav) but had instead substituted Mahi Mahi in for it. No thanks. I went with surf and turf with a filet and crab along with a salad to start. My friend ordered escargot to start and this same server tried to talk him out of it saying it would take 20 minutes to prepare. \" Hey!\", thought I. \"The man wants snails . . .give him snails!\" Don't try to talk him out of it. So the rest of our appetizers came up with the snails and were quite good. There might have been a pacing problem in the kitchen as our entrees then took forever to come out. And when they did, other than the sides coming out piece meal, the food was pretty good- although there was gravy over my filet when I had ordered it with Bearnaise sauce. Also-there were only 2 melted butters brought out to the table- when clearly 3 of us were having lobster or crab. At this point- our dinner was going on the 2.5 hour point and we were meeting others and had to go. However- we knew there was a special birthday dessert coming out but again . . .it was taking forever. When it finally came out, we had a forkful and then practically ran out of the door. Dinner for 4 ran about $400 which would have been reasonable for a fine dining restaurant, had we gotten a fine dining experience. An off night? I don't know. This server really blew it. And at that price? I am sure there are better choices in Charlotte."], ["Jason C.", "Great atmosphere. I highly recommend this place for lunch. The daily special is highly recommended, but if you're looking for a salad, the Chicken Caesar is great.

Their French Table service was outstanding, as with the Caesar's Salad done tableside.The Salmon I had was perfectly prepared with just the right amount of blistering on the outside and a tender flesh on the inside. The Crabcake Mama had was perfectly shaped considering what little filler they used and delicious as well.We ended with a Creme Brulee we shared and 4 chocolate Martinis which were delish and make me want one now.

We had stuffed shrimp and halibut dishes for our entree. Both of which were beautifully executed! Our wine selection was Far Niente (an excellent wine for those who don't care for overly buttery/ too-heavily-oaked Chardonnay). Instead of dessert, we opted to have Port and Cognac after dinner... ahh... the good life! However, as we were there for a birthday celebration, we did end up njoying a birthday sweet after all! Throughout the evening, our server was very attentive, entertaining, and was a true professional - which sadly, in this day & age is no longer a given (even at this level of restaurant).

My husband had the lamb and he really loved it.Price - Definitely a pricey place, but you get your money's worth for a $$$ restaurant. Place - Very cozy decor, home feel, but nice restaurant setting. In some areas, I feel it is a little too small or cramped (especially upstairs). \u00a0I saw people parked next door where it said do not park..Special - The waiter and staff was kind to personalize your birthday or anniversary on the dessert plate. It makes the occasion/dinner special! Service - Our waiter was nice and attentive. It did take awhile to get our check though.. But ah well. Although our experience at The Fig Tree was good. That's one checked off on places to go have dinner dates in Charlotte. I was just not blown away with the place and venue. I tend to prefer the more modern, upscale restaurant for that price. If you are more of a comfy and homey feel, this place is for you."], ["Katherine C.", "Sometimes you want a nicer meal. Fig Tree is one of my favorite choices in Charlotte.

I highly recommend going here."], ["Colby B.", "My fianc\u00e9 and I went to Fig Tree for dinner the night we got engaged, it was our first time. We have heard so many great things about the restaurant, I, glad we could finally go!We ordered the lobster hush puppies with a black bean pur\u00e9e for a starter, I had the filet and she had the lobster tail served over grouper and saffron risotto with a lobster blanc sauce - AHHHMAZING! We ordered a killer bottle of wine too. Our server was absolutely amazing, very personable but also gave us our space as it was a special night. I wish I could remember his name! We finished off our meal with the beignets, which were to die for!!!!! We can't wait to go back and indulge for our anniversary, this is the best restaurant in Charlotte in our books!"], ["Casey S.", "If it wasn't for the service I would give the food 3 stars. Not sure if I just had too high of expectations but like a previous reviewer said I thought the best part of the meal was my salad. I got the Elk and it was great to try something different. My issue is the sides cabbage and some weird lentil did not compliment the Elk at all. Would of loved some type of potatoes or risotto cake."], ["Kelly K.", "Great date night restaurant. I loved coming here and experiencing the full spectrum of their menu: wine, appetizers, meal and dessert. The atmosphere, service, and food all deserve 5 stars. If you are looking for nice restaurant to have dinner or special place to celebrate, make a reservation @ Fig Tree."], ["Shad C.", "The food is inspired. \u00a0I would give them a five star on food.The service and environment were less so for us.The waiter just seemed unengaged. \u00a0Normally you expect very friendly and engaged wait staff at a restaurant where it is easy to spend $60-100 a person.We went for our anniversary, it was noted on the reservation, we were put in a room close to the door with a very loud group of people. \u00a0None of the staff said a word about a special evening.The place is marked as being dressy and romantic. \u00a0A lot of people were there in jeans and polos even on a Saturday night.The food was wonderful and we will go back for it but I will not put it on my places to go for a special occasion.Definitely a place for foodies but not somewhere to have a romantic dinner or quiet conversation."], ["Christine S.", "Amazing food, \u00a0excellent service, and quiet atmosphere. One of our favorites so far in Charlotte! \u00a0Our waiter David was perfect and his recommendation of the chef special fish that night was spot on."], ["Robert P.", "We wanted to go somewhere special Saturday night and read good things about this place on Yelp. It is a charming old house and the staff is very attentive. They have patio seating available. \u00a0We really had \u00a0a great time. \u00a0My only criticism is the meals are a little pricey for what you get. \u00a0The salads were nothing special, I had pasta and my girlfriend had the duck. Her duck was delicious, \u00a0my pasta, good."], ["Ava K.", "Cute place with good food. We had the foie gras & escargots to start, which were delicious.

Highly recommend."], ["Brittany D.", "What a wonderful experience. I was brought here on my birthday and I couldn't be happier. Our server was phenomenal and because I have such a terrible memory, I believe it was Jay or Jason? He took us on the tour through the menu and truly made us feel welcomed and appreciated. The food was also excellent! We had duck and red snapper. Excellent excellent excellent! We will be back!"], ["Caroline K.", "The food was delicious and a great place for an intimate dinner with close friends. Nothing crazy mind glowingly delicious, but I highly recommend if you haven't been. Great for family or in-laws when they come to town."], ["Chrissy M.", "We went to Fig Tree for our anniversary. They did a wonderful job of making it special and pacing the meal so you can enjoy it thoroughly. We were impressed when our appetizer arrived and we were not quite ready to order our entree... The waitress took our menus out of the way so we could enjoy it and then brought them back when we were through. We sat outside on the porch which I highly recommend. It was a very warm day but cooled off (not a ton of sun) by about 7pm. If you plan to arrive by 6 on a week night it will be empty (we were literally the first people there). It gets busier later which adds to the ambience. The feel is quaint and romantic. Our waitress recommended the scallops which my husband ordered and I wish I had, too. I never order scallops and always worry they won't be filling but there were 7 medium sized scallops and they were delicious. The salad was wonderful, too fantastic dressing) and I highly recommend adding the goat cheese. I was pleased with my trout as well. Their wine list is extensive with bottles ranging from $30-$2000. We thoroughly enjoyed our bottle of Walt Blue Jay Pinot Noir.I would give it 5 stars if the feel was a little more up to date (it was a little outdated IMO) but overall our experience was very enjoyable and I would definitely go back."], ["Michael M.", "well prepared and delicious. We we're seated in essentially a private room upstairs. Great date spot."], ["Delon F.", "Not sure where to begin with this restaurant because everything about it was exceptional. The service, the ambiance and especially the food was five star quality. This is a special occasion restaurant for sure and you will not be disappointed when you dine here. My wife and I came here for our anniversary. We had the scallops to start and they were delicious. Even the garden salad was top notch. I highly recommend the veal chops, with shrimp and potatoes. The set up for this meal was perfect. My wife had the swordfish which was the special for the night and she thought it was divine. This is a beautiful restaurant in Charlotte and a must dine for anyone looking for a wonderful night out"], ["Kristin P.", "Great for a special occasion! Amazing wine list and deliciously crafted plates!! Must make a reservation and sitting on the patio is lovely. Restaurant is in a house-turned-restaurant, so it has a fancy but homey feel. I definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Charlotte!"], ["Carl S.", "So went back to Fig Tree this past weekend, and was inspired to write an update to my last review. We sat upstairs, which had a much better decor/ambiance, and the service was exceptional. The food was great (we had the escargot, lobster/halibut, filet, elk, and Ostrich Carpaccio), and they hit the nail on the head with the various flavors/sauces. We will be returning again for sure."], ["Joshua R.", "A cheese plate featuring 100% water buffalo cheese, elk chops, and the cayenne pepper triple chocolate cheese made for one of the best and most unique Charlotte meals I have ever had. My only criticism, however minor, is the music: \"It's Beginning to Look a lot like Christmas\" and \"Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer\" played on a loop can get absolutely maddening through the course of a one hour dinner service. That should not deter you though as The Fig Tree is now in my Charlotte Top 3."], ["Lemuria C.", "My friend took me for my birthday and we both thoroughly enjoyed it. We started with the yellow fin tuna as an appetizer. I had the lamb chops and he had the veal. The lamb was seasoned and cooked perfectly. They serve it with an Israeli Couscous that is delicious and a great accompaniment to the lamb. \u00a0Everything was delicious!! And I highly recommend the Beignets for dessert! I felt like I had been temporarily transported to N'awlins!!!The restaurant is in an old house, which gives the place lots of charm and character. They also have a nice wine list and the staff are very friendly and attentive. This is one of the best places in Charlotte to celebrate a special occasion. The ambiance, the food and the service are all excellent. It's one of my favorite dinning experiences in town."], ["Drew K.", "The food is absolutely excellent here. The service is some of the best in the city!! My only complaint is that the lighting is poor in some of the first floor rooms and the tables are a little close together. Ask for a table on the second floor."], ["Nabeel N.", "Great dining experience. I can see this place, with its outdoor patio seating, being a \u00a0very romantic dining spot. I however was with 4 other coworkers and had a great dinner. The octopus and cheese appetizer platters were delicious with a local NC cheese being featured. They did have an extensive wine selection - we ended up with a Pinot Noir (not my choice) to pair our main courses. The soup of the day was cauliflower and blue cheese, which was very yummy to the last drop. I ordered the lamb chops and it ended up being the only reason I gave this place 4 out of 5 stars. It was over cooked!The wait staff was excellent. Definitely a place to hit in Charlotte. Make sure to bring a date though ;)"], ["Todd G.", "Great place for a date night or diner party. \u00a0I've tried the elk chop and filet mignon. \u00a0Both are great."], ["Caroline R.", "Fine dining restaurant feel. My husband and I both ordered the veal. It was...pretty good. Out waiter was awful though. Took forever!!! Thought from the reviews that this place would be great but frankly, I probably won't return."], ["Kristin F.", "Finally, we're finding places in Charlotte we love. It's official- I love Fig Tree. It's very quaint (a cute house) and the service is top-notch. While they were very busy, it's organized as such where you don't feel you're in a crowded restaurant or too close to the other tables. Very intimate setting, little fireplace, lovely bar, beautiful stairway leading to the restrooms upstairs.Make a reservation- we did. We arrived early and were seated at promptly 8:45, our reservation time. Our server was very sweet and knowledgeable, explaining the menu and some of the signature dishes. The bread was divine and went perfectly with the escargot appetizer we ordered, accompanied with mushrooms and a gorgonzola/ garlic sauce. He encouraged us to dip our bread in the sauce, which we did- and oh boy. Heaven in your mouth.I ordered the ahi special (he said it was one of the finest cuts he had seen in a very, very long time) and it was also delicious. It came with a risotto and everything was cooked to perfection.I really love The Fig Tree and am excited to find such a charming spot in Charlotte."], ["Lucinda L.", "As a native Charlottean, I have no idea how I've never been to The Fig Tree. Now that I'm an \"Elizabethan\" I made it a priority to visit. I am impressed. The house is so interesting. I love the bar. The service was first class. The environment is intimate if you want it to be. \u00a0All the food was as described on the menu, good quality-lots of flavor. I will absolutely return to The Fig Tree."], ["Jill C.", "Fig Tree was fabulous. \u00a0I had the house salad, lobster and grouper. \u00a0My husband had the filet. \u00a0The wine recommendations were wonderful and I can't say enough about the pear martini! \u00a0The portions were substantial and the service, excellent. \u00a0The only thing that I would change, is to have some restrooms downstairs, so we can bring our elderly parents for a wonderful, modern and amazing dinner."], ["Paul C.", "Went here for our 11th Wedding Anniversary, and found the house to be very cozy and elegant. I thought I was underdressed in slacks and a Polo shirt until some guys showed up with Jeans by the bar area.Anyway, the food. Started off with a mixed cheese platter, which had a nice selection from Blue, aged sheep, Goat and cream with candied walnuts. Went very well with the nice rosemary bread they served.For appetizers, I had the soup special which was a dark meat roasted chicken and bean soup. Very earthy and flavorful. My wife had the simple garden salad, with spinach and shaved parmesan reggiano. My wife had the NY Strip special, with crab meat and a creamy horseradish. Cooked perfectly and tender. I had the Veal Chop, which was AWESOME! The quality of this meat was very top notch. I mean, when you can snarf down the FAT on a chop you KNOW IT'S GOOD! Melt in your mouth. I even exhibited heathen behavior by gnawing on the Veal Chop Bone....it was that good. Hey they didn't kick me out so there! :-)For dessert we had their famous beignets. They served a generous portion of 4 of these succulent pillows of flavor, coated with Madagascar Cinnamon sugar and some creme anglaise, and some coffee gelato. Very heavenly!Oh, and although I brought in a special bottle of wine from my personal cellar ($20 corkage fee), they do have an excellent wine list, and as others have noted, pretty reasonably priced for the most part. We started off with a Brut French Champagne which was only $7/glass. Not bad for a real FRENCH Champagne.Service was excellent, food was served hot, they were attentive without being annoying. So all in all, this is a top notch place!"], ["Justin M.", "What a food experience! \u00a0\"I feel bad for whoever didn't order the Elk\" is what my wife said after her first few bites. \u00a0Overall, it was a great experience from the wait staff, the hostesses, the apps to the desserts --- I use my NJ/NY pallet experiences as a benchmark and this Charlotte dining experience is in my top #5! \u00a0Our dishes:Raw Oysters- different twist, but good (caveat - we're used to traditional cocktail sauce and fresh horseradish)Carpaccio- deliciously excellent!Octopus- very good; the addition of olives produced a higher salt content than I would have liked, but the various other textures made it very tasty and enjoyableElk Chop- ***** 5 STARS!! My first elk experience and it was fantastic. \u00a0The compilation of a flavors including a mustard glaze, marinated shredded cabbage, and horseradish infused gnocchi-esque creation was to die for... Seriously, last meal worthy!Beignets- These just put us in the euphoric state of \"life's worth the stresses as long as we can afford to eat like this\" mood ;)Sugar, fried dough, coffee ice cream over aBed of cinnamon and a lovely dipping sauce. \u00a0Topped it off with a French pressed coffee and 10-yr Tawny port.The End.To the Chef/Owner: Bravo!Pros- everything above plus a friendly server, Jennifer, that made it that much better.Cons- ......"], ["Leslie T.", "The food, wine and service are top-notch.You cannot go wrong at The Fig Tree. \u00a0It is pricey, but one of those places where the service, food and wine list deserve it. \u00a0Great for a romantic evening or dinner with friends. \u00a0Or even a stop for a glass of wine on the way home. \u00a0Life is short, get the cheese plate..."], ["Melissa D.", "This restaurant is absolutely amazing!! Both the food and the ambience were A++. Immediately after we left I told my husband this was where I wanted to go for our next special occasion. I had lamb chops which were amazing. I tried the dishes the other three people in our party ordered and they were amazing as well! LOVE IT!! Sooo excited to go back!"], ["Curtis S.", "We were sitting at home last week trying to figure out where in the world we could celebrate our 200th Queen City Restaurant Review when all of the sudden... The Fig Tree Restaurant popped into our heads. The Fig Tree has been on our must-hit list for a very long time and an obvious pick for our 200th review.The Fig Tree is located in a 1913 bungalow in Charlotte's Elizabeth neighborhood just minutes from our house. I made reservations online a week prior and left a note requesting our table be somewhere in the house with decent lighting. When we arrived we were seated quickly and at a table at the front of the house with amazing natural light just as the sun was setting.We kicked off the night with a Fig tart with taleggio and prosciutto over a red wine reduction. \u00a0It seemed largely inappropriate to order any appetizer not featuring figs while at the Fig Tree Restaurant and without a doubt it was the right decision. The deliciously flaky crust was obviously home made and came topped with a melty and salty cheese that balanced out perfectly with the sweet figs. The red wine reduction added a a great touch of sweetness and fruity tannins to compliment the figs.The Sweet corn chowder with prosciutto come out next and despite being delicious... may have been a little underwhelming also. For the most part it just tasted like a big bowl of fancy cream corn. Im definitely not a chowder expert but if I could offer one suggestion it would be to add some herb crusted roasted potato cubes.I (Ella) got the Grilled New Zealand Elk Chop over smashed finger link potatoes with Smoked Bacon-Braised Purple Cabbage and Boursin Dijon Sauce. It doesn't happen often but I was really excited to see something on a menu that I have never had before. I was expecting it to be gamey kind of like a bigger version of venison, but I was pleasantly surprised by its subtle flavor and tender texture. The dish originally came \u00a0with a horseradish spaetzle which went well with the other side items, but I don't particularly like horseradish so I went with the mashed potatoes instead. The mashed potatoes matched nicely with the smokey cabbage and delicious dijon sauce. I really enjoyed everything about this dish and cant wait to try elk again.I (Curtis) got the Grilled Filet Mignon topped with Stilton Cheese and Mushroom Duxelles over a Sweet Corn Polenta Cake with a Veal Demi-Glace and a side of Asparagus. Filet Mignon always leaves me wanting more... more flavor, more meat, more anything. The Stilton cheese was delicious but was countered by the lack luster and not-so-sweet corn polenta cake. The high points to the filet mignon were the euphoric aroma, the plate composition, and the filet was cooked to a perfect medium rare.I (Ella) was very impressed with the dessert menu at Fig Tree. As a pastry chef myself, I get really bored with the same old dessert options that I see on every dessert menu. Luckily for me the desserts on this menu were complex and full of interesting flavors and garnishes. The Dark Chocolate Mousse and Chocolate Glacage over Coffee Cr\u00e9meux and Almond Shortbread with Coffee Gelato caught my eye for dessert. The chocolate mousse was deliciously light with a dark chocolate bitterness that matched perfectly with the coffee flavors in the cremeux and the gelato. The almonds added a much needed crunch to a very soft dish and the pulled sugar garnish seemed like a halo topping a perfect dessert.Despite some light redicule from my pastry chef partner... I (Curtis) went with the only classic on the menu, the S'mores Cheesecake. Unknown to me the S'mores cheesecake was nothing like the original classic I have come to love over the years, it was way better! It was smaller than normal but the small size packed a very large flavor. The graham cracker base came topped with a very dense cheesecake cube, a micro pond of dark chocolate, several hand made torched marshmallows, and a very adorable chocolate swirly thing. The whole dessert was amazing and a must have for anyone visiting the Fig Tree.The Fig Tree Restaurant lived up to our expectations and despite not falling in love with the Filet Mignon we cant wait to go back. The app was delicious, the entrees were unique, and the desserts were more than memorable."], ["Paul P.", "Great restaurant with an awesome wine list that's reasonably priced. \u00a0VERY friendly service with delicious food. \u00a0I had the Foie Gras, Caesar salad (perfect portion), Elk and a cheese plate. \u00a0Every course was awesome and was perfectly paired with a delicious bottle of Nickel & Nickel cab. \u00a0Did I mention they have an extensive wine list (not so big for Italian)?Will definitely go back when in Charlotte and will most likely have the same exact meal (but the lamb, veal and Rib eye were on my target list too)."], ["Lily W.", "Tonight is our 3rd year anniversary and the atmosphere was prefect for our occasion. \u00a0The food and service was awesome! \u00a0We ordered escargot and fois gras for appetizer, the fois gras was fantastic! \u00a0We ordered the elk chop and veal chop! \u00a0The veal chop was tender and the elk chop presentation could have been better! \u00a0This place is definitely a romantic place and very pricey!"], ["Mark D.", "Food is complex, unpretentious and beautifully executed. \u00a0Ambiance is warm and relaxing. \u00a0Wine list is deep and has tremendous values - they do not mark up prices the same as most restaurants. \u00a0Service is seamless. \u00a0Cannot recommend this place enough!"], ["Reid A.", "I love the uniqueness, yet classic approach to this restaurant. \u00a0It is set in a beautiful, historic house. \u00a0It is a great place for a date. \u00a0The dishes were approachable, without feeling pretentious. \u00a0The foie gras I had was my first experience and it was awesome. \u00a0We had great service - all around, one of the best restaurants in Charlotte."], ["Stephanie T.", "I \"like\" a lot of places, but there are few that I love. \u00a0I am happy to say that The Fig Tree is one restaurant that I love!Yes, it's pricy, but worth it for a special occasion. \u00a0The food is superior to anything else I've had in Charlotte. \u00a0It's not gimmicky or trendy, it's straight forward delicious cuisine with a touch of flair!I did a blog post about my NYE meal which you can read here: theladyolive.com/2014/01\u2026It had been a couple of years since I was lucky enough to be wined and dined at The Fig Tree and I was so excited!

The roasted garlic puree that came with the bread was delicious as well. The house salad had a beautiful presentation and a simple herb vinaigrette. \u00a0Our waiter Devon made the experience even richer, as if that was possible. \u00a0He knew everything about every dish and the wines they served.

We were lucky enough to beat most of the crowd and immediately started off with the beignets. Light, flaky, warm - perfect snack as I debate the many options on the menu. I ended up going with the short rib sandwich - the nasty weather left me wanting something warm and rich. This sandwich delivered; tender short rib bathing in provolone alongside saut\u00e9d mushrooms and onions with a garlic aioli, topped with arugula to cut through some of that richness. Others at my table ordered the tuna melt, chicken salad, and BLT. All received top compliments. \u00a0Service exceeded my expectations, especially for the lunch hours. Our server knew the menu down to each ingredient and made great recommendations. I am looking forward to trying the rest of the menu."], ["Faith D.", "One of my greatest joys in life is eating and trying new restaurants. I'm not sure why it took me so long to get to Cafe Monte, but I finally did and stopped here twice in one week. It's a great atmosphere for Sunday brunch (off the menu) or to meet a colleague over coffee in South Park. The environment is nice, the service is attentive and friendly, and the coffee and food is great! The decor is very French and adorable. Although many people are dressed well because of the neighborhood it's in, I also saw couples that were out for their morning walk or stroll around the neighborhood stop in wearing more casual wear; a place to stop in no matter what you are wearing.They have a cute, casual bar area to grab coffee and a croissant, little cafe tables outside, or a large dining area with booth seating lining the walls or full tables. Great for small and large parties alike. I ordered the Benedict Monte and it was very good. I could only eat half due to its richness in flavor, but that is French food for you. Unless you like that much rich taste, I would recommend ordering a couple items and sharing with your partner to give your taste buds a bit of variety."], ["Vanessa E.", "We were gifted a groupon to Cafe Monte. Ambiance was ideal, no strident music or harsh lighting. Bakery case promised future delights.Grateful for a concise menu, hate to read a book to choose my meal.The warm baguette with butter was so delicious it did not last on the table. Waiter graciously offered another one.Chose beef bourguinon, meat was seasoned well and so tender, only needed a fork to enjoy. Au jus was beefy and could have used some extra bread to 'sop up'. Baby onions were sweet and mushrooms were finely sliced. \u00a0Winning dish!!!!My dining companion \u00a0chose the roast chicken. Sadly, the herb seasoning did not infuse the meat. Without a sauce, there was nothing to say.Macarons were nuggets of artistry. Enjoyed tremendously. Minus one star since service was polite but we felt 'tolerated', \u00a0there was no attempt at engaging in conversation or inquiry about special ocassion. Another table merited a long and involved conversation. A lovely place to enjoy when you tire of the chain restaurant scene."], ["Hania A.", "The croissant and omelet were amazing! \u00a0I got the smoked salmon, crab, lobster, tomato, and chives omelet with egg whites and it was very fresh and delicious. \u00a0It comes with a choice of bread (I got a croissant...best choice!), fruit, and potatoes. \u00a0My husband got the French toast, which I might get that next time because it was so good. \u00a0Coffee is awesome too. \u00a0I think we will definitely be back soon!"], ["Hashani S.", "2.5 \u00a0stars We came here for lunch one day after purchasing their LivingSocial deal. Cafe Monte is a cute little eatery with yummy sweet treats and some pretty serious savory eats. It was pretty packed for a weekday. I love how they have incorporated smoked salmon into multiple dishes, yum! We sat down right away, I already knew I wanted the lobster crepes or the salmon Benedict. I ended up going with the lobster while the bf ordered the pepper and sausage pizza. The server was a little pushy on trying to get us to purchase drinks, sides and dessert. She wasn't really my cup of tea as it was very obvious she wasn't interested in LivingSocial customers. Our food took a while to bring out and it was so hard to wait, we were starving. Finally we got our food, my boyfriend thought the pizza looked really weird with the peppers and sausage bunched in the middle instead of evenly distributed throughout. There was also no sauce! Me no likey. My crepes tasted really good but I was not particularly happy about the little bits of lobster shell hidden in my dish. I had to be careful not to crack a crown on a potential piece of shell. I ate my meal since I figured I would have to wait an eternity to get a new dish but had let the waitress know. She wasn't too apologetic nor did she try to find a solution to my problem. I told her to let the chef know to be more careful preparing the shelled seafood from now on. Hopefully my next experience is better. Beware of the lobster crepes!"], ["Bianka M.", "We' We' Cafe Monte'This place is amazing from the service to the ambiance to the food. The only reason I didn't provide them with 5stars is because it's ridiculous to charge $5 for a scoop of ice cream to accommodate a dish that is served hot and typically with ice cream in the perfect world (bread pudding).We visited Cafe Monte for the first time during Queens Fest after riding past on a regular while visiting Whole Food. We were impressed with the staff upon arriving for our reservation and how nice they were and how quickly we were seated even though we were early.The 3 course meal plus a glass of wine went as follows:Salads: I had a tasty arugula salad with grilled peaches atop and my husband had a duck salad that he devoured Main course: I had the scallop risotto and my hubby had the sword fish both were extremely tasty. Dessert: we both had the bread pudding which was amazing and even better with the ice cream that cost $5 for one scoop to share (Really).The wine was tasty as well we were given the house Pinot Grigio and Pinot Noir .Overall we will give them another try and not order ice cream unless it's included with the dessert (-;"], ["Lisa C.", "Enter this bustling corner restaurant decorated in the theme of a French bistro and you will immediately be greeted by the lively music and friendly staff. If you are dining on a weekend you will most likely also be greeted a rather noisy establishment. The ambiance is usually mellow during the week if you are looking for a casual atmosphere. If you are ordering wine I strongly recommend the La Posta Malbec. Why strongly? I don't like Malbec and my boyfriend doesn't like Malbec but one sip of my sister's glass was enough for us both to order our own glass. Ever since the first time we ordered the four cheese fondue we decided to keep it as a staple item for our visits. The cheese has a delicious sharp undertone and the fondue is full of more cheese than will be absorbed by the bread they bring with it. They never seem to bring enough bread with it but we save the tableside bread they bring with dinner service to gluttonously leave no bite of cheese behind.My previous favorite was the seared scallops over mushroom risotto but has since been replaced by the Beef Short Rib Bourguignonne which was phenomenal with a hearty cut of beef so tender no knife was needed. I will definitely be ordering this again!This restaurant was close to a 5 star review but unfortunately on our last visit the beignets that I had absolutely raved over during a brunch visit came out as a burnt dessert. Hopefully on our next visit I will be able to update my review after a perfect dinner service."], ["Candyce B.", "Tres Bien! Hopefully that's right....I'm brushing off my high school French classes....so forgive me in advance. I'd had this place on my radar for a while. And since I finally had a few days off I decided to give them a try. I'm sooooo glad I did! The atmosphere is adorable. I loved the decorations and flowers on the tables, it truly makes you feel a bit fancy. I stopped in for lunch and started with a bellini. That thing was delightful. It packed just the right amount of flavor and liquor and I could have helped myself to a few more. For my meal I went with a classic the croque-monsiuer. It's basically a ham and cheese sandwich on steroids....because it's got so much extra goodness! \u00a0There's crispy bread, it's stuffed with ham and cheese and then topped and baked with guyere cheese on top....OMG....seriously I can't tell you how good this sandwich was. I enjoyed every bite! It comes with a side of fries, they weren't my personal favorite a little too \"crispy\" (burnt) but if cooked a little less they'd probably have tasted a little better. But they certainly didn't take anything away from how tasty that damn sandwich was! I figured why not go all the way out and splurge on dessert....so I ordered the beignets. And I did not regret my decision at all. They were by far some of the best I've ever had. My goodness. Basically it was hot sugary goodness in a basket....trust me you will want to give these a try. They are absolutely worth it. I'm ready to go back, I want to try their brunch and other sandwiches and entrees....and I will make it a point to get the beignets EVERY time I'm here."], ["D.J. K.", "This is such a cute brunch spot! I was craving some french toast and Cafe Monte was the closest place with decent ratings. I of course got the brioche french toast with a side of bacon. The french toast itself had 4 very huge and fluffy slices of brioche bread. It was airy and buttery and toasted just enough to get the crust hard, but soft in the middle. Very good for a simple french toast. I also got their coffee and it was delicious. It was a bit strong black, but with a little bit of milk it was perfect. I've noticed most of the customers are older ladies and I think the ambiance caters to that. Would love to come back and try an actual french dish."], ["Bruce K.", "First time here with both my wife *and* my daughter.

No fault there.We started off with a plate of beignets, which had the required heavy dusting of powdered sugar and also a small pot of strawberry jam for dipping/scraping. Very hot and very tasty. A nice starter while you look over the menu.For mains, we each went with omelets or the crabcake benedict. Each was a good portion with plenty of filling and lots of hollandaise on the benedict. The hashbrown potato casserole was very yummt and the omelets also came with a small bowl of fresh fruit - blackberries and blueberries and such. Nice.Very good coffee. Cappuccino was very good.Service was good, ambiance was great and the food was very good.We'll be back to Cafe Monte for sure."], ["Kay F.", "Cafe Monte did not disappoint!!!! \u00a0I bought a couple of $15 Groupons for breakfast and decided to give them a try. \u00a0This is a gem of a restaurant on Fairview. \u00a0Forget the Groupons - I will be back monthly for this delectable treat.

There was no extra conversation, or small talk. He just brought us drinks, food, and the check! I can't really complain about that, it's all servers really need to do, but a little talking and personality would be nice!Overall, great food and atmosphere!

Cafe Monte has been on my list of brunch spots for a while and I was really looking forward to a nice meal.My fianc\u00e9 arrived a little after 10 am on a Sunday. We were fully prepared to have to wait for a table so we put our name in and were told it would be about 20 to 25 minutes. We were offered a spot at the smaller bar/ railing where we could order but it was so tight it didn't seem like a comfortable place to eat so we agreed to just have coffee there. About 15 minutes later we had yet to be served or even approached by a server. Spots opened up at the main bar so we moved there with the hope of finally getting some coffee. Service was still quite slow and many others were served before us. We were holding out for our table so we only ordered coffee and refills were few and far between.After about 45 minutes of waiting for a table we were too hungry to wait anymore and decided to put in our order at the bar. Over an hour after we arrived we were told our table was finally ready but elected to stay at the bar. We ordered the monte Benedict and the fruit de Mar omelet. We were both very disappointed with the lack of flavor and seemingly poor quality of the ingredients. My fianc\u00e9 stated that his omelet could have come from Denny's. The potato cakes on the side of each dish lacked flavor and the hollandaise sauce on the Benedict was flavorless and arrived to me already congealed.

The main issue I've been constantly having is that they over-poach their eggs; the yolk is not runny whatsoever- it'll be of a gelatinous state. Even when I've requested that they be undercooked they'll still come out overdone. Also, their hollandaise sauce has started lacking the vibrant flavor it used to have; now it's close to being bland. The newest issue I experienced today is that they no longer serve a nice, thick slice of Canadian bacon on it... instead they have replaced it with two paper-thin slices of deli-style ham (per side). For around $14 I expect the better quality that they used to serve, not the poor excuse of an Eggs Bene they are now trying to pass off."], ["Mark O.", "Great Ambience! Great good.

One in our party ordered the Osso Buco which was tough and chewy instead of the expected fall-off-the-bone tender. To the management's credit, the bad dish was taken away and a different entree was offered. Neither appeared on the bill. Alas, the replacement dish (Veal Saltimbocca) was rather tasteless and one of the two pieces of veal was raw in the center. We guessed that the meat was frozen and, in the rush to get the replacement out, wasn't cooked properly.The Duck Confit was overcooked, but the flavor was excellent. \u00a0The fish was well cooked but the dish was under-seasoned and bland.

Made a reservation 3-4 months ahead of time for Valentine's Day. Called about a month later to confirm the reservation. Confirmed. No issues. Called February 10 again to confirm. No reservation. Wait, what now? Apparently our reservation had been lost. At this point every restaurant worth going to is full so it's too late to get an alternate reservation.When I was finally able to get in touch with the management (after 3 phone calls and 1 email) I was told that they were sorry, but there was nothing they could do. I was also told that \"several other people\" had called with this same issue. No attempt was made to reconcile the situation. Not squeezing us in that night, not even such a small gesture as a complimentary app should we choose to come another night. A heartfelt apology wasn't even issued. It was literally the words, \"Sorry, there's nothing I can do.\"At this point I was frustrated. I asked what the gentleman's name was and for his position at the restaurant. \"Why?\" he asked. I told him I wanted to speak with his superior. He answered, \"I am the superior. I'm the owner,\" (still no name given). I asked if he had ever run a restaurant before (in a calm and non-confrontational manner). He literally said, \"That's none of your business.\" Not, \"I'd prefer not to give out that information,\" nor, \"I'm sorry, but I would prefer not to say.\" No. \"That's none of your business.\" And so I asked if his restaurant was in the habit of not making amends when they messed up and ruined people's plans. Admittedly, I did sound snarky, but I wasn't being belligerent. He said, \"It's your word against mine.\" That is verbatim, folks. \"It's your word against mine.\" I laughed (because if I didn't I would shout), and wished him, \"Good luck.\" He replied, \"Good luck,\" as well and hung up.Unfortunately, he's not wrong. He has no incentive whatsoever to make this situation right. It IS my word against his. However, if I EVER spoke to a guest in such a disrespectful manner at the hotel where I used to work I would be fired faster than I could blink. I'm astounded by the lack of customer service knowledge displayed by this owner (if he was indeed the owner; remember, no name was given). Its my word against his. I can only hope that the word of a potential customer is worth more to you, reader, than it was to Terra. EDIT: Perhaps it would be beneficial for this restaurant to not only take reservations over the phone as their website says. Then there would at least be some sort of record so that problems could be more effectively addressed."], ["LD E.", "We were looking for a new place to try for our anniversary. My husband took to Yelp to see what area eateries were earning some high marks and he found Terra. \u00a0It's next to a Starbucks tucked away and it's very intimate--we liked that. I think perhaps the ambiance inside could use some warming up--that's the only reason I took off a star. It's not the most inviting place on the inside, but they use very clean linens (that's kind of a pet peeve of mine--I hate paper), so there are definitely points for that.A very friendly gentleman greeted us at the door and seemed genuinely happy we were there. The service was the best I think we've had just about anywhere--before we even thought to ask for something, it was quickly in place (water, fresh napkins and knives, etc.). Our server was friendly, professional, and knowledgeable about the menu. They run a very tight ship--each course was served at the very moment when you began hoping for it to show up.We had salad, apps, entrees, and dessert. I had the Caesar salad. It was slightly warmed with just the right number of anchovies. My husband loved the pear salad, as well. He had escargot (they are very hard to find anymore) and I had the fresh mozzarella and prosciutto. My husband at first thought there was a bit too much pesto on the escargot, but he said it was delicious. The prosciutto was the best I've had since leaving NY--paper think, just salty enough, and buttery.For the entrees, I had the grouper on ravioli with what I think was a Pernod sauce and my husband had the scallops. The portions are not large but with so many courses, we didn't feel cheated. The grouper was a bit overcooked but still tender. The scallops were cooked to perfection and the ravioli must have had truffle or some other mushroom in the filling. They were absolutely incredible. For dessert, we shared a chocolate gelato sundae with fresh fruit and homemade whipped cream.We put great stock in fine service and enjoy it when the staff and chef or owner appreciates that we enjoyed the meal. The same man who greeted us saw us out, shook our hands, and asked us to return. This is the kind of personal touch you want from a small, neighborhood restaurant. The food is simply prepared, fresh, and delicious. We will be back!"], ["Victoria S.", "Fantastic fresh, simply prepared food with an emphasis on local ingredients.

The wine list was well curated..we found a nice Loire Valley Cabernet Franc (unbeatable at that price point), and also finished off the meal with a lovely Sauternes. The black grouper (caught fresh from the Atlantic) was the star of the show. The duck confit was good, but the leg was a little on the small side and the brussel sprouts paired with it were not really a match made \"au Paradis\" - that was the only blemish.

My dining \u00a0partner and I decided to share four appetizers to get the full Terra experience. Our meal began with complimentary bruschetta which was the freshest bruschetta I have ever tasted. I can not even put my finger on what made it so amazing but I wanted ten more. The bread was crusty and fairly standard. I had a great dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives (sigh) and my dining partner was recommended a glass of wine which surprising was only $9 when the check came. Not bad for such a ritzy place. We split: Duo de Canard \"Traiteur\" - $12 Duck P\u00e2t\u00e9 and smoked duck breast, served with a truffle honey emulsion. Very smoky and decadent.

Food- A complementary seafood salad amuse-bouche started the meal off on a highpoint. It was light, fresh, and extremely tasty. Next we moved on to some \u00a0french bread which I found to be disappointingly dry though the olive oil and balsamic were high quality. \u00a0The Ravioles de Veau au Beurre de Truffe (homemade veal ravioli with cream sauce) was outstanding! By far some of the best homemade pasta I have ever eaten, the flavors were both delicate and complex. I may purchase two of these as my meal next time! Our main course was the filet and \u00a0it \u00a0wasn't as memorable unfortunately. The filet had a reduction with cherries in it ( though it didn't mention this on the menu) but the flavor was too sweet for my taste. I opted for garlic mashed potatoes which were very creamy but lacked salt (coming from someone who is a known under-salter this says a lot). The dessert was the main reason for a non-five star review (since the ravioli absolutely earned 5 stars) we had salted caramel ice cream with puffed pastry and apples. It sounds mouthwatering but honestly the caramel was either burned or their was a liquor that wasn't cooked off...I couldn't even eat it though I will say my boyfriend did. Service was excellent - friendly and knowledgeable.  Wine list - only bottle prices are listed, if you drink by the glass you have no idea what you're going to end up with...which was my case.
