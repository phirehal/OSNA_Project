I also like the Tomatillo sauce to use it either to put some in the Close Talker or a dipping sauce for the chips on the side which I love because it's a little spicy with a hint of saltiness in the mix. \u00a0I love their sweet tea when they have it just right, even though they do sometimes \u00a0have it too sweet like today that I have to mixed the unsweetened tea with it but not too often.

Friendly staff. Clean restaurant. The bad: Small parking lot. Nothing especially distinct from every other Moe's I've been to. Normally I'm not a fan of MSG's franchise. I'd skip it for something else or another tex-mex/burrito chain. This particular restaurant put it back on my radar."], ["Marcia M.", "I try my darndest to support independently owned businesses and am always up for an adventure when it comes to trying out new dining establishments. You may be scratching your head as Moe's Southwest Grill is a fairly large franchise but when you're heading home to Nashville from a snazzy little vacation in Seaside... you only have so many options especially when you are a vegan. I would rather refrain from eating during the 8 hour than pop into a McDonald's. No thank you.My friends suggested Moe's as a healthier alternative and I succumbed especially when I realized that I could inhale tortilla chips and salsa. I don't know about you but I just can't have any portion control when it comes to spicy salsa and tortillas!I was pleasantly surprised by Moe's as they offered many veg friendly options including the Art Vandalay burrito which was stuffed with tofu, bean, and veggies. Add some iced tea, chips, and salsa for a tasty meal for under $10. The salads and rice bowls looked appealing too.I LOVED the salsa bar where you can scoop various versions and make visits back to refill if you inhale it the way that I do! Moe's provided a nice portion of chips which are included for free with your meal.I also really appreciate Moe's mission on providing low calorie, veg-friendly, gluten-free and sustainable products. They even promote Meatless Monday on their website!I may have to indulge in sporadic visits to the Moe's located in Nashville now too!"], ["Tabitha C.", "One of the worst Moe's that I've ever visited.

Why in my travels do I allow well-meaning but misguided people to talk me into eating Mexican food outside of the state of Texas !? Poor Moe's. I am sorry that you got stuck with me but I am a TOTAL Mexican food snob. Look. Your place was spotless clean. Your staff was mostly courteous although seemingly bored out of their minds with their jobs. And why wouldn't they be bored this way? You also had a vast array of fresh ingredients which was GOOD but Moe's ? You ARE the Subway of Mexican food. You have your workers lined up behind the glass like they are at a cafeteria in a nursing home. And then Moe's.. YOU asked ME to build my own taco. Next time get your workers out from behind there so I can show them how to do it. These folks are not chef's or even really cooks, Moe's. They are assembly line workers and am I to be entertained by the sheer delight of watching them follow my orders to build my own creation? To make it more fun you should just give me one of those coin operated cranes like the ones for fetching stuffed animals at the state fair or bowling alleys for loading up my own creation. Now THAT would be entertaining !OK. I was homesick for a Texas taco and I asked for my puerco... oh sorry.. I mean my pork taco to be put into a CORN tortilla and they looked at ME like I was from another planet. I settled into resignation as you stuffed meat into a hard shell taco like the packs from the grocery store that were not really big enough to hold a hamster and then you put the black beans in it and then you charged me extra for a schmear of guacomole that would not cover one half of a bagel. Really?! And where did you order that over salted highly processed Pork meat ? By the time I got two bites into the thing, the brittle shell was falling apart. Your salsa selection was interesting at first sight but no SOUL, Moe's. No Spice. Your chips were thin and kind of flat and stale and NOT warm either. Moe's, I am beginning to tear up here. You and I had an accident and just crashed into each other. A cosmic accident like a comet smashing into the planet like Lucifer's hammer. I am sorry it happened. I know that you are too. Let's just go our separate ways and pretend we were drunk in college and it was a mistaken one night stand. It's not you.. Its probably just me. No sorry. We can't grow personally when I lie. Its really you. But HEY! To end this as friends, I can certainly tell you that your establishment was VERY clean. It really was !

I will break habit if it is exceptionally good or awful. \u00a0 Burritos were half the size of the ones I am used to getting back home in Oklahoma. Skimpt on everything rice, bean, and chicken. The cilantro was not chopped and was leafy. Was charged extra for bacon on a chicken club burrito. They were basically out of the chipotle sauce that goes on the burrito. Should have known that before telling me they could make it. Never been this disappointed with a Moe's restaurant."], ["Nick B.", "Welcome to Moes. I really like burritos so I am a little biased. This restaurant is clean, which is always good. I eat at this Moes often. Over time I have noticed the size of the burritos are getting smaller.

Great value for under $10.00."], ["Melissa T.", "This Moe's is pretty much the same as all other Moe's since it's a chain restaurant. However, I prefer the one out in Eastchase, which is a bit cleaner and brighter. Anyways, I still love their burritos and tacos. Most of the meals come with free chips and self service salsa bar.

Then vacuuming again created a terrible smell."], ["Peter S.", "On a road trip through Montgomery staying at a nearby hotel. Seeing Los Vaqueros had a 4 star rating so I thought I would give it a try. I am now convince that all of the reviews were written by the owner's children. I had an Ultimate Margarita, the trio appetizer, and the two enchilada entr\u00e9e (I chose one chicken, one cheese). The $10 margarita was nothing but well tequila and bar mix - It was sickeningly sweet with no real taste of either lime or tequila. The appetizers were all frozen out of a bag from Costco - I recognized them all as Kirkland. One of the poppers was still cold inside. The enchiladas arrived covered in an unidentifiable red sauce that only tasted sour. The tortillas on both enchiladas were soggy - which usually means they were frozen as well. The most telling aspect of the meal...? The waitress (who was very pleasant) didn't even blink when I said I was done with plates that had barely been touched - she didn't ask if it was okay or anything similar. I am sure she is used to plates being left untouched.A truly awful experience."], ["Jan S.", "Getting into town after a long day on the road we went for the closest Mexican restaurant to the hotel and Los Vaqueros was it. We were greeted and seated right away, ordered drinks and were followed up on twice.

It really was that quick and my no-this-more-of-that veggie fajitas order was 100% correct! I was impressed. The food is your basic Tex-Mex style food, but still good and just the right portion size.

This time the waitress gave the same explanation then added no one else has complained. That implies that the problem was us. Silly me, I thought the issue was that the restaurant wasn't charging us the prices shown on the menu. Or, maybe, no one complains because everyone isn't treated the same when it comes to prices here.We will not return. Food isn't the issue, but being treated fair is. I don't think this practice is legal nor is it ethical. I choose to spend my money at restaurants that play fair and deliver quality food and service."], ["Andrew G.", "Small little place.

It doesn't have a Jalisco tradition - that will mean something to people from the southwest - and if I had to guess I would say the food tradition is from southern Mexico.

Also, the air conditioning is completely distracting. It's basically a swamp cooler that is beyond loud when it's on. And they had paranormal activity two playing on TV.Food was decent. Good seasoning, decent portions. My wife asked for a egg, potato, and cheese burrito (she's from California), and got a gigantic burrito with those items plus rice, tomatoes, and lettuce.

Chips and salsa came quickly and were decent - nice kick in the sauce. House margarita was tasty and the menu is no frills in both design and content. I ordered carnitas, which was a decent portion, not too much, served with a copious amount of onions (yes!), rice, refried beans and guacamole salad. \u00a0The pork chunks were a trifle tough but seasoned pretty well. The spicy chipotle sauce was an added bonus. That and I got four tortillas instead of the customary three. I love rebellion.

Was greeted at the door promptly. Cleanliness of dining room was above average. Chips are served warm. Salsa had good flavor, it was pur\u00e9ed style salsa with smooth texture and with a medium level of spicy to it. I ordered the guacamole as well to go along with the chips and salsa. The guacamole had a whipped and light airiness to it. It was a bit on the bland side in regards to flavor and spice and I didn't detect any hints of citrus in it. For the main course I ordered the Grilled Shrimp tacos. The shrimp had good seasoning and were juicy. The meal is served with refried beans, lettuce, Pico de gallo, sour cream, and guacamole, served on a separate plate. The shrimp are served wrapped in flour tortillas, which is wrapped in aluminum foil. It made the tortillas soggy served as such. It would have been improved by having the tortillas wrapped on their own without the moistness of the shrimp and steam. The refried beans were ok. They had flavor and seasoning to them which is better than many places that just open a can, heat and serve. I did not get the impression that anything was made from scratch, which, admittedly in don't expect from most Mexican restaurants. It's difficult to give a review of the Pico de gallo since there was such a small amount served on the plate. The atmosphere was family friendly, not too loud and spacing is adequate. Appears very ADA accommodating as well. In summary, I would say this establishment rated fair within its class as far as Mexican restaurants located in the area. I have been to far worse! It lacks the freshness and authenticity, but, this is mid Alabama, and that isn't uncommon. For the average family used to the commercialized Mexican food , this place will more than satisfy you.

If you are searching for true, made from scratch Mexican food, this will leave you desiring more."], ["Nick M.", "The service was great but I was unimpressed by the food. The complementary salsa was outstanding and the chips were good and fresh. The servers kept our glasses and salsa dishes full. I ordered a combo plate with a flauta, chili releno and chicken quesadilla. The food was ok but the quesadillas my wife and I make at home were better. Rather than thin strips of meat the chicken was in large chunks. This seemed to be the same chicken in the tacos and other dishes and while tender they didn't have much flavor. While the food didn't wow me I was very reasonably priced (my bill was a bit over $10).
