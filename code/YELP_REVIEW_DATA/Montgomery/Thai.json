They were good (although I'm not a huge fan - even the peanut sauce was tasty). Night two I had Tom Yum soup with Chicken & the fried Spring Rolls. I also had a glass of that way too sweet wine. It was okay but I like the drier Reislings (and I like bartenders that know the difference). \u00a0If you are a meat eater it seems they are more than happy to accommodate! The bowl of soup had more chicken then I could eat. The Basil & Chicken was essentially a plate of meat with a few vegetables and a side of rice. I enjoyed both!!

None of the dishes I had were prepared they way I have had them in other places but the flavors and ingedients were the same and better. The Tom Yum Soup was great.

Staff was friendly and the Green Curry was very good. Will definitely go back."], ["T W.", "I went with my family to Noodles Cafe shortly after it opened. We were not impressed. The food was average, nothing special. Not even the pad \u00a0Thai made much of a splash. The crab rangoon (at least I think that's what it was) appetizers looked like something I could get from the freezer section at Costco. Why pay restaurant prices for one something like that? The server was friendly but didn't have any suggestions to help us better explore the menu. Since Noodles was new at the time we thought we'd give them a while to settle in before writing them off our restaurant options. A month later things still hadn't improved. We won't be going back."], ["Jim O.", "Food very good and fresh. Atmosphere is fine, nothing over the top. Only complaint was the waiter failed to come back to refill drinks after he brought me a huge bowl of spicy beef soup. I will be back, but please dont forget the drinks in a spicy Thai restaurant!"]]}
