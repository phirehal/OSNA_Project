You will not find another Chinese/Szechuan style place within almost 10 miles either way, and I ain't one for driving. If another one opened up anywhere NEAR this one, I would bet my left kidney that CP would lose enough business to force a change. Now to the actual food--it is bottom of the barrel mediocre. Just barely edible in some cases, average in others. I've tried all of their basic lunch fare over the years, and i have never finished any of their coated chicken combos because of their strange, \"off\" texture and smell. They come with sauces that are heavy and sugary, and I can taste no real difference between the honey chicken and the sesame chicken (save the presence of seeds) and General Tso's chicken. The one redeeming food they have is Lo Mein--not overly oily, but not dry. Lost of basic veggies. They do have good vegetable dishes and rangoon, so all is not lost.

It came highly recommended though, was in midtown (always a plus for me), and had a ton of lunch specials in the $5.95 range. Since most fast food lunches are at least six bucks these days, I figured that it was worth a try. The menu is pretty basic and has most of the same dishes that are on every Chinese menu in town. The surprise was in the preparation. Lunch started off with an egg roll and your choice of egg drop, hot and sour or wonton soup. I had hot and sour and my husband had won ton. Both were delicious, well balanced and had some depth to them. My husband had Mongolian Beef and I had Hong Kong Chicken. The preparation of each dish was perfect. There was just the right amount of vegetable and sauce, and the sauces didn't rely heavily on sweet or spicy.

If you braise it correctly, it is very soft and it breaks easily with your tongue press the meat in your mouth. This is how good they are. I can come back to this restaurant to have this dish only.

However, she blamed it on their runner picking up the raw appetizers and how busy they were.I was so angry and disgusted, I did not even touch my lunch after that.

The Chinese food situation is particularly frustrating, as truly excellent Chinese cuisine is incredibly appealing, and would find a welcome audience in Montgomery, a city where even mediocre Chinese restaurants continue to thrive. But such is the situation: The Chinese restaurants of Montgomery are completely interchangable. Each restaurant offers the same dishes, cooked the same way, with the same flavors, textures, and ingredients. So if you're looking for a place to have a Chinese dinner in Montgomery, there are two questions you must ask.First, are you willing to drive 90 miles up the road for a meal at PF Chang's in Birmingham?If not, are you more concerned with getting the best price, or the best overall experience?If it's a good price you're after, you can do much better than Ming's Garden. But this restaurant has been in business for several decades, and in a city like Montgomery, there has to be a good reason for that. Here, it's consistency: From the service to the food, Ming's provides you with a solid experience every time. It's for that reason that Ming's is where I go when I want Chinese food here in town, and I would recommend it to others-- it's just unfortunate that Ming's is so heavily outclassed in every area by PF Chang's."], ["justin d.", "My family has been dining at \u00a0Mings for 14 years.

The fried rice was not fried at all, it looked like steamed rice soaked in soy sauce with a few peas and carrots. The Kung Pao Chicken was not spicy at all and was covered in a dark sweet sauce that was horrible. If you like those baby corn cobs, you would love this dish.
