She said you like.....I said I LOVE!!! It was the hottest kimchi I had ever had & I loved every crying moment!!!!Now onto the meal.......this gigantic bowl came out of soup with muscles, rice cakes, squid...lots of squid......it was truly enough for 3 adults!

The basil was delicious as were the little strips of red pepper..wanted more of that to go with every single bite of chicken. Ginger chicken was okay too- wanted more flavor, more ginger and less onions. They have regular fluffy rice but I love some thai sticky rice or at least sticky calrose rice. I had the \"Crazy\" sushi maki roll with salmon skin, eel, scallion, avocado and asparagus topped with masago.

I'm still curious about the last page of the menu, which features higher priced \"deluxe\" items and is written only in Japanese. I'll be back."], ["Steve L.", "Me and my friends had hibachi and sushi. It was THE BEST food ever!!!Also this place is good for any occasion and the health inspection score was 92."], ["Darren L.", "Food was good, and the service was excellent, but after seeing that their health inspection score is 77, we won't be returning to this restaurant until they get themselves at least in the 90s."], ["John H.", "Service Great! Sushi Spectacular! I would highly recommend Yokohama. In my opinion the Chef is the best in Montgomery! Restaurant atmosphere is very comfortable and the waitresses on on the spitz! This will be a regular stop for Chef Big!"], ["Jamie M.", "This is probably the best Japanese restaurant in Montgomery with the decor and food the best I have seen in a long time. our serve was nice they have romantic private room to inside table with beach.settings. \u00a0Awesome!!!!"], ["Robert M.", "After all of the great reviews, we decided to give Yokohama a try. \u00a0The dining area is bright and clean. \u00a0Sit at the sushi bar or sit in one of their enclosed dining rooms. \u00a0 We ordered three rolls, one of them deep fried. \u00a0All were tasty. \u00a0 Enjoyed the soup, salad and sides. \u00a0I liked the sweet tea. \u00a0We shall return."], ["Melissa M.", "Nice private dining rooms, great sushi roll selection and friendly service. We'll definitely be back!"], ["Taylor N.", "Good sushi selection, including quality nigiri and sashimi, plus all the standard Americanized dishes. A large number of small private rooms are available.Pro tip: Use the buzzer. In true Japanese style, each table has a button that you can press to get service. It's not strictly necessary to press it to have someone come to your table, but that's what it's designed for and it helps."], ["Tammy K.", "The best hibachi and sushi in Montgomery Alabama! Atmosphere is top notch and the isolated rooms if you would like privacy are great!"], ["James R.", "Best Japanese in Montgomery hands down. Extremely reasonable, friendly staff and nice atmosphere! I will definitely be back!"], ["Yen M.", "I got edamame and hibachi shrimp. The edamame was good (not like one can really screw that up) but the soup that came with my entree came out room temperature and my friend's soup was cold. The shrimp was cooked on the grill with yum yum sauce and teriyaki sauce drizzled on it which was ok. I've never been to a \"Japanese\" restaurant where the hibachi meat was not cooked with the sauce. \"Japanese\" is in quotes because they also have some Korean food on the menu, such as bulgogi, and we were also given 3 Korean side dishes at beginning of dinner (these dishes tasted mostly bland). Service was good."]]}
