The hummus was spicy delicious and warm pitas are the best food on Earth. I couldn't eat all the meat, but there was enough pita for every bite. The rice was succulent and just flavorful enough to offset the hummus. The salad was okay, but that's because I'm not a fan of oik based dressings. Overall, it was really good! I tried the baklava, which was a finger-licking delight. \u00a0My meal was around $12...crazy good price for the amount of food. I would and will eat there again.

I don't know what the other reviewers saw in this place - maybe I just had an off night?It was 7pm or so on a Sunday night and it was pretty full, only one or two tables open. Unfortunately we were seated by two large tables - one full of yappy kids about 5-10 years old and the other by their parents (smart of them to segregate because man those kids were annoying).It felt like we were forgotten in our corner thanks to these large tables, so service was very poor. I think my biggest problem was that I couldn't flag down a waiter because they had nothing that resembled a uniform. In the hour and a half we had to spend there for our meal I finally figured out which guys were waiting and bussing tables - and there was no consistency in their attire. Some had collared polos of various colors, some had shorts, some had slacks, some had button downs, some had t-shirts. Needless to say, I never got to ask our waiter for refills or issue a complaint on my dish because I could barely tell who was who in the fray.I ordered the pasta special of the night - pasta with a white wine sauce with clams. My friend ordered a pizza. It took an absurd amount of time to get his pizza, and then another 5 minutes before my dish came. I got a pile of pasta with a scant amount of sauce and six tiny clams, served with a side of cold italian bread overly saturated in olive oil, spices, and doused in coarse sea salt. This cost me 16 dollars. I wanted to ask for a side of marinara to give the dish some flavor, but could never catch our waiter until he finally came to ask if we wanted dessert. I asked for a side of marinara, a box for the rest of the pizza, and the check. He came back with everything, but the side of sauce was a cold plastic cup of overly sweet tomato sauce. I finally just ate the clams after having picked at the pasta slowly while I waited for sauce. When he came back to pick up the check I informed him of the cold sauce and he looked confused and asked if I wanted it heated - I just said forget it and we paid and left. I can't even say it was that he was mistaken in thinking we wanted the sauce to go with the pizza, because he gave it to us without a lid and not suitable for taking out.Over priced, bad service, mediocre food - I would never suggest this place to anyone."], ["Jody B.", "Great, Great, Great Lasagna! \u00a0Good atmosphere! \u00a0Have eaten here several times! \u00a0Pizza dough was a little undercooked last couple of times, but will try again as they seam to be passionate and hard working!"], ["Chris M.", "We found this little gem on our way to Atlanta from Florida.

The food is good and moderately healthy for a reasonable price. As would be expected, the quality is very good for a chain restaurant, but of course, it's still a chain. The quality of chicken is great for this kind of place, but at times, it seems as though it may have been sitting for a while.Additionally, I've probably had everything on the menu. The chicken kabob's are great; they're probably my favorite item. The protein power plate is good, but different; it's maybe a little bit bland, but that's always the deal with cabbage.
