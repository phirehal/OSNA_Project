So, either know what you're getting into - those little plates add up! - or have your second and very much smaller dinner here. Or maybe I need to run with a less drink-y crowd. The dinner menu has changed a little since my first visit a year and half ago, but they have nightly specials. I liked the fried eggplant, the remojon salad, the lamb meatballs, and the roasted pig. As someone mentioned below, the egipcio is a cookie-biscuit thing versus a tart that most people think of (sweet filling with a pastry crust). I'm not a big fan of this as it could be dry. I would skip dessert here, but that's just me. Service is friendly and knowledgeable."], ["Sebastian K.", "Very good restaurant. I was aiming for a more developed and complex dishes since it was highly recommended and I think the chef/owner is the same one as Txikito.After dining in more than a hundred restaurants I think I'm becoming more exigent. It's a 3.5 star restaurant.We came here for brunch. The menu has nice dishes and many different options. We ordered the croquetas del dia which were codfish. Super moist and with a lot of flavor. Wish they served more, only two small croquettes. Then the shrimp tortilla which was good but I was expecting a tortilla, this was more of a fried layer of smash shrimp (never really tasted the shrimp). It was like a paper sheet of fried potato-shrimp infused with a nice fried egg on top. It was ok. The huevos a la flamenca, which it resembles a shakshouka, has a different taste from the usual Spanish dishes so it was a good call to try something different. 4 poached eggs in a lightly Sofrito tomate sauce. Wouldn't recommend it. Still far from the real Spanish cuisine."], ["Vincent S.", "Food is great, I've enjoyed pretty much every dish I've had. \u00a0Only things that keep me from giving it 5 stars is staff and cost."], ["anthony r.", "I rarely make a bad review. Perhaps if we got to taste the menu this may change. Sunday evening I had been planning to take my fiancee to this newly michelin starred restaurant, so much so I thought i would book a month in advance in order to make sure we had a good evening. I also mentioned to the hostess i called that it was her Birthday. The second we walked in the door I knew something was off when there was nobody to greet us, staff too consumed with the half full restaurant to take notice of a happy couple arriving. I walk up to the servers chatting to each other and I let them know i had a reservation for 2 for 8pm. Without even looking at a reservation book one of them just said \" take one of the two tables at the back\" and points in that direction, and instead of taking us to the table, returns to the conversation with the other staff member. As we walk over to the table at the back we realize that there is no air conditioning, and the restaurant is a solid 85 degrees inside. My fiancee turns to me and says she can't bear the heat and perhaps we eat outside, since we can see some tables out the back door. \"We don't serve outside\" was the response... \"Well how about the tables nearer the door at the front which are empty and seems cooler\" I reply\" Those tables are already reserved... perhaps the bar?\" says the serverMy fiancee and I look at each other in disbelief. We both know they haven't even looked up our reservation and would have no idea if those tables are reserved or not! Before I even mention that it's her birthday and we've had a reservation for a month, I take a look down at a guests meal of bland looking vegetables and a dry rack of not so sucking pig's back ... we walk out... No one should be treated like that especially at an institution which should pride itself on service, An apology will be wasted ..We had a fantastic night at a Brooklyn favourite Chez Moi on Atlantic.

The restaurant is pretty small, and it seems like they only have 1.5 servers for the whole place, a bartender, a host, and a runner. The food comes out fast, maybe even a little two fast.There's no dish that I really liked. And the portions are pretty small.Definitely don't get the fried artichokes and anchoas. The fried artichokes could be good but the tips are too papery to be edible. The anchoas are sickeningly salty.The croquettes are very creamy and has a glue-like texture, not great. The flavor of the carabieros ($21 for two) were ok, but the shrimp texture of the meat wasn't good. The cochinillo ($30) was pretty small for the price and while the skin was crispy, the meat was a bit dry and stringy. The fideua ($18) was a weird paella noodle dish. The seafood in the dish was good and the flavors were ok, but overall a bit funky. The olives were mostly the tiny ones and the red Ines were oddly grainy.Lastly, the egipcios dessert was described as a tart but is more like a piece of shortbread with some \u00a0cream and lemon curd. A bit on the dry side.Overall, the food is ok to poor. Service is good though."], ["Daniel R.", "This is a great place to have a pretty affordable Michelin star experience in NYC.I've been to La Vara twice now. The first time with a couple friends, the bartender was exemplary and shared so much with us about the sherry that they have.

Made a note to get the fried artichokes and the suckling pig again the second time, but didn't have a plate either time I wouldn't get again.

I had food combinations I've never thought of before. I'll start by saying they need another extra toilet and service was just fine, I wasn't overly wowed.Eggplant with cheese was sweet and comforting. Fried artichokes tasted almost like meat it was so complex in flavours. The stand out for me, although the rest at my table didn't like it, was this cod, orange, olives, cheese and pomegranate salad. It is rare in life that you have something you've never had anything like it before. I am still thinking about this whacky dish from days ago. Chicken was boring. Dessert was too.

Anyway, a huge + for this place because A actually enjoyed our meal here very much. We shared the fried artichokes with the suckling pig and the suckling pig was delicious!

If you're looking to be stuffed this place isn't for you because all of the portions are really small... even having ordered all of that between the two of us, we could still go for another meal or two!Overall we loved the ambiance as well at the service and would highly recommend!

Decor: very clean and elegant, hardwood floors and white walls, ample bar space to sit down and several tables outside. We sat outside on the back patio there were only 3-4 tables. Granted it was 86 degrees the whole day the back was shaded by a huge tree and the temperature by 6pm dropped. Beverages: SANGRIA, mind blown I had one glass and was wobbling out of there. Date had two glasses and had to drive to Beantown. I couldn't imagine how I felt so loopy.. They put gin in their sangria along with sugar and apples and lemon. Well I knew from that point on I was going to like this place. Food: We had one Fritos and two calientes. Mind you I'm not a big fish eater and majority of this menu was fish or had some in it. We started with the alachofa ($9) fried artichoke with anchovy alioli. So fingerlicking good. Perfectly crispy, not oily. The alioli was smooth, not fishy, didn't have an after taste and a little zesty. So last time my date and I got together he had goat tacos so we were still on the kick and went with the Gurullos. Loved the handmade murcian pasta. Yes the texture might be acquired for some because it's slimey. But there was a lot of flavor in the ground goat. I wouldn't call this a summer dish because of the smokey flavor of the meat. Would love to make this on a nice fall night, with a glass of red wine by a fire. ($15)The last dish of this epic meal was the suckling pig ($30), slow roasted pig with crispy skin. Pretty sure my eyes and I perked up when I heard pig on the menu. They meat didn't dry it was still juicy. Anthony Bourdain would've loved to be part of this meal. Clearly I'm not Kosher.Service: Nick was awesome and personable, he shared his own experiences growing up also not liking fish, spicy food and only shellfish. Service was attentive and our water cup was constantly filled. He knew the menu and he told me what was in the sangria.

Veronica (luckily for us!) is still in charge of the kitchen, with a new business partner, and there's also a soon-to-come liquor license.Prices are still extremely competitive, with most main dishes priced at $8-10 But be warned: plates are generous, so you may want to come here with a few friends and just sample a few dishes. And don't forget to ask for their homemade pepper sauce (habanero chiles, onion, mustard seed, tumeric, and white wine vinegar), which is one of the most flavorful hot sauces I've ever had[3]!Start your meal with a carima\u00f1ola, which may be the one single dish I love the most here: a kassava roll stuffed with meat and boiled eggs, then deep-fried. It's as delicious as it sounds. It's also the perfect dish you want to bring to a party, whether it's a Superbowl party, an office party, or your own dinner party. The patacones (twice-fried green plantain disks) are also a popular starter, but I find them a bit heavy. I actually prefer the yucca fries.As main dish, the arroz con pollo de la casa ($8) was served as a combination of stewed chicken and baked chicken. The pepper steak and oxtail combo ($10) is both simple and satisfying. If you prefer seafood, try the cu cu and codfish, which is prepared with cornmeal and okra ($10). The camarones calypso with coconut rice is another delicious dish that I highly recommend.At Kelso you will find delicious comfort food, simply prepared, cooked with passion, and a homey feel.

I could barely hold a conversation with my boyfriend who was sitting across from me. Every other sentence was, \"can you hear me?\". There were people there who was either regular customers or close family/friends because they were able to huddle in the middle of the restaurant to talk.

We decided to stay, not for the lovely customer service but to try the food that so many yelpers were ecstatic about. THE APPETIZERS: I had codfish. I thought I was going to get cod fish fritters but I received a bowl with codfish mixed onions and sweet peppers. Perhaps this is a staple in the Panamanian cuisine. No problem!

Quickly got over that.We started off with the Patacones (fried plantains) and salad. We ordered other delicious appetizers which now escape me. The OXTAIL...oh my! The meat was incredibly tender. Served with rices and beans with plantains. One of the best I've tasted so far and being Caribbean, I've certainly had good ones. Very filling. My bf had the steak which was equally awesome.

The bones are soft enough I can crunch easily and the marrow runs freely. Rib heaven.Oxtail is maybe my favorite, seems to have been braised forever. Sticky with really unctuous sweet flavors. Stewed chicken has more cumin-y curry flavors than other stewed items.Rice and peas I love. Fluffy and coconut-y, a little sweet. A great vehicle for their hot sauce, which is very bright and fruity and one of my favorite things anywhere. Reminds me a little of Matouk's.Coffee has chicory or something else in it. Sorrel is deep, dark and delicious. Much more complex than bottled stuff from Island food stores I'm used to. Basic salads come out with everything, along with a few bottle of store-bought dressings, they have a sweet onion one I use a lot at home.

First off, let me start off with the one positive thing which is I am a huge fan of the grilled chicken. That's pretty much the only thing that I get because I like it so much. Unfortunately the service in the restaurant is TERRIBLE. I hate when restaurants take the \"well as long as the food taste good who cares about the service\" approach and that's all I've experienced from Quetzal. I'm always greeted with a \"what do you want?\" As opposed to a \"hi what would you like?\". The restaurant closes at 11pm, I start work at 11 so I always call to place my order around 1020-1030. Last week I called twice and got no answer. Having made other arrangements, I passed by the restaurant at around 1045 only to see them still open. I was a little upset but brushed it off. Yesterday the same thing. Called at 1025 and got no answer so I decided to just go to the restaurant. I got there at 1045 and they were cleaning up.

Because this place pissed me off today. Let's start with, I have been ordering here regularly since it first open. I am not a Dominican so when I enter the restaurant I am never welcomed. The boss and his ladies behind the counter never welcome anyone, smile, or say any words near \"Thanks for coming!\" To be very honest, the food in this place is really good. For someone who never liked beans with rice, this place made me fall in love with it. I have been meaning to write them a negative review since winter but I figured it no big deal if customer service suck as long as the food good. But today the ladies behind the counter pissed me off. First I waited on \"line\" (there was no line but a crowd of men trying to skip ahead of me) for like 15 minutes for my food. When it was my turn, the lady asked who's next, like seriously? Learn to organize this place and I been standing in front of you for 10 minutes while these guys are trying to be an ass and skip me. And when I paid $5.44 for lunch special (yes, they tax you), I gave the lady $5.54. I know its just 10 cents, but she did not take a look at the money and just slammed it into her register and didn't give me change. I told her I gave her $5.54 and she owe me 10 cents, but she seemed so annoyed and I'm just like \"Whatever, forget it.\" I resisted the urge to not storm out the place, and walked by asking her \"May I have two green sauce please.\" She slapped one green sauce on the counter (the chicken is a bit dry without enough sauce to cover it up, but that's just my taste preference). I seriously am having doubts about if I should go back to this place or not. I really love the food here and I crave for it quite often. I recently found another place that's similar to this one (El Pollo 3) which is located pretty far.

I had the cinnamon and orange, and my friends tried the cucumber black pepper and the ginger and plum. Deliciousness! But what was even more amazing was the food. We started with some croquetas that frankly were some of the best I had including in all my trips to Madrid and Barcelona. Excellent patatas bravas and probably some of the best octopus I had in NYC (where do you guys get it from?). As a second we had the squid ink paella. \u00a0Crispy and full of taste (they bring you alioli which is another sign that they know how to eat). We finished everything with the deserts.

The chips were just perfect. I had: Bacalaitos ($5), which is salt cod fritters drizzled with a homemade sauce. There were two pieces. It's slightly chewy, but you can taste the cod and the sauce compliments well with the fritters.Pollo Guisado ($10), which is chicken stew served with white rice and red beans. I felt the chicken could've been more flavorful. It just taste like chicken with some light seasoning, but it was still good and hearty. The rice and beans were great.Yuca Frita ($3), which is fried yuca. Yuca tastes similar to potatoes, so if you like French fries, definitely order this. For the price the portion is pretty good. Maduros ($3), which is sweet plantains. Plantains are similar to a banana, this is a must order for me, because I love sweet plantains. Although it's sweet, it goes well with the savory items we ordered.Flan ($5), which is like a pudding custard type of dessert. They have coconut or the traditional flavor. We went with the traditional flavor. It was very tasty and perfect to end the meal.The food was wonderful and the price is amazingly inexpensive for dinner. BTW, it is CASH ONLY."], ["Joe T.", "Oxtail - more bone than tail - and the chicken - from the freezer to the microwave! Another pretentious \"bistro\" that believes they're actually selling Latin food? Question mark because I still can't believe it.

Lol Did anybody see that pic of that sad little piece of fish with the fake ass fine dining sauce around it?? That pic reflects everything that's wrong with this place."], ["Kristen M.", "A few months ago I made the mistake of letting my best friend taste my sister's cooking and he hasn't stopped bugging me about pastelon since. But my sister lives in the suburbs now so I knew I had to find something to tide him over, otherwise I would have to buy a lifetime supply of duct tape to shut him up. 'Cause it's not like I don't have enough little sister inferiority complex problems ya know!? It took some time and serious research (one does not mess around when it comes to pastelon). I settled on Puerto Viejo because like I said, good food can not be kept under wraps, and certain island foods can not be kept secret. One of those things: PASTELES! THEY HAVE PASTELES! IN THE LEAF! It's a regular menu item! Pastelon AND pasteles! Everybody knows, no one makes pasteles like your great-grandmother does. Luckily, someone's great-grandmother is in the back 'cause this one was awwwwesome. I had the chicken one and was so giddy when it came out, that just like when I was a kid I made a mess while opening it. I remembered why my mom always insisted on opening mine as a kid; I was always so excited I would forget to put a napkin down and would inevitably spill water or grease all over myself as I opened it. Yup....some things never change! Don't care... it was just like I remember my great-grandmother's and I was in heaven. Now every day can be Navidades! Happy day! Happy day!The pastelon was juicy and sweet. I like mine a little sweeter, but this is the age old debate about pastelon so one can not be harsh about these things. My friend was satisfied and felt it was an adequate replacement for my sister's, so I will now get some peace! We also ordered the mofongo. I don't even like mofongo and I liked this one. Ironically, my friend liked the mofongo more than the pastelon! He's so fickle! But then again, it was all so delicious how can you blame him for loving great food. I hear the churrasco is awesome, and as a churrasco fiend I will most certainly be back to try it along with the sangria that was also recommended. Sounds like a perfect happy hour to me! The service was really great too, and the food being so fantastic and reminiscent of happy days spent in my great-grandmother's kitchen high in the mountains of PR, not only will I be back, I'm bringing a lot of friends too!"], ["Lauren W.", "I came here and shared the Picadera. The crispy pork and Dominican sausage were my favorite, but everything was cooked perfectly. It was definitely a treat.

Cozy atmosphere and friendly, attentive staff."], ["Nolan S.", "Went for dinner around 6pm on a Monday. Really great happy hour prices: $3 Coronas and $1 empanadas. The empanadas were delicious. They had cheese, beef, and chicken. We sample all three, and they were all very good.I had the burger, which is the main reason this review is only 3 stars. Put simply, the burger was bad. I asked for it medium-rare, and it came out well done, totally dried out. But the worst offense was the fact that they had compressed the beef as much as humanly possible. A good burger is made with a light touch, delicately working the beef into a loosely formed patty. This thing had the texture of a brick.I might go back to try one of the more authentic Dominican dishes, which looked good."], ["Casey R.", "Found this restaurant because of the review of the day, otherwise I don't think I would have ever known it was there, it's on a pretty secluded area, we drove there from Park Slope and found parking right away, we were actually surprised that this nice restaurant was actually on the block it was on. The hostess was nice and gave us several options on where to sit, the tables are very small! Actually the place is very small, and since we knew we were going to pig out, we needed a bigger table, so we opted to sit at the high table in the middle, with hopes no one sat next to us, which thankfully they didn't. The waitress (Cynthia) came right away and took out drink orders, we decided to get some white sangrias which were very good. For appetizer we had the sampler platter, which was sausage (I loved them!) fried cheese (also very good) my husbands favorite (fried chicken) beef, and tostones. We also ordered the \u00a0bacalaitos, which were good, but way to chewy, but the flavor was delicious, we weren't able to finish them because I felt like I was never going to be able to swallow them. For entree I ordered the churassco, yellow rice & red beans, everything was good. My husband got the pork chops, I tasted them & they were very good. As full as we were I still ordered a flan to share, they had regular & coconut, we went with the regular, and wasn't disappointed. The service was great, and so was the food, thanks to review of the day (yesterday) if it wasn't for that I would have never discovered this hidden treasure."], ["Jeannette N.", "I love Puerto Viejo for so many reasons: THE FOOD/DRINKS-Omg, the Chimi Burger. I ordered it for the first time this past weekend after a climbing sesh and inhaled it like a madwoman. It comes with tomato, onion, and a Dominican slaw on top, and yuca fries on the side. I have a mad craving for another one!-Mofongo al Pilon. This is what I normally order here. It's mashed green plantains mixed with either chicken, pork or veggies. It's served as a ball with a thing of sauce. I like to destroy that ball ASAP and mix the sauce all up in the plantain mash. So delicious and filling!-Sangria is solid: perfect combo of wine and fruit. -Wine options are on point. Highly recommend the malbec. THE LOCATION-It's in a rando corner surrounded by warehouses and car mechanics, which happens to be just a couple blocks from my apartment. It's slim pickins in my immediate vicinity, so I LOVE that Puerto Viejo is here if I need some delicious food in a pinch without venturing out too far.THE SERVICE-Super chill, welcoming, friendly servers. I strolled in at like 10:45pm on Saturday night knowing that the kitchen was closing at 11pm. I fully expected them to scoff for wanting food so late, but instead I was welcomed with a smile and menu, sans warning. THE AMBIANCE-Dimly lit and intimate. There's a long, narrow table in the middle with stools, surrounded by a few tables and a full bar. I haven't taken a good look at the decor, but for some reason I get the feeling I'm in a pirate ship. On Saturday night they were playing Latin music. During the week it's a bit more chill. Highly recommended!"], ["Annie T.", "Heard about this place but haven't been until recently for lunch. Felt displaced at first with all the garages nearby but the feeling of \"desertedness\" adds to the charm. The decor is rustic but still modern , atmosphere vibrant. Everyone who came in were either people working nearby or locals who knew the staff. We found the service good & friendly but then again the place was half empty when we went during lunch. Their berry sangria and the monir sorando were delicious and strong. The empanadas.... I mean that's what an empanada should look and taste like. Beef was better than the chicken, and they were so inexpensive!! We had the Pernil Mofongo and Bistec Encebollado with a side of rice and sweet plantains. The garlic sauce accompany the plantains was on point. Our dishes arrived promptly and were both delicious. I preferred the bistec over the mofongo, which could have had better flavor. Good portion sizes without being gargantuesque (too bad if you are super hungry). This place is a bargain, especially during happy hour. Cash only."], ["Lorenzo T.", "This place is a local hidden gem.Great lunch spot that is probably the best bang for your buck if you want some latin flavor. Just be sure to ask what the lunch specials are - cause the menu doesn't list them. Dominican style entrees that will be sure to hit the spot. You can't go wrong. Sandwiches were filled with juicy cuts of meats and cheese.Great for sharing!The slow roasted pork (pernil) severed with a crispy piece of the roasted pig skin on top was amazing.

The oxtail was nice and tender and just so yummy.I was less impressed with the tres leche cake that we ordered for dessert. The piece was rather small for $5 and the cake was too dense for my liking and I didn't really taste the condensed milk.

The walk wasn't that bad - 15 mins at the most, and it was well worth it. I ordered the Oxtails with yellow rice and red beans and it was really good! The only disappointment I have is that there wasn't much mean on the ones I received. Although oxtails is known to be more on the bone side, I was still hoping for miracles. The older lady behind the counter took care of me - she was very attentive and seemed genuinely nice. She welcomed me to the neighborhood (as I just moved here and expressed it) and made sure to inform me of their lovely happy hour times M-F 4-7pm). I will definitely try out their Sangria. I don't think they have their liquor license yet, so just wine and beer . The place was nicely decorated - they have some really cool, artsy canvases on the walls. Their bathroom was clean and cute.

Definitely drizzle the spicy heaven on the table in your meal.Cons-they do not drain their fried food properly or at all.

The waiter was very nice and very attentive and even had some great suggestions on food and the first thing we of course got was SANGRIA!Sangria came out and it was loaded with fruits it was a good nice red wine. We had started off with some potato croquettes stuffed with ham which was good, the menu doesn't have much neither to pick and lots of different spices and ingredients in the main dishes. I had me the bacalao y calamares which was squid with stuffed cod fish in it, the sauce was tomato black olive which was so good I enjoyed that flavor, it was hard to break into the squid but its not the softest easiest seafood to bite into. The bf ordered a rice that was mixed with vegetables and seafood and came in like an edible potato skin not sure exactly the type but it wasn't any flavor. The rice was good and its small portions so you can share these meals with others if you just wanna order a bunch of things or if you don't have quite the big appetite these meals would fit right. For dessert we had ourselves the chimichurros which were big and came with a chocolate fudge and whip cream dipping, we thought it came with other more dipping sauces from the prior yelps and pictures we seen but it was just one sauce and it was quite delicious.All together we had ourselves a good meal and dessert with a drink, prices are not bad at all. The server was very nice and pleasant and so was the other workers in the restaurant. I enjoy the location and enjoy the dining life in Williamsburg. I would def. come back for some wine and appetizers and also try out the paella which from the pictures I seen look delicious!"], ["Tessa A.", "The owner and bartender during the day were awesome.

First off, the place was absolutely empty. \u00a0It was one of the few places in the area that took reservations for a group of 8, so we didn't have much choice. \u00a0There was maybe only 2 other tables here, so you'd think service would be fast. \u00a0Wrong.The brunch special comes with an alcoholic drink, but it took about 20 minutes before we received them. \u00a0 Already we could tell this wasn't going to be good.Our server was nice, but nice isn't going to quench my thirst or satiate my hunger.We ordered food but it took almost an HOUR to get our food. \u00a0This wouldn't be acceptable in a busy brunch spot, let alone an empty one. \u00a0I don't care if you have 1 person in your kitchen, it is not okay at all anywhere in NYC to take that long for good. \u00a0I could have made brunch for 8 in my own damn kitchen in under an hour. \u00a0 As for the food, I was not digging it. \u00a0I got the Spanish omelet, which sounded good but was really gross. It had so much stuff in it (spinach, chorizo, onions but no potatoes that I could find) that the egg was barely holding it together. \u00a0Whatever egg was there wasn't cooked enough so it was really soggy. \u00a0It was also smothered in a layer of mayonnaise, which just added to the whole gross factor. \u00a0On a side note, I was ill about 30 minutes later. \u00a0Fun times!The eggs benedict looked good and everyone seemed to enjoy that. \u00a0The duck sandwiches were not so good, or so claimed the people eating them. \u00a0Honestly the best looking dish was the roasted veggie plate that my vegan friend ordered. \u00a0Seriously, a bunch of veggies was the most appetizing option at our table. \u00a0What a fail!Oh and we had little ants falling on us at our table in the back. \u00a0Yes, that's right, bugs were falling on our heads and onto the table. \u00a0When we mentioned this to the server, he seemed unconcerned and didn't really believe us. \u00a0He seemed more concerned hanging out at the bar with his coworker buddy. \u00a0Whatevs. So yeah, this is why this place is empty every time I pass by - it's really not good and the food is soooooooo slllllooooooowwwwwww."], ["Oscar C.", "Place was great just left with my girlfriend Julie.

The hostess / waitress / runner finally responded and wanted to sit us at a high top table with a 3-year old...not happening. They said they didn't have a high chair (which BTW, when I went to the bathroom - guess what was in the there...a high chair!). She sat us down in a booth, which was fine. After 15 min I had to get up to get our own menus, still no water BTW, oh & no A/C. I had to go up to the pass to find a waiter. Finally placed our order. Apps were good. One hour later still no entrees. They then came to us & asked us to move so they could accommodate a party of 15 in which they messed up their reservation. We said no because of the horrible service we had already gotten & the only tables they had were high tops which again, we said a 3-year old couldn't sit at. 15 min go by and another person came to ask us to move and again we said no.

On one summer day we sat by the big window in the front of the place and to our surprise they opened the whole thing up. We had a great view of the sidewalk and street just people watching. It was a nice touch. \u00a0 They have live jazz on Fridays from 8p-11p--NO COVER."], ["Corinne C.", "A few weeks ago, Cadaques made the switch to French cuisine. Usually, I don't like when a restaurant just ups and switches cuisines like this, and I was upset to hear that a restaurant that I so previously adored would now be serving up French food. My defiance immediately ceased upon looking at the menu. I had originally planned to check out another new spot in the Burg last night, St. Mazie, but needed to kill some time before my friend arrived. So I was slowly meandering Grand Street when I decided to just get a drink here and relax for a bit. Hot pink high heels sure take their toll after a while. Upon entering, a few things had remained the same; the happy hour, which is two for one drinks and often times includes specials like oysters or all you can eat mussels (that's right). $6 for two glasses of sangria? I was a happy camper for the next hour or so, sitting just out of the glaring heat and daylight but still close enough to feel its warmth.I decided to pick the bartender's brain for a bit about ye ol' switcharoo: \"Essentially,\" he informed me as he poured me another drink, \"the owner is French, and the Chef is French, so they decided to have a go at some French food.\" Hmmm.... I thought to myself. The way he made it seem was like they were just switching it up for a bit, trying something new, not necessarily permanent, and just because they can. And they can, it's their restaurant. I liked to think of this as a little exhibition so to speak, taking place at Cadaques for a bit. After all, the decor is the same, the drinks are more or less the same, and the atmosphere and the service--hell, even the name of the restaurant--was all still the same. So, I approve. He had mentioned they've been getting a lot of negativity on Yelp, and I must say I disagree.By the time my friend arrived, I was cooled down and calmed down, and frankly didn't feel like moving. So, St. Mazie would have to remain a mystery for a bit longer, I decided. We ordered up some more beers (they have Palm, a favorite of mine), some steak tartare, some mussels and a seared tuna dish. It was all so delicious. Remarkably Cadaques while completely new. And French. The seared tuna dish was so refreshing with a nice bite to it, the steak tartare is amazing (as it always is), and the mussels that Cadaques are so well known for were still living up to their reputation. While I'm sad that the mussels have had to let their little Chorizo-chunk friends go for a while, I'm happy to embrace the new 'Ques. And of course, the service is always stellar."], ["L D.", "This place is awesome! I had a 27 person birthday brunch here on a Saturday afternoon. Our server Oscar was extremely attentive and our glasses were never empty! The food was absolutely delicious! It was a great deal for unlimited brunch drinks and food.

I highly recommend this place for an awesome brunch!!!!"], ["Daniel J.", "Went here on a date the other night not knowing what to expect! We walked along Bedford Avenue searching for somewhere to eat and this place caught our with its sign outside.Really nice decor and a nice crowd at the bar for a Tuesday night.

But the Paella was amazing and the best I've ever had! The bartender, Greg, was very nice. He was friendly and funny! He made our time there very enjoyable! He also makes great cocktails! Overall this place is amazing and I will definitely be going back for the excellent food, excellent service by Greg, and the nice chilled out and relaxed vibe!"], ["Vivian H.", "Well it is no wonder I fell in love with this place. One of my favorite artist, Salvador Dali, seems to have also been enchanted with Cadaques. If he were alive today, I would definitely be stalking him on Facebook. But on a serious note, I haven't been to Cadaques yet, but if the restaurant is any reflection of the food in the town on the Mediterranean, then I will sell my soul to corporate evil America just to get a chance to experience it. I won't lie. I learnt about this restaurant by an ad they placed in the L Magazine. Yes, I read that magazine all the time. I like the \"Ask a Cabbie\" section. It always gives me a good laugh. I read the magazine cover to cover (even the ads). Yes, I know. I am a loser. I am hopeless. We came here on a Friday night at 7pm and the place was just starting to fill up. There were some people lingering at the bar, and only some early birds seated like us. The rush didn't show up until about 8pm. This is how we do it in Brooklyn. Here is the RUNDOWN:2 for 1 sangria between 5 and 7:30pm - Unfortunately, my date is allergic to alcohol. But lucky for me, I am a fish. I ended drinking 3 out of the 4 sangrias. PADRONES ($6) - This will forever be one of my favorite tapas. This is fried Spanish peppers with madron salt. Very simple and goes well with alcohol. When I was in Malaga, I went to a taparia in Malaga (after getting off the plane and checking-in to the hotel), and I was famished. This was one of the first dishes I had, so enough said. CROQUETAS DE QUESO ($7) - Exactly what I expected with Idiazabal cheese.ESPARRAGOS A LA PLANCHA ($10) \u00a0- I love asparagus. I will eat it any way you prepare it, but this dish made shudder inside. The romesco sauce with roasted almonds sent me into ecstasy. CALAMARES A LA ROMANA ($12) - This was just OK. I am not really into fried items, naturally I didn't eat too much of this dish. But the squid ink aioli was like crack. HIRAMASA CRUDO ($16) - This by far was my favorite dish. It was sashimi slices with olive tapenade, and escabeche vegetables. This dish reminded me of ceviche. And I love ceviche. My only criticism? Go less with the olive tapenade, it was way too salty. I also have to say that the live music was just phenomenal. The whole time we thought it was an album, but then realized it was live music after everyone kept clapping, yes, they were just that good! I'll def be back for more good tapas, good flamenco music and also I wanna check out the DJ from Espana!FYI. Lovely bathrooms, but I was a bit confused. In the ladies room, there is a red cushion on the table, was it for diaper changing or baby making? As you can see, I have a vivid imagination. This is CASH only but they have an ATM right inside the restaurant."], ["Laura A.", "Listen,Bizcocho borracho* dipped in caramel sauce.You are very welcome. That was the culmination of a fantastic dinner at Cadaques where the highlights were not limited just to the dessert round. In fact, savory dishes were even better and I am completely surrender to their Pan con tomate (the infamous Catalonian signature dish, Pa amb Tomaquet) because Cadaques serve the best version I have ever had in the city. That is mainly because someone, finally, use the right bread, or at least the closest to what we use over there (pan payes, literally, 'peasants' bread'). This indulgence is a simple as slices of country bread brushed with garlic and fresh tomato and olive oil. At Cadaques they serve the toasted version and so the bread got that amazing crispy crust, but it is also moist because got impregnated by the olive oil and got all the juices of the fresh tomato. We order it with serrano ham, which make it better. You can order regular serrano or Iberian, which is the superior quality. Cadaques is named after a beautiful fishing village located on Catalonia, Spain. There was always something special about those small villages by the Mediterranean and Cadaques Williamsburg evoked a similar feeling. The atmosphere evolving Cadaques is beautiful and inviting and if you happen to be there while their Flamenco nights with live Spanish Guitar, then you will be sold. Usually on Wednesdays, although we were enough lucky to listen to it on a Friday night. In addition to the Pan con Tomate, we got another must have when in Spain. Spanish tortilla de patata (potato omelet). More specifically, it is Tortilla al minuto at Cadaques, or minute Spanish potato omelet with caramelized onion and homemade allioli sauce (Catalonian version of Aioli made out of garlic and olive oil) on top. Even when it is also an interpretation of the classical style where the egg is fully cook while this one comes much more soft and it needed a burst on flavor, particularly salt, the caramelized onion right on the middle, the moist texture and that potato flavor cooked on olive oil was delightful to me. Brocoli rabe with fingerling potatoes, shaved Manchego cheese and romesco sauce was next. The least favorite among my friends for the only reason that it was really bitter. I find it the attractive feature of this ingredient and so it was not a problem for me. But it definitely got better when soaked on the traditional Catalonian romesco sauce that comes on the plate, a mix of a variety of nuts including almonds and hazelnuts, with roasted garlic, olive oil and red bell pepper. We finished with the Paella negra (black rice). The squid ink is used to cook the rice together with Cuttlefish, clams and shrimps and served with allioli on top. This paella mainly lacked the socarrat layer on the bottom, you know, that crispy layer of rice that got all the intense flavor like if it was an sponge. Even so, it was extremely good, full of flavor, rice and seafood. Be warmed, lips will get a black tone as well. Finally, caramel sauce. It is part of the 3 dipping sauces for the churros, a version that looks like the Latin American but taste in reality quite close to the Spanish churros, the closest that I have try in New York. We also order the drunken cake, very good by itself, moist, light, not too sweet and soaked on liquor. Someone had the brilliant idea to dip it on the caramel sauce, and you know the rest. We asked for extra caramel sauce. And after a while another order of churros while we drunk the white wine served in the porron**, the traditional glass wine pitcher with a spout on a side that lessen to a small opening. A clever way to keep the wine protected from air but ready to use at any time and by many users without fear, since you can't touch the small opening but pour the liquid on a distance to your mouth. Yes my friends. That's how we do it in Spain. You think you can do it without spilled all over your face? ... This food with a few glasses of wine were enough for 6 people at $35 per person in total. And it is now recommended by Michelin guide 2012. On my own opinion, you can consider it as close to 5 stars as you can. Because of the service, because of the vibe, the decor and particularly the food. \u00a0Go there, enjoy your time, get lost and fall in love ..

The sauce was the best part, the shrimp were bland despite being submerged in the sauce. We ordered more bread and devoured the sauce.Pan seared scallops with bacon and asparagus sauce. No, I don't think so. I can't describe how BAD these were. The sauce was disgusting and the scallops were rubbery and tasteless.Chorizo - can you say over cooked, shriveled hot dogs? They should be ashamedChicken breast croquettes - from the freezer most likely and there was nothing in them that even remotely tasted like chicken. Was more like a tasteless potato blob.Stuffed mushrooms - these were actually decent. Even better when you throw some of the garlic sauce I mentioned earlier on top.Fried calamari - I've had worse and I didn't expect much from a Spanish place on these.

Third tapa was the stuffed mushrooms and what more can I say? I love mushrooms! The fourth tapa was the fried calamari and it tasted pretty good and well I also love calamari, so no complaints! The fifth tapa was sweet breads, which was only okay. For dessert I got the homemade creme brulee, which was amazing! I loved every bite of it.

First off, I lived in Valencia for awhile so my standard for Paella Valenciana may be a little high, but then again, I chose to eat here because they advertised themselves as being authentic. Paella is made with short grained rice that is cooked with saffron (giving it a yellowish color) risotto styled until perfection (which is why the wait is around 25 minutes) After waiting patiently for my food, the paella came out white (which means they didn't use saffron), with long grained rice, and BLAND...SO INCREDIBLY BLAND. In addition, the chicken in their Paella Valenciana was overcooked, and the seafood in both tasted far from fresh. The waiter did the absolute least to take care of us (even though there were only 2 other tables to tend to) and even had the audacity to CHASE AFTER US and YELL AT US for not giving him what he thought he deserved in tips.EXCUSE ME??

The short ribs were tender , not overly salty, and the mushrooms with garlic added a beautiful touch. One of my friends order her usual dish: fish tacos. She offered a taste to me and my mind was blown away. I've never had a fish taco that tasted as great as theirs. My other friend ordered a Columbian sampler that seemed to taste just amazing as it look.I love their customer service. Very attentive and welcoming. I was beyond impressed.

I will definitely be a returning customer!"], ["Veronika K.", "OMG i LOVE LOVE LOVE Bogota! forget the fact that they have passionfruit stuff which OBVIOUSLY makes them the coolest automatically... their food is AMAZING AND AUTHENTIC (how am I doing on the key words here?!)Just go try it and have their mexican breakfast and have a passionfruit drink to go with it and be drunk and happy before 2pm. Just do it."], ["Michael P.", "If you like Colombian food avoid this place and go to Queens. The bandeja paisa was not up to par in my opinion. I was highly disappointed with the flavor of the steak and the beans as well. French toast was actually pretty good and it was cheap, but I wouldn't come back here."], ["Stephanie A.", "Im definitely a fan of the food at Bogota. This place is packed and super high energy so you better try to make a reservation or you will be waiting forever! Drinks:I had the coconut mojito and the mango mojito. Both are delicious just extremelyyyy sugary wow! If you can handle the sweetness you will like it. I also took the free aguardiente shot offered with the check in. It tasted like liquorish. The drinks are stronger than you would think so take it easy. The sweetness masks the amount of rum and triple sec used. Apps:Ordered the shrimp and bean empanadas. The shrimp was great! The bean not so great but I didn't expect to like it, I actually wasn't the one who ordered it but decided to try it anyway.Entree:Based on the photos I had to get the Columbian platter and wow. Talk about a lot of food. Steak, sausage, egg, an arepa and rice & beans. This plate is NO joke but its really good. I came hungry so I was ready to tackle this bad boy. The steak was great, I love my steak medium and perfectly seasoned and I was happy. The chorizo (sausage) was good. Everything was great! I was very happy with the plate but I definitely could have \u00a0done without the egg. I eat eggs but it didn't compliment the platter to me.Overall a must try!!"], ["Candace H.", "I've been to Bogota several times. It has become one of my favorite go to places on 5th avenue. The food and service have always been spectacular. After my first few visits on a weekend night I realized the importance of making a reservation if you want to be seated promptly. \u00a0As far as food goes, there is a wide variety of empanadas which are all incredibly tasty with the accompaniment of the dipping sauces. My favorite dishes here are the Pernil (even though the portion size is somewhat small) and the plantain crusted chicken. I've also had the chicken quesadilla which are a must. The churros are an excellent way to end any meal. Excellent extensive drink menu! My only real disappointment with this place is the outside seating in the back in the colder months. They really try to heat it nicely since the temperature is obviously much cooler than the actual interior of the restaurant. However no matter how much they heat it in the winter months I would suggest requesting to sit inside and not in the back area if you get old easily or don't want to wear a heavy jacket while you eat. The back area next to the glass wall/window where we sat on our last visit was very cold and made our meal a little less enjoyable."], ["Alexandra B.", "I love this spot! The staff was so friendly from reservation call (with darling Lola!) to nightcap on the way out. The manager John (Sean?) even visited our table to let us know about their Yelp promotion so we could get free aguardiente!

Firstly I made reservations in advance because I heard this place gets busy and boy I was right! Came here for a date night with my friend. We're both fans of Latin food and were eager to try something new! Made reservations for 8pm. We got there at 8pm and the place was packed! We waited about 7 mins tops for our table! The decor is fabulous and very homey! The perfect lightening and the music was just right. They do have a full bar and from the outside it looks small but let me reassure you its hella big inside!!! Plus they have a backyard where you can enjoy your dinner as well! We were seated all the way in the back at first it looked congested but once you're sat down it's fairly comfortable. Our waiter came to us right away and he was very knowledgable about the food and drinks and gave us a play by play on what to order (we're first timers). He gave us all the time we needed! I wish I got his name! :( We ordered jerk chicken tacos and steak and potato empanadas for start. Then I ordered Arroz con pollo and my friend order Pernil it's pulled pork and a side of cilantro mash potatoes! The drinks were superb!!!!!! I had a watermelon mojito and my friend ordered they're signature drinks (I wish I could remember the name!) but it was delicious non the less. We also decided to order banana pudding and it was outstanding! Caramel on the bottom and a big piece of banana pudding swimming in it! Of course with a dollop of vanilla ice cream... Yes! I LOVE THIS PLACE! I'm so happy I came here! They definitely made our night special! Big shout out to Sean I think he's the manager there. He was very friendly and even made sure our food was up to part! Such good workers there who know their stuff!

I am the type of eater that does not like to try new things or new places but thank gd i did with this place. Everything we tried to eat was good or better than good. the calamari were great with a unique kick to it. The corn was off the hook! better than Dos Caminos. The entries were good as well and large in portion.The drinks were good other than the mojitos possibly being a bit to sweet rather than a bit too strong. The unique flavors made up for that flaw.The only reason I did not give it a 5 star review is due to the long wait. My group was told 20 minutes over the phone when we were on the way. But waited another 40 on top of the time it took us to get there.Looking forward to coming back here without the wait."], ["Patrice M.", "I came here after a friend told me how much she loves this place and their mojiots. Now I love a good mojito so I wasted no time giving it a try. I made a reservation, because I read some Yelp reviews saying that it gets packed on the weekends (I went on a Friday night). I got there a little before the person I was having dinner with, and they still seated me and let me wait for him, which was nice. The plantain chips with dip that they give to each table are pretty good.The first drink I had was a mango mojito. Now I love a good mango mojito, and I feel like you can't really go wrong with it. However, I'm the kind of girl that likes to taste my liquor. it definitely could've been a lot stronger. It was tasty, but it tasted like juice. Tasty juice.I ordered the garlic shrimp with yellow rice and sweet plantains. The rice and shrimp were both disappointingly bland and barely even warm. My date's food however, was steaming hot. I don't know what was up with that (he had the paella). The plantains were the best thing about my meal, and they weren't nearly as crispy as I like them.After my meal, I ordered the sangrita, with high hopes that it would be better than my first drink. It was =). Very delicious, and strong enough to give me a little buzz. The sangrita was the highlight of my meal.I probably wouldn't go back to Bogota on my own, but if somebody invited me I'd go and try something else on the menu because the service and atmosphere were good"], ["Armand D.", "Eat here.Maybe I should say more... but that's the essence of it.The food here is great. I don't eat meat, and there's plenty of stuff on the menu for me (thoughtfully marked with a \"v\" or \"vg\"). But I understand it's not all about me, and everybody has something they'll like here, and everyone is happy with the food.The appetizer menu is excellent, and realistically you could sit at the bar and have several of these and be satisfied. The street corn is fantastic, and their empanadas are so good that you may just want to order the sample (4 of them) and see what happens. The dip sampler comes with guacamole, black bean dip, and pico de gallo, along with plaintain chips and corn chips. You get the idea - lots of stuff is great on the appetizer menu.Main plates are also good. I was a bit underwhelmed by the salmon, but the coconut shrimp were great. Portions are substantial.The drink menu is just as much fun as the food menu. Jalapeno margaritas are very good. There are also a number of South American bottled beers to try (Quimes is my fav). The atmosphere is fun and lively, although it's a bit bright and a drop tight in terms of room. The staff is always excellent - from host/ess to wait staff and bartender. They seem to really enjoy working at Bogota, and it makes the experience that much better."], ["Jully H.", "I've had this place bookmarked for a long time so I decided to finally check it out especially because of the free shot you get when you check in. \u00a0I was highly disappointed, \u00a0it wasn't disgusting but maybe my expectations were a little high. \u00a0The drinks are NOT strong and pretty bland tasting. \u00a0Taste like all mix and barely any alcohol. \u00a0The sample was disgusting. \u00a0I'm familiar with chorizo and I just was not feeling it here. \u00a0Also the chicharron ,believe it or not, was actually lacking flavor. \u00a0Fried pork belly should have this wonderful taste and never bland unlike here. \u00a0I heard such good reviews about the garlic shrimp I picked this order over the skirt steak. \u00a0Fail Fail Fail. \u00a0Where is the seasoning???!! \u00a0My boyfriend got the grilled chicken breast and althought it was also lacking flavor it was much better than mine. \u00a0The grilled corn Mexican style was slathered in some type of chipotle mayo and barely any cheese I'm sure my stomach will be upset later. \u00a0Don't think I'll return."], ["Ivan T.", "I have been here a total of 2 times. In 2014 and 2015. I came last year during the summer and was seated immediately. I loved the plantain chips and dipping sauce which was tottaly different than you ajo molido you get in other places. We ordered our food and it arrived pretty quickly. However, I wasnt sold on the food itself. The rice was salty, more than my liking \u00a0atleast. I ordered the arroz con pollo, and it was ok. I wouldnt say it was great, but it wasnt disappointing either which in turn is good. My GF and her sister had the skirt steak with yuca fries. The steak portion was rather small but it was absolutely delicious OMG, I wish I would have ordered it instead of the traditional arroz con pollo. The only hassle was the end since we had to wait a pretty long time to get our check and an equal amount of time to pay it and then receive our change. Second time I came was alone and had the same dish (gluten for punishment i guess) but this time it wasnt as salty. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Be prepared to wait if you come for dinner from thursday through the weekend though, it does get crowded, and with large crowds come slow service at times, so please be patient with the staff and be respectful of them, one thing I hate is when people go eat somewhere and treat the servers like crap.That was a side note.

My friends said during peak hours they can be really busy which I can understand cause the atmosphere had good vibes. They serve plantain chips and their homemade sauce instead of chips at the table. I thought the plantains tasted a little \u00a0stale and their homemade sauce was nothing special, considering they made a plug for it by saying if we like it that it's available for purchase. We then ordered the coconut shrimp, empanada platter, garlic shrimp and jerk salmon. Overall it was good, nothing special. My salmon tasted a little underdone and the coconut shrimp were so heavy. We got the garlic shrimp with mashed potatoes (which were green and actually really good) and spinach was good. My favorite empanada was the bean and cheese one. Not in any hurry to go back because there's so many restaurants in Brooklyn but this one is conveniently located to my friend so ill probably try it again."], ["Serena L.", "THE BEST!

As for the food, the beef empenada was just like a smaller jamaican beef patty with a hard crust. The plantains with cheese/queso was pretty good and I enjoyed the complementary plantain chips. My entree was the Bistec Enceballo(skirt steak with onions and two sides(coconut rice and gallo pinto). This was nothing to boast about as the steak was rather small and salty. Gallo Pinto was plausible and the coconut rice is something good if you haven't tried SE-Asian coconut rice/plates.Service is great though and helpful.The final was a total in the mid-50's. I would probably not come here anytime soon."], ["Garry Z.", "Been here 5 times ( 2 brunch, 2 dinner, 1 time for dessert).Never had a bad experience. The dessert is amazing.

I've been to Bogata at least four or five times now and I still haven't written a review about it. \u00a0I really have no idea what's stopped me. \u00a0Bogata is FANTASTIC! \u00a0One of my favorite restaurants in the city. \u00a0It's one of those places we find ourselves at when a special occasion rolls around... birthdays, anniversaries, etc. \u00a0 It has an amazing vibe, awesome staff, delicious food and some of the best margaritas around.--------------Lets talk about those margaritas shall we... the frozen are my favorite...specifically the mango and passion fruit flavors. \u00a0Absolutely perfect combination of ingredients making them sweet but not overly and just the right amount of tequila for that kick that have me ordering another, and another... Of course I do eat when I visit Bogata....The Empanadas for one are incredible. \u00a0If you're thinking about ordering I recommend the sampler ($15) and cutting them in half to share. \u00a0My favorites: - Shredded Chicken - great spice! \u00a0Dip in any of the sauces the empanadas come with, they all taste great with the spicy chicken. - Goat Cheese - combo of creamy goat cheese and queso blanco is soooo rich and soooo delish. \u00a0Try it in the mango bbq sauce! - Guava - puree & cream cheese - who has time for churro's* and flan? \u00a0Just bring me a round of these little guys. \u00a0The sweet fruityness of the guava mixed with the richness of the cream cheese is soooooo good.I'm also a big fan of the following: Chipotle Salad with Plantain Crusted Chicken ($16) - it always surprised me when I go to a restaurant and have a reallllly great salad. \u00a0It's lettuce, ya know? \u00a0But the combination of avocado, feta cheese, diced egg, red onion, tortilla strips is great. \u00a0Add the plantain crusted chicken, which is delish all on its own, and drizzle on some chipotle dressing and you have a killer salad. \u00a0 The chicken especially is something special. \u00a0The plantains give it this incredible crunch.Pernil ($16) - Ahh the pernil. \u00a0Slow roasted pulled pork that's been marinated in Colombian beer. \u00a0I won't lie to y'all - the pork is a little salty. \u00a0But I suggest you ask for a side of their mango bbq, the sweet tanginess helps cut the saltiness. \u00a0A side of the Tropical Slaw also helps cut the salt. \u00a0The cabbage + slices of mango tossed in vinaigrette is just really good and works so well with the pork and bbq sauce. Another must try if its available is their mashed plantains. \u00a0I've never been a big fan of plantains, unless they were in chip form, but this mashed version was wonderful. \u00a0I wish they'd put it on the menu permanently.--------------As mentioned briefly above the atmosphere is just great here... the place is so inviting, and so lively! \u00a0I love the bright and colorful walls, the twinkle lights and the enclosed patio in the back. \u00a0The staff has always been great to us too...I don't have a single complaint about this place. Oo and bonus- I found out recently that they added $3 empanadas to their happy hour menu. \u00a0Yes! \u00a0Looks like I won't have to wait until the next birthday to return for another awesome meal at Bogata. --------------*In all seriousness - the Churros are really good too. \u00a0You get four sticks and dips for $6 and they're totally worth it."], ["Emmeline X.", "My friend came here to celebrate her birthday and we had a party of 10. My pet peeve for that night was the seating. We were placed at a table where one side is pressed up against the walls. The whole row needed to get up, when one person needed to use the bathroom; unconventional and a disappointment.As for food, I ordered sangria and \u00a01/2 a garlic rotisserie chicken.

They served plantain chips and a yummy sauce when we first sat down. We ordered the empanada sampler and the arroz con pollo to share. The epanadas were pretty good. I think my favorite was probably their special (with fish) followed by their veggie one. I really liked that they also included a trio of sauces. However, their arroz con pollo fell a bit flat. It was a bit on the bland size (or maybe in comparison to the appetizers...) and the chicken was really dry, to the point of being nearly inedible. Perhaps it might have been better had they used a different part of the chicken. Judging by the taste and the texture, it was probably white meat/chicken breast, but perhaps it would have been more flavorful and less chewy/dry if they had mixed in some dark meat."], ["Inna S.", "Great Cuban food. Our waiter was very friendly. Asked for our feedback on the food and recommended great things. The food was delicious so were the drinks.

That night I drank a few delicious caipirinhas and had pastelon for dinner, a sweet plantain lasagna and IT WAS AWESOME. However, I ate so much I was so full all night and still full the next morning. I was in love. I went to their brunch a few weeks ago and it was equally as great. I had a yummy mango mimosa and the Dominican breakfast. The mangu was on point and so was the chorizo. I felt like I was transported back to Santo Domingo. My boyfriend had Migas de Arepa scrambled eggs which included arepas, chorizo, tostones, and guac. That was also delicious and a lot more fresh tasting than my plate if that's what you're more in the mood for. Honestly, any plate will probably cure that hangover you're walking in with.

Its combination of classic Colombian cuisine, stiff drinks and uniquely attentive service is as relevant today as it ever has been before, particularly in the face of Park Slope's growing prices and diminishing tolerance for creative restaurants. The juicy skirt steak and textbook aroz con pollo are two notable standouts. For sides, try the cilantro mash or the deeply-rich black beans. Be sure to wash everything down with a Caipirinha (if you're bold enough to do so) or any one of Bogota's signature margs. Very hard to go wrong there.

I asked for a booth so we waited for a few minutes a the bar before being seated in a booth.They had live music, which made it a perfect romantic setting!Service was really great too, very friendly staff!Food was good too but I wasn't impressed, otherwise I would have given them 5 stars!We took the Valentine's day prix fixe even though we were told we could order a la carte. Appetizers and desserts were perfect! But the second course was not as good : my boyfriend got a portion the size of an appetizer while I got a big plate. Even though I didn't finish it, it was a bit heavy and I didn't feel good afterwards... on the other side, my boyfriend ended up cooking something light at home because he didn't have enough!Overall we still enjoyed our evening very much! but If I had to do it again, I would go with the menu a la carte and maybe go for tapas..."], ["Chris K.", "A Memorable Moment at MyMoonI got a dinner for two voucher from GiltCity which included a bottle of wine, \u00a0appetizer, a salad, an entree, and a dessert to share.The woven complimentary flat bread was warm and crisp. The bread served as a vehicle for the delicious olive tapenade headed right to my mouth. We decided to go with the red, which was a Spanish mix of berry flavors. \u00a0For the apps we chose the croquettes and the octopus. The light and crisp croquettes were filled with some ooey-gooey goodness. The grilled octopus app had an awesome smoky flavor and was swimming in a sexy starchy cream sauce they called potato foam. Regardless of what you want to call it, it was certainly a standout start to our meal. We both had the goat cheese beet salad which we thought was well done. They definitely don't skimp on the goat cheese. I think the dish would be better with less goat cheese and more beets. The goat cheese sits in between two circular slices of beets, and looks like a miniature ice-cream sandwich.We both selected the 'Suckling Pig' as our main event. We absolutely fell in love with the dish. The crisp cracklin' pork skin puts its cousin Peking duck to shame. Somewhere between the mmmms and seductive eye contact was the warm succulent melt in your mouth meat. The sweetness of the raisins complemented the savory pig in a sensationally sinful way. Oh, and I can't forget about that comforting velvety puree which married all the flavors together perfectly. The last two bites of the entree might be overwhelmingly heavy for an average lady, but I celebrated every last meaty morsel. The Chocolate Souffle dessert was like a highly refined Domino's Lava Cake. I usually don't like overly sweet desserts but this was a rare exception. The sultry warm chocolate oozing out the center was exquisite. The buttery almond ice cream counterbalanced the sweetness of the chocolate. I just wish there was a little bit more ice cream.The service was great. The artful presentation was flawless. The Gothic ambiance was romantic. The food was amazing. It is time to make a confession and come clean. Usually, the first thing I think about when I wake up is my lady; but the next morning after MyMoon, it was that 'Suckling Pig.' Hopefully she'll understand.Bravo, MyMoon."], ["Sidra M.", "Love this place! Gorgeous design, inside and out. Top notch meat and cheese plate.

I knew I had a lot of requests and questions and he was always there to answer them and make them happen. \u00a0He is professional and a kind-hearted gentleman.

One of my request was I wanted to do an aerial performance at the space and Ruggero made it happen. The food was so delicious! All my guests loved every bite!!. Lastly, 5 HOUR OPEN BAR!

Well I waited to the next day and decided to call the restaurant to talk with someone who would be able to help me. \u00a0When I spoke with an individual there, he rudely asked me if I submitted a form online which I responded yes and that I submitted it almost two days ago. He said to wait for them to contact me and that he could not help me while he was on the line with me. UPDATE:For those who do inquire via the website, check your spam folder as the owner has indicated. I'm not sure why it does that but would think MyMoon should look into that as others (similar to my situation) may think no one is reaching out to them to discuss having their wedding at this venue. This may be difficult as it is also hard to talk to someone via the phone when you call the restaurant."], ["Diane Z.", "The space is beautiful -- repurposed from an old factory.We stopped by for a beer and olives.

We looked at several spaces when it was time to chose a venue but the combination of aesthetics and Ruggero's absolutely professional demeanor put it way over the top for us. If you are having a warm weather wedding do not underestimate that outdoor area. We had a gorgeous 79 degree day so our ceremony was held out there and our guests loved hanging out there for cocktail hour and outdoor breaks throughout the evening. It is gorgeous, photo ready, and a perfect backdrop. The inside is also stunning- high ceilings and exposed brick and it's enormous. Very roomy and comfortable for everyone to enjoy their night. Friends and family are still raving about the beautiful atmosphere that night! As for the food and drinks, again, people are still talking about it. Everybody said it was over and beyond for wedding food- from the passed hors d'oeuvres, to the appetizers, to the main courses, to the desserts everything was delicious and elegantly presented. Drinks were lovely and we basically had a full bar plus red and white sangria that everyone seemed to enjoy. One detail that should not be overlooked is the service. In addition to Ruggero's meticulous planning and coordinating throughout the night his staff is top notch. Everyone was professional and friendly. Our friends mentioned on several occasions how great the bartenders were.Overall, we had an amazing experience planning and enjoying our wedding at Mymoon.!"], ["S W.", "It was my first time ever going to this restaurant, the food was great and the outside seating was so pretty!

This was easily a 4.5 experience, but until Yelp gets with the halfsies program, I'll keep the 4 star rating up...So needing a much needed nerd day to watch 2 nerdy movies back to back (Catching Fire and Thor 2) Ingrid S. and I needed to first get some breakfast fuel. We looked for boozy brunches but places in Brooklyn weren't catering to us on a week day so we had to be creative in order to achieve our lush needs.In a sea of hip bars and cozy dining establishments all along Smith and Bergen streets I spotted this no-frills Latin food place and my lil Hispanic heart began to flutter. I knew this could be the start of a yummy, inexpensive breakfast with at the very least a cold beer or 12.Upon us seating ourselves our waitress brought us a menu. Lots of yummy Puerto Rican/Dominican dishes on this menu but we opted for more traditional breakfast fare. Then out of nowhere (okay, it came from our waitress) a complimentary (yeah, FREE!!) basket appeared with warm, buttery bread. We gobbled up that bread as if we had never had buttered bread before. But in all seriousness - that was some bangin' ass bread, possibly homemade. Mmmmm...buttered bread.I ordered a sausage, egg and American cheese sandwich, they don't have conventional rolls so my options were regular bread, I think an English muffin and Italian bread - I went with the last option, I mean...dah. My sandwich came pressed as if by a Pannini presser - YESSSSS. Also they did that thing where they made the eggs with the cheese in the center so that it melted and oozes out with each bite. I kind of hate when people make an egg and cheese sandwich with jut plopping the cheese on top of a cooked egg and the heat doesn't melt the cheese - I mean DAMN, this isn't fillet minion, thankfully El Nuevo Portal got it right. Also, my sausage was delicious and not burnt...huzzah.Ingrid ordered a Western Omelette which came with green bell peppers and ham. Her eggs were slightly over-cooked and I personally think it would have been fantastic with some mozzarella cheese, but sometimes dairy products don't agree with her sooooooooooo she was content being cheese-less.Her meal also came with fries which I happily assisted with, I mean - I was just looking out for her calorie intake and decided I would take one from the team. What kind of friend let's her friend inhale all the delicious carby, starchy, potatoey calories by themself? Let's just say it wasn't much of a sacrifice as much as it was a labor of (yummy, fried) love. The fries were good. Actual potatoes in there and they came out fresh from the oven. Om nom nom nom!I also developed a special relationship with the Jamaican Parrot Hot Sauce that they had on the table. My attachment to hot sauces is still very, VERY new and my taste buds are still no0blets in the wide world of spicy things. This hot sauce was spicy and I didn't think I could handle it, but then I drowned the inside of my sandwich in it and mixed a healthy amount into my ketchup and I was set.As far as our quest for beer went we both ordered Presidentes only to be informed about 10 minutes after placing our orders that they were fresh out. We each ended up getting Coronas instead. Bottles were plopped in our midst and large wine goblets followed alongside a generous bowl of limes for our pursual. CORONAS IN LARGE WINE GOBLETS? YES PLEASE. We were the classiest broads in all of Brooklyn-land.Need a cheap, tasty, no frills breakfast in this neighborhood? Want it to come with beer in a large wine goblet? Then this is your place :).At the end of our meal we each ordered an empanada (yellow cheese and white cheese) to go as we went off to our nerd movie jaunt. They were decent, probably better had I eaten them warm but instead we noshed on them enthusiastically about 2 hours after getting them. They were still tasty and at only $1.50 each, pretty comparable with some of Queen's finest empanada establishments.I'd totally be up to coming back here to try some of the actual Latin food which is their focal point. Plus beer in wine goblets...MAY BEER IN WINE GOBLETS BE FOREVER IN YOUR FAVOR!!! :)"]]}
