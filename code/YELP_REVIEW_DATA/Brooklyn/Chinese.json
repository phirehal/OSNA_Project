It's different and higher quality. I won't claim that it's authentic as I am not the expert on what that would be, but it's quality ingredients, and good flavor. A lot of spice. (This place also makes that General Tso fast food crap, but it isn't as good here as other restaurants so maybe go somewhere else if you just want sesame chicken).I've tried a good amount of the menu here. My favorite dishes include the Dan Dan noodles, and the soup dumplings in red oil. Anything in that red oil is going to be good. I'll generally start with those and then add to the order. The pork belly and cucumber with garlic is pretty popular here as well.Price wise this place is pretty good too. The problem is that stuff is so delicious that I tend to order a lot and it adds up quickly. So while the prices are in line with the rest of the neighborhood, I always end up spending more here (the reviewer that called these manhattan prices was way off base)."], ["Catwoman Y.", "Wanted to have Chinese food, we went there last Saturday coz it seems it has the highest review in that neighborhood . But as a Chinese, i can tell you the truth, the Chinese food not authentic at all! It's just home made dishes, put whatever veggies or materials as they want, quite disappointing. My bf as an American, felt the food was suck as well. Plus the price is the same as in ManhattanThe owner and waiters were wrapping some fortune cookies at a table in dinning area, talking loud.Worst Chinese food had in \"restaurant\" in the city! The food not worth the price!"], ["Patrick D.", "There isn't a better a Sichuan restaurant in the NYC & surrounding area.Been eating here for 10+ years - consistently awesome."], ["Amanda H.", "Some friends and I didn't feel like waiting in line at Mister Hot Pot or one of the Sunset Park dim sum places, so opted for sichuan instead. So glad we did. It seems like they do a lot of takeout and delivery orders, so seating wasn't a problem, and we didn't feel rushed. Everything we ordered was delicious -- I would absolutely recommend the soft shell crab. The photos look intimidating, but despite the overload of chilis, it was the perfect amount of tingly, numbing spice. Aside from that, everything was solid -- the eggplant in garlic sauce was a personal favorite (though one friend thought it was on the mushy side). The dining room is pretty bland, but the staff was quick and friendly. Overall, great experience."], ["Christine C.", "Solid Szechuan food in Bay Bridge! The place may look unassuming, but if you want authentic Szechuan, this place is it. Most of the dishes are flavorful and spicy so make sure you can handle the heat. the Dan Dan noodles are the best and probably cheapest thing on the menu. The mapo tofu is also great and always a favorite. I tried the whole fish with garlic and scallions last time and it was a good, milder counterpart to the other spicy dishes. Consistently delicious!On a side note, it's always very hot inside the restaurant so if you tend to overheat, wear a t-shirt!"], ["Fan V.", "I finally got the chance to try Grand Sichuan after all of the reviews/advertisements I saw. I had an order of Dan Dan noodles, spicy soft shell crab, and shrimp dumplings in red oil. My favorite, which I would order again was their soft shell crab dish although it was drenched in oil (fried then saut\u00e9ed). The noodles & dumplings were just okay. Slightly bland, surprisingly, since they're known for their spicy dishes. One thing, I really like about this place is they DO NOT overload on peppercorn like other Sichuan restaurants. I'm rating this place 3.5 stars because I wasn't too pleased with their shrimp dumplings & Dan Dan noodles. Service was acceptable although they told us we couldn't spilt the bill between two cards. (Strange b/c it was a decent amount). Would I return? Most definitely. Next time I will try one of their spicy hot pot fish dish."], ["Julie T.", "Very good food & service I think what is a more authentic Chinese menu than others but I'm sorry; I still prefer 86 Noodles, which also has a much nicer atmosphere."], ["Sol C.", "Grand Sichuan House serves some damn good food. Delicious, in fact. We ordered a whole lot and each dish was perfection.For appetizers, we tried the wontons in red oil, the Chengdu dumplings in red oil, and the Sichuan dan dan noodles. Both wontons and dumplings were slippery and juicy covered in the spicy oil and the noodles were perfect - just a slight coating of heat mixed with starchy noodles, minced pork and some greens.For entrees, we had the fantastic cumin lamb, served over a bed of cooked onions and cilantro. So much flavor. We also had the green beans with minced pork, which was better than any green bean dish I've had at a Chinese restaurant before. It was nice too because both the lamb and the green beans were not spicy, which we were thrilled about because our third entree - the mapo tofu - was spicy as hell and needed to be balanced out. Don't get me wrong, though, we loved the tofu too but definitely ask for a whole lot of rice with it!Fantastic food plus good, quick service and a relatively inexpensive bill at the end of the night. What is not to love?"], ["George L.", "This place is a hole in the wall or a mom and pop restaurant but damn those it bring the quality and taste you would not expect. I wish this place was more famous but then again I like it because it is unknown to so many. However, if you are looking for some spicy food and you are in the area then head over to Grand Sichuan House for some awesome food.I went there with a few friends and we ordered the Spicy Cumin Lamb, Spicy Wontons, Dan Dan Noodles, and the Dry Sauteed Pig Intestine. Wow was I surprised but every single dish. The spicy wonton which they leave in their homemade spicy chili oil with garlic and some unknown spices left me wanting more. The spicy cumin lamb was delicious and I felt myself coming back for more every single time. I was sad when we finished it as quickly as we did. They had to keep the menu out of my hand from ordering another one. The Dry Sauteed Pig Intestine was by far the best dish of the day. They know how to clean and cook it well where it is crispy, salty, and spicy all in one. Reminding me so much of a cross between bacon and a chorizo. The Dan Dan Noodles were good and I can see why people love it so much. There was a nice coating of minced meat and spices that left me wanting more and more until it was all done.My only regret about this place is why I did not order more dishes to try. I was not disappointed and actually want to try all their dishes now. Please come here ASAP if you love spicy food and are not afraid to try new flavors and dishes.Recommendation:Dan Dan NoodlesDry Sauteed Pig IntestineSpicy Cumin LambSpicy Wonton"], ["Marisa L.", "Pretty good, although I could understand being deterred by the Ghetto menu and the decor.

If you're looking to have more of a variety of options, 8th avenue in sunset park has some great Asian restaurants. But in terms of Szechuan, this beats all.I ordered the Dan Dan noodles which was one of the best I've had. The soup dumplings were average at best, however, so I would go somewhere else if you're looking to mainly eat the soup dumplings.The guizhou chicken has been my go-to order every time I've stopped by and I recommend it to everyone. The reason I don't go as often as I do is mainly due to the price. The small dishes/appetizers are fairly cheap, but it's the entrees that are a bit pricey ($13-$25). It may not be as bad for some people, but I think it's relatively high for the area its in.Enjoy :)"], ["Bella C.", "For those that love spicy food, this place is heaven.

I've tried the other location by St. Marks and I think the tea tastes slightly different. The lamb burger was pretty tasty. It is spicy and very oily, so it's definitely a messy meal. The first bite, I only tasted the spiciness and not really the actual meat, and because of that thought it was too overpowering. But after a few more bites, I really did get to enjoy the flavor of the lamb. I wouldn't take the burger to go, mainly because the bread comes out pretty crispy and within 10 minutes, it will quickly get soft.This is a great quick place to stop by and get cheap asian food.

This is how they keep their cost down, right?Look, you're going to get a heaping plate/bowl of freshly hand drawn noodles, tossed in some wicked chili oil.

The noodles were good but not superlative, and the lamb was simply not hot. The spice level was fine -- I just felt like I was eating old food that was made many hours ago.

I'd already paid for a tea, I guess I should have saved that cup. Still, I can't endorse patronizing places that can't provide water, so I'll be withholding future business and an extra star until they fix that.

I know they are selling the fact that the noodles are handmade. \u00a0However, because this is a chain I feel that the noodles were sloppily made.

Initially, the \"half lean half fatty\" (the better way to have) roast pig was tasty, the crispy skin better than any lechon kawali I've ever had. The pieces were cut in more manageable bites but as you ate the meat with the equal portion of fat, it seemed the pork became less appealing as our brains were comprehending the amount of fat we were consuming. \u00a0We opted out of ordering rice with our meal, the new trendy thing to try stay healthy and because we also ordered noodles. \u00a0(Yeah but who are we fooling-we missed our white rice!). \u00a0 Maybe if we had rice we would feel less guilty as rice seems to temper the richness of pure pork fat. \u00a0If you order the roast pork, order a bowl of rice and share it so you have some hot, fluffy stuff to offset the saltiness and fatty parts. \u00a0Less onerous to eat was the seafood fried noodles. \u00a0It was perfectly done with a generous portion of shrimp, scallop and squid over thin noodles fried crispy revealing their soft undersides. \u00a0The sauce was just the right amount and not corn starch glop like some places. \u00a0There were the right number of stems of Chinese vegetables on the plate, not the usual large \"trees\" which would overwhelm this simple noodle dish. \u00a0In Hawaii they would call this cake noodle but the noodles used here were much more delicate. \u00a0Last but not least was the Chinese squash with sliced fish. \u00a0The squash is like a large okra and often translated as Chinese okra turning some people off, but it's actually not slimey as you would imagine. \u00a0It's slightly sweet and hard to explain, refreshing. \u00a0Each bite is crunchy like a quickly saut\u00e9ed squash should be but the insides retained a fresh succulence. \u00a0The fish, my food expert friend thinks is grouper or sea bass. \u00a0The meaty slices were fried in a tasty batter and stir fried with the squash and lightly saut\u00e9ed onions. \u00a0Some places would throw in some \"cloud ears\", a black edible fungus but this place did not and I didn't miss it. \u00a0This dish is light but substantial and the original reason we were looking for a new Chinese restaurant to try. \u00a0They succeeded to win us over. \u00a0The gratuitous red bean dessert soup with black rice and sliced oranges were a perfect ending touch to this satisfying meal. \u00a0Oh, need to add that that our teapot was refilled by other waiters quickly giving them extra points for attentiveness. \u00a0The cost was just $40 for all this goodness! \u00a0Worth the trek if you don't live in the 8th Avenue Brooklyn Chinatown area. \u00a0Afterwards, scout out some boba or sago for dessert in this dynamic Chinese neighborhood if you have room!"], ["Elizabeth N.", "This place can be packed on a weekend night so make sure you have a reservation.

My family and I have gone out for dinner here a few times and their food and service never seems to disappoint me. The people here are super laid-back and fun and to talk to. Somehow, I love their lo mein even though there is barely anything in there. Just plain noodles soaked in soy sauce. Their Young Chow fried rice is either a hit or miss, sometimes overcooked with too much water but when it's a hit, you'll never go anywhere for fried rice again; they add all the good stuff like barbecued pork, shrimp, peas and ham--can't ask for anymore!Also, get the steak--pure, Chinese-style steak at its best! Another great dish is the Hong Kong Style lobster. They actually have live seafood tanks in front so seafood is guaranteed fresh but I totally recommend getting this if you're in a group. Their \"special\" Pride of Lucky Eight is actually not great. For a Canto restaurant, this actually tasted like something you would find in the northern part of China.

For 5 people, we were only able to eat half of each dish and the rest we packed to go. The fried garlic chicken was crispy and flavorful, but very salty! The orange beef was gingery and sweet, similar to Chinese food take out (but better). The pan fried flounder was my favorite, the fish was crunchy and not too greasy, it was topped with chunks of fish meat and sauteed bok choy, mushrooms, carrots and chives. The food was delicious and a great value. The service was attentive, but not pushy.

But my dad knows a lot about his food and he stated after a bite that that's a different kind of fish. So we told the waiter and he said with a smart comment that \"if it's not the type of fish you ordered then I don't know what it would be\"- meaning it had to be the type of fish we ordered.

Another waiter came and my dad told him and he even agreed that it wasn't the kind of fish we ordered . & apologized. Iknow it wasn't his fault. But he wasn't rude like the other waitress. Now my dad isn't one to really complain about anything but it was for the safety of us- because my sister is young & she was told for that type of fish she can just swallow the bones because it's soft After we were done eating, my dad went to the front & complained once again & they insisted that it was the type of fish we had ordered but my dad knows that it's not the right one from experience and especially since he eats there all the time. & adding on to that he was rude about saying my dad doesn't know what he's talking about.

The skin was perfect, the meat was perfect, the sauce was perfect.... so delicious.At the suggestion of the waiter, we also got crabs. They were huge, and the amount of fat in the crab was a hit with everyone at the table. I kept coming back to this dish throughout dinner... my camera was greasy by end of dinner. Eh hem. The slices of pork neck tossed with vegetables was served in a beggar's bowl, which brought back memories to many at the table. It was yummy - C. has made a vow to come back and re-order this exact dish.By the time I remembered there was a dish of scallops sitting on the table (I was busy picking at crab), they were all gone. Seriously. I guess they were good...We had a dish of eggplant as well. I'm not a huge fan of eggplant, but it was alright to everyone else at the table.The dish of fatty beef (the name of the entree literally has \"fatty beef\" in it in Cantonese) was one of my favorites. They use the type of beef you find in Japanese beef bowls or in shabu-shabu. It was soooo good (and fatty). Mmmm.A basket of Chinese-style fish sticks was ordered for the kids. They came with a mayo-wasabi dip. Since I don't like wasabi, I just ate the fish sticks plain. The coating was actually pretty good, but it's only good hot. When I grabbed a second one a little later on, definitely did not taste as good as when it first arrived.The steamed egg whites with chicken were alright. It went very well with rice, and we were all somewhat amazed at how many egg whites would be needed to make this (think probably nearly a whole quart of egg whites). We all agreed that our mutual loving relative made this better at home though.Our last dish was a plate of ong choi, and they saut\u00e9ed it perfectly here. It's the one dish I didn't snap a photo of that night...

(Yes, I am a fake Chinese person, ABC.) We got squab garnished with some salt and lemon the side. The squab is expensive $12 for one with not that much meat. However, it is a good try for those who have never experienced it. The skin is super crispy and the meat is flavorful, somewhat of a cross between a duck and a chicken. Be sure to dip in the salt ( I know it looks like a lot, but dab it.) \u00a0and also to squeeze the life out of that lemon! I also ordered Pride of Lucky 8, which is their signature dish. It is basically a medley of veggies and abalone - it includes some fried garlic strips, some shiitake mushrooms, scallions, and some leek. Since there are so many different ingredients, each bite is a different flavor - some taste super fresh, others are a little saltier, and some with more seafood - it's a surprise every time! The other thing I ordered was a pan-fried flounder dish. The fleshy part of the flounder is separated from the bones. The fleshy part is stir fried and laid on a bed of leafy vegetables. The bones are then deep fried and become a crunchy treat that you can eat. A great contrast to the stir fried fleshy part. This was a unique dish and also worth a try if you want to experience something different. My only complaint is that some of the veggies were not thoroughly washed and had some sand/soil in the stalk crevices. During dinner they give you complimentary oranges and a sweet soup. The oranges are your regular ol' oranges. The soup was awesome! It had some Chinese herbs in it which I don't know the names of. It tasted like a syrupy soup, try it! Overall, this is a traditional restaurant, but is definitely also a modern one - they really spice up traditional dishes and make it unique. Worth it to try authentic Chinese cuisine.

But after several recommendations from friends, I had to go and try it out. TL;DR - The prices are cheap, the flavors are good. The boiled dumplings are the way to go and they tend to be small. Golden Fried Dumpling really specializes in shui jiao - thinner skinned, *boiled* dumplings. These dumplings tend to \"shrink,\" \u00a0pulling the skins closer to their meaty centers. They aren't as juicy. Golden Dumpling also chooses not to fill the dumplings to capacity, leaving lots of air pockets of wasted umami potential. Each dumpling can be eaten in a single bite. They are served with a small container of soy based dipping sauce, which amps up the flavor. Golden Fried Dumpling uses the same shui jiao dumplings to pan fry, but as described below, aren't as satisfying and tend to be greasy.Prosperity focuses on guo tie/wo tiep, pan fried, thick skin dumplings that fill with the meaty juices of the fillings as they cook. Some people call them potstickers. The dough is more toothsome, and can be crispy on one side. They usually take me two bites per dumpling and I feel that they have more meat. Wo tiep is what I make at home and I personally find them more satisfying.So while you still get a lot of food for $5, if you're a Chinatown regular this place may not be worth it. Get the boiled instead of the fried and save yourself the oily mess that will come your way.

And it turned out to be a surprisingly great experience. We ordered soup dumplings, meat ball noodle soup, sweet&sour short ribs and the tomato soup.Pros:1. The most authentic Shanghainese restaurant I've ever been in the US. No complaint about the soup dumplings (the chef used to be the executive chef at Joes' Shanghai and the owner came from Nanxiang - the soup dumpling town) Skin is thin and it contains the right amount of soup instead of overloading it. (Many ppl thought the more soup the better, while for the real Xiaolongbao, you should never have too much of it!)2. The real deal comes from the other items on the menu, everything that we ordered are top-notch in terms of food quality. I would say the food is great even by a Shanghainese's standard. Meatball is my bf's favorite and the short rib is the must-get as well.3. The store setting provides a very cozy feeling. I am a big fan of the exposed wall and the picnic-style table&chair. And there is even a show-room for you to see how the soup dumplings are made! (I remember I've seen this setting before, hmm...)4. People here are super friendly!Cons:1. Unfortunately, they only have roughly 30 items on their menu and I want more!! (Fast-casual, yea I know...)2. Can you please open your next location at UWS?

The soup spoons provided are disposable, flimsy things. If we're eating here, why not provide some real spoons, and reduce some of the waste?**2. The soup spoons are also too small. They can't properly hold an entire dumpling, which led to my dominant female overlord (wife to you whiteys) clumsily losing some deliciousness onto the nice wooden tables. This is unforgivable, and I have since begun divorce proceedings. 3. The eggs on top of the mapo doufu were seriously overcooked. Keep the eggs runny, people. A runny egg makes everything better.4. There's no alcohol. There should always be alcohol. This includes the bar mitzvah I was forced to attend over the weekend. I don't care if they are still children in the eyes of the \"law,\" Judaism says that kid is a man now.

It was tasty and a generous portion.I also tried one of their \"bites\" - the shaoxing wine chicken or \"drunken chicken.\" I've never had this dish before so maybe I just need to acquire a taste for it but I felt it was mainly fat and bone, making it hard to eat and slightly unappealing.

We ordered the xiao long bao (soup dumplings), pork potstickers, the fried chicken fillet noodle soup and the pork mapo doufu.

Service was quick, we barely had time to check out the very visible soup dumpling prep station of the kitchen and sit down, and they were calling our order number.Now for the food - being huge xiao long bao aficionados, we were impressed with Yaso Tangbao's version - very savory, fresh, and the wrapper wasn't too thick. We polished that off really quickly, and are thrilled that we don't need to make the trek to Chinatown anymore to get our fix! The pork mapo doufu with the two fried eggs on top was delicious and our next favorite. The fried chicken fillet noodle soup was a little weird but good. Unfortunately, we greatly disliked the pork potstickers - we could barely taste the pork, it tasted just like sticky rice.

They give only a few pieces, less than half of a small cucumber cut up and it was very over salted. \u00a0Wine chicken - again, the portion was tiny and over salted - steer clear from this. \u00a0Sweet & sour pork ribs - came in a tiny order of 4-5 small pieces, basically 2 normal ribs cut into half. \u00a0Noodles - I've had the beef and braised meat ball for $12. \u00a0Again, in a normal Chinese noodle shop, this bowl of noodles would have been much larger and about half the price. \u00a0The noodles tasted okay but one bowl isn't enough for an adult. \u00a0If you are going to charge $12, at least let the customer walk out feeling slightly full! \u00a0Noodles don't cost that much so adding 15-20% would make a big impact on whether someone is going to return to the place.

The restaurant was practically empty. With 4 long picnic style tables and two small tables in the corners, we had the free will to sit wherever we wanted. I was glad we were early because had it been later in the evening, the odds of sitting with a stranger were great. Service was quick and friendly. I ordered the pan fried dumplings to start. The dumplings were small but the portions were a little small. For my entr\u00e9e I ordered the kung pao chicken and my S.O. ordered the special fried rice. The kung pao chicken was nearly $13. It wasn't large enough to share. I thought it was amazing but a little pricey. The kung pao chicken came with a small serving of white rice. My S.O.'s fried rice was really great as well. It was also on the small side for $10. Towards the end of our meal, we decided to order another kung pao chicken since we weren't exactly full. I can gripe about the prices all I want and how sitting next to strangers annoys the hell out of me. But one thing is for certain: their food is absolutely delicious. And if sitting next to strangers bothers me that much, I can always order it to go, or have it delivered.

I grew up eating my mom's handmade zhong zi and handmade sticky rice shumai. Being from the bay area, I'm so used to have good Chinese food right at my door step. Right now, I'm based in New Haven and I was desperately craving sticky rice shumai and soup dumplings (xiao long bao). After doing some research, I found that this place had them!I came here for 6 of my friends and was really suspicious when we found that the menu was only in English. That's usually a red flag for Americanized Chinese food. But don't be deterred! We ordered:Steamed Juicy Pork BunsSticky Rice ShumaiScallion PancakeSweet and Sour Cucumber SaladVegetarian Wonton Soup Shanghai-Style Rice CakeChicken with Chinese Broccoli in Brown SauceFried Tofu with Sweet Peppers in Black Bean SauceThe Steamed Juicy Pork Buns, Sticky Rice Shumai and Shanghai-style rice cake were all very good. Not too much soy sauce in the rice cakes but still flavorful. The juicy pork buns were really good - just enough soup in them. Finally, the sticky rice shumai was amazing. While I'm biased and think that my mom's are better, these are more than enough for stick rice in the US. Most places serve cantonese-style shumai. These sticky rice ones are hard to come by here, and authentic! I highly recommend giving it a try.Everything else we ordered was so-so - not very remarkable. The sweet and sour cucumber could be a little sweeter and crisper. The vegetarian wonton soup (eaten by my vegetarian friend) was okay, but what honestly, a lot of the flavor should come from the meat, so I'm not surprised. Overall, I recommend this place, esp for the soup buns/soup dumplings and the sticky rice shumai!!

They have some Chinese-American standbys, but this is by no means in that category. No fried crunchy noodles here. There's dim sum, a good selection of mandarin noodle soups, and everything is generally cooked tasty and fairly light. The large vegetarian selection is also really phenomenal.

It's got a large seating area and it's very fairly priced.Eating there can be convenient or annoying, convenient in that there's always space.

Their prices are very reasonable and the customer service is excellent, constantly ensuring I had a fresh pot of tea. There is also plenty of street parking around the area.

Found Liu's Shanghai based on the good reviews so good friend jumped on the subway to bring back takeout.Shanghai wonton in hot sauce was unusual but very unique & tasty. Usually boiled & served in a spicy sesame sauce. The Liu's fried their with same sauce but the wontons were slightly rolled in a dry crushed peanut & sugar mix. Unusual but it works and the pork filling was very fresh so it was delicious. The fried dumplings were also delicious & served with a garlicky vinaigrette. We also shared noodles with chicken, shrimp, pork in lobster sauce. Add a little red chilli sauce & black vinegar and it's fantastic. \u00a0The noodles in spicy meat sauce was sweet & spicy and the Liu's cook their noodles very well. I've boycotted Joe's Shanghai because you can crack a window with their noodles. Some places over cook their noodles so it's a sticky mess and you can't mix it properly. Bravo to you Mr. Liu for getting your noodles right. And the Kau Fu was delicious, a little bit too sweet but they score points for the lovely tender texture. I've had this in 2 other places and it's always \u00a0been a chewy sponge like texture. Bonus points! For the $36.00 worth of food we purchased, we found 1 complimentary scallion pancake and 2 small containers of coconut tapioca dessert soup. Even the free stuff was flavorful & no skimping on ingredients. Friend says she hopes The Liu's prosper & do well without losing their perspective on ingredients.

It's always a full house the past couple of times I've been there but I was always persistent to wait because they provide such great customer service and to top it off, their soup dumplings are seriously amazing. There is one situation I feel is very important to address. To start off, the menu has a HUGE variety of options to choose from and being the indecisive person that I am, I couldn't decide what type of dishes/appetizers I would like to have for the night. The waitress who took my order was very thorough with describing the dishes. Not only that, but the waitress had asked me, \"What type of dish are you looking for? Noodles, rice dish, etc...\" At that moment, I was in awe. Usually even in 4 star restaurants, waiters/waitresses would just tell you their \"special for the day\" and then resume to asking you what you would like to have. They don't waste any time to ask what type of dish you might be leaning more towards for the night nor do they have the time of day to elicit a minimal conversation. Like I said, it was a full house! There was another table waiting to order but the waitress still made sure to give me the best service possible by taking the time to answer all my questions. Any customer would want a waitress/waiter's undivided attention when it's their turn and I feel that, that is very important in gaining new customers + returning customers. Another thing I noticed was that there was another waiter working and he consistently refilled my tea without me having to ask! Usually, waiters are never aware of the little things like filling up a cup of water and so forth but these little things add up to the great experience and It is safe to say that Liu's Shanghai provides all the little details to make your experience the best possible! Now, let's talk about the food! The food came pretty quick! My soup dumplings came first and right after I was done, my fried peanut butter wontons followed. Let me tell you. These are the best wontons you'll ever taste if you're into a sweet & salty combination! I order 2 of these dishes every time I visit and there are 10 wontons on each plate! They're just THAT delightful! My main entree was also great. One of the best entrees I've had there would definitely be the stir fried rice cake with shredded pork and mushrooms! It is a MUST TRY. To keep this \"kind of\" short and nice, I felt that the waiter & the waitress definitely prioritized well! They keep their customers happy and always make sure all the food are served in a timely manner!
