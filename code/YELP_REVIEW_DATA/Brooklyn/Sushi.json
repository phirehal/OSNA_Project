{"Ki Sushi": [["Chasadie P.", "Please please PLEASE try the lobster tuna roll from this place at least once. The spring green wasabi sauce it rests on is like a perfect cushion to the roll, creamy and not overwhelmingly spicy (save that sauce to dip the rest of your sushi in later!!!). The lobster inside is delicately flavored and contrasts beautifully with the succulent, buttery tuna wrapped around it. And it's all topped with black, gorgeously glistening caviar. \u00a0It's seriously a dreamy, foodgasmic roll!This place rocks. I've been here twice now just to make sure the food and service was consistent. \u00a0Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who enjoys fresh fish,and intimate ambiance."], ["Shannon G.", "3.5 stars- Incredibly tasty sushi but wasn't as blown away as I thought I'd be. Maybe I just ordered the wrong stuff. Anywho, came solo for an early weeknight dinner and walked into what truly felt like an *oasis.* Really. There's a fountain near the entrance and everyone inside is so calm. I ordered the hamachi tartare and the yellowtail tartare. Yes, I couldn't decide which version of the fish I wanted so I ordered both. It was that kind of day. I was expecting more from the hamachi because, well, you're dealing with some awesome fish potential here. But it was just a bit bland. The yellowtail was also slightly lacking. But the sushi rolls were outstanding. I'm coming back to try more specialty rolls the next chance I get. Overall, Ki sushi is a welcome addition to the Smith street dining scene and a much-needed quality sushi restaurant!"], ["Karen F.", "Stop. Staaawp. Hot towels to wash your hands before you eat? Am I on an international flight? I've never been offered at a hot towel at dinner before... I mean, I still had to wash my hands since I'm weird like that, but in all seriousness, what a special touch!My friend and I came here for dinner around 8:00p on a Wednesday night and this place was busy. There were multiple people waiting for tables, and it took us a while to get seated- no problem because the sushi was well worth it!For a glass of wine, salad, miso soup, and a pink lady roll my total was about $35 (not including tip). Is this what it's like to be an adult? HahaThe wine was served in a chilled glass, which was a nice touch, but what got me was the salad! I am a sucker for a good ginger dressing, and this ginger dressing was DELCIOUS! The miso soup was okay... I wouldn't get it again :/ The sushi roll (Pink Lady) speaks volumes for itself- just look at the photo! The salmon was sliced very thin and the tuna melted in your mouth. The roll had to be one of the best rolls I have had in a very long time. I can imagine the sashimi at this place to be very high quality. No wonder Ki was so busy because the sushi is so freaking good! If asked, we would have stayed for dessert and another glass of wine, but no problem- it just means I have something to look forward too next time"], ["C K.", "I have eaten at Ki and the service and ambience is very nice. \u00a0However we primarily are too lazy to go out on Friday nights so we regularly order sushi. \u00a0Ki is our favorite in the area. \u00a0It is definitly more expensive than the others but worth it. \u00a0What makes it special are the rolls. \u00a0The Pink Lady is my fav. Enjoy"], ["Amelia M.", "Hibino was super packed so we opted for here, but I'm glad because we were seated immediately and it was delicious. \u00a0My friend apparently gets takeout here all the time.Simple but solid, tasty sushi. \u00a0I got the miso soup, spicy tuna, and salmon and avocado roll. \u00a0I was happy with the amount given as well because I was definitely full afterwards.And my friend got this crazy friend banana sushi roll dessert with carmel sauce which was amazing."], ["Virginia Y.", "This place is such a hidden gem in Brooklyn! I came during lunch and was welcomed into a peaceful oasis. The restaurant it dimly lit which makes it very intimate. I ended up getting the sashimi lunch special, California uni and Hokkaido uni (which is the FIRST time I've ever seen it in a restaurant!) Their fish was fresh out the ocean alright, every piece of sashimi was great. It came with salmon, tuna, stripe jack and yellowtail. Their uni was fantastic and I was informed that it gets delivered from Japan every Tuesday and Friday morning. I loved being able to compare California uni with Hokkaido uni. In terms of looks and taste, there really is a difference. Japanese uni is much more orange and bright. It has a semisweet after taste that makes it better than California uni. Boy I could only dream of one day going to Japan to eat it on a daily basis.. Both the uni were creamy and fresh, the shapes of the uni were different too based on its origin. While I looked at their menu, I saw they had blue fin tuna from Spain! I didn't have a chance to try it since I was pretty full from the sashimi special that came with a soup, salad, california roll, gyoza ( which was more like shu mai ) and rice. The miso soup was great, you could definitely tell it was made fresh and not packeted miso where people add water to it. The soup even came with enoki mushrooms, that's the first time I've ever seen anyone do that. The California roll was one of the better ones I've had compared to my history of California rolls, the avocado was really fresh and smooth. I could see myself coming back here to try more of their nigiri and possibly omakase. Definitely not a place to miss if you're around the area."], ["Annie C.", "The ambiance in this restaurant is very nice especially for a Brooklyn sushi spot. I love the water wall and the orchids that are decorated around the restaurant giving it a nice zen atmosphere. Word is that Ki Sushi gets their fish flown in straight from Tokyo's famous Tsukiji Market. However, I'm a bit doubtful about that since the restaurant is run by non-Japanese people. We started off with the TNT tuna tartar ($16) as an appetizer. It's basically chopped blue fin toro wrapped with tuna in a truffle soy sauce and topped off with caviar. This was an excellent first dish. The presentation was nice and the tuna tasted fresh. It melts right in your mouth with just the right amount of flavor provided from the truffle soy sauce. We decided to give one of their specialty rolls a try and opted for the Ki roll ($18) due to its popularity. The Ki roll was visually fanciful with the tuna, yellowtail, salmon, spicy crunch king crab, caviar, and a gold leaf on top. However, taste wise it wasn't all that impressive to me. It was definitely lacking in some sort of sauce since it tasted dry. In addition to this, we ordered their supreme omakase for two which included both sushi and sashimi ($55). You have the option for more pieces and variety for an additional price. The nigiri lineup we had included fluke, scallop, amberjack, horse mackerel, Hokkaido uni, and Santa Barbara uni. \u00a0Unlike most omakase places that I've been too, each nigiri here is kept pristine without aging, add-ons or garnishes so we would be able to taste just the fresh flavors from each fish. I loved that we were able to compare both types of uni's. Overall, this is one of the better Japanese restaurants I've been to in Brooklyn and would definitely return. I can understand why this remains as one of Cobble Hill's neighborhood favorite."], ["Sol C.", "Most importantly, be aware that Ki does NOT honor reservation times.We had a reservation for 9 pm on a Saturday night. When we arrived, there were about 10 other groups also waiting to be seated (the restaurant is small), including people who had not yet been seated for 8:30 and 8:45 reservations. That was the first bad sign. The hostess was also not equipped to handle this in the slightest. To everyone who walked in (with or without a reservation) she told them that tables would be available in about 15 minutes, which was blatantly untrue. I also overheard a group come in who had put their name down on the list an hour or so before and she claimed their name had somehow been removed and that their reservation had been lost. Hm....needless to say, they were not pleased.Then a couple who had been waiting for awhile asked her how much longer until their table would be ready and I overheard her let them know that since they had not originally had a reservation she had had to move them further down the list after all the 9 pm reservations arrived. She had done this without bothering to tell them! I was quite shocked by all of this. Extremely unprofessional!!!!! By 9:30 pm we were seated and decided that since we were not likely coming back due to the hot mess over reservations/tables, that we should go all out this one time. We ordered the supreme sushi and sashimi omakase for 2 people (fish flown in from Japan). Thanks to the unbelievable fish, I am giving Ki 4 stars rather than 2 or 3. The fish was superb. Each piece melted in your mouth and it was lovely to get to try so many different types. The toro (fatty tuna) sashimi was incredible, as were the scallop sushi, eel sushi, and yellowtail sashimi. The omakase also came with a delicious oyster. Surprisingly, it did not come with a small salad or miso soup, which I found strange as we were paying $55 per person. Anyway, as I said, it is the excellent quality of fish that saved this rating."], ["Sara L.", "Service was great, attentive and very fast. Food was reasonably priced, and arrived quickly, sushi was fresh and nice variety. My roll however was a bit large, that may not bother other people but I like my sushi to be bite size, and gigantic rolls detract from the experience for me. A solid option for the area."], ["Russell L.", "One of the best in Brooklyn, except for the exorbitant prices. The supreme omakase hasn't changed since I began going there when it opened. Madai, fresh saba - tart, but not overly pickled, the ever so luscious toro, buttery as I've ever had it. And it's like their anago is boneless! It's got like, a fluffy consistency, soft in the mouth. And I never pass up the opportunity to get a Kumamoto oyster with sour ponzu sauce! The shredding, sweet king crab is another gem as is the Hokkaido uni - the latter being denser than its California and Maine counterparts. Something new I found in my omakase was a blowtorched botan ebi with yuzu tobiko. A pleasant surprise! I always make sure to get an extra piece of toro and anago (which come with the supreme).Ignoring the prices, the Fashion roll is great with fresh raw scallop on top, spicy lobster with yellowtail and a sliver of noticeable jalapeno, and yuzu tobiko. So is the peach roll (I'm usually a purist, but sometimes I crave fusion (it's a shameful pleasure). What used to be called the Red River appetizer (now the Tuna Lobster appetizer) is as its (new) name suggests. Spicy lobster wrapped in tuna, no seaweed, no rice. Black caviar and, pointlessly, gold leaf adorn the top. The creaminess of the tuna on lobster is one-note, but pleasant, so it's good, while the black tobiko burst in your mouth.The other ridiculous thing besides the prices is the lighting. Make sure to bring a headlamp. Like, even by date standards, it's dark. And then they have small children running around in this \"romantic\" atmosphere. Weird.Still, it's amazing sushi. The people that call it mediocre, crap, unworthy of takeout are insane. Truly. It's not perfect, but it's damn close."], ["Leonard L.", "Ki SushiNY Brooklyn Cobble Hill1pm 18th May 2015Five StarsI was craving a bento box for lunch and decided to check out Ki Sushi. The place is a bit too warm and pretty dimly lit so I thinking a romantic dinner would be more suitable time to come here. The wait staff was quick and efficient. Ice water with lemon was placed on the table without asking. The waiter unsheathed my chopsticks for me. I ordered the lunch box with chicken teriyaki ($13). First course: Mixed green salad with classic ginger type dressing and a single grape tomato. Second course was a light Miso soup with bits of honshemeji mushrooms. It had a nice flavor without being over salty. Third course: Bento Box: A) two freshly fried gyoza (it was already sauced so I would recommend eating them before they get soggy). They were crispy outside and juicy inside. B) 8 pieces of California Roll. The rice was bit under cooked but had a slight vinegar bite. They use very little Krab meat but whole lot of Avocado which is way better than the other way. C) chicken breast, Japanese squash, Zucchini and broccoli smothered in mildly sweet teriyaki sauce. The chicken varied in size but was moist throughout - a fete for breast meat. The squash added a nice filling element. The broccoli was perfect but the zucchini was overcooked. D) perfectly cooked plain white rice. Everything was delicious and I was able to get in and out in less than 30 minutes. I will return for dinner and actual sushi."], ["Justin W.", "Everything was phenomenal! Thank you!"], ["Tara K.", "We have been meaning to try this Sushi spot for a while. We came on a Saturday around 6pm, just after they opened. \u00a0The ambience is gorgeous, very serene with dim lighting, and a sense of privacy. And even better than this was the very attentive service. Unfortunately I have to give the sushi itself about 2.5 stars, mainly due to one 'Special roll' that we ordered was clearly off & fishy tasting; this basically spoiled the meal for me. \u00a0I wish the chef's could taste test all the fish before they send it out, but I guess that is not realistic. The other rolls we ordered were quite tasty and fresh, although nothing that memorable that I would return for given all the other choices out there.

The decor is truly upmarket while the ambiance seems sophisticated. In reality the price was comparatively to some posh Sushi restaurants around.The Staff are commendable for attentiveness and are genuinely friendly. We were seated right away and we need not have to ask for water ones we got settled (the temperature outside was 85 degrees). We ordered ice cold beer and 2 choices of Sushi rolls which was included in the lunch special that came with Miso soup and Veggie salad with ginger sauce dressing.My tempura and spicy tuna rolls were both delicious and served fresh, I will definitely come back here for a date night. 1 star back for being super dark inside the restaurant. note: not all customers has 20/20 vision!"], ["Valerie L.", "You guys, Ki is where it's at.I'm done paying $100+ for an omakase unless it's my last meal on Earth. Especially when Ki has an omakase for TWO for $58, which is incredible value. Still thinking about the fatty tuna. But I actually think the sushi rolls are where Ki shines. I'll get to that later.Rewinding a bit -- the reason we came to Ki is because I've had it bookmarked for ages. It seemed like a casual but delicious Japanese restaurant that would not cost us an arm and a leg. We had a promotion to celebrate, so we decided to feast.The restaurant was packed, but fortunately for us, the sushi bar was completely empty. We got two seats there and ordered a bunch of things, including...+ TNT truffle ($16) as an appetizer. Chopped blue fin toro with caviar, scallions, and tuna? Oh YES this was good.+ Ki omakase for two ($58). We were deciding between the regular and more expensive supreme omakase (where they air-ship fish from Tsukiji, apparently!) but decided to go the cheaper route. Let's be clear: This wasn't the best or freshest omakase of all time, but it's good and hits the spot at a fraction of the price I'm used to, so I will still recommend it.+ Special rolls: Fancy Roll ($17) with sea urchin and eel is the best roll of MA LIFE. Passion roll ($16) has spicy crunchy scallop with mango, seared salmon, avocado -- good but less unique than the Fancy roll.+ Uni from the a la carte menu (again, not the best I've had, but hits the spot! Do you sense a recurring theme here?)+ Lime and ginger creme brulee -- wonderful way to cap off the meal. Loved the chewy ginger candies on top!Also, service was excellent. Everyone from our waiter to the hostess and sushi chefs were incredibly helpful and nice. Overall, come here if you're looking for good sushi in a casual, fun setting. If you want the best, most ornate omakase, look elsewhere.

Definitely the best in Brooklyn. You cannot go wrong - from the miso soup, seaweed salad (which I don't usually like at other Japanese restaurants), to the sushi or the handmade inaniwa udon soup (great when you are under the weather).The service is top-notch. The food is always nuanced, subtle, fresh and bursting with flavor. We recently had the Supreme Omakase for my spouse's birthday dinner and it was SO fresh, interesting and tasty (Note: we asked them to substitute sea urchin).This is one of the rare restaurants where I can say \"pretty much everything is good\".

In contrast, the Fancy Roll pales in comparison."], ["Yelena K.", "Unpopular Opinion Alert: here goes nothing....Ki is just fine. After reading all the 4/5-star reviews with slight trepidation, we stuck to some of the basics to vet this place out. Basic rolls, some sashimi, nothing crazy. I was surprised how ricey and sticky the rolls were! WAY too much rice. The fish was fresh and delicious, but the rice was overkill. Also, their wasabi here is weird (and I know real wasabi, man).For such mediocrity, they sure do charge Morimoto-style prices. $7.50 for a salmon avocado roll? That's about $3 more than any other sushi joint in all of Brooklyn! Found that to be strange.Still, service was impeccable and everyone was friendly and courteous. The sushi chefs were shmoozy, too, which I like. Will return for Omakase and promise to update this review."], ["Enoch L.", "No words to justify my first visit here!

Just WOW. Omakese is a Japanese phrase that means \"I'll leave it to you\". So basically, we told the chef that we would let him decide what to feed us and boy, oh boy did we make the right choice. All of our fish selections were air shipped from Tokyo, according to the menu, which simply added to our excitement. Once we got our dishes, the server explained what every single piece was and we were in heaven! Worth every penny, the sushi is the freshest sushi and sashimi I have tasted in ages. We had some wine (me = french malbec, and her = pinot grigio). My Malbec was smoooooth and silky. I decided that I will be back to indulge in the greatness of the sushi quality here, once a week. Impeccable experience."], ["Kailey C.", "Freshest sushi in the neighborhood. They get some of their fish flown in from the Tsukiji market in Tokyo, and the Supreme Omakase is to die for. Super fresh, melt in your mouth, flavorful fish, alternating varieties. The regular Ki Omakase is amazing as well. Both leave you wanting more, so order appetizers or a roll or two to accompany. Somewhat high prices but it's worth it.Entrees are great as well, miso black cod is well seasoned and buttery.

In this neighborhood, delivery service was very busy, and I attribute that to a Rainy Monday night.I ordered a few individual pieces, all of the fish was good.My only disappointment was that the Sushi Chef's did not season the rice with Wasabi under the fish. \u00a0I guess I am just used to that presentation and taste, I do wonder why they don't season the fish, but it could be the clientele or the target. \u00a0If they've been asked for years for more wasabi and soy sauce at the table, then they've adjusted to that. I really can't blame them.

I think it's strange to go to a sushi place and not get sushi but the duck is perfectly cooked and absolutely delightful."], ["Edward M.", "This review is mostly centered on the supreme omakase (35?), but I also had a Ki special roll. To start, I wanted to say that this place was really packed. I read a couple of reviews saying that they did not honor their reservations, but I did not have a problem. The waiters and servers were quite attentive and knowledgeable. I was seated at the counter because I wanted the full omakase experience, (one by one) but I didn't expect it. Of course, it did not happen, but I do not blame them one bit. The omakase experience here is very... touched up with business ethics. Of course, this place is not solely an omakase joint because it needs to make business by doing local deliveries and offers specials and etc. I mean, their primarily going to be focused on those regular rolls and local deliveries. Basically, it is like any other sushi joint, except that it serves omakase. I had a couple of appetizers like gyoza, and the toro tartare. It was pretty standard stuff, but the toro tartare, albeit really good and showed me the fresh quality of the fish, was not worth the money. It is about 1/4 the size of my palm for 14 dollars. My advice is get the gyoza if you want, which was pretty good, but skip the toro tartare. As noted above, I talked about the business like ethics of Ki sushi. With that said, the business-like ethics of this sushi joint dis not deter them from serving a great \"supreme omakase.\" Although I did not get the full experience, I got the freshest fish available and the best tasting items available. **side note: In a full experience omakase, the chef hands you the pieces one by one and makes sure he caters to your taste buds. That is why, the most special pieces are not served at the beginning of the meal. He has to make sure to get the exact ratio of wasabi, soy sauce, etc. At ki sushi, and I suspect at every other classier sushi joint that offers omakase, you will get all the pieces in a plate which will be delivered to you by a waiter. Of course, as I said, this version of the omakase does not mean it is any less tasty. There were 4 super special pieces along with 5 other pieces. Golden eyed snapperCalifornia UniToroScallopThe other five were:Arctic somethingSabaSomething MackerelAmberjackSomethingI really enjoyed every single one of their special nigiri pieces. I cannot stress the quality of ingredients used. My favorite of course was the Uni, but the Golden eyed snapper was very good too. I suspect that umami taste came from a torch though. The toro was on point and so was the scallop. I did not have high expectations for the scallop, but I was proven wrong. The regular pieces were quite delicious too, except that I do not like mackerel at all. To me, it always tastes so fishy, and honestly, I have had mackerel at top tier sushi joints, and they are also fishy. I think it is just the nature of the mackerel to be fishy. Overall, these things were quite delicious, and so I asked for another piece of California Uni and golden eyed snapper and then another Ki roll. For the uni, they had wanted me to try Hokkaido uni instead, but charged me for a California uni, which was very very nice of them. The hokkaido uni was just as good as the California uni, but it has a distinct flavor which tasted more like an ocean breeze. I loved it. Now for the Ki roll.... to me, it was like a special roll from any other sushi joint's. This is where the -1 star comes from. No offense, ki sushi, but you guys served me an greatomakase, and I'm sure your Ki roll tastes amazing to people who haven't had your omakase but it pretty much showed me the difference between the quality of fish used in your regular orders and the omakase. Like I said before, if you are not coming here for the omakase, then you are coming to just another sushi joint. I'm not trying to say don't come here for rolls, but the supreme omakase is THE thing to get here. So if you really want to see what the hype with this place is, or if you REALLY want to taste superbly made sushi, don't get the regular sushi rolls, drop some extra cash and try the supreme omakase. I am definitely going to recommend this place for Omakase. I will be back to try the Ki omakase, which is not made with ingredients flown in from japan."], ["Sarah G.", "I'm not sure what took me so long to discover this place. I pass it every day on the way to work and they're known for great delivery. But I finally went for dinner and it was well worth the wait of 30 minutes on a Friday.The reason I passed it so many times without looking up? You'd barely notice it. The restaurant is typical New York (deep, not wide) and barely takes up much storespace. But once you're inside it's cool and perfect for sushi consumption. The price? Moderate. The service? Fine. The food? Amazing. I'm not one to spend hundreds of dollars on raw fish, so I can confidently say this is the best under $40 sushi meal I've had east of the Mississippi. Really anything you order will be fresh and melt-in-your-mouth good. If you're a person who orders delivery in Cobble Hill (I'm looking at you, parents) then why leave the house?

I will try to piggy-back off of what everyone else is saying without being too repetitive. Let's just let it be known that Ki puts the ISH in fish. I was visiting Brooklyn for the day with my mother. It was her birthday and we were both craving sushi. Having somewhat solid sushi joints in Long Island, I was hoping to stumble upon a decent lunch spot during my travels. Seeing as Ki was so highly-praised, we had to eat here. Their ambiance really separates itself from other sushi restaurants. With the sounds of cascading water and low lighting, I truly felt relaxed. Feng shui just radiates from here. It was decently crowded for a Wednesday lunch but we were lucky enough to get a seat right near the window. Their lunch prices are extremely reasonable considering what they give you for your meal. It was $12 for a chicken teriyaki bento box.Here's what a $12 lunch includes at Ki:-Ridiculously good miso soup-Ginger Salad-Chicken Teriyaki, White Rice with black sesame, 2 Gyoza, steamed veggies (that included butternut squash. unusually amazing pairing), and a california roll.*The food looks so artfully prepared. You can tell it was made with precision, care and only the freshest of ingredients. What I appreciated most was the amount of fish to rice ratio. And that they give you 8 pieces instead of 6. Many places skimp on the fish but not Ki. I was not only thoroughly impressed with that but also on the aesthetics on the plating! If you're a big green tea drinker like me... there's unlimited re-fills. Huzzah!Ki, you have now climbed your way to the top of my list of \"favorite sushi places\". *If you'd like you can substitute your california roll with another for an additional charge. I was craving the philly roll and it only cost $2 extra. Don't be afraid to ask!!"], ["Diana C.", "My friend Danny literally could not stop giggling after taking a bite into the uni from Ki. He looked like the happiest kid on earth. Then again, he just admitted to me today that he has a serious uni addiction. Today was like 5th day in a row he needs Uni. Someone put him in UA.All jokes aside, I was thoroughly impressed with Ki Sushi. The warm mushroom salad was absolutely delicious - what a great way start the meal. I highly recommend this! Truffle oil heaven.For the rolls we had the Naruto (cucumber wrapped choice of fish, we picked salmon) and the TNT which was made with toro. \u00a0TNT was much better than the Naruto. Not a huge fan of cucumber wrapped rolls, the cucumber takes away from the fish.We also order blue fin toro from Spain and it was uh-amazing. Melted in my mouth.Everything tasted better with a warm bottle of sake.Service was great as well. This is definitely a bit pricier than other sushi restaurants, but the quality is also of a different caliber. Worth every penny!PS - lunch specials are the best in value!!"], ["Meg H.", "Ki Sushi is very quickly becoming a Friday Night ritual for me. After an hour of burning down the road at Brooklyn Bodyburn, we head down the road to Ki to sabotage all of our hard work.Any of their rolls or apps with truffle will make you weak in the knees (Side note: This is coming from someone who thinks truffle is overhyped and a buzzword for foodie amateurs). The Peach roll is fresh, clean and delicious- the mushroom soup is a perfect starter for a cold night.If you find yourself wandering Smith St in Cobble Hill stop by for what I consider the best sushi NYC has to offer!"], ["Faye B.", "Used to be great.....got really sick eating there last 2x. No more ki for me"], ["Julia R.", "Solid, but not spectacular last couple of times I've been."], ["April C.", "Must come back."], ["Allan C.", "Not impressedWe got the omakase - which, for 35pp, is a pretty good deal. The fish wasn't bad at all. Good selection- scallop was nice and fresh. Seared fatty tuna was tasty as well. The problem was the sushi rice. Not flavorful, dry and overcooked, fell apart and in chunks. The rolls here might be good but I wouldn't recommend the omakase.We got our son the vegetable udon soup. Which turned out to be Chinese egg noodles. Why call it udon if you don't use udon noodles? My son is two so it's not a big deal, but really?"], ["M L.", "Amazing sushi!! Best in Brooklyn, the freshest fish. The service is wonderful too, a gem."], ["G C.", "Good sushi. A little bit on the pricy side but hey, you're in Boerum Hill. Had the omakase. It was your garden variety of sushi and sashimi but it was good quality."], ["Julia N.", "What a decadent dinner from start to finish! I'm a long time sushi lover and critic. I've have had sushi in many countries and states and this maybe one of the best places I've eaten. The fish is extremely fresh. The TNT lovers roll is so perfect. This place may actually beat out Nobu and blue ribbon... The service was also quick and friendly.. The best part: we made a reservation and were seating immediately ( when is the last time that happens??!?)"], ["Jp M.", "We have visited Ki since it opened many years ago and the food quality and flavor consistency has remained high \u00a0- we sat at the bar last night and the owner was working away doing what he loves and watching his staff like a hawk - he worked in another Sushi restaurant on Court for many years so he paid his dues before he opened his own place on Smith.Great service as others have commented - we were in and out in 45 mins (no dessert).A real deal neighborhood staple. Special shout out for the Volcano roll 'twas crunchy and delish."], ["Lisa D.", "Ki is my current vote for best sushi in Brooklyn. I've been here for both a tranquil weekday lunch and a group dinner amid a more energetic (and packed) dining room. Considering the quality of the fish and other ingredients and the beautiful presentation, the two roll combo lunch special is a steal here compared to that of the standard issue sushi places that fill this borough. The miso soup is a piping hot generous portion, with a rich mouthfeel, sprinkled with Einoki mushrooms, fresh tofu, seaweed, and scallions, and the salad, topped with a vibrant homemade ginger dressing, was made with fresh greens rather than the typical iceberg. My friend and I really enjoyed the salmon and spicy tuna rolls. The chef even accommodated my friend's three (arguably price-altering) alterations/additions to her sushi rolls for no additional charge.For dinner, I sampled some of the crispy, pan-fried Gyoza as well as a beautiful array of Nigiri, my favorites of which were the Salmon, Arctic Char, Yellowtail, and Spanish Mackerel. My more adventurous friends really enjoyed the Uni and fatty tuna. \u00a0I also experienced the signature Ki roll, which, consisting of generous amounts of tuna, salmon, and yellowtail, topped with spicy, crunchy king crab, avocado, and caviar in the color combination made famous in the Stendhal novel, and finished off with a gold leaf, resembles a gifted jewel box filled with treasures from the sea."], ["Kisha E.", "I've just had lunch here for the third time in three days, and it is so delicious. The fish is fresh, the broiled cod is top notch, and I really enjoyed the salmon skin salad. \u00a0I can't wait to continue exploring their menu. Oh, and try the Fantastic Roll. It lives up to the name."], ["Heather T.", "I came here for lunch when a colleague recommended it highly. For $16, I ordered the sashimi lunch ( it comes with two shumai, a salad, miso soup, rice, a california roll, and a variety of super-fresh sashimi).Everything was lovely - the price was a bit much for lunch (I wished there was a \"sashimi lunch\" option that was just miso and sashimi...) - but I cant complain on a day I knew I wanted to splurge. The quality was great... The wait for food took a while (they dont have a menu online, so I walked there, ordered, and had to wait for it. Next time, I know what to get!)... so if this is your first time, factor that into your arrival and bring home a takeout menu!I look forward to heading back there in summer, when its too hot to put anything steaming into your mouth mid-day."], ["R Y.", "Came here for dinner with an old friend. We ordered the supreme sashimi omakase, TNT roll, and Ki roll. The ambiance was very relaxing with nice decor. Can't say much about the service since it was our servers first day on the job. She was nice though. The rolls were completely 'meh' in my opinion. The presentations looked great, the Ki roll even had some gold flakes on it. Very beautiful for photography and looks pretty appetizing. But after putting it in my mouth, the rice was sticky, slimy, and chewy. Then the 'roll' broke into pieces all over my plate. The last time I had this kind of rice in sushi was when I got sushi from the grocery store.The TNT roll was also pretty unremarkable. The sashimi omakase is worth trying. The fish was fresh and tasty, and I would order it again. As far as the sushi, I would not recommend it if you prefer authentic Japanese-tasting rolls."], ["Anthony T.", "I've been to Ki Sushi twice. I'm a hard core lover of anything chicken teriyaki and Ki Sushi certainly did not disappoint in that regard. I wouldn't say it was exceptional, but on par with most other good Japanese restaurants that I've frequented in my time.Each time we had the same waiter. He was incredibly friendly and nice and definitely set the tone for having a comfortable dining experience. It's something that I appreciate very much and made it quite evident with my tip.The interior has a very romantic setting. I went with my girlfriend so the atmosphere was proper for the two of us. However, if I were in the mood to get Japanese with a friend, I'm not certain how the intimate environment would suit. Oh, and the first time we went, our hostess had quite an attitude; I was very pleased to not see her the second time around. Good job on that part, Ki Sushi. I like seeing proper changes made (Or it could have just been her day off. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt)."], ["Mike C.", "The ambience and service elevate this place from being just another mediocre sushi joint with a bunch of funky eel-sauce covered, tempura-flake-filled special rolls.Sure, these rolls tasted pretty good, but they really weren't anything special, and are definitely on the more expensive side.We got the Salmon Skin Roll ($5), one of my standby favorites, which was done pretty well here. The Dragon ($11) was a little bland, and nowhere near some of the better ones I've had. The Peach Roll ($13) sounded interesting, as it had sliced peaches on top, along with tuna, avocado and caviar inside. I expected the deliciousness that you often get with combos like these, such as the more commonplace rolls that are made with mango, but this one also tasted kind of bland. Maybe the peaches were going bad or something, I dunno. Lastly, I also had the Angel Roll ($16), which was definitely the best one. This had seared tuna and asparagus inside, along with salmon, avocado, eel and tobiko on top. This was the tastiest of all, mostly owing to the eel and the eel sauce slathered all over the top.As mentioned above, the atmosphere in here is very nice. It is dark and intimate, and would serve well for a nice date, or a night out on the town alone to sit at the sushi bar. The service was also very good. There seemed to be an army of waiters and busboys that refilled my tea every time I took a sip, but they did it in a nice, non-obtrusive way that I appreciated, even though I had to go to the bathroom constantly for the rest of the night (also, this is another huge plus, as it wasn't one of those annoying sushi places that charges you $5 for a tiny pot of tea that gives you two cups worth).I guess I might come back here, maybe to try the omakase next time or at least get some of the sushi pieces instead of the special rolls."], ["Tanya M.", "I've been so Ki Sushi a few times and the service has always been incredible. Highly recommend the Ki Roll -- it even comes with gold flakes on top! Delicious! It's a bit pricer than the rest of the area, but TOTALLY worth it. The decor isn't fancy, but it's cozy and clean. The fish is fresh and their chefs are really friendly and happy people in general. It's my favorite sushi place in NYC!"], ["Rach W.", "Excellent service, nice romantic atmosphere, fresh and delicious sushi. More at the $$$ price range but we'll worth the price. The special rolls are amazing. Will definitely return back."], ["Charmed O.", "I come here for the pretty fancy decorated special rolls and great value lunch special deal. They make really good special rolls. I wouldn't come here for regular sushi though because I have had better. The staff are polite and service is pretty good. I enjoy their green tea. The black cod entre is very good.My favorite items are:- TNT Truffle (appetizer)- Mushroom salad (it's just good!)- Seafood DynamiteRolls: TNT lover and Ki Roll. \u00a0They are all awesome!I feel like they are very consistent with their food and service."], ["Jared W.", "Probably one of my favorite sushi restaurants anywhere.

Seriously the waiters are on top of their game at this place. The atmosphere is nice and casual. The food is good. The miso eggplant was great as well as the black cod and the TNT roll was def a winner. The yellowtail tartare had great flavor but it needed some type of crunch to it and the portion although an app was a bit small. The only thing I really didn't like was the warm mushroom salad. It had barely any lettuce and the mushrooms and the sauce were too overpowering. Otherwise it was a nice experience."], ["Jane S.", "Sushi is great--best in the neighborhood, and this is thankfully clean; but why is it so dark in here? Does it need to be an underground burial cave?"], ["Cynthia M.", "Very accommodating and quick service. I came here for lunch today and inquired on if they had any rolls without rice. The server suggested the roll lunch special and my two rolls could be done as hand rolls without rice. I opted for the shrimp avocado and the eel avocado hand rolls and both were quite generous in fillings and delicious. The lunch special also came with both a soup and salad and I was actually quite full at the end of my meal.

There are better places if you really like tempura, but Ki Sushi has reached the standard for the price, no complaint! Had tried the Ki Roll and Foxy Lady, really unique and tasty rolls. You can actually enjoy and taste what's in it. It is not like some other sushi place, a roll means a big scoop of rice with some raw meat. Setting was ambient and the service is just about average, will definitely come back for more, yum :P"], ["Jade D.", "My favorite sushi spot in the cobble hill area and among the top in NYC. Their Omakase for $30 is a steal as are their lunch specials. They fly their fish in from Japan and it is consistently fresh. Always have had good service & their sushi chefs are friendly. Never had a problem with delivery either. The space is simple and cozy with a touch of high end decor that makes it a perfect ambiance for a casual or more special meal.Highly recommend Ki Sushi!"], ["Christine K.", "This was our go-to place while living in Cobble Hill for sushi. We lived pretty close so we would pick up quite often too, which was quicker than getting it delivered. Always fresh and satisfying, it's the best sushi place in the area. The waiter who often waited on us was very friendly and treated us with extra care since we were regulars. There are always kids in there too for early dinner. My 3 year old daughter always loved the edamame, miso soup with rice, teriyaki chicken, cod, and eventually she liked salmon rolls too (always ask for no wasabi on the inside). She always ate well so that we could get our sushi fix!"], ["Danielle T.", "It's obviously more expensive than your average sushi spot in Brooklyn but it was fresh, pieces were large, and you get a really tasty sushi. \u00a0The rolls were interesting too. I'm borderline between three stars and four because three seems bad. But it wasn't amazing but I'm impressed and wouldn't mind going again. Nice atmosphere vs a quick sushi restaurant for 3$ a roll. Omakase looks worth it!"], ["Pegah Y.", "We were very impressed by Ki Sushi. \u00a0We were wandering around Cobble Hill, looking for a good place to eat, and I found this place on Yelp. \u00a0Seeing as how it had gotten 4 stars with hundreds of reviews on Yelp, I thought it couldn't be bad, so we decided to check it out. \u00a0We were both skeptical at first, given the prices and the fact that this place looked \"trendy\" in the sense that it was trying a bit too hard to be cool. \u00a0However, once we had our first bite of sushi, we were both sold.Between the two of us, we ordered the garden salad (extremely fresh and a very generous portion for just $3, and it came with an amazing ginger salad dressing that was like none other), spicy tuna roll (so fresh and very large and generous 8 pieces, full of fish), spicy salmon roll (again, very delicious, large, and generous!), Pink Lady roll (salmon tempura, yellowtail, tuna avocado and masago roll in soy bean paper) and the Fashion roll (spicy lobster, yellowtail jalapeno topped with yuzu tobiko and fresh scallop). \u00a0The Fashion roll was by far my favorite - the spicy lobster and the combination it came with was just simply out of this world. \u00a0There were fireworks in my mouth. \u00a0Wow!We were very impressed with Ki Sushi. \u00a0The fish was fresh, the portions were generous, and customers truly get their money's worth. \u00a0It is my new favorite sushi restaurant in NYC. \u00a0Amazing!"], ["Lina M.", "This isn't just the best sushi in Brooklyn, it's the best sushi I've had anywhere in the country.

Food is good - eat in or take out, it travels well!Service is good.Best Japanese in the area that we have been to - we haven't been to them all - once we found Ki we stuck with it.If it's crowded, it's noisy - go early if you want a quiet dinner."], ["William W.", "Wow, this place really surprised me. Came here with my friend from Oklahoma - he's landlocked so I decided to get him in touch with some Japanese food, specifically sushi here in NYC. We went for the omakase - supposedly they air ship it from Tsukiji Market in Tokyo but then again I don't know how real that is, considering the price of the omakase but hey, I don't need to complain about 35 USD. The omakase itself turned out to be really good - the tuna was really the star of the show - so much so that we decided to order four more pieces of tuna nigiri a la carte. It was super fresh - just melt in your mouth good.I will say though that this is not \"authentic Japanese sushi\" because they still give you a healthy heaping of wasabi and soy sauce which most authentic places would just place it in and on top of the sushi piece, respectively, but I'm just nitpicking now. Service was good, and I liked the ambiance. Overall I highly recommend and I will be back!"], ["Alex D.", "I pretty much go to Ki sushi only. Why? Because I know I will always get the best sushi and fresh fish even in summer time . Try their lobster tuna roll it's the killer on the menu.Never tried anything more creative.

At $16 something (tax included) their salmon sushi lunch special (6 pieces of sushi + 1 roll + soup + salad) is a good deal. Especially if you are craving sushi but don't want to drop major $$$.I ordered take-out and the devil was in the details with their small soy sauce dish; packets of regular and less-sodium soy sauce; a real plant leaf served as the divider between the sushi and the roll instead of the usual fake, plastic grass you may get elsewhere; and thick napkins = major approval"], ["Tanya G.", "Great service and delicious sushi.

We got in at 7:30 on a Friday night and waited about 30 minutes for a party of 3. You can leave your number with them so they call you when there's a table that opens up. I ordered the Ki Roll... there's plenty of pictures posted of it and yes it is delicious. My friends ordered the ice cream tempura and spicy girl (grill?) roll. The rolls here are huggeee. They're about 1/3 bigger than the usual rolls and the price reflects that. Although the rolls are bigger, I don't think it justifies the premium of their sushi. My friend ended up paying about $32 for 2 rolls at this place... you can eat AYCE pretty good sushi for less than that.Overall food, ambience, and service were good but the price dampens my enthusiasm for this place significantly."], ["Gee B.", "The hype here might be because it's dark inside (feels like a lounge, probably to hide the grease and dirt) and that there aren't a lot of Japanese restaurants to choose from in the area. The sushi here is below average. We made reservation for a birthday dinner and they made us wait an hour before seating us. Their reservation is a total sack of bull-s__t. They don't honor it. It was Friday night and we thought we were being smart by reserving a table. It didn't matter, people who walked in behind us got the same wait.

I also looked past my own gluten-intolerance for once and happily devoured those hot little tako balls that are definitely not to be missed. All the sushi bombs (little half balls of rice topped with various fishes and fresh sauces) are delicious as well and highly recommended.The space is dark and cozy; a great date spot or good place to have an actual conversation with a friend."], ["Theresa B.", "This restaurant was very cool. It seems super tiny from the inside then you walk all the way back and see this huge outdoor/deck area!

We also ordered a seaweed salad which was different than a typical seaweed salad but very good. Lastly we ordered a this sushi special and each piece we got was so amazing!

Thank you yelp for helping me find another good place to eat!!"], ["Sarah R.", "Came on an early Wednesday night just a few minutes before they opened so we had the place to ourselves. Ordered a bunch of stuff to share: shrimp with kataifi which is a type of shredded dough (very good), pork betty (melted in our mouths with just the right amount of wasabi mayo), pork cutlet curry, and the party bomb special.

We had made reservations for 8 pm so we were seated promptly. The best items on the menu (as far as I'm concerned) are the pork betty (a deliciously sliced warm pork belly that just meeeelts in your mouth) and the party bombs (as others have described, a sort of Reese's cup-shaped nigiri sushi). Party bombs were packed with incredible flavor and the rice they use is good, yet I found myself wanting to order a second helping of the pork betty- it was that good. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the regular sushi rolls themselves as they really did not stand out from other sushi places I've been to. Overall, I'm a fan of the interior. It's fairly dimly lit, not too loud, with several different seating areas (at the bar, along the sides surrounding the bar, and a back (patio?) area. It's therefore a good setting whether you want to go with friends, a casual date, or by yourself. The staff was nice and attentive and the menu prices were reasonable. I'd come back if I lived closer to it."], ["Sheryl W.", "Get the sushi. Very good. I enjoyed the chicken. Not outstanding but enjoyable. Pork belly was good. Steak skewers were ok.

Very good customer service."], ["Bonnie C.", "Sushi bombs are da bomb! It's slightly different than the neighborhood sushi joint; the sushi come in rolled up balls that are nicely executed with familiar ingredients. For dinner we got the party bomb (12 pieces of assorted bombs), pork betty (unsure if this is a misspelling on the menu), and salmon and hotate cerviche. I find the 3 soy sauces interesting, I forgot what each flavor is but I think the spicy one taste the best. It's different without being gimmicky, so it's worth a try. One con is that Bozu had a really weak AC. It was hot in the restaurant and we were served room temp water. Throughout our meal we were waiting for people to enter so the breeze from the door can hit us- uggh."], ["Valerie C.", "Really solid, unique sushi fusion. Definitely recommend pairing some sake with the sushi bombs. I had never seen anything like it! And definitely recommend trying one of the combination bomb platters. Great food!

Will come back again!"], ["Patrick V.", "I came here to celebrate my girlfriends birthday last weekend and I can tell you off the bat that the place is definitely suited for a date to eat fancy tasty Japanese fusion cuisine. The decor is inviting and there is a backyard patio that is cozy.The food was delicious although not as generous as I would have liked. If your used to eating like a bird then it's fine but I'm a hungry man and well, your dish will be dissapointing if your expecting to be full.The fried chicken was delicious and tasty. You'll need to ask for rice separately if you want. The Pork Belly is a hit although the serving I got was sliced alot thinner than some of the pictures shown on yelp. Salmon IMO is not worth it because it's a very small serving, good for anorexic folks. Sushi tasted awesome and they especially have a good selection of vegetarian rolls.Service was excellent though, staff is attentive and will not rush you out. Price is reasonable. I would recommend to anyone trying to impress on a first date but not recommend to someone looking for big portions."], ["Mai H.", "Ordered a few things for the table such as the Pork Betty (so soo good), brussel sprouts and some of the other veggie dishes like kombucha (Japanese squash). I got a few tuna rolls and a salmon thing with uni that was to die for! My friend got the curry over rice and the thing was massive! I was too full at that point to try it but it looked pretty good. Should have tried the sushi bombs!We arrived at about fish so it wasn't so busy but was packed by the time we left at around 7PM. Service was good but was disappointed that the tea we got wasn't loose leaf,just plain ol tea bag, although we did get a hot water refill once.

Of course i am. Now if you were offended by my last comment about hipsters, chances are you're going to keep on scrolling to the next review by joe smoe. If you weren't, you've became intrigued, interested and maybe even slightly turned on? Who knows but by this point, your eyes can't help but read on and find out what this reviewer has to say. It's like opening those Pistachio nuts that wouldn't give it up then.... boom.. success! You're going to like my nuts. Like any other sushi joints, you'll want to sit at the bar. That's where the magic happens. It also helps that the main area looks sexy with a low-key feel. \u00a0On a Saturday night without reservations, we weren't so lucky and was seated at the lower part of the patio. Waitstaff was definitely not lacking in the hospitality department as they were pleasant and helpful with all of our request.Taking a look at the specials, we chose the fried brussel sprouts with curry spice as well as the 3 types of fish sashimi appetizer. The sprouts were light tasting even thou being fried made it a perfect dish to start off with. While the sashimi were room temperature, they were still fresh and for about 18 dollars, you get 12 pieces total on a dressed up plate. Great for sharing.We also got the Tako balls ( octopus ) that came with 7 pieces which were tasty. I'd pass on the tuna tar tar if you're more into the chunkier version thou the whipped avocado wasabi sauce that it accompanied it was very creative.Bozu's draw would be their sushi \" bomb\". Think upside down Reese peanut butter cup shape but slightly smaller. An un-traditional idea but seems to work as you can pack in the flavor for a more explosive bite of sushi. We were almost getting full by this point so making the decision of al la carte was genius. It doesn't seem like you can go wrong with any bomb and they were all pretty good. Out of the ones we ordered, the most memorable one for me was the Hotate (scallop) bomb. You can actually taste the sweetness which indicates freshness. They also had a ootoro bomb ( fatty tuna) for about 13 dollars for 3 pieces. That's a skip if you've already taste what really good ootoro should taste like. This was nothing like it and just tasted oily. I enjoyed this place and so will you. How are you liking my nuts, now?"], ["Yan W.", "The food was okay, but honestly, I thought it was a little overpriced and not worth a trip if you are from far away. \u00a0I would honestly pay more to go to a different establishment that had a better flavor profile. \u00a0Most of the sushi and the raw fish dishes were a little bit slimy. \u00a0The sushi rice is also a little crunchy. \u00a0The bombs were pretty tastless. I did not like the pre mixed wasabi and soy sauces. I just want wasabi, thanks. We're in America and I want my freedom. The shumai tasted pre-packaged. The best dish by far was the appetizer beef kabobs. I don't drink, and I understand that you have to overpour in Japanese culture. \u00a0However, I sat at the bar and I literally saw the bartender pour out probably hundreds of dollars of over poured alcohol. That's probably why I paid more for my dinner I thought."], ["Jonille T.", "The sushi here was exquisite! I enjoyed a tasty glass of unfiltered sake, which they overflow-poured from a masu box into a saucer. I had the pork belly to start, and the 12 sushi bomb plate. Everything was fresh and flavorful, with innovative ideas and very interesting plating. For dessert, I had a delicious panna cotta.I subtracted a star because service was very slow and distracted on an only sort-of-busy night (it was a Thursday)."], ["Michael H.", "One of the best Japanese restaurants in all of NYC and Brooklyn. The fish is very fresh and everything is delicious. The place is pretty big so I never had trouble getting a table. The most I ever had to wait was 5-10 minutes. Personal favorites: Salmon & Tuna guacamole rolls, Bozu Salad, Party Bomb, Chocolate Mousse. The party Bomb is what they are apparently known for, and it exceeded my expectations. The Sushi Bombs in general are a must here; They are single handedly the reason I keep coming back!Overall, great Japanese restaurant! Definitely worth visiting at some point!"], ["Kimberly P.", "HOOKED! Definitely worth the 40+ min drive from Long Island! I came here for a sexy yet simple dinner and that is EXACTLY what I got. I would recommend making reservations especially over the weekend since it gets busy REAL quick.1. Tuna Tataki - delicious and complimented with the perfect amount of deliciously-dressed salad. 2. Fried Tako Ball - surprisingly one of my favorite dishes! The drizzled sauces were so addictive! I couldn't help but smother each bite with as much sauce as possible.3. Party bomb with Ikura bomb - comes with 3 different bombs (Mc Low, Spicy Mc and Pink Bombs). Every single bomb was amazing! My favorite was the Spicy Mc Bomb - so fantastic with just the right amount of spicy mayo. I loved it so much I ordered another bomb. I also loved how the restaurant already prepared a range of soy sauces with varying levels of wasabi. I found it so endearing.4. Hotate Bomb - this was my date's favorite dish. Succulent pieces of scallops with ginger! It was a little too spicy for my taste, but my date had no problem devouring it.All in all, I can't wait to come back! Highly recommended!"], ["Talia R.", "Reliable and reliably good Williamsburg sushi. \u00a0All the standard hits (though in circular format), relaxed service, quiet space."], ["Julio C.", "Eating here at bozu, was an amazing experience.

So we placed a delivery order for:-Inaka Roll (snow crab, eel, shrimp tempura and avocado)-Sakura Roll (spicy salmon)-Spicy Scallop Roll-Salmon Skin Salad-Grilled SquidWith that, we got a free Dragon Roll. Delivery was on the slower side (just made it under the time estimate).But none of the sushi was actually that good.

You can get only what you can get... and so far this is one of the few sushi places I'd consider going to here.Good presentation and decent quality sushi. Bento boxes here as pretty much as you should expect, cali roll and various small plates served up on a single platter. Beef negimaki and chicken katsu. Both were quite good and sufficient quantity. \u00a0Also they do lunch specials, if you happen to be around."], ["Shelton H.", "We order delivery from here nearly every week and I've been in several times as well.

The options are wide and wonderful. Although sometimes orders can get a lil confused on the way to me I'm blaming online ordering websites for that one. A few times my request for hand rolls won't go through and instead I'll receive maki rolls, but that's not a big deal. The sushi isn't the most amazing, but it's definitely the best deal for your buck.If you do go to the restaurant it has a very modern interior, and even the plating of the dishes is fancy.

The sushi was very fresh and clean tasting, and the presentation was still very nice to receive. \u00a0The rock shrimp though - omg, I could eat a plate of that alone! \u00a0That spicy sauce is really addicting, and those shrimps were fried to happy perfection.The staff was very nice, attentive, and didn't rush me out the door. \u00a0Thanks for continuously filling my tea cup with green tea goodness. \u00a0I'd like to come back here with my better half, but the parking situation is always cumbersome."], ["Ruby B.", "Excellent food and service!Loved the white dragon roll and sunset roll.

And I would never say no to sushi) and I've always ordered an abundance of rolls and bento boxes.Chicken Teriyaki bento box - comes with edamame, california sushi roll, and also the chicken teriyaki. It was okay, not bad. But it wasn't anything wowing. The main part of this bento box would be the chicken teriyaki, and I found it to be quite dry and flavorless.The tempura bento box - The tempura was yummy, but anything fried is almost always good unless you burn it.Overall though, I felt the bento boxes were just meh. Nothing special and not especially worth around $10 or so.The sushi rolls I ordered were all specials, and although none was amazing again. The taste of all of them was just mediocre and presentation wasn't anything to be in awe of either.The sashimi platter I ordered was fresh though, so I can say that they have fresh fish.Overall, I was satisfied with my take out orders every time, but I would prefer to order from a cheaper sushi joint actually, because the quality is the same."], ["Nancy R.", "I've dined in and ordered from this place a few times.

It is surprisingly glamorous for a brooklyn sushi restaurant. It has just the right amount of sparkle without being too girly. In terms of food it is pretty good but not the best. The salmon sashimi is about 5mm thick which I believe is too thin. I prefer my sashimi fat and thick....jk! Everything else was just alright. I took off 1 star because of the soy sauce. It is definitely different, way too salty to be sushi soy sauce. The curry chicken was surprisingly good. It had a nice blend of coconut and curry perfectly flavored together. Will definitely be returning!"], ["Anastasiya M.", "This place is great. Every time I am in the neighborhood, I always end up eating here and it's amazing. All the products are fresh. Their wine selection is huge, so it's great for drunkies, although many are imported - either Japanese or something else. I just stick to my Chardonnay.

First, the bento box portions are huge - I could eat 2 meals with 1 bento box. Their katsu is just the right amount of breaded and crunchy and the teriyaki is always savory and delicious. The astounding thing is I ordered delivery from here and I'm about 20 blocks away and yet it arrived within the estimated time range so kudos to them for efficient and fast service. This place is awesome."], ["Jane M.", "#1 I'm really impressed with how quickly they delivered their food. It literally came in like 20 minutes and the delivery guy was super nice. It was a really cold day and he felt bad that I had to step outside to get the food from him! Anyway, I ordered the lunch special from here. I had 3 rolls: spicy tuna, salmon avocado and lobster salad with avocado. I was impressed that they even offered a roll with lobster salad in their lunch special because that usually doesn't happen AND it was really good, next time I think I will order only 3 rolls of that. I also ordered the beef teriyaki for my brother. Although I don't know what it tastes like, he really liked it. I appreciated that they had edamame in their lunch bento box. Overall, quick delivery and good food. I will definitely order here again and hopefully I'll be able to stop by the restaurant to eat in, in the near future."], ["Franny A.", "I was surprised at the very stellar reviews until I saw the sushi. First came the bland miso like soup \u00a0similar to Fushimi's but more innocuous. Iceberg lettuce salad with unripe tomato was ok. The cushy interior and well presented fish compensates for serviceable albeit beautifully presented fish. Although Fushimi is Chinese owned as well it's disco like interior and creative rolls definitely make up for the lack of authenticity. Cheap lunch special at Inaka! Bay Ridge deserves better Japanese."], ["Gabi A.", "Lunch special is the bomb here. Had extra time for lunch the other day so I decided to come here.

The sushi for two dinner is the way to go. It's enough to satiate two avg. eaters but I typically add one or two appetizers to round out the experience. Soft tofu with fried renkon salad, oyster with ponzu.I used to live in the city near Tokyo where their sister restaurant is located but I never went there. I'll definitely stop in next time I visit."], ["Joel B.", "My first time here and they absolutely crushed it for fri lunch. I eat a lot of sushi, so I wouldn't lead you astray.

Don't see how you could do any better in the neighborhood for upscale sushi."], ["Sofia S.", "Very underwhelmed with this place. The reviews are so spectacular I forewent my favorite spot to try this place. Ginger salad dressing was not at all gingery and boring. The rolls are more rice than anything else and the fish is bland. Spicy mayo didn't have much flavor and they put a speck of shrimp in my boston roll. If you want a great roll and great service go to Kiku on 7th Ave between 10th and 11th street, way better quality"], ["Sol C.", "I came to Taro and placed an order to go. The restaurant was not particularly busy as it was lunchtime on a weekday so mistakenly I did not let them know that I had an appointment to make and only had about 45 minutes. Yes, 45 minutes! You would think that would be plenty of time...However, as I sat at a table and waited and waited and....waited...I realized that I was quickly running out of time. With fifteen minutes left I let the waitress know I was soon going to have to leave. She didn't seem concerned and took her time in asking the sushi chefs about the status of my order. Turns out they had not even STARTED it yet! What a mess. 45 minutes for two sushi rolls to be made.The sushi was very good and their menu was unique and exciting. I would normally have given a much higher review however the extremely slow service is the reason I will not go back."], ["Troy D.", "I've been to Taro 20+ times in the last few years. It is consistent. The sushi is okay but for the price you can find better in the Slope.The service has been consistently rushed, rude and unwelcoming. None of the staff seems to understand the attentiveness and courtesy that New Yorkers expect when paying 25 or 30 bucks for dinner. Recently I had to send some tuna sashimi back because it was too tough to chew. Instead of apologizing and taking ownership for the mistake, the sushi chef angrily complained. C'mon guys, eating raw seafood is about trust. The staff should at least take ownership when they give you something gross!So the experience of the mediocre sushi is often further compromised by clueless service. It seems most of the positive reviews have been Slopers looking for decent take out, so it's probably fine when you're looking to order in some maki rolls. But for a sushi restaurant experience in Park Slope that involves sushi, sashimi or omakase, \u00a0one can do much better elsewhere"], ["Nicole S.", "Let me start by saying please pay attention to the hours. \u00a0I went several times before I made it there when they were open. \u00a0That turned me off a bit but the food was fresh and tasty (when I did make it). \u00a0Plus it was hard for me to find parking each time so that was a HUGE turn off and that's why they lose a star.

I do wish they would put that one devilishly delicious fish back on the menu.The good, GREAT points about Taro are everything else they have going on, \u00a0it's fresh and JUST SO TASTY.

I pointed it that out to the (pretty clueless) waitress and she just apologized. I didn't get more pieces nor a discount. The sushi themselves were just ok, not great as they used to be.

Depending on the time of day and the waitress you get, you may be in for a completely different experience. \u00a0The prices are decent but the quality of the sushi is nothing to write home about. Their rice is done very well so if you're having a roll you don't notice the quality as much. \u00a0With sushimi, you will notice that the octopus is very rubbery and the slices of fish are thin.

Taro does a great job of balancing quality and price- I feel that it's pretty much the best value you can get for the dollar without breaking the bank. The fish is flavorful and fresh- a standout for me was the yellowtail- and the miso soup is so good that I would consider stopping by just to have it.

It has something for everyone, and everything is surprisingly good. I'm usually apprehensive about restaurants that serve multiple cuisines (\"fusion\" often implies that it's not a master of either cuisine), but Kinjo does it well. They have both Korean and Japanese-inspired dishes, like Korean-fried wings, Korean fried rice, sushi rolls, ramen. The atmosphere is laid-back and casual, plus they have a great happy hour deal. The pork belly and kimchi appetizer is so good and fatty. I've gotten it twice now. On cold and rainy nights, Kinjo's ramen hits the spot. While it doesn't stack up to Chuko's in depth or flavor, it's satisfying enough: the broth is light and they are generous with the toppings (eggs, bamboo shoots, pork belly, bacon, etc.). My boyfriend was pleased with his beef sukiyaki, and the portion was huge.Best of all, it's never too crowded and is fairly easy to book via OpenTable. I'm glad it's in the area!"], ["Sahar N.", "Solid. Been here a couple of times with the boyfriend and have had the sushi, ramen, kimchi fried eye, udon, and chicken wings. As far as ramen goes, it's no Ippudo or Totto but it's decent and satisfied a craving when we don't feel like leaving Brooklyn. I recommend the Kinjo Ramen - it's the best of their ramens available. Boyfriend got the udon special the other night and her really enjoyed it, as well.The chicken wings with the potato starch batter are AMAZING. We got the chipotle molasses sauce and I SO recommend it - I wanted to eat that sauce on EVERYTHING. It's kind of like a BBQ sauce with a bit of a zing.The kimchi fried rice was definitely fusion style and a tad dry for me (I like my fried rice to be super cooked down/soft). I got it with spam AND pork belly. There was way more spam and, honestly, I preferred the bits of spam to the pork belly personally. The pieces of pork belly were a little dry for me too - I like fatty pork belly myself, so I'd go with the spam if I got the fried rice again.I got a Yuzu Pimms Cup the last time we went and it is now my favorite pimms cup ever. The yuzu was perfect with the gin!!! The sushi was also fresh and yummy when we got it once.Basically - so glad to have a spot nearby with good Asian flavors!

As I waited for my party, I was greeted by one of the servers who was generous enough with her time to walk me through the menu. Surprisingly, after 7pm, the small restaurant was not as packed as I would expect. You know what that means...no wait time for my dinner to arrive after ordering. I have never had Japanese cuisine so I was nervous and excited at the same time. I knew one thing, no raw food so no sushi. Thanks to the Yelp app, I was able to try edamame (a dish of green soybeans boiled or steamed in their pods) for free. SCORE! It was a bit odd since I was totally lost and actually ate the soybeans and the pod. Ick! Tip: only eat the soybeans and set aside the pods. They're not delectable, trust me.For dinner, I ordered the gluten free korean fried chicken wings with chipotle molassas. Best of the two choices, I think. The other option, ginger soy glaze, was a bit underwhelming. My drink was a refreshing brown sugar iced tea concoction. It was different, but eventually grew on me."], ["Sol C.", "Cannot believe I have only just discovered Kinjo. We had the most delicious dinner there! We happened to check it out around 9 pm on a Sunday night - which happened to be their viewing of the Game of Thrones premiere. So that was funny!The staff was fun and friendly. The service was also fast. And we had such a hard time deciding what to get because everything on the menu sounded so wonderful. We are Korean food lovers so we couldn't resist trying the pork belly over kimchee. This was a huge portion for $13 and fantastic. Mounds of kimchee topped with big chunks of tender pork belly. My boyfriend then had the special for the evening which was the chirashi. Some of the best chirashi rice I've ever had - the seasoning was amazing. The fish was also lovely and very fresh. The highlight of the night, though, was the beef sukiyaki. The broth was out of this world - sweet and savory and absolutely fantastic. It was jam packed with vegetables, beef, glass noodles and a perfectly runny egg yoke. We were so full that we couldn't finish it all but even better that I can prolong this amazing dinner and eat some more of it tomorrow!"], ["Nahid D.", "So not a ramen joint really but more just a sweet spot to grab some great Japanese inspired dishes.The server was wonderful! Answered all my friend's questions about the dishes and had some great drink recommendations! He gave us plenty of time to decide what we wanted without making us feel rushed. I wasn't in love with their Signature Kinjo Ramen but it was a nice light broth with good pieces of pork. Really enjoyed the soft egg. My friend really enjoyed the brussel sprouts, again it didn't blow my mind but they were good. Having said that, the chirashi was amazing! Fresh and delicious with some great flavors!

With warm wood paneling, friendly staff, and enough tables to sit maybe 50 people, Kinjo is a good choice for brunch, dinner, or drinks and snacks. Friends and I visited for a Sunday brunch. I was pulled in by their daily specials, and three of four of us ordered chirashi. The chirashi was delicious, with a good selection of fish and served with Korean red chili paste (gochujang) which was a fun touch. Hubby got the Kinjo signature ramen, and enjoyed it (the bowl was empty) but he also looked over at our chirashi a few times lustfully. (I'm watching you hubby...) He did comment that it was a lighter version of ramen than he was expecting.

More of a two and a half stars place..That said the sushi and such seems pretty standard, middle of the road stuff. We also had sushi tacos for $13 which were not worth it. Basically three pieces of nigiri sushi with spicy tuna, salmon, and other mixes on top--smashed between two fried wontons. Their tots are sweet potato tots which was interesting but I don't know if I consider the hoisin/sriacha sauce a great compliment.They offer shrimp, veggie or pork gyoza fried or steamed for $4 during happy hour which I liked. While the flavor was again, pretty standard (I imagine they use premade stuff), it was nice to be have some filling options and while gyoza is always best pan fried, it was nice to have the option to go a little healthier with steamed. We ordered their black and cheese which was described as elbow macaroni, cheddar, black bean sauce, panko, with an option to add chorizo for \u00a0$4. We got it sans chorizo. It was actually really good. I often am disappointed by mac and cheese when I eat it out but I really enjoyed this one.Overall, not a culinary experience by any stretch of the imagination but it is a great place to meet friends for happy hour, score a few cheap eats, and cheap drinks."], ["June K.", "Ok... I really really want to like this place... But for sushi this place is terrible! I get that it is a cute neighborhood place and the drinks are good but i was beyond disappointed with Sushi!

I will go back for hot dishes maybe during the winter but I don't think I will be back again to eat sushis ever again. I was so shocked how they were so casual about the cleanliness one of the servers took the serving dishes that I was using to put the food on when I asked for more ginger and brought ginger back on the dirty dish I was using!

Kinjo, a Japanese/Korean fusion place in Fort Greene, is proof that it's possible to do a great job of pretty much everything. Their sushi is incredible - it's always fresh, and it's prepared flawlessly. It's also surprisingly cheap; you get great sushi fish at cheap takeout sushi prices. That alone would be enough to make Kinjo worth a trip, but as it turns out their hot food is also amazing. I've had almost everything on the menu at this point, and I've never been disappointed: the Korean wings, the sukiyaki, the tater tots, the pork belly with kimchi, the ramen, all awesome. You really can't go wrong. They've recently added a bunch of new stuff to the menu, and I'm excited to try it all. Also their cocktails are imaginative and tasty.

Brussel sprouts with truffle? Kimchi is just kimchi on top, tastes good though. \u00a0Chicken wings were just ok. Shoyu ramen broth lacked flavor and chicken thigh was burnt tasting bitter.

(Note that there's not much room to wait, either give them your number and try to find a bar nearby or don't come when there's bad weather.) The space is pretty large and the tables are spaced far apart; I never felt cramped. For food, we had the breaded cod (one of the small plates for $5) and it was really nice, with a BBQ-style sauce. We also had the mixed greens salad, which came lightly dressed with a delicious carrot-ginger-miso dressing. Even the miso soup wasn't your standard miso; it had small bits of cauliflower, broccoli and mushrooms. For entree, we shared the sashimi plate ($24) and the quality of the fish blew me away. The salmon was fatty and luscious and the tuna literally melted in my mouth. We got a good variety of fish on the platter but I wish they had told us what everything was; I knew what 75% of the fish was but some was just mystery fish to me. Nevertheless, I'd get it again.Our dessert was the green tea ice cream, which came with two small scoops and a large macadamia nut. It was the perfect end to the meal, tasty and light. All in all, we paid $49 + tip for a small plate, a salad, a soup, a sashimi entree and dessert.

Definitely."], ["William W.", "Yelp Score: 3 StarsHibino - that random Japanese owned Japanese restaurant nestled neatly away from the bustling streets and boisterous crowds. The restaurant is small; there is definitely a cozy feeling to it. Large windows surrounding the place allow for a lot of natural sunlight, which I personally like a lot. The d\u00e9cor is pretty standard, nothing that really stands out but it gets the job done.Alright, onto the food! The menu here isn't large, and that's a good thing. Many Chinese and Korean owned Japanese restaurants (for some strange reason...) tend to blow up their menus with dozens, if not hundreds of items. Hibino focuses on what they can do. Service was prompt, and I ordered the Chirashi bowl (sashimi cuts over a bed of sushi rice). Took about 10 minutes for the order to come, and my first impression was \"Wow, this bowl is small...\" I'm a kind of guy who will compare and contrast the food I eat, so when I realized that the serving size was quite small, and the sashimi cuts were, instead of the traditionally layer cut I was accustomed to, cut into cubes, I was staring into a bowl with fish cubs on top of a bed of rice. It \u00a0wasn't what I was expecting, and I felt a little let down. To make matters worse, there was a piece of shrink wrap still stuck on one of the pieces of fish - not a good sign. That sort of derailed my appetite - I guess when I brought it up to the waitress, I expected a free appetizer or even a drink, but all I got was \"Oh that's there, it's to keep the fish fresh, but I'll take that piece away\" and nothing more... ok so proceed to eat, and I'm already disappointed. The sashimi wasn't that great - sort of bland and rubbery tasting. If you've ever had sashimi that was frozen and then hastily thawed, then you know what I'm talking about. The cube of tuna wasn't fresh at all, and didn't have that \"melt in your mouth\" feature that most fresh, blue fin tuna cuts have. The rice was pretty tasty though, but you'd have to screw up REALLY badly to mess up the rice portion of a chirashi dish.I left Hibino poorer and still hungry. It was an underwhelming experience to say the least. The prices are unjustifiably high for the portions you get along with quality of the sushi/sashimi. Too bad, this place seemed like it could have been so much better, but the fish they served just didn't cut it for me. Perhaps their other non-sushi/sashimi dishes are of a much higher quality, but I tend to stick to sushi when I hit up \"authentic\" Japanese joints, only because I COULD eat the other non-sushi/sashimi dishes elsewhere like at a Chinese owned joint, whereas sushi is best left to those who grew up eating it or at least know a thing or two about it. Hibino, for the most part, was lackluster and was not worth the price I paid for my food, but given the lack of high quality Japanese restaurants in Brooklyn, I'm willing to give it another go."], ["Bam Z.", "Absolutely excellent on all counts: quality, service and price. \u00a0The Obanzai rotation everyday is awesome and the sushi is fantastic and they have a fresh menu."], ["Alissa C.", "This is probably the best Japanese food in the neighborhood.

The prices overall are reasonable, the Japanese staff is courteous and the restaurant is very accommodating when it comes to children."], ["Emma G.", "Hibino is neat and adorable inside, with a cool open kitchen/sushi counter so you can watch them cook if you want.The Kyoto-style small plates are a lovely idea. There were three small plate specials the night I went, and I wasn't in a meaty mood so I didn't opt for the short ribs. I wish I had. The other two were sweet potato and broccoli. Both were delicious, but prepared SO simply it was essentially exactly what I would've eaten at home. Not worth ordering if you're paying to eat out. I would advise ordering the small plates only if they are doing something cool with the ingredients.That being said, everything was extremely fresh and the other dishes we ordered were fantastic!!The fresh tofu was really cool- very soft and served in a cute little jar. You eat it with a mini spoon. Order this.The seaweed salad was unlike anything I'd tried before- it contained ~5 varieties of seaweed, only one of which is the standard kind they serve at most sushi places. Order this too.The pressed salmon roll (pressed into a rectangular shape) was also great. The salmon was so, so fresh and silky, seriously good fish here.

The air was stuffy upon entry, but it gradually gave way to the cold air blasting from the A/C unit above our heads. The wait time was a reasonable 15-20 minutes, but patrons were still waiting for tables as it approached 10pm. \u00a0The biggest selling point for this trek to Hibino were the obanzai dishes for $4 each (thanks to Yelpers' recommendations), The pork skewers were tender and juicy, but there wasn't too much lean meat to speak of. The tri-color yam noodles had a ramen-like consistency, which made it fun to try (as long as one don't expect any yam taste).The sushi rolls (salmon avocado and negi toro) were fresh but a bit heavy on the rice. Also, one should be cautioned that the soy sauce very salty as we automatically assumed we would be given the low sodium version. How presumptuous! The fresh (home)made tofu was served warm in a small jar, \u00a0and it had a very smooth texture. It was suitably complemented by a sauce in a separate container.A friend ordered the chirashi, which came with a solid assortment of raw and cooked fish, including uni. However, since when did places start serving chirashi with duck? It seemed odd and the chirashi felt impure (to me personally). 100 for 3 people including tax and tip seemed reasonable for all this food (including a glass of great tasting sake and bottle of Yebisu beer). Note that Hibino accepts credit cards but not accept American Express. In the end, it was good first-time experience with awesome drinks and atmosphere, but a mixed opinion on the food.

The salad dressing and shumai sauce came in those tiny cups and were also totally standard and good.Pacific roll had 4-6 pieces (I ate them so fast I forgot to count), but not the stupid 1 inch cheapo kind, these babies were large and showy. I think it was made hastily because they weren't sealed properly, and fell apart in my soy sauce dip, but then I changed my technique and kept it together for most of it. The taste was great and I almost didn't mind that they FORGOT the wasabi dollop, which I've never experienced in my life. 2 pieces tomago sushi were also normal, but somewhat thinly sliced. But for $1.25 each, fine! Lastly, they took about 30 or 35 min to arrive, not bad on a Saturday night. The delivery dude called me from outside my ground floor apt, oddly, and basically said \"ovtksibxosbw.....nxkcudks....kxif...wkdbdje\" to which I said \"I can't hear you, are you lost?\" And then he rang the bell. When he came to the door he had his phone wedged in his helmet and was still talking... just not to me. It was weird, and funny. Overall, for the price, this place is fine. Not mind-blowing, but hits the spot. I will definitely order again!"], ["Elizabeth P.", "Judging by the mix of reviews, I was a little hesitant to order from here, but being cheap and craving sushi, I bit the bullet. \u00a0The chirashi bowl and salmon lover's special are both delicious and fresh. \u00a0A sushi connoisseur won't be impressed by this place, but most of us are not connoisseurs. \u00a0This place is very affordable and will easily satisfy your sushi craving."], ["Renad K.", "Best sushi I've ever tasted, and you all should try the fried ice cream its amazing, I highly recommend this cuisine try the volcano roll its so delicious and try the salmon & tune combo its so delicious too, the noddles were delicious i ordered 2 bowels , and taste the pork dumpling they look delicious, i mean if you want sushi just choose this restaurant its tasty and the service is amazing and the prices are so good iv ordered so many dishes for only 20 bucks so just go taste it without even thinking about another restaurant i could give it 15/5 but the limit is 5 so yeah i give it 5/5.

The first two times everything was fine - decent quality, about what you'd expect for a three roll vegetarian Maki Combo for $7.75. Today however, I picked up the first piece of my sweet potato roll, was about to put it in my mouth when I saw something sticking out of it. I almost ignored it, asumsing it was probably just the seaweed sticking out. THANK GOD I decided to pick at it instead. I pulled at it and out came a short, black curly hair tucked neatly into contents of the roll itself. I was so horrified after already eating some of the avocado roll I threw it out before checking to see if there were more hairs - ignorance isn't quite bliss in this situation but it is better for my queasy stomach than finding more hairs tucked inside my food. I should also stress that this hair did not fall into my food by someone packaging my food or the delivery man, but was neatly rolled into the sushi with the other contents (you know, the foodstuff you'd expect to find in a sushi roll without the hairy surprise.) I wont ever be ordering from here again, and I'd suggest you do the same.

The absolute best thing about it is the food, though. Oh man, for the prices I was totally expecting subpar food, so imagine my surprise when it turned out to be good! Like, really, really good! The first time I ordered the chicken katsudon - probably my favorite japanese dish ever - I actually, honest to god, moaned. And I only paid $6 (+ tax) for a very generous serving of it. I have no opinion on the sushi since I'm not one for fish, but everything else I've tried - tempura, gyouza, miso soup, shumai, chicken/beef teriyaki, etc, etc - has been so, so delicious. The only snag in an otherwise perfect experience is that twice now I've been given undercooked food and have had to return it, but the staff were all really apologetic and replaced the meal (katsudon) quickly. Overall, this is definitely my favorite Japanese joint in the Williamsburg area. The food is delicious, the portions are decent, the prices are great, and the staff is very accomodating. What more can a person obsessed with Japanese food ask for?"], ["Karen M.", "Really really disappointed with our meal, the calamari was ridiculously over breaded then fried.

Delivery took over an hour but that's no big deal to me. The sushi was ehh. The spicy tuna roll had no spicy mayo which was disappointing so make sure you order extra cause it doesn't come with. The edamame seemed a little spoiled but then again I'm no expert. All in all, after a long day and being super hungry - this hit the spot."], ["Ryan S.", "Got takeout. Maki rolls were very fresh.

Sometimes you just need a solid, affordable delivery sushi you aren't calling in from Greenpoint. I ordered the chirashi and picked it up, it was a great portion size for $11 and very fresh. This place just opened and I'm really hoping it stays around for a while! It really fills a void in the area.

So we passed by this place and they have a menu outside for $25 three-course menu and it drew me in. The place wasn't crowded, possibly because it was on a late Sunday evening. The ambiance of this place is really cute and they have outdoor seating in the back with really nice lights. No matter the inside or the back of the restaurant, I find it a really cute place to take a date. They also have a cute bathroom. The waitstaff are really friendly as well.For salad I had the seaweed salad. I like seaweed salads and it was pretty good here. My friend had the spicy king crab salad, which was really good...mMm avocado! For appetizer, I had the tuna dumpling, which has a really pretty plating presentation and it was pretty good I must say...mMm raw tuna! When the waiter brought this dish to me I was confused, I was trying to think what did I order again? I imagined a few tiny dumplings, but nope it wasn't it's one big dumpling- that's why it's tuna dumpling (singular). My friend had the rock shrimp that was not on the regular menu, but it was for the three-course. This dish reminded us of the walnut with shrimp dish at Chinese restaurants.

The staff is very polite and attentive and its a pleasure to sit and eat inside the restaurant. The sushi isn't terribly expensive, particularly if you go for their lunch specials, but I find it lacks a certain flair. The rolls are fairly standard. I'm neither blown away by the simplicity of amazingly done sashimi nor wow-ed by fancy, stuffed to the gills maki creations. Just decent, standard sushi.Most of the rolls I've ordered there could really benefit from the use of some sauce, so I'd suggest asking for spicy mayo or eel sauce etc (I'm sure they charge you for it, but can't recall) if you're ordering a roll that you'd typically expect to be sauced.

The delivery is often faster than I expect. I have never been to the restaurant so I am unable to comment on the atmosphere.A little criticism, not enough to detract a star from the overall picture is that the Spicy Tuna should be a bit more *spicy* as sometimes it's a little bland and the ginger that comes on the side should be fresher. \u00a0I've had a few pieces that were browning and I just leave them to the side, and I love ginger!Keep up the good work Jpan!!!"], ["Steve L.", "Very good sushi and amazing customer service.

I'm a fan of the classic salmon avocado roll and the bento box with the rock shrimp tempura--you get so much food for $17.50!Finally we decided to visit the actual restaurant and dine in to get the full experience. We came on that one freakishly warm day at the beginning of April, and were hoping to sit in the backyard but it wasn't open--no big deal. Our servers were two different women, both polite and on a quest to keep our water glasses full. The sushi didn't disappoint again--we didn't wait long for our food and our rolls were well made and delicious. It took awhile to get the check and pay, but that didn't put a snag in the evening.

First of all their miso soup has those tiny stringy mushrooms that are so delicious and cute to boot. Secondly, their fish is incredibly incredibly fresh and buttery. They definitely are using the best type of Sushi Grade fish in town. The funny thing is that it looks like it's going to be one of those casual sushi restaurants but it's just so good.

After already waiting 45 minutes for my food, I get the call that they were out of the fatty tuna which was the MAIN REASON I ordered from them.. after asking for a fair comparison after she basically tried to sell me 10$ (the cost of my fatty tuna order) on other less appetizing sushi cuts, she told me she would give me 1 more sushi piece which was the equivalent to $2 in extra food. \u00a0It's been almost an hour now and still no food, needless to say i'm pretty pissed that it took them 45 minutes after receiving my order to tell me they were out of the primary thing I was interested in ordering from them only to replace my 2 premium cuts of sushi with 3 average pieces. \u00a0NOT COOL.Now after ranting here, I must say the food at inaka is pretty decent, not as good as other spots in the hood like Gen and Geido but better than jpan, koto, etc.., MY ADVICE call before ordering some premium sushi to make sure they have it even though it's on the menu, and don't order during a busy time because you will wait 1 hour plus!"], ["J M.", "Their Hibachi Chicken is the best I've ever had!!

Ordered take out one night after a long day of errands. The vegetable noodle soup was pretty disappointing- I may as well have just dropped some instant ramen into a pot of boiling water with some frozen carrots and cabbage. The teriyaki tofu also was not at all what I was expecting. Instead of the tofu being slightly crispy, the tofu seemed like it had been covered in a thin layer of flour and poached-- resulting in a gelatin like layer around the tofu. Not a good consistency for teriyaki sauce. The wait was also longer than expected- in part because they initially gave me the wrong item. Maybe the sushi is better here.

There was only 1 other table being served at 9 on a Thursday night; although, they seemed to be getting a few take-out orders. The atmosphere combines local modern restaurant design of low-end-trying-to-appear-higher-quality \"Asian fusion\" restaurants catering to people of European descent, complete with well-assembled collages of rock 'n' roll hero imagery (and Bob Marely, an outsider accepted into the white cannon of music). The music matches the walls well, but felt/sounded whiter than the dub reggae played regularly at better Japanese restaurant, Gen, on Washington Ave.While the food came out fast, it was bland.

The prices here are good, but not so low that they cause you to worry about the quality of the fish.

A friend and I had dined at Kyoto on a holiday weekend, and we were the only people in the restaurant (I also remember the restaurant being completely empty when I used to live closer and get take out from there, back when their sushi was a step above mediocre). It was uncomfortably warm in there, and there were flies buzzing around. My friend and I had ordered different rolls, but both with tuna. When our food arrived, we both thought the tuna tasted very fishy, and it even looked a little discolored. When we told our waiter, he insisted that the sushi was fresh and that it was a different kind of tuna that we might not have been used to. He wasn't rude about it, but he was insistent. Whether or not it was a special kind of sushi that was just designed to taste rotten, we weren't interested. But it took a few more back and forths before he took our plates away and offered to replace the rolls. We were nauseous at this point, so we just asked for the check. I have never had to send sushi back before, not even supermarket sushi.Recently, I ordered from here again on seamless, not realizing it was the same place until the food arrived. The sushi wasn't expired this time, but it was sub par at best. Thankfully, I hadn't ordered anything with tuna."], ["Erica T.", "This is my go to Japanese restaurant in the neighborhood.

I prefer it served chilled and slightly cold, but some restaurants serve it fresh and hot. Shumai was included in the lunch special, it was nothing special. The green salad, was just your usual salad, also nothing special.I like the quality of their food, but I don't think I will be a returning customer since the delivery man doesn't seem to have a lot of patience to wait and thanks for charging me an extra 20 cents, guy."], ["Sara K.", "Our regular take in sushi place in the neighborhood.

In fact, everything I've had here tastes good.

It's not the typical kani salad (cucumber, mayo, roe, imitation crab meat), but it actually has arugula in it. It wasn't bad, but not just what I expected. We also ordered the BBQ grilled octopus. It wasn't bad at all, but there was either some kind of gritty that I didn't know what it was. We each ordered the sashimi lunch special. It came beautifully plated with two pieces of salmon, white tuna (I think), and tuna sashimi. There's also two pieces of sushi and a California roll. I love how fresh the fish was. I've been to many low-end sushi restaurants and this was definitely much fresher -- and didn't have to break the bank! The lunch sashimi order came out to about $1/piece of sashimi.

The salad was had a gingery dressing, which I didn't like so I barely touched it. The sashimi wasn't bad, but very thick. I probably liked the tuna and salmon best. The nigiris were all decent, but the creamy scallop tasted like some sort of potato salad. I think the scallop was the best nigiri out of all of them. The Valentine Roll had a small kick to it, but not bad. I was surprised the waiters asked us twice if we wanted rice with our sashimi, as if we were doing it wrong.. but I guess they are use to offering it to people not familiar with the Japanese cuisine.

And the sushi quality was surprisingly good :) I am docking one star because their bathroom is horridly dark and the chef who used it prior to me did not wash his hands (the urinal was still flushing when I walked in...). But if it makes you all feel better, I did check that the sushi chefs use gloves when making the food. shrug.Because they sat us as an incomplete party, I am bumping them back up to five stars. I must be feeling particularly generous."], ["Carolina S.", "I have been here a ton of times and almost every time I leave with a belly full of sushi! The first time I came I had the vegetable terayaki. It was only $7 and it was delicious! It also came with a salad that has a carrot dressing and even came with a cup of miso soup. Not a bad deal at all. But then I got the 2 roll sushi special!! I was hooked! I love sushi and it's only $8.75. And the sushi came with the salad and soup top. I love getting the spicy shrimp and crab roll and the salmon roll. \u00a0Last time I threw them a curve ball and got two rolls of salmon with avocado! I was one happy camper! And then the other week, my co worker and I got the bento box for $9.50! I couldn't believe my eyes! Shumai, spring roll, salad, house noodles and then you had options for the last portion of teriyaki, california roll, sashimi, sushi roll or tempura. I went for the salmon/avocado roll. I was stuffed like a Thanksgiving turkey. I even had to leave some noodles. Sad! I think next time I will go for the sashimi. So good."], ["Jennifer S.", "I had jury duty around the corner for 2 week (yeah thats right TWO WEEKS) and ended up eating here multiple times. It is average in terms of price and quality and has great lunch specials. The sushi is fresh and you get a lot of stuff with the lunch combo deals (rice, noodles, salad, spring roll etc). It was fairly busy around lunch - it seems I am not the only one taking advantage of the specials - but I always had a seat and quick service."], ["Zack M.", "Its an ok place for sushi. When I first started coming here 3 years ago the place was nice. At some point they did a remodel and for some reason plastered straw or hay on the walls. It now smells like a barn when you walk in. Not the smell you want when you are already eating something with distinct smells such as sushi. When I need to get out of the barn I will come here again."], ["Anna L.", "I am still salivating over dessert! Their sushi is fresh here and the dessert was amazing! Their green tea fried ice cream was so perfect. This is the best fried ice cream I've ever had. The batter is crispy on the outside and thin layer of cake on the inside with a scoop of ice cream of your choice. It was just a perfect ending to a great meal. They give generous portions for their sushi rolls and their sashimi tasted fresh both times I've been here. Try their monster appetizer! Service was great! Never really came during busy hours though."], ["Nabila M.", "I was yelping a sushi restaurant and stumbled upon this iron chef house and I must say this is the best sushi restaurant I have been to thus far. Came here for a date night and we both loved it very much!! I love trying the specialty rolls and I must say this restaurant has the best special chef rolls. We had the monkey roll and hard rock roll and sushi and sashimi platter and it was delicious the sushi was extremely fresh and my favorite was the hard rock roll which is wrapped in a \u00a0rice pancake I recommend it to everyone we also had plum wine and it wasn't overly sweet which I recommend as well.Staff is super attentive and very friendly the restaurant itself is nicely decorated and its located in a very nice neighborhood. Also, brooklyn bridge park is nearby! I definitely see myself coming back here again!!! Looking forward \u00a0to trying all their special unique sushi rolls!!"], ["Lina S.", "Amazing local gem. I've been many times and haven't tried anything on the menu that wasn't delicious. The portions are more than fair. Bento boxes are big enough for two. I've enjoyed sushi and traditional dishes. The ingredients are fresh and not overly processed. The chef comes out sometimes and asks how the food is. Very pleasant service. The place is small and cozy. Be sure to get a reservation during busy times. The prices are very reasonable. Please keep it up!"], ["Yiting Y.", "This is my very first yelp review and I'm giving it to the Iron Chef!

I always take their Rainbow and Green Dragon Rolls because they are delicious! Especially the rainbow roll, because the salmon is always so fresh and soft that it literally melts in your mouth. They also have a very good variety of salads ( their kani salad is exquisite) and very nice Sake ( a friendly reminder, that Sake is supposed to warm- that's how it tastes best and it also impresses Japanese people). Yes, the place is small, but this makes the atmosphere very friendly and intimate. It also boosts service- I have never waited for my food for more than 8 minutes. Once I came here at Thursday night almost before closing, but people here still took my order and patiently waited for me to finish my food. The rice was a bit dry, but then I understand that it was almost the end and there was no point for them to boil new rice. But again- the fish was incredibly good!I strongly recommend everybody to come here."], ["Mulan D.", "The food was great and affordable.... Great customer service Loved the volcano salad"], ["Marina S.", "What would you do if you ordered seafood yoba, and asked for no noodles, but got rejected because the cashier scuffed it's impossible with an attitude, so you agreed to take it the way it is and got 3 shrimp, a crab stick, a tiny piece of white fish, placed on top of a container full of noodles? I won't ever come back here again. The yellow tail sushi and squid sushi pieces were fresh and that's what the two stars are for.

Me & my bf and my cousin came here last 2 nights ago and ordered 6 different type of sushi roll. All the rolls that we ordered is really good but the thing is they serve it to us 2 rolls at the same time & need to wait for like 15 minutes for the next rolls to be serve. Its kinda annoying eating & you stop to wait for the next food to come out. Food is perfect but the serving system is not that great. Theyre pretty busy because of the take out orders too maybe thats why."], ["Leanna B.", "AMAZING!! I am extremely impressed. I just ordered sushi for delivery from this place for the first time this evening. First, I called to place my order and the girl on the phone was very nice and easy to talk to. She was very open to customizing my order. The delivery was quick and the food is great!! I have ordered sushi from a few places since I moved to Brooklyn about a month ago and Osaka is BY FAR the best. The fish is so fresh and the rolls were phenomenal. I will definitely order from here again."], ["Thomas Joseph P.", "I am so glad that I decided to go to Osaka today. My first time here and I love how tiny and cozy it is inside. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I went with the 3 rolls lunch special with salad. 2 spicy shrimp rolls and a spicy salmon roll. Of course I had to add another spicy shrimp roll to the order and I am glad that I did. The rolls are amazing and the seafood is of very fresh quality. In total, 4 rolls and a salad for a grand total of $11.87 is a great deal. Get over to Osaka as soon as you can for great sushi."], ["Jason H.", "My go to sushi take out spot! I order from them at least once a week. They are quick, deliveries usually take around 20 mins if they're not busy and around 40 if they are. Very fresh and cheap compared to many Brooklyn sushi spots I've been to. Not a big fan of their special rolls but their regular rolls are delicious! \u00a0* this review is for take out and delivery"], ["Gen M.", "Whenever I wanted to eat something fresh and not be surrounded by a crowd of college students this was the place for me to go. While attending KBCC one of my favorite things was that the school was in a Russian neighborhood but still had different restaurants from many different backgrounds.

We had about 10 special rolls for 3 adults and 2 kids aged 6 & 8. Check came out to slightly over $100. Minus one star because we actually came in on a Friday night and asked seating for party of 7. The first thing they said is, they can't serve us because of their tremendous amount of takeouts. That I understand but then one minute later, the sushi chef said all tables are reserved by people. That, I know is a lie so we left. 3 minutes later, we found out 2 of our friends aren't gonna be showing up so we called and ask if they can take the 5 of us and I'm glad we gave another shot. Otherwise we wouldn't be thinking of coming back again, because the food is that good!"], ["Nanciee C.", "I've eaten in once and the past few times, ordered for take out.They are really quick with serving the food. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Overall pricing of the dishes is also pretty reasonable and pretty good for the quality they serve. The restaurant, itself, is not too big, and as mentioned by another yelper, it feels cozy. The rolls are cut into 8 pieces, smaller than the 6 pieces from other restaurants, but still good! There is a variety of dishes on the menu. The website provides images of some of the dishes, especially the special rolls, many of which I would love to try one day.

This is due to their consistency and becoming my favorite sushi spot in the area, in terms of their quality, speed, and attention to detail (real detail, not flash and gaudy crap most normal customers don't care about).Gotta throw some love at Osaka. It's tiny, but straight to the point. Their sushi is fresh, their rolls are slightly larger than the neighbors and it's honestly my favorite for take-out or delivery, maybe with one other very close behind. That, to me, says a lot in an area of 700 sushi restaurants. They're usually very quick and the hot kitchen items (teriyaki / hibachi) are delicious. I find that their salmon sushi and rolls containing salmon are of a better taste and texture than the neighbors, however, they need to use fresher and better greens in their saladsIt's not a good place for groups because it's so small but as I mentioned in one of my tips, when I'm coming home from a long shift and want to wind down somewhere, I'll come eat here alone , which I wouldnt do in another sushi spot in the area. In that regard, it's a breath of fresh air and doesn't try to wow you with something tacky and flashy (MITOUSHI, I'M LOOKING RIGHT AT YOU). Be sure to give this place a shot 100% for take-out or delivery, and maybe if it's you and one more for eating in.

I usually don't expect much from sushi establishments of this calibre, however, this one really blew me away. The quality and freshness is definitely up to par with some of the more expensive sushi restaurant I've been to. My boyfriend and I ordered a total of six rolls and a salad, and within ten minutes, our order was packed and ready to be picked up. This place is sushi express, indeed. I do have to mention that their sushi rolls \u00a0are a tad smaller than normal. And whilst I enjoyed the food, I felt like I was still able to eat afterwards.

We got a couple of different rolls which were all very good, however, for someone who doesn't like spicy it's a problem.

You clearly all grew up eating KFC. I can make better wings than these at 3am. Show me down, homie. If this place is supposed to be redeemed by some chicken wings, you're going to have to come harder than that. 2 of the 5 wings served to use were over fried - I don't care if you sprinkle crack in your sauce, but if your wing wasn't cooked right, it should not be served. This is not Monday night at Croxley. Oh, yeah, check this 5 wings for $8 - that's nearly $2 a wing. You're trying to sell yourself as affordable? I don't care if these wings came from privately tutored chickens on a members only farm, that is not a justifiable price.To make matters worse, this place is right by my apt, every time I walk by it I have the urge to throw rocks at it. Why does this place exist? Seriously. Why? Is it a bar? No, not a full bar yet drinks are probably the only things \"worth\" having. Is it a ramen place that also serves sushi? Because everyone seems to be eating ramen. Well if it is stop billing yourself as a sushi shop because that shit is infuriating. I want to know the asshole who went to Blue Ribbon, saw $5 for a piece of nigiri and decided to do the same except with delivery quality sushi.\"Montauk yellowfin tuna\" why why why does that exist on a menu. Why is it not a sushi place? 3 kinds of rolls, 5 types of sushi/sashimi. Literally. That's all. \"Vegetarian roll\" is not a fucking thing. It's not. Call me a food nazi but this is not LA. Spicy tuna with FRIED potatoes? Are you entirely out of your sliver of mind? For $9??? You are not in the $9 a roll and $5 per piece class of sushi restaurant. Please get the fuck over yourself. Why did I stay? Because I invited 4 people here and by the time we all sat down, I was too fucking embarrassed to point out what a shitty choice I'd made based on a four star yelp review. \u00a0This is why I hate yelp. You are all assholes and owe me $150 and a compensatory plate of sashimi because that montauk tuna was the wackest shit I've ever had. It's a legit outrage.

You don't need to pressure people to order food while we are waiting for the rest of the party to arrive. Drinks were ordered. Our plate of sashimi was cleared before we finished and it took a good 10 minutes to be acknowledged. And in return we got exactly one piece of sashimi back.

We got the duo tar tar, millennium roll, green river & a spicy tuna. Every item except the spicy tuna was jam packed with soggy tempura crunch flakes. None of the items on the menu were described as having crunch in them. I personally feel that the crunch ruins the flavor of the fish and is used as a filler so they don't have to use as much fish. The only thing i could taste in these rolls is the soggy \"crunch\". It was so overpowering I couldn't even really taste the fish. So can't comment on whether or not it was fresh. Also, the avocado in the rolls was not ripe at all. Had no flavor and was hard. Think I'm gonna stick to Kiku on 7th between 10th & 11th from now on. The place is also super over priced. Green river roll is simply spicy salmon avocado & it costs $11. I can get the same roll anywhere else for max of $6-7."], ["Sara C.", "I'm so happy this place exists.

True, it's not a massively authentic Japanese-owned sushi restaurant (I believe it's Chinese-owned as I heard them speaking Chinese), but the sushi is solid. Everything I've ordered has always been really fresh and very nicely prepared.I usually order a bunch of fresh salmon sashimi, which comes in large and buttery slices. And one of their house rolls -- the Green River (spicy salmon with avocado) and Tunagi (black pepper tuna, fresh tuna, cream cheese) are both super delicious.

The foie chicken wings were very appealing so we ordered it. It's 2 big fat wings with some foie I'm the middle but overall very oily and heavy.

The rice here was very sticky (too sticky I couldn't peel the rolls apart easily) and it tasted just like some overdone rice with rice vinegar. Not good. Uni was not very fresh and it cost us $6 a piece. The special rolls were pretty disappointing too. Those who wrote good reviews about this place have probably never had quality sushi. However.

All of them were cut to fairly good portions. Not too big and had all the signs of fresh seafood.

The salmon is perfectly smashed up and spicy with a decent spicy salmon to rice ratio. They also top is off with a little bit of avocado and cucumber. I kind of wish they would add a bit more veggies to it. I'm also obsessed with their pickled veggies. They're so tangy and crunchy!There's two complaints I have about this place. First is that they're only open for dinner and second I've had some issues with consistency in the quality of the fish. Usually it's great but occasionally the salmon is fishy and has those brown spots you see in lox. That's why they don't get 5 stars from me"], ["Vittoria L.", "Great little place if you're having sushi cravings. I ordered the macrobiotic roll, which included beet pate (cashews, ginger, agave), avocado, and steamed kale. If you're looking for something healthy, this is a great option. I personally prefer having raw fish in my sushi though. I also ordered chirashi, specifically the Fisherman's Bowl since I was starving. This came out as a large bowl of sushi rice with the chef's choice of sashimi (salmon, tuna, etc.,), snow crab, scallops, eel, fish roe with a large assortment of vegetables (picked daikon radish, cucumber, scallions, and avocado). If you've never had this before, I recommend to try! Very tasty bowl of happiness. The way I like to eat it - take a bite of fish, and have some rice right after. And then alternate with different items. As I was waiting for my orders, they let me try hot sake. If that's not good customer service, then I don't know what is. Definitely would come back!"], ["Melanie M.", "Cute cramped and oh so delicious! This is the type of place that makes Brooklyn one of the best cities to eat in... It's sushi with a not your average healthy twist. They offer fresh selections you can't find else where!Their rice cups are the perfect light bites and you have a choice of regular white rice or flaxseed rice. If you are Vegan or gluten intolerant they have plenty of choices and offer lots of alternative sauces to cater to your needs. Still not convinced this isn't your average sushi spot??? What if I told you they offer a macrobiotic roll that's filled with beet paste, avocado, steamed kale and cucumber!!! That's one of the many unique options you will find at Silver Rice and no where else. The pickings here even stretch as far as to offer quinoa salad and organic miso soup! This place isn't a sit down place the seating is very limited but if your on your way home and you need something fresh and healthy that your body will thank you for then this is the place!"], ["Lea M.", "The most awesome sushi ever! Everything's so fresh and made with love. I think the Silver Rice Cups are awesome, it's so delicious with that spicy mayo. Also love the special rolls, they're so big they don't fit in your mouth. The chef is so nice and attentive. I like the design and the style but they really need an air condition and more places to sit! We'll definitely come back"], ["Lauren S.", "Delicious! I ordered the spicy tuna cup and the spicy salmon roll. Both had incredible fish. Flavorful, tender, perfectly succulent and fatty. The cup had the tuna with avocado and spicy mayo over some perfectly cooked rice. Perfect fish to rice ratio. And the salmon roll was exploding with salmon, so much that the roll couldn't contain all of it. Bright popping delicious flavors and textures. Far better than other sushi in this price range."], ["Susan L.", "I love how the service here is really nice. The ambience looks sort of hipstery and pretty cool. So my sister, cousin, and I ordered the Fisherman's bowl, unagi cup, spicy tuna cup, and the macrobiotic roll.The fisherman's bowl was so fresh. I loved how all the raw fish was on top and they had a lot of toppings along with it. They added mini salmon eggs, avocado, and three pieces of unagi. I love how the rice tasted along with the raw fish. I totally recommend this.The macrobiotic roll was ok. Overall, I would come here again since I love the food here."], ["Dominek T.", "What a cute, trendy, and unexpected surprise this was in the neighborhood when my friend invited me to this place for a quick late night bite. \u00a0The setup is very simple. \u00a0They have a couple of indoor seating areas that just have barstools, a covered outdoor seating area, and then just a simple patio area. \u00a0They offer your typical sushi and also rice bowls. \u00a0I tried their sushi and it tasted extremely fresh. \u00a0If you are looking for a sushi spot that is fresh and simple then this is definitely the place to go. My friend informed me the rice bowls were delicious as well. \u00a0I will be back to visit soon and write an even more detailed review."], ["Melanie M.", "I think I've reached that part of my life where I expect quality ingredients when it comes to sushi/sashimi/raw anything. Silver Rice definitely lives up to that expectation!I ordered delivery over the phone and the host was super friendly as he guided me through the options. I ordered the spicy tuna silver rice cup, miso soup, hijiki salad and edamame (I couldn't quite eat it all, but I needed to reach the $15 delivery minimum).The rice cup is a coffee cup filled halfway with rice (I chose the flax seed rice) and topped with spicy tuna tartare, avocado and cucumber. Think of it being a broken down spicy tuna roll, but twice as filling. The fish completely melts in your mouth!I also enjoyed the edamame, which seemed salted without the actual salt. Maybe they put salt in the water used to steam the pods? The miso soup and hijiki salad were fillers, but definitely star-worthy as well!I definitely want to try some of their veggie offerings too. That farmer's bowl is calling my name!"], ["Ms. C.", "Good fresh Japanese food. Randomly went here after looking for a spot to grab a quick bite. I've passed by and even went in this spot before just to check out the interior. I ordered to go a miso soup and spicy tuna in a cup. It was very good. No complaints. Overall good food and I love the look of this spot."], ["Nikole O.", "Recently moved to the area and was craving sushi. Silver Rice does not disappoint. Not super fancy, but not gross and cheap. I had their miso soup, spicy tuna cup (AMAZING) and a California roll. I can't wait to go back and try more!"], ["Laurel A.", "This was my favorite place to eat when I stayed in Brooklyn. Cute and cozy atmosphere - there's even an enclosed outdoor seating area that was perfect for a chilly night. I ordered the spicy tuna rice cup and it was the perfect portion for a light dinner. Great flavors and super reasonable! I also tried the miso ice cream (sounds weird, but it was actually delicious)... I ended up going back the next day just for that. They put some sort of sprinkles on top that give it a unique texture and add a pop of color. Definitely going to come back here when I'm in Brooklyn again!"], ["Mariella B.", "Really good sushi! It can get addicting ;) love the spicy majo, and you can tell the sushi is fresh. It is becoming super popular so be ready to have a wait, specially during peak times, but if you can wait, its definitely worth it."], ["Tommy K.", "Excellent rolls for a great price, from $7-12. Each role comes with an ample amount of fish. We loved the basic rolls, spicy tuna, salmon, real crab California, and their specials were delicious. Seating is tight. Service is five stars. Silver Rice is the local go-to sushi place."], ["Hannah S.", "This place is amazing! Their rice cups are so good. Me and my husband usually get a rice cup each and then share a roll and that's usually perfect for dinner. Also, their miso soup is the best one I've ever had."], ["S Y.", "When I read that two Japanese guys who had been thinking about opening a food joint for years finally opened this place, I was super curious/excited even though we have really great options for sushi with Taro and Gen within walking distance. \u00a0We ended up ordering in two chirashi bowls -- the Alaskan (salmon- $13.75) and the FIsherman's Bowl ($15.95) which has several different fish, avocado, eel, eggs, sort of like a tiny sushi combo in a bowl.The food ended up being very Japanese. \u00a0The bowls and fish pieces are pretty petite, but everything was perfectly prepared. \u00a0We ordered the flax rice and were blown away by how well prepared the rice was. \u00a0It's crazy addictive. \u00a0I wanted to swim in a vat of that rice eating my way through it. \u00a0The fish was super fresh, and the farmer's bowl was delicious. \u00a0We made a pact to eat half and then switch, but I secretly ate way more than half, tunneling underneath the sashimi to get more rice. \u00a0Let's be honest, a hungry me could easily eat both bowls in one sitting.The food is really spectacular and worth the bit of a splurge. \u00a0Next time, I may secretly order a second bowl all for myself.P.S. Look at the hours! \u00a0Thinking that since this place is casual, I thought it'd be open for lunch, but I found the guys hard a work making the perfect rice for dinner instead."], ["Allison B.", "What a cool spot.We snagged a table in the heated tented entryway and dove face first into rice cups, rolls and bowls. If you want something filling (not to mention portable) on the cheap, the rice cup is calling your name. Sure, it's mostly rice, but there's a healthy serving of fish on top and boy, is it tasty. If I lived/worked in BK I'd be getting these all the time.Quick, casual, decently priced. Check it out."], ["Cindy L.", "I worked serving sushi for 7 years at a top notch place but still I thought this place was great! Prices and presentation were unbeatable for a sushi restaurant. Can't give this place a five star though only because I found a hair in my bowl towards the end. :/"], ["Emma L.", "Best sushi in the Crown Heights/Prospect Heights neighborhood. \u00a0I love the sushi salad, regular salmon roll and spicy tuna cup! I've tried other items - you can't go wrong. Plus the flaxseed rice is a great addition!"], ["Bernardo C.", "Have been here twice before during the day. The actual space is super tiny but they utilise it very well. The design of the decor, food, and overall ambiance is very aesthetically pleasing and the service is very friendly. The sushi is nice and fat and very good quality. The only thing that prevents me from giving it 5 stars is that it is slightly expensive. Overall really like this place :)"], ["Kamilla K.", "Probably one of my favorite parts of living in the neighborhood. Amazing sushi at not very steep prices. If I'm hungry I'll get one of their seafood bowls (so delicious!) or my other favorite is the macrobiotic roll - I've never been much of a fan for vegan sushi but this one is truly delicious. Their spicy tuna roll is also delicious. The cups are pretty cool, but a little weird to eat because the stuff is at top and all the rice is at the bottom and its a pretty narrow cup. Also I highly recommend getting the flaxseed rice - it's just white rice with bits of flaxseed in it and I feel like it makes it even more delicious. The menu isn't huge and most of it is very basic, which I think helps with the quality. They have a great sake selection as well. Service is pretty minimal, you just order and pay at the counter and then they bring out your order. Part of the reason I love going here by myself as well."], ["Jessie E.", "Still excellent every time. Macrobiotic roll. Explosion of flavors in your mouth.

I did not think the portion of fish is unfair."], ["Hamilton W.", "This place is great. I just had the spicy salmon cup and it was awesome. Think the spciy salmon you get in a roll, but on top of rice and with a few vegetables on top creates the perfect medley of flavors. I wish I lived nearby, so I can come and stuff my face, every damn day. I'll have to remember to stop by here the next time I'm in the neighborhood and order a few more things on the menu. Prices are reasonable just don't come for their alcohol. That didn't look cheap, but it may have been specialty stuff."], ["Janice C.", "Spicy salmon rice cup and rolls are delicious. However they run out of fish quite early in the evening. In fact call ahead to see what's still fresh and available. They have a card that they begin to cross out as soon as it hits 7pm on a week night. I went around 8:45pm on Weds and they are all out of spicy salmon and yellowtail.

The tuna cup, farmers bowl, miso soup (w/ scallion and micro shrooms) salmon cup are great. I'm sad (ashamed,surprised?) to report that I've never had a California roll with real crab before Silver Rice--it's excellent. The roll with beet pate was a little sweet for me, but I appreciated the concept of it and I'm prob more sensitive to sweet foods than most.Overall, best fresh raw sushi and seafood in the area by a long shot. It's a different level."], ["Chase Y.", "This lil hole in the wall full of hipsters and a couple of japanese fellows cranks out some banging sushi. Food: This stuff is the real deal. It's really hard to come by some mo fawkin quality sushi in nyc unless you got mad bread ya dig. That tuna literally melts in your mouth like your first girl. One thing I don't know how they do is that Macrobiotic Roll. It literally tastes like it's sushi but it's vegetarian or vegan or one of those diets for anal nut cases. All I know is that fish they harvested had a life full of meth and crack cause I am addicted. They even had a california roll with ACTUAL crab. Enough said.Service: Pretty nice and willing to help staff. I was lost on what to order cause it mainly consisted of special rolls and chirashi. The cashier was willing to help.Decor: Simple and well executed. I liked the logo. Well designed. Quite small and cramped though.Would I go back?Ohh yeah.

They were super friendly as soon as I walked through the door, and whether you are there to pick up something quick already pre-made, or to order from their menu, the experience is all positive.It's a small space, but I think they've designed it well.Things to try:- The Chirashis (there are three but all great)- The Spicy Tuna and Salmon Cups - if you like Ungai (eel), I would suggest that cup as well but it's slightly more expensive.- The House SakeI don't think you can really go wrong with anything you get there. At the end of the day, it's about he quality of the fish and the overall experience. Silver Rice get's it right."], ["Tracy H.", "Fantastic fresh fish in Crown Heights. The decor was charming and clean, seating available inside and outdoors under string lights, the service friendly. I ordered to-go and one of the chefs walked into the seating area and personally handed me my order!Out of curiosity, I had the hijiki salad, made from hijiki, carrots, and tofu. Later googling told me hijiki was a type of prepared seaweed. The rich sea flavor was unexpectedly good. Definitely recommend it.I also had the salmon kombu, made from salmon, avocado, scallions, celery, and cucumber. The roll doesn't taste like the usual roll one might order, but it was unique and yummy. It has a light flavor. With so many different ingredients, it was hard to get a balanced bite with each. I felt that all the ingredients overpowered the actual salmon, so I wish the roll was made with a thicker slice of it.The food was more expensive than I prefer, given the portion sizes, but I'll be visiting again."], ["Em K.", "So fresh, simple and outrageously delicious. The Fisherman's and Alaskan bowl are the best!"], ["Molly G.", "Way better than your average sushi place. The salmon and tuna cups are a staple of my diet- good, fairly heathy, quick dinner for under $10.

Better for takeout since there's not a lot of seating."], ["Sign S.", "The sushi always tastes fresh and the proportions are satisfying. The rolls are well stuffed and their cups are a treat.

We shared the nonohana roll (broccoli rabe, cucumbers, egg, pickled daikon- so tasty!) and the salmon kombu roll (salmon, kombu, honey ginger vinaigrette, jalape\u00f1o -highly recommend!).

Our body needs this essential alpha-linolenic acid, which means we must eat it in order to get it in our diet.-All of their soups. Miso with fresh crab is my favorite.-Anago roll (the saltwater eel) Anago has a much better flavor then unagi (freshwater eel).-Nanohana roll- the bitterness of the broccoli rabe paired with the crunchy cucumber and picked daikon is simply amazing.

The only problem is that the layering combined with the full and narrow cup makes it a bit difficult to get at the rice for even fish/rice distribution. If you're taking it home, it's better to pour it all out into a bowl of sorts. The flaxseed rice is really tasty and basically just gives your standard sushi rice a little pizzaz. The chirashi is okay, but it was mostly rice and not a whole lot of fish. I'd go with two rice cups or a rice cup and a roll over the chirashi."], ["Dana K.", "SO! i'm writing this as my delicious food stands near by. Been ordering from this place 2/3 times a week since they've opened. It's that good. The fish is unbelievably fresh.. like the freshest I've had in years. Over all atmosphere, service, delivery has been great. The last 2 times I ordered on seamless they left out my miso, they were super apologetic and immediately redelivered. This time they sent my order with a free app and drink bc of the previous mixups.( that's like unheard of these days). Great food, great management. Wonderful addition to the neighborhood!!"], ["Kate G.", "Silver Rice is so great and I feel lucky to have it be so close to home. Their \"brunch\" is a great value and we frequented it a lot during the winter-- it is a sushi cup (fish over rice in a cup, sounds weird tastes delicious) plus a miso soup or a hot tea. They don't do bizarro Americanized rolls (Cilantro! Papaya! Bacon! Etc)-- flavors are pretty straightforward. This isn't a bad thing... Fish is always so delicious. The owners and staff are also really friendly and make you want to support them."], ["C D.", "I've been terrified to try sushi in Crown Heights. I just don't think anyone is going to haul fresh fish this far in. But wait! They have! And holy crap this is amazing food. I've been to Japan twice, and my friend owns one of the most popular sushi shops in Hiroshima, and he would approve of this place (except the rolls were a tad loose). Anyway, we had two of their special rolls (a tuna something and a salmon something) a yellowtail scallion roll off the basic menu and one other. I can never eat more than two rolls usually. but after splitting this with my husband I was dying for more! We should have eaten there so we could keep ordering.The whole experience was lovely. it seems to be run and owned by Japanese people (they were saying Onegaishimasu every time they handed the chef an order). They are polite, and have beer if you like while you wait for your meal. Outside seating is limited but we got a space and had an Asahi in the sun while we waited.

Every piece of our omakase was fresh, delicious, and unique. The chef adds different sauces and garnishes to each piece making it tasty, flavorful, and different from other top notch omakase menus. He was friendly and explained each piece in detail. Recommend sitting at the bar and not sitting at a table (for the full experience). We will definitely be back for more!"], ["Jess P.", "Best sushi I've had in Brooklyn (although I welcome dissenting opinions!). This time, I went with my girlfriend, who is trying to be a more adventurous eater, so my experience was informed by that. We each had the sushi and sashimi omakase, the chef's selection of the freshest fish ($65). The first plate had a creamy raw oyster, monkfish liver (which tastes like a rich, lobster liver p\u00e2t\u00e9), Spanish mackerel, tuna in perilla leaf, and slices of fluke with delicate drops of wasabi, plum, and shishito peppers. The mackerel, in particular, melts in your mouth. She had never had oysters or monkfish before, so I found myself paying even more attention to the flavors and textures. Our second plate had sushi: sardines, unbelievable black snapper with the simple brightness of sea salt and lemon, and buttery Scottish salmon. The third plate was also sushi: yellowtail, creamy uni, and toro. And lastly, a fatty tuna hand roll wrapped in crisp nori, followed by a cup of warm green tea. We savored everything, and it was excellent and satisfying. The service is attentive and doting, carefully explaining what each item is and directing you when to add soy sauce. All the while, soothing Baroque music played in the background. Even the bathroom is relaxing, with simple small white tiles and a black tile floor. You can even spot the \"towel warmer\" machine just outside the bathroom door. Overall, a fantastic experience."], ["Troy D.", "This place is off the hook. I've been here 10+ times in the last year and the sushi, salads and tempura are always stellar. The tuna has been particularly consistent and succulent. What is especially remarkable, however, is the way that the uber delicious sushi is paired with flawless service. The staff is always warm and attentive and eager to anticipate one's needs. The servers are knowledgable and able to advise patrons regarding what is best on any given night, which helps to make for an optimal experience. And I regularly see not 2 or 3, but 5 competent, serious sushi chefs behind the counter: Yup, this place is legit.

I promise you won't be disappointed."], ["Diane Z.", "Hmm not sure if I just came on an off day or if the quality is declining. It was my third time and this was by far the worst.We wanted to start with the monkfish liver, but they ran out. We went with the cod roe like they suggested, but it just didn't hit the spot. It was creamy and ok in small bites, but I had a big bite and it left a bad aftertaste.The sushi omakase started off nicely with a medium fatty tuna, but went downhill from there. The rice was off and we told the chef and he just agreed and slightly apologized, so he knew the rice wasn't good. He knew he was serving us bad rice!Sure, the cost is not too bad at $45 for the sushi omakase, but I think I'd rather pay more for better quality. The atmosphere is also pretty hectic and there's a lot of quickly churning things out with little care."], ["Shirly S.", "I went to Sushi Katsuei with expectations. I read reviews on the restaurant and decided to try the Omakase menu. We were a party of 9 celebrating our cousins birthday. We were seated in the extension of the restaurant. If you're a large party you may want to reconsider going here because it was so hot sitting in the extension. They had a fan and the ac on but we were sweating and they can't do anything about it. Believe me, I asked and the waiter never responded. I asked about the difference between the Omakase vs the sushi sashimi deluxe and was informed that the Omakase tasting was not your standard sushi you can get from any Japanese restaurants. With even more excitement we waited for our experience to start. Sashimi came first, it was very fresh. We were informed of what they were and a description of what the chef had did to make it better. My impression, \u00a0not that special. Sushi came and it took forever between the second, third, and last round. A 15-20 minute gap in between. The only thing I felt that was different from the standard was the fatty tuna. To be fair, the fish was very fresh, service was average, Omakase was not what I had expected. The experience was not the greatest. At the end when we were splitting the bill, something was a bit shady. For my share it was an even $80 including tip and when the checks came back it was half way filled out already. The charge was $10 and tip was $70. I'll leave it at that.

I'm not sure if it's the lighting, the fish, or the sushi bar, but check out the pictures to the right (and follow me on instagram). I'll wait...What makes those photographs so amazing? The Atmosphere is - first and foremost - sublime. The lighting is bright and inviting around the sushi bar, with no weird pastel colours on the walls that most neighborhood sushi restaurants fall victim to. There is also a somewhat large seating area, which makes eating with family and friends more than possible.The food is the other part of the equation. I ordered the omakase, which - at an extremely reasonable $45 for 10 pieces of nigiri - is as great a value as you will find in New York City. As I always recommend for good sushi restaurants, I ate the sushi as presented.

You could either do the $45 Omakase for just sushi or the $65 one for sushi & sashimi, we opt for the $65 sushi & sashimi Omakase.The fish is definitely fresh, and some of the chef's sushi pieces are interesting and innovative. But to be honest, it didn't WOW me or AMAZE me, but then again like my friends said... Me and my boyfriend are Sushi Snobs. I've had fresher fishes and better Omakase experiences before, but of course the price point between those places and Sushi Katsuei is much far apart, atleast double the price tag. This is one of the spots that do make each piece in front of you and hand gives it you one by one at a time on your plate though. Some few pieces that stood out to me were the west coast oysters from Washington; incredibly creamy and fresh, toro, eel, and surprisingly the squid. There was tuna hand roll and uni(sea urchin) in my meal that I just forgot to take a picture of. They also have quite a few other types of seasonal fish that are not on the menu, so be sure to ask!

(But I ate it and smiled like a good soldier.)Seriously, this is the first time I have ever had sushi like this. \"Pure\" is about the only word I can use to describe it. There's no soy sauce or wasabi on the table. Everything is dressed for you exactly the way the chef wants you to eat it. And in terms of flavor, it's all very subtle. Apparently, this is how good sushi is supposed to be. If the quality of the fish is that fresh, then I'm told it shouldn't need lots of accouterments. My biggest leaps of faith included some kind of squid piece, and a fried oyster piece. (And that awful fish spine, which we'll forget about.) Both of were delicious. I also enjoyed the pre-game treats of fried chicken pieces and gyoza. Oh, and a giant bottle of expensive sake didn't hurt either.I was told long ago that if I had never eaten something before, to only try it for the first time in a place that does it really well.

I get nigiri, but I suppose if you hate on rice you could try the sashimi. The appetizers are also universally excellent. And the rolls are great. But to truly appreciate the quality of fish go with the chefs' choice. They are older. They are Japanese. They are experts. Sit at the bar and talk to them.

I haven't been to too many good sushi spots in Brooklyn, but I would actually classify this place as some of the best sushi in NY, period.The thing people are raving about is the moderately priced Omakase for $45 (they also have a sushi/sashimi Omakase for $65). We both went with the Omakase and ordered some additional starters, rolls and nigiri a la carte (because who thinks just 9 pieces of sushi is enough, right?).We started with the Pork Gyoza and the Tori Karaage ($6.50 each), for some nice, fried greasiness to ruin the much healthier dinner we were about to have. Both were pretty great, especially the juicy Gyoza with thin, crispy skin.The Omakase consists of 9 pieces, which they serve you 3 at a time, and then finish you off with a hand roll at the end. For our shellfish allergy friendly version, our pieces were fatty tuna, red snapper, baby yellowtail, yellowtail, king salmon, mackerel, sea bass, bluefin tuna and king fish. Every piece was so soft and smooth, and it was some of the much higher quality sushi I've had recently. I can see why it's a relatively cheaper $45 though, as they don't include many of the typical, more expensive pieces in Omakase meals (where's the uni? And the ikura? And the eel?).We also got the Salmon Skin Roll ($5.50), Eel and Avocado Roll ($7), and two pieces of Anago Nigiri ($4.50 each), because we clearly didn't have enough eel in the meal. Even these plain old rolls were much better than the rolls at a typical Japanese spot. The rice was soft and slightly warm and perfect and the eel and avocado melted in your mouth.Most of the waitstaff that I could see were all Japanese, which is always good to see, and unfortunately a rarity in NY.

First, a disclaimer: My girlfriend and I are loyal patrons of a Japanese restaurant down the street on 7th Avenue, Yamato, which we have found to be the perfect neighborhood sushi joint - it's reliable, delicious, reasonably-priced and has great service. There's nothing cheap about it, but it's classy without being fancy or pricey.Sushi Katsuei is new to the neighborhood, and we wanted to try it out. Upon looking at the menu, it quickly became clear that it is going for a more upscale experience, or at least it is betting that it can succeed at a higher price point because it's got a prime location in Park Slope. The closest thing to a sushi regular was $30, a full $11 more expensive than the sushi deluxe at Yamato. Sticker shocked, I went instead for a pair of rolls -- fatty tuna and eel. The eel was just eel -- if you wanted avocado or cucumber, that was an up-charge. I have no complaints about the fatty tuna -- it was tasty and a reasonable portion. The eel, however, was literally the stingiest eel roll I've ever had -- 6 pieces (not 8), and it contained so little meat that if I was supposed to appreciate the higher quality fish that Sushi Katsuei offers, I had no chance to because I could barely taste it.Again, I acknowledge that perhaps this restaurant is geared toward customers who will pay a higher price to appreciate top-level sushi and can appreciate it. But I was decidedly underwhelmed and will be returning to Yamato from now on."], ["Beatrice G.", "That was the most overpriced sushi that I've ever had in my life. What a waste of $100 !

It is, hands down, the best sushi I've ever had in Brooklyn.This is not your typical, middling-to-crappy, three rolls for $9 lunch special type place. If that what you come here expecting, and then complain about the prices, then you've simply come to the wrong place. Get out. This is not what you want. This is sushi as it's supposed to be - not drenched in soy sauce and wasabi, and (shudder) topped with gari (pickled ginger) that I've seen some people do. (Seriously! Why do people do this?!? Can you even taste what you're eating?) If you're going to do that to your sushi, you might as well be eating trash - and I guess that's somewhat close to what most of the sushi places in Brooklyn pass off as sushi.I'm not putting these places down. There's a time and place for these joints, and I'll happily eat that sushi lunch special when I'm feeling a fast-foody type craving for some sushi.But I'm half-Japanese, born in Japan and raised on some of the good stuff, and I know what's what.Basically, all I have to say is that the fish is so fresh and carefully selected, it melts in your mouth. Nothing smells fishy (bad sign!!!!) but smells of the sea. The sushi is not a giant ball of rice, with a sad piece of fish, but rather a small, expertly shaped bed for the fish. The waiters tell you not to use soy sauce (except the smallest touch on the sashimi)- they mean it. Don't cover up the exquisite flavor of the fish with salt. Even if you think you won't like it without soy sauce, try it. You'll be surprised to learn you actually LOVE the taste of fresh, quality fish.The cod appetizer also gets a special shout out - that shit's delicious.Yes, portions are probably smaller than you're used to, it's way more expensive, blah blah blah. But I think most everyone can agree that you have to pay more to get quality, right? So why compare this to the price of the rest of the places in Brooklyn, and a majority of the places in Manhattan, when they're not even comparable? They're not in the same category. Sure, I'm probably a little jaded to Park Slope prices, so I didn't get sticker shock, but I'd resigned myself to only ever eating that middling sushi if I wanted to get it in Brooklyn, and this place has changed my mind.Please go here, and you'll come to appreciate fish in a new light. I promise."], ["Jessica A.", "I had the chef's sushi omakase and it was a fantastic deal for the quality. \u00a0There was freshly grated wasabi, real yuzu, and the fish was very fresh. \u00a0We ate at the bar and got to watch the chef work his magic. \u00a0I was very impressed by the quality, and thoroughly enjoyed the sushi's garnishes. \u00a0These aren't plain fish on rice with a dab of green paste, each course is thoughtfully accented with different flavors like spicy, sweet, tart... \u00a0I highly recommend."], ["Hudson H.", "Review only for Omakase:Fantastic! Great variety and freshness. I've always paired with a bottle of sake. The wait staff always make excellent recommendations for sake.

Always the freshest fish with just the right condiment topping to make each bite phenomenal! I have always sat at the sushi bar. I love to see the way they prepare it and serve it, its just so much more personal, kind of feels like they are your personal chef. lolI always get the Omakase which consists of the daily, fresh fishs available. always ask about their special apps. Never know what you will get but always good. ive had the hamachi kama (yellowtail neck), seared tuna skewers, and my favorite UNI in a shell. ALL SOOO GOOD THAT ONCE YOU FINISH YOU WILL PONDER TO GET ANOTHER! If you like Sushi, eat here, not many places can compare. They have outdoor seating now, couple of beers, sake, and i think wine."], ["Joe L.", "Best sushi place I have ever been to, hands down. Order the omakase and double up on the fried oyster."], ["Alis N.", "The restaurant has a nice ambiance. The food was okay. We got the sashimi deluxe, sushi deluxe, real crab California roll, agedashi tofu, horse mackerel with ginger and scallion dressing, and the mushroom appetizer. Nothing stood out. Everything was more average. I wouldn't say it's the best in Brooklyn. Small portion. DEFINITELY not a real Japanese place."], ["Justin S.", "I was skeptical to stray from my sushi staples--Geido and Taro-- but I was pleasantly surprised when I visited Katsuei. (Side note has anyone else experienced lackluster meals from Geido in recent months?) Katsuei's ambiance is minimal but nice. We sat at the sushi bar and had the omekase sushi. Now I've had my fair share of omekase's and I would have to say this has beat some of its pricier Manhattan rivals (Neta cough cough). Plus, it was very entertaining to see the knife skills behind the bar. For $45 we had 9 pieces of sushi and one hand roll. Included was fatty toro, giant clam, squid, marinated tuna, ikura (as a sub for Uni which I don't care for), and more. All were extremely fresh and the giant clam and squid was not chewy at all which I was surprised to find (a sign of a good sushi place). A nice surprise was the hand roll which was not the normal cone shape but more like a thin rectangle and made with fresh crunchy seaweed (reminiscent of an onigiri from Caf\u00e9 Zaiya).I hesitated to write this review because I don't want it to be overrun like some of the other Park Slope restaurants but I want this to succeed because it is really good and we're lacking decent restaurants in Center Slope. So try it and sit at the bar and order the omekase, you won't be disappointed. BTW, they don't have their liquor license yet since they're still in soft launch mode. They're doing BYO though."], ["Steve B.", "BEST SUSHI IN PARK SLOPE HANDS DOWN! Maybe even Brooklyn?Sushi Katsuei is the real deal with a trained, Japanese staff that knows what it is doing. The omakase sounded amazing when I was there but I decided to opt for the chirashi (umi no sachi on the menu). It was amazing.I really love sushi and I've had some good sushi experiences before but this was something out of this world fantastic. The fish all melted in my mouth and I could really appreciate the different tastes of each fish from the tuna's savory meatiness to the sweetness of a piece of clam.I also tried their red miso mushroom soup to start which was an earthy and satisfying take on the tofu, seaweed soup most places have (though fyi, they have class miso soup here too!). Their green tea is superb and waitress was walking around with a carafe ready to refill everyone's cup.Dessert is fantastic too with green tea ice cream and mochi available- I got to try both and each was among the best I've ever had. The green tea ice cream tastes intensely of matcha and is not overly sweet. The mochi have a great ice cream to rice wrapper ratio and are well-sized and tasty. The decor is great too with white table cloths, frosted glass, minimalist interior and beautiful plates and bowls to eat on.I really hope they succeed! Park Slope is full of sushi spots but none are actually any good. Sushi Katsuei is authentic, fresh, delicious, and hospitable!"], ["Ian A.", "Welcome to the neighborhood, Katsuei. \u00a0After reading about it on Park Slope Stoop, we've eat here a few times now. \u00a0First thing: \u00a0this is not like any other Park Slope sushi restaurant. \u00a0In fact, I don't think there is a sushi restaurant like this in South Brooklyn. \u00a0I am a Geido for eat-in, Inaka for take-out sushi eater. \u00a0But this place is in a different league in terms of quality of fish and presentation. \u00a0Katsuei is Brooklyn's 15 East, but without the ambiance (yet). \u00a0Tl; dr: \u00a0it is a fancy sushi place, it is not a take-out roll factory.Second thing: \u00a0The fish is amazing and interesting, and the presentation is lovely. \u00a0My partner had the sushi omakase, I had sushi and sashimi. \u00a0With a a miso soup (not included--I think it should be for the price) and 2 green teas, the meal cost us about 150. \u00a0Cheaper than a great omakase in the city, but expensive for the neighborhood. \u00a0Still, the food was worth it. \u00a0Amazing and different varieties of fish, and two enormous and perfectly pieces of uni. \u00a0The chef walked us through each dish and did a nice presentation. \u00a0Seriously, the fish is awesome and worth it.Tl; dr: \u00a0awesome fish.Third thing: this is a fancy special occasion restaurant (if you go omakase, there appears to some cheaper choices) stuck in the wrong space. \u00a0They are paying for a garden when they do not need to, and while their layout is nice, it is not dark, intimate enough to feel like a special date spot. \u00a0If I had a vote, I would tell them to go to a smaller space in the same neighborhood. \u00a0They should be an 8 table restaurant with a long sushi bar in a narrow dark space. \u00a0Still, they did a nice job on the renovation, it is just not perfect. Tl; dr: \u00a0ambiance is ok.

Their only response was to basically call me a liar by saying I took too long to call them and let them know. After a while another woman got in he phone and said \"oh yeah maybe there was a mix up\" and said she would credit my account. Took down my name and number.The next week I called to order again, reminded them of my credit only to have them transfer me to 2-3 people all which who said they don't do that.Boo."], ["Gillian C.", "OK sushi, pretty average Americanized sushi, generally. Looking at the menu, it seems a bit pricey for what it is, but there aren't many Japanese places nearby, so I guess they're capitalizing on that. Also, we went on a really hot day, and it was equally hot inside, which wasn't so pleasant. We were really hungry, so we got the dinner boxes. At $17, I suppose you got a fair amount of food. I got the beef negimaki, and the beef was a bit tough, the scallions a bit much, and the whole thing was swimming in dilute teriyaki sauce. Not super appealing. The rest of it was pretty standard American sushi bento stuff - salad, miso soup, shumai, tempura, california roll. All decent, but not stellar."], ["Samantha M.", "My parents live in the area so my mom and I decided to stop in and see what this new Japanese place was all about. I am so glad we came in! I ordered the rock shrimp dinner box that came with rock shrimp, a California roll, tempura and shumai! The rock shrimp was so delicious with the mayonnaise sauce. My mom got shrimp pad thai that was also very delicious. The soda I ordered was brought out in can and a glass but I never had to touch the can, my waiter always refilled it for me! When it came to boxing the rest of my dinner, my waiter took care of that as well so the service was awesome! Can't wait to come again and try more.

Approximately cut, let's say 3/4 of a centimeter? Wish I had taken a photo, because what you get at looks nothing like what you see in the photos. The prices are fair for mediocre sushi, but the portions are so small compared to other sushi bars out there. We ordered 4 rolls, 2 salads, and one entree that came to over $100 after tips. The servers aren't the friendliest either. Not a smile on their face.The sashimi is a whole different story. Quite large pieces actually but the taste is unbearable.

Immediate seating on a Saturday around 3pm. Quick and friendly service. Be sure to ask questions and seek clarification on what you're ordering as there's not too much explanation on what the Asian terms are. You may be disappointed if it's not clear you're getting a roll versus a \"bomb\" aka a mound of rice, versus a hand roll etc.... I wish there were more noodle dishes on the lunch menu, too. Cash only which is always an unnecessary obstacle. Overall, you'll spend maybe $15 or $20/person on a roll or two and a drink. Props for the vegan options and tofu cream cheese. Menu is very clear on vegan and vegetarian options, because duh this is Bushwick."], ["Lilian N.", "I would never have discovered this place if I wasn't in the area to pick up some fabric from a friend's place. She recommended this place for a quick bite. I was really sketchy at first because it was so dark and hidden but for sure it is a hidden gem!Perhaps one of the most unique sushi places I've been to. Besides the fact that waiters dress incredibly casual and its inside an old garage, the chefs really know how to make a good maki. We ordered a couple of different ones plus a Japanese-ceviche style dish with assorted sashimi mixed with yuzu. absolutely delicious and refreshing with the fruit. Pretty much all the rolls we got had a unique element to it. We loved the crunchy roll and kani roll but I can't remember right now what's in it besides friend tempura. I would definitely come back if I ever happen to be in the area (but otherwise it is quite out of my way)"], ["Latef X.", "Food here is okay, but nothing amazing or unique. \u00a0Veggie cold noodles were a little bland and overall too simple -- nothing pops out about it. \u00a0Also the sauce was pretty watery and flavorless. \u00a0Shrug, edible. \u00a0Pork ramen is a really small portion for Japanese ramen -- was okay, nothing great. \u00a0Maybe their standard menu instead of lunch specials are better considering all the high Yelp ratings.The vibe in here is a little weird for lunch -- really REALLY dark with these warehouse fluorescent lights. \u00a0Communal seating at long tables. \u00a0Kinda felt like a drug addict hanging out there.Service was really REALLY friendly. \u00a0The server was super attentive, checked in several times to make sure we were doing well. \u00a0Just overall really nice and seemed genuinely concerned that we had a good meal. \u00a0She was super cute too -- always a plus. \u00a0:)"], ["Marina S.", "Places like Momo Sushi Shack are the reason why I love living in Bushwick. Like most of the excellent restaurants here, you wouldn't know what's inside just by walking by on the street, which is probably for the better- I don't want to share! Nevertheless, I'm actually embarrassed that it took me this long to come to Momo, as I walk past it on my way to the train literally every day. Now, I can't wait to come back.There was no wait at 7pm on a Saturday night, but the communal tables inside filled up quickly while we were eating. Momo is great for groups if you get there early enough, but the atmosphere is still dark and cozy enough for a date. More importantly, the food is great for sharing and seriously *da bomb*.With that segue (I know, I'm the worst)...we tried:Party Bomb - a sampler of all of their sushi \"bombs,\" which are basically nigiri shaped into a ball. These were great, but there was a lot of rice compared to the fish and they weren't super exciting. Next time, I would probably just order our favorite out of the sampler on its own, the Spicy McBomb (tuna, cucumber, spicy mayo, katafi).Momo Salad - a huuuge portion of greens and seasonal vegetables in a really delicious Asian dressing. I could have eaten this on its own for my meal and been completely stuffed. The salad is topped with some nice crispy shallots for texture and was super fresh.Pork Belly - this was probably the best thing I've eaten all week. Whatever you at Momo Sushi Shack, I don't care- just order this and thank me later. The pork belly was literally falling apart as we tried to shovel it in our mouths, and so incredibly tender. It's steeped in this really nice soy sauce, which I probably would have drank if it was socially acceptable. Oh well, maybe next time.Be warned- Momo Sushi Shack is cash only, but that's probably the only downside to this incredible restaurant."], ["Alex R.", "My mind is blown that MoMo could receive anything but a 5-Star rating. I've recently come to terms with the fact that I need to get a Yelp account to find all the hot spots and plan a night worth spending, and MoMo is for sure the first spot I could think to review.Phil, the owner, is really something else. I've read a few reviews here saying, and I paraphrase, \"Our server Phil was very helpful\"....HE'S NOT THE SERVERBut that's just what makes him a great guy and what makes MoMo a great place; it's a spot to sit back, makes some friends (easy to do while sitting on a benched table), and enjoy a meal that's been made to impress. My first time eating here was three years ago on an unplanned night out, and what a night it turned out to be. I was a young entrepreneur and happened to talk to Phil about my business venture, and he gave me guidance that no other mentor has before. To this day I haven't met a more approachable and caring person than Phil, and he was just a complete stranger to me then! He really does care about every customer and making sure their experience is a memorable one. I know this rating is a bit off topic from food, but the bottom line is that the food is fantastic. Phil really puts his heart and soul into every piece. He is the epitome of the phrase \"if you do something you love you won't work a day\", and that is what makes MoMo great because it's not a business, it's a studio where food is made and music is played (good music btw), but I'm just a youngin so what does my testimony count for? Go experience it for yourself and you'll just see what I've been raving about.P.S. Yeah yeah yeah I know it's cash only, but there's an ATM right outside and the prices are good so don't let not paying with plastic stop you."], ["Virginia Y.", "After failing to get seated at Bozu on an impromptu trip to Williamsburg, I somehow came to Momo sushi shack since they had availability. The shack is pretty hidden, they literally use camouflage print to \" hi(ghtlight)de\" it. It also didn't help that I came during the evening so it's even harder to spot. The moment I walked in, the place was dark and rap was playing. \"This place is so Bushwick\" I thought. The rabbit taxidermy was pretty funny and so was their extra + on their sanitation grade of A(+). I was seated at a communal table and greeted by our server Philip who was pretty helpful in answering all our questions.After scouring on yelp tips and looking at the menu, I decided to go for the party bomb and heritage pork betty with an extra egg. However I was brought to a panic when I realized it was cash only. I'm used to places that take plastic, I wasn't sure if I had enough but luckily my date did so we were fine. The pork betty was the bomb diggity! My eyes lit up the moment it touched my mouth. The first bite was love and it was the best bite of all. The pork belly literally melted on my tongue and it was oozing with flavor. The sauce was so good, I finished every drip of it with my rice. The party bomb was interesting, I've never had sushi like that before and I loved how the dome shaped pieces fit perfectly in my mouth. My favorite pieces were the mc low bomb and pink bomb. The una eel bomb wasn't bad either, I usually avoid eating eel because of the briny and fishy taste but for some reason it was actually good here. The party bombs are served with premixed soy sauces that comes in three ways, one with non wasabi, one with a little wasabi and one with a lot wasabi. I was still a bit hungry afterward so I scoured the menu for more food, I was shocked to find out that their wagyu beef nigiri ran for $15 a pop!!!!!! They offer maine uni nigiri for $9 and hokkaido uni for $12.. I really wanted to order it but decided to hold back since that would be nearly half my bill plus Ki Sushi offers hokkaido uni for $9. I ended up getting the spicy scallop hand roll. The roll was okay, not as spectacular as their best selling dishes but not horrible either. I'm taking one star off because their cash only policy which is really inconvenient. In defense, food isn't exactly dirt cheap here and who would carry around $100 for dinner?? P.S. I also realized their menu was incredibly similar to Bozu's, I later found out through Google that the restaurants are owned by the same guy. Who would've guessed right? Now I can remove Bozu off my bucket list."], ["Morgan C.", "Momooooooo.....You may be my new favorite sushi spot!Party (bomb) in my mouth. Something incredibly satisfying about plopping these disc like pieces of sushi onto your tongue. Being a salmon nigiri fiend, I thought the pink bombs (salmon) would be my favorite. I ended up having to fight my friend for the crispy tuna bombs. I could literally eat 20 of these. so amaze-balls. they bring you PRE-MIXED wasabi soy sauce. not sure why this is such a big deal to me, but I really appreciated this touch.The sake \"carafes\" are closer to full bottles. More than enough to get your buzz on. Our server was super quirky: part magician, part card dealer? Had a very odd (but entertaining!) way of placing all of our food, chopsticks, etc. onto the table. Staff all very sushi-savvy. The restaurant is great. Super low-key and bizarrely decorated. Long community style tables, each made out of the trunk of a whole tree!Place not only has character, but fresh AND creative sushi. Add it to your \"must\" list."], ["Cindy L.", "The service is good. They let us come in early before opening on a very cold day. The fish tastes very fresh. The rolls are kinda small. It's like they are going for fancy baby food or something.

However, I highly prefer and recommend their mother restaurant, Bozu. Bozu has a better menu, more option, better atmosphere and more seating.We waited over 45 minutes to eat at MoMo on a Sunday evening, around 9:00. The menu was very limited compared to Bozu, and you had no privacy as you are rubbing elbows with the party next to you.Do yourself a favor and go to Bozu instead.

Will definitely recommend to others and be back."], ["Jason W.", "Saturday night game plan: Eat at one of Makoto Suzuki's \"Japanese tapas\" restaurants, and try the sushi bombs. Bozu was our first stop, and we were quoted a wait of two (!!!!!) hours. His food is good, but not THAT good!Decided to give Momo a call before showing up, and they said we could be seated if we got there in 15 minutes because someone canceled. We HUSTLED over there, and were seated right away.We ordered the crowd favorites: party bomb (mix set of all four sushi bomb variations) and the pork betty, an intentional misnomer for pork belly. I don't know how he did it, but I think Mr. Suzuki has discovered the best way to cook pork belly, that gives it the perfect balance of texture and flavor. Hands down the best I've ever had! Sushi bombs were a yummy, creative twist on nigiri sushi, though the meat was very thinly sliced and sometimes overshadowed by the sauce or any soy sauce you add to it. My favorite was the eel bomb.Despite wanting to have some sushi, I ended up not ordering any as I found theirs to be a little overpriced. $34 for a nigiri set of 6 pieces, $12 for a piece Hokkaido uni, and $15 for one Wagyu beef nigiri all give the fancy Manhattan sushi houses a run for their money. Also, cash only?!? Who carries around that much dough to eat sushi with these days? I'm pretty sure they own the ATM right outside, which I had to use to pay for the meal. You'd think with the savings from being cash only, they'd make their sushi more affordable.Dislikes aside, I was quite happy with my meal. I would come back only for the Pork Betty, but probably not to Momo since they serve it at his other restaurants and they each have their own specialty dishes."], ["Eddie B.", "The salad was excellent the dressing was mixed in perfectly. Very good pork Katsu, but was needing a little more kick to it. Know my girlfriend had amazing pork goyza it had flavor in and outside of the dumpling which made them very tasty.

Yes, there's an ATM outside, but it's insulting. Your Way Cafe up the street which is a TINY LITTLE COFFEE SHOP that serves 5 dollar breakfast burritos takes cards. I mean I love playing the \"How much can I eat with all the singles I have left from bar hopping\" but please be a grown up. You guys are always packed. Please join the late 20th century. I WILL PAY A DOLLAR MORE PER ITEM IF YOU DECIDE TO TAKE CARDS.Anyways, the food is awesome, I like the chicken a ton, both times I've been, the tuna + avocado bombs have been spectacular, the hand rolls served in shot glasses are a tiny 5 dollar treats of Guy Fieri Blackjack Dealer of Flavortown. Even their sake list is decent for a place that is ... cash only. :(Love the wasabi presentation of Lots, Mid, Little so I don't need to bother mixing like some sort of caveman.Ambiance is a bit naff, with communal tables and lighting/ceiling that is more shipping container than what you would expect, but it's also Bushwick/(or as they say \"East Williamsburg\"), so I should be thankful there's not a dozen Edison bulbs.Staff is diverse, friendly, and helpful. Muah.4/5 stars."], ["Ann L.", "Owned by the same people of Bozu in Williamsburg, Momo Sushi Shack serves the same stellar dishes! Pros:* I prefer this location more than Bozu because it sits right outside the Morgan Avenue stop on the L, where Bozu would be a 15-20 min walk from Bedford* Comfortable and inclusive environment where all the tables are communal. The decor is super quirky especially with the stuffed rabbit head with antlers. * On a 7PM on Sunday, the place was empty with no wait needed* Love and recommend the Tuna Tartare w/ quail egg and any of their sushi rolls (fish is fresh and rice done just right). * They also offer a wide variety of sumptuous non-sushi items such as Fried Chicken, Heritage Pork Betty (sake, soy sauce, cilantro, wasabi cream), Gyoza, Udon Noodles, Ramen, and Rice Croquettes! Honestly it's always so hard to choose what you want here- because everything is so good! * Although they did raise their prices $1-2 for certain items, overall Momo is super affordable - my GFs kept saying \"WOW the prices here are amazing!\" 1 drink, 3 shared rolls, 1 shared party bombs, and 2 shared appetizers, came to $27/person including tax and tip! * Great service! Cons:* Although the famous Party Bombs $19 (spicy mc bomb, mc low bomb, pink bomb, and choice of spicy una, una or vegan eel bomb) are beautifully presented and delicious, the rice to fish ratio is bleak and you get at least 3 times more rice than fish. Won't be ordering this next time. \u00a0Cons:* Cash only! They have an ATM right outside that charges $2 fee."], ["Maria G.", "My favorite restaurant. I could eat their inventive rolls and fresh fish for days. They even created their own format of roll here- the \"bomb\"!

Also, all of their specials are fresh and delicious. #1 rule when coming here: share everything!!! #2 rule: bring cash."], ["Caroline D.", "The sushi is pretty good. This is a fusion spot - no fresh ginger here! Had the squash/shiitake mushroom appetizer which was delicious! Also got inari, AB spicy (shrimp), eel una bomb, spicy tuna hand roll, oyako, and the ramo veggie sushi. One surprising thing was that the tuna tasted as if it were from a can - kinda not cool for a sushi spot! All the other rolls were well made and freshly presented. Cool space but very loud during Wednesday dinner time. The waiter who was serving the couple next to us was being SO loud. It's a hang, for sure."], ["Jennifer S.", "Cute place, loved the karaage chicken, also had a lamb ramen special with pork broth (I think?).

The pork belly and party bomb were particularly disappointing, as those were both highly recommended items based on reviews. We were left scratching our heads as to why others gave such high ratings. \u00a0The sashimi quality is average and the cooked food was also not memorable.

It's all sushi fusion, not much sushi, and I wish they would label it as such in case you had in your head you were going for traditional sushi, or close to it, but sushi noneless.

Good flavors, I like the ideas of what the chef is putting on top, but the rice is so so and the fish I couldn't tell you since it's so little you barely get the taste for it.Oh yeah, they served the nigori as if it was a cocktail...in a tumbler glass, two ounces or so ... What?"], ["Travis G.", "The sushi was fresh tasty and fun. Flavors were in a range from bold to complex but always rewarding to the palate. Very highly recommended.
