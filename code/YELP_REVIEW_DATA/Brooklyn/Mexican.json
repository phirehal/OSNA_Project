Mexican food ( yet another but nothing like the others). \u00a0I have tried their \u00a0 Chicken taco platter that came with nice side portions of rice and black beans.Let me tell you I was not that hungry but There were no leftovers for the cats ;).It was simply delicious. In particular the Tacos that were just the right texture. All of it tasted really fresh. I am not a big alcohols fan but their bar looks intimate and nice, great place for first dates and groups.The place is Well designed with a very cool motif Mexican modern style. It's a great addition to the neighborhood. Prices are fair for what you get. They also have some original Mexican soft drinks that was nice to see ( if you ever visit Mexico you would know ).Don Chingon \u00a0- I will be visiting you more..."], ["ZACK R.", "Not sure how to explain it...the food here is amazing! I'm a bit of a connoisseur of Mex food, and this is one of the best spots in NYC. HOLY CRAP! Try everything!"], ["Adriann B.", "Stopped in with a friend to give Don Chingon a try......I'm glad I did! The fish tacos were fresh, very tasty and had a hint of spice. Even the rice and beans were delicious. \u00a0Needless to say, I'll be back!Marco was our waiter and he was great....very attentive and gave great drink suggestions."], ["Jennifer M.", "Best margarita I've ever had in my life. Jalape\u00f1o infused, a little kick, but not overly spicy to ruin the tequila flavor...come here for margaritas...anywhere else is a waste of time"], ["Charles R.", "Delicious, delightful and always good service. Why can't more spots in this neighborhood be like this place? Both the quesadillas and burritos are fantastic. Margaritas are B+...never really all that memorable. I'd stick with beer. But solid choice for Mexican food in this area."], ["Marcello D.", "The food was amazing here! We had fish tacos which the waiter kindly recommended, steak quesadilla and guacamole! Everything was so fresh and delicious , for cocktails we had the strawberry mint margarita which were delicious I would def recommend this place to friends. Great atmosphere and decor!"], ["Christine C.", "Dear lord, tasty tacos, strong margaritas, high quality tequilas, fresh salsas, handmade tortillas and excellent Guacamole (with grapes; sounds weird but was actually delicious). Myself and 2 other friends went there before the Madonna concert at Barclays and decided to split a selection of things. We had the queso (good), guacamole (excellent!), carnitas tacos (amaze-balls), steak quesadillas (great), and chicken tacos (good). My favorite, hands down are the carnitas. Must order! Steak quesadillas and chicken tacos were also really delicious. We each had a couple margaritas which were strong, with fresh flavors/juices and well made. Not sickly sweet like some of the 'ritas in this town tend to be. One of my friends who came with us was very knowledgeable about tequilas and was impressed by the selection. All around a great experience! Oh, and don't forget to get your picture in front of the Don Chignon mural outside!"], ["Jon S.", "Great food, service, and vibe. Totally worth a visit, even if you have bushy eyebrows."], ["Lori M.", "We got the chicken (only dark meat) and steak burritos and they were delicious. It comes with black beans and rice along with sour cream, guacamole and Pico DE Gallo on the side. The burritos are grilled and tasty. Drinks are a little pricey. The house Margarita comes with a chili pepper. It was a little slow to get served but the meal itself made up for it"], ["Sonny T.", "Pollo Burrito is mouth watering! The staffs are great and the place itself is tiny with a bar. It's \u00a0more for really small group from 4 or less. But the food will leave you full and satisfied."], ["Andrea M.", "Walked over for lunch on Labor Day after spotting the menu the week before. We are vegetarians who love Mexican but it's often hard to find new, interesting options so it was a nice surprise to see tempura avocado tacos and the potato, spinach and poblano pepper burrito. The service was great, the margaritas were delicious and the husk-on elote corn on the cob was perfectly dressed with crema and spices. We will definitely be back and will recommend to friends!"], ["Dan W.", "Since my last review of Don Chingon got removed by Yelp for not being lengthy enough, here's another one to show my love for this place. When I first moved to the area 1 1/2 years ago, there was a serious dearth of quality Mexican food. Then Don Chingon opened, and my life changed immeasurably for the better. My first bite of the pomegranate and grape guacamole shook me to my core. I probably get their quesadilla platter delivered to my apartment more often than I should. One of my favorite discoveries happened a few weeks ago when I was browsing the menu and couldn't decide between rice, black beans and refried beans because (to be honest) I just wanted all three. Then I saw the trio. For $4.00, you get all three!In summary, Don Chingon is unquestionably the best Mexican food around."], ["Shari J.", "Awesome place to come for a bit to eat. The meal was flavorful and savory. I had the chicken quesadilla words cannot explain how good it was. The black beans , it felt like I was eating a hint of heaven.The bartender George amazing and attentive, lovely guy. I didn't have a drink because I came on my lunch break but the water was ice cold and amazing. Very chill atmosphere."], ["Luis F.", "I've been eyeing it since it opened across the street from Bark & Bergen Comics. Stopped in here with a group of friends for my wife's birthday as sort a casual last minute thought. We had never been before. The seating is limited and very casual but it was perfect for what we wanted. The service was fast and friendly. The food was very tasty and came in a reasonable amount of time. Everyone really enjoyed their meals and at the end of the night we were all happy we decided to stumble into Don Chingon. If you're getting a margarita I'd favor the Dulce & Caliente over the house margarita. The house was decent but the D&C was more of a flavor experience. I can also recommend the carnitas tacos & the house salsas. Good stuff all around."], ["Guy I.", "I don't get the reviews of this place, blows me away that people are saying this is a great place. We walked in thinking we'd have dinner at 9:37, not knowing that it closed at 10. Now granted the bar tender who sat us could have said \"hey, we close at ten\" but he didn't and instead seats us. We were the only people in the joint and when the waiter comes over informs us that their kitchen closes at ten, no mention that they close at ten. so we both order a margarita, he asks \"the house one\" we say sure, i was beat and just wanted a drink. and while sitting there looking at the menu i my spider senses started tingling and at the last second we decide that no, we wont order food. thank god we didn't because the house margarita that were served to us were possibly the worst i've ever had in my life. Nothing but sour mix in a small glass that was mostly ice, mixed weakly i may add. while sucking down this abomination as fast as we could it became clear that not only does their kitchen close at ten but they were in fact shutting down, and that pisses me off because they were essentially going to let us order food and then break down the place around us. not a very conducive setting for a chill night. but i'm sure the waiter figured they could force in one more order than rush us out the door. so we finished and i just stood up and told them to close me out and while doing that the bar tender has the balls to tell me we could still hang out if wanted? why so I could pay another $22 bucks for total shit? yeah fuck that and fuck this place."], ["Katy C.", "Not sure I understand the predominance of 5 star reviews here, to me, 5 stars means I was blown away by the food, service, ambiance, all while factoring price into the equation. Our experience warranted 3 stars, 4 for food, minus one because we left feeling like we were overcharged.Hubby and I came for lunch and our server asked us if we wanted drinks or apps almost as soon as we sat down - felt a little pushy and eager to bulk up the bill. Hubby ordered the chicken burrito off the lunch menu and said it was quite tasty, the burrito tortilla was nicely browned on the outside but from my perspective it looked small. He added a seltzer to his order, which came in a small glass and no refills for $3.I wanted tacos but the lunch menu only includes chicen tacos so I ordered three tacos a la carte, the avocado, the fish and the carnitas - all were quite tasty and the soft tortillas were slightly crispy and didn't fall apart as soon as you picked them up. Somehow the server put in my order as a combo plate with rice and beans, which I didn't ask for, and which wound up costing an extra $3-4 from what the 3 tacos by themselves would've cost. I figured I'd try the rice and beans that I wasn't expecting rather than complain, the rice was herb-y, the black beans were ok, in retrospect the experiment wasn't worth the $3-4. I should've asked our server to fix the order.They've done a nice job with the amibiance/decor for an awkward sized space that can feel dark, it's nice that the windows on the Flatbush size open.All in all, given the mis/overcharging, I don't expect to be returning soon/often. Also, Calexico's lunch special is a much better deal and offers more taco variety."], ["Kingludy S.", "Interesting. Flavorless. There is nothing like poor Mexican food, especially when it comes to the only thing you really have to offer. The tacos were smaller than most dollar sized pancakes and served with watery pico de gallo. Not much going on in here. The coolest thing was probably the wall paper."], ["Brandon R.", "This place is our new regular spot!! The salsa appetizer is fantastic, my favorite is the habanero. \u00a0The tacos could not be better. \u00a0Each taco is the perfect proportion of meat to tortilla. \u00a0Our margaritas were perfectly balanced, not too sweet, not too acidic. \u00a0Vic, our bartender was friendly, helpful and attentive. \u00a0He recognized us from dining there 4 months ago. \u00a0Go. There. Immediately."], ["Anne B.", "Serving seven people before a concert, with people arriving at different times and each with varying degrees of hunger and dietary needs to boot, I imagine is the food service industry's idea of at least one of the seven circles of hell. But the staff at this awesome little find handled our meals beautifully. This is a very inventive take on Mexican - everything has a twist of some sort which even when not to my traditional taste was really really wonderful, and that's saying something.... ...because what I don't like much in cusine is food that's sweet. I'm eastern european - the first time I saw stuffed cabbage with raisins I almost hurled. I grew up in a house where fruit was for sangria and dessert - with savory in between; take your grapefruit segments and melon soups and shove 'em. Seriously - anything beyond a splash of lemon makes me trepidatious with all but the most assured of kitchens. So imagine my surprise when I found damned near everything Don Chingon put before me accented with some sweet spin - and it worked damned near all the time. For ME!We sat at their communal table, and tucked into their warm chips and knockout guac - sweet #1: Of the three salsas the one that hit home for me was their pinapple jalape\u00f1o, with the charred tomato salsa a close second, and the very traditional verde still memorable. Sweet #2: The guacammole arrived with accents of pomegranate and grapes - yes, GRAPES. Son of a bitch - it WORKED. Might not be something I'd make myself, but it was a refreshing surprise on the first truly hot night in Brooklyn.I opted for the taco trio for my main course. These are not big tacos, but they are of a thickness closer to a blini than a traditional taco, and were varied and delicious. I chose a tempura-fried avocado taco that was unusual and delicious, a chipotle chicken taco beautifullly complimented with an avocado salsa, and a tempura-fried pollock taco (a fish special, and sweet #3) with more of that killer pineapple salsa. It was just enough for me. Three of the friends closest to me opted for the fish of the day, which was a very un-Mexican salmon. They all loved it. Further down the table one of the latecomers waxed raphsodic about her tortilla soup. One of my guests received an entree she didn't order, but I think it was nobody's fault. Truly. And the meal came out in record time, a burrito so large she couldn't finish it. Another friend loosened his belt and helped her, pronouncing the dish 'spectacular'.The one instance, ironically, where the sweetness (#4) proved too much for me was the margarita; even without the simple syrup, it was a Cointreau overdose. Maybe had I opted for the salt it would have helped, but next time I'll probably stick to a tequila w/soda and lime, like one of our party had; I tried it and preferred it to my own drink. The decor is awesome in this small and unusual piece of real estate, with one of the coolest bathroom sinks I've seen in ages. \u00a0The manager (?), Vic, met us outside and chatted with us as we waited for our taxis - a great guy \u00a0who cares for his customers and his staff. They should all be around for a good long time. \u00a0A truly surprising and satisfying dining experience. I'll be back to try more, especially the corn and that soup. \u00a0Let's see if this place will come to earn that fifth star. They're close."], ["Blue N.", "I love the tacos, they are chingones! The dough is made from scratch, and the spiciness is spot on. The margaritas are definitely worth trying. I also like the atmosphere and the music selection. \u00a0I'm glad this place opened up in the neighborhood."]], "Tacos El Bronco": [["Kwai L.", "Authentic Burrito from a truck with great ingredients, made to order, great prices. \u00a0Chipotle lost my loyalty once I discovered Taco El Bronco. \u00a0My only wish is that there were more trucks and the one nearby did Burritos in addition to Tacos.This truck is great for getting an authentic taste of the Sunset Park neighborhood and its food and culture.Old men sit on lawn chairs outside in front of the truck waiting for their burrito in the summer and even at 11 pm when you need a Burrito fix you can find this truck surrounded by locals.Perfect for eating after leaving the bar and the weekend subway dropped you on the other side of town \"snack\"."], ["Michelle X.", "OMG the tacos here are so good and cheap!It starts at $1.50 for the small tacos, there are a lot of fillings to choose from.We ordered 8 tacos, a tostada, horchata, and a mango smoothie, it came out to $23 total.There is a lot of seating in the restaurant. You also get complimentary chips&salsa. :)The bistec tostada was amazing, so crunchy, and so flavorful. It was weird though because the bistec for the taco wasn't as flavorful and tasted differently. so they might use a different batch of meat for tacos/tostada or everything else in the tostada made the meat taste so much better.All of the meat were delicious and moist, only the spicy pork was a bit dry and disappointing. If you like very soft meat, try the veal head!Their horchata is a bit watered down. The mango smoothie had a lot of milk in it, wished i could have tasted more mango.I would love to come back for more tacos and to try some of their entrees."], ["David R.", "Unreal tacos for NYC. Great prices, with just the right amount of fuck-you attitude.The shrimp sauce was on the next level and the salsa is spicy and the cactus is out of this world. Get in before the hipsters ruin it."], ["Ny'ker S.", "Don't know what the fuss is about. Their chicken tacos are the worse in the neighborhood. I got it from the truck on 5th Avenue."], ["Kristin M.", "Really delicious little joint. We tried the regular (with guacamole, cilantro, and onion) tacos with carnitas, roast pork, chicken, and steak. I especially loved the carnitas and roast pork, but they were all great. I think next time, I'd probably go with the small tacos (no guac, cilantro, and onions), but for an extra buck, they were very generous servings. No wait for dinner on a Thursday night. The place was spacious and service was great. I'll definitely be back to try the chorizo y queso!"], ["JL K.", "Come hungry because you're going to leave rolling out; full and sleepy! Mostly everything is seasoned well with succulent meats that don't need extra sauces, except their steak. It has been a while since we have found an authentic Mexican restaurant which has seasoned their steak without drying it out. You can douse it it the delicious sauces provided. The rice is coated with just enough oil to not be dry and gives good tomatoes flavor that doesn't acidulously cover the beans and fresh lettuce and avocados. Unless you have a bottomless stomach, I can only eat either the breakfast (Huevos Rancheros) or lunch. Since its a good truck and they don't open their restaurant anymore, I take goodies home and reheat. Still delicious! They get you in and off of the line quickly so don't walk too far."], ["Chris E.", "Some of the best tacos I've ever had in my life! Everytime I searched for tacos in Brooklyn, Tacos El Bronco always came up in my results. After seeing it listed so many times, I had to FINALLY visit! It was like a subliminal message was placed into my head to go!Unfortunately, the restaurant was closed for renovation when I came here, but luckily they operate a truck as well and the truck was parked right outside their restaurant on the corner of 4th Avenue. When I approached the truck, I noticed the friendly atmosphere as there were many people sitting around in chairs and hanging out next to the truck (most of which were of Mexican descent, quite possibly families enjoying an outdoors hangout/dinner). I took a glance at the menus, as they have one for tacos and one for burritos. The menu boasted quite a long list of tacos and burritos, but being it my first time I was not planning on holding back (especially when the tacos are only $1.50-$1.75)! Can't beat that!There was a young woman taking orders and the flood gates opened as I ordered 8 tacos! --- 2 Steak, Tender Beef, 2 Chicken, Spicy Pork, Roast Pork, Mexican Sausage. It took a few minutes for the order to be ready, but I opened the 2 boxes of goodness and was automatically transported to taco heaven! The taco shells were soft, with 2 shells wrapped around the meat and there was a very generous amount of meat encapsulated within each taco. Each taco contained chopped onions and lettuce with a lime slice on the side. To bring it all together, they gave a green sauce that was amazing! It had a spicy kick to it, but it was the perfect condiment/sauce for the tacos! I put it on every single one of the tacos I ordered and quite frankly, I wish I had more!Hopefully, the next time I come back, the restaurant will be open, but for now I'm more than happy to settle for their truck!"], ["Joy Y.", "The tacos are good. I got veal tongue, spicy pork, tripe and tender beef, all in small size. For some reason it took about 30 minutes for my tacos to arrive. The tacos were very uneven in portion; I probably ate four times as much pork as tongue, which I only received a bite of. A problem I had was I didn't know how to stuff the whole onion bulb and big slices of cucumber and radishes into my tacos, and the lime wedges were tiny. Granted, all tacos tasted very good and flavorful, and the tortilla had such wonderful texture. Horchata was unfortunately quite watered down. Service was cool."], ["Faz A.", "Killer Mexican food, chilaquiles are as good as LA, fantastic service. I've come here for breakfast and lunch and it's always a treat.

The hype is real; authentic and satisfying.Be prepared to wait a little if it's busier, of course, but seeing the locals flock here is indicative of a great spot, if nothing else."], ["Anya T.", "Its nice that the restaurant start you off w/ some chips & salsa for the customers, tacos are cheap and tasy, and wait service is nice, but very VERY SLOWunfortunately my $7.50 mexican hamburger was served with AMERICAN YELLOW CHEESE- c'mon that is terrible- they should at least serve it w/ MEXICAN CHEESE- I know they got that queso blanco or queso oaxaca cheese!! its \u00a0A MEXICAN HAMBURGER!! Throw in some MEXICAN CHEESE AND AVOCADO SLICES POR FAVOR! my $2.50 horchata was SOO BLAND, especially with a mountain of ice. it just taste like water w/ a hint of sweetness. the $3 papaya smoothie tasted just like ice cream.. seriously? there isn't any papaya in there.

Other then that enjoy"], ["Coby G.", "Everything you'd want from Mexican street tacos. Good tortillas, meat, and salsas. They give you cucumbers, radishes, and a grilled onion with your tacos too (which is a huge plus). They have two salsas -- roja y verde (green and red). Tacos are priced at $1.50 each (a good price anywhere)They're serving from a truck, so you should expect to stand while you're eating, or find some curb space. The horchata is cold and comes in large quantities. I had al pastor (grilled pork) and asada (steak). The al pastor had pi\u00f1a (pineapple) and came with the tradition white onion and cilantro. The steak came with white onion and cilantro."], ["Elder M.", "This would be a five star review BUT the waiters are so serious and not too welcoming. Smile more maybe?! lol What I do appreciate is that they wear hairnets, which indicate that they are hygienic. I greatly admire the artwork that the restaurant has on its walls, it's amazing! For the food: TOUNGE tacos are BOMB.Horchata is great . That green avocado salsa is addicting and can be build-able to spicy.All other stuff like burritos & tortas are standard but good.Definitely recommend this place for late night crowds.

This has been my go-to for some cheap delicious tacos especially late night. Taco matamoros use to be my taco-craving spot many many yearss ago until they fell off the few recent years.Their tacos are loaded with onions, guac and cilantro on top, simple and just how it should be done while their meats are very flavorful!! My favorite is the tender beef... Which is clearly very tender! I just had the fried pork last night which was tasty as well but very dry... I think I prefer the al pastor more than the fried pork one.

I've been about 6 or 7 times, and ordered delivery even more often.For brunch, the frozen margaritas (which are just about perfect!) and the variety of micheladas (which you probably can't find many other places) are great additions to the food. But this is not why I go. I go for the pancakes (and I even claimed I didn't like sweets, but their butterscotch pancakes are incredible!!!), the burger, the tacos, the queso fundido, the large salads, and the decent (though inconsistent and admittedly not-stellar) service. I will note, however, that I tend to be extra nice to waitstaff, and this waitstaff reciprocates, even if they are a bit slow. Bar Bruno also happen to be awesome at delivery--fast and yummy, with never a mess-up. For this price, the food and atmosphere, are terrific.

Just like that...I was stuck on their fluffy rice and flavorful beans.The tacos were good too of course, none of that dry meat or oily situation and the ingredients were fresh. On a more recent visit, I ordered a vegetarian taco and a lengua huarache, yum! The food here is consistently good, so I definitely think they deserve a try. Overall, a really good option if you're craving Mexican food. I will be back for sure to check out the rest of their menu!

They are a cute addition and something to daydream on when you find yourself too hungry to focus on your partners conversation. We placed our orders at the counter to the cashier who was shy but a true trooper after we took our time deciding what we wanted. Hunger will not last long because your dishes come out pronto. I ordered a chicken burrito and my friend ordered tacos with a side of chips &guac .The burrito was so big! Seriously the size of your head. Cut it open and smell of rice and chicken steamed through the air. I could barely finish it. ( I did though cause it was that savory.) I also searched for the most sugary drink I could find which was fruit punch. All their drinks come in glass bottles which I like- somehow tastes better. They give you plastic cups and plastic utensils which can be a tad unusual to match with the glass plates -- but that's just the charm of El Puente. They did not rush us at all which was good . I could take my time eating, talking and watching Spanish soap opera on their flat screen. \u00a0Behind the counter the phone was ringing nonstop.

It really stuck with me and so I decided to finally go back yesterday. Usually I frequent Los hermanos. You can't beat the quality or the price. Anyway, I decided to finally have a full meal at meza Azteca and I regret it so bad. We started with the guac. Worst guac I've ever had. First off, they charge 9.50 for the smallest amount. Second, I'm almost 100% that it was prepackaged and the added some fresh tomatoes to make it look home made. The texture is just not something that can be achieved when making guac on your own. It was like mush, not a single chunk of avocado in sight. It was almost slimy if that makes any sense. We also had the Mexican corn. It was alright but the entire corn was black...way too charred, and I've had way better for 2$ less. Then we ordered a fish taco and a grilled veggie taco. The fish taco smelled and tasted fish and texturally was uninteresting. It wasn't inedible but it certainly wasn't something that was enjoyed, and for $4 it was a complete waste. The grilled veggie taco was the worst and it was the one thing that was inedible so I sent it back. The majority of the inside was saut\u00e9ed spinach. You can't even grill spinach so why would it be in a grilled veggie taco?? It had a little bit of soggy steamed squash and that was it. The whole thing was pure mush and was so unpleasant. Everything is overpriced and the taste and quality is lower than mediocre. \u00a0Save your money and go to Los hermanos down the street. They may not have all the options but at least the food is delicious and underpriced. Same thing with any of the many taco trucks around bushwick.

This was the highlight of my night. It was flavorful and fresh, but pricey for one corn on the cob. And these are our negatives:- It was REALLY busy, which is fine, and made us even more excited to try the place. However, management didn't seem to know how to handle the volume. We patiently waited 30 minutes, only to have people who came in after us get seated first. After we told the manager, and he realized his mistake, he did not apologize/recognize his mistake. - Once we were seated after waiting, we did not get menus & utensils for close to 15 minutes. - We never got water, even though we asked for it two times. - We ordered 2 Mexican corns, and only got one. We told our waitress a few times, and she still had two on our bill, which we had to dispute. - We didn't get chips and salsa, a standard at most Mexican restaurants, until after 45 minutes of being seated. - Our food took over an hour to come out. My order was wrong, under cooked, bland, and cold. Ultimately, I just moved to the area and after seeing so many positive reviews, was excited to try the place.

Other than that, I'm a big fan. I would definitely return to try the other items on their menu. I came here on a weekday and they have some great lunch specials. For $14.95, you can get an appetizer + main course + drink or a combination of a main course + dessert + drink. They also serve $1 oysters all day long. This is a great deal at a great restaurant nestled in the heart of Cobble Hill. My friend and I shared a guacamole which was made in front of us. It's nice to know that the $12 guacamole didn't come out of a can. We also tried their $1 oysters, which was tasty. It's hard to get raw oysters wrong. So as long as I didn't get sick from eating them...I ordered the lunch special which came with French Onion Soup + Grilled Hanger Steak (Medium Rare) + Hibiscus Iced-Tea. The total for my portion came to $27.50 (includes tax + tip).

The music is good. The specials are better (various lunch specials, dollar oysters, etc.). And the food is always the star. The Mama Nachos are gorgeous, perfectly proportioned (never too many chips for the toppings, and plenty of guacamole), and a meal unto themselves. The brunch options never fail, from benedicts to steak and huevos. The oysters are always fresh. My new favorite dish? The Spicy Fish & Mango salad. Well-balanced, flavorful perfection. The dressing is addictive, the fish perfectly cooked, the bits of mango and avocado seasoned well, and the sunflower seeds an excellent textural addition. For gods' sakes, they even make me like vegetarian things [when I very rarely order them]. Yes, it might gall some of you to pay $12 for a plate of two tacos, but this is a beautiful sit-down restaurant in the expensive part of expensive Brooklyn, and it's a full meal (comes with beans or rice). A damn good one, too.Basically, some things are great, and everything is good. Perhaps that's one of the reasons I don't always think of Jolie; they don't have one cravable dish that's my go-to. Rather, I want to try a different dish each time I walk through the door, because I've never really been disappointed.

The bartender who took our order was quick to notice and said he'd have the correct dish sent out right away. Since we had almost ordered the tostadas anyway we said not to worry about it. They took it off the bill without us even asking, which was nice. Then we had the seafood bouillabaisse and the short rib tostada, both were wonderful and satisfying!

Don't be afraid of their \"fusion\". It's based on years of experience and they nailed it. Came on recommendation of a local. Had the Mexican ravioli and a prickly pear mescal margarita.

Get here."], ["Kenny C.", "Did you know that French/Mexican fusion is a thing? Neither did I, but Jolie seems to.I came here for a low-key dinner with a friend. First thing we noticed is that it was dark and loud. The table next to us (full of older couples) had to pull out their cell phone lights to read the menu. But not us, we youngin's grew up with bad eyesight so we toughed it out.Was it just me, or was the menu more segreated than fused? There didn't really seem like many dishes that incorporated both Mexican and French cuisine. Sure, the decor and painted walls included French themes (a fleur de lis here and there, and the word \"Oui!\"), but aside from their cheese selection, I would've believed it if you told me it was just a fancy Mexican restaurant that will make you a Michelada with Kronenbourg.That said, the food was delicious.We shared the trio jalapeno fritas (3 stuffed japalenos). The one with the crabmeat was definitely the best. The peppers varied in spiciness, which was a fun game.We also shared the spicy ribeye taco, which I believe was 2 for $15 or $16. A bit pricey, but they were reasonably sized and the meat was cooked and sauced perfectly.For my entree, I had the spicy organic chicken enchilada. Probably the most low key of all the dishes I had, but it was filling. Big portions too.The Mexican rice is also delicious. It tasted like it had some sort of stock in it, but I believe it's vegetarian-friendly.I also have to mention that they have a good cocktail menu. I tried the El Puebla (bourbon-based Old Fashion-esque drink) and the Horse Tonic (a wonderfully named ginger and rum concoction). I liked the Horse Tonic a lot, though I also tried and enjoyed my friend's Rififi (gin, cucumber and some mint & mescal).There were a couple of service hiccups (we had several different servers, and one of them gave us the dessert menu before we even got our entrees).That, and the overly loud drunk guy at the next table, were the only exceptions to a wonderful dining experience.Hope to be back for brunch soon!

It was just a tortilla with just steak- no lettuce no tomatoes and then it had a BBQ sauce. I had explained to the bartender exactly what kind of taco I wanted which was steak taco with some avocado lettuce and tomato- which she said they could make. Maybe it was my fault for not ordering exactly what was on the menu. The restaurant is pretty small and you may have to wait a long time for a table.

The tacos are hit and miss... i've tried the Long Beach All Star, Sunset Pork, Diablo Diego, & Bohemian. \u00a0the beef in the all star desperately needed seasoning - I put it down after 1 bite. The sunset has a sweet tangy taste. The diego could use a bit more spice. The bohemian has too much shredded chicken. I won't write this place off because it is good, just not always great.

What a cute place with a cool California twist. Surfboards, wooden/brick walls, Hawaiian floral patterns, frozen margaritas....a place you would expect on a broad walk. My husband, and I strolled in for lunch on a sunny afternoon, but the ambience was too dim, they should lighten up a bit to go with the beachy feel.

The bowl of guac which seemed small at first, weren't enough chips to dip them in towards the end, but for 9 bucks, it's pretty pricey.

A few of their items on the menu are a bit cheaper if ordered in pairs.They have specials everyday of the week, and since it was a Friday, I went for the Friday: Bombora. Large sized fish sandwich served with a side of home made potato chips. You taste the freshness as soon as you take a bite of the panko crusted cod, the slaw complimented it very well by the sweetness of the red pepper. On the other hand, the tacos weren't what we expected, they were on the small side. The beef in the Long Beach All Star had chewy texture, not much flavor. The Diablo Diego stood out more out of the two tacos we shared, shrimps had a small kick of spice, I enjoyed the tangy pico de gallo.There were other items that caught my eye on their menu, like the naked burrito, \u00a0pork empanadas and their brunch.

I thought it was going to be at least \"Mexican-spicy\" but it was like white people spicy which isn't spicy AT ALL. And that was their spiciest. Even the sauces doesn't do it justice on the spicy level but the guacamole was bomb and I honestly wish they gave more for a $8 price. It was the same amount you get at chipotle except chipotle is $4 and has better chips.

And have ordered delivery from this restaurant as many times as I have walked in to patronized it in person.I have brought people here from out of town and out of the country. I have raved about Gueros so much so that when people visit they know that it is always on the list of \"must haves\". I have enjoyed the avocado tacos, queso an chips and everything else on the menu for years. As of late when I call the people that answer the phone tell me that I am no longer in the delivery zone. I am one block out of the zone, which is where I have always lived in Crown Heights. As a long time customer I would expect the same respect from a company I supported to support me. But now that our neighborhood is starting to feel like WILLIAMSBURG our neighborhood restaurant has decided to accommodate a certain demographic an exclude the people who have been there since the beginning. I remember when there was no line, no outside an barely a margarita. And the people taking your orders were cool and not pretentious.I know other people from the neighborhood who also decided to stop patronizing this restaurant, to which I replied \"NO NO NO it's wonderful\", they also have been around since the beginning an will no longer patronize due to not feeling appreciated. Although I like the food, there are NEW MEXICAN RESTAURANTS in the neighborhood that appreciate those of us who are in it for the long haul and not just passing threw for a few months.GOODBYE GUEROS THANKS FOR STAYING REAL!!!!!!!!!"], ["Courtney P.", "Guero's IS the spot. I traverse 40 minute subway rides on the reg just to come here.Tacos are good but the NACHOS are where it's AT. Steak are the best, but chicken's great too. The chips, so thin, so perfect, so crisp. The QUESO OH MY GOD I have missed Texas queso so badly, and it is amazing. The pico is so fresh, they use the reddest tomatos ever. Margaritas, super strong, and awesome. Ask for em half frozen, half not, they're dope. You'll be drunk off of just one. They're great. The place is small but cozy, and they usually bump awesome jams like the Backstreet Boys etc. Guero's, you have my heart."], ["Carla L.", "I've been here twice. \u00a0Honestly I was dismayed by how small the tacos were...but when I bit into them!! \u00a0Wow!! \u00a0They pack a punch. \u00a0The flavors melt into each other..it's spicy..complex..and yummy. \u00a0I'm surprised how satisfied I was with just three tacos. \u00a0 Now let's talk about those margaritas. \u00a0Do the half on the rocks and half frozen. \u00a0One will have you buzzin. \u00a0The seating situation sucks..but the yummy food makes it worthwhile."], ["Marlon S.", "Come here during happy hour 4pm to 7pm.. Crowd starts to swell around 530pm. Happy hour is $1 off Tacos, which is a big deal when you can get any 3 tacos and a 20oz margarita for around 20 bucks."], ["Nick T.", "It's hard not to go here every time we want to go out for food. \u00a0Tacos are great - I've tried them all at this point, and I get an Al Pastor taco every time because it's so delicious. \u00a0They bring you the food real quick and everyone that works there is super nice.You're going to want to try the chips and queso and a margarita.It can get a little rowdy in there sometimes late night but it's a good and fun atmosphere. \u00a0It can be good for dinner or for late night post bar munchies.GO NOW!!"], ["Andrew W.", "Food is a 4 or 5 stars almost everyday. Their delivery windows are terrible. I ordered delivery tonight and respected the estimated time window of 45-60 min. At 75 min I called and they told me it would be another 20 min. They offered to refund it with no food but that's insufficient. Instead I need the food and a discount. I completely understand the process of food delivery. But this isn't the first time this has happened to me with Gueros. Food alone is exemplary. Delivery is extremely subpar. Order with discretion."], ["Sally A.", "I was in the other day with my Boyfriend. When we arrived at the start of their dinner rush and there weren't any seats available for any new customers. The place is mostly counter service, so people shouldn't even be seated until they've ordered. there were people either saving seats for people or lingering with food trash building up around them. What was most annoying was one guy taking up a table for two. He had multiple devices charging, and his computer out like he was at a Starbucks. When our food arrived we had to squeeze in at the bar between two groups people. one person who was waiting for a friend, and a couple who just got drinks and no food. I didn't really get to enjoy my food. I got the fried chicken and the el pastor, both were pretty good. Though they were eaten in a rush.My boyfriend and I would've bought more food and felt more comfortable if the staff had somewhat managed their seating around them. It seems the restaurant cannot count on the consideration of others to turn over their tables. Or just eliminate your tables in general if you don't want to do table service at all. It'd be easier to turn over space in the restaurant. We left soon after eating to go somewhere else. When we walked past an HOUR LATER, the computer guy was STILL there taking up this table for two.The food is good, so I'll be back. I am just appalled by the experience of eating in here."], ["National H.", "Really busy but consistently friendly is how I would sum up the atmosphere at Gueros. The food is delicious in my opinon, and all tacos are $1 between 4-7! That means my roasted vegetable taco was a measly $2.50 which is an outrageous value.I also had the Al Pastor and Catfish most recently and all were really tasty. They are usually super crowded with loud folks but the girl behind the counter was unflappable; her smile and warm demeanor never faltered.Get yourself some Gueros but be prepared to eat outside on a stoop or something because it can be at full capacity before you know it!PS - huge self serve water jug has lemons in it. It's the little things that elevate a place!"], ["Brooke M.", "One of my favs in BK :)The queso is the BOMB!!!! Tacos & margs are great too.Its super small and gets packed but so worth it."], ["Carlina P.", "Love love margaritas \u00a0steak nachos is to die for"]], "Lucha Lucha": []}
