They serve toasted bread on the side to sop up all the juice and I sure did, leaving nothing on my plate. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!!The rest of the group had the burger (which my local friend absolutely raves about), the steak sandwich (very good and filling) and the chicken sandwich (spicy and delicious).

I ordered a Caesar salad with grilled chicken -- it took a little longer than usual to come out (due to a large party ordering and waiting for food before me, so completely normal). Salty, and perfect with the shredded kale. They make the salad with real anchovies, so those expecting a typical Caesar should not order it. However, I found it delicious! Read what is on the menu and it is exactly what they bring, so don't get upset when your salad isn't what you would \"think\" it would be.The bar area is cute and definitely a great place to order a few mimosas or beers and enjoy the warm weather.

I sat at the bar with my girlfriends and we enjoyed happy hour drinks followed by traditional Senegalese food. I was already familiar with Senegalese food because of my previous visits to Jollof restaurant in BedStuy. The food here at Cafe Rue Dix was just as good as that at Jollof. However, there was certainly a different ambience at Cafe Rue Dix. Not better, just different. It was a bit more livelier and the crowd seemed more \"hip.\" This is probably a result of the neighborhood as there are a lot of bars and restaurants cropping up in Crown Heights along Bedford and Franklin Avenues. I would \u00a0recommend this place if you are adventurous with your food choices. You'll be eating authentic Senegalese food. I had a chicken dish (Yassa Ganar) and my friends both had a fish dish (Thiebou Jen). Both dishes came with a choice of rice or cous cous. We got the rice. We also had the bread pudding which was surprisingly good. I will definitely be making more trips to this spot and hopefully get the chance to try more dishes."], ["Gingere L.", "Slow, dizzy service.

The lighting was dim and intimate.There was only one waitress who took her time. We ordered the steak sandwich with mozerrella cheese, a portabella sandwich with blue cheese and one without cheese.The service was really slow. The waitress was too laid back and it was hard to get her attention for water or for ordering. When our orders arrived, they got our order wrong: they put the mozerrella cheese on the potabella sandwich, and the blue cheese on the steak. Due to us being at work at lunch hour, we quickly finish and did not bother to let them know or risk getting back to work late. The service was too slow for us so we won't be coming back during our lunch hour.

They serve a great brunch & the menu is more so fish-oriented at night. You'll find a dimly-lit intimate (but not tiny) French-bohemian-cafe -style atmosphere with African accents that's artsy, pretty laid back & something we've needed in Crown Heights for ages. The service has been hit or miss. A few times it's been cheerful & attentive. But odd things happen like the waitress will stop & chat with you warmly like a friend but never ask if/what you need - i.e. forget to bring you a menu after the initial chat, or water (at all!) or drinks, or take your finished plate that's been sitting there demolished for 20 minutes. A few times the service has been great though, but other times I was ignored or got the feeling that the staff would rather chat with eachother than do basic server stuff - just like how it is in Paris!Food:*I've had the most amazing french toast with fruit and a to-die-for creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e syrup @ brunch* I've had the lamb - pretty good* I've had the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e & some decent cocktails. They have bitburger German beer here too which is one of my favorites. The bartender made me the most amazing sangria drink ever (since I said I was craving it) it had so many fresh strawberries it was like a fruit salad cocktail ! The flavor was amazing...then the check came - I was charged $13 or $14 for this cocktail * I tried to order the African red rice (the yummiest rice ever!) on the side or by itself to accompany another dish I ordered & they refused. I was told I could only get it with that one specific Sengalese dish it comes with:Thiedbou Jen (sp?)* have had the steak sandwich which was great & the burger which was just ok* frites/fries here are awesome * ordered a roast chicken dish awhile back (I think it's no longer on the menu) via delivery...took forever & the food was all run together & all over the bag when it arrivedOther notes: when you try to look at the menu online, you can't read it. I've told them about this twice, but the same blurry, UN-zoomable picture of the menu remains If you're expecting African food, there's like 2 - 3 things that relate to Sengalese cuisine, Thiedbou Jen (the Senegalese national dish involving stewed fish & veggies over delicious red rice) & a spicy chicken dish & maybe one other I think fish dish. Sometimes they have specials like beef stew in peanut butter sauce, which I've enjoyed at other restaurants - never here - it's very Senegalese as well. While most other dishes besides these may have some \"safe\" African accents, its kinda mainstream cafe fare ...American with Parisian aspects...for the most part - so just keep this in mind if you are looking more Sengalese-centric cuisine."]], "Chez Moi": [["Zvia S.", "Love the Chez Moi cocktail and the truffle mushroom croquettes.

Delicious. Served on the rocks. I ordered the roast chicken, hoping I wouldn't be bored by it, and oh...my....god! I didn't know chicken could be so tender and rich.

The tarte tasted more than a \"chausson aux pommes\" with apple puree on a flaky paste. Was pretty good, but definitly not a tarte tatin. Profiteroles were good, but the chocolate was too cold and wasn't liquid anymore when it came too us. The hot chocolate must be served on the choux once the plate is in front of the customer, otherwise that's what happens, cold and \"hard\" chocolate. Thae taste was here anyway.

For instance, one time we forgot our leftovers and our waiter chased us halfway down the block to make sure we got to enjoy every bite we paid for. After several visits, these are the only issues I've encountered:1. The butter they offer with their bread are the cold packets, rather than warm, convenient, spreadable butter. 2. One time they told us the risotto was roasted tomato, and it turned out to be butternut squash. Still delicious.3. One time I got my Manhattan up, instead of on the rocks. Still delicious.4.

They have a casual yet romantic vibe with dim lighting and superb service. Prices hover in the mid 20s for entrees so it's not cheap but it's affordable if you're looking for nice night out. To start I got the French onion soup ($7), the broth was addictive and the abundance of perfectly caramelized onions was great. They skimped on the bread only having put a small slice of the same hearty bread provided at the table (which they continually refill), and there wasn't a ton of cheese either. Regardless it was a delicious soup. For entrees me and my friend shared two of our top pics. The classic steak frites and the fish special of the day (striped bass fillet with fingerling potatoes and asparagus). The steak was supposed to be a New York Strip cooked medium rare. I found the steak to be disappointingly thin (especially as other Yelp photos of the dish showed a much thicker cut of meat). It was also cooked medium, almost medium well. The fries were average at best, no seasoning or features or flavors that made them stick out. The fish dish was very good. The fish portion was modest but it was cooked very well and had a night crispy skin on it. It was sitting in a buttery sauce which had great flavor but could have used a little more seasoning. Overall I was happy with the dish. As mentioned before the service was amazing and the restaurant overall was nice, the food I'd say is 3.5 stars but this place definitely deserves a solid 4 stars with all things considered."], ["Annette M.", "Love the garlic and parmesan fries!

When we mentioned the issue they seemed irritated with us for bringing it to our attention. Though maybe that was a cultural/language barrier? Dunno. The tartare was disgusting. My friend ordered bacon on her burger, it came without and yet was still on the ticket. Another friend is gluten free and they failed to put the croutons and dressing on the side like she asked. Another friend had her order taken only to find out 5 minutes later it couldn't be made. And the last of us (we were 5) had his order forgotten all together. In all fairness the did offer us tequila to make up for the terrible dinner, which was funny because none of us intended to drink. A couple shots did loosen us all up, which was their aim I'm sure. Still, wish my dinner reunion with old friends had been better served."], ["Melissa N.", "This place is great! I eat here about once a month late night with the bf after visiting Bottleneck Gallery.We usually get the mushroom and shrimp risotto (2 separate dishes) and they always let me add truffle oil to my shrimp risotto. There are both so deliciously made and even better on a cool fall or winter night. Live music plays until around closing sometimes and it a nice treat. It's a cozy and romantic place as well lit with candles.The waiter that we've had was great and we would definitely recommended and come back. We never get a chance to taste the drinks because we are usually driving home, but I'd like to change that some time :)"], ["John W.", "Solid food, but the real treat is the backyard garden in the summer.

But Santos Anne is a laid-back neighborhood joint, not a gastronomic destination. The food is (relatively) inexpensive and plentiful, there's a great happy hour, and everyone seems to be enjoying themselves. Not a destination to travel far for, but if you live nearby you have to try it -- a few times at least."], ["Oliver B.", "Love this little place. They always use fresh fruit for the margaritas and they're only $5 during happy hour. The hangar steak is excellent and the fries were great too! I'm excited to come back and try the burger next time."], ["Aurelie S.", "The food here is on the better side of average, but there is one dish that is absolutely, utterly, unbelievably exquisite: the kale salad with seafood. Ask for the hot pepper powder (it comes in a vial with a skull and cross bones, not all waiters will know what you're talking about but the bussers might). The decor is charming!! But not in that irritating campy previous kind of way. It's genuinely charming. And reasonable prices too. And presentation is great. Go!"], ["Holly T.", "The BF and I wanted to celebrate our anniversary with a nice dinner, but being the couch potatoes that we are, decided to order in instead. Found this sweet little spot on good ol' Seamless. The calamari rings are a little small, and significantly blander than versions I've tasted in other restaurants. Otherwise, based on my take-out experience, I'm tres impressed. Love the fusion of Mexican and French cuisines. The Mexican steak tartare, shrimp risotto, and duck breast magret loco are all must-try items. Everything tasted very flavorful and fresh. I'm sure our food would have been even better straight from the kitchen. Really looking forward to trying their brunch menu."], ["Molly G.", "Great neighborhood spot. They have a backdoor patio and a small band playing on the weekends. Great food, drinks and service. Love this place."], ["Jimmy H.", "Cool spot"], ["Marina S.", "I debated whether to post this in Craiglist's \"Missed Connections\" or Yelp. Yelp won.I am guessing you are looking at your smartphone, standing on a street corner in Brooklyn searching for something that's open and serves good food. You probably don't have time to read the anecdotal musings of a girl who has fallen in love. I understand. If you want a straight-to-the-point review of Santos Anne, scroll to the bottom of this absurdly long post. If you want a story of passion, hope, love and loss -- keep reading.In order to understand the importance of this night, you must first know that I live in Taiwan. Taiwan is the land where eligible bachelors are not only few and far between, but they also are NOT interested in awkward Jewish girls who drink a lot and talk too much. I moved to Taipei from New York for a job and had the opportunity to visit Brooklyn a year later. My friend and I decided to treat ourselves to a nice dinner after some comedy at the Knitting Factory (I highly recommend you go to their free shows on Sunday nights).We saw that Santos Anne was open until 12am and decided to power walk over at around 11:50pm. Last minute customers are a servers worst nightmare, but the staff welcomed us with open arms. As soon as we sat down I saw him. He was sitting in the corner with a plate of cheese and a glass of wine (or was it beer?). I don't think I have ever seen a man so beautiful in my life.You can imagine my shock when he got up and walked right over to us. Turns out, he was our waiter and he was French. The accent! I die.* I stammered through my order and accepted wine from the bartender who insisted we drink. Team, listen: A man hasn't so much as looked my way in a year. That is precisely why I acted like a giddy 12-year-old girl who just spotted Justin Bieber every time this guy came to our table. I scarfed down my duck tacos, which tasted like love and possibilities, and proceeded to imagine all the things I'd do to the waiter (you know, things like stare at him in his sleep, buy cupcakes and pretend I made them, hide the fact that I am a crazy lady until we were married) if I lived in the States. At the end of the night, the drunk bartender poured more wine for me and said, in a very difficult-to-decipher slur, that a man was going to fall in love with me really soon.Now I don't know if the waiter and bartender set up some sort of ponzi scheme where insecure women who have intimacy issues believe they can sustain a successful relationship with one of the wait staff, but I asked for a job application after dinner. When he came back with the bill (sans application) I saw we were only charged for our tacos. FREE DRINKS! As we were getting up to go, my waiter/boyfriend looked me in the eyes and said, \"We go make out now, no?\" He felt it too! I smiled coyly. Could I kiss this man I hardly knew on my last night in Brooklyn? He was so beautiful. His eyes were the ocean! His skin, the sand! Despite his beauty, I knew what my answer was. \"No, not tonight.\" When I said it out loud, my heart attempted to punch my brain in the face. Alas, I am a woman of class. I cannot make out with a man unless he's bought me flowers or at least six shots of whiskey. I left Santos Anne with nothing more than a kiss on the cheek.I am back in Taiwan now, but my heart just isn't in it anymore.If you are reading for a review on the food, atmosphere and all that other crap Yelp is useful for, then here you go:Food = Excellent. Order the tacos you can't really go wrong. Atmosphere = Adorable, friendly, cool.Other Crap = Great. This is a good restaurant. That's it.*Just to let you know, I am an intelligent girl that is not easily fooled by a pretty boy with an accent but you try living in Taiwan for a year and not getting so much as a Herro!P.S. Stay away from my boyfriend."], ["Danni L.", "This review is overdue, but I just want to say that I had a great experience here with my boyfriend and I would like to come back again. The food here is very delicious. I didn't give a five star because the service is a bit depending on the person who serves you. There were two waiters while we were there, the first waiter who ordered for us gave us drinks, and never came back to order us food (for like 30 min), even though we told him we are here for dinner! Finally we had to find someone else to serve us so that we can actually eat something, and the second waiter who served us was AMAZING! Not only did he recommend the best dish on the menu, but also gave us free round of shots since I liked them on facebook. The shots taste very good, it was not a simple shot but a recipe in which tequila is mixed with other things, yum! I was really surprised because usually I have low expectations for shots, even mixed ones due to many past experiences. I didn't finish the shot in one time because I wanted to save it for the entree. Seeing my unfinished drink, he came over and asked if I didn't like it. After I explained, he said he will give us another round of free shots if I finish it, so I don't need to save this one! Obviously I did and he delivered another round as promised. We finished our dinner in happiness and satisfaction.Btw, their bathrooms are very funny. The sex of the image on the men and women's doors are not easily identified, so people go in the wrong one all the time."], ["Paul A.", "The salmon tacos were absolutely disgusting."], ["Jared F.", "The most amazing salmon burger and salmon Eggs Benedict I've ever had.

I guess I will just have to come back soon and try again."], ["Michelle S.", "4 for the food, 2 for the service.I came here on the early side of brunch, and the restaurant was half full. By the time we were trying in vain to grab our check, it was almost completely packed. This place suffers from some serious logistics issues.Environment is great! The outdoor patio is such a city oasis. I absolutely love the atmosphere.Our waiter was nice enough, albeit a bit on the slow side. He spent about 5 minutes introducing himself and the menu with his personal recommendations, which is TOTALLY fine with a nearly empty restaurant and when you have your tables under control, but when you're pressed for time, you might want to speed up the speech. It took us 10 minutes to get our food and drink orders in and then our waiter went ghost on us. In fact, I didn't see him again after he brought our drinks because the bus boys ran the show after that. However, they didn't speak a lick of English, so when I asked for a side of home fries (that were delicious, by the way from the sample I took from my friend's plate - hence the need for a side order), he said \"one second\" as if to grab someone and never came back. So, I didn't get my home fries, and after we got our check, no one would come to pick it up. I was running tight on making a train home, so after another 15, 20 minutes, I had to pull a power move and go to the bar and cash myself out.I'll admit it. I am probably going to return. My brother ordered the Steak and Eggs and I ordered the Mexican Breakfast. Wow! Amazing. I think I had plate envy because my brother's Steak and Eggs was so flavorful! Overall, the Mexican inspired brunch was phenomenal and their picante sauce was some of the best I've ever had. I just hope next time, I can upgrade my review after service that matches the quality of the food.PS. Hot restaurant owner alert."], ["Patrick C.", "I encountered the most spectacularly offensive service at Santos Anne that I can remember of any restaurant experience. I came here for dinner with a group of friends for a late dinner after a performance in the neighborhood. And I get that it was late, and we were closing the place out, and that our waiter probably was at the end of a long day and eager to get home. I understand. But such circumstances notwithstanding, I still expect some measure of civility. Instead, our waiter acted out, treating us to shockingly heinous attitude. I would rather have just been told upon arrival that the kitchen was closed than been subjected to the treatment that was in store for us.First, there was a simple mathematical mistake in dividing up our check. (We didn't realize that tip had been included.) Instead of coming back to our table and politely clarifying, our waiter came back and straight-up berated us, talking to us like we were stupid. The level of disrespect was breathtaking.One of my friends then asked if she could have her food boxed up to take home. Our waiter snatched the plate off the table with an aggressive sigh, like a teenager being asked by his mom to take out the trash.And when he came back with our bill and credit cards, he literally threw them onto the table in front of us and said, \"Whatever, just do what you want to do.\"I plan to take that advice and, in the future, do what I want to do, which is to take my patronage elsewhere. Life's too short to be treated like garbage.P.S. Here's where I might otherwise say that, while the service was atrocious, I have to admit that we really enjoyed the food... - but to be honest, the food was nothing special, and, given its mediocrity, the price was almost as offensive as our waiter."], ["Elizabeth P.", "This was a great spot for our group out celebrating my friend's birthday. The margaritas were amazing (especially the ginger one!) and our server was super attentive. He kept the free chips and salsa flowing and was super friendly throughout the night.

No problem, we got our drink on at a neighboring bar and awaited their call when our table was ready. I'm still swooning over the \u00a0grown and sexy vibe.

I tore that bitch to pieces! - I couldn't tell you what the meat lovers ate, but they ripped their meals to shreds in record time, so there's that. Service was fast and very attentive. The manager did well to check in on us ever so often. One minor, almost major blip was the entree mix up. I was accidentally given a very meaty taco. Said \u00a0meat was hidden under a bed of veggies which I discovered while poking around before getting my grub on. I told the waiter and he quickly rectified the problem.

We usually end up outside the neighborhood, but after dinner here last week, I am recommending Petit Oven to my friends in Park Slope! The food,wine and service were excellent. Three of us ordered a different entr\u00e9e from the prix fixe menu so that we could each have a taste. The mussels appetizer was perfectly prepared with basil and jalape\u00f1o. I really enjoyed my entr\u00e9e of homemade orrechiete with pork ragu, as well as sampling the cod and chicken entr\u00e9es. I have seen the chef at our local farmers' market and the fresh ingredients are apparent in her cuisine and the seasonal menu.

I do not think it would, in Manhattan.Don't get me wrong, I love Brooklyn and I made a long trip to this spot to try out this restaurant.

The burger and salmon were both good portions and well executed medium as requested, which we were very happy about. However they were noticeably under-salted and not very flavorful. The salmon was also overly charred on the bottom.Maybe the rating is a bit inflated because it happens to be a good and relatively affordable restaurant with a welcoming and cozy interior - love the fireplace and option to dine al fresco - in the neighborhood. For sure if I lived nearby I would consider it a good option. But as I do not live in the area, I feel no desire to return.

I'll get my major complaint out of the way first, as I loved everything else about La Cigogne but our experience was messed up by a horrendous lack of understanding by the waiter.We ordered four appetizers and two entrees to split among four people. Simple enough, right? Forty minutes pass and no food. This is OK with me, as I prefer to wait longer and receive good food than to receive crap food fast. However, ALL of our food shortly comes out. Appetizers, some cold , come out at the same time as *steak and salmon*. So now, we have to either rush or eat cold steak and salmon. What was worse was that three waiters brought our food out; THREE \u00a0of La Cigogne's waiters didn't know the essential \u00a0concept of appetizer before entr\u00e9e. \u00a0I mean, there was a salad that was put on our table at the same time as a steak. Guys. GUYS. Besides not bringing steak knives and not knowing the non-alcoholic drink menu, that was the biggest mess up our waiter made. For a Friday night, you'd expect top notch service. This really took me out of it. While the rest of my party liked the food , they found this also to be incredibly annoying. On the positive side, the host was very friendly and pleasant; this spot just needs someone to oversee the front of the house more as some of the waitstaff appear to be deliriously clueless as to what's what \u00a0This is coming from a former waiter. PS the bread for the table was absolutely stale but that's forgivable. Notes for some items we ordered: Tartes flambes - La Chevre tart was incredible. The honey taste wasn't overpowering and wasn't too vague. The kitchen knows how to make flatbread. Tuna tartar - I enjoyed this more than the rest of my party, I felt it was a hearty , chunky tartar and could not have asked for more.Steak frites - Excellent cut , very tender but would have been better IF IT WAS HOT. \u00a0Steaks tend to be a bit \u00a0better when you're not fighting against time to eat them before they get cold.As far as other items there was the scallop appetizer, which was soft and flavorful, and the almond crusted salmon entr\u00e9e, which exceeded my expectations. But again, it was fairly cold by the time we got to it.I would go back \u00a0to La Cigogne tonight if I could despite the f-up mentioned . In fact, my wife wants to go back already and I dont blame her; it's a restaurant worth returning to. \u00a0The kitchen has tremendous capacity for excellence, the interior is pleasantly stylish . I just wish there was some sort of supervision (or the most seriously basic waiter training that you can think of) in the front of the house to prevent silly mistakes from happening."], ["F. A.", "Where here for the b'day dinner of my mum. Came super late, but they kept the reservation and served us very well. The food was extraordinary.

I was warmly welcomed by Jeremy (one of the owners) who then walked me to the bar, he asked what type of libation I was interested in, I told him I enjoy pale ales with a bit above the average alcohol content. He recommended \"Wendelinus\" on draft, it was delicious. The bartender was also very sweet and attentive, I told Jeremy I checked the reviews on Yelp and was impressed with the 5 Star rating, he immediately said \"in my culture, people shouldn't be treated less than 5 stars, service should always be the best.\" I couldn't agree with him more. I wasn't very hungry but it was my first time at an Alsatian restaurant so I decided to try some appetizers. I ordered the Scallops and the Camembert frit. I'm always hesitant to order Scallops in fear of disappointment but these were perfectly browed in Caper sauce, I love Capers, and the Camembert (oven baked) was delicious too. Music is important to me, at all times, exceptionally when a drink is keeping me company, they played a mix of lounge and sensual tunes that completed the vibe, so good I forgot I was a party of one. I returned the very following Friday night. This time I came with a close friend, we sat at the bar again. I had Kwak, one of the best Belgian beers I've ever had. To start, we ordered Moules marini\u00e8res (Mussels), they arrived covered in two bowls, when my friend opened the bowl, he immediately said \"there is a God!\" referring to the generous portion. \u00a0For dinner we ordered the Gambrinus (meteor beer marinated beef stew in egg noodles) and Steak Frites to share, everything was exquisite. In conclusion, as other Yelper's mentioned, there are many reasons to dine at La Cigogne, whether you want to just enjoy a good drink by yourself, bring a date (a special one), enjoy a good time with your entire family or group of friends, this restaurant and the level of hospitality from the staff and owners cater to all of the above. Two thumbs up La Cigogne, these 5 stars are very well deserved!"], ["Timothy R.", "New Alsatian French restaurant that's opened in a long-empty storefront on Union and Henry.

Beer should always be served in goblets! \u00a0Later during the meal, I followed that with a stronger ale, a Delirium Tremens, delivered, again, in a uniquely branded glass, this time more of a snifter, and accompanied by the remainder of my beer portion still in the very pretty bottle. \u00a0 All great all fun.Even the bread and butter were outstanding! \u00a0Rich creamy, lightly salted butter on chewy baguette slices. \u00a0Perfect.For dinner, Kim had the beef stew with spaetzle, which was tasty, almost home cooked in its melange of warm flavors and simplicity, but I found it a bit dry. \u00a0It needed a splash of beef broth, I thought. \u00a0That's probably not spaetzle anymore, I'm sure someone will say, but there it is. \u00a0It was very well prepared, just not my cup of stew, if you will.I had one of their signature tartes flambes, which are basically similar to thin crust square pizzas, sans red sauce, with creme fraiche and simple toppings, like munster cheese, onions, and of course, in my case, bacon! \u00a0Completely delicious! \u00a0Kim ate half of mine! \u00a0 \u00a0I also liked that it was served on a cutout of French newspaper placed over a cutting board. \u00a0A nice touch without seeming artificial.It's just a fun, friendly, unpretentious place with an authentic European feel to it, that serves great food and drink in a warm and inviting room. \u00a0We thoroughly enjoyed the meal, the service, the congenial room and left feeling completely satisfied and relaxed. \u00a0I am sure to visit this lovely establishment again."], ["Jessie Z.", "Great time.

It seems like there is one, big, central kitchen making food for all the restaurants, and the only way to tell them apart is from the signs out front. Sure, we could make the walk over to the bedbug-infested subway, crowd in with everybody and head into Manhattan, searching -- possibly in vain -- for a pleasant, inexpensive, and hassle-free meal. Of course, if we do find this magical place, once we finish eating, we will have to turn around and make the late-night return trip home...If the trains are running!I'd like to suggest an option that may seem like more of a vacation than a nuissance.Have you heard of La Cigogne, the new Alsatian restaurant -- the only restaurant of its kind in Brooklyn -- that just opened... In our neighborhood!I'm telling you, my girlfriend and I were strolling by La Cigogne last week and the atmosphere inside was calling to us...and we had just eaten.In fact, when we walked by on a Sunday during this year's World Cup, the restaurant was full and they had not even been awarded their liquor license yet. Can you believe it? When is the last time that you saw soccer fans watching a match without alcohol? Alot of the exitement about La Cigogne has to do with the owners, Jeremy and Damien. They've brought everything that they love from Alsace and combined it with everything that they love about America. They treat you like you are a close friend and not -- like some restaurants in our neighborhood that will go unnamed -- like they are doing you a favor.And while La Cigogne's atmosphere transports you from the hustle and bustle of New York to the laid back, seize-the-day vibe of the French-Swiss-German border, it is the food that makes you want to come back again and again. Gone are the generic pastas, salads, and cookie-cutter pizzas. La Gigogne offers a unique blend of Alsatian fair. What does that mean? Well, it means that you are getting the best blend of three distinct, yet complementary, culinary traditions that makes Alsatian cuisine renowned all over the world.Nestled on France's eastern border with Switzerald and Germany, Alsace is famous for being one of the most highly concentrated Michelin Star regions in the world.This means that you can get a Mac n' Cheese appetizer made with rich, smooth, melted, delicious cheese -- not made with ingredients that sound like they are straight from a laboratory. You can get a burger that reminds you that hamburgers can be delicacies, not limp, soggy-breaded, overcooked cast-offs.Looking to venture deep into Alsatian territory? La Cigogne's sp\u00e4tzles will make you wonder why you have waited this long for food this good. My personal favorite is the Steak Frite entree, which is so authentic that it should come with a beret -- although, I'm sure that you could get it with a baguette if you asked nicely.To complete the illusion of vacation bliss, you can enjoy a wide array of Alsatian wines and beers...beers that you'd be hard-pressed to find anywhere else in the city...beers so tasty that you'll wonder why they've been hidden from you for all this time.Listen, typing this review has made my mouth begin to salivate. So, head on out to La Cigogne. You'll thank me later. \u00c0 votre sante!-Kris"], ["Snooki F.", "This place is clown shows delicious. The beer list is quality and the food is even better.

Just this past Sunday, I was shocked to experience one of the best bloody marys I've had in a long time - and trust me, I am no stranger to a bloody mary (in fact I am drinking one at home right now). The only downside was the lack of olives or pickle for a garnish...but that was forgiven and forgotten rather quickly thanks to the deliciousness in my glasses which were emptied rather quickly.While I am definitely more of a hard liquor kind of gal, I've branched out with their wine selection. Actually, now that I think about it, I've tried and loved a lot of new things here. The same Bloody Mary Sunday I just wrote about, my friend and I tried one of their tartes flambees with cherry tomatoes, black olives and arugula. It was a great combination of fresh, warm, tasty and filling without making you feel like you're going to need to be rolled out of the place.Later, we were treated to the day's special dessert, a s'mores flambee. Don't think any less of me but I'm really not a dessert person. I prefer to get my calories in the form of salty carbs or alcohol. This though...not only was it not overly sweet, the roasted marshmallow brought me back to my childhood. It was great and will go really well with their fireplace this winter.Everyone who works there is not only attentive, but also very sweet and it's not only been nice to get to know them, but it's also been great to watch them interact with other customers every time I've been there."], ["Andrea D.", "I feel very fortunate to have found this unique French restaurant.

But this new restaurant, La Cigogne, celebrating authentic Alsace cuisine, certainly deserves it. Five stars mean that the ambience, the menu, the service, and the food were all excellent. This restaurant was an accidental find. I didn't read any of the below reviews before I went, but I can attest to the fact that they are all correct. The ambience is quaint. It feels like an old cafe from France. The menu and the wait staff are authentic... Imagine French staff (we will not argue over the legitimacy of calling Alsace French) actually working in a French restaurant. The service was solicitous without being overbearing. And if for nothing else, they get an extra star for knowing that no one wants to be seated next to a spoiled misbehaving child with inept parents who can't control her and moving them to the back of the restaurant without incident.

The BF had a cream filled donut with visible vanilla bean inside, and my almond AND chocolate croissant was the best of both worlds, crunchy, sweet, and chewy!! The iced coffee had some real roasted flavor and the iced chai was nice and creamy. Unfortunately, the barista was a little inexperienced about how much ice to use to make a drink.... That's why there are lines on the cups, honey, I used to work at Starbucks they teach you the insider secrets. So there was a bit too much ice and a bit too little liquid. But it won't keep me away.

Georges-Andre is indeed a child friendly cafe which is fine but, at times, can be annoying simply because it's such a small place to begin with. Maybe in a larger setting the children screaming & playing wouldn't be quite as distracting and overwhelming. That being said, when Georges-Andre is quiet, it's a lovely coffee shop. Frankly, I'm happy to blame any qualm I have with the cafe on the size of the space itself. On days when it's busy, I take my coffee to go.The coffee is good! My boyfriend swears that their cappuccino is the best. It's a little on the pricier end and is cash-only (ATM with fee inside though). However, I find myself wishing they had medium size for their coffees because the larger is enormous and the small is very small and comes in an awful tacky little stackable ikea mug (the small mugs are my only other issue with the cafe - which seems trivial but is really annoying when you are a frequent customer).Definitely worth stopping by if you are in the area.

OK, bad luck, not their fault. But a so called \"french\" restaurant, providing only 3 pastries for breakfast, including $2.5 croissant?

No fresh pies, no elaborated pastries, biscuits or even cookies or brownies...On the bright side, nice atmosphere, nice decoration, really vintage, even if a bit too small.

Nothing matched but everything looked great the way the owners threw them together. I wish I had such skills. A lot of vintage knick-knacks placed throughout. Super cool. I had my coffee and got comfortable. I almost did not want to leave. Great coffee, free wi-fi, and a comfortable surrounding.

There were other kids there that she was able to interact with. Both times I've been customer service has been wonderful. This place has not been around long but they already have regulars.

I ended up just getting a chocolate filled croissant like pastry topped with powdered sugar and almond slivers. It was very good. Light crisp but still moist and a semi sweet chocolate. They had some delicious looking brownies and Danishes as well.

What I do not like is the screaming children in the corner of the room and the parents allowing their children to bump into me, knock my coffee over etc. If the place was larger we could dedicate a nice little corner for the screaming little rascals... I love the old movies but I also find it to be kind of strange that 90% of the patrons are wearing headphones l. Now I see there is a reason for that. The music could also be lower... Also rather weird that the bathroom door has a window... I gave 2 stars because this is not the establishments fault for the child's unruly behavior. It is however their fault for the playpen in the corner. And I get it because the owner has a kid it seems... The owner was also very curt with me for me not understanding that the place is cash only and had to remark that, \"even if it wasn't cash only I would never charge $4.25 there would have to be a minimum\" Well... \u00a0I have owned a business for 6 years and I completely understand that...

The food itself is delicious and definitely high quality. The pastries are fresh everyday and the espresso and coffee is strong and flavorful. If I had one complaint, it would be the barista's not mixing the iced-coffee beverages.

There are few places I feel comfortable and not judged for bringing my \"friendly\" and very verbal toddler. I'll definitely bring my daughter here sometime!

The owner, SuperFrench is as much a part of the atmosphere as the quirky but tasteful decor. She is warm, outgoing and very funny. Her son (Andre, named after her father Georges Andre) is another frequent staple and he is adorable. Ask about her birthdays book.

We've been frequenting Georges-Andre (Georges being the owner's father's name, Andre is the little wobbly guy you'll meet if you go to the cafe) ever since it opened. I sometimes go there to do work during the day with my computer. Wireless is good and fast. Depending on the time of day, and your luck, it may be quiet, it may be packed with babies and neighbors. It is a baby-friendly place, so parent central. The pastries are from very good French bakeries, so always top notch. I like savory stuff, so the spicy chive scone and ham and cheese croissant are usually my faves. And of course delicious quiches. There is no blah tasting coffee here. They use Le Colombe beans, and do not shy away from strong espresso shots in the coffee. Iced coffee is made with two shots of espresso regularly, for example. Compared to the coffee served in all the other places in Bed-Stuy, Georges-Andre has the best coffee, in flavor and in strength. They have a great selection of teas and organic teas, as well.The owner is always very friendly. The baristas are also very friendly and efficient. The best thing about George-Andre is that the owner has a mission to contribute to the community. She will talk to people, introduce people to each other, and remember you. Once, I saw her return someone's wallet, which they had lost, and another store owner had returned to GA, because they knew the guy would come for his coffee. There it is, you're among family. Another time, someone who knew me from a previous job recognized me at the cafe, and the owner introduced us, because she knew we had worked in the same field. Other times, people just talk to each other, and start conversations, just like that. There is always some conversation going on about art, real estate, block association, parenting, schools, whatever... Of course, you can also put on your headphones and do your work, if you want to be left alone.There is a parent/baby meeting in the middle of the day one of the week days (I think now on Wednesdays, but check with the owner), and several block associations meet at GA, too.

We barely had two pieces because it had a meat taste of a sweaty cow and it was just tasteless. We even got up to ask for steak sauce and they did not have it. How am I supposed to eat a piece of dry and smelly meat? (They should really make sure that they are getting a good cut from their vendors or get a chef that knows how to prepare the meat)- Burger R: it came out more like M and It was terrible. The burger was all soft and smoochy. Definitely not something you would like in your mouth.At the time, there was a sweet girl working that was making the coffee, and serving the food. She approached a table because they needed something. Instantly the french guy (what appears to be the owner and our waiter) yells \"Don't take any orders!\"... And then they argue about how they did not had steak sauce for us.The way you communicate with the staff affects the experience of your customers. You don't want to run an establishment where you show customers how bad you treat your staff. (We saw the girl leaving the place at 11am right when it started getting busy and before world cup: maybe she went shopping or maybe...)We did not complain at the time because the guy (what appears to be the owner) was running the place by himself, and by the time we needed his attention, he wasn't around.

The owner, Olivier, has a constant presence in his restaurant, ensuring that everything is running smoothly, and is the first to address any issue you may have. The rest of the staff is also warm and competent, and the young blonde woman makes a great cocktail. The menu changes from time to time but there are some solid choices that remain consistent. Although not the most French item on the menu, the hamburger is always good and cooked to perfection, and the soups are well rounded in flavor and variety. If their fish soup is being offered it is a definite go- to. In addition, their French fries are crisp and delicious, and the fois gras is smooth and rich. I have been here many times with family and \u00a0friends, usually for dinner, and always have an enjoyable and relaxing evening- just what you would want from a charming neighborhood place!

The sauce from the dish leaked inside my bag on my way home.Little incidents but they all add up.

Our dinner (Hanger Steak and Swordfish), although I felt less than ideal temperature, were unlike any other. The goat cheese cheesecake was the perfect top off and the wines matched perfectly.My biggest gripe was the service. \u00a0I was highly dissatisfied with the fact we got one measly piece of bread to go with out Kunick (cheese). The table next to us actually dropped her bread all over the floor, and the wait staff rushed out to bring her another bowl. On top of that, our waitress forgot to serve us our duck fat fries. I do not believe they were attentive us very much in pouring water and asking how our meal was. And lastly, we had food to go, they gave us the folded up cardboard box (which is not leakproof BTW) with out a bag (we figured since they don't offer the bag, the container must be leakproof...I would fund out later that, that assumption was dead wrong). And of course, when the mrs stored the box in her bag, the juices leaked all over the place, leaving her belongings reeking of sword fish parts.In the end our bill came to 127, 150 with tax.

We came here on a Friday evening without a reservation. First of all they don't have high chairs and only offered a booster seat without seat straps to keep the child in place. This was surprisingly to me since brooklyn has become a stroller destination. The restaurant was about half empty but the food took extremely long to serve. At least 30 minutes for the appetizers. During our hungry long wait they didn't even bring us bread or something to nibble on given that they were probably swamped in the kitchen. Being that we were starving by the time appetizers arrived , any type of decent food would have tasted delicious. This was not the case! We ordered a chickpea & chorizo casserole. It just tasted like bowl of boiled chorizo with beans served inside a small stone pot. Tasted nothing like a casserole and very bland , no depth to the dish whatsoever. As a second app we also ordered a mushroom puff pastry. \u00a0The bread was extremely dry and the dish was so bad that I don't even have a recollection of it. Now for the main courses, we orders a pork chop - overcooked and tough on the outside, portion was small considering the price and in comparison to other neighboring American restaurants, no real side dish either to compliment. \u00a0Just a tiny salad drenched in vinegar on the side. The other dish we orders was the mushroom cavatelli - lacked salt and extremely oily. So oily that I felt like I ate just fried chicken. Desserts - pear upside down cake , not special, tasted similar to something of a carrot cake with less spice. Just okay - something you would find in a coffee shop, not a dish you would order at a restaurant, definitely for $10 dollars!Black out cake- again this is similar to a Devils food cake but with less pudding and sugar. Best dish out of the entire meal but again , not something I would think is outstanding esp for 10 dollars ! Portion size - everything was very small given the price. Even for some restaurants in Manhattan it would be a bit of a rip off. An unassuming small slice a cake was $10, charging above average price for below average food. I would justify paying these prices for small portions if the food was good, however this experience was certainly not the exception to do so.Steer clear of this restaurant , so many better options out there!!"], ["Lans S.", "The signage out front might be deceiving.

The meat was cooked perfectly medium rare and deliciously seasoned, though a bit chewy. It was served atop a fabulous heap of saut\u00e9ed veggies. There was also a kale salad which was a generous plate of crisp chopped kale tossed w/ parm and anchovy dressing. Refreshing, though my companion found the fish overpowering after several bites.

They have a great brunch menu and I've never waited for longer than approx 20 mins for a table. Full discretion: I've only come here with my boyfriend so we always only wait for a table for 2, which is infinitely easier to seat than a larger party. 2. If you like to have a ginormous brunch (no judgment here!) go for the Croque Madame. It's huge, has carbs, ham (a step away from bacon!) and you can even choose to get your starches in there if you opt for the fries on the side. The fries here, if you've never had, you MUST. They're airy, crispy, and not overwhelming. I usually can't eat a whole side serving of fries, but I finish everything on my plate whenever I'm in the mood to just dig into a huge whooping meal. If you're looking for something lighter, I'd recommend the benedict, which is your typical fare, nothing extremely great, but their salad is also fresh, crispy and delicious, highly recommend!!

Sorry, not enough 'tiny' in the world to describe how hungry I still was after the meal. There was definitely more bone than meat.

The \"hand cut fries\" that came with it represented something of a grass-like mound of sloppy potato slivers that had possibly previously been served as garnish on a meal back in the eighties. A true disgrace and an insult to the Belgians, who would happily receive this ultimate proof of their dominance in the realm of pommes frites... If I'd had to speak on behalf of apologetic optimism, maybe the delivery person had come in through a monsoon, that would explain some 50% of this mishap?2) The \"sauteed greens\" are, well, a bunch of green leaves soaking in oil and too many flakes... I cannot even find the words to adequately describe this greasy garlic-overdose of a tangy mess. Charging $5 for 4 bites of a chard-like substitute in such form as a side dish is nothing short of a sin!3) By the time I came to consider the $9 flowerless chocolate cake, I had already chosen to write this review as a more soothing dessert option, and so it came that too was tossed in the garbage together with the majority of 1) and 2). It did come with a separately \"packed\" scoop of vanilla ice cream (I'm guessing, re: tossed, but it was a cold white substance) which seems a nice touch. Not enough for a half star or more to balance a less unfavorable review though.As a final thought; it took two telephone inquiries as to when the food would finally arrive, well over an hour into the order, so that may explain part of the negative review...Perhaps the regular crowd, the ambiance, and the option of sending the food back to the kitchen immediately are what make the attraction here, but otherwise there are far better take-out alternatives in the neighborhood!"], ["Daniel L.", "Came around 4:45 which was their late brunch. \u00a0So they serve smaller menu list. \u00a0I had the grilled burger in medium with fries. \u00a0They said they only have house fries which came out to be square potato fries.

It takes a lot for me to come to Brooklyn, so I was mentally prepared for the worst - despite the glowing Yelp reviews for the restaurant.First of all, it was shockingly easy to find parking on Grand Street ... though that may have had more to do with the blizzard outside than anything else. But we found a metered spot right in front of the restaurant, so I can't really complain.We were ushered into the back room, where our small ceremony space was all set up & ready to go. The room was ours for the evening, with one caveat: the only bathroom in the restaurant was in the back of the \"private\" room. So, for having a reserved room for a private event, it was very inconvenient to have guests walking through our group & opening the swinging door to get to the bathroom every few minutes.When my cousins were reserving the room, we were asked to give our menu choices a week or two in advance, so they would have enough time to prepare the meals and have them available after the short ceremony. Yet, strangely enough, they didn't begin to prepare the food until AFTER the ceremony was over. The waiters came in and asked, \"So we should start the food now?\" Umm, shouldn't you have started it an hour ago when we all arrived? So, we waited in our seats for an hour while the kitchen began to cook our meals.The food - when it did eventually come - was amazing. And I guess this would be where the glowing reviews are coming from. I ordered the Le Barricou Salad, the Skate Meuniere, and the Apple Tart for dessert. Someone at our table ordered the Brussels Sprouts as a side dish, so we all tried that as well. The salad was a very generous portion - probably enough for a meal in itself if I wasn't already so hungry! I loved the fresh green beans & the bacon. Even the croutons were exceptional. I ended up sharing my salad with my cousin, because I knew I had two more dishes coming.The Skate Meuniere was outstanding. It was light & buttery, with more fresh green beans & capers, and the white wine & lemon sauce was unbelievable. The fish filet itself was bigger than I thought it would be, but it was so delicious that it disappeared in an embarrassingly short amount of time. And the Brussels Sprouts were exactly how I like them - roasted & slightly crunchy. Really tasty.The Apple Tart was perfect. I think it was more ... constructed? ... than I thought it would be. It arrived as a little masterpiece: a flaky tart shell filled with tiny sweet cubes of apple, drizzled with a light caramel sauce. It was warm & sweet, and the ice cream was a perfect addition. Like an organized, yummy apple pie.All in all, I have mixed emotions about our experience. I really enjoyed the meal we had at Le Barricou, but I wasn't too pleased with the service or the organization/coordination of our \"private\" event. The food is fantastic, and I'd consider coming again for the meal alone, but I would probably look elsewhere if I was planning something bigger. \u00c0 la prochaine, Le Barricou ..."], ["Vanessa C.", "Wanted to try this place out and I was glad I did.

We heard it was a great date spot and were able to make a reservation same day. Upon arrival we were greeted cheerfully by the hostess, who gestured us to our cozy seats facing out the large windows towards the street. Such a cool intimate vibe in here - maybe 10-12 seats total and almost all of the restaurant has a view of the kitchen. We started with the truffle Mac and cheese and baby lettuce salad. For being such a trendy, ubiquitous dish, the truffle Mac and cheese was head and shoulder above others I've had recently. Smaller penne noodles - perfectly creamy cheese, plenty of truffle flavor without being overpowering and a light bread crumb dusting broiled perfectly. Definitely get this. The baby lettuce salad was a great way to get our greens and don't get me wrong it tasted fantastic, but I wouldn't go back solely for that. It's a good option to balance out some of the heavier flavors.This is an incredible French-Korean fusion restaurant where the best entree combines each nation's signature dish - Kimchi Bouillabaisse - amazing! This was served piping hot, full of fresh seafood (shrimp, scallops, mussels, fried tofu, pollack) and housemade kimchi. The beef bourguignon was also incredible - the braised grass fed short rib literally fell off the bone, and the crushed potato doused in the short rib jus was unreal. We also met the friendliest people next to us - they were regulars and enlightened us to the \"not-miss\" items on the menu. Definitely a cool, chill crowd here. Also - they're BYOB so bring your favorite bottle or two."], ["Nicole L.", "Bistro Petit has been on my radar for the last year, and my partner and I finally agreed to go there for my 30th (gasp!) birthday because I was looking for a very low-key, relaxed celebratory dinner. Thankfully, the restaurant was atypically empty and we were able to score seats right at the kitchen side.For appetizers, we settled on the heirloom beet salad and the grilled artichokes. The artichokes were lemony and wonderfully grilled, and the beet salad came with these delicious breaded goat cheese croutons which were a great compliment to the tangy beets.The Korean beef bourguignon was simply to die for. The short ribs were so tender that they were falling off the bone, and I loved the flavour of the beef. The potato mash was also smoky and garlicky, and the grated horseradish over everything was a splendid touch. I also tried my bf's kimchi bouillabaisse and it was plenty spicy with a nice kick at the end.While my boyfriend loved the dessert special, a molten chocolate pot, I opted for the Coffee and Doughnuts, which were freshly made cinnamon beignets served with espresso gelato. Who needs birthday cake when I had those steamy beignets? Wow.There was a brief period where we awkwardly overheard Chef Park berating one of his kitchen staff, but for the rest of the evening they were all in good humour and spirits. It's clear that Chef Park has high standards, and this definitely translates into his food.

At this point everything was happening so fast and we were so confused.. we actually moved over to the other seat, which was so cramped we could barely fit in and sit comfortably. At that point we obviously got up and left. The waitress then goes \"Well wait, if we get a cancellation in 20 minutes.. want us to call you?\" .......No.I really tried to give this place another chance, but they disappointed yet again.

My sister and I got the Beef Bourguignon and the Seafood Bouillabaisse - as they were the most recommended dishes on yelp. The beef bourguignon was delicious. The meat was fall off the bone tender (but then again, it's hard to mess up short ribs), and the traditional soy/garlic/ginger flavor was certainly there. However, only things that were non-Korean about this dish, in my opinion, were the mashed potatoes and the thinly sliced green apple, which I didn't really see the connection. But in the end, it was overall a delicious dish.The seafood bouillabaisse was great as well. But then again, it was hard to tell significant difference between a milder kimchi stew to this bouillabaisse. Of course the chef probably used various French techniques during the process, but I began to get the feel that they were pushing this \"it's not just Korean\" thing too far when the waitress described the rice cake in the bouillabaisse as \"rice gnocchi\".

Don't expect a full service regular restaurant-- this is like dining in a special little house."], ["Joe D.", "We decided to give Bistro Petit a go, and were slightly turned off by its very quaint dining room (the name should have given us a clue, but we didn't think it would be so literal.) \u00a0My girlfriend and I had brought an excellent bottle of wine and sat up at the counter looking into the kitchen.The experience was absolutely stellar. \u00a0Great interaction, good service, and MAN... the food was to die for. \u00a0As a self proclaimed foodie, and one who is not afraid of trying ethnic and new cuisines, I have never eaten anything that so masterfully fused Korean inspired food into French cuisine, elevating the food to a creative new level. \u00a0An unlikely fusion, it was like nothing I ever had before.We had the tempura battered and fried sardines, which were excellent. \u00a0The starchy texture, saltiness of the sardines, and lemon blended perfectly. \u00a0The watermelon salad (seasonal) was so refreshing and tasty, perfectly balancing sweet and crisp flavors with Korean spices. \u00a0The kimchi bouillabaisse was so rich and tender, and I literally would have killed someone if they tried to take the dish away from me before all of the broth was consumed with toasted bread. \u00a0The Korean Beef Bourguignon was everything that I knew about the dish, but elevated to another level. \u00a0The spiciness of the korean ingredients cut through the fat to create a perfectly balanced and harmonious dish, complete with things to be expected: meat falling off the bone.I would HIGHLY recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes good food and likes to experiment. \u00a0The Chef is a master."], ["Justin L.", "CashOnly,No restroom,BYOB,Good small dishes (mac and cheese!) and few seats."], ["Nasim K.", "My bf never gives 5s, and he was leaning towards 5 on this one so you know it's good.I really liked the kimchi bouillabaise. Something between traditional bouillabase and kimchi jigae :-)Love love love the wild mushrooms and the foie gras w toast and grapesThe doughnuts are light but doughy too. Delicious.Very tiny place, nice for a date. Don't go in a group more than 4. People said in their reviews there are 10 seats, but that's the whole place and it's all counter set ups.Servers and chef are friendly. Open kitchen so you can see and sometimes talk to the chef. BYOB and they deliver too!"], ["Ella T.", "5 stars for food!Restaurant is really really small, only a few counter seats! BYOB!Chef and staff very nice and accommodating. 3 Michelin Star chef at really affordable prices!Ordered the Beef Bourguinion. \u00a0Meat melted in my mouth, delicious carmelized carrots.And I loved the thinly sliced apple strips with horseradish....it was a garnish, but wow amazing and unexpectedly delicious.Will be back!"], ["PP F.", "Overall, a spectacular experience! Tight fit but enjoyed being able to peer into the open kitchen. Chef Park is very friendly, and it was entertaining to watch him command his staff in the kitchen. It's cash only here but on the up side it is BYOB.To begin this lovely meal, I had the watermelon salad. Beautiful, symmetrical presentation of watermelon cubes that makes for a cool, refreshing start. There are even miniature cubes of pickled watermelon rind that add a little crunch and sour flavor to complement the sweetness of the watermelon.Of course I had to try the signature dish, kimchi bouillabaisse. This is so much better than any K-town soondubu jigae. Enjoyed the savory broth with a good amount of fresh seafood (mainly mussels). The kimchi was not overpowering, and I think there was turnip even though it's not listed as an ingredient on the menu. Also had one of the specials, the beef bourguignon, braised short rib with carrots, shitake mushrooms, onions, and granny smith apples. This is the kind of beef you dream about, meat so tender you don't even need a knife to cut it. It was served with a crushed baked potato topped with scallions. Ended with the cinnamon french donuts. Comes in a set of 5. They were crispy on the outside, dusted with the perfect amount of cinnamon, and pure soft doughiness on the inside. Out of everything, the beef bourguignon was my favorite! Would love to see this as part of the permanent menu."], ["Guillaume T.", "Deserved a good four stars,. Great place, great people. The food is well executed and a plaisir to eat. Thank you"], ["Laurie F.", "Shockingly good. When the recent trend in South Williamsburg is new pricey restaurants with attitude, Bistro Petit is friendly, welcoming and delivers an incredible foodie experience. Yes, they take reservations, yes....stop at a wine shop and bring a bottle, and some water and any other beverages with you (they are not in love with the flavor of the tap water, and don't serve it). There is NO corkage fee. We had the strip steak (that comes with perfect roasted potatoes, bone marrow, and fresh roasted garlic). Tasty, hot, perfectly cooked...better than any steak house in Brooklyn. Husband had the Kimchi Bouillabaisse which is the perfect french fish stew, with a little spice of the kimchi. Was wonderful, too. Both starter courses, were cold, fresh and perfect. \u00a0We live in the neighborhood. Will be back soon."], ["Sadie K.", "Wow! The food here is absolutely delicious. Its eat till you pop good! I had the watermelon salad, the truffle Mac and cheese and the kimchi bouillabaisse and everything was divine! The kimchi stew was by far my favorite! And no matter how full you are, you must try the donuts! After the 1st bite, I said \"oh my god\" 3x! It is so moist and soft, you want to savor each bite! This is truly a gem in Williamsburg!"]]}
