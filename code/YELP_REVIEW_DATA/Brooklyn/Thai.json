Unfortunately they didnt honor it because I was not dining in... even though I had already checked in... so I lost it. The person at the cash register didn't have the kindest attitude. I thought it would have been a kind gesture to honor the check-in. I ended up purchasing the tea, and let me say, I have been hard pressed to find good Thai Iced Tea since I moved to NY. Outside of Kare Thai in Hell's Kitchen, the one's I've had have been subpar....but this TEA, was PERFECT. Heavenly. Well worth it. Creamy, sweet but not too sweet. The Tom Yum shrimp soup was also very very tasty. It wasnt overloaded with bell peppers and onions, the broth/rue was spicy and warm and flavor was spot on. I will definitely be back. Hopefully that rude cashier won't be there. :/"], ["Grace J.", "As a fake meat-loving vegetarian I was thrilled to discover their mock duck spicy noodles and had them delivered a few nights ago, along with a papaya salad. The noodles were excellent and the veggie duck hit the spot, but halfway through my meal I realized there were several small shreds of actual chicken nestled in between the folds of delicious noodle. Very uncool, but sadly what I've come to expect from Thai restaurants whose mainstays are chicken pad Thai (this has happened to me before at other places in the neighbourhood) and who evidently don't prepare their vegetarian dishes in separate cookware. The papaya salad was simple and satisfied my craving for crunchy veggies in a sour peanutty dressing.

The host was very friendly and efficient and I guess because we were seated right across from her station she came to take our orders right away. I must tell you that I have never seen food orders come out that quickly; the shrimp roll appetizer was out about five minutes after I ordered, mind you they are pretty small but still that was super fast and our entrees were out as soon as we got done with those tiny rolls. The app was good but nothing that special. I ordered the green \u00a0curry, as usual and my bf ordered the spicy friend rice with shrimp. With my yelp check in I got a free Thai tea and my bf ordered the Brooklyn iced tea. I wasn't impressed with my green curry at all, it wasn't bad but for Thai food it was very bland and the vegetables were a bit too hard for my liking; maybe they should have spent more time cooking it. I really loved my Thai tea and especially since it was free; my bf liked his spicy fried rice but not his Brooklyn iced tea so much; he suggested they go back to long island. All in all they have really good service and they are super fast but I was unimpressed by the food. Maybe I should have tried my bf's food or maybe I'll need to come back again and retry that green curry but for now I'm sad to say that this wouldn't \u00a0be on the top of my recommendation list if you are really looking for good Thai food :(."], ["Tammy L.", "I had a nice experience here. The waitress allowed my friend and I to choose where we wanted to sit. She was very attentive - maybe a bit too attentive.

I ordered the glass noodles with shrimp, which was seasoned very nicely. The shrimp was full of flavor, there were a lot of vegetables, but not a lot of noodles - which was a bit disappointing. The portion was kind of small for its price. The chairs are comfortable here and when it gets dark, they put candles on the table.

They explained it was 4 of them and we should be okay with one order. We should have listened. The spring rolls are the size of egg rolls!!! They were so good I ended up eating my 4 and so did my friend thereafter making us pack the food. I ordered pineapple fried rice and it was made perfectly. The pineapple were nice and hot, not overcooked. The cashews were soft. The rice was just right. My friend ordered the chicken pa thai and it was SO GOOD.

Everything was incredibly tasty, and might possibly have been the best Thai food I've ever eaten! All the ingredients were very fresh. The green beans actually had that snap to them that gets lost if they're frozen. Also, portions were super huge. We all ate until we were stuffed, and there was still some food left on the plates!To top it off, service was excellent. Cups of water were routinely refilled without asking, the food came out hot and fresh within 10 minutes of ordering, extra plates / chopsticks / serving spoons were provided promptly.

The medium spice level was perfect, it had a kick without being overbearing where one is unable to really enjoy the dish.

I had the Massaman Chicken Curry and it was pretty darn good. It came with a generous bowl of jasmine rice to dip into the curry. The chicken was a bit underwhelming, the curry was delicious with just a minor hint of heat. Not something people should order if they love spicy food.I also had a scoop of Rose Lychee Sorbet and that was pretty filling on top of the thai iced tea that I had. The Thai Ice tea was really sweet and delicious as well. For the 3 it came out to about $20 which was a good price I believe. I would definitely go back to try some of the desserts"], ["Lianne W.", "Only ordered their 12 flavor sample palette, only flavors that really stood out...so let's get straight to the point.Yayy: Thai Coffee, Thai Iced Tea, White Miso Almond, Chocolate Cheesecake, DurianEhhh: Mangosteen, Lychee Rose, Blueberry Brie, Honey Ginger, Thai Coconut, Black Sesame Seawood, Omg No: Cucumber Lime"], ["Melissa D.", "This is only about the ice cream and sorbet. For a busy place, the counter girl was so happy to offer samples, a girl after my own heart. The cucumber-lime sorbet is tangy and refreshing. The dark chocolate sorbet is creamy, rich, and part of me can't believe it is not ice cream. Dorian is a sweet and sour mango-like fruit ice cream. The honey-ginger is given a light floral flavor from the honey and ends with a spicy zip from the ginger. The toasted Thai coconut has bits of shredded coconut in a very milky flavored base. There are great size options; I love the fact that they offer an actual 1 scoop serving, but for those days when 1 flavor won't suffice, there is a slightly large size with 2 flavors. I can't wait to try more!"], ["Angela C.", "As soon as we walked in, someone greeted and seated us. It was pretty empty when we entered, but started to get packed when we left. Mind you, it's not a terribly big place. It's mostly seats for two people, with a few booth/chair combination seatings that fit 4, maybe 5 or 6 if you add extra chairs in.I got the spicy noodles and steamed mushroom dumplings. It tasted like a home-cooked meal. It was delicious, authentic, and you could tell the chef is great at what he/she does. The spicy noodles came with flat thick rice noodles and you could have your pickings of what you wanted in it. I got tofu and vegetables and it was a great accompaniment. I do have to say that for something that was given a few stars for spiciness, it wasn't spicy at all. Next time, I will definitely have to tell them to make it extra extra extra spicy. The steamed dumplings were very simple - a little bit on the sour side (pickling?) with a sweet soy dipping sauce. My group got tom yum noodle soup and pad see ew, and there was not a bite left on any of their dishes. The food here is fantastic, as is the wonderful staff with their welcoming service.

A lot of variety of ice cream to choose from. Very cute idea for sampling"], ["Andrew W.", "3 stars because this place is okay. Exotic flavors (ex. ginger, durian, cucumber) were a little weird which is expected. Fruity flavors were up to par. I got the palette/12 flavor sampler just so I could try out the many flavors. Many favorites taste exactly as you'd expect. So if you simply like the name of the flavor, you can't go wrong with just trying it. These are some of the flavors I remember distinctly having:Cucumber - refreshing but one bite is enoughNutella banana - go bananas for coco!!! (favorite)Durian - I don't eat durian as fruit, but even I would assume it tastes like the real deal Thai Coffee - \u00a0Taste like sugary coffee (second favorite)Ginger - very strong ginger flavor so unless you like it, stay awayService was satisfactory. Warning, I would not drink the water coming from the glass bottles from the refrigerator. You may notice an orange smear on the lip of these glass bottles. We concluded it was rust from the white metal cap. It's a non-issue.

They're not huge scoops, but they're just right.My favorites: black sesame seaweed, roasted coconut (MMM), thai thea, and lychee sorbet. You can't really go wrong with anything though.They also have pints to-go. DANGEROUS. And, surprisingly (because I thought it was mostly known for ice cream), their pad thai is delicious!"], ["Maggie L.", "Everything is pleasant, except service can be slow. The pad Thai is good but my chicken pad Thai was overwhelmed with chicken pieces and it made me not want to eat it. The pieces didn't taste flavored and it left a grainy taste.

Came with my sister after doing last minute Christmas shopping at Target close by. Their menu features a \"no-carb\" pad thai, made of papaya noodles--a perfect diet-friendly option, but who are we kidding, diets don't happen at a place that coexists with a massive array of must-try ice cream. Their no-carb pad-thai is magnificent in texture, almost more pleasant than regular noodles, filled with egg, bean sprouts, green onion, and ground peanuts. The pad thai wonseen, the carb-friendly version made of clear vermicelli rice noodles was not half as good as the carb-free counterpart. They messed up my order and remade it quickly, atop of the long wait we had making it. It was a soggy mess, missing the flavors that pad thai is supposed to have--sweet, salty and sour and savory. It was very bland compared to other places I've had, and I've had a lot of Pad Thai. The vegetables, although nicely presented, was bland, boiled in hot water without salt and mixed in last minute after they messed up my order. The chicken was overcooked, most likely boiled and thrown in the wok for a second spin in cooking as well. The dish was served warm, instead of hot, atop a fold piece of \"oil soaking\" parchment paper that was pretty unnecessary. It was already soggy and flavorless, the paper took away from the dish even more. We tried the Thai ice tea ice cream and the lychee rose sorbet. The Thai tea was perfect and so flavorful, just like drinking a glass of cold Thai ice tea. However, the lychee rose as pleasant sounding as it is, was overpoweringly sweet. The lychee masked the delicate rose flavor and it became quite monotone. I'd want to try the other flavors next time, the palette looks like a pretty good idea. The customers consisted of young, single, hipster Brooklynites on flip phones, wearing flannel shirts, and a few young fobby teens. Even with literally 3 tables occupied in the house, the kitchen was slow and messed up our order because the waitress had difficulty understanding English. Ice cream is the way to go here, as the subpar kitchen with fairly young cooks do not have much experience with authentic Thai cuisine, as it seems this is catered for the young, hip crowd. Come for the sweets, only."], ["Joanna N.", "Although I am a total ice cream snob, I did not try SkyIce until tonight. I seem to go through my Brooklyn list quite slow and for no good reason really. I had a wonderful dinner here tonight with Adeline L. and Amy N.!The place is quite small and casual with only a handful of tables and some counter bar seating along the right wall. Huge blackboard menu is above the colorful ice cream display towards the back listing their savory lunch/dinner dishes that include a small variety of appetizers, noodles and curries. We got there about 645 and had to wait roughly 1/2 hr -- everyone already sitting seemed to have gotten there just a bit earlier and placed their orders at the same time. By the time we got a table, everyone was leaving. Anyway..Adeline and I split the spicy noodle with shrimp and the khao soi with grilled beef. Amy ordered the mushroom dumplings, chicken satay and the Pad See Eu to split with her little one.Spicy noodles were excellent. A tad oilier than I've had at other spots but definitely had a nice kick and came with plenty of shrimp, egg and veggies. Not the biggest portion but we had come for the ice cream sampler so it was no problem. The khao soi was the winner, though. The curry broth was so creamy and coconut-y -- I couldn't get enough. If it wasn't for the ice cream coming, I would have ordered rice to soak up all the remaining curry! We didn't like the grilled beef on top though, it was soo tough and chewy.After sufficient carb loading, we ordered the much anticipated ice cream palette that comes with 12 mini scoops. These 'mini' scoops were actually a decent size. For $9.50, I thought it was total steal since I'm used to paying $4-5 for a single scoop at my favorite neighborhood ice cream shops. Anyway, the ice cream! So colorful and just visually appetizing. Most of the scoops came with a cute adornment, such as the teeny tiny cone atop the thai tea scoop. Our sampler also came with 7 other flavors -- caramel sea salt, coconut, banana nutella, white miso almond, black sesame seaweed, vanilla bean, honey ginger and 4 sorbets -- mango, cucumber lime, raspberry cilantro and lychee rose.My favorites were the thai tea(legit), banana nutella(1 dip, 2 dip GONE), lychee rose and cucumber lime(so, so refreshing!). All of these tasted true to their names and exactly as they should. The rest were just okay because the flavor was too subtle -- like the black sesame seaweed for instance -- I couldn't taste either flavor. White miso almond had a very mild miso aftertaste but I couldn't taste the almond. Anyways, texturally, the ice cream is definitely on the thinner side but very smooth. Sorbets were a good, standard soft texture. Overall, decent sampler of interesting fun flavors.Would I return? Yes! Savory dishes were solid. Sweets, too although I'll probably stick to a few scoops of that thai tea or banana nutella the next time.CC minimum, $15; no Amex!"], ["Carina F.", "Come here for their ICE CREAM and NOT for the food. Whenever I'm in Park Slope, I always make a point to have ice cream here- particularly their lychee rose and thai tea. I've ordered more savory dishes- ie. Tom Yum Soup and I swear it tasted like it came straight from a Mama Instant Noodles Packet. No bueno!"], ["Judy Z.", "They have such good homemade icecream! I love that the flavors are easily tasteable along with the chunks of fruit. They even had a durian flavor, which was delicious! Must try for durian lovers.

My friend ordered the No Carb Pad Thai and I usually get regular Pad Thai but I decided to be adventurous and try something new.The Tao Kua noodle dish was an array of chicken and shrimps, clear bean noodle, hard boiled egg, pineapple, cucumber, crispy egg noodle, bean sprout, steamed chinese broccoli served with a jar of peanut dressing in the center. It came almost like a dipping platter but I mixed it all together with the sauce. This dish was good mostly because of the peanut sauce bringing everything together but I probably wouldn't get it again. I had a bite of my friend's no carb pad Thai, where instead of noodles, there was shredded papaya. I'll just stick to regular pad Thai.For dessert, I had mango sorbet and dark chocolate sorbet. They were both soft and smooth, the perfect texture! But my friend'a Belgian chocolate was the freaking best!

You get a menu that's laminated in plastic with a dry erase marker to order which I've noticed have gotten very popular in this hipster, trendy Asian restaurants lol. One had a low carb Pad Thai, one had a Thai fried rice and I had a green curry with rice and chicken. The low carb Pad Thai was pretty good and so was the Thai fried rice it had like a sweetness to it. My green curry was really good but it was sooo spicy towards the bottom where all the sauce was. I couldn't even finish it and let me tell you something I never think food is spicy. So, if you like spicy food I highly recommend it. For dessert the ordering system is the same, we decided to order the big sample portion so we could have more ice cream to taste. There's sorbet too which is nice if you are lactose intolerant or allergic to dairy.

My entree choice was the No Carb Pad Thai which consisted of Papaya noodles, egg, peanuts, bean sprouts, scallion, turnip, and smoked tofu - I switched the tofu for shrimp as I'm not a fan. I have to say that I expected so much more from this dish and was highly disappointed. The reviews I read raved about this dish, but I sadly to say I didn't jump on the fan bandwagon. It lacked flavor in every way possible and I was very surprised as Thai cuisine usually has such great taste. I know it's supposed to be a \"healthy alternative to pad Thai\", but come on at least spice it up a bit. Drinks 9/10I had the lemongrass ice tea which was absolutely AMAZING and a great addition to my meal. It was refreshing and herbal all in one. Definitely the reason I would make a second trip!

Though it was delicious and was not as sweet as other places. Jo and I shared the Khao Soi with grilled beef and the Spicy Noodles with shrimp. Both were very good but I enjoyed the Spicy Noodles more although it was not spicy to me at all (I have a high tolerance for spicy foods). The Khao Soi curry was delicious...a good coconut and creamy flavor. \u00a0The only downside was that the beef was terrible. It was so tough and chewy, and lacked flavor on its own (I was quite disappointed). Amy ordered the mushroom dumplings, \u00a0chicken satay and Pad See Ew. I tried a dumpling and I could not taste the mushrooms much. The noodles were delicious. Not spicy at all and had great flavor. Then came what we all waited for and probably the reason why we came here.....ICE CREAM!!!!!! We ordered and shared the Ice Cream Sampler to get a taste of most of the flavors. They came in tiny scoops. My favorite was the Thai Tea. The little one also loved it and ate all of it haha. Other favorites were the Lychee Rose...(yummy!!!!!!), and the Cucumber Lime...(refreshing!!!!!) The Caramel Sea Salt was nice but saltier than I liked. There was not much miso and black sesame flavor in the White Miso Sliced Almond and the Black Sesame Seaweed. Our sampler also included Coconut, Banana Nutella, Vanilla Bean, Honey Ginger, Mango and Raspberry Cilantro sorbets. I will definitely be returning for more ice cream!!!

I recall seeing Thai Tea, Black Sesame Seaweed, Caramel Sea Salt, Cucumber Lime, Basil, Veggie, and Green Tea, among others. My two friends and I decided to split the Ice Cream Sushi, which was quite an ingenious little dessert! Four quenelles of coconut ice cream were topped with, respectively, kiwi, lychee, and blackberries. A side of soy sauce and wasabi (read: chocolate sauce and green tea paste) were served in a bowl with a sprinkling of candied ginger beside the bowl on the plate. It was a great treat and a good dessert to share amongst friends. This is definitely a niche place, but one that works well. I'd be curious to see what their limited Thai food menu tastes like if I'm ever in the area again."], ["Shelley L.", "Great place to get dessert. We tried the SkyIce palette sampler which lets you try 12 flavors of ice cream and sorbet. It was kept well because nothing was too overly frozen. The 12 flavors were:Raspberry cilantroCucumber limeLycheeDark chocolateThai teaCaramel sea saltMangoBlack sesame White miso with almondVanilla or coconutTwo other flavors I couldn't pin pointWe ordered the mango sticky rice which was pretty good. The mango was perfect. Would definitely go back for ice cream and sorbet."], ["Katrina L.", "They have an assortment of unique homemade ice cream flavors.Cucumber lime - Very refreshing.Black sesame seaweed - Salty. I'm usually a fan of sesame, but I didn't enjoy this one.Thai Tea - Tastes exactly like Thai iced tea. Yum.Thai Coffee - Tastes just like Thai iced coffee. Yum.White Miso - Interesting...(I came only for the ice cream, so can't comment on the food)"], ["Andrew F.", "great ice-cream. I tried thai tea and black sesame seaweed. they were both amazing. i would have to say one of the best ice cream shops in BK. would reccomend."], ["Katie H.", "Where else can you get ice cream in flavors like: Durian, Black Sesame Seaweed, White Miso and Almond & Thai Tea? One word my friends: SkyIce.What an adorable part of Park Slope! My college friend suggested this place and when I looked at the menu as well as the reviews, I was pretty excited to check this eatery out. At a glance, SkyIce is undoubtedly cozy, casual and a decent size. During the warmer weather they open up the windows and you can people watch to your hearts content. The decor is very charming with their wooden benches and tables, hardwood floors and exposed brick. We sat down right away and glanced at the menu.... It was selective but covered all the basics of a Thai establishment.I ordered the Spicy Noodle (extra spicy of course) with chicken. It was just the right amount of heat. As well as with the addition of egg, bell pepper, onion and carrot balanced out the dish pretty well. (For $9.75- good portion too.) Yes the dinner was good but what we REALLY came for was that \"ice, ice baby!\"* I have to say, choosing two flavors was a difficult feat. However, I rose above and made my mind: Thai Tea and White Miso Almond. I tried a safe and a unsafe flavor. Luckily I loved both. The Thai Tea tasted like the drink itself in ice cream form. I could eat that every day, for real. As for the White Miso Almond... totally unexpected combination of flavors, but they WORKED. And well I might add. If you're feeling a bit risky, go for that one. I was tempted to convince my friend to go for the sampler, but we were too full. Next time, we'll just go straight for the ice cream.SkyIce may be advertise sweet and savory, but in a battle between the both... I think the sweet takes the gold in this case. Can't wait to come back on a nice hot summer day. _____________________*Stuck in my head the ENTIRE time I wrote this review. Damn you Vanilla Ice."], ["Samantha L.", "This restaurant is a gem of its neighborhood. \u00a0When you walk it, it's spacious but super cozy. I was under the impression this was only an ice cream spot however was pleasantly surprised by its full range of Thai dishes from curries to noodles! The server was very pleasant and immediately offered samples of its ice cream. Having heard my indecisiveness also directed me to their 12 Assortment mini sample on their menu - which will be tried next time! I resorted to the Thai Coffee ice cream which was refreshing with just a hint of creaminess. The portion was much bigger than I expected which is always a plus :)"], ["Danny S.", "The food at SkyIce is decent, if I was rating just the food alone I would probably give it a 3-3.5 stars. However, the ice cream is A-M-A- Zinnnnng! My favorite is the Thai tea ice cream. Just picked up a pint yesterday and it's almost finished. The ice cream along with the very good customer service as well as a nice clean atmosphere is enough for me to give this place 5 stars."], ["Jennifer Z.", "Its a very cute place near the Barcleys center and the Alantic Pacific mall.Although this place is known for its savory ice cream , many still come in for the Thai food(it looked really good , the lady next t o me had it).Even though it looked really good my friends and I had the 12 sample platter of ice cream. My favorite flavors there would be the green tea and thai ice cream. \u00a0The waiter there was very polite and gave us water right away as my friends and I sat down. I gave this place a 4 outta 5 stars because \u00a0I didn't really like all the flavors on the platter ,but im pretty sure I will go back to try there Thai food."], ["Amy N.", "Despite the huge meal I had at my daughter's Thanksgiving celebration at her school earlier, I still managed to meet up with my gal pals, and for their ice cream! Wanted to come alone, next thing you know, after Kaylen seeing a picture of the ice cream palette on the Yelp page, left opened on my desktop, she had to tag along. Got here a bit before 7, Jo and Addy were already here waiting for a table. The place is a bit small and all the seats were already filled. Only a handful of tables and a couple of bar stools along the wall, we waited roughly 20-30 minutes. Finally, we were seated next to the random shelf filled with children's books...and toys? Luckily Kaylen didn't notice, otherwise I'm sure it will be a big mess. Anyways, it's a Thai place, me and Addy never eats without getting our iced tea fix! The cups were a bit on the small side, so were the portions of the food. The tea tasted legit, until....going downstairs to use the restroom and then a big box with the words \"Thai iced tea powder\" written on it....hmm. It still tasted great, though.For starters, we kind of shared the mushroom dumplings and a chicken satay. The thinnest dumplings I have ever eaten. The spices they had in there were so overpowering that I could barely taste any of the filling, or any mushroom in the filling at all since they were so flat. The chicken satay are dry, I guess overcooked, and needs to be seasoned more, I guess that's when the dipping sauce comes in.Moving on, Joanna N. and Adeline L. ordered the Khao Soi (hope I spelled it correctly) with beef. The curry was excellent, if I wasn't so full from the meal at the school earlier, I would've got a bowl of good ole rice and killed the rest of the soup left over. Nice creamy texture with a big punch of coconut milk. The only downside was the beef, overcooked and tough to chew. Pad Thai not on the menu tonight for some reason, so Kaylen and I shared a Shrimp Pad See Ew instead. Good amount of shrimp for the small portion, but the dish was made a bit too sweet. I still haven't found a better Thai place that can beat Potjanee, yet.The star of the night would be the ice cream palette. It's a sampler that comes with 12 mini scoops of their homemade ice cream which includes 4 sorbets and 8 ice creams. The little finishing touches WOW-ed Kaylen. The decorations somewhat gave us the hint of some of the flavors. For instance, a mini sugar cone on the Thai iced tea, simply a piece of teddy gram on vanilla bean, a sprinkle of rose petals on the lychee, taro chip(maybe?) embedded in the salted caramel, and toasted coconuts on the coconut ice cream. The cucumber lime was crisp and is my most favorite of them all. The mango and lychee rose sorbets were super refreshing. The vanilla bean ice cream is rich. The caramel sea salt, banana nutella, Thai iced tea all tasted true to their given names. The white miso almond, and the honey ginger were very mild, the raspberry cilantro was so tart that it kind of threw my tastes buds off. Definitely would come back again for their ice creams!"], ["Shali W.", "The food is OK, I give 5 stars only for the dessert. Seriously this is the best place for a taste of Asian desert. Oh the durian ice cream, I could come here everyday just for that! But I swear I'd also try something else next time!"], ["David N.", "This casual eatery in Park Slope neighborhood boast Northern Thai cuisine and interesting ice cream flavor combinations all under one roof. The menu is a mix of hipsterized Thai food. The Pad Thai was a bit on the sweet side as most non-Asian would like. The Tom Yum noodle I got looked promising but lacked any of the strong flavors typically associated it it.The Durian ice cream on the other hand was quite good. I'd say my favorite part of the meal. The food is served on plastic bowls, cups and utensils is a bit downscale and not quite eco friendly for those environmentalist Slopers. Interior is small and simple with written menu on the chalk board above."], ["Jenny L.", "Came here afterwork with the bf, while exploring Flatbush.First off, the interior of the place is really dainty and cute. I heard about this place from a few friends because of the ice creams palette as an attraction.While we were not hungry enough for the palette, the Thai tea flavor was really good! I love Thai ice tea, and the restaurant serves Thai food as well.Definitely look forward to trying out more flavor a next time I go back."], ["M A.", "Great place for ice cream!

Food: Overall a 4 /5.spicy noodles with shrimp - generous portions of shrimp. The vegetables and herbs that were used complemented the dish. Rich in flavor, but it was a tad saltier than what I'm used to. These were the flat rice noodlesMussels - huge portions and the sauce was deliciousPad see-ew - it was full of flavor but i thought it was ok. Half way through, I wanted to try a new flavor. It didn't stand out compared to other pad see-ews. These were the flat rice noodles. Pad Thai - I have to admit, it's among one of the best pad thai dishes I've tasted. Excellent flavor and portion size. The only thing is...there's too much bean sprouts, but you can always push it aside. Service: It was ok. My family came on a Saturday night at 7pm. We waited for about 45 minutes. They were extremely busy, so they did the best they can. I was glad that they refilled our waters without us flagging them down. They came by once to see how our meals were and if we needed anything else. Ambiance: Pretty modern. They have a small section for bar seating. There is indoor and outdoor seating. I recommend trying the outdoor seating on a cool night. \u00a0Their menus are on construction paper and the specials are handwritten, which is rather unique.

Offering a wide range of options for under $10, they deliver both affordability and quality- a combination that is all too hard to find in a city like New York.Opting to sit at the bar, I enjoyed the green curry with chicken and vegetables, or one of their spicier dishes. While not very spicy at all by my standards, it nonetheless was tasty, and more than enough for two meals.

I swear I drooled a little on the table; more from exhaustion than anything else, but the descriptions of the food were making me dizzy. Let the Thai gorge begin...What I chose was the summer roll with salmon, green papaya salad and green coconut curry with pad thai noodles, shrimp and broccoli. My friend chose spicy noodles with shrimp, a roast pork salad and green coconut curry with pork. We cross picked with our chopsticks and I contemplated sucking the sweet and sour juices in the plate that once contained the summer roll after it disappeared in less than 5 minutes.

Not that it matters, I could never finish it all anyway but I was highly disappointed as it was very bland and had no favors what so ever. I used the soy sauce and regretted it even more remembering they have horrible soy sauce. Their shitty service is still there though. Rushed and as if you're non existent to them.

Also, the bowl made it hard for me to use the spoon. I had to lift it up and pour it into the spoon or my mouth (doesn't look ladylike.) The mango sticky rice was bad AND small in portions. The mango was going bad and the rice was falling apart. I thought this was called sticky rice? Is it really worth $6? What was worse was that it took 20 minutes for the waitress to take $40 off my bill because I was using the Yelp deal. Seriously. . I can calculate that in seconds.

And then gets a plate of mussels 5 minutes after that?I really wish I could say the food was worth the wait.Thai sausage was good but didn't come with ginger and chilis.Chicken satay seemed like it was deep fried / pan fried but I could be mistaken. The reason I believe it was fried was because the chicken was really bland even kthough the spices were visible. Oil and high temps tend to bury and destroy flavors. It was also a little too evenly crispy to be a grilled product.Unfortunately, every entree was extremely overseasoned, especially the pad thai. I had enough sauce in mine to make 3 more orders. My dad gave away half of his duck. Like the rest of the food, it was inedibly salty beyond the first few bites. 6 of us could not finish our food.We would have complained but by the time we got our food, it was 40 minutes before closing time and we had nowhere else to go. We were asked how the food was three times and we wanted to be polite so we just said everything was good. By the third time, my dad caved and admitted that everything was too salty. The owner (?) was somewhat sympathetic but only suggested we request less salt next time. Sir, that complaint was meant to be a suggestion to you to ease up on the salt for everyone else.Auto 20% tip included.

It wasn't the usual brown rice: it was more grainy and tasted much healthier. I'd recommend it over white rice.For dessert, we got my fianc\u00e9's favorite: mango w/ sweet sticky rice. The mango was just eh, probably since it wasn't the season for it in NY. The rice was perfectly made.Like I said, the good was good but the service was lousy. The owner was very nice and we had a great conversation. The waitresses did not speak good English, which to me is important.Improve on the faster service and I'd give this place another star.

What I like about Glow Thai is not only their Bangkok street food, but how everything is orchestrated. I like the ambiance, the lighting, and the pretty Thai waitress. My highlight of the evening was actually a simple Pad Kee Mao (Thai Drunken Noodle). To cook Thai food right, you need the perfect combination of all the flavors:sweet, sour, spicy, and salty. (No, we Thai do not care much for the purity of flavors for all those food purist out there! =D ) \u00a0Overall, I think the chef that Glow Thai understands flavors.

I left my last review on a sad note, because I wasn't a fan of the live music they had had that night. Anthony- the owner - messaged me offering me a free appetizer if I ever came back. The service here is amazing. I had the same bubbly little waitress. Anthony even stopped by to chat for a while as well . Like I mentioned in my previous review, Glow is currently BYOB. I love BYOB, which is probably the biggest reason that I came back out to Glow in the first place. Glow does not charge a cork fee or a \"per-glass\" fee like other places do. They chilled both my bottles for us when we walked in and kept our glasses filled the whole night. Anthony was super nice. He had a glass of wine with us and was super easy to talk to. He seems to really care about his restaurant and values customer opinion. Passion is what makes things great!My friend and I ordered curry puffs, spring rolls, fish cakes, a new dish- Viet (?) styled sticky wings, and chicken pad thai. Everything came out pretty good, but I especially like the curry puffs and the chicken pad thai. They make their pad thai very flavorful, and their portions are a decent size too. The spring rolls came out hot and just fried, and the curry puffs were crisp on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. Yum!

The soup was yummy as always. HOWEVER, the usually cozy red curry was anything but! The heat (spice) of the red curry was ABSENT as was the usually creamy texture. Not only was the spice missing the curry sauce was WATERY!!When I entered the restaurant I saw that their grade was pending! It couldn't be; the standards at National subpar!? I should have heeded the sign. I will, of course, give my beloved National a chance to redeem themselves. The chance could have been today, but it was just too soon.

No hassle from anyone either, in fact the waiter kept filling my glass with water way after the check was paid. The ambiance is pretty nice though. The restaurant has a bit of a lounge feel to it with the dim lighting and you can easily find yourself getting a little too comfortable.The food did take a bit longer than i'd like, and I was really frustrated because I didn't know what I was getting into.

It wasn't a particularly well-balanced meal, but I liked it nonetheless.Kitchen service is super quick. We skipped appetizers because we were in a rush, and we were able to finish our meal in less than half an hour, which is amazing.

After that, I knew it would be a great indicator of the other dishes I ordered. The green curry was not watered down, spicy, plenty of veggies and nice big pieces of tofu. Delicious! As far as the fried rice, it wasn't oily, so that's a bonus, just wish they didn't put as much soy sauce and/or bumped up the fish sauce, there was plenty of chicken and pineapple to satisfy.

One time I hung up and called back only \u00a0to receive a busy signal for over 45 minutes. Amazing. How can you run a business like this ? Why do I keep calling?

This is some of the best Thai food you will find in Williamsburg at a very reasonable price. My favorite items on the menu are 1) Pad Thai \u00a02) Basil Chicken \u00a03) Cashew Chicken. The Pad Thai is to die for. You can order it spicy for an extra kick at no additional charge. One of Sri Thai Cafe's strengths is its lunch special. You can get a soup/salad, spring roll, and entree for $7-8 depending on what entree you select. It is A LOT of food for the price. The reason why Sri Thai Cafe does not get 5 stars is that actually eating AT the restaurant can be a downer. The restaurant is so small and the seating is so close to the open kitchen that it often feels cramped and very noisy. This is definitely not a place I would take a date. That being said, if I want carry-out Thai food, I am coming to Sri Thai Cafe and nowhere else.

I would have given the food 4 stars earlier on, but something has happened in the past 2 months. The flavor has been really inconsistent. More importantly, when I have expressed NOT SPICEY, I keep getting something more like a 2 or 3 star level of spice. For those of you who like it hot, by all means go, but if you're someone like me who doesn't want to be in pain for the duration of a meal and then flee in search of ice cream (ok, yes I'd get the ice cream anyway, but that's besides the point), then do not order here.

The vegetables all seem really fresh.

Anyway, we're both pretty vegetarian and you can either get the tofu or extra veggies as the meat replacement, and both are good ideas. They have typical puffy white tofu plus that stuff that sort of looks like a cooked slice of portobello; it's nice to have a variety.One problem is that there are only 3-4 tables inside and the two-person one is right next to the door which blows in cold rainy air on you if it happens to be cold and rainy.

Also, the penang shrimp curry is something like 11 or 12 dollars and you get 4 shrimp. Not sure why it is so much more than their other dishes. The shrimp are really dirty here! Extra dirty. They do not clean the poop out and often you are staring down at your plate with huge strings of shrimp poop staring back at you. Gross.

No room to accommodate all of us at the time we stopped in, but asked the hostesses to call us while we meandered around the neighborhood during a 10 minute wait for another party to clear out. We were called shortly thereafter and were seated promptly, but it took awhile for waitresses to take our order and bring out glasses of ice and wine glasses for our beverages. When they finally took our orders, it took about 15 minutes to get our food. The kitchen was quite busy with other customers and takeout orders. Most of our party enjoys spicy food and asked for either medium or spicy for the heat of our dishes - and these were spot-on levels of spiciness for Thai food. My medium spiced papaya salad and pineapple vegetarian curry had a good amount of heat. My bf's mild shrimp pad Thai noodle dish also packed a little bit of a bite. He also had the fried crab rolls which were so-so because they were overlooked and burnt on the outside. Some of our friends in the party ordered spicy noodles - there dishes were HOT to the point that they were sweating from the heat. Tasted a friend's beef pad see-uw and it was also very tasty. While the food was near 4 stars, the service was more like a 1 or 2 stars - we had to ask for glasses of ice, which were brought out promptly, but only to half our party. So we asked again and still waited another 10 minutes for the remainder to be brought out. We asked for wine glasses and a corkscrew, but they only brought us 3 glasses despite having two bottles of wine. We asked for water for the table and only received it halfway through the meal when we asked the waitress again about it. We asked the waitress to take a quick group photo after our food was served and she refused on the premise that she had other customers, but there were no new customers who walked in at that point, more was there anyone waiting to get their food. It took us several attempts to get her attention to tally the check - at one point, we were taking turns to raise our hands to get her attention. \u00a0When we finally got her attention and she brought the check, we asked again for the group photo and she had a girl who was bussing the tables do the task instead. Value for the food was very reasonable - nothing was overpriced and it was not an exorbitant bill at the end.

The decor is 5 star - really relaxing with a fountain in the middle, the bathrooms are nice and clean with Kama Sutra dolls lining the wall, a big bathtub serving as a sink, the bar is very nice as well.

We had the sea bass, the salmon, beef in garlic sauce, beef in basil sauce, the calamari appetizer, the beef steak appetizer (side sauces were amazing), and the chicken appetizer (we went on a Groupon deal and went back the next day with friends hence the many dishes we tried). Everything was really good and I can honestly say that besides the chicken appetizer (which was just nothing too special for me, but still good), I would order any of those dishes again if we went back. The reason for my four star review is that when we initially walked in with the Groupon, the hostess was less than nice. We also got put in a corner from which it was hard to see the fountain or the rest of the cool decor (even though the place was empty, and remained nearly so until we left).

However, we were extremely disappointed as they ran out of Seabass at 7:30pm that night. For some reason, when I called to make a reservation, I was told by the woman who answered the phone that they were all booked between 7pm-9pm.However, my boyfriend who called 30 minutes after I did, made a reservation without any problems whatsoever. When we arrived at 7:30, the place was only half full. There were many empty tables, which were not reserved. I know this because we dined for about an hour and those seats remained empty.Thai Iced Tea- Tasted like 80% sugar and 20% tea. Mekhong Rib Eye Steak- Terrific, exactly the way it tasted the previous time we came Mooh Dang Mooh Grohb- Overpriced. Was basically Chinese \"char sew\" and \"sew yuk\" Crispy Duck Salad- Was yummy, the duck was crispy. The salad was overall very acidic, which I like.Tom Yum- Tasted too lemony. The chicken was so dry and hard. It must have been sitting in soup for hours. Salmon Teh-Pho Curry In Clay Pot- Honestly, the curry was terrible. It was sour and \u00a0tasted like creamy tom yum soup, which didn't go with the salmon. I tossed my salmon into my boyfriend's curry dish and ate out of his pot. Bangkok Chicken Pumpkin Curry - The pumpkin and flavor of the curry was good, but the chicken was the same dry chicken I had in my tom yum soup. Overall, my experience here was a 1 star. We waited 20 minutes for the check and asked out waitress twice, but she still didn't give us our check. We had to flag down a different waiter before the check was given to us. One of the reasons why I most likely won't be coming back again.... not even for the delicious Seabass is because the servers and waitresses here run back and forth like they're in a circus show. There's a current circulating in the room as they're furiously dashing by. The whole situation makes me feel extremely uncomfortable, as I can't even enjoy a meal without random gusts of wind flowing by.It amazes me how they seem to run back and forth, yet not get any work done (Seriously, 30 minutes for a check?)Mind you, the restaurant was only half full.I said to my boyfriend, \"If I were to stick out my foot at any point in time during this meal, dishes would go flying and someone would get hurt.\""], ["Larry S.", "The food was really good & the bar made great drinks that were 4.99 for a margarita which i found to be great.

Come here if you want to wait 20 minutes for anything. Let it be a cup of water or an extra napkin. Your only chance of getting their attention is when they bring food to your table and that's if you can even catch them before they hurriedly rush away. The other tables around us were annoyed as well, constantly trying to flag down a waiter only to be ignored. We ordered a bunch of dishes and was excited about the pork belly. Boy, were we disappointed. It is SO bland, dry and chewy. Pad thai is pad thai..if you pride yourself in being a Thai restaurant, you should at the very least be able to deliver decent pad Thai. And decent it was so nothing to be excited about. We didn't finish any of the food we ordered and we didn't bother taking it to go because we didn't want to wait another 20 minutes. But when it was time to ask for the bill, they responded with lightning speed. The bizarre thing was that they charged 18% tip automatically. It was just myself and a friend. I am not against tipping generously if the service was great but it was terrible. The waiter did not smile, not even once, was rude and inattentive. Unfortunately, I had to come again because my boyfriend (knowing that I love Thai food) coincidently bought a groupon deal. He did not know I had already tried the place out.

Both more than just fine but not innovative or special in taste.

My favorite dish here is the curry duck. Their Currys are good but not really the other dishes. The other dishes seemed too salty. They are ok but I think what people like about this place is the atmosphere. It's a very dimmed place where there's also a Dj spinning music here. Then drinks here are not too expensive and are pretty good especially the margaritas and mojito."], ["Dacia B.", "I came here last Saturday to celebrate a special day with my family. First off, the decor is out of this world. Swings to sit on whole you wait for a table, runway fountain/cool in the middle of the restaurant, large sunroof and even the bathrooms had a unique design. This place is perfect for large groups. The appetizers and food was amazing. I forgot the names of everyone's meal and drinks being that it was 7 of us. But the passion fruit margarita, Tim Tim chicken and chicken wings were great."], ["Tamar O.", "I've been to Sea dozens of times at this point. Definitely my favorite spot to eat in Williamsburg. Beautiful, modern decor with great food. My friend and I went for dinner on a Tuesday night and were seated promptly. I know later in the evening and weekends it gets very busy and there can be a bit of a wait as they don't take reservations. We ordered drink; Pink Lady with Pearls and a mango mojito. The mojito was great and pretty strong while the pink lady kinda looked and tasted like Pepeti Bismol. Definitely wouldn't recommend it. Their menu is huge! So many items to choose from but we decided on a caesar salad (a favorite of mine), crab rangoon, and spare ribs as apps. Everything was good except the ribs were on the fatty. We also ordered rama the king with shrimp, 6o'clock spicy fire fried rice, and another chicken and beef dish my friend ordered. All of these dishes were great! The rice was spicy!!!! Just be warned... It was perfect for me but may be too spicy for others. Can't wait to go back!"], ["Spicy Carb L.", "Def a fun place to hang out. I could see it being a hopping place to chill at night. Good for us, we are homebodies and not into crowds and/or inebriated folks and got there for a very, very late Saturday lunch at 4.We went by recommendation of a coworker of the husband's who heard I was looking for a yummy mojito with rolls.Thankfully the food wasn't too pricey as the food was just alright and you could definitely \u00a0get yummier (and more authentic-tasting) Thai and Japanese at other places. This is a fun place to eat, not necessarily a yummy place to eat. The menu is extensive, and I probably didn't order what I'm supposed to - since most Asian places specialize in a kind of dish or a few dishes and most people go and don't realize it and order things off the menu that are on the menu for people who don't like what the specialty foods are. Hah.Would I go back? Eh, it's a fun neighborhood walk around but not worth the traffic from Queens and def not worth going just for the food. Flushing for me!"], ["Abelle N.", "Lunch - the meeting I never miss!I was hoping this was going to have the most amazing Thai food ever...since there was so many good raving reviews about this place...But I will tell you that I am not a big fan of their Thai food or drinks...but for a different reason... Because of its appearance I am always expecting it to taste that good anyways... every bite was full of MSG and oil...its like a bad surprise! I know that sounds weird...but it seems like my taste buds was grossed out with the flavors in all their dishes... i wanted to experience something new so i got a few of their specialty drinks and it was terrible..didn't like the bathrooms at all! really weird..."], ["Virginia E.", "I have been here a couple of times and I always forgotten to write a reviw. I love this place not just because it is in my neighborhood walking distance but because the food and ambience is always awesome. The place itself is very big and dark. They are always busy so try to go early if you don't like to wait a little. There is space in the front to wait and there is also a bar as well. I have had the Village Steamed dumplings which is delicious. Anything dumplings I just love. I have also tried their Pad Thai Chicken and Shrip which is always good and vcan never go wrong. But what I absoutely ove love is their Classic Pork Chop which is so flavorful and delicious. Everything is a decent portion so I always leave with food home."], ["Sierra B.", "Highlights: -Great food for the price (though NOT ENOUGH RICE)-Strong $7 cocktails-Trendy ambiance-Great music selection, right volume-Ideal for early 20s birthday parties-Able to accommodate groupsSea looks like a trendy restaurant you would have seen on an episode of Sex and the City with its Thai sanctuary meets chic nightclub aesthetic. I can see it now, Samantha schmoozing with a wealthy client (or man), Carrie confronting a former lover and Miranda running off to field a call from work. Trance music plays in the back as models frolic about in v-shaped tube tops, blue eye shadow and chopsticks in their hair. This would be 1999, after all. While the ambiance at Sea still evokes this moment in history, 15+ years later this backdrop is partly stale. Initially you might feel like you're at Tao, albeit much cheaper -- and this is great -- but the feeling is short lived. Very quickly you'll notice that there's no models to ogle, or even hipsters; the cool factor has been lost at Sea. More on this:I've been coming to Sea since about 2007. Back then it was a popular place for people who thought they were in the know as Williamsburg was just starting to cement itself as New York City's ambassador of cool. It regularly took an hour to get a table on a Saturday evening. After several years, though, Billyburg has exploded with a million other hip eateries and enlightened ones generally feast elsewhere. While there's still a mixer of folks frequenting Sea, today you're likely to find many tourists and parties from less fashionable areas of the borough who seem awfully impressed with their patronage at this restaurant.Despite not being the epicenter of cool anymore, Sea still makes a great starting point for a night out in Williamsburg, a 21st birthday dinner (affordable for your friends still in school or making entry salary) or a first date -- though for me if you think you're impressing me by taking me to Sea I'd think you weren't up on your NYC venues. That's just me.The prices for both food and beverages seem to have stayed mostly the same. The menu at Sea is relatively extensive. I've never ordered something at Sea and didn't like it. The pork chop entree is one of my favorites. The chops are huge and flavorful, especially for the price. The basil chicken or shrimp is just the right amount of spicy and is a sizable portion. The pad Thai isn't the best in the world here. The appetizers are great. I love the calamari, especially the Thai marinara sauce that comes with it. My only complaint about the food is the little triangle of rice they give you. Yea, yea, it's cute and who should be eating all of that rice anyway, but with such ample portions of food it's annoying to have to ration out your rice. Rice is so cheap. More rice please!!In closing, I still enjoy my experience at Sea, even if it's not the faddy place is was a few years ago. The drinks are the right price. The food is consistently good. Service is attentive. You could come here and pre-game at the bar before heading elsewhere, too."], ["Sally W.", "Many years ago a coworker was raving about SEA. But from what I know about him, I had a feeling that he didn't know what good Thai food is but I was never sure, it was just a feeling. He doesn't know any Thai neighborhoods, never visited, doesn't know any real Thai restaurants and has not been to a restaurant full of people from Thailand. I felt safe to assume he would not really know good Thai food. Today I was at SEA to see if my hunch was correct...many years later. We came for lunch and was surprised to see a lunch menu. Yay, good start. With lunch, there is a complimentary appetizer with your dish. For appetizers, we tried the Crispy Basil Spring Roll and the Pork Chop Bun. The spring rolls were only barely okay. The only good thing about them is there were hot and crispy. The sauce was just too sweet. It was supposed to be a mustard lime sauce. I didn't taste mustard at all, just sweet. The meat in the pork chop bun was dry. The Mantou bun was not billowy, not warm and was not fluffy as it should be. It was too chewy and semi hard. It was not good. It was cold too. I was just hoping the entrees are better. For the entrees, we had the Pattaya Noodles, grilled pork chop and the crispy whole porgy fish. At first sight, it seemed okay until I looked closer. The fried porgy, still had scales on the skin. OMG. That is disgusting. The fried whole porgy dish is intended to be eaten with the skin on but the cooks left the scales on. This is just pure carelessness. In a restaurant where the customer is paying extra for service, the cooks should always clean and descale before cooking the fish that is intended to be served to the customer. Ugh. I was disgusted by it. I never saw a fish being served at a restaurant with scales still all over. I was comparing it to serving chicken with the feathers still on the chicken.The Pattaya Noodles with crispy pork belly was way too sweet. It had no acidic notes at all. It was pretty much an uninteresting dish. \u00a0I have had better versions of this dish. The grill pork chop was too sweet too. I wish it has more of the grilled taste to counter the too sweet notes in the dish. The rice was hard and cold. It tasted like the rice was sitting on the counter too long so it got cold and hard. I finally tried SEA and was not too impressed. There are a crazy amount of high marks for this restaurant and IMHO this restaurant doesn't deserve it from the food we tasted today. This restaurant is all hype and they didn't deliver dishes to match their hype at all. Even the furniture that people are so impressed by...it looks shabby now. they need to clean up their water fountain floor. Maybe it's the color of the tiles or the floor in the fountain needs to be cleaned up or maybe it needs new tiles. The furniture is starting to look old and shabby too. The back of the chairs on the sides look damaged or wearing away. The best thing in this restaurant is the skylight with natural light coming in. If only the skylight was bigger. I do not want to come back here after the food experience we had today. Blech. I'm going to stick to going to Elmhurst for much better Thai food. I can't believe this is what people like."], ["Bianka M.", "I LOVE SEA the ambiance the food the location (basically THIS location BK stand up).My first visit to SEA was on a DateNight with my hubby while visiting with his family in NYC. We sat next to the pool/pond/SEA (LoL) and was greeted by the efficient server who made some amazing suggestions for our dinner which we took into account and tried several items.We had the Martini crispy shrimp, chicken spring rolls and some spicy chicken skewers. Everything was flavorful and the ambiance was EVERYTHING.As we waited to be seated I was able to snag a seat in the swings which is pretty cool as I sipped my GreyGoose Cosmo I slowly shifted back and forth in the swing.Okay back to the food. We also had the curry shrimp pad Thai and the drunken man noodles. Both were great dishes that were full for flavor. For dessert we had fried banana with vanilla ice cream which was GOOD.All in all this place is great and the only reason I won't give it 5 stars is because I've been several times and the inconsistencies in service and the lack there of takes away from the overall experience."], ["Jasmine C.", "The place is beautiful and its huge. Came here for my birthday dinner with the family. Waiting for a table took about 20 minutes. Honestly it was really loud, it's more of a hangout spot than somewhere you would go for a special occasion. Also, it's really weird because when you go use the bathroom they have a small television in there which is linked to their security camera LOL. The food wasn't as I expected. The appetizers came really fast, like everything came out in less than 5 minutes of us placing our order. The fried calamari was okay and the sauce tasted a bit weird. The Tup Tim Fritters were pretty good and so were the Sea Chicken Wings. The Grilled Beef wasn't that good, it look/taste like it's been out for a while. The Tom Yum soup were good though, so definitely recommend that and it's inexpensive too. We got the Drunk Man Noodle and I think the KL Chicken (?). Both entrees were pretty good."], ["Lili R.", "I love this place! I have been a faithful client for over 5 years. It is among one of the prettiest Thai restaurants I've visited.

I also tried the calamari but none of the sushi. I will try it next time.I do have a few cons - super long wait, mediocre drinks, very loud music. The service is pretty good - the servers always appear rushed but it makes sense b/c they are always super busy.Sea will continue to be one of my go-to date spots!"], ["Alexandra K.", "Overall, pretty disappointing. I came here for a small birthday dinner, we were a group of 6 people. Very clubby atmosphere, with flashing, colorful lights and loud dance music. Not bad for happy hour, with $3 beers, $4 rails and $6 on selected cocktails. My friends enjoyed the mojito, but don't get the strawberry guava martini, it just tastes like really sweet strawberry juice with vodka.The food was the most underwhelming part. The emerald dumplings had too thick, flavorless wrappers and the filling didn't really taste like anything. I think the plum sauce and minced garlic bath that they came in is supposed to provide all the flavor, but it didn't work for me. My husband ordered pattaya noodles but they brought him pad thai instead, and I got the pan woo sen, where the only flavor that came through was sweet. My friends who got curries seemed to be more pleased with their choices, so if you're going to order here curry is a better choice than noodles.

However, after reading Yelp reviews and getting feedback from the bartender, we ended up ordering and deciding that Khao Sarn is the best Thai in the city. Let me just say that the rice is perfect. We got red curry with vegetables and masaman curry with tofu, both of which were outstanding, and even better with the chewy but not hard, perfectl fluffy and sticky rice. The masaman curry was definitely the best I have ever had - something about the richness of the sauce without being overwhelming... both of us insisted that we wouldn't finish our dishes, and then proceeded to devour every last morcel. I have been looking for an awesome Thai place since I moved away from Clinton Hill - and as much as I love Myrtle Thai, Khao Sarn blows them outta the water times like ninety bajillion.

Keep in mind, this soup isn't even listed on the menu.Penang curry - $9 - 3/5 - Just ok. I've certainly had better. Wouldn't go out of my way to order this again.Massaman curry - $9 -2/5 What just happened?!?! The massaman curry just tasted like straight black licorice. And that's a serious shame, considering that if it didn't have star anise thrown into it (why the heck is that in a curry?!) that it would've actually been decent - dare I say, delicious! But the anise ruined everything. All the flavors were off, and it couldn't have tasted less Thai. Real shame. Pad thai - $9 - 3/5 - needed lime, but otherwise very tasty. Not overly sweet - not overly anything, really. Just a really solid pad thai. Could've used bean sprouts, definitely, and VERY much lacking on the lime, but definitely enough peanuts. And tasted very solid, all things considered - especially when I added my own lime juice.Crispy crab rolls - $6 - 2/5 - I didn't have any, but my boyfriend described them as \"bland\" and \"soggy\". Had no real crab flavor whatsoever. Definitely wouldn't order again.Mee grab - $8 2/5 - Crispy. Noodles were ok, but there were 2 shrimp for the entire dish. Upon tasting the shrimp, I could completely understand the dynamic between the shrimp and the noodles, and how the flavors would play off each other. But with only 1 shrimp, and 95% fried noodles, I felt there was honestly no opportunity to experience what the mee grab had to offer. If there were enough shrimp with every bite to counter the flavor of the fried noodles, this would have the possibility of being a 4 star dish. But it just wasn't well made. At all.Pad see you - $9 - 4/5. Delicious. Second best dish of the night to the Tom Kha soup. Flavorful, well made. Honestly, no words. Just delicious. Highly recommended!Bottom line - of the 7 items we ordered, and considering we dropped over $50 for this, I was expecting a lot more than what we got. Of our various dishes, the only things I'd consider ordering again from this location are the tom kha soup (which was fantastic), the pad thai - which was solid, and the pad see you, which also was very tasty. Other than that, I'd sadly skip everything else. There really is a lack of quality Thai food in Brooklyn, and it's a damn shame, but contrary to other reviews, and considering I ordered EVERYTHING I ever enjoy from a Thai joint - this place just doesn't stack up, and that disappoints me immensely.
