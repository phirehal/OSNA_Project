We ordered two portions, one grilled and one fried to go, since we wanted to stay at home. When we sat down to eat, the first thing that surprised us was how tiny the portions were. The grilled calmari, were absolutely charred and inedible. Burned black and bitter tasting. The ones that were not burned were rubbery and way overdone. We set the grilled aside and moved on to the fried. Unfortunately, these were overdone too and nearly as tough as the burned grilled version. If there is one thing you can do wrong with squid, it would be to overcook it. I called up the restaurant and spoke with the same lady that took our order, Anna. She started to speak to me in Russian and preceded to explain to me that the grilled calamari were not burned and that was the way they were supposed to come. I asked her if I could take a photo and send it to her phone. She said she would like to see it. I did, after which point I called back. She received the photo and told me that it didn't look burned to her. I tried to explain to her, they were burned black to the point of bitterness, at which point she tried to convince me they were not bitter. She offered to exchange the grilled calamari for another portion of fried, this is when I told her the fried calamari were overdone and very tough. At this point she really got upset and told me she has never got any complaints about their calmari, grilled or fried and hung up the phone. My understanding, Anna runs the place. I'm not sure what is Greek about this place. I'm greek myself and certainly this is not typical of greek hospitality. The service, the food, portion size, all have nothing to do with Greek cuisine.

In either case my date ordered a shrimp scampi and I decided to try 1 out of 5 meat dishes and went with grilled lamb chops. Although well prepared, it took about 30 minutes for us to get the order and I ran our of water before the food was out.

The Greek salad was mainly romaine lettuce with a few cherry tomato, two rounds of peppers and cucumbers and 3 cubes of feta. The dressing was nonexistent so I asked for some additional vinaigrette to make it palatable.

Great lemon flavor, scallops cooked perfectly and good bitterness from the arugula. Although I wouldn't have picked it, the server recommended the shrimp in tomato sauce that was epic.

Would definitely come again, but would try different dishes"], ["Persila N.", "I wanted to have a good meal while I was on vacation in NYC and Pylos did not disappoint. \u00a0My friend and I both ordered a nice red wine that the waitress recommended to start. \u00a0We ordered the moussaka, some phylo pastries stuffed with cheese, and indulged on the complimentary pita bread and yummy dip that was perfectly seasoned. \u00a0We also ended up ordering dessert, which was a chocolate mousse which was decadent and thick. \u00a0Perfect for 2-3 people to share! \u00a0The ambience in Pylos was fantastic \u00a0with nice mood lighting and mirrors everywhere giving the illusion that it was very spacious. \u00a0The wait staff was very attentive and I was very pleased with the experience. \u00a0I would recommend getting a reservation in advance though on weekend nights, because it can book up quickly. \u00a0I made mine on the same day conveniently."], ["It's Large Marge ..", "I rarely give good reviews, because honestly I'm not that impressed by a lot of restaurants in NYC. I'm a nobody, but I know a good place when I find one and I absolutely love this restaurant.

And the best part, it's right across the street from Big Gay Ice Cream, which is perfect for desserts."], ["F H.", "Great atmosphere, date spot mainly, make a reservation. Free pita and dip when you arrive, and we ordered the Trio appetizer. For two it was too much. We had the Greek salad which were amazing, just like they do it in greece. The meat sausage for appetizer was ok, 6 outta 10.The reason 4 stars was the service, it was slow."], ["Nick C.", "We managed to stumble upon Pylos and were more than impressed with our meal. The place was jam packed leaving us the only two spotter at the bar. A table would have been a bit more intimate, but we still enjoyed the experience.They only had wine and a small selection of beers which was a bit disappointing. We were hoping for cocktails but made due with the wine selection made by our congenial Greek server. We had an assortment of appetizers including champagne avgolemono which my fianc\u00e9 who is Greek and a champagne enthusiast loved as well as a beet salad. The salad was your requisite beet salad that every restaurant now has, but good nonetheless. We had a few small plates including the sea scallops with white beans and arugula as well as the marinated octopus. Both were well presented and tasty. We both decided to share one main entr\u00e9e dish considering the quantity of small dishes we had consumed. We settled on the grilled whole fish with olive oil and lemon. It was exceptional in its unadulterated preparation. We were more than happy with our find and had an exceptional Greek dinner that proved to be authentic yet a bit more progressive in its offerings. We would certainly recommend it."], ["T T.", "Good food and fast service. I had Pistachio crusted seabass fillet and really liked it. My friend had lamb shank and its very tender and tasty as well. The portion is large. We went on a weekday and needed a reservation because the place is pretty busy."], ["D. R.", "I love this place. I always get the Saganaki and Greek Salad to start, and then dive into the Bronzino. The lemon & olive oil sauce for it is so delicious. So simple, but when I try to make it at home it never comes out quite as good. The octopus appetizer is also delicious. Great for spot to take a date \u00a0or a prelude to girls night out."], ["Joanna N.", "I've been to Pylos once years ago and had a good experience. With just so many places to try in the city, repeat visits don't often happen. Totally regretting that for this place though. My girlfriend wanted to come here for her birthday dinner and of course we all happily obliged. It ended up being an incredible meal from start to finish and so much more amazing than I remembered! !The restaurant is pretty tight and narrow but classy, simple and beautiful, with a ceiling adorned with clay pots. Perfect for any occasion. Reservations definitely necessary though. We were provided with piping hot pita bread with this wonderful chickpea, lentil dip to start. Ugh, I could have eaten the whole plate myself. Serving it hot makes all the difference! The dip was also incredible and something I'd buy by the jar, if offered. We ended up going through two plates amongst the four of us.For apps, we split a bunch -- octopus, grape leaves, light as air meatballs, and a pear and arugula salad. These were incredible starters and I enjoyed every single one of them. The octopus was so, so tender and had just the right level of acidity from the balsamic. The grape leaves were stuffed with well seasoned ground veal and had a nice nutty flavor from the pine nuts but I could have done without the lemon sauce. The meatballs contained the perfect blend of slices and were some of the best I've ever had. They were indeed light as air! And the salad? Also one of the best salads ever. I couldn't get enough of it. The incredible balsamic honey vinaigrette coated the arugula lightly and it was so, so good with the generous amount of pistachios, pear and sheep's milk cheese. I could eat this everyday! For entrees, we split the lamb shank, pistachio crusted stripe bass and the moussaka. The moussaka was the least memorable -- I found it to be too mushy. The other two were solid though. The lamb was fall off the bone tender and had an addicting accompanying bean and garlic puree. The bass was cooked well with an equally amazing accompanying chard and spinach mixture to provide more flavor. So good. At this point, we could barely move but the desserts seemed light enough, hha. We had the custard filled phyllo triangles(so crisp!) and the Greek yogurt+cream custard(so creamy!). Both desserts were indeed very light and the perfect end to the meal. If I had to redo this meal, I'd order the exact same dishes. \u00a0Everything was incredible and I will be returning again sooner than later."], ["Valerie L.", "Pylos was a delicious and classy affair. With such stellar ratings (4.5 rating for 700+ reviews is simply incredible), I had soaring expectations, and for the most part, they were met. Everything we ate (see below for details) was great, but I'm holding back one star because some dishes didn't knock it out of the park for me...and there were too many cheese/potato items on the menu that just didn't excite me.My group of 5 ordered the following:- Phyllo pastries (enjoyed this, the phyllo came out piping hot / perfectly crispy)- Haloumi cheese (good but not mind-blowing)- Grilled octopus (aside from the capers, which I loathe, I loved this dish and the balsamic reduction was perfect)- Pear and arugula salad (surprisingly the best salad ever!)- Artichoke moussaka (this was OK - a bit too similar to an artichoke lasagna)- Shrimp and sea scallops over egg noodles (very, very good - must order!)- Lamb chops (perfect)I liked being able to sample their popular appetizers as well as a few of the entrees, which were both amazing. The lamb chops were perfect, and I loved the pasta more than I expected! Those were some of the biggest, juiciest scallops I've ever had, and the flavors went so well together. If I ever come back, I might just order the pasta for myself.This is definitely a place to impress a date or guest. The seating is really comfortable. As expected, it's on the pricier side (entrees range from $25-30) and you'll likely drop at least $50 per person."], ["Rena Y.", "Delicious Greek fare! Yummy Greek food in a modern, artsy setting. The decor is very neat - it's not like the much too common blue and white cafe decor that so many Greek restaurants embrace. The clay pots hung from the ceiling are quite beautiful to look at and I enjoyed how the bar was designed. The line between \"bartender\" or \"bar\" and \"customer\" is obscure, creating a sense of inclusiveness and casualness to that particular of the restaurant which is quite neat.Tips:Order family style. Bring as many friends as you can to dine with you so you can try a bit of everything!I dined with several, authentic Greek people and they too agree Pylos is authentic and delicious. I enjoyed the desserts but the same people claimed that the desserts are less authentic (Yoghurt dessert in their opinion should have had more honey, etc,) but tasty nonetheless."], ["Denise M.", "This is one of my favorite neighborhood restaurants in NYC. \u00a0I ate here all the time when I lived in the East Village. \u00a0I still eat here whenever I'm in NY. \u00a0I wish you could find Greek food like this in LA, but you can't. \u00a0The grilled octopus is always fresh and perfectly cooked. \u00a0The mousaka is hearty and rich. \u00a0The lamb shank is devine if you are up for the challenge because it's a big dish! \u00a0Bring some friend with you so you can order all the starters. \u00a0The Greek salad is so good, but the 3 cheese dip and the trio of dipping sauces are a must order. \u00a0Their taramosalata is the best I've ever had, and the only taramosalata I'll eat. \u00a0The shrimp pasta in ouzo and tomato cream sauce is delicious too, if pasta is your thing."], ["Mick A.", "Our best dining experience at this fine restaurant.....it was a wonderful night for the four of us.The Polish server lady (S-Pallina) was one of the best we have had the privilege of being served by in NYC. Her wine knowledge was good and so too, her explanation of each of the dishes. It is such a pleasant experience when one has a smiling, accommodating and knowledge server, and we sure did!Wonderful night and great food...I have only one minor anxiety when I visit is how the reservation process works. One calls however on the last two occasions we have had no follow up. We have come a long way and one's heart is in your mouth hoping all is ok.....would be great if there was an online facility.

Okay fine, I haven't been to many, but this was amazing... from what I can recall from 2011. I loved that they had their own sommelier who actually knew a thing or two about wine.

Me and my friend were excited to get a last minute reservation for Friday during prime time hours :)The decor was cute and elegant. You can either sit near the windows and people watch or sit inside where there are coozy booth settings. the waiters are attentive and food is served pretty quickly. We ordered 4 apps + 1 entree : grilled octopus, grape leaves, 3 types of hummus, salmon cakes and short ribs. (All for about ~$80) This place tastes a lot better than taverna kyclades (especially when you don't have to wait 2 hours for a table). Everything we ordered was yummy especially the short rib. It was cooked to perfection. The meat fell off the bone as soon as I dug my fork into it. the grilled octopus was just right. omg and the sauce that came with the salmon cakes was amazing.

To start off, the staff was really nice and accommodating to our original party of 10, which unexpectedly became a party of 13. \u00a0The other thing that initially awed me was the decor and ambiance: the place was beautifully lined with pots on the ceiling, and I just loved how everything looked and felt!

The interior was very nicely decorated with the pretty clay pots on the ceiling and the cool looking 'community' table in the center. The service was friendly and very helpful with both the wine list and the food menu. The pita/hummus they give you is really good. Fresh pita, homemade hummus - excellent! The octopus appetizer was really good - the octopus was soft and the balsamic sauce made it really tasty. I had the branzino , which was one of the daily fishes. It was cooked perfectly, served with a delicate lemony sauce on the side and filetted for me (helpful!). Also had a side of dandelion greens with feta, which were pretty good. My parents had the salmon and the bass, both of which got a thumbs up from them. My dad really liked the chickpea soup as well, which had a bit of spice in it. Dessert was excellent. Chocolate mousse and the little flaky pastries filled with custard and honey were fantastic. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes Greek food. It would also be a good date spot, as it's dimly lit and not too loud."], ["Peter R.", "The food was good but not great. The wine selection was good and at a good price. The service was great. The atmosphere was lively and energetic. Food: we started with the poilio. It was 3 sauces/dips with bread. There was a taziki, an eggplant and a fish roe dip. None of them impressed. They just seemed too simple and bland. For our entrees, we had the lamb shank and the pistachio crusted stripe bass. Both were meh. Fish was a little fishy, and lamb shank was a little fattier and less tender than I'm accustomed to. Wine: pretty good selection of affordable Greek wine. We had a good cab sauv blend for $45. Service: excellent. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. My fianc\u00e9 was not enjoying her side dish with the fish (they had to modify it because she's lactose intolerant) so the waitress discussed with the chef and offered an alternative, which she loved.

The greeters were a bit rude and full of false hope as they kept telling us - \"15 more minutes\" which turned into triple that time. But, our actual waitress( and I wish I remembered her name) was absolutely great! She is truly the definition of what \"good service\" should be - attentive, knowledgeable, kind hearted, and simply honest. She gave her recommendations and when we inquired about something on the menu, she gave us a full breakdown on it with her very own opinion.Now, let me dive into the yummy in my tummy portion...For an appetizer, we ordered the grilled octopus which was good, but I expected more due to the raving reviews I read. I'm a huge fan of grilled octopus and tasted many, but this one wasn't anything to write home about for me.The Greek salad - amazing! It was just fresh and the dressing mixed with the herbs was a great complement.For my entree, I had the Moussaka which is layers of \u00a0sauteed eggplant, zucchini and potato baked in a clay dish with \u00a0ground meat sauce and bechamel. When I tell you, it was one of the best things I've ever eaten, just simply mouthwatering! I think I could have that dish everyday and not get tired of it!

I ordered Lamp chops after seeing so many photos posted by other yelpers and also because i love lamb meat personally. Though the lamb chops somewhere between average to good in taste but not worth the price you pay for it, $25 is not worth it. I don't mind paying for top notch quality food but I jus feel this one is not worth paying so much. I have eaten better lamb chops.

It did have some fat and gristle on it but made for good taste. I had mine medium rare but will get medium next time. A little too red for me but because of the high quality of meat I was still able to eat it. The veggies (seasonal greens) that come with the steak were delicious and in a rich buttery sauce. The patatas were kind of a let down after all the yummy we tasted. They were just seasoned French fries. Oh forgot to mention they bring you warm bread and fresh olives and olive oil. It was delicious and I believe I could have drank the olive oil by itself! Lol very smooth and buttery. We finished off dinner with Baklava for dessert.

Given that Bay Ridge is fortunate to have more than its share of great restaurants, this would put it in the top 3 that we frequent.The menu (and staff!) has remained consistent over this time, though there have been some subtle changes over the course of time. For a first-time visitor I recommend trying out the different flavors tapas-style -- favoring a lot of the appetizers over just one main course each. This will give you a really good idea of what the place is about.The reason I shaved off one star is simply because they have remodeled over the past spring, and I'm not a fan of either the new paint job, or especially the new lighting. I think they've gone eco (which I totally approve of) but they've chosen the wrong kind of LEDs. The lighting is very brash and cold -- evoking more of a gymnasium/DMV office feel than a cozy restaurant.

Bartender was helpful and attentive with menu. I ordered the hanger steak and wasn't in the mood for alcohol, so I stuck to water. Pricing would be standard for Manhattan restaurants, bit pricey for this area. My plate arrived and I do have to admit, it was tasty for a hanger.

The food has improved (thank god) but improved still doesn't mean it is good enough to go here considering the high prices, instead of one of the other abundant restaurants with better food, at a lower price with a better experience. Williamsburg is restaurant central and being from Queens I am used to eating lower quality food there vs the city. Brooklyn and Manhattan are the top two by far, with MP Taverna being like a Queens restaurant. It is what it is. Another neighborhood it works fine. Here, for Williamsburg pricing, you need your A game. Service was ok. It was hard for the server to hide their attempt during every sentence to upsell, upcharge, sell more drinks, or otherwise increase the money you were spending. It got really annoying halfway through the latest dinner. The octopus isn't very good and needs improvement. The decor is tacky, an I'll fated attempt at creating something trendy but it is bearable. Overall the place has issues that need to be addressed before I come back again. I won't be back for at least 6 months and I live down the block. New place, three strikes you're out."], ["Matthew S.", "Went here opening week. Really great food. I feel like there aren't that many good places to get traditional Greek food and this feels like the classics with some modern twists.

However, our second visit was disappointing. On a rather slow Sunday night, the service was very very bad. Our server appeared like she was high and did not know the wine list at all. She was supported by another person (I assume he was a manager of some sort) at times but even the two of them couldn't provide a pleasant service to our 7-person group properly. For instance, it took us 3 attempts to order another bottle of our wine which eventually made it to our table in almost half an hour. Despite the fact that we asked them to remove empty plates, no one bothered to do so. We stacked our appetizer plates on top of each other and even that sat on the table for a long time. They even mixed up food orders. Something was terribly off that night. This bad service required a 1-star but the food was once again exceptional and deserves a 5-star, hence my rating for this visit."], ["AL B.", "I was a big fan o Kefi already so I was very pleased to see his new spot in my hood.

We ordered three appetizers instead of entrees, which was perfect, since the appetizers are delicious and pretty big (and we got to try more).

First of all, they recommend you eat everything family style, and the prices for the amount you get are incredible. We spent only $115 on food for three people and had SO MANY leftovers. We could have probably ordered two fewer dishes and been full. We started with the dip combo which was outstanding. They serve it with more than enough warm pita and generous amounts of each of the four dips. The taramasalata is my favorite but they are all delicious. Our server, Dan, recommended the octopus to start and it was the most tender octopus any of us had ever had. Thanks Dan. For the entree course we shared the paella and the mixed grill (chef recommends med rare) and a side of the mushrooms and peas. Everything was fantastic. The homemade merguez was in the paella and the mixed grill. The paella also had mussels, clams and jumbo shrimp. We are all a fan of spice, but it may be a bit on the spicy side if you are not. The mixed grill also had lamb chops and hanger steak (I think both of these dishes vary by day / season), both of which were cooked perfectly and seasoned well. We shared a bottle of wine-- lots of choices in all price ranges. By the time dessert came we were way too full, and we had tons of leftovers to take home.

The atmosphere is inviting with friendly servers. \u00a0I had the eggs Benedict and my friend tried out the Israeli breakfast. We switched plates midway and I must say that I enjoyed both meals fairly well. Wish they had bottomless mimosas though which would have made it perfect.

My husband and I eat at Miriam's maybe once every 4-5 weeks or so. The food is always great, the service can be hit or miss. Today it was better than usual. We were told it would be a 15 minute wait; it was more like 5. We sat and looked at the menu for a while; it took our waitress around 8 minutes to take a drink order, but then she was back pretty quickly with our drinks and to take our order. I got the potato pancakes and poached eggs, my husband the eggs over in a croissant, dad got the French toast, and my stepmom got the falafel platter. It took over 20 minutes for our food to come out; I was surprised that they did not bring out pita for everyone to nosh on while we waited. However, when the food did come out, it was worth the wait. My eggs were poached perfectly; Hubby was very happy with his egg sandwich; Dad cleaned his plate, and my stepmom raved about the falafel and sampled the lebneh that came with my latke to her delight (she then ate half of it!). My complaint is the one I usually have about Miriam's--the service is a little on the slow side and they can be a bit inattentive. They don't notice when you need water until you've been waiting for a while or that you need napkins.

Brunch was phenomenal: burekas, Mediterranean crispy dough, and decent coffee. The spicy salsa-type sauce added even more flavor to the crispy dough, and the labneh cheese was a refreshing complement to the eggs and Israeli salad. Large portions and a fair price, slightly higher but worth it and on-par for Brooklyn. Service could have been a little faster for drink refills, but the staff was friendly.

Simple, bland, creamy and since I still prefer chunky hummus, it was okay. Lebanese roasted eggplant - mashed eggplant with diced beets. This was a great twist to the usual hummus spread for the pita bread. The beets paired well with the mashed eggplant creating a chunky spread and the mixture is just pure genius! Falafel - these tiny balls are crispy on the outside, soft and flavorful on the inside. This texture distinctly signals your tongue to alert your brain that it's fresh. Dip it with the sauce provided and you have a good falafel. The only downside is the amount of salt it has, after two pieces, it was salty. Baklava - dry and very sweet; they used too much white sugar! Desserts with this pure sugar taste upsets my taste receptors. The pita bread was grilled! This is how all pita bread should be served; warm with grilled marks."]], "Faros Restaurant": [["Michael C.", "Another excellent meal. \u00a0The mussels, though small, were perfectly flavored with tomato and feta. \u00a0Pasticchio remains crusty and creamy and delicious.

Fried, but surprisingly light, they prepare your palette for the bold flavors of your entree. By bold, I am referring to the moussaka with ground beef. Laden with potatoes, eggplant, and cheese, this dish is heavenly indulgent but worth it. Try not to let the layer of oil that has accumulated on the bottom make you regret this dish, you and I both know you'd do it again. If you favor something lighter, yet still delicious and authentic, go for the spanakopita (spinach pie)--flaky and light(er), it would make a good meal for one, or an appetizer for two.

I know it's Park Slope and some nights are busier than others, to the point of confusion but if Faros was in the city, I don't think there would be a chance of getting a seat here during the weekend. Since I had such a great experience here with very few complaints (the complaints I do have are only for the sake of adding some realism to the review and I don't think they are truly even valid as much as nitpicking), I will provide a categorical breakdown, which I rarely do. It's usually more effort than its worth. Interior : Classic, romantic, and overall pleasant. It truly does have a very authentic Greek feel to it which is accented by lanterns, assorted wine racks throughout the restaurant, and floor lamps blended with the dim lighting that makes you want to slow the experience down.Service : Flawless service. We had a large party of about 20 and we went about ordering in a very confusing way; our waiter was professional, courteous and pleasant. Food is where Faros impressed me with every plate that hit the table had something new and different to it. Turkish food is on the rise in my area and I feel like there's one of those spots springing up on every block. Since there is some culinary overlap between the Greek and Turkish cultures, this was refreshing beyond words. Even the hummus felt homemade; chunky and rich texture at the same time that you won't see every day. I never order spinach pie in \u00a0restaurant because I'm stubborn and I believe that no spinach pie can outdo my grandma's. However, I tried a piece from my friend's plate and had to ask for more. So make sure to try the spinokapita (spinach pie). Mussels made for a delicious appetizer as well. My entree was the arni yiouvetsi which is shredded lamb with red sauce mixed into orzo. I was full halfway through the meal but kept going until I hated myself, because this was one dish that was very hard to step away from. Girlfriend had the lamb chops done to a perfect medium. There is a pretty extensive wine list, and a few great drafts including Blue Point Toasted Lager , which I have loved for 4 years now and see a lot of bars drop it for its 'mainstream' status (as compared to what) but it makes for a delicious dinner-time beer so Faros scored big on that with me. I believe there were two more craft-like options and a Sam Adams available as well. I want to go back right now."], ["Marina S.", "YUM! This is the ideal Greek spot. So many Greek restaurants unfortunately are not my top choice for dining because the food is sometimes lacking, but NOT HERE. 1. Spicy hummus and pita was so flavorful yet light. 2. The Moussaka was so hearty and delicious, I only had a bite from the boyfriend's plate but I wish I had more.3. Mosharaki Kokkinisto (spiced cubes of filet mignon over pasta): A+ does not do it justice.The staff was so accommodating and polite, it felt like we were dining among friends.

Specially the pan fried kefalograviera cheese. I have no idea why this place is not busier. Give it a chance! Great food and very nice ambiance."], ["Alexandra K.", "I can only add to the glowing reviews here for Faros, because my dinner here last night was reminiscent of great Greek home cooking, which is one of the highest compliments I can give to a rustic-style Greek restaurant like this one. I loved the decor; warm exposed brick, fireplaces, dim romantic lighting. Add to that a glass of the surprisingly good, Merlot-esque Kouros red, and I was primed for a great dining experience. I followed the recommendations and ordered a small horiatiki salad, a pikilia (selection of Greek spreads served with warm pita and a lettuce chiffonade), and the oktapodi skaras. I shared these with my cousin, who also ordered the keftedes for herself, and everything was both delicious and satisfying. With the check, the waiter brought out two shooter glasses of what I'm almost positive was rakomelo (a really good one too, extremely smooth). The service overall was great, the waiters very cordial and attentive. One of the nicest Greek restaurants I've been to in New York in a long time for sure."], ["Maria Felisa S.", "I chose Faros for my friend's birthday treat for me and we ordered the appetizer sample, the Greek salad, moussaka and grilled bronzino and every bite was exceptionally delicious and authentic!!!

The boss is a cheap mofo who thinks that its okay to hire a seventeen year old girl and pay her almost absolutely nothing. I worked here for 3 weeks- before getting taken off the schedule and hearing from my friend who also works here that I was no longer needed. I got paid tips, and that was all. I was not added onto the payroll at all, and haven't received any of the money I was supposed to get. I got completely taken advantage of and lied to as well. When the ice machine broke down the boss was too cheap to go and buy a few bags of ice. Everything is a dictatorship in this restaurant. They are definitely racist and sexist. I got paid the least amount of money because I was the only busgirl and the boss figured that I mattered the least. They were going to fire another busboy because he didn't speak much English. I came in two days before he did and he got added to the payroll because he is a hardworking hispanic male who will do whatever he can do to make the money he needs, meanwhile getting paid very little. I am never coming back to this restaurant.

Given the rave reviews, I expected the food to be out of this world. It was, instead, a mixed bag. The dips were delicious (tarama and spicy feta), but my baby lamb chops, very pricey, had little flavor. I was really surprised: also, the lamb chops were miniscule: 1 bite per chop. So, about 6 bites for $29! A little steep! The potatoes were soggy. However, my son's dish of shrimp in tomato sauce over pasta was delicious according to him. So, mixed bag. The service was outstanding, though. Our waiter was attentive and gracious. I will definitely try again, but would like them to improve their consistency."], ["Yael M.", "About 2 years ago, I was supposed to take a trip to Greece. Unfortunately because of personal reasons and the economic situation there, the trip had to be canceled, but there's something about Greek culture, especially food, that continues to call to me. So when Faros, a Greek restaurant in Park Slope, invited me for a tasting, I obviously said yes.As a blogger, I go to a lot of tastings and they are usually all pretty good. The waiters are polite, the wine is delicious and the food never seems to stop coming. But at Faros, the ante was upped. We were greeted by one of the most friendly waitresses I've ever encountered (and not in a creepy way but in a \"welcome to my grandma's house, make yourself comfortable\" kind of way).We were seated right in the front of the rather large restaurant (it has 2 stories!), which was nice because we could people watch out the window. The host/manager brought us a nice bottle of 2006 Greek wine from the Moraitis Winery in Paros, and it perfectly complemented just about everything we ordered. Also, to whet our appetite, they brought us delicious fresh bread with olives and a fava bean puree.Then it was on to the real appetizers. Let me just say that Faros will not short you on food. We ordered two appetizers to get a feel for the menu, but I would definitely not recommend ordering more than one for your party of two. The cold appetizer we ordered was Taramosalata ($5), fish roe mousse with lemon and onions. It reminded me a lot of lox spread but it was served with delicious pita. The hot appetizer we got was Saganaki ($8), which they claim is classic baked Kefalograriera cheese, but who are they kidding? It's pan fried and comes to the table with flames as high as the waiter. A pretty amazing sight to see, but to be honest, I only could eat a few bites of this. It's a giant platter of fried cheese, and while it was delicious and gluttonous, more than a few bites would have done me in.Next it was time for the mains. Because I can't resist a good branzino, we ordered the fish special for the night ($20-$25) served whole with garlic, lemon, and capers. There's something about good olive oil that makes all the difference. We also went with a classic Greek comfort food, Spitikos Mousakas ($15), layered with potatoes, eggplant, zucchini, ground sirloin and luscious b\u00e9chamel sauce. If you want to go for a traditional, amazing, yet very filling dish, this is it my friend.At this point, we were stuffed to the brink. However, in the way that only your Greek family would, our waitress insisted that we at least try dessert. And you can't get more Greek than baklava. Sticky and sweet like it should be, this was the perfect way to cap of a perfect meal.So though I'm still longing to hop on a plane and visit the whitewashed, sea cliff villages where this cuisine originated myself, I'm content hopping on the 2/3 to Grand Army Plaza and getting my fix at Faros."], ["Alex L.", "This is a great restaurant that opened some point in the past year, and for a while would always seem empty because you couldn't see anybody. It's popularity is definitely starting to catch on, and for good reason. Wine menu is good, food and service is great. Atmosphere is awesome. They have a few solid beers to pick from if someone in your group isn't feeling wine on a particular night.The seafood is particularly good, and I really enjoy the desserts generally (I've had a few and they're all great, one of the waiters was telling me that they sell them to other restaurants too, which I'm guessing is a vote of confidence from those establishments as well). Whenever I have guests in town I suggest this place as it is awesome.The place is huge, honestly probably the biggest restaurant in Park Slope, they have an upstairs, that I imagine could be rented out to groups, although I haven't actually tried myself.

This was my first time here. I knew from the start I should have just walked out when the little bean dip they brought out with the cheap white bread tasted moldy.

Maybe canned, maybe frozen for a long period of time but NOT fresh, as the menu states. The rest of the meal was uneventful. Nothing to specifically complain about, but far below par for the price.

The food was very salty, and the portions for the assorted appetizer dish were very small, considering it was hummus and roasted peppers. The spinach pie portion was large, but Mr. Falafel's spinach pie further down 7th is much better made. The lamb shank was well cooked, but I was not impressed with the meat or the flavoring. The dessert was covered with sugar syrup (not real Greek honey), so the galaktoboureko I had tasted just like dominos, no other flavor came through. The greek wines were good quality, in the end we spent about $100 per person. Maybe a good place to go for a date because of the ambiance and friendly staff, but the food is overrated."], ["Howard I.", "Friendly service, reasonably efficient. But the food was largely undistinguished. The best thing was a whole grilled branzino, which was fresh and not overcooked, although I was not impressed with the lemon-caper sauce it came already slathered with.

The spanakopita, chicken souvlaki, lemon potatoes, Greek fries, and fried shark were all flavorful and well-prepared. Huge highlight was dessert on the house (I think it was galaktoboureko) which was a light and tasty end to a filling meal. Drawbacks: somewhat inevitable garlic breath (worth it), very loud/not great acoustics in left-side dining room (especially when a raucous party of 9 decided to come celebrate a birthday; see above re: my elderly nature) Will definitely be returning.

I knew that I would've had to come to this place to satisfy that craving, especially since I was in the area, there was no excuse. Aside from Christos Steakhouse in Astoria, the next best plate of Greek Octopus is at Taverna. For starters, I had three small pieces of beautifully toasted bread, drizzled with olive oil and dashes of seasoning. Sigh, I was savoring how beautifully toasted it was. I ordered my octopus and lemon potatoes - just what I needed. Everything was delicious - no complaints but I did feel that the octopus could have been better saut\u00e9ed in its heavenly dressing. The octopus came out uncut, which was fine, but only the outside of the tentacles had that marvelous taste. Lemon potatoes were spot on, yum. The other downside was the price. Taverna in Astoria is so much more reasonably priced. I mean, I get it, it's in the city and it should be pricer, but does it really have to be? My waiter was great, I didn't catch his name but he was on his game and was super attentive! For the complimentary dessert, I had blueberry Greek yogurt. This surprised me because I was used to the other dessert (name escapes me right now). The waiter explained that there is a different complimentary dessert during lunch versus dinner. Yogurt was also yummy yummy."], ["Richard K.", "How lucky am I that my favorite Greek seafood restaurant located in Astoria opened up an outpost in my neighborhood and is almost as good as the original. \u00a0They don't take reservations so plan 30-60 mins wait but it's not that bad if you grab a drink at the bar with the friendly bartenders. \u00a0This time we ordered the dips and mussels for appetizers. \u00a0Both very good but what you should go for is the full fish (this time the delicious branzino) and the addictive lemon potatoes (I am not a huge fan of lemons but these are amazing). \u00a0Service is great and will definitely go back...don't forget that they have free dessert."], ["Christie K.", "The staff was so rude we walked out after our water was served.

Since he was confronted by his boss, he had to express his frustration to me and let me know how I had embarrassed and belittled his name (which I never mentioned, since I don't even know it) publicly in front of a 5,000 audience. I replied that is what Yelp is for: to write the review of what took place, \u00a0whether good or bad.

Then I'd probably have reconsidered what I wrote, since the place has amazing food; unfortunately a very unprofessional manager was hired to run that place. This man is rude, arrogant and quite remarkably an imbecile for having argued with me in front in front of all his employees and customers. He treated me like I was a spoiled child, embarrassed me in front of all those people (he said people here are family - thus, according to him, it was ok to embarrass me in front of them!!!). He was so concerned of his reputation that he apparently didn't acknowledge the fact that he's caused a scene and managed to ruin his own image.

This location is infinitely closer to me than Astoria. It's been on my list for awhile but I finally got to try it this past Thursday with my girlfriends, one of whom was bringing her new boyfriend and had never tried Greek cuisine!Most of us arrived at 6:30pm to a rather bustling dinner crowd already. Since they don't take reservations, I was afraid we'd have to wait awhile but they had a table for us -- 4 seater +1 on the end. The host confirmed with her manager before allowing us to sit down even though our whole party had not come yet, which was pretty cool. Our last guest ended up coming a bit later but with an additional guest which made for an awkward situation (we had started eating already, too). The manager was very accommodating, moved around some tables and even another party of two to resituate us at a table for 6, whew! We sampled the following:Grilled octopus -- a rather expensive appetizer at $17 but worth it. Absolutely phenomenal and the best I've ever had.Two gigantic, slightly charred tentacles that were so fresh, juicy and tender. They were coated in a mildly zesty vinaigrette that was just perfect! This was the highlight dish of the evening.Calamari -- coated in a very light breading and fried perfectly. It was a very generous portion too. I wasn't a fan of the accompanying tomato sauce though -- it was so cold and bland.Kyclades Special -- for $40, I actually thought this was a good deal. It was a ton of FRESH seafood and definitely enough for two. The platter included a lobster tail (one of the biggest I've ever seen/had), filet of sole, 3 stuffed jumbo shrimp, 3 stuffed clams(on the smaller size) and about 10 scallops. Everything was cooked perfectly (aside from the sole, which was kind of mushy) but rather under seasoned, especially the stuffing on the clams and shrimp. My favorite on the platter was the scallops, even though I had the best scallops ever in Boston (Neptune Oyster) the previous weekend -- these were really juicy and tender too and I happily ate most of them.Lemon Potatoes -- We picked this to accompany the Kyclades Special. I found them to be overly acidic but couldn't stop eating them, hahaha.Rib eye -- I got to try a small bite of this and it was wonderful! Huge, tender and juicy piece of steak -- I loved the char, too. I believe it was ordered medium rare and came medium (my preferred) though. Lastly, the complimentary dessert, Galaktoboureko (custard pie with phyllo and a drizzle of light syrup). I loved this so much. I've had it at other places but Taverna's version is excellent. The custard is so creamy! I could have totally had another slice but I didn't want to ask for seconds of a free dessert, hha.Can't wait to come back for the octopus and dessert but will probably be sampling a different entree next time."], ["Sev K.", "Good place overall. \u00a0Food is good, service is good. \u00a0A tad bit on the pricey side.They do not take reservations, so that means you'll have to wait in line no matter what. \u00a0The wait really took a toll on us ( ~ 35 mins and you have to hover around). \u00a0Came here as a party of 5... and all guests must be present when called. \u00a0So if your friend has to run to move his car, your table will be given to someone else (like what happened to us) The only downside to this place, I would say, is that their fish is farm-raised."], ["Emilia R.", "I've been on a seafood kick lately and Taverna is now right up there with my other good seafood restaurants. Came on a Saturday night with a few friends right around 630pmish. I called ahead and they said it starts filling up around 630-7, and that was pretty spot on - at 545 there was room for our party of 4, but by the time our whole party got there at 630 we had to wait about 45 mins.Between the four of us we split two appetizers - spanakopita and fried calamari - and two of the \"Kyclades\" special. The calamari was fresh and cooked well - not too greasy or crunchy, just right. The spanakopita was a large square rather than triangles, and the dough was fairly thick rather than being flaky, crispy layers of phyllo dough. The doughier the better in my opinion, so I liked this version or the typical dish.The special included 3 jumbo shrimp stuffed with crabmeat, about 7 scallops, 3 clams, fillet of sole, and lobster tail. My friend and I split everything, and with the appetizers it was plenty of food. I'm not usually big on scallops but these were so tender and smooth, I was a fan. Also really liked the shrimp and crabmeat combo. All of the seafood tasted fresh and Finally we each got the complimentary dessert of custard in phyllo dough called Galaktoboureko. I'm usually not into custard at all but this was surprisingly good, not too sweet or liquidy.This place lived up to expectations.

I always wondered why it shared the same name as the place I knew in Astoria, and that it was actually on par.

And semolina cake on the house - it's a pleasant surprise before you get your check.Today I was dissatisfied though. I couldn't get a table for a party of two although there were a few free tables which according to the hostess had been reserved. That was strange because this restaurant didn't take any reservations before.The owners should implement a good reservation system if they want to keep their loyal customers."], ["Sweenly L.", "The wait was pretty long, 1 hour and 20 minutes. They don't take reservations. I had a headache by the end of my wait. Finally got to sit down. We ordered the octopus and mussels for starters and the special and scallops for main. The octopus texture was different from what I expected - my second time trying octopus but I really enjoyed it! The mussels were heavenly. Like I mean so good. The mussel meat was tiny but that tomato feta sauce was SOOO balanced. It wasn't heavy but still creamy. We asked for extra bread, and they were happy to oblige, and ate with the sauce which made it taste all the better!! Definitely the highlight of the meal.Scallops dish was good - pictures were a little deceiving. Not as big as they appear in the previous reviews. It was good nonetheless! A little too over cooked/chewy than I prefer.The special was good but I wasn't a huge fan of the stuffing in the clams or shrimp. It loses the seafoods' taste. I really didn't taste the clam at all. Scallops were less cooked in this dish - seasoning was slightly different. I liked it best. The fish, I found like three or four small bones in when I ate it. Unlucky me. And lobster, I personally didn't try.The complimentary dessert was so good! The manager (I think) would frequently come to our table and ask if we were doing good - very friendly guy!

Baby shark- I feel bad eating you but you are tender lemony and delicious. The grilled octopus (2 tentacles) was as tender and flavorful as imagined, the best grilled octopus that I've ever had.

However, I believe in second chances and this place definitely deserved one. The food was infinitely better than Astoria's!! Infinitely!! Everything was fresh and had my friends and I wanting more.I highly recommend the grilled octopus and chicken skewer! The octopus had the perfect consistency and wasn't excessively chewy. If we weren't sharing I would have eaten the whole plate myself. The chicken was also unbelievably good. It came in huge chunks so I was expecting it to be dry, but that was not the case at ALL. Mmm... perfectly seasoned, tender, juicy chunks. The grilled onions and peppers it came with were good too. I was able to taste both the vegetables and the nice carcinogenic flakes.The spinach pie was a little too creamy for me so I didn't like it too much. We also had the clams stuffed with crabmeat. I had this over in Astoria and hated it because the crabmeat did not taste anything remotely like crab...or anything for that matter. Here, though, I couldn't get enough. The clams themselves were incredibly small so it was mostly just crabmeat, which is fine by me. The complimentary custard dessert completed a great meal.Great service too.

I recommend trying to sit back there if you can.Many people below said that the portions are huge, but I thought they were just right. Each person can have one entree to himself. I recommend the grill chicken most highly - the chicken is perfectly grilled and mixes really well with the vegetables (especially grilled onion) and rice they give you, plus you get a small salad on the side. I would also recommend the chicken cous cous, which is basically a couple chicken legs with cous cous and several large pieces of vegetables (potato, sweet potato, zucchini, etc.) All of the vegetables were so delicious and fresh tasting. Finally, I would recommend the mango martini, which tastes just like you're eating mango sorbet.This place does not take reservations for small parties, but we were able to get a table for 2 around 7:30/8 on a Tuesday immediately.

Luckily this is not that, otherwise the Morroccan food wouldn't be nearly as good.What to get: Lamb or Chicken Tagine with traditional sauce and CouscousAnd: There's a Manhattan location of this place tooWhat else: Don't get confused and order a \"Tangerine with Couscous.\" You can buy those at the grocery store nearby, and it's a lot cheaper.Cafe Smogador is the Los Angeles equivalent of this place. It has much better air conditioning, is full of models and Mexicans (and Mexican models) and the advantage is that at any time of year, you can hit the beach after a meal, with a belly full of couscous.This is basically good, slightly gentrified Morroccan food at New York City prices (specifically Williamsburg prices). I've eaten here twice (although one was the Manhattan location), and I can say that both the Lamb and the Chicken Tagine are:(a) delicious(b) have a lovely sauce (traditional style)(c) portions are too small(d) overpriced(e) couscous is cooked perfectlyCafe Logad, OR is the Portland Oregon version of this place. It's full of Lumbersexuals and people named Jacks, doing Jack-like things such as felling trees, felling each other up, and Jack-ing the way only Jacks can.That's about all there is to it really. You're going to be paying 15-25 here for food, and I wish it were under 10 for something because then I'd eat here more often. The prices are comparable to the amazing North African food in Paris, but thankfully, so is the taste. Unfortunately, the portions are not.Cafe Fogador is the San Francisco version of this place. It's on Alcatraz Island, and once you dine there, you can never leave, unless you're Sean Connery and even then you have to swim the f***ing channel so you're f***ed either way.You have a choice of 3 or 4 different sauces with the Tagine. I highly recommend the traditional, which is a little sweet featuring Sultanas and such, but is authentic and delicious. The other options seem to me modern \"inventions\" to try and please the Americans, and that never floats my boat. I may try the Cilantro sauce at some point (I think that was one of the options). Note that by Sultanas I do not mean Sultans, Cafe Smaug-ador is not very popular. In fact it's desolate. Mogador on the other hand is much more popular.For someone that doesn't even like Hobbit/Lord Of Rings stuff, and has never seen a single movie or read a single book connected with it... there were an awful lot of Dildo jokes in this review. Oh crap, I meant Bilbo. See? I totally am a Tolkein amateur. I'm also a toking amateur too because I've never done drugs in my life. But you don't need to know that.

I was seated within 5 minutes at the bar.Ordered a Hummus appetizer ($5.75), then Sunday Brunch - Eggs Normandy (2 poached eggs on top of Smoked Salmon and English Muffin with Hollandaise Sauce, home fries & mesclun salad) with orange juice and cappuccino ($16.50).Hummus, perfect appetizer with a little olive oil in middle along side of pita bread. The pita bread was fluffy, firm, and warm. Well worth it!Eggs Normandy was absolutely sublime. Perfectly cooked poached eggs (soft, not running yolks) with fine tasting Hollandaise Sauce.

Also, the decor is super nice, the hipster touch but with a Moroccan side to it. They also have outdoor seating in the front although it's tight, I think they have room for just one table. The food is as good as the one in East Village. I order the salad nicoise which came with grilled salmon (ordered it rare!) and it was aaaaamazing. The babaganoush is superb and comes with warm pita bread. The soup of the day was a total finding: butternut squash and turnip. Wow! Delicious. Good prices and menu options.

When my waitress arrived, I asked again and she was able to move us. There were plenty of seats in the back.Our new waiter was fine, but was just that.

As I entered, there were only two parties dining. My expectations dropped lower after that. I walked in and was told to sit anywhere. I sat in the outdoor area, nice, comfortable and breezy compared to the feeling indoors. The service was very friendly and genuine but too slow. I was getting annoyed and tired waiting for my food and other condiments. I think this place can use a new look because the atmosphere is just off. Since I sat outdoors, I felt like I was just eating my takeout in my backyard. As I walked through the inside seating area, the air was stuffy and it felt like a cafeteria or pizza joint. It can be so much better. The food was above my expectations. I don't eat Greek food often nor do I know much about authentic greek food so all I can say was that the food was great! Hummus and Pita Bread - the hummus was finely blended with the right about of herbs and the pita bread was warm and soft. I wished it was a little more crisp though. The greek salad was good but sorry I had better. My salad was missing onions, weird. I could've used a little more cheese. I added a protein for a surcharge but the protein portion was way too small! Pork Souvlaki was decent. It was more tender and juicy than expected. I could use some more sodium but i should not. The lemon potatoes were very ordinary. Nothing special. The rice pilaf was good. It wasn't too dry or saucy, just nicely seasoned to complement the rest of the food. The drink selections were boring, I wanted a nice beverage to go with my meal. I was aiming for a beer but the selection they offered did not entice me so I didn't even bother to figure out what they offer for house wines. I think a good drink would have been the icing to my meal. Overall, I really liked the food but that was it. I would see myself coming back to dine here again but I really wish they'd deliver to my house. Unfortunately I live too far from their delivery range."], ["Lauren B.", "Tried the place today and ordered for take out. I was very disappointed in the food. Their lunch special sounded like a great deal. $9.95 for any pita sandwich and your choice of fries, salad, or soup. Walked in and ordered and the food was ready in 5 min. That was the best part.Something Signature Sandwich: the description sounds delicious. The sandwich has sundried tomatoes, lettuce, chicken, feta, and tzazitki sauce. This sandwich was sad. Too much sauce that was straight up ranch. The pita was soggy and you couldn't taste anything but the sauce. Sadly, I could not eat more than half of the sandwich.Fries: How can you mess up fries? I quickly opened the container to avoid a soggy mess. Yet, they were still soggy, but I can deal with that. However, they tasted stale and had no salt on them. That is an injustice to a french fry.The worst part was one of their cooks who stared at my friend and I while cutting the chicken and preparing the sandwich. He would directly face us and wink at us. I swear he licked his lips at one point too. Dude, get to work and have respect. Save yourself from being subjected to their douche of a worker and go somewhere else."], ["Jane M.", "I only get one thing here and it's their chicken gyro sandwich.

He ordered the mixed grill (contained pork souvlaki, thin cuts of lamb, and sausage). His absolute \u00a0favorite of the dish was the lamb - he could not stop raving about how the lamb was spiced and prepared in a way such that the strong lamb taste is barely noticeable. Kept repeating during how meal his approval of the grilled pork souvlaki and the lamb. \u00a0The sausage, he said, was just okay.As for me, I ordered the pork souvlaki sandwich which included tomatoes, red onions, fries, and a light but flavorful yogurt (?) Sauce. \u00a0Although I am not that crazy about Mediterranean, I do occasionally enjoy it and this place is def. better than the average street cart in New York. \u00a0Their side salad that comes with the platters includes feta cheese and provides a nice balance.

It was a little bit of onions and the tomatoes were cut so huge that I had to take them out to get to my chicken. The flavor of the chicken was as good as ever but the meal itself was bad.

I have tons of hummus in my fridge, so we ate nothing for appetizer, saved the pitas it came with for the entree. I guess theyre too lazy or think their customers are not deserving of a phone call to alert them or ask for another option. The Greek herb fries \u00a0with feta were cut fat and cooked soggy, hardly any herbs, and cheap feta crumbles were super salty. Gross, and I was really looking forward \u00a0to them, since theyve been amazing \u00a0at other Greek places. The chicken entree was very mediocre, so much so that I have nothing to say about it.

The fries could definitely use some salt or more feta cheese would do the trick but they kind of skimp on the cheese for me.The gyro is always really good, my parents really enjoy it. I have had two issues with their to go food. I ordered food for pick up on delivery.com and after 30 minutes I showed up to pick up the order and they hadn't even processed it yet. I did get the conformation email from delivery saying the restaurant had confirmed the order. Instead of taking responsibility they made an excuse and blamed delivery.com it was a bit disappointing. Things happen but taking ownership is so important. I gave them another chance, I ordered food for Delivery. After an hour and a half I called them and he told me the delivery had left and would be there any minute. An hour and a half is WAY too long to wait for delivery, especially considering my parents live 3 block away, literally 3 blocks. Maybe it would be better to eat there instead of ordering.

It wasn't bad. It almost looks like a miniature Chinese tamale. It tastes good when you dip it in yogurt. 2. Pita Bread and Hummus- Love the pita bread. It was warm and soft. The Hummus-a creamy blend of chickpeas, garlic & herbs was a good dip for the Pita Bread. Although I kept dipping the pita bread with yogurt more. I think that was a better combination. Entree:Greek-Style Gyro Platter- slow-roasted rotisserie pork served with rice and side salad. I definitely enjoy this dish. The rotisserie pork wasn't dry or hard. It was cooked just right. Service was a bit slow with our appetizers, but the food was good. Prices are reasonable. It is an open kitchen, so you can see your food being made. The place itself is small, but not too small. The tables are evenly spaced, so you don't feel cramped. Overall, good tasting Greek food."], ["K S.", "So I will just go ahead and agree with many of the reviews here---delivery takes FOREVER at times.A few weeks ago my parents ordered from this place---nothing fancy---and it took them about an hour and a half to get food.

When it was time for the bill, I asked the waiter how the management was going to make up for the EXTREMELY, SLOW ONE HOUR WAIT. He said they have desserts and that he would check with the management. A few minutes later a man came to our table to lecture us about how orders are prepared in the order in which they are received or the cooks will get confused. So one sandwich and two platters had to wait. We then pointed out the two mistakes made on our orders as well. He briskly huffed away.

The platters came with two chicken souvlaki skewers which were very tasty and seasoned well. I wanted to keep the dish semi-healthy so I went for the rice instead of the french fries ... I have to admit, I'm not a huge fan of rice pilaf ... but it was cooked nicely and went really well with the chicken. The salad on the side could have had a little more lettuce- there were more tomatoes and cucumbers than there was romaine. \u00a0The pita bread was delicious.. and my favorite part of this meal .... the tzatziki was the best I have ever had!

I ordered it with a simple side of salad and a glass of wine($6). The octopus, with 2 large pieces, was amazing. Soft, not too chewy, chuncky pieces, super char-grilled.

The Char-Grilled Squid was tender and flavorful. For sharing, we ordered the Classic Greek Salad which was average but quite frankly, we didn't even have to order that. A side salad compliments most of the entrees. The gyro platter was delish especially when sandwiched between hot pita bread and tzatziki sauce. The feta cheese fries (side to the gyro) were pretty yummy. To me, the absolute best dish of the night was the Moussaka. The top layer looks like fluffy mashed potatoes but it's a cheese sauce? OMG--it was absolutely AMAZING! That top layer practically melts in your mouth as you taste the flavors of the eggpland and meat.Not only was it delicious but it was a humungo piece.

The service is accommodating but sometimes a little slow when there are a lot of customers.

I was super hungry but wanted a semi healthy option. \u00a0Avlee, with its cute table window, lured me in based on d\u00e9cor alone. White tables with a single flower center piece and clean modern light fixture make this place super cute. \u00a0There was a lamb roasting halal style behind the counter. That along with the d\u00e9cor kept me there.I order a chicken slovaki platter which comes with two sides. I choose grilled veggies and greek fries. The veggies were mainly peppers and zucchini. Yum yum yum. \u00a0And the best part of the meal was the Greek Fries. Feta cheese and truffle oil on top of crispy potatoes. Sooo good. The platter is more than enough for one person. You could probably split it between two and be full, but being that I'm greedy I stuffed myself and ate the entire thing. Overall this spot is awesome. Quick service, well seasoned dishes, and a good selection of classic Greek dishes. Tables are small so not good for large groups."], ["Hyo H.", "The food is DELICIOUSSS especially the salads and greek fries!!! Cute little spot with a friendly staff.

Though I do recommend making a reservation and not just strolling in, they're pretty busy. Our waitress was friendly and made banter with us.For the table, we got Fava Fritters to start and when they came, I was somehow expecting something else... but they were alright, maybe a tad too salty for my liking. I ordered from the Psistaria menu and went for the Shrimp platter (as that was the only pescatarian option that was most economical with getting to try 2 of their sides, their sides intrigued me). The two sides I chose to go with my platter were Spanakorizo and Artichoke & Lentils. I do have to say, when my platter came, I honestly was rather disappointmented My Shrimp platter came with 5 pieces of shrimp plus the sides and an included salad, but that was besides the point. I did think five shrimp for this particular platter wasn't worth the $20 price tag, compared to the other (sadly non-pescatarian) platter options. The flavour of the shrimp itself was fine/standard/average. The Spanakorizo side was the most memorable dish of the night, apart from the ambiance of the place. I do really wish I had had a better food experience at this place."], ["Allison H.", "So good! \u00a0Went on a Sunday night, had great food and service. \u00a0The owner came around to the tables and asked how everything was. \u00a0Love that.The lentil soup and moussaka were standouts. \u00a0Reasonable prices and welcoming atmosphere make this resto my new greek spot."], ["Zoey F.", "The spreads and sides are really the highlight of this place. Go for the choice of three spreads to experience a variety, but I especially liked the eggplant and the spicy feta. I got the lamb souvlaki, which was pretty decent.

Also expected a family-run business. Was disappointed on both counts. Had a friendly waitress but she definitely didn't look like she was part of the family business. And the food was uneven: the tarama, one of my favorite dips in the whole world, was oversalted! Oh no! Oversalting ruins a dish. The pita was delicious, but I can prepare that at home. The tomato salad with olives and feta, on the other hand, was undersalted! And the ratio of feta and olives to tomatoes was off: I make a siimilar salad myself. Its brilliance lies in getting just the right amounts of each ingredient to produce a symphony of flavors. Both dishes were fresh by the way. Just not correctly executed. Oh well...."], ["Peter D.", "I was wandering down Smith, and something told me to stop. Something told me that behind this door, I'd find the gyro i've always wanted. And it was love at first bite.

But I don't care, because however you end up ordering it, the food is excellent. Full-flavored, well-seasoned, fresh and classic Greek dishes. The gyro is everything I've ever wanted, but don't sleep on the moussaka, the salads, the soups, even the veggies are delicious. Please come here and eat their food. Not for you, even though you will enjoy it. Not for them, even though they are the nicest people and they deserve your business.But for me.

Those things aside, I've really enjoyed everything here.The gyros are tasty, although the chicken souvlaki is a bit sad (see photo), portions are decent and the prices are pretty great.

In a neighborhood with mostly new American and pan Asian food, a casual Mediterranean spot with great food is a welcome addition. Everything is well-seasoned and super fresh.The standouts:The gyro is excellent: the meat bursts with flavor. The chicken souvlaki is also quite good.The Greek salad. Plump yellow and red tomatoes (even in March!), bright cucumbers, olives, onion, loaded with creamy feta, and dressed with an herby vinaigrette.Fig rolls: baked figs wrapped in caramelized bacon. Perfect.Spanakopita: delicious.Three cold spreads appetizer. We tried the Fava Mani, Tzatziki, and Taramosalata, all tasty, especially the first two. You can get it with grilled or fried pita, or cucumber slices. The menu is very attentive to folks who are gluten-free.Avgolemono Soup: A delicious, soothing chicken soup with orzo, egg, and lemon.Mousaka: creamy and delicious.Sides: the Greek fries (with feta and an herb sauce) are delicious, and the Giganides, enormous, meaty white beans in a tomato sauce, are outstanding.Baklava: this isn't your typical, sitting on the shelf for a month dessert. It looks like a small burrito of phyllo dough. The walnut and almond filling is lightly sweetened and bursts with fresh cinnamon in a pool of honey. Get it.Notes:A few reviewers have mentioned the significant takeout business and long wait at the restaurant (in fact, as we waited for our table, someone 'warned' us that they waited 45 minutes for an appetizer). We did wait a bit for a table, but it's a small place and it wasn't any longer than we would wait elsewhere in NYC on a Friday night. They pump out a hefty takeout volume and seemed to be figuring out the balance a bit. Also, there have been some inconsistencies when I've ordered the same item (one time the gyro came with a side salad, another time it didn't; one time the Greek salad was loaded with feta, another time it barely had any). The server (the owner's son) was charming, if a bit awkward, and quick to help.That said, it would make sense to give diners some pita and olive oil or a few olives when they first sit at the table. (My friend had a small bottled smoothie as we waited, which is very reasonably priced at two bucks.) Also, providing diners with a bottle of water would cut a lot of the running around refilling water glasses."], ["Chris O.", "What a delight! Friendly service, great aesthetic, killer food.

For one, the waiter knew absolutely nothing about anything on the menu - if you work somewhere, you really need to try the food and be ready to make suggestions. Maybe he was new but at this point, he definitely wasn't ready for the floor.For appetizers, we ordered an assortment of Greek spreads - hummus, tzatziki, melizanosalata (basically a Greek Baba ghanoush), and tirokafteri (cheesy spice pur\u00e9e). These were delicious and came in relatively large portions with pita and some pickled veggies. We also shared a spanakopita which we also enjoyed. Starting with these and a nice bottle of some Greek white wine, our standards were set high for the mains but unfortunately they didn't match up. We had the lamb souvlaki and gyro platter, both not terrible but nothing special. The souvlaki looked a little bit like a cut you might get in a cafeteria and the poor gyro meat was cooked to death so was crispy and dry. The Greek fries at least were good but honestly they were just fries with some garlic and feta on top.Not an expensive meal overall so I would probably go back but would definitely order different mains. I hope by then the waiter has learned a bit more about Greek food."], ["Sky G.", "Sincere warm greeting & great food! Had the lentil with their toasted pita & octopus salad was more than enough ..

Stay away from the smelts, they are fried in old oil and are super rubbery and chewy, at least they were on the day I had them. The rest of the selection of grilled meats and seafood, spreads, appetizers and salads is fine, if not predictable, mid-level eastern Mediterranean cuisine. It's not Astoria quality and authenticity, but it's a fair representation of what we can get in the Carroll Gardens/Gowanus/Park Slope area.The servers in the restaurant are friendly, polite, slow and often forgetful. Delivery service is absolutely the worst. I have now been yelled at by someone I assume is the owner twice in the past year! Both times it was because their delivery person did not know the neighborhood (we are 4 blocks away), got lost and, instead of calling us for direction, returned to the restaurant and had someone else call us from there. And both times the owner insisted that his delivery person was at our place ringing our doorbell and calling our phone for a long time and that we weren't there. Both times we were at home the entire time, there were no phones or doorbells ringing.

I was worried that the honey would make the dish too sweet for my liking but I found it to be very balanced. The goat cheese croquettes were similarly very tasty and balanced.

This place is less than a block away, and surprisingly, it wasn't too bad of a wait. At around 2-3 PM, it was only a 30 minute wait. The host was nice and kept an eye out for us, even though we decided to walk around in the crisp air for the duration of our wait. There were also stools they put outside that we rested on after we came back from our walk.We were seated in a cozy corner of the place - it was a bench/booth with lots of cushions and pillows. Other than a random fly buzzing around, it was extremely comfortable. We were seated and told immediately that they had run out of the lamb hash (nooo!) and the tzatziki dip, which was disappointing. We instead ordered savory parmesan toast, and green eggs and lamb. The toast was more like a take on eggs benedict sans meat, which I didn't mind at all. It was delicious and extremely filling, especially with the potatos. The green eggs and lamb were also great - the cilantro infused scrambled eggs were refreshingly different, and now I'm wondering why I didn't always put cilantro in my scrambled eggs. The lamb sausage was also great, but I was a little sad that they had run out of the lamb hash.I also ordered a white-mango sangria, which was strong and delicious - but there was no sign of mango - just a few chunks of apples.

While I've had dinner at the bar, Olea's brunch is my favorite, and I find myself craving it every few weeks. The waits are often long, but if you have the time to spare, it's so worth it. My boyfriend and I went for brunch and shared two dishes that became my all-time favorites. We shared the Brooklyn-made ricotta with fruit preserves and almonds, served with warm pita. I'm not generally a ricotta or even cheese enthusiast, but this dish was a game changer. The ricotta was ethereally creamy, and the fruit added just enough sweetness and the almonds just enough texture. Contrasted with the warm pita, it was an insanely good bite of food. While the serving of ricotta is quite large, it was labeled as a smaller plate, so we also shared the lamb hash, which is a main. This thing could feed a family, and that's saying a lot coming from me, as we can EAT. It comes out in a huge, hot skillet, and is filled with the tenderest lamb, tomatoes, root vegetables, and topped with eggs. This is one of those things you can't stop eating, even after you're so full you feel like you're gonna explode, because it's so addictive. That said, we did have leftovers. It's an amazing value, as you'll definitely get a few meals out of it. When the weather is nice, it's a great place to eat outdoors, and it's just across from the Fort Greene Brooklyn Flea. The interior is nice as well, with eclectic and colorful decor and a beautiful bar. Excellent all around."], ["Re Y.", "After our visit to the Brooklyn Flea market, we spotted this place and decided to stop for lunch ! Real nice funky looking place.

For the life of me cant recall its name now :-) Was very different from what i thought it would be, i was expecting a roasted crust salmon, in turn this was more like salmon in the form of a salsa sorts that can be eaten as bruschetta. None the less was a experiment am glad i tried. Was very light and fresh for the heat. Quiet liked it. I would suggest you try out their Sangria or Mimosa, almost every table had.

The room is smallish, but really well lated or and cozy, but you're not too close to the neighboring tables. The grilled octopus was amazing. Perfectly cooked, lemony and delicious. The side greens were nice and garlicky and the bean/potato mash was good as well, though the ratios were a bit off. More octopus, less starch for an appetizer, please. The octopus portion did seem a bit meager. Veggie moussaka was really fantastic. The potato / Bechamel layer was divine. Nice and fluffy, but rich and satisfying. The lemon potatoes were also really good. The Greek side salad had a tiny bit of a downfall-if tomatoes aren't ripe, don't serve them. Especially in abundance. But the flavor was good and fresh. The staff was very friendly, though our waiter was a little hard to understand and a bit slow on the uptake. Other than that everyone was pleasant. I will definitely go back on a non-holiday night."], ["Jessica R.", "I went to Athena's for dinner tonight, and I'm really happy I did. The place is a romantic, small candle lit restaurant, with indoor and outdoor seating. I believe the server was also one of the owners, he was really nice, and very knowledgable of all the dishes on the menu. They had a whole list of specials, containing appetizers and entrees, and a vast selection of options on their everyday menu. As an appetizer we ordered the saganaki, which is a fried cheese that they bring to the table flames, as well as an order of hummus that came with warm pita bread. As entrees we ordered the Kotopoulo Mavrodaphne and the Souvlaki Platter. The Kotopoulo was AMAZING, it tasted somewhat like a marsala sauce but a bit sweeter, and was served over rice pilaf with a side of string beans. The food was excellent and the service was great. I will most definitely be returning!"], ["Ilona K.", "This was far from the best greek food I've had in Brooklyn but I would definitely return. For one, they are dog friendly. Their outdoor seating does not have trash under the tables, so my dog is not tempted to pick anything up off the floor. There is a good amount of shade, especially on the side of the restaurant. The mural of Greece is stunning. Service was fantastic.We really liked the saganaki (no flaws here). We thought the octopus was somewhat rubbery (definitely won't order that again). The grilled calamari was very fresh and tender. It was definitely a highlight. The Elliniki salad was tasty. We never eat mediterranean food without having some salad. For the main course, I got the moussaka, which was 90% potatoes. I didn't really like it. My boyfriend's father makes a much better moussaka. My mom got the branzino. She really liked it. I tried a piece and thought it was subpar. It really needed some lemon. My boyfriend and dad ordered the specials. My dad's leg of lamb was chewy/rubbery/inedible. My boyfriend's trout was outstanding. Even though the food wasn't up to my expectations, we will definitely return. Now that we have a dog, our favorites (including Elia and Faros) don't have outdoor seating so we can't go there anymore. If you're someone who hasn't eaten a lot of greek food, you will like it a lot. I just have a lot of places to compare it to."], ["Tee J.", "I love Greek food, especially Gyro's.

Wonderful Mediterranean flavors come together to create a truly delicious meal. Athena sort of does this but also falls short. It's odd. The service is wonderful. They are always very happy and they are always well-informed. The ambiance is nice, though more reminiscent of an Italian restaurant than a Greek one. The food is okay. On my last visit, I ordered saganaki, chicken souvlaki and taramasalata. It was about 15 minutes before any flaming cheese came out. And the restaurant was empty. I was also disappointed in the usage of ouzo as the alcohol of choice for the cheese. It gave it a heavy licorice flavor that I didn't enjoy. My souvlaki came out another 20 minutes later but it was lukewarm and very dry. It didn't taste grilled but rather microwaved. I'm not sure what happened. The taramasalata was good.

The chef was genuinely enthusiastic about the specials, so much so that we had to order a bunch of them, and they were delicious: we shared the mouthwatering stuffed clams, and I had a tender, aromatic goat stew with a side of green beans that had clearly been cooked in a LOT of olive oil, but were sooo good. The owner kept trying to push free samples on us, asking if we wanted to try a shot of their special cocktail (which I believe is blue and comes in a Windex bottle? C'mon, guys, that's just awesome) or the chef's special bread pudding.

The owner/chef Spiro also comes out to check on us often. As for the food, it's tough to go wrong. If you order the traditional Greek souvlaki, moussaka, gyro, etc. you'll be satisfied but why settle? The lamb shank is a specialty - rich, tender and flavorful.

Enter the restaurant announcing to the whole place \"I HAVE A GROUPON!!!\"I decided to get a groupon deal for Athena's after reading all the great reviews here on yelp. Went Saturday night with my boyfriend and can honestly say will NEVER be back.I had read a tip here on yelp warning (yes, warning. And now I know why! ) for groupon holders to call and make a reservation beforehand. Which we did and let them know we had a groupon.So when we got there, the nice waiter greeted us by name and showed us to our seat. Appetizers were tasty. We had the octopus and stuffed grape leaves. When our entrees arrived we were both shocked about the appearance and here's where things started quickly going downhill. I regret not having taken a picture! I ordered the lamb gyro, which came with rice and salad and a side of Greek French fries. The meat was actually gray, I'm not exaggerating, it was so overcooked and gray! The rice was watery and didn't taste good and the fries, o' god, were seriously the saddest French fries I've ever seen, dark brown/burnt looking but still mushy and limp and not crispy whatsoever. My bf ordered a New York strip steak Greek style (salt,pepper,lemon and oregano) which came with green beans and potatoes. Ok, for a $28 New York strip, we would at the very least expect a good executed steak. The meat was watery and wasn't seared properly so it had a \"boiled\" watered-down taste to it. The potatoes actually tasted good but the green beans were also not properly prepared and looked 'sad' and overcooked. Needless to say we stopped eating after a couple of forkfuls. The busboy came to take our food away and our waiter wasn't around so we ask the manager (owner?) for the check and presented our groupon.And OH MY GOD, a whole new level of bad experience opened up. He asked us with clear annoyance if we had told our server in the beginning about the groupon. I mentioned I had called beforehand and made a reservation 'as a groupon holder' so didn't think to announce we had a groupon before sitting down. He kept repeating \"it's not a big deal but you had to tell him\". (If it wasn't a big deal then why was he making it a big deal?) Oh, It was SO uncomfortable! So he comes back with the check and once again started the groupon lecture to which I replied we wouldn't ever eat there again, so no need for yet another lecture. He asked why that was and when we said the food wasn't good and we're clearly not having the greatest time of our lives right now! He said, and I quote \" I don't know why you asked for a plain steak. We have a creamy sauce that makes rocks taste good!\" Ok, my Boyfriend didn't choose a plain steak, the waiter suggested a Greek style (this is a Greek restaurant so he thought it would be good). And if it isn't good, don't suggest it, or even better, TAKE IT OFF THE MENU!!!So turning to me, he asked what I had and when I said I had the lamb gyro, he (I swear!) shrugged his shoulders and said \"well, the gyro. That's the gyro\" . Ha! I wanted to laugh that was so ridiculous. If you have to \"shrug\" your shoulders to explain the quality of what you're serving, again, I'm sorry it should NOT be be on the menu! Maybe it was a bad night. Maybe we actually had bad luck with what we ordered, but his attitude about the groupon and his disregard for our bad experience was surprising and for that alone we won't be eating there again."], ["Michelle R.", "The service was great. All waiters were very nice and attentive. However, the food was ok. The complementary pita bread and housemade humus arrived to my table 15 mins after ordering my meal and was nothing special. We decided to try the chicken liver over salad appetizer but were disappointed to see a massive amount of liver and barely any greens on the plate. It was an overwhelming amount of meat! I'm not a huge fan of liver so I wasn't expecting to love this dish but was hoping to get more greens to balance out the liver taste. For entree we shared the lamb with mash & green beans and the staff was nice enough to split our 1 entree onto two plates! I thought that was awesome. The lamb itself was delicious! It was flavorful but not overly seasoned. The mash was ok but too buttery and the green beans were nothing special.I probably won't be coming back to this place, but I do want to say that the staff there was awesome despite us having a groupon."], ["David C.", "The food here is phenomenal.

Love it.I get the lamb platter with the roasted potato side and the seasoned rice + tzatziki sauce every time. The lamb is always super delicious, tender and the rice perfectly seasoned and the roasted potato (omg) is just divine.Definitely on the top of my seamless go-to list."], ["Elizabeth D.", "I was pleased to see a new Greek place on Seamless. Their menu included items I hadn't tired before, so I placed my order online and waited for my food to arrive. Though the quoted delivery estimate at the time I ordered was 30-45 minutes my doorbell was ringing just 19 minutes later. When placing y order I was puzzled to see Greek fries priced at $6, but an extra $2 to add feta. What are Greek fries without feta? I think we just call them \"fries\". I payed the two bucks and hoped that this meant extra cheese. Nope. Not only was the cheese portion stingy, the rest of the dish comprised of a little dried oregano and.... nothing else. I'm accustomed to Greek fries with a greasy topping of melted feta, oregano, fresh parsley, garlicky butter, and a lemon wedge for squeezing on top. For $8 this was the saddest version I've encountered.According to the menu, the Prasini is a salad of Romaine, dill, shallots, and feta. Small or large portions are offered, but without standardized measurements to indicate what this restaurant considered \"large\" or \"small\". At the mercy of this subjective description, I went with the large, priced at a staggering $13. What I received was a very expensive bowl of lettuce, the entire dish weighing in at just 10 ounces in total (photo shared). The promised dill was merely a garnish, maybe 2 teaspoons. There was a nice chunk of feta on top, but the shallots were absent entirely, replaced with about a tablespoon of fresh sliced scallions. The two stuffed grapes leaves on top were a nice surprise, but seeing as I also ordered a portion of these myself, I would have much preferred a reasonable portion size of the salad for which I payed $13. Oil and vinegar were served on the side.I had forgotten the Combo Dip Spread Platter when I placed my order, so I jumped back on Seamless and paid to have that delivered, then called the restaurant to sort out my previous order. John, the manager, was receptive and apologetic. He told me there was an error on the Seamless website, that they had meant to describe the salad as having scallions, not shallots. I still couldn't believe they'd have the nerve to charge $13 for this small bowl, but he confirmed that yes, they had sent what they refer to as a large. But my questioning the portion size and ingredient substitution didn't inspire him to offer a refund for the cost of the salad, and I didn't ask; if Pitas and Sticks is comfortable serving this then there is little more to say. John did say he'd send out a corrected order of fries along with my spread platter, and offered to throw in a complementary dessert for my trouble.So I sit down to eat the Gemista as I wait for the rest of the food. Except, there's a problem here, too. The Gemista was listed as tomatoes and peppers stuffed with rice and herbs. Though not a fan of stuffed peppers, I love tomatoes, so I figured I'd just share the peppers with my fella. Except there were no tomatoes. Just two stuffed bell peppers with a small side of classic Greek salad. Again, I called and spoke to John, who offered to send out the last stuffed tomato in the house along with my delivery. Thank you, super.I get started on my lemon orzo soup while waiting for the poor delivery guy to return. Seriously?! The menu included no further description, so I assumed it was just that- orzo in a lemony broth. Turned out to be a creamy chicken soup. We do not eat chicken. I wasn't calling the restaurant a third time; that's practically begging for someone to spit in your food. So, $5 down the drain.My corrected order finally shows up, and I open the bag to find fries with a lot of cheese but nothing else, not even a little dried oregano like last time. The dip spread platter and bread were delicious, but the babba ganoush was weird, like they forgot to mix in the tahini. And that dessert he offered for my troubles? Not even included. I give up. Between dinner and 20% tip to the delivery guy, I paid $68 for this fiasco. I'll be contacting Seamless directly."], ["Cecilia S.", "Picked up a lamb pita and two spinach pies to go. Got home and everything was delicious!!!! Will definitely go back."], ["Lisa L.", "Ordered delivery so please please eat in. My delivery came aftr 45-50mins. The food looked like it was cooked n sitting around for half an hr before delivery. \u00a0I had a shrimp pita and a chicken platter cuz I read that the pita might be small. Pita was in fact, small. Shrimp were cooked nicely but unfortunately there wasnt much of it.. Wasnt much onions or tomatoes either.. it had literally 3fries to stuff up the inside of the pita. It wasnt completely cold, but the tzatziki sauce was caked at the bottom of the pita. Wasnt such a big fan of the tzatziki sauce. The chicken platter came with dry cold chicken. Dry to the point where it was kind of tough. The best thing was the greek salad on the side. Nothing amazing about the roasted potatoes, not seasoned enough, not roasted enough either in my opinion. Pita bread not remarkble. My meal was a waste of money."], ["Lily F.", "Why isn't there such thing as zero stars?? :/I ordered the chicken pita, in hopes of a good lunch. I was disappointed when I tasted the fries stuffed in the pita, it was not good. I ordered fries on the side, thank goodness they were crunchy, except a few fell on me when it was placed down on the table. But anyways, my boyfriend ordered the lamb platter. One word HORRIBLE. I'm sorry but it did not taste good at all. The salad was frozen-like, the lamb was super dry and the pita bread was not tasty at all, and I usually love pita bread, but this one I have to give a thumbs down. I wouldn't recommend this place, it's not worth its price either."], ["Daiya M.", "Ordered food waited 2 hours for it and it was ICE COLD never again!!!!!!!"], ["Mallorie W.", "Best Greek food in Brooklyn. The service is excellent, the food is so fresh and you can tell the quality is top notch. The shrimp appetizer is amazing, you can tell this is someone's grandmas recipe!!! I almost licked the bowl, I heard myself back. The feta is the best I've ever had! The lamb is so so so good too, the salads are giant and delicious. We also got a chicken stick that you shouldn't miss out on! Prices seemed very reasonable as well!!! Def coming back here once a month!"], ["Jesse G.", "Excellent Greek food across the board on all dishes. The owner John uses recipes passed down from his family along with fresh ingredients that combine for a satisfying, not-heavy meal. Three spits roasting chicken, lamb, and pork are unparalleled. Try the spicy feta dip. Original and delicious!"], ["Cynthia S.", "Delicious meal here. Went to this restaurant last night with family. The meal was wonderful. Delicious homemade hummus and spiced something else appetizers were great. Plenty of soft, warm pita bread. I had the lamb burger platter which was tasty with plenty of crisp salad. We ordered two bottles of Greek white wine for the table and it was refreshing and fruitful. My husband tried the lemon soup and loved it. The baklava was not too sweet which made it particularly enjoyable. This is a family run restaurant and they were all so friendly and helpful. What a wonderful addition to the growing Park Slope neighborhood. We will definitely go back."], ["Michael S.", "Delivery was an hour late and the chicken sticks were tough. \u00a0Never again."], ["Maha C.", "I can't truly rate the food. I got a confirmation from seamless at 5.45 but it didnt get here until 7:20 PM. The lemon soup was tasty but the sandwiches were cold and congealed. i had even called to chase down my order and the woman didnt even express surprise that 1.5 hours had gone by. Weird."], ["Travis H.", "Food was 4.5 hours late"], ["Ed L.", "Lamb gyro and platter were extremely dry almost impossible to eat. Would not order again"], ["Stefanie W.", "This place is a gem! I love Greek food and this is the best I've had in a long time. Since it opened a month ago, we've eaten here every week. The traditional Greek dip combo plate is amazing as is the Greek Orzo soup. Everything is fresh and ingredients are very high quality. The grilled veggie pita is delicious with perfectly grilled veggies and feta cheese on light and fluffy homemade pita bread. Spanakopita is great, too - light and flaky. Even our 5 year old loves it - can you say \"tzatziki\"? Yum. \u00a0The owners, a really nice Greek couple, came by to see how everything was. Highly recommend!"], ["Matthew L.", "Looking for a quick easy meal on the way home. Loved the look of the space and decided to try. Super friendly team and delicious food. We tried the chicken and lamb platters with hummus. All tasted fresh and well seasoned. We would go back again!"], ["Sheri S.", "This place is great! The food is delicious the steak sticks are absolutely delightful. kudos"], ["Ilana G.", "I've only done takeout, but everything is deeeeelicious. Shrimp pita, Greek salad, lemon potatoes, spicy feta spread, tzaziki, eggplant spread, hummus, Greek frapp\u00e9 -- all YUM. The pita bread is soft and warm and chewy.

Being Greek I'm blessed to spend my summers in Greece the island of Crete and Mykonos. I wait 3 seasons to have the perfect pita sandwich in Greece, always wishing a place in nyc existed. I find myself constantly explaining to friends that the gyros (meatloaf stuff)at diners and Greek festivals don't even exist in Greece. Maybe they do in some other Mediterranean countries. \u00a0This place had it! \u00a0I had the pork pita and traditional Greek salad with a draft Sams October(excellent beer selection). My wife had the chicken and shrimp sticks that she enjoyed with a spicy feta dip and pita. \u00a0The price was reasonable for the quality and service. \u00a0I forgot to mention the Greek frappe is also awesome must try if you are a coffee fanatic. Definitely will recommend to my Greek and non Greek friends."], ["Lexie C.", "I wanted to like this place but it's hard when the food is so expensive and the meat on the stick is a joke!!! Tiniest pieces of meat in the world also not a great flavor. I had roasted chicken as well no flavor little cut pieces that came with literally 5 French fries and filled up mostly with salad. The feta cheese was terrible. I dared my husband to eat it for 10 bucks and he couldn't ( threw up all his food lol) I had the moussaka and it was the only decent thing the beef was flavored well. Otherwise don't waste your time here make your own shish -kA -bob !! Also slow delivery food was cold!!"], ["Dave N.", "Wandered into Pitas and Sticks while admittedly looking for atomic wings... and was pleasantly surprised! A Greek restaurant! I actually have never had Greek food outside of this besides fast-food style lamb so my girlfriend, whom is very familiar with Greek cuisine, said lets go in and try it. Immediately we were greeted by a very friendly Leah our waitress who gave us a choice of seats. Now I've worked in enough restaurants to know that a girl like her is hard to find and is one of the key components in running a successful business. Bubbly, friendly, personable, and able to give recommendations. Owners, you should take care of her she will make you rich. Anyway we ordered a safe dish - the pita and hummus and two main dishes; two from their traditional options. The names of these dishes eludes me but the first one was with beef and had a type of pasta. It reminded me very much of a lasagna. The second one was with cheese and spinach baked inside of a flaky pastry. I was blown away by the portion size and I devoured my plate while my weak girlfriend had to box the rest of hers. Both dishes came with salad and more pita bread. Several times Leah and I think her manager came and asked us how the food was and we had trouble answering with our mouths full. With that being said this type of restaurant would be very capable in a more upscale selection such as in LES or in Greenwich... so seeing some of these 3 star reviews actually makes me sad because it's very apparent that most of these reviews were written tastelessly by vague \"parkslopians\" with more opinion then palate. Truly Pita and Sticks is a gem in Brooklyn and I for one am glad Atomic wings is out. Much better on my digestive system anyway."], ["Lila Z.", "I will start off by saying that the food is in fact very tasty and that the renovation transformed the space into much more comfortable and warm atmosphere. In addition, the staff was friendly and helpful and the food was prepared promptly for my take out order. My qualms however, outweigh the pros and will most likely impede me from returning. The portion sizes were entirely inconsistent and ultimately just left me feeling ripped off. The tzatziki ($5) came in a tiny cup that looked like it should have been used for a condiment while the pita that came with it was given in abundance. What should I put on all of my pita if the spread only lasts for a few pieces? The Classic Greek Salad ($13 for the \"large\") was advertised as including feta but I hardly think a slice the size of my (petite) thumb counts. The meat skewers, I had chicken and pork, were cooked well and were good, but they too were on the smaller size. Perhaps I should have ordered the platter ($13) but I am uncertain if I will grant myself that opportunity. I am glad that there is a new and different option in the area but I wish they would lower their prices or increase the portion sizes."], ["Marie J.", "The food here is very good. So the other night I was disappointed when they left out half of our delivery order, and then charged us twice. However, John (the manager?) was apologetic, and worked to resolve both mistakes relatively quickly, sending us complementary desserts to boot. Good customer service, a fresh and tasty menu (especially love the gemista, avgolemono, and their thick tzatziki) -- we'll be back!"], ["B B.", "DO NOT ORDER TAKE OUT! Always late to delivery, add at least 15 minutes to order time."], ["Panagiotis B.", "I tried the pork gyro pita , HELL YEA . Soft pita tasty gyro ,no doubt Greek yogurt awesome taste. of course little bigger sandwich wouldn't bother.5stars only for the taste."], ["Matt M.", "Get a platter with the roasted potatoes. It's huge, especially if you get one of the first three. I can't reccomend this place highly enough. The atmosphere is quiet, perfect for a meal with a friend or date before heading for drinks at Dram Shop or Owl Bar."]], "Greek Xpress": []}
