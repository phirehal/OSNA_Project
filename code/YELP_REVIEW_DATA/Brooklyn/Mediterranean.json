There's also a lovely selection of baklava for some sweets.Even though I've usually been here when it's busy, the service is a little slow. The staff is kind and seem to be doing their best, but the wait time even when the place is empty is lengthy and that's why I am only awarding 4 stars. The food however is DELICIOUS! Everything I've tried has been mouth watering good.Location is nice, tucked away from the cacophony of Bedford Ave, and it seems like a place that more locals seem to frequent rather than tourists.Overall a great place to go if your hungry and in the area looking for something a little less pricy,"], ["Fran S.", "Oh my goodness!

I also got an Americano with milk which was literally the most amazing coffee beverage I've had in the past 4 years...and I LOVE coffee. Let's just say there was little talking and lots of ahhh-ohh ing. Check out my photos and droll :) Absolutely delicious! Best Mediterranean I've had.

It's exactly what you think it is.This pita full of basically everything was carefully constructed by the friendly guy behind the counter, hugely flavorful, and smashed the spot.

It was quiet with a lot of space to sit. Definitely liked the ambiance of this place. I got the chicken kabob pita sandwich. It was good, but I wished that it was mixed in a little bit more. If you eat the chicken by itself without the sauces and vegetables you can taste the char on it - which was not great - but the combination all together was pretty good.Their latte was good too - but I've had better.

I had the scrambled eggs Greek style and my friend the Green Eggs and Lamb. Our portions were large (another plus in terms of brunch points) and we had no issue cleaning our plates. Tip: ask for a side of aioli and drip the home fries in it--yum. The eggs were cooked well and the filling wasn't overwhelming and blended in nicely. Didn't get a bloody mary but our neighbor's looked hearty.The decor is super cozy--you really do feel like you're in someone's eclectic living room.

So savory with each piece of olive with the creamy tzatziki to play down the saltiness and the spicy harissa to cut the fried shell. It's a dish that solidifies the phrase, \"everything is better fried!\"The Average (basically everything else we had):Turkish Breakfast - a good amount of food on the plate for the price but flavor was lacking in the eggs and eggplant. \u00a0Same goes for the French Omelette. \u00a0There was a lack of seasoning in the dish and a lack of filling. \u00a0A bit disappointed.The Green Eggs with Lamb \u00a0- eggs were mediocre and under seasoned and the lamb sausage was nothing spectacular to report either. \u00a0Drinks/Dessert:The bartender was so proud of their award-winning bloody mary so of course I had to see what that was all about! \u00a0Unfortunately, I felt that it their mix was too watered down, which got more watered down with the ice - not a bloody mary to my liking. \u00a0Their red sangria is stellar though! \u00a0I highly recommend this if you're here for boozy brunchin'!For dessert, If there's creme brulee on the menu, you know I gotta try it! \u00a0This fell a bit short too. \u00a0It wasn't terrible, however the top was a bit too \"brulee-ed\". \u00a0Once you get past that, the creaminess underneath was just alright.

We then had to wait for a while for the food.We ordered a coffee and a tea; items which were not listed on the menu so it wasn't clear if they came with the meal. My tea was luke warm at best, yuck! My husband's coffee was too strong. We sat with empty cups waiting for well over ten minutes before we were asked if we wanted a refill....The food it's self was flavorful and worth the wait. I particularly enjoyed the eggs and eggplant. However, the portion was not that generous for the price.... Perhaps more eggs or another piece of pita could be included considering that the coffee and tea are not complimentary with the meal; they are $3.50.I am not sure if I will return, it wasn't horrible but at three stars there are so many other places to try. In addition I like brunch spots with an all inclusive offer."], ["Daniel B.", "I came here for lunch on a sunny day--the ambiance was airy and bright with sunshine, and the decor was heavy on wood and colored tile. \u00a0Olea is kind of a chill, boho Mediterranean taverna.A few highlights:- The hearty split-pea vegetable soup was REMARKABLE. \u00a0In all caps, yes. \u00a0Topped with crisped garlic and a dollop of beet foam that sounded a little weird but worked in perfect complement to the rest, this was among the best soups I've had in recent memory. \u00a0The waiter noted the soups here, hot and cold, are all strong.- The service was exceptional. \u00a0Yes, they got my order wrong--I asked for Turkish breakfast and got a Tuna sandwich--but they offered to comp what I got and bring me the other dish.

The sauce which is drizzled on top of the potatoes is spicy and just delicious. I had the chicken club sandwich sin bacon and my friend had the lamb meatball sandwich. My chicken sandwich was just DIVINE on brioche toast. My friend's lamb sandwich had a slight Italian fusion to it, made with yummy tomato/cheese sauce.The service was a 10/10.

I loved the small details such as the raspberry preserves packets in the glass jars. The pomegranate lemonade drink was good but very sour. We tried the pomegranate lemonade drink spiked with tequila but it was not as strong, possibly because the sourness overpowered the liquor.The drink menu was impressive for a brunch spot, but a little pricey.

Really loved the vibe, the ambience, the decor, the lighting, all of it.. really set a cozy, chill mood. The waiter was very attentive and dealt super super nicely and patiently with our indecision when it came to ordering drinks and tapas. I ended up just drinking red wine, my friend had margaritas. Both were fine, and the wine was about $8/9 a glass I believe.That's probably the best part- the drinks, the ambience, the venue, etc.The food :( I don't know if I ordered the wrong things... I really must have, even though I ordered things folks were highly suggesting #OnHere. I uploaded pictures of what I had (presentation was lovely too) but the flavors were just.... blah! EXCEPT for the fried oyster slider things, which came in a pair, they were so tiny you finished them in 2 bites. They had a delicious slaw and a yummy bun, and the oyster was fried perfectly. We started our meal with this, and it seemed like all was going to be amazing.... but then, it wasn't after that. The falafel crusted artichokes were just.. not it. Way too much falafel, no texture, no exciting flavors, the dip was blah, just.. don't order it. It's a waste of space in your belly. Second round, we ordered lamb meatballs and the poutine. The meatballs came in a red marinara of sorts sauce, with another sauce over it. Everything again was bland and without a good texture- the meatballs were just very dense, dry, and not flavorful. The poutine could also have benefited from a better dressing of the other ingredients besides the fries- the duck bits were very crispy and dry. I wouldn't order any of these items again, aside from the oyster sliders. For desert, we ordered the special, which was an ice cream sundae of sorts. This was pretty delicious, and was the saving grace after a meal of disappointments.I would honestly go back again to try other items on this menu, because I loved the service and the space, just think I ordered wrong... if anyone has any suggestions, I'd love to hear them!!"], ["Mandy L.", "Came here for a late lunch with some friends.Pros:- Love the decor - very hygge - A heavenly smell hits you as you enter the door and makes you hungry for food Cons:- Waited close to 45 min for food - since the place was so small I figured we get our food faster.

Nice interior, dim light and a bar but empty. I ordered the chicken kebab wrap in a whole wheat wrap with hummus with a side if salad. The wrap wasn't bad at all. It was an okay lunch meal. But I honestly expected way more. It kind of lacked a variety of flavor. I mostly tasted chicken, a little hummus and the wrap though there were other foods in it. There wasn't any spark for me like other places I've tried. (Other places you got to choose what you wanted in your wrap, not here I guess because it's \"restaurant setting\"). The salad was just lettuce and spinach leaves lightly coated in some random dressing. This definitely didn't do it for me. It was like eating wet leaves and grass.

The kibbeh had your typical yogurt sauce but there was something about it that made it taste different from the others and the Garlic Shrimp came with very good garlic and oil sauce. All went well with the free pita bread that came with the meal. Dinner I had the lamb shank and the description on the menu did not fail when it said that the meat will fall right off of the bone.

The cheese on the pizza was also strange it think it was a combination of mozzarella and cheddar which did not go well. \u00a0Dinner ended with a nice little blocks of some sort of free dessert which was a nice touch, but by this point the shrimp and calamari pizza had ruined us.

It was unfortunate that they don't serve rice or salad with their food like other Turkish restaurants that charge the same. They charge you $3.50 for rice or small fries. The complimentary Turkish bread was good but did not include any olive oil."], ["Doris C.", "Staff was nice, but service was kind of frazzled and very disjointed. I had to ask for a water refill after many servers passed our empty pitcher on the edge of our table. \u00a0I was asked if I wanted a drink, but we weren't given a drink menu. The guy goes to get one, but it's actually a food menu and I had to ask again. They place a basket of Turkish bread to eat it use with your dips. The brass is stale and unpalatable without dips.The hummus was smooth, kind of standard in my opinion. The eggplant spread was smoky enough, but the texture is more chunky and thick than what I'm used to. Overall, the appetizers were kind of disappointing. We ordered the whole branzino, lamb saute, Shish kebab, and gyro in yogurt. The while branzino was great, a nice white fish that was juicy enough with crispy grilled skin and a side of greens. The lamb saute was my favorite, lamb cubes with tomatoes onions and spices on a sizzling platter. The Shish kebab was tender and marinated well, but again, nothing beyond standard. It came with three half pitas, a grilled tomato, pepper and onions. The gyro in yogurt was my least favorite dish. There was sliced the gyro meat on top of yogurt and pita chips. The pita chips are mixed in with the yogurt....why would you do that? It was a terrible surprise for me. They obviously bake the dish before serving because the meat was mostly dry. However, the tables are roomy and the place doesn't feel crowded. The place was almost constantly full.

Really fresh like it had just been chopped.In addition - we ordered some pita bread with a side of hummus and tzatziki. Really fresh and wonderful.They also delivered in under 30 minutes. We'll be ordering from there again."], ["Leo K.", "Look out uncle Jessie Katsopolis, I found my new favorite greek. From start to finish this place hit all the notes.The service was some of the best I have experienced in a while.

There are two floors here, however the 2nd floor looks to used on more crowded nights.The food was outstanding, we ordered a little bit of everything and all the dishes were full of flavor and all around impressive.Food Favorites:Moussaka, perfect amount of meat to eggplant ratio, potatoes were soft and flavorful.Saganaki was mouth wateringSpicy hummus and pita, delicious and spicy as the name suggestedMy mouth was literally watering as I wrote this, i think that's as good an indicator as any on whether you should go here"], ["Jackie S.", "I'd like to begin this review by thanking my fellow Yelpers for giving this place good ratings. \u00a0I had never been to Park Slope before, and during a mother-daughter bonding day, my mom asked me to make a reservation at a restaurant in the area, so knowing her love for octopus and a good glass of wine, to Faros we went!Upon arriving, it was 6:20pm on a Saturday evening. \u00a0Many restaurants were already filling up quickly but Faros was pretty empty, maybe only three tables were filled. \u00a0My mom was skeptical but I assured her this place had good reviews (plus I already knew what I wanted to order after studying the menu for two days, so my selfish heart was set).When we sat down, we were brought a bread basket with three little noshes- a bean salad, a bean hummus-like dip, and olives drenched in olive oil. \u00a0Yay for free things! \u00a0We then proceed to order two glasses of white wine (both were very light and crisp).For the appetizer we ordered the keftedakia, Greek meatballs with a side of tzatziki sauce. \u00a0THEY. WERE. DELICIOUS. \u00a0Upon first bite, the first words I uttered were \"wow these taste like I'm at a grandma's house and she just finished making them.\"For my mom's entree, she ordered the Oktapodi Skaras, char grilled octopus. \u00a0She claimed she would've liked her dish to be served a little hotter (personally I enjoy cold octopus, but that's just me), but it was very good and the two of us destroyed our bread basket dipping slices of it in the octopus-infused olive oil.I ordered my favorite Greek dish, the Spitikos Mousakas and it was the best one I've ever had. \u00a0It came served in a clay pot, it was piping hot, and oozed and melted in my mouth. \u00a0It had the perfect balance of meat, veggies, cream, and love. \u00a0What I would do to have another bite.For dessert we ordered my favorite, the galaktoboureko. \u00a0It was very good, with just the right amount of honey and creaminess. \u00a0My only criticism is I would've liked it better at more of a room temperature (it was a little on the cold side).Overall, this place is fantastic. \u00a0The food is authentic, made with love, and you feel like you're getting a true Greek culinary experience. \u00a0The service is excellent. \u00a0Our waiter was so friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. \u00a0The restaurant itself is charming too. \u00a0From the brick walls, to the fireplace, to the Greek music playing in the background, I will definitely come back next time I'm in the area.Oh, and in case you were wondering...by the time we left (around 7:45pm), the place was packed."], ["aubrie t.", "Please don't frequent this restaurant.  I was just told my small holiday dinner party for the non-profit special needs group I volunteer with (down syndrome, autism) was unable to be accommodated for (less than 24 hours before the dinner!).The owner just called me and said that our party's budget was too low ($30 a person for family style dining, drinks not included), again, less than 24 hours BEFORE the event!He informed me that they had a, and this is a direct quote \"a very expensive party for $90 per person upstairs\" that they would rather cater to. \u00a0He went on to say that if my budget was higher--for a middle end greek restaurant--they would accommodate me, and the conversation with his wife was in no indication that I actually reserved the space. \u00a0Full Disclosure: I booked this kind of last minute, but with enough time to email the entire group.I will now attempt to find another location for my group of special needs adults within 12 hours. \u00a0If you are one of the $90 buck-a-headers, please consider spending your money at an establishment with better business manners and community sensitivity."], ["Josephine Z.", "There are few reasons not to take a trip to Faros. Unless you despise authentic Greek cuisine and abhor a refreshingly sophisticated ambiance, then by all means, avoid this place. But if you are not those things, then a trip to Faros is worth your while.The zucchini chips are basic but easily a crowd pleaser. Fried, but surprisingly light, they prepare your palette for the bold flavors of your entree. By bold, I am referring to the moussaka with ground beef. Laden with potatoes, eggplant, and cheese, this dish is heavenly indulgent but worth it. Try not to let the layer of oil that has accumulated on the bottom make you regret this dish, you and I both know you'd do it again. If you favor something lighter, yet still delicious and authentic, go for the spanakopita (spinach pie)--flaky and light(er), it would make a good meal for one, or an appetizer for two. As usual, it doesn't hurt to top your meal off with a glass of Faro's sangria, served by their charismatic bartender, Bobby."], ["Yuriy B.", "Went here last night for a big birthday dinner for a good friend of mine. \u00a0I don't know how this place did not have a wait outside the door. I know it's Park Slope and some nights are busier than others, to the point of confusion but if Faros was in the city, I don't think there would be a chance of getting a seat here during the weekend. Since I had such a great experience here with very few complaints (the complaints I do have are only for the sake of adding some realism to the review and I don't think they are truly even valid as much as nitpicking), I will provide a categorical breakdown, which I rarely do. It's usually more effort than its worth. Interior : Classic, romantic, and overall pleasant. It truly does have a very authentic Greek feel to it which is accented by lanterns, assorted wine racks throughout the restaurant, and floor lamps blended with the dim lighting that makes you want to slow the experience down.Service : Flawless service. We had a large party of about 20 and we went about ordering in a very confusing way; our waiter was professional, courteous and pleasant. Food is where Faros impressed me with every plate that hit the table had something new and different to it. Turkish food is on the rise in my area and I feel like there's one of those spots springing up on every block. Since there is some culinary overlap between the Greek and Turkish cultures, this was refreshing beyond words. Even the hummus felt homemade; chunky and rich texture at the same time that you won't see every day. I never order spinach pie in \u00a0restaurant because I'm stubborn and I believe that no spinach pie can outdo my grandma's. However, I tried a piece from my friend's plate and had to ask for more. So make sure to try the spinokapita (spinach pie). Mussels made for a delicious appetizer as well. My entree was the arni yiouvetsi which is shredded lamb with red sauce mixed into orzo. I was full halfway through the meal but kept going until I hated myself, because this was one dish that was very hard to step away from. Girlfriend had the lamb chops done to a perfect medium. There is a pretty extensive wine list, and a few great drafts including Blue Point Toasted Lager , which I have loved for 4 years now and see a lot of bars drop it for its 'mainstream' status (as compared to what) but it makes for a delicious dinner-time beer so Faros scored big on that with me. I believe there were two more craft-like options and a Sam Adams available as well. I want to go back right now."], ["Marina S.", "YUM! This is the ideal Greek spot. So many Greek restaurants unfortunately are not my top choice for dining because the food is sometimes lacking, but NOT HERE. 1. Spicy hummus and pita was so flavorful yet light. 2. The Moussaka was so hearty and delicious, I only had a bite from the boyfriend's plate but I wish I had more.3. Mosharaki Kokkinisto (spiced cubes of filet mignon over pasta): A+ does not do it justice.The staff was so accommodating and polite, it felt like we were dining among friends.

Specially the pan fried kefalograviera cheese. I have no idea why this place is not busier. Give it a chance! Great food and very nice ambiance."], ["Alexandra K.", "I can only add to the glowing reviews here for Faros, because my dinner here last night was reminiscent of great Greek home cooking, which is one of the highest compliments I can give to a rustic-style Greek restaurant like this one. I loved the decor; warm exposed brick, fireplaces, dim romantic lighting. Add to that a glass of the surprisingly good, Merlot-esque Kouros red, and I was primed for a great dining experience. I followed the recommendations and ordered a small horiatiki salad, a pikilia (selection of Greek spreads served with warm pita and a lettuce chiffonade), and the oktapodi skaras. I shared these with my cousin, who also ordered the keftedes for herself, and everything was both delicious and satisfying. With the check, the waiter brought out two shooter glasses of what I'm almost positive was rakomelo (a really good one too, extremely smooth). The service overall was great, the waiters very cordial and attentive. One of the nicest Greek restaurants I've been to in New York in a long time for sure."], ["Maria Felisa S.", "I chose Faros for my friend's birthday treat for me and we ordered the appetizer sample, the Greek salad, moussaka and grilled bronzino and every bite was exceptionally delicious and authentic!!!

This place is so much better than Rocca by a long shot!Prices are similar but the quality, atmosphere, decor and service are unmatched. The ambiance is casual elegance, contemporary-Turkish and breathably spacious.We came by around noon on a weekday to have lunch and began with their small meze sampler platter. The presentation looked beautiful and tasted just as yummy. If you enjoy Meditteranean-style dips and variety, I recommend getting the meze sampler(the small is good to be shared by 2-3; comes with pita) but leave some room for the entree.Had ordered the grilled salmon that came with salad and a side of potatoes. Everything about my meal was cooked perfectly. The salmon filet was delicious with a little bit of lemon juice and salt. The salad was fresh and dressed well and the potatoes were snacky-good savory. My friend had ordered a chicken kebab dish that arrived with rice and a salad; said the chicken pieces were juicy and seasoned well.We ended our meal with Turkish tea that came in a standard size tea glass. Was hoping to be served in a teapot but they didn't offer. Overall, our expectations were met and dining experience went smooth.Our receipt came out to close to $70 for 2 people: (1) cold starter, (2) entrees and (2) Turkish teas with tax and tip. Yes, for an everyday meal it's a bit on the pricey side but worth splurging a bit if in the area and you want to go grand.I was very happy to have left Emmons Ave redeemed after a poor experience from another \"Turkish\" restaurant nearby(Rocca).Will happily return again!"], ["Freddy V.", "Love coming to Opera when in the Sheepshead Bay Area of Brooklyn.

The menu is extensive. The restaurant is large and well decorated. However, execution is lacking.My friends and I came for a weekend brunch. We were seated immediately.

The food should come out at the same time...No one wants to eat alone or wait for everyone else to finish eating. I did enjoy all the items on my platter especially the fresh jam and cheese which were reminiscent of my time in Istanbul. \u00a0The pot of tea seemed never ending. I don't love tea usually but something about Turkish tea that makes me want to go back for more.2 of my friends ordered an eggs benedict dish and neither of the eggs came out poached...they were basically hard boiled eggs.

The lavash bread that usually comes with the chicken shish didn't come. They gave 6 pieces of chicken and a tiny side of salad. They also FORGOT the fries. I'm sorry, if you can charge the same price for the meal, I expect the exact same portion to be delivered for takeout. Of course we called back and they bought the fries. The fries were not the same fries we get at the restaurant. I was anal about the fries because I love their fries, and then for my luck we got a completely different kind.

I told him, he apologized and brought back a corrected check, etc. But this slowed down an already long-delayed bill-paying process, which was quite frustrating.

Nor was the meat too dry in any of these dishes, shepherds pie thus far was the best dish, the amount of garlic and butter that was baked into the piece was perfect, and the lamb had excellent flavor, it also came with a salad on the side with a lot of mint added, and there was even almonds added to the piece, as a matter of fact a lot of the dishes had almonds added, it was a very nice touchmy father had a tilapia dish which had almonds added to, im not a seafood lover but he really enjoyed the fish, it was fresh and not too overdonethe best has to be the desserts, oh my god, don't even get me started, I think we loved the desserts more than the entreesfirst we got mint tea, it was perfect, not too strong, it goes well with any dessert on the menuthe deserts listed included baklava, Arabic ice cream with pistachios on top, kharissa which is a coconut cake, and knafeh which was featured on food network with a wait time of 15 minutes since it is freshwe decided to go with the kharissa and knafeh since our stomachs were about to explode anywayoh my god, the kharissa was gone in less than 5 minutes, it was that good, it was light yet so flavorful and sweet, the texture was on point!the knafeh was fresh, it was oozing cheese, and it was very crunchy on top, it wasn't too sweet or too salty, it was the perfect balance, and it wasn't too heavy, no wonder everyone raves about it, next time im getting a large !I think the only thing that holds me back from giving this place 5 stars is that the options for kids are limited, there was an option of chicken and fries, and my sister wasn't too crazy about it, they should offer some sort of kids menu for those picky eatersthe bill for 4 people with drinks included was 200 dollars, it isn't cheap but you get what you pay for in terms of portions and quality, there was so much food left we took it all home"], ["Chase Y.", "It's unfortunate that I came to see the day that this establishment would \"fall off\".

The falafel came out the same way as well, too oily with no crispy exterior. Quite a bummer After we got to the mains: from the shish to the chicken kebab they both had a chew and were way over cooked. My jaw had the crazy post workout pump from all that chewing.On to the most disappointing....the knafeh. I was so very upset that this came out bad because I've had this the very first time I came. I was divine (the right amount of melty cheesy goodness that left me wanting more)But this one came out like it was sitting around. They suggest to order this with your meal cause it takes so long to make. I was expecting the same as last time.You could tell it wasn't the same as it wasn't served on the metal bowl it was cooked in, but rather a regular serving plate. Too bad I won't be returning here.

I've been here a couple times, so it was a surprise when I saw them on the list! HUGE portions and had to take it to go, almost everything. Our waiter was a very cool guy who was very knowledgable in the menu items, also, he looks like Howie Mandel, to me at least LOL.The interior looked modern and romantic, towards the back there is a couple of tables along a long window wall, best seats in the house during lunch!Appetizers:1. Eggplant Napoleon: Haven't been here in over a year, and this dish is still my favorite! Crispy eggplant layers with hummus and embedded in a pool of tomato salad. All the flavors, the hot crispy eggplant warmed up the hummus, goes perfectly well together, such a great dish! Portion for this dish was so big, not kidding, that it could've filled me up if I ate it all myself.2: Tabouleh: Again, potion so big, we all could't finish. Big bowl of green yummy salad, so lemony and minty. We kept it with us throughout the meal and used it as a side.3. Sujok: Dry sausages sliced and saut\u00e9ed with garlic and a hot chili pepper sauce. A bit over seasoned, but the complimentary pita puts a cut on it.Entrees:1. Artichoke Beef Stew: Big chunks of artichokes and beef cooked in a yummy stew, but a bit on the salty side. The sauce was very beefy, and artichokes had sorta like a potato texture. 2. Combination Platter: Three different types of meats including chicken, beef, and lamb. We found the dish on the salty side as well. Ordered the meats to be cooked well done, cooked too well that the meats were very dry and tough. Dessert: 1: Mediterranean Ice Cream: The scoops of ice cream that includes pistachio, chocolate, and ashta (sweet cream). Not sure if the flavors are homemade, can't really describe the texture of the ice cream, had a melted cheese texture, but still really good settled flavors.2. Knafeh Harissa Crossover: This item is off menu and is on a daily special. It's a fusion of their most popular dessert, Knafeh, missed with another one of their dessert which is the Harissa cake. Lovely combo, but I still preferred the Knafeh more. The coconut cake is soaked in a \u00a0rose water syrup which made the dish very elegant. Overall food was good, despite most of our hot dishes were a bit too salty for us. But the food portion on the other hand is well worth the $25 per person! All the dishes put together could have easily fed 6 people!

Baked Kafta - We got this in the tahini sauce which went well with the lamb and potatoes. He let us try the tahini sauce first too, to make sure we liked it! Great guy, great guy! Great flavor but the tahini sauce got a bit overwhelming after a while. But still amazing. Bell Peppers - This was so good. It was filled with flavor. Basically stuff peppers with rice and meat in tomato based sauce. You get a red pepper and a green pepper. Weird to say but I like the red pepper more, perhaps the red peppers are sweeter and adds a kick to the rice? But very good dish overall. We didn't get to finish everything.

The delivery guy usually shows up in a car, so waits have only been about 30 minutes. On the cold appetizer side, the brussel sprouts and the cauliflower with the pomegranate-yogurt sauce are divine.

We had musakahn, fisherman's meal, and something from specials menu with lamb and goat cheese yogurt sauce. \u00a0I liked the lamb most...it had a good tang from the sauce and the meat was tender. The fish came with a really tasty sauteed rice with really yummy spices (consider it a Mediterranean fried rice).Drinks 2.5/6: i personally would skip fancy drinks and go for \u00a0a vodka soda. If you're into fufu drinks....get the martini with grapefruit. \u00a0It reminded me of a slightly citrus-eey red Skittle candy. Really sweet drink, but watered down from over shaking (honestly a sad excuse for a martimi...perhaps don't call it a martini). \u00a0They need better specialty drinks (or a better bartender...)Staff 2/5: This is their biggest flaw, and the biggest reason for not more stars. Hostess was not well trained and rude with greeting me at the door. Other than my waiter the staff looked like they didn't want to be at work. This was a Tuesday night...wasn't crazy busy, and there were enough of them working, so there's little reason to look so miserable and angry.Price: More expensive than typical Bklyn restaurant. You can argue that it's a lot of food, but anyone who cooks knows adding a side salad and an extra cup of sauteed rice does not cost that much more and in that case....the experience is what counts and lack luster staff makes me question their pricing model."], ["Rayhan S.", "Given that I've had middle eastern food from a majority of restaurants in New York, I was truly looking forward to my date night dinner at Tanoreen. However given the hype and price, I was grossly disappointed. First off let's get the positives out of the way. The ambiance is great and works for both a large gprup outing or a more intimate dinner. The walls were adorned with middle eastern decorations. The service was great and the waiters were very attentive at refilling the water and knowledgable about the dishes.Now the negatives. The food is bland for the most part...period. We had the eggplant Napoleon which was overpowered by the baba ganoush. The second appetizer was the Mushkaan which is a pizza topped with chicken flavored by middle Eastern spices...this was truly delicious. The main course was the mixed grill platter which consisted of paltry cubes of chicken and beef and two small lamb sausages served in a sea of rice and salad overpowered with lemon. And that bit costs $21. I've had food at zaytoons and at Istanbul in Brooklyn as well as various restaurants in Astoria. But Tanoreen was by far the worst.

I have ordered a pick up. I got chicken shawarma sandwich- which is not good. I has pickled cucumbers- tastes awful. Pita is not fresh. And extremely citric. Its more lettuce, few tomatoes shreds and a lot of oil. I guess from chicken. Also I got not fresh babaganoush- which has tht much vinegar tht makes it impossible to eat.

If you are coming here bring a family or large group, their dishes are great for sharing.The hummus and harrisa and pickles are all so yummy. I wasn't so fond of the chicken fetti at first(nauseatingly rich, heavy and mild/bland) but it has grown on me. The crispy chips on top make it a nice textural contrast and the platings are beautiful.Service-wise, it's a bit cold/impersonal but not outwardly hostile. There was one weekend lunch where we attempted to flag a waiter/waitress down for the check but ended up meeting the gaze of the blonde hostess(Marilyn Monroe perm) who completely ignored our call despite having greeted and seated us earlier.It seems Rawia is the only one who puts a smile and indulges in idle pleasantries with her customers, the waitstaff just seemed uptight or not in a sunny disposition as she was. Either way, this doesn't detract us from enjoying the food. I would love to give Tanoreen a confident 5 stars but the service leaves something to be desired."], ["Sonny S.", "Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in NYC. For me it's a place for special occasions because it's a bit on the pricey side, but worth every penny. I'm a vegetarian and love the variety of mezze they have...all so flavorful and fun to eat. I prefer sharing a bunch of small plates versus the veg entrees. The absolute must eat here is the brussel sprouts. I'd be happy eating them every day. The cauliflower salad and red pepper spread were also memorable. The fatoush salad is the best I've ever had. And for dessert, the knaffe...oh the knaffe. A special experience for sure."], ["Britney F.", "So, I'm new to Bay Ridge, and I decided to try this place out.First of all, IT IS AMAZING!!!

I had never had Lebanese food before, but I generally like most Mediterranean/Turkish cuisine and had heard this was similar. Upon walking in, this place was much more upscale than I anticipated--I think I was expecting a take-out type place, but this is much more of a nice sit-down, date night type restaurant. Appetizers start around $10 and entrees are in the $20 and up range.The menu has a TON to choose from: hot and cold apps, entrees, daily specials, with every veggie/meat and non-meat combo you can think of, plus a wine list and 961 brand Lebanese beer. We started off with mhammara, a red-pepper dip served with both crispy and soft pita breads. It was delicious! The crispy pita bread was like a thin pita chip, and definitely my favorite part of the appetizer, haha. This was followed by schwarma sliders, which came with tomatoes, parsley, red onion, and yogurt sauce on the side for a customizable slider experience. We then had makdous, a cold app consisting of eggplant in olive oil stuffed with walnuts. For our entree, we split the lamb shishbarak, fried lamb dumplings served in a yogurt-based sauce and served with vermicelli rice. So hearty, so filling, and so unlike anything I've ever had. Left here stuffed and dreaming of crispy pita bread... if you're looking to break away from the usual Thai or farm-to-table cuisine for an evening out, head to this place."], ["Dona F.", "Been here a few times. Very nice atmosphere. When the owner is there she walks around the tables getting feedback. If youre a vegetarian you may be pressed finding a non meat entree .

So come to this place expecting authentic food that one could easily find in Lebanon, Palestine, and Israel. \u00a0This is not a halal cart stand or a bar so please ignore the reviewers who are basing this place off of those preconceptions. \u00a0This place is for the appetizers. \u00a0Bon appetite!

Their Green Pitza that include leeks, scallions and fenugreek with light mozzarella cheese was so good. It had a light onion smell but not too strong with a mild after taste. They also did not skimp out on the toppings so the pitza was really rich and cheesy. Their Lambajin middle eastern pitza with lamb, onion, tomato, parsley and spices was just as yummy.

They were super helpful in adding plates cups and utensils too.We ordered a lot of food for 6 people and the price was not too bad. We had 4 appetizers and 4 entrees and it was more then enough food, we had a lot of left overs. It also came with a ton of pita bread. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that one of our dishes was way over cooked and not very tasty. That was our shrimp shish kebab. We also ordered chicken shish kebabs and lamb shish kebabs and those were great, but the shrimp was not seasoned well and was too dry. Next time we get hungry near the park this will def be our go to spot."], ["National H.", "Really solid option for Turkish/Mediterranean in Park Slope. I get delivery through Seamless from here too often because it always satisfies. As others have mentioned the zucchini pancakes are great, as are the Mediterranean Salad (surprisingly fresh and substantial), and the Spinach Lunch Special. However, by far my favorite thing to get is the cold appetizer sampler. What you get is a container absolutely bursting with a wide assortment of hummus, babaghonush, haydari (a thick yogurt with garlic and walnuts I'm obsessed with), stuffed grape leaf, and several others, all with their hot & fresh Turkish bread. The small is big. Get it and serve yourself some over a couple meals or share with the table.*I've never been to their location but I walked by and it looked nice."], ["Marcus Z.", "I absolutely love Turkish food. Even before I went to Istanbul this past year, I was hooked. And what's not to love? It's so flavorful and unique. That Ottoman legacy really did the trick for Turkish cuisine.Park Slope residents are lucky to have a Turkish restaurant in their neighborhood and a good one at that. Istanbul Park offers traditional Turkish dishes at a great price. Upon our arrival, we were promptly greeted by a friendly man who I assumed was the owner. He took our beverage order and brought us some delicious T\u00fcrk cayi, or Turkish tea. For dinner, we started with a small cold appetizer sampler. It came with more or less all the cold appetizers on the menu in small portions accompanied by Turkish pide. Each individual meze was delicious in its own right and definitely freshly made. My husband actually filled up on the generous portions of the appetizer sampler but I was still hungry. I decided on ordering the Turkish classic dumpling dish known as manti. These are little dumplings about the size of a thumbnail filled with seasoned meat and served in a garlic yogurt sauce with spicy butter drizzled on top. For not being homemade (and by that I mean made by a cute Turkish grandmother), they were delicious. Just the right amount of garlic and seasoning. However, they did need a little bit of salt. I was thoroughly pleased with this place and I actually can't wait to eat here again in the future!"], ["Camille H.", "Delivery came in 35 minutes so that was great - I got the falafel and hummus, zucchini pancakes and baklava.

The only thing i didn't like is that they put the hummus in the plate with the food instead of on the side even though I specifically asked sauce not be put on my food.The baklava was delicious - you get 4 small pieces.

I was advised to try their bread and that their fried calamari was a safe bet. The calamari looked rubbery and had a pale shade I wasn't feeling. The lamb kebab while tasty seemed to be missing some meat and sat atop some depressed lettuce and rice. (Sigh). The Falafel and Hummus platter didn't look great either and lacked any flavor although upon reheating for lunch the next day I got full off the hummus and rice while the falafel tasted like a sponge. Last but not least the infamous Turkish bread..........the highlight of the meal which isn't saying much. Can you believe when I opened up my order the bread had been tossed inside on top of my food containers without any paper napkins or foil or anything to cover it or seperate it. It literally looked like the bread was tossed in as an afterthought.

We haven't been in person so if the portions are smaller when delivered, I wouldn't know, but the portions are HUGE. A small gyro platter is enough for a meal with leftovers, especially if you eat some of the fresh (and always still hot) homemade Turkish bread that comes with it. The lamb gyro is definitely my go-to favorite. It's addictively delicious, so tender and flavorful, and so are the salad and rice.

Us two and a table of 6 were the only ones there. The waitress urged us to order the zucchini pancakes - and I mean urged, it seemed from her description there was only one appetizer on this planet, and it was the zucchini pancakes. After all that fanfare, I can only report, meh. The food, similarly, was good, but not great. Standard meat / salad / rice combination that you find at Turkish places.If you ask me, Turkish food is always good, so what really separates a great Turkish place from an OK turkish place is the flavors, tenderness of meat, and overall freshness of the meal. I can only say that Istanbul Park comes in at OK for all three of those criteria.

OHH SO GOOD!Sigara boregi is filo dough that has feta cheese and parsley inside. Think like a large eggroll except cheese inside. Was pretty good, came in 5 pieces. I ordered the \"small\" gyro which was $8. 75 and it came with rice, veggies and a delicious piece of turkish bread. It was definitely enough for 2 meals so I would assume the large would be for 2 people? It was a lot. Meat was tender and had great flavor.

I was in the middle of a work phone call and was very busy that day. When I got downstairs, I saw the delivery man standing outside with my food. He could have easily just walked into the building, taken the elevator up, and handed me my food. I have no patience for this kind of half-a*s delivery service.

It does not get 5 stars for awesome presentation, atmosphere or creative chefing. It is not a place you come out of the way for. But Istanbul Park deserves 5 stars in its category - it does the standards well and in a very relaxed, easy going setting.One of the major reasons for this is that I tend to dine late and it is open until 1 AM, in a neighborhood where many places close at 10 and everything closes by 11. But that alone does not a good restaurant make. The food is always fresh and delicious and the space relaxed and pleasant. I especially like the Turkish bread and they have a number of unique hot vegetarian dishes that are great. One unfortunate recent change was to the lightbulbs, which used to be at least somewhat warmish and are now those 1000 watt extremely white compact flourescents, which just give the place and awful hue and give me a headache.

There were 4 pieces of stringy, tough lamb on the kebab sandwich and a ridiculous amount of lettuce, tomato and onion covering up the shamefully small amount of meat. I specifically asked for no lettuce as I loathe lettuce on a hot sandwich, but sure enough, there was tons of it on there.

I went in for an early dinner and there was only one couple seated in the restaurant (that should've been a red flag). I always like to ask the waiters what their recommendations are before I order.

However I was super hungry and decided to play it safe with the Chicken Adana. They brought the food out quickly which told me it was already made. I took one bite from the chicken and almost threw it up; the texture and taste were disgusting. The salad was not fresh, it was soggy and very cold, as if it had been sitting in the refrigerator for a few days. I told the waitress I didn't not like it and I wanted to order something different. She took the plate away and I order humus. The humus was edible and also the only thing I ate. The check came around and I noticed that they charged me for the Chicken Adana after I had sent it back nearly untouched. I told the waitress that I didn't like it and she went to grab the manager. Jason the manager told me he was the owner and that there was nothing he could do if I did not like the food. I told him I didn't want to pay for something that I did not eat. He then started to yell at me and threating to call the cops. The bill was 20 bucks, which I paid just so he would stop crying. I felt so ripped off! I only had water, bread and humus and I paid 20 bucks for that. Seriously, DO NOT gives them your business.

But last night we were disappointed to discover that the menu had changed, and with it came the removal of several of our favorite Moroccan dishes. As a vegetarian, it became a lot harder to order. The new dishes included vegetarian options but all of them were highly acidic and used eggs or cheese as the protein. That worked for me, but not my date. When we asked if we could still order something from the old menu, we were told that we could not. \u00a0Also, that they'd been removed to make the menu more \"sophisticated,\" which was a hard thing to hear as a person of Moroccan descent, because three of the absent dishes are beloved to my family, such as Burekas and M'jedra. Also a confusing descriptor, because while the new pita pockets were delicious, they were served without a plate, wrapped in wax paper, which reminded me of food truck presentation. Not more \"sophisticated\" in my book, but why make that kind of comparison in the first place? Mimi's, did you want to create a hierarchy within your great tasting food?So I'd still recommend Mimi's for delicious food and great atmosphere, but if you're a vegetarian/vegan/have dietary restrictions, look at the menu before you decide to return.

You can get the ouzi with lamb, chicken, beef or vegi. It comes with yogurt cucumber salad. Ive only seen this dish on one other menu before. A good dish for sharing. The spinich pie is very different then anyone's I ever had. They use a lot of onions to get great flavor. The tubuleh salad is perfect \u00a0for me when I want to eat light. I also love the hummas, Babaghaunuj and the mjaddarah. My meat eating friends are crazy about the chicken and lamb dishes. They come with a very delish rice. The rice is cooked in a vegi broth that gives it wonderful flavor. They make the hummas fresh everyday & chop the tubuleh salad only after you order it. That is extra work and not common.

I really wanted to try their falafel plate but unfortunately really wasn't that hungry hence my first sentence. The waitstaff was incredibly friendly, I ordered a loomi (Egyptian drink) and it was my first time having it. After I tried it the waiter came up to me and said that if I didn't like it he would exchange it for another at no cost!
