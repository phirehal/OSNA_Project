I usually get the dinner special, samosas and saag paneer, which comes with nan and various chutneys. Indian delivery is my comfort food (Bad day at work? Guys don't return my calls? Disappointing political news? Indian.) so I like it to be fresh, hot, and brimming with spicy/savory goodness.The samosas are always perfectly crispy, a feat not to be taken lightly. They make their vegetarian dishes just a little spicy, so that you can temper them with the little bit of raita (yogurt) you get. All the entrees I've tried have \u00a0been tasty: Chana masala, chicken tikka, rogan josh, and aloo gobi are all solid bets. Anything with a sauce will satisfy you; they really do a good job with the flavor on those dishes. Plus, they really give you a lot of food, and you know what that means? Leftovers!!!

The delivery guy was very friendly and I worried that the curry wouldn't be spicy enough. Oh, but it was! The spice level of the vindaloo is fantastico - hot enough to feel the heat, but not so hot that you can't taste the dish. Nommy. Basmati rice was also excellent.Could very well be my go-to delivery place for decent Indian food."], ["Carolyn H.", "Not sure why the rating is so high. Ordered some delivery for lunch yesterday. While the price was decent, the food was very meh. It also didn't come with naan, which was kind of weird. I found their food to be overly sweet.

It was overall unsatisfying."], ["Linda S.", "Like many other yelpers I also got the $20 for $40 yelp deal. While it's worth it with the discount, I don't think I'd go here again without it.To be honest, I was not impressed with the chicken tikka masala that the menu claims is top seller. The chicken breast pieces that I got were dry. Other dishes we tried were the Kerala Boatman 's Crab Curry, which was surprisingly PACKED with crab meat, and the saag paneer. The mango lassis here are nice. In total, we ordered the three curries, plus three mango lassis, and a keema (ground lamb) and cheese nan. Without the discount, our order would've been $48 (tax and tip not included). With the discount, we paid $28! Otherwise though, there are better Indian restaurants in the neighborhood."], ["Rachel M.", "I ordered delivery. If you have never eaten here before, try to get the lunch special, it's about 13$ for an entree and samosas. The food here is terrible. The samosas have NO flavor, which I think is an incredible feat considering that it is an Indian restaurant. The texture of the pastry reminds me of a ritz cracker. I actually couldn't even eat it. I got the chicken tikka masala, and asked for it to be spicy. It was incredibly mild and also sweet. I've never had tikka masala that was sweet before so it was incredibly off putting. I was so pissed because I was so hungry and I wasted it on terrible food."], ["RoseAnn B.", "Absolutely delightful from start to finishWe ordered appetizer, bread, fish and vegetables... didn't expect so much food and it was so good I couldn't stop eating.

Good for 3-4 people and might fill you up because it's so doughy. Love the chickpeas and tamarind flavors.Entrees:Beef saagwala- not the best I've had, but it was very good. Out of the three things I got, I'd recommend this first.Lamb makhani- not overly spicy, but the lamb was very tender and fell apart without too much chewingMango chicken- off the daily specials. Too sweet, not very Indian-tasting. But acceptable.Service:Impeccable. Not a single water glass was unfilled at any point, and we received rice pudding on the house at the end of our meal.

I love spicy food so much that usually at least one of my meals every day is spicy... but their vindaloo was almost more than I could handle!My boyfriend and I found this place on Yelp, and we used the $20 for $40 deal they've got going on right now. \u00a0We're both pretty frugal people normally, so it felt strange to have the ability to order not only main courses, but appetizers and desserts and sides as well. \u00a0Take advantage of that deal while they still have it because you get a LOT of food for that amount.The service was very attentive (they refilled my water frequently, which I was thankful for given that I was working up a sweat with the vindaloo), although the waiter seemed kind of weirded out by my request to have the vindaloo without the lamb haha (I'm vegetarian). \u00a0The place itself isn't super fancy, but it's pleasant and has a relaxed atmosphere.Anyway, this place is the bomb, so you should go eat there--and go quick before the deal expires!"], ["Adam B.", "Everything was delicious!

The reason I return to this place over and over again (aside from the fact that I have a weekly appointment in the neighborhood) is the naan and the poori. Whatever they are doing with their oven, they are doing well! The bread comes puffy and light yet still with the crispy bite on the bottom which makes it so delicious. The food is not like that gloppy Indian food where everything tastes the same, each dish is unique in its flavorings, and the chicken is not all dry breast meat. I especially like their appetizers.

We were looking for a vegan place where there is other food too and this fit the bill. Well-seasoned dishes: we had the okra, the dal and the cauliflower and chicken vindaloo.

For entrees, the vegetable jalfrazi was very good, actually, nice sauce and a good variety of fresh (not frozen) vegetables. The malai kofta was weird, almost no tomato flavor in the sauce and really heavy on the coriander -- the vegetable dumplings were pretty blech. The nan and rice were fine.

We had ordered chicken biryani, lamb biryani, matter paneer, chicken tikka, and chicken tikka masala. All dishes were very spicy as we had ordered it to be. Watch out when ordering spicy, our food had us tearing and sweating. We like it like that so it was good for us. The food came out very quickly(we were the only people there). Why I didn't give 5 stars: The server brought out everyone's food except one's and so our food was getting cold while we waited 5 minutes for it to arrive. Also, the chicken tikka masala's curry was a bit too sweet and tangy.Overall, I would come here again and do recommend it."], ["Ce T.", "Everyone in the neighborhood loves them, authentic, rich flavors here. Anything you order here will be delicious and worth it. Dine-in is private and simple- hardly anyone there. The staff are very accommodating."], ["Lisa F.", "Well, let me start out my review by saying this... I placed my order at 8:22pm. It is now 10:09pm, and my food finally showed up. That means almost 2 hours to deliver. This is after I called the restaurant at 9:30, asking where my food was, they told me they had the wrong address, and that my food would be there in \"a minute\" - my food didn't show up til 40 minutes later - 1 hour and 50 mins. waiting time, total. If that wasn't bad enough, when I called to check up on my order, I actually heard the owner pick up and hang up on me - not once, not twice, but 6 times in the course of 10 minutes! Not cool, India House.On *top* of that, upon opening my delivery bag, I realized the raita that I ordered wasn't included.That's already 3 strikes, and I haven't even begun my meal! I was really hoping this food would blow my mind to make up for terrible delivery, lacking raita, and rude worker who answers... or should I say, refuses to answer... their phone.Anyway, moving onto the food. The mulligatwany soup was delicious. In my opinion, a perfectly slightly-sweet tomato mixed with oil and lentil. I can see how some might say that the tomato is too sweet - definitely sweeter than most mulligatawny - some might even go so far as to compare it to sugary Spaghetti-O sauce. They have a fair argument there, and normally that would turn me off, but for some reason, this works. The lentils were also a little under-cooked, but the flavors pulled the soup together so nicely that I was able to look past it. I'd recommend this. 3/5I ordered chicken madras, with \"medium\" spiciness. \u00a0For $12 I received a pint-sized wonton-soup container full of chicken (I'd say about $6 worth) - \u00a0that was so horrifically dry, that it felt like I was chewing on leather. The fact that it was in a literal tub of sauce didn't even help. And not just dry, but not spicy, either. I understand that choosing \"medium\" spiciness is a lesser degree than choosing \"super hot\" spiciness, but this wouldn't even be labeled as mildly spicy. I think the best description, sadly, would be \"flat-out bland\".The chana shag was a complete disappointment. There were, at most, 8 or 9 chickpeas in the entire dish. The spinach was so sickeningly sweet that I couldn't even get halfway through it. There was no spice to it whatsoever. Not to mention, the restaurant gave me an absolute pathetic amount of rice - didn't even fill the container up.The \"specialty\" naan that we ordered, which supposedly included cheese and keema (meat), had absolutely no meat or cheese- in it, or on it. It was plain naan, with a handful of scallions on top. There was no pappadam with our order, and all 3 condiment containers (your average size) were half full.When they finally delivered my raita at 10:35pm (did I mention that I placed my original order at 8:22pm?), it was SWEET! Almost tasted like rice pudding, without the rice! For those that don't know raita, it's the equivalent of greek tatziki and is made with yogurt and lemon juice (just to show you how *not* sweet it's supposed to be). And the amount I received was the size of a condiment container! Are you really charging people for this?My bottom line is this - unless the owner of this restaurant read this review, felt absolutely horrible, and called me to offer me a refund on everything I just stuffed in the fridge (which will eventually be thrown out, because most of it is so lacking in taste that it's inedible), then, and only then, would I give this place a second chance. I just dropped $30 on food, and am *starving* at 11pm, because this stuff was so awful. And being so rude as to hang up on me every time I tried to call to find out the status of my order - after it's been over an hour - that's not just unprofessional, that's unacceptable.I was going to say that this was the worst Indian food that I've had in Brooklyn, but the more I think about it, the more I can honestly say that it's the worst Indian food I've had in NYC. And worst delivery experience, too! No thanks, India House. I'll take my business elsewhere."], ["Sally A.", "SO good. India house has quickly become one of my favorites. I will say that when I order the chicken tikka masala it sometimes lacks enough chicken. The masala sauce itself is excellent though, so i don't mind \u00a0having a little extra to dip naan or rice in. Delivery is always prompt and they have good combo specials."], ["Grace I.", "This is the best place to have Indian food in Crown Heights, according to my experience. The place itself, though modest, is atmospheric, pleasant, and cosy--with neat red walls and tablecloths. As a vegetarian I almost always order in Indian restaurants Saag Panir--spinach with cheese. At India House they agreed to make it without additional cream, which makes the dish not heavy and really tasty. I'd say it is the best I've had in a very, very long time. Also the mixed vegetable curry was excellent. The man in the front desk who handles all the orders (and there seems to be a lot of them) is very helpful and polite, and he kindly added a rice pudding to my order without additional charge.

I always find some manner of freebie every time I order, usually extra papadam since I mentioned how much I enjoy it to the staff.Biggest mark in their favor and the reason I had to give them 5 stars is that their Chicken Tikka is never dry. Chicken Tikka is my wife's go to for indian food, but it's usually overcooked and a touch dry everywhere we go, but they always make the Chicken Tikka fresh for every order at India House, so while it takes about an extra 10-15 minutes longer compared to other nearby Indian restaurants (which they always remind me of when I order it) it is worth the wait.Tikka Masala is my default and it was flavorful and moist. Vindaloo is truly spicy, and if you request extra spicy, they defnitely will put a boot in it.The Jalfreezi is full of fresh, tasty vegetables. The garlic and onion nan is very flavorful.

They left a menu on my doorstep so I gave them a chance. The first two times the delivery service was quick and friendly and the food was pretty good. The last two times the delivery service has called me instead of ringing my doorbell, and talked really fast with an indian accent that I could not understand.

I tipped him well for his troubles because he was still nice when he came to the door.

I looked out my window and he was standing at his moped, but not coming to the door. I waited until he walked toward my door and waited for him to ring the bell and he didn't. I then called him back to see if he was having trouble and he started to yell at me about the rain. THEN he went back to his moped for some reason instead of coming upstairs while I buzzed him in. When he finally came upstairs, I was apologetic and said that I couldn't understand him and that I was sorry and he started yelling at me saying \"What don't you understand? Why can't you understand? Look at me? I am all wet from the rain!\" He continued to yell some more which I couldn't really understand, so I said I was sorry, signed the receipt and when he got the receipt back he says \"You still don't understand, nevermind\" all annoyed. I still do not understand why he was so upset with me. Yes, I ordered delivery on a rainy night. MANY PEOPLE DO. I was planning on tipping him well because of the rain (I still gave him over 20%).

I called my bf uttering one sentence...\"We're having Indian tonight.\"I called and placed the order about half an hour before their closing time, mostly because I was researching the dishes online. I finally gave my order. For 1 main seafood dish and an all day special it came out to 32 bucks. I thought it was bit pricey and once I got the food the portions didn't match the cost. I kept scanning the menu after ordering and wanted their version of garlic bread. I called back and told them to charge it on the card I had ordered with. He said no problem or at least I thought so, since his accent was very hard to understand. The food came quickly and the guy called once he was here. He kept repeating himself over and over on the phone but I could not understand this guy for the life of me. I was so embarrassed because he kept talking and I just kept going \"huh\" over and over again. To end the confusion I just ran down and got the food. Went to sign and this dude did not have a pen. Now I live on the 3rd floor so now we both have to go back up (no elevator!) so I can get a stupid pen that you should have. The whole time he's asking me if I'm good which I can only understand as \"Are you ok with all the mess about the pen\" and I answer politely with a yes. Then come to find out the bread was not added. He handed me his manager on the phone and I quickly told her I would add it to the tip. The guy misunderstood and was disappointed once he figured half of his tip was to make up for the bread that wasn't charged to me. But oh well you were confusing me anyway.Now to the food! It was actually pretty good. The shrimp pathia was alot more spicy than I was prepared for but it was delicious nonetheless. The garlic naan was warm and fragrant.

The chicken tikka was very good, though even for an appetizer it was a little small: just 4 chunks of chicken on a bed of onions, cucumber, and tomatoes.

My taste buds are dulled and my nose is stuffed and I could still feel the burn.

This place makes you feel like a king with how polite and customer-service-oriented the waiters behave and are dressed.

I'm a big fan of spicy Vindaloo, my girlfriend always gets the one with the bananas in it (forgot the name, don't have their meny on hand and the one up here on Yelp is NOT the full menu!) Bananas in a curry?! Sounds weird, but trust me, it's GRRRREAT!-While I usually prefer to dine in for the whole classy vibe of the place, their delivery has always been on point. Like all delivery, you lose the presentation (they do that really well!) because everything's crammed into plastic containers, but the food still tastes great and I've never had it arrive cold - but then again, I live like 2 blocks away.-Since Indian food is 'trendy' a lot of Indian restaurants will charge $15-$18 for an entree.

The food took forever to come but when it did, it was well cooked and fresh off the grill.My pet peeves: I'm not sure if someone called out for the night or if they usually are not busy but there seemed to be 3 people on staff that night: 1 person cooking, 1 person making deliveries, and one person waiting tables/answering phones. This annoyed me because it made the service a little slow, keep in mind, there was only one other party in the whole place and service was still slow. If the food wasn't so damn good I'd give this place two stars. The delivery dude continuously opened the door, understandably, but this invited the 15 degree weather to come in and greet us which wasn't fun. All in all, if you want amazing authentic Indian food for a good price. Please do come here. It is worth the wait. I will be back here since the food is delicious and since it's right in the neighborhood :) Honestly, even if it wasn't in my neighborhood I'd make the effort to come back. That's how good the food is!"], ["Sumyia H.", "I got the chicken tikka masala and requested the waiter to make it spicy. Since I ordered the lunch special it also came with warm naan and basmati rice. I really didn't expect the food to be as flavorful and delicious as it was! I dipped the warm naan into the tikka masala sauce and it was just perfection! Service was also really prompt. At the end we were given a complimentary sweet dish called kheer which was a perfect way to cool down my pallet after my spicy meal lol. I will seriously be coming back here if I'm ever in the neighborhood!"], ["Mark M.", "This place is simply amazing. Brought my fianc\u00e9e's Indian family here, and they loved it.

An Indian restaurant that's actually owned and operated by Indian people. The food is great. I got the chicken tikka masala with Naan, as I don't like basmati rice and it was amazing. It had a ton of flavor and they gave me enough to last two days. I'll definitely be going back for the samosas and the mango lassi was also AMAZING. The pricing was right, the staff was great and welcoming when I went in there to pick up my food. When it comes to the atmosphere of the restaurant it's definitely casual, it's nothing fancy, but that's how I like it anyway. I didn't actually sit down and eat in but it's just what I noticed while I was there. Anyway, I'm definitely going to order from this place again, I highly recommend."], ["Jennifer A.", "Decent service, maybe it was just a busy lunch hour that they forgot about our check. I can appreciate that they don't rush you when it comes to serving each meal. The lunch specials under $10 is a great deal, it comes with naan and the curry is pretty good. I've tried one of their poori which was delicious (onions and parsley), soft, fluffy and well seasoned. I'll be back to try their other tandoori dishes; their salmon was on point."], ["Nwade O.", "It's a small hidden Gem that I found walking to work one day. There tiki chicken masala is on point.

I find that the flavors and prices are better than those at the places that are tagged as Indian Restaurant.Aside from taste the way the food is sold is also different. You pick the size container you want for a certain side and you buy the side. Typically I opt the the smallest container and pick four different sizes this ends up costing $12 including the fresh naan. I always opt out of the salad because I don't care for it and I never buy the rice since the bread is better.I have never stayed to eat because the place seems more like a locals spot ....

A side salad comes with the meals that has a riata dressing that is super yummy (no sugar added, don't know why so many places add sugar to the riata). Order at the counter and eat in but save a few dollars not having to tip a waiter, which makes it a great place for stopping in often and filling your tummy with delicious food. Only thing is, I prefer my food pretty spicy and that's not going to happen here bc the food is pre-prepared.

I've been there twice and tried different things and were all delicious and true to the cuisine. Really good naan bread, chicken biryanni, mango lassi and of course an outstanding rasmalai to finish the meal. Inexpensive and spot on. My only suggestion to the restaurant is that they should invest in real plates and silverware for the patrons that choose to dine in. The styrofoam plates and plastic utensils are annoying to use, really bad for the environment \u00a0and should only be reserved for the to go orders.

We had a variety of items: naan, butter chicken, daal, chana, and some other things we just pointed to because they looked great. Everything was so flavorful and perfectly spicy. The service was great and everyone was super friendly. The best part is the kulfi cardamom flavored ice pops near the door. \u00a0We wished we grabbed a few for the freezer. They are the best I've ever had. This place was a win and we'll definitely be back.Tips: there's a counter where you order and the food is in hot trays. You can eat there or take it to go.

One hour and forty minutes. That is neither hyperbole nor exaggeration. One hour and forty minutes. \u00a0  \u00a0Just after our third phone call, by coincidence, the food arrives. It is ice cold.

The kick that usually comes with these dishes was missing entirely. \u00a0Even a staple like samosas were just mediocre.

She did a better job being attentive.The prices of the food were reasonable and the flavor was great. Appetizer we got was chicken Tikka. The chicken was so moist you put a fork in it and it'd break apart. Then we got Behl Per? It was served cold and it had 2 flavors, one that tasted liked a light bbq sauce and another like a cilantro spicy lime sauce mixed with veggies and chutney.Entree I had a Korma. The texture of the sauce was a light slightly dense buttery melt in your mouth almond sauce and the chicken moist as well.Don't be fooled by the small bowls.

Asya offers the sloppy pav only for lunch, only on weekdays, and only for delivery (no sloppy pav for dine-in customers). This limits the enjoyment of this piece of divinity to those who work near downtown Brooklyn... and to the likes of me! Once again, I procured a hotel room in Brooklyn Heights, worked remotely from Brooklyn on a Friday, and ordered three beef sloppy pavs for delivery. The sloppy pav is an Indian take on sloppy joe sliders. The mini buns are stuffed with tender and moist short rib that is braised with spices and black cardamom, which makes it flavorful and aromatic. It comes with masala chips and a side of jalapeno aioli. I requested the restaurant not to put lettuce and tomato on my pavs (those \"veggies\" just don't belong in a sloppy pav). I also requested an extra side of the jalapeno aioli, which I added to my already moist and tasty sloppy pav; and that, my friends, took it to yet another level of deliciousness!

The service is okay but not 5 star. Seems like a family business. No runner or bus person in sight. Just a couple working the floor for about a dozen tables. I stood at the door for a minute or two before getting seated; the couple was racing back and forth with barely time to turn the music on. I ordered the sprouted moong beans appetizer, the stuffed eggplant, garlic naan and a glass of Pinot noir. My body was craving something raw and the sprouts hit the spot. The eggplant dish was full of well-blended flavors that would make foodies question the spices. The wine went well with both. The garlic naan added to the flavor without being drippy with butter. It was dry but ready to melt a pad of butter. With the tomato base of the eggplant dish, it didn't need any oils. There are not many Indian restaurants that I like. What I ordered here beats everything I've had in the 3 or 4 places I've been to on 6th Street in the city. And the couple really cares. One day maybe they will have a runner or busperson.

The daily special ($14 for an appetizer + entree + rice + naan + sauce) is an awesome cheaper option. I've tried the Chicken Tikka Masala, the Chicken Bhuna, and the Matar Panir. All are great. Basically, I'm stoked about this place."], ["Maria V.", "Mix seafood curry (salmon and shrimp) was good. It had 2 pcs of salmon 2 inches by 1 inches and 3 pcs of shrimp. Place was clean with good ambiance. Ras malai and gulab jamon was the worst I've ever had. It tasted \u00a0processed and not authentic. Overall, place was okay. Will not go back there again though."], ["Mary V.", "This place just opened on my block and I tried takeout from them for the first time. \u00a0I got mixed seafood biryani and bhindi (okra) masala. \u00a0Both were really good and that says a lot because I'm Indian and have a high bar. \u00a0The place looked standard for an Indian restaurant on the inside and the staff seemed very friendly and excited about their new business - it was a pleasure to give them some! \u00a0There isn't any Indian food in the hood, this is a welcome addition. \u00a0It's BYOB which is so great because there's a wine store right next door"], ["Vanessa C.", "Very impressed with this new place! Finally good Indian food in Brooklyn.Everything we had was fresh and delish.But the lamb vindaloo stole the show !perfectly done really hot and spicy the way it should be.Also the garlic naan was a winner.Our server was so nice and attentive.we did bring our own wine which we purchased next door( but my advice is bring a good bottle from somewhere else as next door is very limited and not great , but it did the job) .we look forward to our next visit .We left feeling full ,happy and satisfied!"], ["HanNa W.", "Best Indian food in the neighborhood. \u00a0I always get the chana masala and Manchurian gobi - delicious! \u00a0Very generous servings as well. \u00a0Have also tried their chicken tikka masala, very good as well. \u00a0They give a small serving of the rice pudding with every order. \u00a0It is so good I actually ordered a full portion last time. \u00a0Much needed addition to the neighborhood."], ["Marge C.", "Very good meal. Food was fresh, well prepared and looked and tasted delicious. Service was excellent. Only problem is I am so full right now!!"], ["Dana C.", "new restaurant in our neighborhood, very tasty affordable food - we had Lamb Korma - delicious - and Saag Panir with all the yummy extras. \u00a0Very friendly and helpful staff. We will definitely be back!"], ["Winnie R.", "This is for delivery: it took about 45 minutes on a Wednesday night and was delicious and plentiful and cheap. I ordered the \"daily special,\" from which you can choose an appetizer and entree from a dozen options of each. I ordered, based on the recommendations, ka-chori as well as saag paneer. Both were excellent and came with many condiments, rice, naan and dessert."], ["Alison J.", "Great service. Decor is pleasant and thoughtful. \u00a0Satisfying portions. I ordered the sagg aloo and chicken samosas. Both were tasty and delicious. 25% Discount at lunch made the pricing very reasonable."], ["Omar F.", "The best indian food I've ever had. They are just awesome.."], ["MJ S.", "I am generally very picky when it comes to Indian food. \u00a0Masala Grill does it right! \u00a0So delicious-authentic and fresh. Excited to have such a great new restaurant walking distance from my apartment."], ["JaimeLee R.", "We ordered from Masala Grill for the first time last night and we'll definitely be doing it much more. The food was SO TASTY!! We had a large order too and they packaged our To Go order quickly and efficiently (no mess in the bags). And I can't believe how quickly it got here. One of our guests actually made a mistake ordering their food (we used Seamless) and Masala was quick to rectify it, in a friendly manner to boot. Love this place."]]}
