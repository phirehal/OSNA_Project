It suddenly occurred to me that during my order, I forgot to add in all of the burrito essentials - sour cream, salsa and guacamole. Welcome back to the world of non-assembly line fast burrito world.

I did not think the tacos were very good, the chicken curry one was okay but I did not like the fish taco. Perhaps next time I will try a burrito, since that seems to be what they are famous for. Another odd thing I noticed is that either the bar is higher than usual or the chairs are too short, so I felt like I was a little kid at a big table, having to raise my elbows awkwardly to eat (I am 5 foot 7, I'm not a shorty).

I am a Texan. La Nop is suffice, but they are no Tex Mex. Food is just ok. They don't have sour cream enchiladas which I think is so strange. They always bring a plate out with your food that has a big ol' plop of sour cream on top of shredded lettuce with a big slice of tomato (weird, right?). When we first moved here their salsa was much better-something happened and it is not the same, it lacks spice. This being said I don't totally dislike La Nop, and it's the closest thing to a Tex Mex restaurant in Jax. Honestly, I feel like Chipoltes or Chilis represents Mexi food a lot more.

It could be because I'm from California and a little picky about my Mexican food or because of La Nop being in the news for some big problem when I first arrived in town.

We loved the crispy thin tortilla chips and the salsa. We both ordered the Tacos Especial which comes with 3 corn tortilla tacos with your choice of meat. We ordered carnitas (pork) and asada (grilled beef). Anyone can do chicken - I like to judge a Mexican restaurant by these two standards. The tacos came with a plate of Mexican rice (rice cooked in tomato sauce) and refried beans, and a condiment plate for each of us with a quarter of lime, chopped onions, cilantro, and a salsa verde that was really good and had a nice little kick to it. Because each taco came with 2 corn tortillas, it was really like having 6 tacos per plate since there is enough meat to split each taco. Also, a word about the tortillas - I was so happy that (a) the server did not ask me if I wanted flour or corn tortilla because IT SHOULD BE A CORN TORTILLA and (b) the tortillas are heated with grill marks instead of being served cold like Tex Mex places tend to do. Our meats were both really tasty and flavorful. The carnitas did have a chunk of fat in them (as commented on by a preview Yelper) but you know what? Just take that piece out if you don't want it. We took home enough leftovers for at least another meal!The service was fast and our server checked on us a few times. You get the check then pay up front at the register.

This is a bit pricer than say, chipotle, but it's super fast, extra fresh and other all better for the price for the amount and quality. My only complaint is that the size of the to-go guac seems to vary a lot in size, generally seeming smaller than in the restaurant. Sorry I can't say much more about the food besides rave about guacamole!"], ["Jaye T.", "When I walked in to get on the list (more on that in a moment), it was like walking into a concert in full swing. I was supposed to be here for a date and I could not imagine trying to get to know someone over dinner and drinks... and that noise. I also can't imagine trying to spend time with my friends in that sonic cyclone. Cantina: invest in some acoustic panels. Seriously.I walked up to the hostess stand and greeted her. She looked at me like she had no idea why I was there. No welcome, no greeting back, just a blank stare. \"So, is there a waiting list?\" She responded that there was.... and then nothing else. \"Can I get on it, please?\" Oh, of course. At this point, there was no \"of course\" about it. I wasn't sure she even knew where she was. Seemed like a sweet kid, so maybe just overwhelmed. That's a management oversight, if they're not adequately training or supporting her.Then at 7 PM on a Tuesday, I was handed a notification device and told it would be 50 minutes. \"Fifteen?\" I asked. \"One-five?\" It was so loud I wasn't sure I'd heard her correctly.\"No, fifty.\"\"Five-zero,\" I confirmed.\"Yes.\"\"Okay.\" If I hadn't agreed to meet my date here, I'd have left then. But he was parking and we'd agreed, so I took the pager and stepped back outside. Even in the Florida summer, it was refreshing to close the door behind me. My ears were ringing. Luckily, my date arrived and had a similar reaction to the noise level and wait time. We turned in the pager and went to Wasabi instead.The two stars aren't for the wait, it should be noted. They are for the noise level and the poor service, one each. Why restaurants think \"louder is better' is absolutely beyond me. When I'm out having a social occasion with my friends, I don't want to have to wear ear plugs like it's Freebird Live and I don't want to go home with a sore throat from screaming at them like a lunatic all evening.I don't care how good the food is. I looked at the menu online: it's overpriced (probably because of the location and the trendy factor); it's loud; and it's got staffing issues."], ["Pam S.", "We always search for one of these restaurants and we were so happy there was one in Jacksonville.

I'd have rated the place more stars, but you have to go and hunt for a place to park and CL could make it easier by placing a sign at the intersection showing that there is free valet parking (this way), hunting for a spot took the fun out of it.

Steak on one side, chicken on the other with a pile of lettuce, tomato, beans, sour cream, cheese, and guacamole. Very simple, yet very satisfying. I ordered the two taco, rice, and beans combo which was meh. My girlfriend and roommate ordered the Cazuela Las Tapitias, which is basically a cavalcade of meats cooked with tomatoes, green peppers, and onions and served fajita style with corn tortillas. Oh. My. God. It's amazing. They ordered the potion \"for two\" but it's easily enough for 3-4 people, even without the nachos beforehand. We ended up taking about a 3 lb. box home.

I know people tend to use \"they were the best I've ever had\" a lot, but these nachos are a serious contender. We could have made a complete meal out of these for two people and almost bumped heads about five times hovering over the plate for big bites. Amazing. We were both pretty full about 1/4 of the way through, but went ahead and ordered entrees anyway: I had the Chili Colorado, beef chunks smothered in red chili sauce and the boy went for the carnitas. The Chili Colorado was tender, only a tad spicy, and salty, which when placed on a fresh tortilla made for a perfect balance. The carnitas were a bit dry, compared to everything else, but had a great flavor.... and honestly we were still thinking about those nachos.

Paired with salsa (I added some yucateco hot sauce from the bottle on the table) and ice cold Negra Modelo's it was a satisfying lunch."], ["Samantha K.", "I really like lupitas. The service is friendly and fast, the food tastes authentic, and the prices are good--especially the lunch specials. I love their beans and rice. Chips and salsa come automatically to the table when you sit down. The atmosphere is nothing fancy but it goes with the food and prices."], ["Ruby A.", "My niece and I were craving Mexican food, so I Yelped the nearest Mexican restaurant and ended up sitting our happy butts in this lil joint. \u00a0I had the tacos al pastor, which was soooo yummy!!! Will come back when I'm around that area :)"], ["Nina I.", "Family business, with one waitress. \u00a0She dosnt speak much English. We have visited here a few times. \u00a0Recommend visiting during lunch hours, or if they are busy. \u00a0 Food is freshly prepared. \u00a0When I am craving 'real' tacos (not crappy taco bell tacos) this is the place to go. \u00a0The salsa is yummy too."], ["Erin K.", "My new favorite Mexican restaurant. I had the chicken taco salad and flan-- both delicious and fresh."], ["Jay S.", "Perhaps it's because I moved here from sunny San Diego where you can get real authentic Mexicsn food, but this ain't it folks.In the rather dicey Arlington/university area in a kinda run down building, this sit down restaurant is pleasant inside and the waitress that served me was very sweet natured.She served a basket of a bit greasy and stale tortilla chips along with a bottle of salza...mostly chopped tomatoes with a touch of onion and cilantro.I ordered a steak burrito lunch plate that consisted of mostly shredded lettuce, some Spanish rice with a small dollop of cream fresca and chunky guacamole. The burritto should be more accurately described as a burrittocito it was so small, doused with an odd cheese sauce and partially filled with bland chopped steak of some kind.Lunch prices were good but Chipotle is a much better food value.With these great reviews here on Yelp for Lupitas \u00a0I was hoping to find myself a good Mexican but I doubt I will be back anytime soon."], ["Steve Z.", "Visiting from Cincinnati and gave Lupita's a repeat visit. \u00a0Excellent Mexican food; huge California Burrito and perfect Relleno with right level of spiciness as two examples. \u00a0All five in our party (who are picky and not easy to please) were happy and full. \u00a0The service was incredibly slow however - maybe they were just short staffed. \u00a0Will continue however to pick Lupita's for Mexican when we are in town."], ["Eric S.", "I've been to this place numerous times and food taste good to great most of the time. It tastes home cooked and like the steak quasadilla the best. Many Hispanic folks go here too so that seems to be a good sign. However, service can really be slow during lunch hour as they seem understaffed. Oh, parking space is also relatively small"], ["Lauria T.", "Best Mexican We've found in Jax! \u00a0Family run with a really good chef. Homemade corn tortillas! Yummy! We go all the time. Super affordable too."], ["Harrison J.", "Lupita's Mexican Food is a great Mexican place. I simply love Lupitas. The food is great and the staff is quick and courteous. Summary: this place is great. Go there for lunch with a few friends, get a fish taco, rice, and beans. Enjoy the good Mexican good.Read on for more detailed review: Food: I suggest the fish tacos. They are amazing. They are all I order nowadays. The fish is crispy and lightly fried. Also, the tamales are quite tasty. What ever you get, get it with a side of rice and beans. My only issue with the food is that the enchiladas and the burritos look and taste the same. Drink: Sodas and water come in a giant cup (ie, you aren't going to need a refill) which is nice if you like your soda. I haven't tried the beer there but I imagine they are priced well. Refills come quickly.Staff: the staff is nice. They are quick to take your order and they are quick to bring the bill. Atmosphere: the place generally doesn't have many people in but don't let that put you off. There are plenty of places to sit down. The place is a bit dark. Parking: Parking @ Lupitas is a bit tricky. They have their own lot in front but there is no dedicated turn lane to turn into the lot from the other side of the street. Keep this in mind, you may choose to use the middle lane anyway. The traffic can be bad so be prepared."], ["John F.", "I've lived in San Diego most of my life and I can testify that this is the best Mexican food in Jacksonville and probably all of Florida. If you like real Mexican, try this place."], ["Jennifer V.", "I love this place. Being half Spanish half Mexican and to find real mexican food is great they are very friendly and the portions are great!"]], "Lola's Burrito Joint": [["l b.", "The empanadas are very tasty and equivalent to about 3 regular size ones! A good deal and nice appetizer. I can't wait to go again to try the other varieties of this tasty treat. The fish taco was average; nothing special in the flavors or preparation. The fish was improved by the sauce but couldn't stand alone. My fiance enjoyed his giant burrito, which he ate nearly 2/3 of and took the rest home. Neat atmosphere with the recycled auto art on the walls."], ["Andrew G.", "By far one of my favorite places in the Riverside area! Great food, love the tacos the most! \u00a0And great drinks, even tried a one of a kind guacamole tequila shot one night. \u00a0We come anytime day or night and get great service."], ["Trixy G.", "2nd time...amazing macho nacho...Chooie'sChimmy ..mex. Street corn..shut up...I have a food buzzzzz...food & atmosphere a 5...service a 3.5.."], ["Billy D.", "This restaurant is truly something special! \u00a0The entire staff (bartenders, servers, kitchen staff and the owner) consistently go the extra mile to ensure the food is excellent, drinks are fantastic and hospitality is first class."], ["Mailena O.", "The food is good but the customer service is awful!!! You don't tell people in wheelchairs that they cannot be at the end of the booth as it was blocking the servers from accessing the tables. Walk around!!!!! Seriously!!!! You are a public establishment that should be able to serve your customers able bodied or not!"], ["Kathleen P.", "Great service! I had the shrimp but no papers burrito and it was exceptional! My husband and I shared the chips and queso and it was so good I took the leftover dip home!"], ["Thais A.", "Worst staff ever! Honestly, the food here is pretty good. I've had their pineapple salsa and chips, the skinny fries and the chicken nachos. Everything was delicious and so were the drinks. Nicely prepared and the combinations are super unique. With all this being said I don't think I will be coming back again. The first time I came here it was a 45 minutes before closing. The server was non-existant. Kept rushing us to put in an order practically kicked us out the door after we paid our bill. I was pissed but I understood where they were coming from. This week I tried the place out again. I cam in the afternoon, around 3pm. There was no one at the front so I looked at the bartender and he told me to sit wherever I liked. I waited 10 minutes before the server came over to the table. I ordered a beer and again waited another 15 minutes before the beer arrived. I asked the bartender to switch the channel and it took him 20 minutes to find the time to do so. They were not busy. I counted a total of 5 tables in the restaurant including the table outside. Everyone just had a lousy attitude. Like they were having the worst day of their lives and the last thing they wanted to do was be there. I'm not sure who owns this place or who the manager is but it seems like they need to find a way to treat their employees better. Like I said before, the food is good, but I just cannot handle the poor service and attitude from the staff."], ["Mike P.", "Great little restaurant for anything Mexican! We hit this place for brunch one day and were super surprised of how good it was. Fried corn on the cob, the yucca fries, and probably the best shrimp tacos I've ever had! I would definitely recommend this place morning noon or night and we will definitely be back! Btw, my two children are probably the pickiest eaters I've ever met, and they couldn't get enough of the cheese and meat kids tacos."], ["Leticia C.", "Kitchen service sucked messed up my order three times! Waiter didn't even try to comp bill or discount tab because they're not a 'chain' restaurant, I had to suggest to him to get manager to see b/c that was ridiculous! But they finally decided to split 1/2 of burrito price"], ["Sally K.", "Our go-to spot in Jacksonville. Half off margaritas from 4-7 on weekdays.I recommend the Pablo Cu-cumbian with a dash of extra Tabasco. Also. The cheese dip is super addictive. And the pineapple salsa equally delicious. As far as tacos, try the fish or shrimp taco. Burritos: if on a date, make it interesting and try to split the wet Willie. Empanadas, the sweet potato is yummy with some local hot sauce on top. Seriously. It's all delicious. Friendly staff. Some of the best in Jacksonville."], ["Jason L.", "Great food, great service. \u00a0Got the quesadillas they were excellent. \u00a0Its in Riverside and you can actually park there. We will be back."], ["Caron S.", "After reading many subpar reviews, we were skeptics and stayed clear of Lola's for the last few months. Finally, last night we bit the bullet and were pleasantly surprised.3.5 solid stars. It's not life-shatteringly amazing but it was indeed good, and our food was tasty and portions were generous.While we paid for chips and salsa to start, they were good. We also ordered queso and it was good - thick and way too much for the amount of chips. We couldn't finish it all, even after inhaling the chips.The ragin' cajun gator taco was the standout. My ginger tofu and his carnitas weren't worth ordering again, and were plain. Ragin' cajun is a must! The cabbage isn't shredded on any of them; rather it's cut into small confetti-like cubes. The sweet potato and black bean empanada was another hit: slightly sweet, slightly crunchy, and equally parts delicious. Would order this again.The man had a burrito - which he asked for enchilada sauce and sour cream - both extra costs. Our waitress was nice to let us know this up front before placing the order, after he'd asked for them. The burrito, complete with chips, was massive. He didn't finish it. He also ordered a side of rice, which was an ample serving. Again, too much food.The atmosphere was laid-back and they had a nice beer selection. Our servers and the bussers were friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. It appears they've worked out many of the kinks other reviewers have noted."], ["Kevin L.", "Love the shrimp burrito smothered in queso. You must try the pineapple salsa for the right kick. \u00a0Get there early on Friday because they get a crowd."], ["Kelli P.", "Had the Mexican sweet corn. \u00a0 It has potential based on the menu but fell flat. \u00a0The shrimp taco was not flavorful. \u00a0 Service was just okay. \u00a0Will not be back."], ["Victoria V.", "A great little place in Riverside! My boyfriend and I checked this place out on a whim and we were very pleasantly surprised. The food is awesome and as a plus they have a wide selection of beers. On this go around I had the baa baa baa which is two lamb tacos which were delicious but they could have used just a little less of the yogurt chimichurri sauce. The lamb was cooked nicely and the tortillas tasted nice and fresh. The leaping lizard that he ordered was so good, which if you haven't figured it out, this is a burrito with rice,fried gator, black beans and an amazing cajun ranch sauce. The service was great, especially considering we came in after 7pm on a Saturday night. We will definitely be back to try more of the menu."], ["Anna H.", "Ok I was just here 4 days ago, and this was the week I proclaimed a moratorium on eating out for a spell. \u00a0Well so my \u00a0for resolve. \u00a0It's way overrated anyway. \u00a0 I needed comfort food so I came for the corn and burgers. \u00a0The couple across from us insisted we need to have the deep fried pork chops. \u00a0 That sounded a little too dangerous for me so \u00a0I was compelled to look at something other than burgers. \u00a0My companion only \u00a0there to support me kept it simple. 1 Corn and 1 Baby taco. \u00a0Not me I was emotional and needed food; \u00a01 Corn and the Chillies Relleno; chicken, poblano pepper, deep fried with jalapeno cheese sauce. \u00a0Hell I should have had the fried chops! \u00a0Well being a well \u00a0documented non Mexican food fan I now will happily cross that boarder and expand my thinking. \u00a0Deadly is the onky word that comes to mind. \u00a0And I mean that in the very best way possible. \u00a0Server with the most well seasonedl black beans I have ever tasted and a side of mixed greens covered in the cheese sauce as well. \u00a0WOW....I'm sold. I do have one negative statement, more \u00a0a pet peeve and I will use this experience as the example: \u00a0we both ordered the corn, servers and kitchen staff PAY ATTENTION! !!! \u00a0Don't bring 2 painfully obvious different portion sizes. \u00a0Bring 2 big or 2 small. \u00a0My friend had the big corn and I had this anemic cob that looked to young to be eaten. \u00a0Nevertheless the experience was A#1 and I will rejoice in Mexican fare at Lol as in the near future."], ["Mandie M.", "The first time that I had Lola's it was picked up and taken out. I didn't feel that I could write a review without having actually experienced the place itself. Today was the day that I finally experienced Lola's in a sit-down perspective. I went with a friend and we both ordered burritos. My burrito was tasty. I got the BBQ Chicken with no cheese. It was perfectly spicy and sweet at the same time. If I needed additional spice, there was hot sauce on the table (three different kinds, actually), but it was not required as the burrito was just right. The chips that came with my burrito were an excellent addition as I used them to scoop up any droppings on my plate. The serving is huge and I could only eat one half of my burrito and had to bring the rest home. The only qualm that I have was that my burrito seemed to be on the soggy side. I hope it's not too bad when I go to have the rest for dinner.The waitresses were kind and friendly; very welcoming. The place was packed for lunch, but there were a few open tables left plus the bar. The waitresses did not seem stressed at all with such a full house. As it was in the middle of a week day, I did not partake in any alcohol, although, I did glimpse their drink list and it is huge. I really dig their deco. The Day of the Dead female mannequin on a motorcycle, in the middle of the restaurant, is my absolute fave."], ["Cari B.", "Oh Lola the things you do to that street corn could drive a woman insane !! It's deep fried rolled in some kind of creamy delicious sauce then coated with cheese and sprinkled with cilantro ... Geez so flippen good !! The carnitas taco was very tasty as well . The salsa you do have to pay for but to me it's one of the best in jax so I don't mind . This is def a cool little place with a fun vibe . I'll be back for sure cuz Lola has me wrapped around her little finger w/ that street corn ."], ["Ariel M.", "So I stumble cross this burrito joint after fighting my way out of the mad house that is tacolus out by the beach. Very cozy. First thing you notice is a giant motorcycle hanging from the ceiling. Second thing is the oversized booths (which I'd come back just for that) seriously you can fit at least 8 friends in one. But on to the food. Very speedy prompt service. Clear cut menu. Cost for cheese a little steep but great place to eat. Watch the game and listen to an AWESOME playlist. Definitely come here. We ordered the wet Willie burrito(2lbs of delicious) and mucho nacho with chicken"], ["Jack B.", "Went back last night, as we usually do for this place. we go at least once a week. We had queso, chirizo and chips and a few drinks and that was enough. We normally sit at the bar, but its a great place to sit anywhere and enjoy the atmosphere and people coming and going. Nice to see this neighborhood place doing so well."]]}
