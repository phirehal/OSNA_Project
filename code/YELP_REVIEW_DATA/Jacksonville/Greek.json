Holes in cheap plastic tablecloths, a green patio that a little bleach would cure, huge runs on the carpet....yes carpet in a low key restaurant. I say low key kindly. If I walk in and am greeted by the owner holding a child while making food, it is definitely a low key place. \u00a0I prefer a separate lunch and dinner menu. If you offer appetizers at lunch they should not be as expensive as the entrees. I took the owners advice and got the Greek cheese for $7.99. She was kind enough to offer olive oil when she saw my disappointment when I saw the plate. Huge piece of cheese, two olives, one slice of cucumber, 1 slice of tomato, and warm pita (which was the best part of the dish) \u00a0The portion was very generous but that's about it. Hard to cut, not tons of flavor, etc. If your suggesting this and saying how wonderful it is, put a little thought into the presentation and ease of eating for your guest. Next up was the Greek Lemon Soup. Nice cup of soup, basically chicken and rice with a light lemon flavor. Then I ordered the gyro. I'm in a Greek place, don't really care for fries, can I substitue hummus for them, I don't mind if there is an extra charge. No, you have to buy the appetizer if you want hummus. I wasn't spending $7 for a side of hummus.Total bummer after hearing \"Authentic Greek Restaurant\". Once I saw the Cajun Chicken on the menu I knew it was a farce. The gyro came and was good but needed more of the sauce.I can have more but it is a dollar.Mind you I am here alone and I am calculating my bill to be about $20 at this point. Yes,please nickel and dime me. The gyro was fresh, generous portion, just way too little sauce and way too much onion. \u00a0When you precut an onion and let it sit overnight it takes on a ridiculously strong flavor and smell. I was going to order dessert but they were out of rice pudding and the dessert case was a mess. The cakes were not the least bit appetizing, one piece was even laying on its side in two pieces. \u00a0To sum it up, for a $26 lunch I will not be back.

The meat was pretty good, a little dry but still good. Loved their tzatziki sauce--super garlicky yum! Overall I enjoyed the salad, but from now on I order a regular gyro, or I get a side greek salad with a side of gyro meat (which ends up being more affordable with the same portion of meat and a smaller salad). Also, I love their traditional Greek lemon chicken soup. Very creamy and a great flavor. For just a couple of bucks I always order it to accompany my meal. All in all, I enjoy this place, but I would go there more often for lunch if the prices for their salads was better. I mean $12+ for a salad for a work lunch starts to add up!

A chalkboard near the entrance displayed magical words like \"Collard Greens\" and \"Mac N Cheese,\" and these also comforted me. I grabbed a menu from the counter and WHOA, WAIT, WHAT? It was huge! Omelets, Pitas, Meatloaf, Kibbeh, BBQ Pork, Cubans, Pancakes, Burgers, Taco Salad... I mean, seriously, this menu was crazier than Carly Rae Jepsen.After 45 minutes, I finally decided on the Pulled Pork Cuban Wrap. The owner, Joey, came by to greet us and let us know they took orders at the counter, which was fine. (I just needed to sit for a second and digest that menu!) He also informed us the BBQ meat was fresh off the smoker, which helped me make my decision.Our food came out quickly, and my sandwich looked great, as did the side of Mac N Cheese I just had to order. My pal got the BBQ Omelet, and it was huge! My Mac N Cheese was, in fact, very good, and I'm known to be pretty picky about the mac. My sandwich was kinda just mehhhh though. The meat was nothing special and the cheese had that rubbery thing going on. Oh well, I still enjoyed the first half. My girlfiend's omelet looked good, but when she cut it open we saw it was WAY overloaded with meat -- seriously, like an egg blanket wrapped around a chopped hunk of pork, turkey, AND beef. Whoa.. for breakfast?? Get out the Tums. She said it tasted pretty good despite being a little overwhelming.Joey came back to check on us and we chatted for a bit about the Grill and Jacksonville at large.

Chicken pieces very tender and flavorful. They also removed the pieces from the skewers which made it effortless to eat.

You really can't judge a book by the cover is the motto that I would use with this place. The outside appearance of the strip mall where this restaurant is located is deceiving because the inside decor is really well put together. The inside was very clean and nicely arranged. The ambiance created by red walls (#50shadesofgrey) mixed in with the fresh flowers at the table and slightly dimmed lights give a nice ROMANTIC vibe. I would really recommend this place for a date!The service that I experienced wasn't as pleasant as other reviewers may have experienced. My date and I went there around 8pm, and the restaurant wasn't too busy. But, I believe our waiter was maybe new or maybe they were short staffed at that time because the wait to get our order placed was pretty excessive (~20mins). There was also times where my glass of water stayed emptied for a period of time. HOWEVER, when the waiters were there, they were super friendly and nice. I would HIGHLY recommend the MIXED GRILL! Each one of the grilled meats were very TENDER and very well SPICED! If you are unsure of what to order, I would recommend this plate too because it gives you variety of different meats just in case you don't like one! I doubt that you wouldn't like any of them ;) The appetizer that I recommend is the COMBO PLATTER. You get to select different types of dips and items to use with your pita bread. I picked the Hummus ( very good! made from fresh chickpeas), Tabbouleh (very delicious-It was my favorite!!!), Labneh (tasted very fresh and it was some of the best that I've tasted), and Fatayer. I went on a Friday, so we got to enjoy a belly dancing show. The dancer was very good and interactive with the customers. She didn't seem to bother anyone by being able to see what customers wanted to interact with her. Very professional and good show. HANDS DOWN... YOU MUST TRY THE BAKLAVA!!! IT IS AMAZING!!

There were multiple door stop delivery people picking up orders there so I knew the food had to be worth it. The salmon was full of flavor and not overcooked. The vegetables and potatoes were perfect. The yellow rice had a lot of flavor but I like the potatoes over the rice.

The usual suspects \u00a0(9 of us) assembled to test out the food flavors from Lebanon. \u00a0I can assure everyone this is far and beyond the usual \" Mediterranean\" food I have found in Jacksonville. \u00a0After we were seated our person of the night Casey served us water and quickly brought us Pita with dipping oil for the table. \u00a0The bread was fresh, warm and the oil light and salty on the tongue. \u00a0Just about that time Chief Pierre introduced himself to us, inquired if we had any questions about the menu and suggested we may allow him to put together a combination of many items family style for the group. \u00a0I found this a brilliant move since many of the diners had never experienced this cuisine before but it was voted down. \u00a0There are so many wonderful choices on the menu I was willing to let him decide. \u00a0I started with the Foul Madames a delightful combination of \u00a0Fava beans specially prepared with garlic olive oil and lemon juice. \u00a0This warm dish brought out all the flavors of the Fava beans @ $8.50 there was enough for everyone to taste test and still have extra. \u00a0Others on the line up for Mezz were the Falafel (6 pieces) \u00a0 Crispy deep fried of ground chickpeas, broad beans, herbs, spices and tomato. Served with 1 side of tahini. Again perfect in every way and we shared. Hummus, Tabbouleh, Baba Ghanoush. and Grape Leaves we were all in, the the dishes were flying around the table to groans of delight. \u00a0When it came time for the entrees one of the owners assisted us in our decision, pronouncing the dish as it should be, explaining the heat, taste and flavors of what we were selecting. \u00a0This made life easy, what was not easy was the actual decision. \u00a0But here we go. \u00a0I am not going to bore you with all the ingredients, that way if this review sparks you go and try it. \u00a0Just know that nothing was left, there were 9 separate dishes and several converts to this particular restaurant if not the food. \u00a0Outstand dishes the Lamb, Veggies grilled, Beef Shawarma, and Mixed Grill. \u00a0Rice served with the entrees was probably the best tasting rice in any restaurant I have tried here. \u00a0Pierre continued to check on us through out the meal, which is pretty extraordinary. \u00a0Some brave souls ordered dessert to go. \u00a0I did ask it they could put together a small sampling of the dessert menu for us to share and they accommodated us immediately. This type of service is common in Europe and the Middle East not so much here in Jacksonville, so another 5 stars. \u00a0We were presented with 2 plates of traditional food stuff, \u00a0Baklava, Maamoul, Rice Pudding made with Rose Water, \u00a0what a new taste treat and Layally Beirut. \u00a0I was happy they did not serve the Tiramisu. \u00a0Is that on every menu in the world? \u00a0This is definitely a go back to restaurant. \u00a0Look at the website, get a group of good friends together and set off to be impressed."], ["Maggie O.", "Hummus is great and the wait staff was amazing.Didn't care for the sauce on the chicken Schwarma though.

We went in around 8:30pm, seated immediately but had to wait about 10 minutes before we were acknowledged for a drink order. After that, our service was vastly improved. We had two appetizers, the grape leaves and the spicy lamb sausage. Both were amazing. I opted for the mixed grill and my husband went with the fried fish.

To top the icing on the cake when the young waiter finally brought the food to us almost an hour later... he nearly dropped the food on me, I watched the staff waited hand and foot on the other guest while my husband had to make several hand gestures to get some service.

Three of us went for the lunch buffet and our verdict? It is DELICIOUS. Previously I loved Hala's lunch buffet (on University) but this seemed fresher and more flavorful. The hummus...oh, the hummus, it was thick and creamy (DREAMY is more like it). The baba ganoush was equally thick and delicious. Loved the tabouli, and I've had tabouli all around town (Karam's is my favorite, but Zaitoon's was great, and it's good at Pinegrove Deli, Whiteway Deli, Akel's Deli downtown, Zodiac Grill downtown, and the list goes on). The lentil soup was great and the garlicky fava beans were packed with flavor. There were a few meat dishes, which I didn't sample, and a rice pudding type dessert.

The restaurant is awesome on all fronts- atmosphere, food, and service! After that one first visit when I was impressed and my husband was still upset there were not gyros on the menu, we went back with the clear understanding that this is a Lebanese restaurant and not a gyro joint. Now that we accepted that, we looked at the menu from a very different angle. The service we get there is exceptional! The water is poured in the glasses before we even sit down. Plates and food is hot and delicious. Everyone is really kind! It's absolutely a top choice for us! ____________Original review after 1 visit:Solid 4 stars, to incorporate my husband's opinion (mine would be 5 stars). After our favorite Zaitoon closed and we had that one bad experience at Istanbul Grill, we have been on the hunt for a new Mediterranean favorite, so when I saw the Groupon for this one, it was perfect to try it. We were hesitant at first that it may be too low key/casual for us (we like the more fancy type places), but when we walked in a few weeks ago, we were very impressed! The environment is so cozy and authentic, clean and inviting. Unfortunately, that night they were reserved for an event, so we had to come back the next week...and that we did!Walking in, we were greeted by awesome smells from the grill cooking and some loud music and belly dancing - which ended up being perfectly nice and fun, given it was for 10 minutes (we are those weirdos who run away from live music..yeah..odd, I know). The dancer was very graceful, very tastefully done and it was really authentic. And then went back to quieter, still very nice, music after that.We are really particular about seating, but as soon as we walked in, I spotted a perfect table in the corner - loved that! We were seated right away AND brought water right awat, which is typically a pet peeve of mine (being left without water). I was already familiar with the menu - got the Spinach pastries appetizer (amazing!), the Greek salad (just as it should be), and Lamb Shish Kebab with pita breads to share. We were basically after wrapping our own gyros (have been missing those), which I realize isn't exactly a Lebanese thing and isn't exactly on the menu. So through our very own decision, we tried to change up the food from Lebanese to Greek :) Everything was absolutely delicious! We had a small challenge with getting the plates as super hot as we want them and had to ask for re-heating, but that was done promptly. I know the Mediterranean cuisine and I know this was authentic and well prepared food. My husband was looking for something that had a sauce and had some very specific ideas that just weren't on the menu - likely because what he had in mind was Greek and we were in a Lebanese restaurant. That was his only point of discontent - absolutely no reflection on the restaurant, just his own preference - menu variety for things with sauce. I guess we are still on the hunt for an actual Greek place with gyros, but I would definitely go back to Mandaloun. The service, food and environment were great at a very reasonable price. Well done, Mandaloun (and we are really picky..)!!!"], ["Robert C.", "Went here based on yelp reviews. \u00a0Was a little tricky to find, you need to go to the middle of the mini mall or drive around to the Winn Dixie parkling lot.Was a little pricey for what I got, but it was very good. \u00a0I did order take out, so maybe the presentation was off a little. \u00a0Would go back again to sample other items from the menu."], ["A D.", "Great 5 star food.

The chicken pita was full of moist chicken with a flavorful seasoning. \u00a0Unfortunately, there was nothing else on the sandwich besides the seasoned chicken and the pita. If they were to add some traditional sauce, and maybe some mint, or lettuce and tomato, the sandwich would have been very good, but as it was served it's 2 plus stars for the moist chicken, bit total lack of cohesiveness as a sandwich.

Still, he ordered the grape leaves which were served hot and \"had an interesting texture\" with a side of hummus that received the same review as mine above. I have to admit that my greatest disappointment is to find yet another Mediterranean restaurant that has gyros with the bastardized gyro meat that is far removed from the traditional meat cut off the rotating skewer; like cheap lunch meat making a horrible gyro. I did not order it this time, but had it on my first visit and confirmed they still serve this inferior product (which is why I did not order).This is defintely an okay diner that serves passable food for the most part. \u00a0However, they could really be a little gem of San Marco if their food would reflect a little more passion and cohesiveness. \u00a0I'm still hoping for this place, but I'm unlikely to return."], ["Michael C.", "Basic sit down joint in the heart of San Marco.

Looked pretty Turkish to me which I expect- not over done, just subtle.

He did forget our order of babaganoush but good thing he did because I wouldn't have had any room to enjoy it. We saw several people who ordered take out and seemed to be regulars - a good thing! On to the food! My husband got the Greek salad and added chicken. Good portion, fresh, delicious! He finished his whole plate before I could snag a bite, another good thing! I got the falafel pita- no tahini add tzatziki (a big no-no, I know! But I'm not a fan of tahini, I'll probably give it a go regular style next time) with a salad. All of it was super fresh and super delicious. I wolfed it down! Oops The pita is on point as well, real pita. Not the super soft crumbly fake stuff some places serve. Straight up- reminds me of the pita my sisters would bring back from Egypt- real deal my friends! We also shared a iced mint tea which I thought was waaaaay too sweet but it satisfied my husbands taste so he enjoyed it. I wish I had time or room to try the Turkish coffee and baklava but alas that'll have to wait until next time! Don't hesitate- GO HERE!

The vegetarian ones are a little different because they have rice and chopped vegetables in them, which I was skeptic about because I do enjoy the rice ones but these were surprisingly good! \u00a0I ordered the good to go and was in the rush, but I should have, because I was so bummed when I discovered they forgot my garlic sauce :( Next time I check this place out I'm going to try it.

I got an extra peice of pita bread my total without a drink was 15.00...got home and opened the smallest box of food ever. Three stuffed grape leaves the size of my pinkie, one small falafel and one very small kibbeh...the hummus had a hugh ditch in the middle so it was very small same with tahbouli...Wallys Gyros on Cesery is so much better with normal portions and less expensive...very disappointed based on previous great reviews."], ["Jen C.", "I love this place and everyone I have brought here says it is the best Greek in Jax.

It is quite close to 295 on Merril road. Stop there on the way to the airport!"], ["Ashley H.", "This place is delicious. My favorite thing to get is the lamb gyro. So so good.

Freshly-sliced pieces/chunks from a spit, plenty of tangy & garlicky tzatziki, plus lettuce, tomato, & onion in a fresh, soft pita. I asked for the \"salad\" instead of fries, because fries would be wooden by the time I got home, & expected to find a few lettuce leaves topped with a slice of tomato, as per usual, but WOW! Was I surprised! Instead, there was a large portion of a tomato & cucumber salad with finely-chopped parsley & a hint of mint, tossed in a lovely, light dressing. Can't be beat! I also ordered extra tzatziki as well as an order of hummus & was well-pleased with each. Even more, at first when I saw the pita accompaniment was not grilled or warmed, I was a little disappointed...but that was until I tried it.

I wanted to get Tabuleh and Humus with my Greek Gyro, but apparently this was frowned upon?? So just Tabuleh, the Gyro was okay, took about 10 minutes to come out though with only 2 parties in the establishment. \u00a0I can't say anything was bad.

My eyes were greeted by a bevvy of sides like hummus, tabouli, babaganoush and fresh fruit. I went with a Falafel Sandwich combo with tabouli and grapeleaves. My food was ready by the time I was done paying (a very reasonable $9!) and we headed outside to snag a table. The weather was fabulous and the leaves were falling on the bustling 5 points corner, making it feel more like a warm day in September despite the fact that we're inching into December. The falafel was crisp on the outside and flavorful, soft and warm on the inside, just as it should be. The tabouli was refreshing and crunchy, and I guess the grapeleaves were good, but I really just need to admit to myself that I don't like grapeleaves and stop ordering them. They just look so good! But yeah, they were acidic and mushy as usual, so I guess that means they were made well? All in all, the experience at Hovan was great.

I'd give it four, but Hovan isn't an amazing place just shy of outstanding, five-star eateries (13Gypsies or Tento, for instance). The interior is all about plastic tablecloths and paper napkins; our sandwiches came in plastic baskets. It's like a fast-food joint with local art inspired by the Mediterranean. Actually, according to their website, Hovan is a small franchise chain found throughout the southeast that began in Atlanta. Thanks, Atlanta.Lackluster interior aside, Hovan puts together a fine meal, serves it up fast, and barely dents your wallet. That's why it should probably get four stars for knowing what it is and doing it quite well.I've had some nasty dolmades (looking at you, 3rd Street Diner -- how can you coat them with Hollandaise sauce?!?) and some amazing ones (Saad's in West Philly -- why didn't he start franchising?). The LDC and I agreed that Hovan's dolmades fell near the higher end of the scale. The tzaziki sauce had plenty of pep and wasn't as lifeless as it can be at many places. LDC's lentil soup was thick and yummy. She also loved her vegan Hovan Roll with hummus and tabbouli salad. My gyro was excellent. The meat was tangy, the sandwich arrived nice and hot, and the salad was fresh. Topped it off with a $3 Shock Top beer.

Walked in and thought it was closed because no one was around. Finally, we were seated and then the real problems began. Our waitress could not have cared less. She had no idea about the menu, what drinks they had, etc. The atmosphere was really dark and seemed like a good place to get kidnapped and wake up in an ice bath. Probably should have left on that note, but decided to eat the gyro I ordered because I am a huge fan. Unfortunately, this gyro tasted like Miley Cyrus fixed it, or maybe that's just because that was the music that was playing for 20 minutes. Anyways, just adds to the list of reasons I hate Southside."], ["Polly H.", "I don't understand why this place has bad reviews. I had a lovely time, food is tasty and the service is on point.Besides you are entertained by belly dancers and is family friendly."], ["Megan P.", "Gross!!! Food was tasteless! We ordered dolmades, pastistio, and the gyro platter. All, nothing to talk about again. My boyfriend ordered 4 crown and sprites...all watered down drinks and $9.00 a drink, for singles, that tasted like water. Our total bill, tip included because our large group, was $94.00. I had sprite to drink. Talk about a waste!!! Someone needs to go in and intervene asap or this place will be history. Should've known when we walked in and it was dead on a Saturday night. We WILL NOT BE BACK!!!"], ["Mai N.", "The concept of Greek Traditions is on point! The waitress was great. Giving it a 2 star due to the fact that our chicken kabob was not cooked throughly TWICE. Manager did apologize and comped 50% of our meal."], ["Michelle F.", "Came here with a group of friends who have come went several times before and loved it. Sadly I did not though. And they ended up having a terrible time too. \u00a0We had the rudest server who just kept throwingn up his \"I've been a server for four years so I know best\" card. He was awful. Rude and we never saw him after we ordered because he wouldn't give us what we wanted to order. He was just too awful and was so rude when we asked about why we had gratuity added when there was only seven of us. He did not deserve that tip. I've worked retail for five years and I know that if a customer wants something, you do what you can. Never going back."], ["Elizabeth M.", "This place is disgusting! Please do not waste your time going here. I went in with my husband and brother because they were open late and I saw the good reviews on here. First we were stopped before entering the restaurant through the main entrance and were told to go in through where the patio seating is. Okay.... Then we get seated and I felt like I was going to catch a disease just sitting in the booth. The booths were dirty and just filthy all over. Even with the dim lighting we could see the filth. My brother and husband said lets just get a dessert and go. So we waited 15 minutes for a server that never came. We ended up leaving. If the main dining room was filthy I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like. Yuck!"], ["Chris M.", "I went here on a Friday night for a friend's birthday party with a group of about 20 people. \u00a0The tables were setup nicely and the server did not appear to have any problems keeping up with such a large group, in fact the server was very responsive considering people in the party showed up at different times. \u00a0The lack of beer selection was a little disappointing and even more disappointing was having to describe what a Black & Tan was. \u00a0The bartender didn't pour it correctly and it ended up as a Tan with some Black. \u00a0My wife ordered a Reisling and was unable to finish it. \u00a0She loves Reisling and questioned whether or not she was actually provided with one. \u00a0The food, however, was amazing! \u00a0I had the snapper fillet (after having to send back the salmon fillet due to the server's error) and it was delicious! \u00a0A little heavy on the sauce, but delicious nonetheless. \u00a0I did appreciate the server owning up to his mistake and handling the situation professionally. \u00a0I attributed some of the confusion to the size of our group. \u00a0The hummus was really good and the pita bread was cut into several pieces which would be perfect for sharing. \u00a0I heard that the grape leaves were amazing as well. \u00a0I did not expect all of the dancing and all of the napkins being thrown around the restaurant so be prepared for that. \u00a0The staff did a great job of getting patrons to get up and have a good time though. \u00a0At the other end of the restaurant you will find the hookahs. \u00a0Many people were enjoying them at both inside and outside tables. \u00a0It was nice to have the separation though because you wouldn't have been able to tell that they were even there since you couldn't see them from the main restaurant. There was a DJ and some (mostly) fun lighting that made it feel like it COULD be a dance club at some point in the night. \u00a0The laser lights could probably be aimed a little different to avoid shining in the patron's eyes from time to time though."], ["Michael G.", "I don't know why I bother coming back. First of all, the hookah is disgusting. They use old pipes and the coals are instant light, so they have a chemical taste about them.The guy was nice and attentive at first, but after thirty minutes we didn't see him until we paid. Then came time to pay the bill...Figuring out the payments is ALWAYS impossible here. Always. The server charged the table for a beer we never had. The server swiped my card for another person's ticket and I had to pay more for something I didn't have. They insisted it was irreversible. They include 20% gratuity, which is because the severs aren't worth tipping in the first place. I'm usually a very generous tipper, as I know it's difficult to be a server on a busy night. A tip is a tip, not part of the bill. I didn't get 20% worth of service.Aside from the absolute abomination of handling payments and their sub-par hookah. The food is outrageously priced and it cost $5 for a domestic draft beer. I could go to any of the surrounding bars and have two for that price. Plus, water comes in bottles for $2.50 and you don't get refills. That's a 1200% mark-up on Zephyr Hills.Never coming back."], ["Marie F.", "I LOVE THIS PLACE. Great food, great drinks, and a great hookah spot that doesn't look like a psycho's basement. Date didn't double check movie times so we had over an hour to spare. We decide to have a few drinks before the movie. We are greeted warmly by several servers who give us great recommendations on drinks, food, and hookah flavors. And we've tried them all. -Variety of martinis ... perfect-Lamb ribs ... delicious (gotta come back for a full menu only gone through appetizers)-UFO \u00a0hookah (we were told it was a 50/50 hit or miss.. the taste reminded us of detergent... was then give a free reup of PASSION something? ... and it was a 100% hit!)Such a pleasant experience, can't wait to go back. Night and weekend staff are so much fun and knowledgeable. If you smoke Hookah and have not been here you are missing out!"], ["Misty S.", "HHhhmm...okay, I was kind of excited to go here for a friend's birthday because it was some place I'd never been and it seemed like a fun idea.I ordered a martini slightly dry. \u00a0What I received was a martini with Orange Vodka and olives. \u00a0GROSS! \u00a0I went to the bar and asked the bartender what she made and she said she made it with orange vodka, I told her I wanted a slightly dirty martini, those are made with regular vodka. \u00a0She made it over and yelled at the waiter that he put in the order wrong.Fast forward to the food...it was ok. \u00a0However, as I started eating, 6,000 napkins were being thrown in the air and landing all over everyone and into our food. \u00a0Kinda gross actually. \u00a0Then the belly dancer started prancing around and that was kind of fun to watch and see the people get up on the tables and dance. \u00a0I liked that part.However, wait for it....the bill came, holy crapballs! \u00a0TOTALLY not worth the price AND the fact that they slyly add the 20% gratuity, that you can barely read.In any case, I don't think I'll be back...but I'm glad we tried it."], ["Beverly H.", "Absolutely delicious food! Great happy hour prices. The only reason it has 4 and not 5 stars is because the credit card we paid our food with had charges on it that weren't ours once we got our bill in the mail. The cc company linked the breach to this place. I would go back but pay cash!!! Cash is KING here!! Also the staff was a bit odd."], ["Kristen E.", "This place is open late and although the dining room closes, kitchen stays open and you can order from the hookah lounge. More of a club vibe, but still decent enough to enjoy a meal amongst the billowy aromas of fake cherry smoke and interesting mix of clientele."], ["Stephanie T.", "So, while I was reading some of the reviews I agree with a few. The decor is outdated, a lot of the servers would benefit from being a little more professional. I think they are trying to put a front of being a nice, classy restaurant, but sometimes the atmosphere and reality is that it's a little nightclub-ish. The menu for me is way overpriced, but I go there for happy hour and then I'm not so disappointed. That's why I'm giving it 4 stars. I wouldn't pay the normal prices, but with 1/2 off drinks, hookah and most apps from 4-7; I will gladly pay $2.50 for hummus. I go there with friends after work and we all order a bunch of appetizers and a hookah and the drinks flow and we always have a good AND affordable time. A lot of my friends go late at night on the weekends and have a lot of fun. It's just not my crowd/scene around that time, but all in all it's a decent place if you know ahead of time what you're in for."], ["Jay J.", "Great service from a first time server. As a solo traveler dining out can be awkward, but I was at peace outside, and the \"Greek-ness\" of the food was top notch. Sweet family atmosphere, no rush, no pressure. I didn't delve into hookahs or any of the other things people are moaning about, but a good meal and a peaceful spot in a crazy city is well worth the 5 stars."], ["Rosemarie T.", "I have been to this restaurant many times and enjoyed the food and atmosphere. \u00a0 We went last night \u00a0(Sunday ) and I was so disappointed in the food. \u00a0 We had a group of 5 who got the Hermes shared dinner. \u00a0 In the past, they gave you one of each appetizer for the number ordering. Last night you got 2 of each. \u00a0Also the meat was so over cooked and dry it wasn't worth eating. \u00a0 Overall, a very disappointing food experience."], ["Mark H.", "It is hard to find food in the burbs of JAX past 10 PM, and after exhausting all leads, we ended up at Yamas, and that wasn't really a bad thing. If you've ever been to Acropolis in Ybor city, then you will find this place very reminiscent of your memories there. Loud music, napkins being thrown all over the place and belly dancers. Only difference is that the food isn't as good as Acropolis. We ordered 3 appetizers; hot pikilia, hummus and filet tips. All three were pretty good. The utilization of lemon on everything was a little abusive though, in my opinion. For this reason, I found the hummus to be the best of the three. We also ordered some white sangria, but they brought us RED. Not wanting to complain, we just took the red. It was decent, but nothing to write home about. Side note, I was going to order a Greek salad, but when I asked if it came with Greek potato salad, the waiter looked at me like I owed him money. He went back to ask the kitchen staff, and they said they had no idea what I was talking about and that \"salad does not come with the salad.\" I felt like maybe they were making fun of me a little for asking. \u00a0Either way, if you're used to eating Greek fare in the Tarpon Springs/Tampa Bay area, just note that Greek potato salad only seems to come with Greeks salads in THAT area, and not up in Jax."], ["Tim M.", "It is sad to see a good restaurant go bad. I love to go here for lunch and dinner, \u00a0but the restaurant is going downhill. \u00a0The tables are sticky, the decor is outdated, and the quality of the food has declined. \u00a0The only saving grace is the staff."], ["Ann M.", "I frequent this place because I love their tzatziki and pita bread, and also always get the same entree -- the original greek salad with gyro meat. They also have a nice comfortable outdoor seating section. I guess the salad would be sort of hard to mess up, just have fresh ingredients and we're good. However, each time I go, my boyfriend gets something different, and it seems like the meat is always over-cooked. He order filet mignon kebobs, medium, and it came out well done with chewy fatty pieces. Not so sure it was actually filet mignon."], ["Gary W.", "Not good at all.1) From the instant we sat down we were rushed to decide on drinks and dinner. \u00a0We decided on the Poseidon and ordered this for each person2) The appetizers were lackluster. The eggplant was tasteless.3) We expected to receive the Saganki next, it this was not served until after the main courses were on the table. \u00a0It was salty and small in portion.4) We specifically asked to not be rushed but all the food was served immediately after we asked not to be rushed.5) The fish, pork and chicken were all over done. \u00a0I thought I was eating a brick for the chicken.6) The wine was poor in quality.Don't waste your time, I will not darken the doorway at this place again."], ["Kimber L.", "fantastic! \u00a0We got there a bit early for the belly dancers and our waitress encouraged us to stay for it which we did. \u00a0We tried spanikopita(VERY good), \u00a0filet medallions (melt in your mouth), Salmon (delishious!) and lamb chops (done well but Lamb isn't my fav_others at our table liked it).The hummus was tastey. \u00a0We also ordered the dessert sampler..the ek mek was fabulous and the baklava was moist as it should be!Overall I loved it and will definately be back!!!!"], ["Michelle S.", "A good time, as always! \u00a0The atmosphere on a Friday nite is electric and loads of fun! \u00a0Food is wonderful, especially the lamb shank! \u00a0YUM!!"], ["Katherine M.", "I went here for a dietetic social so I got a deal and can't really rate for the price. All I had to do was pay $5 and I had access to a delicious buffet of Greek salad, spanakopita, hummus, tzatziki, keftethes, and chicken wings. It's hard to find good Greek cuisine but Yamas definitely has it. I was not a fan of the wings but the drinks were worthy of my attention. Most importantly, the staff was fun and our server got our group giggling when he'd randomly grab stacks of napkins and threw them up in the air to shower over us. By the end of the night, me and a friend joined in a chain of Greek dancing around the restaurant and joined in a quick dance on the table. Definitely try it. They'll have you yelling 'opa!' in no time."], ["Alexia K.", "I hate to only rate this place 2 stars as I have had some pretty good meals here in the past, but I have to after the meal I had today. \u00a0I haven't eaten at taverna yamas in awhile, and this was my first time coming here for lunch. \u00a0The hummus was good, but the chicken in my pita sandwich was spongy and looked like the weird chicken you find in a lot of frozen meals, not to mention that it was undercooked and still pink in some areas. \u00a0That's really dangerous, so I just can't overlook it. \u00a0I advised the waitress of this, but still paid full price for the meal. \u00a0At least the hummus and salad were good. \u00a0Just beware of the chicken. \u00a0Also, one other time I ate here there were flies everywhere inside and my friend and I were advised by the manager that this is normal because people open the door to come in and out. \u00a0Funny that in the other restaurants I go to, there are doors and no flies. \u00a0Interesting."], ["Heavi K.", "It was ok. Too salty for my tastes."], ["M W.", "This place is cool.They have family style Greek tables so you're sure to be cozy with whomever you're dining with and even those you didn't come with.As for the food I had hummus and pita which was good and not overly garlicky and the pita was pillowy and not too chewy.My entree was a gyro greek salad which had a good oil dressing. \u00a0The only thing different I would have wished for would be for the olives to not have pits.Overall good experience and food."], ["Teagues C.", "Went there for lunch and got the daily special of chicken, rice, and artichokes.

We were here before on a Friday night and I have to say the quality of food greatly differs. \u00a0The lamb ribs were chewy and slight burnt and so was the fried calamari that came with the Hot \u00a0Pikilia. \u00a0The caviar spread was so thinned out that it did not have good flavor at all. \u00a0I ordered the kids Chicken tenders and I thought they were the best among the rest we ordered.

We started with Greek salad which has awesome tomatoes and produce,a rarity for jax. \u00a0We got the hot and cold app samplers to split. \u00a0Lamb shanks were amazing, hummus, taziki, and grape leaves all standouts. \u00a0The staff was great, dancing and tossing napkins while belly dancer was making her way around the room. \u00a0The owner was great, jovial and passing out free shots. \u00a0They also have family style which combined with the fun atmosphere would be great for a bday or occasion. \u00a0Plus, the prices are great! \u00a0House Greek red wine is 4 per glass and is great table wine. \u00a0We need to support this restaurant in a location that has been numerous names, make sure it stays open! \u00a0Highly recommend this place!"], ["Janel S.", "I visted Taverna Yamas while vacationing in Jacksonville, after reading several extremely positive reviews. \u00a0I must assume that these reviewers have never eaten real Greek food before, or that I just went on a really bad night. \u00a0The food wasn't TERRIBLE, but for the prices we paid, I expected much, much more. \u00a0Pretty much everything we ate was bland. \u00a0The hummus and other appetizers were what I'd expect to get from a generic supermarket brand, not what's supposed to be a great Greek restaurant. \u00a0Luckily they were half price, or they really would not have been worth it. On the other hand, the seafood dishes were quite good, likely because the fish tasted very fresh. \u00a0The service also wasn't great, which was surprising, considering there were only a few parties in the huge space. \u00a0I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone looking for a great Greek experience. \u00a0I have eaten at many much less expensive restaurants with much higher quality food... but if you're going with a bunch of people and looking to have a good time rather than a fine dining experience, you could do worse."], ["Robin O.", "Based on reviews of places within a 5 minute drive of where I work (Southpoint area) I suggested this place to a co-worker and out-of-town colleagues, with the disclaimer that I hadn't been myself! \u00a0Thanks to all of you for such a find! Our server was friendly and helpful, there when we needed him but not hovering. The four of us shared appetizers of spanakopita and dolmades, and it was very apparent they were made in house and not canned/frozen. We were all jonesing for gyros. I was expecting a pita sandwich with maybe some fries that I wouldn't eat on the side. I got the sandwich part right... Warm, juicy, with plenty of tangy tzatziki and crisp onion, lettuce, and fresh tomato. The surprises were the generously portioned and exceptionally fresh Greek salad and the delicious lemony roasted potato wedges! I plan to organize an after-work Happy Hour here, as the half-price drinks and appetizers offer a cheap opportunity to sample more of the menu and atmosphere."]], "Wafaa N Mike Cafe": []}
