Everything is cooked fresh right there!For my entree I went with the Mongolian Chicken with Fried Rice which had sliced mushrooms, \u00a0fresh onions, and scallions. Wow, this plate looked fantastic! Everything was steaming and you could tell it was freshly prepared. I took my first bite and was very impressed. It was very delicious and had very distinct flavors. There was noting bland about this dish! I also really loved the fried rice. It had a taste all it's own and was different than others I have had. We were sitting there at the table commenting on how great it was, really.My husband decided on the Thai Cashew Stir Fry (Steak) with toasted cashews in a garlic soy sauce with carrots, \u00a0broccoli, mushrooms, snap peas, and red bell peppers. He was also in love with his dish. I took a little bite and was blown away at the flavor. Verdict: Loved it!We were really happy to be invited out because this place was amazing! While talking to the owner we found out that they also offer online ordering as well as a loyalty program ($10 credit for every $100 that is spent!)

The shrimp pho was warm and good for a rainy day. Not as good as a traditional pho but had some flavor. The service was good but at 630 pm one would not think they would appear overwhelmed. No napkins at table or given when food served. Good thing a spoon came with my dinner as we had no utensils as well. The place was packed though. Maybe just a bad night.

Despite the mixed reviews, I was hoping my experience would be on the more positive end of things. Unfortunately, I am not able to say this was an experience I want to repeat. The ambiance is really lacking, the place was deserted and it is in a shopping plaza that's a little dreary. There were about seven guys just hanging out in the parking lot. It seemed odd. We had a friendly and helpful waitress and were immediately seated in a booth. We ordered several selections from the dim sum menu. The best thing I can say about the dinner was that the Sesame balls were pretty good. The Diet Pepsi was also good-not flat and not over-syrupy. That's kind of where it ended, for me. We tried the shrimp dumplings, which were very gooey, and some sort of beef wrapped in dough. It was so sticky and doughy I could not finish it. We also tried shrimp balls and shrimp rolls, which were very chewy and not exceptionally tasty. We ordered some sort of dumpling with greens in it but when we bit into them, they were half frozen, so we sent them back. As we were leaving, I happened to look down and see a little brown roach crawling across the dining room floor. I know we live in Florida and bugs abound everywhere, but a restaurant is really the last place I want to see one. I had to drop a star for the roach. I just don't do bugs. Compared to other dim sum I have had, this was pretty poor quality. The service was very nice, but everything else was lacking. We will look elsewhere when trying dim sum in the future."], ["Carlos C.", "This review is only for the dim sum experience. This place was the first in my effort to try all three of the places that serve dim sum in the Jacksonville area. I tried all of the dim sum offerings that I could eat (allergic to shrimp) to get an Idea of what is good here and I must say that I was quite underwhelmed. The only thing that was decent to me were the pork buns, even though they were room temperature. I asked if everything was hot and fresh and the guy said yes. LIES! The \"beef\" rice roll, (I put beef in quotation marks because it seriously looked like processed pork of some sort), had an unearthly slimy texture that I just couldn't stomach and not to mention, the \"beef\" that was in it had the same slimy texture as well. The sesame balls were delicious but I could only eat one because of the sweet lotus paste in the center.  This place didn't have a large selection like some of the other dim sum places I've been to in other cities but for Jax I suppose it's better than not having anything at all. I would most definitely return here and try their regular menu items and just order a tray of pork buns next time though. As for dim sum , I think I will just move along and try the other couple of places here in Jax and hope they are better. I may just have to stick to the excellent dim sum spots I've been to in Orlando since I go there so often. I gave silver star three stars instead of the two I would normally give an experience like this because honestly, their regular items looked pretty damn good and the servers were very polite and did an excellent job."], ["Richard P.", "We have tried Silver Star twice. \u00a0First time was years ago and we simply did not like it. \u00a0Plus it was quite far from where we live, so it just fell off from our radar list. \u00a0But recently, talking to a friend, we were convinced to give Silver Star another try. \u00a0Though it's not the best dim sum we've ever had (I mean, not even close), but we had a decent time at Silver Star.We ordered several dim sum dishes and compared each item against our in-town 'go to' dim sum place (Dim Sum Room). \u00a0And decided that both places have some good, some decent, and some really bad dim sum dishes. \u00a0But because Silver Star is so much further from us, that it is less likely for us to visit.But overall, until Jacksonville start to have its own Chinatown or at least several more authentic Chinese restaurants that serve dim sum, Silver Star would still be a good choice to go when you have a dim sum craving. \u00a0A few reviewers already mentioned this, but one of the worst dishes is their turnip cake. \u00a0Not sure what they did, but that dish definitely needs massive improvement. \u00a0But other more 'stellar' dishes are short ribs, tripes, and shrimp balls."], ["Jimmy P.", "My son and I ate dinner here with my parents. \u00a0It's been a long time since we last ate here (15 years or so ago maybe). \u00a0Nothing has changed.We started off with the chicken wings appetizers. \u00a0I love me some chicken wings! \u00a0For entrees, we shared the House Lo Mein, Szechuan chicken, and Fried rice. \u00a0We also ordered my Mom's favorite, Chinese broccoli. \u00a0I'm surprised how Chinese brocolli is leafy compared to the brocolli we're accustomed to. \u00a0The food was excellent. \u00a0Friendly staff too and the wait wasn't that bad.I have to try the Dim Sum. \u00a0Many of my fellow yelpers were talking about it. \u00a0Definitely next time!"], ["Kathy C.", "I have been on a dim sum kick lately. \u00a0For three weeks in a roll, been going to the two dim sum places I know of in Jacksonville. \u00a0Well, yesterday, we tried Silver Star. \u00a0I believe the last time we were here was like... 5 years ago? \u00a0I remember I did not have a good experience and therefore, never bothered to drive back to try again because it is far from where we live.Well, from reading reviews and a friend who told me that their dim sum was actually pretty good, we decided to give Silver Star another try. \u00a0I am glad we did because we were pleasantly surprised. \u00a0First of all, this is still Jacksonville, which still has a long way to go as far as authentic Chinese restaurants of various regions. \u00a0There just aren't that many options. \u00a0Silver Star to me, is \"A-OK\" for Jacksonville if not borderline \"I'm a fan\".There were four of us and we opted for all dim sum dishes. \u00a0We tried their sui mai (ok), friend shrimp balls (tasty), bbq ribs (ok), \u00a0bbq buns (ok), ginger and scallion beef tripe (tasty), bbq pork rice roll (ok), pan friend leek and pork dumplings (tasty), taro dumplings (ok), and the disappointing gold dumplings (too little filling) and turnip cake (just thin sad tasteless slices).So, yeah, a mixed bag on the food but again, for Jacksonville, where dim sums are extremely limited, it serve its purpose when you have dim sum cravings. \u00a0The service was nice. \u00a0Not just our main server, but the runners that bring us dishes and those that push the carts or walk around with tray full of dim sum plates, were all very friendly and attentive. \u00a0I would visit Silver Star more often if I live closer."], ["Nhi P.", "As an Orlando resident, being surrounded by so many delicious dim sum restaurants has turned me into a bit of a dim sum snob.

They didn't have pork shu-mai and a couple of other staples, but the dishes they had were prepared perfectly and tasted super delicious. I didn't see any indication of the \"greasy\" qualities some Yelpers mentioned either since everything looked and tasted fresh!The staff was amazing as well. The host (and owner, I think) was super friendly and hands-on. He would be seating people, bringing food out, talking to customers -- he was everywhere!

I was more than happy to pay for the extra rice but they said it wasn't necessary, I thought that was nice. The portion of chicken was ample for two people & I was surprised to see the neat row of breaded chicken slices sitting next to the generous portion of green onions. The sauce came in a separate cup & I was happy to see chunks of pineapple floating around inside.After serving up the food onto 2 plates we still could have done with more rice & a tad bit more sauce & we are not big eaters.The meal itself was absolutely delicious! \u00a0I'm a big fan of Hong Kong style Sweet & Sour but this dish was a pleasant & unexpected departure. The sauce was thin & perfectly sweetened. The green onions were a lovely compliment to the breaded chicken & light sauce, the rice perfectly cooked. Overall, I'm glad we gave Blue Bamboo a try. My only reservation stems from the pricing - the 1 person portion that we shared between us was $17 - to go back & buy 2 portions next time would be double that which is a bit steep for take-out chinese IMO but to be fair, they are not a take-out joint..but a restaurant (which was lovely inside btw).We will definitely go back & eat in but stick to our local chinese for take-outs."], ["Ryan O.", "Back in town for one final appearance. I'd been dying to try the place and finally found the time. I'm not really understanding the \"Dressy\" notation as it is NOT an upscale restaurant. Don't get me wrong, it's very clean and very nicely decorated, it's just impossible to be upscale when you are located on Southside in Jacksonville and share a building with an empty restaurant that has a For Lease banner flapping in the breeze. I tried the duck wontons as an appetizer and, to my dismay, they weren't really wontons. The contents of said wonton were haphazardly thrown on top of a fried wrapper, that was not wrapped. They were OK, but just too much sauce and no where near enough duck. The over sauced mess became tedious after a few bites. For the main course, I went with the honey glazed ribs. Strangely enough, these were under sauced and devoid of flavor , not to mention they were accompanied by, wait for it, french fries? I thought the chef could have come up with something a bit more creative there. I understand the \"fusion\" concept, but the last thing anyone needs is more friggin' french fries. To be honest I've had much better Chinese in seedy holes in the wall in Manhattan, the kinds of places that make you wonder if those boneless spare ribs really do come from ally cats.
