Not only did our serve handle it very well but another server (assumed to be senior or possibly management working the floor) came to check on us, made sure I got a knife I had requested and made us aware they had many new team members and they were still in training. Quickly our proper order arrived and we continued to enjoy our meals. My singapore mei fun was very good. Surprisingly when it was time for our check the more senior server/manager? brought it to us, informed us she had double checked it for accuracy along with giving us a discount for our \"trouble\".

Their fried rice has a scent and flavor that I've never tasted in the US. \u00a0When I was in India, I had some indo-chinese food there. \u00a0I recognize the flavoring from the indo-chinese food. \u00a0I noticed this \"flavor\" in the fried rice, and in the Malaysian roti. \u00a0I was assuming that the roti might just be pre-made frozen ones, but it seemed very high quality and fresh, flakey! \u00a0The curry platter was very tasty, and creamy. \u00a0Each dish was flavored perfect, and nothing needed changed (unless you want spice). \u00a0I was told that the owner created their recipes, and I think it's possible that the owners wife came to each table to ask what we thought of the food. \u00a0Not only did she ask, she made conversation. \u00a0Two other tables also asked about our food. \u00a0It seemed like a very social and friendly environment. \u00a0Before coming here, I initially thought \"why go to a non-buffet when there is much more variety there??\". \u00a0I realized last night why.... because RICE BOWL's FOOD is soooooooo much more flavored! \u00a0 Don't go for quantity when you can instead have quality! \u00a0Our waitress was also very friendly!"], ["Alban B.", "Great food at an awesome price.

I had their Tom YumSpicy soup with mushroom, tomato, onion and bell pepper. You can order the soup with Tofu, Chicken, shrimp, or seafood combination. I had the shrimp along with the soup. The soup it self was very flavorful and was a decent amount per serving. As for main entree ordered their Panang curry which is curry infused with coconut milk and garnished with holy basil, bell pepper, and lime leaves. You can order the curry with different combinations as well such as shrimp, tofu, seafood, chicken. I had the tofu. The curry is served with rice.

This place is excellent in every way except for the food. I've never seen a restaurant so well capitalized and place so little emphasis on authenticity and food quality - which is ironic given the note from the owner about it being the most authentic there is. They have knives laid out at the tables - which is a big no-no in thai restaurants but this was the smallest of there transgressions.The coconut soup was a disgrace and tasted like it came from a can. The chicken, and everything else came in huge chunks making it impossible to eat with a spoon. For the mains, my girlfriend and I ordered green curry and pad thai. The pad thai had a cool concept where it was incased in a thin omelette but the noodles were thick, the tofu was mush and tasted like the noodles, and the whole thing was drenched in fish sauce. Fish sauce is central to thai cuisine, but in moderation. The story doesn't get better with the green curry. The \"jasmine\" rice which didn't have the slightest hint of jasmine was bone dry and the eggplant was completely under cooked. It's almost impossible to over cook eggplant. Leave it in an extra 5 minutes if you're not sure. Furthermore, there were all these unnecessary flourishes like cucumbers cut in the shape of stars and a rose made out of a radish. Who cares about stuff like that when your dinner isn't edible??Worst of all is that this restaurant is beautiful inside and the staff was very friendly and had great energy. Someone put a lot of money into making this place and just said \"F it\" when it came to the kitchen. I don't want to recommend anything specifically here, but to say that there are multiple MUCH better thai restaurants within blocks of this place could be the understatement of the year."], ["Yoniel F.", "My wife and I were on a late night Thai food hunt. We could not have been more disappointed in EVERYTHING about Buddha Belly. It started with the hostess, who's personality was that of a doorknob. We stood there waiting on her to greet us as she walked past us at least 3 times in what appeared to be an empty restaurant. Yes, we were there close to closing time but 45 minutes to get our food seemed more then ample. After spending a few minutes trying to figure out where to seat us, in a room full of empty tables, we chose to sit against the wall. The waitress quickly placed tap water on our table while the hotness was asking us what kind of water we wanted. Clearly the waitress was already annoyed! She wasted no time in asking us if we were ready. When we asked what she would recommend she appeared bothered and she went along with everything we asked about. She was an exceptionally poor waitress. The waitress never offered anything after our brief encounter in placing our orders. The food was marginal and presentation was non existent! Finally, the ambience was ruined. 10 minutes to closing they turned all the lights on to let us know it was time for us to go. The check was brought out to us shortly after our dinner was placed on the table. This was our first and last time dinning at Buddha Belly and we recommend it to NOONE!!!

Each time I've had some variant of beef curry (green, red, Panang).Well, the prices are up there - standard lunch runs (I believe) $10-12 plus tip, rather than the $6-7 that I was used to before moving here, but maybe that's just how the beach area rolls.The curry itself is pretty average - not particularly bland, but not as rich as I prefer. Portions are not great for the aforementioned price. The lunch special also comes with a soup, which, last time I was there, was some sort of creamy business that was fairly inedible; it just reeked of fish sauce. No-one at our table ate more than a couple of spoonfuls.And the service is iffy. Not sure how I feel about ordering Thai food from a extremely non-asian wait staff, but I suppose it is fancier than your average small-time curry joint.So, there you go.

On our first visit we weren't wowed by the food but the owners hospitality was very inviting. So, we decided to give it another try.On our second visit we brought along a couple of friends. We were on a Thai Cuisine Mission... Appetizers, Dinner and Dessert. I was excited to try the Coconut Mango Rice, heard it was amazing. Upon our arrival we were sat by a stylish younger Asian women. (Here is where the train wreck started) I asked for a booth and lost our chance to have her as our waitress. Our new waitress greeted us with a blank face and a feeling of obligation to take our order. At one point she asked if we were ready to order and as my wife prepared to give her order, the waitress walked away. Upon her return 2 people in our party asked for suggestions. Her response was as boring as the misspelled menu. Shortly after we ordered, apps rolled out and were amazing, Crab Rangoon and Money Bags. My taste buds water as I type.

Rather than ruin everyone's meal, I handed the plate back to the food runner and point at the hair. I sent it back and decided to share with my wife. The Chicken Pad Thai was alright. I'd compare it to cheap Chinese take out with a Thai twist. No worries though, I'm ready for desert. As I look up the waitress was pushing my check in my face. I asked to place my desert order and was shut down with finding out they had closed the kitchen. Ummmm, I thought they would have at least asked if we would like deserts before closing out our tabs. As we pay out, the over aged food runner returns. He asked us if everything was ok. I kindly told him I would write a yelp review. He pressed me to tell him how I felt about my visit. I declined and again said I would write a proper review. Long story short, he chewed me out for not wanting to write a favorable review. He also told me no one will care about my review.

We ordered the lumpia, spring rolls and calamari also The steamed dumplings. Everything was so delicious the calamari was so tender and the dumplings you could tell were homemade steamed to perfection \u00a0with a great dipping sauce. We also ordered the Spring rolls that came with a fresh cucumber salad in a spicy sweet sauce that were addicting.All the prices on the menu are very reasonable and the food looks amazing. There are so many things I want to try! The banana lumpia with ice cream for dessert sounds amazing! There was a lady that came out with dishes from the kitchen that talked to us about the food and told us that she makes it fresh just like in the Philippines. She told us the different ingredients she uses and described how she cooked them. It was really cool to hear about how everything is homemade because you can't really find that to many places. Simply tasty Thai is a great little spot that I think everyone should check out. The service was excellent the food is authentic and definitely worth trying if not over and over again.

I made eye contact with both waitresses and raised my hand to get their attention. Neither one responded. When a waitress finally came over, she didn't notice anything wrong with the situation...a full plate of food with an increasingly annoyed customer. I asked for chop sticks and I received them. After ten minutes, I was too pissed off to finish my food. I asked for the check, which included the lumpia. It was removed after I pointed out that I never received it.

I am not demanding excellent service, I can handle mediocre, but not rude. Never in my four years, I repeat NEVER, there was a hostess when I went in. The waiters and the manager ignore you even if you are standing there. I do not mind waiting but I have never seen a place where they ignore a waiting customer so nonchalantly. The same applies to the waiters. There are too proud to be polite. Something is really wrong with the morale of this place.

Don't let the low rent building fool you. Once you walk through the door you will be met by a gracious and professional staff in a well decorated and peaceful place to eat. Unlike a lot of cheesy Thai restaurants, Lemongass Thai was decorated by somebody who understood the need for balance between elephant sculptures and more subdued decorations. There are wonderful statues all around but they don't over take the atmosphere of the place. Now on the important stuff!DrinksLet's start with the drinks. Lemongrass offers a wide variety of good wines. I have only partaken in wine on one of my three visits to LGT. That being said, the wine I had was recommended by my waited and paired excellently with my dinner. Every other time I order the Thai Cream Tea. It is excellent. The milky, sweet flavor provides just the right amount of relief from the sometimes spicy Thai food. I highly encourage some of you to give it a go. In addition to Wine and their speciality drinks, LGT offers a small but robust selection of somewhat local and craft beer in addition to the usual domestic (read: boring) offerings. FoodThe food here is pretty good. I would argue that it is a little inconsistant. I have been 3 times as I said before and each time the quality has been from 3-5 star worthy. That being said, know that you will get a good meal every time. The Pad Thai, everyone's classic favorite it seems, was very good. They'll make it spicy if you ask for it. Wash it down with the Thai Cream Tea and you'll have \u00a0a wonderful meal. The Pad See Ew was excellent as well. This is a favorite place among my friends and I. ServiceThe service is always fantastic. The servers are just very professional and will chat with you if you like.

I'll start off by saying that that Jacksonville has a quite a few Thai restaurants and several of them are quite good so the bar is pretty high in my opinion. We went for dinner and was surprised to see how small the location was. While we were there no one else showed up to eat in but several people did pick up take out. I would probably say that between indoor and outdoor seating they could probably seat 30-40 people max.Our waitress was incredibly friendly and very helpful. She talked to use about their spiciness levels (this changes A LOT between different Thai restaurants so I always recommend asking), and the different \"specialty\" options. They also had incredibly fast food service and if you've even been to a Thai restaurant you know this is not always the case. While I actually enjoy sitting and chatting with friends during dinner, anyone that is in a \"hurry\" may find their speed a service really helpful. For example it is very difficult for my wife and I to get a Thai lunch during a work due to only having an hour, but it would be completely possible to do that here.Now for the less than positive points; the pork wontons were a little overly fried. They weren't burnt just a little too hard and crunch like they have been left in just a little too long. All of their food was a little too salty for my taste as well. I have mentioned in previous posts that I might be a bit more sensitive than most to salt as I don't really cook with it but I would still say that should hold back on it a bit. I expect cheap chines food to be salty and it make the dishes overall seem a bit lacking in \"Thai\" flavor. I also thing that the portion sized were a little smaller than other Thai restaurants I've eaten at.Overall I think that Pattaya Thai was just \"ok\". I don't think I'd call it out for being bad, but I would probably send someone elsewhere if they really wanted excellent Thai. This would be my go to if I REALLY wanted Thai take out, or didn't have time to commit to a full meal.

I was in town for vacation and wanted some Thai food so I stopped in!!! \u00a0This place will do great:)"], ["Samantha M.", "I read that Pattaya had recently opened on King and was excited to check it out. Upon arrival, it was clear that there was a line and quite a lot of confusion with to-go orders from people who were waiting for large orders, and I noticed a few people leaving that seemed to be quite upset. After about ten minutes of watching the confusing situation in front of me, we placed our order. They were out of chicken (gasp!) so I went with plan b-the red curry with tofu. The boyfriend ordered shrimp pad Thai and we both grabbed a beer from the fridge before looking for a table. By the way, a tip on the ordering etiquette/process-the protocol is to order at the counter FIRST, get a number, and THEN get a seat. Don't send your girlfriend or pals to hog that one table outside when there are fifteen people in front of you who will undoubtedly eat and leave before you even order. You'll get a seat. Calm down.But I digress...Back to the experience. Our order was out to our table very quickly, even with how busy they were-literally within five minutes. Unfortunately, my order was wrong; I ordered the red curry with tofu but was served green tofu with chicken (the protein they were out of), by mistake. They fixed my order and brought the correct curry the second time. Now to the food:It was good. It was flavorful. It was VERY spicy. I requested a medium spice level and the boyfriend requested very hot. There was honestly no difference between the two levels-both were eye-watering hot. If you are averse to extremely spicy food, I recommend you ask for mild!The curry was sweet and, while I would have preferred a different protein, I felt the flavors were well balanced. The pad Thai tasted like classic pad Thai. Good, solid flavors and the portions were massive.While I did enjoy slurping away at my almost-too-spicy curry, I did not enjoy slurping it from the cheapest plastic spoon that has ever been made. Pattaya does offer food to-go, but there is clearly a seating area with booths, tables, and even a bar. Patio seating is also offered. So it's not like one of those in-and-out stops with one small table that people sit at while they wait for their food. Additionally, their prices do not really reflect a to-go atmosphere. Their specials are about 19 bucks and I was a little surprised. Two beers, a coke, a pad Thai, and a red curry cost almost fifty bucks. If you're going to charge high prices, at least give me a spoon that I don't have to worry about melting the moment I put it into scalding hot curry. I feel their pricing and their atmosphere don't exactly mesh up. It feels like a spot that wants to be a sit-down restaurant but also wants to focus on take out. Given the size of the place, I can see how this might be tricky. Despite being slammed, they were very quick and I was thankful that their kitchen was so fast.

With only half a dozen eaters at the post 1:30 lunch crowd, asking for refills would have been appropriate as well as a sturdy cup. The second thing is \"lunch portions\" - unlike the Baymeadows restaurant, this location has a much younger demographic that wants smaller portions in exchange for a smaller prices. I have a feeling the the two Basa filets for $22 and the whole fish for $30 are not ordered often.

Having been fortunate enough to visit Thailand several years ago the green curry chicken was spot on and brought back wonderful memories of my month in the land of smiles. Too bad the owners have decided to pursue an agenda of making as much $ as they can off of 1st time visitors rather than encouraging and developing \u00a0a fiercely \u00a0loyal neighborhood clientele.

This was, of course, a 'teaser' if you ask me, since they were GONE in less than 60 seconds! Both lunch dishes looked great with it's floral-like garnish made of carrots and thin strings of beet. The fried rice was delish! But the Pad Thai noodles were just slightly overcooked \u00a0to the point they were a little too stuck together. The #1 heat factor was mild and I think this wuss could have gone to 2. I also had a Thai milk tea. If you've never had one, you should try it once.

They do allow smoking on the patio so sometimes I'm forced inside when the weather is too cold and the smoke is too much. Lighting usually remains pretty dim at all hours.

Tiles on the floor were broken and the lightening isn't much brighter then the main room. ------THE NIGHTLIFE-----Monday - Martini Mondays (just like it was when this place was Square One) It's not a big place, but transforms perfecting from a late lunch/dinner spot to a small dance floor. Live music performances 8pm to about 10:30pm followed by DJ playing until close. I thought they closed at midnight but I've been here way past that on some Monday's. Very nice way to start the week. Great place to relax after a long day. Decent bartenders, everyone seems to have a favorite. Take a few drinks, listen to nice music, do a little two step, and still get plenty of sleep for the next work day. Hip Hop / Top 40 music. Listen to 93.3 for the vibe. There are times that I come in after work for dinner, but end up chatting and listening to the live music that I almost forget that I want food. ------THE FOOD-----Great Thai cuisine at all hours of the day. They do limit items to a bar menu after 8 but just chat with a waitress to see if anything from the dinner menu might still be available. \u00a0The food is extremely good. With the last visit, I was sadden that I couldn't get any sushi because they were without a sushi chef! That's my only sour note with the food.

I opted for my second choice, the red curry. I think the food here is pretty good and the portions are ginormous. It's not the most authentic, but that doesn't mean it's not good. The spring rolls appetizer flavor and sauce was a little off for me, but my friends seemed to enjoy it. The calamari appetizer was great; lightly battered and fried. However, I found the sweet and sour sauce an interesting accoutrement. I like how you can request levels of spiceness.

The two locations are very similar, so this is a review for both of them.The ambiance is \"dark and fancy non-specific Southeast Asian\". The tables have nice linens and cloth napkins.

The servers and hostesses are polite and try to be helpful. To-go orders are done very quickly at either location, even though the busyness of the location will obviously affect timing. That said, I've always been satisfied. The food is pretty good, but not the best Thai food in town. It's not bad by any stretch, it's just not the best. I'm still happy to eat there, no problem. I like to get the Prik Pow, made vegan with tofu. At the Downtown location, I order spiciness level 4; in San Marco, I order spiciness level 5. (Downtown is on fire, literally!) I am always happy with my food from either location. The food is usually out quickly and I've never had a messed up order. The prices are a little high, but I figure that I'm paying for ambiance, so I don't worry about it. A lot of the time I get my order to go, so I also chalk it up to paying for convenience.

Great flavor. The dark and stormy coctail was too sweet for my taste, but otherwise it was a great experience."], ["Linsey J.", "I love this restaurant for the mellow ambiance and dynamic food. Cool seats with pillows to sit on, Buddhist embellishments in the decor, low lighting, and a friendly wait staff are what you have to look forward to. The food is delicious. My favorite is the red curry with exotic veggies and scallops. And the crab Rangoon is delightful. Less crowded than the downtown location, but this one stopped serving sushi, which I miss!"], ["Jessica I.", "Food and service is very average and overpriced. \u00a0Let me put it this way...We asked for extra sauce because the noodles were dry and they charged us for it.The entrance \u00a0is awkward since the space is empty with a bar in the middle. \u00a0The bartender gave us a dreary welcome. \u00a0You have to go upstairs for the dining area. \u00a0At 6pm the place is empty."]], "Taste of Thai": [], "Thai Cuisine & Noodle House": [], "Sala Thai Restaurant": []}
