I feel like once you've been to one Japanese-styled hibachi grill restaurant you've been to them all. Same food selections, same taste, same corny chef jokes and same ridiculous prices.We went here for lunch and got hibachi for 3 & spent $75.00. Granted that included gratuity & if it was for dinner that would have been one thing but for just lunch? That's also considering that my husband and I only ordered chicken and my daughter ordered shrimp. I will say that their service was good, they kept our drinks full and their establishment was well-maintained.

Seriously, every seat was occupied and for the first time I didn't mind. Our waitress and waiter were amazing, yes we had two of them, maybe three or four. Every employee was concerned about our dining experience and I can appreciate that.Their dynamite roll was AMAZING! One of the best sushi rolls I've tasted in Jacksonville. My auntie and I both agreed on that. Their fried rice was also great, seriously I could eat it alone. It was bursting with flavor but had no meat, I was definitely surprised.The shrimp, chicken, filet mignon and scallops were all cooked to perfection.The bottom line is that this place is definitely packed for a reason. Their food was hot and flavorful, their customer service is amazing and the dining experience with our family was very memorable. The ONLY con would be that drum they bang for birthdays, after the second birthday I was over it! Seriously, there were like ten birthdays during the time we were there.

Soon we were one to ordering our hibachi entrees... and the signature soup and salads starting making their way to our party. Clear soup was ok... salad was not anything special... even with the ginger dressing. Our server was a bit forgetful and un-attentive, and Mr. Yelp decided to clear his own plate by setting it on a shelf behind us. LOL. So the hibachi chef came out.... he was absolutely hilarious. We were all in good spirits and he laughed and played along with all of our jokes... and did the normal hibachi presentations. (Volcano, shrimp toss etc.) I ordered the shrimp, and they were a tad overcooked. But the veggies and rice were pretty good. There was a bottle of sake ordered at the table, and I did love there was a cucumber slice in the sake glasses... it was a nice mellow addition and I am definitely jumping on the cucumber cocktail bandwagon.

First off the waitress out in the wrong salad knowing this she brought it over anyway and tried to pawn that off on her instead of what she ordered. Still wanted her to pay for it too.

The chef was pretty funny but you can tell that these places are almost all the same. Food: the fried rice was pretty good once I added some flavor to it with the crab sauce and garlic sauce. The tuna was so over cooked almost tough. the shrimp that he added was charcoaled. The scallops that my wife got were cooked nicely but did lack the char or PC caramelized for texture I guess.

The hamachi sashimi were two huge slices of fish, not bad at all. \u00a0Tamago was decent. \u00a0But that ended the good streak for us.... \u00a0The spicy tuna roll was grinded up tuna mixed with spicy sauce. \u00a0So I do prefer my fish a bigger piece instead of grinded, but I've tried spicy tuna roll both ways before. \u00a0And have had good experience even when the tuna was grinded up like this.However, what is disappointing here is that the sushi rice was terrible and the knifework was ... unacceptable. \u00a0Both rolls have very sloppy presentation. \u00a0There were 8-9 pieces per order, which tells me the sushi chef decided to, for whatever reason, cut the pieces small. \u00a0They were uneven, and some parts of these rolls were not covered with rice (i.e. showing seaweed wrapper). \u00a0I do have to say though, that the spicy scollop roll was tasty, if you ignore the rice...So while we were finishing up the not-so-impressive rolls, I saw someone from the kitchen brought a plate of something to the sushi bar. \u00a0And then, I saw the sushi chef vigorously putting all kinds of sauces on that plate. \u00a0I was thinking to myself, \"I feel sorry for the poor bastard who is gonna get that soaked sushi plate mess of a dish....\" \u00a0Guess what, we were that poor bastard! \u00a0That was the hamachi collar....I've had hamachi collar from several different places, this is the first time we had to \"rescue\" the hamachi collar from a soupy mess. \u00a0It was a nicely flamed fish, tender and juicy, but topped, no, bathed in variety of sauces. \u00a0The roe was a nice touch though. \u00a0After our initial panic, we lifted the collar off from it's original dish and set it on the sushi dish (now empty)... and did enjoyed it afterwards. \u00a0But no, it was a regularly portioned hamachi collar for $10.95... I guess the extra 4 bucks was the effort the sushi chef made to \"decorate\" the collar....We probably will not... go back again, given the location (too far from where we live) and the display of sushi. \u00a0The price of hamachi collar was just too high (now that we found another, decently priced, Japense restaurant for the collar)."], ["Crystal B.", "Absolutely amazing.

The noodles themselves were of superior quality. The texture of the noodles were chewy and slightly firm, and I liked it. What I didn't like was the broth. I found it not very flavorful and bland. But overall, I still enjoyed the ramen. However, for the price of $12, I expected it to be a whole lot better! You could get an order of Pho with a lot of meat and noodles for $8 at PK noodles.

I've been here twice already and I never leave unhappy but I also never leave very happy. Hence why I'm giving it the three stars. Last night I came in with my brother, his girlfriend and my daughter. My daughter was pretty hungry so they brought out her chicken udon noodles first. The noodles were pretty tasty. They gave me the option of one vegetable in the noodles after I asked. I requested broccoli for my daughter which was perfectly cooked. Still had a bit of crisp which was nice. The chicken strips were also cooked well. Not to dry and they were pretty soft. The only problem with the noodles was that the udons were all cut up into little pieces. Not sure if this was done because my child is little or if this is how it's normally served. The chicken tempura dinner was okay. Just fried veggies and chicken strips. I am normally okay with that but there was not a single piece of panko breading on this dish. The breading was light and fluffy but not typical of good tempura. The veggies were also a bit oily and soaked thru the batter. They were nice enough to switch the salad for soup since neither me or my daughter would eat it. The staff was friendly but somehow we couldn't get any napkins for the table. I definitely wouldn't turn down coming here with a group of friends but I also won't be making any special trips."], ["Jeana L.", "Great place to eat sushi and ramen. I had the Pink Lady Roll, the Mermaid Roll, and Naruto Roll. Very well prepared and delicious with or without the white shrimp sauce. The Mermaid roll has tuna, salmon, yellowtail, tobiko (the tiny orange fish eggs) avocado, cucumber, and scallion wrapped with a white soybean paper. The pink lady has shrimp tempura, avocado, spicy crabmeat (not that spicy to me), cucumber wrapped with pink soybean paper. The Naruto roll, you can choose between tuna, salmon, crab, spicy tuna or spicy salmon wrapped in very thin slices of cucumber and no rice (very good for low-carb). I had the tuna Naruto roll and it comes with a special sauce (forgot the name of it, but was good) not tempura sauce or soy sauce.

Definitely offers a lot of variety. \u00a0For this round we went with the Lion King, Sweet Heart, Mexican, Black Angel, Fire Dragon, and Oishii Special. The Black Angel sticks out in my mind as it was the last to arrive to the table and it was piping hot. Definitely a couple of these I would order again, but I might venture to try more on the menu first. And like others have said, the plates were beautifully presented. Yes, I know, purists believe sushi shouldn't be cooked. But this was delicious. I will definitely have to remember this place the next time we're in the Tinseltown area and want to grab a bite to eat."], ["Valarie C.", "So amazing! Bento was packed so me and my bf looked up this place on Yelp and stopped in for the first time. What a pleasant experience! The people were so friendly our server was very sweet and helpful.

This gem of a restaurant on Southside is everything you want and more. My date and I haven't had a tremendous amount of sushi here, but she and I both judge a sushi bar by the freshness of its ikka or squid. Here, it is very fresh, not tough, and quite tasty where usually it is a bland protein. With the fresh ginger that accompanies it, the squid is amazing.But what I really really love about this place is its ramen which comes with all the proper accoutrements like fish cake and a few greens, seaweed, etc. I can't even begin to describe the different flavors in each type of broth. The shoyu broth is light but flavorful, nebeyaki udon broth is more intense and feels heavier but is also delicious. Wasn't a big fan of the tonkotsu but I can see why people would like it. The service is great, decor is family style and not fancy.

It hit the spot and as we said at our table, it really \"warmed the soul.\" We ordered two rolls a piece, with a plan to share so we could sample a bit of everything: the sweetheart, black angel, Mexican, spicy dragon, Oishii, and lion heart. All tasted pretty fresh, and the black angel and Oishii were my favorites, with the Mexican coming in a close third. While we had a good dinner, the ambiance was cool, and service was right on, the flavors in the rolls weren't anything extraordinary, but solid.... so that is why I'll give it 3 stars.

But training, temperament, and artistry IS. \u00a0Our next visit: none of the sashimi was fresh. \u00a0Not even the salmon or tuna. \u00a0The waitress (who is great!) remembered how I wanted my fish cut (she called it 'thin'... Though I didn't want it cut 'thin' as much as \"well\" or \"skillfully\"). \u00a0But the sashimi was still against the grain and chewy. \u00a0The sushi was all wet. \u00a0A careful sushi chef would NEVER serve rolls that were sitting in a puddle of water (from cucumber, mango etc having condensation). \u00a0Even from Looking at the man, he is large, gruff, and a bit sloppy. \u00a0If being Japanese is his primary qualification, I would wholeheartedly suggest a samurai lifestyle over that of a sushi chef. \u00a0Unfortunately, we won't be coming back, though this was a tough loss for us as well as for all true sushi enthusiasts (who would rather try the uni than eat 'lava fries'. \u00a0Oh, jacksonville.)."], ["Lydia F.", "Great food , clean and fast.

Each booth can fit about six adults comfortably. There were not many customers on a Wednesday lunch, so there was only one server and one sushi chef in the front. Service was fine, but it took about 20-25 minutes for food to get to our table after placing the order even though there were only two other tables. We ordered Bubba Roll, Catepillar Roll, and a Salmon Box from the lunch menu. The presentation of the sushi and my lunch Salmon Box were both beautiful and tasted delicious.Caterpillar Roll - 5 out of 5 starsI really love this roll and would probably eat this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner if I could. It has spicy salmon (raw), cucumber, and tempura crunch on the inside. It is topped with avocado, honey wasabi sauce, and momiji sauce. However, I didn't get it with cucumber. Both the avocado and salmon tasted really good and fresh, and all the ingredients went very well together. This is one of the best Caterpillar Rolls I've had in Jax (I'm probably a little biased since I love raw salmon). My wife didn't like it as much because there is a noticeably strong wasabi taste due to the honey wasabi sauce. So if you don't like wasabi, be sure to notify your server before hand. Bubba Roll - 4 out of 5 starsIt's a fancy, upgraded shrimp tempura roll! Shrimp tempura and cream cheese inside, wrapped in rice paper; steamed shrimp, avocado, tempura crunchy, and spicy mayo + eel sauce on top. I don't really like rolls with lots of cream cheese, but my wife enjoyed it. The only complaint she had was that the tempura crunchy was a bit old.Salmon Box from Lunch Menu - 5 out of 5 starsYou're going to love this if you like Salmon Sashimi. This meal came with a clear soup and ginger salad, and they were average. The Salmon Box actually came on a plate, and it had Mango, Spicy Salmon with tempura crunchy + three slices of avocado on top, Salmon Kobachi, and steamed rice. The salmon were raw and fresh just to my liking. The Kobachi was covered in a sweet sauce. Our only complaint was that there was too much sauce (both on spicy salmon and the kobachi), and it interfered with the taste of delicious raw salmon. And once again, the tempura crunch on the spicy salmon was old.

He also takes great care of us when we are there. The tempura batter for that special roll was perfect.

We went for lunch on a Monday, and there were only a few people besides us. The wait staff were very friendly and helpful in explaining menu options.

We had James wait on us at our most recent visit and appreciated prompt and genial service. He apologized for the brief waits we experienced during our stay due to it being a busy night at the restaurant. We didn't notice or mind as we were enjoying our conversation but appreciated that he noticed enough to mention it. All of his recommendations were delicious as we combed through their rather large menu. They have everything from sushi and katsu, to udon and soba, to habachi and bento dinners! I've now tried a sampling from each of these categories over my visits and haven't been disappointed.I decided on the Yaki Udon with Seafood Noodle Soup Bowl and it was great. James suggested the seafood over the shrimp only and I thought the broth had tremendous flavor. The noodles were cooked to slightly chewy perfection (as you want with udon) and he even offered to sub the miso soup (which would normally come with the meal) for a double ginger salad. Great! My only comment for the seafood was the krab stick (which I knew it would come with) was still in it's complete \"stick\" form. I would like to see it cut down even a bit, if for not ease of eating (I'm not afraid to slurp!) then for presentation. And there was a soft boiled egg on top, too. My favorite!Hubby had the Chicken Katsu Don which I've ordered twice on previous occasions. This is a fried chicken breast (katsu style) over rice with vegetables and egg served with yummy broth poured all over so it has quite a lot of liquid in the bottom of the bowl. I personally love this dish. The broth is deliciously savory and the chicken portion has always been large. I bring up the liquid portion of the dish as it's not mentioned on the menu and other yelpers may not be familiar with the preparation. If you've never tried it, take a chance! It's so yummy!Finally, we met Chef Terry later in the evening. After the crazy rush earlier, he came out to meet and greet a few of the tables and was genuinely interested in our feedback for our meals. For example, he noticed I had picked off some of my seaweed garnish (only so I could get to the egg underneath more easily!) and made sure I knew it was no problem to modify my order in the future. He was quite lovely to speak with and obviously cares a lot about his restaurant. Finally, my soup was such a large portion that James boxed up my leftovers to go. For a million server points he carefully separated the noodles and seafood from the broth for me in separate containers and set them in a small box so they wouldn't tip over in the bag. You go, Glenn Coco!So glad to have these folks in the neighborhood (I could walk there!) and hope they continue to thrive at the Publix in the shopping center continues to undergo renovation. Looking forward to many happy returns!"], ["Meghan N.", "Such an awesome dining experience.

I read several Yelp reviews that backed up his claims of the amazing sushi!As everyone else has said, you really wouldn't think that this place exists here due to all of the construction going on. Unfortunately they aren't able to have a real sign outside, I'll include a storefront photo for reference. The inside looked very different for what you would expect - the tables and booths were very nice and there were many different colored lights all throughout the restaurant. \u00a0It had a clubby feel to it at first. The Rock Shrimp appetizer was amazing! The shrimp were very flavorful and was complimented with the right amount of sweet chili sauce. I ordered the Sushi Regular entree with Clear Soup instead of Miso. The soup was really good; it was a little darker and the mushrooms were cooked more than most other places. The entree had several types of fish and was really fresh! \u00a0The dish is a chef's choice with your choice of a California or Tuna roll, I went with Tuna. This was more than enough food for a lunch portion but it was so worth it! Presentation plays a big role here, you really feel like you're eating art. My boss previously had a dragon roll that came out looking like a dragon! \u00a0The \"Terry Special\" that he had today included sea urchins, it didn't sound appealing to me but he said it was delicious!"], ["Kimberly V.", "One of my favorite sushi places. Amazing sushi & awesome staff. We ordered sushi online to-go and arrived early. They were busy but We didn't mind the wait at all and we let the server it wasn't a big deal because we arrived early.

I ended up leaving without it bc actually my order had been sitting there for a while and I wasn't told or heard anyone ask.. it was sushi so I was not happy about taking it knowing it was sitting out waiting. I love this place so it's really hard for me to complain but I wasn't the only one.... More than one person sitting next to me had been waiting for over an hour for their take out order.

Decor is nice, with cute decorated blocks on the wall from previous customers. Very clean place overall.

The head was the weirdest part, the taste of it's brains sent a chill down my spine and left me feeling if what I had just done was ethical.

Honestly the only downfall this restaurant could possibly possess is its somewhat limited open hours and non-business on Mondays. And I don't. Give a. Hmmm... ;)The food is awesome. Fresh-to-death and tasty. The menu isn't long at all, which I love, especially when it comes to sushi. Best hibachi I've ever had, and it doesn't even need a show. I can't stand sushi rolls that can't be eaten in one bite and are doused in sauces, which this place does NOT offer. Awesome! But you can also create your own roll! Even the clear soup, in my opinion, is richer than any I've gotten at other hibachi/sushi restaurants. Yum. \u00a0Service is on point, dine-in or take-out. So nice!They're expanding soon.

When I brought it up to the manager (owners wife) all she said in broken english was it's not a bug, it's just bones no big deal. Then took the evidence that was in my mouth with her bare hands and went to throw it away. I was in such disgust and shock...I told the server and asked the Chef/owner to come out. He apologized and said that they would look into. He told me if I get sick or have to go to the hospital he would pay for it. However, he didn't take the roll off the bill and I didn't eat any of it.

We went on a Saturday, which was a busy night and immediately walked into a cluster of people standing at the door. The wait area was full and we barely squeezed in. When we got to the hostess, we weren't even acknowledged. We stood there for five minutes while a young lady was pecking away at the register buttons and not once did she say she'd be right with us. Then, a woman came and finally asked our name and party size. By this time, I was already turned off. We got seated and our waiter was extremely pleasant. He would be the only reason I give this place 2 stars. He was so sweet and attentive. He made up for the lack of customer service we had previously encountered. Now on to the food. This is not your traditional Japanese hibachi place. Not only do you NOT get noodles with your hibachi meal, you also have to pay $2.50 if you want mushrooms!!! Aside from that, the shrimp sauce didn't even taste like your normal shrimp sauce. The lava fries were \"OK\" nothing worth having again. And to top it off, the fried calamari doesn't even look like calamari! They looked like fish sticks and even had a fish texture. Call me crazy but, aren't calamari typically ring shaped??

There is only one grill you can sit at that only holds three people. They have another grill that is unoccupied by customers since that grilled is used to cook the various customer's habachi food on it. I ordered the calamari and white fish from the habachi menu. The squid was soft and wasn't chewy. There wasn't really any flavor to the squid and it tasted very bland. The white fish was bland as well. Not really tasty at all. The miso soup was good. The salad was good with the dressing. It had a different good taste that I haven't ate before from the other Japanese restaurants I've been to. The fried rice was okay but not up to par with other fried rice. The vegetables in the habachi didn't taste that good. There was no sauces to dip in that you would be normally a custom to at a habachi restaurant. I ordered a rainbow sushi roll. The sushi wasn't really that fresh."], ["Theresa P.", "Just had the soup and it was delicious. The salad with ginger dressing was kind of boring but we didn't go for the salad.

Hana Yori is tucked away in a lil shopping plaza on the right side, right after the Alahambra Dinner Theatre. We get in and get seated. My attention immediately shifts to the walls. They have these little wooden \"placards\" that you get to custom \"sharpie\" up. Then, after your done eating they will stick it up and you'll be in their Wall of Fame. I couldn't stop looking at everyone's designs and thinking about what I was going to put on my little wooden panel. The lava fries are the truth! Next time I would skip everything and get 3 orders of it. If you've had Carne Asada fries in California this is the Japanese version. It's just shredded crabmeat, like a shrimp sauce, and french fries. Don't let the simple ingredients fool you, because with there powers combined will blow your socks off! The owner came around and I basically interviewed him. I told him how surprised i was that the Sake we ordered was only $5.50. He said they want everything to be affordable. He told me that the couple beside us, he's been serving for 10 years and when they came in they don't even need menus. I asked him how did you get the idea for the placards on the wall? He said that he wanted a way to get the community involved (which is genius when you see it, its like leaving a piece of you in the restaurant), he said that he had over 3,000 placards to put up! \u00a0He told me the different meanings of Hana which means flower, one, victory, or heaven. Yori I will have to fill you in later cause I forgot and there closed today lol. I will update this as soon as i can.

In fact we were one of the other 4 small tables they had. What grossed me out even more was that I accidentally watched one of the waitstaff made salads with BAREHANDS. This point I wished I didn't eat the salad they gave. Food was alright, the chicken was too salty and hard at one point. I don't know why the hibachi vegetable was charged the same price was the chicken. Does tofu cost the same price?Anyways, this experience wasn't what I was expected from what others said.

I would probably recommend going to another place that has better sushi. They offer free miso soup and salad for lunch."], ["Michelle B.", "Love, love, love this place! I've been going to Crazy Sushi for years now. One of my favorite sushi restaurants in Jacksonville. The homemade ginger dressing they put on their salad is like no others. I used to buy it separately for my own salads I make at home since its so good. There's so many delicious rolls to try. The Cold Roll is very refreshing since its wrapped in cucumber. I love the sushi sandwich since it has a little bit of everything (spicy tuna, eel, salmon, avocado) that's layered so it's not your typical roll. A few other good ones are caterpillar (if you like fresh seaweed), Florida roll (cooked), spicy octopus, EST roll, and Snow White. There's so many other ones but those are just a few that I order on a regular basis. I definitely recommend trying Crazy out if you love Sushi! You won't be disappointed."], ["Rachel D.", "If you love Japanese food this is the real deal. They're sushi is so freakin delicious I swear it sets it apart from all other Japanese restaurants I've been too. I recommend their grilled salmon teriyaki with \u00a0either steak, chicken, scallops, or shrimp. Get the combo so you can try a little of everything. It's grilled to perfection and the teriyaki sauce omg it's perfect. Not runny or too thick. You can really savor with each bite.I have been to this restaurant for a decade now and I have seen many other restaurants come up but none are as good as this. Plus pricing is decent. I can't go on about the food because I have tried basically everything and the whole menu is just that good. They don't have a cooking show apart from other Japanese restaurants but their recent extension improved the place overall. Trust me from a Japanese food addict. If you want the best sushi in Jacksonville, this is it!"], ["Sarah D.", "This is my favorite sushi restaurant in Jacksonville! I have yet to find a place better than this. I always order the Crunch roll and a spicy tuna roll while my husband orders the spicy red rose and sakura rolls. We typically start off with clear soup and salads with ginger. Crazy Sushi is always busy but I have never had to wait to be seated since they expanded....which makes my experience even better when i go. \u00a0The wait staff are very pleasant and the sushi is always made exactly how we ordered it and quickly. We even took our French exchange student here and the waitress was very patient as we had to translate what was in the rolls to out student. She even brought other diners orders to show her what each looked like. We go here at least once every other week and I don't see that changing any time soon."], ["Jennifer W.", "Fresh sushi, clean atmosphere, friendly wait staff."], ["Ryan C.", "Order pick up quite frequently from crazy sushi and my girlfriend and I love it. Dining in is great also because they always have enough staff for the business to operate smoothly with great customer \u00a0service. My go to sushi place \u00a0near my house."], ["Stacey H.", "Been my go-to for years. \u00a0Best sushi and hibachi."], ["girl a.", "The food was average. Disappointing because of the numerous reviews raving about the food. The portions were generous, but when the food is lacking in flavor it doesn't really matter the portion size was large. The service was slow. The waitress never asked how the food, offering soda refills after we finished. Only 2 other tables so I'm not sure why we never saw her."], ["M N.", "My family has been eating their top notch food since early years of spring breaking here in Jacksonville . Now as a resident, we can't get enough of Crazy Sushi!!! We have tried everything on their menu and nothing has disappointed us. Very friendly staff whether dining in or taking out."], ["Lisa C.", "This is our go to spot for Sushi in Jacksonville. The food is priced well. The food is always great. And you really walk out of there with a full stomach and a happy wallet. We typically splurge on the edamame and the gyoza and two or three sushi rolls. The only thing I feel they can improve on is the service. Nearly everytime we go we have to flag down a server when/if we need something.. Being regulars this is really an annoyance."], ["Robert M.", "My server was very prompt, nice and even helped me with my order. I had the Jaguar, Tampa Bay and the Nobody Home rolls. The Tampa Bay is baked and the Nobody Home is tempura deep fried. It was my favorite of the three. My only tip is to make sure to eat it first as my last two pieces were too cooled off and had a stale bite to them. \u00a0But the first part of the roll was delicious.The only downside was that do not have any baked muscles and I was craving muscles."], ["Nhi T.", "Excellent sushi!!!!! Enough said! It got a 4 star rating due to awkward service. Had multiple waitresses ask the same question over and over....and we had no idea which sushi roll was which! But it was good! Also, soup and salad is free! :)"], ["Jeff T.", "Crazy Good Food - great fresh sushi selections - great ala carte choices - great meal choices! Staff are very nice and efficient."], ["Jen R.", "Some of the best sushi I've had in Jax to date!PARTICULARLY accommodating to large groups. Any time my friends and I have a birthday, this is our place of choice to celebrate. Happily and easily takes care of groups of 16+. Everyone is always pleased with delicious food and fantastic, friendly service! Some of my faves are the tuna tataki, and the salmon skin rolls!"]], "Sake House": []}
