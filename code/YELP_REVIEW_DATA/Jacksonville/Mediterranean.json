The presentation of the food was very beautiful and full of colors. The meal comes with rice, tahini, chopped onions/tomatoes/parsley, and a basket of pita bread. It also comes with a side of super sour yogurt sauce. The chicken was slightly spicy & sour and flavorful. The veggies had lemon juice on it and was sour. I put the tahini sauce on the pita bread, veggies on top of that, and then the chicken shawarma. Then I proceeded to dip it into the yogurt sauce, and it tasted delicious.

They are a very small restaurant located on Atlantic Blvd just east of St Johns Bluff. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by the owners and took a seat. We all decided to get a bunch of food and try everything (because that's how we roll!) We started with Mantu, which are steamed dumplings filled with onions and ground beef, topped with yogurt, split peas, and ground beef. I absolutely loved these. The flavor combination was perfection and I thought the yogurt sauce was a nice zing thrown into the mix.We also ordered Sambosa, which is fried pastry stuffed with ground beef, onion, and cilantro. These were also wonderful, but the star of this dish was the dipping sauce. I'm not sure what all is in there, but I want it to put on everything that I eat from now on. I kept the leftover sauce and dipped everything I could in there, and it tasted great on everything! The dumplings were not greasy as you might expect from a fried dish, and the filling was plentiful and very flavorful. There are two versions of this appetizer, so next time I will try the other so I can compare (it is a meatless option that includes potatoes in the filling).One of my friends at the table ordered the Grape Leaves. I am not a huge fan of grape leaves in general, but I thought these were very good.For my entr\u00e9e I got the Falafel Platter, which includes basmati rice, hummus, and tabbouleh. For starters, the hummus is some of the best I have had! It is very creamy and has a pleasant flavor to it, not too much garlic like some other places in town. The tabbouleh was also a pleasant surprise with it's rich lemon flavor and the basmati rice was plentiful and delicious. The owner told us that he uses a higher quality rice, and it really shows in the final product. I also was a fan of the falafel (which I dipped in that green sauce!) Even with my plate being all vegetarian, I didn't feel like I was missing anything at all! All of the items on the plate had their own distinctive flavor and tasted different than the same dishes from other restaurants.My friend Nate got the Lamb Shwarma Platter. Just like mine, it came with basmati rice, hummus, and tabbouleh. I am new to lamb, but I took a piece and thought it was really good. I loved the flavor and the spices that it was cooked with were great. Others at the table have declared this lamb to be the best they have ever had!While I was paying I happened to see the baklava just sitting there asking to be bought, so I happily obliged. I noticed too late that there were also some interesting looking pastries in a case and asked the owner what they were. He told me it was an elephant ear and gave me one to try. I thought that was so nice of him! When I got home I tried both, and they are both great! The baklava is nice and sweet and the elephant ears were sweet and crunchy. It was a great way to end the night!Verdict: Loved it!!I am so happy that I tried Ariana Kabob because I now have a new favorite place! Everything was super authentic and fresh and the prices were very good. The owners were very friendly and kind, and they can sure cook some delicious food!

The lamb was good in both the kebab and Shwarma, if a little on the pricier side. The Mantu was very good and flavorful. The pita is amazing warm but once it hits room temperature it's extremely tough and hard to chew. I will say I was very disappointed with the Baklavah, because there was little to no honey (which I've always thought is part of what makes the dessert so good), and since it's their only dessert on the menu you may want to go somewhere else after your meal for a sweet treat.

I'm and he just glad I didn't have to say it I could just type it. He was so nice and so nice and offered some suggestions. But, I went with the combo. It is a little pricey but after I finished it, it was worth it. I got a kebob of Lamb, Chicken, and Kefta. The kefta is a middle eastern spiced ground beef and everything was grilled to tender juicy goodness. Everything I ate was very tasty and you could really taste the wood fire grill.

One or two matching pieces is a bit more relaxing and less overbearing. The chairs and tables make no sense together. Simply getting matching chairs and tables and repainting the floor and de-cluttering the walls would dramatically improve the restaurant. The fridges that show the fresh hand-made baklava, felafel and other dessert is nice for a cafe style.The music is a *touch* on the loud side, but enjoyable for what it is intended to do. SERVICE: Unfortunately, because this restaurant is so unheard of we were one of just one or two customers in the course of the entire hour. That said, it made for immaculate and punctual service, unsurprisingly. Tabouleh really needs to make a greater effort to reach out to the community and get people through the doors. People should be breaking the doors down for their baklava!FOOD: Absolutely delicious. I ordered the Caesar salad with the Chicken Gyro. The chicken had just the right amount tapered off perfectly with the sour cream. I couldn't stop eating. The chicken was thinly sliced but perfectly cooked and moist, and as any cook knows, that's hard to achieve. The baklava was delicious, a tad runny, (you eat it by picking it up they do not provide a fork; I admit it seems a bit pretentious for them to expect you to eat baklava with your hands). I would have preferred a fork to avoid the runniness. OVERALL: This place is a place I will frequent. I think a lot of improvements should be made, especially to bring more customers in, (nothing would break my heart more than to see this place close). A note to the front of house manager if he ever sees this, advertising is just one way of reaching out to your community.

It looks like somebody different has taken over management or ownership. The very first thing I noticed were hand-written notes posted EVERYWHERE. Some were advertisements for menu items, but a lot of them were admonishments: \"Do not enter!\" next to the counter - do you really have a problem with customers going behind the counter? Our service was quite poor and we actually needed to get some things ourself since we weren't getting any attention at all, so maybe that's why people were going back there? Oh, and on the register \"Sauce is 50 cents each. How many do you want?\" Very inviting. In the past we were always served sauce with our dishes - I understood it was part of the dish.

We spent about $40 there... my daughter got a \"salad\" which was a plate of iceberg lettuce with one thing of dressing, my wife ordered the gyro platter which was a mound of rice with some dried out gyro shavings on top and nothing else, and I spent $14 on a platter which consisted of only 2 ounces of tasty lamb meat on a huge mound of rice, no sauce (that's extra now I guess), 3 thin slices of raw green pepper, and a handful of raw onions, which was served to me about 15 minutes after my wife and daughter got their food. We also got 3 cans of soda. They have a fountain which is out in the customer area like most restaurants, but there is a sign on it saying that refills cost money... once again, the manager or owner is now grubbing for money and it is such a turn-off. I cannot believe that this place we went to a few weeks ago is the same restaurant we loved so much in May of 2014. It must be under different ownership or management. Anybody who walks in can immediately tell that this restaurant is there to make the owner money and nothing else. There is no customer-centeredness, there is no focus on putting out good food like before. I would say I'm never going back, but I would bet my next paycheck this place will be out of business by the end of the year. It's sad too, because this was one of the first restaurants that caught my attention when we moved to the area, and I was so excited to have a high-quality Afghani restaurant right by our house. Now... so sad."], ["Cheuk K.", "I ordered a mixed gyro platter for pick up here, and it was done in 10 minutes. I only went into the store briefly to pick up my order, but the owner warmly greeted me and he was very friendly. There was a sign on the cash register that says $10 minimum for credit cards, but the owner lets me use my card anyway even though my order was only ~$9.50. Very good customer service.Overall, the platter was delicious, and there's plenty of food. The meats were tender, and the rice was cooked just right. The white sauce was very tasty and tied the dish together. I wish the platter came with more sauce. The only thing I didn't like was that the bread was too hard/tough as if it's been sitting out for a while. Another thing is that these platters are very greasy (though delicious) and you probably shouldn't come here if you were trying to lose some pounds. I ate the meal at 8pm, and I still feel stuffed at 1:30am! This is a good place in the area to get some Mediterranean food."], ["Jebs M.", "This place is such a disappointment!!

There aren't many places to find those whirling meat torpedoes in this bold city, but Kabob-E makes a really good one.I stopped by at dinner after a long day at the office. Nothing brightens my day quite like the smell of fat crisping away in front of a broiler. I ordered a gyro with fries and a bottle of water, which came out to 8 bucks and change. I watched as the cook carved away a ton of gyro meat for me, and assembled everything on a freshly griddled pita.Kabob-E is not shy with their meat(!) and I was really happy with the amount of protein stacked on this bad boy. The gyro was piled high with lettuce, tomato, thinly sliced onions and a delicious tzatziki sauce. The tzatziki was a little thin, but overall the gyro was very good.It came out atop a mound of piping hot french fries. They were just crinkle cut french fries but they were tasty. I'd like to think I'll come try some of the other items, but I know that I'll never be able to say no to the gyros when I walk in."], ["Miss C.", "Perfectly courteous and attentive customer service.

In fact all of their tapas are phenomenal but I'm a particular fan of their hummus and grape leaves, they just do it so well. On top of that their Turkish coffee....oh my god....so stinking good. Top this all off with outdoor seating and this is a favorite spot to hangout for a while with tapas, friends and coffee.Unfortunately I've had several different entrees and none of them hit quite the same level of awesomeness as their tapas. It's not that its bad, it's just that I always end up thinking I should have just gotten more hummus. I'll also say that while I love outside seating the people at the coffee shop further down the way tend to smoke a lot so if you're allergic you may want to sit inside.Ultimately this place is AMAZING for tapas, and you should definitely go...just order more tapas rather than more food."], ["Alyssa P.", "We dined in around 4:30 or so think we were the only table there. \u00a0Ordered the hummus, calamari, and Chicken Kabob.Hummus - was ok; definitely not the best. The pita was really good and tasted homemade. Calamari - my daughter liked it a lot bc she said the batter tasted like mozzarella stick batter. I agree on the batter taste. Texture was chewy and sauce tasted like salsa, not marinara. For nearly $10, I expected it to taste better with more pieces. Shish Taouk (Chicken Kabob) - Dish was colorful, veggies cooked perfectly. Chicken pieces very tender and flavorful. They also removed the pieces from the skewers which made it effortless to eat. I can make very similar kabobs at home so for almost $15 I feel it's over priced and besides it's just chicken. The dish price is comparable with an entr\u00e9e that contains seafood. Service was fine lol since we were the only table there."], ["Angelo K.", "Food is good. Server smells like a bottle of VODKANever stop by to the table HORRIBLE. Giving 2 stars beacuse of the Food.

The service was exceptional, the food was remarkable! It has a fancy feel to it, a restaurant where you would have dinner and show at. We ordered the hummus, which was warmed up and served with pita (which our server kept refilling every 5 minutes)! It tasted a bit better than the hummus I usually purchase at Publix. Then we moved onto the main course. We ordered the mixed grill and beef and chicken shawarma. The mixed grill comes with 3 meats: beef, chicken, and lamb. We chose the seasoned potatoes on the side, which turned out to be exquisite. The meats in the shawarmas were excellently cooked and seasoned. I highly recommend this restaurant. It's a nice setting, excellent food, and you'll be thinking about it long after the meal is over."], ["Michael A.", "My first time at Mandaloun Mediterranean Cuisine was an overall positive experience. You really can't judge a book by the cover is the motto that I would use with this place. The outside appearance of the strip mall where this restaurant is located is deceiving because the inside decor is really well put together. The inside was very clean and nicely arranged. The ambiance created by red walls (#50shadesofgrey) mixed in with the fresh flowers at the table and slightly dimmed lights give a nice ROMANTIC vibe. I would really recommend this place for a date!The service that I experienced wasn't as pleasant as other reviewers may have experienced. My date and I went there around 8pm, and the restaurant wasn't too busy. But, I believe our waiter was maybe new or maybe they were short staffed at that time because the wait to get our order placed was pretty excessive (~20mins). There was also times where my glass of water stayed emptied for a period of time. HOWEVER, when the waiters were there, they were super friendly and nice. I would HIGHLY recommend the MIXED GRILL! Each one of the grilled meats were very TENDER and very well SPICED! If you are unsure of what to order, I would recommend this plate too because it gives you variety of different meats just in case you don't like one! I doubt that you wouldn't like any of them ;) The appetizer that I recommend is the COMBO PLATTER. You get to select different types of dips and items to use with your pita bread. I picked the Hummus ( very good! made from fresh chickpeas), Tabbouleh (very delicious-It was my favorite!!!), Labneh (tasted very fresh and it was some of the best that I've tasted), and Fatayer. I went on a Friday, so we got to enjoy a belly dancing show. The dancer was very good and interactive with the customers. She didn't seem to bother anyone by being able to see what customers wanted to interact with her. Very professional and good show. HANDS DOWN... YOU MUST TRY THE BAKLAVA!!! IT IS AMAZING!! I am not for sure if they make it freshly there, but it was the best tasting Baklava that I have EVER tasted!! I would highly recommend this place to anyone."], ["Jesse C.", "The owner was friendly but I guess they had to be. Food was great but kinda expensive for me $24 for 4 pieces of tiny 3in lamb chops..

I wasn't excited about the falafel but at least I can say I tried it. The hummus was the best hummus I've ever had. I was hoping the Fatayer was similar to a Spanikopita but it wasn't. It was ok. The service was superb and the main entree was perfection. The ambiance inside of the restaurant is very relaxing and welcoming. There were multiple door stop delivery people picking up orders there so I knew the food had to be worth it. The salmon was full of flavor and not overcooked. The vegetables and potatoes were perfect. The yellow rice had a lot of flavor but I like the potatoes over the rice. The mixed grill was tender but next time I'll order two chicken kabobs instead of the lamb. We usually love lamb but the minced lamb wasn't my favorite.

And all the things you get in the Grand Mezze are great as left overs. The food is ALWAYS fresh.... you can tell. And the owner Pierre is ALWAYS walking the room making you feel so welcome. Service is great. The prices are good for what you get. One dish I tried on our last visits was their version of moussaka.... and they make it in a Lebanese tradition, which is different than what you will normally fin d at a Greek restaurant. It was amazing! Pierre will \"custom\" make pretty much make whatever you ask. For instance, my daughter is Glutton Free... and he made several 'refinements' to a dish she wanted to try... all with glutton free ingredients. He even had half way decent glutton free bread he served in a separate basket. Please do not let the (what I think) unattractive exterior of the building deter you from giving Pierre and the Mandaloun restaurant a try. You will be happy you did. As a side note...

My food was ready by the time I was done paying (a very reasonable $9!) and we headed outside to snag a table. The weather was fabulous and the leaves were falling on the bustling 5 points corner, making it feel more like a warm day in September despite the fact that we're inching into December. The falafel was crisp on the outside and flavorful, soft and warm on the inside, just as it should be. The tabouli was refreshing and crunchy, and I guess the grapeleaves were good, but I really just need to admit to myself that I don't like grapeleaves and stop ordering them. They just look so good! But yeah, they were acidic and mushy as usual, so I guess that means they were made well? All in all, the experience at Hovan was great.

And now I also love Hovan Mediterranean Gourmet, because they did such a fine job with both of them. I'd like to return the favor with a very strong three stars. I'd give it four, but Hovan isn't an amazing place just shy of outstanding, five-star eateries (13Gypsies or Tento, for instance). The interior is all about plastic tablecloths and paper napkins; our sandwiches came in plastic baskets. It's like a fast-food joint with local art inspired by the Mediterranean. Actually, according to their website, Hovan is a small franchise chain found throughout the southeast that began in Atlanta. Thanks, Atlanta.Lackluster interior aside, Hovan puts together a fine meal, serves it up fast, and barely dents your wallet. That's why it should probably get four stars for knowing what it is and doing it quite well.I've had some nasty dolmades (looking at you, 3rd Street Diner -- how can you coat them with Hollandaise sauce?!?) and some amazing ones (Saad's in West Philly -- why didn't he start franchising?). The LDC and I agreed that Hovan's dolmades fell near the higher end of the scale. The tzaziki sauce had plenty of pep and wasn't as lifeless as it can be at many places. LDC's lentil soup was thick and yummy. She also loved her vegan Hovan Roll with hummus and tabbouli salad. My gyro was excellent. The meat was tangy, the sandwich arrived nice and hot, and the salad was fresh. Topped it off with a $3 Shock Top beer. Prices are reasonable compared to similar places.Hovan also has some shaded outdoor tables that seemed perfect for a sunny day lunch or dinner. A fine choice in Five Points.

My first visit, a waitress basically talked about how bad the owner was in running the business. My entire meal was listening to this conversation between her and a family member. We were the only customers (early dinner) The food was good and even still the waitress was very helpful to us. I really like the rolled eggplant and a chicken/ mushroom/ cream dish. The baba ghanoush and hummus was also very good. Second visit, everything on the buffet was the same. There was an older man who spoke to my husband and his friend throughout the entire meal. Again, a different waitress kept up on our table. It was also a good experience. This last visit, not so much. The waitress kept up with clearing plates. There were three other tables besides us. The baba/ hummus and grape leaves were on par as my previous visits. The lentil soup seemed more watered down than before. The rice was on the mushy side. My favorite rolled eggplant- UGH. Now it is just eggplant and a sliver of cheese drowned in vegetable oil. Before, there was peppers and onions and olive oil. Now it's greasy, bland and yuck. The creamy chicken dish was not good either. More bland than before and soupy. The grilled veggies now how some sour ingredient added (lemon or citric acid, I don't know) but it was off putting and very sour. I did enjoy the spicy version of the grilled chicken breast though I must have gotten an old one because my first two were extremely good and the third was dried out like jerky. I didn't eat much at all because I could taste the differences in my last visit. I didn't enjoy anything. Except for the hot tea and the appetizers. I don't mind change, but when you expect certain things and then they are completely different- that's another story. The new cook/ owners aren't trying the food because it totally lacks flavor or care. Overcooked rice and bland everything else, I'm good. I'll go elsewhere next time or just wait for the holidays spent with my husband Arabic family.

If they were to add some traditional sauce, and maybe some mint, or lettuce and tomato, the sandwich would have been very good, but as it was served it's 2 plus stars for the moist chicken, bit total lack of cohesiveness as a sandwich.

Still, he ordered the grape leaves which were served hot and \"had an interesting texture\" with a side of hummus that received the same review as mine above. I have to admit that my greatest disappointment is to find yet another Mediterranean restaurant that has gyros with the bastardized gyro meat that is far removed from the traditional meat cut off the rotating skewer; like cheap lunch meat making a horrible gyro. I did not order it this time, but had it on my first visit and confirmed they still serve this inferior product (which is why I did not order).This is defintely an okay diner that serves passable food for the most part. \u00a0However, they could really be a little gem of San Marco if their food would reflect a little more passion and cohesiveness. \u00a0I'm still hoping for this place, but I'm unlikely to return."], ["Michael C.", "Basic sit down joint in the heart of San Marco.
