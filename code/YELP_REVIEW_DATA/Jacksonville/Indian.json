So when I offered to take her to lunch for her birthday, this was her first choice. The area is busy (especially at lunch time) but the restaurant itself wasn't crazy busy. The service was okay, our waiter was very soft spoken (my mother and I are not) and because we're weren't sure of the procedure (we saw people go up the counter to pay but he brought us our check for example), we were kinda of confused throughout.The food, though, was great. I'm normally very wary of buffets and when we first arrived the buffet was rather sparse and I was a bitter concerned. The second time we went up, everything was refilled, piping hot, and very tasty. We also loved the naan, super buttery and yummy. I paid about $17 (pre-tip) for lunch for 2, which is a great price for the amount of items we got to taste.

I came into India house after a TERRRRRRRIIIBBBLLLLEEEE experience at masala Indian cuisine on San Jose. The service was AMAZING!!!!! So helpful and polite.

He was so helpful and assisted me with the menu. He gave me his opinion of entrees and i got what he suggested, which was delicious! I never worried about my drink not being filled. I wanted to try sauces but didn't know the names and he brought more. His name is Sudar. He seemed to be the only server and there was like 15 tables. He was fantastic!!! He was attentive to me and everyone around him. I was even more so looking at the service based on the terrible service i just received at masala. Would absolutely return. Would absolutely recommend.

The only thing I have ever heard is that it's really spicy. So, I was expecting to have my tastebuds destroyed, my children and I Yelped India House along with many other places. We drove from Georgia just to enjoy something different and were not disappointed. The Naan was to die for, not sure what the chip type bread was but it was unique and my children loved the blueberry type sauce. I ordered the Maharajah plate and my head almost exploded. There was such complexity in the food I literally overloaded my tastebuds. My eldest daughter ordered Lamb curry she loved it, but was just sad that \"they killed a poor little lamb for such delicious food\". My middle child just couldn't stop telling all her friends what she had although I didn't know. All in all this place is Epic, I recently had to be fitted for a tux at Men's warehouse in River city.

The staff is courteous and attentive. The weekend desserts are on point. The restaurant setting (compared to the other two restaurants) is more relaxing and never overcrowded, unlike 5th Element. If you don't eat meat, like me, then this place has the best options for veggie dishes. Don't get me wrong, they have plenty of meats as well. The variety on a daily basis is mind shattering. The buffet prices are all pretty comparable between the three restaurants with India's Restaurant being the cheapest.

You won't regret it."], ["Kathi T.", "Had dinner there last night with hubby...he kept saying \"wow,\" while shaking his head in disbelief at how good it was. \"It's like an explosion of flavors on my tongue,\" he described. I have to agree. Hubby is more well versed in Indian food than I am, but this is my new favorite Indian restaurant. We shared an appetizer platter of fried foods (not something we would normally order!) and almost didn't have room for dinner even though we didn't finish the whole thing. We then split the Kings Platter - so yummy!!! Two of the dishes were a little too spicy for me even though we ordered mild (the spinach and lentil dishes) so the hosts had a couple small batches made up just for me, and I now know to order \"extra mild.\" The Indian iced tea was delicious too. Yum, yum, yum! The chicken curry dish was our favorite. Also had the mullagatawny soup -we both loved it. We left stuffed AND took home leftovers.

We went on a Saturday and opted for the lunch buffet, so that we could try a little bit of everything, which I think is probably the best way to really introduce yourself to Indian food if you're not familiar. Everything was VERY good tasting. The servers and hostess were all very nice and attentive with your beverages and such. The only complaint that we both had is that the buffet food wasn't hot at all really (temperature wise). Nearly on the verge of cold actually. I think the food would have been even better hot. In fact I know it was because we went back for more Panteer and a new hot batch came out, and it was heaven!

There was a good food smell in the air that boded well for what we would get. We are vegetarians so I got palak paneer and DH ordered veggie korma and some naan for the table. I liked that their heat scale is 1-10 so you can really customize your spice tolerance. Our food came quickly and everything was really good. Nicely spiced and generous portions. We both REALLY liked the korma dish.The service was prompt and personable and we will definitely be back to try some other dishes.

An authentic-style stainless tray of no fewer than six different dishes, plus a generous basket of hot buttery naan. I think it was $8.95, which is a pretty terrific lunch price considering you get a wide array of aromatic, spicy, sweet and crispy all in the same meal. The menu had several items not found at every single other Indian restaurant in Jacksonville. Good for you, Zesty.The kitchen has definitely got it going on--but \"not so much\" with the wait staff. Our server was pleasant enough and got our orders right, but she seemed like she had never waited tables before.

I don't even need the meat, just the sauce and nann and I'm good. That's how much I love it. If you have nut allergies I would stay away from the rice pudding, it had some kind of nut in it.

I literally had to roll it in its own grease at the bottom of the pan so it wouldnt be so dry. I was also told that children three and under were free so why was i getting charged for my almost 3 \u00a0year old who only ate naan bread? \"Its because of the food she wasted\" I was told.

Lamb chunks were chewy. No taste in curry. \u00a0no salt at all. The saag was pathetic. I was very dissappointed. 2 teas, maincourse and appetizer was $52 plus 8 dollar tip. I didn't feel like it was worth it. Ambience: Waitress was staring at my friend a alot. Ambience and cleanliness was good. Tables are wobbly. Water that was served was not filtered.

I've been to every other indian restaurant and the food quality doesn't compare to Masala. I really love Indian cuisine and was introduced to this place by my friend Pathik, who is Indian, and insisted that the food here was pretty awesome! He was right! I've tried all the various curries they offer as well as other staple dishes. The garlic naan is the best I ever had and is a must order for me when I come here. We run through at least three orders of them per visit. The Samosa Chaat is amazing here as well. Hands down the best I've had anywhere. The staff are friendly but can seem a little awkward at times but that's no big deal. Service is always very good and the food is always hot and fresh too. The only reason I gave them four stars and not five is because there have been two occasions where I wanted to try their Masala Dosa but was told that \"the woman who makes it\" was not there that day. Maybe one day she will be there so I can give theirs a try. This is definitely my go to spot for delicious and authentic Indian cuisine."], ["Dmachop C.", "Good indian buffet and variety of dishes.

Went for the lunch buffet after a business meeting down the street. It was fairly busy inside which is always a good sign. The buffet had a very good selection. Most buffet have limited amount of meat, there is always the standard tandoori chicken and usually one other meat dish such as chicken tikka masala. This place had the tandoori, chicken tikka masala as well as chicken curry, goat curry and two other chicken dishes. I was pleasantly surprised with this. I tried a little of everything, not bad, very average tasting Indian fare. The palak paneer was just ok and I thought the rice was a bit dry. The naan was good but thinner than I'm used to.

I think they just... well... forgot there is a table behind the host stand. \u00a0Unfortunately the food was decent but not good enough for us to make the trek over to this side of town instead of our go-to places. \u00a0And the service sure won't motivate us either."], ["Christine M.", "What a wonderful restaurant! My very first experience with Indian cuisine (with the exception of yummy samosas purchased at RAM from The Bread Company) was at Masala and, boy, did I fall in love! The restaurant has an inviting atmosphere with a warm color scheme and 'private' booths. Televisions play Indian pop music videos, which I love. The vocals are beautiful and the choreography is so interesting that I get distracted, but then I remember the delicious fare I have before me and I'm right back to nomming!The servers are nice, and the food has always come out promptly and piping hot when I've been. They have a pretty comprehensive selection of different Indian cuisine preparations (curry, tandoori, makhani, korma, and much more!) My favorite is the Shrimp Masala, Indian hot please! Goat curry is awesome, as well. The crispy roti has a nice flavor, accompanied by fresh chutney. Not the best samosas, but they're still tasty. I like that they put cumin seeds and peas in the basmati. And of course, flavorful and fresh naan varieties! It's a personal mission to try something from every part of the menu, I need to become more knowledgeable of Indian cuisine.My visits have only been for dinner, but I want to go for their lunch buffet soon!

The garlic naan was crazy good!!! we had the chicken tika masala, and a paneer coconut curry dish. Both very different intense flavors.

The unimaginative name doesn't help much nor does the fettered welcoming of the sardarji. However, all bad things end there.The place is decent sized and has nice and clean seating area with buffet tables on the top right corner. The weekdays buffet at 6.99 is more than a bargain with small varieties from both the Veg and non-veg world.The pulao rice was flavorful. The fresh-cut of salad vegetables, mint chutney veg-samosa, pakora, and raita were good starters. The samosa was good but veg-pakora was alright. The daal makhnai was good, chana daal could have been better. Most of the other veggie items like spinach, beans were good but was somewhat disappointed with the kadhi, I expected that to be good for restaurants from North, nonetheless, I felt the vegetarian options were pretty good and unlike other restaurants of the area, distinctly lacked the abundance of oil and spice, in a good way.The tandoori chicken was fresh, moist and flavorful but butter chicken was something to forget.The goat curry, albeit, a little salty than I prefer, was one of the best I've tasted so far in Jacksonville. I would go there just to eat rice and goat curry.The great tasting rice pudding/kheer was a nice way to end the meal.The service was unassuming and attentive.

I've seen some varied reviews about the buffet, which I can't speak to, as I've only been in for dinner. And I've been to dinner several times over the past 5 years, but it was before I started Yelping, so when a friend told me she was craving Indian, I suddenly started craving it too (funny how that happens, right?) so off we went. There were four of us, all with pretty adventurous palates, and my only demand (and the one thing I always just have to order) is saag paneer. (Spicy spinach and cheese, please!) We decided on two combo dinners for two: the vegetarian and meat platter. The saag paneer is SO GOOD. So good, I would have been fine with just that, but the lentil and lamb additions were delicious as well, and you get a sampler platter of appetizers (both meat and veggies) that really hit the spot, and there was not a thing I didn't really like. Well, the tandoori chicken was a bit dry, but still had a good flavor. Add a sip of my friends mango lassi, a few Indian beers, and we were completely and delightfully stuffed, with plenty to take home for lunch the next day. Even though this place has been around for awhile, it still appears clean, and the same set up from what I remember. The gal taking care of our drinks was friendly and smiling, but the guy, well... he seems super traditional, and not very outgoing, but I think he adds to the overall experience, and don't let it throw you off. I just wish we lived a bit closer so we could visit more often.

Generally there are one of two brothers up front running the register. One is very stoic and slow moving but the other one is quick and a little more outwardly friendly.
