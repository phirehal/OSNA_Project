You can only get it in a bowl and if you eat more than half you might not have room for pizza...Hummus - fantastic, great clean and simple flavor.

They have a wide variety of drinks to choose from and the staff is helpful."], ["Lisa S.", "Delicious pizza and an amazing beer selection. Try the red skin potato pizza. I know it sounds strange, but thin slices of potato with cheese, lots of fresh bacon and a sour cream drizzle makes this taste like a loaded baked potato on pizza. Very yummy. Another favorite is the white pizza supreme. Better than a regular white pizza this one features fresh and sun dried tomatoes and grilled onions. If you like a more traditional pizza, all the regular toppings are excellent as well. This is one of my favorite pizza crusts around. So why not five stars? Simply because it is pricier than most pizza places I frequent. Definitely worth the price for the quality, so this is a 4+ review."], ["Walter C.", "Always impressed with Mellow's quality, and service. The manager on duty checked on our party of five at least 3 times during the course of our visit. The waitress was helpful and informative, and suggested appetizers, salads, and desserts.

Saw the yelp rating and stopped in. a lot of young adults (college kids?) Hanging out having a beer. Kinda reminds me of a bar in a college town. Music can be a little too loud. Outdoor seating can drown out the loud music a bit. Meatball trio was good!!! Worth ordering. And the pizza... Pretty thin (not totally thin) and the crust is crunchy and chewy! Yum! Flavor is fresh, not greased down. Our 14 inch is $20. There are slices available during certain time of the day (I assume during late night happy hour). Worth stopping by.

Then, we were seated in a side room, we were the only people in the room for quite a bit but by the time we were leaving it was full. The waitress, Amanda, was very kind and did a great job. The manager also came around and introduced himself. I had the sushi grade sesame tuna which was great, but my boyfriends filet with truffle butter was perfection! Maybe we ordered too much as we shared lobster bisque(delicious) as an appetizer but also ordered the side of fries with truffle butter and corn with bacon. WAY too much food and most of it was boxed up and taken home but that just means more for later!

It isn't a place I would otherwise consider dining at, based on various reasons- one of which being the pretentious vibe and grossly overpriced chain food (under same ownership as Red Lobster FYI). That being said, I was hesitant but open minded. Our server was okay but again, pretentious vibe and I can't stand that. Anyway, we started with calamari and it was great and had a tasty crispy batter but dont expect marinara sauce, as this restaurant is too fancy to offer such a thing. My boss ordered a steak MR and it came out MW. It was painfully awkward to watch him wait for our server to come by and check on our entrees so he could inform her, yet she never checked on us. My boss explained the issue when she finally showed, after we all finished our meals. For a so-called 5 star restaurant, I was a bit surprised at that mistake. Fortunately my entree, scallops with mushroom risotto, was delicious and the sauce was light and flavorful. I would have liked more scallops (only came with 3) especially for the price.

Our choices were \u00a0naturally moving with menu of steak and we capitalized upon the experience by sharing plates to collectively gather the same experience. The menu was was easy to read and it demonstrated a huge wine list, which we indulged with a very good bottle of Pinot Noir that tasted like a superb selection with roots in Oregon. Dinner flowed in steps as we were cautious to enjoy the moments and the lightly marinated steaks and stunning desserts from start to finish with little details, such as the atmosphere and the side dishes, being well taken care of. We felt very comfortable with the experience and we attributed our splendid time to not only the place, but to Scott and Chef Kasey who made the most of it for us, as I am certain they will for others on a nightly basis.Departing into the mist of the later evening from The Capital Grill, I knew another spirit \u00a0had been welcomed by the others to haunt me in a smoldering tribute to my favorite style of fine dining."], ["Chris P.", "Always my favorite. \u00a0Always \u00a0Everything is excellent at every one I've been to. \u00a0Jax's rocks too"], ["Sheri T.", "Excellent place to celebrate your anniversary if you want the best service in town ask for AmandaThe food was wonderful the service was better and I can't wait to go back"], ["Gizelle A.", "But of course...they can't be rated anything below 5 stars!

We were greeted warmly upon entering by the hostess but we weren't impressed by our server who, although helpful, showed little personality or excitement about the food or our dining there. The meal started off great with the homemade focaccia bread and the olive loaf. Both were delicious. The chef prepared a non-dairy preparation of the escargo with prosciutto, which was fabulous! The veal and short rib meatball was good, but not spectacular and the scallop, which was baked in a puff pastry with pate was very unique in its preparation and even better on the palate. I had the pork chop with a bacon jelly on top which was tender and juicy to the bone. The brussel sprouts were lightly fried and the kale with onions was cooked well but the truffle fries were the worst of the sides that we tried.But, forget the fries, the real issue was that it took about 45 minutes for our main courses to arrive after we'd finished our appetizers. The chef came to the table to apologize, which was a nice gesture and she offered desserts on the house. The waiter then came out to bring a round of celebratory drink and strawberry sorbet for us and he tipped the tray and spilled the beverages all over the table and onto our clothes and purses.

I would send them a message through their facebook page, but my message months ago never received a reply. \u00a0I can no longer recommend Matthews due to poor service, food and management.OLD REVIEW: I have to say that the food was absolutely 5 star, but there were some things lacking based on the targeted demographic. \u00a0First, it was absolutely frigid in the restaurant during our visit. \u00a0With entrees in excess of $50, I expect to sit in comfort while dining. \u00a0Second, the attentiveness of the service was spotty. \u00a0Our server was very professional, and appropriately friendly, but we had already eaten our appetizer before being offered a beverage, and a request for another piece of bread was forgotten and then still not offered to any other guests when finally brought to the table. \u00a0Still, the food was absolutely stellar, but we will not return when the temperature outside is cool and will request an attentive server (which is not an appropriate thing to have to ask at a fine dining restaurant).UPDATE: \u00a0We have been an additional 2 times since the first review. \u00a0They are very consistent in my assessment that the kitchen needs to taste food for seasoning prior to sending it out to customers. \u00a0We now know to ask for salt, but some dishes are literally perfect, whereas others are simply sans salt from the kitchen. \u00a0Of course, salt is critical to bringing out the flavors in most foods...so you be the judge.I'm also happy to report that the service was better on our 2nd and 3rd visit. \u00a0Ironically we have been seated at the same exact table on all of our visits, regardless of our request for a booth, and the temperature has been an issue during all visits.Another thing that stood out is that on both our most recent visits, the servers had to read the chef's tasting menu off from a cheat sheet. \u00a0This is a 4 Diamond restaurant, and reading specials off from a cheat sheet is something I don't expect to see.Finally, another thing I think shows a lack of care at this grade of restaurant, or any restaurant for that matter, is when they are out of menu items. \u00a0They were out of 2 menu items when we went the last time, and normally at this type of restaurant the menus for the small dining room would simply be reprinted to exclude the missing items so as not to disappoint customers.We have tried visiting this place on the spur of the moment, but beware that they are often closed for special events and they do not seem to update their hours with anyone, including their own facebook page."], ["Lizzy C.", "My husband & I chose Matthews for our annual Christmas date, as we were planning on seeing a play in nearby San Marco square after dinner/drinks.

Immediately, we knew this place was classy.We decided to sit at the bar & take part in happy hour, which is 5-7pm daily, with $5 select wines & $7 martinis. I chose the petit syrah (which was poured very generously), while my husband chose Duke Brown Ale, a Jacksonville home-brew. For food, we started with the cheese plate. Not really sure exactly the types of cheese on the plate but it seemed like a gorgonzola, brie, sharp cheddar & brie. This platter was a piece of art & came with crostini, candied nuts, a date, some grapes. \u00a0Following the cheese plate, we chose seared beef tips over country grits & buffalo calamari with blue cheese dipping sauce. The beef tips were cooked to a perfect medium & were so juicy. The calamari was spicy, but not over powering. My husband says \"this is the best calamari I've ever had\". Appetizers were priced reasonably ($6-$10) & the service was outstanding. Would definitely return.

Probably the best food we've ever had at a restaurant. The use of herbs and spices was elegant - powerful flavors laced delicately but not subtly with the main ingredients gave a learning experience as well as an incredibly delicious meal. We were overwhelmed with service, not only waited on by two people hand and foot, but informed by them at our every whim, answering our questions about the recipes as well as about the fresh ingredients. We ordered two salads, both wonderful, but the one made of fennel root at a major ingredient was not even close to anything we've ever had.

Originally, the plan was to eat at Chart House, but when the night arrived, we wanted to try something new. We're just spontaneous that way :)As we drove down Hendricks Avenue discussing our options, I spotted Matthew's and remembered all the rave reviews I'd heard about the famous chef, Matthew Medure. We walked inside and were immediately greeted warmly by the hostess and the beautifully refined decor. Nothing too crazy, just soft lighting and creamy neutral colors that set a tone of relaxed, tasteful ambiance. We encountered zero snobbery about our lack of reservation and, after telling the hostess that it was a special occasion, we were treated as if the staff had been planning our anniversary dinner for weeks. Every staff member exemplified the fine-dining experience. One server even apologized for walking in front of me on my path back to the table after a bathroom visit! Before we ordered our food, our server presented us with complimentary glasses of champagne, and explained the menu in detail, including the tasting options. She was funny, gracious and very knowledgeable. We decided against the Chef's tasting menu, but I would like to try it in the future. We started our meal with the Escargot in a cream sauce that was warm, comforting and completely satisfying. I chose the Scallops, cooked medium, for my entree and they were rich and flavorful, while still maintaing the light and fresh quality I crave in seafood. My date ordered a steak, which I also tried, and we both agreed it was cooked very well. Dessert, as usual, was the most memorable part of the meal. Our server brought our chocolate souffle out piping hot with \"Happy Anniversary\" written on our plate in chocolate. She offered to take our photo which we loved. The souffle was decadent and bittersweet, exactly how I like my chocolate.As we were finishing up, we were given a card, signed by the front and back of the house staff, congratulating us on the occasion and thanking us for choosing to spend our evening at Matthew's. A very nice finishing touch to a lovely evening! I highly recommend Matthew's for any fine dining occasion.

We were in a group of nine with only two drinks a piece in three agonizing hours. Next the server forgot some of the apps and drinks. Bar drinks took at least 30 min to get not allowing us to have a few. over a hour and a half goes by, by the time everyone's dinner finally comes out. Three out of five beef tenderloins were ordered med rare and came out well done. They had to be remade which took another 25 min. At the end of the meal the server asked \"who is paying\" and was told it was separate checks. He got an instant attitude and said \"well that will take a long time.\" 30 min later we got out checks that were all wrong. The server was so rude and for such a \"fine dining establishment\" we should not have dealt with such an attitude. He said it was our fault for not stating in the beginning we needed separate checks. We will not be going back and are so disappointed with the managers lack of interest. What was supposed to be a nice night out turned into attitudes and overcooked food.

We were able to be seated by virtue of a no show but i'd recommend reso's be the norm. We were very happy to learn that Matthew Medure has placed a Chef d'Cuisine permanently in the kitchen here. Unfortunately his name escapes me. This makes a huge difference in the kitchen, and not just in the prep and cooking but in plating and having an executive host to work with guests on their special needs. It just takes everything up a notch to have that \"chef/owner house feel\" back at Matthews. The result was a three course meal without a hitch and without a miss in delivery and taste. A special moment occurred when the Chef d'Cuisine was able to partner with my wife on her meal because she is a vegan. After a brief conference, her dinner was quickly addressed in a quality way and rather than steamed veggies it was both elegant and finely done. Equally important, big change at Matthews is the menu has been updated and changed. Also, the restaurant now promotes family style dining where they deliver somewhat larger amounts of the selected dish in a portion amount correct for the table size so that all \u00a0might be able to have some if they want to try it. Or if perhaps someone might want another portion because it was so good one couldn't resist. This has been a theme at other famous New York (and Los Angeles) restaurants like Tom Calicchio's Craft, has been a well received theme and makes the formal dining experience somewhat less imposing and fun. The combination of Chef d'Cuisine on site on an every night basis, the new menu and related changes of recipe and new offerings, and the family style but still fine dining experience make this the new hotty restaurant in Jacksonville."], ["Katherine P.", "Great fine dinning in Jax, especially if youre a food lover & a critic just like my hubby.

I can't recall what we had for entrees (it's been over 6 months since we went - we have since left Florida) but whatever it was I know we both had to contain our grunts of approval. I DO remember the dessert (because isn't that always the favorite part of the meal, anyway?). We ordered the chocolate souffl\u00e9 with creme Anglaise - DIVINE. I'm not even a huge fan of chocolate but after everything else we had tried I knew we could not leave that place without trying dessert and this was a chef's recommendation. It did NOT disappoint!

The gracious hostess offered me a selection of magazines to read but there is no need, especially when one can read the wine list and learn quite a bit. I also observed how many other guests in the restaurant were simply having a wonderful time in an atmosphere that is neither too dimly lit nor overbearing.

We will definitely return whenever we are in Jacksonville.Expensive and well worth every penny."], ["Natalie B.", "The food was beautifully prepared, seasonally appropriate and sinfully delicious! They procure a lot of their produce locally from Twinn Bridges. You can either select a tasting menu or a la carte.

I never tasted the promised cracked pepper and the anglaise was flavorless and watery. \u00a0Nicely presented, not worth eating. The restaurant is beautifully lit, elegant and understated. \u00a0The bar is a great date night spot, with a whimsical cocktail menu and reasonably priced tapas. \u00a0The booths are low, I felt I needed a booster seat! \u00a0On final review, the dinner was strong until dessert. \u00a0The service was mostly attentive and on task, but please refrain from voicing your perception about my dining habits unless I'm eating with my feet, and ask me how I would like my meal paced if you have concerns, don't assume. \u00a0I love fine dining, the week before I was at Chez Panisse, the week before that Absinthe, I like my food and will pay a lot for good food and service. \u00a0I would return to Matthew's if I were in Jacksonville again, but I wouldn't have five star expectations."], ["Leigh D.", "Literally, without exaggeration, the best food I have ever tasted. Service was impeccable!"]], "Restaurant Medure": [], "Bistro Aix": [["Paula S.", "Thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance, and the food. Started off with sharing escargot. Thought escargot was tender and not overwhelming with garlic. Menu had so many delicious items to choose from yet I had seem a pic of their Cesar salad and had to try it. Also had cup of their French onion soup. Both were wonderful but I will definitely get a bowl next time..... So good. My boyfriend had their rib eye steak cooked medium rare. The staff was very helpful and attentive. Definitely will return"], ["Tajira M.", "I'm not sure what I was expecting when I walked into the restaurant, but I felt slightly confused by the decor. Maybe because most \"bistros\" I've been to lately are either a little more modern or a lot more intimate, but something about the decor felt a combination of dated and somewhat muddled. The chairs made me feel like the knights of the round table were joining us for dinner, the bar had animal print stools, the lighting above the tables were like multi-colored disco balls minus the sparkle. It's just a strange combination, and on first glance, it made me wonder what the food would be like. But-for the good reviews, I probably would have been worried. \u00a0My advice: ignore the decor-- the food was great. I sat at the bar, and first I tried the Pinot Blanc, one of their featured wines. Smooth and light with crispy citrus notes toward the end. I'd picked the restaurant feeling like having moules frites, and was pleasantly surprised to see that escargot was on the menu. Why not?The escargot came out first with crusty bread. Seven tender snails in a light garlic cream sauce, topped with a crust of Parmesan cheese and fresh parsley. Seeing other photos, I was worried the dish would be too heavy or overly salted, but it was delicious. The cream sauce made it different from the typical butter and herbs, and it paired well with the wine. Both the bartender and the hostess (I'm assuming she was actually the manager/owner) were very attentive.The mussels and fries came out much larger than expected, which was a pleasant surprise. An inexpensive meal, I want to say they were $19 and the escargot was $9. The fries were crisp and had a nice time and salt flavor. The mussels had a great broth of white wine, shallot, thyme and garlic, with enough broth left in the bowl to sop up with bread or the fries. Lovely. I wasn't certain I would enjoy the meal, but I'm happy I gave it a chance. By the time I left, the restaurant was bustling. I did wish there was a tv to catch the end of the basketball game, but the bartender kept us updated with the scores. See pics."], ["Namir S.", "Have been back several times. I like the drinks and wine selection. I like the atmosphere and will return, but I can't say it's due to the food. Don't get me wrong, it's good, but not great.

All in all, I'm undecided how i feel, but most people will like it."], ["Ekaterina C.", "We have been there twice. The hanger steak had a heavy salty sauce that hurt my stomach for 2 days and her veal in bone marrow was very salty. We did not have a great experience but the service was excellent. Our second return per the manager was much better. Peter our server was superb! The avocado tuna app was excellent! The bread is great as well. There were some flies buzzing around they need to take care of that! My shrimp tagliatelle was excellent and I don't ever remember a better Marinara sauce tasting so good. Deep flavor. Her filet mignon was too thin with very little flavor. Very small portion. The chocolate mousse was to die for in Jax! Overall experience was good the second time but still not worth the money.

The restaurant was a little on the noisy side but aside from that very pleasant. Staryed with the escargot and blue cheese chips. The escargot were fantastic. The blue cheese chips were very good the cheese was very fresh and the cream sauce was well balanced. The house made chips were cooked perfectly. I will say the gorgonzola chips at the bling rabbit were probably a touch better.For our entr\u00e9e we got the grilled tuna and the fillet mignon. \u00a0Both were superb you could cut the steak with a butter knife (and I did at first due to a lack of steak knife lol). The fillet was cooked perfect to my liking. The au gratin that accompanied it was holy sh** good you must try it. The wifes tuna was amazingly flavored and cooked perfectly as well.Dessert was a little dissapointing as on their online menu they lust a bananas foster cake which they didnt have. :( \u00a0Instead we got the perfeteroles which were good but not amazing which could have been totally due to the fact I had my heart set on bananas foster. Over all very happy though they have definitely earned my repeat buisness"], ["Jay M.", "The following review was published under my byline in the Florida Times-Union on Thursday, February 20, 2014. This is an original, unabridged version of that review. This is also focused exclusively on the Le Bar section of the restaurant (formerly the Onyx Bar).It's regal yet comfy, sophisticated and silly with spasms of pop art throughout. There's some French and Asian d\u00e9cor cues, too. And a beat that doesn't stop, even when the music makers do.Le Bar is a dressed-up refuge for grown-up fun. The San Marco Boulevard neighbor and blood cousin to Bistro Aix puts on a good show in its style-forward lounge. But when it comes to the kitchen scene, Le Bar also manages to be flavor-forward. Its outstanding menu of small plates and handcrafted cocktails stands on its own, with items originating from its own kitchen and bar.If you're looking for full-service formality, look next door to the Bistro; Le Bar plates are for sharing. The French culinary influence is loud in clear in here--the proprietors call it \"French soul food\"--with a mature fromagerie and charcuterie board (four selections each) designed for mixing and matching. Begin your stay with a selection of three ($21) or five ($35).My lounging partner and I came for the small plates, any one of which will satisfy a light appetite as a main dish. They come to you in a variety of thoughtful French period china patterns.We began with the Sesame Tuna Tartare ($9), a collection of ahi-grade, tangy tuna bites in seasoned greens that melt in your mouth, providing a nice contrast against the crunch of the accompanying sesame crisps. More mainstream tastes will not be disappointed with the Truffled French Fries ($6), a healthy portion of golden-crisp, thin-cut beauties tossed in truffle oil and topped with shaved Parmesan and sides of ketchup and mayo. They were so good, our server caught us pleading for a second plate. More carnivorous types will devour the Deux Sliders ($8), baby cheddar cheeseburger twins fully dressed with secret sauce that made for a melty (and potentially messy) affair. Make no mistakes, though: the risk is worth the reward. That's a great segue to the Croque Monsieur ($8), otherwise known as not your ordinary ham and cheese. This creamy sandwich is best attacked with fork and knife, to fully enjoy the blend of gruy\u00e8re, provolone, Parmesan and heavy cream spilling over the edge.While you won't find sweet treats on Le Bar's abbreviated menu, our server regaled us with tales of cr\u00e8me brulee, flourless chocolate torte, lemon cookies and Belgian cake. We pursued the latter, a volcano-like creation crafted of almond flour and dark chocolate, spewing sky-high a scoop of vanilla Working Cow ice cream with plentiful syrupy chocolate flows. It's ample for two or more to spar over with spoons.Those nostalgic for the gleaming Onyx bar, the namesake for this space the six years prior, will find it perfectly preserved in its new incarnation. These days it's churning out classic and sparkling handcrafted cocktails, before- and after-dinner drinks and local (Intuition Ale Works' I-10 IPA) and imported beers. Patrons also have access to the extensive and impressive Bistro Aix wine list.Le Bar is the place you go to impress a date or a client, celebrate the end of the working day or even larger affairs, with accommodations for up to 150. Or if you love the beat, you'll find live music three nights a week with DJs filling the rest.More than that, Le Bar is a see-and-be-seen lounge with food that likewise craves to be seen and savored. It's hip, glam, cozy and fun.Le Bar1440 San Marco Blvd., San Marco (adjacent to Bistro Aix)(904) 398-1949bistrox.comType of cuisine:Hours: Tuesday - Saturday, 5 p.m. to midnight; closed Sunday and MondayCredit cards: All major acceptedBar service: Full barChildren's menu: NoCatering: YesReservations accepted: Large parties onlyPrice range: Overall, moderate"], ["Johnelyn C.", "My boyfriend and I had dinner here for my birthday.

Tells me he understands because his wife has celiac. He offers nothing for our troubles. Then we wait for 20 min for refills for drinks. The wait between everything was so long and rediculous. The silverware- cups, and plates all smelled like dirty dog too. No one refilled our water. The valet was the friendliest in the entire place.

The darkness that prevailed in the cafe made it hard to read the menu, but our server was very good at informing us what was making the menu special that evening. In choosing the huge steak for two, we asked for a careful medium so as to take advantage of the true flavor while retaining the cooked element. With the passing of the tiny revolver plate escargot and the supporting salads, the moment came to us on this spectacular display of big oak board and this monster cut of beef was nestled on a bed of vegetables....As a former culinary/management student, I can appreciate the European style applications of high pan-seared heat with seasoned oils or the finesse of Southern barbecue \u00a0and grill methods...but the monster beef (that looked so inviting) had darker thoughts on the inside than my glass of Syrah....Oops!The return trip to the kitchen was done by our server, who then did the gracious offerings of free glasses of wine while we waited for better results. The manager on board came to us and apologized too. That was good to see.With the 2nd arrival of the monster beef, we noted it looked different, so we were on it without a second thought. Then we noted with the first slices that our plate for 2 had become a plate for 1.5 and that sections were missing...rather than going through the issue again, we used our forks to decide. Yes, it was a different beast and the taste abounded.Forgoing the coffee and desserts with thoughts of going to Aardwolf not far away, I recollected my previous experiences with kitchen mishaps...It seems to me that the usage of a temperature gauge is sometimes a missing tool of the trade here in Jacksonville, FL. Whether the chefs are deluded by their years of experience to simply \"eyeball it\" or the tool is possibly not being used, cooking times vary from the very best in the city to the basic food truck. I have returned no less than six plates in the past year with a polite message to try again. As we subsided in the wake of the good plates that were removed from our table, I knew that I would return to Bistro Aix to experience some of the other treats listed on the menu."], ["Amber A.", "Great service, food, and atmosphere. \u00a0However, It is disappointing the \u00a0beet salad preparation changed. \u00a0It used to be prepared in a way the tastes were all infused.

We were at a wedding reception so our menu was limited. I tried the steak frites, and the bone-in pork chop. Both were delicious and cooked to perfection.

Overall a good place."], ["Craig E.", "After 7 or so years of eating at this place, its time to add my review -:) \u00a0Bistro Aix delivers well-prepared, high quality, and sometimes imaginative food. \u00a0I have visited for lunch and dinner, have never had a \"bad\" experience, but I am put off by the noise and the parade of people who go there to be seen. \u00a0That probably has to do with the bar business, which attracts a certain clientele. Most recently, I had a business lunch with 3 other folks on a weekday, and ordered one of the specials - a pesto pasta with prosciutto. \u00a0It sounded like a great combination, and the pesto was nicely done. \u00a0However, the prosciutto was delivered in \"chunks\" of varying size and thickness and was chewy due to the cooking method. \u00a0So, an imaginative take on pesto that didn't quite live up to expectations due to poor execution. \u00a0One of my companions ordered the same dish, and I observed him leaving the prosciutto on the plate - in fact he wasn't particularly pleased with the dish and didn't finish it. That was the first time I've had anything at Bistro Aix that wasn't \u00a0up to the standard I would expect.Overall, the dinners at this restaurant have been very good and the lunches have been kind of \u00a0underwhelming - nothing special. \u00a0I gave it 4 stars - not because I'm a huge fan - but because the overall level of quality and service deserve that rating."], ["Ryan H.", "Pricey, but ohhhhhhhh so good.

So we ordered drinks and started looking around noticing how there was a nice blend of older/younger, male/female patrons when all of a sudden, the band was getting started. We saw them as we were coming in but we didn't think that the music would be as loud as it was in the small room. The music was good but we had to yell at each other to be heard. It would've been much worse if the music was bad. Not wanting to get sore throats or blown ear drums we paid and quickly left.

They are quite proud of their food but it holds up to the billing. Again I sat at the bar so I could watch the kitchen in action. On this trip I ordered the sheepshead with bussel sprouts and an app of tuna tartar. The tuna was cut brilliantly and the whole dish had a nice spice. The red onions really worked on this dish. The entr\u00e9e of sheepshead was nicely cooked by the lone woman in the kitchen Sarah. She did the fish real justice. The way she worked that station was a joy to my eyes.

Desserts can be gotten to go from a mini pastry window. Full bar for when you get stood up. Portions are medium.

The tomato bisque and Caesar salad is my favorite lunch option. The bartenders are always busy during happy hour, so don't expect great service from them.

The lettuce is cut so that you can essentially make a small lettuce wrap with the chicken salad. If you have gone to Cozy Tea and had their Curry Chicken Salad, it is very close to Magnificat's. Each place makes it just a tad different. \u00a0 Normally, I get my food to go, but Magnificat has a fantastic location on Laura Street with the greatest covered patio. It's perfect on spring or fall days with a nice breeze. It is also a great place to people watch during Art Walk. This French cafe's typical hours are during the Downtown lunch rush. Don't go Downtown on a night other than Art Walk and expect it to be open."], ["Marty T.", "I have to give this place only two stars because, those of you that know me, know that if a restaurant advertises a (self-proclaimed) \"best in the city\" dish, they had better blow me away with their claim...So, being new to downtown Jax, I am still in search of a great burger, downtown. \u00a0When I found this place online and read that they claim to have the \"best burger in Jacksonville\", obviously I was excited to try one. \u00a0They also had some other interesting sandwiches on the menu too so my girlfriend would have something new to choose from as well.I looked at the menu and read \"half pound certified angus\" so I called to order and after ordering the burger, I was not asked how I wanted it cooked. \u00a0So, I asked were the burgers cooked to order or how are they prepared? \u00a0The response was (and this was my first red flag) \"well by law, we are only allowed to cook it no less than medium\". \u00a0Well suffice to say, being a certified food manager, I know the law and if you are advertising certified angus, you should be able to serve it rare if that is how the customer wants it.So, those of you that like quality beef, that is the little secret to knowing if a restaurant buys quality beef. \u00a0If the quality is not high enough, that \"law\" she recited is actually true. \u00a0Not if you are claiming certified angus should this be the case.But, I ordered it anyway and thought I'd give it a shot. \u00a0Well as soon as I got it home and popped the top on the styro, I immediately thought \"yeah, this definitely doesn't look anything like some of the \"best\" burgers I've had. :(The patty was flat (not half-pound looking) and charred black, the bacon was low-quality and greasy, the best part about it was the foccacia bun. \u00a0After taking the first bite, I found the patty to be completely dry and well-done.I'm sorry but this is the largest city in the US and we're talking about one of the most popular foods known to Americans...

Now I stopped in and to my surprise this place wasn't very crowded beening the middle of lunch time. This place is old and the decor shows it but it is clean. Looking at the menu I decided on the quiche but they were out so I settled for a soup an sandwich. I ordered the top round beef on rye and the carrot and ginger soup. Never thinking of or imaging carrots and ginger together it was pretty good. It was very smooth and to me could have used alittle more spice. The sandwich was abundant meat and tasty to but the cumin mayo really didn't do much for me. It was an odd taste to a typically normal sandwich.

It's just a shame they aren't open for dinner [as it is for most of Downtown Jacksonville dining].Magnificat Cafe is a remarkably good choice of dining during the lunchtime hours, Mondays through Fridays. If you are lucky enough to work in the area, you need to be eating here at least once a month, if not more. It's unique, its authentic, still feels home cooked and comfortable... tres magnifique! Top choices:The Baked Brie lunch. You get a small wheel of brie [not too small], a toasted baguette, toasted almonds, and a side. I often opt for a side of the French Onion soup, but there are other delicious options, as well [potato salad, pasta salad, chips]. This feels very European to me... eating a loaf of tasty fresh bread and delicious cheese? Yes. And to also feel like I am European, or in Europe on vacation at the very least? That's the best of all.The salads are great, fresh, and good portions. The Goat Cheese Caeser Salad is delicious, with goat cheese patties, romaine lettuce, toasted walnuts, tomatoes, croutons and Caeser dressing. The sandwiches are pretty unique, while still remaining in the comfort zone, offering anything from Roast Beef and Boursin to a Pate Sandwich served with grain mustard and tomato on a baguette to a Crudite Sandwich served with boiled egg and pesto mayonaise on a baguette.You can't go wrong with the Magnificat. The only problem this place gives you is trying to decide what to order."], ["Joshua O.", "My wife and I were passing by and I chose this cafe based on the eclectic menu choices. The detailed descriptions where mouthwatering. I was a bit disappointed overall. I had a roast beef with Boursin cheese sand which on rye, which came with a homemade garlic mayo spread, the beef was fatty, and overpowered any other flavor to be enjoyed. The ingredients seemed fresh but the sand which tasted only of the fatty beef. I had a homemade pasta salad as my side, which was oil based and with poppy seeds, and was rather delicious. My wife opted for the crab cake melt, as per the recommendation of the counter clerk. It was wretched, even though it was smothered in cheese tucked in a pita, it smelled violently like bad fish. My wife still committed, took a bite and it tasted even worse. I can no longer eat shellfish but never have I smelled \"fishy\" crab cakes. If we had not been on a schedule I would have insisted on another sandwich for her. She did enjoy her ceased salad and the dressing looked homemade and was tasty. There were some positives but overall the experience wasn't worth our time, or money. The cafe itself is quaint and tidy, had soothing tunes playing that inspired a pleasant mood. We ate inside which we thought was going to be cooler, however it wasn't. We may try again but in no rush."], ["Sean C.", "I've past this place a million times and always wondered what it was since it was always closed.

The prices are good (all your typical lunch stuff is under 10 dollars) and the food is great. There is usually little to no line so you'll get your food pretty quick too. So far I have tried the quiche Lorraine and the Ham and Goat Cheese Melt. Both of these were super good.

It was Labor Day Sunday and everyone was off and the priest was avail to do the baptism. Trouble was finding a place on such short notice to accommodate 25 of us. Half the family was drivinging from the Southside to the Westside for the baptism. We decided on downtown,San Marco,Riverside or Avondale \u00a0to go after to eat. Trouble was finding a place. I emailed Uptown Kitchen and Bar and received a response quickly. The manager Chris said Sundays brunch are their busiest times but they would hold seats for us when it was our time. I suggested 12:30. I know primetime for any place. We are majority Filipino so of course we run on Filipino time. I told everyone that we must leave at 12. Chris said they would hold the seats but if we came late they would try there best to keep them. We got there on time and everyone got sat right away in our party. I have not been here to eat in years like 6 years. This place got a make over. It looks great. They have a bar now with a chalkboard wall. I love that no matter how trendy it is. We had the best servers. Shirley and Marleene. Super super sweet and attentive. Our orders got put in quickly. Our food came out fast and everyone was happy. I asked my family how the food was and not one bad thing was said. Everyone truly enjoyed their food. I had about 5 mimosas and it was refreshing and tasty. Majority of my family got the steak and eggs and they went on about how good it was. I so appreciate how they were able to accommodate my family for my son's baptism brunch on short short notice. Every other place I called just could not accommodate us. I get it I was expecting it. Yet Uptown went above and beyond and I am so grateful for it.

My most recent meal was a pimento cheese stuffed omelet with spinach, a side of gouda cheese grits and sourdough toast. I am not a fan of pimento cheese, but we were sitting at the bar watching it being made so I asked to try it. It was so creamy and yummy! The waitress said I could get it in my omelette so I did. I get the gouda cheese grits every time I go: they are that good. I've never met an avocado I didn't love and the avocado olive oil toast topped with egg and tomatoes is the bomb. Simple combination, but oh so good. The kitchen is open so I see the food being prepared and delivered when I sit at the bar.

Uptown is much more than it's original incarnation. \u00a0 The breakfast menu has expanded. My farmer's biscuit with fried green tomato, spinach and cheese was a vegetarian dream. The tang of the tomato was enhanced by the flaky buttered and grilled biscuit, the spinach was a glazed bright green cooked just enough to retain all those healthy vitamins without being raw. Although Uptown has changed drastically, they were still happy to dish up an old favorite that wasn't in the new menu for my daughter. Bacon, egg and cheese on ciabiatta bread with a crispy side of hash browns. It's the personal touch that always keeps us coming back. And the food--the food is the major reason we are repeat customers.If you haven't been to Uptown within the last two weeks, come on down and see for yourself what's up in Historic Springfield."], ["Jay M.", "The following review was published under my byline in the Florida Times-Union on Saturday, June 13, 2015. This is an original, unabridged version of that review.If you are a visitor to Springfield, the name Uptown Market might lead you to thoughts of an urban bazaar. Perhaps a farmer's market. Certainly not a spot for sophisticated, sit-down style foods.In March, the owners of the well-known breakfast-and-lunch destination finally set the record straight. Uptown not only got a name change, but an upgrade to dinner six nights a week, along with full-bar service.These days, Uptown Kitchen & Bar keeps the lights on late--until 11 p.m. three nights a week--with nine dinner plates ($12-22) and a well-manicured rundown of happy hour specials. The former deli counter has been repurposed as an urban-chic bar flanked by track lighting, flat-screens and a lineup of bottles that means business.The theme of Uptown's kitchen creations is classic Americana with some enticing streaks of fusion. While Southern influences figure prominently, as well as vegan and vegetarian plates, flavors are generally all over the map.We dived in to the Starters & Bar Snacks menu, for which some selections earn a small discount weekdays from 3 to 7 p.m. With the Fried Green Tomatoes ($5), you get four thick-cut, flavorful discs with a light breading and a tangy side of comeback sauce. While our server swore secrecy about its ingredients, a mild horseradish note was apparent yet not overbearing.The Pork Belly and Pickles ($6) gives you a square slab of barbecue-braised (of spoon-splicing quality) pork belly atop smoke Gouda cheese grits, flanked by a handful of old-world deli dill pickles. While you have a single belly to fight over, the creamy, buttery Gouda grits are the stars of this plate. On first blush, my friend called them mashed potatoes. Where I come from, that's solid compliment territory.We rolled on to entrees. I took a chance on the Veal Ricotta Meatballs ($15), which mercifully got tangled up with some delightfully dense bucatini pasta--spaghetti noodles on steroids--and zesty arrabbiata sauce. The pasta base was a great foil for the mild-mannered meatballs on top.My friend called up the Turkey Burger ($9), an expertly grilled, excellent red meat alternative with provolone, avocado and all the fixings. What makes this plate great is the fact you can upgrade your side for $3, from fries to Uptown's bubbling, gooey mac and cheese (available a la carte, $6). Make no mistake: unless you're a chronic calorie counter, you'll want to do this.Uptown won't wow you with visions of sugar-coated delights in a display case. Baker Ted whips up a limited menu of sweets that you'll find on the chalkboard against the far wall. In my world, there is not much better than a warm brownie paired with vanilla ice cream. Uptown's version ($3.50) is a humble horizontal arrangement, just sweet enough for one. My friend's Pecan Pie \u00e0 la Mode ($5.95) was a rocky nut- and sugar-studded wedge of decadence that the sweet tooth-afflicted should not miss.Uptown's standard happy hour brings weekday specials from 3 to 7 p.m., including dollar-off draft and canned beers and wine, $4 well and $5 call liquor. Candoo Tuesdays roll from 7 to close with $2 domestic canned beer and $3 imports and crafts. WineDown Wednesdays keep the same timeline and bring $4 house red and white glasses.Since Uptown cut its teeth on early-day dining, the lunch scene here is mature. You'll find a variety of burgers, sandwiches, and salads. Five lunch specials (typically $11-13) change daily, and each weekday claims its own recurring lunch special, such as Taco Tuesday and Jamaican Jerk Chicken Wednesday.Uptown serves up a diverse menu of standards with flashes of flair that will please a variety of tastes at a reasonable budget. That's not a tall order for this very capable kitchen.Uptown Kitchen & Bar1303 North Main Street, Springfield(904) 355-0734UptownMarketJax.comType of cuisine: Modern American FusionHours of operation: Monday - Wednesday, 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.; Thursday and Friday, 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.; Saturday, 8 a.m. to 11 p.m.; Sunday, 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.Credit cards: All major acceptedBar service: Full barChildren's menu: YesReservations accepted: NoCatering: YesPrice range: Starters and bar snacks, $5-10; salads, burgers and sandwiches, $6-14; dinner plates, $12-22"], ["Brian S.", "This is a great spot! \u00a0I have a good friend who just bought a house nearby, so we walked over for a late dinner, then I came back the next day for lunch. \u00a0Good decision both times.The food (steak frites, then the Cuban) were both delicious. \u00a0The service was top notch, and the wine list (while mostly low price options) contained a couple of winners that were budget friendly.I will be back whenever I am nearby, and you should do the same!"], ["Amy S.", "We don't get to this part of Jacksonville very often, so to come here is out of the way. \u00a0If I'm going to go out of my way to eat somewhere, then it better be darn good and Uptown Market just doesn't do the trick for me.The atmosphere and feel of the place is really nice. \u00a0It's open and laid-back. \u00a0Very comfortable. \u00a0The cronuts are down-right awesome. \u00a0Although, at $5 each (not including tax), they just aren't worth it to me. \u00a0They now sell cronuts at Epcot at WDW and with tax they are just under $5. \u00a0A cronut that's more expensive than the ones at WDW?!?! \u00a0Yea... that just doesn't add up in my mind. \u00a0I expect to be price-gouged at \"The Happiest Place on Earth.\" \u00a0I definitely do not expect it at a local downtown market & deli.The biscuits with sausage gravy were the worst I've ever had. \u00a0They sausage gravy was perfectly bland. \u00a0Absolutely no flavour. \u00a0I was very disappointed because I had heard good things about all their breakfast items. \u00a0it's a sad day when the sausage gravy on the buffet at the nearest Golden Corral is better. \u00a0Service was also \"meh.\" \u00a0She was nice, but we rarely saw her. \u00a0Never did get a refill on my drink. \u00a0I hear there are other great things on the menu, but after this poor visit, it's safe to say I will not be returning."], ["Maya C.", "I hadn't been back here since the name and menu change and since my last review was not all that good, I wanted to go back especially since my fellow Yelpers told me that it is much better now.It was late when we got out of a Friday night's Suns game and my mother and I were hungry. I suggested we go here since they were still open and convinced Mom that it'll be good. We drove up Main St. and I found the place easily again. Didn't look too busy as I could see that a few tables were occupied but the bar area was full. We parked along the street and walked in. Kristian (I believe?) greeted us warmly and told use we could sit anywhere and came over with menus. Looking over it, some items stayed the same while others were gone. The first thing that caught my eye was the Deviled Eggs and Ham. I love deviled eggs and while I went back and forth over ordering them so late I ordered them anyway since I knew my mother would help me eat them. It looked fantastic when it came out. Four deviled eyes with deviled ham in the middle and piled up. One bite and I was impressed. The eggs themselves tasted farm-fresh and the filling was just right. I never had deviled ham before but I likened it to ham put in a food processor with some mayo I think. I ate this with the eggs and closed my eyes. I was really enjoying it. Mom enjoyed just the egg as she doesn't eat ham. For our entrees, She got a turkey burger while I got the Trout a la Plancha, Trout with succotash, carrots, and corn in a cream sauce with fingerling potatoes. OMG! I was in heaven! The veggies and the cream sauce made that dish and paired with the fish made up for the seasonings one would expect. We both decided on dessert so we ate half of our entrees and boxed up the rest. I saw on their chalkboard Blueberry Shortcake and I knew I was getting that immediately. The shortcake was about the size of a jumbo Grands biscuit with homemade-like whipped cream and blueberries in blueberry sauce. Love, love, love this shortcake. I believe that this was the best shortcake I've ever had. My mother got the Lemon Pound Cake and she liked it. I got a taste of it and it was phenomenal. We both ate all of our desserts.

The KFC chicken pot pie is actually more filling than theirs with tender pieces of chicken.There was a bug on my friend's salad and the server was very slow to offer to replace it (she didn't even believe him..). The service and food was lacking for the price point. I feel like I paid just as much as I would at BlackSheep and BlackSheep tastes way better than this place. (Everyone's food was just not good either, except for the fries bc it seems like they just deep fried it out of a bag. We ordered more and they over cooked the second order... how?? Where's quality control for the food?)The service was also very slow, it seems like our server would rather chit chat with other people than serve us. There were 2 other tables and a few at the bar, so I don't see why it took 5 minutes for her to bring us our waters. I can see why it's empty for dinner.

They seem to be trying to be more like other parts of town and it would be nice to see more items that were fresh and catered to the people and lives of those in Springfield. I can eat in Avondale or Riverside or San Marco and I know what to expect. Ordering similar items at Uptown Kitchen and bar, I was disappointed. The food was OK, but the portions were smaller and the presentation was really lacking. Great beer selection, and I know that the new management will turn this around and make it better. The managers have winning solutions in other parts of the city, so I am confident they will turn it around, but they need to make sure that the existing staff take care of the basics. Clean the counters, add some panache to a burger and fries, give me something more than I can get elsewhere in Jacksonville, make this place more memorable. Again, great beer selection and the owners/managers are there to listen to your needs, but I think the new outside managers can add additional ways of looking at solutions to make the place even better.

Nice and casual, and on a good day, I can see how brunch outside can be an awesome time! I hear good things about brunch here, so hope to try it sometime.But tonight, came here for dinner with a group of friends. We met for drinks, then decided to stay for dinner. It didn't take long for us to be seated, so that was great. And our server was great - she answered questions about the menu and was great about keeping us informed on the status of our meals. As far as the food, we ordered the Deviled Eggs and Ham and the Pork Belly and Pickles. I tried some of the Pork Belly, which was tender and juicy. I really loved the Smoked Gouda Grits on the side. For dinner, I ordered the steak frites. Steak was cooked medium well. It was a little on the dry and tough side, however, but was still pretty tasty. The side of fries was pretty plentiful, though part of me wishes the size of the steak was proportioned more to the fries. But all in all, I left feeling full and satisfied! Will definitely stop by again. Try it out, Uptown Kitchen And Bar has something good going on!"], ["Gina R.", "If you haven't been to Uptown since their renovation you are missing out! Even as a Springfield resident I didn't formerly find a lot of reasons to go to Uptown but since their relaunch with full bar I'm there often. It's a great place to stop for drinks and the bartenders are all awesome. The new menu has a lot more good choices too. I could eat the awesome four grilled cheese sandwich every single day. Brunch is always a winner there too. Absolutely fantastic!"], ["Rodney M.", "Not as good for breakfast as it used to be, had the special, 2 dried up Canadian bacon, a bland banger, 2 eggs a tomato wedge cut in half, a couple of mushrooms, a spot of beans. \u00a0I'll stick to my bagel with smoked salmon next time!"]], "Fionn Maccool's": [], "The Blind Rabbit": [["Jenny R.", "I've been here lots of times with friends when we want a good beer and whiskey selection and great bar food. If you want to come here on a weekend, make a reservation. This is a popular spot and you'll have to wait an hour for a table. They have a good variety of craft beers, lots of different whiskeys to choose from and you can even get a flight of whiskeys if you can't make up your mind. With all this alcohol that is offered, there have been a few times I may have had too many but the staff is always so friendly and helpful. Their customer service is great, they're knowledgeable on their menu and are accommodating when they can be. My favorite menu item is their shrimp and grits. I love their peach habanero sauce, it's spicy, so beware if you have a low tolerance for spicy foods. I don't like grits but their goat cheese grits are delicious. My husband loves their burgers. They are pretty delicious and unique. This is the place we go when we want a burger. I've also had their fries, gorgonzola chips and poutine. The fries and poutine were ok, I like my fries to have more potato and their fries are lacking in that department. The gorgonzola chips were surprisingly tasty."], ["Pamela D.", "FINALLY writing my review for one of the best places in Jax to grab a burger! Time and time again I come to Blind Rabbit when I'm in the mood for a speakeasy style drink with a deliciously terrible-for-my-heart burger filled with creativity. Favorites include the Southern and the BBQ burgers. \u00a0All are huge, \u00a0and paired with a root or carbalicious side, you better have a huge appetite or be ready to take something home. Comfort foods mac n cheese, grits and house made chips are consistently excellent and a decent portion. I usually sit at the bar, which is always tended by a wonderful to look at and pleasant person. \u00a0Because of the heaviness of this cuisine, \u00a0I only visit when I'm mentally prepared to have some pretty serious comfort food with no regrets and plenty of time (food takes quite long to come out, \u00a0so enjoy the atmosphere and your stiff drink). They have started doing brunch here; maybe I'll check that out some time to switch things up. We'll see. Either way: Blind Rabbit is on my top burgers of Jax list and is worth its bite."], ["Kyle W.", "Always a great meal, but the experience is so much more than food. Great atmosphere, great people, the whiskey selection is legit. The specials are always so hard to pass up. Their shakes are top notch; thick and packed with flavor. \u00a0 \u00a0They support the local art community; a Shaun Thurston mural adorns the exterior of the building and there is a revolving installation of local art on the interior walls. \u00a0 \u00a0I have been a fan since they were rolling the city in their food truck and I will continue to patronize the place in until they kick me out. \u00a0 \u00a0The world could use more places that make you feel so at home."], ["Joe K.", "Thank you fellow Yelpers. I followed your reviews to the Blind Rabbit and was very pleased with the experience. I had the southern burger with southern potato salad and an I-10 to wash it all down. This is a good amount of food for the price so arrive hungry. This amazing burger was one of the best I've ever had in my life (and I've tried a lot of them). It's adventurous and surprising and a perfection of different flavors. It had a fried green tomato, Creole pimento cheese, peach habanero hot sauce, arugula, georgia cane syrup and pickled okra on a brioche bun. It's amazing. \u00a0The southern potato salad was light and the flavors were creamy and delicious. I can't wait to return to try their other dishes. This is my new favorite place."], ["Hayley B.", "Stopped in today for lunch. Delicious burger! Excellent drink options (beer and cocktails!) and service was good.

The concept of the place is great. The execution was a different story. The place was decently full for Sunday brunch. Our waitress brought waters and took our drink menu. Two of us decided to go for the spiked milkshakes (what a cool idea!), and the third ordered a cocktail. And then...we waited. And waited. My friend's cocktail came out in a glass with lip prints on it and she had to send it back. The milkshakes were still nowhere in sight. Then, 2 came out at once. But not one for each of us...The server explained theyd messed up in the kitchen and 1 of the milkshakes had no alcohol and the other had 2 shots. And it was our mission to figure it out. And left them both on the table. My milkshake...still MIA. In the meantime, our food had come out. My friend wasn't blown away by her waffle. Being a natural born Canadian, I wanted to love the brunch poutine, but it was just okay. Entirely too salty for my liking. My milkshake finally came out and the candied bacon on it was delicious but the rest of it didn't have me dancing in my seat. The other milkshake, which, in all honesty we couldn't figure out which had alcohol and which didn't, was left mostly untouched. The shining star of the meal were the waffle sausages, which I'm sad I didn't order myself!Slow service, mediocre food, disappointing milkshakes.

The food came out all at once, for a party of 6, which is a rare feat these days. Happy hour specials on beer, wine, and well liquor until 7 are a plus. I ordered fried green tomatoes for an app, and the Southern Burger for my entree, including pimento cheese and a fried green tomato. The breading on the tomato was crispy and delicious, adding a nice texture. The burger came out just right temp-wise. Service was adequate for a 4-5 star rating, multiple refills on water when needed, information and attentiveness above average. I'm not a fan of the TVs playing various sports. It doesn't jive with the ambience. Highly recommended location. Good beer, amazing liquor options, food was delicious."], ["Meredith C.", "Slightly embarrassing, but it speaks volumes about this place. I have been here 3 times in a little over a week. It's that good. Yes, it gets busy. Patience is a virtue and you should learn to have it if you want to enjoy amazing food. Honestly, the wait for food isn't even long. The servers for the most part are amazing-some are new and still learning so take that into consideration before you get frustrated. The chefs are inventive and absolute geniuses. I've had the Whiskey Smoked Burger, the Out and In, a bite or two of the Basic Boo and today I had the Steak and Eggs for brunch with a large St. Germaine carafe. I have no complaints. The Steak and Eggs were so beautifully plated I didn't even want to take my knife and fork to them. We sat at the bar and it has been my best experience yet. Anna was so pleasant and knowledgable, I'd be glad to sit there every time. If they have specials while you are in there I highly suggest ordering them. I almost didn't and I would be in taste bud purgatory if I hadn't. \u00a0Give them a shot and don't forget to tip the hard working patrons well.

The night before, Friday, we were out late and we didn't get back to our room and to bed until around 4 a.m. We were up by 9 a.m. and promptly ordered breakfast to our room. Fell back to sleep for a few hours, woke up, started drinking again and spent the afternoon at the pool. Around 4 p.m. we all realized we were STARVING. \u00a0It didn't help the pool was right outside Ruth's Chris, which wouldn't be open for hours.I suggested we go tear into some juicy burgers and some whiskey.

Are you catching on? I like whiskey.Her GF thoroughly enjoyed her burger. We had to take her word for it, because neither of us got to sample it. My SO took a few bites of her Blues Burger and commented \"wow this really has a shit ton of blue cheese on it\". \u00a0My burger was perfect as it has always been. I got two bites and offered my SO a bite...I never got my burger back and quickly noticed her burger on my plate!! It was okay, because it brought happiness to her and that meant we would all be happy... :)I have to agree, her burger, well now my burger, had more blue cheese than necessary.

However The Blind Rabbit lacks in a few areas. I'll go through my experience step by step and you decide. I meet up with a couple of people and we belly-up to the bar before the party arrives for dinner. We are greeted by a pretentious bartender who scolded at the fact I ordered a well whiskey at a whiskey bar. It really bothered me that he would have an attitude about that. Not only that but he also screwed messed up my friends order or \"double makers on the rocks.\" Somehow the drink ended up with cola in it? The party arrives and we are seated. We have one server who is attentive and competent.. Well so we thought. After first ordering a round of waters (took ten minutes to arrive) and then a round of drinks (another ten minutes) we ordered dinner. My friends ordered the fish tacos, a variety of burgers and I ordered the pork belly and oyster sandwich. The burgers were great and the tacos were merely ok (hey it's a burger place). The oysters on my sandwich were super breaded and salty and the pork belly was kind of dry honestly. Overall I was kind of disappointed for a $14 sandwich. At the end of the day I will say this. My friend has a friend that works at the Blind Rabbit at the beaches. His friend even said the service sucks, especially the one in Riverside. Now when your own employees think you suck, that's bad! So here's the skinny, if you want a good burger and are okay with having a two hour dinner (due to slow service) come dine here. There are plenty of other places in Jax for a burger. However if you're confined to Riverside and have no way out and are craving a burger, check it out."], ["Heather W.", "The four stars are for their burgers.

As soon as everyone downed their drinks we were out. (Friday Night)Went back for their Taco Tuesday's. I ordered the rum old fashion as I looked through the menu.

Planned on strolling through the area, so I knew I needed to get some food in my stomach before we started are bar crawl. Of course this was our first stop and I had to get some Knob Creek in my system after our party ordered maybe 2 of each burger and the unicorn in the group ordered wings. When we see our server bring over our food our mouths started to water. We ended up cutting things in halves and quarters and creating our own little buffet of sorts. Every single burger was cooked to perfection. Beautifully seasoned and juicy. But I don't f*ck with those chips. Somehow every time I get them, I feel like I have some leftover strange mix up batch. I bit into a chip and it's regular, then a chip is awesome, then one taste like sour cream, and then another tastes like salt and vinegar? And truthfully this place makes we want to be a carnivore.

I was not \u00a0the biggest fan of the fish tacos. They were okay, but they were not outstanding. For the sauces: the curry mayo is very interesting. I would recommend it if you like curry.

The service was pretty spotty for what seemed like a fairly slow time, and we feared a couple of times that we had been forgotten for orders and then for getting our actual food. Luckily we had book discussion and arguments to distract us, and when our food eventually came out the wait was totally worth it. \u00a0I had the croquette madame, which turned out to be a bunch of different breakfast foods all thrown in a pile and was very strange but also delicious. \u00a0My husband went classic with a barbecue bacon burger, which he says was quite tasty and which came with very delicious fries, some of which I may have stolen.This place is just up the street from us, so we will definitely be back in the future (without a large group!) to try even more delicious foodstuffs and, someday, those whiskeys."], ["Leah A.", "This is a gorgeous restaurant with creative libations and very tasty food. \u00a0I started with their Front Porch Iced Tea which was a tasty, refreshing concoction of top shelf whiskey, moonshine, sweet tea, lemon bitters & freshly muddled raspberry cocktail over ice to wet the appetite. \u00a0This drink was fantastic!Next up, the Poutine. \u00a0I loved this appetizer. \u00a0It was made with hand-cut fries, pork belly, tasso ham, cheese curds, and gravy. \u00a0Perfectly seasoned and not too salty. \u00a0So far, the best poutine I've had on the east coast. \u00a0I will come back just for this.A must try before you die: \u00a0The Whiskey Burger. \u00a0To me, a perfectly cooked medium rare beef burger is almost impossible to get right in most restaurants. \u00a0This place got it right the first time. \u00a0Juicy and flavorful, nice bun to beef ratio, simple toppings that did not detract from the actual burger. \u00a0Generous portion and cooked to perfection. \u00a0I would order this again.Surprisingly delightful: \u00a0The Chicken Thigh Farmer Salad - a wonderful garden of fresh greens served with egg, celery, cucumbers, grape tomatoes, white cheddar cheese, red onion, garlic croutons and black peppercorn dressing. \u00a0So much going on here, but delicious! \u00a0Their rich, marinated, lightly fried chicken thigh served atop the salad put this dish in a league of its own. \u00a0Loved it.Overall, the service was outstanding! \u00a0They have a wonderful staff that was genuinely helpful and super friendly. \u00a0The staff made great recommendations on the dishes offered and I look forward to many more visits to taste the entire menu. \u00a05 STAR FLAVOR!"], ["Mary P.", "Loved this place!

Finally the food was hot and cooked exactly as we ordered it. Has to be the best burger in town. I ordered the bbq burger-a little heavy on the sauce and toppings but they make up for it with the juiciest, flavorful burger meat. You can't go here without trying the goat cheese grits either.

However, I would recommend sharing with others, because it's a quite a large portion, 4 people would be great to share. They are very rich and tasty, and go well with a mixed drink or beer! Their cocktail menu was very unique and worth the price. I ordered the blueberry lemonade cocktail, which came served in a ball jar glass. I mentioned to the waiter I wasn't a fan of the mint and they kindly did light on the mint.

Look, I'm no Rockefeller so my pockets are kind of shallow, if I can save a couple of bucks, that makes my meal taste that much better.Anyhow, the petite poutine didn't look petite but I'm not complaining. It was my first experience with the whole gravy, cheese curds on fries thing and I liked it. I hadn't eaten all day, so my enthusiasm may be tainted by hunger. The gravy was warm and flavorful poured over natural cut French fries. Loved the whole crispy meets savory gravy moment. My husband's burger looked great, the buns were buttered and grilled too. I had the chowder soup bowl. It was pleasantly chunky and the ingredients weren't mushy as if they were overcooked. It was a bit on the salty side as was the poutine but it was still good. \u00a0The couple behind me were enjoying the heck out of the Gorgonzola chips. Such moaning over potatoes!! Next time, I'll order a burger and the fried green tomatoes. Maybe that will knock my socks off. In the meantime, 3 stars for service and food. It was good but saltier than I'm used to. I tend to think someone is overcompensating when a dish is salty (kind of like men who drive Hummers, huge trucks or oversized SUV's to their white collar office jobs).Despite the inattentive service, I'd go back and try different menu items.

These little \"flavor sponges\" really soak up the smoky, savory juices and add another dimension of \"Oh my GOSH this is so delicious!\"*BBQ Bacon Burger - Applewood Bacon, Provolone Cheese, Sweet BBQ Sauce, Crispy Tobacco Onions, Bourbon Spiked Creole Mustard, Brioche Bun.The Southern Burger continues to be my favorite. The crunchy and tangy fried green tomato on top of an ultra juicy burger is a perfect marriage of flavors and textures. Move over Ketchup and Mustard, we're too good for you now. The fun continues by choosing numerous sauces to try with their french fries! Having graduated from the elementary blas\u00e9 Ketchup, Blind Rabbit dazzles with the sauce choices of; Curry Mayo, Spicy Ketchup, Creole Mayo, Honey Mustard, Bourbon Spiked Creole Mustard, Tartar Sauce, Peach Habanero Hot Sauce, and Bourbon BBQ Sauce.The incredible Bourbon BBQ Sauce is my PERSONAL favorite!!! It's a MUST TRY!I have also greatly enjoyed the Fried Green Tomato appetizer at the Beaches Location (see other review for details.)My favorite place to sit at the Blind Rabbit is at one of the tables built on a raised platform alongside the windows. I like the elevated VIP feeling, the window watching, and the intimacy of the two-person tables. A enormous Shaun Thurston masterpiece is painted along the outside wall. Viewers are powerless to withstand taking a photo shoot in front of this amazing backdrop! I love you Blind Rabbit. If Peewee Herman himself asked, \"If you love it so much, why don't you marry it?\"I probably would! Now to go back and try that Blues Burger!"], ["Scott C.", "Went for the brunch this Sunday. \u00a0Excellent bacon infused whiskey Bloody Mary to start - jalape\u00f1o adds a bit of morning zing. \u00a0Had deviled eggs as.a starter which were a bit too mustardy. \u00a0For the main course had pork belly and easy over eggs on grits which was very well done - the pork belly is well worth a try. \u00a0My wife had the chicken and waffles which she really liked - the waffles had a great sweet potato cream cheese dallop on them - quite good. \u00a0Try the carafe of bubbly and St. Germaine - quite refreshing. \u00a0Service was a bit slow but very entertaining."], ["Leticia C.", "Food was good. Like the atmosphere. Ordered a burger which was juicy and good. Definitely will return."], ["Nick S.", "Great great great. Delicious. Original and sublime tastebud stimulation. Delicious ways to get inebriated like old fashion and blackberry lemonade."], ["Maya C.", "Let me just start by saying this. I miss the old Blind Fig menu. Changing the name to the Blind Rabbit to match the Beaches location also meant matching the menu and that menu a lot of the really great items are no longer served anymore, including the desserts.A group of us went in on a Tuesday night and found it to be kinda dead to our surprise. No matter, that meant more attention would be on our group. Sweet. We all get settled towards the back of the restaurant and pine over the menu, comparing what's still on it and what got the axe.I got the Front Porch Iced Tea, which contains a bourbon whiskey and moonshine. I never had either let alone together so I though caution to the wind and took a swallow. SOOO GOOD! The sweet tea, raspberries, and lemon bitters made for a good drink to have on a humid summer night. A friend highly recommended the Gorgonzola chips. I've had Gorgonzola before, but all I could think of were cartoons where characters had close pins on their noses when around it, like Limburger cheese so that made me think it was pungent. It's actually not and tastes very similar to blue cheese which I like. The cheese fondue with the balsamic glaze over a mound of housemade chips was the perfect appetizer.I finally settled on the Southern Burger as it sounded the most interesting. Pickled Okra, Fried Green Tomato, Creole Pimento Cheese, Peach Habanero Hot Sauce and Georgia Cane Syrup? Bring it on! The burger was awesome but the side of Tobacco Onions left little to be desired. It was ok but it was a big pile of fried onion pieces for one person to finish. I shared some Cast Iron Mac N Cheese with a friend and both thought it was good, not as amazing as our server made it out to be, just good. I think the five cheese sauce must've sunk to the bottom. I passed on dessert as milkshakes, ice cream, and brownies didn't appeal to me.I may be back to have the Shrimp and Grits again (one item from the original menu that was kept) but I do hope that they consider bringing back some favorites."], ["Samantha K.", "The blind rabbit is great and a HUGE upgrade from the blind or salty or whatever fig. To start, both the ambiance and the service are great. At 9:30 on a Tuesday night the bartenders were still very upbeat, friendly and helpful and there was still a decent crowd which is a good sign. The drink I had---blackberry mule or something or other--delicious. The burger. Omg the burger. The southern burger. Asked for medium rare and it could not have been more perfectly cooked. The fried green tomato on top was amazing. The garlic smashed potatoes on the side were equally as amazing. Hands down best burger I've had in a while. This is my new go to--very stylish but still welcoming and affordable. Two thumbs up!"], ["Chelsey N.", "We ate the gorgonzola chips, wings, and french fries.... Are were absolutely delicious. I had the blackberry lemonade and it was also amazing. The atmosphere is great. I read reviews about slow service. Not the case. Bartender was fast and super friendly.

The food is delish, the service is attentive, and the cocktails are refreshing. I have tried the fried chicken salad-it's a winner. The chowder is filling and a great start to a meal. Also, if you get fries with your burger or sandwich, you get a TON. It gets crowded on the weekends for dinner. Luckily they notify you by text if you are waiting, so you can head down the street to window shop or get a drink at a local bar while you wait. I was kinda ho-hum about this place when they were the Blind Fig, but whatever they have done since the change to the Blind Rabbit is working well! It's one of my preferred dinner options on the weekends and a great place to get a decent drink. It's definitely worth a visit with a date or with friends. You're sure to have a good time and enjoy your eats in the process. Five stars."], ["Martha G.", "I have been twice to this location and both times I've had a great experience. The food and service have been top notch, and the atmosphere has been very conducive to a group gathering to enjoy food and have fun. I have had the Smokehouse Rib Eye Steak with garlic mashed potatoes, roasted grape tomatoes, crispy tobacco onions, and blackberry hot sauce; and the Southern Burger. Everything has been flavorful and absolutely delicious. This eatery needs to be on your \"MUST\" list."], ["Natasha D.", "I've been to this location once. It's ok. For a newer place it smells of bar rot already. I was in the industry for a long time and recognize that odor. It was 3pm on a Thursday and I was just doing a little exploring in the area. There was a yelp review that stated there was a happy hour until 7. Which wasn't the case. My well vodka was $5.25 and was terrible. The bartender seemed annoyed to even be waiting on me. Until I paid. Then she was chipper. I'm sure it's fun to gather with a group of friends. It was an odd time. I haven't had their food. But compared to the beach location, this place is nowhere near as good. The service at the beach is 10 times better. Again, I've only been once and maybe the timing was off. I may go again with a group of friends."], ["Eric M.", "Visited here on July 3rd and ordered the Number One Classic Cheeseburger and bowl of Crab & Corn Chowder. Let's start with the burger first. The burger was cooked to perfection. The thick patty was juicy and had an amazing flavor. It was well worth the $10. That's were the game ended. The crab and corn chowder needed something... like an overhaul. I'm not sure what went wrong here but the flavor was just lacking completely. So, zero stars for the chowder. I should have complained, but didn't. I guess the burger had me under a spell.Wait staff was helpful but not overly friendly. I would return for the burger or something new."], ["Jim C.", "We stopped in to try the Southern Burger which is trimmed with fried green tomato, pimento cheese, peach habanero sauce and okra pickles. \u00a0Side order choice was bourbon flavored mashed sweet potato. \u00a0The burger flavors just didn't blend for me. \u00a0Service was very good and I will give it another try."], ["Byron R.", "Hands down best burger ever! \u00a0Cooked perfectly and the sides were great. \u00a0Tremendous whiskey selection as well."], ["Jessica L.", "Maybe when we came it was a bad night but the service here is pretty horrible!

Because this was a solid post-game spot. \u00a0 --- \u00a0 --- \u00a0 ---Ok, so I'll admit: I wasn't in the most cheerful of moods for my visit here. I drove up to Jax from Tampa during the wee hours of the morning, expecting to see a Browns win. Unfortunately, we not only lost, but were destroyed by the winless Jaguars, who as of this writing, have yet to win another game. Sigh.That being said, it's tough to mess up a burger with BBQ sauce and bacon on it, and the Blind Rabbit's was version was squarely in the 4-star range for me: not the best ever, but above average.The unfortunate part of our experience was that our server seemed to be fairly annoyed with our existence when we arrived. By the end of the meal, she'd had a change of heart and was friendly, but I'm not sure what her issue was early on. Maybe she too was a Browns fan? If that's the case, I can't blame her.The peach milkshake photos looked amazing, but unfortunately they were all out of peach. Damn you produce orderer!!Thanks Blind Rabbit... by the way, I left some tears on your floor when no one was looking. You can't lose to Blake Bortles. You just can't."], ["David P.", "Always been a HUGE Blind Rabbit Fan! Have eaten at the Beach and King St Locations, and eaten many of the burgers and other menu items! Unfortunately, far too often, including last visit, I left feeling disappointed and robbed. We went in for the Sunday Brunch and I ordered the Southern Breakfast, which included a variety of breakfast staples. When I recieved my food, the breakfast potatoes were luke warm at best, the grits were ice cold, along with the biscuit with gravy which was cool and rock hard, as if it was stale. I was hungry enough to where I ate some of it until I decided enough was enough and mentioned to my waitress, Ashley, who was extremely nice and friendly and good at her job, and tried to fix the issue. Ashley immediately brought me out another biscuit and gravy and order or grits, the biscuit being a little warmer while the grits were still ice cold. I felt like I was robbed for having to pay for cold food but Ashley did do a great job as waitress by at least trying. I have eaten the burgers plenty of times and absolutely love them! Stay away from the Goat Cheese Grits and stick to the burgers and you'll be just fine! I wish I could give more stars, but after the last couple experiences, I cannot give more than 3."], ["Amy R.", "What a great experience! \u00a0Don't let the surrounding neighborhoods fool you - this place is a diamond in the rough. \u00a0I don't like tomatoes but tried the fried green tomatoes because everyone else raved about them. \u00a0They were awesome! \u00a0The housemade peach habanero sauce is killer! \u00a0I also had the gorgonzola chips, which were fabulous. \u00a0Definitely recommend visiting this place if you're in the area."], ["Jon F.", "Pretty good, I had the fried green tomatoes, shrimp and grits and the brownie dessert.

Would eat it again. I also had the mac n cheese and the Peach Habanero Hot Sauce (which is basically like buffalo sauce with a hint of peach). The waitress was kind enough to give me a small sample of each sauce to go in little cups. Curry Mayo, Spicy Ketchup, Creole Mayo, Honey Mustard, Bourbon Spiked Creole Mustard, Bourbon BBQ Sauce. All of which are really good. Certainly a place to check out whether you're in riverside or at the one in Jax beach. They are both good."], ["Jill C.", "I have heard nothing but good things about The Blind Rabbit, and I have had lots of friends tell me I needed to go there, so we did! They have 2 locations, one at the beach and one in Riverside. We visited the Riverside location since it was closer to home.We decided on the Poutine for our appetizer. For those of you unfamiliar with a Poutine, it is Hand-Cut Fries, Pork Belly, Tasso Ham, Cheese Curds, and Gravy....aka delicious! The gravy had a very nice taste and the fries were crispy.I got The Holick Burger for my entree. It had a Sunny Side Egg, Intuition Braised Pork Belly, Tomato, Arugula, Homemade Bread & Butter Pickles, Lemon Aioli, on a Brioche Bun. I thought the burger was very good, but it didn't really need the pork belly. I don't think it did anything for the burger and it wasn't very flavorful. However, the rest of the burger was great. I got mac and cheese on the side. It was very creamy and the topping was crunchy and flavorful.My husband got the Blues Burger, which had Maytag Blue Cheese, Caramelized Onions, Lettuce, Tomato, Homemade Bread & Butter Pickles, and a Brioche Bun. He has been craving a good burger and said that this one hit the spot! He got fries on the side.Verdict: Liked itWe really liked everything and were pleasantly surprised. We didn't try any whiskey on this trip, but \u00a0they have a very large whiskey menu for those who are interested. While the prices are not outrageous, they are a little higher than some burger places in town. Still, I think it is definitely worth it.

To my dismay, the two tacos ($12) had very little meat on then (see picture). One of the pieces was under-cooked. I addressed this with the waitress and she expressed that this was, of course, not normal. The floor manager came over and explained that the fish is weighed in 6 oz. servings. He quickly walked away before I had the chance to say anything. I was concerned that this indeed was not a 6 oz. serving, but I didn't argue.

The decor is modern and comfortable with a large lounge area. A small parking lot meant I took advantage of the complimentary valet.My dinner date and I chose the patio since it was a nice evening and they have heaters outside. We were in a bubbly mood and enjoyed a glass of prosecco. \u00a0We started with the cheese plate and chose the manchego, aged gouda, and bellatoir. The plate came with local honey, grapes, Marconi almonds and toasted baguette. I died and went to cheese plate heaven. Maybe it just filled a massive craving, but damn, was it good. The bellatoir, a soft French cheese, was the winner of the evening.We then moved on to sharing bacon wrapped dates, crab cakes, and chorizo empanadas. I love dates and these didn't disappoint. The crab cakes were very good with little filler and the empanadas were crispy without being overly greasy. \u00a0For dessert, we had the homemade s'mores with a generous dusting of sea salt on top.

I highly recommend this place for people who enjoy non-traditional brunch options, as it has several latin-inspired and latin-fusion brunch options. Although it doesn't apply to me, I appreciate the vegetarian and gluten-free options available on the menu. I had my first Michelada, here. *GUSHING* it's basically a bloody mary made with beer instead. it makes for a fine libation when you add a little hot sauce to it. yummayyy. Some of the brunch options are also tapas style, so you may have to order more than one item to satiate your appetite. As with other tapas restaurants, I recommend going with 3 or more ppl to maximize the experience. We ordered the tamale and the salmon plate. The tamale will definitely not fill you up. The salmon platter is great for sharing. It was served on a wooden board with capers, red onions, peppers, eggs, and bread. I liked the presentation of the foods. The ambience is great. It's quite contemporary, but inviting. In the center of the restaurant are sofas for dining and groups. There is also outdoor seating.

All the tapas were cooked perfectly and well prepared. We ended our evening with Limoncello bread pudding just to reminisce our Italian honeymoon & the constant indulging in limoncello. The ice cream on top of the bread pudding was a slight lemon flavor but not typical \"limoncello\" flavor that Italy is famous for. Service was great and we were greeted by the host staff and server.

Seriously who hired her? She belongs in the back washing dishes. With that being said I haven't gone back here and I even unfollowed them on Instagram. They lost two customers for sure.

Finally made it back with a girlfriend after work to check the place out. Grabbed a beer at the bar while I waited for her. We were seated on the porch. Very excited to see one of my favorite waiters from Orsay would be waiting on us.We started with an order of the Herbed Truffle Fries to snack on while we perused the rest of the menu. I ordered the Heirloom Tomato Salad special. It was a stack of gorgeous tomatoes topped with a goat cheese fritter. It was delicious. The tomatoes were dressed just right and the goat cheese added just the right amount of richness and tang. For our next course, I ordered the shrimp & grits and my dining partner had the seared scallops special. My plate was good, but I can't say it was amazing. It wasn't at all bad, I just think unfortunately I have a very high bar for making a serious impression when it comes to shrimp & grits because I've had it almost everywhere in Jacksonville. I tasted a bite of one of her scallops, they were seared perfectly and melted like butter on your tongue. As they should.For dessert we had an order of the s'mores and the limoncello bread pudding. Both were delicious and I've finally come to appreciate bread pudding as a part of my life. Didn't like it as a kid, but love it now.

The bruschetta sampler was amazing, everything was very fresh and delicious!"], ["Allie A.", "A group of friends had been planning this outing to Ovinte for over a month, and this past Saturday we finally got together to make this it happen. We all know that Town Center parking can be a pain in the ass, but they offer complimentary valet, which is great. No driving around in circles and fighting with folks for a spot. Nice touch. Certainly a bit swanky on the inside, but I didn't feel it to be in a pretentious way. It's smaller than I would have thought from the outside, but plenty of seating, couches, tables and the patio has the same seating offering outside as well. There were 9 of us that met around 7 pm on a Saturday night and we were lucky enough to score one of the couch areas outside.... an upscale South Beach feel with the dark wicker, cozy cushions and huge umbrellas. Our server was excellent and hilarious, even when he walked into some crazy conversations we were having! He did a fantastic job of going through the menu, explaining the different wines to the group and was just an all around enjoyable guy. My boyfriend and I started with a cheese and charcuterie plate... we really wanted a broad range so went with seven options, four cheeses and three meats. The group ordered quite a few different things, including the sliders, truffle fries, pork skewers, clams, and probably a few I am forgetting. :) Cheese and charcuterie was great.... the boy loved the prosciutto and the platter also had spiced almonds and a honeycomb. \u00a0Everything was great and the possibilities for different flavors and varieties made for a great experience. Our friends enjoyed a few bottles of wine, and me being a beer girl for life, was pleased with the selection of craft beers. I also really dug the music that was playing: downbeat, dreamy electronic that sounded just like my favorite Pandora station. Very laid back, hip and chill. We were still a bit hungry after the platter. After taking in the scene and enjoying the company for about two hours, everyone ordered the s'mores for dessert and a few espressos. The s'mores were simple, but amazing. Just two grahams filled with marshmallow, with one side dipped in chocolate with a bit of sea salt sprinkled on top. Soooooo good in the melt in your mouth kinda way. There was no talking for about five minutes. :) The sliders our friends ordered looked incredible so we ordered them to go. Topped with saut\u00e9ed onion and cheese, these little guys were cooked perfectly, and still had pink in the center. A lot of sliders I've had elsewhere can be a bit on the smaller side and overcooked, but wow, these were excellent. Overall, the food was on point, maybe a tad pricy for the smaller portions, but the vibe of Ovinte offered a lot to the experience. Will definitely return.Forgot to add on the first post: Although we did not have this particular server, my friends were adamant about mentioning Chelsea, their server from a different visit... they highly recommend asking for her!"], ["Robert P.", "You can't tell from the street but this place is fantastic. Great variety in the menu and loads of flavored you've never tried before.

The place is a lot like willy wonkas candy land. I saw and was treated to some small tasting bits. Well today I took a wrong turn and ended up downtown and thought what the heck. I have read a lot of the reviews for the candy apple cafe and even entertained eating during my ventures downtown for artwork and Jaxon night market. They are normally packed and have live music. Today I stopped on around lunch. Never really eating here made the decision easy. I was looking at the menu and saw chicken cracklins. I had to question this and find out of they were just chunks of chicken or true cracklins. When my question was answered I ordered them quickly. Who doesn't fry chicken and eat the skin first. Me me me me. All the time and it is my most favorite pieces. They came out and were as delicious as I thought they would be. They added some franks hot sauce and some blue cheese drizzle to them and placed them onto a bed of slaw. It was a great dish in this southern heart. Not good for it but I haven't really done much good for the body either. I also asked my server and everyones else's bartender about their cornered beef. They make it and smoke it on site. I went with the reuben sandwich which came out very quickly. It was filled with real meat not the parts is parts slabs that are normally sliced and piled onto some bread. No but this one was real meat on rye toast with a fair amount of 1000's of islands dressing. It was a good sandwich and it made me want to remember it for the future. So like you are suppose to I ventured out across from the restaurant to the candy shops and had to buy some really bad for me stuff in a box. Oh yea I also had to sneak a peek at the chocolate factory too. The inner kid in my made so it's not my fault either."], ["Jay M.", "The following review was published under my byline in the Florida Times-Union on Saturday, April 18, 2015. This is an original, unabridged version of that review.For more than a century, Downtown Jacksonville's historic Seminole Club was a hub of recreation for Jacksonville's elite. Today, the rest of us can consume the storied building's charms--of the architectural and culinary kind--with its transformation into the Candy Apple Caf\u00e9 & Cocktails and Sweet Pete's. The restaurant, retail shop and event space opened in December in the shadows of the Skyway, City Hall and Hemming Park in the urban core.Enter through the porch-wrapped front door off Hogan Street and you'll find a buzzing scene. Veer right to Sweet Pete's retail store, or beeline left to Candy Apple's dining room. Upstairs you'll find more Sweet Pete's retail and a windowed vista into the candy factory. One level beyond that are classrooms and event space.But let's venture back down to the dining room. With garish d\u00e9cor cues--crystal chandeliers, stripes and solids--the scene is a mashup of \"Alice in Wonderland\" and \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory,\" a multicolored menagerie of whimsical grandeur. In a nod to its heritage, black-and-white framed photos of downtown Jacksonville from the olden days ring the perimeter walls.The menu boasts of \"anytime\" brunch, lunch and dinner, with special dinner appetizers and entrees that rotate daily or every other day. My family tried it the Sunday before Easter, which coincided with Sweet Pete's egg hunt in Hemming and the Easter Bunny's arrival. As usual, we did a menu mashup of our own and began with two appetizers. The Artisan Cheese Board ($10 for two cheeses; $2 for each additional cheese) was a fun palette of candied walnuts, apricots, cranberries and figgy dip. Our featured cheeses were the creamy Georgia Red, tart and spicy Gorgonzola Piccante and buttery Point Reyes Toma.Angling for the sweet side of the menu, we tried the Candy Cherrywood Bacon ($6), three candied strips on wooden skewers atop mixed greens and gorgonzola crumbles. It was very tasty and a nice warmup for my sweet tooth, but barely enough for a couple to share.The Candy Apple Bisque ($5 for my half order; $7 for full-on bisque) was a mild-mannered mix of chunky tomatoes with a goat cheese kick.Entr\u00e9e-wise, my gluten-intolerant wife had an easy go of the menu, with plentiful \"GF\" tags next to the gluten-absent items. She went for a half order of the Short Rib Meatloaf ($11; $16 for a full order), a beautiful presentation with tomato jam in a port reduction atop brown butter whipped potatoes and petite vegetables (in our case, green beans). The meat itself needed a pinch or two of salt to bring around the flavor, but otherwise it was a fine, substantial meal.My choice from the \"Anytime Brunch\" menu, the Rock Shrimp & Grits ($13), featured saut\u00e9ed rock shrimp, a smaller variety, blended with grits from Alachua's Greenway Farms and finished with a chunky tomato and onion relish. It was a very creamy number on top of a brothy base, with nice zest provided by the tomato-onion garnish, which helped balance the flavor.You'll find dessert on another skinny menu, paired with craft cocktail and happy hour selections. Unfortunately, Candy Apple was fresh out of their signature gourmet candy apples ($9). Undeterred, I opted for a Banana Trifle Br\u00fbl\u00e9e ($7). This oversized shot glass boasted layers of vanilla custard, banana bread and what appeared to be vanilla wafers, with a whipped topping. It's not sized for sharing but delicious sweet tooth satisfaction nonetheless, a classed-up banana pudding.Candy Apple also offers a full bar with craft (Intuition and Bold City) and crafty beers, 13 wines by the glass and 25 by the bottle, along with eight signature cocktails. Happy hours are Tuesday through Friday, 5 to 7 p.m. and feature discounted cocktails, house wine, Champagne, 2-for-1 local beers and food-beverage pairings.Candy Apple is a versatile setting for family brunch or lunchtime/after-hours getaways. Just save some room to browse Sweet Pete's across the foyer.

Cocktails do not disappoint and I was so happy to see vodka drinks make with Titos-- my fave! The Bloody Mary was very good. We ordered the cheese tray appetizer and it was fantastic.. Great combo with fruit and candied nuts. It could have had more of the baguette slices. My entree I ordered the kale-quinoa salad.. Was really needing something lighter. It was wonderful! The kale was tender and had a fantastic dressing. I've heard rave reviews about the bacon Mac and cheese and their burgers. But they have fabulous vegetarian options too!"], ["Susan H.", "So, from the beginning- there's free valet parking. If you don't feel like your car is valet worthy & you have some extra quarters, you can park around the block & feed a meter. (I didn't know about the valet parking until I walked up!)When you walk up its a beautiful old building w/ a huge porch - think Charleston SC. \u00a0They seem to have kept a lot of the character that such an old building would have, great floors & staircases & molding around the doorways, Beyond that, it's like Willy Wonka decorated. It's adorable & whimsical. Perfect for creating atmosphere, lots of little touches throughout. As soon as I walked in someone greeted me & offered me a salted caramel treat. (Please & thank you!)Found my friend at a window seat, we had a nice view of the court house & park. It felt very metropolitan. I'm not sure if it was just loud from the different conversations but we had a difficult time hearing our server. And honestly, he didn't seem very interested in interacting w/ us. No eye contact or suggestions about the menu at all. He just mumbled \"do you have any questions about the menu?\" when he made it over to take our order. We ordered the sweet potato fries, which were very good! They're fried in tempura batter & come w/ an orange sesame sauce. Unusual pairing but it worked.I ordered lemon ricotta pancakes, which came out burnt and a good 5-10 minutes before my friends shrimp & grits. It was implied that I got a side w/ them (I was surprised & didn't think it did, but when the server asked \"what would you like on the side?\" I went w/ it. Imagine my surprise when I was charged for a side item on the receipt.) So I also got biscuits & gravy...which were also pretty dry & toasty. The biscuits had a light citrus/lemon flavor to them, and they were served w/ sausage gravy... It was an interesting combination, I wasn't crazy about it. My friend's shrimp & grits were covered in melted butter (at least 1-2 centimeters of standing butter over the entire dish) all she managed to eat was the shrimp. The food was ok at best. The service was a bit less so (we didn't get checked on after the meals were brought out, and it took forever to get the check.) The saving grace is the decor, and the dessert. On the 2nd floor you have a HUGE candy store! All of the employees in both candy stores were very welcoming & knowledgable about the products. There's a parlor with a nice view of downtown where you can sit, eat dessert, drink cocktails & play games. The 3rd floor is where they do classes & parties. It's an amazing space! Would def. consider hosting a group event here in the future...(for the candy/cocktails class for work groups or a bday party.) I would go back, but probably not for a meal.I'm glad that they're here & give some more life to downtown! And I love the whimsical dessert/candy aspect of it. Was pretty disappointed w/ the meal & service though."], ["Kendra B.", "My new favorite place in Jacksonville!! Came here looking for a \"fun\" lunch spot. I don't have traditional weekends so Monday was my Saturday, even on a Monday this place was packed. Side note, they have a valet right in front of the restaurant. We were seated right away and had a nice table. It was extremely cold in there but I have found that all Florida restaurants are typically cold and always bring a sweater. The ambiance and decor were incredible. We started with the Popsicle mimosas and they were so good. Very fresh tasting and didn't seem like they used 2$ cheap champagne. We then had the watermelon drink, can't remember it's name but it was so tasty.For lunch I had the petite Angus sliders and petite corn dogs. Both were amazing but the sliders were so flavorful it left me wanting more. When I come back I will be ordering the full size burger. The candy store is fun and packed with childhood favorites. We sampled the Carmel and it was Devine.

During the wait we decided to check out the candy store (which is awesome by the way). Never received a text for seating after 15 minutes but hostess saw us still waiting and quickly sat us in the outdoor seating. Waitress was nice and served us well.

When we all had arrived we were shown to our table..the colors and artwork and even the chairs are all so beautiful..we had a group of six and had a table with a banquette on one side and chairs on the other side..there was a large glass cherry in the center and we were surrounded by large windows and cheery paint colors..the linens are black and white checker print and the servers wear shirts that matched.We all took a moment to take in the drink menu first and decided on several different options that we later passed around the table for all to try..i personally had the Hogans Hero and it was delish..also at the table were a cherry pop, a hung jury, and a cowford punch..after all the tasting i enjoyed my drink the best! There is also a large variety of beers and wines available, as well as some happy hour offerings.Next we moved on to the appetizer menu where we found many different and fun options..for the table we had mini corn dogs, sweet potato fries, a cheese plate, and the star of the appetizer was the buffalo chicken cracklin..they take chicken skin and i guess bake it till its super crispy..then put hot sauce and blue cheese on it..it was a weird concept to read on a menu, but it was super tasty..while munching happily and sipping cocktails, we were all also deciding what our entrees would be, and it was no easy feat! \u00a0seeing that you can have brunch anytime was a game changer for most of us, but oddly no one went for it..at our table there was cornmeal dusted flounder, shortrib meatloaf, shrimp and grits, a reuben, a kale quinoa salad, a lamb special and for myself the sea bass special..the owner of the meatloaf was a little under enthused by it and left a majority on her plate..when the server, who was a bit lack luster, asked if she needed a box and she said no, nothing more was said, she never asked if it was because it wasnt good..everyone else really enjoyed thier food, and we all raved to each other..especially me..this sea bass was cooked perfectly with a light crunchy crust of some sort, and it was served on top of truffle whipped potatoes that were the best i have ever tasted..i rarely order potatoes when i go out to eat, because i had so many bad servings of boxed mush..this was NOT the case here..they were flavorful and amazing and served next to sauteed broccolini..all in all this meal was a hit! \u00a0I wish i had taken pictures of all the empty plates, scraped clean!As the table was being cleared and we were all in a full state of bliss..the time came that we all knew coming to a place with candy apple in the name would come..the server asked ..are you ready for dessert? \u00a0she had someone bring over an assortment of candy apples and advised us that they could all be sliced up for sharing..had i not been so full of my amazing meal, i may have partaken..instead we all opted to share one dessert, the chocolate torte with espresso buttercream..it was rich and velvety and sweet, perfect end to this wonderful meal..i will be back to try the fried chicken, the mac and cheese and also the brunch options, and probably to do some shopping in the candy store..cant wait to enter this place again..its like willy wonka and alice in wonderland all in one!!"], ["Jim A.", "Great place, the best escargot; it is done perfectly.

Wait, what? I mean... Uh... The Candy Apple is effin' adorable. It's cute, but not in a childish way and the bright colors of the furniture make a great visual balance against stark black and white floors. If all you wanted to do was live here, it's a great place. Five stars, done deal. If you want to eat here.... well, that's a different story.For the prices, I'd have honestly expected better food and certainly better service. I ordered the angus burger and it was a decent example of a burger... but I've had better at Five Guys and for half the price. However, I understand that half the cost of a meal out is the ambiance (okay, fine, sold) and service (well, let's talk about that). The downside of the adorable styling was that the restaurant itself was FREEZING. I get summer in Florida, but it was APRIL, so what the heck was up.This is a nit-picky thing, but I drink a lot of water, so it's kind of important to me: the water glasses are cute, but no for real, I'm an adult, where's the real glasses. As for the service..... Our waiter left (the restaurant; his shift was over, apparently) and didn't pass us off to anyone, so we sat, abandoned and ever-hungrier (never having ordered because he brought us water and left), for nearly thirty minutes before I flagged down the hostess as she was seating another table.The replacement server was fine, I guess, but fine doesn't make up for being discarded.To justify the prices and the meh service, their food needed to be fantastic and it really, really wasn't. It was fine and if you're hungry and don't want to wander farther from Hemming Plaza than line of sight, it's a fair choice.

Apparently all the vacant tables had reservations, a few of which were never filled during out entire meal. Fortunately we were able to sit at the bar and enjoy brunch.

Total web redemption for Candy Apple for me! \u00a0My first review was based on trips in first week open and a couple weeks later. \u00a0Today was my sixth time there since opening. My friend and I both ordered items we found problematic on previous visits and new items to try. \u00a0We started with sweet potato frites and deviled eggs. I could eat the orange sesame cream that accompanies the frites on everything. The frites were tender and coated in a very light tempura. My favorite deviled egg was the spicy hummus and even my friend who first declined her share, once coaxed, loved it. We then moved on to entrees and sides that we had said we would not order again. I had the meatloaf with an extra side of greens and an extra of mac n cheese. My friend had the flounder. The meatloaf was juicy and perfectly seasoned. The Mac n cheese was creamy with plenty of fontina flavor and the fresh ground spice (peppery nutmeg?) was more pronounced than I remembered (that's a good thing). \u00a0Flounder was equally delightful. The greens were the best I have ever had. Not too salty with big chunks of meat. I mixed bites of them with meatloaf or mac n cheese for wonderful variations of taste. \u00a0The service was impeccable. \u00a0Just a tip -make a reservation for the sun porch. Hey Candy Apple does the sun porch have a name? \u00a0That would be a fun contest. Name the sun porch."], ["Jamie B.", "Love this place. It was our second time. The atmosphere is fun! It is a bit loud. If it's nice outside try sitting on the porch. Both times our servers were knowledgable and friendly. This visit was for my mother in laws birthday. They were so nice as to put a candle in the center of the Apple so we could sing to her then they removed it and cut it for us and brought it back. She loved it. I do have a complaint. Both times we wanted to try the caramel apple with bacon and they did not have it. Actually they only had the rocky road this time and it was right when they opened. I have reached out via Instagram to ask why. I would think since the Apple is their theme they would have all flavors available most of the time. The caramel for the apples I understand is made by Sweet Pete's. The food is amazing. I had the fried chicken and I must say it was crispy and perfectly seasoned. The collards were just like my moms with a nice smoky vinegar pop. The mashed potatoes were good...a bit thick but tasty. My mother \u00a0in law got the same dish but with fries. The fries are good but a little soft. My husband got the angus burger and loved it. Father in law went for the short rib meatloaf which was tasty. Our appetizer was the sweet potato fries man was that a good decision. They have a tempura coating and the sauce is so good!!!!!!! We are meeting friends there this Friday and can't wait to try something new. On our previous trip we had the chicken skins (just try them) and the corn dogs with beer cheese dip. We also had an old fashion with rock candy stick and a Seminole club. One last thing. I suggest reservations. Otherwise their is typically a wait!

The food is good, and the cocktails are bad.Despite overlooking a concentration of Jacksonville's homeless population, The Candy Apple Cafe porch could be among Jacksonville's best places to eat and drink outside. \u00a0Past the porch, \u00a0the decor parallels the decadence offered in the menu. As you walk into the restaurant, your eyes will be assaulted by blue walls contrasted by black-and-white horizontal stripes. Over-sized cherries punctuate the room with red. While bulky chairs, thickly framed photography and crystal-adorned chandeliers make the space feel crowded -- even when it's nearly empty. The room is full of interesting choices, and I assume Juicy Couture inspired most of the decorating decisions.The cocktails are not worth drinking. You're better off drinking from the beer and wine list. We found two cocktails particularly harsh. The Very Cherry Pop should include a diabetes warning label; it's insanely sweet. And the Cowford Punch shares a nearly indistinguishable resemblance to a screwdriver. If you're going with wine, the cheese board is curated at a good price point, and if you're going with beer, you won't be disappointed by the petite corn dogs."], ["Mark M.", "The short rib meatloaf was to die for.

I had a side of their mac & cheese and the arugula salad. I'm a mac & cheese snob, and I'm telling you it was great! The salad was super delicious, too. My husband and other friend got cocktails. Being 5 months pregnant, I sadly couldn't partake. One of the cocktails had rock candy in it! They looked beautiful and both guys said they were yummy. My husband got the meatloaf. It was tasty and really smoky. After dinner we strolled upstairs to the dessert bar where there were cookies and all kinds of ice cream!! Did I mention I'm currently pregnant? Hence the excitement for both cookies AND ice cream. I had to try both. I got a salted toffee butterscotch cookie (oh yeah!) and a small thai coconut ice cream.

Obviously family friendly with a dessert bar and the fun yet sophisticated atmosphere, mixed with a younger feel. Knowledgeable 20-30 something's would look forward to its eclectic drink menu, it's array of food choices from turns on great southern dishes to a beautiful Sea Scallops appetizer. Which I immediately ordered upon hearing the specials. They were so large, one was too undercooked for my taste. But they refired it and it came back a few minutes later - perfect! I also had the shrimp crepe. This was an almost unbearably perfect dish. I wanted to savor every single bite. No lumping flavors together here!! Each bite offered the taste of fresh rock shrimp perfectly seasoned with the spinach & creme Fraiche. I'm writing and dreaming about it the day after. The collared greens! Wow. Delicious! We had the butter lettuce salad which is perfect. Light w grapefruit and I'd prefer without bacon but the bacon makes sense. Salt and sweet. Beautiful. For dessert - surprised I wasn't as impressed due to the name. The apple layered tart(the real name I'm not sure of) was served cold. Very cold. My friends and I with about 50 years of restaurant experience between the 3 of us, thought it should have been served at least room temperature. But just because it wasn't our vision for this dessert so be it, \u00a0we enjoyed it as is. A chocolate tiered crisp dessert was the favorite of the two. My friend LOVED it. I thought it was good. Both desserts were served with gorgeous fresh berries and fresh whipped cream which finished both desserts perfectly. Lastly, our server was Chelsea. She was an exceptional server. Professional, sweet, informative, and efficient. An asset to this restaurant. Thank you for the wonderful time!

Unfortunately, the food ranged from poor to mediocre. \u00a0The vegetables were cafeteria quality, the pasta sauce was tasteless, and the wine was grossly overpriced for the quality. Regrettably, the table service was terrible. Our server's manner ranged from unprofessionally chatty to pretentious and condescending. He failed to handle the most basic tasks in a professional or competent manner, from introducing the specials and menu items, to answering questions, taking orders, and managing the table (removing unnecessary cutlery and dirty plates, etc.). \u00a0It would be unfair to expect high-end service from what is merely an upscale, mid-range restaurant.

There was no planned menu as Dwight just cooks what he gets fresh that day and is directed to create what he likes based on those ingredients spur of the moment. \u00a0That awesome creative mentality is still true today for Dwight's menu. \u00a0Although there are some 'staples', such as his renown Crab Cakes and Pan Cooked Foie Gras appetizers, I always order from the non-menu specials when I patronize Dwight's restaurant today. I know these are the dishes that will have been created with the freshest ingredients and most passion! \u00a0The service is always good here, the wine list impeccable and the food uncompromisingly eclectic and amazing. \u00a0Note: \u00a0Make sure you have your Platinum card when you go as Dwight's IS expensive. \u00a0Dinner for 2 could cost you well over $100.00 with aps and drinks.

It is owned and operated by a chef and it's located in a very unassuming strip mall in Jax Beach. Like other hidden gems, don't be thrown by the location! It is all about food and spot on, smooth and friendly service. Upon entry, you are greeted by a quaint Mediterranean dining room and low lighting. Definitely make reservations as the place is space challenged :) We were greeted by our server who asked if it was our first time dining with them. He took the time to review the menu and provide recommendations. He also brought over delicious bread, made in house by Dwight himself.After his suggestions and our deliberations, we selected crabcakes for an appetizer. The crabcakes were meaty and barely had any filler. Considering my hubby and I are both Chesapeake Bay born, we are pretty picky about our crabcakes. These were some of the best I have had--lump crabmeat all the way! Our server brought over 2 bottles of homemade hot sauce, made by their bartender. It was a nice compliment to the meaty and sweet crab meat. For our entrees, my hubby had the filet while I selected the duck with a mango glaze. We must have been so excited about ordering our food that we missed the part when our server let us know our meals came with homemade ravioli! Chef Dwight makes this as well. It was a marcona almond ravioli, which was unexpected but an extremely surprising delight! Our entrees were generous in size. In fact, I brought a half of my half duck \u00a0home. The duck was rich and the sweet mango glaze was to my liking. Hubby's steak was prepared perfectly. Both our entrees came with a mix of seasonal veggies.Before I forget, the wine list was great. It wasn't a book in its size, but the selections were made by someone who really appreciates wine.The dessert selections were probably the least impressive of the meal. However the blackberry tort that we ordered was a pleasant way to end the evening.On our way out, we saw Chef Dwight, cooking away in the small kitchen.

There were two ER docs in our group. They immediately started CPR. My girlfriends and I all held hands and started praying. What does Dwight's staff do? 1. They never asked if they could help. We yelled for them to call 911. 2. They told us we were disturbing their other guests. One of the other guests was visibly upset by what was going on. 3.Once our friend finally left in the ambulance...the server (I use that term loosely) asked me who was going to pay the bill.

Not once did they say hope all would be ok. not once did anyone ever call to find out what happened (they had our credit card info it wouldn't have been difficult to find us).Our friend died that night.

I was glad to know that this wasn't the norm since the table behind me had \"Chuck\" who was amazing. They have a very homey written menu with items that change.I started with the Escargot which was excellent. I selected a nice glass of Pinto Noir to go with it and it was very good.

The presentation on the pimento toast was totally on point..We munched happily on those while deciding what to order for our entrees..She went with the crispy fish po boy and although it was good, she said there just wasnt much fish in it, and she probably wouldnt order that again..i had the scallops and grits..it was really good..i was told by the server to go with the whole portion rather than the half, and im glad i did..there was a nice amount of creamy cheesy grits and 6 scallops with green onions on top for a bit of a different flavor and crunch..overall it was amazing..somehow after having my leftovers boxed for me, we decided we had room for desert and i ordered the skillet cookie with salted caramal ice cream and she got a coconut cake..she thought her cake didnt have enough coconut..my skillet cookie and house made ice cream were the perfect end to this meal! we will def be back for a happy hour, the whole place is gorgeous and looks to have a nice outdoor area for when its not so hot"], ["Marjie C.", "Decided to have a late dinner date with my boyfriend on a Friday night.The atmosphere was great. Customer service was great. Our server was Devin and he was great with recommendations on what to get from the top popular dishes to his own personal favorite.Drinks: I ordered my boyfriend the Walk Don't Run. I personally didn't like it. I'm not a fan of anything bitter... haha. But he drank it. He's not picky. I ordered the Beez Kneez - with that being said, it has Gin which is my first time having Gin but this drink was so refreshing. It definitely hit me (I'm a lightweight!) Will be ordering it every time I visit.Food: OH EM GEE. My boyfriend ordered the filet mignon, medium temp... oh it was so tender, flavorful. He substituted the blue cheese bread pudding for mac & cheese. The mac & cheese was just enough for him to share with me. I really liked it. It had good flavor but it wasn't all that greasy which I loved. I'm a big mac and cheese lover. I ordered the short rib... again, so tender and flavorful. You just have to try it yourself!Dessert: I actually had room for dessert... and I don't regret it one bit. Boyfriend ordered the warm skillet cookie with vanilla ice cream. How can you go wrong with that? But what definitely made my night was the dessert I ordered: coconut meringue layer cake. Let's just say I want to order a whole entire cake for my birthday in the next 2 months... It was just absolutely perfect.Definitely coming back and trying other recommended dishes to update review."], ["Zach J.", "Can't believe how amazing the food was. Wasn't expecting it! Homemade soda was probably the best part. The moxie burger was probably the best burger I've ever had for sure. This place to me is original and that is what makes it delicious to me."], ["Emily S.", "Went here for our anniversary and everything was excellent! Service was especially friendly and the atmosphere felt like something you might find in an upscale lumberjack fantasy... in a good way. \u00a0We had the fortune of sitting in a large booth facing the open kitchen, where we were able to see endless streams of perfectly plated deliciousness. Their take on chicken and waffles was perfect and the scallops were a delight as well. Definitely would come again & highly recommend ."], ["Leslie B.", "After coming to Moxie over a dozen times and participating in their brunch for dinner birthday celebration last night, I have to change to review to a solid five stars! Although I still can't leave this place without spending $100 for me and my husband, they do have a regular and late night happy hour which is nice for the wallet!It's a very inventive menu which I originally thought was too inventive for picky eaters like my father, but he recently went and loved everything he ate! And I just have to mention the decor, the upstairs bar area and the booths to the open kitchen, it's just a fun hip place to be!Congrats on your successful first year Chef Tom!"], ["Angela Y.", "Scallops live up to their name. Drinks were delicious and stronger than they taste. Service was slow though. Don't expect to be anywhere if eating here. Great place to eat, drink, and hang out with some friends."], ["Daija P.", "Maybe we made the mistake of coming here on Valentines Day. No, it wasn't busy and we had a reservation so that wasnt the problem. The issue was that, being that it was Valentines and they had a specific Valentines themed menu, why not make it so that there is a more intimate environment? That was our only gripe. I will say that the staff is awesome! They even took our picture outside after dinner because I wanted to capture the moment haha. Now lets get down to what we ate! For appetizers we got the chicken livers. My bf loves chicken livers and they were a hit for him. This was my first time eating them and I must say, it was actually really good! They came covered in shreds of celery and dribbles of hot sauce. I ordered a cocktail (the name escapes me, but it was one of their popular cocktails. I remember I had 2 or 3, so it was a hit for sure lol) We both also had a wedge salad, not bad and for my main meal I had their pasta which consisted of tasso ham, tomatoes and some kind of sauce...not bad. I enjoyed it. And my bf had their scallop dish which was really rich. As for dessert, we ordered their skillet cookie with ice cream on top which was also really good. Overall we had a decent time. If we go back, it will definatly be for cocktails and chicken livers! I say give it a try. My stars are mainly based on the lack of intimacy for Valentines."], ["Steve C.", "Marnie the biz partner and I followed Tony here after a sales call at Brown Fertility nearby.It was a great experience, here's why: * Jai Alai IPA $4 each* My Short Rib dish was AMAZING! $25* Happy Hour Vodka $5.50 * Winter Salad $5 * Meat Loaf $5 * Seared Scallops $26* Add Shrimp $6* Bruce was our fine serverCheck it, Cabeza OUT!"], ["Sharon S.", "Due to a power outage at the Town Center, a group of us ended up at Moxie for burgers. \u00a0Our group was quite hungry, but decided we would suck it up and deal with the 30 minute wait time. \u00a0While we waited, a few of us decided to indulge in a cocktail. \u00a0I purchased the Walk Don't Run and it was pretty good. \u00a0After what seemed more like an hour, we were finally seated by the hostess. Since this was our Burger of the Month outing, we were all pretty much set on burgers. I decided on the Moxie burger with american cheese and bacon. \u00a0The burger really was quite tasty and included fries. \u00a0Yes it was tasty, however, I do not believe it was $15.00 tasty.I'm glad I finally got a chance to check out Moxie, but I won't rush back. If it had not been for the wonderful conversation and laughs, the wait would have made for an unpleasant experience. I understand the wait to be seated, but the wait for the food was way too long. \u00a0We arrived at this establishment shortly before 8:00 p.m. and left after 10:00 p.m. I've seen previous reviews commenting on the wait time and hope management will seek to correct the problem sooner than later. \u00a0Finally, they may want to consider including bacon as an option to their $14.00 Moxie burger rather than charging the additional $1.00."], ["Deprina G.", "I had an awesome experience when i first came here. The host could tell of ripp that i was looking for a plug and sat us in a both with a plug. Everyone was so nice. we were waiting for a friend to meet us and they didn't rush us with ordering. The waiter even took our picture for us and we dif appreciated it and left good tips. I had the Chicken and waffles. I swear I still dream of that maple whip cream tll this day!!!! its is served with a bread pudding made from waffle I mean this made my belly smile. I was already planning another visit before I finished my plate. after a certain time only half the store is open on a sunday night you can avoid all crowds"], ["Ryan H.", "I have not had the food here yet just a few drinks in their upstairs space. It's clean and trendy, but a little cramped especially if it gets busy. Service isn't or wasn't bad when I was there despite the bar crawl that was going on and it being shoulder to shoulder. I have to reserve this for another time when I can get a chance to actually try a meal there. Otherwise so far it's decent, but I think the prices here might be a bit inflated."], ["Susan H.", "The 1st time I ate here I was disappointed. I was so excited to try the chicken & waffles, and it wasn't what I was expecting or wanting at all. This time I went for dinner (last time was lunch) I stayed away from the chicken & waffles (maybe I'll be prepared enough to try it again next time!) we had the fried cheese curds for an appetizer (good by not great...what you expect for fried cheese) and I ordered the hand made gnocchi. It comes with braised oxtail, creamed leeks, roasted mushrooms & truffle oil- all things I love. It was amazing! The gnocchi was perfectly dense, and the braised oxtail gave it this perfect, salty broth. The creamed leeks offset some of the saltiness just enough, the mushrooms gave the dish some extra depth...and it is my personal belief that there can never be enough truffle oil. Perfect.And to make a delicious meal even better, I had my new favorite cocktail! I recently fell in love w/ the gin from the *relatively new* St. Augustine Distillery. At the suggestion of our server, I ordered a hand made soda (Moxi Crush- vanilla, orange & cilantro) w/ the St. Augustine Gin. It was fantastic...the flavors seemed to blend together perfectly. Loved it.I'm actually on my way back today. My husband wanted to go after he heard me raving about it...maybe I'll give the chicken & waffles another try :)"], ["Lilly C.", "I've eaten at Moxie several times. They have pork rinds that they make fresh in house. I've tried the pig legs which taste like chewy chicken. They have excellent cocktails with bars upstairs and downstairs. They have a great chicken & waffles. The burger is large, juicy and very flavorful. It's an eclectic menu with some interesting choices. Anything you choose with be delicious be prepared to be adventurous. They have an upstairs outdoor area that is great for drinks or dinner. The upstairs bar area is a great place to meet friends for a drink."], ["R. Thornton L.", "Overall, not a bad experience. I had been there before and thought the food was pretty good. This time it was more mixed. Kale with ham hock was excellent. Service was very good. \u00a0My guests's burger was cold, but French fries hot. Not really a made to order burger I'd say. Meatloaf was very good. Fried cauliflower was excellent - should be offered on its own!Great beer selection. Excellent wine selection. I really like the outdoor seating. If the burger had been hot, I would have given one more star."], ["Samantha P.", "The best \"from farm to table\" restaurant in JAX in my opinion. Stellar customer service, lovely set up and super fantastic private booths! Love, love, love Moxie Kitchen And Cocktails!!"], ["Toni B.", "The modern design of the exterior is really what made us decide to stop in here. After having dinner my boyfriend and I know we're going to be regulars. Our waiter was clearly new but absolutely wonderful, he was prompt, kind, and was able to give us information about the food. We ordered the PBR battered cheese curds, pig ear, and chicken livers for an appetizer, each one was amazing. The cheese curds were lightly fried and had a delicious \"beer\"taste. They came with the same sauce as the pig ears which I would liken to a much more easily edible crackling. The chicken livers were fried and dressed with a buffalo sauce, ranch, and shaved celery. We devoured every bit of it! For entrees I had the pork schnitzel which I cannot eve enough about, slightly needed and tender, it came with a 'redneck' risotto and homemade chow chow. Now I'm from the south, and I can honestly say this was the BEST chow chow I've ever had. The combination of all three really made this a savory and sour dish. My boyfriend had a burger which he added blue cheese and an edge that just would not be quiet about! Said it was one of the best burgers he's ever had. I also ordered a side of collards with ham hocks, again southern girl here, and devoured it. My boyfriend cannot stand dark greens and is basically allergic to the word 'kale' but we were fighting over these collards! For dessert we had a peanut butter mousse with chocolate exterior, soft peanut and chocolate crust drizzled with caramel and a side of br\u00fbl\u00e9e bananas. The mousse was perfect, just a hint of a peanut butter taste with an amazing creaminess. This place was amazing, the atmosphere, staff, and food really couldn't get any better."], ["Jordan C.", "We were just here for drinks at the outdoor/upstairs bar. The venue was beautiful and modern."]], "The Brick Restaurant": [["Tiffany H.", "Hands down one of the best restaurants in Jacksonville. No doubt.I've been to The Brick for brunch and for lunch, and each time seems better than the last. The eggs benedict is a meal I swoon over in my head even weeks and months after the experience. They have several variations -- a tomato-mozz, spinach feta, etc. I love choices and variety so this in itself makes me extremely happy. The bloody mary's and mimosas are spot on. They do several different omelets and other brunch dishes that you'll be talking about for days.For lunch, they have a lot of excellent salads, the best (in my opinion) being the kale with grilled salmon. I don't know what they do to their kale, but I have never before or since had kale that was so tender, flavorful, and pleasant to eat. People and their bad kale jokes, be damned! Come to The Brick and see why kale is one of the best leafy greens you can get. The salmon is super delish and always cooked to perfection. Be prepared for a decent check, but it's truly not as expensive as it could be for what you get. A fantastic meal, very classy ambiance. If you're feeling underdressed, sit outside! Get in some people-watching on St. John's Ave, where you'll see hipsters and Ralph Lauren polos alike. If you've never been to The Brick.....do it now!!!"], ["Ouida P.", "I don't have anything but great things to say about this place. The food was delicious, the ambiance beautiful, and the service spot on. On our first trip, my hubby and I had the shrimp and grits and the prime rib sandwich. Both were delicious but nothing tops the shrimp and grits. Within a week, we were back arguing over who would get to order the shrimp and grits. The appetizer is the better deal and you should definitely get your shrimp blackened. We tried the larger portion and shrimp made a different way...we realized quickly, we needed to heed the advice of our first server. There's something about the flavor fusion with the portion size that just polished the equation of the dish. Don't get me wrong, the prime rib sandwich was very flavorful and certainly worth consideration. I think hubby had a sandwich on another trip as well. All DELISH. For me though, the signature (for now) is the s&g. There was also live music on one of the nights we went. I can't remember which night because I was probably s&g wasted by the time they started to perform. Nutshell: A great casual date night spot for grown folks craving...wait for it...shrimp and grits!"], ["Marie L.", "We love this restaurant; it never fails us. The service is always great and the food is not only delicious but consistent. They have the best Ginger Mojitos and best of all, they serve real food in until midnight on the weekend. We like the Caprese and the Poke Salad. The salmon (both types) is wonderful and the scallops are awesome. It does get really busy during peak dinner hours but they serve pretty quickly and move people out as long as they aren't campers. Although they turn over tables quickly, you never feel rushed.This is one of our favorite restaurants. Oh yeah, the patio is ultra dog friendly."], ["Linda B.", "This is our 2nd try here, just in case they having a bad day or something... The food just isn't that great here. Honey got \u00a0huevos rancheros and I ordered smoked salmon Benedict. The best thing I can say about my dish was that the poached egg was good. The sauce was very dense and thick, the English muffin was hard in spots, but didn't absorb the egg or the sauce. The salmon was very scarce, but that was ok since it was so fishy tasting. I order fruit as a side, instead of potatoes or grits. The service is still not great either. We saw the server to order, then waited more than 30 minutes for our food to be delivered, then she showed up afterwards to refill the drinks. There was no lack of staff. I do have to say the place was much cleaner and less dusty than the last time we were here. We were there at 3pm and the place was almost empty. I'm pretty sure we won't be back for visit #3."], ["Lab L.", "In town for a professional conference and a local recommended checking out the options in the Avondale section. The Brick was highly recommended. Great service. Great food. Highly recommend the crab cake appetizer (including a surprisingly delicious slaw), calamari, and the special flatbread with mushrooms and caramelized onions. My friends had a steak and the salmon salad. Both were very pleased with their entrees, too."], ["Lora H.", "We were in the mood for some late morning breakfast and had remembered a friend of ours who said that this restaurant had a great brunch service. \u00a0So off we went. \u00a0We were greeted with smiles that morning, and perused the menu to see what they had that was something unique that we probably could not have found elsewhere. \u00a0Needless to say we were not disappointed. \u00a0This place has a great brunch menu and I had to narrow my choices down to one of the Benedict offerings that they had. \u00a0(My plan is to go back and try the other one that was on my eenie-meenie-minee-mo list). \u00a0I ended up going with the smoked salmon Benedict and I was not disappointed. \u00a0The eggs were done perfectly, even to the point that I could have, if I had wanted to, rolled the yolk out of the egg on to my plate. \u00a0That may sound strange, but to me that is exactly how the egg was supposed to be cooked. \u00a0I licked my plate clean and wish I had another piece of bread to clean the plate even more. \u00a0It was a perfect helping and a perfect choice."], ["Morgan H.", "I personally think The Brick is great (however a tad bit overpriced). We stopped by here for brunch opting to sit outside since it was so pretty out. I selected the Biscuits & Gravy and it was delicious and a huge serving. I had no trouble finishing it all though :) I also had a mimosa (and bought one for a friend)....bill total $16 (for a breakfast dish that consists of 2 biscuits with gravy and 2 mimosas I think that's a little much). I will be back however b/c the service is good. And they have an awesome turkey sandwich on their menu."], ["Janna T.", "Awesome menu packed with unusual items like Kale salad with maple glazed Salmon, Baseball cut Hawaiian Sirloin and Prime rib poblano pepper quesadillas. Good happy hour pricing and Wednesday is ladies nite all nite long."], ["Elizabeth M.", "I gotta say that I wasn't wildly impressed with this place. The food was good, and pretty but nothing I would rave about. Our party got a few things so we could share and try out the variety but nothing really stood out. We got some calamari that was extremely chewy, so chewy that I felt like I was pulling a fruit chew away from my mouth. It was also fried a bit to long that it was very dark. When we mentioned it to the server he just said that its always like that, needless to say we sent it back and got the baked Brie. The Brie was pretty good. Came with fresh fruit and bread but again, nothing to rave about. We all had coffee and seriously we could not \u00a0figure out for the life of us why our server would not fill up our cups. He would fill it 2 thirds of the way and it got a bit on our nerves but we didn't complain because maybe its policy or some thing. The one thing that really did stand out were the grits. They were really good. Perfect flavor and consistency. The French toast was also pretty good but again nothing memorable or amazing. The variety of eggs Benedict was good and the food was good but I don't know, something just didn't rub me the right way about the service. Maybe I'll go back and give them a try again."], ["Jean L.", "Great place for breakfast. \u00a0This was my first time here and I plan on returning."], ["Chris G.", "Excellent service. Caesar salad was good, grilled mahi sandwich was very good."], ["John M.", "My margarita, lobster spring rolls, scallops, asparagus, wine, and bread pudding were great! \u00a0I even enjoyed the water.I, however, disliked the service that I received at Brick. \u00a0After arriving, I waited 20 minutes before a waiter came to my table. \u00a0It was annoying to watch half a dozen waiters walk past my table with no word of when someone might help me. \u00a0This needs to be fixed because good service is the reason why I do not mind spending a little more for a nice meal. \u00a0You can have good food, but it doesn't mean anything if you mistreat your patrons."], ["Justin N.", "Delicious food, amazing staff, and a great setting/environment. I will return. Has brunch consisting of juevos rancheros and home fries. Also had the Champaign mojito."], ["Morgan F.", "We have really enjoyed every experience we've had here. We have never had to wait too long for a table, and the service is efficient. We have tried multiple items on the menu and enjoyed them all. In the evenings some nights there is live music, which is nice. You can sit inside or outside. I would recommend this restaurant!"], ["Peter Y.", "A last minute decision to try this cool place turned out to be a winner. The service was exceptional but the ginger seared sea scallops were simply over the top good. We had a large party of guests and we spent much of our time with the, \"Oh you have to try this\"! Talk. Personally I really liked the quintet band they had. So much nicer than just another guitar band. Well done in every aspect."], ["Katy S.", "Hey brunch, hey!I'm a brunch freak and was happy to get a chance to sample the Brick during brunch time. \u00a0I love the set up of this restaurant with the beautiful brick wall. \u00a0Located in the heart of Avondale, this place is a visual delight.Based on Yelp photos I ordered the French Onion Soup which was absolutely perfect. \u00a0So cheesy and delicious on a cool Saturday. \u00a0I also hit up the Caesar Salad (also yummy) and washed it down with a Peach Bellini.Everyone at the table liked their meal. \u00a0My spouse got the Beef Carpaccio and really enjoyed it. \u00a0The dinner menu looked a bit expensive, but would be a great date night spot. \u00a0Very good experience!"], ["Jeff A.", "Brick continues to be one of my favorite restaurants in the area. I have been coming here for over 3 years and it is consistently fantastic. I love sitting outside on the patio in the evening. They never rush you so you can take your time and enjoy your meal and your drinks. It is a very casual but upscale environment. Our server Allison was great, we had such a good time there last night!"], ["Andrea J.", "I've always heard many great things about Brick - a hidden gem in Avondale. As a first time diner, I can definitely say that I was pleased. The restaurant itself is tucked away in cozy landscape accented with decorative lights and ambiance to match. If you know anything about the Riverside/Avondale area, you're aware that each store, shop, or restaurant has its own individual, yet unique, style. All of the menus differ in the area, offing items that cater to any palate. Brick's menu offers a variety of selections ranging from seafood to steak and chicken. I know that I am usually the hardest one to please in a crowd when it comes to restaurant choices, but when I looked at the menu at Brick, I was able to pick out multiple options that I knew I wanted to try. I started with the shrimp and grits appetizer which DID NOT disappoint. The grits were perfectly creamy, and the 5 jumbo shrimp were succulent. As our attentive server explained the appetizer portion, she described it as being enough for two people (it was) and mentioned that it had bacon and butter drizzle on top. The bacon was requested to be on the side, however when the bill arrived, there was a $2 charge for bacon. No big deal in the end, but it was something that sounded as if it were the slandered when ordering the appetizer, not as something added on. For the entree I ordered the maple glazed salmon with a jumbo baked potato - highly recommended!! The salmon was smoked, sweet but not too sweet, and was all-around delicious. My only thought was that the plate could use a little more garnish or greenery. The garnish provided on the plate was a tomato slice. I'm not a fan of tomatoes so I skipped on it, but if the taste of the rest of the meal was any indication of the tomato was, I'm sure it was amazing. The restaurant also offers live music. I'm not sure when this takes place. I dined on a Sunday evening and nobody was there performing. I'd love an opportunity to return and have the full \"Brick Experience\". As far as service goes, all of the waitstaff was highly attentive. Beverages were refreshed without having to chase someone down, food arrived in a timely manner, and management was on the floor conversing with guests as they entered and exited. This is certainly a restaurant that has won over a new loyal guest."], ["Cari B.", "The Brink is one of my go to restaurants for a casual dinner lunch or brunch . The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable bout the menu . All in all the food is really good . My last visit I was in the area for brunch and at the last minute had to change up where we had planned to eat and ended up at the Brick . I've had dinner/lunch several times and always been pleases with the experience but this was my first time here for brunch . Like all my other visits I was disappointed . I'm a french toast junky so I had to try that also ordered a side of bacon and cheese grits that wasn't listed on the menu but they gladly made for me . The french toast was delicious thick slices of Texas toast like bread with a side marinated strawberries and syrup . Simple yet amazing . The bacon was the perfect thickness and nice and crisp . The cheese grits fabulous , I want to say were the highlight of the meal but I don't want to down play anything else . Also had a strawberry Bellini which was to die for . After the meal I was quite honestly glad my other plans had fallen through and I got a chance to sample the brunch here . It's nice to have a neighborhood restaurant that's not just a one treat pony ."], ["James H.", "Ehh it's okay. Nothing special. Drinks took way too long and the food was not as listed. Crab cake didn't come with onion as told and the server forgot the sides. Home fries a bit cold. The poached eggs were way over cooked (they should be runny in the center). A lot of potential. Just needs better execution and attention to the basics."]]}
