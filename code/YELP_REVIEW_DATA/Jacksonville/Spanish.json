I was told 6 mins for a fresh batch. I also ordered a baked cheese bread since that was going to be done around the same time. I ate the bread as soon as it came out of the oven and it was very good. Interior was gooey with cheese. Wished I had ordered more than 1. Ate the empanadas at home. The beef and potatoe filling was seasoned to perfection and crust was nice and crispy. Went well with the green hot sauce that you have to ask for. The one sweet item I ordered had cream cheese filling. I wasn't a fan, had a strong dairy smell and cream cheese wasn't sweet enough.

I ordered especial, \u00a0my hubby tried to order something else, \u00a0they just looked at him and said \"especial? \" lol.... I told him you're getting the special..... They don't speak much English in here and menu in Spanish, \u00a0hopefully someone in there can help translate.

Around 3:30pm on a Friday. I knew many of the pastries would likely be gone, just having read some of the Yelp reviews. I had two distinctly opposite reactions to the menu being entirely in Spanish. The menu was on the wall only, so if someone was behind you, and you can't speak a lick of Spanish, it can feel a bit unnerving. I ordered the only two things I recognized and sat down. I had read about the empanadas and the cheese bread. So that is what I ordered. I felt the flare of frustration in trying to read the menu. I felt like they could probably make more money if all the customers could read the menu. On the other hand, not speaking Spanish forced me out of my comfort zone. I struck up a conversation with a lady who was there with her two teenage kids ; she was friendly and helpful. She even translated for me when the owner came over to discuss my satisfaction. This is a good thing... interacting and depending on the kindness of others. The individual cheese bread was very good. I did order a full family sized loaf to go, but it had a different texture from the smaller \"puffs\". I much preferred the individual cheese breads. The empanadas were fried just right, with a crispy exterior and a melt in your mouth potato and beef filling. I was not expecting this filling, as all empanadas I have eaten in the past were made with ground beef (my gringo side talking here probably). Still, its what I'm used too and I missed it. The sauce that came with them was spicy, but not too spicy and fragrant with cilantro. The perfect accompaniment. Sadly, I thought that it came with the cheese breads too, but it did not :(All in all I really enjoyed it and plan on bringing the family for a breakfast one day. I hear they are off the chain."], ["Elizabeth M.", "I can in here with the hubby on his birthday just to get some Colombian pastries to go with our boba. I don't know why but I felt a little awkward walking in, maybe it was the way the lady at the counter was just staring at me or the fact that as we tried to walk in we had to walk \u00a0around the bar stool that was in the way of the front door. Next step were the bakery item, they looked delicious!! We got two cheese pastries, two guayaba and cheese and then one that was just guayaba. We also got a bu\u00f1uelo, and two beef and cheese empanadas. All in all we paid a little under $12 for all those goodies and that is an awesome price in my book!Now the taste test, the empanadas were delicious!! Although the inside was more of a beef and cheese mash, not what I had expected but good none the less. The cheese pastry was good too it could use a little more cheese but it was good nome the less. It was soft and chewy and I think my sugar crystals kinda melted with the florida humidity because it was almost like a sweet syrup glaze in the outside of my pastries. The bu\u00f1uelo I was not so hot for. I asked what it was and she said it had cheese inside, now I can overlook the fact it had no cheese but let's just say it didn't get eaten while the rest was devoured.

I settled on some empanadas, which were filled with meat and had a thin and crispy crust, very close to the ones I recently had in NY so I was super excited about them and for the price I definitely was not complaining.I suppose if my areapa craving does not go away soon I will wake up extra early to stop in during breakfast and get them while they're hot!"], ["Ernesto M.", "Excellent empamadas colombianas.

Being half Colombian and half German, I was given the German looking genes so I certainly don't look Hispanic. Nonetheless, right when I walked in they greeted me in Spanish which was a lovely touch. Their empanada were fresh and warm, the pandebono were cheesy and moist, perfect for dipping in your coffee. We got here around 8:30am when they opened, on a Sunday, and I thought \"man, this place is like a little tienda in Bogota!\" It was little and quiet and quick. However, around 9am, after that 8am mass, all the Colombians start rolling in. this place is meant for about 20 people sitting and there was definitely a lot more than that filing in.

The service was just okay..the place is teeny tiny small and they tend to run out of pandeyuca on the weekends but they say you can call in an order. That's nice but when I'm craving I'm craving and I want it now!! Best is to come just as soon as they open when the baked goods are hot and fresh. On another visit I had the ajiaco and it was excellent. I love that they serve the chicken separate from the soup because I am vegetarian but I will still have this soup and just not eat the chicken. I don't eat chicken but I don't mind chicken juice and it's what really makes this soup authentic. I will be coming back often."], ["Eryn S.", "I highly suggest trying everything on the menu.

I got the turkey dinner sandwich and it was seriously good. The turkey slices I got were big, thick juicy slices of turkey. They were seriously as thick as my thumb! The mashed potatoes were creamy and it had the right amount of stuffing! The cranberry sauce was on the bottom of the bread and some on top too which added just the right amount of sweetness. My husband got the skirt steak sandwhich with peppers, onions and mushrooms and cheese which was really good too. For both these sandwiches the bread was toasted.My grandpa got the chicken salad sandwich and he said it had the perfect amount of chicken and that the dressing was really good too. My grandmother got the fruit and nut salad which was also really good too. The portion will really blow you away so make sure you can eat a lot of salad before getting the larger one.

The main dish I ordered was the ahi de gallina, it was described as a yellow creamy nutty sauce on the menu. I have no idea what the flavor was that they were going for but it wasn't my favorite. It should have been served in a bowl, very hot, on top of a lot of rice. Instead, it was slopped on a plate with a scoop of rice barely enough to slop up half the sauce they put on the plate. There were two random pieces of boiled potato, a random hard boiled egg, and one very out-of-place olive. It certainly wasn't the worst thing I have eaten but not even close to the best. They could have made it spicy and sweet and it would have improved the dish tremendously. I also ordered some sweet plantains, it's pretty hard to mess those up.

The veal and short rib meatball was good, but not spectacular and the scallop, which was baked in a puff pastry with pate was very unique in its preparation and even better on the palate. I had the pork chop with a bacon jelly on top which was tender and juicy to the bone. The brussel sprouts were lightly fried and the kale with onions was cooked well but the truffle fries were the worst of the sides that we tried.But, forget the fries, the real issue was that it took about 45 minutes for our main courses to arrive after we'd finished our appetizers. The chef came to the table to apologize, which was a nice gesture and she offered desserts on the house. The waiter then came out to bring a round of celebratory drink and strawberry sorbet for us and he tipped the tray and spilled the beverages all over the table and onto our clothes and purses. Sigh, it was a bit of a disaster. Everyone in the restaurant turned to look at us.I'm guessing that since most people love Matthew's, our experience was an anomaly. While the food was definitely excellent, it was the other issues that forced me to dock a few stars."], ["Joe C.", "A high quality, upscale eclectic italo-french restaurant that impressed my clients, and me. \u00a0The menu is filled with unique, creative dishes, and is not presenting \"standards.\" \u00a0There is a pasta section with 5 selections, and I actually had the most conventional of them all, a bolognese radiatore (though they were out of radiatore) though I gave their bolognese only a 3.5/5, It was serviceable and tasty. \u00a0I was intrieged by the Bucatini with vegetables and lemon zest, but was just in the mood for a sugo. \u00a0Their desserts expressed the same aesthetic as the rest of the menu, I had a Souffle with elderflower liquer in the souffle batter and a blueberry sauce. \u00a0It was perfectly executed and the flavors were very well matched.The wine list was extensive and on Monday nights, half price!. \u00a0Now that works for me. \u00a0We had a Gundlach Bunchau Cab (the last one), another Alexander Valley cab and cali chard which I don't remember!The owner, Matthew helped me out a few weeks afterwards when I needed a copy of the recipt. \u00a0He was courteous and a pleasure to speak with. \u00a0I would unhesitaingly recommend this restaurant to anyone interested in an upscale dining experience in Jacksonville."], ["Malik B.", "Amazing food and waiter had excellent knowledge of wines.

We agonized over the menu choices, but Brian helped us make our final decisions. The escargots in a cream sauce with shallots, mushrooms and spinach was divine. The pork belly was perfect, seared off and served with a sweet potato pur\u00e9e, a cardamom vanilla syrup and huckleberries. It was magic, the best bite of the night. We ordered the loup de mer (bronzino, a flaky sea bass) and the wild boar. Also fantastic. For dessert, we had a pumpkin souffl\u00e9 with a creme anglaise sauce. The wine list is extensive. The second night we had a party of 24. We had a prix fix menu. Highlights were the salmon crudo, curried butternut squash soup, the scallops, the beef tenderloin, the pumpkin semifredo and the flourless chocolate torte. Everyone loved the food.Service is attentive and the food is delicious.

Rebecca and her desserts have set a beautiful stadard"], ["Don R.", "We have been regulars at Matthews for the past year. \u00a0Our last visit was completely unacceptable and Matthews simply does not seem to care about their customers. \u00a0Upon arrival we found no valet. \u00a0Our server had to be prompted several times to share the details of the chef's tasting menu. \u00a0Of course, the server did not memorize it and had to read it off from a cheat sheet. \u00a0The menu here is pretty stagnant from the viewpoint of being a regular customer. \u00a0Even though the menu barely changes, they were out of 2 items from their menu early in the evening (6pm). \u00a0I ordered the \"sushi grade Ahi tuna\" cooked rare. \u00a0It was so incredibly full of sinew that I could not cut through it with the sharp steak knife they provided. \u00a0I did return the Ahi and ordered the ribeye, cooked medium rare, which took 20 minutes to come out of the kitchen (long after my spouse had finished eating). \u00a0My ribeye was mostly medium rare except it was completely burned (not seared) on one side...so much so that I actually was able to cut the completely burned layer off and leave it on my plate. \u00a0The beverage service was inattentive, and the quality of check backs by the server was poor. \u00a0A manager, nor anyone from the kitchen, took the time to both verify the complaint about the tune and visit our table to apologize. \u00a0And clearly, no one was watching for quality control over my ribeye. \u00a0Most of the other items were plated sloppily as well. \u00a0I've tried contacting Matthews, but I can't get anyone to answer the phone during the time I am calling and I'm usually too busy during the evening. I would send them a message through their facebook page, but my message months ago never received a reply. \u00a0I can no longer recommend Matthews due to poor service, food and management.OLD REVIEW: I have to say that the food was absolutely 5 star, but there were some things lacking based on the targeted demographic. \u00a0First, it was absolutely frigid in the restaurant during our visit. \u00a0With entrees in excess of $50, I expect to sit in comfort while dining. \u00a0Second, the attentiveness of the service was spotty. \u00a0Our server was very professional, and appropriately friendly, but we had already eaten our appetizer before being offered a beverage, and a request for another piece of bread was forgotten and then still not offered to any other guests when finally brought to the table. \u00a0Still, the food was absolutely stellar, but we will not return when the temperature outside is cool and will request an attentive server (which is not an appropriate thing to have to ask at a fine dining restaurant).UPDATE: \u00a0We have been an additional 2 times since the first review. \u00a0They are very consistent in my assessment that the kitchen needs to taste food for seasoning prior to sending it out to customers. \u00a0We now know to ask for salt, but some dishes are literally perfect, whereas others are simply sans salt from the kitchen. \u00a0Of course, salt is critical to bringing out the flavors in most foods...so you be the judge.I'm also happy to report that the service was better on our 2nd and 3rd visit. \u00a0Ironically we have been seated at the same exact table on all of our visits, regardless of our request for a booth, and the temperature has been an issue during all visits.Another thing that stood out is that on both our most recent visits, the servers had to read the chef's tasting menu off from a cheat sheet. \u00a0This is a 4 Diamond restaurant, and reading specials off from a cheat sheet is something I don't expect to see.Finally, another thing I think shows a lack of care at this grade of restaurant, or any restaurant for that matter, is when they are out of menu items. \u00a0They were out of 2 menu items when we went the last time, and normally at this type of restaurant the menus for the small dining room would simply be reprinted to exclude the missing items so as not to disappoint customers.We have tried visiting this place on the spur of the moment, but beware that they are often closed for special events and they do not seem to update their hours with anyone, including their own facebook page."], ["Lizzy C.", "My husband & I chose Matthews for our annual Christmas date, as we were planning on seeing a play in nearby San Marco square after dinner/drinks. Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by a beautiful ambience. There was white, modern furniture, bright lighting & a beautiful bar with the different liquors show cased. Immediately, we knew this place was classy.We decided to sit at the bar & take part in happy hour, which is 5-7pm daily, with $5 select wines & $7 martinis. I chose the petit syrah (which was poured very generously), while my husband chose Duke Brown Ale, a Jacksonville home-brew. For food, we started with the cheese plate. Not really sure exactly the types of cheese on the plate but it seemed like a gorgonzola, brie, sharp cheddar & brie. This platter was a piece of art & came with crostini, candied nuts, a date, some grapes. \u00a0Following the cheese plate, we chose seared beef tips over country grits & buffalo calamari with blue cheese dipping sauce. The beef tips were cooked to a perfect medium & were so juicy. The calamari was spicy, but not over powering. My husband says \"this is the best calamari I've ever had\". Appetizers were priced reasonably ($6-$10) & the service was outstanding. Would definitely return. Also, for all of you Jaguar season ticket holders, there is a teal deal for Matthews...$20 off purchase of $50!"], ["Nicole W.", "Almost did not come to Matthew's because of some negative reviews.

Probably the best food we've ever had at a restaurant. The use of herbs and spices was elegant - powerful flavors laced delicately but not subtly with the main ingredients gave a learning experience as well as an incredibly delicious meal. We were overwhelmed with service, not only waited on by two people hand and foot, but informed by them at our every whim, answering our questions about the recipes as well as about the fresh ingredients. We ordered two salads, both wonderful, but the one made of fennel root at a major ingredient was not even close to anything we've ever had.

The only downside, while not THAT important: the basil was pretty wilted; Scallops Mondragon $13 (panko-encrusted scallops on a bed of creamy roasted poblano pepper sauce) - fabulous also; Almondegas de Carneiro $12 (lamb meatballs served with Spanish blue cheese sauce) - a little on the dry side, but extremely flavorful. \u00a0The plate should probably been dressed a little better as it was just brown meatballs in a white sauce - no color, very drab; Snapper a la Dulcinea $28 (snapper filet topped with saut\u00e9ed shrimp, lemon, butter, kalamata olives and caper sauce) - this was a very pleasant surprise in that it was cooked perfectly. \u00a0I'm always a little nervous about ordering a thinner fish in restaurants because they can be overcooked very easily. \u00a0This was not!Since there was a little mix-up about whose table we were, we waited a little longer to order than we cared, but the owner caught it and asked the waiter to make sure we received complimentary desserts. \u00a0Very nice, but hardly necessary if you review our selections above! \u00a0Either way, our waiter didn't ask what we'd like (we'd have said \"thanks, but no thanks!\") and just plopped a flan down in the middle of the table with two spoons. \u00a0Nothing heinous, but it stood out to me as someone who had spent over 20 years in the B&B/restaurant/catering/bar business.None of the little hiccups would stop me from recommending La Mancha to everyone! \u00a0I hope the owners/chef are fabulously successful and that Fernandina has welcomed them with open arms!"], ["Chris C.", "It doesn't look like much from the outside but it's decorated very cute and the food is really good. \u00a0I had a Caprese and fried goat cheese salad which was great.

We were sat outside which was fine because that's what the group wanted but the lighting outside could be better. We basically depended on the light of the nearby street lamp. The server tried to be funny and while some of the women who are older than me thought it was cute or funny, to some of us it came off as rude. Especially when my co worker asked to be skipped during the entree ordering and he responded with a \"it will be my pleasure\". Maybe it's just me but to me that sounds rude. We started off with drinks and I initially ordered the sailors cider. It was very sweet and it just did not suit me. My coworker went ahead and told our server that I wanted to swap out my drink because I didn't think it was good. She also told him that someone at the table was willing to drink it instead of throwing it away in case he wanted to be nice enough to leave it. Well he left it and then decided to charge me for it. I understand that he had every right to charge me for it because someone else did drink it but in my defense I asked him to take it back even after he had made a recommendation to me. While he did take it off the bill when I questioned him about it he only did so after making me feel like some cheap skate trying to pull a fast one on him. The food: we had the hangar steak which was absolutely delicious. Steak was cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes were delicious as well. The pollo feliz was not a very happy chicken. The dish itself is poorly presented. The chicken was cooked perfectly \u00a0and it was all on top of a soupy mess of fingerling potatoes. It would have been fine but because the chicken was cooked perfectly it became the fall off the bone juicy kind of chicken, which led to lots of little bones being all in the dish. Taste was there but poor execution on how it should be presented, and possible choking hazards with the poor lighting. The s'mores were served cold. Awful and I didn't enjoy them at all. The best thing I had was the limoncello bread pudding. If I happen to go back it would be for that.

Ovinte has nailed the atmosphere: I know I will be back to enjoy some Sangria with friends while sitting on those couches.- Herb Truffle fries were delicious- Pitchers of sangria, mimosas, etc. livened up the drink menuCons:- We came as a group of four on Sunday at 11:30 and there was no wait (very empty at the time). We had a reservation, and asked to be seated at a circular booth that was supposed to seat six - the hostess said no, and we were smushed at a small square table. The circular booths remained empty the entire morning.- Asked for mustard on the side, and it didn't happen- Food was a little underwhelming in terms of flavor: concepts were great, wild mushrooms delicious, but could have benefitted from more flavors.Overall, I would definitely be back at Ovinte for tapas/drinks, but might not come again for brunch."], ["Pamela D.", "One of my favorite places to unwind after a good pay day...

You can sit with your friends or a fun date drinking wine, sharing small bites and talking the night away; you will feel like you just happen to have waiters/waitresses at home.

I met a group of friends here and we were hoping for a larger group to come out that that didn't happen. Due to our small party, we decided to sit in the lounge area, which is open seating. It was a little difficult to hear what everyone was saying due to being right by the bar but we made the best of it. I ordered a glass of Moscato and decided to start off with one appetizer and one small plate. Both came out at the same time, the bacon-wrapped dates and the lamb meatballs. OMG the dates were delicious! I should've taken bites from the toothpicked bacon dates but I stuck the whole thing in my mouth not thinking that they would be so stuffed with Mahon cheese. It was still go either way. I did wish I had more than three though. I originally thought the lamb meatballs were kinda plain in the sauce but the goat cheese packed a lot of flavor and eating it with the meatball made up for it. It was very good. Still kinda hungry, I ordered the Shrimp and Grits. Mannnnn those grits were bangin'! There called Anson Mills stone-ground grits. The Mayport shrimp were so good too. Almost forgetting about dessert and still on my second glass of Moscato, I asked about the Chocolate Roulette. Apparently they are little chocolate truffles all with different flavors based on the chef's choice. I picked it out of curiosity and I didn't get steered wrong. One was a little spicy, one was made of coconut, and the other from espresso. Delicious and simple. My other dining companions had Carciofo (crispy asparagus) which was a big hit as she kept saying \"Oh My God\" after each bite, grilled seasonal vegetables (very good), chorizo al vino tinto (tasty), tres leches cake (ok, but dry towards the center), and the limoncello brioche bread pudding (dear goodness that was heaven sent!!!)If I come back, I'd like to go for brunch or maybe even sit outside on the patio if it's nice. It was just too noisy for me in there."], ["Ryan H.", "This place rocks.

The ingredients are fresh, the concept is creative and their execution is on point.

The decor is very chic and the lounge offers a very modern, comfortable atmosphere. The 50/50 sliders (sweet yet savory) & truffle fries are delicious!

(Drink Recommendations: Fountain of Youth) The live music on Sunday's creates a relaxing ambience (Easy listening, Blues-esque music)!

The decor is modern and comfortable with a large lounge area. A small parking lot meant I took advantage of the complimentary valet.My dinner date and I chose the patio since it was a nice evening and they have heaters outside. We were in a bubbly mood and enjoyed a glass of prosecco. \u00a0We started with the cheese plate and chose the manchego, aged gouda, and bellatoir. The plate came with local honey, grapes, Marconi almonds and toasted baguette. I died and went to cheese plate heaven. Maybe it just filled a massive craving, but damn, was it good. The bellatoir, a soft French cheese, was the winner of the evening.We then moved on to sharing bacon wrapped dates, crab cakes, and chorizo empanadas. I love dates and these didn't disappoint. The crab cakes were very good with little filler and the empanadas were crispy without being overly greasy. \u00a0For dessert, we had the homemade s'mores with a generous dusting of sea salt on top.

I highly recommend this place for people who enjoy non-traditional brunch options, as it has several latin-inspired and latin-fusion brunch options. Although it doesn't apply to me, I appreciate the vegetarian and gluten-free options available on the menu. I had my first Michelada, here. *GUSHING* it's basically a bloody mary made with beer instead. it makes for a fine libation when you add a little hot sauce to it. yummayyy. Some of the brunch options are also tapas style, so you may have to order more than one item to satiate your appetite. As with other tapas restaurants, I recommend going with 3 or more ppl to maximize the experience. We ordered the tamale and the salmon plate. The tamale will definitely not fill you up. The salmon platter is great for sharing. It was served on a wooden board with capers, red onions, peppers, eggs, and bread. I liked the presentation of the foods. The ambience is great. It's quite contemporary, but inviting. In the center of the restaurant are sofas for dining and groups. There is also outdoor seating. I would definitely come back to enjoy the tapas during the evening. This would be a great place for gno."], ["Martha G.", "I love wine, hence I love Ovinte...it's that simple. However, since I wouldn't be a true Yelper without a longer review here I go. So why Ovinte? Well, first of all the wine selection is amazing. From their by the glass or half bottle selection of wines, to their \"Wine Emotion Cards\" where you preload them with $25 and you can sample as many wines as your card takes you from their wine emotion machine. \u00a0Its a lovely contraption that I would love to have at home, basically is like beer on tap, except its bottles of wine and all it takes is your little \"wine emotion card\" to serve yourself.Anyway, besides the wine, Ovite has a full bar for non-wine drinkers and great tapas selection so that you don't end up all liquored up. :-) \u00a0I expecially love their Cheese / Charcuterie plate, the crab cakes, and the\" Chorizo al Vino Tinto\" which is slice \u00a0spanish chorizo (sausage) served with grilled bread...yumm.In addition to the wine, and great food. \u00a0The atmosphere inside and outside is very relaxing and makes a nice stop after work, after a hard day shopping at the mall, or just as a good excuse to hang out with friends."], ["Diane A.", "Had tapas last night for dinner after work and became a fan of Ovinte at the St. John's towncenter. A good crowd was in for happy hour on a Monday. We had dinner consisting of tapas - truffle fries, seared scallops, shrimp, grilled bread slices, and ceviche. All the tapas were cooked perfectly and well prepared. We ended our evening with Limoncello bread pudding just to reminisce our Italian honeymoon & the constant indulging in limoncello. The ice cream on top of the bread pudding was a slight lemon flavor but not typical \"limoncello\" flavor that Italy is famous for. Service was great and we were greeted by the host staff and server.

Seriously who hired her? She belongs in the back washing dishes. With that being said I haven't gone back here and I even unfollowed them on Instagram. They lost two customers for sure.

Very excited to see one of my favorite waiters from Orsay would be waiting on us.We started with an order of the Herbed Truffle Fries to snack on while we perused the rest of the menu. I ordered the Heirloom Tomato Salad special. It was a stack of gorgeous tomatoes topped with a goat cheese fritter. It was delicious. The tomatoes were dressed just right and the goat cheese added just the right amount of richness and tang. For our next course, I ordered the shrimp & grits and my dining partner had the seared scallops special. My plate was good, but I can't say it was amazing. It wasn't at all bad, I just think unfortunately I have a very high bar for making a serious impression when it comes to shrimp & grits because I've had it almost everywhere in Jacksonville. I tasted a bite of one of her scallops, they were seared perfectly and melted like butter on your tongue. As they should.For dessert we had an order of the s'mores and the limoncello bread pudding. Both were delicious and I've finally come to appreciate bread pudding as a part of my life. Didn't like it as a kid, but love it now. I would order the bread pudding again if I was sharing, but if I just wanted a little sweet treat to wrap up my meal, the s'mores are the way to go.Can't wait to take my husband back.

We all know that Town Center parking can be a pain in the ass, but they offer complimentary valet, which is great. No driving around in circles and fighting with folks for a spot. Nice touch. Certainly a bit swanky on the inside, but I didn't feel it to be in a pretentious way. It's smaller than I would have thought from the outside, but plenty of seating, couches, tables and the patio has the same seating offering outside as well. There were 9 of us that met around 7 pm on a Saturday night and we were lucky enough to score one of the couch areas outside.... an upscale South Beach feel with the dark wicker, cozy cushions and huge umbrellas. Our server was excellent and hilarious, even when he walked into some crazy conversations we were having! He did a fantastic job of going through the menu, explaining the different wines to the group and was just an all around enjoyable guy. My boyfriend and I started with a cheese and charcuterie plate... we really wanted a broad range so went with seven options, four cheeses and three meats. The group ordered quite a few different things, including the sliders, truffle fries, pork skewers, clams, and probably a few I am forgetting. :) Cheese and charcuterie was great.... the boy loved the prosciutto and the platter also had spiced almonds and a honeycomb. \u00a0Everything was great and the possibilities for different flavors and varieties made for a great experience. Our friends enjoyed a few bottles of wine, and me being a beer girl for life, was pleased with the selection of craft beers. I also really dug the music that was playing: downbeat, dreamy electronic that sounded just like my favorite Pandora station. Very laid back, hip and chill. We were still a bit hungry after the platter. After taking in the scene and enjoying the company for about two hours, everyone ordered the s'mores for dessert and a few espressos. The s'mores were simple, but amazing. Just two grahams filled with marshmallow, with one side dipped in chocolate with a bit of sea salt sprinkled on top. Soooooo good in the melt in your mouth kinda way. There was no talking for about five minutes. :) The sliders our friends ordered looked incredible so we ordered them to go. Topped with saut\u00e9ed onion and cheese, these little guys were cooked perfectly, and still had pink in the center. A lot of sliders I've had elsewhere can be a bit on the smaller side and overcooked, but wow, these were excellent. Overall, the food was on point, maybe a tad pricy for the smaller portions, but the vibe of Ovinte offered a lot to the experience.

I hate that I missed the yelp outing but have been eyeballing this place since before it opened. The hubs and I tried the pick three charcuterie plate, then the bacon wrapped dates, the prosciutto wrapped artichoke hearts, the truffle herbed fries, and the chorizo cooked in red wine and herbs. \u00a0 The place has a swank decor, and is very \"hipster\" but not too classy to pop in wearing nice jeans loved it.the space was bright and open, very modern, and had cool plush chairs and couches to sit and chill besides tables and booths. \u00a0The drink glasses are a bit small, but the portion of food for them to be considered tapas is perfect! \u00a0The bill for the two of us to share 5 plates was just about $45 \u00a0not including a tip. I truly find this reasonable. Service was quick, friendly and totally hospitable. I'd say all in all this chef has completely changed my mind about chorizo! I've always had it crumbled, greasy and not very flavorful in most Mexican preparations. This soaked in wine was the most flavorful I've ever had! I sopped up the bread in the wine after the meat was gone. Absolutely delish. \u00a0Another high point were the bacon wrapped dates! Almost warm and candy like. The bacon was a welcomed hint of saltiness. \u00a0I have already planned to go back for my anniversary in September, so I can't wait!! I'm also super pumped to try a place similar to this one in Vegas in December called Jaleo. More reviews coming soon."], ["Tim C.", "Our recent visit to Ovinte exceeded our highest expectations. From the valet service at the door, to the menu, to the amazing wine list of by the glass and bottle, to quality ingredients and perfect presentation, start to finish was an awesome experience. While the entire service staff seemed to be spot on, our server, Carlo was the best. Ask for him when you book a table, you'll not be disappointed. We tend to compare dining experiences against our many years living in Napa Valley and enjoying constant 4-5 star dining. Ovinte easily matches up to many spots out there and surpasses quite a few of them in the total package. Eager to return and enjoy the outdoor patio, rain kept us inside this visit. Kudos to the entire team, it is very obvious that Ovinte is well managed."], ["Kevin P.", "Ovinte, \u00a0was a last minute option, however, \u00a0after dinning here this will be my first choice when I visit Jacksonville again.The food is great, \u00a0the service was impeccable."], ["Leighton D.", "2.5 starsMy wife and I went here while at SJTC, I want to recommend this place, honest I do, but I had one BIG issue. Because of that issue, I wanted to wait a few days to see if my reflection of the issue waned of if it grew... Unfortunately, it grew. So here is the review. The good. The food was great! Great presentation and flavor. The portions are a bit small, even for Tapas, with many of the tapas being 3-5 bites as opposed to 5-7 bites as with most other restaurants. Also, expect to pay about $1-3 more for a similar item that you would normally get elsewhere. Enter in the $15 ($14.50) shot of Don Julio? REALLY? I could understand if it was the \"70\" but regular Anejo, where at most places it is between $9-12? I guess you are really paying for the atmosphere... Which was really nice.Beautiful layout, designed for groups or smaller gatherings. Great patio, and I was impressed to see that you could have your pet on the patio, which goes back to SJTC being one of the most pet friendly areas that I have been to in the state. The inside and outside are ideal for intimate and upscale social gatherings. A nice place to meet for drinks after a day at the office. And Office attire is pretty much what you would want to be in most of the time when you visit. So why the 2 star review? The first impression. When we came in through the doors, the greeter looked at us and said, \"Can I help you?\" Not, \"Welcome to Ovinte, will you be joining us this evening?\" or any other variation of the standard greeter greeting, but in a tone as if we were LOST! REALLY?!?!?! As if to say \"Wendy's is across the street.\" While my wife was dressed a little more casual than I was, we were no where close to the folks that were there in shorts and flip flops, so I don't think that was the issue. And I really don't think any racial component played at all, so the only thing I can think of, is that the greeter was in a serious need of an emergency colorectal surgery to remove whatever object that found its way in to make her attitude so \"Sh***y.\" That first impression will be a lasting impression. The plus side of it was that our server was A++ Awesome! Portia actually made us feel welcomed and have us considering coming back. The other servers seemed to be pretty chill as well. Given that this is a place where you can EASILY drop $75 for a light meal for two, and probably go well in excess of $200 if you made an evening of it, I feel that the experience given should be top notch. Frankly, it wasn't. So that puts me in the position of whether to recommend or not recommend. If friends are wanting to go, I will have no problem going, but for NOW, I would rather go to Cap Grille if I am going to spend that kind of money, and get the outstanding service and experience that I would expect. Tip: MUST TRY THE BREAD PUDDING!!!ps. If/when I do go back, I will update this review accordingly."], ["Anthony N.", "This place was always on my list of spots to hit up. It definitely is a great spot and veers away from cookie cutter restaurants at the Town Center area. It was a first date evening and my date loved it. We started with tapas (crab cakes & bacon wrapped dates). Both were really good & season well. Crab Cakes came with a Romesco sauce. It really didn't even need it b/c the Crab Cake was so good. We had the braised lamb shank & Filet Mignon. The filet came out cooked perfectly & the lamb was nice and moist. I like the plating, instead of big massive plates. They came out in sizes that compliment the food. I am a chef, so I am very picky about places to eat at. I will definitely be hitting Ovinte up again. Might even make it my go to spot."], ["Anne P.", "This is a really attractive spot! \u00a0We ate on the patio, which was great considering we had a mellow after-the-storm type evening.As with any tapas place, if you go ravenous you could rack up a hefty charge, but the serving sizes are in line with this kind of place and the prices aren't bad. I really enjoyed my foam-enhanced mushroom risotto, very flavorful. There is a good selection of wines by the \u00a0glass and half-bottle and the full wine list looks quite extensive. \u00a0Our server was very attentive. Dishes were brought out by separate food runners, which \u00a0probably helps efficiency.My only real caveat: the seating areas near the bar inside could make conversation a challenge: everyone was super civilized but the conversation volume was up there."], ["Vetey D.", "Love the different decor and atmosphere!

They were pretty busy for lunch on Saturday. We waited around a little for Tue table. Tue staff was very friendly. Small lunch menu perfect for small little place. I had eggplant lasagna. It was very oily. I'm not unhappy with it but probably won't order the same thing but would like to try other things. A lot of fresh veggies. Corn soup was delicious!

The interior of this corner spot is inviting, with unique photos of their desserts displayed on the walls. I did notice that the indoor tables and chairs seemed to be made out of plastic, which for me didn't seem to fit the food or the overall atmosphere for dinner.We were immediately greeted by a very friendly man who I discovered was one of the owners of the place. He gave great recommendations and we started with their sangria. The sangria alone is worth a visit-I had to have two of them, it was so delicious. We were given some bread and olive oil to dip it in, which was also filling and very tasty. We already knew we wanted the paella, and were recommended the tapas sampler platter to go with it. We ordered that as well, to get a taste of all of the tapas they offered. The sampler came with a handful of olives, cheese slices, shrimp, crustinis, a garbanzo bean soup, chorizo slices and the best meatballs I have ever had. I am probably missing something else, but there were quite a few options. The paella came out quickly and wasn't like any paella I have had before. It almost looked like risotto with squid and mussels mixed in. I have to say, it was delicious. I would have ordered the mussels tapas on their own if I had known how good they would be.For dessert, we ordered the strawberry cake (all desserts are handmade in-house by the wife, we were told). It was very rich, full of strawberries, and the portion size was so large we had to get a to-go box for it. The service was extremely friendly. The husband and wife team came by our table quite often and It felt like we were at home or among friends. I absolutely loved the vibe and could tell the owners take a lot of pride in their business. They really should be, it was a lovely experience and I am looking forward to returning soon!"], ["Tiffany I.", "We really, really wanted to like their dinner but it was not good.

The bakery items are decent but eh, not worth it."], ["Lael M.", "Love, love, love this place!!! We were greeted by such a friendly hostess. As first timers, my friends and I weren't sure what to expect but I'd say expectations were exceeded tremendously. The place is set amongst the chill hipster vibe that comes with the 5 points area. Our friendly and vibrant hostess greeted us with charisma and lots of advice and information on their selection. I was most appreciative of her demeanor and it made the visit that much more enjoyable. Between the three of us we shared the Marquesa, Pavlova, and the Carrot Cake. All of them were definitely delicious! I'd come back to this place in a heartbeat. You should totally check them out."], ["GT W.", "Nice local gem in Avondale/Riverside part of Jacksonville.

We had wrapped up dinner and were craving a sweet nightcap for the evening. It was hard to decide what to get as each option sounded more intriguing than the last. I went with the Chocolate Marquesa. Multiple layers of almond & chocolate deliciousness. It was a large slice of cake, but so light and airy. A perfect end to the evening. My husband went with their namesake - the Tres Leches. It was quite a large portion and would have been more than enough for the two of us to share. Tres Leches is a great little corner place in a great little neighborhood. Jacksonville should be proud."], ["Julie A.", "If you are a fan of meringue and desserts, then you are missing out if you haven't stopped in. I am in love with their chocolate marquesa cake. Namely because it is the only thing in Jacksonville that comes close to eating pavlova with the softness and the textures. (And I dream about pavlova everyday...)Tres Leches has come a long way. The first time I discovered them, they were only available during artwalk. I always made sure to grab a few meringues to bring home. Then a few months after that, I found out they had a tiny store front and I stopped in to get some sweet treats and savory offerings. Finally, in their current location they have much more room and a broader menu. I stopped in last year for the Yelp event, and I was impressed with their sandwiches and sangrias. They have weekend brunches which are a bit more than what I'd like to pay but still a tasty treat. I took my son here for Mothers Day since they were open later than other brunches around town. \u00a0We definitely picked the best place. They offered a nice variety including a dish called cachapas and pulled pork (cachapas are similar to arepas), crabcakes, several other dishes, as well as more traditional brunch comfort eats like pancakes and french toast.The creole crabcakes were delicious and satisfying, especially with the remolade sauce and mild kick of heat. Along with the main hot dish, brunchers can help themselves to the fruits, pastries, and grits."], ["William E.", "Found this place on a meandering road trip. Jacksonville, at least to a tourist, seems dead asleep on a Sunday, so didn't have any great expectations. I was pleasantly surprised. My cachapas were a great mixture of sweet and savory. My wife's crab cakes were a little small, but full of flavor. My favorite though, the grits bar. Perfectly done grits with the toppings you want. Not sure if this is a thing but more restaurants should do this (just ask tres leches how to cook the grits). Reasonably priced and the staff was truly delightful. I would definitely seek it out again."], ["Marie F.", "If someone gives me a tres leche cake I will love you forever. And the best Tres Leches cake has that pool of milk at the bottom.

Once I sat down at the table our waiter brought us a plate of scallop tartare and steak tartare. He told us it was on the house because I helped out one of their employees and they wanted to show their appreciation. I thought that was very kind of them to do that and it really made me look good on my date ;-) It work out for them too because the steak tartare was absolutely delicious and I ordered it every time I went thereafter. \u00a0 \u00a0 The Truffle Mac and Cheese is a must order. It is to die for. I usually frown upon restaurants trying to do fancy macaroni and cheese but Orsay's is no joke. Definitely indulge in a few of their signature cocktails. They also do a Sunday brunch that is incredible. They have a quiche dish that is different every week based on whatever it is the chef feels like making that day. Needless to say every week it's more delicious than the week before."], ["Suave G.", "Great food Brian is a great server.Very fine use of words when describing food. Not many servers in this industry that understand food like him."], ["Maya C.", "Another wonderful time at Orsay! We were up Park Street at the River City Pride Parade and couldn't resist the urge for appetizer's and cocktails until we got over to our side of town. Traffic cleared up and streets were unblocked and we were on our way. Both parking lots, Orsay's and the one next door, were pretty full but we were able to find a spot. We knew it would be busy when we saw people sitting at the outside tables. Inside was hopping for dinner. We were hoping to get a table in our favorite waiter's section but there was no tables left at the time, only seats at the bar. We were fine with that since we weren't having a full dinner. The bar area was very clean and the bartenders were very attentive. My friend and both ordered French Pear Martinis, a restaurant favorite apparently. This drink is delish and goes well with anything. We ordered a few apps: oysters, mussels, steak tartare, and marinated calamari. I hadn't had oysters in a long time so I kinda forgotten what they tasted like. At the very first bite, it all came back to me. I LOVE oysters! These oysters tasted like they just came out of the ocean. They were so fresh and ocean-salty, I almost wanted to order more. The steak tartare was good but different. It didn't occur to me that it was raw beef when my friend ordered it and I agreed I would share it with her. I ate it anyway because Orsay can do no wrong in my eyes. Everything mixed in with with made it delicious. The mussels are good as well. The broth that the were cooked in made for a good dipping sauce \u00a0for our complimentary bread. The marinated calamari was fantastic! I always get this when I come here. This has to be the best calamari in Jacksonville. We initially didn't want dessert but let's be honest, it's Orsay! I got the Blueberries and cream and it was soooo creamy and decadent. My friend had the Banana Bread Pudding and she loved it. I had a taste of it and I was very good. It was still busy when we left so we didn't get a chance to say bye to our favorite waiter, but we knew he'd see us again."], ["Ellen K.", "This restaurant has a great atmosphere and amazing food. \u00a0We took my parents here while they were visiting us for the weekend and we thoroughly enjoyed our experience. \u00a0The raw oysters were fresh and shucked perfectly, the escargot appetizer was sublime. \u00a0Megan was our server and she was wonderful. \u00a0She gave spot on recommendations and was very knowledgeable on their wine and cocktails.This is definitely one of my new favorite places to go in JAX."], ["Terri B.", "Exceptional food. Great drinks. Good service. James beard 2015 semi-finalist. Definitely warranted this type of accolade. Highly recommend the lobster pot pie.....based on my fellow diner \"sopping\" the gravy out of the bowl with what was left of biscuit. Our group enjoyed numerous appetizers including the trois foie mousse, however the mousse was over salted. The other appetizers including the olives and the saut\u00e9ed calamari were extraordinary. Table entrees included the Orsay meatloaf, the stroganoff and the fish (flounder) special. The meatloaf should definitely be labeled as a comfort food with a slight twist/use of duck and liver.....an absolute delight. Drinks varied from old fashions to more contemporary libations, however the beer list was broad but shallow. We ended the meal with the dessert tower which proved to be underwhelming hence the 4 stars. Overall - I would recommend this restaurant all day!"], ["Matt R.", "Very good meal. A great selection of alcohol and wine. I would recommend asking the bartender to take it easy with the ice."], ["Stephen M.", "I have been here several times. It is consistently a great experience.

We ordered cocktails and a bottle of Chianti. \u00a0Decided on a combo of meat and cheeses. \u00a0I ordered the mushroom bisque soup, it had a creamy and velvety smooth texture and earthy delicious taste. My date ordered the French onion soup, he said it was great, it was extremely rich and full of flavor. Our entr\u00e9e was delayed so our waiter offered an appetizer while we waited, we ordered the sea scallops and the waiter recommended the steak tartar. \u00a0The steak tartar was my favorite. So flavorful yet light, wonderful texture, I highly recommend. My entr\u00e9e was the filet mignon, perfect crust and perfectly cooked medium rare. \u00a0Was so tender you could cut it with a spoon. My date ordered the lobster pot pie which he devoured. \u00a0The mushrooms were amazing in the dish. I was a little too full to have a real bite, but somehow we saved just enough room for desert and espresso. We ordered the cr\u00e8me brulee, which had the perfect hard crust on top. It was creamy and flecked with vanilla bean seeds. I thoroughly enjoyed our night at Orsay and we will definitely return soon. No doubt one of the best restaurants in Jax."], ["Anna H.", "I learned about Restaurant Orsay several years ago while stuffing myself some of the best sushi ever. I was talking with the owner of Sushi Pop in Oviedo Fl. \u00a0and told him I was visiting and lived in Jax. Thats when I learned about Orsay. \u00a0As soon as I returned, I was there and have been a regular ever since. \u00a0 I thought finally a restaurant in Jacksonville that will shake up the true foodies of the city. \u00a0Well it's only gotten better. \u00a0Yesterday was my first brunch experience but will not be my last. \u00a0Starter; French Pear Martini, or two. \u00a0Let's get to the food; \u00a0Three dollar Deviled Eggs perfect presentation tasty yolk and just the perfect tip of crisp asparagus. \u00a0 I am not a fan of truffle oil but the acid cut the usual chemical taste I always experience. \u00a0Next I moved to the Lobster Mac & Cheese \u00a0now I have tried this on every menu I seen here in town and make my own but this was a beautiful dish full of bite sized pieces of lobster and a sweet combination of Parmesan Reggiano & Gruyere. \u00a0I ordered the small portion but by the time my companions tasted it there was nearly not enough left. \u00a0Lesson: \u00a0never share! \u00a0Next the Duck Confit Hash. \u00a0I have only had Duck Confit in France but the moment I put the meat in my mouth the memories came flooding back. The fingering potatoes were browned to perfection and succulent with the duck fat. \u00a0 OMG did I say Duck Fat. \u00a0I had to order another Martini to quell the rush.. \u00a0Well realizing \u00a0 I am already into Augusts calories I should go ahead and have desert; \u00a0Chocolate Guinness Mousse Cake.. \u00a0Marvelous presentation the mousse had just the correct amount of tart/sweet, light and airy combined with the slight \u00a0tartness of the cherries made this a perfect choice.I have to also give Daniel 5 Stars. \u00a0He was so attentive, \u00a0funny, knowledgeable about the menu. \u00a0I can't rember a time when there has been better servive. \u00a0Thank you Daniel!!!!"], ["Anthony S.", "What is NOT to love about this restaurant. In my opinion, the best in Jacksonville and would be tops in most any other city, big or small.

The staff is so down to earth, and polite they make you feel like you're part of a family when your there. Well maybe its just me or the drinks that make me feel that way, because the drinks here are second to none. They are creative, ridiculously good, and I can never have less than three of them, because they are just that good. Food wise, I've had the olive and cheese tray every time I go, it's a must. And I know it's known to be a steak place but everything I get is over the top with flavor, always cooked to perfection. If I had to sum up all of my experiences here with one word, it would be perfection. Spent multiple New Years here, each time better then the last. Will be going back. Now I had to think long and hard to a downside. Couldn't come up with one. Then it hit me. The location and parking. It's a bit out of the way, not really in any majorly trafficked part of town like the town center, or the beaches. It's also not downtown or in riverside. More like on the outskirts of Avondale. At the same time that also adds to its hidden gem feel and persona. However the parking leaves a bit to be desired, and the empty gym next door where most patrons are forced to park has little or no lighting. Makes me happy I have my concealed \u00a0carry when I have to walk through that empty, dark parking lot late at night. Overall I love this place and am always talking it up.

Off the main street."]], "The Brick Restaurant": [["Tiffany H.", "Hands down one of the best restaurants in Jacksonville. No doubt.I've been to The Brick for brunch and for lunch, and each time seems better than the last. The eggs benedict is a meal I swoon over in my head even weeks and months after the experience. They have several variations -- a tomato-mozz, spinach feta, etc. I love choices and variety so this in itself makes me extremely happy. The bloody mary's and mimosas are spot on. They do several different omelets and other brunch dishes that you'll be talking about for days.For lunch, they have a lot of excellent salads, the best (in my opinion) being the kale with grilled salmon. I don't know what they do to their kale, but I have never before or since had kale that was so tender, flavorful, and pleasant to eat. People and their bad kale jokes, be damned! Come to The Brick and see why kale is one of the best leafy greens you can get. The salmon is super delish and always cooked to perfection. Be prepared for a decent check, but it's truly not as expensive as it could be for what you get. A fantastic meal, very classy ambiance. If you're feeling underdressed, sit outside! Get in some people-watching on St. John's Ave, where you'll see hipsters and Ralph Lauren polos alike. If you've never been to The Brick.....do it now!!!"], ["Ouida P.", "I don't have anything but great things to say about this place. The food was delicious, the ambiance beautiful, and the service spot on. On our first trip, my hubby and I had the shrimp and grits and the prime rib sandwich. Both were delicious but nothing tops the shrimp and grits. Within a week, we were back arguing over who would get to order the shrimp and grits. The appetizer is the better deal and you should definitely get your shrimp blackened. We tried the larger portion and shrimp made a different way...we realized quickly, we needed to heed the advice of our first server. There's something about the flavor fusion with the portion size that just polished the equation of the dish. Don't get me wrong, the prime rib sandwich was very flavorful and certainly worth consideration. I think hubby had a sandwich on another trip as well. All DELISH. For me though, the signature (for now) is the s&g. There was also live music on one of the nights we went. I can't remember which night because I was probably s&g wasted by the time they started to perform. Nutshell: A great casual date night spot for grown folks craving...wait for it...shrimp and grits!"], ["Marie L.", "We love this restaurant; it never fails us. The service is always great and the food is not only delicious but consistent. They have the best Ginger Mojitos and best of all, they serve real food in until midnight on the weekend. We like the Caprese and the Poke Salad. The salmon (both types) is wonderful and the scallops are awesome. It does get really busy during peak dinner hours but they serve pretty quickly and move people out as long as they aren't campers. Although they turn over tables quickly, you never feel rushed.This is one of our favorite restaurants. Oh yeah, the patio is ultra dog friendly."], ["Linda B.", "This is our 2nd try here, just in case they having a bad day or something... The food just isn't that great here. Honey got \u00a0huevos rancheros and I ordered smoked salmon Benedict. The best thing I can say about my dish was that the poached egg was good. The sauce was very dense and thick, the English muffin was hard in spots, but didn't absorb the egg or the sauce. The salmon was very scarce, but that was ok since it was so fishy tasting. I order fruit as a side, instead of potatoes or grits. The service is still not great either. We saw the server to order, then waited more than 30 minutes for our food to be delivered, then she showed up afterwards to refill the drinks. There was no lack of staff. I do have to say the place was much cleaner and less dusty than the last time we were here. We were there at 3pm and the place was almost empty. I'm pretty sure we won't be back for visit #3."], ["Lab L.", "In town for a professional conference and a local recommended checking out the options in the Avondale section.

My friends had a steak and the salmon salad. Both were very pleased with their entrees, too."], ["Lora H.", "We were in the mood for some late morning breakfast and had remembered a friend of ours who said that this restaurant had a great brunch service. \u00a0So off we went. \u00a0We were greeted with smiles that morning, and perused the menu to see what they had that was something unique that we probably could not have found elsewhere. \u00a0Needless to say we were not disappointed. \u00a0This place has a great brunch menu and I had to narrow my choices down to one of the Benedict offerings that they had. \u00a0(My plan is to go back and try the other one that was on my eenie-meenie-minee-mo list). \u00a0I ended up going with the smoked salmon Benedict and I was not disappointed. \u00a0The eggs were done perfectly, even to the point that I could have, if I had wanted to, rolled the yolk out of the egg on to my plate. \u00a0That may sound strange, but to me that is exactly how the egg was supposed to be cooked. \u00a0I licked my plate clean and wish I had another piece of bread to clean the plate even more. \u00a0It was a perfect helping and a perfect choice."], ["Morgan H.", "I personally think The Brick is great (however a tad bit overpriced).

The food was good, and pretty but nothing I would rave about. Our party got a few things so we could share and try out the variety but nothing really stood out. We got some calamari that was extremely chewy, so chewy that I felt like I was pulling a fruit chew away from my mouth. It was also fried a bit to long that it was very dark. When we mentioned it to the server he just said that its always like that, needless to say we sent it back and got the baked Brie. The Brie was pretty good. Came with fresh fruit and bread but again, nothing to rave about. We all had coffee and seriously we could not \u00a0figure out for the life of us why our server would not fill up our cups. He would fill it 2 thirds of the way and it got a bit on our nerves but we didn't complain because maybe its policy or some thing. The one thing that really did stand out were the grits. They were really good. Perfect flavor and consistency. The French toast was also pretty good but again nothing memorable or amazing. The variety of eggs Benedict was good and the food was good but I don't know, something just didn't rub me the right way about the service. Maybe I'll go back and give them a try again."], ["Jean L.", "Great place for breakfast. \u00a0This was my first time here and I plan on returning."], ["Chris G.", "Excellent service.

I would recommend this restaurant!"], ["Peter Y.", "A last minute decision to try this cool place turned out to be a winner. The service was exceptional but the ginger seared sea scallops were simply over the top good. We had a large party of guests and we spent much of our time with the, \"Oh you have to try this\"! Talk. Personally I really liked the quintet band they had. So much nicer than just another guitar band.

I have been coming here for over 3 years and it is consistently fantastic. I love sitting outside on the patio in the evening. They never rush you so you can take your time and enjoy your meal and your drinks. It is a very casual but upscale environment. Our server Allison was great, we had such a good time there last night!"], ["Andrea J.", "I've always heard many great things about Brick - a hidden gem in Avondale. As a first time diner, I can definitely say that I was pleased. The restaurant itself is tucked away in cozy landscape accented with decorative lights and ambiance to match. If you know anything about the Riverside/Avondale area, you're aware that each store, shop, or restaurant has its own individual, yet unique, style. All of the menus differ in the area, offing items that cater to any palate. Brick's menu offers a variety of selections ranging from seafood to steak and chicken. I know that I am usually the hardest one to please in a crowd when it comes to restaurant choices, but when I looked at the menu at Brick, I was able to pick out multiple options that I knew I wanted to try. I started with the shrimp and grits appetizer which DID NOT disappoint. The grits were perfectly creamy, and the 5 jumbo shrimp were succulent. As our attentive server explained the appetizer portion, she described it as being enough for two people (it was) and mentioned that it had bacon and butter drizzle on top. The bacon was requested to be on the side, however when the bill arrived, there was a $2 charge for bacon. No big deal in the end, but it was something that sounded as if it were the slandered when ordering the appetizer, not as something added on. For the entree I ordered the maple glazed salmon with a jumbo baked potato - highly recommended!! The salmon was smoked, sweet but not too sweet, and was all-around delicious. My only thought was that the plate could use a little more garnish or greenery. The garnish provided on the plate was a tomato slice. I'm not a fan of tomatoes so I skipped on it, but if the taste of the rest of the meal was any indication of the tomato was, I'm sure it was amazing. The restaurant also offers live music. I'm not sure when this takes place. I dined on a Sunday evening and nobody was there performing. I'd love an opportunity to return and have the full \"Brick Experience\". As far as service goes, all of the waitstaff was highly attentive. Beverages were refreshed without having to chase someone down, food arrived in a timely manner, and management was on the floor conversing with guests as they entered and exited. This is certainly a restaurant that has won over a new loyal guest."], ["Cari B.", "The Brink is one of my go to restaurants for a casual dinner lunch or brunch . The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable bout the menu . All in all the food is really good . My last visit I was in the area for brunch and at the last minute had to change up where we had planned to eat and ended up at the Brick . I've had dinner/lunch several times and always been pleases with the experience but this was my first time here for brunch . Like all my other visits I was disappointed . I'm a french toast junky so I had to try that also ordered a side of bacon and cheese grits that wasn't listed on the menu but they gladly made for me . The french toast was delicious thick slices of Texas toast like bread with a side marinated strawberries and syrup . Simple yet amazing . The bacon was the perfect thickness and nice and crisp . The cheese grits fabulous , I want to say were the highlight of the meal but I don't want to down play anything else . Also had a strawberry Bellini which was to die for . After the meal I was quite honestly glad my other plans had fallen through and I got a chance to sample the brunch here . It's nice to have a neighborhood restaurant that's not just a one treat pony ."], ["James H.", "Ehh it's okay. Nothing special. Drinks took way too long and the food was not as listed. Crab cake didn't come with onion as told and the server forgot the sides. Home fries a bit cold. The poached eggs were way over cooked (they should be runny in the center). A lot of potential. Just needs better execution and attention to the basics."], ["Erica J.", "I have been going to this restaurant for year. The food is consistently good. Here are a few of my favorites:1. Crab cakes- one of the best in Jax-lump crab meat with fresh sake and a great aoli sauce2. Shrimp and grits- I prefer mine blackened and served with shredded cheese and bacon. It is served in crispy tortilla shell.3. Prime rib and roasted pablano quesadilla- amazing flavor4. Prime rib- for dinner this is a wonderful option."], ["Matt B.", "I've eaten here many times over the years and the food is very good.The French onion soup may be the best I've ever had. It's that good. I also enjoy there wedge salad with blue cheese. It's been a staple on the menu for as long as I can remember. The service can be a little slow at times but for the most part they are pretty good."], ["Ryan H.", "Decent place to eat and drink or for a date. Great decor and very clean spot in avondale. The food was alright too nothing to complain about and the service was great. I would come back here, but i bounce back and forth between 3 and 4 stars. Need to try more food to give a better review."], ["Daisy D.", "I had been hearing about the Shrimp & Grits at The Brick for some time now, so when I finally had a chance to make it over to Avondale for bite to eat, I knew an order of S&G would be given. As we met our dining partners and placed our drink orders, we ordered two orders of the Shrimp & Grits appetizer. I was told it would be necessary for each couple to have their own. And boy were they correct! The shrimp were plump, the grits were creamy, and the tortilla bowl served as a nice scoop when we broke it up. I could easily order this for a meal and go home a happy camper. Meal was off to a good start so far. For my entree, I had the cuban sandwich with sweet potato fries. The fries were delicious and some of the better ones I've had. The sandwich was good, but I was only able to eat half as I wasn't as hungry as I originally thought. Our server - who's name fails me - was great and played along very well with our usual shenanigans. We find ourselves in the Riverside/Avondale area more & more these days, so we'll definitely have to keep The Brick in our regular rotation."], ["Fred B.", "We really enjoyed The Brick.As opposed to some other reviewers, we were unimpressed with the dining room. \u00a0The openness and brick interior were ok, but the blonde wood and cheap Formica tables are only 1 notch above Applebees. \u00a0The high backed booths were nice, though, because they cut down the noise in a fairly loud room and enabled us to have a very nice conversation during dinner.Service was friendly and attentive.Nice outdoor seating with fans and cooling misters.So... you ask... then why did you give The Brick 4 stars then?!?Well, THE FOOD is damn good. We had a prime rib quesadilla with poblano peppers and queso that was so good I'll crave it.And Shrimp and Grits that, while not the very best I've ever had, was really really good... good enough to order again and again. And the homemade bread pudding was very tasty.For once, kitchen's talent is far better than the attractiveness of the dining room build out. \u00a0If I have to choose, I'll take great food and a slightly lame dining room over lame food in a gorgeous dining room.Well deserving of 4*'s... \u00a0We'll be back, soon."], ["Jay M.", "From an architectural and atmosphere viewpoint, The Brick does a great job injecting modern sophistication into the heritage of this storied neighborhood.The feeling is upscale and warm here, with the edifice's trademark bricks playing against golden woods inside, and the lively sidewalk dining scene along St. Johns Avenue (thanks in large part to this epic haven for dog watching). The colorful bar and live entertainment (Thursday through Saturday nights) solidly bridge the two. It's a neighborhood kind of place where you're bound to run into people you know and like.Simply put, the Brick feels like quality. But does the quality of the food keep pace?The lunch and dinner menus are merged onto a single sheet, where you'll find starters, salads, sandwiches/burgers, more complex entrees, sides and desserts. A dedicated gluten-free menu, a subset of the main menu, is available on request. On the flip side are your wines by the glass (21 at last count), by the bottle and draft and bottled beers (largely devoid of real crafts, but Bold City makes the cut).We began last night's dinner with the Wine Plate ($14), a collection of meats, cheeses, olives (pitted ... thank you!), red grapes and crostini thins that was suitable for picking. The Havarti Dill and Smoked Gouda selections were mild and blended well but, as you might expect from these choices, didn't go the extra mile in the flavor department.My Veggie Burger ($10) was an oversized multigrain patty brimming with standard-issue garnish veggies and a side of chilled couscous salad. Even sliced in two, it was a challenge to tame this beastly faux-burger, but it was a satisfying achievement with the melted provolone the most enjoyable part of this plate. My wife's Kale Salad with Maple Glazed Salmon ($15) was ample, unassuming and ... well ... very green, with what I perceived to be a relatively small plank of glazed salmon anchoring the middle of the plate.My wife's aunt and uncle shared a Rack of Lamb ($28) with side of asparagus. Even split in two, the portion sizes were quite adequate, with no complaints reported regarding flavor or tenderness, just a confident \"very good.\"Beyond last night's visit, my main beef (pardon the pun) with the Brick is that the menu comes across as largely non-offensive, chock-full of standards but nothing that seems willing to stick its neck out for flavor or even name recognition (cue Metro Diner's \"Yo Halla on the Square\"). Flavors are polite, courteous and for the most part homogeneous. To some this might be A-OK comfort food -- you know what to expect and you have a favorite or two. I think there's a better way.On food quality alone, the Brick is in solid 3-star territory. By and large, you get a fair amount of food for your dollar, and the standards are competent and done well. Its intangibles, including atmosphere and sheer location in the heart of the Shoppes of Avondale, earn it an extra star in my playbook."], ["Jack B.", "I am kind of shocked by some of these poor reviews in 2015. The Brick has been an institution in Avondale since 2003. They do have a lot of the same items on the menu since then, but they change and add a few things too. I live a couple of blocks from The Brick and we have seen a lot of good people, managers and staff, come and go from The Brick, over the last 11 years. We have found the food to be consistently good. Its not like eating at Matthew's, but then again, you are not paying for Matthew's either. Try and order off the menu. Want a Bacon, Salmon sandwich, ask for it. Want a burger on a salad, ask for it. The nice thing about the Brick is that they are always willing to do whatever it takes to make your experience a great one. By the looks of the place on a nightly basis, the neighborhood loves them and enjoys the food, music and the community feeling. Every year, they have community events that help raise money for charities, there on Ingleside. It is nice to see a local restaurant that gives back to the community as well."], ["Anthony N.", "After attending the Riverside Art Market I was looking for somewhere to eat with a brunch menu. This idea landed me at Brick (Yelp app). I am big on brunch,well let's say I am big on breakfast. It is a suitable meal throughout the day. So when I get a chance, darn gone it, I take it. The restaurant is very spacious, tall ceilings. Restaurant has plenty of seating inside and out. They have artwork sprawled along the walls. We were seated in the booth in the back. They hand you their regular menu and the brunch menu. Their Saturday Brunch menu is from 10:30am to 3:00pm. After overlooking the menu I decided to pick the Country Omelet. They have more intricate and desirable things on their menu. But, you can judge a good restaurant on how they make eggs. The omelet was very fulfilling. They didn't skimp on the filling of ham, bacon, sausage, and cheese. Along with the omelet I ordered home fries as the side. It was either that or their grits. As you can see for $11 they give a good amount of food. I definitely didn't complain. The omelet along with the home fries were very good. Lots of flavor, a good ratio of filling to egg. Definitely something I would get again, no doubt about it. I definitely want to try more of their brunch menu. The only reason why I didn't give more stars is b/c of the service. (The food was definitely 4 stars). The lady I had bless her heart was really nice and informative of the menu. But once we put in the kids order (which was first), she didn't return until the kids food came out. Which took a little bit over 10 minutes. It's like she put in the order and waited in the kitchen for them to cook the whole meal. She did come and check on us periodically which helped her cause a little bit. I never let the service ruin any good time I may have. It's all about the food for me. It wasn't bad service, just something that could have been done a lot better. Also upon leaving the restaurant I noticed our server was also handling tables outside. To me that was part of the problem. Handling tables outside and tables in the back of the restaurant, to me, isn't the smartest idea. Don't let my story detour you. The restaurant was busy and who knows, they could have been short staffed. There is great eats to be had at The Brick. Sir Anthony will be back!"], ["Rob K.", "Came in the Sunday after the FL/GA game with a huge party (12) and appetite. Service for our large group was great, waters never stayed empty long and the wait for food was reasonable.I got spinach feta Benedict with cheese grits and a memosa muffin.

The rest was good, and the rest of the party seemed to enjoy their food too.Worth visiting."], ["Lori A.", "I had a blast at the Brick. The food was spectacular.

The sandwich didn't look like much since it was only turkey, canalized onions and cheese but let me tell you it was so good. The onions gave it a sweet flavor which made it easy to hide the fact there was no condiments on it. I like my sandwiches to have condiments but in this case it was perfect without them. My co-workers mostly got the burger and salads. The burgers were huge and looked delicious. The salads were of big portions and they too looked really good. I can't wait to try the burger the next time I come back."], ["Katrice S.", "A friend came in town last weekend to celebrate her 30th birthday and \u00a0I was put in charge of the weekend festivities so Friday night I decided we'd go to Brick Restaurant to kick off her birthday celebration! \u00a0 I love Brick because on the weekends there is always live music and the atmosphere is perfect for when you're meeting up with friends! \u00a0This band was awesome! \u00a0We even got them to play a jazzy rendition of the \"Happy Birthday\" song for my friend. \u00a0For starters we got the caesar salad which was amazing!

It makes for an easy choice if deciding where to eat is particularly hard that day. I've taken large groups for here for dinner, worked from the patio during weekdays, and taken the boyfriend and the mom for the Saturday and Sunday brunch. Since we just adopted a pup, we opted to head to The Brick for Sunday brunch yesterday. Plenty of tables available for outside seating, with nice fans to put a little damper on the Florida heat. Our server was awesome; she brought out a water bowl just for our furry baby. Love it. \u00a0The pup was quite a hit... everyone wanted to come and say hello to her... and being the 5 month year old loving pup she is, she wanted to say hello to everyone right back! :) No one minded that she wanted to jump up and kiss everyone... which was a relief since she is still learning her manners.The Habenero Bloody Mary is a must if you are a fan of a drink that bites back. \u00a0Well, not too much bite, maybe just a little love bite. It has a nice kick with the pepper vodka, nice size olive, pepperoncini and stalk of celery. Yes, please! \u00a0Even the boyfriend, who is not a fan of spicy or the Bloody Mary, enjoyed a nice long sip. We ALWAYS start with their shrimp and grits. And we just learned on the last visit you could customize them up a bit (with cheese, bacon and blackened shrimp.) Not that they need it though... and I'll go ahead and say it, they are, without a doubt, my favorite shrimp and grits in town. You would think that they are loaded with cheese, but they are not, they are just that creamy and full of flavor. There are never any left on the plate. \u00a0We did opt for the extras this past visit, but you can't go wrong either way. For brunch, the array of benedicts usually reel me in. I've had the caprese and the spinach and goat cheese (both excellent.) This past Sunday, I tried the smoked salmon: Chilled smoked salmon, cream cheese, capers, diced red onion, and Hollandaise. The cream cheese chilled out the saltiness of the salmon... and the runny yoke drizzling down everything made for a perfect bite. Add some home fries to sop up the rest and sit back, cause you're gonna be stuffed. The boyfriend has been craving my margaritas for a week now, so he ordered the prickly pear... it was a bit salty, but I think that was just due to a bumpy walk to our table, and some of the salt rim got into the drink prematurely. \u00a0It was sweet, with a little tang... I will order one of these on one of my next visits. And if you are headed this way for dinner, I would recommend the seafood tower. Unbelievable presentation and taste to match."], ["Sayaka B.", "well, food was not that good even though presentation was great. it's hard to find the parking,...

For one, the location is so cute!! I love the street it's on in avondale, there are so many shops and restaurants in addition to old historic houses. I also like that they have tables outside on the sidewalk, which gives it a European flair. We had reservations at 4:30 and were seated promptly. I got nervous and thought we might not have a good experience because no waiter ever came to the table and we had been sitting down for almost 10 minutes at this point. But then a super cute and fun girl noticed we were all looking around and asked us if we had been helped yet and if she could get us started. She ended up just taking our table even though we were not in her section and she was just lovely, very personable and sweet. We had some ahi tuna cracker appetizers and a crab cake, both of which were delicious! For my entree I ordered the Hawaiian sirloin which is marinated in teriyaki, soy, orange and ginger. It was cooked perfectly to my liking of medium rare and oh so juicy. The flavors were so prominent, it had to have been marinating for hours. Everyone else also really loved their food, which were other steaks, lamb and a bacon cheeseburger. The only down side really is that it took a while to get our food and they were not very busy. It was fine though, we were just talking and enjoying our family time together. After the meal she offered us coffee on the house which I gladly accepted. My mom got creme brul\u00e9e for dessert (which I tasted) and it was really yummy too. If it were not for Kryshta our visit could have been bad with the way it started, but she took such good care of us!

It is a little pricey in my opinion so not an any ol' day type of place, but a nice place to come."], ["Suz G.", "First impression was Wow, they are really pricey...the atmosphere does not match these prices...then I discovered the food didn't measure up, either. Aside from the linen napkins, everything else was downscale- bare bones decor, a 1-page plastic menu, loud room, and ugly restroom. The staff was average, and did not seem happy to be there. Now, as for the food - disappointed. Seemed like they were trying to pass off a Philly cheese steak as a French dip; it was brown/overcooked meat, not like sliced prime rib, and had provolone cheese. \u00a0My son's chicken with feta and artichokes wasn't bad, a little dry, but not bad. \u00a0I was underwhelmed by the shrimp & grits - thank goodness I got the starter portion (which was plenty) for $17 vs. entree for $30. (TIP: You want good shrimp & grits, go to Black Sheep in Riverside - Amaaazing!).To summarize: Way overpriced for this level of quality and service. If I return, it would be to try other items on the menu like the crab cake or seared tuna. But that's a big If."], ["Janice H.", "Didn't like the food, egg benedict didn't taste well, the waitress was so nervous!! Dissapointed... love better Sweet Pete's Brunch!"], ["Ariel D.", "We were a group of five dining at the Brick.For starter we had the carmelized Brie & bread which was creamy and tasty. For main course I had sesame crusted tuna and garden salad. Both were good but the Tuna was too soft and the sauce on it didn't add any special flavor to the dish. Another thing I would change is putting less sesame on the tuna, it was just too much covered with it. My partner had the roasted salmon which was way too dry and that's bad for a salmon fish ( or any other fish) the asparagus was great and perfectly made, so does the artichokes.Service was very good and professional. I would expect the bar tender to make sure that Next time there is no lipstick marks of the wine glass :-/"], ["Marty C.", "My rack of lamb was to die for.. \u00a0The Kobe burger was supposed to be med rare and it was brought out well. We had to send it back. I finished my meal and the burger still has not showed up. The girl asked if we wanted it to go. No we want to eat it here or we would have ordered our food togo"], ["Amber A.", "Cozy booths, casual bar area, and fun outdoor seating fitting any mood \u00a0 Quality food appealing to all. \u00a0Hearty appetizers: my faves are the stacked tomatoes and mozzarella dish topped with a tasty sauce and the plate with 3 types of hummus. \u00a0 Delicious casual comfort food options like the best warm turkey sandwich with cous cous or fries. \u00a0 If you want something more formal try the scallop dinner or Asian baby back ribs. \u00a0 This place is an Avondale neighborhood staple. \u00a0Best to go during the weeknight early dinner on the weekend."], ["Mark R.", "Always a disappointment. \u00a0It's one of those places you reallllly want to be great; the atmosphere, location, and ambiance are great, but the food......Mediocre - at best; several years running. \u00a0Fix it already!!!"], ["Adrian M.", "Wait time. Not enough to order a drink at the bar. Plus.Service. Our waiter was good but not great. Had to wait a few times for drinksFood. Prime rib was on point kale salad interesting.Would be back. Nice scene in a cool area."], ["Wolf D.", "This is another favorite of mine in Avondale. \u00a0It's a classy place, and the prices reflect that. \u00a0They pour one of the better whiskey sours that I've drunk in Jax so far. \u00a0I have never gotten anything but the french dip sandwich and the calamari, but people I have taken with have gotten steaks, burgers, and salads and were very pleased with them. \u00a0Back to the french dip, it is loaded with meat and served with piping hot au jus. \u00a0The calamari is lightly breaded and fried, but isn't served with marinara, it comes with a house made \"rose sauce.\" \u00a0Not sure what's in it, but it has a zing to it marinara doesn't and I am now a convert. \u00a0They have really nice outdoor seating and you can bring your dog. \u00a0And in the winter they have large gas heaters so you can sit outside year round, which is good for smokers. \u00a0(not me, I quit in 2009) I would definitely recommend this place as good date restaurant. \u00a0Oh and try the flourless gluten free chocolate decadence cake. \u00a0They also have New York style cheese cake. \u00a0Go, try it!"], ["Leah A.", "We went here again on Sunday with my boyfriend & another one of our friends. \u00a0The whole atmosphere here is always super relaxing & inviting. Food-wise, I love their fish tacos because they are delicious, but decided to order the MEDITERRANEAN SALAD this time. \u00a0The salad itself was perfectly dressed, big enough to share & I was very please with the flavors and the amount of fish served with my salad. \u00a0I highly recommend this one! \u00a0The boys both ordered sandwiches--I had a bite of the veggie burger which was a little too \"beany\" for me--I've definitely had better. \u00a0 And I didn't have a bite of our friend's FRENCH DIP AU JUS, but his looked very good. \u00a0I just wasn't in the mood for red meat. \u00a0On a previous visit, I had half of my boyfriend's WARM TURKEY SANDWICH (caramelized onions, Swiss cheese on ciabatta bread and chef's dressing ($10). \u00a0If you are in the mood for something comforting, that sandwich is perfect. \u00a0It is super flavorful & I will probably order that one next time I visit. \u00a0I want to give props to JESSE, our waiter. \u00a0We are sometimes not an easy group (two of us from LA & one from NYC), but Jesse's service was on point! \u00a0Very attentive, but not overkill & he certainly had a great attitude. \u00a0He made our outside patio dining experience a true pleasure. \u00a0I really enjoy patronizing The Brick; however there is always room for improvement. \u00a0If they could: \u00a01) really take their desserts up a notch (more creativity or just go ahead & bring cupcakes in from Sivada's because it would save me a trip). \u00a0I mean I shouldn't feel like I want to walk over to Biscotti's and order dessert there \u00a0AND 2) offer fresh peach nectar or puree for my friend's Bellinis instead of using canned peach particles and peach schnapps. \u00a0Although Jesse served a juice the bartender sent out to compensate, I have to agree that using peach schnapps in Bellinis is pretty lame. \u00a0Check the cocktails served at The Hungry Cat (sunset & vine, hollywood, ca). \u00a0Their unique cocktails are made fresh with hand-pressed juice. \u00a0And it could be so simple since we have all the fresh citrus here in FL & peaches up in GA. \u00a0I know I was all over the place with this review, but overall the Brick's food is consistently very good & I always leave feeling very satisfied."], ["Anna J.", "It's not hard to get a good meal at The Brick. There are tons of great things about this restaurant. It's a great atmosphere no matter where you sit (outside, at the bar, or in the dining room). The service is always top notch and there is a variety of food options. This place is a little pricy, but I think the ingredients and presentation of the food allow for that. I have to say, my favorite thing to get at the Brick is the brunch. It is a Benedict lover's dream. The smoked salmon Benedict is just about everything I love in one breakfast item. They use high quality salmon, and the cream cheese/hollandaise is not overwhelming. Another great option - the caprese Benedict. It is topped with hand-made pesto hollandaise! The other great brunch option is the baked eggs. Order spicy habanero bloody Mary with brunch (it's a little overpriced though). For lunch or dinner, I would recommend one of their salads. The salmon and kale salad is amazing and a great healthy alternative - the way they cook their kale makes it so flavorful. The seared ahi tuna salad or the grilled chicken salad are also great alternatives."], ["Samantha K.", "After living in riverside for over a year, I finally got a chance to check out the brick. My partner and I had dinner there on a Saturday night, and did have to wait 40 minutes for a table, but they do provide a pager and we were able to go to mojos down the block for a drink. Actually, it wasn't too bad that there was a wait--it just made our night feel a bit longer and we got to go to two places! Anyways.....Service was very good. Despite how busy they were we did not feel neglected. Our server was very polite and helpful. Food wise, the meal did not start well but it was made up for and we ended up still enjoying it very much. We ordered the calamari as an appetizer. When it came out it was very, very over cooked. The breading was extremely crispy but crumbled right off the calamari. The calamari itself was hard. Neither one of us could eat it and had to send it back. Luckily the server took it back promptly and we ordered the crab cake instead. That turned out to be a great choice and it was delicious. For our meals I ordered the Mediterranean salad with shrimp and it was delicious. My boyfriend ordered a steak. We both really enjoyed it. I also ordered a bottle of red wine which was a good choice (the goldeneye) from there extensive wine list. All in all I will definitely be back again!"], ["Terry M.", "Great service and great food. This place has never disappointed me and I travel for a living and therefore eat out a lot. It's nice to have a go-to place at home. From the food to the drinks, the hostess to the server, it's obvious everyone here understands how to treat customers."], ["Stephanie J.", "This venue was perfect for late night dining. I visited for my birthday this year and my favorite dish are the lobster spring rolls. Absolutely delightful. The lighting is a bit poor which makes it hard to see, but the taste of the drinks make up for my loss of sight. lol"], ["Lara F.", "Cant seem to get anything right with me. We can walk to this restaurant but rarely go unless we are meeting people there for a glass of wine. Id like to say the service is good but they cant seem to get it right!I always order the same food and due to my allergies I know what ingredient to leave out. Its a salad so its no big deal. Do not put the artichoke on my salad and no dressing..nothing..dry..no oil..nothing. Cant seem to get it right. Had a large party that we hosted here and after long talks, our own limited menu creation and meeting with management, \u00a0at the party I was served something im allergic to. My husband would have hit the roof so I played it off, quietly medicated myself and drank wine for dinner. They are priced right for this area and I love the atmosphere. ..if only they could get one salad right."], ["Rich L.", "I have been here several times since we love around the corner. And everytime I leave I am just meh. Nothing terrible, but nothing spectacular either. Will I go again, probably, but I never just \"crave\" this place."], ["Richard D.", "It's hard not to like the area. Really good service with a lot of smiles. French dip keeps me coming back. The blackened Mahi is excellent as well."], ["E H.", "I was really impressed with their brunch. The eggs Benedict was perfectly prepared, and the strawberry mimosa complemented it well. Our waiter was friendly and didn't rush us. Good atmosphere for catching up with a group of friends."], ["Marlon M.", "Ambience is always great, but food is going down hill, unsure if theres a new chef or new mgnt, we wont be coming back anytime soon sorry to say food was \u00a0bland and cold , slow service just last Sunday had to send my breakfast back mines the \u00a0Benedict and my wife the Rancheros, \u00a0manager didn't even bother to come and check our table.The Fox across the road much better breakfast choice? Get you act together"], ["Judie N.", "Loved it from beginning to end! Our waiter Jerimiah was on point throughout the meal! We started with a bottle of wine and the carpaccio! Delicious! To die for! I am not a wine expert but I love wine and we had a nice bottle reasonably priced. On to our meal. I had the rack of lamb. Cooked to perfection. My daughter had the crab cakes which were CRAB! No fillers! They also were very accommodating to my 1 year old grandson's needs. Jeremiah brought him crackers and smiley face fries. \u00a0Dipped in ranch(of course). I do wish I invented ranch dressing! Oh I can't forget the kale salad!! So delicious and fresh with a very light lemon vinegarette dressing. We finished with the goat cheese cheese cake. Unique and oh so good. I visit my daughter in Jacksonville from time to time. The Brick is a must while I am here. I look forward to my next visit! \u00a0Do I recommend The Brick? Absolutely! Don't miss it! Yummmmmm!!!"], ["Rodney M.", "I had the Kobe burger which wasn't up to par for Kobe price along with fries. It tasted like Angus or Chuckbut not Kobe. I ordered medium well & got medium rare & the food temp was not hot enough. My companion had the sea scallops with jazmine rice & sweet potato fries & her meal was excellent. The service was very good along with the atmosphere. A live jazz band played which was very nice & added positively to the dining experience. I think the drinks are over priced but fairly typical for this type establishment. Overall it was nice."], ["Matt J.", "Good food.Decent service.Go here for brunch.done son!"]]}
