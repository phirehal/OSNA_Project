The pizza, I opened the box and I said \" looks good\" it was good, very good, the sauce was tasty and the dough mmmm the cheese like I like, thick and chewy, I could have used more of that yummy pepperoni though, and it's great breakfast pizza. The calzone was sooo good, I actually tasted the ricotta, it was creamy and tasty, the spinach was a little squishy but still very good (you gotta use frozen spinach to get the right texture) all this needed to blow off the back of my head was a little feta just a little it adds salt and tang. The meatball was good and cheesy seemed like proper meatballs not the frozen crappy ones found elsewhere, the Italian was good but I ate it for breakfast, I'll have to try it fresh before I can judge it.

The server was attentive and did provide suggestions. We started with the crab stuffed portabella mushroom and the calamari. We thought the crab stuffed mushroom was excellent. The Calamari was better than average but but not outstanding. The batter was light and not greasy and it was cooked correctly. It just was missing something to put it over the top. The main courses were Veal Florentine, Fruitti Di Mare, Steak and Cheese Calzone and the Medallion Al Cacciatore. We sampled each of the dishes. The Veal was very nice and tender and had a lovely light sauce. The Fruitti Di Mare (Muscles, Claims, Calamari and shrimp on a bed of risotto). The seafood was all cooked perfectly and tasted wonderful. There was a good amount of butter on this dish but it did not affect the flavor or make it oily. The Medallion was steak in a red wine sauce with mushrooms and onions. The flavor in this dish was the overall winner as best of the evening. The meat was nice and tender as well. As for the Calzone that is a basic simple item. Meat and cheese rapped in dough they are pretty hard to screw up or make it outstanding so no further comments are needed. Overall we are very pleased with this find and the fact that it is so close to home makes it a great find for us.

They have a few large TVs about the place with sports or other movies on and about 8-9pm the old school white disco ball starts spinning.

Also had a half garden salad to share. The salad wasn't anything great- typical rabbit food but it was freshly cut if nothing else. The pizza looked like it was covered in sandwich ham, 6 pepperonis and cheese. 6 slices to a medium and while the slices were huge, I didn't know where the meat was. For something that sounded so carnivorous, it wasn't. There was a magnanimous amount of cheese on the pizza which really made it salty. The crust was thin, crispy and incredibly flavorful. All that said, this was on par for good pizza. I'm praying the lack of meat under the layer of cheese was due to an off night. Also able to try a bite of white- excellent. Also visited the bathroom for handwashing. Restroom was kept very clean with no exposed cleaning products or lack of paper products. Single person restroom. All in all, 5/5 stars for staff friendliness and helpfulness. Food was better than most run of the mill pizza joints in Jacksonville.

Instead of being waited on at a table, you order at a counter and then pick a seat while the pizza is made. The wait staff then delivers the pizza to your table.

I'm not kidding; this was THE best white pizza I have ever had in my life (and I've had a lot of white pizza). The combination of oil and spices was superb. I really wanted to eat the whole thing, but the medium was more than enough for us. Usually leftovers aren't as good the next day, but by some sort of moon magic, my leftovers were damn near perfect the next day.

We were the first customers of the evening with my table of 4 and it took over an hour for entrees to be served. When I asked for any dinner or drink specials the waitress looked at me like I was crazy. When I asked for recommendations or popular menu items she was neither helpful or attentive. My glass of water had to be filled by another waitress even after someone reminded her that our table needed refilling services. The prices per entree ranged from at least $25+. If you're on a $50 a day per diem I wouldn't spend it here. The only positive comment that I would have to say is that their portions are huge but its definitely what you're paying for.

The \"group coordinator\" however, was so not worth the trouble of speaking with today. What a huge bust for a hire with this one. I hope she doesn't get paid a salary for her job. I have worked in MANY restaurants over the past 10 years, and still can't believe the tone I experienced within the first seconds of our phone call. After telling me how inconvenient it would be to host my party of 40, and how the servers would not be able to get around our group, we would make the entire restaurant heat up, we would be too loud, and how we would just all around be a massive inconvenience to the other guests who are trying to enjoy their meals, she tells me that if I drop it to 35 she would be happy to accommodate me.Well, who knew that five people made such a massive difference to the temperature and noise inside of a restaurant.What I don't understand is why a simple, \"we don't have the space to accommodate your group\" response is not what I received. Don't worry love, if our group drops to 35, you still couldn't pay me to give you our business.

I ordered a Peach Palmer (Arnold Palmer with peach puree) and a Grilled Salmon Salad (described as mixed greens, Roma tomatoes, feta, asparagus, crispy shoestring potatoes and a balsamic vinaigrette).His Pasta Pesto was very tasty, with a generous amount of grilled chicken and the vegetables roasted just enough to bring out their sweetness, the caramelized onions not overdone and the pasta perfectly cooked.My Grilled Salmon Salad was lovely: the salmon was firm without being dry, the asparagus spears were blackened without the flavour being ruined but there was no sign of the promised feta cheese and the 'crispy' shoestring potatoes seemed stale and chewy and were pushed to the side. \u00a0My Peach Palmer was a little sweet but benefited from free refills and the accompanying lemon slices helped cut the sweetness. \u00a0 Service was initially excellent: our food came out very quickly and arrived fresh and hot, our server was topping up our drinks before we had the chance to notice the levels were getting low and although our server did seem to go A.W.O.L while we waited for the check, the lunch rush had just started and therefore I completely understood them getting a little busy.This is a great spot for lunch: the outdoor seating area is lovely and the indoor area looks excellent, Brio doesn't have a chain restaurant feel to it and is a very elegant place to eat; however the food quality is very good without making the leap to excellent, and the prime location means you'll be paying a little more than usual."], ["Sofia L.", "Extra good.

The food was pleasant. My favorite dishes were ones others ordered, which I just sampled: the chicken marsala followed by the osso buco, a special. My next favorite was probably the Italian wedding soup, which incurred a $2 supplement fee. Those dishes were probably worth ordering again. The other dishes were pleasant but I wouldn't order them again. They were three shared appetizers, cheese ravioli, meat ravioli, and calamari; my entree linguini alla rosa; and creme brulee for dessert. I added a scallop to my linguine for $6 (at least it was a big scallop). The entrees include soup or salad. I'd say serving size is larger than average, e.g. the ravioli appetizers were more than most people would want to eat alone for an appetizer. The setting was decent but too noisy for me (79 db according to my smartphone). On this busy Saturday night there was live music, but it was too loud for me even when the music wasn't playing. We were in the west dining room/banquet room. The center dining room is where the bar and music is. The east dining room looked nice to me and was the quietest, at least when I visited it with the music playing. They seated our group of 7 (reserved for 8 but one didn't show) at two round tables, pushed together, which wasn't optimal. There were more children at this restaurant than most I visit: it seems a real family-oriented place. The performer sang happy birthday twice while we were there. The maitre d's bright blue suit and showy shoes made me smile. The service was decent but below average. When I got there I asked that the bottle of wine I brought be put on ice right away (corkage fee: $12). When it appeared on our table a while later (they wouldn't seat us until at least half our party was there) it wasn't on ice. A while later, after I asked about it, it was put in a wine chiller. Garlic bread was promised at the beginning of our meal but didn't appear until after our main courses, when someone may have asked for it to sop up their sauce. Our waiter was rude at one point after someone told him she thought we'd only ordered one creme brulee: he curtly corrected her, pointing out what desserts each person had ordered. They weren't able to split up dishes on different bills any way we wanted, as restaurants with the best equipment (e.g. Taverna) can. My water was never refilled. If I visited here again I'd try for a quieter time and place, and perhaps try one of the meat dishes my dining companions ordered that I liked (or the meatballs app, which an acquaintance says is her favorite dish at her favorite restauant)."], ["Gabie R.", "The service here is phenomenal--you feel like royalty the moment you reach for the door.

We get there, and the hostess asks if we had a reservation; of course we said no.

He also said, \"Well I have a table but a reservation is booked for 6:00; I don't want to give these people 40 minutes to eat (it was around 5:15 when we arrived).\" He couldn't even talk directly TO us, more like AT us.Frustrated that we were told one thing on the phone, then basically turned away upon arrival.

Everyone from the greet desk to the server were attentive and helpful. Everyone was happy with their order but a few things I wanted to point out:- the water tasted funny. probably best to go with bottled option (which I never do) here- the bruschetta goat cheese appetizer was not bruschetta. It was more like a mini pizza. Which they should just call goat cheese pizza appetizer. - I ordered the Enza Grouper thinking it would be the healthiest dish besides a salad. The fish comes covered in a sauce with a few pieces of spinach in it. Not on the side like the description. The grouper tasted good but it definitely was not as healthy as the description made it out to be. The description makes it seem like it's fish with lemon and capers and spinach on the side. If I had been paying for dinner I probably would have sent this back but since I was with coworkers I let it go. - the pistachio gelato was amazing. I'm not even a big fan of gelato usually. The cheesecake and tiramisu were just okay. The show steeler was the cannoli and gelato. For a restaurant that totes authenticity I would have liked to see some in house made desserts.

Service was outstanding with friendly greetings from everyone. Nice bar area."], ["Waheed B.", "When I'm not enjoying my Southern culinary roots, I like to let my Italian cuisine side show and I'm a big supporter of pasta and sauce joints. My latest kick is to order/eat handmade pasta if I am not the one preparing the food, and unfortunately this place does not make their own--sad face.Whatever you get it will taste good and the servers are good and everything seems pretty good, so I can't rave about it being the most amazing place you will eat. I think it's great for larger groups because they have a banquet room, and the live music on Friday night is a nice touch. However, the restaurant had a strange layout as if it was separate portions in the shopping center that were put together. This place is so popular that parking can mean a walk in unseasonably cold FL weather. But this is an independent, non-chain establishment and it's a favorite of locals so I anticipate I will be back.Recommendations include any of the ravioli (lobster is good but pricey) and the pasta fagioli soup when you are tired of salads."], ["Phyllis G.", "The worst experience at a restaurant I have ever had. Made reservations for 3-28-15 for my daughter's 30th birthday. \u00a0We had a party of about 18. We arrived and were seated at around 6:45 pm and drink orders were taken and received as well as apps. The problem arose when we ordered entrees and did not receive them until 9:30. Two hours we waited for them. We ask twice about them and were told they were being plated. We ask at 8:00 and then again at 9:00. Once we received our food it was cold and over cooked. The owner of Enza's called me on Sunday and told me it was our fault that our food was so long getting to our table and for it being cold because we had wanted to sit together and we had some that were running behind due to work. I am disappointed in the way it was handled and will not be going back there again."], ["Mark R.", "The food is good, but far from great. \u00a0And the garlic bread is some sort of magical pan, as it looks and smells great, but has no flavor to speak of.Worst of all, it's totally overpriced.I feel sorry for everyone in Jax that thinks this is great Italian food. \u00a0It is one of the best in town (for the best, go to Piccasso's), but - sadly - that's not saying much."], ["Annie H.", "I love Enzas!

Lol.

We both had Enza's salad that had plenty of feta cheese, but not overpowering. I had the chicken alla rosa and the guy had the veal saltimboca. Both the chicken and veal were so tender and the sauces that accompanied them were delicious. We decided to get both the tiramisu and the spumoni. They were the perfect end to a perfect meal.

Received our menus which were all loose and out of place. The paper and paper protecting the covers for the menus had all fallen out of the leather bound books they reside in. Granted it was an easy fix, but come on ... for the price per plate this place charges they should have better menus! The menus are incredibly heavy and feel like a thick novel. The chairs are incredibly uncomfortable (low backs and hard wood seats), and the tables made me feel as if I was 5 years old again. They have paper sheets covering the tables as if they have no confidence in their patrons to control their food. I ordered the Chicken Parmesan, which was somewhere near 20 bucks I think maybe 16-17 was what the menu said. It certainly didn't taste like a 17 dollar dish to me. The worst part was our waiter. He didn't seem to pay much attention to our table. Took him forever to get us our check and refill our drinks when needed. We waited about an hour for our food and in my opinion wasn't that impressed for an hour worth of wait and a 120 dollar bill for 4 people."], ["Lynn E.", "I'm Italian and I'm from New York. \u00a0So, if I'm giving a 5-star rating to an Italian restaurant, you know this is the place to be! \u00a0We had heard great things about Enza's and have been meaning to try it out for months. \u00a0We finally got around to it a couple of weeks ago and are still kicking ourselves for waiting so long!Enza and her husband are from Italy and have been in the restaurant business their entire lives. \u00a0They are hands-on both in the kitchen and in the dining room, greeting customers and making sure their dining experience is as good as it can possibly be. \u00a0Their daughters cheerfully work as servers and make recommendations on the wine and food. \u00a0One review we read warned that it can sometimes be difficult to get seated quickly without a reservation and we now see why! \u00a0There is nothing on the menu that is not absolutely outstanding. \u00a0You seriously cannot go wrong here! \u00a0We ordered 2 appetizers, the carpaccio and the fried ravioli. \u00a0Both were superb. \u00a0In fact, my husband has often been frustrated with how carpaccio is served in other restaurants, but was super excited about how Enza's got it so right. \u00a0The ravioli portion was huge for an appetizer, so I was lucky enough to bring half of it home for the next day's lunch! \u00a0For the entree, I ordered a grouper almondine special served over sauteed spinach and asked for a side of fettucini alfredo. \u00a0The flavors perfectly complimented each other, the fish was absolutely perfectly cooked, and the alfredo sauce was, quite literally, the best I have ever tasted. \u00a0My husband ordered the rigatoni bolognese, where he was given a choice between the two bolognese sauces on the menu. \u00a0There's the \"ordinary\" sauce, and then there's the special sauce made with beef, veal, and lamb and simmered for 5 hours: the house special. \u00a0His report was that it was exceptional in meatiness and complex flavor.We will probably make Enza's a monthly tradition and hope to try everything on the menu! \u00a0Since so many of us transplanted Yankees complain that the South doesn't seem to get Italian right, I'm going to call this a \"must-do\" restaurant.They're closed Mondays and don't open until 4:00 p.m. other days. \u00a0Reservations can be made by leaving a voice mail or on their website."], ["Ted A.", "The bar has been set.

The wine selection was so sad.)The iced tea tasted like they don't clean the brewer properly.I won't give them 1 star because I haven't gotten sick from it yet.

Safe to say my family will never order from Shiraz again!!!"], ["Sam B.", "I ordered a Garden salad & Sicilian deluxe pizza for delivery thru yelp. I choose the garden salad because of the extra veggies, unfortunately they didn't put green peppers, olives or mushrooms on the salad. The pizza ingredients were very fresh but the crust was a bit burnt and the pizza wasn't hot. I think I'll try to call my order in next time."], ["Patrick C.", "Still my favorite pizza restaurant on Southside. It's a shame we moved 20 minutes away as now we rarely get to enjoy this delicious pizza. I would love to send the owner a million people because it doesn't get any better. A must eat pizza place!"], ["Gregg K.", "Really good pizza, just the way I like it. Tons Of Cheese!!! There Garlic Knots are amazing. And the owner and staff are super friendly. Just moved to this side of town and very happy I found my local pizzeria."], ["Betsy M.", "Excellent! We had Sicilian and it was fresh & tasty! Great service, very friendly atmosphere!"]], "Carrabba's": [["Jenni A.", "Tonight's visit was an unexpected detour from the beach due to a thunderstorm. We selected Carrabba's for the convent location & ambience (avoiding the bright, loud weekend party crowd) and it proved to be a good choice. Long wait before our server came to take our drink order but delivered it quickly & with bread. Our salad & soup came soon after we finished all the bread (which our server refilled). I had the house salad which was ok. My husband & son each had the delicious sausage lentil soup (our favorite soup here!). Our youngest ordered the Kids Quatro Ravioli & our son ordered the Bake Ravioli Parmesan which are about the same dish except you pay&get more with the non-kid version. My husband had the Carrabba Italian Classics but was not thrilled by the lasagna it came with. I however enjoyed the Fettuccine Weeze & would order again. Overall a good dinner with lot of food for a family of 4 for a little below 70$."], ["Rogelio M.", "The pasta carraba is the best since it has peas and mushrooms. \u00a0Food always taste fresh."], ["Rebecca N.", "They are good, but very expensive! Good for specials occasions. The service, food and drinks are \"A-Plus\" in my book!"], ["Chris P.", "Carrabba's has lovely atmosphere and for a national chain decent food standards. Typically I go with the Lobster Ravioli and a flat bread. \u00a0The Onion / Bacon Flatbread is good combination of sweet and salty flavor profiles. I like to sit at the high top near the kitchen prep area. \u00a0Overall, very delicious food."], ["Deb S.", "My mother had never been to Carrabba's and it was her choice for her birthday celebration. \u00a0My initial call to ask about reservations was handled professionally and was advised because of the size of the party to call ahead because reservations couldn't be made...no problem did so and we were seated with little to no wait. The host/hostess were great but then it went downhill from there. \u00a0Our servers \u00a0were preoccupied, obvious they were rushing to get our order, one in particular (male) seemed annoyed with having to answer questions about the selections, appetizers appeared quickly, but the bread and the meals took forever to arrive. \u00a0The one server who was borderline rude eventually bailed leaving a party of 12 to one server...she did the best she could but she couldn't keep up. The food was well, chain food. \u00a0Nothing stood out as outstanding. Shame considering it was \u00a0my mother's 71st birthday and she had been looking forward to dining there for weeks prior to her birthday. \u00a0My thought was we could have gotten the same level of service at the Olive Garden down the street for a lot less money. Sorry guys...won't be back."], ["Kevin C.", "Food was great, service started off great but she got lost when it came time for us to leave. \u00a0We had to wait for our check which I didn't appreciate."], ["Stephanie D.", "Just discovered this chain and fell in love with it. We don't have any franchise in Canada but certainly wish they would expand the brand there! I love my italian food and this is great quality food, made from scratch daily and at fine prices. I strongly recommend!"], ["Alen L.", "I've been to Carrabba's quite a few times and have loved the experience every time. The ambiance and decor is one of the best I have ever experienced, which is impressive for a fairly casual chain restaurant. The wait staff is always friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient. You could make a meal out of their bread and olive oil alone - it is absolutely outstanding. The menu has a large selection of seafood, steak, pizza and pasta. I'd personally recommend the Spiedino di Mare, a delicious shrimp and scallops dish. A very good choice for a causal night out. Expect to spend $20-30 per person."], ["Aimee F.", "Our dinner was delicious. The calamari was hot and tasted very fresh. The blackberry sangria was smooth, fruity but not too sweet. I had the tomato pasta, just ok. The chicken Bryan was out of this world. Our server was very good."]], "Tommy's Brick Oven Pizza": []}
