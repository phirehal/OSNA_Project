The crowd was painfully hip--did the restaurant hire all these extras to stand around and look glamorous and amazing? Or do these people live in Minnesota? I'm so confused.What I mean by all of this, is that the space is breathtaking. Gorgeous chandeliers, Parisian floors--the place is dripping in class and is beyond sexy. Dark, yet warm. Simple, yet chic. It feels massive and cozy all at once. How is that even physically possible? This is a great spot for a group gathering or a celebration! It feels impressive and special, and the people watching is exceptional.Although we just went for drinks and appetizers, we were all very pleased with our choices. My friends tried tons of the specialty cocktails (we had a special Minnesota giggle over the one called Duck Duck Gray Duck). And I discovered, for the first time in my life, that I like oysters! I never thought I did, but here they are warm and garlicky and not ocean-tasting at all. We ordered five for our group of six people and I ate two. Whoopsies! Our server was knowledgeable and charming and knew the menu backwards and forwards. She was nothing short of delightful and professional.I can't wait to go back and try more dishes beyond the oysters, french fries, brussel sprouts and cheese plate. The chef here here has such a deep respect for food and such a creative flair, that I bet it'll be hard to find a non-delicious item on the menu, albeit impossible."], ["Chris L.", "First time review and could go to five stars with repeat performance.Popped in for a late Monday night dinner. \u00a0Not packed and no wait probably added to the charm for me. \u00a0Party sat at a hightop in the bar. \u00a0Good beer selection and plenty of wine by the glass -- cocktail menu looked fun but no one partook.Food came out fast and was spot on. \u00a0Pepperoni flatbread done right -- crispy cracker crust and flavorful toppings. \u00a0Brussels were great and gnocchi even better -- very similar to 112 Eatery style. \u00a0Cheese plate was on par with restaurants of its type. \u00a0Companions had scallops (excellent) and duck confit/risotto balls -- good but so rich you can't finish the portion given.We took an informal tour and the semi-private dining room has to be one of the best looking rooms of its type in the Cities. \u00a0Some cool, eclectic furnishings on the second floor. \u00a0On the way out spotted some Pappy van Winkle in the wine cellar, and had our choice of a 15, 20 or 23 year pour (did the 15 year at $35 for 2 oz.). \u00a0Owner JT gracious and welcoming in discussing the Pappy.Going to be my new neighborhood place. \u00a0Welcome Coup d'Etat!UPDATE - Went back with wife and kiddo. \u00a0Still a four star experience. \u00a0No wait and good service if a little bright eyed (\"it's all good!\"). \u00a0Mussels and clams were good, cheese plate was stingier than the last time (3 very small pieces). \u00a0Brussels were OK but not as good as I recall the last time. \u00a0Flatbreads are great. \u00a0Pappardelle dish was very good. \u00a0Still a good variety of beers to choose from (not just 15 IPAs)."], ["Brigid M.", "Was visiting the boyfriend's family and made some reservations with friends as it was the end of Restaurant Week. Here are the pluses:-Decor and set up is awesome, rivals quite a few places I've seen in Chicago.-Asparagus was a perfect portion, and nice touch with the prosciutto.-Strawberry rhubarb tart was not overdone, nice contrast of flavors. The cons:-SERVICE! Our server was literally high as a kite and couldn't focus on us. She would forget orders and mix up what people wanted. She was so slow that the runners and other servers were picking up her slack and delivering drinks and food. Granted, she was very apologetic, but midway through the meal began slurring her words and blaming her flightiness on boyfriend issues. At the end of the meal she took about 30 minutes to split a check amongst five people and even left some charges off the bill. It was a busy night, but a manager had to have seen that the server was mightily struggling and not sober at all. I hope that it was just an off night, but the experience would make me reluctant to try Coup d'Etat for a late night meal."], ["Kristi E.", "I went a few weeks after opening - we were sat at a booth near the bar, but would have loved a seat up top with a view, or in the impressive room in the back. I had the brussels sprouts (very vinegar-y), some cocktails, and fries (which were blah as blah can be). I'd suggest sitting by the kitchen at the marble-top bar, or up top. Grab the cocktails then head on out into uptown for some better food."], ["Galina S.", "Don't go for food, for drinks and atmosphere good, kitchen DOES NOT MEET THE PLACE, PERIOD."], ["John G.", "Minneapolis needs more restaurants like this. The entire concept works, from the decor and ambience to the menu and drinks, along with top notch service. The Old Fashioned I ordered hit the spot; one can tell the bar has great attention to detail. I'd like to see a Manhattan on the menu as well, but that's just my own taste. They also have an excellent beer selection that is seasonally appropriate with a wide variety of choices.I don't typically go for a flat iron steak, but it came recommended and I was happy with my decision - cooked medium/medium-rare with a ton of flavor. The Branzino was cooked perfectly as well - I'll be interested to try the other fish on the menu. And if you come here you must order the brussel sprouts. So delicious.The only thing keeping this review from being 5 stars is the price tag. I felt the entrees, while spectacular, were $5-8 overpriced, and the drinks were a bit too expensive as well (This is Minneapolis, not Chicago). Perhaps after a few more visits I'll conclude that the prices are justified for the overall experience. Given how fantastic Borough/Parlour are, I knew this place wouldn't disappoint. Well done!"], ["Ellen M.", "The atmosphere was quite nice. \u00a0And I could hear my friends speaking across the table.But the mussels, pizza and fries were only so-so. \u00a0The chocolate lava cake dessert was great, along with the 3 cheese appetizer. \u00a0No real reason for me to go there again."], ["Kate S.", "Great (semi-new) restaurant in Uptown! They have amazing ambiance, and GREAT Happy Hour - though some food a bit greasy, it has there classics (bone marrow and oysters) for 1/2 price (5-7 p.m.), also the HH Cocktails are SO good - I recommend the Apples to Apples yummmm. \u00a0Can't wait to go there again and again."], ["Vee V.", "The gnocchi was fantastic! Very fluffy and flavorful, and not heavy at all. It's a must try! Our table also had the grilled octopus, bone marrow, creamy polenta, and ahi tuna. These dishes all needed a bit more salt. They were \"so so,\" I wouldn't order those dishes again. The octopus was good alone but it had a spread that was a bit sour, it was kind of funky. The service was great, very friendly staff. The drinks were delicious, I'll be back for the Earl Grey old fashion!"], ["Jay B.", "Decided to give this place a shot after hearing a lot if good things from friends and reading reviews. \u00a0Disclaimer...poor service drives this poor review and it may have been bad luck...We were seated promptly at a nice table on the second level. \u00a0The waitress was slow to arrive and it only got worse. \u00a0Our party of four ordered a beer, scotch and two glasses of sparkling wine. \u00a0The waitress returned to advise the beer was gone. \u00a0A second beer was ordered and it arrived 5-10 minutes later..alone. \u00a0Next the sparkling wine arrived 5 minutes later and still no scotch. \u00a0Evidently the bottle was only stored on the lower level..so 5 more minutes and finally we all have our drinks.We ordered mussels as an appetizer which admittedly were good. \u00a0We placed entree orders and upon their arrival the fries were missing. \u00a0We ordered more drinks and they arrived in three shifts again. \u00a0Two glasses of wine arriving after the entrees were already eaten. The food was okay, not fantastic. \u00a0We had the pork, steak and halibut. \u00a0Presentation was fine and the flavors were as well. \u00a0Nothing to rush back for however. \u00a0For desert we ordered the smores and boozy ice cream sandwich. \u00a0Both good. \u00a0After paying the bill we determined the experienced was ruined by HORRIBLE service and the food was OK. \u00a0Again maybe bad luck...but I won't give them another shot. \u00a0My nights out are far to rare to be left to chance."], ["Sunny T.", "The decor/atmosphere of this place is amazing. It's like glamour met modern met chic yet it still has some sort of rustic/medieval feel to it. Not to mention, the outdoor seating is prime--a beautiful balcony area that wraps around the whole 2nd level of their restaurant. It's definitely an experience, especially on a summer night--perfect for people watching and just observing the lively mini Uptown area. Sadly, the food isn't on the same level (Ha, punny...get it?).The menu is on the pricey side--nothing under $24 for entrees. I was torn between the gnocchi (which I heard is heavenly) and their lamb pizza. I really wish I wasn't a sucker for lamb, cause my friend's gnocchi really did live up to the hype--it was perfectly pillowy and the parmesan truffle sauce was buttery with a sweet after note--delicious. If I was a cruel human being, I would've reached across, taken her dish, and devoured the whole thing, but instead I just nodded in awe, savoring the one gnocchi piece on my fork.My lamb pizza was below mediocre. It was more of a flatbread, with a thin layer of tomato sauce, feta cheese, kalamata olives, basil and lamb. Unfortunately the description sounded far better than the actual dish. The lamb tasted more like the kind you'd get at a cheap gyro joint, while the chiffonaded basil were skimpy and shriveled. I think I could've made a better pizza... it was completely one noted and just salty. I also sampled some of my friend's fries (she offered, I promise I'm not a moocher!) and they were inedibly salty. Usually I'll be complaining about something being too salty as I'm shoveling another bite into my mouth, but the fries were a whole other level. My tongue even started hurting. When you come to Coup d'etat, you're paying for the atmosphere. If someone were to suggest coming here again, I'd be more ecstatic to sit on the outside patio than for the food."], ["Carrie R.", "Went here for restaurant week. \u00a0Food was WAY too salty but good aside from that. \u00a0Service was good."], ["Jen W.", "The service is the star of the show here. \u00a0Without the stellar service provided by every single employee I encountered (from hostess to bartender to Kelly our waitress) I wouldn't be too geeked about this place.The space is well designed and certainly big, but not nearly as sexy as i expected it to be. \u00a0Reminded me of a cross of Stella's and 112 somehow. \u00a0You certainly don't need to dress up.Don't get me wrong, the food was good (deviled eggs, green salad, cauliflower gratin, parpardelle, carrot cake) but nothing was particularly innovative and everything was incredibly rich and heavy. \u00a0The wine list was curiously sparse; they appear to have spent all of their time on cocktails (which were delicious).All in all, a solid choice."], ["Alex S.", "If watching the bartender pour your wine in a uncleaned 3 oz rationing vessel before your glass then this is your place!"], ["Mickey N.", "When looking for a restaurant in Uptown, we decided to give this place a try. \u00a0The outside looked appealing, and I heard some good things about it. \u00a0Then when I saw the menu, I thought it seemed somewhat similar to the Libertine experience down the road.Break Down:Drinks: I had an overpriced summer sunset at $9 that was quite good, while my partner had a glass of white wine.Food: All items are meant for sharing as they are small portions.1.

I dined at Coup d' Etat tonight and certainly will give the restaurant points for interior design, but no more.We ordered the foie gras, gnocchi and beet salad for appetizers and the arctic char and halibut for entrees. The portions were small, food bland, garnishments lacking and service mediocre at best. I've lived around the US (New York, Chicago, Los Angeles), have traveled to 5 continents and nearly 40 countries and can say this restaurant doesn't make the top 50% of restaurants I've dined at.

That's not high praise. The high point was the caesar salad which was fine. But the steak frites were meh. The stead wasn't great quality and the fries weren't nearly crispy enough. I've had steak frites dozens of times and have never had a filet. That's not traditional, since a filet isn't the most flavorful of cuts. In short, the place isn't very French at all. The setting was fine, but nothing special. Nor was it romantic. It looked like it had maybe been a casual burger place or even a breakfast place that had been converted to a French restaurant. The desserts were vaguely French. Just not classic or excellent.We shared a bottle of Malbec that was $38. That's not a huge amount, so perhaps I shouldn't have expected it to be drinkable. But the waiter should have offered a replacement when I took a sip and made a face. When diners leave most of a bottle of wine, it's nice if the server can be proactive. But the guys seemed merely pleasant, not old hands.Clearly, I wouldn't go back. But my friends who don't dine out a lot claimed they really enjoyed it. I suppose it's a matter of expectations.

I can't rave enough about this place. First time diners and we had to wait about 10 minutes for our table. No problem. We were greeted promptly, told we could get a sample of some wine which were two generous pours and upon finishing were given another bottle to pour ourselves a glass while we waited. Talk about customer love. Once seated we received a complimentary order of the best calamari we'd ever had. Not bready, just quickly seared. The moules were superb and an order of the fresh baked bread to sop up the broth is a must. Had the char and lamb chops which we shared - I enjoyed the char more but my husband swooned over the lamb. The butterscotch budino for dessert was delicious and complimentary as well since I was celebrating my birthday. The service and hospitality was impeccable. Couldn't have enjoyed ourselves more. While I give it 5 starts, the only suggestion I'd leave for the restaurant would be to go a bit easier on the salt. It was overwhelming in some dishes but not enough to reduce to four stars. The owners have done a marvelous job of adding acoustical tile to the ceiling to drown out the noise which is impressive given the tight quarters and long line of diners waiting to be seated.

You call and leave a message. You are confirmed unless you hear back. The food and experience made me forget; so I'm over it. We had a 7:30 reservation ( I recommend this; you need to call, no on-line reservations) and were seated promptly. Our server came over with menus, water & bread followed shortly after. While were we still looking over the drink menu the owner came over and greeted us and asked if we had any questions about the menu. My dining companion asked about a wine she wanted to try. He explained it was not is favorite, and offered to bring over a sample along with another she might like instead. He was spot on. The wine in question was not good and the recommended wine was good. The french beer he told me about was also good. We started with a Baked Bulgarian Feta Kalamata that was served with green olives, red bell peppers, capers, olive oil and croutons. I really wanted an appetizer and this fit the bill. I liked the saltiness of the olives that mixed with the cheese. For a salad I had the beet salad. I love beets! This beet salad consisted of thin sliced roasted beets, with cucumber, Gorgonzola cheese and Dijon vinaigrette dressing. Holy crap that was good. I combined each ingredient in each bite and they all mixed together like a symphony. Dining companion had a salad that was not on the menu; arugula and watermelon. Stay tuned to Yelp for that review. My entree was the Grilled Flank Steak served with sauteed vegetables and caramelized onion-gorgonzola-veal demi. I normally do not order steak, and for sure a flank steak. It's not my cut of meat. But when I was here last year the I had a different steak and it was fantastic so I went with it. The steak was well prepared. I did not think a flank steak could be so good. I loved it because it was kind of charred on the outside and medium rare and juicy on the inside. The vegetables served with it were outstanding. I can't describe the flavor, but I did get a taste of dill in there. The sauce on the steak was outstanding and mixed well with the veggies. \u00a0Dining companion had a pork tenderloin; also stay tuned for that review.The atmosphere was nice too. Small tables, kind of an intimate setting. There was a small child yelling when we first sat down. Kind of a buzz kill, but that not the restaurant's fault. It was lit up more then there than I remember. Our server was very friendly, and helpful when it came to ordering. We never waited long for anything and the timing on the food was perfect.

I haven't had it in a while, but I've actually eaten escargot more often than the average non-fancy pantsy person and Cave Vin's version was perfect. I agree with Melanie L that it might be a \"gateway mollusk\" for snail-virgins.

Solid 2 stars, thanks for that!This was me and the Mrs. first time here and we've been waiting to come here for a long time and we were here for anniversary. The service was OK but not great, the ambiance was amazing as we got a window seat but it was a bit loud for such a large space but the food was disappointing to say the least. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't inedible or anything but definitely not worth the price. Before we get into it, I'm comparing this to other Twin Cities restaurants at this $$$$ price point, Alma, Borough, Butcher and the Boar... Beverages:We had wine, muscato for the the lady and I had a Cab, it came out prompt and tasted fine, white was cold, red was room temp and it was not soured. Starters: A gift from the chef, it was goat cheese whip with a sliver of cracker, cracked black pepper and topped with some type of oil. It was very good! They also brought bread for each person and we had a choice, sesame or wheat. I chose the wheat as my wife chose the sesame, this was the hardest bread I have ever had. It would have been fine if it was a whole loaf, but it was about the size of a dinner roll and it had the full on sour dough shell, it was basically for a jaw warm up exercise for the big game. The butter it came with though was real tasty!Appetizer: My wife, vegetarian, chose the flora (vegetarian set meal) and course 1 was a gazpacho soup, it is served cold which is fine but pretty much felt like they served us a bowl of salsa. After thought on this, gazpacho is not the best vegetarian soup, it really needed some bite, maybe some seafood or something, seasoning was fine but I couldn't help her finish is because I didn't have any Tostitos. I ordered the bison tartare, it was paired with mushrooms which were good. As a whole the tartare was a tad of the acidic side but the crackers it came with was stale. I would give the soup 2/5 and the tartare 3/5. Main event: Flora was a porcine fettuccine, think about it... mushroom pasta, what could go wrong... everything. The pasta arrived, it was a very small portion, luckily it wasn't good so we didn't waste much. First it arrived lukewarm and there was more corn than anything. Secondly, it had zero mushroom flavor, the flavor that was over powering the entire dish was bell peppers. **I think bell peppers and celery taste like dirty towel water** So if you like bell peppers that this is your dish, not for me or my wife 1/5.  \u00a0 \u00a0 I ordered the pork chop, it wasn't good, it wasn't bad, but for $36 it was very bad. It wasn't a thick cut pork chop, minimally seasoned, just salt and pepper, which is fine and it was on a bed of green beans, peach gastric and a croquette. The peach gastric tasted like Heinz 57 sauce, which I like, plus! The croquette was good. If it was an Applebee's \u00a0I would have given it 4/5 but its not, 2/5.Dessert: I didn't even bother looking at the menu, but the Flora included one. Blueberry torte, honey granola, sorbet, blueberry coulis. This was like... like a blueberry cupcake from any chain grocery store except a cardamom or cinnamon bomb exploded all over it. The sorbet and everything tasted of it, over powering and we took 1 bite each and let it go in peace. The bill came... $130.36, we paid, walked out and was left thinking WTF just happened.I think Joe C, but it pretty well too: \"Often times the seasoning is off, the food comes out on the cool side, and while the ingredients are locally-sourced, organic, etc. etc., there's little done to highlight the purported farm-to-fork quality\"Final Words:Stay away. Its downtown St. Paul parking so it is a B, valet is $10 :( and there is so MANY other places to eat at this price point. I give this place a Solid D+ from the temperature how the food was delivered to the flavor.

Oh well, I guess some people are happier with the wine bar taking its place ;-)REGARDLESS, the food offerings in the restaurant are fantastic! Local, organic, humanely, and sustainably raised.

But what am I going to highlight? Prepare yourselves. The fries.I know...I know, I know, I know.Why the fries?Because Heartland is the ONLY restaurant that I've found in the Twin Cities that actually and consistently fries their fries in honest-to-goodness old-fashioned tallow! Even Julia Child's made her commentary on the fries at McDonald's not being as tasty any longer after they stopped frying in the tallow back during the '80s (tallow has a higher smoke point than the other oils). I've been surprised at how many organic/local focused restaurants in the Twin Cities who still use canola or soybean oil and say that they want to appeal to their vegetarians, too. I get that, but can we PLEASE have a few more restaurants that a carnivore can just be a carnivore? So from the deepest place in my heart, thank you, Heartland, for letting this carnivore enjoy her fries again."], ["Sarah U.", "Had the fauna 3-course meal: 4 star flavor, 2 stars for portion size.

Every ingredient on your plate has a purpose on how it makes the dish taste and feel on the palate. The only thing that was not delicious or even tasty was the bread but \"oh well\" that's not what the meal is about. We had the winter greens with sweet potato crisps and bleu cheese mousse. The mousse was one of the best bleu cheese dishes I've bet tried and wanted to literally \"lick the remnants off the plate\" - lol. We also tried a very tasty grilled Bok Choy dish. For and entree we split the Trout entree and a side of roasted beets with rhubarb. Trout has a new definition and Heartland set a new benchmark.

We wanted to get a bottle that would go well with our variety of dishes, and he spoke very knowledgeably about the different wines and where they were from. \u00a0The bottle we got paired really well with the food.The only thing that disappointed me was the fact that I was seated facing a wall, so I didn't get the opportunity to really enjoy the spacious and beautiful surroundings. \u00a0The lovely old building has high ceilings and a lot of charm.This is definitely someplace I'd love to return to for a special occasion."], ["Erin H.", "I really wanted to like this place because I respect what they do and I have heard such great things. However, our experience was one of the most disappointing I've had in awhile.First off, our waiter was not very attentive or helpful. It took an hour to order food and another hour to get it. Our server did let us know that he told the kitchen to put a rush on it, but the food was disappointing once it came. My boyfriend ordered the beef tenderloin--which our server said came medium rare. \"Perfect!\", we said. They beef came RARE. My flauna beef course was not hot, and therefore--chewy.

It was ok..."], ["Joe C.", "I've been here twice now: once for a Valentine's dinner and once for a business dinner. While the food has been fine both times, it never lives up to hype and is woefully overpriced. The deli/market sandwiches have been consistently great, which definitely bumps up the overall rating. However, the chasm between the food and the price tag bring things right back down.First of all, the ambience is great. It's unpretentious in a Midwestern woodsy way, but it's just refined enough to convey the sense that you're about to have a fine dining experience. The service is professional and more helpful than friendly, which doesn't help or hurt. The food, though, leaves me scratching my head. I'm no great chef by any stretch, but I could prepare any of the meals I've had here just as well if not better. Often times the seasoning is off, the food comes out on the cool side, and while the ingredients are locally-sourced, organic, etc. etc., there's little done to highlight the purported farm-to-fork quality. Between my visits I've eaten or sampled from five different meals, and every single one suffered from these issues. I was definitely disappointed since the deli/market side was consistently so good, so I was left dumbfounded by the mediocrity of the fine dining side. I've also sampled five desserts, and the story there is even worse. Two of them were left alone after just one bite, and the other three were unremarkable. Best just to avoid these.If the food were 30-40% less expensive I might not be so jaded, but both times the bill came I felt like I'd been duped. There are many better meals to be had in the cities at this price point.

There were not many options in the area and Heartland boasted valet parking which killed two birds with one stone. The space is really interesting, a little drafty, but definitely enjoyable. Their homemade bread is out of this world, but filling in a way you aren't dying for another piece. Which is saying a lot since bread is one of my favorite food groups. I had the ryewitness cocktail which is a smoky old-fashioned made with michter's rye. If it's on the menu order it! if it's not see if the bartender will kindly oblige you. I'm a snob for old-fashioneds and this was one of the best I've had in ages. My beau had drink-envy he tried a beer he had never heard of. We shared the beet salad which was perfection and very well suited for sharing. A red and pink beet with a poached pear and some charred cabbage. We shared the whitefish which was done perfectly. A lovely crisp skin, but fork tender. Served with summer squash, garbanzos and a light and slightly tinged with vinegar broth/sauce. We also had a side of the cauliflower with romesco sauce. The cauliflower was purple, green and white and roasted. The cauliflower was just heavenly. I could have eaten several portions of it! My beau commented it was one of the best meals we have shared in awhile and I wholeheartedly agree. Definitely a winner!"], ["L J.", "Two stars for the service.

Every meal item was so slow to come out it was like they were growing the vegetables right then. Even my dinner mate's one glass of wine took forever. Additionally his food was room temperature once it finally arrived.I really wanted to like this restaurant. My meal actually was very good, and it's just too bad the service was so terrible. We did speak to the manager, but she seemed somewhat dismissive. We received a free dessert, but it really did not make up for the disappointing experience.

The \u00a0Asparagus came out with the meal. \u00a0It was covered in a white sauce with a slice of ham over it. \u00a0The taste was terrific and the ham added a little extra to the overall flavor. \u00a0The only minor issue was that the Asparagus could have been cooked a little more. \u00a0The stalks were a little to tough. \u00a0The main meal was very good. \u00a0The steak was done medium (asked for medium rare), but otherwise very good. \u00a0 The cut potatoes had a distinct flavor that I absolutely loved. \u00a0They were nice and crisp on the outside and perfectly done in the middle, \u00a0The greens were wonderful as well. \u00a0The sauce that was part of the meal just multiplied the goodness of everything. \u00a0Great job! \u00a0My wife was very pleased with her meal as well.Overall, the food was very good! \u00a0The server seemed a little to aloof for me even though he knew it was our first visit. \u00a0He could have been a little warmer and more interested in being helpful. \u00a0He also was not as prompt at returning to our table even though the place was pretty quiet. \u00a0He assumed we did not want desert (which we did), and it seemed to catch him off guard to have to retrieve the menu again in order for us to order desert.Overall: \u00a0Food - 5, Service - 3 \u00a0We will come back to give it another shot."], ["Gretchen B.", "Heartland is an amazing premise.

I'm so glad that I went!! I've lived in the neighborhood for awhile and had yet to venture in for fear of the prices. I'd heard through the grapevine about the dinner prices so I was skeptical for what lunch would hold. It held a pleasant surprise!Their offerings change daily. A few selections of sandwiches and hot items. I had the black bean and cheese sandwich with salsa and lemongrass pickles. It was made in a panini press and was absolutely divine. A+ for those pickles!!!! Choice of side includes chips, cold salad, or warm side. I went for the cold salad of beets, broccoli rabe, and radishes in a vinegar dressing. A+ again here. The salad was lightly dressed and full of flavor.The man behind the counter was more than helpful in explaining what was offered when I explained it was my first trip in. He was efficient in preparing my lunch and made sure to ask if I needed anything else, including silverware, napkins, and a bag. I went for a oatmeal raisin cookie for later.I was ready for what I assumed would be a large bill as the cookies were not labeled and I figured this is where they would get me. This was not the case and my lunch came to $9 which is average and more than fair for the quality of what I was provided. Way to go Heartland!! You made a new customer out of this picky gal!I would have provided 5 stars if their sweets selections would have provided a vegan option. I was hoping to bring a sweet treat to my friend who had recommended them but they unfortunately did not have one. It appeared that they typically don't and I would love to see at least an offering or two that is vegan."], ["Becky K.", "Went here after I saw it appeared on Eater's Top 38 restaurants to visit in 2015. I wasn't impressed. I did the Flora version of the tasting. First dish was an asian inspired soup. There were chunks of some kind of root vegetable in a dish and a clear-ish broth was poured over top. All in all it was sort of bland. For the main dish it was a tortellini. I am forgetting the filling, but it really didn't matter since you could barely taste whatever was inside. The pasta was cold and not tender, and honestly didn't taste freshly made. Accompanyments were bland as well. My BF ordered the linousine beef tenderloin. While he enjoyed it, it wasn't anything particularly spectacular. We shared my dessert which was a ricotta filled crepe. This was served cold, which was odd for a crepe. The atmosphere of the place is ok, but the high ceilings made it drafty on a very cold night, and honestly I found it not very inviting. Also our waitress didn't know anything about the dishes on the menu, \u00a0which I can forgive if the food is awesome. But it wasn't. Won't go back."], ["Victoria L.", "Came here for a date night when I first got into town because it was close and I love farm-to-table restaurants. The service was perfect. The atmosphere was probably inoffensive, since I don't remember it. The food was very good. Very, very good. My gentleman friend got the \"fauna\" prix fix, and I had the \"flora.\" The fauna involved a rainbow trout appetizer, elk, and a chocolate ricotta cake. The flora started with a chickpea cake salad, then eggplant pasta, then upside peach cake. All of it was delicious and beautifully presented (I didn't care for the elk, but I'm not a big meat eater, so that was probably me.) The portions are seemingly small, but actually perfect--it's exactly right for a three course meal so that you don't leave feeling over-stuffed. However, it was a little too expensive for what it is, hence not five stars. However, this is the kind of place I might come back once a season to see what they're up to, because everything is so nicely done.

Excellent and knowledgeable service to boot.I drove way out of the way for this and it was well worth it."], ["William G.", "The reviews of Heartland exhibit a lot of variability around the mean. \u00a0Most reviewers seem to love it or hate it, and I was interested in seeing for myself. I went to Heartland with a group of six on a recent Tuesday evening. \u00a0There were very few customers, only one or two other tables were occupied. \u00a0The interior of the restaurant is dark and cavernous and the lack of people gave sort of an eerie, late-night bus station feeling. The ambiance is probably better with a crowd. We were seated promptly and our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and attentive but not overly so. \u00a0The menu is not large; there are a couple of prix fixe menus (vegetarian and non-vegetarian), a couple of soups, some salads, \u00a0and for the plat de jour fish, cassoulet, pork chop, and chicken, as well as a few sides and deserts. \u00a0At the urging of our server, four of us chose the pork chop and the other two had the cassoulet and the chicken respectively. \u00a0The chef emphasizes seasonality, flavor, and texture but not variety and presentation. \u00a0In fact the food is rather plain so I can see how someone going to Heartland expecting the standard \"fine dining\" experience might be put off. \u00a0Also the prices are pretty high. \u00a0This might explain the negativity of some of the reviews. \u00a0I had the split pea soup which was served with a generous garnish of locally produced prosciutto. \u00a0I thought that the soup was a success. \u00a0The peas were not over cooked and had a nice tooth feel and the prosciutto added a smoky note. \u00a0The whole effect was somewhat earthy which is appropriate for the season and this dish. \u00a0I thought the pork chop was less successful. \u00a0It was grilled, bone-in Duroc pork served on a bed of root vegetable with a tomato coulis. \u00a0The pork was somewhat dry and tough. \u00a0I buy Duroc pork chops regularly at Byerly's and fix them at home and to me they are better, just as flavorful but not as tough. \u00a0I did not think the coulis was successful; it was much too sweet - almost like ketchup. \u00a0For desert I had the chocolate pot de cr\u00e8me. \u00a0 \u00a0This was very good with a poached pear garnish which I particularly enjoyed. \u00a0The bread was a mystery to me. As other reviews have commented, it is extremely tough. \u00a0I found it difficult to tear and chew. I guess I don't see the point. I noticed no one in our group accepted the offer of a second. \u00a0Our group seemed to think the food was fine. \u00a0Personally, I would probably not return. \u00a0When I dine out at these prices I am looking for something that I cannot or will not cook at home - a new experience. I am a pretty good home cook and I could have done a reasonable job of replicating my dinner, except for the pot de cr\u00e8me, without too much effort and a fraction of the cost. \u00a0That said, if you are looking for the experience that the chef aims to provide you will probably like Heartland."], ["Jennifer S.", "Review of their Farm Direct Market.We came to this place on Saturday evening after participating in the St. Paul Lowertown Art Crawl, wanting to see what looked good to possibly bring home to have a porch picnic. \u00a0Under their deli counter they had quite a nice selection of meats, cheeses, and a few pre-made salads. \u00a0One salad in particular looked freshly made; and it was. \u00a0It was also very good (we got a sample of it). \u00a0So good, in fact, that we bought some to include it in our post art-crawl porch picnic. \u00a0And the loaf of natural sourdough bread I bought was outstanding, albeit cost $5. \u00a0In their freezer, alongside pint containers of Izzy's Strawberry ice cream for $9, were pints of ice cream, sorbet and frozen yogurt made my Heartland (for $8).Want a container of pork fat or duck fat? \u00a0They've got it. \u00a0For $12 each. \u00a0They sell some local honey, homemade jams and catsups. \u00a0They've also got fresh produce attractively displayed in open bins. \u00a0Loved the look and feel of this shop. \u00a0Also enjoyed the friendly and informed service we received from the woman behind the counter."], ["Jack S.", "The smallish bowl of cassoulet came with about one inch of browned crackers on top.

I adore that they are passionate about farm to table eating..and they make everything but the cheese in house! How awesome is that! Their farm to market area was a hit! We picked up fresh and prepared items as well as 2 different kinds of canned ketchup. Everything was really reasonably priced which mad it even easier to bring things home to enjoy later. Dinner was top notch! Waiters were terrific and the food was so very thoughtful. We had a red gumbo that made me want to lick the bowl and my picky boyfriend also was super impressed. They gave us options of bread that were brought around and handed out individually which was nice (glad they aren't wasting food). My tenderloin with puree and sauce was as perfect as I can remember a entree being. It was just lovely...the most silky puree and sauce that made me scoop up every last bit. Meat was perfectly cooked. The BF had fish that was so crisp and fresh! I grew up on the lake and have had great fish but this might top them all. Dessert included a local grape sauce that was everything you would hope local food could be..in season...delish...and happy making. We also met Chef Russo and he was more than terrific to speak with...what a inspiring man! Really perfect night. A few things to note..many people were super dressed up but we came straight from a 5 hour drive so a little less fresh and everyone fit right in.Also my parents talked about thinking about going here a few weeks ago but not going because they were worried their wasn't enough options....let me reassure you that it isn't about what you get...because everything will be amazing.

After attending a membership meeting for the Saint Paul Chamber of Commerce at Heartland and hearing about how they only use local ingredients and make absolutely everything from scratch (including soy sauce!), I couldn't wait to come for dinner. There aren't many restaurants in MN that use strictly local ingredients, to the point that they don't even use olive oil at Heartland because you can't get olives locally, now that is commitment!The menu changes nightly depending on what ingredients they can get, so you will always \u00a0have something new to try. We started our meal with the amuse bouche of a savory zucchini bread with mascarpone whipped cream. It was an amazing little morsel of food. Our next course was the cheese soup with roasted broccoli. This was like a fancy, gourmet version of broccoli cheese soup. There was a great depth of flavor and it was perfectly creamy. I must also note that Heartland has impeccable service. We mentioned to our waitress that we were going to share the soup, and they split it for us into two bowls; such great attention to detail really makes the experience more memorable.For my entree, I ordered the whitefish and my hubs ordered the Duroc pork chop. I thought the fish was phenomal. It came with a wild rice crust and was topped with bok choy and cucumber. I normally hate cucumbers, but not these cukes, they were great! I had a bite of my hubby's pork chop and it was excellent, perfectly moist and served with a rich sauce made from their homemade soy sauce.Another nice touch is that the waitress actually came over to our table with a large bread basket. You don't see that too often. I had the wild rice and flax roll and it was excellent. Perfectly dense and it had great flavor. Even the butter tastes better at Heartland.We walked over to the market after dinner and picked up some homemade raspberry jam and a few cookies to bring home for dessert. The chocolate thumbprint cookie with chocolate ganache was excellent. Moist with a little crunch and the perfect amount of rich ganache.Heartland is definitely a winner and the perfect restaurant for a special occasion."], ["Suze S.", "The Man had some relatives coming in from California.

The atmosphere was perfect, we had a large table at the window overlooking the Farmer's Market, and service was great. The California folks were suitably impressed, and raved over the bottled wine prices.The food was terrific- everybody was ecstatic with their food- except me.

They have house made charcuterie, jams, stocks, soups and butter. Mmm butter. My favorite is the vast selection of pickled and jarred options. From pickled eggs that help cure a hangover to the absolute best sauerkraut I have ever had, Heartland does a great job of making their great products accessible to the public for use at home.The staff is very friendly as well, and completely knowledgeable about their products.

I had the pork chop, it was a big piece, and the meat was so tender and moist, not like how they prepare them in other places. \u00a0My husband had the roasted fowl breast with cranberries....exelleantly roasted with right balance of sweet and slaty with the cranberries working well with the whole dish - definitely a twist on classic thanksgiving dinner. \u00a0We also had a few small plates as appetizers to share, everything we had was good, even the dinner roll, specially made daily, crusty, flavorful. \u00a0The place is a bit spendy, however, if you've tasted the food, you would agree it's totally worth it."]], "Trung Nam French Bakery": [["Molly B.", "I'm sorry, I just don't get it.After hearing so many hyperbolic praises for Trung Nam's croissants, I decided it was finally time to give in and try them. I am always on the look out for a proper French croissant to have with a creamy cafe au lait. To my mind, this wasn't it.Sure, the croissant was what everyone describes in their reviews: slightly sweet, flaky. But it wasn't what I think of when I think of a croissant. Where was the golden brown exterior, glistening with butter? Where were the visible layers of butter pastry, staked on top of one another so they pull apart in sections? Instead, it was doughy and dry and too sweet -- I've only had flavored croissant that are sweet (chocolate, almond, etc), never a plain one and it wasn't what I wanted. Nothing like a proper croissant, which should look like this, from my experience: gregoiremichaud.com/wp-c\u2026Maybe I went in with expectations that were too high. Or maybe a croissant in Minnesota is just something different than what I am used to, and maybe they do THAT kind of croissant better than anyone else.

Their french bread and banh mi are also sold at various local asian supermarkets in the city so you know their stuff has to be good.

We went into the inconspicuous building and discovered a small bakery counter with glistening croissants, a coulple cookies, and crusty baguettes. By the time we got there they were out of a couple flavors of croissants, so if you want the maximum amount of choices, get there early. We each ordered a bahn mi and chocolate and apple croissants from a friendly and efficient girl working the register. Too excited to try it, we immediately ripped into the neatly wrapped sandwiches. I was amazed by how each perfectly portioned element contributed to the most well balanced sandwich I've ever had. The wonderfully crusty bread was the stand out, but the crispy pickled veggies, spicy jalopeno, and cool pate \u00a0After just two bites into this sandwich masterpiece, we knew we needed more. So we hopped on the bandwagon of all the other patrons and went in to grab another four sandwiches. Although I was really full from the HUGE bahn mi, the sweet tooth in me overpowered my already full stomach, and I needed to try some of a croissant. Honestly, I didn't know I liked croissants till I had one from Trung Nam. After one bite into the wonderfully light, flakey, and not too sweet croissant, I couldn't help but continue to eat. The minimal sweet apple filing was perfect, because the croissant itself was the star. All in all, I L.O.V.E.

The croissants are sinfully scrumptious: flaky, moist, buttery, rich. I've had the plain and almond versions. I usually get the canned soy milk (Yeo brand), which is a nice sweet complement to the spicy sandwiches. If you haven't had it before, I'd recommend giving it a try, though it has a more \"soybeany\" flavor and is sweeter than other popular soy milk brands like Silk. All this can be had for a steal. I went with two other friends last week and got two sandwiches, a croissant, and a soy milk for $11.

The almond croissant is about $1 - $2 more expensive than any other croissant or pastry they had. The croissant was quite tasty, being both super flaky and crunchy. A lot of croissants are often too soft, but this one definitely had a good balance of soft-on-the-inside and crunchy-on-the-outside. Nevertheless, I was a little bit sad that there wasn't more filling in the croissant. I'm used to almond croissants with a sugary almondy filling and was mildly disappointed that there wasn't much. There also doesn't seem to be a clear reason though why the almond croissant is more expensive than the other pastries... I'd definitely come back for a croissant, but probably not an almond one.The banh mi was good, even having some BBQ pork inside. Like the croissant though (this seems to be a theme...), there just wasn't enough filling!

Yes, but only on special occasions since the experience and pricing of their dishes weren't spectacular enough to warrant another casual visit."], ["Doug F.", "On an actually dark and stormy Wednesday night in mid-September my friend, A, \u00a0and I walked into Cafe Levain. \u00a0The restaurant is comprised of a single open room: warm, dark, welcoming. \u00a0The restaurant was mostly empty. \u00a0Service was gracious and attentive without being oleaginous and there was mostly excellent flavor to everything we ordered. \u00a0The wine list is small but has something for everyone and every price range, as long as your price range starts at around $30.We started with mussels and french onion soup. \u00a0The mussels were delicious; chunky croutons, flavorful tomatoes: finger licking good. \u00a0And the soup was tasty too. \u00a0But tasty in an institutional way. \u00a0Like maybe the stock was not made fresh.

The food is consistently fantastic. The French onion soup is a stand out on the menu. The ribeye is a perfect piece of meat and cooked with precision. This time we also had the root vegetable salad and brussel sprouts - both of which we loved. The servers are knowledgeable and conscientious. We didn't have reservations for a Saturday night but when I called the host said there was a place for us (6pm). By the time we left it was a full house and every other time it has been too."], ["Mark P.", "I went with two other people on a weekday evening, so we ended up being one of the two tables in the restaurant. Even so, the atmosphere in the restaurant is very welcoming, and the kitchen is in full view of the dining area (a feature I've come to appreciate in restaurants.) The service and food were out of this world. I'll admit that the two others I went with have been regulars for a few decades now, so the service was a bit above and beyond (multiple wine refills, free dessert) but you'd be hard-pressed to find a place like this anywhere else in the neighborhood. I had the spare ribs which were served in a house-made polenta. I don't know what they marinate those ribs in, but it might not be legal in the US because it is just to die for. Prices are a bit on the steep side, so it's more of a special occasion type of restaurant, but it's still certainly worth going. I'll certainly be back."], ["Victoria L.", "Cool place! Nice ambiance for a date. I expected the portions to be small due to this having a French Influence, but the entree portions are actually really big (enough to share). It's an open kitchen concept, which I love. The bread is to die for. You can't go wrong with the short ribs and French onion soup, the are the signature dishes and are both beyond amazing. One star deducted for a limited menu, not many options but you can't go wrong with anything on there. Bakery and pizzeria are next door and look like they are under the same ownership."], ["Jay H.", "Our friends are regulars, and we can see why. \u00a0Every dish we tried had fresh, top quality ingredients cooked to perfection. \u00a0I rarely order chicken at a restaurant, but the recommendation was dead on -- juicy white meat, crisp skin, on a bed of flavorful veggies and creamy potatoes. \u00a0Burger with short ribs was beefy delicious. \u00a0Service was top notch. \u00a0A great dining experience at a fair price."], ["Kay S.", "The atmosphere is very nice. We had 15 in our party and everyone was raving about their meal. The asparagus soup was awesome. I then had the vegetarian entr\u00e9e and it was the best I have ever eaten.

They sat the first couple the second table from a corner by a open doorway, then proceeded to sit us behind them - the restaurant was empty! So we asked for a different table and were accommodated.We started with an appetizer - mussels (eye-rolling delicious), and French Onion soup (perfectly made). For our entree we had lamb sausage (spicy, but just right), and beef short ribs (decadent!). Table service was wonderful; we haven't had such a lovely waitress in a very long time - not one did she refer to us as \"you guys,\" my biggest pet peeve!We will definitely go to Cafe Levain (just so you know-its down the block a bit \u00a0from Turtle Bread Co.)."], ["Arah B.", "I stopped by this place last evening, as I had some extra time in the area, and needed a meal and a semi-quiet place to try and do a little reading.

I had the red wine (a Bordeaux) that was on special, which held up a little better with my first course than with my second. First course: a curly endive salad. Second course: the mussels with a cream sauce and spicy sausage. I love mussels, and this delivered. My third course was unexpected but delicious: I think the chef behind the counter (I sat at the open-kitchen bar) took pity on a single diner, and donated a pumpkin cheesecake serving to my quiet cause. The place wasn't very busy, though as I left, it looked like the connected bakery had about half its tables full. I plan to return, with my husband. Soon.

Started with the jalapeno corn soup which was very yummy and then had the short ribs with sides of frites, spring vegetables and mushrooms.

The atmosphere is quaint and feels homey yet modern. About 20 tables perfect for a group of 2-4.But you didn't come here for the tables..or mirrors all around.The Sunday Supper at $25 is one of the best meals in town.- Sunchoke Soup: sounds...odd right? It's not, a perfect blend of turnip with chili oil, lemon, and a bit of cheddar. Not too bright, not too heavy. It's a nice start to the meal.- Chicory Salad: Another one where you look at the ingredients and think..uhm. sure why not? But instead, you dig in and all flavors come together like a puzzle. Some crunch with walnut, some sweet and tangy with the pickled cherry. Frisee's also adds some nice texture.- Truffle Pappardelle al Funghi: Levain took the item off the menu so I'm not sure if this is called but it definitely had truffle and funghi and pappardelle. Three of my favorite ingredients in life.A three course taster sounds small in portions but after it was all said and done, I was full and sleepy, perfect for a weekend cap.Go Sunday and enjoy my Yelper friends."], ["John W.", "My wife and I had not been back to Levain in several years. \u00a0I'm sorry we waited so long. \u00a0We had a late reservation on Valentine's Day and tried their Prix Fixe menu. \u00a0It was a bargain at only $35.00. \u00a0We both started with the Celery Root soup which was delicious. \u00a0My wife followed with the Swordfish while I had the tenderlion. \u00a0Both were prepared expertly. \u00a0Our server was perhaps the highlight of the evening and did a fantastic job. \u00a0next time we won't wait so long to come back."], ["Susan L.", "Two \u00a0years ago on an anniversary date, this place loved us and we loved it. \u00a0Three days ago on a pre-anniversary date, we had to break our love affair. \u00a0Levain, what happened?? \u00a0When did you become loud and boisterous? \u00a0When did your flavors fly away? \u00a0When did you stop caring about yourself?We started off with the mussels, which have always been good and thankfully, still are. I had the salmon and my husband had the hanger steak with pomme frites. \u00a0The hanger steak was okay (a little bit saltier than I think a hanger steak should be) and the pomme frites were not worth singing about. \u00a0I mean, they were okay, but I think the burnt taste got in the way of the potato taste.My salmon was more like a cod than a salmon. \u00a0Salmon is really easy to overcook especially when you have things on it. \u00a0I understand what they were trying to do, but really, they could have just stuck to the basics. \u00a0I think I had some truffle oil on one side of my plate and some beans and veggies on the plate. \u00a0When I couldn't eat my salmon any more and shoved it over, surprise! \u00a0I had more beans and veggies UNDER the salmon. \u00a0How could I have missed that? \u00a0Oh wait, I don't think I want to eat that.

I shook my head but he loved the steak. We weren't thrown out, despite wanting to let myself out after that. He loved the steak and the little fondue cheese it comes with. He was quite impressed.My mother and I ordered the chicken, which came atop kale, cucumbers and polenta. It was absurdly good. It makes store bought cooked rotisserie chicken taste like Elmer's Glue. The chicken was moist and the flavor combination was a perfect mix and temperature. My wife ordered the bucatini, being an italian food fan. It was spiced exceptionally well. Sorry Al Vento, this is a lot better.We shared some smashed potatoes, which are fingerling potatoes with a pea/scallion mix. They were very, very good-five stars good.Chef Adam Vickerman is a wizard and I hope Caf\u00e9 Levain lasts forever.

I ordered the onion soup for a starter - delicious, cheesey, and totally hit the spot. My husband ordered the heart of romaine salad which was fresh but nothing mind blowing - it's your basic romaine salad. For entr\u00e9e, I got the chicken and the mushrooms and polenta were definitely the highlight of the plate.

The ragout burger was also really good but the fries that came with it were WAY oversalted (and I love salt). They are doing cassoulet specials this month and my fiance had to duck cassoulet. This dish was not worth the money - the veggies surrounding the duck were bland and too rich and the whole dish was also oversalted.

We were early for our reservation, so we stopped at a book store across the street. It was nice to pass the time looking at the books. When we got to the restaurant, we were the only customers. It wasn't good weather, so we figured no one was going out. About an hour later, the place was almost full! We sat at a back table. It was warm and cozy. We had some wine/beer, and the mussels app to share. We also asked for a \"side\" of their mushroom polenta entree. They were very accommodating and gave us a generous portion to share as an app. The polenta was very creamy. MY DIL and I loved it. We said it was sure to have plenty of cream in it, with a nice amount of mushroom. The mussels were very good, but some of the shells had grit on the outside. We didn't notice until we were almost at the bottom of the pile. I mentioned it to the waitress so she could notify the chef. I didn't expect any comp because we had eaten almost the whole bowl. They took them off the bill. Very nice/classy!My son and I had braised short ribs. It was very tender and well seasoned. Perfect for a snowy night. My DIL had scallops. She thought they were very good.We had the bread pudding as recommended by the waitress. It had this cherry sauce with about 5 cherries in it. We each took one to try. We all said OMG, I have never tasted a cherry THIS GOOD! They said it was like a maraschino cherry, with a fresh cherry, with a candy cherry all rolled into one.

I had the scallops and ordered a side of the garlic pureed potatoes. Delish, both of them. Really looking forward to returning and seeing what new art they put on the menu. The only reason I'm giving it three stars instead of four is because of the really slow service that night.

Tasted my wife's Braised Beef Short Ribs and wished I'd ordered that (most tender rib meat I've had in a while).FYi: my Roast Chicken Breast was also delicious (and, yes, my wife had some!)Only slight negative was environmental. While munching on bread after being seated, we both heard what sounded like distant, muffled, chaotic screaming and yelling.We asked a server about it.

I had the coq au vin-agreed with the other comment that this didn't seem like *real* coq au vin, but it was tasty. Homemade noodles and bacon were a nice touch. Pumpkin bread pudding for dessert - really tasty, but didn't seem to be heated through all the way. BF had shortribs which were fantastic - just falling off the bone.

It sits unassumingly on 48th St behind a Turtle Bread Company on Chicago. Blink and you'll surely miss it. Pass a large garden and you most definitely have. Inside there is a long bar and plenty of tables - it's much bigger than it seems. We were seated promptly, but it took some time to see a waiter. Our server was nice, but he seemed distracted by a large party at the bar and as a result, our requests for drink refills, straws, bread, etc. took multiple tries. We started with the French onion soup to test the French bistro quality of the place. It was a good soup, served hot, with a rich broth, slice of baguette in the bottom of the bowl and plenty of cheese and onion straws on top. My mother-in-law and I opted for the short rib burger. It was such a unique offering, I couldn't resist. My husband got suckered into the swordfish when he learned they were just about out of it. He liked it, but it wasn't the most flavorful fish he had ever had.The short rib burger, on the other hand, was divine. Good combination of shredded short rib and beef. The burger had a nice flavor and was augmented by caramelized onions and a cheese sauce. It came with a ridiculously HUGE helping of frites (fries). I seriously couldn't even begin to make a dent, but I can't wait to dig back in at lunch today. The fries could have easily fed our whole table and then some. For desert, we sampled the butterscotch pudding. It wasn't as butterscotchy as I would have liked but the sea salt was a nice touch.

By far the best take on Eggs Benedict that I have ever had and I hate to admit I have had a lot of them over the years. We have been here for dinner and I must admit I don't remember what I had but I do remember I loved it every time.

Also the noodles were macaroni noodles. Not terrible, but not what I expected.Now. The service. I was disappointed. We came in at 1 and didn't leave until 2:20, which, for lunch, is a really long time. And it wasn't by choice. It seemed absurd that it took so long since the place wasn't so busy. When we came in our server told us that fresh bread was on the way, and we were very excited because FREE FRESH BREAD. But then no bread came. Our server came back and apologized, saying it was being baked and was on its way. We understood and continued to wait patiently. Then a manager (I assume) stopped by and asked if we needed anything. We simply said \"we're still waiting on the bread, but everything's great!\" and he was like \"coming right up!\". Then our meals came. So, no bread then? Oh, ok.Here's the thing. I wouldn't mind not getting any bread if they hadn't PROMISED that is was on the way. Really, stop teasing me! Just don't tell me there will be bread and then I won't expect it!Overall the food was good so I'll likely go back, preferably for dinner."], ["Angie S.", "We were in line at a restaurant that was over an hour wait. \u00a0We walked over to Salut and I couldn't have been happier with the choice.We sat patio and the groups of people were great. \u00a0You can lease up your pup while you eat or just sit with friends. \u00a0The wait wasn't long and we were greeted and surved right away. \u00a0Whatever place serves popovers needs to get a 5 start by default!I ordered the Chicken and Artichoke Crepes and they were so delicious with great flavor. \u00a0The brunch is great and one of the freshest brunches I have had in a while! \u00a0Absolutely check this place out!"], ["Christy N.", "6 of us came in for dinner last Saturday night. \u00a0I've been here for work lunches and a happy hour or two during the week and it's always been... fine. \u00a0Given the mixed dinner reviews I was a little nervous.We arrived about 10 minutes prior to our reservation and we ended up scoring a table in the bar because it just happened to clear. \u00a0The bar was a madhouse and I do have to say, \"Really? 4 tables in the bar?

I would have liked more gravy and for the cheese curds to be melted into the fries a little more.For being so close to Canada, I think these were a surprising \"miss\".Hearing that they are famous for the burgers, we got one of those. It's a riff on Minnesota's national sandwich, the Juicy Lucy (cheese injected inside the patty).I could tell the meat was high quality, which was nice, but I wouldn't go out of my way to order it again. Maybe the Lucy isn't meant for haute cuisine, as I felt the gooey cheese just overshadowed the delicious patty. Guess I'll stick with the dive bars for my next Lucy fix.The lamb shank was decent, but was lacking that special oomph I had hoped for.I did like that without asking they split the wine bottle 7 ways on the check.

One of Lonny's closest friends presently tends bar, another is a chef. Lonny knows the ways of the service industry. So when Lonny complains about service, best believe the service has to be especially horrendous. And boy, was this service especially horrendous. Our bartender was inattentive, curt, poured our beers sloppily, and generally seemed put out by our presence. Now, to be fair, the bartender I'd had two other times was wonderful, and my waitress the time I ate in the dining room was fine. I didn't catch either bartenders' names, but the wonderful bartender had kind of a crewcut, was tall, personable, all around excellent. But the horrendous one... yeesh. I remember little about him except he had glasses. And he was so awful that my rating almost went all the way down from 4 or 5 stars to 2. THAT BEING SAID: The food I've had here, in general, has been 4 and 5 star level every time with the exception of the flatbread.

(See pictures)- Duck wings: These were really good and saucey. It reminded me of the wings I grew up on (duck wings are a common Chinese food), and it definitely had an Asian taste on these with the bulgogi. Albeit, these are saucier (maybe to make it more like BBQ wings?)- The Vincent Burger: The burger was better than average- juicy and moist. I wasn't a huge fan of the shoestring fries though.- Louis Xv: It's a hazelnut chocolate cake served with a pear poached in wine and I'm a stickler for a good pear. Hence, I'm pleased to say that this pear was quite good! The wine that it was poached in was noticeable, so it added a good flavor to it.

Finally got around to it tonight, at the suggestion of my girlfriend. Being a smart person, she'd noticed that they had a reasonably-price prix fixe during \"Restaurant Week,\" and it seemed like a good opportunity.As others have noted, the sliced baguette is really nice. Great texture and served slightly warm.Our first course was solid, with a savory/sweet salad for her and a well-balanced root vegetable soup for me. I felt that the broth was legit, if perhaps in need of just a bit of salt. The vegetables in question were good and earthy, and there were bits of intensely-flavored duck. If the ratio had skewed slightly towards the duck, this would have been a real home run.My gal seemed to enjoy her poached Steelhead, which came with crushed nuts, some root vegetables, and a little hazelnut (walnut? I dunno, I forget. It was nut-related, somehow) oil. I enjoyed the bite she shared with me. Braised short rib was my choice, which came with savoy cabbage, roasted carrot, and fried onion. I was really pleased. The dish was hearty without being heavy, and even had some nice fresh herb flavors in the mix. Overall, a highly flavorful and fork-tender piece of beef, with some excellently-balanced supporting players. Now, I probably couldn't distinguish authentic French food from French Toast, but ladyfriend has been over there a couple of times. She was of the opinion that VIncent A Restaurant was bringing the goods.We had braised prunes and ice cream for dessert, which I enjoyed more than I would have anticipated. I'm no big fan of prunes, as they are just too richly sweet for my tastes. But they worked pretty well in this setting, perhaps because the serving was no larger than it needed to be: a couple of prunes, a bit of (pound?)cake, and a dollop of ice cream. Flavor combinations aside, I can really get behind the trend towards smaller, SANER desserts.The service, from start to finish, was great. We were greeted warmly and seated promptly. Our buspeople were alert and unobtrusive. Our waiter was charming and present, despite handling multiple tables, and without being annoying/cloying. He earned extra points by putting in some extra effort (involving some intense plate balancing) in order to clear our crumbs, without breaking a sweat. Sadly, you don't see that level of service in some of our finer dining establishments, anymore. I've eaten at many places that are more hyped/pricey than Vincent where such rituals are forgotten, so this was appreciated.All in all, I think we both enjoyed ourselves and will put this place on the \"definitely do it again\" list."], ["Jason T.", "Hmm... I'm not too sure about Vincent. First things first, I came here with friends during Restaurant Week. The menu was fixed and I ordered the poached eggs with shrimp and shrimp broth, as my main course. It sounded fancier than that on the menu and I was expecting something special. Instead, all I got was poached eggs, boiled asparagus, cut shrimps, shrimp broth (more like foam) and some veggies - LITERALLY. And it tasted like the way it looked, bland and ordinary. I was quite disappointed. My other friend had the pork tenderloin salad and it was literally several slices of pork tenderloin on a bunch of veggies - also very bland. Dessert, however, was a tad more special. I had the orange marmalade (which came with a biscuit, peppered cheese, bread and nuts). It tasted alright. But my friends who got the nutella Crepes said that it was really delicious, but otherwise quite normal. Service, on the other hand, was a mixed bag. As they were understaffed that day, it took them slightly longer to sit us and even longer to take our order. Will I come back again? Maybe."], ["Jeff Jfood S.", "At my last visit to Vincent's over four years ago I was not impressed with the Vincent Burger. But four years later I am glad I returned because the burger I recently ate was one of the best burgers I have eaten in the Twin Cities.To start my lunch I ordered a Caesar salad. It was a standard salad with lettuce, croutons, a single anchovy filet on top plus an interesting addition, diced tomato, all topped with a sprinkling of grated cheese. It was lightly dressed and good, not great nor memorable.But I was interested to either confirm my previous impression of the hamburger or enjoy what others have told me is one of the best. I was both excited and cautiously optimistic when it was placed in front of me. The Vincent burger is a unique combination...a double-patty of ground beef is wrapped around braised short rib and smoked Gouda cheese; served on a brioche bun; it is a haut cuisine version of a Jucy Lucy. It arrives open faced with French fries. The burger patty was on one side of the bun that contained a thin layer of \"special sauce\" and the other half is topped with lettuce, tomato and raw onion. The ground beef was perfectly seasoned with just a touch of salt. The Gouda was melted and delivered a creaminess to the burger and then the short rib textures and flavors kicked in. This elevated the Vincent Burger from excellent to incredible. The brioche added a little butteriness to the presentation and the sauce gave a few sour background notes. The burger was incredibly delicious. The fries were not in the same league. They were tasteless, cool and bland, more than likely came from a big frozen bag, deep fried and added to the lunch plates. They are the only reason this is 4 and not 5 stars.Overall, the Vincent Burger is an outstanding combination of flavors and textures and ranks as one of the best in Minneapolis."], ["William C.", "I've been to Vincent twice, once for lunch and once for dinner.During my most recent visit, we had the Lobster Bisque, Mushroom Risotto, Pan Seared Beef Tenderloin and the Cassoulet. \u00a0The bisque was amazing!!! \u00a0Full of flavor and real lobster; extremely smooth and the flavor wasn't TOO sharp like you find in other lobster bisque.The beef tenderloin was very well done. \u00a0The braised onions and bordelaise sauce was a great combination with the tenderloin; of course, it was cooked to perfection.I had the Cassoulet, which is a Southwestern French dish. \u00a0It's made with Tarbais white beans, preserved duck, ham and two kinds of sausage. \u00a0The flavor was excellent! \u00a0It was not gamy and the beans added a nice texture to the meat; the beans actually carried a ton of flavor after the dish was baked.An overall wonderful experience. \u00a0Our server that evening was amazing and extremely friendly :-)"], ["Alicia M.", "Great meal and great service.

The Vincent Burger -- probably my 3rd favorite burger in the Twin Cities at this point -- goes from $14 to $8! And it comes with their delicious shoestring fries.

I'm not sure if I'll return any time soon, but this restaurant is worth a visit."], ["Greg D.", "Went to Vincent with my mother and some family friends, not a mother's day event but close enough. The space is very open and inviting. We were there on a Friday at 7 and I was surprised that the there were only a few other parties there and the Bar was empty. Service was friendly but could have been a bit more attentive.Drinks were well made and tasty. I like a cold vodka martini and this one came with just that hint of slush floating in it that let's you know it is perfectly cold. The other mixed drinks our party had were equally well made. The bread basket was a crusty french loaf that was some of the best bread I have eaten recently, especially in the Twin Cities. Crusty and fresh with soft butter. I had the escargot which was excellent and the parsley butter left in the little cups was fantastic with the bread. For my main course I had the rib eye steak which cam with fingerling potatoes and a tomato confit and purple mustard. The steak was cooked perfectly the potatoes were smooth and buttery. The mustard was tasty but there was not enough of it. The others in our party had the lamb shank, which made me regret ordering the steak and scallops which also looked fantastic. Deserts were rich and beautiful, the Port I tried was a great end to a great meal.I will definitely be going back to Vincent some time soon."], ["Jason Y.", "Yeah I love their \"Vincent Burger\". \u00a0Ground up beef short ribs and smoked gouda inside! \u00a0Wow. \u00a0Best burger I have ever had! \u00a0Service was great and the place itself is a pretty high end joint! \u00a0Check them out! \u00a0Quality here! \u00a0I will be going back again and again!"], ["Paola M.", "I finally came here on a late night after having snaked at another place, so we only had a couple of smaller dishes which we shared.I will go back to try more and write a more comprehensive review, but I have to tell the world how great their steak tartare! I loved it. First it is properly ground, probably manually, so it has some texture. Then it is seasoned to perfection and comes with the customary raw egg. And finally it is big enough to be a real meal. It is possibly the best tartare I ever had.Will be back to try the rest of the menu."], ["Carolyn A.", "I've yet to make it to Vincent for dinner, but I have enjoyed quite a few lunches and happy hours here.LUNCH: I LOVE the crepes special. \u00a0I've almost always ordered whatever the crepe of the day was and the last time I was there, it was with an awesome cheesy/mushroom filling. \u00a0With the small side salad that was included, it makes the perfect indulgent lunch.HAPPY HOUR: There are so many fun things about this happy hour: sidewalk patio for when it's nice out, poutine, marinated olives, good drink specials like $4 glasses of wine and more. \u00a0 But the kicker is that on HH, the famous Vincent burger (stuffed with short ribs and gouda) and fries is a steal at $8 (regularly priced at $14). \u00a0My only advice is to get there at the early end of HH as the bar does typically fill up quickly, especially on Thursdays and Fridays."], ["Dan S.", "Lorae and I have been talking about coming here for a long time and finally came in for happy hour on Thursday with a friend of mine. \u00a0The dining room is pretty fancy, we sat at a bar table in the bar section. \u00a0Their late night happy hour is 8:30-9:30, which is a pretty good time for me, most places have the after work happy hour, which doesn't help someone who usually works until 6:30 or 7. \u00a0Or they will \u00a0have a 10 o'clock happy hour, which gets to be a little late on a school night. The Vincent burger is $8 during happy hour. \u00a0I liked the burger, it has braised short ribs inside and a creamy Gouda cheese. \u00a0It is a fancy burger, but still substantial. \u00a0$3 beers is a good deal, most places have their special on the cheap beer, but Vincent has 7-8 beers on special, all of them premium beers. \u00a0The bar was full of finicky cougars, dressed up for a girls night. I'm sure they had no luck, they were kind of whiny and loud."], ["John H.", "I have dined here multiple times and have enjoyed it each time.Ambiance is top notch.Food quality is above average (grass fed, local farms etc)Food execution is spotty (oversalted more than once)Service is top notchThere are some innovative appetizers here.Prices are what they are."]]}
