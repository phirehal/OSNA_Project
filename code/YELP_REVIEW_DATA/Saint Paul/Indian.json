Looking over the menu I was surprised to see they have a pretty wide selection of entrees. We ordered Chana Masala, Saag Paneer, Chicken Tikka Masala and Ginger Chicken. Every dish was amazing! Some Indian restaurants \"Americanize\" their food by cutting most of the spices and making everything bland. The food here was perfect. Just the right amount of flavor and heat.

I was absolutely in love with the murgh shorba and would make special trips just to get a bowl. It was creamy, rich and loaded with tender chicken... I can still taste it when I think of it and my mouth waters.Sadly, it and many other things have changed. The soup has turned into this overly thick, hamburger helper tasting concoction that is overloaded with unpleasant chunks of dry chicken. The first time I ordered this soup and ended up with this, I thought they were just having an off night. My worst fears were confirmed when I realized that it was a permanent disservice.As mentioned, however, the soup isn't the only thing that has undergone a transformation. Their curries were always outstanding. I could've been stuffed and I'd still lick the spoon clean after happily loading the leftovers into containers.Their thai coconut curry with chicken was, by far, my favorite.It has gone the way of the murgh shorba. I couldn't even stomach two bites... the entire dish smelled (and rather tasted) absolutely terrible. The chicken was very overcooked and sitting in an odd colored creamy sauce that reeked of burnt rubber. When I told the waiter he said it was because they \"roasted the spices\". \u00a0For the record of the readers of this post, my girlfriend also smelled and tasted the curry and recoiled in disgust. She agreed on the burnt rubber aspect of the dish.Ugh.My girlfriend and I used to absolutely love coming here... it was one of our \"date night\" restaurants, actually. The atmosphere remains very pleasant despite the changes in the food and the staff is always extremely polite. But a restaurant without edible food is like a hotel with no rooms.

In giving the new place a chance, I ordered some food for take-out. My first response was it was ok, but not nearly as fragrant or flavorful as Sambol. Although my friends refer to me regarding \u00a0Indian food, they are curious as well. One friend took advantage of a Groupon deal to try it out. Just to clarify, isn't the idea of a Groupon supposed to help businesses promote themselves?? My friend invites me along and we go on a Wednesday evening. This time the food has improved. However, when the bill comes, the owner walks over to ask for the Groupon (kinda like he's mad that we have one), rings it up and adds gratuity. I don't mean to assume, but aren't 18% gratuities sometimes added for parties of 6-8 or more? We had intended to tip on the \"total amount\" like we are asked to by Groupon, but whatever. As we finish our drinks and conversation, the owner walks over and asks if there is anything else he can do for us, otherwise can we please take our conversation to the waiting area so that they can have our table for other customers? Apparently, he felt people were swarming the restaurant to get in on this Wednesday evening. We look around and there is no one at the door, four empty tables around us, and about four more on the other side of the restaurant. Are you kidding me?!

We were pleased that the doors were open; we didn't get stuck standing in the cold. I've probably eaten at 50 Indian restaurants, and this one had some menu items I hadn't seen before. We tried the dosa, a crepe with a filling similar to those of samosas, as an appetizer and were impressed. I was similarly pleased with my entree of nellore fish curry, accompanied with rice and garlic naan. It had a good kick to it, and the fish was plentiful. My dining partner was less pleased with her chicken chettinadu, which she hadn't expected to include bones. It was gristly and wasn't as spicy.The menus we were given didn't mention that any non-alcoholic drinks were available. They were, and we enjoyed our mango lassis.The bad: Service was slow, which I attribute partly to the fact that we arrived a little before the restaurant reopened. Had the servers and food each arrived a few minutes earlier than they did, this place would be closer to five-star territory.As for the strip-mall location, now I know better than to judge.

Will DEFINITELY be back!"], ["Gabriel D.", "\"Meh, I've experienced better.\" Designated under the 2 Stars selection is pretty accurate.I have been to MANY Indian Restaurants, probably about a dozen in MN and a few more across the US; lunch buffets and a la carte. \u00a0This one, I had high hopes for, and at first seems great, but it falls short.Here's the main reason: not very authentic. To credit the manager who seems to come around and ask people how they like the food, they do use less overall flavor/spices/herbs/seasonings due to a \"Midwesterner's palate \". \u00a0On top of that, the quality of ingredients used are very poor; the paneer for example is premade and ordered in giant sheets and chopped up. \u00a0Probably the worst thing that is keeping me from coming back is this: the manager actually said that for the TANDOORI CHICKEN, a staple which even tastes very off (overly sweet like a Chinese buffet \"chili lime sauce\" and has limes and a sweet gooey glaze on it- yuck), apparently has KETCHUP put into it. \u00a0As someone who appreciates Indian food for the type of seasonings used and lack of artificial crap thrown in there, I don't really enjoy having that stuff added. \u00a0Here's an important thing to that as well: most ketchups have high fructose corn syrup AND corn syrup and gluten-derived additives... so if you go in there, and expect your classic tandoori chicken to be gluten free and free of sugar and gmo-crap your wrong!-besides that, that is NOT how tandoori chicken should taste!Further, I have come on multiple occasions and days to give it a chance, but authenticity is laughable. What are \"spring rolls\" doing on the line? \u00a0They are clearly from a package and heated; \u00a0the milk balls are not good, and the rice pudding that is even labeled to have pistachios, I have yet to find one ever.Warning: I have come across undercooked meat balls (beef and lamb), and these break apart easily due to the fattiness/quality of the meats.Not very many vegan dishes either. To their credit, gluten-free dishes are labeled, but not diary-free of vegan. \u00a0Oil is not fresh and everything is fried in the same oil as well, so don't expect anything to truly but gluten-free. \u00a0The pakora does apparently use chickpea flower, but the naan bread is all-purpose... which is really disappointing. \u00a0Also, the fats used in curries are vegetable oil (not too healthy when cooked with high temps) and butter is used as well- same issue. No ghee apparently as said by chef. FYI: Ghee vs. Butter. 1) Great for cooking: Ghee does not contain milk solids and it is very stable at high heat. Because of its high smoke point (~485 \u00b0F), it is considered one of the best oils for baking, saut\u00e9ing and deep fat frying. \u00a0The manager tried to tell me butter and vegetable oil is healthier. NOT the case, and ESPECIALLY for those who are sensitive to dairy.Simple fixes: take the overly sweet sauces out of the mix. Use better quality ingredients (local does not always mean better) and actually make the food taste (from a seasoning perspective) authentic. Maybe include pistachios in a dish that is said to have it. Also, all the curries and the rice dessert is overly saucy compared to every other Indian place (including other India Palaces)Bottom line: if you are ignorant about authentic Indian food, and do not care about trans-fats or hydrogenated oils or fats that are oxidized or unnatural sugar being added to your food and just want cheap, badly greasy, Americanized Indian food, go here; you will get that and a bunch of smiles that will make you think you are experiencing some \"exotic\" delights!-Everything is overly sweet and has syrups added to it in a bad way.-Lots of food sits out for a while-Curries are overly runny, and break down and you end up with little bits of food amongst \"curry\" water, not even \"soup\"-The naan bread is brought out fresh, but due to the ingredients turns into cardboard after cooling rather than the expected constant doughy goodness.-tandoori chicken has ketchup added to it, which you can bet has corn syrup and high-fructose corn syrup in it, and hence is overly sweet and just off-tasting. -Odd things like Asian buffet spring rolls appear on the line-The salad is sad and wilted.-Waiters do not understand you when you ask \"what kind of tea is your hot tea\"-the saag paneer is a highlight and actually exceptional, but is a little sweet if you savor the bite and feel through the tastes, and the cheese is not from a good source.-gluten-free labels are nice but there is a major issue with the fryer and oils causing cross contamination.-not a very clean kitchen.-chicken pieces in dishes are dry and flavorless. I am a carnivore by nature but found myself not wanting to eat them as they are just Styrofoam and forgettable.I probably will not be back as there are MANY other places that use better ingredients (fresh, local, organic, better oils), authentic, are cleaner, and put out better overall dishes that don't break down and lack in seasonings.

It's pretty small inside so if it's cold be prepared to wait, but if the patio is open it still has that tiny little cafe feel. I love the summery feeling of having delicious, but not excessive amounts of Indian food under adorable little globe lights with the hustle and bustle of uptown as the view. The service is always so courteous, but it's a small kitchen and bar so things will be moving slow, but not intolerably so. If I were a guy deliberating on where to take a girl on our first date and I was looking in Uptown, hands down it would be here.The dishes are perfectly portioned for a reasonable meal, so if you are super hungry you will probably want to start with an appetizer. The garlic paratha is a flakey bread that is wonderful for dipping in all their flavorful sauces and makes for a good starter. My favorite though has to be the bison mamacha which comes with six little warm dumplings.For dinner I always get the vegetarian mushroom and tofu curry with peas. There is just something about the coconut balance in this sauce that I cannot get enough of, especially at spice level 5. That's right, Namaste Cafe gets my nod of approval for making any dish amazingly hot without compromising flavor. This is a rarity in pepper-averse Minnesota, so heat lovers rejoice! It's a slow build, but it won't disappoint. To finish off I had the super creamy mango margarita. It was so thick with fruitiness it was almost seemed more like a dessert smoothie than a drink.

If you are looking for something basic with not very much variation of produce in a dish, and rely on the flavor, this is your spot. I am the type of person who likes a variety of veggies in my dish, so it was disappointing to see that the menu is limited in that way. I left feeling as though I didn't get a full meal, lack of protein options for vegetarians who don't eat from the legume family: tofu, beans, lentils.

Aside from that burning blunder on my part, I really liked my last meal here (I ordered delivery from BiteSquad). It had been years since I'd eaten at Namaste, though I do love that patio something fierce. I was craving potatoes the other week (odd, I know), and specifically the kind of potatoes that come inside a masala dosa. Their spicy fried potatoes are a must, though they are a bit different from what I had been craving originally. They are cooked with turmeric oil, cumin, paprika, cayenne, ginger and garlic. SO savory. I could've downed three big orders myself.The Goan fish curry is a spicy stew with grated coconut and poppy seeds. It comes from my own Portuguesey-Indian people. I was expecting MN hot, so I ordered it extra hot and almost died. Never again---the flavor was in there somewhere, but somewhat buried under hot chilies. I ended up having to put out the fire by swallowing my pride and adding a whole can of coconut milk at home. Who have I become?! As I said, it's been a while since I've been here but I also remember the chai and the momos being top notch too. The menu is nontraditional in comparison to other Nepalese or Indian restaurants. You'll still see old favorites, but slightly sexier. Like bison momos and rather inventive chaat. The menu is also really well-labeled if you have dietary restrictions (vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.).Happy hour is from 3-6 daily and they also do a Tuesday date night for $35 (two entrees, bottle of wine, dessert) and 1/2 price wine nights on Mondays. I will return for one (or all) of those occasions soon. However, not sure that I'll order the fish curry again.

BLAND. BLAND.\" I have tried several dishes here, a couple being the Chole (more commonly known as Chana Masala), Aloo Bodi, and Cauliflower, Peas & Potatoes. Each time, the only thing I could taste was the heat (levels 2-3). I love spicy foods, but they have to have flavor. I also got the Garlic Paratha, which was equally flavorless (where the garlic at?), and overpriced, considering you only get one thin piece, when most Indian places give you at least two -- not to mention, with dipping sauces.The only reason I am giving Namaste two stars instead of one is because of the ambiance. It has a great outdoor porch and patio, complete with a nice touch of lanterns/garden lighting and a great people watching view of Hennepin Avenue just outside the heart of Uptown. The inside is cozy and \"homey\" without feeling homely. The service is also decent. So, if you're willing to sacrifice flavor for an enjoyable environment, by all means, go.

The food offerings are your typical Indian buffet food: rice, naan, some vegetarian options, a couple chicken dishes, and a lamb option (yum). There is also a small salad bar and dessert. Empty plates are taken away promptly by the waitstaff, and water is refilled often.

Many years ago Sam asked me to dine with him and I agreed, but he wasn't expecting the meal to turn out so... romantic. We were \"just friends\" at the time and when we walked into the restaurant the dim candlelight, linen table cloths, soft music and abundance of adult couples became apparent. I thought for sure this was a set up and the look of embarrassment and nervous sweats beading off Sam's forehead was so adorable that I stopped caring how awkward it was. We laughed and joked while Sam offered me different types of dishes, most of which I hated, but he didn't know at the time that I don't care for lamb. \u00a0Despite that, I'll forever have fond memories of Indian food for the simple fact that it reminds me of that evening every time I eat it.Fast forward to more recent years; Indian food makes a semi regular appearance on our menu and India Palace is where we love to go to get it. The service at this particular restaurant has always been not only good but reliably good. The waiters and waitresses make appearances at only the appropriate times, not when our mouths are full. They talk quietly and calmly when taking your order and always get it right. I've never encountered a rude person waitstaff or even one that stand around with their thumb in their ass looking bored. The tables turn quickly and the restaurant is always clean. The food is great. I've tried a multitude of dishes here, some better than others but they're always cooked well, served neatly and always the exact way you ordered it. \u00a0My favorite so far is the Chicken Malai, but almost everything else I've had is a close second. The mint chutney is a spicy but fresh compliment to any dish you order. The wine is a good price so if you have the craving for a glass just go ahead and get it. The chai tea is hot and loaded with Indian Spices (I add sugar to sweeten it up).There's not a bad thing I could say about India Palace and the rich warm flavors are perfect for a cold winter's day."], ["Kara D.", "I have only been here once, so far, to grab lunch to-go from their buffet. When I arrived, I paid at the register ~$10 to get a container to fill from the buffet. At first I was like, \"ugh, all these jerks get to enjoy AYCE but I only get one plate\". I was honestly worried that I wasn't getting the same value as the customers dining in because I am cheap and internally obese. But the container they gave me was of ample size and compartmentalized, and it ended up being two large lunches-worth for me. Plus they give you a fresh batch of naan, complimentary. And the employees are really freaking nice there.I cannot recall all of the names, so please refer to the photo I posted as I describe the dishes by compartment and color of mush:- \"Try the grey stuff, it's delicious\"? F the grey stuff, try the green stuff. The dish in the top left corner of my tray was my favorite. It had tender chicken in a creamy and herb-y sauce (predominantly cilantro).- There is a small compartment perfect for condiments, which made me more joyous than I think is normal to be over condiment compartments. I filled it with spicy mint chutney.- The bottom left of my tray contained 2 entrees: what I would call the Indian chicken nugget, cooked in a creamy light curry. Another new favorite. And of course, palak paneer found its way to my face, per usual. - There was a bone-in tandoori type chicken as well (bottom right).- And of course, basmati rice. I threw in a few Indian \"pickles\" too somewhere in those heaps.This will be my new work lunch hot-spot, I just know it."], ["Dua X.", "I was skeptical about trying out this place because I've had negative experiences with Indian food in the past but this place blew my mind! First of all the service was exceptional! Our server along with all of the other servers in the restaurants were friendly and helpful. We went in a large group and they were very patient with us. To top it all off the food was fantastic! Everything was made hot and fresh! The wait wasn't very long at all either considering it was a Saturday night and it was quite busy. The Naan bread was so yummy and fresh along with everything else we ordered. I had the Chicken Josh and I would totally recommend it! Everyone at our table loved it! Awesome place!

First and foremost, I generally steer clear of buffets for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to the fact that I generally prefer food that hasn't been aged in steam trays for hours, my general lack of will power and the inevitable food coma that generally follows said fits of overindulgence. With that said, I likes me some India Palace. The buffet itself isn't too large, but is generally comprised of a number of dishes that appeal to both vegetarians and carnivores (e.g., various curries, palak paneer, tandoori chicken, etc.), naan, a green salad, mango pudding and a couple of chutneys. Due to its modest size and popularity dishes are restocked quickly, so the food is generally pretty fresh from the kitchen.The staff are generally friendly and while the strip mall ambiance isn't anything special, it's a solid place to eat way too much over the noon hour."], ["Samuel W.", "We found ourselves here last night, coming off the heels of an absolutely miserable experience at Everest on Grand, and it occurred to me that my previous review was one of my early ones. As 'early' is code word for 'shitty, brief and underwhelming', I thought it prudent to revisit India Palace in a manner more befitting of its charms. The location hasn't changed, clearly--it's still situated in a small strip mall, coddled firmly by its suburban surroundings--but it's fairly easy to forget that once you're inside and encapsulated by the warm aroma of spices. Let's break it down into two sections.______Service: The wait staff work tirelessly here, constantly maintaining a clean environment and tending to guests with a smile. The service, though quick, is not rushed in the sense you feel as though they're trying to musket pump you out the door at their earliest convenience. Truthfully, as I take stock of the stellar staff interactions we've had here over the span of two and a half years, I'm compelled to easily give them five stars on that front. ______Food:I've said it before and I'll say it again:Great food can outweigh bad service, but great service can't outweigh bad food.Thankfully, you won't have to endure either of them being terrible here.Now, while I cannot rightly vouch for the 100% unwavering authenticity of the eats here (whyte 4 lyfe), I can definitely attest to the food having the 100% tasty 'I need dis' factor.As is the case with most cuisine of this nature, the spice level can be adjusted to your liking. I've always admittedly gone for mild (not because I can't withstand heat, but because I want to wallow unimpeded in the comfort of a sweet, rich, creamy sauce) so I'm not entirely sure if they're grading on a Minnesota curve. I've had 90% of the appetizer menu and I find myself partial to the Mix Pakora, the Tawa Paneer, the Samosas and the Paneer Pakora, all of which have excellent flavors and never fail to impress. The Palace Platter contains most of them and is a good way to sample a large variety without breaking the bank at a price of ten bucks. The naan bread here is great, too, and I recommend both the garlic and paneer varieties. It's hot, chewy (not frail and crispy like I've had elsewhere) and serves as an excellent complement to sop up the sauce from the entrees. I love paneer. Like... deeply love paneer. I'm a huge carnivore and I've been known to order off the vegetarian menu (Palak Paneer, Matar Paneer, Paneer Makhani) just to get my fix.Thankfully for me, though, they're more than happy to add it to any dish and I frequently have it tossed into the Chicken Kashmiri, Chicken Curry and Chicken Makhani. All of them have that thick, sumptuously creamy sauce I'd shamelessly clothesline a hobo to get my hands on.Their tandoori specials are certainly worth mentioning, too; the meat is always tender, juicy and sizzling when it finds its way in front of you.Again... five stars. ______Another cool thing that merits mentioning is the fact that they're open ALL day now as opposed to shutting down briefly from 2:30-5:00. This is odd, indeed, for an Indian restaurant and certainly something we'll be capitalizing on in the future.So... if you've had bad/borderline nightmare experiences elsewhere *insert still fresh scowl here*, come be comforted in a warm curry blanket at India Palace."], ["Toby S.", "Good Indian food in a strip mall?

I wanted to get some Indian lunch buffet before heading to Rainbow and Target (which are basically right across the street) for some errand-running, and came out a bit disappointed. Wednesday lunch buffet was $10.72 including tax for one person. When you enter there seems to be two sides of the restaurant. Right down the middle is the table where they put the buffet line. To the left, in the front, is an area where I'm guessing their live music is played when there is live music. The left side of the room appears to be more for 2-person tables while larger groups would sit on the right. They did try with their decor. There's an obvious Indian flair combined with its industrial setting, which can be charming if you look at it the right way. There is a bar which is a bit untraditional. There were about 10 dishes and 2 desserts. From what I can remember, dishes included:Salad (shredded lettuce, shredded carrots, the usual)Cold potato salad (Indian style, with parsley, yogurt)NaanBasmati rice (plain & with peas)Spicy chili chickenTandoori chickenSaag with beansMixed veggie curryLentil curryMock meat curryThe desserts included:Rice puddingCoconut pudding of sortsI was disappointed there weren't more curry varieties - lamb, tikka masala, etc. And what was there wasn't very good in quality. The chicken in both the chili chicken and tandoori were dry and difficult to chew. The veggie curry was good but was obviously using frozen veggies. The mock meat curry was essentially fried gluten (frozen or in a can) put into curry. The desserts were good and were a good end to the meal, but for the price I would've better quality, better variety. And although I didn't mind, if you're on a date or business meeting, I found it surprising that they gave me my bill when I was still working on my first plate (about 10 minutes after having been seated)."], ["John C.", "Please be advised this review comes from someone with very little experience with Indian food:The curries, bismati rice, fresh flatbread and samosas are excellent. \u00a0I highly recommend the lunch buffet as a way to find out what you like if you are a newbie. \u00a0Hard to fault the waitstaff if they can't explain what \"vindaloo\" tastes like but you can usually talk them into bringing out a small sample if you really want to know.Looks like this place used to be two different businesses so if you find the live music to be annoying you can always sit on the other side and ignore it."], ["Jessica B.", "You must eat here it is delicious and the staff is friendly!

First of all, this is not my first time here. Ive been here at least 4/5 times before. Yes they \"had\" great food. Interior need a total renovation before people starts getting sick by dead skins and dust all over.Floors are greasy.Servers and Hosts are arrogant. The lighting is dark so that it hides blemishes, too late. I ordered Lamb kebab, Rogan Josh, 2 Naans, Order of Beef samosa and mango lassi.Lamb Kebab: It didnt have any flavors, simply grilled. no spices. people go to indian restaurants with expectation of indian spices. THis kabab was Bland. Also the onions that came with didnt seem to belong. Rogan Josh: Indian Food is all about spices and aromas. they put a lot of ingredients and yes they cook it for long time.My rogan josh was undercooked. I could bite gingers and garlic. No execration, Me and my wife felt sick afterwards. Beef samosas were Small, i mean very small. 5 bucks for two beef stuffed ping pong balls were not even tasty. It kinda tasted sandy. and they were over fried.Server: My server was Jamil. Okay, here is the fun part. I asked my server if they had any change in the kitchen, or any new chef, He said : No. we still have the same chef. Is everything okay?Me: I came today just to have the Lamb kebab, because it was really good last time. it seems to be bland now.Server: This is how the lamb Kebabs are.Me: And the Rogan josh seems undercooked. I think the spices are still raw.Server: This is How rogan Josh is.SERIOUSLY????On a note: I am from the same ethnicity. I know how each things should taste like.

Convenient delivery options, either to your home or across the street to the Harriet Brewing Tap Room. Friendly, knowledgable staff willing to explain spices and the many gluten free options.There are a few downsides, which is why I didn't \u00a0give it 5 stars. The play area is extremely dark, and sometimes my kids won't play there without an adult nearby. It is also fairly small and tucked away into the corner - sometimes, if the restaurant is crowded, we can't sit near it and can't really use it.

There is always a wide variety of vegetables-broccoli, green beans, potatoes, tons of stewed yummy veggies.The DH got masala last time. He called it the \"perfect blend of spiciness and creaminess.\" If you enjoy carbs (as you should), order the naan. All kinds are great, but we usually get the garlic. Be warned- it's GARLIC.

I've had this on my list of places to try for some time. I will definitely be back sooner than later. I'll try to add something useful to the many, many previous reviews.A friend and I started with orders of garlic and coconut Nan. Both breads were perfectly baked in the tandoor oven with excellent texture and flavor. The garlic Nan was satisfyingly savory and the coconut Nan had only a hint of sweetness which I found delicious. Previously, three sauces were brought out with complimentary Papadum (crisp, thin, cracker-like flat breads) and were all very good. While I prefer the green dipping sauce at Taste of India which has more of a fresh mint bouquet and taste while still packing a spicy punch, Gandhi Mahal's is top notch. The chutney was crisp, brightly flavored and had a nice sweet/hot balance. The tamarind sauce was very good but again, I prefer the version served at Taste of India. \u00a0For entrees, I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala. Using the green dipping sauce as a point of reference which, according to our server falls into their \"tura bahati mirchi\" or \"medium hot\" range I let myself be talked into specifying \"tura.\" Next time I'll know to insist on more heat. I may even give the Bollywood jana (extra hot) a try. In any case, my order was chock-a-block with chunks of lean, white chicken surrounded by a sauce that practically wanted to leap onto the Nan as I sopped it up. My friend ordered shrimp asking that it be prepared in the same fashion as the Sizzling Salmon, marinated in panch puran spice and garlic and cooked ala tandoor, served over grilled vegetables. I tried one and it may have been the best shrimp dish I've ever enjoyed. It was tender with a perfect sear and had a subtle smokiness that blended superbly with the spices allowing the underlying flavor of the fresh shrimp to really pop without being overwhelmed. There was a bit of a mix-up with a vegetarian dish. Mushrooms in curry sauce was ordered but what was brought to the table was Mushroom Paneer from the seasonal menu. The house was very gracious about replacing the dish. I have to say that we both tried the Mushroom Paneer and found it very tasty. We could have lived with the error. However, since the bulk of the dish was actually for my friend to bring home to his wife (or was he supposed to bring home jolly, jolly six-pence?) we asked for the correction to be made. I added a cup of Darjeeling which would be better if steeped with loose leaf tea, not bags. But that's nitpicking. This is a clean, friendly, casual place. Service was uniformly wonderful. A nice, classic touch is the delivery of a hot, moist towel with the check. You may hear live sitar music on Friday and Saturday evenings. Overall, another stellar Twin Cities outpost for Indian cuisine. BTW, the city has installed a couple dozen of the new multi-space meters offering angled parking in front. Or, you may be lucky enough to find a free spot on nearby streets."], ["Reggie F.", "I really enjoy eating at Gandhi Mahal. I recommend going during the buffet and filling up your plate with all sorts of things you might not have tried otherwise (plus a nice pile of Nan).

The second time, the food was noticably less flavorful than the first time. The third time was blander than the second. The fouth time is the reason for the one-star review: The waitress took my order... AND NEVER CAME BACK until she brought my check. Someone else brought my food, and I had to flag down other waiters if I needed anything. My watiress had the two tables on either side of me and she waited on THEM but seemed to be deliberately turning her back on me or looking over my head.

I don't expect every Indian place to have a whole lot of vegan options, but I was disappointed.2. Quick Service. This is not a good thing. It was probably five minutes between placing the order and receiving the order. Assuming the food was already made and no wonder they can't make changes to dishes. Also made sense why the food I asked to be made spicy, wasn't.3. Servers. It felt like 10 minutes into our meal that someone asked if we needed boxes. This was 7 on a Saturday and it wasn't packed, but we felt we were being rushed out of there. 3-4 more times we were asked if we wanted to box up our food while we had food on our plates. Someone eventually came buy and just placed containers on our table. The best part was that we had to ask for a bill and the server had this straight up annoyed look on his face when we asked for it.

The place is intimate, because of its size and too many tables too close to each other for obvious reasons. The appetizers (Veggie Momos) took a while to get to the table. Honestly, I was happy about it since they were freshly made. The sauce adds taste to momos and the spinach gives the flavor. All in all a good way to start dinner. I ordered the veggie combo meal, which comes with any 2 entrees. Mine were Palak Paneer and Katahar. I can vouch for the Palak Paneer as it is the best I have had in my life. Creamy, tasty and excellently done. The other curry is made with jack fruit and I guess I should have had it a little more spicier. I went with mild which is wjhat it was. May be a medium or medium+ will add great deal of taste to the already tasty curry. The combo meal comes with white rice and a dessert. The kheer could have been much better.

I had my 2 year old son with me and he was not very happy about the wait either. It was around noon on the weekend and there were only a few other tables, so why did it take so long for the food?? Another let down is the fact my dishes were dirty. I had to grab a new fork because it had some dried on food. Then after I had already been drinking my water, I realized the cup I was putting my lips on had lipstick on it that did not belong to me. *GAG*The noodles I ordered were okay. Plain, is the first word that comes to mind for me. I NEVER have to add salt to my food and I am still shocked that I had to reach for the shaker. The momos were good, but nothing special. The servers aren't much for talking, in fact I think the only thing I heard them say is \"what would you like to drink\" and \"what would you like to order.\" I don't know if I just came on an off day, but I really doubt I will go back, unless some one convinces me otherwise."], ["Patrick H.", "Basically, any place that serves goat is good in my book.I don't consider myself to be an expert in the foods of the Himalayas, but my feeling is that this place is pretty dead-on.

The momos are somewhat different than ones I've enjoyed elsewhere, but still really good, & should be considered a mandatory starter.What else should be considered mandatory? THE NAAN. Again, this is an area of world cuisine where I hesitate to make authoritative claims, but DAMN that naan is GOOD. There are several varieties, but I might suggest just sticking to the plain style. Also, be prepared to spring for a second order. Also, be prepared to get another order to go.Prices are reasonable/moderate, & service is adequate.

Good for us, though, as we had a private dining experience for a bit. All of our food came out fast and hot, and our service was fantastic.The naan, both the paneer and regular versions, were some of the best I've had. Perfectly fluffy and buttered. The paneer naan had some great spice flavors that paired wonderfully with some mint chutney. My chicken curry had great flavor but wasn't as spicy as I had hoped. I asked for a 4/5 on the hot scale and maybe got a 2.5, so ask for a level up from what you think you want. Again, great flavors, though, and the serving of the curry and the rice was bountiful. I also tried a bit of the coconut shrimp. This was spicier than my curry but was evened out nicely with the sweet coconut.Darbar was one of the better Indian food experiences I've had in town.

We ordered the lamb kebabs as an appetizer, at a spice level 3 (which was plenty spicy for us) and the entrees at a spice level 2 (perfect for a Minnesota level of \"spicy\"). To round out our meal, we ordered raita, a kind of sauce consisting of a blend of cucumber/tomato/yogurt that added a wonderful contrast to the curry and masala sauces. We had more than enough food (including our appetizer and two orders of garlic naan) but if you're only ordering entrees, three dishes split between two people is a good idea.

We had empty water glasses all around and he walked by several times WITH a water pitcher without even glancing at us. Second time, I went for lunch and ordered a chicken curry. It tasted just fine and service was mediocre, but when I got the bill, the curry was priced at more than what it should have been. I asked the server why that is so, and she said that she thought I ordered my curry from the dinner menu. The menu does have a lunch chicken curry at a lower price and a dinner menu further back with a full price chicken curry, but this was not explained to me nor was it clarified when I put in my order with her. Mind you, I was eating at noon that day and I really hate complaining at restaurants, but it really was presumptuous of her to assume that I ordered from the dinner menu when the lunch menu was placed in front of me first. I asked her if anything could be done about the bill, and she replied that management will not do anything. Yesterday, I ordered their food via restaurant connection (cheaper than Bitesquad in my area) and had it delivered to my house. Everything arrived promptly and well-packaged.

Fabulous curry sauces and the naan was pillowy soft and warm. The fried (not tempura style) cauliflower was a favorite!

That wasn't the problem.I can't verify this, of course, and it seems unthinkable, but I think the naan I was given was taken from someone else's leftovers. It wasn't even a full piece, but a few little mismatched slices. It had other food stuck to it, like not the food that I ordered. And it didn't look like it had just brushed against some other food in the kitchen, but like it had been sitting with other food. I also ordered veggie samosas. One of them was wet.

It consisted of 2 very small \"balls\" each the size of a large marble.The entrees consisted of a very small amount of protein in a very large amount of sauce and a dish of rice. Taste was okay.

We could have gone to any hole-in-the-wall curry place, but I used the Yelp app and filtered by rating. At the top of the list was Darbar, a restaurant that promises delicious Indian food with upscale decor.They got the ambiance down. The place is gorgeous and fits in well with how fancy Uptown has become. It has the feel of a lounge with a spacious dining area and cozy full bar. I noticed Mai Tais on the menu and had to go for it. It was happy hour and I love a good Mai Tai. Unfortunately, it wasn't a very good Mai Tai. I don't usually say this, but too much alcohol overpowered the drink and made it bitter. I might try a wine next time, and I was delighted to see they offer pairing suggestions on the menu.I realize there are different types of cuisine in India. Region plays a big part in the type of food you are served, so I don't expect each place to be the same. However, I have noticed many similarities on most menus. I typically order Gosht Pasanda at my favorite place in IL, so I asked the waiter which of the lamb dishes on Darbar's menu would be most similar to that. He stared at me blankly, so I asked if he knew what I was talking about and he kinda goes, \"We have this,\" and pointed to one dish. I read the description and it didn't seem right, so I tried to explain what I wanted and he seemed very confused and then pointed at two more lamb items. There are only a handful, so it seemed like he was just randomly pointing at things. Again, I understand if he had no clue what I was talking about, but I think the appropriate response would have been to say he wasn't sure or to ask another employee or manager.I ended up ordering a order of garlic naan, which was very good and the Rogan Josh. I believe Rogan Josh may be the same as Gosht Pasanda or very similar, but it wasn't nearly as good as I've had elsewhere. It had a similar, creamy yogurt sauce but lacked the flavor I was searching for. My friend ordered Chicken Vindaloo, extra spicy. She was very pleased with her meal. They gave us a single order of rice to split. We also ordered Mango Lassis which never showed up until we had to reorder them after our meal.The food was pretty good, the atmosphere is nice and the service is pleasant, albeit slow and lacking in some areas.

I ordered my dishes both medium for the level of spice (heat) but I barely considered either to be mild.

The simplest of all items on the menu is most authentic in taste as well. I won't refrain from saying that it is close to what you will get in decent dhaba in punjabGulab Jamun: Felt like freshly made. I would order again.Naan: Neither too dry nor too rubbery like most of the other restaurants \u00a0serve.They do a good job serving it warm. A small window to their kitchen towards the rear door gives you a glimpse of their tandoor and reassure that they are busy preparing naan fresh--Average:Rogan Josh, Palak Paneer, chickan tikka masala, Lassi. Malai Kofta, Tandoori chicken--Losers:Muttar Paneer: Easily worst preparation ever. Peas were still cold as if fresh out of freezer. Gave the feedback to manager in the end but he simply raised his hands and said \"can't provide the taste that you would get at home\". Now we all know that Indian resturants have one common tomato gravy which they use for variety of dishes but what others do better than this place is that they cook the items well enough that veggies do not stand out with their own raw taste in the dish.--Paneer Tikka: This is tasty but it is not paneer tikka. You are just serving lightly grilled paneer chunks on a hot plate. I I did not know anything about paneer tikka I would buy it but If I know I would just change the name of the dish. C'mon you call yourself \"Indian Grill\" you can do a better job in grilling tikkas!Another thing which I would comment is on spice level. When you tell them to make your dish very spicy they would just add more red chili powder. Its time that Darbar should train your chef to know that spicy means all the items in the base spice go up in proportion not just chilli powder. \u00a0Darbar needs to work on it if want to maintain my loyalty I have been going to this place from last two years now. Service has been on decline.I loved this place but after that mutter paneer incident I would be reluctant to go again."], ["Julie T.", "I really enjoyed Darbar India Grill. The atmosphere was very trendy and had a touch of romance in my opinion. Our group of 6 was promptly served. I had the Paneer Makhani. Delicious! I kept eating even though I was plenty full! The service was very efficient and friendly. I will definitely go again. Parking was easy to find in the area (less than a 1/2 a block away). If you are in for cocktails, it appears they had more than a full bar available for your enjoyment!"], ["Alexandra H.", "Megan W. & I probably should have checked Yelp before trying this place out, but the scent emanating from outside Darbar was too enticing to resist.Too bad the food didn't live up to our expectations. We did anything BUT order bland food--tikka masala, vegetable curry, basmati rice, garlic naan, etc.--but it all tasted surprisingly \"meh.\" I actually found myself wishing I was eating Trader Joe's garlic naan instead...With the plethora of options in Uptown, I probably won't go back for food, but the atmosphere is open and relaxing so I could definitely see myself grabbing a drink at Darbar."], ["Lauren J.", "It's 100 degrees outside and all I can think about is warm, comforting spicy vegetable Korma from DarBar.I have been dreaming of this place since I went a week ago. Like I said, the vegetable Korma is amazing. Includes every vegetable you'd want in a sauce with a complexity of spices I wouldn't dare try to recreate. It's just too bad that it is $11.95, which seems steep considering the portion side. Not to mention I also need the side of naan and yogurt dill sauce. I foresee an expensive future habit.But man, is that a good meal. I'm worried for my bank account once it gets cold as this place is only 1 block from my house."], ["Soma N.", "I love this place. It's the same owner as India Palace - my all-time favorite Indian restaurant in the Twin Cities. I've been going to India Palace in Roseville for 10 years now, since I moved up here and discovered it. Darbar is something special. The ambiance is amazing - contemporary, sleek, warm. They also make a great cocktail - definately not normal for an Indian restaurant! And of course...the food. It's essentially the same as the food at India Palace - that is to say, not Americanized Indian-ish type food. It is incredible! \u00a0We have our favorites - so we tried those. My date got the Lamb Shahi Korma and it was perfect - deliciously balanced, creamy, tender lamb....just delightful. They didn't skimp on the paneer, cashews, or raisins (which tends to be a problem for Indian places with this dish). I got the Mattar Paneer (peas and cheese) - and I tend to be picky with this dish in particular. They nailed it, of course!We also got plain naan and paneer naan (can you tell we like our cheese?) and they nailed that, too. Even though we came in late, about 30 minutes to close (we are late eaters....I just can't help that) the service was prompt and very friendly. The food was quick, fresh, and hot. I am in love! I can get a good cocktail and delicious Indian food at the same place - that is a rare combo, and I am thrilled to have found it!"], ["Madeleine H.", "This is the go-to Indian place for my husband and me...it's our favorite Indian restaurant in the Twin Cities, and we've been to a bunch. We usually get the chana saag (chickpeas with spinach...ask for it with no cream), which isn't often on the menu at other restaurants and is a nice change-up from the usual chana masala.At many places spice heat levels vary from time to time due to different cooks in the kitchen, but Darbar is one of the more consistent restaurants I've been to in terms of mild always being the same level of mild, medium being medium, etc.The restaurant is new and modern, so the ambiance is a step above many restaurants in this category. \u00a0Service can be a little shy and unpolished, but most of the servers are very pleasant.For vegetarians/vegans:Darbar has a long list of vegetarian entrees and many of them are already vegan, so just have your server point them out. You can ask for the roti without butter so it will be vegan also.One of my wishes regarding Indian restaurants in general is that they would offer coconut-based or some other type of vegan lassi. \u00a0If Darbar did, it would be 5 stars all the way!"], ["Jodi W.", "I ordered food via bite squad at 6:15 for a 7:45 delivery. I still don't have my food. If you can't manage the volume of orders, don't take them. Will never order again."], ["Rachel P.", "Great food and friendly service! I highly recommend the vegetable samosas, chicken saag, vindaloo, and any naan."], ["Annie M.", "I decided to try this place a couple weeks ago, and since then I have been going AT LEAST once a week. The food could not get any better. The Indian Cheese is amazing. I never eat vegetarian meals, but the vegetarian dishes leave me completely satisfied. The naan is fantastic as well. The staff is so kind and friendly, they remember us every time we come in and treat us like VIPs. Love love love Darbar!"], ["Maggie W.", "I am VERY picky about indian food - and this place just gets it RIGHT.Spicy enough (if you ask for it), and just delicious food all around. Don't miss their Tikka Masala sauce (with paneer or chicken) - it's a basic, but it is SO good here."], ["Ryan H.", "I wish I had more time in Minneapolis to explore their food, because almost everything that I tried was absolutely fantastic. I don't know if Darbar is the best place in the whole city, but my wife and I picked it based on reviews from Yelp and the distance from where we parked our van.I was a little turned off when I first arrived, because I tend to enjoy buffets when I go to Indian places for the first time. When we walked into the place at 12:30 on a Tuesday afternoon and found that there wasn't one other soul in the joint who was there to eat, we exchanged nervous glances. We decided to proceed anyway, because of the 50 something good reviews. We told ourselves that we were just used to places like Portland and Boulder where not many people work the whole 9-5 nonsense.For an appetizer we ordered some veggie pakoras which were some of the best either of us have ever had. Then we split a Chicken Tikka Masala and some sort of Okra dish (I don't remember what it was, as I was in the bathroom anally emptying my body of the spicy Thai food of the previous evening). Both blew our minds and made our bellies sing with joy.The server was extremely polite, even if he wasn't' the most friendly dude in the world, and seemed to know exactly when to approach us. The appetizer came out with enough time for us to enjoy it and have a few minutes of digestion before the main courses. Also, he seemed genuinely pleased when we told me how much we enjoyed the food. As a plus, when I came back from my second journey to the bathrooms, there were a few other tables with people- maybe Minneapolis just prefers a late lunch.Here are the only two things that I didn't like- 1. the lunch portions were small, but still as expensive as if we were getting dinner size plates and 2. both bathrooms had water all over the floor, causing me to have to squat on the seats (which I sometimes prefer anyway, as it's soooo much smoother).I'd like to try out more Indian places in the Mini-apple, because if this place isn't the best then holy hot damn!"], ["Joshua W.", "Delicious food, amazing plating, I so wanted to love this place, but the service was less than par. Drinks were surprisingly good for a \"first time\" attempt at a Soco Sour... which I had to explain that Soco was short for Southern Comfort and how to make it.The decor is nice, it feels like this place should be packed 24/7, but I think the vast majority have taken the hint that the service sucks.Food was amazing. The best tasting Indian food I have yet to have. The Lamb Vindaloo was awesome. We also got appetizers Lamb Samosas and Tandoori Scallops which were great.This was basically the best Indian food I've ever had. I would give this place 5 stars on food.But I have to remove 2 stars because the waitress was ditzy, the manager came over to see if everything was ok but was super awkward."], ["Troy M.", "Have ordered numerous times via Bitesquad. Never actually been to the place. The food has been great every time. \u00a0I have ordered many different items and they all have been awesome. My only criticism is that the portions you receive for takeout are smallish for the price. \u00a0One entree comes in a container that is basically the size used for a cup of soup. \u00a0Two of us usually order two entrees, naan (which is killer) and an appetizer. \u00a0If you just order one entree, you'll be left hungry."], ["S H.", "Food was decent, but ordered food to go, and got home to find that the extra order of naan that was paid for was not included in the bag, which was most of the reason for ordering Indian food that night. Pregnancy craving aggravated more than satisfied. Disappointing."], ["Sidharth S.", "Was not expecting much but... really good 1. great food - got the chicken tikka ( not masala), chana masala and chicken makhani with the bread basket and mixed appetizers for 6 people..Everyone LOVED it!2. good service.. also got a bottle of red wine the servers were prompt and very attentive even at peak hour3. Not expensive - the ambience and locations were fantastic and even then it was not more than 20$ a person including wine..Overall fantastic experience for me and my american / russian friends!! will go again!"], ["George Z.", "First of all, this Indian restaurant has the best ambiance of any Indian restaurant here in the Twin Cities. \u00a0Nice sleek white booths, lots of glass and natural light, and trendy decor. \u00a0Job well done with the atmosphere!Food, however, falls short when stacked against the competition. \u00a0I judge a Indian restaurant by their standard curry, and Darbar's product was only so so. \u00a0\"Watered-down\" is how I would perfectly drescribe it. \u00a0A good curry, in my mind, should be nice and thick and packed full of spices. \u00a0Here it was too \"runny\" and I couldn't taste the numerous spices that makes me crave Indian food so much. \u00a0Also, the naan bread isn't as fluffy and chewy like some other Indian restaurant that I frequent. \u00a0Furthermore, their tamarind sauce has this weird red color. \u00a0The tamarind tasted weak, and I've never seen it with this tomato-ish color. \u00a0To end with a positive note, their mango lassi is tasty.Service could definitely be improved. \u00a0Server never stopped by ONCE during my meal to ask if everything tasted okay. \u00a0And in general, she came across as someone that really didn't want to be working that particular day. \u00a0She wasn't mean or unfriendly, but at the same time there was no enthusiasm or cheerfulness.Uptown has a lack of Indian restaurants, and I would recommend Darbar over the Indian restaurant down the block. \u00a0Darbar's ambiance is worlds apart better, and it also has better prices, and more importantly, better food (i.e. doesn't taste \"old\" and \"reheated\"). \u00a0However, every time that I've been here it's never been more than half full and often times I find myself in a empty restaurant during non-peak hours."], ["Joelle P.", "I've been to Darbar a few times now, and all times would receive the same \"good\" rating food-wise, hence why I've gone back. However, the service is just not up to par here, and that takes a way from the eating experience A LOT.First off, I love the atmosphere. It's very nice, kind of upscale, and doesn't have the smell of curry lingering in the air: big plus. The food is decent Indian fare, nothing special, nothing that will blow your mind. The naan is alright as well, although I've had way, way better. I would also say the curry needs a little more spice/flavor. I ordered mine \"very spicy\" and felt it was hardly spicy at all and lacked a little of the rich, full, taste of curry. Now, on to the bad part: the service. At a place set up like this, you would expect a good wait-staff. The server we had this past time was very impatient, rushed, and just not very nice. She didn't smile or greet us, she just asked us what we want to drink and then came back and asked if we were ready to order yet. Eh, I guess I can deal with this, not the end of the world. But wait, it gets worse. Our curry and rice was brought out before our naan basket (weird) by a different person who clearly did not know what was going on. We asked him about our naan and he seemed confused and had to go check. Then, after our naan was brought out by yet another person, we were not checked on again. No one stopped by to see how our food was, no one stopped to fill our water glasses or ask us if we would like to order another drink. We had to flag someone down to order more rice and get more water, and even that took some time. From what we overheard people talking about, they were apparently having some sort of party after they closed, and were all rushed to get everything ready for that. That is really not an excuse to me as the point of a restaurant is to serve its customers during its business hours. I'm not sure if I will be back because of this. It's too bad because it is very close to me and has a nice atmosphere for dinner. We'll have to see, maybe they can redeem themselves yet!"]], "Tandoor Restaurant": [["Lakshay C.", "Great food and great service...buffet is delicious with a lot of choices...if you go for dinner then you must try chicken makhani and chicken tikka masala with garlic naan..."], ["M K.", "Food options are limited but good.

We eat vegetarian when we are there because it is so good and everything is a hit. We've not had a bad dish there.

A good INDIAN buffet at that? I know, I know, but let your apprehensions fall to the wayside, folks, because this is a buffet that will blow your mind. I cannot recount all the delicious dishes that I gouged myself on, but each and every single thing I put in my mouth was phenomenal. The buffet is very well maintained, staff are constantly stirring the food and checking to see if it is still fresh and replacing anything that seems sub par. The atmosphere of the restaurant is great! Beautiful artwork that was painted by the owner's wife line the walls. There is a gorgeous shrine near the entry way that is worth stopping and appreciating. There are tapestries and statues and many other neat things that make up a feeling that seems to authenticate the restaurant. For some ambiance, the restaurant had some Indian music playing. When asked, the manager told us that it was the 'Slumdog Millionaire' soundtrack. My friend that I was dining with was actually offered the burnt copy of the CD that was playing, simply because he said that he liked it and wanted to go out and buy it later. How nice is that?? \"Hey, I like this CD!\" says friend \"Here you go sir, you may have it.\" the manager. WTF??? Awesome!! The staff is very kind and attentive. They were very quick to refill my beverage each time it got low. I don't know if this is a common thing, but while I was there, the manager of the restaurant visited each table to ensure that the diners were enjoying their meal, which is something that I appreciated. At the doorway you can find a large dish filled with baked coconut and fennel seed which is supposed to help the body digest the food that was just consumed. It looks kind of like bird seed. I took a handful and chewed it up, and with some difficulty, swallowed it. It definitely wasn't that good to eat, wasn't terrible either, but it DID help me digest my food. I thought that was kind of cool because not only do they care about the quality of the food they serve, the atmosphere and decor of their restaurant while you eat, but they also care about how the food gets digested in your belly :) This is a must-try restaurant for any fan of Indian food.
