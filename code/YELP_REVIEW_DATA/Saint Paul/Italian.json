{"Luci Ancora": [["Rebekah K.", "Lovely little spot with attentive servers and craveable food. Went for their Thursday four-course tasters special and was not disappointed. My favorite was the pasta. Perfectly cooked spaghetti (cannot be overrated, IMO), with a smokey spicy tomato sauce. After about two bites I decided I wanted to come back and order a big bowl of that pasta next time! I just couldn't get enough. Another surprise was the Mixed Salad that was served with a very tangy Dijon vinaigrette. It was a punch of flavor from the first bite. My dinner partner and I each actually made an exclamation upon tasting it. Also had the tiniest little tomatoes. Our water was constantly refilled and server was always swinging by to clear plates and make sure we were set. My only real complaint is that both the steak and salmon were slightly overcooked and dry. Not unpalatable, but an aberration to an otherwise nice meal. I hope to return for that big bowl of pasta!"], ["Gina D.", "We have never had a bad meal here, Tuesdays and Thursdays they have a special on their Prezzo Fisso menu. If you do not eat seafood they will substitute their American Kobe Style beef for the seafood dish on this menu, and the beef is so tender you could cut it with a butter knife.

From the moment I walk in the door to the moment I leave, the service is excellent and professional. Tonight, I had dinner with two associates from out of town. In all, we were there for two hours and not once did we feel rushed by our server. She was attentive, but not over bearing. She was knowledgeable about the menu and the wine list. We all had the four course tasting menu which consists of smaller portions of the night's specials. The antipasti course was a piece of shaved pork with some onions and radicchio. One of my companions was not a fan of the dish, but I think it was the radicchio. Personally, I love radicchio so was very happy. The Zuppa course was a generous bowl of a lovely tomato soup in a chicken stock base. It was warming and comforting on this snowy winter night. I would go back just for another bowl of this soup.The Primi Piatti was a pasta with walnuts and dried apricots. It was the perfect combination of spicy and sweet. I think the smaller portion for the tasting menu was the perfect size. It was interesting, but I wouldn't want a larger portion. For the Secondi Piatti I chose the \u00a0Kobe beef with risotto and truffle oil. The risotto was perfectly cooked as was the beef. Of the four courses, this was the least interesting. Still, it was very good.All for $33. \u00a0A reasonable price for a lovely meal.We each had a dessert to complete the meal. My companions had the carrot cake with the salted caramel. They raved. I had the flour-less chocolate cake. Excellent."], ["Emily G.", "For me, Luci Ancora is decent, but not exciting. This is the kind of place you go when your great-aunt or grandma or people from out of town want to take you out to dinner. Everyone will find something on the menu they like. Solid food, but not surprising or remarkable in any way. They do use really good ingredients, which helps. It would be a good place to go with people who are used to Olive Garden-type restaurants and you want to nudge them into something a bit better. They do have some specials that are a really good value: Currently, on Tuesdays and Thursdays you can get a four-course tasting menu of the day's specials for $20 per person, if two people order it."], ["Sen H.", "Atmosphere: 4.5What one generally thinks of as a slightly higher end, classic Italian restaurant.

Unless you enjoy being elbow-to-elbow, I'd recommend showing up early or making sure there aren't events going on at the Xcel or Ordway. Or, just make sure you're there before the events conclude.

It was quite salty, and the brussels sprouts were undercooked.

These two desserts were rich and sweet. It's probably best to just get one because of how rich it is and save the one for later. Would I come back here again for dessert?

We had never heard of Scusi and were pleasantly surprised by the experience. No wonder, \u00a0then, that my wife suggested \u00a0we try it again last week when we were out running a few weeknight errands.When we arrived we thought about grabbing a table in the dinning room, but you know we love to sit at the bar so we opted for that instead.Correction: I love to sit at the bar, and Sara lets me have my way. Usually.As we saddled up to the bar we were greeted by a couple of waters and a very nice bartender. The two times we have been to Scusi, I have been very impressed by the service. Friendly, fast, and knowledgeable. What more could you want?During Happy Hour, Scusi offers all their pizzas at half price and has specials on some red and white wines. Having a pizza was definitely going to happen, but we needed to pick some wine first. All wines at Scusi are served a little differently than I'm used to.Rather than having the choice of a bottle or a glass, they have three different size carafes: Quartino, Mezzo, and Bottiglia. A quartino is about 8 ounces-so about a glass and a half. A mezzo seemed to be about twice that size, and the bottiglia was a little bigger than a bottle (if you didn't figure that out by the name).Sara chose \u00a0a quartino of Chianti, and I went with Pinot Nior. Then it was time to make some decisions on food. While we perused the menu, our bartender brought out some rosemary crackers and a delicious white bean spread. Just the thing to rouse a diner's appetite.Per usual, my lady decided on the Sausage pizza (fennel sausage, San Marzano sauce, provolone, mozzarella). I really wanted the Duck pizza (duck, apple, Gorgonzola, rosemary, honey, Alfredo) but decided to go with something a little different and ordered the Salumeria assortment of three.Salumeria is a fancy word for salami shop. Traditionally, Salumeria just sold cured meats, but recently have been know to sell cheese and other types of antipasti as well. You know I love antipasti, and with the assortment I got to pick one salami, one cheese, and one type of olive. Three of my favorite things on one plate! I went with the Sopressata, the Fontina, and Mediteranian Mix of olives.The pizza was terrific. High quality cheese, light crisp crust, and tasty sausage. My plate was really good too, and I was especially impressed with the size of the portions. I'm often leery of ordering cheese or antipasti at restaurants because you never know how much you're going to get. I got 8 nice slices of meat, two huge hunks of cheese, at least a cup of olives, compote, and warm bread. Pretty good deal for $14!One of these days, Sara and I will have to try a full- on dinner at Scusi. The great experiences we've had at Happy Hour justify that.

The wine selection is good, so it's a cool place to kick back with friends or to have a nice date. I was last at Scusi in May, celebrating a huuuge milestone.

For $14.00, the portion was small and the garlic was over powering (this is coming from someone that loves garlic). There were not many clams in the dish, let alone some of the clams didn't even open up. When I pointed this out to the waitress she said \"oh that happens sometimes\". If you aren't going to give me many clams - in my clam linguini, at least give me a few extra clams that are edible!!!"], ["Elizabeth H.", "Have eaten here a couple of times now and am the biggest fan of eating in the bar, mostly because of the ambiance. \u00a0The tables are smaller and it is quieter. \u00a0It reminds me of its own little bistro, off the bigger, busier and less interesting dining room. \u00a0Had a fun time chatting up the bartenders, who made some special recommendations of the extensive, approachable wine list. \u00a0In the bar area, you'll have fun staring up at the almost-lifesize poster of Italy.

It was the end of Cheesefare week, and it's a good time to combine cheese and seafood. So that means Italian or Mexican. So glad I thought of this, and it turns out I'm going to be thinking of it a lot more. Basil wanted soup, I ended up eating half. It was a tomato soup with mushrooms, so simple it was laughable. The first OMG moment. The second was the most delicious Italian bread I've ever had. Huge, generous slices take 1 pat of butter. Soup and bread could be all you need. Our cheesy seafood choice of seafood cannelloni stared us right in the face. It was a surprise, because when it reads a mixture of crab, scallops, shrimp, etc. It is a literal mixture not just a blend of pieces. I could only eat one of the two and was stuffed. It includes a nice house salad with a great creamy peppercorn dressing, get extra. We finished up splitting a tiramisu. Creamy and yummy, but my favorite is still Russian style at Moscow on the Hill.The service was good, but we especially took notice of Logan, a young wait assist/ runner. She does everything with a smile, clears plates, fills water, you name it. She also recognized us because she is good friends with our sons, which made it a very nice touch.

Let's see; my visits here were for date nights and my dad's birthday, (where I inherited my preferences for neighborhoody italian joints). I ordered the signature lemon chicken entree, which delicious other than being heavy on the lemon, and the pasta was a bit too oily. My BF ordered seafood cannelloni, which he raved about for days... months!So the food was great, but service was casual, in some cases, lacking. It's clearly a family-owned place; the owner's kid was working the restaurant floor, and would lift the glass by the rim - right where you put your lips - when refilling water. But it's evident that the owners/managers have a good relationship with their staff. Every visit in has had friendly but not obnoxious demeanor. They like working there. Lastly, the ambiance. From the street, it's nondescript. The space is tight, decor seems to be an afterthought, and the crowd is the frumpies you'd expect from the St Kate's area. My BF was going to wear dress slacks and a button down. I convinced him to change to jeans but he definitely was one of the more dressed up in his button down.

There restaurant looked very clean and may have just been repainted. There was no art on the walls although the walls wer painted a dark color making it seem very warm and inviting. The garlic smells greeted you as soon as the door opened. There was a waitress wanted sign in the window and only one waitress on staff. My first thought was that we were in for a long wait, howerver she had 2 helpers and they made it a smooth experience. We startd off with a glass of red then got down to eating the bread and salad. Both were understated and very good. They didn't drown the salad in dressing which was a plus.

But that being said, it's good food and I've been coming here a couple times a year since I've been 20. If you go to one of the nearby ACTC colleges, it is probably your best bet for a nice romantic dinner that wont break the bank. The entrees range from $13-$19 and there are a couple of wines under $30 a bottle. I like Carmelos because it is tiny family owned restaurant where they really care about your dining experience. There are less than a dozen tables in the main dining room and about the same downstairs. I think it's a good place for a special occasion. I also like taking people here for the first time because it's not a well known restaurant. Everyone that I've taken here has liked the place and wonders why they have never heard about it, particularly people who live in Minneapolis. I would recommend getting a reservation because the place is usually full. I would also ask for a table in the main dining room, because I don't like the feeling of eating in a windowless basement.

The inside is very quaint, and you can tell this place has been around for awhile.We started our meal with an appetizer of the artichoke dip. The dip comes with crusty crostini and is very creamy. I liked the addition of the red pepper, but could have done with a little less onion in the dip.For my entree, I ordered the spinach and cheese ravioli with marinara. The ravioli are homemade, and were pretty tasty, but there was an odd flavor that I couldn't quite place. I think it might have been from the spinach. The marinara is your typical, American-style red sauce. What I liked best about this entree is you could tell everything was homemade. The portions are big so come hungry.My husband ordered the bolognese and wasn't too impressed. He thought the sauce didn't have enough meat, and the meat that was in there was too crumbled.Dessert selection is minimal. The have tiramisu, a cheesecake and a chocolate espresso cake.This is a nice place to come with a few friends to relax and enjoy a nice dinner.

I ordered my meat medium rare and this was done perfect to my liking. It is more of a hunk of meat. Dry rub wasn't overly flavorful, but it was still good.They have hand cut fries which was a plus. I prefer these over the sysco system fries.The caesar salad was one of the best I've had in awhile. Nice size salad that came with my meal. It had black olives, marinated red onion, parmesan and a really good caesar dressing.Seems like a great family run neighborhood place with a bar, nice dining area, good service and great food!"], ["Natalie S.", "My husband and I loved Degidios, the food is always great.

The hot, fresh bread on the table kicked off an amazing meal. We tried the daily antipasto (a tomato and beef bruschetta), the spaghetti carbonara and the spaghetti with clams and peppers. It was all super wonderful.I'm reserving a couple of stars for the same reason I reserved them on my review of Luci Ancora (the sister restaurant catty corner from Ristorante Luci). The environment is so bland! The blinds are pulled so you can't see outside, the lights are too bright and very stark, no music was playing so we could hear the hushed conversations of our neighbors word-for-word, and there is absolutely no decor in the place. Brightly lit, bare walls. I find this to be so weird for a place that has put so much thought into their wonderful food and their great staff.

Where's the ambiance?I would so happily make Luci my neighborhood staple, but I think take-out in my own home would be a better dining experience."], ["Scott E.", "We love this place. Over the years this has been the best Italian restaurant in the area. Do make it a point to dine at the original location (small and intimate) for the best experience. The new larger building is not my preference. The bread is made daily for the number of reservations and so yummy. The place is small and intimate but the spacing is enough to allow conversations to remain private. The wait staff is the best. Always friendly, professional and smiling. The chef has been at this location for a long time and our favorite meals remain consistent over the years. The prices today are not much higher than 15 plus years ago. From special family moments to marriage proposals to fun nights out, Ristorante Luci has always delivered a great dining experience.

This is not (in my opinion) a flashy place to get all dressed up and have a 'fine dining' experience-- I mean, they have a Pabst Blue Ribbon sign, for heaven's sake!! \u00a0With that said, it is VERY impressive that they always seem to have some prime beef on the menu. (sidenote: it's unbelievable to me that so many of the top Twin Cities \"steak places\" don't offer prime beef). And the wine selection is good without being outrageously expensive. The wines by the glass were nice though you do need to talk to the servers to pinpoint which ones are likely to suit your tastes (dry or sweet, tannic, etc). For me, this is one of my favorite places to have a comfortable, delicious meal with friendly, responsive service. I'm a huge fan of Broders Pasta Bar but find it frustrating to have to wait for a table there, every time. Every pasta dish I've had at Luci was just as good at Broder's, but it helps if you asks the Luci servers which dishes are made from housemade pasta-- those are better. I've dined across the street at Ancora, which is much fancier but I prefer the cozy space and feel in Luci. \u00a0Ancora is a bit more of a place to get dressed up for- both have delicious food that matches what I found in Italy."], ["Roxanne E.", "I had a lovely dinner at Restorante Luci with two business associates. \u00a0This is a small restaurant with \u00a0maybe 12 tables.

When I spend $140 on a dinner for two, I don't expect the atmosphere of a Chaamps."], ["Alex C.", "I had heard a lot about this place so I was pretty excited to get a Crowd Cut here. \u00a0Their market is huge. \u00a0It's like a fancy version of the old Cossetta's market. \u00a0Their restaurant is beautiful. \u00a0I was the only person in a tie the night I was there but I definitely got a country club vibe from the place. \u00a0It is really nice looking inside and I thought the people were all great but my wife echoed what others have said about a pretentious feel.That being said, the food was fantastic and very well priced for a fancy restaurant. \u00a0I started with the lamb crudo and the portion was big (of course not too big...I can never have enough raw meat) and incredibly tasty. \u00a0Sometimes stuff like this leaves an oily or fatty film in my mouth but not here. \u00a0My wife started with a beet salad that she really enjoyed. \u00a0Everything appeared to be in perfect sized bites. \u00a0For dinner I had the hanger steak which tasted and looked like a large tenderloin. \u00a0The sauce was mushroom and cooked cherry; a strange but amazing combination. \u00a0The cherry added just the perfect amount of sweet to the meal. \u00a0This \u00a0was one of the best cooked steaks I've ever had. \u00a0My wife had the lobster mac & cheese for under $20. \u00a0There was an awful lot of lobster for a dish under $20. \u00a0She greatly enjoyed it too.For dessert, we finished with the figgy toffee pudding. \u00a0This was the best fig newton tasting dish ever created! \u00a0I like fig newtons, my wife didn't like it as much so that meant more for me. \u00a0It doesn't look like a fig newton but it tastes like a newton with cream and a little salt to help maximize the flavor. \u00a0That toffee is just awesome!It's a great special event space. \u00a0Entrees were between 20 to 30 (my steak was 27 and a ribeye was 32), the noodle dishes are all under 20 with half sizes available. \u00a0If you're hungry, you're crazy not to do the tasting menu at $39 which gives you a smaller noodle, entree and salad/appetizer."], ["Ken S.", "In my humble opinion this is by far the best Italian restaurant in the Twin Cities area. Been a regular since opening and the high standards has not changed at all. The service staff is top notch, many of them veterans from opening day. Try the three course tasting menu along with \u00a0wine pairings and let them help you make your choices. During nice weather the patio is a must. Buon appetito!!!"], ["Kelly J.", "I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary dinner. This place is hidden and I hope it stays that way! The food was amazingly delicious, the wine pairings were superb and I can only mention a certain dish that will change your life: Figgy Toffee Pudding. Seriously - you must get it. Dessert will never be the same again.We had the tasting menu which is more than enough food, and quite a good deal for the price. You start with an appetizer, then have a pasta dish and after the pasta you still get a main course! The sausage rigatoni is simple but pristine, and I cannot say enough about the halibut I had - to die for. They have a seasonal menu so the dishes available when you go may be very different, but I can be quite sure that the food will be consistently delicious no matter what time of year it is."], ["aaron a.", "I previously rated I Nonni at 4 stars. \u00a0Little did I realize how wrong I was. \u00a0This is a five star Italian restaurant all the way through.The service is exceptional. \u00a0The wine list is amazing. \u00a0And the service is outstanding. \u00a0The food outshines all of that.The last nightly special I had yesterday knocked me back a few paces. \u00a0It was among the best seafood dishes I've ever had. \u00a0Zuppa de Pesce taken to a new level, loaded with clams, lobster, shrimp, tuna...wonderful and delicious...sea beans? \u00a0Who would have thought. \u00a0Saffron, lovely. \u00a0This was the highlight of this month for me. \u00a0It was terrific!We come here often for happy hour to eat at the bar. \u00a0This place has the best pizza in the city. \u00a0We always get the margarita and add anchovies Napolitana style. \u00a0Amazing thin crust, just like we ate many times in italy. \u00a0The sauce perfect, the ingredients top shelf. \u00a0And at 1/2 price between 4-6 for a measly $6, I can't think of a better deal on a pizza anywhere especially at this quality.Every dinner I've had here in the last 9 months has been exceptional and we eat here up to 2 times a week. \u00a0It's so consistently amazing that I have a hard time going anywhere else for Italian food in MN. \u00a0No, actually, I probably won't bother going anywhere else for Italian in MN. \u00a0I found the best around."], ["Jim R.", "We have visited this out of the way Italian restaurant on 4 different occasions. Each time the food and wine has been excellent. Our most recent visit in August didn't live up to the other 3 and it underscores what a difference the waiter can play in your overall dining experience. Our first visit (yea Groupon), we had Jay - and his descriptions of the food, helpful tips about portions and wine recommendations really put the icing on the cake for my wife and I. We've eaten at hundreds of restaurants and I'd have to put Jay up there in my top 5 waiters ever! So on our subsequent visits we asked to be seated in his section and had 2 more 5 start experiences. One time we even let him just bring food and wine based on what he thought was good. Probably our best dining experience since our trip to Italy last year. This most recent visit we couldn't get in Jay's section (he was working the great patio and it looked like rain so we opted to eat indoors). The food was just as good but our efficient and impersonal server left us wishing for Jay. Food recommendations: Peekytoe crab salad (yum!), fried zucchini blossoms, Oso Buco, Blood Orange Sorbet (love it!) \u00a0and whatever wine Jay recommends to go with your food."], ["Rob G.", "I just had dinner at Osteria I Nonni for the third time, and I couldn't live with myself if I didn't take a few minutes to give them a glowing review.I Nonni is probably the best Italian restaurant in the Twin Cities. \u00a0Why do I say that? It's because they win first prize in all categories.The food is absolutely spectacular. This evening I tried the veal sweet bread as an appetizer and it was delightful. \u00a0Next, the sausage gnocchi blew my mind as they somehow managed to evenly balance the ingredients to simultaneously enhance the high grade of the pasta while complementing the spices in the meat. \u00a0My main entree was the halibut which was perfectly cooked and topped with fresh spinach leaves, served with a split pea mash that was phenomenal. The service is always terrific. \u00a0You'll never be left alone for too long although a standard dinner will last about two to three hours, depending on your pace. It leaves a lot of time for conversation which makes this place a top-notch dating venue, assuming that you're willing to pay more for good food and that you're not an introvert.The dining room is dimly lit and the tables are set with quality dinnerware and are well spaced to allow for some privacy. If you're with someone, I'd suggest a booth but they'll get you to the right table when you check in without having to explain what you need. \u00a0They've got an eye for that sort of thing, I suppose.I am really looking forward to my next visit and can't say enough to recommend I Nonni to anyone who is looking for an A+ dinner experience."], ["Andy O.", "This is five star all the way. \u00a0This is probably the best Italian restaurant around. \u00a0I've been here twice, both for special occasions and it did not disappoint. \u00a0The prices are a little high, but you are getting really amazing food in a beautiful restaurant. \u00a0Definitely give yourself some time to eat and enjoy, this is not a place to rush through dinner. \u00a0Dinner for two here works just as well as a group setting. \u00a0The menu is always changing so don't be afraid to try something new."], ["Anne W.", "Consistely good qaulity, intersting without being wacky, and excellent service. I'd go 4.5 stars if I could. \u00a0I Nonni has a number of exceptional dishes (which may or may not be on teh menu at any given time) including the lamb, sweetbreads, carbonara, asparagus w/ egg, pheasant ravioli, and the orange polenta cake for dessert. \u00a0I find a few dishes (the mussels and some seafood pastas) too spiced for the delicacy of the seafood, and some of the desserts are a little wacky without that wackiness necessarily adding to the flavor.The wine list is excallent, and Jay is great with getting to know our wine tastes and helping to select a diffent lovely botle to try each time we go there. \u00a0The service in general has always been excellent; the servers are experienced, professional, and just plain nice people. Overall, one of my favorite places in the St. Paul area."]], "Buon Giorno": []}
