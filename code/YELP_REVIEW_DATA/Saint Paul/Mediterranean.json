{"Trieste Caf\u00e9": [], "Kafe 421": [["Matt M.", "I'm a senior graduating this semester and am starting to get angry with myself that I have only been to Kafe 421 twice during my time here... especially since my house is a block away.Dinkytown's food obviously caters to the drunk crowd (I love myself a good slice of Mesa after 2:00 AM or Qdoba nachos... McDonald's if I'm THAT drunk) but it's hard to find a nice place to meet up with a friend for a good meal. This is the place. Personally, I've never been a big fan of Loring Pasta Bar's food (though I did hear they changed up the menu recently, so I may have to check it out soon. Their brunch is also supposed to be superb... just sayin'). Both times I have been here, as well as every time I've had it catered at events, everything has been wonderful! Today I had a chicken wild rice burrito that was a huge portion for $10, especially with their almost-too-delicious-to-be tomato soup, and something totally different. I've also had the Pavo sandwich, which is basically a cool twist on a turkey club- think crispy fried onion strings and a sweet honey mustard sauce in pita bread. The Greek/Mediterranean influence is definitely there, but not overbearing- kind of a mix of American and Greek comfort foods. Make sure you try the mango salsa dip, as well. The one reason that I gave Kafe 421 four stars is that their service is sometimes lacking. I understand that I'm a college student, but that doesn't mean I should be treated any differently than the professors, colleagues, and older clientele of the restaurant. As a server in a restaurant, I almost always tip above 20 percent, and I hate being signaled out as unimportant due to my age. Both times our service has been just adequate, often to the point of feeling ignored."], ["Tiffany H.", "Pork tenderloin special was juicy and flavorful with home style mashed potatoes and brussell sprouts. \u00a0Yum!"], ["Sandy S.", "Really happy with the food. Went Saturday for lunch. Met up with our son who is attending the U. We were all anxious to try this restaurant after reading the great reviews. Highly recommend the feta cheese and artichoke dip appetizer. This is $10 but its a lot of food! Wow. DH had the fish tacos and carrot/parsnip soup. He thought the tacos were OK. Liked the soup. I had the Gyros with Caesar Salad. Salad comes on the plate with the sandwich. Son had Pavo turkey club. He was happy with it and would recommend it to others.Service was good. Food arrived fast but the restaurant was pretty empty."], ["Sophie C.", "The dining environment and atmosphere is comfortable with decorative candles and flowers. I noticed most of customers were elders. The service were somewhat slow but friendly. My friends and I ordered the Appetizer Platter Special, Shrimp Santorini , and moules frites (mussels). The mussels tasted a little undercooked, and there were some shells that are still tightly closed. Also, the mussels were very small in size, and the sauce was mediocre. It came with french fries and three pieces of toasted bread, which tasted okay.The Shrimp Santorini my friend ordered was too bland for us; the portion size was decent, and we thought we can cook it at home ourselves.The Appetizer Platter Special consisted of two chicken satay, a crab cake, two meatballs, hummus, bread, and fried eggplant of some sort. We cannot seem to taste the crab in the crab cake, and it was too overloaded with blue cheese, which we got tired of after eating a substantial amount of it. Other things were okay.Overall, it was a disappointing experience as I read a number of good reviews on Yelp."], ["Luci L.", "Wonderful calamari, yummy lamb burgers, delicious fries and hearty salads!!!

Yeah I was disappointed and when I saw the prices on the dinner menu at Kafe 21, I was even more disappointed because it was more than what I wanted to spend. But once I started eating all the disappointment was gone!! I was in food heaven!! The food was DELICIOUS!!We started with the mango salsa and pita chips for appetizer and it was great. The mango salsa was pretty good with the perfect combination of sweet and spicy. The pita chips were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It was great. But if I knew they served bread before the meal I would not have ordered an appetizer. The bread they served was good but after the bread and my appetizer I was already full...For my main dish I ordered the Gyro platter. Yes I know it sounds huge and it was huge but I was ok with having some left overs. It came with meat, pita bread, salad, fries, and tzatziki Sauce. The meat was very soft and perfectly cooked. And the salad and the fries were good too.My friend ordered the lamb burger and trust me if you are looks for a sandwich/burger then definitely go for the lamb burger. It was delicious.The ambiance was prefect for a date night with dim lighting and soft music. They even had all wine bottles for half price. If you just want to walk in in your sweat pants, be loud in a big group, and eat a lot for cheap then this might not be the place. But for a quiet dinner with your special one, this is good!!"], ["Jacky W.", "The scene was set with laughter and conversation bubbling from every corner, low-lighting, appetizing smells and wine flowing...I mean guzzling. Wine guzzling. By me. Keepin' it classy.We started with the pita with Tapenade and Tzatziki - both were pretty good. Tapenade always tastes the same to me and this was no different and no less delicious than expected. \u00a0We also had the Calamari (delicious) and Spanakopita (fair).I got the Vegetarian Moussaka and it was DELICIOUS. I want to learn how to make it because the flavors were incredible and the Parmesan provided a nice crunch.

Always ready to take an order and fill water.We ended up splitting a lamb burger and chicken panini. They were both well cooked and flavored well. Great sauce on the lamb burger. The flavors went so well together. The pesto and basil on the chicken was a great combo. Got the carrot ginger soup with the sandwiches and it hit the spot on a nice Minnesota winter night.We also split a bottle of wine because Wednesday is half price bottles which is a win in my book.Everything went great from the food and drinks to the service and setting. highly recommend for dinner and a bonus if you are there for one of their specials or happy hours."], ["Ka Ying V.", "My favorite place to go in dinkytown. \u00a0I wish my husband could like it as much, but the serving sizes are too small for his giant stomach. \u00a0Elegant, intimate, charming, and the food is always fairly good."], ["Leilani K.", "The food was fantastic!

Since it was Restaurant Week I ordered from that menu; a beet salad with arugula. The salad was good, I really liked the arugula but it's not fair to call it a beet salad. There were two beet slices on it with two orange slices. You could have called it an orange salad by those standards. Either way the salad was good. The orange was a good mix with the arugula. I ordered the halibut with asparagus and celery root puree. If you would have asked me what celery root puree was I could not have told you. Come to think of it, I still could not tell you. But it was very good. It was mixed with some cream and brown butter. I did not know what to expect, but I was surprised by how good it was. The halibut was also great. Very nice piece of fish, moist and flaky with good seasoning. The asparagus was pretty good too, not over done and not too firm. It did make my pee stink later. We ordered a couple desserts too. They were good, but I am not a dessert person so I won't elaborate. Server was good even though it was busy.

To top things off $3.00 house wine that satisfies the pallet, yes please! I had the mixed greens salad with house Balsamic Vinaigrette - home made and yummy - followed by the Penne with Grilled Flank Steak and Red Peppers. Not only was the pasta perfectly al dente, the Green Onions, Thyme and Balsamic Sauce paired well with fresh garlic. I'm a big Flank Steak admirer-er but this melted in your mouth. Kafe 421 is a storefront cafe that you get more than meets the eye! The decor is romantic with intimate touches throughout. Although every table was seated during our meal, Kafe 421 still offered an personal setting that didn't make you feel distracted or lost in the crowd. Huge plus: the noise level never became loud! For a small restaurant to be full, you would have expected noisy and annoying. \u00a0Kafe 421 must have magic walls because it was very comfortable all night.

Our server appeared to be handling five or six tables but she was never flustered or rushed. And she didn't bat an eye at our myraid requests for to-go boxes. The Mediterranean-style menu is more expansive than I had guessed, and they had a list of specials to boot. We tried the artichoke and feta dip with warm pita wedges for an appetizer. Delicious. It will ruin bar-quality spinach dip for you forever. I had the grilled Atlantic salmon in a soy glaze with mash and spinach. Salmon was cooked perfectly with a bit of cripsiness at the edges. It was also topped with tomatoes and artichoke bits, which turned out to be a great combo. BF got the eggplant milanese sandwich with a greek salad. Amazing.

I guess U2 fans love rice!Wifey had the vegetarian combo and I had the lamb with hummus (supposed to be rice).

Crunchy on the outside and soft and pillowy on the inside. Yum. They started frying it the moment I ordered it. Boyfriend had the chicken shawarma plate, which apparently is the house special. Takes 12 hours to prepare. Boyfriend also did not share with me, so I assume it was good? The plates come with delicious hummus, a couple pickled veggies, and generic crinkle cut fries. Don't forget the tea, it's enough for two people and soo good. They put a lot of fresh mint in it. Please add sugar, you're supposed to.

I'm still shocked that you can find food this good, for prices that low, in this day and age.I first had a falafel sandwich ($2.99) which was superb: lightly toasted pita, fresh tahini, cucumbers and tomatoes, along with wonderfully seasoned falafel pieces. It was a substantial, delicious meal at the lowest price I've ever seen for a falafel sandwich in the US.You can also upgrade your sandwich with eggplant, fried potatoes and cauliflower for a measly $1 more.Given how great the falafel was, I decided to stick around and order some baba ganouj ($2.99). It was also excellent. It was presented in a beautiful way, on an actual plate (other places in this price range serve stuff on styrofoam), with six warm, soft slices of pita. I think the baba ganouge could have been roasted slightly more, but it was still wonderfully tart.I went back later for their foule appetizer ($2.99) and lentil soup ($2.99) both of which are vegan by default. The lentil soup was thick and savory, but not over-salted. It was hearty in a way you don't see often enough (Babani's in St. Paul comes close) and definitely hit the spot for a frigid winter day. The foule was also a wonderful dish, consisting of beans, olive oil, herbs and spices, along with some pita. Foule is made specifically from fava beans and you don't see the dish that often on menus in the US. It's a great, refreshing alternative to ubiquitous options like hummus or baba ganouj (both of which can be great, but are also over-played).The service was friendly and I'm impressed that they accept credit cards given how low their prices are. The hours are great, too, as Wally's is open pretty much all day from 9 a.m. to 3 a.m. Great for lunch or a super-late-night snack.My only gripes would be that Wally's doesn't offer whole wheat pita as an option and that they don't have any vegan desserts.

Load it up with some complimentary pickled veggies, yogurt sauce, harissa, etc. and it's a satisfying meal. Whatever you order, I'd recommend going platter vs sandwich - you'll score some bonus hummus and pickled goodies and also won't be wearing your meal once the pita inevitably releases its contents all over your previously clean clothing. Anything coming out of the deep fryer is also a safe bet - the fried cauliflower and cheese curds are anything but healthy, but are quite good.Bonus points for the consistently friendly staff and admirable ingredient sourcing."], ["sam a.", "Finally found Foxy Falafel Truck in downtown Minneapolis and boy was I glad I did.

The sandwich included beet, curry, and traditional falafel balls though each unique flavor was not very distinguishable in the overall mess of tastiness.

Well, that's debatable--depending on what you like in a falafel. I understand that the title of \"best falafel\" is one of deep contention and debate.I like mine moist on the inside, yet crispy on the outside; substantial and yet light. For me, this may very well be the best falafel in town. I love that the insides are green and the outside is golden. I love that they taste so darned fresh; and are never dried out or chewy. Maybe you don't like your falafel that way. I'm not going to tell you what to like. The thing that really impressed me, however, was how absolutely... light... the falafel was. You can taste all the components and it has a distinct veggie-ness to it. It's not just a starchy-textured mass. Oh, and let's talk about the sour mango sauce. I'm not a big sauce-er on my food, but I will DROWN my pita in this stuff. It is so danged tasty. Foxy Falafel also provides a host of pickled things; pickled kohlrabi, cukes and beans were all available the last time I visited. There seems to be some menu variation, though I'm not sure how much or when. They were offering quinoa taboli one time I was there and chicken satay the next time. It'll be fun to try out new things. Foxy is moving from a food-truck-only business to a brick-and-mortar outfit in my neighborhood. I did notice that the first day they were in-building, the service was not nearly as quick and smooth as it is on the truck. They were, however, on their FIRST DAY, so I'm understanding. I'll see how things improve over the next few weeks as the whole wait-order-serve navigation is worked out."], ["Kedar D.", "The falafel here is decent, but not great. A sandwich costs $6 and it comes with five falafel pieces, and lots of lettuce and lemony hummus. For $6 this seems like a gigantic rip-off; I could get nearly twice as much falafel, for half the price, at Wally's in Dinkytown, which is the reigning falafel champ in the Twin Cities, in my opinion. Moreover, Wally's falafel is better quality, and comes with more vegetable filling.The falafel pieces themselves at Foxy Falafel taste pretty good---a nice blend of herbs with a perfectly crispy outer shell.On the other hand, the hummus inside wasn't great, in my opinion, and there was way too much of it. Foxy Falafel definitely didn't get its filling proportions correct and make the sandwich feel like a glorified hummus wrap. You won't see this kind of amateurish production at Wally's.Also, where were the tomatoes? Just lettuce and hummus don't make for a great falafel sandwich. Cucumbers would have been nice, too.I liked that they use a wholewheat pita and bypass that white flour nonsense. That was their one saving grace.In short, Foxy Falafel is too expensive for what it's offering and makes a mediocre product at that.

She told me today that she pickles almost everything she can find, so the selection is always different. I don't even know what a couple of the things I put on top of my sandwich were, but they tasted fantastic. Dressing up your sandwich is half the fun of eating falafel in the first place... and this is like a much tastier version of the condiment bar at Maoz.The only issue with this sandwich is that it has that burrito-syndrome where you just can't get it all the fillings mixed up well enough. So the first bite is all sauce and the last couple bites are all hummus or all cucumber or whatever. I think next time, I'm going to order all the filling in a bowl instead of a pita so it's not such a hot mess towards the end. I saw someone do that after I was already eating mine like an animal.

Seriously."], ["Brad A.", "I guess it's fitting that my first and celebratory Yelp review upon becoming an Elite would go to the Beirut Restaurant. I'm Lebanese by birth and on my father's side. I grew up with homemade Lebanese food. I've been slowly working my way through the Mediterranean/Middle Eastern restaurants in the Cities, and finally, I'm home. These people are the real deal.I'm a pretty light eater for the most part, and though I've been there on multiple occasions now, I still haven't eaten my way past the appetizer menu. Not everyone appreciates the slight bitterness imparted by the sesame seed tahini, but for my money, the Hummus Bi-tahini is off the charts. Often, my dinner consists of nothing but that and the Tabouli, and of course Pita bread. Call me weird, but I love eating Arabic style - using a piece of Pita bread to grab the food, instead of a spoon or fork. I can sign off on the Baba Ghannooj as well - rich, smoky and delicious, and also the Sheikh El-Ba'Atenuen - slices of fried eggplant topped with fresh tomato and a garlic dressing, if you're willing to give up on sex later that night. The garlic will be weeping from your pores, but it's absolutely delicious and indulgent, and vegetarian, if that matters. Top it off with a serving of the wonderful Baklava, and you're in a food coma.The restaurant is just beautiful inside - I posted a picture. Dark, intimate, a lot of wood. Wine in racks. Very classy. The clientele runs the gamut. Every time I've been there, I've seen diners who were beautifully dressed and out for a special occasion, as well as people in jeans and sweatshirts who were just looking for a good meal. The wait staff has always been very gracious - awesome service. A full bar there as well, so pick your favorite poison. They also call themselves a Deli, which means you can pick up on some of their wonderful offerings such as fresh Hummus, Tabouli, Baba Gannooj, and Baklava for a reasonable price from a refrigerated case in front of the restaurant. And I often do.Compare their hummus to the Sabra hummus (a Coca Cola Bottling Company product) that you buy at Costco or some chain grocery store, and let me know what you think :)"], ["Chris C.", "This is our favorite Lebanese restaurant. We have been going here for over 10 years. The food is consistently excellent and the service is always friendly. Some of our favorites are the falafel and their famous garlic sauce. We think the \"Port\" has the best falafel in MN. We have tried lots of other places. We feel bad for \"cheating\" on the Port, but we are always looking for the best. The Port is the place. I could tell so many stories of taking family and friends here to eat. My favorite dishes are the Sultan and the Mezza. I never thought I would items like grape leaves or cabbage rolls. Let me tell you, they are amazing! We love to get jars of their garlic sauce to go along with some flat bread and snack on that for a few days. We recently attended with some friends from out of town. Dave didn't like lamb due to a bad experience while he was in the Navy. I ordered the Mezza with the kafta ka-kobs. Not only did he eat his 2 ka-bobs, he ordered some more to take home. We love to try new restaurants but the Port is one place that we continue to go to as often as we can. Don't let the outside scare you, this food is amazing!"], ["Maggie M.", "Best falafel around. \u00a0Schwarma was most excellent. \u00a0They have this garlic sauce that is perfect when paired with the chicken kabobs. \u00a0The chicken was extremely tender and moist. \u00a0The tabbouleh is very tasty, but it is hard to decide between that and the lettuce salad with the garlic dressing. \u00a0There was even some entertainment with a belly dancer. \u00a0We have been here before and we will be back again!"], ["Ben W.", "Overall I had a better experience than expected.

When I order the meal that includes these, I open them to eat the filling, which is wonderfully delicious, and leave the leaves on the plate. Grape leaves are just sour, horrible, greens. As a lover of greens, it's difficult for me to even say this.The service here, even when super busy, is attentive and spot on. Everyone is glad that you're there and don't make you feel as though you're one of a number.We've eaten nearly everything on the menu. The only thing we avoid is the kibbee when it's a stand-alone dish. We aren't interested in eating raw meats. If you want to try to baked kibbee, you must purchase the couple's meal. If you do this, beware: THIS IS A LOT OF FOOD! \u00a0Even though we always leave with food, ordering this means we've got several meals to eat.If you are seeking to avoid belly dancing (bothers my husband for some reason), a weeknight visit to the restaurant is best. The downside of this is that there can be a lot of children. While I am a mother, I'm not fond of eating in places with a lot of children. Not many parents seem to know how to or bother to discipline their children and teach them the difference between home and out-of-home behavior.If you're seeking Middle Eastern cuisine done right, this is your place.

Why have I failed to not find this place earlier. Snuggled next to Pawn America I can't say I frequent this area all too often but with family nearby we decided on \"Beirut\" as a meeting place. My brother-in-law and his wife are frequent diners here so they were both familiar with the menu. Having tried most everything their recommendation was for the \"Mezza\". A very traditional Lebanese dining experience. If you've got any type of appetite I think this is truly your ticket to paradise. The \"Mezza\" experience begins with a selection of appetizers. A total of 6 to be exact. The great thing is you get to sample all of them. \u00a0The shawirma really steals the show here. The ground lamb and beef is seasoned with spices and thinly sliced. Put a little of that on some Lebanese flat bread and add some garlic sauce or hummus bi-tahini. Top that with some diced tomatoes and all I can say is WOW! \u00a0The falafel is delicious too. It's deep fried to perfection and with a little tahini sauce it's hard to beat.I hope you still have an appetite because the \"Mezza\" doesn't end here. It's followed by your choice of 2 kebabs (chicken, beef or lamb). All this food for a mere $18. Warning...be prepared to bring home some leftover containers.Their entire menu is homemade with only the freshest of ingredients and the food really shows it. Their hummus bi-tahini and garlic sauce are both available for purchase too. We found ourselves bringing \u00a0some home along with that amazing Lebanese flat bread.

They have a good selection of name brand packages teas but they are not listed anywhere so you have to ask. The water for my tea was warm rather than hot so I did not get the full flavor out of my tea. I ordered the chicken and beef kabob and ordered the beef medium rare. My entree came out pretty quickly. The meal came with piping hot, buttery rice pilaf and a light, lemony, flavorful toubouli. For my own taste preference I would have preferred the rice to be a little less buttery. As for their toubouli, I could eat gobs more of it, it was so good. The beef and chicken kabobs were both marinated and flavorful. I think I liked the flavor of the beef more because I like beef. In my opinion, medium rare is nice when a good cut of beef has not yet been marinated to take advantage of its natural flavor. In this case, I will order medium instead of medium rare next time for a firmer texture. The bread that came with it was stiff and cold but I don't know if it's traditionally served that way. I sat near their fridge by the entrance so it was buzzing. But the restaurant in general has a quiet, mellow atmosphere with the music turned low. I will just ask to sit elsewhere next time. Overall for the food that mattered they do a great job. I have a new place I'll want to go to now when I'm in the area!"], ["Lisa M.", "Garlic Sauce!

I called earlier in the day to find out how late they were open. She told me 10 but food until 9:30. She then recommended I make a reservation, which I did for 7:30. Good thing - the place was packed! I ordered a glass of wine while perusing the menu. I decided on a platter with chicken kebabs and falafels. It came with a salad, bread, and rice. I got my salad and *loved* the garlic sauce/dressing. Oh, it was good. We finished our salad and the lights started to dim. I saw the belly dancer coming out, so much to his dismay, I had to move to his side of the table. We looked corny while eating, but enjoyed the show. My platter had 1 kebab with about 7 pieces of nicely grilled, moist and delicious chicken, a 4 falafels cut in half, served with pitas and rice. I loved the chicken and the falafels had a nice crispy outside and flavorful, warm inside. The sauce on the falafels was great as was the rice. The only thing I didn't care for much was the bread. It was a white pita, not warmed up. I tried a couple pieces and then just left the remainder. The bill for 2 was around $45 before tip.

They serve up very, very good Lebanese cuisine, albeit with a limited menu. No chicken shawarma (just tawook), no kofta kebab, and no ghallaba? Big-time bummer.

It's time to give it the lovin' it deserves.

Now there is nothing wrong with those five items, mind you, but if you're gonna make 'em, then at least make them the best you can. And that's what Beirut Restaurant does. I've been to just about every Middle Eastern restaurant I know of in the Twin Cities-- there aren't that many, and some have come and gone over the years-- but Beirut Restaurant has existed in the same spot for 25 years, seemingly small and relatively unnoticed amidst the suburban sprawl of American retail and fast food restaurants on Robert Street. Nevertheless, the food is as good now as it was when I first started going there. The same family owns it. The same recipes are followed. The owners are Lebanese, so you will find menu items at Beirut that you might not find at other M.E. restaurants, such as kibbee.

The meats are great and the garlic sauce that comes with is an excellent bonus. The only reason I don't add the 5th star is because I do give a slight edge to Emily's. The prices are a bit high in comparison and the portions are much more generous at Emily's.

I usually don't like so much parsley, but this was tasty. Also came with rice mixed with vermicelli and a side of garlic butter (I think it was butter?) Anyway, the garlic was so intense the spread was actually bitter. But it was perfect to add to the kabobs and rice (which had garlic in them already.)Husband got the shawirma (gyro) dinner ($12.50) with the seasoned ground lamb and beef slices sitting in a pool of very garlicky tahini sauce. I thought the sauce was bitter, but if you like tahini, then you'll love this preparation. He started off with a green salad tossed in a, you guessed it, garlic dressing. It was fantastic.

It's cheesy, meaty and comforting like a warm blanket fresh out of the dryer. The mussels with linguini is equally amazing. The sauce, a soft broth of white wine, garlic and butter, is beautiful in its simplicity. There's nothing quite like listening to the soft clacking of the mussel shells while you spin a forkful of pasta.Other highlights include the Linguini Bolognese (creamy, satisfying and just a touch spicy from the sausage), the Arancini Di Risotto (crispy, cheesy and a great start to the meal) and, of course, the garlic bread.I'm blown away by the prices at this place.

The Hot Dago came with a good portion size. A huge piece of bread of bread topped with spicy sausage, spaghetti sauce, and mozzarella cheese. The spaghetti sauce and sausage didn't stand out to me. I couldn't help but think this was just over-glorified cheesy bread. I also got to try their Chicken Alfredo. I thought this was a lot better than the Dago. A light Alfredo sauce and fall apart chicken really shined. I also had a really good dessert. The Tiramisu was great. It was soft, sweet, and light tasting.

The service is mighty good, too. \u00a0Some interesting notes of historic significance: The banquet room in back, a great place for a reception, a reunion, or a retirement, used to be a bowling alley. But the balls got dusty and DeGidio's had the foresight to make a transition. I'm damn glad they did; I've enjoyed many an event there. There's some sort of lore surrounding the original proprietor, Joe DeGidio. They call him \"Kid Bullets.\" I don't know why. I mean, I can guess, but there's nothing specific mentioned in the menu. For good reason, I imagine. Maybe I don't want to know that the ghost of a Mafioso-type haunts the building. It's cool to think it's possible, though. The photos of Mr. DeGidio depict a service-oriented family man, and that is all the people need to know.There's been a recent menu change where everything's Italian now. For example, there used to be a bacon cheeseburger on the menu, which was likely the best burger this side of the river (Sorry Blue Door and Moe's). Now, it's some sort of an Italian burger, a Paisano patty melt, I guess. Still very good, but I kind of miss the old menu.

Here is why I like this place - I know what I'm getting, the food comes fast, the meatballs are great and I don't even eat meat, portions are way too big (so you can have leftovers...mmmm) and it all tastes good. I had the baked (with either a meatball - which I chose -or Italian sausage) rigatoni special which came with a dinner salad. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. I kept eating even while full - shocking, I know! I chose the special based on the fact I got a salad. I typically choose the baked mostaccioli which a salad would be extra. My dining companion had the baked mostaccioli and added meatballs and sausage. I found the sausage to be a bit spicy for my liking. Now, some of the cons of the evening = the service was okay, refills on beverages were not offered. I love bread, but I don't care for the bread that comes with the meal. It reminds me of the crap from the freezer section with garlic and butter on both sides that you bake in the oven. I do however recommend the garlic cheese bread from the appetizer menu.

I have visited the middle east numerous times on business. I also lived in France for a while where North African cuisine is very popular (cous cous appears to be a national dish there) so I don't believe I am a novice with regard to the food. \u00a0Our group started with a fairly large selection of the appetizers which were ho hum at best. I had the lamb tagine which I found pretty tasteless and which lacked the citrus flavor of preserved lemons which I associate with tagine. \u00a0Service was slow, \u00a0when our meal arrived I ordered a second glass of wine which did not arrive until I had almost finished and at that point I did not really want it any more. \u00a0We sampled the middle eastern pastries for desert and they really were nothing I could recommend.

Besides the hummus, my group of 5 ordered a few more small plates to share: -Turk Hummus - Very tasty! Would order again. -Slow Cooked Green Beans - These were a little mushy and sweet for my taste. \u00a0-Grilled Haloumi Cheese - Honestly, i felt like this tasted like a good, grilled string cheese. \u00a0I liked it, but I don't know if I would order again because it was really small.-Middle Eastern Sausage - Looked like breakfast sausages, but very flavorful. \u00a0The sausages came in a lemony sauce that was delicious when mixed with the sausage and pita.-Green Salad - Good, but unremarkable. \u00a0The smoked paprika bread crumbs added a nice crunch. For my entree, I split the seafood tagine. \u00a0It had 3 types of seafood (sadly, I can only remember the mussels) in a tomato-y broth with chick peas. \u00a0i had heard this was wonderful, but I only thought it was okay, so maybe it is just not my type of dish. Although the food was good (probably closer to 4 stars), the service was closer to 2 stars. \u00a0Our waitress seemed aloof and condescending. \u00a0She didn't come to check on the food or ask if we needed something after we received the dishes. \u00a0I'm thinking I will try Happy Hour, but I doubt I go back for dinner."], ["John B.", "Very nice atmosphere.

You can tell this guy, and the chef and others working with him, all know what they are doing.We enjoyed a wide range of food, ordering lots of dishes so we could all have a taste and share/talk about the dishes. We had the pita and Msabaha hummus to start which was warm and flavorful and so very satisfying. Then for dinner we ordered a smattering of dishes:- Beef Ham & Manchego Cheese Croquettes: these fried little balls of amazing sort of reminded us all of arancini.- Fried Cauliflower - Cooked perfectly and fairly light for being fried, these were flavorful and came with a great sauce.- Charred baby artichokes - These were savory and lemony little bites; refreshing and satisfying.- Large Lamb Shoulder Tagine - We ordered a large serving for the four of us to share and it was the right amount of food for four. The meat was so tender and well seasoned, it was falling off the bone. The broth had these sweet red peppers in them which I kept compulsively stealing out of the community spot. I also really enjoyed the soft green olives in there and chickpeas. Overall, it was a great evening and I would love to come back and try even more dishes.

As I was a bit preoccupied with conversation, I can't really give a good review of the setting and atmosphere other than they had neatly colored walls; however, the food was excellent. The portion sizes are what they should be everywhere with just enough so that you're not stuffing yourself and not so little that you're still hungry. And for the dollar, it was perfectly cooked and delicious. My date and I had the falafel combo and chicken tagine. The staff was polite and responsive. Also my date and I were able to talk to the chef about his business and compliment him on his tasty cuisine.

And they had decent wine!Vibe reminds me of my favorite cosy restaurant, Namaste Cafe in Minneapolis. Must go."], ["Patrick H.", "The Barbary Fig is kinda funky, in a homey sort of way. The diner enters on the bottom floor, into a deli space that seems (at least at the hour of our visit) to be shut down. Normally, this would be disconcerting, but someone appeared and assured us that we would be seated promptly. We were, but it appears that only the second floor was open for seating, which might prove unwieldy or impossible for those with mobility limitations (it is possible that seasonal patio seating is available in warmer months, from the looks of things).The dining area features rough-plastered, orange-painted walls, giving everything a warm glow. Our servers were pleasant and welcoming. Both of these factors gave me and my girlfriend a good first impression, even though the food was a bit hit-or-miss.We split the Brik appetizer (basically, tuna and scallions in a fried flaky pastry crust). In retrospect, we should have each ordered our own -- or perhaps a couple of plates each -- because it was quite tasty and satisfying. The accompanying harissa consisted of a somewhat generic red chili, and would be inoffensive to the average Minnesotan palate. While I could have used some extra kick, it complemented the dish well.Both of us ended up choosing the same entree, which consisted of merguez sausage, vegetables, and eggs. Frankly, this was a little bland, and a little more like \"breakfast\" than I had been expecting. It was also a little skimpy, considering the menu price. I didn't notice any major variances in the price points for other menu items, but (based on observation of other tables receiving their meals) there do seem to be significant differences in portion size and plating effort/appeal. I guess we picked a dud. In a similar vein, our desserts were okay, but nothing to gush over.Uneven quality of the food aside, there was definitely something about the overall vibe of the Barbary Fig that really spoke to me. The comfortable-if-ramshackle nature of the space, the laid-back-yet-on-point staff, and the surrounding tables of relaxed, happy customers, all combined to create an appealing alchemy. I look forward to returning someday."], ["T W.", "Nice outside deck seating for a relaxed lunch. My combo plate was great with lots of flavor and texture.

I would like to note that there were only five other tables occupied at the restaurant (most of which already had food), so I don't think that it was because the kitchen was horribly behind. \u00a0Then when we got our food, my Merguez Sausage Couscous tasted and looked as if they had dumped half a cup of oil onto it. \u00a0However, my friend got the Minty Dill Lentils, which were ok.All and all, the service was terrible and the food wasn't good."], ["Michael P.", "Without a doubt one of the best restaurants in St. Paul.

Felt like a valued customer rather than just another \"cha-ching\" in their cash register.Had the gyro again (which was excellent again) and my girlfriend tried one of their specials and loved it.

Lots of vegan, vegetarian and gluten free options. Locally sourced. Decent beer selection. A little bit spendy, but I can tell you that I feel a lot better about life walking out of there than I do leaving Keyes (too greasy and white bread-y for me). Worth the extra few dollars.

They had a beet falafel, and I knew that I HAD to try something that would include it.Other than the tables being really close together because it is a small space, I've no downsides to Foxy Falafel.

Great for a gluten free (or vegetarian or vegan) snack, or an entire meal. The falafel are crisp and savory and pairs well with the creamy traditional tzatziki. Try the beet side it's refreshing with a spicy kick. The cheese curds are a small piece of heaven - crispy and dilled on the outside with a gooey, creamy, slightly salty cheese on the inside, served with honey, which surprisingly pairs well with these curds - who'd have thought?"], ["Beth A.", "Such a delicious, delicious concept. The stoplight sandwich is so absolutely amazing. Having all three flavors of falafel (original, beet and curry) and sweet potato fries is divine. I've tried the platter before but I much prefer the sandwich. Whatever you do, go stoplight.. At least once. I also enjoyed the grilled cauliflower with saffron as a addition to my order. I love to order pick up from work and have it ready when I arrive. If you want lunch seating, I recommend arriving at 11/11:30 for optimum seating choices because it gets pretty busy around noon. Enjoy!"], ["Chris M.", "For the most part I dig what Foxy is doing. Sure, it's a bit spendy for falafel and the restaurant is about the size of a broom closet, but their menu is fairly focused and generally hits the mark.The namesake falafel is quite good (especially the curry falafel) and I wouldn't begrudge anyone making any claims that Foxy is putting out some of the best in the Cities. The lamb burger is also quite toothsome, albeit quite awkward to eat in a pita. Speaking of the pita - they aren't very sturdy, so you might be better off getting whatever you're ordering as a platter, since it's ultimately going to be all over your plate anyway. The only disappointment I have come across is the turkey shawarma; sustainable and local it may be, but tasty, beefy and lamby like it's traditional counterpart it ain't.As others have mentioned, Foxy is going to set you back a few more bucks than your typical falafel/shawarma shop. A lot of that is a result of the quality of the ingredients used; though yes, prices are higher and portions are smaller than what you're going to find elsewhere in town. That said, I'm cool paying a bit more for lamb that comes from MN versus the processed spindle everyone else is serving."], ["Susannah H.", "I really like Foxy Falafel! \u00a0The quality and taste of the food is pretty great. \u00a0I'm also super psyched to try their brunch. My only complaints/what's keeping me from 5-stars is the price and lack of condiments. \u00a0Price...it's a bit much for falafel. \u00a0When I first went here, they had the pickles and sauces all available for you. \u00a0Perhaps due to people taking all of the pickles/sauce, they did away with the self-serve bar. \u00a0I miss it though."], ["Stephanie O.", "I was a fan of Foxy's before it was a brick and mortar, but when I found out the restaurant was moving into my neighborhood I was ecstatic. The owner did not disappoint, applying the fresh and local approach to her menu but also extending that attitude to the restaurant's decor: there are almost always fresh flowers near the register and sometimes on the tables, they regularly rotate art displayed on the walls by local artists, and early on the owner shared Instagram shots of DIY projects like mason jar light fixtures and unique coat hooks, all of which cement the kitschiness of the space.The prices have gone up a bit since they opened and a filling, well-rounded meal can actually get a bit steep depending on what you order, especially for some of the weekend brunch offerings. Having learned that the hard way (because my friends and I really weren't that impressed with their brunch), I typically try to stick to what they do best: falafel balls. The stoplight is always pleasant as it gives a sampling of their three balls: original/Foxy, curry, and beet. The beet's flavor is a bit bland but it's almost worth getting the stoplight to see the delightful shade of magenta after a bite. The curry is my favorite as it's not overpowering but still maintains a tiny kick. Aside from the balls, Foxy's other pride and joy is the freshly pickled produce offerings. They were once available for self-serving but presumably due to cost, they've changed the pickles to a side option for around $2. If you haven't tried them, take the leap. It'll be $2 well-spent."], ["BK J.", "Grand opening day and Foxy was on point!I stopped in after an afternoon volunteering and needed something for dinner. \u00a0I opted for two stoplight gluten free platters and some beet salad. \u00a0There was a bit of a wait, but after all it was grand opening day. \u00a0Once the food was ready I stepped up to the pickle bar to \"put my mark on it\" with a more than ample selection of pickled veggies and sauces.Travel through time about half an hour that it took me to get the food home (okay, I don't live anywhere near St. Paul) and the food was most excellent. \u00a0Even with the travel time the falafel was still nice and crispy, and tasty to boot. \u00a0Cabbage slaw was killer, as was the hummus. \u00a0Tomatoes and cuke were exactly as I like them (note - never ever gotten an unred tomato from Foxy). \u00a0If you need to get some falafel to go and you have a bit of a drive/bike ride/jog, I really recommend you get it as a gluten free platter, a sandwich wouldn't hold up as well as the platter does.So glad you are open Foxy and I am looking forward to even more great food from you in the future!"], ["Elias A.", "We stopped in for a Saturday afternoon lunch and had really good sandwiches.

The falafel is smaller than expected but they pack 'em in and that harissa sauce: damn. Very fresh flavors and crisp veggies: not gonna feel regretful after eating anything here. The turkey gyro meat does have a slightly unusual irony taste: maybe turkey blood is used to give it that grey gyro-ish flavor? I'd still get it again. After all, what's a little meat without blood?

While it is quite a hike from the U to Foxy Falafel, I managed to make it there and back in just over an hour. Not bad! Service was fast and the restaurant wasn't packed, so it seems that the odds were in my favor that day. My coworker and I ordered beet falafel sandwiches and pita chips with hummus. I cannot express in words how delicious that sandwich was! Beet falafel, who would've thunk it? The beet falafel were crispy and savory, and yet still moist. The preserved lemon and goat cheese sauce was to-die-for! Only quip is that it was mostly near the bottom of the pita pocket. And did I mention that the pita chips and hummus were homemade? Chips to hummus ratio was spot-on! While the price tag may be too steep to eat here every lunch, I would recommend this restaurant because it is locally-owned and strides to support the community.

At $25, I thought it was pretty steep for lunch so I was expecting perfection.Everything tasted pretty good, but my falafel balls were not hot, just luke warm. Given the wait, I was hoping they would be steaming. I also thought the sandwich could have used more hummus, and it would have been nice to get it on the side so you have something to dip the pita chips into, on their own they are pretty dry.The cheese curds were the saving grace of our lunch.

Also, the portion sizes are very small which made it frustrating trying to order enough to be full.

The food truck experience was the best--service was fast and the food tasted fresh. Service was a lot slow when you first opened up the brick-and-mortar store, but I chalked that up to opening jitters/working out the kinks. The food was still fresh and wonderful. And now? Well, you've taken away the sauces. Errr, I mean, you can still GET the sauces. Well. One sauce. You'll have to pay 50 cents for each additional sauce. And you can't squirt it on yourself--it comes in a messy little cup. And no more sour mango sauce? Sad times.Also the pickled-items bar. Maybe people were abusing this, I get it. So you took it away. Now it's a $2 charge for a pickle plate. I probably wouldn't care had you not been free and easy with the pickles and the sauces in the beginning and gotten increasingly more restrictive. It feels punitive. I miss having 3-4 pickled green beans with my falafel. But still, if I hadn't been there before I wouldn't know what I was missing, so it felt unfair to judge you on that. Today I returned again and got a stoplight platter. The usually fresh-tasting and *perfectly* cooked falafel balls were hard as rocks and...cold. Cold. And they didn't taste great. And they were tiny. Didn't they used to be bigger? I got 5 kinda-burnt (and definitely burnt-tasting) pita chips with my order and the hummus tasted funny. I wasn't inhaling it like I usually do. You can buy fancy flavored waters with ice in your glass or you can get free tap...but the tap water is lukewarm since it's been sitting on the counter all day and there are no ice options for you. I just...I dunno Foxy. I want to feel warm and wonderful about you again.

Moderately priced at around $8, the paella was a delicious mix of clams, shrimp, calamari, craw fish, olives, beans and rice perfectly seasoned.

These folks know thier stuff, and also are very personable - talk to them sometime if you are there and the line is not too long behind you. \u00a0The chef has a solid resume that includes some time in Barcelona and he brings that 'high-end\" experience into this smaller operation, that simplicity I mentioned is part of that, another part is the ability to adapt to what can be had from the marketplace in a particular week or what his customers ask for...slight tweaks to dishes like paella that make it a lot of fun to see how it came out each Wednesday. \u00a0So, bottomline is that they are very good at what they do, great food at a very reasonable price. \u00a0As noted by an earlier reviewer, the best skyway paella that one will ever have and for me one that reminds me of other paellas from other kitchens, mostly those of friends."], ["Sharon R.", "Excellent homemade and fresh food.Try the $2.00 Egg and Tomato Sandwich.My favorite is the Garbanzo con Chrizo for $4.00 and the Gyro's for $6.00.

The cheese curds were as expected, cheesy, but they are significantly more crunchy and less oily than state fair cheese curds. Both the cheese curds and fries come with this yummy pink sauce that really complements the fries and cheese curds. The fries were crispy, but they did not have a single inkling of saffron flavor. Not bad though...My main gripe was that the fair lady came out charred on both sides of the burger. It had two crusts of burnt meat on either side, which tainted the taste of the meat and made the burger seem rather dry. The inside had cheese, but between two dry slabs of meat slapped together, it was not the most appealing juicy lucy, or burger I've ever had for that matter.

Their cheese pie (pita bread topped with cheese) is so good and goes well with any meal you might prepare at home.For the deli / hot food section, they make some killer gyros and samosas. Their fries are good too, and ask for additional sauces. They have cucumber sauce and others that are sealed in their own special cups with their brand name on them.

I lived with a Syrian family in the past and my best friend is Lebanese, so I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to middle eastern anything. I thought I was going to have to just stock up when I visited Dearborn next time. Boy, was I wrong! I was just looking in the wrong spots.As I entered the store the heavenly scent of the restaurant greeted me. I knew instantly - Holy Land Grocery is exactly what I was looking for and now I can prepare my own middle eastern food. But today, I went right for the easy comfort-food!The store itself is small and slightly over-priced, however, I was expecting this as it's THE middle eastern grocery store. The selection itself was fantastic. Anything you want is there. I wanted to buy everything in sight, but I settled for Labne, canned cucumbers, olives from the deli-area, dolmas, and bread.I just chowed down and nothing disappointed! I can't stop smiling!!!

Chicken or beef. You can't go wrong unless you forget to tell them to sauce it with tahini instead of the cucumber sauce.While you are there pick a bag of their handmade pita bread (the one with yellow label). you are going to need it to re-stuff the meats and flaffel into two or three more sandwiches."], ["Amir S.", "1- Food: I have not yet tried their deli. But I've eaten their food at several catered events and I assume they should be the same. Their food is just OK. It's not exceptional and probably won't surprise you.Holy Land is famous for its hummus. Although it's frankly not the best hummus you can eat in town, its taste and quality is higher than average. The thing you should know is that they use lots of tahini in their hummus. If you're tired of hummus and are looking for an alternative, I suggest their baba ghanoush. I like Holy Land's baba ghanoush better than their hummus. If you're into eggplant, as I am, you'll love it. \u00a0 2- Bread:They bake their own bread and also sell bread from other bakeries. It's up to you if you want to try different types of bread they bake or carry; but I'm confident that after trying all of them you'll confirm that Holy Land's best bread (in terms of quality and taste) is their Lavash which you could buy for less in their own stores. 3- Cheese and Olive:In addition to diverse Middle Eastern types of cheese, you could find a variety of bulk and bottled olives and olive salads here. I've only tried Nablusi cheese which was super salty. I think you should keep the cheese in water for a day and rinse it several times so you could eat it. My problem with their olive and olive salads is that they taste like artificial acid (not vinegar). Although they may taste fine, I don't feel I'm eating natural olive!4- Grocery:You'll find in their grocery dep. all you may need for a Middle Eastern lifestyle! What they carry isn't simply limited to what's needed for ME dishes. You also could find special \"pitcher\"s Muslims use to wash themselves in bathroom! My problem with their grocery dep. is that it happened to me at least two times that I took something from shelves and then I noticed they've already been expired. Also, once I \u00a0bought sausage, and after I noticed there is traces of labels on all of the packages but no expiration date, I asked them to tell me when they'll be expired and the staff member said they won't expire!"], ["Virgil W.", "Having lived in the Arabian Gulf for upwards of 30 years, I know a thing or two about Middle Eastern - particularly Arab - food, and I was frankly stunned to discover that the Holy Land produces food that is actually authentic!!! \u00a0I've only been there a couple o times and have by no means eaten my way around the menu, but what I had was spot-on. \u00a0The falafel are as good as you'll get in Dubai or Muscat or Riyadh. \u00a0The baba ghanuj (eggplant-based dip) is first-rate. And the kofta kebabs were as good as you'll find anywhere in Egypt or the Levant. \u00a0The rice, of course, was good; Arab cooks would be totally mortified if it weren't perfect. \u00a0And based on what I had, they used a good basmati and not some unpleasant short-grained version. \u00a0Great tabouleh, too, with just the right amount of acid from the lime juice. As for the \"khubz\" (flat bread), it was excellent and the loaves were the proper size. \u00a0Too often here they're much too big. \u00a0Complaints? If I have any, they would be about the huge portions you get -- but that's a complaint I have against almost all American restaurants -- and the meat cubes on skewered kebabs are also too big. \u00a0In the Middle East, the meat chunks are never more than about 3/4 of an inch on a side; here they're usually more like 2-3 inches. \u00a0You just can't grill such huge chunks quickly enough to produce the authentic article, I'm afraid."], ["Adel A.", "The gyro is great. Hummus is great with the pita (flat) bread. The lamb kabab was good. The portion was huge for 1 person. The cucumber sauce was tangy and tasty on top of the gyro.

The yellow rice was cooked to perfection."], ["Streetkred M.", "I can't believe i haven't reviewed this earlier. I love holy land. It has big sandwiches, and low prices.

It was one of many in your menu rack, honor your 9.99 price. Anyway after much convincing she agree to the above intro price of 10.99. Why the hassle over one or two bucks...? Because they were rude, condescending, wrong and unbendable.

Actually I don't know if falafel king is better....i've never been there but it's not possible to get better falafel than here. SERIOUSLY!!! They were utter perfection. I find falafel makers tend to parsley the hell out of their mix and dry em out more than a popcorn fart while they're at it. For this reason I've never been a huge falafel fan. Thank you Holy Land for showing me the falafel promised land. These things have the right amount of parsley, are gloriously crunchy on the outside and still moist on the inside. I ordered the vegetarian combo (I've never had so much food for $10) but after biting into these tasty tidbits wished i had ordered one of the massive falafel sandwiches. Boo. The rest of the combo was a salad, hummus, dolmades, tabouleh, pita, dip and spanikopita. I hadn't had anything to eat all day and couldn't finish it. The good: falafel, hummus, salad, pita, dolmades. Dolmades aren't the best i've had but they are good. The hummus is almost perfect. I only wish they would add a hint of garlic to it. Most places I've had homemade hummus they do this and it just takes the hummus to a heavenly place. The salad is quite simple with tomatoes, feta, olives, cucumbers and a tatziki like dressing. \u00a0They give you a massive amount of pita. It's literally two whole pitas. The eh: the spanikopita and tabouleh. On the latter it's not their fault...I've never had at tabouleh that I've enjoyed. I blame the parsely and the dryness. With the spanikopita I blame two things: it was made with a flat (and flavorless) bread when i much more prefer the greek style with filo dough making it more of a preference issue than execution. On the other hand I found the seasoning to be underwhelming. It really just tasted like wilted spinach. Some salt. oregano, lemon and black pepper would have made it much much better. Even some crumbled feta thrown in would have done the trick. The store side is incredible. i can't imagine there is a better place to stock up on mediterranean foods. Fresh feta, olives and breads among other things. Instead of using pizza crusts when making pizza at home come here for the huge flatbread (lebaneese i think) and throw that on the grill. It's a perfect thickness for pizza on the grill."], ["Nick S.", "Gyro plate was the bomb.

But there are a few servers that aren't the best. For example, last night I went with my friends and we waited 55 minutes for a patio table even when the wait was 45. Not a big deal, but when we sat down, we constantly felt like we were getting forgotten about. Our drinks came fast, but after we ordered a hookah, it never came. Our food finally came, and then the hookah came after the food. That was irritating because the whole reason we usually get hookah is to have it while we wait for food! Our pita baskets remained empty, so when we tried to go up to the bar to ask for more, it took about 5-10 minutes for anyone to notice you. I always end up asking favors to the people that I know working there if my server disappears. A really nice server named Josh would always help us out when we needed something too, but he wasn't our server. Found out that our server had a table of 25 inside that night too, so I felt bad and we brushed her service off!Prices are decent. An entree can be 20+, but they are very generous on portion size. Pita bread baskets are included and Greek salads come with most entrees, so trust me, you will be full! If you're worried about prices, their apps are great, the Greek salad is so good, but if you want an entree, get the basil pasta - filling, yummy and only $10! Their gyro meat is delicious too so you can't go wrong! The hookah price increased since I've been going there, and now it's $20 per hookah (split with only 3-4 people), so if you split its not bad. They also replace coals multiple times for us! Overall, I want people to know that there are a lot of super awesome people that work here, but with that, there are some servers that I know aren't the best. I would go back though because it's basically like a tradition with my friends and I - hookah and outdoor patio is the place to be! Food is constantly yummy too! Come here if you don't mind staying a while, or for the outdoor patio!Side note: they added some tables to the patio with stone fires in the middle. Is that what they're even called? You know, the sparkly blue rocks that are in the middle of the table with an automatic fire coming out from them... Haha it's great whatever it is. Plus they have some heat lamps if it gets chilly at night!"], ["Matt M.", "Josh was an awesome server. Food was amazing. I want to marry the belly dancer!I ordered the chicken kabobs of shish tahwook I think was the menu name. If you like greek food this is one of the best places you'll find in Minnesota."], ["Louise M.", "I introduced my boss to Baba Ganouj yesterday. Today, El Jefe is in love with it. On our way home from a week long road trip, he asked me.. \"Is there a place we can get some Baba Ganouj between Des Moines and Twin Cities?\" I told him no.. Not until Burnsville. He said.. \"Mh.. About four hours? I can hold out for four hours.\" Wow! He really wanted some more Baba Ganouj! He was willing to wait till 8:00 PM to eat. Luckily, I had a late lunch.When we got to Mediterranean Cruise Cafe, we were surprised on how nice the place was. Dita D and I had talked about going here but we haven't made that into a reality. However, I knew it was good. This part of Burnsville was also very nice. There was a park nearby and it seemed like it would be a very nice place in the summer.We got seated right away and some blond voluptuous lady was doing a very sexy belly dancing in the middle of the dining room. We both laughed as though I was kinda thinking that they might have had it, it was another thing when I actually saw it. My boss was just tickled because usually our dinners and trips never got this exciting. He said this was better than the hummus from the Courtyard Marriott lobby bistro. I'd say.Baba Ganouj was ordered right away though after that we saw they have all kinds of dips. I would have loved to try their avocado hummus. That sounded yummy! They have a huge menu and it took us awhile to study it. After several minutes as we ate the Baba Ganouj, I decided on a Sheik dinner consisting of filet mignon kebabs, gyros, and shrimp served over rice. Boss was getting seafood but when it came time to order, he ordered the same dish I did. What a copy kitty.The Baba Ganouj or they spelled it Ganouje, was excellent. In fact, it was much better than the one we had last night and the one from last night was delicious! I liked the texture on this one. It was a bit more chunky and you could see some green color from the eggplant to differentiate the complex texture. It was great and tasted soooo delicious with the pita bread. Plus, the portion was much bigger and it was the same price as the one last night ($8).When dinner came, it was a humongous plate. It's beautiful and filled with meats - a skewer of the filet mignon kebab, an ample mound of shaved gyros, two pieces of grilled shrimps per our request instead of fried, grilled vegetables, and a serving of rice. The filet was so flavorful and tender. It's cooked just right and tasted so yummy with the grilled veggie. The shrimps were divine! It actually reminded me of my mom's fried shrimps. It had an uncanny taste to the shrimps I ate when I was a child. The gyros were also spot on. They were just terrific!! Boss was happy too and kept saying it was off the chart. I didn't finish my dinner but I will have a very nice lunch tomorrow. Boss finished everything on his plate. Oh forgot, they also served us a nice salad garnished with feta and kalamata olives. It was a huge meal but for $25, you got a lot of food. Unlike yesterday, we got more of the main items here instead of the accompaniments. One more thing I love also was that they offer various combination dishes where you can mix and match meats and various things. That way, you can try different things instead of just eating a lot of one thing. They also have packaged dinner for a group of people or dinner for two for very reasonable price.A little on the negative side was the music was a bit loud and it was hard to hear. My boss didn't enjoy his Malbec wine. I had a sangria and it was great! I had nothing to complain about my drink! Another surprise was I ordered one finger roll per Dita's suggestion and they gave it to me for free. It was sweeeeet and yummmmmm. I got 10% off for check-in offfer from Yelp. I used it and saved us a little money. We were about to leave but another belly dancer started dancing with silver wings! She also had a sword! She looked like Jibril, the angel, wiggling away, flapping her wings. Dinner was marvelous and it was a great way to close this long ass but very productive week. We both felt we deserved the nice meal. Dropping off my boss at his house 10 miles away from the restaurant, I realized he lives on a street called Aladin Trail. It has been an Arabian type of night.

Everything was wonderful except the lamb, it was very fatty and I couldn't eat it. \u00a0I gave my potatoes to my kiddo and he loved them. The kabobs were excellent and the vegetables were awesome.

It was a flavor I haven't experienced before but I will be back for more. As a sweets fan the dessert options were familiar to even gyro joints so I dug in and was impressed with those as well.

Nothing inside, so I shoved some lettuce in. The tahini sauce is on the side, and you'll need extra. Some pieces of grilled eggplant, and steak fried potatoes, nicely salted, and pretty good. A soda is $3, do I hear overhead. I passed on that with water, and no offer of refills. I'm looking forward to the other traditional Greek items after Orthodox Easter, May 5.

You always get your food fast and we can, usually, find a table."], ["Erin G.", "I've been wanting to come here for breakfast for ages but their breakfast ends early at 11 am, so I haven't had a chance! Finally I had my opportunity and I was not disappointed! Counter service place. \u00a0I was torn between the crab cake benedict and the shakshouka but ended up selecting the shakshouka because it's more unique. I asked the girl behind the counter and she said they were both two of her favorites. I was definitely not disappointed! It came out in a little skillet and came with a variety of veggies and fruit and pita and olives and feta. The flavors were amazing. It's a cute little joint too. They have a huge variety of cakes behind the counter that looked delicious. Evidently they are from Buttercream. Definitely drool worthy.I can't wait to come back and try everything on the menu."], ["Jenny A.", "If I could lie in bed all day slathered in babaganoush, I would do it. If I could get the chunks of eggplant to squeeze through a syringe, I would inject it into my veins and live out the rest of my days on a crazy 'ganoush high... Or it would instantly stop my heart and I would die. But, I would die happy.Are you kidding me with this place? The crab cake benedict on pita was ridiculous. Thick cake, perfectly poached egg and covered in rich hollandaise sauce. This had the opportunity to send me over the edge, but the rosemary potatoes were a slight disappointment so I stopped short. Don't let that stop you from ordering this monster of a meal. One cake down and I was delirious. I saved the other half, Sam W. masterfully heated it up for me and I indulged in it again in the comfort of my own home. The gyro is massive. It's sloppy. It's the best gyro I have had since moving to Minnesota 21 and 3/4 years ago. To spare Sam the embarrassment of having to cover me from hulking out with a food boner, I ate this thing with a fork and didn't get all weird with it in my face. It was close, though. Really close..With a tag of $6 for a gyro that can probably feed you at least once and a half, you can't go wrong here. The side of sweet potato fries is cheap, delicious and go unbelievably well with the garlic sauce. If I didn't offend anyone while I was here, I definitely did when I left. I've tried plenty of Mediterranean restaurants, but Shish is the only one that's ever made me want to get 'ganoushed pretty much daily. They're going to need a helpline for people like me."], ["Rachel E.", "Try the shish curry with chicken (the green kind). It is one of the few dishes I've had that I crave, I talk about it, dream about it even. It. Is. Amazing. \u00a0The mushroom soup is made fresh per the order and such a treat! Also, the Arabic tea is fresh and good to the last drop!"], ["Josh K.", "Everyone! I need your attention... I am missing some gyro meat that should have been on my plate Saturday morning. If you're in the Grand/Snelling area and catch it strolling around aimlessly, please message me. There is no reward, but I may buy you breakfast. Thank you.With that out of the way, I stopped in at Shish on Saturday morning after putting it off a week and going off the recommendation of a friend of mine. It's a Grand in StP, expect street parking unless you can get into one of the local lots. For those unaware, it's an order at the counter, menu is on a chalk board on a wall, get a number, sit and wait place. I stood there gazing at the menu and had to ask myself, WWPEJD? What would pancake eating Jesus do? Order pancakes with breakfast or just get a breakfast specialty? Well he said to order pancakes. And I did... along with the Greek omelet which sounded amazing, gyro, feta cheese, kalamata olives, spinach, red bell peppers, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes & red onion; served with rosemary potatoes, toast and fruit.Pop a squat with a coffee, and wait 5-7 minutes or so when the chow arrives. Everything looks great, omelet is pretty, taters look solid, cakes are a double short stack of small cakes - hell yeah, lets dig in.Then I notice... I've got a lot of tzatziki... Like a lot a lot. No worries. I love that stuff. Then I notice under the pillow of tzatziki, my gyro meat has only left me faint clues he was there. To tune of 3 miniscule slices. I shit you not, I had 3 tiny shavings of meat. To do some recon, I pull up Yelp, search Shish and look at pics of this breakfast from other users. Wow, they must have got all the gyro meat previously! Bastards not leaving me any! You can see the couple of pieces sticking out of the tzatziki in my pic. That was it folks. Whatever, I now start eating my nearly vegetarian omelet in disappointment. Flavor is solid, the tomatoes give it a real acidic flavor and the tzatziki provides a nice cool cuce flavor. Decent hint of dill. But, the feta cheese on top, was ice cold and added nothing at all. Do yourself a favor and stick this brick inside hte omelet so it melts a bit and the flavor rolls into the dish. Rosemary spuds were a total miss. Some were cold, the edges were barely crisp and they literally fell apart. Just a total let down. Fruit... well, it was fruit and not fucked up. Congrats. Pancakes... the only thing that keeps this from being a 1 star. The cakes were a solid buttermilk and the cream with them was really nice. You can debate whether syrup is needed on your own time, I rolled with syrup although a preserve wouldn't have been bad either (especially something tarty to go with the salty butter flavor). Low and behold I'm done eating and get out. It was too early to be an asshole to the people that worked there. I simply wasn't happy and figured swearing at my steering wheel on my drive back to the NW burbs was more worth it. My final thought, the breakfast was great in theory, very poorly executed. Put the gyro meat and cheese in the damn omelet. Cold hard cheese on top and gyro meat outside of an omelet that is full of big chunked veggies which then makes it REALLY tough to get a bite of everything is just asinine to me."], ["Farah A.", "I have enjoyed Shish for dinner a couple of times, and I found the pictures of their breakfast platters mouth watering which made me decide to stop by and give it a try! I was hugely disappointed! \u00a0The falafel was okay, the cheese was good, however the meat they topped the hummus with tasted awful! Whether it was bad meat, old oil, not sure but it was absolutely disgusting. The potatoes were fried in what tasted like the same oil the meat was cooked in, and they were undercooked. The only reason they get 4 stars is because of their dinner menu.I highly recommend Shish for dinner, their lamb shank special is delicious, \u00a0and so is their shish tawooq."], ["Jamie P.", "Tasty, not real Med food but a hipsterfied take. Tasty overall. I got the lamb burger, juicy and well cooked! My girlfriend got the shawarma and enjoyed it greatly. Would've been nice to see a better selection besides Americanized sandwiches but if that's what this place is going for, it does it well. The place was super inexpensive to boot. Worth popping in for lunch, if you're in the area!"], ["Patti I.", "On second thought...I returned to try different menu items. My husband ordered the moussaka (eggplant-meat-potato casserole) and I got a lamburger with fries. Both lacked flavor. Fortunately I also got a side of falafel and the coriander sauce that came with it livened up the moussaka. The burger was helped when I liberally added salt and pepper. Another irritation was that we ate our meal in four stages. Falafil showed up first. We finished that, and the moussaka arrived. My husband tried to eat slowly while we waited for my burger, but that took 20 minutes and came with salad instead of the fries I'd ordered. The waiter said he'd be back with an order of fries, but those didn't arrive for another 15 minutes. Really, how long does it take to make an order of fries? They were good, though, and we dragged them through the garlic sauce that had come on the plate with my burger. Great combo, although we are still smelling like garlic this morning.Here's my takeaway: I will come here again, but I'll get it to go. I just don't think this place can pull it together to put two entrees on the table at the same time. And order carefully. Their falafel is the best in town, and the hummus and baba ganoush are delicious."], ["Scott N.", "Pleasant place with good food. Lots of items on the menu should please everyone. A handful of tables outside are a nice place to sit in warm weather. Order at the counter and your food is brought to you.

I got the yellow curry. It was spicier than expected and the lamb kabob was very tough. Still good tho.I was a little put off by the noise level. We also waited quite a while for our food. Lastly, our dishes were not cleared- a waitress came by three times (bring our main dishes, ask how it was, ask if we wanted anything else). Yet she did not take our pile of completely empty dishes. I must have missed something.I will be back! Gluten free options are always appreciated!!!"], ["David B.", "Wow, that's some top notch Mediterranean food. All served in a casual, laid back coffee shop atmosphere.I got the chicken Shawarma gyro and tried the lamb gyro. Both were amazing, but I'd give the edge to the lamb. Where this gyro really stands out is the delicious, thin, lightly crispy yet still soft pita bread it's all wrapped in. The hummus had similarly delicious pita chips. Unique and very incredible. The meat being cooked to perfection doesn't hurt either.Also got a cup of Turkish tea that was very tasty. And beware, one slice of the strawberry lemon cake was so big it resembled the roof of a house. Unbelievably \u00a0good cake though.

The chicken in the shawarma was unreal in how savory it was, completely unlike the bland grilled chicken many places serve; never had it be tough as some report. The lavash (I thought it was Lebanese, but I guess it's Armenian, it's a flavorful, soft flatbread) is a really nice change from pita, which is often dry. Plenty of garlic. Vegetables are fresh.Service is quick, but it's a) counter ordering (although they bring the food to your table), and b) noisy. I think they bring in extra noise from other nearby restaurants (really, I think it's just that the place is pretty densely packed). Of course, the crowd shows how popular this place is, and the food is the clear reason why. Only Middle Eastern breakfast I know of in the Cities."], ["Nos N.", "Get in, line up, order at the counter, take a number, find a table, go get ur own silver wear, napkins, and water, they bring the food, and enjoy!Seating arrangement was not ideal, we ended up sitting right by the bathroom, wish we didn't. But it was either that or right in front of the front door. Menu was on the side wall, a bit dark to see. No beer or wine. Food came out in a reasonable amount of time. The falafel with tahini sauce was very good! Will definitely order that again. The lamb shish kabob was ok, the rice was good, the lamb was slightly dry. The gyro pita sandwich has plenty of tasty gyro inside, but the pit was all soggy from the sauce.

Kraft Italian or something similar). \u00a0It sure tasted that way, too. \u00a0A few minutes after my salad arrived, both our plates of food arrived, so I asked the server to put my platter down on the open table next to us. \u00a0I also asked the server whether the salad dressing was made \"in-house\". \u00a0He assured me that it was. \u00a0I believe he either lied or is misinformed.Although cooled-off, the two falafel balls were good - crunchy on the outside and tasty. \u00a0The somewhat small smears on the plate of babaghanoush and hummus were both heavily doused with paprika and cumin powder and bathed in olive oil and both were tasty. \u00a0Too bad the flat bread was fairly dried out. \u00a0I really enjoyed the tabbouli - it's not as lemony-tart as the preparations at Zakia Deli and Emily's.The great blob of tzatziki covering the salad of romaine, tomatoes and cucumbers, was rather flavorless. \u00a0It, too, seemed to be some commercial preparation: \u00a0sort-of 'slimy-thick' and lacking in garlic-cucumber flavor.Also on the plate were a nice-size chunk of feta cheese and just 2 Kalamata olives. \u00a0Yes, two.His first time here, my companion was satisfied with the lamb kebabs, but not with the rice or the grilled vegetables. \u00a0Although yellow with saffron, and perfectly cooked, the rice was absent any cardamom flavor (as described on their menu). \u00a0The grilled summer squashes & red pepper were heavily doused with cumin and, aside from the cumin, lacked any pleasant grilled-vegetable flavor.Oh, Leo...

My only gripe is that unlike most Greek/Mediterranean restaurants, entrees don't come with rice and a little salad.

Thin and crispy, they came with a delicious feta cheese spread that paired quite well. With the starch from the fries I decided to leave the pita uneaten, just enjoying my meat by the forkful.

This set up works in small cafes as it's easy to bus you own dishes and usually it's clearly marked where to do so. Also the ordering system was dumb. Order at the counter and no waiter service whatsoever? In a place this size? Plus the menu is set up as such so you're looking over other people to order and feel rushed in doing so. Plus no booze. Considering the craft beer market in the Twin Cities that's surprising and disappointing. For cafes meant for breakfast and not dinner that's cool. A place with a full dinner menu? Not so much.

We four all enjoyed our meals (except the fries) and would recommend this place highly."], ["Sue P.", "I don't know about anyone else but I love, love, love this place! \u00a0I finally had a chance to try it after hearing great things from others how good the food is here. \u00a0So happy I finally had the opportunity because this is hands down my new fave. \u00a0I love it so much and they have such a wonderful wide variety of things to eat that I could literally eat here EVERY DAY. \u00a0In fact, I might just try doing just that because I cannot get enough of it! \u00a0It reminds me so much of some of the great Middle Eastern/ Mediterranean places that I ate at in the California Bay Area. \u00a0Makes me very nostalgic and miss it. :(But now I'm so happy because I have Shish! \u00a0Oh, and I forgot to mention that it looks like they have amazing, beautiful desserts. \u00a0BONUS!"], ["Tara W.", "A gyro & red tea is the perfect lunch. Very sweet staff, excellent atmosphere. Top notch desserts."], ["John M.", "A little pricey for Mediterranean food however it was really good. Tasted really fresh good quality ingredients. I love falafel and some places make it too greasy however there's was really good I would def go back. Only one thing threw me off I wasn't expecting the place to be run by hipsters it was a funny sight. Not your usual Mediterranean joint."], ["Michael C.", "Shish is a relatively new discovery for me and my wife. \u00a0We've lived here for over 5 years and after trying it, couldn't believe that we'd never been to this place before. \u00a0On multiple trips here, I have had the breakfast from Jerusalem (a unique twist on breakfast that has plenty of stuff you're familiar with but may not have had for breakfast), the lamb kabob (perhaps the best I've had in TC), gyro (above average), and their falafel (also above average). \u00a0On top of these items, the hummus is excellent. \u00a0My wife gets some to take home with us whenever we've come here."], ["Ranjit M.", "This is a great Cafe. I love getting the turkish coffee or the pastries they have. They should get better WIFI! A lot of working professionals are a target customer base, and having a good wifi connection is the first thing you have to establish to appeal to this base. I got a staggeringly low .22 Mbps connection here. Not to take away from everything else that's great, I think they have to compete if they are next to french meadow and many other coffee shops on Grand Ave. I will probably not come here to work again."], ["Carolyn A.", "So, I'll admit it -- I'm a middle Eastern food snob. Like real deal snobbity snob. So even with my super high expectations, Shish went and surpassed them like crazy.We went for brunch, which was totally awesome. \u00a0It was hard to make a selection to order because it all looked great. Their menu had both classic American (think pancakes, crabcake benedicts, waffles and oatmeal) and classic middle Eastern options. I had the foul medammas - a beautiful platter of a fava bean/garbanzo bean stew, pita, veggies, olives and falafel. All were absolutely fantastic and it was a great value at $6.95. My husband got the Breakfast from Jerusalem (also delish - ground beef on top of hummus with pita, falafel, veggies, etc.), so I got to taste the hummus. It was so good that i bought a takeout container to bring home with us. As we devoured our food, we spent most of the time scouring the rest of the menu, planning what we would order if we came back for lunch or dinner. I'm sure we'll be back very soon.***NOTE: this is a great place to take vegetarian and vegans. There are lots of options and the menu is coded for vegan/vegetarian items."], ["Savannah N.", "I moved to St. Paul in 2008 to attend college and discovered Shish within a month of my arrival, and I have been religiously going for their impeccable food ever since. As far as authentic Mediterranean and Greek food this is as good as it gets in the St. Paul area. I am a frequent buyer of the hummus and gyro platter as you get a HUGE serving of meat, hummus, lettuce/cucumbers/tomatoes/onions and cucumber sauce with pita bread all for under ten dollars. SERIOUSLY-you can't beat that deal, and oh LORD is it good! I've also had many other things on their menu--curry...AMAZING!!!!!!! Their burgers are delicious too! The other positive is all their vegetarian options! I have two vegetarian roomates//besties and we go here together A LOT because they have a bunch of different options for our non-meat-eating friends. Also I feel it's very important to note their cakes that are displayed in the window. OH MY LANTA people.... GET THE RED VELVET OR THE CARROT CAKE.....TRUST ME IT'S WORTH IT!!! Now I have become so obsessed with these cakes that I actually know they are from buttercream (a cake making company based out of st paul that makes wedding cakes and all those delicious things). I have stalked out these cakes so much that I have ordered them directly from buttercream for my birthday and what not.. .seriously that good. But if you don't want to be a total fatty hop on over to Shish and just get a slice of the cake.. You will NOT regret it!SHISH I LOVE YOU!Oh side note--if you are in need of a true caffeine fix try their turkish coffee... that stuff will seriously crack you out for hours...."]]}
