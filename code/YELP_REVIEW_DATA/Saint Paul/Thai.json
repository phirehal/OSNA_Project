I love the cream cheese wontons- thin and crispy- even though it's not authentic Thai food, they're amazing! Their pad Thai isn't the best I've had but the sauces in their stir fry entrees are BOMB! Good vegetarian options. I like the extra time they take to make flowers out of the carrots. Think about that, it's all about the details! Anyway, go before dinner rush or expect to have a leisurely dinner.

My favorite is #3. \u00a0Their special egg rolls. \u00a0The wrapper is fried and crispy yet still chewy. \u00a0I think they use rice paper which is not common for an egg roll. \u00a0The seasoning and pork is not comparable to anywhere. They have/had other locations. \u00a0The one in Fridley stayed the closest to the original recipes. The one in Apple Valley closed and was reopened by the employees of the taste of Thailand in white bear lake. \u00a0They have the original recipes and always make the food the way it is supposed to be. \u00a0The new Taste of Thaiyai is my favorite in Apple Valley. The location in downtown MPLS seriously has to serve portion sizes that are half the size and cost $1-2 more dollars. \u00a0It's outrageous. So back to the review for the Selby location. The food is always hit or miss. \u00a0It's always a different cook with different ideas on how to make the food. They also mess up often with the take out orders. \u00a0I stopped going there because at first they would be off 2 out of 10 times and it turned into 8 out of 10 times.

It was kind of a weird gray color, but the taste was alright and there was plenty of chicken. The sriracha fried rice was the best of the dishes. It had a great spice level, tons of large pieces of chicken compared with most fried rice, and it was a very large serving. We had a lot of leftovers. I don't typically like fried rice, so it was surprising to me that I liked it so much.

So perhaps the yearly influx of new students keeps them in business. First the food: Not awful. just bland and average.

I ordered the trusty Pad Thai dish for myself and made sure the lady understood I wanted my dish \"very hot, very very hot, SUPER spicy\" I told her.

If you're willing to speak up, there's no issue. Also, the Pad Thai could stand to be better. It is very sticky, and tends to come in a single ball of noodles.

I'd rate this in the top 10 of all Pad Thai that I've had. It was spicy, savory, crunchy, fresh and not overly salty... all the things you hope for when ordering up the dish.Pineapple Fried Rice with Pork - Above average. Good taste, large portion size, but slightly overcooked so the texture was a bit mushy.Pad Preow Waan with Tofu - Good. Fresh and full of veggies, this is a good filler without being heavy. Sauce was sweet and tofu crispy.Pad Pak with Chicken - Good. Savory broth with stir fried veggies. Chicken was perfectly cooked.Laab Gai - Above average. Fresh and flavorful, but the sauce was a bit on the salty side. Soup was standard broth + veg.I recommend checking this place out. I'm not sure if it is a family run operation but it had that feel.

An order of cream cheese puffs is something we have to order at every oriental restaurant we try. I thought theirs was really good -- they were small, crunchy, and had a perfect amount of cream cheese for their size. We also ordered the Chick Satay to start with. The chicken is served up on a skewer and cooked perfectly! Great crunch on the edges and wonderful flavor. It came with a delicious peanut peanut sauce to dip the chicken in (I'm a sucker for peanut sauce). The Pad Thai was good.

The laab is okay, and so is the curry puff pastry. The papaya salad needs more shrimp paste, and the pad see ew is mediocre. The spicy wings is also decent.

My husband got #48, \u00a0it had cashews in it, and was very good. My only beef is they don't give you enough rice for your entree and you have to pay a buck more for extra which is necessary, it's spicy, even if ordered mild. I have a feeling this is true for most of the entrees. They have a lunch buffet that I remember fondly, though some items are spicy. On it they had fried veggies and once it was fried corn. Being from the northeast equals corn fritters. If only I had some maple syrup with me. I ordered something more interesting for the sake of the review, but they do have the best pad thai, that I'm getting next time. The fried rice is excellent, it has a sweet under taste.

Their spice levels are on the \"Thai scale level\" so medium is very spicy. I usually go with mild-medium which is plenty for me and I am a lover of spicy food. I've tried tom yum soup at multiple Thai restaurants before and find that they vary greatly. Some have a creamier base, some have stronger herb flavors.

It includes mushrooms, various herbs, and your choice of meat (or tofu).Another favorite of mine is the pad see ew noodles. It's a very flavorful noodle dish that comes with thick noodles stir fried with Chinese broccoli, eggs, and your choice of meat (or tofu).

You can't go wrong with this dish.I've also had a few of their salads which were very authentic and delicious.

Sometimes, you'll never get your water refilled after your first cup. I've came here a few times early, being one of their first customers in, but it still takes 20-30+ minutes to receive food. Don't expect it to be quick trip! If you're extremely hungry, portions are also smaller compared to other restaurants. You can get extra noodles for any noodle dish at an extra cost.

Chicken noodle soup will do nothing for my colds, now.A creamy yet translucent broth sprinkled with pepper flakes is the medium for the potatoes, meat (I got tofu, I'm sure anything else would be phenomenal), onions and, apparently, pineapple, although I did not find any pineapple in mine. No matter, it was delicious. Served with a small side of rice, I spooned some of the broth over rice and ate my tofu with it. Eventually I ditched the rice and went straight for the good stuff. Either way, this is a must have. *Beef Pad Thai. Ordered Medium. Spicy! Exciting! A perfect blend of noodle and sauce. Do not be afraid of the tragedy to befall many Twin Cities Thai restaurants. These noodles did not clump together and weigh you down with starch and sauce. Plate presentation was beautiful, too. A filling dish for sure, but not so much you can't walk when you're done. Medium was spicy. See above. A must-try. *Cream Cheese Wontons.Not Thai. Probably related to the \"Chinese\" fortune cookie. Either way, house-made and definitely delicious.

The sauce that accompanied the egg rolls had better thickness, flavor and shine than the sauce you'll see at every other Asian restaurant. \u00a0The spicy noodles, featuring On's own spicy sauce, were tangy and sweet with a peppery afterburn. \u00a0The ratio of sauce-to-noodles was off for my taste. When I was done eating, there was still a 1/4\" of sauce remaining. \u00a0It could have flavored an entire, additional plate of noodles. Overall, I'd describe the food we ate at On's as 'saucy-er' and 'tangy-er' than the food you'll have at other Asian restaurants.

The whole experience was pretty unremarkable.The next time, my bf and I were craving some green curry and decided to go to On's since we were in the neighborhood. We walked in around 2 pm on a Saturday to a pretty empty restaurant. We were seated right away and immediately knew what we wanted but our waiter didn't come to take our order for about 25 minutes. We eventually got our green curries, which was decent tasting, but nothing special. Our waiter never came to check up on our table while we were eating. Then, once we were very clearly finished eating, our waiter never came to give us our bill. We were finally able to flag him down about 30 minutes after we were done. I don't like to change my ratings for places based on service unless it is exceptionally good or bad. And in this case, it was BAD. We felt completely ignored the entire time we were there. There was another server working there at the same time who seemed to be much better. She seemed efficient and friendly. Maybe our experience would have been different if she were our server.

When you asked them to make your food spicy, it actually comes out spicy. I would say spicier than the spice levels at Amazing Thailand.2. I had the peanut sauce entree that is mentioned in many Yelper's review, but this was too sweet for my taste. I probably wouldn't get this again personally.3. The Tod Man appetizer is like a Thai version of fish cakes - will order again.4. The Tom Kha soup was very, very good. It's a coconut cream based mushroom and cilantro soup with lemongrass, and you get a choice of meat.

You will have to park in the parking lot on Sherburne and jump down to the alley. Yes, jump, like Micheal Jordan jumps when he dunks a basketball. JUMP!, like how Kriss Kross will make you....Good luck getting back up there if you don't have a nice vertical.2) The waiter wasn't Asian (always a bad sign for a supposedly hole in the wall Asian restaurant).3) I didn't see any Asians eating in there. If Asians don't think the food is good, it's probably not good. Also, a good majority of the reviews were by non-Asians. (I'm not prejudice. I have many non-Asian friends.)4) It took the waiter forever to give me the menus and water. It didn't even look busy. There were plenty of tables open. Took forever to come take my order too. I had to go hunt him down.Now on to the food. The food was actually pretty decent. The 2 star review is mainly for the service. I guess since not many Asians eat there, they had to garnish it up to make it look pretty. I don't care about the extra cucumber and lime slices to make my fried rice look fancy. The rations are also a little smaller than other Thai places on University. The prices were also competitive with the other options on University as well.The service was very slow. It took about 15-20 minutes for them to take my order. I put my order in. It was a simple order. Eggrolls, Pad Thai, and fried rice. It took over 30 minutes to get my food. When I was done, I needed a box and needed to pay. No waiter in sight. I had to go hunt him down again, but ran into the bus boy and he gave me a box. Finally after 5 more minutes, the waiter finally came by and I was able to pay.After I was done, I looked at the time. It had been almost 1 hr and 30 minutes since I sat down. If you like to wait, this is the place for you.Would I recommend? No. I'm all about the service. I can get egg rolls down the road with better service. The ambiance isn't too pleasing either. They reused the old tables from the previous restaurant, which was Bon Xai. The ceiling was sprayed black to cover up any imperfections and the walls painted Halloween orange.

It is some of the best Thai food I have had in a long time. \u00a0 Regretfully the place was not super busy other than several people picking up take out. \u00a0 \u00a0Reasonable prices, easy access, worth checking out and even taking a drive to do so. \u00a0I will be back again for sure."], ["Heidi O.", "I vote yes to this place. \u00a0Went for lunch today with a friend. \u00a0We shared an order of the crab soft rolls, which were fresh and delicious -- then each order the combo lunch special. \u00a0I couldn't decide between the pad thai and the panang curry - so ordered the combo with some of each. \u00a0The pad thai wasn't my favorite one I've ever had, but was still tasty. \u00a0However, the panang curry was magical. \u00a0And the lunch prices are tough to beat. \u00a0The regular lunch special was -- I think -- about $5.49, and the combo was something like $6.79. \u00a0Pretty hard to beat for such a delicious lunch!The gentleman who served us was also great - very friendly and helpful!"], ["Laura F.", "LOVE this place! \u00a0We eat here all the time and always have a wonderful experience.

I want to start off by saying how friendly and personable the owner and his son are. They know how to make you feel welcome. The interior is typical to a lot of NE restaurants: not much to look at, but you can bet the food will be great. And it was. My boss and I both ordered from the lunch specials menu - enough food for a great price. I got the broccoli beef with rice. A little heavy on the ginger, but otherwise very fresh and delicious. Not greasy and fatty like a lot of take-out place. My boss ordered the spicy version, and it was amazing! I'll be getting that next time (it was a little too spicy for his tastes). They serve beer, including a variety of Asian imports which I'm down to try sometime. Go eat lunch here sometime. It's very laid back and the food was very fresh!"], ["Caitlin S.", "I went to the Royal Orchid for dinner with my dad, sister and grandma.

Our entrees were amazing, we each got something different and thoroughly enjoyed everything. My grandma finished her entire pad thai -- totally unexpected! My sister got the Peanut Sauce Stir-Fry with Chicken. Super yummy, peanut-y and mild with lots of flavor. My dad got the Curry Sauce Noodles - glorious. I'm getting this next time. It came in a massive bowl which I thought would last him about 3 meals. He did too until he polished it off. I got the Green \"Sweet\" Curry - IT IS NOT SWEET!! It is delicious and has tons of flavor but, like most green curries, it is SPICY!! \u00a0They do say this on the menu and I knew to expect spice so I was completely fine with it but I did get made fun of a bit - I looked like I was suffering through dinner. Totally worth it though. The owner was really nice, friendly and offered us samples of caramel rolls before we ordered. Apparently they take 3 days to make! He clearly cares about his customers and made it an enjoyable experience for everyone.I'll definitely be returning to Royal Orchid - I didn't realize until we got there that it is the same Royal Orchid that had been in Roseville near Babies'R'Us. I'm glad we've found them again!

The curry is always a perfect balance of coconut and spice. The thai tea will keep me coming back for years. My husband's favorite is the Thai Curry Noodles which he so affectionately calls 'the best thing ever'.The place is not fancy nor ever packed, however, you will always see a steady stream of people getting take out because THEY KNOW.

He literally told me Punch Pizza was \"too exotic.\"By some small miracle, I managed to drag him into Karta and told him to get the chicken pad Thai (typically a safe bet for a timid first-timer).

He thought they were fantastic.Yelpers, that simply doesn't happen with my father.Our entrees came and I was thoroughly pleased with my green seafood curry. The real treat was that my dad also liked his meal. I almost video taped him saying \"it's pretty good!\" to send to my brother because I was so astonished that he wasn't pushing it aside and saying he would grab just Subway afterwards.SERIOUS props, Karta Thai.

And then there's the rest of the menu ... I've already rambled too much here so I'll only mention a few of my favorites: Crunchy, cilantro-spiked fresh spring rolls. Or the crispy, tightly wrapped golden treasures that are their fried egg rolls. Another must-have: the Shrimp Pad Thai. Think plump treasures of the sea nestled in a bed of perfectly al dente noodles -- slippery with garlic, tamarind-and citrus-accented fish sauce. Nom nom nommmmm. P.S.

It wasn't my favorite place, but I wanted to break away from my beloved Karta Thai just for a change. It's super close to us, in Roseville, which added to the allure of the place. Don't expect ambience or a posh eating environment. But do expect hot, delicious Thai food. We came for dinner on a week night. The place was busy (mostly with takeout orders on the phone and people waiting in the lobby) and the servers were very rushed and visibly stressed out. I totally understand so I didn't want to be impatient. It took us 30 minutes to get our water and our Thai iced teas. Another 25 minutes to get our appetizers and then our food shortly thereafter.My Green Curry with shrimp was delicious, and quite spicy. I ordered Medium spice and I ended up sweating at the table. My sister got their Shrimp Pad Thai which was also very good, and not as sweet as Karta's. I didn't care for the rice, my batch was hard and kind of burnt on one side. Our appetizers were great though! Cream Cheese puffs and Chicken Satay with peanut sauce. The Chicken Satay was out of this world. Usually they can be a bit dry and small, but these were large, thick and juicy! Well done on the Satays! A generous portion for a good price.Overall, I think this place would be better for takeout after work or for a quick lunch if you work in the area. I have mixed feelings.

Authentic without being too spicy (unless you like it that way) - tofu done absolutely perfectly crispy and chewy; the entire dish is perfectly balanced.

The pad thai was slightly sweet and was actually hot when I asked for \"hot.\" \u00a0Also, my \"bad pad thai\" scale has been reset recently by the place where it was apparently made with Miracle Whip. \u00a0This at least seemed kinda sorta like pad thai. \u00a0I do find that what I think of as \"real Thai\" restaurants offer a little selection of condiments (peppers treated in various ways and so forth) for the diner to apply as necessary. \u00a0There was nothing like that here. \u00a0The only table amenity that I really appreciated was that they posted their wi-fi password on the wall.Next time I'll try the green curry (note: at least they HAD green curry). \u00a0My overall description when we got back to the office was \"it's better Thai food than anyplace closer.\" \u00a0 They are definitely not as good as Taste of Thailand in Fridley, however."], ["Jeannie C.", "Got the egg rolls, Tom Kha soup, and red curry.

When my friend and I first arrived, there was only one other pair of diners in the restaurant so we were a little hesitant but still decided to follow through with trying this place out.

They put slices of oranges in their water...which is actually very refreshing and my new preferred citrus of choice! We ordered the vegetable wonton soup, vegetable pad thai, thai chicken wings, pork thai basil fried rice, and thai iced tea. First impressions of the food? Delicious! For what seems to be a very random restaurant in a ridiculously deserted strip mall/business area, this place serves shockingly fresh and authentic thai food. Here's a short rundown of the items we ordered:Vegetable wonton soup - pretty basic soup base but balanced nicely with the flavor explosion from the other items. Vegetable pad thai - perfect combination of sweet and salty, I think I would order it spicier next time. Pork Thai Basil fried rice - a great texture to the rice, the rice was chewy and the grains were separated, not over cooked and stuck together aka I loved it.Chicken wings - very flavorful with a sweet chili sauce, I would recommend ordering the sauce on the side, it's super sticky. Thai iced tea - not overly sweet or overly bitter, a really great combination of the tea and condensed milk poured over ice. Overall, the dining experience was great, service was fast, and parking was ample...which makes for pleasant meal. Can't wait til this gem is discovered and starts to thrive."], ["Maren L.", "Ordered the Pad Thai, beef lettuce wrap and spicy chicken wings. \u00a0The pad Thai was.. Eh... Nothing special.

The green curry had this amazing sweet, creamy start and spicy finish at the end of every bite. I tried to savor each bite of the pad thai but it was gone before I knew it.

The cake was one of the most delicious spongy/moist/jelly cakes I had ever had and didn't have an overwhelming coconut flavor either! I'll definitely be back for this exact meal.

I just wish the food was better.The Pad Thai is 'wet.' \u00a0It has a bland, watery sauce that drips off the noodles and pools on the plate instead of clinging to the noodles. To me, this is a serious mistake for any Thai restaurant to make. \u00a0Sauces need to be think enough to cling to noodles and hold their flavors. In the best scenario, noodles are also \u00a0tossed with their sauce in a pan over fire, long enough to create random, saucy sear marks of flavor. \u00a0The other serious mistake at Sawatdee is their level of spice (aka 'heat'). \u00a0Their scale seems off because the 'medium' Pad Thai I ordered was bland and flavorless.I could see the peppers that they had added, but they didn't cling to the noodles. Maybe that was the problem? \u00a0Alternatively, it might be that they brought me someone else's Pad Thai by mistake. \u00a0I ordered Pork Pad Thai and they brought me shrimp. \u00a0Appetizers are good here.

This of course brings up the all-important question we must ask of all Thai restaurants in the Twin Cities: will the dishes be spicy... or just \"Minnesota spicy\"? Well I'm here to tell you that the spice is... not real. Sadly even if you decide to go down the 5 pepper route, the spice level of your dish will not be authentic. But that's okay.

More than one waiter saw me (and another couple that walked in at the same time as I did), yet they did not acknowledge us standing there- they even had the audacity to ask customers if they wanted refills before acknowledging us! Eventually, the couple that came in at the same time as I did left because they were so fed up with waiting. I wished I could have left too, but I already had pre-paid for my meal with the online takeout order, so I felt stuck. Finally I went up to a waiter and asked if I could pick up my takeout order. I gave him my name, and after a check in the kitchen he said \"no we don't have a takeout order for you. We havent been answering our phones.\" By this point, I had smoke coming out of my ears. He didn't apologize, didn't act like he cared whatsoever!! (short, little white guy with dark curly hair) -- I showed him the confirmation email on my phone, and he lackadaisically took my order so the kitchen could make it for me. Again, no apologies at all. While waiting for my order to finally be made, I watched a few other couples walk out after standing around for unacceptable amounts of time and not being acknowledged/seated. Horrible, truly horrible customer service!It's unfortunate that the food was actually pretty tasty, because I will never step foot in that restaurant again after that that experience. Thankfully, since I ordered through Menufy.com, I contacted the Menufy customer service and received a full refund for my order, so Sawatdee lost the $44 for my meal, plus the money from the multiple couples that walked out of the restaurant after not receiving any service while I was there (and I'm sure MANY other lost customers because of their bad service).(by the way, there was a tall white male that was filling up his own beer behind the bar, sitting around texting on his cell phone and walking around and talking to employees in a manner that made me think he was a manager of some sort.... regardless of his position, it is ridiculous for someone that is not on staff to let themselves behind the bar and pour themself a drink and drink it right in front of customers that are standing there waiting to be seated/served!!!!!! The employees, managers and owners should absolutely be ashamed of themselves for treating customers the way that they do."]], "King Thai Restaurant": [["Mae M.", "I came here the second week the restaurant opened up so the server was still very new.

Eggrolls Hmong version a lot of noodles little meat, spring ok nothing fancy. Dad ordered chicken and catfish laab. Mom got phoking, and I got fried chicken combo. The catfish was interesting different for sure, but not the best. Chicken as good but \u00a0hot as shit . The pho was any ordinary pho but leans more to Vietnamese pho. The fried chicken thigh was actually good with salad and asparagus. The Thai coffe was good, but like I said no refils. The pricing is a itty bit overpriced but it was ok.

I will admit that sometimes I even cross the river from Minneapolis to get it (What a sin, I know!). I have had a couple things from there and never been disappointed. I've eaten in and dined out. Portion size is large and you'll have leftovers - unless of course you're in it for the long haul then prepare to leave with a VERY full belly. Dishes I've had/tried:-Pineapple Red Curry with Seafood/Shrimp: I ordered the shrimp and tofu version for just myself the last time I was there. Large tail on shrimp and a decent amount of them. My one very small gripe would be that my tofu was a little overdone so it was tougher than usual and sometimes the curry can seem greasy but it's sooooo good you won't even notice once it hits the rice.The Seafood version includes more than just shrimp with calamari/octopus and other protein pieces that I wasn't sure of, but still very tasty nonetheless. Perhaps just a little more adventurous so keep that in mind.-Pineapple fried rice: also delicious and pretty self explanatory. Huge portion.-Spring rolls: Oh yummy. And the dipping sauce? Yes please. Give me extra. -Fried Tofu - simple and done well. - Pad thai with tofu and extra veggie: upcharge for the extra veggies but it was good pad thai and huge portion. Probably could've kicked it up a notch on the spice scale when I said \"mild/medium\". Next time I would go just medium or medium hot. But do so at your own risk. I like spice. Definitely leftovers here too. And the best part for me is it wasn't super greasy as can happen at other places. Overall, I can't wait to go back and try their Panang Curry or the Pad Kee Mao. It's just a small joint in an old Burger King on the LRT construction zone near the Capitol that could use your patronage. Eat up, friends. You won't be disappointed."], ["K Y.", "I've never been more disgusted with Thai food in my life. After the spring rolls were served, I was already afraid of the other items I've ordered.

Right after the appetizers were served, random food was placed at the far side of my family' table. When we finally noticed the food was ours - we moved the dishes to our own table... When we proceeded to dine - despite the rudeness of the servers - I found the food to be very old. Myself and my kids couldn't chew the pork belly because it was extremely DRY! Almost as if it had been cooked the night before or the morning of and then reheated!(I frequently cook Thai food in my own kitchen) The grilled beef salad was NOT grilled and the beef had a slight flavor of an unclean and over greased pan! A $15 shrimp, tofu and ground pork dish came with over and pound of tofu, the ground pork was barely noticeable and it ONLY had 5 shrimps covered in an oily brown sauce!

Ordered spicy, dressed with fish sauce and sugar (very important) at the table. It was some of the best fried noodle I've ever had. Next order was same but take-out, ordered mild or medium. Was out of fish sauce at home, no dressing, was still pretty good. Every time Heat level was spot-on (although I always ask to Thai-med, or Thai-hot, not Minnesota-tames heat)Two nights ago Pops and I went for dine-in. Ordered the Sour Pork Ribs app, Pad Se Ew (pork), and Green curry (chicken). The curry was fantastic, SO much better than my homemade. We dressed the Pad with fish sauce, sugar, and dried pepper and it was better than ever. Great main dishes totally worth the trip.The real show stopper were the ribs. I've never had anything like them. At Dad's prodding the owner/chef came out to tell us how they were made, with her daughter helping with translation. They're bite-sized pork rib nib-lets served with cloves of garlic, chili peppers, and kafir lime leaves, all beautifully fried and served hot. The ribs are beautifully yet indescribably sour. Turns out that they are actually fermented with cooked rice. According to the Chef, the longer they ferment, the better they get. I'm pretty sure Thai Cafe on University is the only place in the cities where you can get these. They were fantastic! Not something I'd eat everyday but a great taste experiment. Both Dad and I were in a rush to get home to look up how to make Thai Sour Ribs. After reading the recipe I'm more than happy to go buy them from a trained chef rather than trying them myself. Fermented Pork, Wow!OK, travel details, Thai Cafe is about four doors east of Western on University. There is lots of Light Rail construction in the area but all the more reason to get them your business. It's easy to get there from the north, avoiding all the construction. head down Western until just before University, park on the street or in the lot behind. Walk less than half a block east of Uni & Western, and you are there.The place is small and cozy. Quite utilitarian, but with beautiful art tucked in between full color photos of their dishes. The photos help make it easy to order. This is a family operation. I'm sure if it got busy service could be hit or miss. Dad and I had great service overall but we got our meal piecemeal with the app served last. Not a deal killer for a couple flavor junkies like Dad and I. Frankly I'd rather be served food when the chef is happy to send it out rather than some sort of arbitrary order. The whole menu is also available for take out. Prices are great given the quality."], ["Courtney I.", "I love a place that takes a white girl seriously when she says she wants the food \"hot.\" I ordered the massamam curry, and it was so delicious. My fiancee ordered the Pad Kee Mao and loved it. We would go back in a heartbeat."], ["Teebs C.", "Delicious home made Thai food. This is a hole in the wall family business. Mom is in the back cooking the meals which are made to order. I had pineapple fried rice with chicken. As far as fried rice goes this tasted extremely fresh. Usually when you get fried rice the egg can come out a bit chewy but this was perfectly cooked. It could have used more chicken but honestly that is probably my only minor complaint about this place. Husband had duck laab which is basically a meat salad with some rice on the side. He loved it. Thought it was fantastic. We stopped by for a quick bite on our way cross country and were not disappointed. If you live in the area and are looking for a home cooked Thai meal definitely check this place out!"], ["Prudence T.", "Red curry is a great choice if you want veggies! \u00a0This place is fabulous. \u00a0Everything on the menu is great. \u00a0Tuesdays = free egg rolls! :-)"], ["Lindsey D.", "This place is freaking good. Just do it. Pad Thai was sooo good. Just moved here and all the Thai we've tried sucks, until Thai Cafe. Amaazzing egg rolls. We are picky and snobby about food and loved this little place. Check out the crazy Asian grocery store next door while you wait."], ["Jules E.", "After reading the many positive reviews, my wife and I decided to give the Thai Cafe a try, even though we've been quite happy with our regular Thai place: Sawatdee. We saw that they did not serve alcohol, so we bought our own bottle of wine. We tried a couple of our favorites: Pad Kee Mao, and the Panang Curry. Both were delivered quickly, and with fresh authentic flavors. The table had assorted condiments and spices to allow you to tune your dish to the desired level of heat, which came in handy because on our first visit to a restaurant we tend to play it a little \"safe\", especially since many Thai restaurants have a wide chasm between \"medium\" and \"hot\".The Thai Cafe's atmosphere is simple and unadorned, the service is friendly, the prices are very reasonable, and most importantly, the food is delicious. We will be back many times.As a side note, the construction on University Ave is making it tough for so many small businesses, so please, please, please, keep supporting the wonderful little gems like the Thai Cafe so we can continue to enjoy them for years to come."], ["Kyra M.", "I second Kris B's accolades for this tiny little restaurant. Service is super friendly. The food was very fresh & high quality. The curry was wonderful. The beef in my pad thai was tender. Prices are good. I think our entrees were around $7.50 each. There are bags of their dessert specialty lined up on the counter - a fun, crunchy, light, crispy pastry made from tapioca flour. It isn't \"sweet\" but it tastes sweet after eating the spicy Thai!"]], "Thai Ginger Restaurant": [], "Royal Bangkok": [["Heather W.", "Royal Bangkok is AMAZING! My husband and I decided to stop for lunch on his day off and we couldn't have found a better place for authentic cuisine. The owners were a delight and ensured every aspect of our first dining experience there was exceptional! For only $4.99 you get 5 choices to choose from and was more than enough! This place is a hidden gem and can't wait to go back!"], ["Kyra M.", "The lunch special is like walking into another dimension. 4 bucks! Only 4 bucks for lots of good food. Been here a couple times for the lunch, and both times the service was incredibly friendly.You get 5 choices for lunch. It's a lot of food. I like the chicken that's been slow-cooked so it is falling off the bone. You have to add spices to it, but they have all sorts of spicy condiments to add. I also like their curry.This place is kind of hard to find. The door is nondescript. There is no sign that says, \"This door right here to $4 lunch no kidding.\" Don't be afraid, just try the door. There is a seamstress shop just inside the door to the right with fancy Asian dresses in the window. Walk past that into the restaurant."], ["Sonya K.", "Lunch special for $3.99 for 5 samplings from their buffet? Yes, please! I'm surprise they can stay afloat with prices so low, but don't be fooled by the low price - the food is delicious. I like their pork belly fat stir fry and their papaya salad from the lunch special the most. It's absolutely to die for."], ["Thomas B.", "I wanted to like Royal Bangkok, there can never be too many Thai restaurants to choose from. Alas, I left quite disappointed. I met a friend that was visiting from out of town and I chose the location because we had eaten in the same space when it was Bangkok Thai Deli prior to their moving across the street. When I walked in to the space, I thought they were probably closed as there was nothing welcoming about the open, food court feel to the restaurant. It was dark and it was not until I approached the tables that I noticed two tables with diners, my friend sat at one.Shortly after we ordered our meals a construction worker began working on the front counter and was pounding and drilling throughout the time we were there.We started with an order of Fresh Spring Roll (3) Shrimp, BBQ pork, fresh vegetables and vermicelli noodles which were bite size greasy, overcooked and with very little filling. My friend commented that they were probably bought frozen than deep fried and served with a tasteless cucumber dipping sauce. Needless to say I was discouraged. My friend ordered Fried rice with mock duck, \u00a0vegetables and gravy; medium spicy. when it arrived it was served as a stir fry; mock duck and vegetables were sitting on top of a tasteless mound of rice with tiny specks of egg mixed within. What little gravy there was had no taste and nothing about the dish was medium spicy. I ordered SPECIAL PHO COMBO with Imitation crab, shrimp, fish ball, pork & beef, beef tripe and beef meatball. It was hands down the best part of the meal but the broth appeared to have been bouillon based and not very flavorful. I had to ask the waiter for fresh basil as it was not served with the bean sprouts and pepper (one red chili).Based on my meal I would not return. The prices were reasonable, the service was decent and friendly.It will take some convincing for me to go back to Royal Bangkok.....there are too many great choices that I would not waste my time or money going back"], ["Jade M.", "I actually like their food. We ordered a lot and it's not that bad on pricings. Quality and quantity of food was good. Actually they Gave us so much rice we couldn't even finish it (ITS A GOOD THING). I would definitely come back and eat here next time i come back to MN. The service was kind of slow though but it's not like we have to wait 30 for an hr for our food."], ["Sheng T.", "Finally stopped by for dinner. Great service for a small family owned restaurant. Their menu is huge!!! They serve authentic Thai, Lao and Cambodian food. The red curry was delicious. Pad Thai flavor was perfect...but it was quite slimy. Hoi Jor here is my least favorite of all Thai restaurants I've ever had. Fried tilapia in house sauce was delicious! Beef skewers were smoked in lemon grass. This was our favorite appetizer. One small change I would suggest is for a side of peanut sauce for the beef skewers...or some sort of special dipping sauce. It is served with a side of chili oil which I'm not digging. Great to see an extensive menu, but for a small family owned restaurant it makes me question how fresh their food really is. Overall, great service! The chef/mommy dearest herself came out twice to greet and check on our table. Sweet family. I would certainly come back."], ["Valerie S.", "THIS PLACE.So this place gets the incredible rating in my book for several obvious reasons. When this place opened, it seemed like it could be just another Thai place on within a three block stretch of University. I think there are at least five.So what sets Royal Bangkok apart from the rest?1. $3.99 lunch special which includes five (!!) entree samplings. You can get a healthy portion of pad thai, the curry of the day, laab, papaya salad, stir fry all for under $4.00. UNREAL. You can't even get fast food for that. It seems incredibly under priced. Oh yeah, everything on their menu is like this.2.Okay so it's cheap, but is it good? Absolutely. All the entrees are spiced well to fit most anyone's palate and their flavors are so rich and vibrant. You can tell they take great pride in their new establishment.3. Their spring rolls are the best. They give you three instead of the usual two and stuff them with plentiful, fresh ingredients. They also give you the option of ordering five (for like $7.00) which comes out as a mountain of spring rolls. Don't try to eat this alone. 4. Their service is phenomenal and the establishment is always spotless.I haven't tried their bubble tea yet, always too full when I am finished with my meal here."], ["Mer K.", "We just got their delivery through Bite Squad lastnight. Yum! And cheap! Ding, ding, ding! That's a winner. We got spring rolls, eggrolls, laab, beef with basil, fried rice. I tried everything and it was delicious and good quality, nicely presented, non-oily, and not cookie cutter Thai/Chinese. What a find, this is going to become go-to takeout for us."], ["Kalvin V.", "I really love this place! Obliviously great food(pho and kapoun my favorite), big spacious room, has a food market next to it(owned by owners of Bangkok), good service. Also on the weekdays it's not busy so you may be the only one there, this you get treated extra well."], ["Narin V.", "I have tried many Thai restaurants around town, but I have to go back to the Royal Bangkok Restaurant because the food is more real Bangkok style Thai food. I went to the lunch special on the noon time noticing the price is now $4.98 for choosing up to 5 items. To me the price is still good with all the food on my plate. I like to order online with my friends through Bitesquard.com for a home delivery. We enjoy the food and the price, keep it up!!!"], ["Maren O.", "This place is always good. I continue to try something new when I go, and with a menu this long its easy to keep up that practice! The ph\u00f3 is delicious, the curries are rich and full of flavor, their soup comes in hot pots to share, and their larb is exactly how I remember it should be. Their Thai tea and coffee are really great, too, and I've been promise a full assortment of jellies and bubbles for teas in the near future. And the staff are ridiculously helpful and friendly. They never say they're out of something, but you may have to wait while they whip up some more. To top it all off, it's cheaper than eating at McDonalds! Take your family and have a real dinner! I can't wait until the LRT opens and this place gets tons of business - I know I'll take advantage of the transportation. But right now I like the feeling that it's there just for me."], ["Jake B.", "We wanted Thai tonight, but something new. This place has a great diversity of tasty dishes I have never had before. Diverse menu, excellent flavors, nice people, good value...yeah the ambiance isn't much, but otherwise an excellent meal. Definitely want to go back. If it looks closed, or like your at the wrong place, just keep going!"], ["Mat L.", "This is a new restaurant in the old location of Bangkok Thai Deli (which moved across the street into an old Burger King). Bangkok Thai Deli used to be our favorite Thai place in the Cities, but since it moved across the street (and maybe even a little before) we've noticed a real decline in food quality. We decided to try Royal Bangkok instead and were favorably impressed. I don't think it's quite as good as Bangkok Thai Deli was at its height, but it is better than BTD is now. The Pad Thai was a little one note and lacked the freshness and complexity the dish can have when expertly prepared. The green curry, however, featured well cooked, but still crisp vegetables in a non-greasy sauce. The spring rolls were large, but the peanut dipping sauce was a bit weak.Overall, this is a pretty good hole in the wall Thai place, but it doesn't reach the heights of the old Bangkok Thai Deli."], ["D B.", "We would really LOVE to give this place a 5 star because we really want them to do well, but sadly, no. \u00a0First the food, because that is all it is about. \u00a0We have been here on two occasions. \u00a0Visit 1: \u00a0'Grandma' the matriarch was in the kitchen. \u00a0We know because she came over and talked to us after our meal. \u00a0The vegetables seemed very fresh, the was an adequate amount of them, and the flavors were really great. \u00a0My husband was a little more impressed than I was and thought he had finally found a good Thai restaurant in MN ~ he was REALLY (REALLY) excited. \u00a0I was less impressed. \u00a0We did agree that the flavors were good and well blended and were so glad there was no oily ick on everything (as we often experience at other similar restaurants). \u00a0I was disappointed that he Pad See Ew noodles were a bit too crunchy and there weren't very many of them. \u00a0We both thought it was great that they told us next time we come we could byob since they don't have a liquor license.Visit 2. \u00a0The matriarch was NOT in the kitchen. \u00a0We know because we could see from the plastic on our booth that a younger man and woman were in the kitchen 'cooking'. \u00a0The food was horrible. \u00a0We were SO disappointed. \u00a0That oily ick I mention above was the worst we had ever seen it ~anywhere. \u00a0Appetizers - though they were fried, were cold in the middle. \u00a0HUH? \u00a0Gross. Pad See Ew was even CRUNCHIER with even LESS noodles (like 2) this time ~ basically uncooked. \u00a0Curry was an oily unblended mess with hardly any vegetables. \u00a0On the plus side we enjoyed the beer we brought to drink. \u00a0This second visit left a bad taste in our mouth - literally. \u00a0Boo!The atmosphere we can mostly get past if the food is good - it is florescent light/strip mall exciting. However, I was scared to use the restroom there and my husband confirmed I shouldn't after his visit. I wonder how clean the kitchen is that I can't see and the hands washed in the bathroom with ice cold water. \u00a0And they should stop wheeling a cart around the restaurant and dumping in people's food into a sloshy bucket after they leave (bring the food to the cart in the back ~out of sight~ instead).If Grandma wants to retire, this place has a dim future I'm afraid, and that is too bad because you just so want them to succeed. \u00a0Though the people working here are all EXTREMELY nice and conscientious, either Grandma is going to need to keep cooking or they are going to need to hire an experienced cook. Like I said - We SO wanted to love this place and we wish no ill will, but only success for this family. \u00a0Unfortunately we are not sure we can be part of their future and that saddens us."], ["Jackie B.", "Have been here twice now, no real complaints. \u00a0Extremely friendly staff. \u00a0The daily lunch special is insane (5 sample entrees for a mere $3.99). \u00a0Go fast for this deal, I predict they will change the price once word gets out to enough people."], ["Meg D.", "I had dinner there last night (11.12.13). \u00a0I arrived about 7:30 on a Tuesday night, and the place was totally deserted except for the proprietors and two of their daughters. \u00a0I thought I was at the wrong place for a minute, until I saw the tables and chairs in the middle of the space. \u00a0So I sat down and ordered. \u00a0My food arrived quickly and was DELICIOUS! \u00a0I ordered the red curry with pork. \u00a0It was wonderfully flavorful, with the complex blend of flavors I remember from my meals in Thailand. \u00a0Their medium heat was just the right amount for me, and I do like my food a bit on the spicy side. \u00a0It came with a mountain of rice. \u00a0I ate as much as I needed that night (as I'd missed lunch) and still had plenty for another big meal today.I also ordered the salt and pepper calamari appetizer. \u00a0The calamari was lightly breaded and fried, with slices of jalepenos. \u00a0Whilee it wasn't particularly spicy, it was great calamari.While I was eating, I chatted at length with one of the owners. \u00a0We talked about Thailand - I took note of several travel tips - and chatted about our lives and our families. \u00a0When I left, I knew I'd not only found a place with affordable, authentic and delicious Thai food, but I'd made a new friend."]]}
