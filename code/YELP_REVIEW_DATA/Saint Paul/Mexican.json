Guess we'll see how I do this time..First point - this isn't a Mexican place. The folks who run La Palma are primarily Salvadoran, and their menu offerings reflect this fact. Naturally, Salvadoran food does share a great deal in common with Mexican, but they have their own take on a number of dishes - and offer several things you'll just not find in a typical (Tex) Mex or Mexi-Cali eatery. Like what, you ask? Like pupusas, I reply. What's a pupusa? It's a somewhat thick, corn masa pancake that's filled with any number of different meats and/or cheeses, and frequently a combination of several. They are traditionally served with a two-part condiment of mildly picked shredded cabbage (think Central American cole slaw) and a thin, runny tomato sauce. The idea is to use the sauce as a dressing for the cabbage - adding it just prior to eating. (If the two were mixed beforehand, the acids in the tomato sauce would soon wilt the cabbage into an unappetizing pulp). So which kind should you order? I'd suggest the *ready* kind; just ask what's in the pupusas-of-the-moment and call a yea / nay on it. The best I've had so far were filled with a mixture of veal, pork and cheese.This advice holds for the place in general - in my experience, unless you have some time on your hands, you're best off ordering right from the cafeteria line, on your way to the cash register. This isn't to say that I haven't enjoyed several wonderful meals prepared-to-order, just that you're going to wait a while if that's what you'd like to do. On the upside, when I have had to wait for my food, the food both appeared and tasted unhurried - and came out piping hot. Having said this, there are so many great, ready-to-consume options, that this isn't much of an issue. But I do hope that they eventually find a way to streamline their kitchen operations, as the menu is quite large, and offers quite a few dishes that I've simply never encountered before - and they call to me, every time I visit..Because the food, here at Cafe La Palma, is fabulous! Everything I've seen, smelled, tasted or touched has come across as highly authentic and very much home-made-y. My advice? If it looks good, it IS good - you'll love it, and you'll have plenty of it. If you're unsure, don't be shy - ask for a little sample, and they'll come through for you. The portions are full-days-work generous, and only once have I been able to finish off everything put in front of me in a single sitting. Plain and simple, this place sets out some really serious grub.Prices are quite reasonable, though a few of those mysterious menu offerings, some with lovely photos, do rise into the $10-15 range. My only potential gripe with this place is the language barrier issue - which is not so bad, really, but I do sense that it's limiting my full enjoyment of everything they have to offer - and has resulted in a couple of screw-ups that proved somewhat tedious to correct. 4/5 stars for fab food served by friendly people, and a menu that has something for everyone."], ["Sarah C.", "Friendly, clean and nice.

Their menu consists mostly of a good number of different small taco options for $2.50 each and some side items. I tried the signiture Rusty Taco and the Fish Taco (Grilled). The food was ready almost before I even sat down; service was extremely quick. They have 3 different levels of salsa you can add to your tacos, all of which were pretty good with varying degrees of heat. Both tacos were tasty, thought the fish on the Fish Taco was a bit mushy... I would probably opt for fried fish the next time around. But flavors were good, fresh, and varied enough from taco to taco to add variety.Taking off one star because I wish the atmosphere was a little more sit-down-y, but then prices would also likely go up, so I'll take the good with the bad.

She was sweet, short, and wore a hairnet since, during that hour, served as both the cook and server. Since it was my first time, she suggested that I try both her tamales and tacos.Oh my goodness...She brought out a pair of steaming beef tamales that were made within the half hour. I am no tamale connoisseur, but I thought they were outstanding. Incredibly moist, packed with flavor, and perfectly salted - I was left craving for more and decided to order three more to go. They're only a little over $2 or so for each, so why not?I then had both tacos carnitas and al pastor. My initial impression was that the tortillas were slightly larger than the ones served at a traditional taqueria, and I think that they make their own. The tortillas were gently toasted on both sides and filled with diced soft meaty morsels. Although they weren't as seasoned as other Mexican restaurants I've been too, I found them to be delicious in a different way. Topped in each taco were generous handfuls of cilantro and onion, too.The tacos also came with one green and red sauce. I cannot take the heat like I used to, but food nerds that can -like my friend BK- will love these salsas. For me, though, they almost cooked my insides. However, I would easily try them again, despite knowing that I would have to lay on my bed in agony for about ten minutes. haha.For both the tacos and tamales, I washed them down with a tall glass of a sweet, cinnamon-y, and cold horchata. Loved it.Despite being filled to the brim with food and drink, when I heard that Homi served flan, I couldn't resist ordering it. If you decide to get a serving, you'll notice it's a thicker kind than other Mexican flans you may have tried and is drenched in a sweet caramel-y sauce. I left satisfied and happily carried home three more palatable tamales to devour later.Homi's not a Mexican restaurant to have margaritas with friends after work, pound shots of tequila and wear a sombrero on your head when it's your birthday, or watch soccer games; rather, it's a home-in-the-wall to get fantastic food at decent prices served by lovely people.I'll be back soon, Homi."], ["Sarah J.", "This place tasted like when I was in Mexico, as authentic as I have found yet.

My hubby and I went recently to make me feel better after a Dr. appointment and it did. I tried the Tacos for the first time I got this huge plate full of them so filling. I normally get tomalis or one of the soups. My Husband got a new dish as well that he loved. It seems every thing we try here makes us happy. I have asked her how she makes her food so tasty she says she just uses fresh ingredients, I think she must have some magic. That guacamole is not form this world. The decor is as everyone says hole in the wall they only reason I have not given 5 stars is the loud bad TV who wants to eat to day time talk shows. \u00a0The menu is fun the english translation is not good.

The place is really plain but the food is what brings you in...and will bring you back.A friend and I ate lunch here--shared a plate of green enchiladas with carnitas ($11.50) and a plate of carne asada tacos (3 tacos for $7.50.) The sauce on the enchiladas was make-your-toes-curl spicy. They were really good but I might get something different next time...like the tacos! They're simple but just delicious. We finished ours and I craved more.I've been back for a second visit, and service is the issue that keeps me from giving the place five stars. The waitress who's been there both times is a little slow and I've had to ask multiple times for things like more water, an extra plate for my granddaughter, or some silverware.The menu is really extensive so it will take a few more visits to decide what I like best."], ["Rhea S.", "Food was meh.

Marketing, branding and lush surroundings do not make a great restaurant. Mole is made to order and anyone who has cooked or learned to cook would know this. IN addition, there are many things which you could have had either vegan or vegetarian and modifying your desires without actually looking at the menu (over 15 choices for veggies) is actually speaking more about your obvious stereotypical ordering of enchiladas.Ensalada de cactus, flautas de papa y arroz con frijoles --- totally vegetarian and without cheese the salad is vegan.Why would you get refill on a 32 or 16 oz glass of Horchata no one in the Latin food scene does that NOT even Gringolandia loved Chipotle. step back Never ceases to amaze me the white girl who studies Spanish only to order margaritas in a Mexican restaurant which typically is not the case in most restaurants.In addition whether it is Trieu Chau or Ngon Bistro the staff usually eats in the dining room; the fact you mentioned this says more about your obvious class issues and your need to be a stereotypical anglo tourist in my culture. step back and bow downLa Negra Negrita de mis pesares,ojos de papel volando.Negrita de mis pesares,ojos de papel volando.A todos diles que s\u00edpero no les digas cu\u00e1ndo.As\u00ed me dijiste a m\u00ed;por eso vivo penando.\u00bfCu\u00e1ndo me traes a mi negra?Que la quiero ver aqu\u00edcon su rebozo de sedaque le traje de Tepic.\u00bfCu\u00e1ndo me traes a mi negra?Que la quiero ver aqu\u00edcon su rebozo de sedaque le traje de Tepic.Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlan I am leaving the country. I am 100% Mexican born in NorCal, raised in Houston Texas and Peoria, IL. I danced folklorica till was 16 and especially to the song above. This is what was playing in my head when I was eating my food.I immediately loved how simple the space was. I never trust a place with Talavera pottery tiles from D.F. or ornate or ugly murals. I trust my palate. The bases of the mother sauces of mole, salsa verde and enchilada sauce (de cualquier). Chiles; dried and fresh, seeds (pumpkin and sesame), ginger (dried and fresh), chocolate Mayordomo, cumin (seed and ground), epazote, Mexican oregano, Mexican vanilla, Mexican cinnamon and so many other spices.The caldo, menudo and posole bases are key too as they have the same complexity of the flavors which are required by certain proteins to possess the key sabores Mejicanos! Similar to the soul food of other major Asian soup entrees such as pho, udon or ramen...menudos y caldos are just as ingredient intensive.Horchata was think, sweetened nicely and the fresh canela a mano...de Mexico was surreal as I felt I was in San Juan de Dios in Guadalajara, having a glass while stopping to rest from shopping.Sopes. Are simple in presentation but, the technique and preparation for these heavenly earthy masa cakes is not. In addition to the cake having to possess the right amount of stiffness to maintain the tower of ingredients...they have to be bite friendly and strong. Hortencia achieved it. She was right on. Hortencia is the H-O in HOMI...she is the heart and soul. Her smile as she came to say hello was exceptional.She also came to the table and spoke to us, personally. She told us about the menudo preparation as our food did take 45 minutes but, it was worth the wait. We ate like Europeans leisurely y sin prisa! (no rushing) At my house dinner is on Mexican time, it says 7pm on the Evite but I run 30-45 mins late b/c my friends are fully aware that my food takes time.This is the same expectation.So, you are not lowering your expectations by choosing to come to a simple, non-descript authentic Mexican place. And don't be stereotypical Gringo/guero/guera and order enchiladas and tacos. Order a rich and complex dish. Order chiles rellenos, menudo, caldo de borrego...go beyond the stereotypes. Mexicans don't eat steak tacos everyday or fajEYEtas. We don't drink margaritas everyday or Corona. I know right? Colonization of the other through food is bad but, exploring a culture through authentic dishes and through the honesty which is the New American entrepreneurial condition is awesome!Thank you Hortencia for making my MSP farewell food tour so incrivel!

I am not a simple minded anglo guerra tourist with class issues and no concept of Mexican culture. Ive studied in Puerto Vallarta, my in laws live in Guerrero, mis sobrinos y cuinados son latinos, I worked and lived with mi banda de latinos en Miami and Wisconsin and my mother in law who cooks at a telescundaria has shared incredible recipes with me for mole, ceviche, tacos de papas, ensalada de cacto, chille rellenos, etc that I cook often. The man I went to Homi with was born and raised in Mexico and our friends own a minor thrills atmosphere, known for the food, eat along side your guests Mexican restaurant that does not market or advertise but still thrives.We love enmoladas de Mole, so we went to Homi just for that. On any given day, as reccomended, I too would go for a rich off the grid dish, but we went for the enchiladas de mole as thats what the reviews raved about. A server who can multitask and take a seat to eat and chat among their guests is a true gem, unfortunently we didnt experience that here, we were nearly ignored. The refills we didnt get were for water not the huge glasses of horrachata, and a fresh tamarind Margarita can be as traditional for some as jalepenos are to salsa. No bar, no biggie if the atmosphere is welcoming, and the food is good, but it wasnt for us.Maybe we went to Homi on an off day, especially considering some of the raving reviews, and I apologize if my review came across anglo angry, tacky tourist like. To Veronica, in your reviews you seem intelligent, flavorful and full of foodie fun, your review of mine wasnt, in my opinion, tastefully simple.To those who are still reading this that are seeking out Homi, Go check it out! Dont let my prior review stop you. Homi has AMAZING HORRACHATA and an owner who I wish I could have met from the phenomenal reviews of her.

The chips alone made us want to leave, but not wanting to be rude we stuck it out. Long story short, we shouldn't have. We should have just left. My boyfriend's carnitas was dry and flavorless. My gorditas didn't have much flavor, either. Everything was just disappointing and tasted like it came from a big Mexican chain restaurant.I'm fairly certain the only reason this place has such a high rating is due to the large variety of options in the attached grocery store. If you want real, authentic Mexican skip this place and head for Las Teresitas or Homi Mexican. For a good Mexican market, check out Andale in Bloomington (this smaller market also has food next door that's better than El Burrito Mercado).I won't go here for Mexican food again."], ["Jessica S.", "This was our first visit back in many years and we did not see the back seating area until after ordering our food. \u00a0We were told we could sit there, then told it was for alcohol drinkers only, and not invited to purchase alcohol.

I've frequented the Mercado several times enjoying food from the authentic street food on the patio, fast-casual in the cafeteria line, and relaxed sit down environment in the dining room, and I've never once been disappointed!Located on the primarily Hispanic lower west side of St. Paul, Burrito Mercado is an authentic Mexican grocery store and restaurant, principally frequented by natives. The friendly, informed bi-lingual employees are egger to describe the food and offer their authentic opinion. In the cafeteria line, there is a choice of all the Mexican favorites - tacos, enchiladas, fajitas, tamales, etc - assembled quickly infront of you. The best things to order in the cafeteria line are the masa entr\u00e9es (tacos, sopas, gorditas, etc.), where the house-made masa is paired with your choice of tasty, authentic protein options. The rich, complex flavor of the 26 ingredient mole sauce, reminiscent of the type of sauce a Mexican grandmother slaved over for days, makes the chicken mole the top protein choice. Soo good! Also, the hardy pork and potatoes in scrumptious, spicy green sauce are another magnificent choice. Finally, one can accessorize their entr\u00e9e with an variety of genuine garnishments like house made salsas, cojita cheese, mexican cr\u00e8ma. \u00a0All in all, I love this place.

We stopped by on a weekend in the hopes of finding barbacoa, and we found exactly that. They had lots of meat from carnitas to the barbacoa available by the pound in a hot bar. We also ate lunch at the little cafe portion of the store, having some really good sopas and enchiladas. The food was very traditional, with super tasty Mexican rice and beans on the side of each plate. They had a lot of things we like when we can get them like horchata and a bar with pickled veggies and sides that you could serve yourself. We also stopped at the meat counter and picked up some arrachera meat to take home and prepare later.The produce selection was good and at typical Mexican market prices. Limes were six for $1 and avocadoes were 99 cents. I don't know what it is, but I always feel like the quality of produce at these markets is so much better than traditional stores (where you pay twice the price!). They also had some of our favorites, including El Milagro corn tortillas. Mmmm, just a great stop for dining in or taking items home for later. Sure we'll be back.Private parking lot behind the building."], ["Kellye K.", "Maybe I've just been spoiled by the SO's family's cooking, but I'm not incredibly impressed with the actual restaurant portion of the Mercado. The ingredients aren't particularly fresh, and the portions are too big. Strange that I, an American, would say that, but they are. Based on the amount of food you get for the cost, the food itself is a great deal. El Burrito Mercado is basically Mexican fast food. It's only the fact that it's one of the few Mexican restaurants here that makes it so special.I'll be back because it's one of the few restaurants near my office.

That darned chicken breast was just dry, no matter what kind of sauce has soaked its way through the pollo's mitochondria!Restaurant only continued filling up from 1100 onward on a great, warm, sunny, and charmed day in St. Paul. Very cool addition to the south of the store, which doubles both as a market, bodega, and a cafeteria. I desired the charm of a sit-down lunch, and the ambiance was alluring--esp. Mexican tile. I've lived in a home whose kitchen was paved with such marvelous artistry.Having gotten a great deal online, I decided to splurge for lunch, as I had a suite room which included both a fridge and microwave. I'm decently skilled at delineating tortillas autenticas, hecho de maiz. I commented to the nice gal in the one of the languages that qualifies me as a polyglot that I felt those corn tortillas were one of the best I have ever eaten!!! She heartily agreed, though I joked that her waistline was offering clues that she was being mendacious (try size zero).Actually, come to think of it, those chips and salsa were pretty darned excellent too, leading me to my personal edict: ANY CORN DERIVATIVE OFFERING HERE JUST ROCKS. There; that was more accurate...(surprised I couldn't hear those maiz-laden doughballs against a stone getting tenderized by being slapped silly by an abuelita in the back)Beautifully done, the quesadillas con carne asada. I'm not usually partial to mexican rice, but the pairing of the fresh diced tomatoes together with the fresh aguacate made me mix it all up and savor my side. I tried the gordita de puerco and also the sope de pollo. Ehh on the chicken, but thumbs WAAAAAY up on the pork. Mexican pork is always shred-from-the-touch-of-the-fork tender and soft.... so wonderfully delicious. Fan, fan fan, fan.... especially since Wabasha becomes Cesar Chavez once crossing over the Mississippi River, and the charm between the two sharply contrasting areas adds all the more to the experience.

I usually get the huarache platter (grande, kids), & one of a variety of interesting bottled drinks to wash it down. It's a large serving of food, but not too large, & the flavors are really solid. Midwesterners need not fear; spice levels in the dishes are moderate, but a range of salsas are available for those of us with higher tolerances.Afterwards, I usually do some shopping in the grocery store proper. Although I'm a local/natural food type guy, the grocery at Burrito Mercado has a lot to offer. I've really taken to their bakery section, as I enjoy the emphasis on drier, flakier pastries, instead of the overly-sweet/sticky varieties typically available at most stores. Like yourself some beans? Mercado has a dizzying array to choose from, in canned & dry formats. They also offer homemade chips & tortillas (including doughs to make your own at home), & a fairly solid selection of fresh meats, cheeses, fruits, & vegetables associated with Central American cuisines. Obscure (to most North Americans, anyway) spices, too.It's nice to have a good, solid meal & leave with groceries for another one later in the week!"], ["Jennifer R.", "I enjoy a nice, well-stocked mercado, and this is definitely one of those places. It's so much fun to poke through the aisles and find things you'd never see at your friendly neighborhood Cub. But this is better than your average neighborhood Latin market: the deli counter is huge, with salsas, empanadas, different kinds of guacamole, and a big steaming tray of carnitas.Now if you're like me, you can't be near hot carnitas for any length of time without your mouth filling with drool. You gotta eat--now. And here, you can! There's a cafe area where you can just order at the counter and then tuck into your burrito (or whatever), or there's a little sit-down restaurant in the corner where you can even wash down your yummies with a cold cerveza.When we went on a Sunday afternoon, the little sit-down restaurant was pretty quiet, but the service was still fairly decent. I had the carnitas (of course), and they were decent. The husband enjoyed a plate of ancho chicken enchiladas, which were a little spicy for his taste (but, hey, ketchup is sometimes spicy for his taste).We'll definitely be back, but we'll probably stick with the little deli/cafe area in the future.Oh, and hey!

I didn't really know what I ordered last time and I still wasn't so sure this time either as far as what meat I picked but back then it was yummy and it still is! When you walk into this place, its as if you are walking into a grocery store similar to what you would expect in Mexico. Its super fun to shop here for Mexican food as well as other items. You can eat either at the cafeteria style cafe or you can go to the restaurant side. I do not see any reason why you would go to the restaurant side except you get your food delivered to you instead of prepared in front of you. I wanted to order the sopas because the man in front of me ordered them and I had a strategy this time, I was going to get exactly what he ordered since he seemed to know what he was doing. My plan failed, however, because they ran out of the little sopas so I opted for a burrito. I picked the pork meat (not sure what it was exactly) but it was really good. My daughter got the tamale platter. She thought they were OK but the masa was too thick which is exactly why I don't like tamales. She said she would not order the tamales again. The re fried beans were really good, the rice was OK. Next time I will order no rice. There was nothing spectacular about my burrito but the meat inside was really good. The deli is great, they have fresh salsas, chicarrones, churros, three milk cake, lots of yummy goodies. The people who work here, for the most part, seem rude to me but it might just be the language barrier. I never see them smile though, so not sure and they seem to be much more friendly with the Mexicans. I don't care though, I just go there to eat, not to socialize with the workers.

The sopes was also unspiced shredded steak on three less than spectacular corn bread circles with diced tomatoes, iceberg lettuce and what looked like Kraft Parmesan cheese.

It freaked my wife out enough to where she ordered I squeal out of the parking lot but no zombie lady will keep me away from these tasty tacos. I will be back, baseball bat in hand."], ["Garret R.", "Fan freaking tastic! The torta is incredible! The steak tacos are delicious and fresh. Amazing food for an amazing price. Will return... Soon!"], ["Pierre B.", "Best tacos in the twin cities. \u00a0Period. \u00a0Two tacos w/rice and beans for $5.99.The tortas are great too."], ["Andrew B.", "My turn was up ahead, but then I saw it again: that bold yellow storefront. It was beckoning me again, and this time I could not deny it. I knew nothing about the place. I pulled in the parking lot and turned off the car. Nearly all flaked off, I stared quizzically at the letters of the title, as an archaeologist staring at a stela, trying to decipher some meaning. There were all the signs of a good ethnic restaurant: in a possibly sketchy part of town, a rather fluky aesthetic, and rudimentary signage. I was sold, no dish is denied my fork.What I ended up getting was a variety of tacos, eaten under the allure of upbeat Hispanic music and surrounded by sentimental decoration. The value is remarkable; the food more than reasonable. This wouldn't be the last visit."], ["Chris M.", "Taqueria Los Paisanos has had a few coats of paint applied and other small upgrades over the years, but one thing has remained consistent - solid, affordable Mexican food with friendly service.While there isn't a shortage of taquerias and other Latin cuisine within a few blocks of this intersection of E 7th and Arcade., the affordable tacos, and more notably, the tortas, are the reason I'll keep coming back. Oh, and the fact that I can wash either or all down with a Modelo doesn't hurt either.The location itself isn't anything worth writing home about, but the inside is clean and has recently been gussied up a bit (relatively speaking), so it's certainly not just a takeout joint (though it's by no means fine dining either)."], ["Joelle L.", "I ordered carne asada nachos to go. When I got home I realized that they put carnitas on by mistake, ok I like carnitas but there was no meat, it was pure fat, globs of fat. Then they use canned cheese sauce instead of anything remotely resembling cheese and about a cup of sour cream. I threw away the whole thing it was completely inedible. My boyfriend got el pastor torta which he liked. I will never come back because there are many other taco places in the area that serve much better food."], ["Gabrielle H.", "Loved the torta with chicken! So delicious. Super friendly service. I can't wait to try the flan!!!"], ["Adam M.", "Awesome Tacos, try the carnitas and Lengua, my opinion they are the best. Great, quick service. Nothing else you can ask for, Well worth a try if you haven't been there! They also deliver for orders over $30!"], ["Mo M.", "Love this place! Al pastor and steak are both mouth watering, in tacos (my favorite), burritos, or quesadillas. Fast, friendly, and no frills. We get take out from here several times a month. Never had a bad experience.I will say I don't love their tortas. They won't get knocked a star from me on that though, because I only love Manny's Tortas. Never had another I liked, so it might be me and tortas."], ["Patti I.", "I recently moved back to Minnesota from the Bay Area. I lived a couple miles from \"Little Michoac\u00e1n\" in Redwood City and I really miss the great tacos and sopes there. Based on Yelp reviews, I visited Taqueria Los Paisanos today. It's the closest \u00a0I've had to RWC tacos. In my experience, the best tacos are found at little places where you order at the counter, not at sit-down restaurants where the tacos come on a combo plate with rice and beans.I ordered 2 tacos, Al Pastor and Pollo, $1.75 apiece. Each taco consisted of two small soft corn tortillas, seasoned meat, chopped onion and cilantro. I was disappointed that sopes were not on the menu, but I spied the cook making one and asked. They're $2.50 apiece, about 4-5\" in diameter, with beans, lettuce, meat, cheese, onion, and cilantro. Filling and delicious!The place was pretty busy when we arrived, and it took awhile for our order to be ready. But it was super-fresh and hot. The woman who took our order opened an avocado and mashed it on the spot to make us a side order of guacamole. Yum!The reason I gave four stars instead of five is that the salsas--one red and one green--could have been better. They weren't that spicy or flavorful."], ["Dan S.", "I've been here a few times and it may be the best Taqueria in the metro. \u00a0Yes, I've tried the plethora of places on the West Side and East Lake. \u00a0For me it's all about simplicity. \u00a0For $1.50 you can get steak, pulled pork, or chicken that's been simmering in spices on two corn tortillas, mixed with onions and cilantro, add a squirt of lime juice or some chili sauce for additional flavor. \u00a0That's it. \u00a0It's all super fresh and super tasty.The menu is in Spanish and most of the employees speak only very limited English. \u00a0They have a few other menu options, but I'm only there for the tacos."], ["Eric S.", "The Cheek Tacos are some of the best I have had anywhere. Al Pastor is also second to none."], ["Greg S.", "My go-to for Mexican. Authentic and delicious tacos -- which is just about all I ever eat there. I'm a sucker for corn tortillas, steak, onion and cilantro tacos -- simple and perfect. Add a bit of lime and I could eat it everyday. The sauces are also delicious, the staff is friendly. Every time I get tacos here, I say to myself, \"I could eat here everyday.\"I have no doubt the other menu items are good, but the tacos are good enough to get each and every time."], ["Seth M.", "Best...Mexican Food...Ever!Typical East Side Mexican food joint. Not much to look at, but it was clean. \u00a0Parking is a bear if you're not there early. I was the first one there and they must have just opened because the griddle wasn't even fired up yet. The only downside I can say is the place smelled fairly strongly like floor cleaner which is both good and bad. Bad in that it's not a good smell. Good in that I was reassured they kept a clean establishment. But once they started cooking, that went away pretty quick.I wanted to try a few different things so I got a steak torta, two tacos (real tacos, not tex-mex hard or soft shell), one steak and one chicken and a tamale. They include a couple of bottles of sauce on your tray (one red sauce and one green) which you return when you are done.I started with the torta and it was incredible. I don't believe I have ever had a torta before and I was blown away by the flavor. The sauces are mild so I loaded it up with green chili sauce as well. I can still remember how it tasted. I hope I wasn't making it too obvious to the guy behind me how much I was enjoying it.The tacos were great and the tamale was worth trying. Add some fountain Dr. Pepper in the mix and I was a very satisfied customer. I am curious to try other Mexican places in that area since I haven't had good Mexican in so long but I am afraid I will hold them to the standard of Taqueria Los Paisanos and be disappointed every time. Get here if you can."], ["jared h.", "Great authentic tacos. Try the roast pork tacos and the Al pastor quesadilla. Skip the rice and beans.and um wear a coat in the winter in here... the propane space heater was a bit concerning"], ["Kate C.", "Good food, fast service, clean place. We'll return."], ["Jasmine Y.", "\"Everybody is a Taco fan!\"I never really like Mexican food but this place makes some awesome Tacos! That's probably the only thing I would get though. Feel free to explore but personally I love to eat the steak tacos. They taste amazing. their menu is simple, cheap and the workers are very friendly. The food tastes so authentic! I love inside! It's fairly large, beautifully colored with pink, green, etc. Lots of booths and a few tables. There is a large TV in the dining hall and bathrooms. What I really like about the restaurant is that it is usually quite which makes it a nice place for a private dinner. Parking is nice, they don't serve alcohol. There is not an outdoor seating area, they accept cards and cash. Overall I'm very impressed with the place. Definitely a place to try!"], ["Jim S.", "Authentic Mexican tacos. My favorite are the carnitas.My fussy 12 year old loves the cheese queadillas with just cheese.TJ a friend of mine turned me on to this place and I have never been disappointed.A long time ago this was a Clark's submarine shop. I'm awfully glad \u00a0it turn into a great little east side restaurant."], ["Omar A.", "Great little restaurant. Try the steak tortas. wasn't a fan of the chicken burrito."], ["Allison D.", "The first time I went here was right after they first opened, some years back. The food was everything I wanted, the service...not so much. The cashier, (female), was rude and short with me. I had a feeling that it was discriminatory. I then began to go to Los Ocampos on Arcade st., which is comparable, but way overpriced.So...I decided to try Los Paisanos again after about 4 years, just because of my craving for authentic Mexican and the good reviews here. Glad I did! Same great food and the service is now very friendly and welcoming. I always order the carne asada tacos, sometimes the combo with rice and beans. I must say the rice is nothing special, but the beans are definitely NOT from a can as some other reviews have stated! The only thing I didn't like is that they have a sign stating that they deliver, but when I called today, the lady said they do not. Disappointing since I am without a vehicle, at the moment. I love it so much...I found a ride!"], ["Calypso C.", "Disgusting.My boyfriend and I ordered a shredded beef burrito, two shredded beef tacos, a shredded beef enchilada and a side of beans and rice to share. The \"beef\" tasted like a soggy dishrag cut into thin strips. It was extremely dry, but as you bit into it a flavorless water spilled out. It was horrible. The beans were obviously canned and a little dry, the rice was undercooked and tasted burnt. The \"enchilada\" was simply a taco flipped over with some unidentifiable cheese smothering it but no sauce. How can an enchilada not have sauce?The toppings were fresh (onion, cilantro) and the tortilla fresh but the beef was just disgusting.The guacamole was very good, but I could make better myself at home."], ["Amy M.", "Fresh ingredients, pretty good prices, fast service. Authentic Mexican."], ["M P.", "This is the best taqueria food I've had since I lived in San Francisco. \u00a0While the burritos could be a bit more carefully rolled and the shredded beef was a tad dry and lacked some flavor, everything else was fresh and superb. \u00a0The guac was perfect and made fresh to order. \u00a0The horchata was delicious and refreshing. \u00a0Place is clean and service fast and courteous. \u00a0We were just passing through and looking for a good, fast lunch for us and the kids. \u00a0We got a real treat! \u00a0I would especially recommend the tacos."]], "Anita's Cafe and Catering": [], "Morelos": [["Ana T.", "(I am not sure if the address is currently accurate on here?? It is located in the strip mall at the intersection of Dodd Rd and Smith, within the little strip mall there). Very unassuming from the front but now that they have been open for a while, the inside if fully established.Been here a couple times now and have yet to dislike something. Their horchata is house made and the BEST I have tried... EVER.... please, please try their horchata...Food is fast and delicious. Have tried their menudo, fried fish, sopes, a veggie omelete (also interesting to note-- they have pancakes!), and the cuban torta (something to rave about). Everything is very generously portioned and I have left feeling like a water balloon every time. Only because it is so fantastic do I insist on stuffing myself to that pathetic extent !!They charge for refills on the chips & salsa! Just beware-- they ask if you want more, and then a charge of about $3 for the refill shows up on your receipt. Also a huge fan of the salsa verde the chips come with... clearly house made with an amazing avocado taste.Would highly recommend this place."], ["Martha Z.", "My husband has been wanting to try this place, but I was resisting for some reason. Maybe because it doesn't look impressive in its strip mall location....but as the saying goes: don't judge a book by its cover! This place was amazing!! The beef soup (Caldo de Res) was redonkulous. The broth was flavorful and the beef melted in my mouth. The refried beans were the best I have ever had and the Alambre Morelos was so, SO good. We will be back again and again.
