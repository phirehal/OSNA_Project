The quality of the ingredients, though, seemed high, which was a plus.Prices are really great and service was nice, but because it was a Saturday evening and the place is a hole-in-the-wall, it took quite a long time for us to be seated and to get our food - which would definitely have been worth it if the food made up for it. Knowing that it's right across the street from a university, the restaurant is probably a great spot for college students, where they can get some well-priced unique food.

Lately, I've been ordering their chopped salad--there are so many ingredients and flavors going on in the dish but it works. Their portions are also very generous. If you order off their catering menu for an event, go for the crostini assortment and roasted tomato flatbread!They are my favorite!"], ["Rowena N.", "I came here for a work meeting and as per usual, the service and food were excellent. We made reservations beforehand given that lunchtime can be busy. We were seated and waited immediately.We first shared a sort of mediterranean appetizer platter which had crab cakes, chicken skewers, artichoke dip with pita bread, gyro meat with tzarziki sauce. The platter was plenty for 6 of us to share. I loved the crab cake so much that i end up getting the crab cake sandwich. Food came hot and fresh about 15 minutes after we ordered.As noted, I ordered the crab cake sandwich with fries, and a cup of clam chowder because I have a tendency to eat one large meal a day. The clam chowder was so so so good. Coming from California, I was honestly surprised given I am always wary about seafood in the midwest. But the soup was rich and \u00a0plenty of clams that appeared fresh rather than from a can. I regret not getting a bowl of this despite i was rolling out in pain from overstuffing myself. The crab sandwich was also quite good. The crab cakes were not too dry or oily and fell apart when biting in the sandwich (in a good way). It was topped with a fennel and pear slaw which gave it a little added sweetness. The tartar sauce came on the side which I thought was a smart move because I love tartar sauce, probably more than even ketchup. I probably should have boxed half the 'wich but I gobbled the whole thing up. The french fries were plentiful and freshly fried. Again, I finished everything and rolled out in pain and partial self loathing from overstuffing myself with yummy food.I been here probably over 10 times for work meetings and it continues to rank high on the places I'd bring friends, colleagues, or visiting faculty. Definitely will be back, and likely will leave overstuffed again."], ["Katharine M.", "As a U of M student, I expect relatively little service upon entering a restaurant. After all, collegiate are not exactly known as excellent tippers. Kafe 421, however, has provided me with nothing but superb service, food, and ambience- regardless of whether I enter alone or with my parents. The restaurant is a lovely \"nicer\" restaurant for a special occasion or date, with fresh white table cloths, candles and a wine bar. The servers are attentive and courteous. Nothing but excellent manners, no pressuring to order many courses, and flexible with particular orders. The food- oh boy! Fresh ingredients, refined preparation, and a wide variety to suit any palate makes this a great option for anyone. My personal favorite is the delectable harvest salad with grilled shrimp. My mother and father, born in a city with far superior Greek food to Minneapolis, were thoroughly impressed with their spinach pie and gyro platter. All in all, a wonderful experience at an extraordinarily reasonable price. Highly recommend."], ["William C.", "I was a little skeptical going into this place...but it ended up being a great experience! \u00a0This place is located in the heart of Dinkytown and parking is a b*tch. \u00a0Your options are the limited number of metered parking spaces, the parking ramp 2 blocks away or you can roll the dice and find free parking a few blocks away. \u00a0Once you get that figured out, make your way into this joint and you'll see it's much bigger inside.I had reservations and did have to wait about 5 minutes as they cleared our table. \u00a0Once seated, menus and water came out shortly after. \u00a0I will say, it's pretty dark inside, we had a table in the back and you may need a flashlight to read the menu if you can't see well in the dark (who can?!). \u00a0Anyhoo, the menu is filled with plenty of options; from crab cakes and pita chips to burgers, pasta and meatloaf. \u00a0As a family, we ended up ordering...*Crispy Calamari with Romesco Sauce*Kaf\u00e9 421 Signature Humus dip (w/pita bread)*Lamb Burger*Bolognese*Petite Steak*Gyro PlatterI had the lamb burger and it was a little different than I imagined. \u00a0The lamb was amazing; ground and seasoned well. \u00a0It's served panini style, grill marks and all. \u00a0Fresh cucumbers, onions, feta and tzatziki. \u00a0All around great burger/sandwich; more a sandwich than burger (I had envisioned burger bun...). \u00a0The bolognese was good (nothing super distinct, but well made), the gyro platter was EXCELLENT. \u00a0Lots of gyro meat, packed full of flavor!All in all, good food and great service :-)"], ["Ketti M.", "We went for our first time tonight. \u00a0I liked the vibe, quaint - yet active.

The ambience of the restaurant was nice, with a dim-lit, and calming atmosphere. Went there with a group of friends for dinner and we were seated in the back of the restaurant. The menu offered a variety of items that were fairly priced. I ordered the spanakopita as an appetizer and was disappointed. There was an overload of spinach and not enough feta cheese or flaky bread. The main courses we ordered consisted of lamb burgers, eggplant burgers, and salads. Everyone seemed to be happy about their dishes, however, not exactly thrilled. Service was good.

Both were delicious and well prepared, great beer selection too!"], ["Rich T.", "Kafe 421 is a hidden jewel in the epicenter of Dinkytown. Every dish I have been served has been pretty good.

Later, we went in to use the restroom and found out there's a backroom dining area that actually has A/C! Could've sat there if the rude bartender would've mentioned that. Anywhooo, the service did not get much better when the waitress took over. She was unattentive to say the least. However, everything we ordered was great. Artichoke dip w/ delish pita bread.

I went on a Saturday evening with a group of 9, and it was not a problem to grab a table right away.

I got potato and leek (soup of the day), and my mom got tomato basil soup. My mom is a weird eater cos she likes to mix this with that when she eats. This time, she mixed both potato and tomato soup in one spoon. She said it was a good combination together (sour tomato + creamy potato), and yep she was right. :DWe ordered \u00a0pan seared scallops with coconut risotto and mango salsa and bouillabaisse for our mains. The pan seared scallops were good, but I thought the scallops were kind of overdone to the point that they became a bit chewy. The coconut risotto and mango salsa were a perfect addition to the dish. Creamy coconut risotto went oh so well with the tangy mango salsa. The bouillabaisse was also good. Everything was fresh and flavorful.

Score! \u00a0Back to the service front, our waitress returned our breadbasket with only 3 pieces (huh?), served us the wrong bottle of wine ($36 white instead of $25 red), and was MIA for a good majority of the time. \u00a0However, the atmosphere = fun/cozy, and overall a charming ambiance.Food wise: \u00a0Quite delicious. \u00a0I split the Gyros Platter with a friend and oh my, was it tasty. \u00a0Only complaint was too much lamb, too little pita, and the \"greek salad\" that comes with, is rather a joke, as it comes in a tiny custard like cup, aka basically you can get 2 bites of salad. \u00a0Otherwise, this is definitely a pretty good deal, as you get about 6 gyros out of it, some yummy french fries, and delish cucumber sauce. \u00a0I would also strongly recommend the Pavo sandwich, if you're not feeling the Greek/lamb trend.All in all, a definite DO in my books.

The tacos are actually on the lunch menu, but since they accidentally gave us the wrong menus, the waitress let me order them. The fish had nice flavor, but the meat was a little dry. I like the fresh avocado slices, but wasn't a huge fan of the raw onions. The tomato basil soup is excellent. Great flavor, and super creamy. Other entrees orderd at our table included the scallops, a burger and the turkey pavo sandwich. All of the entrees seemed to be a hit.We also decided to get a little dessert. We tried the key lime pie and the chocolate chip bread pudding, which was a special that night. The pie was excellent, not too tart and very smooth. It also had a delicious raspberry sauce drizzled on top. The bread pudding had good flavor, but it was served cold, which I didn't care for. Normally, bread pudding comes out hot so the ice cream melts on top. I probably wouldn't order this again unless they served it warm.All in all, this is a great little spot in Dinkytown.

And now I've I stopped by here with my friend for an early dinner/late lunch (lunner? dunch?) and was seated promptly. The back section of the restaurant is dimly lit, with beautiful art work and almost a homey feeling to it. Their menu is simple and filled with Cafe fare with a little bit of a Mediterranean twist (e.g. gyros, hummus and dips, spanakopita, and baklava). Here's how our dinner ended up:1) Bread Service: Very good and warm, and I like how they serve it with olive oil with pepper. Yes, please, over the butter. 2) Pita with two dips: We chose roasted eggplant dip and hummus. The pita was phenomenal; it was warm and chewy and just sooooooo good. The eggplant, to my friend's point, was overtaken by the garlic, so I barely tasted it. The hummus was OK, but not really that amazing. But, I couldn't stop eating the appetizer because I just wanted to stuff myself with the pita. 3) Eggplant Milanese Panini with tomato basil soup: It was a unique blend of flavors, with some roasted peppers and other vegetables atop a lightly breaded eggplant slice. The soup was a classic, not too salty with just the right amount of bite and gritty tomato pulp to satisfy me. 4) Lamb Burger with Fries: This was DIVINE. I loved everything about this plate, most of all the meat. The lamb was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The inside was still so juicy and reminded us of gyro meat, except it's between two slices of perfectly pressed vienna bread. The cucumbers and raita provided the perfect, cold balance to the hot & moist meat (Please, hold on to your comments, gutter-brains). There was nothing epic about the fries, but my good vibes about the burger definitely passed on to them and even the damn ketchup. 5) Tiramisu with Vanilla Creme Anglaise: At this point, Kafe 421 could do no wrong in my mind, as I've had a consistently great dinner. That said, this dessert honestly rocked in its own right. The creme anglaise was such a wonderful addition to the cake.I'm still patting myself on the back.

It was an appropriate amount of food for two to be satiated, but not super full. Hubby went home and ate a big cookie afterwards hehee. The cauliflower had great texture, but it was really salty. The kofta meatballs were seasoned really well, but I wish they came with more mint and sauce. The vegetable tagine was heavy on the chickpeas which were just slightly more al dente than I would like. The cilantro made the dish, and there wasn't enough of it so we requested more for the table.The front of the restaurant has great ambiance, but the bathrooms are a huge disconnect.

It was probably an off night of sorts but our server was very rude, unfriendly, and not helpful at all. The manager checked on us and resolved the situation but it did leave us with a bad impression. The Sauteed Parisian Gnocchi was a bit dense and tough. The Roasted Chicken wasn't too memorable. The consensus around the table - it wasn't worth the upscale price.

There were several Yelpers in the dining room tonight, it could have been a Yelp event. I was able to say hey to Kara D and her party just in time after they devoured the lamb brain. Saffron was a great suggestion and we had a great delicious meal here tonight.We had reservation at 7:15 PM and they called at 5:00 PM to confirm. When we got there, the restaurant was half empty. It didn't stay half empty for long as by 8, it was a full house. They seated us right away though we were early, and we had a nice table overlooking the whole restaurant. I had expected the place to be fancier and dressier; however, it was not at all stuffy and fancy. It was perfectly carried out like a Michelin star restaurant as far as service with a more demure and casual atmosphere. I kinda liked it and it was a bit cool to get the over the top service while my check won't be over $100.We started with the octopus a la plancha. It was a tiny plate consisted of four pieces of octopus in oily sauce with paprika and garlic. It started the meal so well as the octopus pieces were tender, and so flavorful. That oil sauce was explosion of flavors.. You could taste spices, brine, coarse salt, and so much smokiness but not overwhelming. I was really into it and could eat the whole thing myself and order one more. The octopus was not easy to cut but yet when you use your teeth, it was tender as tender can be. It was wonderful.The poached lobster salad was worth the $6 upcharge. It felt very french and it was light. Can't hate the soft cooked egg though it was so four years ago. It still helped dressed the salad quite beautifully along with the tarragon champagne dressing.The fingerling potatoes two ways, with some being sliced thin and crisped up was perfect for texturing. I enjoyed this simple salad and the lobsters were great. It's simple, subtle, yet refined.I went with the braised chicken and prawn while my friend went with the Greek Lamb Cassoulet. I love Cassoulet but I am a lamb hater. If not, I would have always gone with Cassoulet. My friend loved her dish and she said the giant beans soaked in all the sauce and it was vivid flavoring all around. I had a taste but I was turned off by the gaminess of the lamb. It wasn't their fault. I'm just not into lamb but the dish was bold, colorful, and served beautifully in a hot plate.My chicken dish was heaven. It felt so comforting. The chicken leg was so tender but it didn't lose its integrity. Being a big fan of braising method, that chicken has been simmered awhile to have that type of blossoming flavor. Again, the paprika was very pronounced and the prawns were plump and I had fun sucking on the head. The chickpeas that were the bed for the chicken and the prawns were crunchy and it was just great texture. I really really enjoyed my entr\u00e9e. It was a dish properly prepared. It was delicious!Mascarpone Panna Cotta was a perfect segue to dessert and it almost served as palette cleanser as it was very delicate and subtle. Surprisingly, it was really fun to eat and savor. I loved mixing it up with the sliced grapes and the crumbles of pistachio and some other crumbs I couldn't name. It was tiny but we spent the whole twenty minutes that we had left on the parking meter savoring this dessert. We started with this one as we thought the Chocolate and Turkish Coffee Trifle would overwhelm our tastebud. It was a great choice but after we were done with the panna cotta, we were both so satisfied we didn't need the second dessert. The trifle was fine. The milk chocolate pudding and the coffee granita were nice. I'm not a fan of the cardamom cake but it was fine. It was a proper dessert and fitting to the cuisine.We had a pretty successful meal with impeccable service. We saw Saed Wadi mingling and talking to customers, while Sameh Wadi was in the back but bringing food back and forth to this one table by us. That was cool. If I had one tiny criticism was the entrees were both a bit overseasoned with salt. However, it wasn't so much that I couldn't handle it. I still gave Saffron five stars as quite honestly, I wasn't at all prepared to be blown away on Restaurant Week. However, they gave us a stellar meal at discounted price.I would love to go back and try their regular menu. The RW's tasting menu for $30 was hard to beat. They really made it right using the event to make people fall in love and come back for more. I really could see how Chef Wadi held his own against Morimoto on Mackerel battle. The foods were fantastic here. Awesome job, Saffron. Very well done!Oh btw..I have eaten at Daniel Boulud's restaurants, as well as restaurants of Iron Chefs Morimoto, Puck, Batali, Symon, Garces, and Flay. I am also a James Beard Foundation Member. I hope I'm qualified to write this review. :)"], ["Alejandro L.", "I had bigger hopes for this place based on World Street Kitchens great recipes (same owner and chef), and even though it was a good experience, it wasn't fantastic."], ["Kara D.", "5 stars for our Restaurant Week experience!I didn't ask my friends if they wanted to go here during RW, but TOLD them I had already made reservations. The night started perfectly, with easy and cheap street parking, a pleasantly un-packed dining room, and a cocktail quickly in hand. I loved the Saffron Rose. I think I have a problem, because when I first saw the small elegant glass I worried if there was enough alcohol in it for me, but alas, there was! Our server was bubbly and in great spirits. Which I always commend more so on RW nights because the poor things are repeating the same crap over and over again.We couldn't not order the lamb brain. It was recommended on a talk thread, plus I said I'd try it so I couldn't look like a pussy now. The whole table (4 ppl) enjoyed it, but it was such a small serving that I don't think I got enough to go by from my 1/4 of a bite. It had a mild taste and tender texture, and the garlic and tomatoes were delicious accompaniments. We asked for pita bread to soak up the rest of the flavors and grey matter mmm. A highlight of the night was the smoked trout app - it had every flavor you would ever want on one balanced plate - savory, sweet, smokey, fresh... ahhh. I ordered the chicken and prawns. I usually don't order chicken, but this was falling off the damn bones into a mouth-watering sauce and I was grateful that I allowed this to be in my life. Another favorite was the lamb dish, which was not too game-y but packed with bold flavors. I'm so f'ing hungry right now.Oh, and Saed Wadi magically appeared at our table like a mythical creature. He was hilarious and helped us take photos of our food by setting up some sick ass iphone flashlight lighting. We had a good laugh and like that, he was gone. Did we dream this?We loved both the Mascarpone Panna Cotta and Chocolate and Turkish Coffee Trifle desserts. The trifle paired heavenly with the house-chosen port. So much so that when the server merely walked up to us, my friend pulled her trifle and port towards herself and basically hissed at the server. That's my girl."], ["Evan K.", "Came here for business dinner and was satisfied but not overly impressed. Cocktails were delicious. Had the Halibut and several appetizers.

This is one of their favorite places so i went here. I found the place just okay.First trip: Had wine and selection of Traditional Spreads including Hummus, Lentils and Eggplants. They replaced feta with hummus on my request, which was nice of them. Pita breads and Hummus were really tasty but lentils and eggplant was just okay. Pinot they poured was great.Second Trip: I had Vegetable Tangine and beer. Tangine was just okay too, not bad \u00a0but not great either. Tangine is little expensive for the quality.Service is really fast. I dined at bar so maybe its because of that but my food got served within 5 minutes of order. Staff is friendly.I would give 3.5 stars as that's not the option, i would go for 4."], ["Karl W.", "Anticipating Saffron might be the reason that I was a bit disappointed overall. The cocktails were the highlight of the night. Both the Heart Beets cocktail (containing beet juice and absinthe) and Saffron Rose (champagne rose) we're very good. For the entrees, the Pork chops were very flavorful, but limited with meat and physically had to gnaw on the bone. Chicken with eggplant overall was good, chicken was perfectly cooked. For the bad, both the green beans and Brussel sprouts came highly recommended. The sprouts were terrible, half cooked at best and hard. Green beans were ok but should have been served warm in my opinion. Came early on a Wednesday which might have been the issues I saw, or the kitchen was off. Either way, Saffron is one of the top rated restaurants in the city and will certainly venture here again with a different menu selection."], ["David D.", "Saffron is very large, and spacious, and the host greeted me graciously. There is a cool bar area, as well as the more formal, but very open-concept dining room.My server was attentive and extremely pleasant, super cool guy. I had to pour my own water a couple times, and they don't do the fancy things such as match your linen to your clothing, but otherwise the staff was helpful.I had a few items, as I wanted to experience something different while keeping it slightly healthy. I was interested to hear about how the Branzino and various items are sourced from Greece! This is real-deal Mediterranean, but with a little flair. ;)Here's what I had:1) Charred Octopus -- very good. Tender inside, crisp on the outside, and cooked in an ever-so lightly spiced olive oil. I enjoyed it tremendously. Decent portion. Reminded me of Kanella back home in Philadelphia2) Garden Salad -- also very good. They offer very interesting salads at Saffron and this was well sized without being overwhelming. Lots of different tastes going on here3) Brussel Sprouts -- cooked to my liking in that they were tender, but the sauce was very heavy with a truffle oil that I found overpowering. I plowed through anyway!4) Seafood Tangine -- Tasty dish, but to be honest, didn't knock my socks off. I'm a big fish eater and enjoy all the textures, which was lost here in the tangine concoction. Don't get me wrong, the seafood was excellent, fresh, good portions, eclectic (shellfish, white fish), and the vegetables in particular were soft and enjoyable, however, everything seemed to blend in a way that lost some of the sophistication of the different tastes but didn't take it up a notchI bailed on dessert, since I felt like a pig at this point! Would definitely go back when craving Mediterranean"], ["Alexander V.", "Wow.Duck meatballs for the win.I had some lamb, it was okay. Then the duck meatballs came out and blew this experience out of the water.Great flavor. The sauce was spectacular. We dipped so much bread into the sauce!I was unsure of this place because the curb appeal is a bit lacking. I walked into a wide open dining concept. Almost too wide open, it felt a bit empty with the layout, but that's probably a good thing when this place fills up.The service was good.I can't gush enough about the duck meatballs though, try them!"], ["Andrew T.", "The food has real decent flavor. It doesn't open up until about 5:00 pm. The entrees are a little pricy in my opinion ($20-$40). I had a cocktail which was very unique and flavorful - it had Apple Jack whiskey and homemade pomegranate grenadine. It was only $5.00 for happy hour but it was very small. I had the Mid-eastern sausage appetizer which I found pretty good. It had pine nuts in the meat which was unique, and it came with some pretty decent pita bread. The sauce was pretty heavy on the lemon juice, however - almost overwhelming. I also ordered the Parisian Gnocchi which was tasty. The flavor was there, but the portion size was very small considering the price. It did have black truffle in it so that may have contributed a little. Some tasty greens, carrots, peas, corn, green beans, raddish, and asparagus. There was a little sauce which was good, and the spices were really good. This place is unique so give it a try - a solid 4 out of 5."], ["Cindy T.", "I've been here for two different birthdays and I wasn't sure what I thought at first. The restaurant is dark and classy, with high ceilings and different types of seating. Maybe I am not a fan of fusion food. However, the dishes I've tried are nothing to complain or rave about. I've had the pear salad, a fig appetizer, gnocchi, hummus, fried cauliflower, lamb brain, lamb chops, and a bite of one of the tagines. This is not the best food I've had, but it's solid/good.One thing I must mention are the drinks. They are wonderful! My personal favorites are the 1999, aviator, and heart-beet (which tastes oddly healthy and sweet!). The bartenders here know their stuff."], ["Kev H.", "Restaurant week! An excuse to pack on a few extra calories and expand the waistline without damaging one's bottom line. Made a reservation through opentable, was called day of by the restaurant confirming my reservation status. Arrived a little bit early, but I was seated almost right away.Inside the ambiance is classy trendy without that air of snootyness. There is a laid back vibe here, but one that can lend itself to dates, group celebrations, or just a casual get together.There is a one page drink menu, and a one page menu that lists some plates to share, some apps, and some entrees. On the restaurant week menu was the list of menu items for the 3 course prix fixe menu.The starter options consisted of a watermelon salad or a cucumber soup (an additional option where you add $6 for some kind of seafood item, but I don't remember what it was). The entree let you pick between lamb with lentils or gnocci (a 3rd option, +$6, was a crab type dish). The dessert had you picking between pana cotta and a chocolate bread pudding.I started with the soup. Out came a shallow plate/dish with some whitish tzatsiki looking sauce. The waiter then proceeded to pour a thick green soup onto the plate, creating an appealing looking contrast of colors. The green part was savory, the white part was a little on the sour side, and together they created a whole different flavor palate. Quite a fun little dish. (My friend went the watermelon route. When it came out, I thought it was pieces of tuna sashimi, as it was plated like a Japanese sushi plate. Tried some, flavors were crisp and clean, with some spicyness added to it).The lamb came out, laying atop a bed of lentils. It wasn't aggressively seasoned, and it lacked that strong lamb flavor that some people may find off putting. All in all, a well cooked lamb with great flavor that paired excellently with the crisp, almost crunchy lentils.Now the dessert - the bread pudding came out, with a crumble of nuts laying atop and a pool of caramel on the side of the pudding. I carefully crafted a single bite that would contain all the above elements, and proceeded to try it. In a word, amazing! It was decadent without feeling too rich. I could have eaten probably like 5 entire plates of it, but I managed to reign it in.All in all, good ambiance, spot on dishes that deliver, and some friendly, attentive waitstaff. I'd definitely come here again.Apparently this means I need to check out World street kitchen now?"], ["Don C.", "This was my first time at Saffron.We had reservations, but got there early enough to relax with a couple of drinks.

However, when we did find it, we couldn't actually find any parking spots, due to no parking lot. We had to park across from Walgreens down the block and walk back. Once we got inside, we saw that it was a fairly small restaurant. We got there early, so we ordered some bread and hummus. I also ordered a ginger beer, which was awesome. The food here is extremely DELICIOUS! I ordered the falafel royal combination plate. I was surprised that the falafel did not come wrapped in pita bread, but the surprise went away once I had that first bite. The rice substitution was totally on point, and every bite was savory.

Everything is old school including how they take orders, which adds to the charm. When we asked to have our bill split, they were fine doing it but they had to do it by hand. In all honesty, I'm a value shopper. Barbary Fig did not deliver on expectations when it came to value - their portions were all over the place for different dishes. We ordered a house appetizer to start which was octopus for the night on a bed of garlic mashed potatoes that turned out to be very garlicky and somewhat grainy, probably pushed through a ricer. The octopus was very tender and all in all it was a very flavorful, yummy dish for $8. The salad was HUGE and was definitely worth the price on the menu, and looked delicious! My dining friends confirmed its deliciousness. The entrees were what surprised me. I ordered two dishes - the combo royale and the shek-suka (can't remember actual name). The combo royale was about $14, and for the portion and the flavor it was definitely worth it. Quality was there, perfectly seasoned, quantity was good, but it was very greasy and my dining friends thought that everything was too salty. We all needed refills of water within 10 minutes of starting to eat, although it really did enhance the dishes. The shek, which was about $10, was meager. It was a very thin layer of scrambled eggs with lamb sausage, caramelizing onions, and seasonings. It tasted good but the quantity should've considered more an appetizer. The apricot fava over a bed of rice looked good but my friend was continuously salting her plate. All in all the dishes we got were tasty, but the quantity and quality could be somewhat inconsistent.

Hummus plate came out quite fast and it was odd that the dish came out with bread instead of pita, but no complaints since the bread was fresh and crispy. Overall a fine dish. Our entrees came out about 15 min. later and the lamb shank was HUGE. Basically covered the entire dish! The meat was very tender, served over yellow rice with leeks and some veggies (sweet potatoes? or maybe sweet carrots?). Besides the fact that it could've used a little more salt, I absolutely loved the dish. Finished the whole thing and was tempted to lick the plate. What I loved most was that I didn't feel overly stuffed-just perfectly full. Not to mention the prices here are excellent!

I was instantly charmed when first finding out that they work with organic and local ingredients whenever possible. Some of the foods that stands out in my dining experiences are:Fava dip - Better than hummus! They use yellow split peas rather the garbanzo beans. Psito - Seasoned and roasted leg of lamb (I LOVE lamb!). It has a more distinct flavor than beef, so if you're not a lamb fan, you CAN'T judge this dish! Also served up with roasted lemon potatoes. This is a wonderfully hardy entree.Baklava - This ISN'T like the other baklava that I've had. I had originally resigned myself to stop eating baklava until I tried Gardens of Salonica's version. It doesn't have that sickly-oversaturated-sweetness that most contain. I found out that they add the honeyed syrup after baking it rather than before. This detail made all the difference in the world!Besides the great food, I'm even more drawn to their efforts in drawing community together.

This was one of two vegan entree options. Normally the dish comes with either a soup or a Greek salad, but none of the soups were vegan and the Greek salad has feta. Strangely, they wouldn't allow me to substitute a vegan salad, of which they had four or five different options.The Yigandes was really delicious and simple---lots of olive oil, garlic, onions and a really fresh, home-cooked flavor. It seemed like an excellent sauce more than anything else and I wondered why they don't serve the dish with fettuccine or some kind of egg-free noodle; on its own, the dish is tasty, but feels insubstantial in quantity and needs a starch component. It's definitely a small portion and therefore, at $8, a bit on the pricier side.On a whole, though, I liked the food and atmosphere here. I think they could make a few adjustments to be more vegan-friendly (like adding a couple more dishes and soups, allowing for substitutions of vegan salads, and offering a vegan dessert) but it's still a great, unusual place in the Northeast."], ["A B.", "I'm sure this place is \"great\" aka tolerable when no one is around but the wait staff and kitchen cannot handle a half full restaurant. I went with a group of 7 people and we were there for 4 hours waiting for our food, and the staff was not eager to fill our drink orders so a majority of the time was spent sipping water.When we did finally get our food after asking the waitress numerous times when it was coming, two orders were wrong and one order didnt come at all. Instead of the waitress jumping to fix the problem she told us it was the kitchens fault and there was nothing she could do about it. We eventually talked to the owner and she said they only have one fryer and thus can't handle when multiple large groups are in (when why do they have the seating for 75+ people in their place?). She comped the meals that were wrong but everyone else food was cold as it had been sitting so everything should have been comped.My gyro was basic and overpriced for what I got. Cold \"greek\" fries came with it. For people who say this is the \"best greek\" place in town, check yourself. This is basic greek food with poor service.Also, the building has terrible \u00a0acoustics \u00a0and it gets very loud very quickly. Like being in a weird art gallery where you can hear everything the next table is saying even if you are 5 feet away."], ["Brooke O.", "Very good food. Was a bit pricey for the portion size but they food was good."], ["Annie D.", "I've had two Greek dinners at Gardens of Salonica. The first time I ordered their leg of lamb special, which was really expensive (did not check the \"special\" price before ordering). It was also really, really good. And a ton of food.You get a salad or soup and pita bread with the entrees--by the time I get my meal I've been full already so I end up with leftovers (ha!... I would if I wasn't such a champ). Last week I ordered the moussaka (greek \"lasagna\"), which was yummy but not as tasty as that lamb from the first visit. The lesson is that eggplant will never be lamb. My BF ordered the cabbage rolls, which come stuffed with meat. It would have been a lot to handle as a meal (very rich). I need to learn to make that avgolemono sauce they were sitting in though. It's a traditional lemony-egg soup that they've turned into a sauce. It is so good I could cry. The baklava is also noteworthy but doesn't bring tears.We liked the 1/2 carafe option for house wine, since we didn't want a whole bottle.The service was phenomenal on Friday (it was slow the last time). They had a private party in the main dining room, so everyone was in the cafe side. Our table was right by the kitchen, which most people wouldn't have loved, but we got the best service we've had in a long time! The wait assistants filled up our water glasses before they were ever empty AND the server was friendly AND he brought out our food to the table right away (we could see it come up in the kitchen)."], ["Melissa L.", "Do not go here. I don't understand why people like it so much because it sucks.Pros: Interesting rock sculpture things outside.Cons: Weird layout. You walk into an empty room. There are chairs and tables, but no one there. Then you realize you have to walk across the room into another room where they actually serve food. Maybe it's an IQ test.Slow service. I know the slow food movement is gaining momentum, bu it took the server forever to get us menus, get us food, refill my water, and so on. I had to get up from my seat to let my server ask when my check was coming, after he told me ten minutes before he'd get it right away. And I am pretty patient. Have you even seen recreations of dinosaurs getting stuck in tar pits? Replace the dinosaurs with the servers and the tar pit with Gardens of Salonica.The food sucks. Everything was filled with a lot of raw garlic. I understand that garlic has healing properties or something, but you can't avoid OD'ing on raw garlic here. My stomach hated me for two days and even then, I could smell it coming off in waves from my skin. The gyros were ok, but nothing to rave about. I hate that I spent money here. I hate that I could have spent it on a box of Hot Pockets and enjoyed myself more."], ["Randall N.", "I love love love love love love love this place. Did I mention that I love it? Though I have never been to Greece I would have to think that is is about as authentic as it gets. For instance it has my favorite Greek dish: Mousaka. (Say it like the hyenas from Lion King say Mufasa and have some fun with it). You would think such a common greek dish would be easy to find in Greek/Mediterranean eateries but alas, this dish can be elusive. And if you do find it, it just tastes horrible. This place makes a KILLER Mousaka. The noodles are cooked just right. The seasoning is perfect. You taste different levels of seasoning including cinnamon and oregano without masking the flavor of the lamb. Also, bechamel sauce can be really overpowering or incredibly buttery or floury but this is neither of those things. Again it enhances the dish with it's creaminess but doesn't overpower. As you can tell I could go on and on about their Mousaka. But I won't. Their rice pudding...wonderful. The melitzana...great. Tzatziki...glorious. I've literally never had anything here that I didn't like. This is possibly my favorite place in the city. One of my favorite things about this place is that it's not tacky ethnic decor. It feels Mediterannean without shouting at you that it is. The woodwork is all light and airy. The art is funky but isn't a focal point in the room. I just love this place. It's great for a quiet, elegant dinner. Mmmmmm."], ["Terry N.", "What a great place. Went there last night and loved it. My food was great, and my server JJ was excellent.

They walked into It's Greek To Me and one of the girls exclaims how she misses her old job. She use to be a waitress at a Greek Restaurant back in South Bend, Indiana when she was going to school at Notre Lame..er Dame. She takes a big inhale and exhales slowly to contain the smell that triggers fond memories. \"This smells just like my restaurant\". she says while smiling. We all sit down and could not give the waitress another minute before we ordered. \"3 gyros please!\" \u00a0Their stomach growled louder and they contemplated ordering more... \"how big are these gyros\" they ask the waitress.The waitress puts her hand into a circle with about a 4 inch in area. Hmm, looks kinda small but they decided to order more if needed be. The gyro comes out in the nick of time and it is stacked so high with meat you could not even wrap the pita around it. \"OMG! That is a lot of meat\" one of the girls says. Another responds \"That's what she said\". After eating the meat on its own to bring it down to a size that the pita can wrap around, they stuffed their faces with the gyro until they could stuff no more! As they sit back and unbutton their jeans to make room for their protruding belly, they laugh, talk about the nostalgic old days and make more meat jokes into the night."], ["M K.", "The food is bland and not enough for the price. I had the chicken kabob and dolmates, and it was awful. Their desserts are not that great, but I loved the pomogranate cheesecake. The service is decent.

And the price is reasonable."], ["Randall N.", "Mmmmmm mousaka my favorite Greek dish. At least my favorite of all the ones I've had. Dolmades are a close second. I came here after a Yelp event was slacking on the food side. This is not my favorite Greek place but it was pretty damn good. The portions are huge. i got the platter that had mousaka, dolmades and a two other things whose names I cannot remember. The food was decent. Tasty but not uber delish like other places. Not sure if I would come again. I wouldn't choose to come here but if someone else wanted to I wouldn't say no. I do have to complement them on the size of their menu. they did have a lot of options and a lot of combinations to choose from. this is always my problem coming into an ethnic restaurant, wanting to try new things and wanting my staples and never being able to combine the two. Not here. The beer and liquor are also a bit steeep in the pricing. Go figure though....it's Uptown."], ["Russel M.", "This is my favorite restaurant I'm the Twin Cities.

Overall, not all that impressed."], ["Gina M.", "I'm just going to start off first by saying my favorite part of the meal at It's Greek to Me had to be the dessert. Don't get me wrong, everything else we had was SO GOOD, but seriously..You have to try the baklava (a traditional Greek pastry made with Filo Dough, and layered with walnuts, sugar, cinnamon, and honey). This was the first time I had actually tried it, after seeing it on the menu at a few other restaurants, and I fell in love. The boy and I shared a piece, and we literally lost our train of thought and stopped speaking after the first bite. It was cold, crunchy, sweet, deliciousness.Anyways. We walked in on a Sunday evening, and we got seated right away. The tables were pretty close to one another in our section where we were seated, and I had to do the awkward scoot-past-a-family-of-five-table-and-accidentally-bump-into-the-grandma's-chair maneuver, but oh well, that happens sometimes.We had the sweetest waitress, who we're not sure if she was just new or nervous, but was seriously adorable. She spilled our wine and bumped into chairs, and mentioned she didn't speak Greek at all so she butchers the names of things as well, but I kind of liked that - Hey, we're all human, right? We thought she was absolutely a great server :) We ordered two glasses of the white wine that they had on special for the evening, and they arrived filled to the brim in tiny little tumblers. I thought it was actually quite fitting for the restaurant (even though I do love a big glass of wine with my meal, sometimes it's not entirely a necessity). For the appetizer, we had the Tzatziki - in my opinion, you can't go wrong with ordering this. Their traditional recipe was absolutely delicious: Homemade yogurt, fresh garlic, cucumber, dill, and other seasonings, all served with piping hot pita bread. It was incredibly tangy, almost to the point of spiciness, but it was seriously tasty. For the entrees, I ordered the Chicken Gyro Sandwich, and the boyfriend ordered the Vegetarian Mousaka. There honestly was nothing special about the Chicken Gyro, but it just really hit the spot. The chicken was cooked well, it had a TON of onions on it, and was served on warm pita bread. It also comes with a side of the Tzatziki sauce to drizzle with. The Mousaka, on the other hand, was really good. It's basically a Greek version of veggie lasagna - Eggplant, \u00a0zucchini and potatoes, layered with onions, peppers, and a handful of other veggies and spices. The cheese they used in it was phenomenal. I just couldn't tell you what it was. It was creamy and fluffy, and melted in your mouth.And then.. the Baklava. I've already said all I can say about it. I just highly recommend ordering it before you leave. And, if you are like us and over-stuffed yourselves at this restaurant, just order one piece and split it amongst two people. It's incredibly possible to eat one piece on your own, but save yourself the full-stomach pains and share :)*As a side note, a few months ago I attended a benefit for the Whitter Alliance, and It's Greek to Me was there serving up samples. I'd also recommend ordering their traditional Greek Salad, especially in the summer months when you want something fresh to cool you down. A normally bland salad of lettuce, tomatoes, and onions is transformed when mixed with Greek olives, peppers, and Feta cheese. It's full of flavor, and the perfect accompaniment to a hot or warm entree.Also, there is a parking lot right next to Fuji-Ya - you can park here if you can't find parking along the streets. It's only $1.00/hour, and it doesn't really matter where you're going in the area, either, as it's just a pay lot. So if you're not up for driving around the LynLake area looking for a spot to squeeze your car into, definitely park here."], ["Jesse D.", "It's Greek to Me has good food, decent service and fairly good prices.

The spicy red pepper feta spread (htipiti) is delicious, especially dipped with tomatoes. My favorite hot appetizer is by far the Shrimp Saganaki. You get six shrimp in a mustard-wine sauce with bell peppers, topped with feta cheese. It's sooooo savory and has a very unique flavor. You won't be disappointed!Vegan* Lentil soup is hearty and filling. * Village salad without feta. They make their own salad dressing and it's amazing.* Skordalia seems thick and creamy, but made with blended potatoes, garlic and lemon. *The vegetarian stuffed red peppers really aren't that great, but try the stuffed eggplant sans cheese. *Try vegetarian dolmades in place of regular ones, and have them top them with red sauce.*BEWARE vegetarians and make sure you order the pita \"dry,\" because it's lightly spread with grease otherwise for flavor.Low carb* Gyros contains some wheat, so steer clear. * Saganaki has flour coating on it so request it without.* Try the spicy feta spread appetizer and request tomatos and cucumber slices instead of pita. It'll cost a little extra but its awesome, a fast appetizer, and you won't have to feel guilty.* Any of the meat meals come with a side. There are green beans in a tomato sauce that contain a little sugar, but they're well worth it.Seafood lover* They serve fresh fish daily. I recommend the halibut. All filets are broiled and finished with olive oil, lemon and spices. * Shrimp ekati is creamy and substantial.* Browse the daily specials for the broiled octopus. If they have it, it's a real treat!Dessert* If you see a little \"chocolate pyramid\" in the case, go for that. it's a pyramid made out of chocolate mousse and has a raspberry cream center.* galacatobouriko - hard to say, but it's awesome. It's a custard rolled in filo dough and baked. It's syrupy and sweet, and the servers warm it up a little bit.Hope you enjoy your experience! Make sure you you reserve a table on the patio if you can. It's gorgeous!"]], "Shish Mediterranean Grill & Caf\u00e9": []}
