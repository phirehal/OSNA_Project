Hilarious! Lately, the howling cold has made my face permanently look like --_--, and I've depended on my happy lamp a bit too much. But, I've also been incredibly hungry and have lived by one phrase the Marines say (according to my brother): \"Mind over matter. If you don't mind, it doesn't matter.\" lol. Screw you Old Man Winter!My boo and I went for a date Friday night. We spent a considerable amount of time fighting -9 degree weather, and ended up seeking foodie refuge at Origami Uptown. I have to say, my overall experience there was totally awesome. Beginning with the service, could it be better? With our teeth clattering and our faces pale, the first thing our server gave each of us a hot towel to warm up. How considerate! While defrosting, we ordered the sushi deluxe (consisting of an assortment of ten different kinds of seafood on rice). If that wasn't enough, we also got two rolls: a Shrimp Tempera and a Caterpillar.Given that I live in Minnesota, I'm pleased with the quality of sushi there. Everything is fresh (as can be), and doesn't smell old. I particularly enjoyed the tuna and mackerel nigiri. The Shrimp Tempera is yummy^2 and the Caterpillar Roll is avocado goodness -in the shape of ....... a caterpillar- with octopus for eyes. Oh, and we got pretty warm drinking the generous sized flask of drunkety funkety saki. It made our post-meal scamper to our car more bearable than the one to Origami Uptown.When I thought our meal finished, the chef -who has been with the same restaurant for about 17 years, wears a badass sushi bandana and a party tie- gave us a free dessert. My God, the dessert came with Pocky Sticks! LOL! #asiangrocerystores. #childhood.

We ended sharing a beef donburi (basically beef bowl), hamachi roll, salmon and avocado roll and a spicy crab roll. The beef bowl was average although I wasn't a fan of the pickled ginger which was salty when I expected it to be sweet. I liked the hamachi and salmon rolls by themselves (that is without my usual wasabi and soy sauce). These rolls were light but the fish were mildly underwhelming compared to some other sushi joints. The spicy crab roll tasted just like a standard California roll so nothing too special there but a safe choice. Overall I thought the food was good but I am not compelled to say it is a place I must return. The prices for happy hour were pretty reasonable (~$8 for beef bowl, $5.5 for each of the salmon and hamachi rolls, and $6.50 spicy crab roll).In terms of service, our waitress was pretty attentive and nice. We sat outside as their indoor seating was stuffy and humid (didn't seem their air conditioning worked or existed). Decent happy hour experience overall."], ["Elizabeth R.", "The staff really sold this place. The bartenders are knowledgable about the food and the varieties of sake available, and offered me some sake to try based on my preferences. I would say it's not the best sushi I've had, and I was especially bored by the tuna options. The nigiri and sashimi were pretty standard, but the spicy tuna roll was lopsided. Some pieces barely had any tuna, while the other end was overflowing with tuna. The special the night I was there of flounder was the highlight. I had five pieces of flounder nigiri and would have had more if I hadn't filled up on the tuna earlier."], ["Bruce K.", "Met my friend (and his dog) here for a good bunch of sushi.

We were pleased to find that on Sundays it's all day happy hour, so we were able to partake in some of the beer and sushi specials. While many of the items were discounted on the Happy Hour menu, we did locate a few items that were the same price on the regular menu and the Happy Hour menu (generally the more expensive toro and such). I guess that's buyer beware -- we generally order what we feel like eating if we are splurging on sushi. But just a note to look out for if you are eating on a budget.More than anything we were super delighted with the service (shout out to our server, Dana). He was attentive and thoughtful, made good suggestions and went the extra mile. He asked our preference for timing the different items we ordered, and he never let our glasses run empty. He even treated us to dessert when we mentioned we were celebrating our anniversary. In all, it made for a lovely evening out and really top-notch sushi."], ["Anya C.", "I ordered from BiteSquid as to go Una-Ju and Tako Sansai.

Now going alone to happy hour is already slightly strange, but walking into an empty restaurant didn't help. It was 5pm on a Thursday before the holidays, so maybe that had something to do with it or people get off work later. However, the bartender was cheery, talkative but not overbearing, and helpful, making me feel comfortable. I had the Morimoto beer, which wasn't on happy hour, but my first love in life was Iron Chef, the original and newer one, so I had to have a beer that Chef Morimoto helped craft, specifically to go with sushi. The happy hour menu is large enough for me, but apparently they are adding a lot more options most likely to draw people in. I can only assume this will happen after the new year, so make sure to check it out, I know I will! There are plenty of appetizers between $4-$8 and same prices for wine, beer, sake, and cocktails. I was very pleased with my $5 salmon roll, very fresh, with perfect rice, and 8 pieces. I didn't try anything else, but there is a check in special that I discovered as I was about to leave! I am excited to go back and try more!"], ["Kashmir S.", "Late Night Sushi Happy Hour. Count me in. One of my go to sushi spots in the twin cities has just made me a bigger fan of theirs. Now that they have relocated to the Uptown area they are doing late night HH and to top it off they have plenty more options on the menu (HH) then the location downtown so that's a win in my book. Plus, since Yelp is the cool kid on the block with every check in they give you a free appetizer (edamame, ebi shumai or gyoza). The sushi is still amazing and fresh. This place has yet to disappoint me, whether it is with their sushi, the variety, friendly staff and reasonable prices.During this visit we decided to sit at the sushi bar, which was a good decision since we were provided with something to nibble on from the sushi chef prior to ordering our food. Our waitress was very attentive and all of the food that was ordered came out rather quickly, which is a good thing. The new space that they are in has a great d\u00e9cor and there seems to be plenty of seating options as there is a 2nd floor, not sure if that's for bigger groups or not. The only downside to the set-up of the new space is the fact that the bar area is located right next to the door so every time the door opens on those cold winter days you might feel the cold draft.

Once you place your order, a waiter comes over to get you anything you need (usually). On the most recent visit, I had to flag somebody down to get waters after waiting 15 minutes. It's worth noting that at least half the tables were empty too.It was like pulling teeth to get a paper receipt (needed for expenses) from the waiter. I had previously been here and another waiter had asked us if he could get them for us, so I thought it was a common request.I ordered the miso soup and a California roll, but the miso soup was SO salty that I ended up only eating half of it. I would have sent it back, but the waiter never showed his face at our table after delivering the waters (food brought out by food runners).Additionally, I happened to be sitting with a co-worker at a table for two and our dinners came out at least 10 minutes apart (about a twenty five minute wait total for her food). Again, hard to understand since the restaurant wasn't even full.The sushi was quite good and the food I've gotten in the past has also been quite tasty.

You got the usual Mc Donald's that's overpriced but tastes extra gross. Somehow they manage to make soggy fries, just because it's in an airport. Panda Express always has the mushy orange chicken. \u00a0It's like airports are really talented at serving crap food no matter what chain it is. This airport seemed to have quite a variety of foods. Nice job. Love the iPads everywhere, and the super semi complicated but high tech system of ordering foods via the iPad even when you're actually SITTING DOWN INSIDE of the restaurant. I found that a bit weird, but I get it. You guys are a hub, and you want to be cool. Pork ramen- 4 stars. \u00a04 stars for an airport? Well, when expectations are low, \u00a0you can't help but to be a bit impressed. IT was actually not bad at all. The broth was clean, simple, and flavorful. Not the best ramen I've ever had, but good. Sadly, went to eat here again on our return flight, and this same dish went down to a \u00a02.5 stars for me. Broth was not as good, was just plain salty, and MEH. Hence, perhaps there are different reviews and ratings at this place, depending upon who's the chef? Thai fried rice with egg on top- 4 stars. NOT BAD AT ALLLL. This dish was actually good, I mean like if it WASN'T at the airport, I still woulda given it a 4 stars. Nice flavor. Serving was ridiculously huge, we couldn't even finish it. Tantan men- 2 stars. MEhhhhhhhhh. We ordered this on our return flight, and again, maybe the chef was different because it was really weird. The broth was super thick, and the noodles were almost hard and mushy in a weird way. Somehow the starch in the noodles and broth weren't mixing too well, and it just didn't taste right. I wondered if they threw in corn starch to thicken the soup, hence this weird situation was going on. Not that great at all. Good luck, fellas.

Two pieces for $8 - hamachi. I ordered 'times two', because two pieces surely wouldn't be enough.Tiny, tiny pieces of hamachi. The flavor was okay, but it wasn't super fresh. I'd say, what would one expect from sashimi in an airport? but hey... it's a restaurant that serves sashimi. There's no reason it shouldn't be fresh; that is their business.Don't get me wrong, it wasn't nasty. It was okay and it was tiny. Did I mention it was tiny? It was tiny.

I'll try another place instead.Also, the service is just so bad. First of all, the place looks like eatery from a dystopian future where people all have a screen in front of their faces, a la Wall-E, and no one actually interacts with other humans. Oh wait, that's not a dystopian future...that's reality today. I digress. \u00a0Anyway, since you order and pay (and tip!) from an iPad before a human ever even looks at you, the service is extraordinarily bad. Sushi comes to your table 15 seconds before your ramen arrives. When you ask the server to bring you water, he asks if you ordered any. You say yes, and he scurried off with a confused look. Then another server comes with your water several minutes after your food has arrived, and the original server who is returning to your table with water looks even more confused. Sheesh. Now that you finally have your water, you have to deal with your entire meal which didn't come out in courses, but is sitting in a jumble in front of you. You don't know whether to eat the ramen now since it will get cold if you don't, or if you want to wolf down the sushi so you can move onto ramen before it cools. What a mess.

Around the corner from the Delta TSA check point, you'll see this modern space. there are booth and table top seating and a window to watch them make homemade noodles. The dark tiling and ipad ordering systems on the table really created that modern vibe. Yes, I said it. There are ipads on each table! You browse through their inventory menu, swipe your card and a server will be at your table shortly to bring your food. So cool!For lunch I got the Tokyo style Pork Ramen for $13. This ramen was filled with shredded pork, hard boiled eggs, bamboo shoots, greens and seaweed. Lots of different flavors and textures. The pork had a smokey flavor to it and the ramen was of course, amazing! The broth had a really nice flavor to it as well, however, my only gripe about it was it was too oily. I think it's from the pork but not really a fan of that. Listen, make no mistake. This is a fantastic space for a meal before your flight.

So I was excited to find out from Yelp that this place offers both soba and sushi, which are two of my favorites!The automated ordering on the iPads was cool at first but then seemed more gimmicky than practical. On multiple occasions, I tried to call a waiter over using the option on the iPad and waited long stretches of time before finally having to wave a waiter over. It was nice at first that the iPad would help you to track your flight, but I found that after I ordered and was waiting for my food, the iPad would constantly time out and I would have to re-enter my flight info to check for updates.I ordered the wild mushroom soba (shiitake, enoki, and spinach) for $12.00. Since I'm vegan, I opted out of the tamagoyaki (grilled egg), which normally comes with it. But especially since I opted out of one of the add-ons, I was surprised to find the vegetarian mushroom broth substitute would still cost an extra $1.50.I was also surprised at how limited the sushi offerings were; the only vegetarian option was a cucumber roll, and it was more expensive than usual. I had to ask a waiter if avocado could be added, and he told me there would be an extra charge. I ordered two cucumber-avocado rolls to-go, since my flight was boarding soon.The soba ended up being incredibly bland, almost like the noodles were sitting in water rather than broth. I did enjoy all of the toppings, but even worse than the \u00a0blandness of the noodles was eating the tofu without any sort of flavoring.The avocado-cucumber rolls I ate mid-flight. Considering that these hand rolls are pretty simple and should be very basic for a sushi chef to make, I was surprised to find that the cucumber in the roll was literally a slab and not the usual julienned version. I felt like each bite of sushi was almost a little interrupted trying to get around the solid chunk of cucumber.The only highlight of this meal was that the manager wasn't present, and they couldn't charge me extra for the added avocado. I did appreciate that the avocado was on the house.The cost of the soba plus two cucumber rolls with tax ended up coming out to around $26.

And their ingredients seem fresh enough, which I suppose should be the most important thing with sushi. However, other reviewers say the rolls are \"skillfully assembled\" and I have to disagree.I've tried their sushi rolls a handful of times (I really /want/ to like their rolls) but have been disappointed each time. My biggest issues with their rolls is that 1) they are not rolled tightly and 2) they are assembled/rolled/cut lengthwise instead of widthwise. Accordingly, when cut into 8 pieces, the rolls end up being enormous. A sushi roll should be small enough to be eaten in one bite, and should not make the eater cower behind her desk so that coworkers don't scoff at her inability to close her mouth when chewing.I cannot recommend this place for their rolls.

The food was great, and we got two rolls, a hotdog, the meatball appetizers and the suzuki. Everything was fantastic and had well matched flavors. The suzuki comes with lemon pieces on top and has strong citrus notes. It's very refreshing for a hot day. The potato salad on the hot dog was very creamy and light. It's closer to the mustard/mayo version rather than vinegar based, but it's not too rich given the amount you receive. I also highly recommend the appetizers. They were out of the mushrooms so we got the meatballs and chicken. The meatballs were phenomenal. I don't know what seasoning they use but it's very flavorful.

I haven't had oshizushi in years, and I felt any place that had oshizushi on the menu must know something about Japanese food. I wasn't disappointed.So much to love about this place. Sustainable seafood. Authentic menu. Hot towels. A cute name (\"catch,\" as in catching a baseball and perhaps catching a fish). Artwork andauthentic Japanese baseball memorabilia that evoke the name. As I scanned the menu, I made a mental note of what I would try next time (ramen, donburi, tonjiru pork stew...and it goes on). We ordered the mackerel and sea bass oshizushi, salmon skin salad, and nukazuke pickles. The oshizushi was wonderful, as promised. When the server asked me if it was as good as what I had five years ago, I had to qualify my answer that last time I was close to the ocean. (On the bullet train headed to Shizuoka, in fact.) But in any case, very good. I thought they fell down a bit on the salmon skin salad and the nukazuke, though. The salmon skin salad dressing was wonderful, but the salmon skin itself seemed to need salt (perhaps purple shiso salt!). The nukazuke pickles tasted like they hadn't been pickling for a week, but since I don't like super strong pickles that's not a bad thing. Several reviews compared Kyatchi unfavorably with certain other restaurants, on the grounds that the prices are too high. Having been to many other sushi joints in the Twin Cities and having lived in Japan for six years, I would say that Kyatchi stands head and shoulders over the vast majority of the other Japanese restaurants in the area in terms of authenticity, food quality, and overall experience.

Looked fresh, nicely designed. Food was actually reasonably priced. However, what came out was slightly different than expected.Best example was the sake oshizushi. Salmon, fish eggs, slice of lemon. Cool. Unfortunately, when it came out, the ratio of rice to salmon was way off. It was a thin slice of salmon and then topped with a lemon slice.

It could work if it was in a better location but people won't come out just the food is sourced well.Good luck to Kyatchi, I do hope they figure out the right balance."], ["Kee S.", "This is a great place to eat some sushi or try something a little more fusion. \u00a0 The dogs are great and the staff is friendly and helpful. \u00a0Prices are decent and they focus on sustainable fish and local meat products. \u00a0Don't miss out on this place. \u00a0Kyatchi, roughly translated, means catch. \u00a0The decor is playful with the word. \u00a0Decorated with Japanese baseball jerseys and Japanese art of different fish. \u00a0It's a fun, relaxed atmosphere."], ["D B.", "Food was not good on our visit. \u00a0We left hungry and unsatisfied and finished our dinner at Blackbird down the street.Staff a bit disorganized, hostess bored.We prefer Obento-ya."], ["Brea E.", "First time being here and loved everything about, very reasonable price...coming back here"], ["Ian W.", "Though I have been a faithful sushi goer at another establishment I decided to get out and try something new. \u00a0Kyatchi was a great place, great ambience, perfect for a winter night. \u00a0They have great nigiri, and my wife thought it as the best nigiri she has had in MPLS. \u00a0The tap beers were great, good selection, some different selections from the usual as well. \u00a0We also had some miso soup which was good, kind of like my own better but the sushi roll we had was great. \u00a0It was the special and had a unique and great flavor, we loved it! \u00a0I will definitely be back to try our the hot dogs and their entrees!"], ["Azlan M.", "Love their ramen and agedashi tofu.

But the menu descriptions left me in the dark which was frustrating. Kyatchi makes a claim to authenticity, so the hot dog menu had me scratching my head - even if it's good, it's not what I came for! That being said, the Sake Oshizushi was delicious, as was the Kanpyo. The Tamago was interesting and I enjoyed it, but it was not something I'm accustomed to. Warn people about the Ume Shiso because it's hit or miss (I liked it). The sorbet, cantaloupe lime, was the highlight of the evening. I miss the black sesame pudding!Kyatchi has the potential to beat out the sushi restaurant competition by being less commercial and more relaxed, with an almost caf\u00e9-feel. I appreciate the authenticity but it's not consistent throughout the menu and I wasn't always sure what I was getting."], ["Mallory K.", "I absolutely love this place, it is a total hidden gem! The sake oshizushi is hands-down the best sushi I've had since I lived in Tokyo, and the lemon garnish is really refreshing. I'm also a big fan of the hotdogs.

The service has always been very prompt and nice. The sushi rolls are reasonably priced and really good. Great beer list as well. I would recommend Kyatchi."], ["Kimi H.", "Kyatchi is not your average Japanese/sushi place, and I mean that in the best possible way. Husband and I just came back from eating here, and it was so good I was compelled to immediately gush about it in on Yelp. When I say it's not your average sushi place, I mean don't expect to find a menu full of specialty rolls and overpriced cocktails. In fact, the sushi roll portion of the menu is small - maybe eight items. And not a spicy tuna roll in sight (which was a bummer at first because I love me some spicy tuna rolls). Because of this I'll admit we were a bit taken aback when we first sat down with the menu. While there was no gyoza or wasabi shumai, there were...hot dogs? And something called 'pressed' sushi? What the heck? Unfortunately they were out of hot dogs, but that's okay because everything else we had was, for the most part, FANTASTIC.I'll start with the least impressive: the tofu salad. Yeah, I don't know what I was expecting; it's tofu, of course it was bland and weirdly textured, like tofu always is unless it is deep-fried into deliciousness, but the creamy sesame dressing was great and made it taste better/have any taste at all. The avocado rolls were AMAZING. I know you're thinking, \"Avocado rolls? Big deal.\" Well, I'm telling you they are a big deal. A delectable blend of the best sushi rice I've ever eaten, combined with a generous portion of perfectly ripe, perfectly creamy avocado. Lightly dipped in the (also fantastic) soy sauce, it is the best avocado roll you will ever have. EVER. (About the rice: it is phenomenal. SO many sushi places have such mediocre rice. Not Kyatchi. I have never tasted sushi rice this good. Each grain is plump and squishy, yet still textured enough to provide the perfect base.)In short: at $4 an order I can safely announce Kyatchi has the best, most valuable avocado roll in Mpls, if not in all of the land, and I plan on ordering it often. Pressed sushi with lemon and fish egg: DROOL. The salmon was SO fresh. The rice (as previously mentioned), SO good, and then it was topped off with a thin slice of lemon and a smattering of roe. Simple, but oh-so-tasty. I would warn that you should probably really like lemon if you want to order this dish, as it is very lemony, but I am obsessed with lemon so it was all good. Also, it is different than any sushi I've ever had in that it is sort of like nigiri, but pressed into a square, and in the menu it's lumped in with the rolls and not the nigiri/sashimi. Husband loved all his food, but he especially loved the chicken meatball skewer. We've already made plans to go back so he can try the chicken meatball entr\u00e9e. I, for one, can't wait to try everything on the menu!The service was fantastic, and everyone was so nice. \u00a0All the staff and servers seem super pumped about being open, and you can tell they really feel passionate about the food and location. Twice we were asked if we lived in Kingfield, so it's clear they're invested in the idea of being a neighborhood place. Tl;dr:Kyatchi is fantastic; the food is phenomenal, the service is great, and the prices are reasonable. I look forward to making it one of our neighborhood go-to spots for food and drinks!"], ["Shelly E.", "Great melt-in-your-mouth multi-flavor-layered food (\u304a\u3044\u3057\u3044!), the best service (Tim was very attentive, helpful and thorough) lovely atmosphere (and music!) ...

The service was outstanding, the sushi was good but the real standout were the hotdogs! Loved the dog with avocado and egg so much we ordered a second round. Tofu salad was very plain. Quality is high and you pay a premium for it."], ["Ben C.", "Been meaning to try this place for a while now and boy was it worth the wait. We went for happy hour and I can't wait to go back and try more of the sushi and other menu items ( I'm looking at you, ramen). The sushi is the standout item for sure. I am always super skeptical of sushi in the twin cities. Most of it seems to be those ridiculous dragon rolls covered with a million sauces and gigantic slices of avacado - GROSS. Thankfully that is not the case here. These minimalist flavor bombs have to be some of the best in the Cities, which probably has to do with the fact that kyatchi sources their ingredients from local fish farms and what not. You can read about it on their site and they also tell you when you order. All I know is that the fish had great texture and flavor. We had salmon, iwana(sp?) and mackerel nigiri and all three melted on our tongues each with their own unique flavor. Honestly, at times i actually wondered whether or not I truly enjoyed sushi because of instances around these parts where even salmon nigiri produced an urge to wretch. Case closed. I LOVE nigiri. Fack. So effing good. Apparently it's just been that long since I had quality stuff. Man, they were yummy. As for the other menu items, they were also tasty. The tomato skewers really stood out and so did the hitachino beer. Yum. The curry dog was ok. It's topped with a kraut that's flavored like Japanese curry. I was impressed that it tastes just like the curry Japanese and Koreans put on rice and fried pork cutlets, but it just wasn't all that great on a hotdog. Thats not to say it wasn't bad though, just not my fave. I still snarfed it :-) Overall, kyatchi was great. Tim, our server, was really attentive and nice as well. Place was a little cold this time of year but meh. Just warm up with some hot sake. Can't wait to try the other seafood items and gorge on the sushi now that I know it's awesome."], ["javad k.", "Great atmosphere and fresh sushi!"], ["Tony K.", "First time here and loved it!

We waited 25 min for our food and so the wait built up a lot excitement and anticipation for the food. I guess the first bite didn't blow us away as expected. We ordered the square sushi roll with sake and lemon slices, but the lemon was a bit overpowering. We also had the sake and hamachi sashimi which tasted fresh. The avocado and egg hot dog was ok but maybe was missing a sweeter ingredient to pull it together. The momo and beef skewers with yakitori sauce were a bit bland actually. The owner and waiters were really nice though."], ["Bridget L.", "I have been eagerly waiting Kyatchi's opening as I walked by and saw their \u00a0\"sustainable sushi coming soon\" sign. \u00a0To explain my excitement, I love me some sushi but I've watched enough nature films and documentaries to make me stay away or feel horribly guilty for eating sushi.We went in on their opening night, by accident mind you, and were greeted right away by the owner who was extremely friendly and such a gracious host. \u00a0It has a great local, community feel to the restaurant. \u00a0There were three of us total and we wanted to try as much as we could from the menu and I can honestly report that it was all amazing! \u00a0Our server was very helpful and answered all our oddball questions.My absolute favorite was the sake (salmon) sashimi with the hotate (scallops) sashimi following as a close second. \u00a0We tried a few different rolls which were also all delicious. \u00a0Another member inch my party favored the Big Roll above all else. \u00a0The shiitake mushroom and the pork belly skewers were melt in your mouth goodness. \u00a0We also had the house hot sake which was a nice addition to the meal. \u00a0We ended it with the black sesame butterscotch dessert and while I don't like butterscotch, I love blacks sesame and that dessert did not disappoint. \u00a0It inspired me to try to find some black sesame dessert recipes to try on my own.The price is a little higher but not by much and as cheap as I am, which is pretty cheap, I'm willing to pay it to feel good that I'm not completely destroying vast amounts of ocean creatures just so I can have sushi. \u00a0I'd also like to note that unlike some sustainable restaurants that raise the prices of everything on the menu, Kyatchi's menu was very reasonably priced in areas where the sustainability factor didn't come into play (i.e. drinks, desserts, soups, etc.)I had waited so long for them to open and even with such high expectations, I was still blown away by the quality of food and the friendly feel of the place. \u00a0I will definitely be back!"], ["John W.", "Quiet on an early Sunday evening. \u00a0Daily happy hour from 4-6 includes $2 off draft list, which has a lot of good local beers. \u00a0Started with some gyoza, very fresh noodle and good filling, nice subtly citrusy soy dipping sauce. \u00a0Mackeral with sea salt was crispy and delicious. \u00a0Avacado roll and daikon rolls were nice veggie options. \u00a0Other foods ordered at the table were chefs choice, which would be great for die hard sushi fans."], ["Zorah J.", "First things first this is a strictly dinner establishment, which I didn't know the first time I tried to go.

They definitely have a simple theme when it comes to their food which I liked. We tried some the guy tataki, rolls, some nigiri and I had the ramen. The tataki was good.

Most sushi place I go to the soup are pretty much just warm. Had the squid salad to share and that was nice and flavorful. Definitely would order again. Also order the shrimp and vegetable tempura off happy hour. It was really good. I usually just get just vegetable tempura at most places. A lot of time the shrimp would come out too soft so it's not my go to app but I decided to try theirs. Their shrimp tempura were so flaky and had such a nice crunch to them. And their tempura sauce was also flavorful but light if that makes sense. We had some nigiri and sashimi. They were nice as well! I like how it was nicely cut. And not so thin or too thick. It was just right. For the nigiri it was perfect amount of rice. Our server was very attentive. Always gave us refill on our water once he saw it was empty. And cleaned empty plates promptly.

Where to eat? Shall we venture into Minneapolis or stay local? Shall we do Mexican, Chinese, American, or Fancy? Of course, we consulted the wonderfullness of Yelp and found that a new sushi place in our Edina neighborhood opened up. Even better, Happy Hour was 8pm til close and I am always down for happy hour sushi.Nakamori is located on in a strip mall off of France Ave. When we went, there were only a couple of tables of people, but there appeared to be ample seating for any high times. It had really cute decor, modern, and was generally a nice place to eat. Our server was very attentive and friendly. Their happy hour menu had plenty of variety $3 tap drinks, $1 apps, $4 salads, and sushi rolls ranging from $4-$10. These included specialty rolls. The seaweed salad: This made me feel less guilty about eating sushi and skipping my fiber portions. I've never had seaweed salad, so had nothing to compare it to, but it had a nice crunchy texture and was lathered in a sesame seed oil and vinegar dressing that was slightly sweet. For $4, I can have this salad to accompany my many sushi rolls and not feel terrible about eating out. The sushi: I ordered the Spicy Girl and the Winter Roll. Winter Roll was awesome hands down. Spicy Girl was good, I just didn't expect the fish to be ground up and rolled in the rice. I judge the sushi by the freshness of the fish and the creativity around the flavors and textures that are brought together by the ingredients. The Winter Roll embodied this meeting of flavors and textures really well. I look forward to trying other rolls with a bit more crunch to complement the winter roll. Tempura ice cream: there are many flavors such as mango, green tea, red bean, vanilla. We went with vanilla this time and it was okay. I have had the tempura much crunchier at other sushi/hibachi places, and unfortunately this was the disappointment of the meal. I am hoping that this was a fluke, because I would really like to try the red bean next time I am there!As far as non sushi food goes, my husband enjoyed his hibachi chicken that was accompanied with soup, salad, noodles, vegetables, and shrimp. He opted to add extra fried rice for $3. Chicken was flavorful and moist, vegetables were perfectly stirfried and most of all the fried rice was not wet and nasty, but a delicious blend of egg, oil, and rice. Yes, we have eaten at places that screw up fried rice, and we were glad this place was not one of them.

The friendliest and most attentive service I've experienced in ages. Furniture and decor sure to attract a hip yuppie crowd. Flat screen TVs for the ESPN and CNN sets. I sure wish the food matched the rest of the experience.Like many other sushi joints in the area, this place will probably satisfy 90% of the likely patrons. But if you actually care about Japanese food, you will be disappointed. The salad dressing tasted suspiciously like the dressing you get in a Big Mac, with some grated ginger and radish mixed in. The miso soup was not bad, but also not authentic. I strongly suspect they simply added miso to the clear onion soup they serve with the bistro entrees. My husband's sushi roll, wrapped in a bright pink soy or rice paper, was a tasty tempura lobster/crab creation, but the crunch and spice overwhelmed what real sushi should be about: the rice. I couldn't taste whether or not it was real sushi rice. My salmon teriyaki entree was not bad. The first bite was very tender, but the salmon got drier towards the center. Generous helping of two salmon slabs over a stir fry of onion and asparagus. The rice was a little dry. We stopped by because it was close to the movie theater and we had a coupon. Hubby will probably get lunch here because it's close to his work, but I won't be going back. For the same money, I can get more authentic and better tasting Japanese food closer to my house. Come on, guys! A little more effort in the right places will go a long way. You don't need 30+ different kinds of sushi rolls to impress. Start with eight rolls that you do really well, and work to perfect the basics. You can probably lift better dressing and miso soup recipes from Epicurious.

Both times, I ordered the Nabeyaki Udon. Oh, so delicious! As a reminder, a 15% gratuity is automatically added to each and every bill.

If you like seafood and fried food, this place rocks.The service is superb, punctual, attentive, friendly and on par with traditional Japanese culture. The decor is simple but reflects the menu's simplicity quite well. It's a no frills noodle shop with fixings that glam it up without adding in attitude. They have specials representative of the season's offerings. Plenty to drink for those who prefer alcohol or tea.Prices are fair. Food is fresh, well-presented and seasoned adeptly.However, it may be a bit salty for my taste. I also was not in the mood for noodles, thus the dilemma in writing a review. I feel that there should be a few more offerings in the appetizer section other than a salad and spinach that are vegan. The miso soup and kimchi are not vegan. The agedashi tofu is definitely not vegan. There is traditional fish broth all over the place in tofu dishes and veg dishes, so just let them know you are vegan to be safe.I appreciate that they have mushroom broth, but it costs extra...... Doesn't seem fair, but then if someone seeking vegan noodle soup had a choice, this is an unlikely first choice.You won't starve as a vegan, but if you are a gluten free vegan, watch out!"], ["Jessica B.", "I wish I could give this place 10 stars.

Good price for a sit down restaurant and the tip is included in the total bill!"], ["Rowena N.", "My friend came from Rochester after some intense interviewing, so we thought we would grab some food and relax. After 3 minutes of serious yelping, we decided on Tanpopo.The restaurant was seriously empty when we came (around 6pm on a Friday). Servers immediately seated us. but here's the breakdown:Food: - Sushi rolls are meh. We had the special salmon and avocado roll which came out in less than 2 minutes that we ordered it. (Seriously the server walked over with our slip and walked back with a roll). Immediately, we sighed because likely the roll wasn't made fresh....and it wasn't. Rice was harder and drier than typical sushi rice should be. The salmon was okay, but the cut/quality seemed like it was a bit old (and chewy). + We got the dashi tofu and that was much better. I would recommend this one. The tofu was silky and the green onion and dashi on top reminded gave it extra flavor. The sauce looked like soy sauce but was a bit sweeter rather than salty. Overall, I would get this again. I actually wish we ordered two rather than the sushi roll. (sigh again)+ Nabeyaki udon: My friend ordered this one. The soup base tasted same as mine below but typically most ramen/udon places have only one or two bases and I am not surprised. The tempura and other seafood in there was pretty solid and flavorful. Udon noodles were soft but not overcooked. She enjoyed it and I enjoyed stealing bites.+ Beef udon: I love love love love beef udon. In San Francisco, I almost always opt for this. The hard part is always for them to get the soup right, and not overcook the beef in the process. Tanpopo met my needs! Their beef udon was perfect. The beef slices were still tender and moist when it arrived. The soup was as expected, just seasoned correctly and not watered down. Noodles were soft but not overcooked. Overall I'd say between 3.5 to 4 stars for food.Service:- Although there were plenty of empty tables, the server kept coming back every 5 minutes to ask how we are doing. The first few times were nice because we thought she was attentive, the last 10 times were annoying because we felt pressured to go when a quarter of the shop was still empty. Literally I finished my last bite of my food and she grabbed my bowl so my friend felt rushed to eat hers. Then she did the same thing within few minutes after she's done and dropped our bill. It would be nice not to feel like we are entering a revolving door restaurant ma'am.- This was entirely my fault but I did not check the receipt and didn't know they automatically charge 15% for tip. I probably would have given around the same amount, but being asian we battled for the receipt and I came out victorious. Or not, because I end up putting tip on the receipt not knowing they already charged it. So, I would say it is my fault, but I also feel restaurants who do that (when it is not a group of customers) are just insecure.Overall, service received was off and slightly uncomfortable, so I'd give it about a 2.Parking: + Park to the lot next to the building (if you go further almost under the bridge. It is a prepay lot and at night (past 4pm) it is only $1.Overall, I thought the food was alright. I am not entirely sure if i would return given the food did not exceed my expectations so much, to offset the awkwardness in service. But good try."], ["Karyn P.", "Ok gave this place another try and glad I did. Had the pork dumplings and all I can say is wow I could've eaten a ton of those.

We were surprised by the hipstery vibe of the place in person. The food was carefully prepared, but we aren't likely to return because of the service and the challenge and expense of parking. I'm all for paying waitstaff a living wage, so I don't have a problem with an automatic gratuity, but the service we got was pretty terrible. It was really slow and our (incredibly young-looking) hostess/waitress lacked professionalism and courtesy."], ["Colleen B.", "Simple atmosphere, simple menu options and simply great food without a ton of trendy frills. This small noodle shop makes me feel like I'm at home. I've never been disappointed by anything I've tried here and the recipes and flavor combinations are authentically Japanese -- which isn't something you can always say in the middle of the U.S. If you're expecting a lot of overpowering spice and convoluted sauces you will be disappointed since this authentic Japanese food is about subtlety and beauty on many levels. So as long as you're in the proper mindset when you go, you'll be very happy. One tip: I enjoy going here for a weekday lunch more than for dinner since it's usually much less crowded."], ["Ken P.", "Food is really high quality and even amazing. Wait staff does their best but they are so understaffed that service takes forever. You have to be patient when going to Tampopo.

Perfect place to go on a cold winter night - awesome noodles, and they reminded me of the udon noodles that I had while in Japan.I've seen some previous complaints about service, but when we came here with our Twin Cities Supper Club, it was decent. We had a waitress in training, and she was slow, but hey, it was likely her first week.

I have had crunchy rolls from almost all of them and I have never had a crunchy roll like this one. This isn't a compliment. It wasn't very good. It didn't have any type of flavor or taste that I would normally enjoy in a sushi roll and I was very disappointed.Next up: 9 Weeks Of Summer (or something like that!). So this one was about a half step above the crunchy roll. It did have avocado and unagi and shrimp as well, but there wasn't really too much flavor.

The seaweed salad was close to authentic, with colorful American garnish, and the sweet potato tempura (billed as \"sweet potato fried\" on the menu) was served french fries style, with a ketchup-sized dish for the tempura sauce. I ordered the pink panther roll, which was a tasty soy paper-wrapped creation with spicy tuna, generous avocado, cucumber, peanuts, and mango salsa. There was not much rice, so I couldn't tell if they actually put vinegar in the rice for real sushi rice. The roll was a little mushy with the spicy tuna and avocado, but the cucumber and peanut made for a nice crunchy contrast. My companion ordered octopus and spicy scallop nigiri-zushi. We had a difficult time discerning the scallop, but it was still tasty. As is the case with most Midwestern sushi places, people who want authentic Japanese food should go elsewhere. A small handful of Japanese side dishes like miso soup bumps elbows with a dazzling array of East/Southeast Asian foods such as lo mein, Korean barbecue wings, and tom yum soup. For me, the selling point is the sincerity and local flavor of the place. It's not a slick corporate restaurant joint with mango cocktails. I'll probably go back to try the cooked \"house favorite\" dishes.Update: A year later, Sakana seems to have slid downhill, so I've changed my rating to two stars. We took some friends here over the summer, and I was embarrassed that there were fruit flies all around us. Today I ordered takeout.They messed up my order because the person who took my order hadn't been there long enough to know that what I ordered was no longer on the menu and didn't call me back. I ended up waiting 20 additional minutes for takeout. The food itself was a bit disappointing. My mango shrimp was billed as \"spicy,\" but it was a very ordinary sweet stir-fry with a watery sauce. The kung pao beef was overdone, perhaps because they made the order and had it sit there while the replacement food was being made. I did want to see this place succeed, because at the very least the owners seem to know something about sake. The hostess was also kind enough to give me a discount on the food. But enough is enough. I tossed my outdated takeout menu."], ["Stephanie S.", "Very good sushi. Highly recommend the salmon and scallops. Best quality scallops I've had in the twin cities.Very nicely decorated with good ambience. However, the music sounded very 80s, in a \"classy\" sort of way (think 80's elevator jazz). I dug it."], ["Alec W.", "We went here last night after it turned out Highland Grill was a little overcrowded. I'm really glad we did, because we got some fantastic tasting sushi.We were immediately welcomed in and felt right at home. The only sign that this is a former KFC is the takeout window in the corner of the restaurant. Other than that, they did a fantastic job of re-doing the place.We ordered a couple apps and some sushi. Again, the sushi was really tasty. Overall, I'd say it is above average sushi. The only part about it that wasn't great was the appearance. Some of pieces of the rolls were a little squished and deformed. Still, it's easy to overlook once you taste it.I was pleasantly surprised when they brought the check out. It was much less than I had originally thought.Sake menu was great, and again, the service was fantastic. We had a great time, and we'll be returning soon. Try it out, I don't think sushi fans will be disappointed."], ["Antonio G.", "I've had take out a couple more times from this place and it has impressed me! Sushi is very good by MN standards."], ["Chase D.", "Horrible service. We were never greeted and it took forever to get drinks although there were only 3 other families. \u00a0Once they found out we had a \"groupon\" we were treated badly. \u00a0I'm pretty sure they also served us less food also. \u00a0Sushi was good, but the service was very bad. \u00a0The entire staff, including the kitchen staff lounged around in street clothes, sagging pants, backwards hats and all. They were all at the bar talking loudly of their personal lives about 5 feet away from our table, and they watched us eat our mediocre food. \u00a0One of the waitresses decided to start actually doing something and got a bottle of some cleaner that smelled like ammonia and began cleaning menus; 5 feet away. \u00a0We could smell this cleaner as we ate. \u00a0Never going back."], ["Jonathan W.", "I agree with others that the service and protocol is seriously lacking. And also agree that the layout is really dumb. Overall the sushi was well done, but not for the purist. The service was disorganized and slow. But they HAVE to do something about the layout. The big dumb bar thing in the middle is really a bad idea. And sitting watching the staff stand there and chat with each other while I was waiting for service actually started to piss me off.First , when we walked in we felt like we came in the wrong door. Directly in front of us were 3 people who worked there but all avoided eye contact and chatted with each other. After a few moments of confusion a woman poked her head around the corner to the left and asked if we had a reservation. We said we didn't. She looked at her chart and said there was space available at the (uncomfortably low) sushi bar. We walked past many empty tables that she promised were reserved for another party. (the party never showed up and it would have been nice to be re-seated at a regular table, but the space was given to others) We sat and ordered from the friendly sushi chefs (though it was difficult to see what they were doing because we were so low). The sushi was fine. The service was late and disorganized. (after we were finished the waiter called up to the sushi chef \"Hey, what'd they have?\", but then went back to him behind the bar and asked again, didn't add to the experience.) Overall, meh. I might go back and order from their menu to find a favorite, but it may take a while to do. Maybe longer than I'm willing to invest. I'm more likely to walk down to Punch pizza where they do their one thing right."], ["Courtney J.", "I had been eyeing this place for a while and I'm very happy I've now tried it. \u00a0The menu has a very wide variety of dishes which I'm sure will satisfy a broad range of tastes. \u00a0I had the Japanese noodles with soba noodles and it was delicious. \u00a0It's a dish that I think even my midwesternfoodonly eating father might enjoy! \u00a0I also had the sweet potato tempura roll which was fantastic. \u00a0Since I'm a rare meat eater I tend to go vegetarian which I think some might find difficult as a sushi based restaurant, but I can vouch for this place that there is plenty on the menu for us veggies oriented diners.The ambiance is nice as well although similar to what Rhonda G mentioned, it's pretty standard for an Asian restaurant. \u00a0It is a cozy environment so it's a nice \"fancy but not too fancy\" type place for a date. \u00a0The servers were attentive and very pleasant. \u00a0They didn't hover but when I needed a refill on tea or water they were on top of it.Overall a very satisfying visit which I would recommend to anyone who is looking in the St. Paul area. \u00a0I have no doubt I'll give this place another visit!"], ["Peter L.", "Great Spot!

Recently, they have been posting up signs for late night karaoke. \u00a0I am assuming there was little appeal, so they added colored printer paper advertising free drinks for girls and $1 Bud Light. \u00a0The taped color paper with sharpie writing is distasteful considering how nice the restaurant is. \u00a0Also, desperate."], ["Wil G.", "7:00pm: Arrive - the place is busy there are people waiting to be seated and I count 4 empty tables.

We come to Minneapolis a few times a month and when our go to sushi place in uptown's first available reservation was at 9:30pm we decided to go try a new place. We made the 25 min drive and it was well worth it. Sashimi was fresh, rolls was unique and delicious!!! Seaweed salad was one of the best I've had and I've had sushi from California to New York. Don't let the strip mall deceive you. When you walk in it's just as swanky as any downtown bistro. It's worth the drive if you are not in the St Paul area. Awesome place. Our new go to place."], ["Seppuk U.", "Lets be clear right up front. \u00a0This is quasi Japanese food. \u00a0Obviously Japanese food popularity has exploded in the last several years and this place is a cheap ass attempt to cash in on that. \u00a0From the error on the menu, which in japanese characters says \"ageku\" not \"haiku\"...(seriously? \u00a0you open a japanese restaurant and don't have anyone that can read japanese??) \u00a0and the same error all over the wallsto the ridiculous iceberg lettuce salad. \u00a0I have n.e.v.e.r. been given a salad in any J restaurant before comprising solely iceberg lettuce. \u00a0Cheapo. \u00a0Very unimpressed and if this place actually knew anything about Japanese food they should be embarrassed.to the yaki tori app that was not yaki tori. \u00a0This was a shish ke bob. \u00a0I feel sorry for any American that samples this places \"take\" on Japanese food and comes away believing that is what Japanese food really is. \u00a0I suppose it'll fool the peeps who go to Chinese buffets though, and believe General Tso chicken is authentic and eaten all over China.The only redeeming factor for this place and why I even gave them 2 stars is the nigiri and sashimi were decent. \u00a0I give the Chinese owners and staff props for using Japanese rice too, usually knock-off joints skip that little detail.TL:DR: \u00a0This is a joint surfing a trend. \u00a0The food is heavily Americanized and I would almost compare it to chain restaurant stuff, think Olive Garden as Italian. \u00a0Sushi is OK, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return here."], ["Joe P.", "Great interior! Restaurant looked amazing inside. The service was nothing to rave about nor was the food. We had a spicy girl roll which was good but far from the best I've had.

The decor gives the impression of an ice bar or a swanky lounge, the food is incredible and reasonably priced. I recommend the Sashimi Dinner.

I feels pretty awesome to be remembered!As someone who could take-it-or-leave-it with fried rice, theirs is to die for!We typically end up with a larger group since it's one of the go-to spots for many of Boltz's Family Martial Arts adult student after classes. The staff is so accommodating of groups and allows us to push a few tables together. I have recently taken to picking up something to-go for lunch since I work so close, too. Just as delicious and even more reasonably priced than the already-reasonable dinner prices."], ["Adele L.", "Surprisingly great sushi and sashimi. Authenticity is overrated when it comes to cuisine. After years of sampling sushi all over the country, I can say this place serves astoundingly good food. If the food is fresh, tasty, and combines flavors in a pleasing way, then it's perfect. The truth is that authentic dishes are often unpleasant to people of other cultures (e.g. chicken feet and mock duck). Americans will like the food served here, and the prices are so reasonable considering the decor is so elegantly beautiful. If I could afford their interior designer, I'd hire them for my own house. The sheer inventiveness and elegance is rare in a restaurant I can afford to eat at. This is a great place for a first date, just come in after 8 pm for the happy hour prices."], ["Jen K.", "My husband and I used to enjoy going to lunch at Haiku. We quickly noticed the food quality (at lunchtime) go down but still wanted to give it a chance, until our last visit. Not only was the food disappointing, but the Groupon we had just purchased was not honored. Haiku will not accept the Groupon for lunch even thought it does not state that in the fine print. Rather than be apologetic about the situation, the owner told us to take it up with Groupon blaming them for being inaccurate. Making a mistake on a coupon is one thing, brushing off a customer will sadly continue to drive business away. I wish them luck, but will no longer be dining at Haiku."], ["Grace C.", "Haiku was freezing cold. Wear a sweater. Their onion soup was good. Their Spicy Tuna roll wasn't spicy at all, it was totally bland and muddled down with topiko. The California rolls ingredient proportions were outta whack: too much avocado not enough crab.
