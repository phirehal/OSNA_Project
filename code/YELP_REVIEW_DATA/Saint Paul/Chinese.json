It was close to our hotel and had decent reviews, so we were surprised when we drove up and there were only 2 cars in the parking lot. \u00a0A sign on the window said that they do Dim Sum on the weekends, so we were not sure whether or not we wanted to eat there. \u00a0We figured we'd walk in, check out the menu, and decide whether or not to stay.When we walked in, the scent of delicious food was immediate and welcoming. The decor of the restaurant is also really cool. All of the wooden panels on the wall have intricate carvings, and you would never know from the outside (a standard strip mall) that the inside would be so well decorated. The gentleman who greeted us at the door (who later became our waiter) let us know that even though they weren't serving Dim Sum on the cart, we could still order some of their best Dim Sum dishes off the menu, and he went so far as to suggest several.I'm so glad we listened to him! \u00a0We ordered spicy szechuan dumplings, steamed pork buns, Shanghai mini juicy buns, sticky rice with pork, and an egg roll.The egg roll and steamed pork buns were standard fare, but the spicy szechuan dumplings and Shanghai mini juicy buns were unlike anything I've tried! They were both packed with umami goodness and flavors that I haven't had anywhere else.A great feature of this restaurant was the service. Our waiter showed us how to properly eat the juicy buns and the sticky rice with pork, and he wasn't condescending at all. He even suggested what we would enjoy if we came back for weekend dim sum.

We also ordered the general tso's tofu and crab soup dumplings. The soy milk comes plain (and hot), so you'll need to sweeten it yourself, but tasted like it was made in house. Score! However, the rest of dim sum (including the dumplings that everyone keeps talking about) looked like they came pre-made/factory-purchased/frozen. I can't comment about the taste, but it looked alright. Boo.I thoroughly enjoyed my general tso's tofu though. Crispy tofu with a not-too-heavy coating of general tso's sauce and steamed broccoli. I was hit with nostalgia because it tasted similar to the one I eat in MA.

The food speaks for itself, its not the flavor you were expecting, its better, unique. The spicy pork of some kind is what I ordered after a long day, this combined with my wife's Sichuan chicken and some crab soup dumplings. It was perfect, its not quite authentic when ordering Chinese, instead it is its own restaurant, and that isn't a bad thing.

I personally like the Ma la beef tendon off the appetizer list or any of the buns. Be aware that some Sichuan style dishes have more unique taste such as heavy use of dried peppers or sourness compared to than typical Chinese food.

They live up to every ounce of hype they've received. Try them.After the juicy buns comes the main course and although the juicy buns steal the show everything else I've tried has not disappointed. The hunan chicken is really tasty and full of veggies if you're looking for those. Otherwise if you have someone to share with or are incredibly hungry the crispy whole fish is outstanding and probably one of my favorite dishes ever. Their menu is gigantic so you won't have a problem finding something, it may take a while to decide though.Not mentioning the great service would be wrong.

The food selection doesn't seem worth the price. Also we had green beans that looked like they were covered in snot.

If you're looking for mind-blowing flavor, probably no buffet is going to be a great bet. Don't come expecting sushi or hibachi. This is a modest buffet, but it's priced accordingly. I think of it as basic Chinese takeout style comfort food. That said, the potstickers are in a league of their own, and I know people who come here just for them. The filling has great texture, the wrappers are never doughy, and the sauce is delicious (if you get these, put them in a bowl or eat them quickly, because they get cold fast, but it's totally worth it!). The green beans are snappy and fresh tasting, and sometimes some of the folks that work there are sitting at a table with a big pile of fresh green beans snapping the ends off, which I think is pretty cute. They have sauces, sprinkles and peanuts for your soft serve, and I love their almond cookies, which are pretty standard but have a nice big blanched almond half in the center. This would probably be a great place to take kids for their first try at American-style Chinese food. I've been eating here for about eight years. The food is consistent and it's always relaxing, speaking as someone who sometimes finds server interactions stressful. I see solo diners who come in with a book or newspaper almost every visit. As others have mentioned, beverages are self-serve (and included in the price), but the staff is very kind, everything is always clean, and you probably won't have dirty plates on your table for long. It might be worth remembering \u00a0that while you may not have received much personal service, your table doesn't clean itself, which seems worth at least a small tip."], ["Erin K.", "When it comes to Chinese food, I'm very picky - especially Chinese buffets! I've been here a few times now, and I haven't been disappointed. \u00a0The food trays are always being refilled with fresh product - compared to some places where they just stir the crusty crap around to make it look like it hadn't been sitting there for the past hour untouched. The Chinese options are the common items (sweet and sour, general tso, sesame, egg rolls, wontons, and others) along with american side items (mac and cheese, herb roasted potatoes, chicken wings, french fries, etc.).

Fill your own beverage. You want to spike your drink Mr. Panama Jack? Go right ahead, no one will be the wiser.3. Szechuan beef that is both delicious and spicy, just like the creators of the Great Wall intended. Three things I dislike:1. All the chicken entrees are swimming in gravy. \u00a0Not even flavorful gravy. \u00a0Lame.2. Limited selection for a lunch buffet that sets you back eight cool ones.3. The workers playing mahjong while I eat. \u00a0Don't know why, but I do not trust people who play with mahjong tiles whilst I consume food.Overall, I would return.

The #22 vermicelli noodle: I enjoyed the thicker larger noodle, and the egg roll was delicious. The dish itself was excellent. The only downfall is the portion size. The appearance of the chive cakes looked mouth watering, but as I took a bite into the cake, it was filled with oil. The dough wasn't fully fried.

These are just my opinions others may disagree or not even notice the little details, but I'm a very finicky person, so I like to look at every detail."], ["Emily W.", "I remember growing up in a Taiwanese household and eating lunch at my American babysitter's house. My favorite meal was macaroni and cheese with tuna fish, which I would literally eat so much of until my stomach hurt. Now looking back, I'm kind of grossed out by myself, but Cheng Heng brings me back to that time because this is probably one of the only restaurants in the Twin Cities that is so good, I will eat so much, ignore all satiety signals that my gut is sending to my brain, and put myself into a self-induced food coma with an associated stomach ache. Not only is the food amazing, but Cheng Heng is one of my favorite restaurants in the Twin Cities because it truly exemplifies a successful and small family-owned business. When my boyfriend and I go there to eat, its like we are treated like family. We love talking with Kevin, the owner, about what's going on in the neighborhood, and enjoy listening to the many spirited discussions about the iPhone in Cambodian. Its amazing to see how Kevin's children have grown up, from being unable to speak and walk to playing the iPad and doing homework at the restaurant. Not only that, Kevin and his family have even used the money they make from the restaurant to fund schools in Cambodia. We eat and educate other people in the process, how amazing is that?!But really, what we love most about the place is the food. This is not a restaurant that has compromised its flavor or its prices with the more success they acquire. I have been eating at this restaurant for almost 10 years now, and the flavor is the same, and as good as ever. Kevin's mother-in-law is still in the back, working as a chef, and her food is amazing. Not only that, their prices have not increased like other restaurants in the area or on Eat Street. When I come here, I literally feast and am always surprised by the amount listed on the bill. Some recommendations:- Phnom Penh noodle soup is my favorite- Boyfriend's fave is the Khor Koo (sp? Just ask Kevin)- Spring rolls are unique to anywhere else in the city and very tasty- Mussels are so inexpensive and tasty, be prepared for some spice- Tri-colored bean is unique to this restaurant as well and also very yummy- Curry is amazing, and great to take home The other day when I came here I overhead somebody say, \"This place is so good that I'm going to go home now and lay on my couch and say, 'Unnhhhh' because of how much food I ate\". I couldn't have said it better myself. I love this place, and will continue to make the trek from Uptown Minneapolis just so that I can go home, snuggle with my dog on the couch, and let out a satisfying, \"Unnnhhhh,\" at the end of the night."], ["Luis L.", "Great family run restaurant, \u00a0the Owner always asks how we are doing and always encourages us to try something new even though we are addicted to our staples.

We ordered the Spring rolls (since I'm obsessed with finding the best ones), at $3.75, an average price, and about average they were for me. The description made it sound like there were a lot more vegetables in them than what actually came out. No carrots, I swear it said carrots, oh well, the rice paper was a little too sticky for me as well. What saved these rolls was the mint inside, made them super fresh tasting, and the sauce was different, a sweet oil based sauce with hand crushed peanuts. Really good. I wanted to order more than the soup because everything looked amazing and it's fun to see the slight differences between different types of Asian cuisine. But, I wasn't that hungry and wanted the Tom yum soup over anything else. This soup is awesome the flavors are great! It's a sweeter soup, which originally I thought I wouldn't like being that I'm a master of the spicy world. The tofu was cooked perfectly and the icing on the cake is the Quail Eggs. Oh my goodness, they are like soft boiled (I think, I'm not an egg master) and they pop and melt in your mouth. It's a big bowl, and Nic and I were filled after the appetizer and soup, which comes with rice too!Love that everything is veggie friendly, love that it is super cheap, and I will be back to try some of the other dishes!

They place is run pretty effectively and you are guaranteed some flavorful food.Some things I would recommend include:Beef fried rice, Chicken wings, Beefs ribs and their Beef and Broccoli!"], ["Jonathan T.", "To preface my review, I know a grip of peeps that like to debate the use of the ambiguous word \"authentic,\" which is understandable. I mean, what does that mean, exactly? Well, based on my past experiences that often relate to many other Southeast and East Asians that I grew up with, a Chinese restaurant is authentic if it meets the several criteria outlined below. Does Peking Garden pass? CRITERIA I: Fast service. Not necessarily friendly. Hungry patrons want to shove food in their face as quickly as possible, and most Chinese restaurants I've grown up in often skip formalities such as \"how are you this fine evening?\" A server at a Chinese restaurant will usually ask, \"What would you like to order?\" and wait for your response to scribble everything down on his or her little pad, then dash to the kitchen. As long as the food comes out blazing fast and piping hot, what else matters? Also, like with any job, a server might forget an order. And, if that ever occurs, make sure to wave a staff member down to remind him or her. Shouting is A-OK.During my most recent experience there, our food came out incredibly fast, and I had to flag down a server to get some extra napkins. (No big deal.) Our three dishes came out in less than 15 minutes, which was awesome. I'm assuming that the kitchen carries a legion of cooks. *Side note: Don't be offended if the server only looks at one or two people. It's customary that only a couple people order for an entire table.CRITERIA II: 90% or more of the diners are Asian.Shouldn't a cuisine -- that comes from a particular country of origin -- appease the people that also come from the same country of origin? I would think so! That's your bread and butter, yo! So, anytime Asian folks at a Chinese restaurant can be spotted, it's a good sign. (I say \"Asian,\" because I can't assume everyone is Chinese. Lots of Hmong and Viet folks there, too.)Peking Garden is usually filled to the brim with Asian folk, especially on the weekends. Not to mention, my girlfriend's family (Taiwanese) has been eating there for over a decade. Legit? I think so... BTW, why an arbitrary percentage of 90? Because us Asian folks love \"As.\" Ha. Ha. Ha. But seriously, I wouldn't be surprised if 5-10% of the Twin Cities' Chinese population ate there at least once on the weekends.CRITERIA III: The same old characters.There's the kid face-to-screen watching Pokemon on his iPod , the elderly grandma walking to the bathroom with the assistance of her daughter, and the old man with his shirt tucked in telling stories about the old times. Peking Garden often has all three of these characters, practically every night. Sometimes, they're all part of the same family. CRITERIA IV: Tasty food.This is the most important criterion that causes to I-III to occur. I'll review what we had, most recently. *Steamed Black Cod With Ginger & Soy-Sauce: Fatty and savory skin and luscious meat. If you love fish, this is definitely one of the best dishes in the Twin Cities. Not to mention, black cod is a much more affordable and sustainable than sea bass, and they taste practically the same.*Lobster With Ginger & Scallion: Can't get any better than fresh lobster! Peking Garden has several tanks in the back right filled with them, and when ordered, they're taken out and quickly cooked. There isn't a ton of meat, but plenty of flavor. *Pro tip: Fellas -- Give the claws to your girl. She'll appreciate that you're giving her the parts with the most meat. lol.*Crab And White Asparagus Soup: Usually served at Chinese and Vietnamese weddings, we indulged in this delight. Pretty good, although, there's an unusual after-taste. *Pea Tips: Best I've ever had and perfectly salted. Yum!*Note: Don't order General Tsos, orange chicken, and the like. ****Don't get me wrong, I enjoy eating at fancy restaurants and don't mind dropping money for them; however, if I had to choose how I would spend $70 on a meal and highly weighed value and taste over other factors, I would pick a Chinese restaurant like Peking Garden ten out of ten times."], ["Louise M.", "Peking Garden has no Garden. It's in a strip mall in St. Paul not in Beijing/Peking. I love how Chinese named their restaurants. It doesn't have to be true, but as long as it connects to the old country, it's great! .. And it is! When I first moved here, I was a bit depressed looking at the Chinese restaurant scene. There wasn't much choice compared to where I used to live. There really isn't much of the fancier restaurant either for celebration like Chinese New Year. The ones that always come up are Mandarin Kitchen and Peking Garden. Either is far from fancy but they do serve good non chop suey Chinese foods with selections of fresh live seafoods.Yesterday was my second Chinese New Year dinner at Peking Garden. Yeah, we did it a bit early so we can eat freely before Lent starts. It doesn't bother me but I'm a sinner. Big sinner. Some of my friends on the table probably had halo on their head trying to do the Daniel Fast for Lent. Not me. I may give up smoking or Candy Crush. Wait, I don't smoke and I don't play Candy Crush. I think it'll be a successful Lent!But Chinese New Year first. It's a huge holiday for Asians and it's one of my fave holidays ever. The kids and singles get red envelope filled with money and I used to rake it in and then had a shopping spree from hard work bowing with my hands clasped together and wishing my elders a prosperous new year. Peking Garden was packed from the CNY crowd too though it's way early for it. People can celebrate within the 15 days from the actual date as China had over 1 billion people in China alone and hundreds of millions elsewhere. We have relatives to visit and one day won't be enough.Service was fast and not at all delicate. They put bowls and utensils like they would throw it at you. Carts filled with food or cleaning carts smelling like bleach were also come and go fast and furious. That's how it is anywhere in Asia so it felt natural. Don't expect anything but that at Peking Garden. We ordered the course dinner for 8 and there were some fancy stuff coming. Lobster flash fried and \u00a0cooked with ginger; Shanghai pork chops - breaded pork chop in a tangy sweet but also sour sauce but not sweet and sour sauce; fried tofu cooked with mushrooms and pork slices; baby bok choy in garlic sauce; seafood stir fry; spicy manila clams; fresh whole steamed walleye; and Peking Duck!The Peking Duck really hit the spot. Too bad it came already cut and we didn't get the show on when they dress the duck table side. It also only came with the tortilla looking pancakes instead of the yummy steamed buns. However, it was still a huge treat and tasted so delicious!! The Shanghai pork chop was my other favorite. Tender pork, breaded and then paired with that tangy sauce? Happy new year to me! They also provided you with the tofu seafood soup to start and a tapioca pearl dessert soup cooked in coconut milk with chunks of soft taro. The dessert was awesome! I actually asked for another bowl. It is missing some of the more traditional CNY dishes that my mom would cook like the pork belly or anything cooked with these shreds of Chinese fungus called fat chay to resemble the saying \"Gong xi fat chay\" and have a great year. However, for what I could get here, I was pretty damn happy.I come here once in awhile for their noodle soup as well. It's great and cheap. That's also why my friends opted for here instead of Mandarin Kitchen. It was so much cheaper here. Our fancy dinner was only $25 per person with tip. That's so cheap considering we were eating lobster, a whole duck, and a whole fresh walleye. I almost wanted to tell the men to just pick up the tab.. Like Russell Peters would say in his made up Chinese accent.. \"be a man!\" Lol.Fun night, great food. Hope we started the year of the Ram grandly and great prosperous new year for us all.

Hungover? \u00a0Peking Garden (+ Vitamin Water). Casual date night? \u00a0Peking Garden. \u00a0Delivery = fast/standard. \u00a0Customer service = (with the exception of one time with a larger group) super prompt and friendly. \u00a0And the food...I really, REALLY wish they did dim sum. \u00a0I have no idea how the buffet is, but all of the menu items we've had have been super tasty, well priced, with large portions. \u00a0Definitely a bit on the greasier side with some things (why it's 4 stars instead of 5), but we've yet to order anything that we didn't like. \u00a0Suggestion: the roast duck anything and the shredded pork, eggplant, and fried tofu dish. \u00a0They also have a Family Special deal for a 4+ people with tons of awesome looking food at a really reasonable price. \u00a0Plan on doing that in the very near future. \u00a0 SUPER happy this place is so close."], ["Lyn C.", "I got Pork Eggplant Tofu in Garlic sauce and the salt and pepper fried squid. Eggplant was great and so was the sauce while the squid was fried nicely, but it slightly failed to live up to the \"salt\" portion of its name. The wonton and hot and sour soup were adequate. All in all, my experience here was positive and I am definitely coming back again because there are so many items on the menu I am dying to try! One of the best, authentic cuisines I've encountered so far."], ["Emily R.", "I traveled to China about two years ago and when I was in Beijing we went to a very popular restaurant called Peking Duck. \u00a0It was one oft he most memorable meals I had during my travels. \u00a0At first our travel guide was explaining what we were going to eat in broken English I had no idea what I was going to eat. \u00a0All she said was duck, pancake and sauce. \u00a0But it was amazing, best meal I've ever had. \u00a0Ever since that experience I wanted to find a similar meal in the states, which is sometimes impossible, but Peking Garden has Peking Duck and I highly recommend it. \u00a0You take pieces of duck and put it into a wrap, kind of like a tortilla, and put long onions, sugar, and a black sauce and then then wrap it up. \u00a0It's very hard to explain, so you just need to go check it out yourself. \u00a0Also half a duck is perfect for two people. \u00a0The service here is very kind and helpful! I highly recommend it! \u00a0Also as good as the real deal that you can only get in China!"], ["Henry W.", "Great food! \u00a0I've ordered from here a good number of times and am always nothing but impressed with the food! \u00a0My preference would be to be able to give it more stars, but I'm giving it three stars because of their policy that for them to deliver, one has to order at least $25 worth of food, which is a bit too much for me and probably many others."]], "Jingchu Land Chinese Restaurant": [], "Wong Cafe": [], "Wok Cuisine": [], "North China Restaurant": []}
