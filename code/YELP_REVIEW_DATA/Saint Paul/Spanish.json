It turns out I've passed over this place when I would have had a great time all these years. I got here about 1:30, having no clue about the menu. Two large parties were wrapping up. I love skirt steak and love when people serve it, let alone know what it is.So I got a taco and enchiladas. I would describe the food as dainty. The enchiladas are in a bowl with a tangy red sauce, and plenty of it. I ended up adding the sauce that's complimentary with the chips on the taco. They ran out of lemonade. I noticed a guy who just had a presence, and sure enough Raoul is the manager. You can feel the pride he takes in this treasure. I told him that it was my first time here, and how great my meal was, and I'll be back often, like today. It is a nice place to hang out, and I'm anxious to try brunch too."], ["Jennifer W.", "I love the space at Sonora Grill. \u00a0I do wish, however, that new restaurants would stop with this making sure that there are no noise absorbers anywhere.

I think that they shouldn't bother with it. \u00a0It's really awful. If they are offering it as an alternative to the type of food they are serving, it will undoubtedly be a huge letdown to whoever orders it. The burger is so bad that it is the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5. By the way, super reasonable prices!!We will be back soon."], ["Lindsay K.", "We walked through the doors into a very busy atmosphere. We had reservations at 7pm on a Saturday, however we were still seated 15 min late as there was no host to greet the guests or check in with. It took a while to even be noticed by the employees. After we were seated the service improved. We ordered the guacamole as an appetizer, which is a small portion for only 2 people. We ordered beef tacos and empanadas which were both outstanding!

Well-executed. Zaps that sweet tooth without being too heavy.While I wouldn't consider Cafe Ena to be cheap eats, the price was undoubtedly justifiable. Each of the 3 apps we tried were under $10.

We were seated about 15 min late even though we arrived on time. Overall, the food was disappointing. The presentation was nice but the seasoning and execution didn't match the prices. We ordered the guacamole which everyone raves about. I loved the presentation but it wasn't salty enough. The tortilla chips were nothing special. The plantain chips appetizer was very good and I would get them again. The bread and butter were good. Would've been better had the bread been warm. My husband ordered the beef medallions. The beef was tough and lacked flavor. The risotto side was bland and lukewarm. The vegetable and sausage side was decent and probably the best part of his entree. I ordered the scallops. There were three seared scallops around a bed of squid ink spaghetti. The sear was not crispy. The scallops were a bit on the fishy side but tasty. The cream sauce on the pasta was pretty good although heavy. It came out piping hot which was nice. We skipped dessert. Surprisingly, our server didn't include an auto gratuity on our bill even though we were a large party. And she was also willing to split the check, including the appetizers we shared. Some other reviews mentioned they add 20% tip to parties of six or more and they won't split checks. However, this was not our experience. Glad I went and tried this place as it has been on my list for awhile. However, I don't feel the need to return given how many other options there are."], ["Stephanie J.", "My favorite restaurant in the Twin Cities.

I met my daughter here for happy hour (3-5:30 pm). It's a great bargain with wine by the glass ($3) and sangria ($4). They offered 3 different apps at happy hour ($5 each) and we started with the guacamole served with homemade tortilla chips. It was filled with yellow and red tomatoes, red onion and roasted tomato salsa. Beautifully presented and delicious. The vegetable empanadas were good but would have liked a little more filling. We were still a little hungry and decided to share the campestre salad. Roasted organic beets that were served over baby spinach, candied almonds and goat cheese. When the server brought it out it was disappointing before we even took a bite. It was tasteless and we left most of it on the plate.The food overall was good (minus the salad) but it was the service I was most disappointed with. There are about 14 tables available for outside seating. We arrived at 5pm and all but a few of the tables were available. We requested a table with an umbrella to block the sun. Instead of honoring our request the hostess basically gave us no option but to sit at the \"2\" seated tables and be unprotected from the sun. He told us that they were expecting quite a \"crowd\" and they \"needed to save room for others\". However, while we were enjoying our appetizers they proceeded to seat 3 individual couples all at different 4 seated tables even though we requested to sit in the same place. Help me understand that? We expressed our disappointment with the beet salad to our server and even though it was clear we had only taken a few bites of it she offered no compensation for something that was terrible.

The guy who took my order was pleasant, but I got the vibe that I seemed out of place. I quickly scanned the menu and decided that it would make sense to order what the restaurant was actually named after-a pupusa. It appears that this El Salvardoran tidbit is a thick, hand-made tortilla filled with a variety of savory treats; beans, pork, and cheese being among them. I wasn't feeling very hungry, so I ordered just one of the cheese and loroco pupusas (loroco is an edible flower used in Salvadoran cooking). The pupusa came with a serving of a pickled cabbage & hot pepper slaw, as well as a small container of some kind of salsa. And the grand total? $2.45.

One of them (Goldi-Lox, I think?) was actually served on a bent spoon for a literal experience of sharing a bite when it's ordered to be split among the dining parties. With that said, starvation wasn't the best condition to be in when one's trying to judge the delicacy of a gourmet dish. Since I was at the level of a hangry hippo, I wasn't exactly delighted at the sight of a bite-size \"dish.\" I'm sure they tasted good but I'll need to do a rerun at this place to make sure my hunger doesn't overwhelm my tasting senses next time. For the main dish, I was happy with the French Toast but not ecstatic. I must say that the combination of savory with sweet from this delicacy was a refreshing and innovative mix since the slightly tangy berry compote added a dimension to the lightly salted ham and cheddar and the sweetness of the coffee butter and maple syrup-soaked toasts.

We showed up early and tried out the cocktail flight at the bar. \u00a0I should point out that the bar is the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars here. \u00a0I love an adventurous drink menu, but there were a couple duds on this one. \u00a0Consensus amongst our group was that one of the drinks was basically not consumable. \u00a0Still, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger and I would gladly come back and order a drink (of my choosing) again another day.

Service was excellent. \u00a0Our waitress was positively bubbly. \u00a0We had a big group, and she didn't seem daunted. \u00a0She even offered to some of us do the chefs tasting without the whole table going in on it. \u00a0Will I go back? \u00a0Yep. \u00a0Possibly next week."], ["Stephanie O.", "Planning a family outing to support my future MIL who was performing in a musical in Maplewood, my guy suggested we check out Tongue In Cheek for dinner beforehand. Jazzed about the happy hour time coinciding with when we would need to eat before the show, we booked our reservations...and then I realized that HH is only at the bar. Not disappointing enough to warrant the loss of a star, but this is a pet peeve of mine. When you're charging as much as you are for your menu items, I think you can afford to extend happy hour to the entirety of the establishment. Shorten the hours if you need to, but limiting it to the, what, 10 spots at the bar? Silly.Anyway, we decided to show up a little earlier than our reservation to snag a spot at the bar and enjoy SOME discounted beverage action before dinner. My parents were also at the bar (enjoying the steamed pork buns which were beloved, a GORGEOUS cheese plate, and the humble yet supposedly delicious cheeseburger...oh and I snagged some fries which were tasty) so we bellied up next to them and ordered the cocktail flight. At first look, it was a bit gin-heavy for my taste, but I am attempting to move past my distaste for gin because I enjoy aquavit which is somewhat similar and realize that my bias must lie mostly in memorably bad experiences. Some favorites from the flight were the Mother of Dragons (Jalapeno Jim Beam, Mathilde Peach, OJ...HECK YES), the When In Room (Linie Aquavit, Cynar, sweet vermouth, bitters), and the Cross Eyed Mary (Bloody Mary infused gin, Sriracha...plus a piece of pickled cauliflower made its way into our shooter...yum!). For $12, we were able to split samples of 6 drinks and kill a half an hour at the bar before the rest of our dinner group showed up.For dinner, we all ordered some teasers + the rest of the group split the beef tartare. They liked the tartare and the teasers of Charred Feta, East Fried Pride, and Berries & Bubbly. I had the Scallop Crudo (melted in my mouth...was like the most decadent seafood pudding...that probably sounds disgusting but seriously, it was phenomenal) and the Goldi-Lox (also impeccable...after the meal, which I'll get to, I started to think I should have just ordered about 10 of the teasers and a salad instead of an entree! They were that delicious)...For my entree, I asked that they prepare the Steelhead Trout (which normally comes with \"chorizo, parsnip, rapinni, beans\") without the chorizo. It was the only seafood option of the entrees at the time and the daily vegetarian delight involved a cheesy grits...our server (who was awesome, by the way) informed me that preparing the dish without chorizo meant also excluding the beans - and offered to substitute the grits in place of the beans. I appreciated the offer, but declined (as I knew there would likely be butter in the prep already and the idea of adding more dairy and then having to sit uncomfortably through a musical = bad bad bad news) and so my place, when it came out, was the fish (yum yum double yum), the rapinni (broccoli rabe is one of my favorite vegetables so OBVIOUSLY yum yum double yum), the circles of sweet, pureed parsnip, and buttermilk froth. I cleared my plate, naturally.Oh, I also ordered two cocktails throughout the course of the meal. Their cocktail menu is organized my flavor profile and my first drink came from the \"spicy section\"...it was a bloody mary option because I'd enjoyed the Cross Eyed Mary so much, but this one involved clamato and I *believe* was vodka based (but I don't remember and I can't locate the cocktail menu online). The second drink was excellent and reminded me of Marvel Bar's Oliveto...frothy from eggwhite, lemony, delicious. Finally, we succumbed to the temptation of dessert. While the others got chocolatey or Irish Coffee Brulee options, I went with the Raspberry Lemongrass Ice. It was light, refreshing, and the sliced fresh jalapeno was a nice touch. Like I said, I could easily have made a meal out of the teasers + a salad, but I am glad I tried an entree my first time. Their menu changes a little bit every so often so I look forward to coming back and seeing what else they have - and also stopping in for their intriguing brunch! Decor is perfect for either a casual or dressier date night - but prices are reflective of the quality of the food so it's definitely more of a splurge night for me. It is right in line with some of the other foodie hotspots on the East Side (Ward 6, Strip Club, etc.) and it is definitely an impressive addition to St. Paul's restaurant options!"], ["Billy D.", "First and foremost, their happy hour. Go there ASAP - it's incredible. You can get different cheladas (beer/juce paring) for $3 or try some cocktail tasters for $2 (try the cross eyed mary). This alone is enough to keep me hooked.The menu is innovative and you can tell that the chefs are having a lot of fun in their new restaurant. Layout is easy to follow especially for the cocktails. The teasers are ornate and a perfect example of this - don't miss trying a couple of these to amuse your bouche before diving into the meal. The food was very tasty and I appreciate the gastronomic attention to detail while still keeping the restaurant approachable. The mussels were spot on and I heard the tartare is great. The day we tried the vegetarian delight - it featured eggplant and I was blown away at the flavors.Service was great - knowledgeable and friendly staff who will chat with you about anything.

The beef, beans and cheese were all melted together, and the thin shell on both sides was still crisp!When you pair the pupusa with the slightly pickled cabbage/carrot and the hot sauce, it was a delicious combination.Side note, the cashiers normally call out the orders in Spanish.

The only reason I took more than two bites of my pork pupusa was because my boyfriend \u00a0was enjoying his cheese pupusa so much. I thought, maybe its just me and so I piled on the cabbage slaw to mask the dryness. That didn't help. The boyfriend finally took a bite of the pork pupusa and was pretty shocked by how badly it tasted.

Now I can't stop thinking about them.They're sort of a Salvadorean sandwich: Imagine a tamale, but squished big and round, and much bigger, and no pesky corn husk. The most popular ones seem to be the chicharron/frijole/queso combo (don't be scared of the chicharron; it's just shredded pork), but I enjoyed my chicken version just as much. The pupusa comes with some watery red salsa and a fermented cabbage slaw, which is really refreshing. When you finally get your food (be prepared to wait at least 15 minutes), you'll be tempted to pick the thing up with your fingers and devour it immediately. Try to resist that temptation. For one thing, it'll be piping hot, and you'll be walking around the next week with a scalded mouth. For another, I found that the pupusa realized its highest potential for deliciousness when I put it on my plate, smothered it with the salsa, enchilada-style, and dug in with a knife and fork.Your meal is going to cost about $3.50, plus whatever beverage you choose.

Regardless, my boss was always eating here and telling me about her pupusa addiction and so I finally tried it one day......and my eyes were opened to the glory that is El Salvadorian cuisine. Pupusas are these pockets of dough filled with pretty much whatever you want. They are so soft and delicious that it's like eating cheesy clouds that melt on your tongue. I am vegetarian so the ones I like are bean, bean & cheese, zucchini & cheese, and they even have one made with edible flowers & cheese. So even though it sounds a little odd like I might be eating flowery poop for lunch, it's a delicious and welcome break from the endless Mexican food in the market.Special note: they give you a side of salsa and a coleslaw-like vinegar salad on the side of your pupusa. For weeks I just ate this separately with my fork and poured the salsa on top but after observing other, more seasoned pupusa-eaters I have realized there is a method to the madness. You are supposed to put the salad on top of your pupusa, pour the salsa, and then roll it up like a soft taco and shove it in your mouth. Either way it's good but this way you will avoid looking like an idiot who doesn't know a pupusa from flowery poop.

By all accounts we had heard and all images we had seen about this restaurant, it was high-end, upscale and swank. We were somewhat disappointed with our experience in a few regards. When you pull up to the restaurant, opt for the valet parking: parking in the area is horrible so pay the $5 and let the pros do it. The restaurant has multiple floors. We dined on the second floor. The ground floor has a bar at which a collection of what can only be termed \"white trash\" sat, sucking back drinks during a Happy Hour. My date and I were dressed quite nicely: sport coat, shirt, tie, shined shoes for me; black & white dress and overcoat for her. This gaggle of Garth Brooks wanna-bes looked at us as if we were out of place. They were dressed more appropriateley for Applebee's. Happy Hour in an upscale restaurant? That's shoddy. The jeans and t-shirts and sweatshirts that we saw on the ground floor outnumbered those properly dressed for a meal at what was supposed to be one of the nicest restaurants in the area. The country music playing over the sound system similarly detracted from a high-end ambiance, as did the plastic - yes, plastic - flower arrangements in one of the siderooms on the ground floor in which we had a cocktail prior to dinner. There was a real fire place with a handful of logs burning away in one of the siderooms where we drank prior to dinner, and that was charming. The coat room/coat check is a nice touch that more restaurants should adopt in northern climates. It's nice to know your coat isn't dangling on the floor as you dine. We were guided to the second floor to take our table and dine. My date had the Beef Wellington, I had the top sirloin filet and squash soup, and we shared the braized spinach side: the food was worth the 50-minute wait and made up for the above-mentioned shortcomings. The Wellington was delightfully tasty and the pastry cage perfectly flaky, and my sirloin was so perfectly done (medium rare) and tender and juicy I could cut it just by simply waving my knife over it. The wine list (by the glass or bottle) is extensive and priced well. The Winnipeg Jets were at Forepaugh's the night we dined and they may account for the 50-minute wait for our entrees. It would be worth it for Forepaugh's to (1) dispense with the Happy Hour (2) institute a dress code, e.g., no jeans ever and (3) play high-end dining music (or none at all) to capture the kind of clientele to which it should aspire based on the locale, structure and prices."], ["Lisa M.", "Eh, could the table BE any smaller?The positives -*Good HH prices on wine and tasty snacks.*Good and tasty snacks - the chicken flat-bread was awesome!*Free, albeit limited, parking*Comfortable chairs in the bar*Great butternut squash soup. \u00a0The menu I looked at did not indicate it had chorizo in it, so beware if you are not a meat eater like me.The not so positives -*The tasty snacks are quite small and not large enough for more than 2 people to share.*CRAMPED seating the bar area - the 3 of us were at a table for 4 and we were smashed in there.*Tiny, tiny tables in the bar. \u00a0There is certainly not enough room for 3 glasses of wine, 3 small plates, 2 appetizers and silverware. \u00a0My fork fell on the ground 2 times because it kept falling off my plate, which was balanced on the appetizer plate which was smashed up against the other plates on the table.The really needs improving -*The service - blech. \u00a0Slow, annoyingly so, and just plain old lacking. \u00a0The lone bartender was working the whole bar and the room to the side. \u00a0He had to walk around the back of the bar, through the hallway to get drinks and serve them. \u00a0It's not his fault, but they could really use more help in the bar.Would I go back - maybe, with conditions - if it were just me and someone else and it was not busy. \u00a0It's not good for more than 2 people and once it gets busy, forget about it."], ["Melissa O.", "It was good but I can't say I'd rave about it.

HOUR.Tip 3: \u00a0Legend has it that it's haunted!Tip 4: \u00a0They are just now putting in a new front patio - maybe too late for this summer, but next year - you can find me there."], ["Steven K.", "Came here as part of a celebration dinner with a bunch of coworkers after the completion of a major project. Total group was 14 people. There was a preselected menu. I had the steak. It was nicely prepared and generous in size. But it was overly seasoned with a very salty seasoning that left an unpleasant aftertaste. Several people had walleye and they liked it. At least one person spoke well of the vegetarian selection. But honestly, neither one looked that impressive to me. One of the attractions of Forepaughs is the Victorian decor. On past visits, our server told the story of the ghost. Especially for groups, that adds to the experience of dining there. But this time, the service was efficient but not particularly friendly, and no ghost story. Can't say I'd drive across town to dine here again."], ["Bill N.", "This was our first visit to Forepaugh's in many years. \u00a0The previous menu was elegant with a heavy french influence. \u00a0Now it is elegant American. \u00a0I had a barbecued beef rib (boneless) and it was out of this world. \u00a0My meal included a couple of sides including grits that were fried in a tempura batter. \u00a0My wife ordered the NY strip, which unfortunately was mediocre. \u00a0It \u00a0did not appear or taste like a 21- day aged steak as indicated on the menu. \u00a0Instead, it tasted like yesterday's supermarket selection. \u00a0The strip, at $39 was absolutely nothing special - but my boneless rib was flawless. The service was great and the atmosphere was equally wonderful. \u00a0My recommendation is to skip the steak specialties and order the 'plated' selections. \u00a0All of those coming out of the kitchen looked great. \u00a0I just won't chance or invest in another steak at Forepaugh's - when MPLS/StP has so many other great steak choices."], ["Emily M.", "I had reserved a room for my sister's bridal shower for a Sunday brunch. I was coordinating the shower details long distance and the Catering Manager, Joan Frantz, was very helpful to ensure everything was all set for me. A few of us arrived early to set up and the valet and staff were so helpful with getting our packages to the area our brunch would be held. The mansion is beautifully maintained with hidden rooms around every corner. Our head server, Laurie (or Lori) was wonderful. She brought up fresh caramel coffee cake and coffee for my mom, my sister, and me as we set up our room and waited for guests to arrive. There was very little we had to put together, they had small floral centerpieces and tables arranged to fit our party. Also, let me mention that the day prior they called to check in before our arrival and suggested that we move to larger space with a more private restroom since their main floor fills up with Sunday brunch-goers. We basically had the whole floor to ourselves.Once guests and the bride-to-be arrived, the staff was quick to attend to drinks. We had a set brunch menu served family style. Eggs, eggs benedict, sausage, bacon, waldorf salad, breakfast potatoes....along with more fresh caramel coffee cake! After being served, the servers gave us our privacy to continue with the bridal shower. At the end of our shower, Laurie gave me a quick tour of their rooftop patio and a parlor in addition to telling me about their typical dinner service. Definitely sold me to go back when I am in the Msp/St. Paul area for dinner. The group dining price was very reasonable in comparison to other locations. You don't have to pay for a room fee. It was paid per person. They packaged all leftovers...LOTS of leftovers for us (our headcount was off a bit). Truly a charming restaurant. We read about the history of the mansion while at the shower and their website and menu are promising for those who wonder what to expect."], ["Bill P.", "We dined here this evening for our 21st wedding anniversary. Everything was absolutely excellent: the service, the food, the atmosphere. I had made reservations by popping in a couple days prior while dressed in my geeky bicycling outfit, but they were very friendly and helpful then as well and had noted it was for our 21st anniversary. We were guided to an excellent window seat on the upper level overlooking the park. It happened to be restaurant week so we ordered off the special three-course menu, and we also ordered the cheese plate. We each ordered different dishes for each course and shared with each other, so we each enjoyed seven different menu items and both absolutely loved everything. Besides the cheese plate, we had the Chinese scallion flatbread, BLT caesar salad, tortellini, walleye, deconstructed banana cream pie, peanut butter crunch bar, plus table bread and wine. Being in a historic mansion with all the smaller rooms and old architecture also makes for a wonderful atmosphere in our opinion."], ["John W.", "There's a new 'Downstairs' menu that gives diners a good value with the same elegance and attentive service as the regular offering. We both had an amazing dinner last night. I'll recommend Forepaugh's if your evening dinner is the destination and the experience is as important as what's on the plate.We arrived on a cold, rainy spring night. I took advantage of the valet parking and pulled right up the covered entrance. We felt welcome the moment we stepped inside. It was all warm reds and dark wood with low lighting, murmurs of contented, low voices and the soft clink of glasses from the nearby bar. We sat in the bar while our table was made ready. The evening view over Irvine Park, with restored mansions with attendant lilacs was lovely, even in the rain. Up to dinner, we had two half starter plates: Fruit and cheese (wonderful, especially the dried figs and soft cheeses) and the chicken samosas (over-fried, in my opinion).My dinner was a perfect pan-roasted, boneless half chicken, spinach salad and something wonderful I had never had before: deep-fried gnocchi. The chicken was crispy on the outside and tender-juicy inside. I could tell it was brined and the chef knew what he was doing. The gnocchi looked like seasoned tater-tots. They melted in my mouth.My wife had a walleye fillet served Thai-style. It was swimming in a coconut-curry sauce. Her eyes rolled in pleasure at the first bite. We usually share each others entree, but she only gave me the teeniest of pieces.Dessert was a creme brulee. Not bad by any means, but I've had better.We spent nearly three hours at our small, cozy table. Definitely a 'slow-food' event. Just what we wanted."], ["Mark B.", "We went here because City Pages said the place had the best dessert in the Twin Cities. \u00a0We were disappointed, to say the least, with the sample dessert platter. \u00a0All of the desserts seems like they had been sitting in the refrigerator all day. \u00a0The crusts were soggy and cold. \u00a0For best in the city, we were expecting mind-blowing. \u00a0Not a single part of the 5-part platter was better than average. \u00a0Not sure what the reviewer was thinking.What did make up for this place was the atmosphere. \u00a0We were seated right next to a fireplace and the servers added a couple extra logs just for us. \u00a0Great date spot, if only the dessert matched the atmosphere."], ["Joy G.", "I am madly in love with Forepaughs!For a special event or just a nice happy hour with friends, this place has become like a second home to me!The staff is wonderful and very welcoming! \u00a0The chef is amazing!

We were first enthralled by the building's historic charm- which other restaurant in the twin cities takes venue in a historic Victorian mansion? Their service was top notch- Victor, our server and Joe, the restaurant Manager were excellent. Most importantly though - was their food, which was absolutely amazing!! Think La Belle vie gastronomically fused with \"experimental fusion\". Their small plates were absolutely decadent- my ultimate favorite is the Tuna Harissa. For dessert- the apple crisp phyllo is a definite must! Do go and check out the mansion itself- and have a summer drink or two out in the patio. Forepaugh is easily St. Paul's best kept secret.

Glutinous - absolutely, but acceptable. \u00a0Somehow though, ordering multiple dishes didn't satisfy my desire to try everything I wanted here because 3/4 of the menu sounded amazing.We started off with a carafe of sangria, I'm all about getting a good deal, so by the glass would never do. It was very neutral, not particularly sweet so it didn't seem mismatched with any of the flavors we tried for dinner.Queso Frito - a spongey textured cheese with a tart sherry glaze. I liked the bites where I got the sweetness of the cheese where it had carmelized in the frying pan and the brightness of the sherry both in one.Cannoli - thin, fresh pasta filled with a creamy crab and cheese filling. This was good but not as good as other yelpers said, I was hoping the lobster would be easier to pick up, it's one of my favoritesViera - scallops on deliciously toasty bread in lemon sauce. Absolutely my favorite, I didn't want to share! I would say this is a must-order for every visit.Albondigas - meatballs served in a steamy tomato broth. \u00a0This came with a surprising quantity of meatballs, but the broth was really the best part. I couldn't stop sopping it up with bread.Churro - a lightly fried breadstick coated in sugar and cinnamon. The churro was different than I expected, it was made in house so it was thick and was soft and doughy in the middle.We went late on a Sunday which was a perfect sized crowd for a pretty small space.

When a couple walked in and was told to sit next to us, they hummed and hawed as they assessed that the table was literally 2 inches away from our table. They ended up sitting next to us, but by golly, they might as well have been part of our dinner conversation (and we did end up talking about some of the food, lol). There's also a bartop you can sit at, but the rest of the tables are just squished together. (Side note: the bathroom is quite roomy for some reason..)Service: We were first served by a nice waitress and was later served by a waiter. Both were fine, though the only thing that confused me was that he directed a couple to sit at the table right next to us.... When there were other tables farther away that would have fit them. I get why he might have had a reason to do so, but it just made for an awkward moment.Food: not bad! I can't remember all that I had, but highlights:- Viera - These were my favorite. I wanted more of it. - Cannoli - pretty yummy!- Octopus: Eh.- Patatas Bravas: I'd pass on these.Overall: If the seating weren't so cramped, the food was actually pretty good (not all, but most).

It was a rather late night on a weekday and as I came in I saw over 10 people sitting at the bar. The bartender offered me a beer and said this is what everyone else was having, a bit of an odd way of offering a beer to someone but sure if that's what everyone is having why not? As I was drinking the manager came to me and said sorry we're closed. It turned out the staff was having a beer 101 lesson and tasting by a very knowledgeable bartender and the staff had thought I was a new staff member. I did look dressed up as I had just finished work and was in town for business. I told the manager no worries I can finish my beer and find some food. It so happened the owner Hector Ruiz was there and over heard me. He felt bad that I was hungry and had his staff whip up some of the cold food when the kitchen was closed so I can snack while I was drinking my beer. Wow I did not expect that! Let me tell you those platters were good I can't wait to come back when I'm in town again to actually try the cooked food! So the night goes on and they even let me join in on their beer tasting and lesson!It was such an insight on what goes on in an establishment that really cares about its patrons. Each beer we had we learned about the history behind each one, for me that was a great experience to learn some of the history of local beers and the different types of pairings as to what kind of beer would make an excellent accompaniment to certain dishes! If you need a beer suggestion definitely \u00a0take their advice they have been well trained!We were having a great time learning about beer and when it was all done they invited me to go out for some late night grub! They took me to a Japanese place in the area for you guessed it more BEER! We had fun like we were long lost friends. This was truly a unique experience and it felt like it was straight out of a food network show! The way I see it this restaurant is on the right path for success with staff that work hard, have fun and if they treat an out of towner like me you guys that live in the area are lucky to have such a great establishment like this one!To my new friends at Rinc\u00f3n 38, I thank you all for an unforgettable night!

The ambiance is simple but very nice. The wine list is superb as it features a lot of Spanish selections. Two areas that may put you off - the waiter was excellent but we felt a little \"hurried\". Additionally the tables are very close and I did not need to know that the fellow next to me likes to ride his bike at 20 mph and is excellent at Castillian Spanish (yet did not say a word in Spanish to the waiter who clearly spoke Spanish).

First impression, I thought the place had an old musty odor to it, although my boyfriend didn't notice it. We were kindly greeted by the server and chose our table. We ordered the meat empanadas and they were ok. Couldn't tell weather they were fresh or frozen - they were perfectly molded into little round half-spheres which makes me think they were frozen.The bf and I both actually decided on the same meal item - carnitas chimichangas. They arrived quickly and were hot! And huge! On the side was lettuce, sour cream, and tomatoes, in the chimichanga was rice, peas, refried beans, cheese and shredded pork. The pork itself was delicious, as was the sauce on the top, however, I didn't think the chimichanga had too much flavor. I felt it needed more seasoning or something.Service was great, our server was friendly and attentive. Food was so-so. I was kinda bummed that the yelp.com Check-In offer was no longer accepted (but our server compensated for this by offering us the happy hour special on our empanadas.All in all, this place was ok. Might go back, might not. Can't wait to try some of the other new restaurants in the area."], ["Ali M.", "Latin food is one of my top 3 favorite cuisines (wait...are cheeseburgers a cuisine? if so, then it's top 4.). While I'm partial to Cuban food and I think Hola Arepa (brick and mortar) is kind of a joke, Latin American fusion food is definitely winning me over - especially considering the cuisine has a deep love of spice like I do. This is a taco mecca and we're talking cheap tacos too. Three tacos (all the same meat, unfortunately) + a side (rice, beans or uh...french fries, you fucking gringo) is around $9 after tax. That's beautiful, man. So far we've tried the chicken and roasted pork tacos. While the pork tacos have a great flavor, we both like the chicken tacos the best. And that's pretty goddamn weird for me, I think chicken is the most boring protein ever. I never order chicken. But something spoke to me and I ordered them the first time and the neckbeard stole one of them (he ordered the pork the first time) and he was a changed man. The next time we ordered food, he got the chicken tacos. #trendsetterThe steak quesadilla comes with rice and refried beans - the rice is awesome and the beans are gross. To be fair, I hate refried beans (black beans 4 lyfe, yo) so it could just be a personal thing. The steak quesadilla was hearty, the quality of the steak was so-so but it was cooked well and it was cheesy as fuck. Definitely something I'd order again, especially if I'm fucking drunk or high as hell. It was a substantial meal for $11.The cheese empanadas are heavenly. I hate that word, but I can't even lie...I was in pastry, cheesy heaven eating them so it fits. The order comes with 3 empanadas, this bothers me because I hate sharing shit - four would be ideal for parties of 2. Just a thought. \u00a0One more thing...Cocina Latina boasts an amazing hot sauce.

Of my young adult sons, one ordered tasty fried rice with different meats, and one had chicken breast and fried plaintains. I asked for recommendations for something unusual, and chose a rice dish with seafood: mussels, shrimp, crab claws/legs and some calamari/squid, also with a few plantain and avocado slices. The food was tasty, and the portions good sized and priced around $15.It was so good we forgot to take pictures!For desserts, we opted for the cheesecake and flan, which were fine, but I disappointed myself by not choosing something more unusual, such as figs and queso. Son 1 went for guava paste and cheese, which was interesting. I wished I had ordered a milkshake instead; a usual flavor such as mango or berry, or even a wine tree tomato shake.

This time I was able to get a table and I ordered the catfish stew which was a huge meal all on its own with a flavorful broth and came with a side of flattened discs of fried plantains and a tasty orange colored salsa. While the one chunk of catfish was fall-off-the-bone tender the 2nd one was tough and I didn't bother trying to pry off morsels of flesh. I was already full by that point anyway The downside is that it was $14: the soups/stews/weekend specials don't have a price and the menu tells you to ask the waitress for what they have on offer. Only after I paid for it did I recall that I did ask for \u00a0the soup of the day and that was listed at $6.99.

It was the right decision.I was tempted by the Colombian and Ecuadorian menu items (the menu is loooong), so I ended up asking for a recommendation from the server since I'm not that familiar with either type of cuisine. Unfortunately, I wasn't in the mood for hunks of meat and eggs on Tuesday, which is standard for those dishes. With her blessing (first thing she recommended), I ended up skipping the South American stuff this time and ordered the enchiladas platter with carnitas, my favorite Mexican meat. Of the three shredded pork treasures on the plate, I did two with red sauce and one with green sauce----both great, but I liked the red sauce best. It came with rice, beans and it all tasted superbueno. I cleaned my plate like a hungry hippo.My friend ordered a chimichanga. I can't speak to the taste, but the size of this thing presents a delicious challenge. It's almost as big as a loaf of bread. No foolin'. They have a lot of refrescos latinos on the menu that go beyond the usual Jarritos. The atmosphere is comfy and the service was excellent too. They serve beer and have a happy hour daily, plus some lunch specials that we had both wished we'd noticed before ordering because they sounded like a delicious way to try multiple things. I think they were around $7 each.One last note! Make sure you try the creamy looking hot sauce on the table. It's exceptionally tasty."], ["Linda H.", "We came here because we had a groupon or some certificate to use up. We had read the reviews so we were excited to try it out! We ordered chips/salsa/guacamole and chorizo with corn cake for appetizers. The salsa, chips, and guacamole were yummy!! The guac had alot of cilantro in it, salsa was perfect, and chips were homemade and hot. I am not a chorizo fan so I would pass on that but I think it was ok. Our entrees included steak quesadillas, carnitas enchiladas, and a steak chimichanga. All were served with rice and beans. I had the enchiladas and my first few bites were fabulous but digging deeper, they were cold. My beans and rice also were luke warm. I am someone who has to have my cold food cold and my hot food hot so this did not make me happy. If only restaurants could serve food hot, I think that's worth an extra star always! The quesadillas were ok, I thought they lacked taste, as did my carnitas, they were pretty blah as far as flavor. The meat was nice and tender but flavorless. My daughter also said the cheese in her quesadilla was not melted very well and they were luke warm. The chimi, too, was not hot, and was not deep fried. That is pretty odd...A chimi that's not deep fried?? It was like a football sized huge corn tortillas stuffed with meat... The service was pretty good, atmosphere warm and cozy, and I think I would give this place another try. They always seem to have deals on line for certificates, so although the prices seem a little spendy, grab a groupon, and its well worth it then. *No free chips and Salsa here but order some, it really was the best part of our meal*"], ["Jason K.", "My wife and I had an Entertainment Book On line coupon for a 2 for one lunch at Cocina Latina, so we decided to use it on a brisk Minnesota Saturday. We entered the strip mall looking restaurant on the corner and it looked like they took over some other business and made it a restaurant. First thing I noticed was no tap beer, probably 5 stars if it had some taps flowin'. We chose a nice booth in the smallish establishment. The menus came out and it takes about 10 minutes to peruse all of the options, and they all look good. Our server came over and I ordered the chicken enchiladas and my wife got the shrimp tacos and tamales combo. After about ten minutes our food came out with a saucy creamy red colored salsa. I dropped a dollop on my food and the spice was intense and flavorful. It had quite an awesome kick. The re-fried beans looked a lot like the ones in Mexico, a lot saucier than American re-fried beans. They were slightly bland, but with the salsa they turned into a perfect melange of spicy and lentil soup like texture. The chicken enchiladas were chock full of large chunks and the red sauce was pretty bland, probably to fit the Norwegian taste buds, but is was perfect with a few dabs of their excellent salsa. There was a lot of rice on the side, which i didn't have a lot of, because I was already getting full after a couple enchiladas, but add the salsa, and BAM! Amazing rice. My wife said the shrimp tacos were amazing as well and we didn't even get to the tamales, because we were both pretty stuffed.

The server didnt get us any silverware and dinner napkins, so I had to use my fingers to get the salsa and sour cream out of the serving cup into the tacos. The tacos actually tasted pretty good, but if I didnt have to dip my fingers in the salsa and sour cream cup without not having any napkins, I would have enjoyed the tacos a whole lot more. We then had to flag down another server to get us the silverware and napkins cos our server sort of disappeared.We order Steak and Onion, and Roast Pork for our main meals. The main dishes also came out pretty quick. They tasted ok. The rice and fried plantains on both dishes were actually the good part of the dish because both rice and plantains tasted better than both our steak and roast pork. The steak was edible but not at all memorable. The part of the roast pork with the glazing sauce tasted quite nice, but the other part that didnt have any sauce over it was dry, chewy and bland.After we were done with the meals, we had to ask the server to PLEASE refill out water glasses.

Chicken strips on the appetizer menu in a south/latin american restaurant. For reals? This is what makes this place sad. The kitchen needs some tightening up. The atmosphere could use some help which is where the marketing genius comes in. In other reviews I have preached that atmosphere is what you make it but god damn this place was empty and boring. Play some salsa music and advertise some, perhaps host a Yelp event or something and get some people in here for happy hour. this place has some authenticity to use at their disposal.

Right down to the Minute Rice accompaniment, actually. Boyfriend had a steak that was done perfectly, but he really wasn't feeling the seasonings on it.I had a lovely sangria though, so that's why I'm giving it a 3, as I am sure with the dancing and drinking (not so much the eating), this place could be pretty decent."], ["Jennifer K.", "I wish this could be a zero.

We sent it back once, and then it came back-I guess after they nuked it. Mine was warmer, but Tim's was STILL COLD. We kind of gave up after that. The food was actually inedible. The Ropa Vieja was so salty I couldn't eat it, and if somehow Jamaican Chicken was masquerading as chop suey, this was it. Worst meal I've had this decade."], ["Becky L.", "I liked the Masitas con Mofongo/Pork Tenderloin with Mofongo (ask for the sauce on the side) and the Shrimp in Garlic and Fried Green Plantains (tostones) appetizer.

It took FOREVER for the waitress (who couldn't speak English very well) to take our order, but after she did, our food was out almost immediately. I'm not sure if I am missing something, but I thought the meat in tacos was supposed to be hot. Or at least warm. The meat was cold. Like it was in the fridge and they threw it on the tortilla and brought it out. The shredded beef was cold, and chewy. Not good. On the flip side, the food my husband had, according to him, was good. He wants to go back. I'm kinda meh on the idea. Maybe I'll go and drink, and he can eat. Sounds like a fair trade off to me!"], ["Jon S.", "I really like this place! I went there for a friend's birthday because of a Groupon we bought.I grew up in South Florida where there's a very large and vibrant Cuban scene, so I am fairly familiar with Cuban food. By no stretch of the imagination am I an expert in the cuisine, but I would still like to think I can pick up on good spices, the passion that goes into it, and the true culture that comes out in the dishes.When you first walk in, you have two choices of where to sit: either in the quiet dining area, or at the tables/booths by the dance floor. To each it's own preference, but I would recommend by the dance floor for the full experience. I realized that I was tapping my feet and moving my hips the ENTIRE night while sitting at the table! I don't know how you couldn't? The latin beats blaring all night create a contagious energy!! While waiting for our food, we took full advantage of dancing salsa, meringue, and whatever else we felt like. Although only one of us knew how to dance to the music, nobody cared how the rest of us looked; everyone just saw that we were having fun, and that's all that mattered. The only downside was that the music was extremely loud and thus made it hard to carry a conversation.On to the food, my favorite part. We started with some appetizers, one of which was yuca (cassava) on a bed of lettuce, sauteed onions and red wine vinegar dressing. The dressing is the key, and plus I love yuca! We also got the Roast Pork on Tostones - roast pork on fried plantains with guacamole and sour cream. One of our friends got the same thing, but with beef (Ropa Viejo w/Plantains) as her entree, and I preferred that because the beef was slightly spicy, and generally just had a more robust flavor. As my entree, I got the Tilapia in Curry and Coconut Sauce - WOW! I'm Jamaican, so I know my curry and this curry tasted damn good. I have had \"Americanized curry\" which is very bland, and lacks spice, but they hit it right on the head. The tilapia was a good-sized serving, and fried, so which obviously made it 10x better. It was served with a side of mashed potatoes, which was the perfect compliment. I highly recommend it!Now the service. One of the few things keeping me from giving it 5 stars was that it was a bit slow, but that's about it. I was a little early for our gathering, and the Peruvian hostess engaged me in conversation until my party arrived, which I really appreciated. SN: I think she was trying to flirt with me, which I had no problems with because she was muy caliente! Anyways, our waiter was extremely friendly, and he did something that a lot of waiters nowadays forget to do: he smiled! It makes a big difference. It should be noted that Conga is located in Northeast, and some people think the place looks sketch...oh come on! Personally I think those types of people are a little stuck up and only prefer the snooty upscale dining establishments. Conga provides some much-needed culture and diversification to the Upper Midwest. Sorry if this is a little direct, but I'm just trying to keep it real. If you want an experience that's a little more raw and authentic, give this place a shot.P.S. Parking is a pain, but if you're lucky you can steal a space in the Wells Fargo lot across the street in the evening."], ["Birgitta J.", "Conga Latin Bistro is a lively Latino joint popular for live music. \u00a0Conga is a large restaurant/nightclub that has multiple levels and offers various atmospheres. Dine quiet and casually with your date while watching a live dance performance, or get in on the action yourself by hitting the dance floor with an attractive Latin regular.

Being from Costa Rica, I was more than willing to go with and savor delicious food that I grew up with (it's my comfort food). Menu looked tasty, so it was a go.First impression: The restaurant is not very pretty looking. It definitely can use some nice decorating and the layout is just weird. We went on a Thursday night and there was a Flamenco dancer and guitarists. The music was great, but the layout of the tables didn't really help us to get a good view of the mini show. I noticed it wasn't very busy (we arrived at 7:30 PM on a Thursday evening), which surprised me a bit. We even made reservations, but there was no need to.Service: No one greeted us immediately upon entering the restaurant. It took a few minutes to get greeted and seated. We were handed menus and it took about 20 minutes to get any kind of service. We were content just talking, but we didn't get any water or anything while we waited. The waitress showed up and we ordered our drinks and an appetizer. Our appetizer took a LONG time... 20 minutes again. All we ordered was a plate of tostones (that really shouldn't take long at all). We ate our appetizer and another 20 minutes go by before we get the waitress gets our order for dinner. Thank God for good company, because I would have been going nuts otherwise. About 20 minutes later and our food finally arrives. By then we had ordered another pitcher of Sangria for the table. We eat, we talk. We get our bill and used a Groupon coupon (no problem). Then it took the waitress 10-15 minutes to come by and get our credit card. Food: I was very satisfied with the food. I did think it was a bit overpriced considering that I didn't feel like I was dining in a polished restaurant... for $13-$20 entrees, I expect a certain level of presentation and style. It was pretty simple. The \"arroz con mariscos\" is delicious. My friend and I ate that happily. I did noticed that his had clams and mine didn't--very interesting observation. My husband really enjoyed his \"arroz con pollo.\" For $9, he certainly got a great meal. Our other friend ordered the \"bistec encebollado\" and she was very happy with her dish. We definitely felt well fed.Conclusion: I wouldn't go back. There are much better restaurants than this. El Meson, for example, is one of them. The lackluster atmosphere and poor service really pulled this place down big time.

If you want to give your out-of-town friends a taste of what Minnesota has to offer, you need to include The Strip Club on the agenda.The small plates are where it's at. Nicely priced and GREAT to come with friends to try everything! If you're curious about how 100% grass-fed beef should taste, they nail it with their steaks every time; I've never been disappointed. They've even found a farm that creates HUMANE fois gras (I didn't think it was possible until I looked up the farm they were sourcing from).I could gush and gush about this restaurant, but I'll stop...for now...only so you can get your car started and head over there pronto!"], ["Anya S.", "I guess based on the reviews I read, my expectations were higher. It was good, but I was not blown away nor do I feel like I want to return. \u00a0Came here for brunch on a Saturday. \u00a0Around 12:45 pm we were the third table there, plus couple people at the bar. Service was good and attentive. I had the french toast and my brunch mate had the burger. \u00a0Toast was good, solid but nothing special. \u00a0Same goes for the burger. \u00a0The fries were quite ordinary and almost McDs like. The place itself is cute and I liked the decor. Location is a bit off the beaten path."], ["Noel M.", "I've wanted to go here for a while and got the chance to go for brunch on Sunday. We did have reservations but it seemed like you could get a table without them. Demand probably fluctuates a bit for them. So some weekends are probably easier than others.Service was very prompt when I got there, I was 10 minutes early and got to sit at my table right away. They brought me a drink right quickly. They were very good at keeping coffee for my friend and tea for me topped off. Important at breakfast/brunch.A lot of stuff on the menu looked really good so it was hard to decide. Friend had the benedict, it came with mixed greens. She said it was delicious. It looked tasty.I had the Logger's Tower. Big stack of pancakes, ham, egg, scallions, rosemary. Real maple syrup on the side. This was awesome, particularly the first few bites. I normally don't like restaurant pancakes, I think they are often too heavy and not light/fluffy enough. These met my very high standards. The combo of all the ingredients with the syrup - the savory and the sweet - really good. It was huge so I brought the leftovers home to eat later, still good reheated.Tiny things I would change with the Logger's Tower - Pieces of ham could have been a bit bigger, there wasn't enough to get many of the bites that had all ingredients in them. Whole thing needed much more scallion and rosemary. The first bites with it were awesome but I ran out of those two toppings after 3-4 bites. The remaining egg/ham/pancake was still good, just not as good. The whole thing really did still taste great so these are small issues.Service was very slightly slow as the meal went on but very polite and the whole brunch took 90 minutes, normal length of time for brunch so it wasn't that slow. Just felt slow in some spots. We didn't mind, we were busy catching up anyway.I'll definitely be going back, hopefully for dinner. Will update my review when I do."], ["Vishal S.", "Hole in the wall!!! Excellent food , service and amped up atmosphere. The chef did an amazing job with food presentation and the bartender was wiping up a storm of concoctions.Yum"], ["Laurie A.", "This place has a very speakeasy feel to it, tucked into a neighborhood. \u00a0Super weird location in all honesty but once you get inside, it was worth it. \u00a0We didn't have a reservation so were lucky to get in and our server was awesome. \u00a0We both just loved him! \u00a0The duck was fantastic for my tastebuds however had a very unique pairing so I would guess some people wouldn't like it. \u00a0It had hominy (which I don't like) and a flavored oil around it so read the ingredients before ordering. \u00a0I loved it but it was very rich. \u00a0The steak was also amazing. \u00a0I would hands down go back again but would try something else although I did like the duck. \u00a0I don't think there's a dish you can go wrong with here though!"], ["Mary S.", "Great food and service as always. We went for our Anniversary dinner last night and started the meal off with their Tartar. Perfect dish with the right amount of acid. It also came with fresh lettuce wraps. \u00a0I ordered the Halibut dish. This was a hearty meal as halibut is a meaty fish , and \u00a0it sat on top of this yummy tomato bisque sauce. It was also accompanied by a few clams which was perfectly placed into the side of the bowl as if cradling the whole work of art. \u00a0My husband ordered the steak. We loved how it came pre- cut showing its perfect pink as if the chef was saying \"wallah- tis perfecto !\" And of course dancing with the steak \u00a0were soft sliced carrots as well. We had the roasted mushrooms (melting in your mouth ) and risotto ( soft as butta) as side dishes. Will definitely be going back to this Dayton's bluff gem!!"], ["Tony E.", "The Strip Club has been a perennial favorite of mine for years. \u00a0The food is consistently delicious and fresh, the service is always excellent, and the atmosphere is intimate and charming. \u00a0For me it's probably the overall best restaurant in Saint Paul."], ["Karla J.", "Food is awesome great. It's a little off the beaten path outside of St Paul. When you first get there and go inside its not super fresh new decor. It's an older building. The service is great and like I said awesome food."], ["Jennifer H.", "I cannot say enough good things about The Strip Club! \u00a0I've been coming here since 2012 and there hasn't been a single visit that was less than excellent. \u00a0Let's start with the basics - service. \u00a0The wait staff has been incredibly attentive and always very friendly. \u00a0They are knowledgable about the food and happy to make recommendations. \u00a0Service is so important, and The Strip Club clearly gets that. \u00a0The ambiance at The Strip Club really depends on the time of day you visit. \u00a0I haven't been for brunch, only for dinner in the mid to late evening. \u00a0It's a dark, intimate setting that's great for celebrating birthdays, anniversaries or just a night out. Last, and perhaps most importantly, is the food. \u00a0Try some (or all!) of their small plates. The menu changes seasonally, so there's always something fun to try. \u00a0I recently had their carnitas and WOW were they delicious. \u00a0Their combinations are interesting and fresh, frequently incorporating local food grown here in MN. \u00a0Their duck or lamb entrees are usually rich, so save room if you're planning on ordering those.I'm so happy to have found The Strip Club. \u00a0Keep doing what you're doing!"], ["Tom N.", "First things first. This was, hands down, the best/coolest/most amazing restaurant experience I have had. We visited with some friends early in June and it was all I could have expected and more. The meal started with ordering drinks and a visit from Tim Niver, the owner. Tim spoke with us about the menu, drinks, his Twitter use (@tniver), and lots of other things. What a way to start the evening!As for libations, I had the \"Paradise in the Alley\" and my wife had \"The Woody.\" Both of these whiskey drinks were smooth and tasty. She tried the \"Kilo Kai,\" the only drink that doesn't rotate off the menu, afterward and said it was fantastic.As appetizers we shared the pork belly, beef tartare egg rolls, and the fried chicken dumplings. All of these were solid choices, but the egg rolls were my favorite (mostly because I'm a sucker for beef tartare).I had the braised lamb dish as my entree. I can not describe how amazing this lamb was. It fell off the bone and melted in my mouth. My wife ordered the \"Chef's Loaded Burger\" that was also extremely delicious.For dessert we had both a dish that was snickerdoodle covered in hot caramel and a shortcake dish that I can only describe as the 'worlds best PB&J'. I'm sorry that I can't remember the names, but say those things and they will know what you mean.After dinner, as the place was closing down, we spoke with JD Fratzke (co-owner and chef) about our experience. It was a great combination of excellent food and awesome service.I doubt I'll forget this restaurant trip and I absolutely cannot wait to return."], ["Michael G.", "We had never been to The Strip Club, and we thought we would give it a try. We would never go back there again. The food was not good and the service was just okay. \u00a0The wine list is poor at best. To be honest it was a very disappointing experience. The steak was raw in the middle when we ordered it to be more well done than it was served, so after we sent the steak back, a waitstaff person literally through the steak on our table and walked away. I'm sorry if the chef and waitstaff are snobs about their mediocre steak but we are paying for it, and want it done how we want to eat it. My recommendation is to save your money and find a good steakhouse or stay at home and enjoy a better piece of meat than The Strip Club has to offer, at about 1/5 of the price."], ["Nancy C.", "Wow, people sure seem to like this place but we generally thought the meal was underwhelming for the price. From the exterior, the restaurant is in a super run-down looking building and didn't even look like it was in business at 7pm on a Friday. When we walked in, the lighting was EXTREMELY dim.We made reservations for a party of 4 to have dinner here for the first time. As soon as I sat down and looked at the menu, I noticed the \"$2.75 for steak/fish sauce\" as an a la carte item and immediately had a feeling this is the type of restaurant that will overcharge you for everything. If you serve a great steak, people shouldn't want sauce with it. And if they're paying $36 for a 10oz new york strip, or $42 for a filet (with NO sides), you can probably afford to provide the sauce at no cost. Our waiter was friendly but seemed a little pushy on getting us to order apps, so 2 of us ordered the meat skewers while 2 of us got these carnitas. You get 2 meat skewers, which have 2 pieces of tenderloin each, for $6.50. These looked so puny and sorry when they were set down at our table, and one of my pieces was overly done while the other seemed to be medium rare. Also, I love salt, and these tasted extremely salty to me. I felt like the dim lighting was there to hide the imperfections of the food they served. I ordered duck breast while my SO ordered the NY strip. Once we got our entrees, it was clear why the waiter kept getting us to order apps and sides. The portion sizes were pathetic. Normally, I get full really easily, but I finished the 6 slices of duck breast and whatever little grain they had in the dish, and still felt really hungry. I will say that the taste of the duck was very good, but that's expected when I pay $26 + tip and tax. The cheapest way to fill up there is probably to order their giant tater tots, which tasted pretty good on the outside, but the inside was basically unseasoned hash browns. I understand this is \"new\" american cuisine, but it doesn't mean cutting portion sizes in half. Especially for the neighborhood that this is in, it's actually kind of appalling. I actually feel bad for people who have never experienced this type of cuisine, and just come here and assume this style of food justifies the prices. To top this whole experience off, our waiter dropped off our bill and didn't even bother to split it by couple. We didn't feel like staying there any longer and going through the hassle, so we just split this down the middle."], ["Toby S.", "My girlfriend and I went to The Strip Club to celebrate my birthday. \u00a0It's a place I wanted to check outThe service was great. \u00a0The place's style is cool but some of the tables are crowded into places and the place was loud. \u00a0You couldn't hear each at all.Food gave us mixed opinions. \u00a0Everything is a la carte including things like the house steak sauce for $2.75 that tasted a bit better than Heinz 57 sauce.The soup was good. The salad was great. \u00a0The fish special I had was near perfection, flavors and textures were flawlessly blended. \u00a0The steak we ordered was good but found a bit more gristle and fat than I would expect. \u00a0Maybe I expected too much. \u00a0For the amount of money I expect to be able to hold a conversation and be well fed. \u00a0It is just too pricey for me to eat on a regular basis and didn't impress me enough to go back on a special occasion."], ["Moody S.", "PROS: We went to the Strip Club on a Saturday for brunch and had a great time. The food was exceptional. I went with a group of 4, and we all shared our orders. Everything was cooked to perfection and there were no misses whatsoever. The service was probably one of the best I experienced in a long time. The server was very personable and had excellent knowledge of the menu as well as recommendations.CONS: Seating is cramped and limited.PARKING: Parking was a little bit of a challenge.

It's a smaller restaurant so you'll want to be sure to make reservations, but sitting at the bar is always an option (and great). \u00a0Try their specialty drinks--Maryanne and Ginger is one of my favorites, but I've never been disappointed.

You get on that shit and make a reservation! That was the case for me. Michael Larson of the Eat Shop suggested that my wife and I try the Strip Club. Two of his good friends (Tim and JD) are owner/chef of one of the neatest little spots in town, The Strip Club. One look at the menu and we knew it was for us and I called for brunch reservations.I took the whole fam-damily for a little Saturday brunch event, and we couldn't have been happier. The space was so inviting and unique. I imagine that it can get really wild on a busy night, but Saturday morning brunch was pretty laid back, which was good, because the adults in the party were a little hung over from a previous evening of tomfoolery. Our server greeted us with a big smile and heartfelt \"hello\", then quickly brought us some fantastic bloody marry's. Despite the fairly short menu, we all had a really difficult time trying to decide what to have.I went with the steak and eggs... hell, if they're going to call the place the \"Strip Club\", they had better be able to provide a decent steak, and did they ever. It was fantastic. The accompanying fries were great as well and the eggs were done perfectly.My wife and mom went with the Tenderloin Schiacciatta and Irish Breakfast respectively. The Schiacciatta almost looked too beautiful to eat and the near tartare beef that it came with was magnificent. The standout part of the Irish Breakfast was the sausage. Scratch made, it had a wonderful depth of flavor that just made you want to savor every bite.My kids were also very pleased. My younger eater dove into the pancakes and bacon she ordered from the \"sides\" menu and my son was really excited about his burger with a fried egg (and to see an ornery teenager smile so wide over a burger is a great sight indeed).We, of course had to sample other libations aside from the bloodies that we started with. A real standout was \"Tequila, Wey\". I love tequila, and cinnamon, and ancho chilies and this was one hell of a combination of those flavors.My personal policy is to never give a five star review for a first visit, but damn, I cant think of any way to improve on the experience we had.

Complete sear (char marks and all) with the ever so slight change in color gradient all the way to the warm red exactly medium rare middle.

I was a bit disappointed - I bring my red meat loving man to a steakhouse for his birthday and he orders poultry? Then I tried some of the duck. He loves duck, but it's not always done well so he decided to roll the dice, betting these folks could do it right.

Mostly savory, but there was a hint of sweetness in the vinaigrette that together with the chili spice really knocked my socks off. The scrambled eggs were done just perfectly, neither hard nor runny. It came with a side of toast.My wife had the Italian Breakfast. The Italian sausage was very fresh tasting and had enough spice to wake up your sinuses, but not overwhelming. It came with pesto and marinara on toast with fried eggs. She said she'd love to have that marinara on pasta some time.It's a little on the pricey side, we paid about $45 for the two of us, a good chunk of which was the $7 tap beers (2).

The pork sandwich was breaded and very, very, very dry; with a very bland homemade mayo or something. Then the cheeseburger; juicy, bloody----bland (the most tasteless burger ever). As with many Minneapolis restaurants, The Strip Club also tries to be far too \"cute\" and creative with the simplest of things.

The servers are very sweet and accommodating. We had the fried cauliflower with sheep's milk for dipping, kofta meatballs, and vegetable tagine (individual portion). It was an appropriate amount of food for two to be satiated, but not super full. Hubby went home and ate a big cookie afterwards hehee. The cauliflower had great texture, but it was really salty. The kofta meatballs were seasoned really well, but I wish they came with more mint and sauce. The vegetable tagine was heavy on the chickpeas which were just slightly more al dente than I would like. The cilantro made the dish, and there wasn't enough of it so we requested more for the table.The front of the restaurant has great ambiance, but the bathrooms are a huge disconnect. It's like walking into a strip mall bathroom. It's a shame because otherwise it's a lovely space."], ["Anna H.", "Great decor, nice middle eastern menu. The drinks are awesome, but the food is a little too salty.The service was ok. However, there was a survey along with the check that the waitress had either forgotten to take out, or filled out herself, indicating that the service was a 5/5. I'd say more like a 3. Saffron is overpriced for the quality of food and service given."], ["Betty S.", "My lovely friends took me here for my birthday last year and I was very excited because they have a unique menu with small plates such as Octopus \"A La Plancha\" and Lamb Brain for the daring! Unfortunately, the overall experience left us with a lot to be desired...The food wasn't all that spectacular and the service was horrendous. It was probably an off night of sorts but our server was very rude, unfriendly, and not helpful at all. The manager checked on us and resolved the situation but it did leave us with a bad impression. The Sauteed Parisian Gnocchi was a bit dense and tough. The Roasted Chicken wasn't too memorable. The consensus around the table - it wasn't worth the upscale price. The portions were smaller too so we left pretty unsatisfied. The highlight was the dessert for sure. Get the Chocolate & Coconut and don't forget the Turkish coffee!"], ["Rajesh M.", "Great falvours.. Mutton chops was one the best I \u00a0had.. Pricey.. Ambience and service wa really good.. Ok drink options"], ["Louise M.", "Ah.. Restaurant Week. Time to eat well for cheap! With the recent Yelp hype of Saffron, I wasn't disappointed in the least to follow suit. There were several Yelpers in the dining room tonight, it could have been a Yelp event. I was able to say hey to Kara D and her party just in time after they devoured the lamb brain. Saffron was a great suggestion and we had a great delicious meal here tonight.We had reservation at 7:15 PM and they called at 5:00 PM to confirm. When we got there, the restaurant was half empty. It didn't stay half empty for long as by 8, it was a full house. They seated us right away though we were early, and we had a nice table overlooking the whole restaurant. I had expected the place to be fancier and dressier; however, it was not at all stuffy and fancy. It was perfectly carried out like a Michelin star restaurant as far as service with a more demure and casual atmosphere. I kinda liked it and it was a bit cool to get the over the top service while my check won't be over $100.We started with the octopus a la plancha. It was a tiny plate consisted of four pieces of octopus in oily sauce with paprika and garlic. It started the meal so well as the octopus pieces were tender, and so flavorful. That oil sauce was explosion of flavors.. You could taste spices, brine, coarse salt, and so much smokiness but not overwhelming. I was really into it and could eat the whole thing myself and order one more. The octopus was not easy to cut but yet when you use your teeth, it was tender as tender can be. It was wonderful.The poached lobster salad was worth the $6 upcharge. It felt very french and it was light. Can't hate the soft cooked egg though it was so four years ago. It still helped dressed the salad quite beautifully along with the tarragon champagne dressing.The fingerling potatoes two ways, with some being sliced thin and crisped up was perfect for texturing. I enjoyed this simple salad and the lobsters were great. It's simple, subtle, yet refined.I went with the braised chicken and prawn while my friend went with the Greek Lamb Cassoulet. I love Cassoulet but I am a lamb hater. If not, I would have always gone with Cassoulet. My friend loved her dish and she said the giant beans soaked in all the sauce and it was vivid flavoring all around. I had a taste but I was turned off by the gaminess of the lamb. It wasn't their fault. I'm just not into lamb but the dish was bold, colorful, and served beautifully in a hot plate.My chicken dish was heaven. It felt so comforting. The chicken leg was so tender but it didn't lose its integrity. Being a big fan of braising method, that chicken has been simmered awhile to have that type of blossoming flavor. Again, the paprika was very pronounced and the prawns were plump and I had fun sucking on the head. The chickpeas that were the bed for the chicken and the prawns were crunchy and it was just great texture. I really really enjoyed my entr\u00e9e. It was a dish properly prepared. It was delicious!Mascarpone Panna Cotta was a perfect segue to dessert and it almost served as palette cleanser as it was very delicate and subtle. Surprisingly, it was really fun to eat and savor. I loved mixing it up with the sliced grapes and the crumbles of pistachio and some other crumbs I couldn't name. It was tiny but we spent the whole twenty minutes that we had left on the parking meter savoring this dessert. We started with this one as we thought the Chocolate and Turkish Coffee Trifle would overwhelm our tastebud. It was a great choice but after we were done with the panna cotta, we were both so satisfied we didn't need the second dessert. The trifle was fine. The milk chocolate pudding and the coffee granita were nice. I'm not a fan of the cardamom cake but it was fine. It was a proper dessert and fitting to the cuisine.We had a pretty successful meal with impeccable service. We saw Saed Wadi mingling and talking to customers, while Sameh Wadi was in the back but bringing food back and forth to this one table by us. That was cool. If I had one tiny criticism was the entrees were both a bit overseasoned with salt. However, it wasn't so much that I couldn't handle it. I still gave Saffron five stars as quite honestly, I wasn't at all prepared to be blown away on Restaurant Week. However, they gave us a stellar meal at discounted price.I would love to go back and try their regular menu. The RW's tasting menu for $30 was hard to beat. They really made it right using the event to make people fall in love and come back for more. I really could see how Chef Wadi held his own against Morimoto on Mackerel battle. The foods were fantastic here. Awesome job, Saffron. Very well done!Oh btw..I have eaten at Daniel Boulud's restaurants, as well as restaurants of Iron Chefs Morimoto, Puck, Batali, Symon, Garces, and Flay. I am also a James Beard Foundation Member. I hope I'm qualified to write this review. :)"], ["Alejandro L.", "I had bigger hopes for this place based on World Street Kitchens great recipes (same owner and chef), and even though it was a good experience, it wasn't fantastic."], ["Kara D.", "5 stars for our Restaurant Week experience!I didn't ask my friends if they wanted to go here during RW, but TOLD them I had already made reservations. The night started perfectly, with easy and cheap street parking, a pleasantly un-packed dining room, and a cocktail quickly in hand. I loved the Saffron Rose. I think I have a problem, because when I first saw the small elegant glass I worried if there was enough alcohol in it for me, but alas, there was! Our server was bubbly and in great spirits. Which I always commend more so on RW nights because the poor things are repeating the same crap over and over again.We couldn't not order the lamb brain. It was recommended on a talk thread, plus I said I'd try it so I couldn't look like a pussy now. The whole table (4 ppl) enjoyed it, but it was such a small serving that I don't think I got enough to go by from my 1/4 of a bite. It had a mild taste and tender texture, and the garlic and tomatoes were delicious accompaniments. We asked for pita bread to soak up the rest of the flavors and grey matter mmm. A highlight of the night was the smoked trout app - it had every flavor you would ever want on one balanced plate - savory, sweet, smokey, fresh... ahhh. I ordered the chicken and prawns. I usually don't order chicken, but this was falling off the damn bones into a mouth-watering sauce and I was grateful that I allowed this to be in my life. Another favorite was the lamb dish, which was not too game-y but packed with bold flavors. I'm so f'ing hungry right now.Oh, and Saed Wadi magically appeared at our table like a mythical creature. He was hilarious and helped us take photos of our food by setting up some sick ass iphone flashlight lighting. We had a good laugh and like that, he was gone. Did we dream this?We loved both the Mascarpone Panna Cotta and Chocolate and Turkish Coffee Trifle desserts. The trifle paired heavenly with the house-chosen port. So much so that when the server merely walked up to us, my friend pulled her trifle and port towards herself and basically hissed at the server. That's my girl."], ["Evan K.", "Came here for business dinner and was satisfied but not overly impressed. Cocktails were delicious. Had the Halibut and several appetizers. Our waiter did a great job and was very attentive to our needs.

This is one of their favorite places so i went here. I found the place just okay.First trip: Had wine and selection of Traditional Spreads including Hummus, Lentils and Eggplants. They replaced feta with hummus on my request, which was nice of them. Pita breads and Hummus were really tasty but lentils and eggplant was just okay. Pinot they poured was great.Second Trip: I had Vegetable Tangine and beer. Tangine was just okay too, not bad \u00a0but not great either. Tangine is little expensive for the quality.Service is really fast. I dined at bar so maybe its because of that but my food got served within 5 minutes of order. Staff is friendly.I would give 3.5 stars as that's not the option, i would go for 4."], ["Karl W.", "Anticipating Saffron might be the reason that I was a bit disappointed overall. The cocktails were the highlight of the night. Both the Heart Beets cocktail (containing beet juice and absinthe) and Saffron Rose (champagne rose) we're very good. For the entrees, the Pork chops were very flavorful, but limited with meat and physically had to gnaw on the bone. Chicken with eggplant overall was good, chicken was perfectly cooked. For the bad, both the green beans and Brussel sprouts came highly recommended. The sprouts were terrible, half cooked at best and hard. Green beans were ok but should have been served warm in my opinion. Came early on a Wednesday which might have been the issues I saw, or the kitchen was off. Either way, Saffron is one of the top rated restaurants in the city and will certainly venture here again with a different menu selection."], ["David D.", "Saffron is very large, and spacious, and the host greeted me graciously. There is a cool bar area, as well as the more formal, but very open-concept dining room.My server was attentive and extremely pleasant, super cool guy. I had to pour my own water a couple times, and they don't do the fancy things such as match your linen to your clothing, but otherwise the staff was helpful.I had a few items, as I wanted to experience something different while keeping it slightly healthy. I was interested to hear about how the Branzino and various items are sourced from Greece! This is real-deal Mediterranean, but with a little flair. ;)Here's what I had:1) Charred Octopus -- very good. Tender inside, crisp on the outside, and cooked in an ever-so lightly spiced olive oil. I enjoyed it tremendously. Decent portion. Reminded me of Kanella back home in Philadelphia2) Garden Salad -- also very good. They offer very interesting salads at Saffron and this was well sized without being overwhelming. Lots of different tastes going on here3) Brussel Sprouts -- cooked to my liking in that they were tender, but the sauce was very heavy with a truffle oil that I found overpowering. I plowed through anyway!4) Seafood Tangine -- Tasty dish, but to be honest, didn't knock my socks off. I'm a big fish eater and enjoy all the textures, which was lost here in the tangine concoction. Don't get me wrong, the seafood was excellent, fresh, good portions, eclectic (shellfish, white fish), and the vegetables in particular were soft and enjoyable, however, everything seemed to blend in a way that lost some of the sophistication of the different tastes but didn't take it up a notchI bailed on dessert, since I felt like a pig at this point! Would definitely go back when craving Mediterranean"], ["Alexander V.", "Wow.Duck meatballs for the win.I had some lamb, it was okay. Then the duck meatballs came out and blew this experience out of the water.Great flavor. The sauce was spectacular. We dipped so much bread into the sauce!I was unsure of this place because the curb appeal is a bit lacking. I walked into a wide open dining concept. Almost too wide open, it felt a bit empty with the layout, but that's probably a good thing when this place fills up.The service was good.I can't gush enough about the duck meatballs though, try them!"], ["Andrew T.", "The food has real decent flavor. It doesn't open up until about 5:00 pm. The entrees are a little pricy in my opinion ($20-$40). I had a cocktail which was very unique and flavorful - it had Apple Jack whiskey and homemade pomegranate grenadine. It was only $5.00 for happy hour but it was very small. I had the Mid-eastern sausage appetizer which I found pretty good. It had pine nuts in the meat which was unique, and it came with some pretty decent pita bread. The sauce was pretty heavy on the lemon juice, however - almost overwhelming. I also ordered the Parisian Gnocchi which was tasty. The flavor was there, but the portion size was very small considering the price. It did have black truffle in it so that may have contributed a little. Some tasty greens, carrots, peas, corn, green beans, raddish, and asparagus. There was a little sauce which was good, and the spices were really good. This place is unique so give it a try - a solid 4 out of 5."], ["Cindy T.", "I've been here for two different birthdays and I wasn't sure what I thought at first. The restaurant is dark and classy, with high ceilings and different types of seating. Maybe I am not a fan of fusion food. However, the dishes I've tried are nothing to complain or rave about. I've had the pear salad, a fig appetizer, gnocchi, hummus, fried cauliflower, lamb brain, lamb chops, and a bite of one of the tagines. This is not the best food I've had, but it's solid/good.One thing I must mention are the drinks. They are wonderful! My personal favorites are the 1999, aviator, and heart-beet (which tastes oddly healthy and sweet!). The bartenders here know their stuff."], ["Kev H.", "Restaurant week! An excuse to pack on a few extra calories and expand the waistline without damaging one's bottom line. Made a reservation through opentable, was called day of by the restaurant confirming my reservation status. Arrived a little bit early, but I was seated almost right away.Inside the ambiance is classy trendy without that air of snootyness. There is a laid back vibe here, but one that can lend itself to dates, group celebrations, or just a casual get together.There is a one page drink menu, and a one page menu that lists some plates to share, some apps, and some entrees. On the restaurant week menu was the list of menu items for the 3 course prix fixe menu.The starter options consisted of a watermelon salad or a cucumber soup (an additional option where you add $6 for some kind of seafood item, but I don't remember what it was). The entree let you pick between lamb with lentils or gnocci (a 3rd option, +$6, was a crab type dish). The dessert had you picking between pana cotta and a chocolate bread pudding.I started with the soup. Out came a shallow plate/dish with some whitish tzatsiki looking sauce. The waiter then proceeded to pour a thick green soup onto the plate, creating an appealing looking contrast of colors. The green part was savory, the white part was a little on the sour side, and together they created a whole different flavor palate. Quite a fun little dish. (My friend went the watermelon route. When it came out, I thought it was pieces of tuna sashimi, as it was plated like a Japanese sushi plate. Tried some, flavors were crisp and clean, with some spicyness added to it).The lamb came out, laying atop a bed of lentils. It wasn't aggressively seasoned, and it lacked that strong lamb flavor that some people may find off putting. All in all, a well cooked lamb with great flavor that paired excellently with the crisp, almost crunchy lentils.Now the dessert - the bread pudding came out, with a crumble of nuts laying atop and a pool of caramel on the side of the pudding. I carefully crafted a single bite that would contain all the above elements, and proceeded to try it. In a word, amazing! It was decadent without feeling too rich. I could have eaten probably like 5 entire plates of it, but I managed to reign it in.All in all, good ambiance, spot on dishes that deliver, and some friendly, attentive waitstaff. I'd definitely come here again.Apparently this means I need to check out World street kitchen now?"], ["Don C.", "This was my first time at Saffron.We had reservations, but got there early enough to relax with a couple of drinks.

The salad had beets, goat's milk yogurt, brown butter, tarragon and pistachios. \u00a0I thought it was a very tasty combination of flavors.The roasted chicken was very easy and mouth watering. \u00a0It was made with eggplant lovash, tahini and exotic spices that brought out the chicken's natural flavor. \u00a0It was prepared so it remained moist and juicy, but not too drippy. \u00a0Again, I liked it and would do that again.Laurie's Seafood Tagine and Brussel sprouts were good too. \u00a0I sampled both and really liked the spices used on the Brussel sprouts.All in all, a great evening of dining that makes Saffron worth a revisit."], ["Aaron M.", "I've been here four times and I liveIn tampa. \u00a0Would I make the trip just for the restaurant???

I could probably eat here on a weekly basis. Moving back from AZ i happened to miss all of the great Latin American food I used to eat. This place it spot on. It is Ecuadorian so the flavors are rich but not overpowering and the spice, a little sweeter. I had the Saltado with chicken and it was the perfect dinner portion. The veggies were perfect, not overdone and soggy, they were still very crispy and my chicken, oh so tender. My boyfriend had the encocado which was mahi mahi, also superb. They have a ton of GF options for my fellow celiac's which is becommig a little more common but almost the entire menu is GF. If you are a fan of HOLA Arepa, you will love this joint. About the place, the place itself is tiny, but buzzing. We went on Friday night \u00a0about 8pm and had about a 20 minute wait. The wait is well worth it but plan ahead bc this place was still hopping after the dinner rush. The restaurant maybe seats maybe 40 total? It's quite small but that is part of the charm. Also, beer and wine only so don't get your heart set on a tequila. \u00a0:) Eat on!!!!"], ["Sue S.", "So this is not my normal choice for cuisine, but I have to say I was really pleasantly surprised. A friend chose the place and we met up for an early brunch. I started with a mimosa, lured in by the options that extended beyond the traditional orange juice. I chose a mango mimosa, and it was really pretty decent. A nice way to start a meal.For food, there were lots of options that were explained well on the menu. We did find the staff's menu knowledge to be a bit average. One server had to ask another what the special was, the question of what was in the offered tamale seemed to perplex them for a few minutes. But overall I did not have any trouble figuring out what was being offered and choosing an option. I went with the llapingachos, which were described as cheese-stuffed potato pancakes. They were actually more like pillowy potato cakes in the way of like a crab cake... not potato pancakes like latkes. They were griddled and really delicious. Add thick smoky bacon and two eggs, plus a side of generously buttered toast, and it was really very good. There was also an accompanying cup of green sauce that was SUPER spicy. I only tasted a bit and then put it aside but I liked the option for any spice lovers out there. It was really a pretty satisfying and different brunch. The people I was with all reported positive reviews for their items -- I was a bit too consumed with my own food, but the chorizo is more like kielbasa sausage format than chopped up and crumbly, and my buddy said the omelet was really good. That's what I know.Service, as I alluded to above, was kind of hit or miss. Everyone was very nice, but things took a long time and seemed a bit disorganized. We were told by our friends who had been there before that they had never experienced bad service before, so maybe it was just an off day. We arrived at 10 and by the time we left, there were people lined up in the hallway waiting for a table. Seems very popular on the weekends.All in all though, it was not a fancy place but serves up some really good eats and (from all I can tell) some pretty authentic food. Really great. I can't wait to come back and try dinner.Oh, pro tip: there's a small parking lot in the back behind the restaurant."], ["Sasidhar K.", "Here's the truth.. Before trying out this restaurant, I have never had South American cuisine..and don't even know how to pronounce the names on the menu.

The staff were friendly and I was suggested the Ilapingachos and Shrimp Encocado.The service was really fast.. I got my entree even before I could eat one of the Ilapingachos.. which by the way tasted really good. Cheese stuffed potato pancakes over eggs...that's one good breakfast. Shrimp Encocado was shrimp cooked in coconut curry. It had good seasoning and the portion was just about right..So, don't shy away from ordering all to yourself. :)I'm stripping off a star, coz it's too small, cramped parking and the wait could really be frustrating.I would definitely go there again... and again."], ["Lisa M.", "Everything was delicious!Alright, I'm going to be honest, I am not known to get up early to go out to breakfast, but on a recent Sunday, I was.We tried to hit up another place with a really long wait. \u00a0I would normally wait, but it was cold out, no place to stand and I just wasn't in the mood. \u00a0So, we decided to cross the river and hit up Chimborazo. \u00a0Neither of us had ever been there before, but we are glad we chose this place. \u00a0It was still early, so not busy at all. \u00a0I couldn't decide on that to get, ended up choosing the Llapingachos with over easy eggs and roast pork and a DC. \u00a0My husband had some egg scramble or some special or something like that.

The soup that came with it was so comforting, a Peruvian version of chicken soup with carrots, potatoes and onions. My friends from South America agrees that this is one of the best authentic dinner places in the twin cities that tasted similar to home. This place is small and they don't take RSVP so expect 20-30 minutes wait on a weekend.

First, be aware that the service here is a bit slower (one waitress serving the whole lunch time). We came within the last hour it was open for lunch (around 2:15pm) and it still took little over an hour to order, scarf food down, and pay. That being said, the service was good and she came to our times multiple times in between to check on us.Second, Yucca fries are good -- crunchy but a bit tart. It comes with salsa on top and a bit of lime/lemon juice on bottom, and a dipping sauce on the side. The lemon and salsa reminded me of ceviche and while my boyfriend liked it; i prefer yucca fries american style like Muddy waters. Again, he loved it, but just not my kinda thing.Third, croquettes are delicious and bit sweeter. This was little surprising to us as we typically have croquettes that are more savory. Fourth, Cerdo sandwich is amaze-balls. If you like carnitas or roast pork, this bad boy is for you. The savory pork was perfectly matched with the sweet plantains and the bread was lightly toasted with butter. I drool as I type about my lunch order. I ordered it with side of quinoa veggie soup which was also delicious. I typically am not a fan of quinoa but this soup was more of a vegetable soup than quinoa. Definitely definitely recommend.Fifth, churrasco (flank steak with plantains, fried egg, rice, beans, and fries) was delicious. Steak was chewier than we typically like (medium done) but seasoning was on point. Everything was good although I am not a huge fan of the beans (just seem bland relative to everything else we had).Finally, Tres Leches cake. I love Tres Leches and this place did not disappoint. The portion is perfect for two people to share. The pound cake is actually more dense than other tres leches I had but I kind of prefer it this way because it holds the sauce better. Will definitely order this again.Parking was easy (private lot and decent street parking). Will be coming back to try other items!"], ["Aaron L.", "Ok the place was great, small but great!Service was awesome and very attentive to our request and when any delays they will let know ahead of time..

It's filling, yet refreshing and light enough for me to still sample my friends' Churrasco and Encocado (both amazing).It's a pretty small place, so I usually go for an early or late meal.

We got into our little food routine and never really ventured the two extra blocks north on Central. Like I said - morons. Chimborazo is SO DAMN GOOD. The word authenticity sort of bums me out because it's usually such a weird post-colonial objectification of culture, but this restaurant really IS authentic. The food is beautifully reminiscent of the Andes and the staff and owner are as welcoming, friendly, and hospitable as can be. My hubby and I got the yuca frita (fried yuca), which were crispy on the outside and deliciously soft on the inside, drizzled with some lemon, garlic, and a little tomato and pepper salsa. My man got the llupingachos con chorizo - basically crispy little potato pillows stuffed with cheese and fried or something to make 'em nice and crispy, served with a chorizo link, rice, and an egg, along with a little tasty sauce. I'd tell you all about it, but he wasn't really willing to share. That means it was gooooood, because I can be very convincing!I opted for the ecuadoriano vegetariano, which was red beans, llapingachos, a slice of sweet fried plantain, and a salad, along with a crazy-delicious muchin de yuca, which is basically a chewy little yuca fritter. It's amazing. We also tried out brunch, which was equally rewarding and delectable.

You could tell he knew and loved everything they make! He said they like to focus on those little details that can make a big difference in taste and presentation. Yay!

Yuca fries were great - especially the sauce, which we asked for more of. The tostones were good, too. Again the sauce killed it. A chorizo, egg and corn meal cake concoction, which came with another peanutty-chimichurri type sauce, was wonderful. Also tried some sort of flank steak stew that had great flavor. I highly recommend."], ["Andrew L.", "Love! Love! Love! This little restaurant. This place has wonderful authentic South American food. Every meal I have had there has been top notch.

I can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet! This was where I celebrated my 21st birthday dinner with a few of their absolutely delicious mojitos. This was where my roommates and I toasted the end of our college years together. This is where my friends and I go for dinner after a long, hard week. This tiny little place has a piece of my heart! (Speaking of tiny, if you plan on going with more than 3-4 people, you'll want to call ahead and make a reservation.)I've never really gone wrong with anything on the menu, but my favorites include the yuca (though it still doesn't beat Brasa's for me), empanadas, lechon asado, ropa viejo, and the ensalada tropical. As for drinks, any of the tropical mimosas or mojitos are excellent. Victor's is one of the places that I make sure NOT to skip dessert either: their passion mango cheesecake blew my mind and I always have it when I'm there. Although I just saw that they do have a mojito sorbet...considering that I am in love with Sebastian Joes + mojitos at Victors + mojitos in general, this may be my new dessert order. If it's any kind of good weather, you MUST get out on the patio! Though there are often plenty of bugs flying around and trying to nom on some of your delicious meal, it's a cozy little patio that has a really great energy and people-watching as well.

I got the scrambled eggs with chorizo, ham, onions and pepper (I forget what it's called), and unfortunately I was not at all impressed. It was very bland and the chorizo was not cooked enough to bring out the flavors. Perhaps that was not the best item on the menu, but it was a recommendation by the staff... They had very limited things that were actually Cuban on their menu. It was so cute that I am tempted to give it another shot, but there are so many other places to try in Minneapolis that I don't know if I will bother."], ["Kurt M.", "It's past time for an update on my original, minimalist review of Victor's. As a semi-frequenter of this spot for breakfast, my endorsement hasn't changed. I'll add that the corn pancakes are delicious and frankly I can't imagine the hungriest of souls who wouldn't be filled by a stack of two of these tasty flapjacks. For me one is more than satisfying. The Professor Stavrou is a favorite as are the Cuban Scrambler and Cuban Hash. The Rancho Cubano is also a solid choice.The other night I stopped here with a couple of buddies for dinner. I should come here more often. I ordered the Lechon Asado, pulled pork roasted in garlic and lime topped with grilled onions. It came with yuca frita, a great alternative to potato fries and black beans and rice. Wonderfully flavorful, fresh and filling. FYI, Cuban food is not typically highly spiced so I added generous dollops of hot sauce to bring up the heat. One friend ordered the Fricasee De Pollo, chicken breast pieces stewed in a savory tomato based red sauce with onions, red & green peppers. The other friend had the Bistec Encebollado, strip steak marinated in lime mojo, topped with grilled onions & served with tostones. \u00a0From the general lack of conversation, the periodic nodding of heads and the occasional grunt of satisfaction I gathered that they found their dishes much to their liking.For dessert we decided to share an order of Xango Chango (think of this as a lighter, non-greasy, more evolved form of churros filled with custard and served with a guava puree) and a slice of Passion Mango Cheesecake (rich, dense, sweet without being cloying). Added three cups of Cafe Cubano and we were campistas muy felices!Service at the counter was fun and friendly. Prices very reasonable. They do take reservations and on most nights you'd be well advised to make them. Couldn't plan ahead?

It embodies summer. I've always had great service, both dine-in and to-go.Food:As I mentioned above, it's incredible. It took me back to Key West. I think the best time to go is dinner (though brunch is fun!). I always order the lechon asado - flavorful and tender. The yuca, beans and rice are standard. The plantains are excellent. Try the 'red espresso'My only complaints are: they don't have Sangria or guava pastries, and the Cuban Bread is subpar; it was basically a hamburger bun :("], ["Daniel L.", "A prolonged craving for Cuban cuisine brought me to this neighborhood in search of an authentic fare. Fellow Yelper Fia R and I arrived at opening for dinner and were very fortunate to snag the last table after all others had already been reserved. The venue reminded me of a wooden shack with sharp and contrasting colors adorned from the inside out. The few posters, light bulbs, and flags were overshadowed by handwriting of all possible fonts at every turn. We started with the Tostones ($4.75) that came with green plantains smashed, fried, and sprinkled with mojo, garlic, and green onions. The Tostones were unevenly fried, causing a mix of stiff and hard textures that were difficult to bite into. This is a stark contrast to those I had at Flor De Mayo, and thought the subtle hint of garlic could be more pronounced.The highlight of the meal was the Ropa Vieja ($14.95). As one of their signature dishes, the shredded flank steak was tender and juicy. The red sauce did a great job at keeping it moist and the mix of peas, garlic, onions, green and red peppers created some depths in the flavor. The plantains and mango salad were deliciously addictive, but the black bean rice was too dry and flavorless. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the Lechon Asado ($13.75) since the pulled pork wasn't as juicy as the previous dish. The pork had a nice mix of savory and lime flavors but I wished the onions could be better integrated to add complexity. The choice of white rice covered with black beans was spot on moist and delicious, and the fried yucca had some stiff spots and mango salad was again irresistible. I advice interested customers to make observations in advance. They have four choices of rice so I recommend people to opt for white rice covered with black beans over the one that is cooked together. People should also be aware that ventilation isn't the best so it's easy to walk out with the fantastic food smell that lingered for us. Service was very cheerful and friendly, but dwindled once the place became super busy. The ingredients were very fresh and conceptually sound. I only wished the execution was more thoughtful and consistent. I'd be interested in coming back to try their breakfast items."], ["Alexander M.", "Such a surreal experience eating here!

I had the bistec encebollado....onioned steak. It was fantastic. A little sweet from the caramelized onion, meaty, a little salty, buttery....delish. Served with some fried platain that was perfectly cooked with just a touch of char on the edges to give it some texture. (I don't know why more restaurants don't use this veggie/fruit. It's so tasty and you can do so much with it). Plus they make EXCELLENT moros y crisitanos (rice and beans). This is such an easy dish yet because it is a side so many people ignore it.,..big mistake...huge. Beans are a staple for many cultures and should never be a second thought when you can do so much to them and they are so cheap to serve your patrons while filing them up. The rice is flavorful. The beans are flavorful and together they are super tasty.I also had a guava mimosa. It was just ok. HUGE serving. Didn't really taste the guava though.

We stumbled upon this while in Saint Paul visiting my parents. I imagined a place called Red Cow would have burgers. I was right! And boy, was I happy to have found this place. It's awfully dark in here (away from the bar) but since the food is so good, I guess I don't need to see it. I just want to photograph it for Yelp!

Get the ahi tuna crisps. Eat a burger (even the turkey burger is good but if you're going to get a burger you might as well go all out and get one filled with bacon that oozes all over your hands and drips onto the fries when you bite into it). Oh, and get dessert!!!!! Order dessert or forever hold your peace when your dining partner's dessert comes out and you feel the need to beg for a bite.

Nice, attentive, informative, all the good things you want bundled up in your server. \u00a0Each time the food was consistently good. \u00a0Its rare to find a place that is mouth dropping good every single time!!!!The Food-I am going to list everything I have tried, whether its been a bite or the entire thing, I will give my opinion.The Cowboy Burger-I know I live in the concrete city but I am still a country girl at heart and this was my first thing I ever ate here at the Cow..When I was presented with this Beast of a Burger, I had no idea how I was going to tackle it so I did it slowly. \u00a0I ate the onion rings first which I loved and I am not an onion ring type of gal but these were perfect. \u00a0Underneath the onion rings, was Root Beer Pulled Pork.....I dipped it in my side of BBQ and I could hear Keith Urban singing in my ear! \u00a0So so Sweet!! By this time, I am full and I haven't even touched the burger yet but I did manage to eat half and took the other half home. Bun was grilled perfectly and it was divine.Caramel Bacon Puffcorn-Mehhh...Not a fan.....Reminds me of that bagged Puff corn you can buy with a few chunks of bacon and light caramel sauce...Scotch Eggs-One of my favorite items here!!! \u00a0Yep, sausage wrapped around eggs, deep fried, and then dipped in tangy mustard makes my mouth happy happy!! I love arugula that dresses it too...I KNOW....crazy who eats that but I did and it was amazing. \u00a0It had a vinagarette on it that married well with the mustard. Happy Hour price is insane! Try them!!!Cheese Curds-They were good but not as good as I thought they would be due to my high expectations from all the raving reviews but I think I am just not a huge cheese curd lover.Maybe it has something to with Wisconsin and the Packers but nawww..wont order again.Tuna Ahi Crisps-I was leary because I am not one for raw fish but the tuna was seared perfectly and the wasabi sauce, and everything else that was incorporated in this appetizer, worked really well! \u00a0A steal at Happy Hour prices. \u00a0I would get this again.Poutine-Not a fan but I see everyone ordering it. \u00a0I think its me and the meat reminds me of a beef pot roast and I am just not a beef pot roast person....The cheese was bland to me and no......IMO...I know many people will disagree with me on this one!The fries, both regular and parmesan truffle were good. \u00a0Nothing I would take home but if they were piping hot, I would eat them. \u00a0If not, they will probably sit on my plate.The Mac and Cheese-Really good....Not spectacular but I tried it and it was a little bland but it was just the side dish of it so there was nothing in it.I know! I know!!! \u00a0Hard to believe I have tried this many things but hey, I told you!!!! \u00a0I was here all summer!!! \u00a0Almost finished........Bison Burger-Excellent flavors but I could never eat more than one bite. I don't like the dates.Ultimate Burger-One of the cheapest burgers on the menu but its great!!My NUMBER ONE thing I LOVE here is the Turkey Burger!!!!!!! Get it!!! \u00a0This is one of those items that I will not share with anyone......Don't even think of asking me for one bite! No wonder it won Best Turkey Burger award in the Twin Cities...I don't even dip it anything and you know how I like to dip everything in something! \u00a0Get the turkey burger with a side of Mac and Cheese or cheese curds. \u00a0Yes!! \u00a0Heres a tip!!! \u00a0You can get sides of Poutine, Mac and Cheese, Onion Rings instead of fries for an upcharge. \u00a0Just Do it!Desserts are not memorable at all so skip them....Come during Happy Hour for eats on the cheap and make sure you fill in and return the little card at the end to get mailed a $10 off coupon for your next visit!Anyone want to go cow tipping?"], ["Sarah S.", "Food coma food heaven-all I can say!!Some nights are meant to be perfect and this last Tuesday night was amongst them!!This was our first visit to Red Cow and since it was a week night we were anticipating a dull quiet night but I guess that's not how it happens at RC.We walked in at 9 and boy it was almost packed!!We got immediate seating on a high rise table which was fantastic, I'm not a big fan of standard tables and booths I either like the bar or high rise tables!!Our server Kareen was a delight, so helpful and informative about the menu!We started off with a few drinks.I got ice tea and champagne and my husband got some cocktail and a beer!The music was pretty loud it was hard to talk \u00a0but we still throughly enjoyed it.Kareen kept coming back to check on us!For food we split a Bison burger and substituted the fries with the cheese curds!The burger was a solid 9.Great bun,tender juicy pattie and lots of flavoring..it was cooked to perfection!The cheese curd were State Fair level, absolutely delicious!We split the burger so we could eat the dessert!For dessert we ordered the mini donuts with ice cream!It blew my pallet away!The donuts were so fresh they were breaking apart and the sweetness was perfect and the ice cream just made the combo deadly!A full 10 to the dessert!

I am an addict. I have now gone three times in 12 days to this place. Well, first time was drinks only, so I guess it's not all that bad. Although, if someone wanted to go again today I'd do it. Last year around winter time I had an Earl Grey infused old fashion at Coup d'\u00e9tat in uptown. I loved it. A couple months later they stopped serving it. Bitches. I found it on Red Cows drink menu as a \"new fashion!\" Yes! It was delicious, thank you Red Cow. For the beer lovers, they have a nice selection, there's something for each beer lover. Okay, now that my drink obsession is noted, onto the food. I've tried the cheese curds, scotch eggs, onion rings, parmesan truffle fries, sweet potato fries, French onion burger, 60/40, \u00a0Royal, and the avocado cheesecake. I'd order any of these items again, except for the cheesecake. It wasn't horrible, it tasted more like a key lime pie, I just wasn't into it. Make sure you get the cheese curds on your first trip. It's on my top three for best curds fo sho. I've never had scotch eggs before, so I have nothing to compare it too, but I know I'd eat these here everyday if I could. The mustard with the bitter greens are the perfect match with the eggs. All of the burgers I tried were AWESOME. It's now my mission to try each burger on the menu before I die. I like a medium temp, and the burgers were cooked perfectly to that. My favorite so far is the French onion. I really wanted the Manhattan 2.0 on my first dining visit, but decided on the 60/40. Then on my second trip my boyfriend said he was getting it, but switched to the Royale when the orders were placed!! So rude. I have to mention the bun on these burgers. I tried to think of any other time I've eaten a burger and said \"holy shit, this bun is amazing.\" I couldn't. I don't know if they make it in house or purchase it from a bakery up in heaven, but that bun though. Yuuumm. It holds it own next to the beef and toppings.Service has been top notch on each visit. Friendly, fast, and efficient. That's all I require. I like that there's consistency here. They keep a water carafe on the table, which I really appreciate. I absolutely hate running out of water and waiting on it. They do a great job. The only thing I'm not a huge fan of is the decor. Red is definitely one of my favorite colors, but the red in here screams trying to hard to me. Same with the faux brick, and the exposed beams that look too perfect to be natural.

The Cow on Selby was no exception!After a night of fancy dresses, masks, music and a gorgeous historic mansion (James J.

We were less than a mile away, so we decided to stop in for a bite and perhaps another cocktail (for me). There was hardly a wait, but the place looked packed and it was extremely loud. I was about to make an utterance of how much I already preferred the Cow in North Loop because this location looked tiny, crowded and noisy - but then - behold! - the lovely hostess lady led us UPSTAIRS with drink menus, happy hour and dinner menus in tow! I had no idea this place had a second level, and much to my delight, I was seriously into it. The clock had just struck 10:00pm so we made it on time for their 2nd happy hour of the day! $2 off Specialty Cocktails - thank you! I wanted the Death Rattle but then I took a quick look and realized the drink menu was not the same as the other locations, so I tried a new one - the \"75\". LOVED it.I got my old friend - the 60/40 with fries and a side of Red Cow Sauce (dill aioli). Sis got her Ultimate burger which she managed to tuck away quite nicely. Our server was so great, she refilled our water carafe about five times since we were drinking water like 2 camels who got lost in the desert.

My favorite is the cowboy burger which features a large onion ring, cheddar cheese, a bit of pulled pork and BBQ sauce on a fresh grilled burger. The only problem is that it is like 6 inches tall so it takes a little finagling to eat it. \u00a0The Manhattan 2.0 is also great and features bacon, Gruyere cheese, arugula and cherry red wine sauce. \u00a0You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu and really should try the cheese curds too.Like their Minneapolis cousin, parking is a bit tight (mainly street) but not much of an issue at lunch. \u00a0Great place to get your burger fix."], ["Ellie E.", "Today is, apparently, National Burger Day. \u00a0Since I love burgers, I decided to celebrate this wonderful holiday at Red Cow for lunch. \u00a0I sat at the bar and had the best time. \u00a0Travis was my... server?

This is my third attempt in writing a review for Red Cow St. Paul. I kept on going over Sam W's review and his very descriptive narration of how the 60/40 burger will make your mouth wetter than an expectant virgin. My last attempt in writing this review, I started talking about suicide bomber. Scratch that. The first one was even worse. But here we are and I wasn't too far off from the same notion that Sam's review was the reason for this visit. Just got to have that 60/40 burger and lo and behold, we were there. Dita was close in proselytize me onto the Manhattan Burger. Good thing Sam was in front of me and the Bacon Whisperer wasn't budging from his beloved burger. With that type of conviction, I was like.. Hell No. I came, I saw, and I conquered. But before Julius went to town, we got cheese curds. For Apollo's cock...that was truly the best cheese curd ever. The cheese was melting inside this airy funnel cake like batter. It was so good and it paired well with the berry ketchup it came with. I almost thought I'd give this place five stars! I went to the one in Edina and frankly, I thought it was just ok. However, I was totally hopeful with the Selby location after that curds.I was glad I stuck with the 60/40 like how I first pledged my allegiance to Sam's taste. Not my first time copying his order. What can I say. He's got a pretty good taste. The burger was simple but it was flavor explosion all over the place. I changed my cheese to swiss cheese and I added mushroom. That's how I like my burger and it was perfecto. The bacon flavor permeated in every nooks and crannies of the beef, keeping it smoky and juicy and coated my mouth with that yummy goodness called fat. I took a bite of the Manhattan, and though I did like it, the jam they put on it was a bit much for me. I didn't like my meat sweet. It was flavor confusion for me. I guess some stuff I like simple. The pork belly sliders Jenny ordered were pretty amazing too. However, the hunk of meat on my plate with beer mustard oozed on one side while trails of sweet pieces of bacon were falling off the bun got all my attention. Oh shit, I even forgot the amazing parmesan truffle fries!!! Get it! Just get it! Can't tell you how fabulous that was!!We ordered two things that weren't as amazing as the other foods I described above. First, Dita had to try the Tomato soup. Though they confirmed before ordering that it was hearty chunky type, she wanted to try. It was like eating spaghetti sauce. The lattice of balsamic reduction on top was euw. I didn't like it. We all took one spoon of taste and called it a day on the soup. The server didn't make a comment asking if we liked it or not looking and clearing that full cup of soup. However, in overall, He was okay and he did have the chef whipped up a handmade honey mustard to please Sam. It was good and made with love!The second bad thing was the Avocado Key Lime Cheesecake. Don't be brave. Don't try it. Don't be a hero. Everybody loses if you order this baby's poop dressed with whipped cream. It's total bullshit serving this as dessert. I had the most spoonfuls out of everybody. I thought I didn't hate it but I am gagging as I'm writing this. Burgers? Hell yeah. Fried stuff? Ooh yeah! Stick with the donut for dessert next time. It's fried and you're safe. Overall, it was a great success and the burger did make me feel like a suicide bomber meeting my virgins in heaven. It's blown to bacon bits awesome!!"], ["Samuel W.", "I ate one of the most delicious and well balanced burgers I've ever had in my entire life at Red Cow. Anyone that knows me knows that I fucking love bacon. And, in an unintentionally hipster twist, I fucking loved bacon before it was cool. So... media.giphy.com/media/13\u2026Onto the 60/40 burger. Fuck me, it was so delicious that just thinking about it is making my mouth wetter than an expectant virgin.As per the website...\"60 % Certified Angus beef & 40% Ground bacon, topped with cheddar cheese, beer mustard and candied bacon\"If you're thinking that sounds like too much bacon, gtfo.If you're still on board, let's be brochachas.The meat was tender and not overly greasy as I'd originally feared from the addition of the bacon. It had a smokier, richer and more decadent flavor than a normal patty and retained its integrity until the last bite. Though I was initially skeptical of the candied bacon, it was only just sweet enough to notice with each bite--cloying by no means--and it served to balance the heady sharpness of the stone ground beer mustard.Goddamn. This thing is truly the burger of the gods.The fries didn't do a ton for me. I'm not a fan of the 'fried 28362 times' spuds that look all dark brown and always end up tasting chewy/stale. They weren't heinous by any stretch, but I wouldn't have missed them if they hit the floor. As an appetizer, Jenny and I also split the pork belly sliders because I decided to clog every single one of my arteries in one sitting. They, too, were well-balanced by the acidity and sharpness of their toppings and the belly portions were generous as well as fried to an ideal crunch.

We eventually got beer from the bar and stood around and stood around and stood around. We had to yell to talk to each other, even standing side-by-side, as the music was incredibly loud. \u00a0By the time we were feeling really annoyed, it was too late to go anywhere else, so we stayed. \u00a0Turns out non-sports fans should NOT go to Red Cow on big sports nights, like when the Wild are playing. \u00a0And the Wild were playing. There were just too many people parked at tables, not eating, not drinking and certainly not leaving.After about an hour, we were finally seated. We noted a speaker right overhead, and, we asked our very polite server if there was a way to turn down the volume on the music. He said he'd check (but he sounded dubious).At 8:05, our order went into the kitchen, and we got our food about 20 minutes later. \u00a0I'm guessing it sat under a heat lamp for a bit as it wasn't really hot, however, we were NOT going to send it back, since we were starving by then, and some of our party had had 2 pints of beer and no food for a long time. At some point, one of our party went to ask the manager to turn down the bloody music, as it seemed to get louder right when they dimmed the lights. \u00a0He did indeed drop the volume somewhat, although we still had to repeat everything a couple of times to be heard.I had the Cowboy Burger and was freaked out when it arrived, as it looked a bit like the Leaning Tower of Pizza, the whole thing being pinned together with a steak knife. \u00a0Turns out it was a regular sized burger with 3 big onion rings between the burger and the top bun. \u00a0The first onion ring was filled with bbq pork, and when I took out 2 of the 3 rings, the burger became approachable.I have seen larger hamburger patties, but the burger was quite good, \u00a0just slightly too cool to make me completely happy. \u00a0I had the sweet potato fries (an extra $1) and they were OK, nothing extraordinary about them. \u00a0Everyone else at the table said their food was OK, but to tell the truth, no one raved about anything. It could have been because our throats were too tired and sore to say anything more!If we had come to Red Cow during a quieter time, we might have had a better experience, but to tell the truth, we probably won't return. \u00a0It wasn't worth the drive to have to yell our voices hoarse to talk, and then have barely-warm food."], ["Keith S.", "I miss Costello's....but I can't complain too much with Red Cow taking the space over. \u00a0Some thoughts:-\"Nicer\" than I expected. \u00a0Still casual but a little more polished than the burger joint I had in my mind.-And now I'm going to contradict myself: A little more \"sports barsy\" than expected. \u00a0Mostly just with the large TVs at the bar.-Overall atmosphere was very comfortable. \u00a0Not too loud. \u00a0Not too dark.-Service was very attentive.-Have just had a couple burgers & fries so far, but very good. \u00a0Good meat. \u00a0Good bun. \u00a0Everything works well together.-Good beer selection. \u00a0-Big +: Open later hours than most places in sleepy St. Paul (Sunday night! gasp!)"], ["Greg H.", "Amazing burger creations! I'm usually a purist when it comes to burgers but what these guys do with ground beef is borderline genius. Constantly rotating menus and draft lineups make this place a total win. This goes for all the locations, though St. Paul has a chef's choice weekly specialty burger event that's very special indeed."], ["Ron S.", "If you need to watch your salt intake order the hummus platter, utterly devoid of salt or tahini in preparation :("], ["Tim D.", "The first time I had lunch here with some colleagues, I was blown away. Everything was top-notch. We had a helpful and friendly server. My barbecue burger was truly amazing - perfectly prepared and topped with delectable pulled pork, barbecue sauce, and an onion ring. The cheese curds were to-die-for. The dessert - a mini-donut and ice cream State Fair special - was incredible. My colleagues agreed; the food here is amazing. Freshly prepared food, a hip atmosphere - you can't go wrong! I can't wait to go back."], ["Gretchen B.", "The breakfast pot pie is just biscuits and gravy in disguise, and it is delicious. I prefer a hearty biscuit to this flaky crust, but the added peas/carrots/other pot pie staples were subtle and a good twist on standard biscuits and gravy. I didn't try them, but the hash browns looked good, crispy on the outside and not too soggy on the inside.The bloody mary is decent and comes with an ever-so-rare craft beer sidecar!Scotch eggs were awesome. Paired mustard was awesome. We sat upstairs, and it was fairly dark for a sunny summer morning. But at peak brunch time, 11am on a Sunday, we had no problem getting a table!I'm excited to try it again and come for lunch or dinner!Exclamation point!"], ["Andrew W.", "Had the chips and dip appetizer. Ultimate burger. A beer. The truffle fries and aioli. All were superb. Even the house ketchup was really good. Good prices too. Service was also excellent, could not have asked for a better experience. Only criticism is that the chips were a bit too salty."], ["Amy R.", "I've had this place on my to \"try\" list for awhile. Surprised to see how fast this place opened the doors from what used to be.They have about four little outdoor tables so that's a plus.Take out service was very quick.Food: I ordered the grinder-while it was good, it was quite greasy, but that's the salamis fault. Tons and tons of pastrami with a lot of gruyere cheese and the girdinara vegetables which added that extra little punch. Fries were okay. For hand-cut fries, I was hoping they would have been a little better. I love hand -cut fries and have been become a bit of a fry snob, these were too crispy and done for me, but a lot of people like em' that way.My dining mate ordered the Ultimate Burger which was quite large. Their portions are quite large and easy enough for left overs.Not bad. May or may not stop back to try one of their burgers."], ["Russell J.", "I think this place is fairly good for the price. Have been there twice and honestly think they are asking a lot of money for the food they serve. It's decent, but not great. Drinks are good, but again pricey."], ["Jack S.", "The restaurant was extremely loud \u00a0food was great though \u00a0Long wait !"], ["John R.", "Great burgers. \u00a0Went once a few months back. \u00a0This time we went for a quick dinner with the wife and some friends and was glad they wanted to try this place. \u00a0I'm usually just a generic cheeseburger and fries person, but went away from that and ordered the Royale. \u00a0Was cooked perfectly and the brie, arugula and tomato jam worked well with the pork belly. \u00a0Got a nice hoppy beer from their impressive selection and I was happy. \u00a0The others in our party were satisfied as well.The room upstairs was a little on the hot side due to the heat outside and the sun pouring thru the uncovered window, so much that I was pretty soaked with sweat by the time we left. \u00a0Other than that though it was a great time and dining experience. \u00a0Highly recommended."]], "Aesop's Table": []}
