{"Don Quixote's Mexican Grill": [["Enetra E.", "We've had a local taqueria that was a favorite of ours for quite some time but between the lack of polite counter help (which was always lacking, despite the owner being a nice guy) hit and miss quality and a recent (undeserving) price hike in catering we decided it was time to try something new. We were instant fans of Don Quixote's. Everything was great from the food, very friendly counter staff and clean establishment. We've been on a handful of occasions and this seems consistent. But this isn't where the 5 stars comes from...I purchase catering orders a few times a year and when it comes to Mexican food I tend to lean on the old fav. Although no one has ever been a fan of the meat - dry, bland, chopped up like ground beef. So bad that we never wanted left overs - and there was always a ton! This past weekend was looking to be the same but I thought I'd call DQ and see what they could offer. Even though Linda (the very sweet owner) and I ran into some follow up email/communication flaws we were able to place our order and couldn't have been happier!!! The rice, chicken and asada was just as perfect as the price. Absolutely Delish!! In fact, I was hoping desperately for left overs and there wasn't much. . If you need to purchase food for catering PLEASE call Linda. I'm just so excited that I've found this gem!!! Thank you!!"], ["Charlotte S.", "delicious burritos!with the choice of whole wheat tortillas, and the spanish rice they have is brown rice! very yummy and healthy choices.the salsa is amazing too! very flavorful with good spice.one star off, because sometimes i feel like i'm bugging the servers to make my burrito when i come in. and as soon as they're done, they disappear in the back and i typically don't see them again. but no bother to me, i can mow down my burro and salsa in peace with no side eye for second and third trips to the salsa bar."], ["Roberto L.", "After a busy morning of activities my girlfriend was as hungry as the infamous Sancho (Don Quijote's sidekick). \u00a0Pressed by her changing moods and the attractive name of a place named after one of my favorite book characters, \u00a0we went in. \u00a0This is how it went:1.

There's plenty to choose from on the menu. Me, who's in love with Chipotle's burrito bowl, I decided to order just that...a burrito bowl. There's lots of toppings to choose from and I did just that.From what I ordered I can say, that the food is so good. And the value is just as good.

I ordered a chile verde large quesadilla and it sucked. It was way too salty I couldn't even finish it. The next time I got the street style soft tacos and again was not impressed.

Too bad they don't have more locations!"], ["Richard G.", "This joint just opened the other day. \u00a0It's in a very cool little shopping center in which most of the stores had shut down, so I was glad to see a new business open up here. \u00a0It opened (very appropriately) in the spot where a Qdoba used to be. \u00a0It has pretty much the same layout as the old Qdoba with a fresh paint job, tables, and chairs in a warmer color pallete.My wife and I usually go to the somewhat nearby Taqueria Rincon Alteno as they have arguable the best Chile Rellenos in North Natomas. \u00a0When my wife pulled up Don Quixote's menu online and saw that they served Chile Rellenos, we had to give it a try.Needless to say, she ordered a Chile Relleno (a la carte with the sauce on the side) and I ordered the Chipotle Ranch Burrito with Carnitas. \u00a0The food was ready very quickly and we also grabbed some chips and salsa from the complimentary chip & salsa bar. \u00a0As we sat down a large number of people came in; luckily we had just beat the \"lunch crowd\".My wife noted that there seemed to be a bit of what looked like olive oil pooled on her plate. \u00a0She was satisfied with her food but said she still preferred the Chile Relleno at Taqueria Rincon Alteno. \u00a0My burrito was good but the Carnitas were nowhere near as tasty as Taqueria Rincon Alteno. \u00a0All in all, the food was good but unfortunately Don Quixote did not unseat our fav place; but I would rank it as probably #2 in my opinion. \u00a0I would definitely go back as there were some other items on their menu that I would like to try; specifically their \"mini chimichangas\". \u00a0I also really love the location as it has a really cool fountain, fire place, and giant Christmas tree."], ["Eric B.", "Thoroughly enjoyed my lunch here. \u00a0Friendly staff and great food. \u00a0I ordered the special of the day, grilled fish tacos and they were fantastic. \u00a0The chips and salsa bar was well stocked and had a great selection of ingredients and salsas to try. \u00a0I will be back the next time I am in the area."], ["JaneY L.", "First time i went and had the mini chimis. Loved them. Just went today and their crunchy puffy tacos were just alright. Not as crunhy as they should be. Their guacamole is good though."], ["Rudy N.", "Great food at a great price. \u00a0I had the Chicken Sopes (2), a chile verde tamal, cup of chicken tortilla soup & a Dos X Amber. \u00a0My friend had the Chicken Sopes and a large bowl of the tortilla soup & a fountain drink. \u00a0My son had the giant quesadilla with carne asada & a Mexican coke. The whole bill was under $40 and we had enough food left over to take home. Everyone was very friendly and accommodating. \u00a0I like their salsa bar, it had a good variety of toppings and salsas.

Eat your heart out. This place has a very similar format, but with a more authentic Mexican style menu. They have a chip and salsa bar, they serve beer, and there food is excellent.

Located near lots of shopping as well."], ["Rachael R.", "The carnitas were to die for, and I know my carnitas! What makes a white girl know so much you ask? How could I possibly be an authority you quiz? Well let me tell you. I am an events planner (professionally) and one of my gigs is to work Quinceanera's, so I've been to like a million of them. At like 99.99% of them they serve carnitas, rice, and beans - and I get fed a heaping plate each time. That being said I have had more carnitas than most will ever be able to even dream of consuming in their lives. And Don Quixote's were right up in the top 5. One of my requirements is that they not be just a slathering plate of fat, and this place delivered. I know it's a fatty cut, but I want meat; and Don Quixote's were all meat with killer flavor behind it. So don't read dry and bland. To be honest I didn't expect much walking in (its standard Mexican decor in an off-main shopping center), but my husband promised me I'd love it. He was right. The tortilla soup had tons of veggies, fresh cheese, tortillas and a rich broth. The vegetarian brown rice was fluffy and flavorful. All in all, it is worth a trip."], ["Jennifer M.", "Had the Don Quixote Platter wit flour tortillas, was very good!!

Our family has driven (from Woodland) to the Watt Ave. location several times, so we were absolutely thrilled to find out that they'd opened a new place closer to home! We found out about the new location totally by happenstance tonight: we were planning to eat at Chili's, but after waiting there for 40 minutes, and then being told the kitchen was \"way behind\", I yelped Don Quixotes to see how late they were going to be open thinkin we might need to make a change of venue. That's when I noticed the Natomas locale, less than a half a mile from Chili's! We quickly scratched our names off the Eternal Waiting List (getting no apology from Chili's for our departure, btw), and were comfortably seated in a clean, QUIET atmosphere, eating fresh-mex 10 minutes later. \u00a0(Think Chipotles, only much, much better.)Ahhh... \u00a0How nice to be at home now with my feet up, kickin back, relaxed & contentedly sated. \u00a0Thanks, Yelp. \u00a0If I hadn't checked you out tonight, my family and I could still be sitting at Chili's: mad, hungry, and yelling over the noisy din to one another."], ["Christina L.", "Was not impressed at all.

The tequila offerings are endless and the bartenders churn out some strong margaritas! The true winner of this entire establishment is the steak tacos that are served ONLY at the taco bar towards the back of the restaurant. Those are the BEST tacos I have ever eaten in my entire life. The steak was flavorful, the melted cheese melded all of the flavors together, and the cactus salsa was out of this world. I tried all of the other taco offerings but the steak won every time. The owner knows what he's doing here by keeping the taco bar separate. Supply and demand! The tacos can't be ordered anywhere else in the restaurant so the taco bar was constantly packed. The liquore bar had a taco offering and I saw different tacos some being served in the restaurant area, but they are not the same. Though the restaurant is spacious and beautifully decorated, the best seat and tacos in the house is at the taco bar."], ["Collin W.", "I was looking for a place that had good Mexican food with good tequilas because I always go to Tres Hermanas and Zocalo for Mexican food. I was impressed with their selection and got the steak tacos with blue corn tortilla and the ricotta taquitos. I thought the tacos were ok but not great but I don't think I would order the taquitos again. I always try a place at least twice so next time I'll order something else. The chips however were really good. It was just kind of weird that they charge $3 for an order of chips and salsa."], ["Julianne V.", "Horrible service! Second time here and we had 6pm reservations... After waiting 30 mins we finally said eff it and left. Food isn't that good to have such terrible service.

Don't accept reservations if you're not going to honor them."], ["Janay S.", "Been here a few times and have always had a great time. Everybody is always very friendly. The lighting is perfect and the d\u00e9cor is very artistic and unique. There is a lot to look at and a lot of yummy stuff on the menu. The Mexican cocktails are very refreshing. Try the Asi sabe or the Mango y Chile. \u00a0The Impossible is a delicious dessert with cake, flan, whipped cream, and strawberries. I could go on about the great Mexican appys and entrees."], ["Steph M.", "Based solely on their watermelon margarita I'm not too big a fan! We came here during the Cinco de Mayo madness and lines at the bar were outrageously long! Ordered two of these famous margaritas (one with tequila and the other with vodka) and weren't blown away. I've never had tajin chile powder mixed with \"fresh\" watermelon juice (soo soo delicious when mixed with the small slice of watermelon they give you on the side), cucumber, lime, and vodka but I liked it! The official name for this drink is \"As\u00ed sabe M\u00e9xico\" and was only $9 which is a pretty decent price given all the ingredients! Unfortunately, I've had fresh watermelon juice at Quickly's and, compared to the juice we were given in this drink, it didn't taste all that \"fresh\"--but that is just my personal opinion. Since I had this drink with vodka maybe that threw off the taste a bit but I probably won't be coming back just for it. The food, however, looked really good and I might come back to try it out! The venue is beautiful, a bit on the smaller side, but great for date night! It probably gets crowded on weekends so try and come early as parking can be a bit tedious! It is across the street from Ella's and they offer valet parking so I recommend utilizing this service if you don't want to park in the parking garage. It's a bit dark inside with dimmed lights throughout the restaurant and various Mexican-inspired art pieces on display.The bartender was relatively friendly, it was quite busy when we came so he was probably overwhelmed by the constant incoming drink orders. We waited around 5 minutes for both our drinks and were in and out in under 20 minutes. Overall, I've had better mixed fruity drinks (i.e. Ellas and Morton's) and probably won't be coming back here unless I'm in the mood for some upscale Mexican food."], ["deb B.", "We came at 12 noon this past Sunday before attending Elf the Musical:) \u00a0The staff was great the food portions VERY small 2 tiny cold burritos $15 child portion casadilla cold over charged a $1 husband food cold enchiladas cold and lacking flavor:( \u00a0No cocktails only mexican coffee (good but luke warm) bill was $62. \u00a0 No thanks!"], ["Ts S.", "Tried again, twice in one week because the service was so poor, I thought it was a fluke.However, I was again disappointed at how long it took to have the waitstaff approach, then provide the service during the meal and bring the check. \u00a0Seems to be going downhill.

The murals on the walls are spectacular.Bartenders are great and friendly. We have never had a bad experience. The food is mexican but a lot of the spices, I think, are more related to South America. Can't remember plate names specifically because we try new ones each time. Breakfast is off the chain tough, so much food on each plate.

The chorizo bites were amazing & hit the spot!!!! The chorizo had great flavor & was the perfect combo with the beans, cheese, & salsa on a crunchy bread. The watermelon margarita was delicious! It had cucumber, watermelon, & tajin on the rim. For our meals we ordered the green cheese enchiladas & the flank steak. The enchiladas we good but the beans were my favorite. They had a baked bean flavor to them but with more spice & kick. They were to die for!!!! They were sprinkled with cheese on top. My boyfriend got the steak & said it was a little chewy but had very good flavor. My boyfriend loved the cheese enchilada that came with his food!!!We will definitely be back when we are in the area.

Scrumptiousness in a bowl! Fantastic! I thought it was funny that they guy next to me thought the hominy in the pozole was \"little perfect potato pillows.\" Haha! Obviously not too familiar with the dish, but he enjoyed it as much as I did and that's what really matters, right?The verde sauce is fresh, tangy, and has a slight citrus zing. The vegetables were fresh and crispy, the chicken was all breast meat and served almost as a whole breast filet, but it was so tender, it shredded with the prodding of a fork...and I loved the warm, home-made mini-tostadas that were served on the side.The bartender, Luis, was very knowledgeable about various concoctions with tequila, which allowed me to enjoy customized specials at the bar for a few hours. This place isn't cheap, especially if you're drinking, but it's worth it.Upscale cuisine with a \u00a0very pleasant atmosphere and fantastic service.

Also tried the Enchiladas Zapotecas and they were very tasty - the freshness of the guacamole inside inside of the enchiladas with the cooked mushrooms on top was a nice combination. And, of course, the drink which this place is famous for, the watermelon margarita (which is just as delicious virgin) is worth recommendation.The interior design is beautiful, and the waiters are talkative and friendly.The reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is the state of confusion which seemed to be present in the kitchens. I went after a large dinner party had finished, and the kitchen was backed up with orders. There were many empty tables, but because of the kitchen backup, I was told that there was no room for my party today. Luckily, things worked out, and the host (seeming unhappy with my persistence) eventually sat us at a nice table outside. The wait, though the host warned me about it greatly, was just fine and it allowed me to reach the perfect state of hunger before I ate.

Beware that the salsa in the carnitas taco is very hot, so if you are whimpy like me then tell the server. My honey tried a mole dish and that was fabulous too.Our bartender/server at the taco bar was Curtis. Thanks for the great service! We had a fun and yummy experience both times.

The beso ardiente isn't as spicy as I thought or it sounded, but it was a bitterish, sourish, spicy, lemony taste and you can taste the bell pepper.

It was overflowing with ceviche and the cool cucumber was a nice balance for a refreshing starter. \u00a0We also had the Dobladitas de Chile Poblano y Queso Oaxaca which were corn tortillas filled with Oaxaca cheese, roasted poblano peppers and saut\u00e9ed onions. We could have just stopped with these two items because they were both so filling. Bravo!Luckily we both finished with soup. \u00a0My mom had the Crema de Chile Poblano. It was a little too spicy for her so she asked for some sour cream to cool it down a bit. Our server, Ernesto, was happy to oblige and even added and mixed it for her, asking periodlically for her to taste to see if it needed more to get to the spiciness she wanted. \u00a0I had the Pozole Verde con Pollo with a tomatillo base and cilantro. The pumpkin seeds, hominy and chicken made this soup very hearty without being heavy. It does have a kick to it which I love. \u00a0The service was incredible as well as their white sangria.

(Background: Mezcal is a liquor made in the Oaxaca region of Mexico. I would describe it as a very smoky tequila. The tasting was a fun and new experience, and I would recommend it if you've never done it before.) Anyways, we sat at the bar, and my seat was adjacent to a group of older folks. As we waited for our drinks and food, the talkative gentleman next to me was telling his group how our bartender was THE mezcal expert, etc. I didn't think anything of it, but as we started trying out the different mezcal flights, he turned to me and struck up a conversation. It took a few seconds after we had turned back to our respective parties, but then I realized that he was a dead ringer for Rick Steves--the PBS travel guru.In a hushed voice, I confirmed with my co-workers that I wasn't going crazy, but when we asked him if he'd ever been told he looked like Rick Steves, he acted like he didn't even know who Rick was (!).I figured he was: A) a perfect Rick Steves doppelganger (as I listened to him later on, he even had the trademark lisp!), or B) he was Rick Steves on vacation and didn't want to be bothered by fans. As impossible as that sounds, I have convinced myself it was the latter, and decided to leave him alone. I even resisted the urge to ask him for a photo before we left (I TOTALLY would have posted that baby up on Facebook and taken a poll). Either way, it's a story I like to share every now and then over a glass of mezcal or on Yelp.SO, back to reviewing the restaurant itself--the good: The happy hour has great prices and food and drinks. I have enjoyed many tacos and mixed beverages here. They even have an alcoholic version of my summer drink, the mangonada. And the ambience and location are both great.The bad: I'm not a fan of the regular menu. I think it's too pricey for the quality of food that is served--I've never liked any of the dishes I tried.Would I come back? For happy hour, of course!

Both were delicious. Good size portions, we both had left overs. We will definitely come back again when in town!"], ["Donovan H.", "As my taste buds were devoid of any Mexican food for awhile, my cravings had escalated to a good old taqueria. And this is where \"Mezcal Taqueria\" comes into place. Now I've been here.. however, its been a very long time (10+ years ago) so what better way to give this place a try with a new review to go with it?Now I'm a sucker for Mexican food. I eat it on average of at least once a week to fulfill my needs. But with that said and done, I am very picky as I've been to some pretty damn good places in my time. \"Mezcal Taqueria\" is located in the heart of South Natomas on the corner of West El Camino Ave. and Truxel Road. And for those of you that have been to the neighborhood bar, \"Cheers\" then you'll know exactly where I am talking about.I came here with my lady, Claudia H. and our friend on a Sunday evening around 5:45pm. Much to our surprise, we were the only ones inside the restaurant. The inside of this place is fairly spacious with floor space that is big enough for dancing as well as several tables near the windows and booths that run towards the back of the restaurant. There were also two flat screen TV's that were showing traditional Mexican soccer games. Additionally, you will find a fairly decent sized complimentary salsa bar complete with lemon wedges, radishes, and their signature tortilla chips.Fortunately, we all actually came during their Happy Hour which runs every day from 4-8pm. However, the Happy Hour specials only offer their \"street tacos\" (for $1.50) and a 7 oz. bottle of \"Coronita\" (for $1.75). As tacos was what I was craving, I ordered 2 of the carne asada along with 1 of the carnitas flavor. I also ordered an ice cold Coronita to wash it down with. My lady also orders tacos while our friend went for an order of the \"Las Fajitas Plates\" (for $12.95). This plate includes grilled chicken, red/green/yellow bell peppers, onions, pico de gallo, roman lettuce, guacamole, Spanish rice, and refried beans.The tacos arrived first for my lady and I and came within a respectable 7 minutes after ordering. At first glance, the tacos are slightly larger than tacos you would find at say, a taco truck. There were two corn tortillas and a respectable of meat included in each taco. There was also a fair amount of cilantro, white onions, and salsa verde included in each taco. After one bite, I was quite satisfied. Not mind blowing good (such as \"Lalo's in South Sacramento or the taco trucks) but definitely better than what you'd find at the more popular Mexican restaurants that people frequent at.Overall, this is a fairly run-of-the-mill Mexican restaurant that is worth giving a try. They offer a very extensive menu including chimichangas, tostadas, burritos, quesadillas, nachos, sopes, salads, soups, and seafood. They also offer Molcajetes which are large bowls (suitable for sharing) that offer a variety of options that includes steak, chicken, shrimp, and crab legs. So if you happen to stumble in this part of town, I'd recommend giving \"Mezcal Taqueria\" a try."], ["K F.", "My husband and I eat here fairly regularly, and have never had a bad experience, service is always friendly, the meals are always good, and the salsa is amazing.

But, admittedly, they skimp a bit on the meat. But everything goes together so well that you honestly don't feel like you got jipped. Their salsa was amazing. Flavorful and, depending on how hot you like it, puts a good burn in your mouth. My only complaint would be that they are stingy with salsa cups, so if you're ordering to go then you better use that salsa sparingly.Customer service wasn't bad, wasn't great.

My more adventurous friends try many of the other items and always look forward to our lunch outings here.The restaurant itself is set up well, but could definitely use a little more style. The chairs are always lower than they seem, so you kind of fall into your seat. My biggest criticism of the place would be the decorating, which I realize has little to do with taste buds but DOES add to the overall experience. Besides that one critique, I love MezCal and recommend it to anyone looking for a great tasting burrito and a friendly staff!"], ["Brittany P.", "I found this place because the bar next door didnt serve food at the time. I really enjoyed my super nachos with Carnitas so much that it was the only thing I ordered. I have since moved on to the Carnitas plate. Every time I have been there it has been amazing! This time however there was way too much fat on my Carnitas. I understand that it is fatty, but this was too much. My favorite part is the salsa bar, although, at nearly closing I guess I can't expect the freshest of chips. \u00a0This trip gets 4 stars because of the excessive fat on my Carnitas."], ["Jefferson L.", "I'm a burrito-eatin' fool. It's a size thing, really. Looking at a Mexican restaurant menu, I always seem to gravitate to what I believe to be the biggest, most filling item: the burrito. Tacos? An appetizer. Enchiladas? Better come with rice and beans. Chile Verde? I'll need extra tortillas. Sometimes I just need more to be fulfilled and satisfied. Mezcal, FTW!They have a few burritos to choose from: regular, super and Mezcal. I really have no idea what makes them different because their chalkboard menu has no ingredients listed. Sufficed to say, super = grande = the size of the Sunday paper, including Parade magazine, rolled and rubberbanded. Choose your meat--from pollo to asada to shrimp--grab some chips and salsa and find a clean, comfortable seat. Service is courteous and quick and they give you large, cloth napkins with your silverware, not those tiny whitey paper wipes you get elsewhere.Overall, the food is tasty, nicely presented and, with regard to those burritos, FILLING. I've tried chicken, steak and carnitas and they were all delicious. They also have a daily special which has tempted me more than once but, you know me(if you're not sure, look up and read the first line.)Mezcal is next door to La Bou on West El Camino and never seems too crowded at lunch time. Get a table by the window and enjoy stuffing yourself silly. It'll help you sleep through the second half of your workday."], ["Rowena L.", "Good place. The set-up is a little untraditional for most restaurants, with its walk-up ordering but restaurant-style seating. (But that's actually quite common for taquerias). Very clean and organized.Anyhow, the cashier was very nice and helpful, esp. since I'm pretty illiterate in Spanish. The chips and salsa is self-serve, but the food you order is brought to your table. There were 7 of us and we ordered a variety of dishes. I'm only going to comment on the ones I tried. The veggie burrito was pretty average, while the pasilla plate was quite tasty. The shrimp ceviche wasn't as good as others had said. I didn't get to try the tortas, quesadillas, and mezcal burritos we also ordered, but they looked great, esp. the torta. The portions are huge though and I would certainly recommend it."], ["Annie K.", "I had the crispy tacos - one carne, one carnitas, and one pollo.The steak was dry, tasteless, and chewy. Didn't bother eating the meat. Halfway through the carnitas taco, I got a mouthful of pork fat. Yum. The one that wasn't too terrible was the chicken taco, though it's not something to rave about either. As for the salsas, NONE of them were spicy at all. Instead, all I had was a bottle of Tapatio.

But for someone who doesn't know any better, this place is awesome. Portions are enormous, and I always leave this place with a terrible food coma--which sucks because I'm supposed to be hard at work. My favorite dishes are the quesadilla and the enchiladas, mainly because I like those two and also because they're not too big that I can't finish it. Most of the time.The quesadilla is pretty much the size of a small-medium pizza, and you can get a good dose of sour cream and guacamole on top if you so wish without any extra cost. You have a choice of what kind of meat you can get inside, and I used to get ox tongue, but they don't do that anymore. It was an extremely sad face day for me.The enchiladas come in a choice of green (not spicy) or red (spicy) sauce, with either chicken or cheese. It also comes with rice and beans so it makes for a decent size meal.Also, each meal comes with AYCE salsa and chips. I haven't had it because I can barely finish the regular meals as it is, but my coworkers like it. Service is great and the servers are really nice and polite.

Sure, it's beautifully decorated and feels fancy, but the food was SO disappointing. I'd only been here once for brunch and once for happy hour, so it was my first time experiencing their dinner. My boyfriend and I came here for a late dinner because I wanted Mexican and we wanted to try somewhere new. I was surprised how busy it was for being a late Wednesday night, but were seated immediately. A young male worker brought us waters, chips, and dip. Now their chips are tasty - perfectly crispy. They give you two dips - one bean and one salsa. The bean is a nice change and the salsa was decent - I would've preferred it to be spicier. We decided on fish tacos ($17) and carnitas tacos ($16). This was the most expensive Mexican food we'd ever had, so we thought it'd be *extra* good - we were wrong. Their portions were pretty big, but a lot of something you don't like doesn't really make up for it. The black beans were incredibly bland and the cilantro rice, while pretty, was also bland. I guess we like the more traditional red rice and refried beans. They also give you a potato salad thing that is just WEIRD. I don't know if it's vinegar or what but it's so tangy and weird. It was so weird that even the smell of it was making us sick as we tried to eat the other food! The fish tacos were alright, probably the best out of everything we ordered, but that's not saying much. I'd honestly prefer Rubios over this. The carnitas was really salty and fatty also. Our waiter was missing the entire time. The young male staff would refill our waters. I decided to take the beans and rice leftovers to go thinking maybe they'd be better over night - but the male staff takes it to box it for you and he packed that damn salad in there too. Bleck!!! Had to repack the leftovers once I got home. Honestly, I feel like this place is all for show. Their interior is beautiful and they have nice outdoor seating, but the food was just not for us. I'm actually really surprised people like their food so much.

The potato salad has a vinegar base (as opposed to a mayonnaise base) with broccoli and slivered almonds. It has a bright taste from the vinegar and broccoli with a nice crunch from the almonds.

The waiter was so nice about the whole thing and took it back and had something else made up. They didn't make me feel weird about it or guilty for not liking it. The chips and salsa were great! We also ordered the guacamole which tasted so fresh. It was some of the best I've ever had. For dinner I ordered the Americanos tacos, two others ordered the Baja Fish Tacos and the last person in our party ordered the El Burrito. The tacos were awesome. They were filled to the brim and the flavors married well together. The chicken was juicy and delicious. I probably could have eaten about four more plates of them! The fish tacos were also pretty yummy. That fish tasted like it had been caught that morning- that's how fresh it was! The portions of all meals ordered were large, too. It was a lot of food.

What keeps you coming back?I have two words for you: Happy Hour.Happy hour at Zocalo is seven days a week from 3-6pm. It features several delicious appetizers for only $5 and plenty of choices on drinks ranging from $3-8 (I believe). The quesadilla, sopes and empanadas are my favorite. I also generally will drink a draft beer or house margarita. The bartenders here are great and usually remember us! They are super nice and my friends and I never sit anywhere but at the bar.I simply don't come to Zocalo much outside of happy hour because frankly it's a bit pricey, and with the happy hour being so great, why would I? I did come here for my sister's graduation dinner and everyone enjoyed their entrees, so I know offerings outside HH are delicious too. I have yet to come for brunch but I'm sure the same is true.In short, Zocalo has great food and great service, but these things along with the HH are what keep me coming back so often. Also! If you like spicy, do NOT forget to ask for a side of the housemade habanero salsa. Yummmmm."], ["Jay K.", "First off, as always, parking. It's all street, there's a garage somewhere that I didn't use nor find and valet, which I did find and use. We circled a couple times, but after going through too many dark lit intersections with situations with pedestrians wearing the blackest possible clothes as possible we settled for valet. Way easier, a little pricey, but for me worth it. You may find street parking--I did not. Parking is the bane of my existence, I'm a wimp when searching. The ambiance of this place is definitely UPSCALE. I didn't get that memo, nor did my girlfriend inform me that this was a little more of a nicely dressed restaurant. I wore casual clothes and while my experience was amazing I did feel I could have dressed a lot nicer. Guys were in dress shirts and jeans and girls just had more formal tops or a simple dress on. I on the other hand came in a bit more grunge with a plaid long sleeve winter shirt on and shorts. Our server(s) were Mayea, which hopefully I'm spelling right, and Julio. Julio is actually the general manager, but most of the staff knew my girl so our treatment was probably a little different than the average experience. Never the less, as biased as it is, I had a great evening and 5 stars for me always comes from service. \u00a0Mayea was the funniest server and obviously our service was a lot more informal and friend-based than customer-server type but I digress, they were both hilarious and wonderful throughout the night. We started with the guacamole dip, which I enjoyed. I actually didn't mind just the salsa as well, but my girlfriend said trying the guac was a must. It was worth it.I didn't get an actual entree because I'm honestly not the biggest fan of mexican food (sorry...), so I wasn't really sure what would be worth the price for me. I settled on two appetizers that together were far more than enough. I don't eat a lot to begin with, but I found the portions satisfactory. I got the empanadas, which were okay if I'm being completely honest. The meat didn't really pop out to me and while it was nicely plated I was just kind of meh about it. But the quesadillas I got were soooo good. I don't even remember what meat was in it, but the cheese and the flavor of the meat was wonderful. I took it home and had it for lunch today! So one really meh half and one exceptional half + dessert was off the charts so who cares! We were constantly tended to partially because my friend was acquainted with them and also because they were good about check ups which was nice. Julio wanted to surprise us with dessert, I said as long as there was ice cream I was satisfied. He agreed to my check list and he brought out their pastel de fruta. Yuuuuum. I wanted to try the churro as well, and honestly I would've ordered both but my girlfriend said she wasn't going to eat--that ended up being a lie. I just liked the idea that he wanted to surprise us, I'm a foodie. It doesn't take much to satisfy me as long as the staples of the dish are there i.e I need ice cream for dessert. It was just an experience I haven't had in awhile and I love when servers/managers like to interact with customers and surprise us. Like stated before we actually knew Julio so that was a big reason why, but still fun.Overall, an amazing experience for us. The staff was attentive and the ambiance was wonderful. A nice upscale place that doesn't require you to fork over 30-40 bucks a person in midtown? Win for me.

Even got great seating outside! I started off with a blackberry margarita, which is the most popular cocktail. It was just average, but I'm not a huge fan of tequila, so that may have been the reason. I then ordered the Arrachera Los Altos, which consisted of 12 oz. steak, portobello mushrooms, rice, and jalape\u00f1o toreado. Let me start off with the rice; oh my goodness, so delicious! Probably the best rice I have ever tasted aside from my mothers of course. The steak was abundant, and filled me up quickly! Super juicy as well! I completely loved everything on my plate!

We flagged our water down and said no problem he'll tell the bartender.

One drink later the waiter comes back and says that the pitchers were still hot from the watch and still aren't ready and if it's ok with us he'll just keep refilling our glasses. Wow! This keeps getting better. We've moved from a single drink to a pitcher that holds about 6 margaritas to unlimited drinks. The food overall was good.

The menu was pretty basic, I asked what was the most flavorful and popular item and I was told the Arrachera Los Altos.

While prevuing the menu you are presented with chips with salsa and a black bean concoction. Both were delicious!We ordered the fish tacos and the chicken mole enchiladas. Both were over $15 dollars however they were served with rice, beans, and a salad. Both were wonderful! I would recommend coming here if you are looking for a nice Mexican restaurant. The entrees range from 15-20 dollars while the drinks range from 6-12 dollars. The service is impeccable and they ambiance is even better!"], ["Ellen H.", "One of my favorite Sacramento restaurants!

Overall our evening at Zocalo was really fun and everyone in my group very much enjoyed the drinks, entrees, and desserts, and as this group is also my once-a-month-dinner-group, I'm sure we'll be back. \u00a0Just a warning: parking is a bit of a nightmare in this area on Friday nights but they do have valet, and the host mentioned there was a garage about a block over."], ["Cristina O.", "This place is always so lively. We came for Father's Day dinner and the food was good as always. We made reservations for two after Mass and there was no wait when we got there. We decided to eat outside and it was perfect. Started with a pitcher of their blackberry mojito and their guacamole. The waiter was very attentive to our needs without being too \"in your face\". The entrees were also very good and satisfying with plenty to take home. Coffee and dessert to finish-although the flan was more like a cheesecake for us, hence the four stars."], ["Jonathan S.", "The food was pretty good. Ordered the El Burrito and Baja Fish tacos. \u00a0The portion size was very large and we both had leftover. \u00a0The green rice was surprisingly tasty as well as the \"cole slaw\". \u00a0The potato thing and black beans were not that great though. \u00a0The food is a bit pricey compared to most Mexican restaurants, but I assume their prices a just jacked up due to their location in midtown. The atmosphere is really nice and they were decorated for Day of the Dead which was pretty cool. \u00a0The waiters were a bit subpar considering the restaurant was relatively empty. \u00a0Overall not a bad experience. \u00a0I'll probably come here in the future."], ["Jasmine C.", "Hubby like their fish tacos and in the mood for it today, so why not.He got fish tacos and I had pozole rojo soup and Zocalo sangria after a really hectic morning and kinda nice to have lunch date with your other half :)I had better pozole and sangria before, so will I come back to Zocalo, yes, I will with different food and drink choices of course.Happy hours from 3-6 PM and I will try that :)"], ["M C.", "I'd been here a few times and decided to have brunch with my mom last week.

We placed our right around noon. Our server was friendly and attentive, stopping by to check on us frequently to tell us that our food would be \"right out\". Fast forward to 12:40 pm, and we still had not received our food! We discussed just cancelling our order, since a 40 minute wait far exceeded a reasonable wait time. But just then, our food arrived.I will say that the food was very good, and the plate consisted of black beans, cilantro rice and two eggs, along with fresh tortillas. However, I could not understand why it would take so long for our dishes to arrive. The beans and rice would have been already prepared, the only thing that would have required cooking were the eggs. Why would it take 40 minutes to cook 4 eggs and plate them with the other items? I'll never know.Will I be back? Probably. The ambiance, service and food is good and definitely worth a return visit.

It's pretty much the same with a little better atmosphere and a bigger bar and restaurant area.

Two nice patios for plenty of seating, and a bar that runs along one long wall. Bathrooms are nice and clean as well and offer privacy from one stall to the next. (Always a big plus!)We came with a group of 6 and were quickly seated on the patio on a busy weekday evening after sitting at the bar for a few Happy Hour drinks and eats. I really do love their chips, salsa and bean dip. They bring them to the table in very small containers, but fortunately they aren't stingy on refills. Being a Vegetarian I always get their Cheese Enchiladas (they also offer veggie enchiladas) with Mole Sauce. I love their mole sauce better than their red sauce (too watery). I think the sauce has good flavor, but the enchiladas are only OK. The tortillas never seem to be cooked enough, and prices are too much for the three small enchiladas that you get. They give a small cup of rice and beans for the table, but it's never enough for everyone. They do refills, but sometimes you just don't want to wait. I wish they just put it with each entree.Service was nice and attentive and friendly and I really had a good time.

Ambience: Upscale Mexican restaurant. A lot of times on weekend nights there is Live music and people having a good time. In the summer the patio will be filled with folks enjoying their margaritas! Food/Drink: I will hands down admit their blackberry margarita is like no other margarita I've ever had. It's sooooo good and keeps me coming back :) The food has always been very good and my favorite over the times I've been here has been the Pollo Tacos and Steak salad... I don't know though, maybe I'm more of a homestyle Mexican food girl instead of the upscale Food here, because it's never knocked my socks off. Although, sometimes the prices knock my socks off, hahaha!!! The black bean dip with chips and salsa is a nice touch!

Most of them had never been to Zocalo so I was excited to have them enjoy the great food & ambiance. Unfortunately, the only thing I would rate 5 stars from the night would be the staff who waited on us, the rice & beans, & my daughters dessert (vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup & a tiny churro).*Empanadas: not good at all. Something was way off about them.*Shrimp Tacos: ridiculously soggy! Had to eat them with a fork! Was also not crazy about the shrimp being saut\u00e8d vs. grilled. Why the change? It was much better before.*Mole Enchilada: terrible... It was grossly sweet instead of the original hint of spiciness!

And what's better than sitting outside with some classy mexican food with a nice cold margarita on a hot day? Plus that free bean dip they give you at the beginning is really good. Watch out for that blackberry margarita though, it's deceptively strong. I've also been here for their lunch specials and even though it's a heftier price tag than some other midtown options, they make sure to give you a ton of food. I usually get the taco plate (two big tacos, a salad, beans, pico, and rice) and can't ever finish off the whole plate. Even though there's probably better food for a lower price somewhere else, the atmosphere is fun and trendy and I've never had a problem with service - even when we showed up with a big group of 10.

I seized the opportunity and it was amaaaazing. It's pretty pricey, but it was galactic-super-mcawesomeville (props if you know where this quote is from) delicious :D! It came with beans and some yummy green rice. Pretty hefty amount of food, could've filled up two people--I definitely didn't finish everything.****Note****I ordered a sangria ($5) from the happy hour menu. The server stated my license photo wasn't me because it didn't look like me (It surely was me, lol). At first I thought he was joking, nope, definitely wasn't. It was the first time someone accused me of using someone else's ID. He had me repeat my birthday while he looked at the card and took a his time to check authenticity of the license. He gave me the drink in the end, but they really don't play when it comes to serving alcohol. Which is nice to know they genuinely check.-- Service was great, he was very attentive and friendly. Came around often to check up on us.A few things that Zocalo's deserves brownie points for:1) Happy hour is between 3PM-6PM, everyday!2) $5 sangrias and margaritas (yasssss)3) Nice outdoor and indoor seating areas with elegant ambience in both settings-- It's still nice enough in Sac to be seated in the outdoor seating area!

I remember enjoying their pozole before so today, I had a few items for take out. For takeout, the pozole did not come with onions, radishes, cilantro, or lime. The flavors were good, but like all pozole, I prefer to have it with lime. The soup itself is rich, so a bit of acid could do some good. I will note that Zocalo is generous with the hominy (which I love) and the pork is really tender. My co-worker had the carne asada tacos and I thought they were just alright. \u00a0The lunch taco plates come with 2 tacos, cilantro rice, and beans. I found the tacos to be very salty.

I have been to places where just by looking at the salsa I know its not authentic, but this place reminds me of growing up having to learn how to make salsa/chile on my mothers 60 year old molcajete. The food here reminds me of the streets of L.A. especially Alameda Blvd where taco trucks and make-shift restaurants in people's garages line the boulevard.

It's not the usual rectangular shape, but I guess you can say it's somewhat shaped like a Wiener Schnitzel restaurant, very triangular. It has it's own small parking lot, so no need to worry about street parking.Looking at the menu, I was torn about what to try, but after seeing some pics from yelp earlier, I decided to ask for it (because it's not on the menu), Carne Asada Fries! It's not on the menu, but they said that they are able to make it (so I'm not sure if it was out of my position to ask for them, so I'm sorry if I was =[ ). If you spend at least $2/3 on food (something around that), you'll get free access to the salsa/nacho bar! Their salsa and dip is really good, for sure try the jalepeno mayo dip!The food came out pretty fast! Like I said, I ordered the Carne Asada Fries, which was priced the same as Carne Asada Nachos (about $6.99). The unique thing about this dish (compared to most taquerias), instead of the usual mexican cheese blend, they use nacho cheese whiz (I think at least). This gave the fries a whole different texture, because you wouldn't have to fight the gooey-ness of the usual melted cheese. I think instead of guac, there were just slices of avocado. I liked this unique take on Carne Asada Fries a lot, I think they should add it to the actual menu, if it wasn't already there.The workers are very good too. At a glance, I would guess that it is a Mom-n-Pop type business. Like I said earlier, the cashier was very nice about me ordering the fries. They take your food/drinks to your table, and bust the tables for you.

They lost a star here because like with many burritos it was all chicken, than all sour cream etc. You gotta mix that sish up before you roll. My hub had the beef taco and pork tamales. Holy cow! I've never been a big tamales person but these were flaky but still moist, and the sauce was spicy but not overly so. You could really tell they were freshly prepared. The service is similar to a Jack's- order get a number, have a seat and they will find you. Both our order taker and runner were friendly and smiling. The food also didn't take very long which I liked. Our total only came to about 15 bucks. Not bad when you consider we both had leftovers and shared dessert.

I was left to wonder....Also, he never asked what kind of toast I wanted, even though it stated on the menu that it comes with your choice of toast. When the food came out, I did not have toast.Overall, this place doesn't get my vote because they don't have fruit and don't bring out toast with the omelettes apparently.

It's perfect to sit outside on a warm evening! They have new umbrellas on the patio that keep you shaded in the day and have underneath for a nice ambiance in the evening.

We went on a Friday night and the wait was an hour at least standing outside in the cold. They did bring some warmish Mexican chocolate which was a nice gesture. Maybe they need to build a second story on this place as it has become so popular. Spicy salsa was good. A pico de gallo would be nice. There was a mild red salsa which was bland. Chips were good. Warm ones would have really made it great. The fajitas were different to most but still tasted good. Flour tortillas were OK. Not great. Maybe a little tweak on the recipe would be good.

Great for allz! Come at any given time and find a house full. Spanish rice here is one of my favorites."], ["Jessica L.", "I am craving a hearty brunch. A good friend had mentioned this place, and then I read the online menu - they have Mexican breakfast fare as well as \"american\" style breakfast. Sold. Brunch it is!We arrived around 11 am on a sunny Sunday, and opted to sit outside. They have a great outdoor seating area with some trees and umbrella's scattered around for shade, and the inside looks to have been recently remodeled or very kept up. Clean and orderly with large tiles and a gorgeous bar with booths. There was a Mariachi band dressed in all white serenading the quests inside. We found this hilarious because they were playing standards as well as 70's and 80's tunes. FUN!We had a hard time deciding what to get! TOO many delish options. Once seated we were immediately taken care of by a very efficient server, who delivered water, chips and 2 kinds of salsa (red with a kick, and a milder green salsa) within 2 minutes of greeting us. Excellent.They had the \"michelada's\" on special for $3.50 so we ordered one of those. This is essentially a \"bloody beer\" but spicy and with chilies. It was good. I ordered the house margarita, and given I have to be careful about sugar intake asked what they use to make the drink. I was told they make it old school, simply lime, agave and tequila. Wonderful- I eagerly ordered and drank this cool concoction until I started to feel light-headed and dizzy. Um, no, this had some sort of margarita mix, sugar, or something in it. Without even drinking half the portion, I was not feeling it. Bummer, I love a good margarita but my system cannot take that much sugar. Wonder why she assured me it had no mix? I had to waste more than half the drink.However the food, was plentiful and generous. The SO ordered the \"machaca\" plate- meat and eggs and cheese all together and it was huge, served with rice, beans and tortillas. Combined with his drink, he said this meal would satisfy him until dinner time. I ordered a simple plate of eggs, beans and cheese, hold the rice, with red sauce. This also came with tortillas (which I handed over to the SO). Everything was made in house, and the salsa enhanced everything.I saw numerous other plates being delivered and I was impressed at the portions and could see the heat coming off the dishes. Food served hot the way it should be!Service was fast and efficient, the hostess was kind enough to help us move our table in the shade, and we had our waters refilled many times.The lunch and dinner menu's are drool-worthy. They have a \"2 for $25\" special during the week, and we plan on going back. It seems this is pretty standard Mexican food fare, although very well done. The other menu options include sandwiches, hamburgers and assorted soups and salads. Four stars for service, food, portions, atmosphere. This is a good place for a drink, or to chow down on generous portions.

The tomatillo (green) salsa was delicious. It was made with chunks of muddled lime, diced onion, jalapeno, and fresh chopped cilantro. This red salsa has a spicy kick so beware if you have a delicate palate. \u00a0 \u00a0We started by ordering appetizers and when we realized how filling they were we didn't order a main dish. We ordered Carne Asada Nachos, corn rolled flautas,and chilaquiles. \u00a0All three appetizers were delicious! \u00a0They put a mound of fresh guacamole on top of the nachos, fresh diced salsa, lots of cheese, and the carne asada was layered underneath. \u00a0It took some work to get to the meat but once we revealed the carne asada we enjoyed every bite. \u00a0We special ordered the Flautas to be made with corn rather than flour tortillas, since my friend \u00a0Dee is allergic to flour. They were flash fried and thus were'nt greasy as they sometimes can be. \u00a0The chilaquiles were made with shredded pork carnitas. \u00a0The seasoning was not too spicy but had enough spice so that it was not bland. \u00a0Florez Bar and Grill is a great place to meet friends after work. \u00a0Their happy hour menu and drink specials are generous and economical. \u00a0Added bonus:Friday Happy hour is from 3 - 6 pm, and 8 - 10 pm. \u00a0M - Th happy hour is only from 3 - 6 p.m.I downgraded to 4 stars because the service was very inconsistent. \u00a0There were several times when we had nothing to drink and the waitress was slow at submitting our food order.I also felt that the AC should have been working, after all this is July...Lastly, I was a bit disappointed when they waitress said she could not accept my 20% off Yelp coupon. When I asked why not she said she had to ask her manager and she took the coupon (my phone and all) to show said manager. \u00a0When she returned with a new bill she only gave us 5% off the food. \u00a0I didn't make a stink about this but should you decide to use a coupon it might be a good idea to show it in advance (before you order anything.)"], ["Angela B.", "Great little spot for living in the greenhaven/land park area of Sacramento.

Two thumbs up for Chando's!Food: My favorite item to order is the chicken quesadilla. In my opinion, this is the closest thing to an authentic mexican quesadilla. Everything inside the quesadilla, not the usual quesadilla with a side of guac and other stuff... it's all on the inside. The chicken is seasoned to perfection, extremely juicy and seasoned just right. Warm, cheesy and delicious on the inside; crispy on the outside. One of the things I like best about this quesadilla is the fact that it's not insanely oily, usually if it's soggy, you know they used a lot of oil... however, the one stays crispy throughout. I dream of this quesadilla too much. The mulitas are also amazing, basically a grilled sandwiched taco filled with cheese. Carne asada tastes better in the mulitas! Not the biggest fan of the burritos, the portion is definitely huge, but nothing really sets them apart from the next burrito. I don't care for their free chips, salsas are hit or miss. Ambiance: Outdoor seating in the back of the shop. It's covered, but still gets really hot and usually a lot of flies from my experience. It's difficult finding parking here, I'd much rather pick up and take it to go, you may enjoy your food a lot more if you do this. The times I've tried to eat there, it's really uncomfortable and just the hassle of finding parking makes me \"hangry.\" Price: Reasonably priced considering the large portions... especially if you order a burrito or quesadilla.Overall: I like Chando's a lot, definitely authentic in flavor, portions and price! However, it's a mission to get your food, so I recommend ordering ahead or ordering to-go."], ["R K.", "Cheesecake Factory used to be my families regular stop when visiting Sac from Modesto but now we are hooked to chandos!

But go there for the tacos, not the sides!"], ["Cindy C.", "Chando's Tacos: a careless and stingy business who's shameless about lying and apathetic about their customers' health. My parents and I stopped on our way to Red Bluff from Los Angeles (day one of our road trip to Canada). It had been a tiring six hour drive, and when we got here, we were absolutely starving. I had to wait in line for almost forty-five minutes (of which half the time was spent baked in the sun because there weren't enough umbrellas to cover us all). The first thing that bothered me was how the lady working the register kept sliding the mini glass door open and shut whenever she talked to the customers. When she had to consult with her boss, she closed the door. When she had to talk to the customer, it opened. Why? Just get on with the orders, and stop closing the damn door - I would've had to wait at least fifteen minutes less if it weren't for this. The biggest problem I have with this business is that they LIED to my mom and me about whether there were tomatoes in any of the tacos we ordered. \"No tomatoes\", they said, when we were first ordering. We asked them repeatedly, making sure and also mentioning the fact that my dad's HIGHLY allergic to them (as this was a routine for us already). Plus, he also was the driver of this whole trip, so if anything happened to him, we would be off to the hospital instead of Canada. \u00a0We got our tacos, and the first thing my dad does is skeptically pick at the contents. Luckily, he noticed that there was some sauce that seemed to contain tomatoes, so we went back to the window, bringing these plates, checking whether there were any. And the conversation is as follows...Me: Are there any tomatoes in these?Chando's: No.Me: Are you sure? It looks like there might be some in the sauce. Chando's: No we don't have tomatoes. Me: Is this some type of salsa on the chicken?Chando's: Yes, that's salsa.Mom: So you have tomatoes in these tacos?Chando's: No, there's no tomato.*the boss (i think it's the boss...) walks over*Boss: Is everything okay?Mom: We're checking whether there are tomatoes in these tacos.Boss: There is no tomato, ma'am. Mom: So why is there salsa?Boss: Our salsa contains pineapple, cilantro, etc. etc..., and TOMATO. I honestly do not know what they thought \"allergic to tomatoes\" meant. Needless to say, my dad was absolutely livid when he went to talk to the boss, because the boss kept denying how there were no tomatoes in the tacos. Okay, if there is salsa ON the tacos, that means that there is tomato in them. Understand? (It feels like I'm talking to first graders here...) If a person is ALLERGIC to tomatoes, then they're allergic to tomato sauce, tomato paste, tomato chunks, tomato being marinated with the meat, or the most obvious of them all - SALSA. It took so long for them to actually take the tacos back and remake them without tacos. And all they put in it were onions and cilantro, with no meat. How DISGUSTING is that - they didn't even bother trying to make it remotely edible. They wasted our time, our money, and completely destroyed Day One of our road trip. I blame you, Chando. They also overcharged us three tacos extra, even though we repeated our order at least five times to the lady who annoyingly kept opening and closing that glass door. The original bill should've came out around $17, but we ended up paying $26. I only realized this after we left the place (because we were so busy trying to figure out that whole tomato situation) - HUGE mistake on our part. Anyway, I'm definitely not sorry for this one star review because, bad service? Not the best Mexican food (haha, no offense, but I've had better and more authentic Mexican food that's cheaper and CARES about whether their food could KILL their customers. Um, yes - some allergic reactions can lead to death. Fun fact guys). And blatantly lying to our faces about the mistake they made? I guess food allergies aren't as big as a concern compared to how much business and money they get! TLDR+ do not come here if you have food allergies because they do not care about their customers' health #nuffsaid+ they want your money, not your satisfaction+ if you wanna wait fifteen-thirty minutes in the sun for average Mexican food, i question your sanity... CHIPOTLE is even better lol. + parking sucks (don't even take the time to try parking here - it ain't worth it)Bottom line? Come to Chando's Tacos if you're NOT hungry and in the mood of some mediocre food."], ["Mariah L.", "I love this place! I just wish they did Taco Tuesday.

The red sauce is also good!"], ["Judi M.", "After stalking Chando's on social media for so long, I finally checked out their Arden location. This location has an order window and covered open air seating in the back. There is limited parking in the front and additional parking on a gravel lot in the back. I got there around noon on a Friday and the line was already pretty long and stretched out onto the sidewalk. The day we went wasn't especially hot and there is limited shade for the people waiting in line. Had it been in the 100's, I'm sure standing in line would have been unpleasant.We ordered our food, which came out pretty quickly. I got three tacos (potato, fried fish and chicken) along with a birria burrito. Since this was my first time here, I wanted to try a variety, especially the potato taco, which I've been craving since I left San Jose.The burrito was a huge mess- literally! Birria is beef stew which does tend to get messy. However, this was even messier than usual since the burrito does not include any beans or rice. I didn't read their online menu close enough and assumed that it did. The meat was great, but really needed something more than a flour tortilla. The tacos were more in line with what I was expecting. Each taco was a decent size for $1.85 each. The potato was my fave! There was a red sauce that is not listed on their menu that really made the dish pop. If you have never tried a potato taco, you should remedy that very soon. The fish and chicken were also very delicious. So much so that we went to their Power Inn location the next day because we couldn't stop thinking about it.Compared to the Power Inn location, this one just pales in comparison. Like I mentioned, it's open air which I'm sure is not the best in the Sacramento heat. They have picnic tables in the back area where they store old equipment and other assorted items.

The burritos are a good size and definitely fill me up. They toast the tortilla which I LOVE. I usually get a chicken or asada burrito, but they have a LOT of different meats to choose from. I am not usually a fan of chicken in my burritos since chicken tends to be dry, but their chicken is SOOOO juicy and tender. I will usually experiment more with the different meats when I order the tacos to find out which meats I like. ALL the meats I have tried so far are VERY flavorful and tasty.

I really want to eat this during lecture but scared the smell of it will make all those tummy growling! I Cant afford to share it because i don't know who to give it to, and might end up giving it all away. lol When i finally open it up there is Chips - Plain tortilla chips, but it was soggy by the time i ate it. Rice - some plain simple spanish rice which were in a red orange color. Pretty good! Not too hard or soft, but fluffy.

The chips themselves were tasty too and not overcooked, soaked in oil, or stale. The chile relleno itself was pretty good. The pablanos had good flavor and there was plenty of cheese stuffed in them.

After a deluge of Korean meals, my parents and I were grateful for the opportunity to try some delicious California's Southwestern cuisine.

He really liked his pancakes, they were very fluffy.My mom got the most popular item on the menu, a cactus omelette. I've never really eaten cactus before (except for one time inside of a wedding cake) but I do know that cactus is a very prevalent menu item in Mexico. I tried a bite and it had a mild flavor, I didn't really know I was eating cactus. My mom's breakfast plate came with breakfast potatoes on the side.I love burritos!

I often forget about this spot with the tremendous amount of breakfast spots on the grid but this place serves equally tasteful southwest Mexican fare. Since beginning my first day of unemployment I thought I'd swing by this spot since, let's be honest, I have nothing better to do. My fellow yelper friend Diana T said, \"get to nopalitos before 10:45\" and I thought, that actually sounds like a really good idea (thanks Diana!!) Upon walking in, you immediately realize this is going to be a great spot. It's packed, it's warm, it's homey. The wonderful smell of slow cooked chile verde and seared nopales fill your nose and you almost just wanna melt into a vacant seat and take it all in. But alas, there was no time to waste as the line gets outrageous in a matter of seconds and they stop taking orders for breakfast at 10:45 in preparation for their lunch orders that commence promptly at 11am. Today I ordered breakfast burritos. I got the chile verde for myself and the cheese n yellow corn for my bubbaz (Jason j. My partner). The burritos come with southwestern potatoes, mild salsa, scrambled eggs and your choice of meat/vegetable. For between 6.95 and 7.95 you really can't go wrong with these burritos. Generous portions on a fat tortilla. YUM!The space is nice and clean with a cute little outdoors area (though it's a bit cold so the tables outside were empty today). Service is wonderful and prompt. The same lady took my order that did 5 years ago which was the last time I visited. Sweet as pie and very pleasant.

Tasty, but a bit overpriced.

I let myself get dragged here three times between 2012 to 2014 and each time was consistently awful.

Pretty much sums it up ..."], ["Eric D.", "For what you pay for, I am leaving very full. And next to that, the flavors are great. The spice was not overwhelming and the flavor was genuine.

Although 9 times out of 10 we have to wait a while to be seated, it's well worth it and they're pretty quick overall. I've had the enchiladas in both regular and mole sauce and they're wonderful, but the shrimp tacos are my weakness. I can't get enough of them!! They're drinks are typically made on the strong side, but who's complaining? Their chips and salsa are fab. Salsa can sometimes be on the spicy side, but hey, it's all authentic and did I mention delicious?!Can't wait to talk my friends/neighbors/parents into going there again for dinner."], ["Prescila B.", "This is definitely one of the better Mexican restaurants that I have had in the Sacramento area. While not everything was spot on, it was certainly better than most I've tried. The carne asada tacos were absolutely delicious, while the margaritas left something to be lacking. Overall I think our only complaint about our food was that some was a little bland and fairly greasy. The chips and salsa was very good but the refried beans were tasteless mush. I would absolutely go back and I would definitely recommend this little, but very busy Midtown Mexican restaurant."], ["Jason G.", "One of the better Mexican places in the Sacramento region, but not without it's problems. The food is above average - tacos are delicious, cheese enchiladas are good, and the ceviche is one of the best I've had. The albondigas soup can probably cure the common cold. The food itself is probably worth four stars.The problems start with the salsa - it's too spicy! I'm no longer allowed to start eating it until after the drinks arrive due to the choking hazard. Definitely not something you can guzzle with a ton of chips - not if you want to be able to taste the food afterwards. Not bad for the waistline though.The service is adequate, if a little impersonal. We often have to flag down the harried staff for refills, the check, or forgotten orders of sour cream, and the server is never the same.Lastly, the crowds can make this place a little too loud and the ever-lengthening lines are in danger of not making it worth the wait.It's probably worth a trip, just be prepared for a few little hiccups."], ["Ian S.", "Good, solid Mexican food. Legit house margs that 2-3 will put a twinkle in your eye. Get the side salad with your entree and get the cilantro dressing. Tasty. Salsa that's actually got some heat to it. Good chips.

Nice outdoor patio to chill on, as well."], ["JaneY L.", "With what i had i'll give it a four stars...i had a medium bowl of the albondiga soup with some lemon wedges corn tortillas and a small house salad with the cilantro dressing. I was excited about trying both and i have to say..the cilantro dressing was a let down..i mean it was fine just not something super special to brag about. The albondiga soup was off the hook though!

It was my first time trying a sope. The base is made from a circle of fried masa of ground maize with pinched sides. It was topped with salsa, sour cream, lettuce, and carne asada. The sope was fluffy and flavorful. The toastada was topped with shrimp, octopus, and avocado. The large chunks of octopus looked amazing, but lacked flavor. I also ordered a horchota- a Mexican drink made with rice, milk, vanilla, and cinnamon. It was refreshing and not overly sweet. The past two times I've been here, the churro cart wasn't outside. :( I wonder what its hours are. The free salsa bar and chips are another highlight.

During my visits I always left more than satisfied with my meal and in much need of a nap.The menu offers a variety of items which will be an eye opener (especially during your first visit) and you'll find yourself turning your head to cover the entire menu. On my most recent visit here I noticed that they offer breakfast items, which I find useful for customers who need a pick me up during the morning, especially if you have a long day ahead of you.The prices are decent, and competitive to any other establishments through out Sacramento or near by. My order of super nachos were only $6.10 and I couldn't even finish the entire meal. Prior to receiving my order, I was able to gather together some chips and salsa, to help by pass the time waiting and made a great appetizer.

Ive been coming here for years. I remember when they opened another spot over off of franklin blvd but the food wasn't the same.

I ordered crispy taco plate and chile rellano ala carte. The taco shell was stale and meat was very bland. The rice was okay and I didn't care for the beans. Chile rellano was also bland. The price was way too much for substandard food. I dont mind paying if the food is good. The guy at counter seemed irritated and very short with his answers to our questions. There was no greeting or connection with him. They have a chip/salsa bar which is a plus . However the chips were stale and the salsa was tasteless. I won't be going back."], ["Cruz J.", "I love this place and been going to it for years and not once have I had a bad plate every single time I go the food is delicious.

And I always loved the atmosphere! A cute fountain and just the over all look. The only 'issue' is their salsa is this weird red.. stuff. It's just ehhh. But I mean after eating at this place since I was little and a carnita platter to die for you forgive them and just shut up and eat it.

I mean, most Mexican food around Sacramento is crap these days! Our usual go-to On-The-Border, their food is just plain bad now, whereas in the past they had some of the better-tasting Mexican food. But hey, On-The-Border's margarita's are still damn good!!Anyway, food at El Novillero was outstanding, good margarita's too! What also impressed me, the restaurant is very, very clean, cater's to family's. They also have a dress code, no tank tops, which, is the uniform of the day for gangsters...and, in that area of town, lot'sa gangsters!! They also have a max of 3 drinks, no alcohol-only dining so ya gotta eat to drink.However, chips tasted a bit stale and no salt, which is ok for us folks who should not be eating salt.So I applauded El Novillero for doing stuff to keep the gangsters and wannabe's out of the restaurant.

So it kind of looks like you are sitting outside... But not. The staff are friendly and are quick to meet your requests.

The last time, the neighborhood was slightly on the sketchy side but renewal has made the other businesses come up to the curb appeal of El Novillero. Parking is just across a side street, with plenty of spaces and an attendant to make sure no one bothers the customer vehicles. Both the lot and restaurant are clean and tidy outside with well done landscaping.Stepping inside, they atmosphere is very Mexican with tasteful decorations to go with a good layout. Once you arrive in the dining area, the booths are on the perimeter with the open tables more in the middle. Booths are good sized and will seat four comfortably. Service was excellent with our drink order taken quickly with chips and salsa arriving at almost the same time. Our margueritas arrived promptly and were excellent and strong enough that a second would have required help getting back to the parking lot. Our server came back several times to check on us. The menu is extensive with pork/carnitas featured in at least ninety percent of the choices. I forgot to ask but the restaurant's origin would seem to be from Michoac\u00e1n. My wife ordered the enchilada carnitas and I ordered the carnitas super burrito. Both presentations were appealing on large platters with enough for at least another meal at home. We are both conscious of our salt intake and have been critical of other Mexican restaurants for the amount of salt in their port items but El Novillero did a good job with the sodium. They do note in their menu that the food is prepared with lard to be as authentic as possible.El Novillero is a very together restaurant and for those concerned about cleanliness, the rest rooms are spotless. They start to get full early in the evening so plan accordingly. Only negatives: Water fountain not working in the main eating area. Was a couple of years ago during our last visit. Chips were cold and not as tasty as they could be. Salsa was OK temp wise, again not 5 stars. Sour cream and guac were served in small plastic containers. Because of it's size and number of patrons, the restaurant has a slightly commercial feel to it. \u00a0Would rate it semi-romantic without any truly intimate booths.Bottom line: Upscale Mexican with excellent carnitas and service to go with it."], ["Monica M.", "I've been going here for many years now \u00a0I normally don't go out to eat Mexican food because , nothing beats homemade food.

They know what you're going to order, but still give you a second to think- just in case you might want to try something else. The food is amazing- their veggie burritos can't be beat.

I usually get the Veggie Burrito, which is less than $5, and more than I can eat. There is nothing particularly special (I mean this in a good way) about the rice, beans, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce, but magically, it all wraps up into burrito perfection in a slightly grilled, nicely \"stretchy\" flour tortilla. \u00a0I like to pour the thin red salsa into my burrito too. \u00a0If you dine in, you also get a handful of tortilla chips on your plate. Other favorites among my coworkers: carnitas tacos, chicken tortilla soup, and the huge breakfast burritos. \u00a0Bonus points for offering a healthy burrito, with a whole wheat tortilla and tofu (which I haven't tried, but atleast they offer options.)Ricardo and his staff always greet me with a smile. The noontime ordering line sometimes gets long, but the food is served up quickly. Take a seat on their non-smoking patio and enjoy a sunny lunch break. Or, you can call in your to-go order.Jalepeno's takes catering orders too! \u00a0You know when organizing an office pot luck is too much trouble, and going out to a restaurant is too cumbersome with a large group? \u00a0Order Jalepeno's! Their carnitas are always a hit at office parties, and the prices are very affordable."], ["Emily F.", "Jalepenos is consistently good.

I mean, it would be nice if the beer was a bit cheaper and the food was made a bit faster, but they're a business trying to make money and good food takes time to make; so I can't fault them on either of them."], ["Brittany S.", "The food and service are usually very good at El Burrito. I have enjoyed most of the food that I have had there. That being said, the reason I have only given it 3 stars, is due to an incident that I recently had there. On that particular evening, I ordered a dish that I had previously gotten and loved, the Camarones al Mojo de Ajo. When they brought it to me, it was not the same dish that I had received before. I explained to the server that I ordered the dish previously and it was entirely different. The woman told me that I was wrong and I must have ordered the wrong menu item and that next time, I need to order the Camarones a la Diabla. However, I am positive that I ordered the Camarones la Mojo de Ajo the last time I was there. I would have never ordered the Camarones a la Diablo because it has Chipotle in it, which I do not care for. This conversation went on for about five minutes. I was unable to eat the dish because it was literally just shrimp olive oil and more salt than should ever be in any dish. Either they gave me the wrong dish when I initially tried it, or they left out the a key ingredient; the minced chile guajillo.Although I haven't gone back because of this incident, \u00a0the food is usually very tasty and we'll prepared."], ["Kristi R.", "Family of 5 for dinner tonight.

I also ordered a tostada what was also delicious! The tostada come with fresh salsa, guacamole, sour cream, refried beans, lettuce, and a choice of meat which I selected beef! My lady ordered the fish burrito which she enjoyed! It was a giant Burrito full of rice, fish and cheese. The service was outstanding!!! Check this out.... As soon as we paid for our food and took our number to place on our table, my tacos were already coming out!!!!! It was awesome!!! Also, the employees checked on us quite a few times to make sure we were okay which is always a good feeling!They have plenty of TV's to watch the games!

The decor wasn't the best the seat was horrible but I ignored that and eat my yummy food!"], ["Dana L.", "My first visit I entered the establishment and immediately felt like I was not welcomed. I ignored it because I looked lost at their giant menu. I ordered their special soup, Pozole and super nachos with pastor to go. Total ended up being around 15-16 bucks. That's pretty steep for soup and nachos but if it was great food then I didn't mind. I sat for about 10-15 mins and realized it was taking long. Took a walk around the corner and there's a salsa bar. I love salsa and chips. Grabbed some. Sat back down and another 10 mins goes by. Finally I get my items, go home and check it out. Oh, the nachos seem to have been baked? Perhaps that's what made it take longer than expected. Nachos were delicious. Over load of sour cream and guacamole. Which is always sinfully awesome. The Pozole was watered down and didn't have much flavor. Unfortunate because I expected it to be full of flavor. Second visit, same welcoming. No hello, just took my order. I decided to get the super nachos again to go with pastor. I swung by the salsa bar, grabbed the salsa and waited about 5 mins and boom!!! My nachos were ready. Yey!I did notice that the girl refilling the limes and sides at the salsa bar dumped the limes in the container and used her bare hands to pat it down. Please put on a glove.Got home. Ate through it and noticed the pastor was all bundled up and a little dried. Took another bite and felt it to be sharp and crunchy. What is this?? Spit it out and as I'm spitting it out, there's more pieces I'm pulling out...It was fish bones. And there was even a piece of skin too.I honestly got grossed out and majority of my meal was still there. Perhaps cutting meats in the same vicinity as cooking it should be closely examined. This can also question the cleanliness of their utensils or prep area. \u00a0Why?!! I had such faith because the first nachos were delicious! It just is a shame that cleanliness and customer service seems to be the downfall of this establishment. Cutting corners and lack of a warm welcomes seems to be the trend. I'd love to come back and try the other things on the menu but everything is questionable. 2 stars for hit and miss."], ["Rc C.", "Not sure what happened, we have been coming here since \u00a02009. The service and quality of the food has gone down. Meat twice now has been dry, The beans recipe is changed. Maybe the business got sold? Who knows.

Nothing too special here folks. The line for food and amount of business they get is kind of surprising. I had the asada plate and it was nothing to write home about. There was nothing special about the rice and beans. The salsa bar was less than tasty as I had to try them all before deciding the white sauce was the best! The margarita was tasty and came in a large glass. I barely tasted any alcohol but it was nice and cold as the large glass was full of ice. I'm assuming they just pre-make the margaritas and pour.This restaurant is kind of dirty. I made my way to the back where I sat at a sticky table and watched some tv. The back room had some sort of saloon doors blocked by a booth. Looking there they have a light to attract flies. There were lots of dead flies so I'll just end with that and say I'll probably never come back."], ["Anum A.", "I've been here a few times at this point but our latest visit was a little disappointing. Upon entering, the girls at the register pretty much ignored us and we picked what we wanted to eat and sort of just stood their waiting for them to finish their conversation.

Our order was finally taken and we were seated.At this point I must point out their salsa bar. It's pretty awesome! Quite a few varieties, and they had a crema sauce that I became pretty obsessed with. \u00a0Salsa bar has been well stocked each time I've visited. \u00a0We snacked on chips as we waited for our order. Now I recall that the other times I've visited, our order was brought out very quickly. The wet burritos are great but I can tell the Enchilada sauce they are covered in is prepackaged. Most likely canned sauce. No biggie, the California burrito itself is delicious and filling! Unfortunately i waited really long for my taco salad. It was tasty and really well sized but I was frustrated from waiting.The food here is usually pretty good. The service needs serious improvement."], ["Crystal C.", "I've been a regular here since they opened shop. \u00a0 I usually go for dinner and on the weekends. \u00a0I tried all of their taco meats; they are all tasty.

They are generous with the shrimp in the tacos. \u00a0The shrimp always taste fresh. \u00a0The salsa bar is awesome; other taquerias should take note. \u00a0They have a pretty diverse variety of salsas. \u00a0They keep the chips and salsa area clean and stocked. \u00a0But there are a few employees that could be nicer and answer customers \u00a0menu questions in a friendlier way. \u00a0 Tonight I witnessed the cashier having almost no tolerance in explaining meat types. \u00a0On the other hand, there was another employee \u00a0that was quite charming and engaging with the customers as she bussed tables."], ["Rebecca D.", "First time my boyfriend and I ate here.

They also have chip and salsa bar with is awesome! They have TONS of drinks to choose from. Sodas, juices, beers, margaritas, and mexican beverages.

I love their taco salads and burritos but the quality and consistency is spotty. I usually get the vegetarian taco salad but I am more likely to find shreds of carne asada or chicken mixed with the veggies, which may be like finding an onion ring among fries but it's not a cause of celebration for vegetarians. My cat is definitely appreciative but I hate having to sort through my food as I am eating to make sure there are no surprises. The other issue is with the quality of the veggies, specifically the tomatoes, that they use in the taco salad and the pico. Rather than toss the small bit of the stem from the tomato, it is always center stage in the dish. Finally, the salsa and veggies are not always strained completely so if you are getting takeout, the taco salad or burrito may start to disintegrate towards the bottom before you get there. Despite the quality control issues, I really love the food here and it tastes amazing. Their items are all affordable and it is nice to have a Chipotle alternative if you are in the mood for Mexican."], ["Marco S.", "WORST SERVICE EVER!!!

Although I should know better, she didn't say that the guac and sour cream was a couple bucks extra. She actually didn't even talk much. Then my burrito...it looked so good on Yelp I had to order it. It was a carne asada 'wet' burrito XMAS style, with sour cream sauce,half green half red sauce. MY FIRST BITE WAS SO SALTY I ALMOST SPIT IT OUT! I couldn't believe it. I don't know what it was that was so salty it may have been the sour cream sauce (creama). My very first meal at this place was disappointing.

In fact, we've been here twice in the past 8 days and, as I type this review, my stomach is growling with anticipation for my next meal here. The first time we went, there was a decent group of diners in the relatively small restaurant. We were seated right away and the service was prompt and attentive. The waitress brought us complimentary chips and salsa, as well as a sample of their aguas frescas, a fruit-flavored beverage that was both sweet and refreshing.For starters, we tried the croquetas de jaiba y chorizo, pan-fried potato croquettes with crab and chorizo. The flavors were delicate and savory--pretty much perfection. For our main dishes, we got the chile poblano relleno de queso and the enchiladas de mole. Both of which were delicious. When we finished our meal, we agreed that we wouldn't Yelp our experience. Not because they didn't deserve a stellar review (they truly did), but because we were hoping the place would stay under the radar a little longer.The second time we went, the place was a dead zone. It was 12pm on a Saturday and we were the only people in the place. We tried the chicken and beef sopes, and the chicken flautas--both of which were excellent. This time when we left, we decided we had to Yelp our experience. I mean, this place has to pick up business or it might not make it and I can't have that happening to my favorite Mexican restaurant.

Our first visit is outlined in detail below, followed by the most recent experience.Having wanted to try a new gourmet Mexican restaurant (after all, there aren't any in Sac that I know of?) that recently opened in our hood, we called on a recent Saturday night and were told by the owner that they might have a table around 7:30pm. As a favor, she agreed to call me when the table was ready for us. That turned out to be a one-star bonus as we were able to kick back at Bonn Lair in grand style, enjoying foamy pub pours and sporting beer mustaches whilst awaiting our phone call.As sure as 49ers drink & drive, our call came at 7:29 pm and we were off, dashing across Folsom Blvd and only suffering a glancing blow from a distracted texting driver. What a nice surprise to walk in to the tune of \"Girl From Ipanema\" as I ushered my Brazilian-born sweetie through the front door. Yup, live lounge music as smarmy as it gets, and just perfect for the occasion.The new owner/chef, originally from Tequila Mayahuel, has done a fantastic job in creating dishes celebrating Mexican cuisine and heritage, artfully arranged and exploding with interesting and exciting flavors. \u00a0We decided on the nopales verde soup and the arrachera steak, based on the extensive explanation from our Mexican-born waiter, Eduardo.The soup was delicious, with a savory, clear broth accented by the flavors of the ingredients. While the steak arrived slightly under cooked (by my standards, a medium rare is a bit more red and striated), it was a large (10 oz) serving, under slices of marinated nopal and queso. En mi libro, a taste worthy and tender arrachera requires a day or two marinating in Mexican beer and lime juice, and this dish did not disappoint.Decor? the new paint and interior are very inviting. Casual yet nicely done. Friendly staff, delicious food. Desserts? We were too full. That's what \"next time\" is for, si?FOLLOW UP VISIT: We had been jonesing for another meal at Cielito Lindo, so we coaxed our friend (and Mexican dining aficionado) to join us. Second experience didn't live up to our expectations: the soup was a tad off, and the service, from a different waiter, was below par. Still enjoyed our meal, but hoping next time it's back up to \"stellar!\""], ["Luci N.", "They're closed temporarily due to a fire that destroyed most of the kitchen. Check their FB page for more..."], ["Sam B.", "Fantastic meal from top to bottom. Quite possibly the best Mexican food I've had.Let's get to the specifics, shall we? This is a very small restaurant, which makes me fear that I'll have to do some waiting once word of this place really gets out. It's also not what you might generally expect. It looks like it was once a quick service restaurant, and you don't truly get a sense of what the place will be like until you step inside. It's probably closer to fine dining than a place where you just go to get a burrito. The tables are nicely done, and the staff looks about as professional as you can get with ties, vests, etc.As we sat down to check out the menu, our waiter came out almost immediately to give us a small sample of soup. I believe it was cream of lentil, which may sound a bit boring, but it was anything but. The flavor hits you like a runaway train. Bold, well-seasoned flavors from what looked like a very simple soup. And let's be honest, you're winning me over right off the bat by giving me free food.Feeling more than slightly hungry, we went with an appetizer (the empanaditas) to start. I went with the rib eye and chorizo for my main course. And heck, we decided to go with dessert too. That ended up being orange and ancho chili flan. We were also treated to fresh chips and a pair of salsas somewhere in the middle. And top it off with a pineapple celery aqua fresca. Needless to say, I was stuffed. There was much more focus on presentation than I'm accustomed to, and everything looked amazing. But food cannot survive on looks alone. Thankfully, the flavors were on target as well. I was especially happy with the steak/chorizo/mashed potato flavor combo from my main dish. I usually don't really enjoy chorizo, but everything was tasty, and it tied together wonderfully. I could also eat those empanaditas pretty much all day.I'd mention weak points, but they don't really exist. The bill was quite reasonable considering just how much food we ate. The service was top notch. It felt like we were sitting down with family to share a meal.I look forward to coming back and trying more, and I plan on returning just as hungry if at all possible."], ["Jared F.", "First time eating there and it was quite an experience. The facility looks beautiful, the atmosphere is friendly and family oriented, and the food was impeccable!

I was intrigued by the chef's (Ramiro Alarcon) desire to bring a new level of Mexican gastronomy to Sacramento. Having traveled throughout Mexico I knew that we have been shortchanged by the limited range of Mexican food offered in Mexican restaurants here and in other cities. I have been waiting for such an approach for a long time. To date, I have often stated that Centro Cocina was the best Mexican kitchen in town; now I can say that they have been challenged and probably surpassed by Cielito Lindo. The place is small and appears to be a former fast food building, but it is bright, comfortable and the service was very good. Now the food. We tried a small appetizer plate of shrimp ceviche served on tostones (freshly made chips). I followed by an incredible cup of rajas de poblano soup, a light cream based soup with corn. I was surprised by the spicyness and the explosion of flavor. With this dish, I knew I was in a place unlike Mexican restaurants I have rarely known in this country. For entrees my wife had an authentic chicken mole poblano (Puebla style) with the sauce made in-house, and I had the huachinango (red snapper) topped with a green sauce with flavor throughout. Both portions were plentiful and each had a small but generous side of delicious and herbed white rice. With that we were completely satisfied and each took a portion home to complete at a later time. We also selected the fresh \"agua\" of celery and pineapple--a first time flavor and quite fresh to drink. We had no room for the desserts, but there will be other times to try other items on the menu, I assure you of that. At the time of our visit, the paperwork for a beer and wine license was not complete but would be in place in a week or two we were told. At the end, we were greeted by the wife of the chef and co-owner, Claudia Alarcon, and we talked of her wonderful food and our pleasure in our meal. They do catering and the restaurant seems to be able to seat 25-30 at any one time. I will be back and I will bring friends. While I love tacos, enchiladas, carnitas and carne asada, I am glad to see a place that will stretch our understanding of Mexican cuisine."], ["Jonelle C.", "Missing this place so much, it wasn't available to us long enough.

I have been to dozens of mexican restaurants in the sacramento area and use my experience there and from my own mexican heritage to judge how good and authentic any restaurant I go to might be, and I will admit that I am not that easy to please. Having said that I hope that helps to add some weight to my words when I say that I Cielito Lindo is unlike any other mexican restaurant I have ever been to in the sacramento area, and I was completely amazed by the quality of food and service I received at \u00a0this place. From the outside it looks like just another typical mexican place but from the moment you walk in the door you can tell that is not the case. Unlike any other place I've been to in this area Cielito Lindo has a professional chef making the dishes. Also, the servers dress and act like they would at a four star restaurant. They are extremely professional, courteous, and knowledgeable. Eduardo, our server, could give us detailed information on every dish we asked about. From what ingredients went into it, to what reviews have said about it, to what is own personal opinion was on it. In addition, he was also very friendly and personable. Our drinks were always filled the moment we emptied them and our plates were always bused the moment we finished them. The decor was also nicer than you would expect from a typical mexican place. Clean white table cloths cover every table. And the interior has clearly had a lot of effort put into it to make it look pleasing. Now let me move on to the food. Oh wow, the food. Before we even got to our meal Eduardo brought us some chips, salsa, and pico de gallo. Very common fare at most \u00a0places like this, but this was different, the Pico de gallo was made with tomatillos instead of the usual tomatoes. It was flavorful and not nearly as spicy as usual pico de gallo, which pleased my girlfriend, and the chips were the freshest I had ever tasted. \u00a0The main dish was fantastic as well and the closest I have ever seen to something you would actually get from a restaurant in Mexico. And then the dessert. Holy cow. I got the Tulipan de Frutas. Which is a small cup made out of chocolate filled with orange cream and chopped pieces of mango and Kiwi fruit. It looked and tasted incredible. They are even vegan friendly there! Which is also great news for my girlfriend. They are very accommodating and wiling to change around any dish to suit your tastes. And Eduardo told us that they plan to expand the menu to include more vegan options. This place is simply the most amazing find I have found in years and I would VERY highly recommend it to anyone."], ["Harrybobo L.", "Four and one half starsProbably as elegant of a Mexican restaurant that you'll find in Sacramento with white tablecloths and vest and tie wearing service staff. \u00a0It used to be a cheap noodle joint called PGR Noodle but it has transformed to nt your average taco stand. \u00a0By the way there are not taco, burritos or salsa bars. \u00a0The main course average about $18 or so and the food was magnificent. \u00a0We ordered]ed both the red snapper and swordfish and they were meticulously cooked with a cilantro and pico de gallo sauces sitting atop a bed of spinach and corn and accompanied with lightly poached beans. \u00a0Sorry..no tortillas but each dinner was complimented with that night's special appetizer. \u00a0Opening night last thursday was a delicious shredded beef empanada. .

The signage for the strip mall does not have the full name of the restaurant. Secondly, the entrance is really small and non-descript. However, when you walk in, they have a nice dining area to the left. You order at the small window and take a seat. Their menu is pretty small, but it has the Mexican basics (burritos, tacos, nachos, tortas and tamales) along with Salvadorean basics (pupusas, tamales, yucca con chicharon and fried plantains).I ordered the beans and cheese pupusas, cheese and chicharon pupusas, side of rice & beans, and Salvadorean chicken tamale. The pupusas were all excellent, especially the chicharon. The rice and beans were very tasty! The rice seemed more like Salvadorean rice since it was fluffier and had pieces of bell peppers and tomatoes in it. That is exactly how I like it!The BF said the chicken tamale was great.

The pupusas came out with the usual condiments of pickled carrots \u00a0& cabbage and salsa. For those who don't know, pupusas are like round flatter burritos. The pupusas were very flavorful and my wife loved them. The El Salvadorian pork tamale was outstanding. They were steamed in banana leaves and filled with moist pork, potato, chick peas, and green olive. The masa was so light and moist. You could taste a hint of the banana leaves in the masa.

Probably would opt for no cheese next time)- DAT SAUCE. (request the \"hot\" sauce. don't worry, it's more flavor than heat)- Carnitas Sopes were on POINT.Cons- NoneThe woman who runs this establishment is super cute/friendly and makes you feel at home.

I've also tried their atoles (hot drinks) which were actually really good and probably what I look most from there.I would rate on a low 4 because although the food is decent, there is one complaint I have that sometimes sways my decision if I want to order food from there: receiving your food takes a really really long time. Even when I call and order ahead of time I end up having to wait when I'm there. I've really only seen 1 or 2 cooks even during busy times, which is what causes the lag.P.S. I'm sure it's been mentioned before but they only take cash.Overall, I'd recommend people to try it and see what their take on it is."], ["Lacey C.", "The pupusas and curtido (they called it vinagretted cole slaw :O yikes) were good! Everything else was not.I only got one pupusa, because I'm picky about my pupusas and if they are bad, they are REALLY bad, and the fact they called it cole slaw made me worried. So I thought I'd also order a fool proof dish as my main as a just in case. Boy was I wrong.I ordered nachos and they came out with crappy congealed cheese (like the kind you get at 7-11) a little pico de gallo and some not so great guacamole and pickled jalapenos. The lady at the counter was a little rude too, and forgot the curtido at first, so we had to go up to the window again and get it. Probably not going back, although the pupusas were decent, the TV with the volume way too high and the bad nachos and rude service were enough to turn me off."], ["Jhoana P.", "I've only had the popusas at this place and that's all I need to try to give them 5 stars.

My mouth is watering as I remember last week's dinner!I called in an order for pickup last week on a whim before my boyfriend and I headed to a movie. There wasn't a menu posted, so I went off of people's recommendations (thanks, Yelp friends!) and ordered 2 chicken tamales, 2 chicken tacos, and 2 pupusas (one jalape\u00f1o and one bean/cheese), along with a small horchata.DELISHH!!! In fact, these are the best pupusas I've had. I prefer ones that aren't meat just because they seem to always be so dry, so the bean and cheese one was just perfect. The tamales were killer, the tacos surprisingly flavorful and not greasy, and the salsa dangerously spicy. I loved it and licked my salty fingers clean :)Others mentioned the sketchy parking lot. I saw no such problems and came alone on a weeknight at 5 PM. Parked right in front, ran in for my food, and walked out with no problems."], ["Lori N.", "Pupusas, pupusas, pupusas, that's what I came here for & that's what I got! The lady taking our orders was a complete sweet heart & made some great recommendations for what to order. Per her request, I had the chicken & cheese pupusa & the loroco pupusa. Unfortunately, I can't say these were the greatest pupusas I've ever had. I mean, they were good, but I found them to be a little small & a little soggy. And they're a bit pricier than pupusas normally go ($2.45 - $2.75 a piece).But if I ever found myself in the area, I'd definitely consider picking up a pupusa snack."], ["Karyn G.", "Love just the straight cheese or the zucchini and cheese pupusas.

I didn't know what pupusas were until I found this place on yelp but I knew I wanted to try them because they have cheese in them. When I walked in I couldn't see the different types of pupusas there were on the menu until I walked up to the counter. I ordered the pupusa with cheese and jalapenos ($2.45 for one). I expected it to be bigger like a quesadilla but it was about the size of a small pancake. It was yummy especially with the salsa and I wished I ordered two. The cabbage was pretty good too. The downside is that it was pretty greasy. I should have blotted some of the oil before eating it."], ["Helen T.", "I was searching for a restaurant around Natomas through Yelp and this came up. \u00a0Thank you fellow Yelpers! This place did not disappoint.As suggested, I tried the chicken pupusa. It was pretty good and the pickled cabbage condiment was a nice compliment. I also tried the Salvadorian tamales, which have chickpeas, jalape\u00f1os, and shredded chicken. The filling was delicious and the masa had a good texture to it.My husband tried the chicken special with bell peppers and onions. It is worth noting that the chicken was very flavorful, unlike the dry and burnt meats you typically get in most Mexican restaurants.As for the atmosphere, it is pretty much a hole in the wall Mexican restaurant in a sketchy neighborhood. It is not a place you want to be late at night. On the bright side, the lady behind the counter was sweet.I am giving this place a 5 based on the food and what you would expect from a hole in the wall restaurant.

The cooks were in the back laughing like it was sooo funny. I feel if u do not speak spanish then they discriminate against u right off the back.

Carne Asada Super Burritos x2 @ $6.10 each were the poison of the night and they were true super burritos in size and served up to us within 5 minutes or less after we ordered. And I only ate half of mine saving the other half for lunch the following day and it reheated remarkably well too with a good 1/2 cup of sour cream to drown it in from home too.... Yummy! I had one hell of a long work day and was wanting some delicious adult elixir to quench that thirst so was thrilled to see that they served booze so I went with a Coors light which was icy cold and delicious along side the burrito. As always burrito was ordered minus the rice but was full of freshly prepared, perfectly cooked and tender pinto beans, cheese, sour cream and asada. So far one of the better asada burritos I've had on my search for the best carne asada burrito in Sac. The meat isn't grilled which is how I prefer it as it gives it so much more flavor verses the boiled/simmered type like they serve here... I did dislike however that they did not attempt nor offer at all to make up for the void of space within the burrito that the rice would have filled and should have as there was entirely too much tortilla if that makes any sense at all; next time I will specifically request them to however with either extra beans or maybe even a lil extra meat and beans and see if they attempt to charge for it or not which they shouldn't. I know how cheap rice is to purchase and make however that is irrelevant. Self refill on the soda's too which I love as I have a thing for fountain drinks and love the self serve option so you don't have to depend on an employee to get your drink on. I LOVE LOVE LOVE flaming hot food and was blown away as soon as I sunk my teeth into the first of what would be many pickled jalapenos from their salsa bar as immediately my entire mouth lit up with the waves of mouth numbing heat as the pickled juice and jalapeno flesh scorched it...... IT was amazing and the highlight of the entire meal for me actually... No joke it was as my mouth, lips, throat and stomach were toasty warm for a solid hour after the meal was done...
