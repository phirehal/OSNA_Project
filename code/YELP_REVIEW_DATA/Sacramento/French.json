{"Iron Horse Tavern": [["Rebecca K.", "I went here a couple weeks ago for brunch. Boy was it busy! They do offer texting to let you know that your table is ready. To start, the atmosphere was hipster and very trendy. We arrived for brunch around 1 pm and it was about a 30-45 minute wait. The service was good. Our server came back to check on us regularly so no complaints there. We ordered a few dishes.We ordered the loco moco, chili relleno, and the stuffed French toast. The loco moco was flavorful and even had bits of Chinese sausage (lap Cheung). I loved the chili relleno, which was full of flavor and the sauce just made the whole dish. The black beans really complimented the sauce and the crispy tacos gave the texture that it needed. As for the stuffed French toast, I would not eat it again. I have a huge sweet tooth and it was way too greasy. Towards the end, the grease made it difficult to finish. It left a gross feeling.I gave this place four stars because of the wait and also the greasy stuffed French toast. If you go here for brunch, make sure you don't go hungry cause the wait may make you hangry! Also, if you park in front of the place at night, and don't eat there, you will get a parking ticket (I found this out after eating at Burgers n Brew across the street). Don't make the same mistake I did and waste $50!"], ["Jason G.", "Yelp needs 1/2 stars. \u00a0I would do 3.5.Great beer selection, good food. \u00a0Great happy hour.Have been for brunch a few times, great. \u00a0Lunch once, great, happy hour great. \u00a0prices of the food go along with the quality. \u00a0Good value.Ok; service is inconsistent. \u00a0One time great, one time terrible. \u00a0Doesnt matter the size of our group. \u00a0Bar prices are very high. \u00a0they must think they are in San Fran. I guess you have to pay for the rent and the building somehow. \u00a06.50 for a well rum is a little ridiculous.I will go again, just wish the service was as high as the charge for the drink."], ["Ronny S.", "Hi-ya!Ok, we stumbled over here after eating dinner and drinking at a ramen house and repeated the process here. Our server (Erica) or as we called her...WP was on point. Cheerful and friendly she quickly got us drinks, food and kept them coming.The pizza was ok and deserts definitely good. The drinks were great and kept us buzzing...note to self do not order hard apple cider again...not a good drink.The atmosphere was a lot of fun, loud and worth the money. \u00a0Great experience with friends."], ["Paulamertha A.", "We decided to dine here for our family outing. Upon arrival, we were greeted very rudely by the bouncer/security or whatever the hell his position is called. I didn't let that bother me because I was hungry and still having a good time. When we entered the building, we were greeted and seated right away. Our waitress and the men helping her bring out our food and drinks were very friendly, which canceled the douche experience before we entered the building. Our food was delicious! Although the food may seem somewhat overpriced, they give you large portion sizes and the food is well worth it.After our meal, when we were heading out that same asshole \"bouncer\" decided to say a smart remark about some of my family who mistakenly thought other doors were the way out. I guess he thought no one heard him or that I wasn't with them, but I heard it loud & clear and I was livid. I didn't say anything until after I used the bathroom, which gave me sometime to calm down (haha!). After I handled my business, I met up with my family and exited the building. I was the first one out of the building and sure enough that bouncer was giving my family dirty looks. I'm not sure why he didn't notice me both times, but this time I had my opportunity to say something. Long story short, he ended up telling us \"bye guys, thanks for coming to the Iron Horse Tavern\" then retreating inside the building. We had a wonderful dining experience here, but I'm not sure why the \"bouncer\" (with a stick that was very far up his ass) decided to be extremely rude to us. We're paying customers just wanting to have a good time and something good to eat like everyone else in there, but for whatever reason he disliked us. If we didn't have such a rude experience, I would've given this place 4 out of 5 stars; however, since their \"bouncer\" was extremely rude to my family, I'm giving this place 2 out of 5 stars."], ["Jay K.", "I am a fan. I'm between an A-Ok and a fan.Let me start with my biggest concern of all downtown eating. Parking S-U-C-K-S. And I cannot imagine people not circling around for ages during busy hours. I came here at 11:30 on a Tuesday and I still had to go down two streets and find parking. I don't know what \"parking lot\" people talked about in the reviews, but keep in mind all the little lots in the area are for permits/reserved cars so don't even attempt. Street parking is the only way, good luck. It kind of kills it, especially during the winter time it's a bit rough. :(Moving forward! Greeted nicely and immediately seated as we beat the lunch time rush of the downtown workers. I got a raspberry mocktail which I enjoyed. I'm not a big fan of alcohol, but greatly enjoy a sweet little drink to accompany my meal, so this was nice. My girlfriend had a mimosa, it was alright to me. It was a bit strong for my taste, but she seemed to enjoy it. We shared the asian tacos and I tried the macaroni trio. I got a bit tired of the pasta, it was wonderful, but I think it was a bit much for me. I tried the pesto, jalapeno, and the truffle macaronis and I found the pesto was my favorite. The tacos were also nice. Fluffy with yummy bulgogi beef. I think we talked too much because our food got a bit cold. Oops!I was actually more focused on having dessert, which is always my goal. We tried the french toast with berries and vanilla ice cream. It was yummy, not out of this world or anything but it was good. It took forever to get though. That was probably the only gripe. \u00a0Overall it was a great spot for us having a brunch/lunch. \u00a0This wouldn't be a spot I'd frequent a lot unfortunately because the parking situation is about as bad as it can get, but still thoroughly enjoyed the meal and company."], ["Olivia S.", "After passing by this restaurant many times & hearing about it from friends, the hubby & I decided to try it out! WE LOVED IT! We were sat at a booth inside & our waitress came quickly to get our drink orders. I ordered my Rasputin stout (one of my faves) & hubby ordered a brown ale that he later stated was even better than his beloved Moose Drool. We ordered beer battered chicken wings to start off our meal. I ordered the lobster paella, which the aroma alone was amazing!!! It has mussels, shrimp, lobster, saffron rice, red peppers & peas! The rice was cooked perfectly & all the seafood was tender & not over cooked at all! Soooo damn yummy that I ate the whole damn bowl! I could've taken some home as leftovers, but when I looked down at my plate is was pretty much demolished... So what the hell right?!?! The hubster ordered the fried chicken sandwich w/ fries & said that he LOVED the fried chicken w/ the blue cheese & buffalo sauce (his faves all together). The atmosphere was dark & at our booth in the corner, made us feel somewhat secluded from the larger parties in the middle (yay for us)! We really enjoyed everything about this restaurant: the staff, food, beer, booth we were sat at... Really everything! We will most definitely be back!"], ["Erin H.", "Came here for brunch on a busy football Sunday. \u00a0The wait wasn't too bad- maybe 30 minutes or so.Service was great- pretty attentive and friendly. \u00a0Or drink order got backed up a little but but I appreciated our waitress coming by to apologize and notify us that the bar was really busy.Food was amazing. \u00a0The biscuits and jam were so good, I highly recommend them. \u00a0I got the green eggs and ham which was surprisingly tasty. \u00a0The pesto scrambled eggs were moist and full of flavor. \u00a0The ham steak was huge- the size of the plate. \u00a0The bf got the loco moco was had a unique spin to your usual loco moco (chinese sausage mixed into the gravy). \u00a0The portion was good but in my opinion it was a little bland.Overall, I really enjoyed the atmosphere, service and food here. \u00a0Will hopefully be returning soon."], ["Ellen H.", "Love their happy hour! We got brandy fried chicken, which was so juicy, tender and flavorful. Huge portion. Also love their Korean tacos, which come with thick Chinese style buns. Their mac n cheese were bland (we got trio of lobster, truffle and chicken chorizo). I didn't try it but my friends liked the tuna poke nachos. The garlic shrimp pizza was flavorful with crispy crust and just the right amount of heat from chili flakes.Friendly service. We sat in the outdoor patio and it was very comfortable with the heaters. I would definitely come back for happy hour because it is such a great deal and the food is yummy."], ["Nha N.", "I've been here twice now, both times to celebrate a friend's birthday during a weekday lunch. The first time I had the buffalo egg rolls, which was meh. My friend had the short rib strogi and that was delicious. The second time, another friend and I shared the roasted turkey club and the triple mac (lobster, pesto and chorizo). Both were pretty good. We were excited about the mac and cheese options and while I thought they were good, the flavors weren't too distinguishable to me and it was all quite heavy and greasy. In terms of drinks, I've had their mimosas and Daybreak cocktail. Both were tasty AND beautiful to look at, especially the latter with the flowers in the ice cubes and pretty good. The service was good. What I enjoyed most, was the overall chill vibe of the place. That experience probably enhanced by the beautiful, slightly warm day that allowed us to eat outside. All in all, I'd still come back to hang."], ["Jasmine C.", "I love this place, specially for happy hour, we had great experience with the foods and they not skimpy on the food either for happy hour.1/2 off appetizer and pizza for happy hour.Tavern combo pizza really good, basically meat lover pizza without veggie, hubby eat half of it.Sweet and spicy shrimps really good too, creamy with a little sweet and not spicy at all with fluffy batter on the shrimps.Brandy chicken nuggets coming with fries, basically their homemade chicken nuggets with their homemade brandy dipping sauce.Beignets for dessert of course and was the best thing, after all the meals mentioned above, was thinking going to had only 1, but ended up with 3.Beignets coming with chocolate, creme and berry sauce to dipped with and 10 pcs of buttery hot beignets.For happy hour, you can choose where you want to seat, at the bar, next to the booth the right side from the bar, the left side of the bar with the high stool and table and you can share your table with other people too and last one you can seat in the patio.The service was great too, our waitress is Kathy and she had to go on break and we got Gabriele.We are going back for some more foods pretty soon."], ["Mary N.", "Came here for happy hour. \u00a0Very chic with great half priced appetizers and pizzas. \u00a0The tuna nachos were very flavorful. \u00a0I loved the combo of the big wonton chips, poke, and seasoning. \u00a0The brandy chicken was super moist and crispy; very good as well. \u00a0The Asian tacos are not really tacos, but baos. \u00a0The bao was a bit thick for my liking. \u00a0The trio of Mac and cheese was a bit milder than I was expecting. \u00a0When you eat a chorizo Mac and cheese, you expect rich deep flavors. \u00a0It didn't have much taste. \u00a0The truffle did shine through on the truffle Mac. \u00a0I would definitely come back and try their dinner menu next time."], ["Dana K.", "I like choices....It's like walking into a candy store as a kid and wanting them all. As an adult I know I could buy them all but I would be sick as a dog and broke. All I would have to show for it would be empty packages of Kit Kat bars and a new 10lbs. That's how I felt when I looked at the appetizers on the menu at the Iron Tavern. The appetizers looked mouth watering good with tons of choices but my friends made me pick just a few. We ordered the pretzel, the fried pickles and onions and the buffalo chicken egg rolls. They were all good but the buffalo chicken egg rolls were the winner for sure. The pretzel, in second place came out hot, crispy, and doughy on the inside. It was accompanied by 3 dipping sauces making each bite taste unique. The fried pickles and onions were good but I think we had eaten too much fried stuff by the time they came out to really appreciate them. For our main entree we ordered the fried chicken sandwich with home made chips. The sandwich tasted divine and probably used up my calorie intake for the week but the chips tasted just ok, they were lacking flavor. We also ordered the mac and cheese trio where we each picked the flavor we wanted. I only tried the truffle mac and cheese which was good once they brought it back out hot. It was served cold and I hate cold food. We saved the best for last...dessert of course. We ordered the beignets, which was a huge basket of clouds that melted in our mouths. The serving size was huge and I knew we were going to be sick trying to finish them. We also ordered the red velvet ding dongs which I was most excited to try. However they tasted horrible, so horrible that they should be taken off the menu. My whole group hated them. It didn't taste like a ding ding at all, instead it tasted more like cream cheese in dry cake with a gross syrup on them. Fail! Service seems like it can vary on who you get. The hostesses were very nice and the waitress working in the bar area was great. \u00a0However our waitress was a little snotty and didn't seem very concern whether we were enjoying our food or not. Overall the place was good and I would definitely come back."], ["Michelle L.", "Philip R. suggested Iron Horse Tavern for a Friday evening dinner, also since their happy hour included 1/2 off appetizers and pizzas, $1 off big beers, $2 off glasses of wine, $3 off specialty cocktails and $4.50 well cocktails. I was intrigued knowing that this establishment came from the same minds who brought us Cafeteria 15L and Firestone Public House, Ma Jong's, Gogi's, Mix, and the Park. Among the bites ordered by our table: \u00a0garlic shrimp pizza, Bavarian pretzel, Tavern Mac 'n cheese, Brandy fried chicken nuggets, burger, and ahi tuna poke nachos. Basically stuck to pizzas, small plates, and the mac bar (should've gotten a trio for $10 instead of one for $8! D'oh!). Friends who got beers enjoyed, the ginger beer was quite spicy in a good way as well. Overall a nice vibe, place to hang out on a Friday night on R Street, who knew? I enjoyed that the pretzel came with three dipping sauces (peanut butter, jalapeno cheddar, and honey mustard), although the basic tavern mac really didn't stand alone well, I understand how the other toppings/options could help. Those beignets the other table ordered looked divine, haven't had good ones since NOLA 2011! \u00a0I would come back, if only I could round up my friends more often! Their breakfast/brunch menu looks really good too, gosh I need to get downtown more!"], ["Alison W.", "Pictures of food from Iron Horse has been popping up on my FB feed for the last couple months. So when I was in town, I roped two girlfriends into going to brunch with me. It was a rainy weekend morning and we waited about 20 minutes for a table. They have a pretty big patio are but not really great or used when it's rainy. They'll take your number to text you when your table is ready. Technology is so convenient. I was most excited about bottomless mimosas. My friend and I ordered mimosas and my other friend got a bloody mary. One mimosa is $7 and the bottomless option is $11 so if you have two glasses, which you can easily do, then it's worth it to get the bottomless mimosa option. I may have had 3 and half glasses. Haha, so good. Food-wise, we split the breakfast board. A cutting board with random stuff, hard boiled egg, jam, small toast, nuts, raisins, fruit, etc. I tried the chicken and pancakes for my entree. Not as great as chicken and waffles but that wasn't on the menu. Although when we were leaving, the table next to us looked like they had chicken and waffles so maybe you can do a substitution. But overall my food was delish. Chicken was crispy and juicy. Pancakes were good and I smothered them in syrup. I also liked the bourbon butter, it came with. Friends had the loco moco and Korean fried chicken. All dished were huge. Got to sit and chat for awhile and enjoy our mimosas, even though there may have been people waiting outside. TVs all around for your sports viewing pleasure. We found street parking a few blocks away. This place is sorta new and I really like it so I hope it's here to stay."], ["Paige S.", "FINALLY got to try this place out. I first came here a few months ago hoping for happy hour with friends, but they only served happy hour at the bar (including booths and tall tables) but we had too many people and there were no seats available. There was also an issue with my being ignored completely by a female bartender who immediately served my (attractive, male) friend. But, that's beside the point.The hostesses here are always amazing - friendly and prompt. I love that there are no buzzers or name-shouting; they text you when your table is ready or if they have a question, like if you mind community seating.We did have a 45 minute wait (which turned into an hour) but that's to be expected on a Sunday afternoon when sports are on. Also, why do people have to cheer so loudly? It's a restaurant, not a sports bar. I couldn't hear myself think half the time.Booze: They have a decent selection for beer and cocktails but I didn't see much in the way of cider. For having so many local beers you'd think they would have more than just Angry Orchard... I ended up with a Bloody Mary with JERKY and pork rinds in it which was delicious! The drink itself was also very tasty. Also ordered a whiskey sour that was pretty standard. Onto the food! I had the breakfast board. This came with an egg (standard is hard boiled but you can choose otherwise), Greek yogurt with honey, dried cranberries, salted Marcona almonds, peanut butter, bacon, strawberries, grapes, raspberries, blueberries, and crostini. All of it was delicious. I don't even like yogurt but I found myself mixing in the dried cranberries and eating the entire thing.Friend and husband both got the Asian style street tacos and LOVED. THEM. Husband also got an order of the buffalo chicken egg rolls and ate half of one and gave the rest away because they were that disappointing.Overall, pretty good. I'd like to come back here sometime when the crazies aren't shouting at the TVs."], ["David L.", "The happy hour is great. 1/2 off appetizers are well worth it. The poke nachos are really good and loaded with fresh fish. At $7 for HH it's a great deal, however at $14 it's a little steep for a app. I came here for lunch and felt like something light so I ordered the turkey leg and mash potatoes in gravy. The leg was crispy and the meat was fall off the bone moist. The mashed potatoes and gravy made for a good Thanksgiving feel type meal. I also tried a bite of my friends pizza which we both also liked. Yes Iron Horse is a little pricey but the food is good. I look forward to coming back for another HH."], ["Jean K.", "Came to see this place since its \"hot and new\" and had some Raving reviewsWait - kinda sucked. Got here around 1 pm for a weekend brunch and boy was this place cracking and packed! Was told that the wait would be 30 minutes. Luckily, there are loungey seats available by the bars and was able to snag 2 seats at the bar (first come first serve at bar seating!). Food took around a good 25 minutesFood - Eggs Benedict (3/5) - was interesting since they used fried potato cakes instead of muffins, but overall it was mediocre. They just topped unflavored boiled spinach on top with the hollandaise sauce on side (this too was meh) - wouldn't order this againChicken wings (3.5/5) - thick, juicy piece of meat, and good balanced flavor, just wished it wasn't so wet and soggy (I prefer the nice crunch to my wings!)***** this deserves its own categoryBeignets (5/5) first time trying these elegant looking donuts and boy was I not disappointed. Considering we ordered 2 main plates and an appetizer, I still had room for dessert! But damn was this a hefty piece... Came with around 10 beignets - both big and small. But was fresh and toasty! Gosh.. These things seriously melt in your mouth, without being too heavy and overly sweet. I liked ripping mine up to see the eggy insides and steam flaring up:) and the 3 sauces it came with was a perfect match!!!! My fave is the jam and chocolate!!! I will come here for these babies again..."], ["Kristel V.", "What's not to like... This is my \"go to\" spot for happy hour. Why? Half off regularly priced appetizers/entr\u00e9es... Full portions! Their selected drinks for HH are also decently priced and delicious. Remember, you have to sit at their HH areas to get HH prices. Must try items:Poke nachosTurkey leg dinnerStreet tacos Chicken nuggets with fries Beignets... A MUST MUST!! Their sausage pizza was kind of bland... Something was missing. The decor is fun and elegant. Customer service is good."], ["JEN M.", "First time, beautiful and very cozey inside. We had brunch. 3 kids split 1 order of stuffed french toast and i also ordered them a side of eggs and fruit. Perfect amount and sooo good! Kids were two 8 year olds and a 4 year old. I got eggs benedict. Instead of muffin its laid on potato cakes. Yum! They have breakfast tacos and \u00a0pesto eggs too although I did not try those. They had much more! Server was great, im bummed I did not catch her name... every server amd busser there stopped by amd removed dirty dishes. You could tell this is one of those restaurants where the employees work as a team and are good at it. Will be back!"], ["B C.", "I came here with friends around noon on a Sunday. There was a 45 minute wait to get a table. Unfortunately, they didn't take reservations over the phone so we just had to go in. However, you can always grab a drink at the bar while you wait. There's also a lot of TVs for those who like to watch the game while they eat.The service was great. Our servers name was Ryan and he was very friendly and on top of everything even though he was serving quite a few other tables. The food is delicious! Everything sounded so good! I went with the Margherita Pizza and Belgian Waffles. Loved them! Only compliant is that the soup of the day my friend ordered was too salty. Otherwise, great food!Also, the strawberry lemonade was bomb. Very refreshing. They also have bottomless mimosas for $11, which is always nice. Will definitely be back!!"], ["Allison L.", "My boyfriend, sister, brother in law, and I decided to go here for happy hour after Joe's Crab Shack ran out of shrimp (wtf, I know). \u00a0It looks really nice and it's always busy when we drive by, so I was excited to finally try it. \u00a0There was plenty of street parking available when we arrived around 5pm. \u00a0Happy hour is until 6 so it attracts customers coming straight from work - I noticed a lot of customers in suits/work clothes (myself included). \u00a0The host said the HH menu was available at the bar, booths behind the bar, high-top tables, and patio. \u00a0We were seated at a wooden bench style table on the patio. \u00a0The weather outside was nice and we were close enough to the building to be in the shade, which I appreciated. We decided to order a bunch of things and share. \u00a0Their HH food promotion is half off appetizers and pizzas.Tuna poke nachos: a huge plate of wonton chips with a generous portion of poke, diced tomatoes and avocados, sriracha mayonnaise, and garnished with furikake and micro greens. \u00a0I asked for no wasabi cream because I wasn't sure how wasabi-y it would be and I'm not a big fan. \u00a0This was delicious! The wonton chips were light/crispy, the fish was fresh, and the avocados and sriracha mayo added the right amount of creaminess. \u00a0I would order this again.Sweet and spicy shrimp: Like honey walnut shrimp with sriracha. \u00a0The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the sauce was addictive. \u00a0My boyfriend even dipped his pizza into it. \u00a0It's served on a bed of lettuce, which my brother in law ate because how good the sauce is. Asian style street tacos: marinated beef, shredded carrots, Asian bbq sauce, jalapeno, and cilantro all served in a bao! \u00a0Yum! \u00a0Comes with kimchee (my brother in law said it was good). \u00a0You get three to an order.Brandy fried chicken nuggets: \u00a0these are REAL pieces of chicken, not mushed up chicken reshaped into something else. The outside was crispy and the inside was still juicy. \u00a0Served with fries, ketchup, and sweet dipping sauce. This was my bf's favorite.Garlic Shrimp pizza: cream sauce pizza with shrimp, cilantro, red onions, and chili flakes. \u00a0It was sliced into 8 pieces and each piece had AT LEAST two shrimp. \u00a0I thought this was very generous. Watermelon Fizz mocktail: watermelon puree, honey, lemon juice, and ginger ale served in a mason jar, garnished with a lime wedge and li hing mui around the rim. \u00a0Very pretty and tasty. \u00a0Good alternative to an alcoholic beverage.Monkey bread: we added this at the end. Monkey bread with apples baked in a little cast iron skillet, topped with vanilla ice cream. \u00a0The top of the bread was crunchy and the bottom was soft. \u00a0Some of the cooked apples on the bottom turned black because of the pan, which looked weird, but overall it was tasty .The portions were larger than we all expected. \u00a0The food came out quickly as well. \u00a0The four appetizers came out at once, and the pizza shortly after. There are busers that clear and refill water. Our server was friendly and shared her favorite dishes with us. \u00a0She knew we were sharing so she brought us plates, which were warm. \u00a0I thought this was a nice touch.Everything was heading toward a 5-star review... until the check came. \u00a0The menu and our waitress said appetizers and pizza during happy hour are HALF OFF. \u00a0I don't know who did the math here, but it is not HALF.Brandy fried chicken nuggets are $8.95 on the menu... rang up as $4.50Asian style street tacos and Sweet and Spicy Shrimp are $9.95 on the menu... rang up as $5.00Tuna poke nachos are $12.95 on the menu... rang up as $6.50Garlic shrimp pizza $13.95... rang up as $7.00.Okay, now I know we're just talking about a couple cents here and there, but I'm not a cheapskate and I don't like feeling as if I'm being deceived. \u00a0And if you think about it, all these cents add up for the restaurant. \u00a0Why doesn't the restaurant just round up the original price so the HH prices actually ARE half off? \u00a0Also, our monkey bread was rang up as full price $7.50, when it is in the appetizer section of the menu, which should make it half off. \u00a0The worker did change the price after we asked, but I'm not sure if it was because the menu was misprinted and it shouldn't be in the appetizer section or he just did it to make us happy. \u00a0Either way, the whole pricing issue ended the meal on a slightly sour note.Nevertheless, I would return for happy hour. \u00a0The portions are fair, the food is tasty and fast, and the vibe is very relaxed. \u00a0I looked at the normal dinner menu and felt it was a little overpriced. It'd probably only eat dinner here for a special occasion kind of thing.Side note: My sister and I went to the restroom to wash our hands and they have touch faucets, which was pretty cool. \u00a0Bathroom could use some air freshener though (cough)."], ["Cynthia T.", "The first thing I noticed was the decor - it's beautiful. The hostess was very friendly as well as our waitress.Our table ordered the croque madam, shrimp garlic pizza and hamburger. The croque madam was ok. I've had better. It was kind of like French Toast with ham and Swiss cheese. \u00a0Even though it was packed - we didn't have to wait long for our meal so that was good.They have TVs and if you're inclined they have communal tables. The outdoor seating is nice and quite large.I'd probably come back here again to give it another shot."], ["Aaron T.", "Four stars for a good, solid draft beer selection, very tasty pizzas, delicious appetizers and great happy hour pricing.I tagged along with some co-workers for a happy hour to celebrate a work accomplishment, so everyone was in a good mood and ready to relax a bit. I started with a Firestone Walker 805 Blonde Ale, $7, (since they didn't have Goose Island and a few others that were on the menu) and their Tavern Combo pizza (pepperoni, Calabrian salami, pork sausage, bacon, tomato sauce, mozzarella and parmesan cheese for $13.95). The beer was actually $5 and the pizza, $7 and change, since it was happy hour. Like many Firestone Walker brews, I enjoyed the beer and the pizza was actually very, very good.At this point, I'm sold.I wrapped up with a stout -- which I can't remember the name of, since it wasn't on their menu. (I got it on the referral of one of my coworkers and was not disappointed.) So, I assume there are other drafts available that aren't on the menu. I didn't get up to look at the bar, so there's that.The restaurant itself is nice. There's a large, outdoor patio area and the bar area (where we sat) is clean and sharp-looking. The bathroom was clean and featured a somewhat disconcerting Dyson v-air jet air dryer. (Not the one that you put your hands in but one that shoots air out in a v-shape.) I mean, that's fine but just something that threw me for a loop. Hand-drying technology has advanced so much!Anyway, I had a great time and look forward to going back. The rest of the menu looks amazing and many commented on their mac 'n cheese selction. Thanks!"], ["Brainard B.", "My friend and I had a early dinner before heading out to the King's game. We were in Downtown didn't know where to go. So we yelped it and this location came up. Read some the the reviews and both of us decided to go here.I started with the Farm Fresh Salad and was surprised how well the vegetables were. All the leaves where nice healthy green leaves and was crunchy when eating it. To me the salads portions are huge.We also ordered the cheese plate which was very good. I just wish the cheeses were more of a higher grade cheese. The cheese that was on the board seem store package cheese that were just cut. But don't get me wrong, it was good. I finished my meal with a Margherita pizza. It was nicely portioned and good. The size is like a flat bread pizza. There were a lot of cheese and reds sauce on the pizza in which I like. This location is a typical bar restaurant. If you want a great place to hang out to drink and eat great food, this would be the place."], ["Serena L.", "Great brunch! Try the cinnamon apple pancakes!!! Good breakfast and great versions of the classic menu. Try the beef jerky bloody mary!"], ["Jesse P.", "Stopped in for a drink last weekend and found a spot at the bar. I ordered the \"last spike\" cocktail which is essentially a Sazerac, which is a favorite of mine. The bartender was on \u00a0point, making one of the best I have had so far. We didn't have any food, but all the meals that came out of the kitchen looked yummy. Will definitely be back!"], ["Charmaine S.", "So to celebrate my 1st official year of being in California after my move from the east coast we decided on brunch. My fianc\u00e9's cousin suggested this place since she went here last weekend and raved about it. And we now know why. It's located in the developing neighborhood of R and 15th streets. There is mostly street parking but there is a new pay lot that is near there if you are unable to get a spot. \u00a0This place has an open concept which I love. It has outdoor seating that has those big doors windows that open up into the restaurant. When you walk in the hostess stand is near the bar and open door area leading to the outdoor seating. The ladies there were so warm a friendly. This place doesn't take reservations during brunch hours I believe, but the wait was stated to be about 30 minutes. This place has a great concept of private or community tables to share with others that may come in. Pretty cool idea. They take your name and number and text you when the table is ready. So once we did that we started our bottomless mimosas tab at the bar and had a seat to watch the game and wait in these nifty nooks behind the bar area. It was probably about 15 mins later and I got a text that our table was ready. The hostess walks us over and gives us our menus and also tells us our waiter's name before he comes over. I think this is a nice intro touch. Our waiter ANTHONY was AMAZING from the start! So nice, knowledgable, and personable. He was great with suggesting and answering our questions. I ordered the Tavern Fried Chicken n ' Pancakes that comes with burbon-jalape\u00f1o syrup and 2 pieces of boneless fried chicken. My fianc\u00e9 ordered the Huevos con Chile Relleno. Both dishes were absolutely amazing. The chicken was hot and tasty the pancakes were so fluffy. And that syrup was just divine and unique. Since this was a cheat meal I wasn't able to finish all the pancakes but I sure did finish that chicken with a lil hot sauce. The Huevos was so flavorful. Anthony made sure that our glasses never stayed empty and came back to check on us and chat a lil when he could. Such a wonderful way to celebrate and watch the game. We will definitely make this a regular spot and we will always ask for Anthony if his area is available. Definitely check out this place. Definitely on my new list of brunch spots"], ["Nani V.", "I came back due to another friend's request. It was their first time, my third. This time, I ordered the ahi tuna poke nachos to share with the ladies and the tavern combo pizza. After 2 slices of the pizza, which was amazing by the way, bites of the poke nachos, a bite here and there of the other dishes, I was stuffed. I really enjoyed what I ordered; the nachos were enjoyed by everyone and the pizza, I took home. I kept eating it, a slice or two daily, until it was gone. Now, I know what to avoid and what to order. Still not my top choice of places, but once in a while I can see myself here. Our waitress did her job well, checking on us. One thing though, we got there right before six and she never mentioned that we still had a few minutes left before happy hour ended while taking our order. I didn't want to be that customer and wasn't in the mood, so I didn't say anything."], ["Nichole H.", "Tried this spot for lunch. I had the mac trio - jalape\u00f1o, lobster, and tavern. BOMB. My girlfriend had the street tacos. Also very BOMB. Every bite was delicious and the restaurant setting is beautiful. Perfect for dates :)"], ["Joann P.", "Met up with some friends around 8ish last night. Place was still pretty packed. Waited about 25min for a table. Come after 9pm if you don't want to wait. I noticed that the crowd started to clear out around that time. We were starving so we ordered Asian style street tacos, The big Leg, Beef Shortribs Strogi, and the monkey bread. Everything was pretty tasty, especially the Strogi. For some reason The Big leg came with two smaller turkey legs instead of one huge one. I think they ran out. I thought it was salty, maybe it was my tastebuds. Everything was delicious. I also ordered the mocktail Watermelon Fizz. It was good, but wished they had free refills because it was small. 2 Gulps and it was Gone!! Overall, I like this place. It's definitely good for late night eats."], ["Tracy P.", "My friend planned a brunch for 10 of us. She said this place doesn't take reservations (the website says it does) so she got there at 11:30 to put her name in. They said it would be an hour wait. We all arrived at 12:00 and weren't seated until almost 1:00! That started things off badly. Once seated we ordered drinks- most got bottomless mimosas but I got a strawberry lemonade with vodka. It was very good! I had seen the yelp reviews and pictures and wasn't sure what to order. I really thought I wanted the cinnamon roll pancakes but pushing 1:30 I thought maybe more lunch.... I got the asian street tacos as an appetizer- they were very good!! I ended up getting the juevos con relleno (chile relleno with eggs). It was really good! The very bottom was black beans - on top of that were 2 crispy fried tortillas- then eggs - then chile relleno- then sauce & cheese. The crunch of the tortillas made the dish! Make sure to get some hot sauce (they has tapatio- my fav!) because the relleno needs some spice!!! On yelp I saw they have a red velvet ho-ho! I had to try it! I'm obsessed with ho-hos! I couldn't really notice a difference from regular ho hos but the filling was more like cheesecake than a ho ho filling. The waitstaff was very friendly and surprisingly accommodated my friends that asked for all separate checks! Wow! Extra star for that!"], ["Fancy N.", "Came here for lunch and the wait wasn't that bad. We were seated in a section wedged in between 2 parties and were awfully close to them. It seemed as thought they were part of our party. As for the food, we tried the Asian Style Street Tacos, Tuna Poke Nachos, and Korean Fried Chicken and everything was pretty tasty. I tried the Iron Horse Tavern Bloody Mary and it was made pretty well. I have tasted better, but I'm glad it wasn't bad. There are so many other things on the menu that i'd like to come back and try."], ["Mandy L.", "Interesting menu going on with the loco moco, mac n cheese, and pizzas! Happy hour is Monday-Friday 3-6pm. It gets packed and busy around 5pm. They take orders fairly quickly even if you don't have seats at the bar. Take initiative to get the bartender's attention for food + drink orders, or you'll be waiting a while. Their half off pizzas are my favorite happy hour item. Request to add fresh jalape\u00f1os, it adds a nice kick :-) I wasn't expecting the basil pesto pizza to come with salami, olives, onions, and cherry tomatoes but it was still tasty. I'll try their red sauce flavors if I get the chance next time.Appetizers are also half off. The buffalo chicken eggrolls were stuffed with chicken and nothing else. I liked them but it may not be for everyone. It also came with a few celery sticks. Their monkey bread and cheesy bread looked tiny but tasty.My sister loves their trio Mac and cheese flight. The Lobster mac and chicken chorizo mac were surprisingly very bland. The only flavor I recommend is Bacon and Egg. Actually, you can make a better restaurant-style mac n cheese at home.Total for two large beers, two happy hour items, and trio mac was $40 w/ tip included. Pretty good deal but I wouldn't come again for happy hour unless a friend suggests it. There are many other options in town."], ["Karen T.", "Went here for a late lunch and had a good experience. Super cute place! I ordered the $10.95 Tavern Burger and definitely got my money's worth. The homemade chips I chose as my side were good and was more than enough. I was impressed by how quickly the food came out. Our server was also super friendly!I could have lived without the flies that kept flying around though."], ["Ameenah M.", "This place is right across the street from r15. You can't miss it. The outdoor seating is very big. Very noticeable. And the place is already very popular. You can't miss it. The entrance is on the side near dos coyote. You'll notice the very muscular security guard that opens the door for guests to enter. When you enter and turn a slight left you'll see a huge bar to the right and the host station right in front of you. To the left, it's an open patio the table looks like a picnic bench but very elegant (kind of) a much better looking picnic bench than what you would see at the park. And it's white, which probably seats 6 and a 4 top with brown chairs. Right behind the host station is a bit darker. Very upscale looking. Very pretty. Table tops. Booth tables that can fit three different parties. Very convenient during busy hours.Finally sat. Everyone's so nice. That's already a 5 star for me. Menu is the same exact style as the Firestone ( I mean come on, some type of same owners or not) What we ordered, ice tea for my twin sister, watermelon fizz ( watermelon pur\u00e9e, honey, lemon juice, ginger ale, and Li hing mui on the rim) and a black butte porter for myself . For appetizers, we ordered the wings, the mac n cheese bar trio: jalape\u00f1o,pesto, and lobster. The paella , and the monkey bread for dessert. Mm!!!!!!!What it tasted like: the tea tastes very tropical, hence the tropical ice tea. The fizz tasted like the fizz drink from Denny's. Still good but I can live without it. The porter was very good, if you like dark beers, then try the porter here, I certainly enjoyed it. The Mac trio was amazing. The pesto was my favorite. Especially with the bread crumbs on top: made it even better. (Sigh) I'm in love with it. Not too heavy, just good. The wings, were wings. Tasted like buffalo wings. Nothing amazing but nothing bad about them either. Exactly what I ordered. Now the paella I was disappointed about, it didn't taste exactly how I tasted before. Maybe that's because I tried it at the food truck convention and they added mayonnaise to it. Lol. Here at the iron horse it's just plain. But not bad, I was just hoping for more flavor. Let me tell you about this monkey bread I just ordered. I've seen it around on pictures and snap chat and now it's my turn to order it. Is it stale? Or is it because it's baked? Or is this because it's a monkey bread? I'm not a big fan of the texture because I want it to melt in my mouth like a cookie but it can't because it's bread but the flavor is really good. Would I come back? Of course, drinks were good, service was great and the Mac and cheese was good. I have to come back to try more !!"], ["Karen K.", "I've been wanting to try this establishment ever since it first opened several weeks ago. I'm so glad we did too.I was tipped by another Elite Yelper from out of town to sit in the bar areas or you will not get the half off prices. We asked the hostess if we had to sit at the bar to get the reduced prices for happy hour? She was very kind to let us know to sit in the booths area on the right side of the bar. We ended up in a booth that seated ten people easily even though it was just my HB and me!I ordered the short rib accompanied by kimchee & cucumbers & carrots, sweet and spicy shrimp with baby romaine lettuce, brandy fried chicken nuggets with French fries & the trio of Mac n cheese. For me I totally enjoyed the tasty fried shrimp with sriracha honey mayo and mac n cheese. I ordered the lobster, chicken chorizo & truffle Mac n cheese. I truly loved them as they were all equally so delish! Just a hint the mac n cheese was not half off.The short rib was okay as it did have the bones in it and that can get messy! The fried chicken nuggets entree with crunchy French fries was humongous! Reminded me of Mom's home cooking very similar to how she used to make her crispy fried chicken!The waitress enticed me by bringing the dessert menu! I decided to go ahead and order the red velvet ho-hos. It was an awesome suggestion as I totally thought it was TDF! \u00a0I only ate half and took the rest home. Yummy!!!I have to admit our waitress was so on point too! I wished I got her name! You know we will be back to try more food! We loved the cool dark ambiance of the tavern plus there was good sized outdoor patio seating which reminded me of Napa downtown or San Jose's Santana Row. Very classy and upscale! We lucked out parking just across the street too! You know we will be back to try breakfast, salads, pizzas and dinner entrees!!!"], ["William L.", "I can't believe that Iron Horse Tavern is the greatest, and the newest restaurant spot in this well-known R Street corridor! As I entered, the atmosphere is very remarkable and refreshing showing all the vintage wooden and bricks building parts that surrounds this place. The outdoor dining patio looks incredible, so you can see the view of R Street near Ace of Spades as well as other dining restaurants and bars nearby.The employees (from hosts to bartenders) have done a fantastic job! Very friendly and approachable! No problems at all!For the dining ordering process, I've ordered the Cubano sandwich which it has black, smoked ham with sweet peppers and jack cheese pressed in panini oven with fresh green salad topped with homemade dressing. So far, it tasted very good! I can feel the smoked ham flavor through my taste buds as well as the jack cheese and sweet peppers too! The greens salad with homemade dressing also tasted outstandingly good! I haven't ordered any alcoholic drinks, so I'll might be back for more next time.Parking can be an issue for some people. You can park at the surface street parking where it's available, or park at the mini lot. Otherwise, you can walk, ride a bike or using the transit to go there easier without the hassles.Overall, Iron Horse Tavern is the coolest restaurant/bar site where you can experience the guilty pleasures of a life time in the middle of the Downtown and Midtown neighborhood! Perfect for hanging out with friends, dining with your family, or simply going for a happy hour or brunch including after the Ace of Spades performances too! Highly recommend this new place!"], ["Allison G.", "Came here last Saturday with my family for a nice breakfast before my brother and sister in-law went to the Bay Area. I got the strawberry lemonade which was great and the Green Eggs and Ham, which is scrambled eggs with pesto and a large ham steak. I thought it would be more like sliced ham, but nope. Lol. The food was really good and my family enjoyed their meals as well. I definitely would like to come back for their happy hour soon!!"], ["Christopher S.", "This place has a really good selection of food. The beer is pretty good too and the waiters are always nice about helping me choose my selections. I have been here a couple times already and I've enjoyed each time so far. The only reason I don't give it a full 5 stars is because my bread is always burned when it comes to me or I get really cold fries. Other than that I enjoy it each and every time. It's great place for lunch. I do need to go when the night life is around."], ["Regina N.", "From the prehistoric dinosaur days of Empire, I have always wondered why they never opened anything in this empty lot.

The chunks or ahi were plentiful but the avocado was sparse. \u00a0These would've been good if there were more toppings, extra salt not one of them.Would've tried more food, but I ran out of time. \u00a0My stanky leg was beckoning me to shake it off.--- VERDICT ---Obviously being a fan of Firestone, Park, and all the venues of the monopolizing Sac business gurus, I easily fell for this place. \u00a0The Mac and Cheese alone would get me back, not to mention the dessert behind the bar. \u00a0Mmm Mm.. all that sweetness, and without the calories, if you know what I mean! *wink wink*I definitely see a future here. \u00a0Future frequent happy me at their happy hour, future non-existent memories of me stumbling out incoherent, future excessive eating that an epic battle will occur - Iron Horse, Crouching Toilet Regina, and future hole burned into my wallet. \u00a0Man, thinking about this place makes me hungry right now. \u00a0So hungry I could eat an Iron Horse..

I would definitely recommend them. A great happy hour spot. I will be back :)"], ["Jamie S.", "First time here. Happy hour between 3-6 so we sat at the bar. They have a limited menu until 5pm but with enough options to satisfy. Hubby ordered the flatbread pizza for $7.00. It's the size of a small round pizza and well worth the $$. I ordered a street taco for $2.00 and a spinach salad with tofu. Everything was delicious and tasted freshly made. We ordered dessert - blueberry lemon cake and a berry crostata. After about 15 minutes the bartender apologized and said that they don't usually serve dessert before 5 and the reason for the delay was that they were making it for us fresh. When he said fresh, he meant fresh. Both desserts were hot out of the oven and sooooo tasty. Ian the bartender was friendly and made several drink recommendations for me which were perfect. A big part of the dining out experience for me is the service and Ian didn't disappoint. I can't wait to go back!"], ["Adam D.", "We had a great dinner last night at Red Rabbit. \u00a0Besides the food being delicious and creative, I think the standout performance was the wait staff. \u00a0Our wait staff was perhaps the best I've experienced since a visit to Hook & Ladder last year. \u00a0They handled everything impeccably. \u00a0The beer selection was very good and consisted of Track 7 and Berryessa IPAs on tap. \u00a0There was quite a diverse selection of entrees consisting of foreign words for food that I can not recall off-hand. \u00a0 But there was pork, chicken, pasta, and even, well, rabbit. \u00a0I had the pasta bolognese which had rabbit sausage in it. \u00a0The decor of this restaurant is very nice. \u00a0It is bustling, but not distracting. \u00a0 The bar is ever-present but, it still feels like a restaurant when you are sitting at the tables. \u00a0(I especially like the booths, which is were we sat.) \u00a0The lighting is appropriately dim to make everyone look good. \u00a0 The brick wall is a great background for selfies, or non-selfies. \u00a0 I'm a big fan of this restaurant, and would certainly come back to the bar, as well. \u00a0In some ways, it reminded me of Black Bird. \u00a0So, maybe the secret is to name your restaurant a color and an animal."], ["Alim K.", "Awesome spot!

I got the red rabbit burger and added on an egg and bacon. It was really good. The burger was moist and flavorful. I knocked off three stars because of the experience I had. I didn't finish my food so I boxed it up to go. I left it on the table where I was sitting (on the outside of the booth) we were sitting directly across from the bar and it was very crowded in that area since people were trying to buy drinks. This lady walks pass the group of people and walks too close to my table and knocks over my food. She looked mad that somehow food fell all over her when it was her fault she ran into my food... She looks at me and asked if it was mine and then apologized. A waiter comes by after that lady walks off and looked mad at me that there's food on the floor. He asked what happened and as I tried to explain he just walked off and didn't even care to hear the rest of story.

At first I was a little scared because of the slightly sleezy sounding name, but I am so glad I decided to check this place out. My friends got cocktails, which they liked. I'm more of a shot of whiskey and a beer type of girl, and thankfully they had that exact drink on the menu. Onto the food: between my two friends and I, we ordered the pork belly sliders, the salmon cakes, fries, mussels and clams, shrimp tacos, and the bucatini. We ordered wayyy too much. The shining dish has got to be the pork belly sliders. It was so juicy, flavorful, and gloriously fatty. The kimchi on top gave it a nice crunch and unique flavor. My next favorites were the shrimp tacos and the bucatini. The other dishes were good as well, but I'd say that it is a MUST to get the pork belly sliders for sure. They come in sets of two I believe, so order accordingly so that no one in your party goes burger-less."], ["Monica A.", "Dustin was bartending today and made me a great Manhattan, after I allowed him to pick a bourbon he educated me on it along with the vermouth and bitters that go into a great cocktail.

First off, if you're looking for a spot with a hip younger crowd you won't find it here. To be fair, we dined on a Sunday evening which isn't exactly the best time to eat out, but this definitely seemed more like a family-friendly or comfort-food-for-elderly-patrons kind of place than a modern experience or good place to take a date. And so Lucca's follows a long list of American-Italian establishments.The interior is dated and noisy, and not at all in a charming, rustic kind of way. However, the outdoor patio is nicely appointed and spacious--definitely worth waiting for if you have the choice. Service was friendly, but a little slow for the number of diners present.Our meal started off well enough with a fantastic plate of zucchini chips, a large hot plate of well-prepared mussels, and two creatively inspired and excellent refreshers. Unfortunately things took a turn for the worse after that. I had pan seared salmon, which came on a very uncreative bed of could-have-been-instant mashed potatoes. My wife had a disappointing rendition of cioppino; although the seafood was generic, there was plenty of it, but the sauce had a strange aftertaste and little of the deep flavor you might hope for. Now granted this isn't San Francisco, but you can easily make a tastier cioppino with premade sauce from the supermarket.Despite our disappointing entrees, based on Yelp reviews we decided to stick around for caramelized bananas. Unfortunately, this too left us wanting for... well, something else. The bananas themselves were tasty and the salted caramel was delicious, but the layer of semifreddo beneath didn't really go well with the dish, and instead of being creamy had a texture rather like ice cream that had been left out too long and then refrozen.It's quite possible Lucca's best servers and chefs had Sunday night off, but it will be a long time before we consider eating here again. However, based on the quality of our appetizers and drinks, it could well be worth checking out for happy hour."], ["Cyn T.", "Ambience, service are okay. Had mussels as appetizer and these didn't smell and taste fresh anymore. Was not a good way to start a meal."], ["Spencer R.", "Food is very good and reasonably priced for the quality + portions.

The chicken risotto was good but I could have easily recreated the dish in my kitchen. The service was VERY slow and staff seemed as if they were stretched too thin.

Having the sweet tooth that I have, I also ordered...Double Espresso $3.75*Ch\u00e9vre Cheesecake $6.50ginger snap crust, apple compote, chantilly cream, and toasted pistachiosI enjoyed every bite and and a great experience.

We came here on a Friday night after dinner just to hangout and have a few drinks, it was a perfect place for this. There are plenty of places around time to buy a drink but most of them are noisy and packed with people. Kupros was more on the chill side, we are actually able to sit down and have speak to one another without yelling.

Either there was one too many bros on the front porch, it was a weekend and crazy busy, a game was on and it was super loud, a friend I was with nixed it based on the menu, etc etc. We finally walked by on a Thursday and the coast looked clear so we went in.I wanted to sit upstairs but B said the service would be slower, so we grabbed the last table in the packed bar area. A waitress walked by and said someone will be with us shortly- almost 10 minutes later, nothing. Then a guy started setting up musical equipment in the corner right behind our table. I figured if service is going to be slow anywhere we sit, we may as well be upstairs so at least we can hear each other. So we walked upstairs and sat ourselves on the patio. There was a large group at a table so I assumed *they* must be getting regular staff service... eh. Despite the staff seeing us walk upstairs and sit, it still took about 10 minutes for a waitress to appear with menus, another 10 minutes for water and drink/food orders, and about 20-30 minutes for our food to come out. We ordered the mac & cheese to split, and I got the Grilled Cheeses sandwich. The food tasted fine but was nothing to write home about. B felt the same way about his burger.I wanted to love Kupros but everything just felt a bit off for me. I left feeling like \"Well. That was a meal...\" Fine but not fantastic. I'd probably go again for a quick drink, some of the photos of their cocktails look intriguing."], ["Austin V.", "This is a quaint spot to stop by with a group of friends to have a drink.

Good vibes."], ["Kyle M.", "Went for brunch here with a group of friends and the service wasn't great at all. The waiter was unsure about the items on the menu. The grilled cheese looks like a three year old made it, with a whole tomato sliced in half just made it awkward and unappetizing. The wet burrito was alright, a bit to much sauce and was average tasting. They do have good drink specials like the $12 bottomless mimosas. I won't be coming back anytime soon as they're plenty of better places in Sacramento for brunch."], ["Jim A.", "I wasn't impressed with my meal at Kupros Crafthouse, but probably would bump it up a star if I drank beer, since they had a really nice selection.I came by with a friend on a friday evening and the downstairs was packed. Thankfully they have an upstairs area that was spacious. The frat vibe was a bit overwhelming, but the victorian was very nicely decorated. The hockey finals were on TV. Our server was nice, but absent-minded. He forgot to place our initial order of sweet potato fries. Food took a \u00a0while to arrive as well.I had the meatloaf (online menu was out of date and my preference wasn't available) and he had the BLT sando. The meatloaf was made with deer as well as standard beef and pork, but the flavor was a bit overpowering. I barely ate it because of the flavor, but the green beans were well cooked with a bit of a bite to them. The BLT was burned and overly-dry. For the price I wasn't impressed, but my friend definitely enjoyed his beer and the advice on selection.I'd give Kupros a try for their beer selection, but maybe take a pass on apps or a meal."], ["Molly O.", "Love this place! I live down the street and am a regular at this point. They always have great local beers on tap and decent happy hour prices.

The prices are definitely right.I got the hummus and then an order of fries both on the \"bites\" menu. THEY HAVE HUGE PORTIONS so it's great for sharing and also really cheap.

Second word; beer!The brunch menu is the best I've found in sacramento, bar none. Bottomless mimosas make for heaven. I've tried a few things, the kalua hash is divine and the burrito is too! But a friend (a real hollandaise snob) said the Benny was the best he has had on the west coast. Cut to beer, great selection, and it changes some too which is nice. Happy hour makes it 5$ per pint, and they have a great beer roulette too, like 3$ for a craft beer can at random? Best deal I've found in midtown.

I had no idea that this place even existed... but I'm glad that I know of it now! Kupros offers a unique items for dinner that you may not find on another restaurant's menu with an environment that is truly unique.Since we came as such a large party, we were given the more compacted menu to choose from, which was absolutely fine. Our party actually took up almost the entire upstairs portion of the restaurant - which was awesome. The upstairs has a very nice lounge area with couches and a tv. Cozy would be a great way to describe it. It's almost like you're in an old comfortable (but clean) house, and not a restaurant.Our server was amazing. He was patient and helpful, and went out of his way to make sure we got great service. I don't think I've had such good service in quite a while. Large parties can be difficult to manage and keep on top of, but he did a masterful job.In terms of food, even though we had a limited menu, there were plenty of choices. I went for a simple hamburger as my main dish. It comes with fries or salad. I chose salad because I wanted to order the poutine. If you don't know, poutine is a Canadian staple consisting of gravy and cheese curds over french fries. Sound good? Yep... they were delicious! I don't know of many restaurants that offer this up on their menu, so that was a big plus for me with Kupros.All the food we had (sandwiches, risotto, pastas) were all very good, but perhaps didn't 'pop' with flavor as much as I wanted them to. I think the dishes here could use a kick up in terms of their flavor. But overall the food was very enjoyable.I think I would definitely come back to Kupros and give their full menu a try and see what other items they offer there. Kupros is definitely a little gem in Sacramento worth checking out!"], ["Carimda G.", "I have now been to Kupros twice. The first time was a good experience. The second time not so good.

I will not accept service from that bartender either. I did enjoy the environment and the musicians."], ["Gary G.", "Went to kupros around noon while waiting for a friend to meet me downtown. They carry my favorite Hefeweizen from Germany so I figured I'd kill some time. Walked in and there were two people at the bar.

Unfortunately, it just wasn't. First off, there was too much sauce on the chop. Secondly, mac and cheese doesn't actually taste good covered in barbecue sauce. Let me be clear, the taste on the pork chop would have been good with less barbecue sauce. A little goes a long way especially with a sauce that was sweet like this one was. The mac and cheese was fantastically creamy and had a great flavor to it. It would stand as its own entree. If they plated this differently this meal would have been much better. The pieces of the meal were good on their own but were just weird when combined. I would definitely return for the mac and cheese which you can get as a side dish.

The mini doughtnut holes with sauce on the side were... ok. Not very soft, and the sauce on the side tasted.. storebought. The chocolate wasn't even warm enough to dip in.. It was like a sightly soft hershey's bar.Also got the salmon omelette. It was good, but honestly needed some salt. Ehh, not good enough for the price."], ["Samantha F.", "So eggs benedicts are my favorite. I love trying new brunch places for this item. If the eggs are runny when you cut them, you know they've gotten 60% of the benedict down. The rest depends on the sauce, carb, veggies and meat combination. AMBIANCE: 5stars! Has a twist on the western but modern and classy style. We sat a booth, but there were sets for various numbers of parties, out door seating and natural lighting. The kitchen was also in full view from almost any seating. FOOD: The restaurant uses local and fresh ingredients.This review is for the Smoke Tri-tip benedict and the Roxy breakfast plater. Both eggs were runny! :D This was my first time trying a benedict with tri-tip and the use to corn bread - which a very interesting twist and the sauce had an almost chipotle-like taste. Since their restaurant had an modern+midwestern theme to it, I'm assuming that's their western twist on an eggs benedict. Not my favorite combination, but props are being creative and sticking with the basic. They do have 3 other types of benedict including, your typical bacon, smoked salmon, etc. The Roxy breakfast plater, was your typically scrambled eggs, a choice of meat, a toast, potato patty and really fresh jam. SERVICE: great service!If I'm back in the area, I'll be trying their other benedicts!"], ["George B.", "Slowest service I have ever gotten. Would have walked out, but wife said no. So fricking slow. Food not worth the wait."], ["Mel L.", "It's been a few years since I've been here. I can't believe it's been so long. But today's experience had me very happy I revisited Roxy. Service was great, there was no wait, the free zucchini chips with Yelp check in were delicious (thanks Yelp!), and we didn't have to wait forever for our food, which happens more often than not during brunch. We ordered the pork belly breakfast, vanilla brioche french toast, the Roxy breakfast, and the day's special. I can't remember everything that was in the special, but it included chile verde and jalapeno and cheddar grits. Although I didn't taste much jalapeno in it at all, the grits were yummy. I got the housemade sausage with my Roxy breakfast and I highly recommend it if you're a sausage...well, a meat lover. The potato cakes were slightly crispy mashed potato patties with nice garlic flavor. Great brunch today. The one thing that was the same from last visit was the donuts. I LOVE donuts, and I'm not a fan of their version. The caramel and citrusy dipping sauces were good, but not the donuts. The patio is dog friendly and they have heater lamps for the chilly mornings. I will be back."], ["Mrs. B.", "Husband and I came here for brunch. It's yummy, fancy, and the servers and all the other employees we met were absolutely great!!

Hopefully we can come back for another special breakfast date."], ["Joseph B.", "More to follow but the service or lack of, is why it gets 3 stars. The pork chop was good but not outstanding.

Being out of the Sacramento area I really had no idea where I was booking, location wise. So its more of a strip mall spot, then a city spot. Think like where you would find a Outback Steakhouse-esque. I was surprised when we pulled up, but thats on me.Staff was very responsive to my reserving a time, \u00a0cocktails were amazing, food was very good, and service was moderate. BUT...They brought out a single candle on a white plate for us to sing \"Happy Birthday\" to my friend. The waitress reasoned that it was because no one had ordered dessert. I'm sorry can Roxy's not spare a square of brownie? Our bill totaled about $300. That somehow doesn't equate to single scoop of vanilla ice cream you bought wholesale? No? Great. It was SO SAD looking I took a picture.Everyone looked at each other with various \"WTF\" faces as we serenaded the birthday girl and she blew out her SINGLE WHITE CANDLE ON A EMPTY PLATE. I felt like I was in a Larry David sitcom. So sadly, despite the good food and cocktails this is the only thing I can remember from my experience there."], ["Marcus M.", "You can never go wrong with Roxy! A visit without ordering the bbq butter shrimp just isn't right. I stuck with ordering a burger just like the last time I visited but instead opted for the breakfast burger this time. Mmmmmm.

When dad suggested Roxy, a reluctantly got in my car and went.When we arrived the place was packed, but we were seated almost right away. When I looked at the menu I saw an item I've never seen before: fried chicken & cheddar biscuit. I ended up ordering that. Needless to say, it was very tasty. I would order it again. The crisp on the chicken was awesome and I have alway been a fan of their cheddar biscuit. There is a slice of what I thought to be aged white cheddar that would really give it that pop in you mouth.

Slightly hipster but not. \u00a0I'd expect a hipster type crowd but witnessed a mash of many types (my perception). The architectural styling created curves and interest in the rectangular space. \u00a0The rather modern design offset with more standard furnishings and western/ranch art. \u00a0More of a steak house theme with a semi-modern-hipster vibe. The service was spot on. \u00a0From the greeting at the door, the time at the bar, to our table service, all was pleasant and timely. \u00a0That's what I expect regardless of where I am and doesn't have to be a perfect performance. For the second time in a week, my wife received a perfect extra extra dirty martini. \u00a0Life was good. \u00a0Blue cheese stuffed would have been nice. \u00a0My standby vodka tonic with lime and lemon just as expected. \u00a0Only the best vodka.The food was average; not the shining star. \u00a0The menu here includes lots of meats and a few salads and a couple fish options. \u00a0I wasn't really in the mood for a heavy meat meal so I made my choice accordingly (sort of). We started with the raved about zucchini chips. \u00a0Yep, pretty tasty. \u00a0Also had calamari that included fried onion strings and fennel (and I think some red bell peppers that added some interesting sweetness). \u00a0 The coating on the vegetables was light. \u00a0The calamari, however, was a bit fishy and the coating was not the same as the rest. \u00a0What surprised me most was that the calamari was delivered in less than 5 minutes, before the house' zucchini chips. Hmm. \u00a0Overall, just ok. \u00a0We both opted for salmon. \u00a0She had the pan seared salmon (laying on a bed of lemon mashed potatoes and heirloom cherry tomatoes). \u00a0I had the salmon chop salad (pan seared 'natural' salmon filet, chickpeas, mint, cucumber, and a pomegranate-apple relish atop the salmon filet). \u00a0She enjoyed her dish only noting that the salmon was a bit dry. \u00a0I found my salmon dry as well. \u00a0What was most odd was the level of saltiness in the greens. Thinking maybe my taste was off, she tried, and agreed. \u00a0Really salty salad and overpowered any mint or chickpea flavors.Not sure I'd make trip specifically to come here again. \u00a0There are other American style restaurants around serving the same fare and didn't really present anything very different. \u00a0The atmosphere was great, the service was great, the food was ok."]], "La Bonne Soupe Cafe": [["Samantha F.", "Cute little cafe! The owner is the only worker in the shop so he makes everything himself which I thought was pretty awesome:) FOOD: very unique combinations of sandwiches including vegetarian sandwiches with fruits. $7-$8 for one sandwich which I thought was a bit pricey but nonetheless very tasty :) You can also get a half sandwich for half the price. There were 4 soups specials when we went. Soups are $5. AMBIANCE: Mini cafe with about 2 tables inside and 2 tables outside. Has a very traditional cafe feel and you can see the owner make his sandwiches behind the counter. Bottled and canned drinks are also sold and water is given in a cup for free.Overall, I would come back to try his other soups and sandwiches, but probably not too often since it is a bit pricey for my wallet. Haha"], ["Laura T.", "Simple and tasty small operation. I had a great cup of cream of mushroom soup garnished with truffle oil for $3. \u00a0It was as delicious as it would be in a fancier place. I also had The Classic sandwich with brie and prosciutto. It was served on a crusty french roll with fresh greens, tomato and a drizzle of balsamic reduction; very good. The place is small with just the chef and a counter attendant running the show. This keeps the price low giving the diner a great lunch at an affordable price."], ["Michael R.", "Get there early. It was worth it. Nice guys behind the counter.Anything on the regular menu would have been solid, but the rotating menu- based on what's available in the market and what the chef feels like making- was very intriguing.Reason enough to stop in Sacramento!"], ["Giovanni T.", "Overall the food here is excellent, a must to try out if your downtown. I went based on great yelp reviews and was not disappointed. From the outside and inside, looks a little dirty and old, but the food more than makes up for it. The head chef there prepares the food in front of you and it's ready in minutes. Ask him what he recommends that day, but honestly you can't go wrong. Ate there three times while in town on business, having the combo sandwich, soup, and drink combo for about $11. I had the tri tip beef, pork sausage, and crab melt, all excellent, fresh, SUPER tasty. Then I had the seafood soup twice and French onion soup, both awesome. The seafood soup is loaded with seafood, and is like a bisque. You can taste the homemade love in it in the food. Even the bread is delicious, and great for dropping in your soup. I would eat there again any day. Portions are good and the food is so delicious. The bathroom situation is a little weird since its in the back down a hallway, and it's shared. I like to to wash my hands before I eat and I hate weird, out of the way, dirty looking bathrooms, so sue me.Cute little French tunes playing in the background too lol"], ["Tay O.", "This review is for the customer service only. I stopped by the restaurant at 12:20pm then waited for 20 minutes to hear the chef announcing that there's no bread left. He seemed unconcerned about it and couldn't care less that people had waited for awhile. Arrogant much. If that's how he normally is then I don't care to waste my time and money on this place. Seriously, \u00a0who runs out of bread an hour and a half after opening. \u00a0Especially when his menu is mainly sandwiches. \u00a0I went to cafe rolle instead and their salmon sandwich was delish. \u00a0Too bad Caf\u00e9 Rolle is triple the distance of this cafe.

The cream of mushroom soup and duck confit sandwich with brie was well worth the stop."], ["Janice L.", "I've actually eaten here once before and I just thought the food was okay and overpriced. Which is why I don't think I ever returned and also it's not an area I frequently visit. However, today I decided to give this place another chance as it was really close by the courthouse where I was summoned for jury duty. Its a small restaurant on 8th Street, which can easily be overlooked. I went there early, at 11:30am and there were already several ppl there eating. The staff was very friendly, the chef who prepared the sandwich was very nice and the cashier who rang me up was also very friendly - I was greeted right away and he even opened the door for me to exit ( I ordered to go as sitting inside and outside was quite limited - maybe 4-5 tables inside and 2 small tables outside). Also, there's something about dinning alone seems kind of sad. So I decided to eat at the park alone with the \u00a0homeless. Moving on to the food, I ordered the lunch special - lamb thigh sandwich ( think it has grilled veggies and blue cheese) for $8 and a cup of crawfish bisque $3. I know it's like a million degrees in Sacramento today but I couldn't pass up soup. Both items were amazing! One word: decadent. The bread and meat ratio was perfect - I couldn't stop eating it. The baguette was crispy but not too hard. I love the taste of blue cheese with the lamb. It paired really well. As for the crawfish bisque, I'm not a fan of lobster bisque because I figured it would be similar with the crawfish bisque but it was amazingly creamy and flavorful. I wished I had more at the end. The sandwich appears to be small for $8 but it was actually quite fulfilling with the soup. In fact it was so fulfilling, I actually didn't eat for \u00a0the \u00a0rest of day. I'm pretty sure what I consumed was like a million calories. Which is why I felt obligated to go to the gym that evening. Why is it 4 stars and not 5 you asked? Its because I still think it's overpriced. My lunch came to almost $12 without a drink. \u00a0That's kind of pricey in my book. I can't imagine spending $12 everyday for lunch. Is it overpriced? Yes. Would I recommend this place? Yes. Would I return? Yes. Definitely a place to revisit when I'm in the area."], ["Tinah Y.", "A whole in the wall... which translate to WONDERFUL.

For a place as popular as this is, I'd expect more seating.I wanted to have some of the french onion soup, and had a half order of the Proscuitto and Brie sandwich.

If you never went to La Bonne Soupe when the original chef was there, you missed out. Thankfully, he now has a restaurant in Folsom called Chez Daniel and it's a must-go. My friend and I ordered a meal as close to Chef Pont's offerings as possible...Brie and apple sandwich, mushroom soup, and french onion soup. Here we go....The Brie and apple sandwich was too sweet. It now has fig jam, which overpowers the brie flavor. I barely tasted the brie. It could just need more cheese. There was also a lot of lettuce, pine nuts, and the apples were cut like shoestring french fries vs. apple slices and I couldn't figure out why. There was also balsamic vinegar on it instead of Chef Pont's special garlic sauce. Definitely not as good as the original....and not worth $8.As for the soup, I barely tasted the mushrooms in the cream of mushroom soup. It was mostly cream and I thought I tasted a bit of clam chowder without the clams in it. The french onion needed more actual onions in it, was lacking on cheese, and it was more salty (possibly boxed) broth vs. homemade deliciousness. Both were a no-go at $4 each.I sat inside at a corner table and noticed a hole in the corner of the floor that had been taped over with black tape, but the hole had reemerged. Also, I noticed dust and dirt in the corners of the room (in need of a good cleaning perhaps). There is more seating now since there are more tables outside, but there is no longer a line. I remember having to wait 30-45 min. in line to get in. That's gone. The popularity has clearly dwindled. Overall, the La Bonne Soupe of ol' is gone.

I've been in for happy hour, lunch, and dinner previously. My review is based on tonight's dining experience.Sangria (Red) - Very tart. Actually, too tart for my taste. I dislike super sweet Sangria and don't mind something more on the tart side, but a little sweetness would be welcomed. Our group ordered 2 pitchers to share and everyone discussed similar sentiments.Steamed Mussels - Loved the light sauce, which included baked garlic chunks (soft and not a heavy garlic flavor, not like raw garlic by any means in texture or taste) and chickpeas. Soaked up some of it with bread. Mixed Baby Lettuces - They were out of fig so they substituted persimmons, which are in season right now. Light on the dressing (was there any? appreciated by me) and the almonds, goat cheese, and fennel combination made this dish with the persimmons, which were softer than I had expected (thankfully). Calabrian Chili Papardelle w/ Spicy Sausage Ragu - Delicious! Highlight of my night! It really is a mild spice, if any spice. The noodles are large and fresh and the pork meat sauce is delectable. I had many bites of just the meat and sauce. Could have had more pasta served in the dish, but the sauce was so hearty and delicious it wouldn't make much of a difference to me really if more were added. Ambiance - I like the dim lighting and refurbished industrial feel. Pricing is okay. Appetizers are about $5-$18, salads $8-$14, pizzas/pastas/entrees $14-$28. A handful of desserts are also offered (but we didn't order any).Service was good; nothing really stood out for better or worse.Overall good experience tonight.

The inside is very rustic chic also - but it was too cold in there and it was great weather out, so we sat on their patio. A lot of the items on the menu looked great. Unfortunately they were out of their sausage ragu for their pappardelle dish (always see it on MasterChef, never tried it), so I went with their smoked mozzarella ravioli with Jimmy Nardello pepper pesto and a tasty corn relish. I paired my meal with a \"strawberry shrub,\" which he described as a strawberry vinegar soda. I didn't quite taste vinegar until my boyfriend pointed it out after trying it, so don't let the vinegar stop you from ordering it! It's basically a light strawberry soda - very refreshing! Everything was tasty, even the cheese and bread plate (yum, figs!). The spinach pesto pizza was also good, but I'm not a fan of blue cheese so I'll have to pass on that next time.

We were super sad, but decided to try the fish tacos instead. The fish tacos were almost as delicious!! But still bring back the shrimp tacos!! I really like the breading on the shrimp and fish - not too fried or thick. The sauce on the tacos was a chipotle style with a spicy kick, but not too hot to handle.

Drinks, appetizers, entrees and no dessert. So full!I don't know what everyone is talking about, we really like it here.

The hostess kindly gave us a wonderful booth on the end with half chairs, half bench seating. We started off with drinks, there's literally something for everyone here. Wine, fancy drinks, beer, non-alcoholic bevies. We had a Rainer in a can, a Track 7 on tap and a Moscow Mule for me.

Lots of mumbling back and forth about \"should we order some of this?\" but in the end, we held out for our entrees. Our table was suddenly full of beautiful salads, pasta dishes and a pizza. The pizza was the special with bacon, onion, arugula, goat cheese and pistachios. It was delicious! I felt there was a little bit too much crust, which would have been fine if I had some olive oil to dip it in, but it was perfectly cooked and delicious, so that's a me thing. The pastas and salads were here and then gone, everything was so amazing and fresh. The ragu pasta was a huge hit, and the red sauce was delicious - a hint of spice but also a bit creamy, really, really good. Our service was spot on the entire evening. Our dishes went right to the person who ordered them, no plate auctioning going on. Side note: I hate that. Plate auctioning is the art of \"who had the spaghetti? Spaghetti? Spaghetti anyone? Sir? SIR? EXCUSE ME, SIR?\" It interrupts the flow of conversation with company. It's not difficult to learn seat numbers and drop orders where they belong.

I could not stop drinking his cocktail. It was everything a coffee lover could desire. The atmosphere is industrial but chic.

This would also be a great place for a larger group."], ["Horst S.", "Attended an office Christmas party here, and overall, I was pretty impressed. The bar is definitely good for starters. I enjoyed my Moscow Mule for sure.The sausage appetizer was nice, with the chorizo being the standout. The mixed pickles were great, using some unusual vegetables such as broccolini. Very good and not overly sour. The sprouts and fries were also good, with everything being nice and crispy and properly salted. The brussels sprout Caesar on the other hand was just OK, and it highlights the current overuse of this vegetable. A traditional salad with Romaine would have been preferable, but the dressing was a bit too thick and flavor-challenged for me. The anchovy fillets would have been better used in the dressing I think, and the croutons were chewy.The green curry lamb shank was outstanding. It was falling apart tender, and the curry flavor was subtle enough not to mask the flavor of the lamb. The roasted vegetables were nicely cooked and flavorful.The ribeye special was amazing. The beef was perfectly cooked and super-tender, with a nice crust. I heard many positive comments from my fellow diners about their day boat scallops and the bacon-wrapped filet of pork.The service was friendly and efficient, and the food was a solid 4 stars overall. The salad was the only minor disappointment. Otherwise it's very much a repeatable place. I hope if we go back that there won't be any more parents not parenting.

She suggested Hook & Ladder, which I've been dying to try for the longest time (bookmarked and everything!)We arrived between 4-4:30pm, which was perfect because Happy Hour was being served till 6pm. Parking wasn't an issue. From the outside, you can tell this establishment is very charming, with the large light up letters spelling out their name. Walking in, it had a very whimsical, but masculine feel to it, with all the wood and industrial furniture. The place didn't have many people dining in at the moment, which was great for us because we were able to be seated right away.We were greeted by Treka, who was TOTES AMAZE! It being most of our first time, we were throwing so many questions at her. Treka answered them flawlessly, giving us the confidence she knows what she's talking about and the trust we will have a great experience. To top it off, one of my girls were waiting for her husband and ordered him the Hook & Ladder burger. He was running late, but the food came out and Treka offered to leave his food under the heat lamp so that his food wouldn't be cold when he arrived! It was unexpected but that's what you call exceptional service.From Happy Hour, I ordered the cocktail...Moscow Mule $6 (HH)...served in a copper mug! It was so yummy, I ordered two.

The food is good if you want something kind of elaborate for breakfast that you can't find somewhere else (crab hash, croque madam, etc.), but their basic breakfast (two eggs, potatoes, meat, and toast) isn't actually that great, and definitely isn't worth the $9 they charge for it. It arrived kind of cold and everything was way under-seasoned. I expected more. The first time I came here, we were pretty much the only customers. I guess that is the only way to get good service here. When we came for breakfast this last weekend, the restaurant was about 1/4 full, but the service was slow the entire time. Just one example, it took our waitress more than five minutes to bring us salt and pepper shakers after she'd brought the food. So we sat there watching our food getting cold and wondering where she was. She came out again to refill the next table's waters before returning again to bring the shakers. Just...no. And why the hell weren't there salt and pepper shakers on the table to begin with? They do know they serve food, right?Also, this place is apparently baby and toddler central on Saturday mornings. Hope you like screaming with your $5 mimosas! I will probably come back at some point when I am randomly craving crab hash, but I'm in no hurry.

I even held a party the morning after my wedding there and they were very accommodating.They've got the best French onion soup in town! Definitely a must! I've gotten their escargot a few times as well but they were really bland yesterday. A little salt & pepper doesn't hurt. Overall, my favorite place for crepes in Sac!"], ["Julie K.", "Pulling up to park, this place appears to be a cute, cozy diner setting. \u00a0There's an outdoor seating area in plain view. You enter the main entrance into the building, once you're greeted by a fountain, the door into the restaurant is to your right. \u00a0As we opened the door into the establishment, a slight urine odor smacked us the the face. I initially thought this was in the \"hallway\" area of the building, outside of the doors where the fountain was.. But as I sat down, it was confirmed that what reeked of urine was within the restaurant.We stood waiting by the counter near the door, looking awkwardly at the workers, wondering if we should grab a menu or if we were to order at the counter & grab a seat as how other creperies operate. Finally, after a few minutes, a server relieved us of the awkwardness & seated us.While we were waiting for someone to take our order, we admired the various pieces of artwork for sale that were places throughout the restaurant. We ordered 3 cr\u00eapes, French onion soup, & orange juice. The \"large\" orange juice was a disappointing size for the $3 you pay. The cup of water seemed to be larger than the glass of OJ. \u00a0I was hoping it would be bottomless, but there were no offers to refill either the water nor the OJ. The French onion soup was OK--seeing as to how this as my 1st time trying it, I have nothing else to compare it to. I'd definitely save my money & pass on these items next time around.The cr\u00eape variety I ordered seemed fantastic compared to the other cr\u00eaperies I've tried. I don't think I've been to a place that offered anything similar to the beef bourganiese nor \u00a0the karma cr\u00eape. I don't care for cheese & would prefer not to have something super cheesy. I liked how these cr\u00eapes had a perfect balance of flavor & the meat was moist. The filling was not too salty, nor cheesy. I was taken aback with how the cr\u00eape exteriors weren't crispy, but then I realized it wouldn't be possible for it to stay crispy too long due to the sauciness of the contents. The portion sizes for the savory cr\u00eapes were good. They looked small initially, but they were quite filling. We had a good amount of left-overs to take home.The dessert cr\u00eape only came with an option of ice cream or whipped cream--not both. It was nothing spectacular, seemed smaller & overpriced compared to the savory cr\u00eapes.Service was slow. They emitted the aura of \"I don't give a crap,\" \"when will this (influx of customers) end?!\" & their expressions showed it. Bottom line: don't be in a rush to get somewhere or something when here. The stench of urine didn't help out dining experience either. As soon as the cr\u00eapes came out, the odor was nicely masked by the smell of food. \u00a0I do like how their cr\u00eape fillings are different from the other cr\u00eaperies, so if I return, it would definitely be takeout. ..until then, Danielle!"], ["Michelle L.", "Had been here a few times in the past, also to its neighbor restaurant Cafe Vinoteca. Returned again recently since an out-of-town visitor was specifically craving crepes after church. Crepeville would also have been another option, but this was relatively closer of a drive. Parking was scarce, but managed to find a few open ones. Party of five, seated right away despite the elderly Sunday brunch crowd. We each ordered some kind of crepe, I had the breakfast crepe with mushrooms and ham. Didn't come with any side dish, such as fruit or potatoes, but tummy, don't fret! Didn't take much coaxing. I also \"helped\" polish off one of the spinach and crab special crepes (super rich, I can see how it was hard to finish an entire one), as well as part of a shared Belgian waffle (gotta end on a sweet note).

Their spinach and crab crepe wasn't bad, I expected it to be heavy which at first it wasn't, until I was like about 75% done it felt pretty heavy. Definitely wanted a salad, something fresh at least.

The menu has so many choices. After asking the waitress what she would recommend we decided to split the Daily Brunch Special (as she suggested) ~ savory cr\u00eape, bowl of fruit, croissant with jam, coffee and a sweet cr\u00eape. Instead of the croissant, we ordered a toasted baguette.The coffee was really good. We enjoyed the savory cr\u00eape along with the fruit bowl.

We were greeted right away and had a little bit of a wait for Sunday brunch (arrived around 11:30 a.m.) but not long.Although known for their crepes, both main and dessert, none of us ordered one. Go figure. However, once we saw the size of the ones being delivered to other diners around us, we were kind of glad we didn't! The ones we saw were not your standard rolled crepe that you're probably picturing in your head right now, but more of a 'pocket' crepe - about 4\" square. Huge! And not all swimming in a sauce.The California Eggs Benedict with bacon & avocado we ordered were beautifully presented and very good. They were not served on an English muffin, but on a sliced baguette. To be expected from a place with French roots. There wasn't a thing left on the plate when done!! A testament to its deliciousness. The Belgian waffle with berries & whipped cream is the go-to dish for our family member. She was unable to finish the entire waffle (it was the size of the plate), but made a valiant effort, making sure the fresh strawberries and raspberries & whip were all gone. The spinach salad came with roasted pine nuts and Gorgonzola cheese and the standard hard boiled egg & bacon bits. The dressing was very flavorful and there wasn't a leaf left.We had great service.

We came in on a Monday morning and were pretty much the first ones in the restaurant. It has a classy diner type of feel. While it has the usual booths and tables, the decoration and subtleties of the surroundings convey French influence. Our server was so professional and very helpful with the menu. There are lots of items to choose from, though the crepes are the only specialty gf items. I went with something I haven't had since I became gf. My banana Nutella crepe was amazing.. So incredibly indulgent. I also ordered a side.. And then another side.. Of bacon. And anyone that's read my breakfast reviews may have noted I'm a bit of a bacon snob.

I love everything about this sandwich... the baguette was crispy on the outside and super soft on the inside, the bacon was crispy just the way I like it and the turkey was moist (usually the chicken is moist too). The potato salad was good but not anything special.The chocolate raspberry crepe was delicious. They do not skimp on the raspberries. My husband even made a comment about how many raspberries they put in the crepe when raspberries are not cheap. But we're not complaining. I appreciate that they gave my husband and I each a half of the sandwich and our own serving of potato salad on separate plates.

Looking over the menu, the decent-sized list of vegetarian crepes surprised me. Score! I always get excited when I have actual choices! There were plenty of meaty options too and this was also apparent in their sandwich and panini selection. All crepes come with swiss cheese unless specified otherwise and you have a choice between wheat, flour, spinach or spicy cornmeal crepe batter. If you're in a breakfasty mood, they serve thir breakfast crepes and other meals all day! I settled on the ratatouille crepe with the spinach crepe batter. It came loaded with bell pepper, eggplant, squash, zucchini, onion and tomato sauce with the perfect amount of cheese. I could detect a mild spinach flavor from the crepe which went well with the veggies and herbed sauce. It was a good sized meal but had I been starving, I would have wanted something on the side.My fiance created his own crepe from the breakfast section which was turkey, bacon and cheese with a side of potatos. He said it tasted good but was a little disappointed that it wasn't hotter. It was luke warm in comparison to mine which made us believe that the meats weren't freshly cooked. The potatos were a hit though and apparently seasoned to perfection as he devoured them first, letting his crepe get even colder.With room in our tummies still, we ended up ordering a few desserts; caramel custard that was light and sweet with a mild taste of caramelized sugar that's similar to what you taste on creme brulee, tres leches cake that was amazingly moist like a pudding and drizzled with a generous amount of caramel and loaded with strawberries, and a banana-filled crepe with toasted almonds, a scoop of vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and a drizzle of delicous chocolate. We agreed that dessert was the highlight of our meal with the tres leches being the absolute favorite. I'd go back JUST for that. Overall, we were pleased.

I'm not a HUGE fan of Swiss cheese so I thought it was a bit too cheesy but the cheese flavor didn't overwhelm the rest of the crepe. The chutney and cashews were a GREAT topping but they only give you a little bit. I asked for more chutney and it made the crepe a perfect mix of Indian spice and peach chutney sweet. I also had coffee and it was pretty delicious, too! It was dark and toasty. I thought the customer service was very \"French\". The servers weren't jumping around with grins on their faces, but they were attentive and checked in on us promptly. I never ran out of coffee.

I literally had to get up, go to the counter and ask for someone to get my order!!! Seriously? That should NEVER happen. We really should have left. We ordered a Beef Bourguignon Crape and the Nutella, Banana and Almond crape. The beef crape was served on a small plate with a few slivers of carrot and some shavings of parsley. It looked odd and incomplete. The crape itself was a little under done which is really unfortunate considering its a crape restaurant. The filling was ok, a typical beef stew. Nothing special though. It had chunks of beef and a lot of carrots. I wasn't a fan, especially with the taste of under cooked dough in my mouth. The desert crape was BAD. I've tried crapes like this before and this was the worst I've had. No flavor, drenched in way too much chocolate! Every bite tasted like chocolate sauce and you couldn't taste the crape.

In response, we gave him \"thumbs' up.\" Also, we decided to go for their unlimited Mimosas. By now you probably want to know whether or not we were satisfied with our food....the answer is YES. Our croissants were very flakey, fresh, and made a perfect pairing with the eggs and hot link sausages. Even more amazing were the seasoned home-style potatoes. I've been places where \"seasoned\" meant pouring a large amount of salt over a delicacy of your choice. However, these were lightly seasoned (less is more) and thoroughly cooked (not burned). The Mimosas had a distinct, tropical-like flavor.

If you like your meat a little more \"done\" I would definitely make that a little more clear. The decor was cool. Definitely have it the \"English\" feel. It definitely made me miss London."], ["Matt M.", "Went for brunch yesterday with my wife and another couple. It was super busy due to the Breast Cancer whatever going on towards the capital. Long story short, my wife didn't like the french toast, and didn't like the Full English breakfast. Both our complaints are that it was extremely bland. I've had better English Breakfasts in England, and for $9.75 I was definitely not happy. It was my only experience here and I don't think I'll be sojourning for food any time soon unless all my friends want to go and meet up.

Otherwise, I'd never have stepped in the door.THE SETUPIf a friend coerces me for a stop here to have an ale or a cider, I still find this place to be pretty solid. \u00a0LE MENU - THE POSITIVEThe food & beverages:* \u00a0Quiche & Salad was enjoyed both by the birthday girl & another reveler and they both liked it:yelp.com/biz_photos/fox-\u2026* I had the King's Cross Burger with Chips (sliced fried potatoes) and it was dam tasty:yelp.com/biz_photos/fox-\u2026* A.T. had the classic Fish & Chips combo & seemed to really enjoy it:yelp.com/biz_photos/fox-\u2026* Can't go wrong with a bottle of hard cider* And the reason why this review is a 3-star instead of a 2-star is because of the nice touch of giving the birthday girl a complimentary Cr\u00e8me Bruleyelp.com/biz_photos/fox-\u2026THE NEGATIVEHowever, Fox & Goose becomes problematic with groups of 8 or more - such as a work-meeting, or in this instant, a birthday celebration by a dear friend. \u00a0And, unfortunately, as is typically the case in these scenarios, you think policy is explained clearly at the beginning, but then management changes it up on you when it's too late to back out.*CHARTWELL ROOM - SEPARATE SPACE RENTALFox & Goose has a new room now in the back & it's pretty snazzy. Nice WWII-era pictures of Churchill & RAF Pilots, and quotes on walls - gives it a powerful nostalgic vibe of an important era gone by. But apparently it costs $250 to rent this room. Just to RENT it. \u00a0[And I'm not sure the size justifies such a rich surcharge.]Nor do meal & drink costs count towards the total amount of rent as most places allow as a deferral-metric from a minimal threshold charge: in other words, say your group tallied a total of $170 in food & drink, then we'd still have to pony up another $80 to meet the $250 minimum.But not in this case. Nope. \u00a0Room rental is separate in this common pub space, and on a fairly quiet Wed eve, I think that borders on gouging. And from the demographic density on this particular evening in fact, it appears the room would have been empty in any event. So it seems very consumer-unfriendly given that many restaurants - Mikunis, River City Brewery, even Morton's - have separate seating, more private room areas that don't charge.Fine. \u00a0Moving on...\"THE CHECK\" But now they want to tell us we can't split the check. \u00a0And not only that, but they won't let us pay our portions with credit cards. \u00a0But it seems odd to me in this day & age where the common practice IS to allow splitting of checks - and not force customers to pay cash - I find this Fox & Goose check-policy to be very customer service UNfriendly.PREVIOUS SALSA DEBACLEWhich just continues to confirm my foundational reasons why me and my circle of friends & coworkers don't patronize Fox & Goose as our first choice (or even our 2nd or 3rd choice of venues) as a regular spot for group activities. \u00a0Along those lines, see my previous review for Fox & Goose (10/06/2010) when they wanted to charge my boss for the healthier salsa-option she requested to put on her omelet instead of the more SUGAR-rich ketchup.So there you have my latest entry in my random, ad hoc experiences here at Fox & Goose.OUR STAFF INTERACTIONS FOR THE EVENINGDelightful server! \u00a0The main saving grace of this rented-room party environment is that the young lady providng the service to our entire group was friendly, positive, helpful and intuitive. \u00a0We couldn't have asked for a better server.However, the Manager to whom all the fiscal questions had to be addressed to personally - since the server was not allowed - was much more of a stick-in-the-mud. \u00a0It seemed no matter what we tried to work out in terms of payment, all we got back was his broken record of \"no splitting, and cash only.\" \u00a0The result? \u00a0Fox & Goose required members of our party to go out of their way - outside - to go find ATM machines aways from the restaurant and to bring back cash instead of letting them use their credit cards. \u00a0How's that for customer service friendliness? :/So again, I won't be planning any work events or social gatherings here at Fox & Goose.THE LOWDOWNDefinitely needs some more work on the customer service delivery metrics in handling group events, ESPECIALLY at the management team le"], ["Joy M.", "My visit to the F&G only took 29 minutes...some of those quite off putting.A young lady led me to a two top in a corner. \u00a0Both chairs faced a wall. \u00a0Almost every other table was empty at the time so it was a little puzzling why that was deemed the best place to seat me. \u00a0I asked for a different table and she sat me where I was able to enjoy the decor and ambiance.She asked for my drink order and I asked for some water while I looked at the beer list. \u00a0When she brought the water she told me that if I got my order placed within 10 minutes I could have some food. \u00a0 ?????? \u00a0The kitchen closes at 2:00. \u00a0When I started to place an order she told me I had to give it to my server and she wasn't it. \u00a0Barely a moment later Carlo arrived and took my order. \u00a0 There was no time to peruse the menu. \u00a0I had a Smithwicks and the Salmon Dill sandwich. \u00a0Both came out so quick and the sandwich was good. \u00a0Not awesome, but good. \u00a0I'd have it again but not DREAM of having it again. \u00a0KWIM? \u00a0Carlo S noticed my water glass was empty and was very quick to refill it.I hadn't quite finished my (rashly chosen) meal when a funny thing happened- two women were seated near me and their server was right there to take their (food) order. \u00a0 That was around 2:10 or 2:15. \u00a0Had I known the kitchen was only closed for 10 or 15 minutes I would have ordered a small salad to tide me over and taken time to read the menu.Not saying I won't ever, not ever ever ever go back again.

We all kinda looked at each other n were like... Oook? Guess we're not ordering.They came back a few minutes later to help clear out some dishes, and to rudely reposition the check so it's more centered on the table. Ahhh, yes. I was a server once too.

It's also a really big portion & you definitely will need help eating it. Ahi poke tostada $8 - this was a good appetizer. I usually don't like raw items but this was worth the try. It's poke (raw marinated fish), mango, & avocados placed on a wonton chip. Banh mi pizza $6 - this must be a new flavor of pizza because it wasn't on the menu the last time I was here. So when my BF & I saw this, we had to try it because we love banh mi sandwiches! And let me tell you - we were so glad we ordered this. It was very flavorful and it had the banh mi taste to it. It's topped with marinated pork, pickled carrots, scallions, pickled chili, BBQ sauce, & Kim chee aoli. Very yummy and can be spicy!

It's a wannabe version of the BJ's avocado eggrolls which are 10/10. I took a bite as soon as they came out and the eggroll wrap was soggy.. mixed with the creamy avocado inside - was not a good combo. Its supposed to be an EGGROLL.. crispy outside!! Next, we had pulled pork nachos.. AMAZING!! and they give such a BIG portion for only $6! The meat was really tender and they do load up the toppings for the amount of chips they give you. Toppings include: tender pulled pork, creamy nacho cheese sauce, creamy sour cream sauce, pickled jalapenos, tomatoes, red onions, cilantro, and a mound of guac on top! DROOLLLThe pizzas were all 1/2 off the original price so we ordered 2.. the wild mushroom and the garlic chicken.

I would prefer more powdered sugar but it was a simple and delicious dish. the potatoes were fantastic though! there were bell peppers and onions to pair them and normally I don't like bell peppers but the potatoes weren't overpowering. it was kind of like they were infused with the bell pepper. lol, I had a few bites of my boyfriend's sandwich and it was sweet and spicy. the French toast added the sweet factor and the hollidase that was poured over had a little kick to it. defitently a fulfilling meal. the service was a bit confusing. we had a designated server who took or order but we never saw her after that.

The restaurant did call the day before to verify our reservation, so that was nice. Luckily, we were able to find street parking just down the street. When we arrived we were seated within 5 minutes. The restaurant was very lively and several tvs were playing basketball and hockey. We ordered off the special Valentine's Day menu, so I can't say much about their regular food, but I will be back to try that giant pretzel!The table had a small vase with flowers, so that was cute. We ordered our food and got the appetizer within 5 minutes. Our entree came out 10 minutes later. We were finished and ready to go 30 total minutes later. Wow! Everything came out so quick, especially considering it was a holiday! I was impressed. Now onto the food...Frito misto: deep fried calamari, zucchini, fennel, and lemon with sriracha mayonnaise. Yum! The batter was not too heavy or greasy and it was perfectly seasoned. My boyfriend isn't a huge calamari person, but he loved it. The dish only came with the rings, not the tentacles. I was hesitant to try the lemon, but it was so thinly sliced that it was actually refreshing. I only wish there was more zucchini. Pan seared corvina sea bass: tender white fish served over mashed potatoes with Swiss chard, topped with bacon-onion jam and pomegranate reduction. This was so good! The mashed potatoes were creamy and the the bacon onion jam provided just the right amount of smokiness and sweetness. I thought I didn't like Swiss chard, but it turns out I do if it's prepared like this! It was soft, so it tasted similar to cooked spinach. The reduction had a balsamic taste to it and was delicious. The fish skin could have been a little crispier, but I didn't eat it so I didn't mind too much.Smoked prime rib: my boyfriend enjoyed this. The cut was a little thinner than expected, but the meat was very tender and you could distinctly taste the smoked flavor. The au jus had nice flavor. He requested no horse radish. It came with mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables that were fork tender. The dessert option was espresso flavored, which didn't sound too appealing to us, so we went elsewhere, but I was very impressed with our meal! Our water and soda was refilled often and the waiter was pretty friendly. I thought it was weird that he gave me a steak knife to eat fish, but better to be prepared, I guess haha.

Why? For the sports fanatics, there are seemingly as many screens as people, and not just any screens. We're talking massive, top-notch flat screens easily viewable from any location in the restaurant. It's a paradise for anyone who likes to catch a game while out with the masses. The food is also on point. Their pretzel, which comes warm and waiting on some sort of special pretzel hanger with bier cheese and a sweet mustard, would have any of the mall store pretzel chains crying in shame. The chicken BLT, chicken wings and pork nachos are also menu highlights, although I wish they used more real cheese for the latter. Up to this point you may be wondering why I've only granted them four stars. That's because they are always, always packed to the rafters and there is always, always a wait. It actually has become a deterrent for me returning because I know I'll be standing outside with a buzzer for 20 minutes waiting for a booth.

They have a lot of good beers and a great menu of brunch, lunch, and dinner items as well as appetizers. Their service is great and we were taken care of the entire time we were there. The mimosas kept coming and that was great. The servers never let you see the bottom of your glass before refilling it. We ordered boneless wings, chicken apple scramble and pulled pork eggs benedict. The eggs benedict was great with a generous portion of pulled pork. The hollandaise sauce over the eggs was excellent. The breakfast potato served with the brunch items were very good too! The chicken apple scramble was ok. The eggs and sausage were a little dry and the toasted bread was too hard. The breakfast potato and excellent service made up for that. Boneless wings were ok too nothing special. Tasted just like boneless wings ive had elsewhere.

Luckily there was a bar back who seemed to care about customers and he comes and gives me a menu and beer list. I comment to him about his ability to actually see me and I ask him if he could let the bartender know I'd like a drink.The \"nose studded bartender\" finally takes my drink order and I tell her I will be having dinner she tells me I have to start a tab and requires my credit card. Then the wait really begins. I get my beer and wait for 10 minutes before she came and took my order, she was unhelpful with the order and seemed like she could barely care about taking my order.I ordered a dinner salad and their ribeye steak.I have to mention I want the salad before my meal. The salad comes but even though it looked well dressed it was bland even with heavy pepper and added salt (which I rarely ever have to do to a salad)My salad and meal wasn't brought to me by the bartender thankfully or may have never seen them.The guy who brings the meals was fast and courteous along with the bar back.I was able to eat my steak without a single inquiry as to how it was cooked or tasted. The cook was fine the taste was not so good, it too was needing seasoning and I wished I hadn't turned down the steak sauce as it would have improved it.Once done I had to wait another 15 minutes before I had to request to pay my tab as I still hadn't been checked on.A small pilsner, salad, and ribeye was $32.00 rounded up buy 13 cents which was my tip.Now I usually tip well into 40% because the job of food service isn't easy but there was no way I was going to even tip 15% with service so bad and demeaning.

We asked about getting a little more champagne and were told they are premixed. The service was excellent, so that brings the over all experience to 3 stars. I had the eggs benedict, which is not your traditional benedict. It was just ok. The pulled pork was very fatty and only one of the eggs was poached properly. Other meals represented in our group were the open-faced breakfast sanwich, the club sandwich, and the veggie omlet. Nobody was wowed, everyone thought the food was just ok. With the 4 entrees, 3 bottomless 'mimosas' and 2 beers, the total check (before tip) was just under $100. The orange juice pretending to be mimosas and average food was probably the reason the place was virtually empty at 10:30 on Sunday morning, but again, the service was top notch.

We were so happy to find out about this place. We had heard of the one out in the Arden-Arcade-Carmichael netherlands, so a Midtown location got us super excited. Our friend from Boston was in town and we wanted to show her how cool and hip Sacramento is (it actually is, IMO). So, we headed over to Plan B, pulled back the curtain and walked in. Only the owner, a wannabe bartender and one table of customers were inside. We waited for awhile to order drinks. Finally, when Mr. Bartender arrived, he told us that they had no cocktail menu and didn't know how to make most drinks. We ended up ordering regular martinis, as that seemed to be the only thing he knew how to make. \"Seemed\" is the key word. \u00a0Then the \"owner\" came over and asked us if we were ready to order drinks. We told him that we already had and he began to tell us about how great his restaurant is and how he is showing Sacramentans what real French food looks like. We asked him where the name Plan B came from and his answer was peppered with pomposity and incomprehensibility. He would continue to stop by unannounced throughout the night and educate us on the Frenchness of his food. Meanwhile, the extra tiny mussels came out cold and shriveled. This is one of their specialities and the item that takes up the most space on the menu. Shouldn't it be done right?I can't even remember what else we ate, it was all so mediocre. \u00a0We left feeling embarrassed that we had taken our friend there."], ["Summer M.", "We were headed to \"restaurant A\" a few Friday nights ago but when we rolled past and saw it was packed, we opted for nearby Cafe Plan B which I've been meaning to try for months. (Yes, Plan B was literally our plan B.) It's a small-ish restaurant that has an lovely and lightly upscale feel: dim lights, black and neutral decor, personable and attractive waitstaff, the ambivalent electronic music playing overhead that's dancey enough to put you in a good mood but not club-y enough to turn off more serious customers (what I refer to as the \"Victoria's Secret store soundtrack\", haha). The night we were there, the inside was trimmed with all red holiday decorations and they were in the process of stringing up red lights outside.The restaurant was maybe 1/3 full so wait service was prompt. We ordered glasses of the house red while we shared the delicious tartiflette appetizer with cheese bacon and creme fraiche. I got the gnocchi which was absolutely to die for- just as the manager(?) described them, they were like clouds of dough that melted on your tongue. B enjoyed his poulet frites (roasted chicken with french fries) and I loved the few frites I stole off his plate. Dessert was creme brulee and raspberry cheesecake, both exquisite.Pros:-Attractive modern venue with intimate ambiance- perfect for a romantic night out for 2-Friendly service-Amazing foodCons:-It's rather spendy. I realize it's a nice restaurant, but the cost is high for the portions served.-Remember when I mentioned they were putting up holiday lights outside? Our whole dining experience was peppered with the noise of tools being used to hang said lights. Guys, it can wait until you close. For real.

My salmon was SLIGHTLY under seasoned, but other than that, it truly was very good. It has a great grill to it. The tart we got to start was also very tasty. Ambiance is also great. Bad:Felt a bit \"nickel and dimed.\" Small roll of bread for the table? Pay for it. Want a refill on your fountain soda? Pay for it. And my quite good though slightly under seasoned salmon was about 6 inches long, less than two fingers thick, and ran a little under $20. Only sides that came with it were half a dozen saut\u00e9ed veggies. Portion size really needs to be rethought.All said and done, for a shared appetiser, one bowl of mussels, one entree, one thing of bread, a glass of wine, and one diet coke (with refill), I walked out the door paying $70 after tax and tip. I think $55-60 would have been a more fair price-point for quality and quantity of food.Don't get me wrong, it was good - we are talking 4 star review here - but the price isn't where it needs to be to compete with a number of great restaurants in this weight-class in Sacramento."], ["Smelly C.", "Located on 20th Street next to Jack's Urban Eats.Inconspicuous black building.

The first time was with friends and we had a great time.

Second time I went was for Valentine's Day. My boyfriend surprised me by taking me there, because he wanted to try it and he heard me talk so much about it the first time I went. This time was a little different than the first time. I feel whoever was in charge of reservations and the front of the house... Did NOT know what they were doing. First of all, they split the bigger tables (which are just booths) with a little rose walls (which was just long stem red roses stuck in a Styrofoam flower beds) in the middle, so they could sit 2 couples at the same table. We sat at one of these tables.... It was extremely awkward because even though I can't see what they are eating on the table, I can still tell I'm sitting on the same bench with a complete stranger and our purses and jackets are touching. I felt that was extremely tacky. I get it though, you can get more reservations in right? Terrible idea because there was soooo many reservations that there was a crowd of people waiting outside (some I heard were half an hour to an hour over the reservation time and still waiting to be seated). So, to me, it seemed someone either overbooked or under planned their front of the house staffing. The checking in for our reservation was a nightmare as well. My boyfriend had to try to squeeze in to the tiny cafe to get to the hostess to let her know we were there. Which, I thought to myself they should have benches on the outside of the cafe and had a hostess out there since they really don't have a waiting area on the inside. We placed ourselves in their way, by being at the bar until they seated us. The hostess kept calling my boyfriend by some other man's reservation name (My boyfriend is a Quarter Mexican with the last name Lopez, but looks like just another white man, so I think she was struggling linking the last name Lopez to his face). Which isn't too big of a deal but she did it 3 times. Good rule of thumb, if you're not sure about the name.. Don't guess... Ask. It comes off rude and offensive when you keep calling us by the wrong reservation name. I feel the Kitchen Staff was great! I could tell if the front of the house had it together, I would've enjoyed the food better, but every dish came out cold (the salad and dessert were great but they are supposed to be cold). The front of the house staff looked stressed and undermanned. They look like a bunch of chickens with their heads cut off. It took 2 and a half hours to get all of our dishes ( 4 course meal). But others, I could see, took longer. I wouldn't mind if it was 2 and half hours of us just enjoying the food and each others company, but the majority of the time was us waiting to be served the next dish. I feel 3 stars is fair, because that was one night and the first time I went I had a great time. Hopefully for next Valentine's Day they learn from their mistakes and take less reservations and more front of house staff."], ["Aldoux C.", "Simply a great atmosphere for nice food.

Our appetizers came out fast and they were AMAZING! The Antipasto plate and the oysters are absolutely top-notch. It did take a while for our actual entrees to come - we were seated at 8:30 and didn't get our entrees on the table until about 9:40ish. The restaurant was packed, it was a Saturday night after all, and we were a good-sized group, so maybe it was just the circumstances of our visit. They did, however, let us bring in our own bottles of wine, split our bill up as we asked, and the quality of the food was soooo worth it for the wait.The Waterboy is a very classy, romantic location in the middle of downtown that's in walking distance of several other bars and other entertainment places.

The foie gras was good but I really LOVED the bruschetta. \u00a0The bruschetta had smashed white beans, crisp pork belly, arugula, parmesan and chimichurri on top. \u00a0Mind blown! Not bad for $12.00 either! For the main course, I had the lamb. \u00a0The lamb was delicious and fresh, not too much fat.

We've passed by it a million times but finally went for my boyfriend's birthday with family. They take reservations through OpenTable so take advantage of that - there's limited seating.The ambiance inside is nice and bright, the whole place is open with the large floor to ceiling windows, and the cutesy decor like the squirrel figurine sitting on the bar shelf. The menu is simple but still plenty of options if you're a choosy eater. We went for the deviled eggs, antipasto plate, and bruschetta to start off. The bruschetta was very delicious. But the best appetizer: melon proscuitto- drizzled with balsamic vinegar. Who knew cantaloupe with taste so good with a savory meat?? For my main course I went with the ricotta filled ravioli special, topped with bacon and a poached egg. Ravioli, bacon, AND a poached egg?! You can't go wrong with that. It was delicious and just the right amount. Service was good but she seemed a little impatient - although I can't fault her for that since we didn't order for a while. However I can't help but point out the guy who refilled my iced tea and spilled on my white purse..I know he knew it too when he stopped and stepped back to continue pouring....All in all The Waterboy is a beautiful place for dinner on a summer evening - I would love to come back and sit out on their front patio!

My friends treated me to a birthday dinner, which consisted of the most delicious scallops I have ever had in my life, accompanied by a crisp glass of rose. I also tried the steak tartare-- it was to die for. All of the ingredients seemed extremely fresh and of great quality. I started recommending this restaurant left and right, specifically the scallops. Unfortunately, after my second time here, I was extremely disappointed. I ordered the same entree, and couldn't get through half of my meal. The scallops were a little overcooked (not a big deal), but the way they smelled and the texture of the meat left me with no appetite. Thankfully my date shared his meal with me, which was a succulent cut of lamb with a hearty potato puree, and perfectly roasted heirloom tomatoes. Aside from the scallop mishap, the atmosphere of this restaurant, the friendly staff, and the quality of most of their ingredients leave me hopeful.

The hostess quickly took our umbrellas to the back. The place is smaller than I thought it was going to be and I didn't care much for the wicker chairs. The service we received from our waiter was great though. We started off with the 5 Dot Ranch Steak Tartare. I was looking forward to eating this more than anything else. It's one of their signature dishes. It was so delicious that I could've eaten the whole thing by myself! The menu may not look extensive, but they also had several specials. I went with the Mixed Grill- lamb, pancetta, and sweetbread with saut\u00e9ed greens and polenta. It was my first time trying sweetbread (thymus or the pancreas). I'm not sure which animal it came from. The food was tender enough that we didn't have to do a lot of chewing. I cleaned my plate as did everyone else in my group. We shared several desserts. The best part of the Apple Crostada was the brown sugar-pecan ice cream. Cr\u00e8me Brulee is one of my favorite desserts. Theirs was served in a shallow and wide dish, so there was a lot of burnt sugar. My favorite dessert was the Pot de Cr\u00e8me. Salted caramel anything is usually a win. Desserts were a great way to end our meal.Even if there isn't a special occasion coming up, dine here anyway. You won't regret it!"], ["Jessica D.", "The food was amazing and our waiter, Andrew, was excellent. We started with the Antipasto. The hummus was delicious- had a nice kick to it and bell peppers. My sister had the Pork Chop with mash potatoes that was to die for. I had penna pasta with bacon, pork, and mushrooms. Needless to say, I scarfed it down. The Apple Crostata was amazing. The crest was buttery and flakey, the apples and the caramel sauce was a great combination. I could eat one everyday.

Our party ordered a variety of things, but I will highlight just a few. The seasonal fig and burrata salad was absolutely heavenly, and the sweetbreads were out of this world. Two people ordered the lamb and they both raved.

When we arrived we were sat and our server stated that he was notified of my being gluten free. We discussed my options and he also asked the kitchen a few additional questions just to make sure that I would be OK. We ordered the steak de jour, the deviled egg appetizer, the crispy potato salad and I ordered the Bouillabaisse, I was assured that this dish would indeed be gluten free.Deviled Eggs course: AWFUL my wife makes them a million times better no taste whatsoever, we had to add salt and pepper to make it palatable. Gross, this is supposed to be \"fancy\" deviled eggs ? I could have made 2 dozen for that price and they would have been a million times better. Sad.Crispy Potato Salad: Good, nothing special, tasted like hash browns.The steak de jour was enjoyed by my wife, but it was nothing to write home about. MY BOUILLABAISSE .... i am 5 minutes into eating it and the server walks by stops stares at my food and says, \" stop eating that\".....he proceeds to go back to the kitchen only to come back and tell me that the orange sauce aka \u00a0Rouille did have gluten in it and the kitchen messed up. He swooped it up and brought it to the kitchen he was upset, i dont blame him he was in talks with them about this issue the entire time. He brought out a new one, and honestly this was just terrible, it was very one note, bland, nothing was seasoned and the seafood was all over cooked. What a waste of great seafood. \u00a0He said he was very sorry for this mistake.The bill comes and NOTHING I MEAN NOTHING WAS COMPED, this is supposed to be a higher class/standards establishment, nothing really??? I would expect my meal to be comped, with an error such as this it would have been in good taste to comp the entire meal, thats a pretty serious mess up, the manager did not even come over to talk to us about the situation. This was all handled in poor taste and they should be ashamed. Needless to say I am just now writing this review because I have been sick since Saturday. I am not a trendy gluten free person, I have an autoimmune disorder and gluten drastically affects me immune system and \u00a0I get very sick. \u00a0I \u00a0would like some type of retribution for this situation and believe they should give me my money back, it was a total waste and I had to miss work today because of it. I often dine at the more upscale establishments here in Sacramento and I have never gotten sick before, or have experienced this level of unprofessionalism within a business. It is shocking!

We were also the youngest ones there by a couple decades (which should mean nothing in terms of serving or human decency in general). Now, when someone tells you the price of something, you would feel it's because they assume you are cheap and want to know the prices so you know whether or not you should share or get something less expensive. I have a good job, as does my fiance, and we have disposable income. Just because we don't come to The Waterboy every Friday doesn't mean we're cheap or don't make much money.AHEM. Anyway.Everything else was delightful. Service is slow, which is totally fine. I liked being able to sip my cocktail and chat between plates.What we had:- Bourbon Special: a little tart, very strong, and DELICIOUS. I would drink this every day.- Whiskey Sour: our server made it seem like people that order it with egg whites are weird. We are not weird. We like our whiskey sours made the right way. Okay? Okay.- Deviled Eggs: topped with shrimp and a cucumber slaw. Personally, I think crab would have been better, but it was still so tasty. A nice twist on a classic munchie.- Antipasto Plate: so many meats. so many cheeses. so many veggies. My one gripe is that I made it known on our reservation that I'm gluten free. They did not offer me anything as a replacement to bread or remove it from the plate and put it in a basket. Fortunately, I will not die if I come into contact with it.- Steak Tartare: it came with frites! They were hot and freshly salted and went perfectly with the steak.- Bay Scallops: with ginger carrot risotto and peas. So light and flavorful and the scallops were cooked perfectly.- Gnocchi in cream sauce: my fiance had this but wasn't in love. It tasted like any old alfredo sauce. He said the gnocchi were done perfectly. A bit heavy for a spring dish, though.- Coffee and tea to finish: always delicious.Overall, it was a really great dinner. About 2 hours start to finish, but I didn't leave feeling like I had inhaled all these courses too quickly, so that was nice.

However, it took our waiter excessively long to bring them out, even after we requested it. Nicely cooked though!Appetizer butternut squash was abundance of explosive flavors, perhaps a little too much. Tasty.Entree selections were limited, especially for mother who doesnt like seafood or beef. She got the chicken ravioli (the special for the day), which taste great at first, but got too buttery to finish the last bite. I ordered the tomato-saffron risotto with clams and pork belly, not bad but nothing special... seemed like someone was trying too hard to fit very different ingredients in one dish.Ordered the ginger pear upside down cake for dessert, which was more gingery and not as peary as expected.

I would order it all again. The beet salad was innovative and interesting. (usually beet salads consist of walnuts, arugula and goat cheese--that's a WINTER salad, just saying) But The Waterboy's beet salad was a SPRING beet salad and probably the best I've ever had. It had these green olives and grapefruit which sounds kind of bizarre but they were perfect taste pairings. Somebody back there knows what they're doing. I was wholly impressed. Dessert: Goat cheese and mascarpone cheesecake and rhubard pie pocket thing with homemade icre cream---Best cheesecake I've had in the United States, honestly both the best desserts I've had in a long, long time. Cocktails, pretty good, very strong, I appreciated that. But I've had more creative and balanced ones. Entrees: Here is the sad part, we got the lamb situation and the seabass situation. Lamb flavor was on point, but was kind of chewy. Seabass either wasn't good seabass, or was frozen, or cooked improperly, I'm not sure which, I think frozen. It was kind of overcooked in my opnion. Both entrees were over salted. I wouldn't order them again.Granted I did come in on a Tuesday, which is notoriously when you don't have your best dudes in the back, and hey, I'm not hating. I will definitely come back and try other entrees. The duck sounded really good. Maybe I just didn't order their speciality, that's totally cool.

The cheeses came with several toasted bread slices which were good; adding another accompaniment or two would really make the plate outstanding and allow for more exploration of the flavors and textures of the cheeses.At our table we enjoyed the steak frites, two portions of the pork special (pork belly, sausage, something else?), and one picnic plate. Everyone had great things to say about what each had ordered. I loved the frites that came with the steak.Desserts were awesome. Summer fruit crostata, affogato, creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and chocolate mousse cake were passed around between us. Each was excellent!My only complaint about our time was the wine menu. The least expensive wine on the menu was over $50. In my opinion, there should be wines that hit every price point available as there are excellent wines from the area as little as $20. But certainly the cheapest bottle of wine should not cost more than a main dish. Yes, Water Boy is an upscale dining experience, but there's no reason for the wine selections to all be so snobbishly expensive.That being said, we will definitely return!

With a variety of seating options available, including indoor, outdoor, high top tables, spaces at the bar, an additional dining room and lounge-style seating, large groups can easily be accommodated with adequate planning. At first glance, the robust, brag-worthy wine and beer list gave me a fair bit of a shock, but after taking a breath and a brief glance at the separate dining menu, I revisited it with the help of Aaron, one of the most competent servers I've ever had the pleasure of speaking with. The Organic Beet Salad and the Mac & Cheese were the perfect complements to the Quincy Sauvignon Blanc, recommended to me.

We had one sole purpose that evening: mac n cheese crawl (thank you Sacramento Magazine!). So we truffle mac'd it up and gave it an 8.5/10. \u00a0The pasta was al dente, with a great cheese sauce and just enough truffle that it was flavorful, rich, and not overwhelming.

Excellent service (from Amber) as well. Wines, of course, were right on solid.

This used to be a favorite spot of mine. Great wine, amazing cheese platters and dishes. But the last couple of times coming here you have really been slacking. My bf and I came here a few weeks ago to get one of their cheese platters that I LOVE. We chose a 3 cheese platter. When we were served I almost didn't notice there were 3 cheeses on the plate. The third cheese was literally shreds. I was very disappointed, but service was good and so was the food so we let it slide. Today was the last straw. My family and I came here after CIM. We sat down and waited for about 5 minutes before we even saw anyone that worked there. I usually come here in the late afternoon or evening, but when I do come for brunch I don't think their service is that great. Our server was really sloppy and poured our wine all over our glasses and dripped it on the table. The food was okay, but what really pissed me off was their bathroom. They really need to pay attention to it. I usually find toilet paper on the floor or seat covers still on the toilet. But today was just awful. There was pee all over the seat. My sister told our server, so taken care of right? Nope. I went to the bathroom about 15 minutes later and it was still there. My sister went again before we left, probably about 30 minutes after the staff was told of the problem and it was STILL THERE. Gross. Not to mention there were spider webs on the lamp near where we were seated. There are just as good of places to get wine and cheese that are clean, so for now that is where I'll be. I really used to love 58 Degrees. I hope they can get things together so I can come back and not be disgusted by their lack of cleanliness."], ["Eric K.", "I've been here several times but I thought I had already reviewed this place before.

I think maybe not many people know they offer brunch. I like the digs. Cute and comfortable surroundings, chill music, and of course, lots and lots of wine. The server was funny and personable. I looked over their brunch menu online before we got here, but their offerings were a tad different. No matter, as there was still a good amount of items to choose from. We tried the benedict, and duck and waffle, and a side of biscuit and gravy. The duck and waffle was the star out of the three dishes, which was topped with a sort of peach compote that went well with the duck. The waffle was crisp and fluffy, and tasted of creamy butter. The benedict was ok but dry. The biscuit and gravy were alright but I've had better. Both dishes were very salty.

All three that we tried were excellent. We had the Fig preserve with Brie, Sweet onion jam with soppresatta and grated manchego, and the Butternut squash,with maple glaze, cashew butter and fried sage. Again all three were very impressive. For mains I had he Hangar steak with potatoes and a dill yogurt sauce. She had Roasted Taro and Tofu. My dish was excellent but the taro was far too over done. It was supposed to be caramelized, but frankly it was scorched. It was difficult to cut into. \u00a0Both plates were gorgeous before we destroyed them. The dessert was very good. It was a Montana Huckleberry Cake. The texture and flavor were phenomenal. Of course they were on point in there wine recommendations. We had a Petite Sirah and a Riesling.

As good as any place in town. Try the truffle mac n' cheese and bruschetta trio for starters! I've come here for a drink and an appetizer before dinner, and the food is so good, I cancel my dinner reservation and eat here!*Could do better: Offer wine flights; make better use of the space in the back room, which is a wine storage area.OTHER INFO*Secret: There's a secret wine club room, that only members are allowed in. Probably also serves as a private party room. I've never been allowed in.*Last time, we sat near a tanned 50-something couple. The husband, sporting a gold watch and upscale vacation wear, was a little red in the face and it was clear that they had been through a bottle or two of wine. He was probably a big talker already, and on this occasion was turned to the side, trying to talk up a group of younger women. The mostly one-sided affair went on for some time, and I could tell that he was enjoying the conversation more than the women were, and MUCH more than his wife was.

It was filled with crab and fresh spring vegetables. The yuzu vinaigrette and mustard dressing were the perfect compliments for the two sides of the salad. The yuzu did not overwhelm the delicate taste of the crab and the tangy mustard dressing was perfect for the lettuce and vegetables, it was so good--I even ate my peas. Then the dessert tray came around. There were many choices and all are 300 calories or less, it is hard to say no when they come to the table. These tasty morsels are severed in glasses.

I strongly recommend to anyone who prefers excellent service because that's exactly what I got!"], ["Sam T.", "went there for thanksgiving dinner. wife saw that this place got a ton of good reviews. i gotta say, the experience was very ... uhmm plain; the food was flavorless. we ordered the vegetarian sampler dinner. i can make it taste better than that. seriously. expensive for a few bits of veggies laid out in a great presentation. ambiance - 8 out of 10 (i sat right under the radio speaker)food - 1 out of 10price - 1 out of 10we happen to be plant eaters and this place is def not for plant eaters. the options are much more if your a carnivore."], ["Anum A.", "3.5 stars for my first time trying out Seasons 52, after months of saying i wanted to eat here!!Lets start with the good- We arrrived and were seated right away. They were pretty slow for a Friday night, likely due to the fact that it was a holiday and most were with family and such. The restaurant is gorgeous. Dimly lit, very romantic, and beautifully decorated. There is an outside seating area but unfortunately the weather that evening did not permit for us to sit out there! Maybe next time.We asked for a booth and were seated, and our waiter Michael introduced himself and told us a little about the menu. The menu is seasonal, so you only get fresh ingrediants! Everything on the menu is gauranteed under 475 calories. We ordered some drinks and started with the Chicken Garlic Pesto Flatbread. I ordered the venison chop and we also ordered the filet mignon. Our pesto flatbread came out pretty quickly with the drinks. Now this flatbread is, like, really FLATbread. The bread is super thin! The toppings were deilcious and made a great combo. Despite the thinness of the crust, I very much enjoyed the flatbread!Now... here's the bad. We ordered both of our meat dishes cooked medium well. Mine came out medium rare and the filet mignon was cooked rare. I was ok eating my meat as-is but it was pretty disappointing. We asked the waiter if we could have the filet cooked more so that at least there was no blood. He was very apologetic and took the plate back. Unfortunately while waiting for the dish to come back, mine got cold. Whats even more disappointing is that when the filet came back, it still wasnt cooked medium well. We didn't send it back again.Seasons 52 would've earned a five star review from me, however this incident made me pretty disappointed and I actually felt that the cook was maybe a little lazy? Regardless, I was disappointed. The cook made Seasons lose 2 stars. However, the food was delicious, and our service was great. Michael was awesome and he deserves a 5-star review. He even gave us both free deserts. The deserts are super cute, by the way. They bring out a display of adorable single serving deserts and you can pick out what you'd like. We chose the smores and pecan pie deserts. Both were delicious! I think they're sized well, as both are pretty rich and filling. All in all we paid $100 for our dinner. You're paying for amazing service at a beautiful restaurant. I think it's worth the price- given your food is cooked to your liking. I'll be back,maybe next season, and I'll hope for less carelessnes from the cook."], ["Jackie F.", "I am consistently happy with the food at Seasons 52. We recently enjoyed the butternut squash soup and the blistered shishito peppers with goat cheese and grilled corn- it was very tasty and not something I had had before. My only suggestion would be that they serve it on a plate and not in a bowl because you do need to cut the tops off of the peppers to eat. What I like best is that they are constantly good, they have a great menu and well worth the price."], ["Kandy F.", "I've been here on several occasions now. \u00a0I've always had great service here. \u00a0Very knowledgeable servers. Their menus changes with the season as to the readily available fresh foods out in the market. \u00a0For example: \u00a0They cook with whatever is in season! \u00a0I like that concept because food does taste better in season and ripe. Lol.They have a nice piano bar. At one occasion I had met friends for drinks and it was fantastic. Another time we met friends for dinner. We shared several flat breads and oooooh so good. \u00a0We all ordered different dinners and everyone enjoyed their meals. \u00a0Afterwards...we sat at their patio area with a beautiful fireplace going. Great times with friends and coffee ( or vino ).This particular trip was vino!! Lol. \u00a0And a snack!! \u00a0We were shopping for the holidays and needed a little fuel. Lol. \u00a0Like I said...great place to sit back. Very cozy."], ["Cathy W.", "I found this place randomly on Yelp because we wanted to try somewhere new on the way back from our Tahoe trip. This place also had a 1000-point table on OpenTable so it was an easy decision. The service was impeccable. My husband and I ordered various dishes and they were very nice to split the salad and entrees into two so it's easier for us to share. - shrimp scampi- warmed mushroom and arugula truffle salad- caramelized sea scallops- caramelized brussels sproutsEverything was very delicious. It's really hard to believe they're all under 475 calories...LOL! The dessert was even more amazing - you get to see a whole platter full of your choices...they all look so amazing that I wanted to try ALL of them! We ended up picking mocha macchiato & s'mores dessert...YUM!This place has multiple locations too...definitely would come back again!"], ["Zack S.", "Flatbread appetizer was good--surprisingly good. Maybe too good, since it set an expectation that clearly exceeded this restaurant's capabilities. I ordered the lobster pasta. It was truly awful. Watery and bland.The ambiance and service was okay. I would give it two stars, but the prices--good lord. If you're going to charge that much, you need to deliver. This place didn't even come close. There's no way I'd go there again. Well, maybe for happy hour. I could go for a few beers and some $5 flatbread plates. I really was impressed by the flatbread. The three-mushroom is great. But the prices are just inexcusable. There are countless restaurants in Sacramento that offer a far better experience for cheaper."], ["Noy P.", "First time to dine here. \u00a0It didn't feel like this place is located in a mall--- it was classy. \u00a0It was very spacious with lots of seating. Lighting was just right--- dim enough to be romantic, but not too dark. \u00a0Food and drink selections were good. \u00a0Wish Seasons 52 was located closer to where we live--- we would have been regular patrons."], ["Sally S.", "I've received an invitation in the mail for a $52 credit towards an entree at Seasons52. Free food is what I heard! I thought to myself, why not go have dinner there, it shouldn't be that costly. So I decided to give this place another try. This would be my second time eating here. My first experience when they first opened wasn't the greatest. Our food came out dried-like. I felt like the food was just ok then. I've had better. Fast forward to 10/31. Decided to meet the bestie for dinner and take advantage of the $52 credit before it expires. We had reservations for 7:30p.m. We couldn't make up our mind of what to ordered. But we finally decided on their Oaked Grilled Filet Mignon, Maple-Glazed All-Natural Roasted Half Chicken, Caramelized Brussels Sprouts and their Lump Crab, Roasted Shrimp & Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms! We shared our food so our entrees were split in half. Good thing we did because the portions were perfect in size if not more. It was amazingly delicious! Their filet mignon was so tender! OMG.. I'm drooling just thinking about it! I can't complain at all about the other dishes! Everything came out PERFECTO! The bestie and I was beyond stuffed! It was an amazing dinner! I ended up taking what's left of my chicken and Brussels sprouts to go. Will I be a returning customer after this experience? Most definitely! Thank you Seasons52 for the invitation! I'm glad I gave you guys another chance! Oh, feel free to send me more invitations!"], ["Matt B.", "Food was great! Great atmosphere. It was a tad noisy due to the layout however that did not take away from the food, it did make it a little hard to hear our waitress as she attempted to explain various items on the menu.. Scallops were great!"], ["Becca B.", "I know it's a restaurant at a mall but it is really good. Everything is pretty low cal and fresh so you feel responsible when eating. I pretty always get the turkey skwers. Ask for desert as well! They bring you out all the choices on a tray and show you. It's really fun and pretty.Again, I know it's part of a mall (so my foodie friends might dismiss it) but the atmosphere is date night material."], ["Siddhartha M.", "Discovered happy hour at seasons. Arguably the best in Sacramento. \u00a0Nice upscale restaurant with quality season based menu. I had been here twice for dinner and never realized that they had an impressive happy hour. Now this is my to go place for post work sustenance. Great bartenders (Stephanie) with signature drinks if you inquire. I recommend for a classy yet causally unassuming dining experience."], ["L T.", "Had a lovely dinner here at Seasons 52 for my boyfriend's birthday. We brought our own wine, and the corkage fee is $15, not too shabby compared to Ella's $20. The ambiance at night time is different than at happy hour. More of a date night, more casual night out. Our waitress for the night was Vanessa C. She provided excellent service and took care of us very well. Every time she came by, she would make sure my wine glass was always filled. We ordered the crab and spinach stuffed mushrooms, duck lollipops, and tuna tartare for appetizers. All three were amazing. My only small complaint would be that the ratio of guac/mango to tuna was 3:1. It was a very thin layer of tuna at the top, but I didn't mind since the guac/mango mix was delicious. For entrees, we ordered the rack of lamb, stuffed quail, and a side of caramelized scallops. The rack of lamb was mediocre. It lacked any flavor to it.... It didn't even taste like they put salt/pepper on it. The potatoes and carrots that accompanied the entree tasted more flavorful than the main course! lol. The stuffed quail was delicious. I enjoyed the bacon/spinach that was underneath the quail. The stuffing inside was divine as well. The scallops tasted chalky, which usually happens when it is old and/or frozen for a long time. I'm glad I didn't get that as an entree, but rather an accompaniment. For dessert, I brought a fruit tart from Freeport bakery for my boyfriend's birthday, but Vanessa also offered us desserts from their variety of dessert shooters. We chose the s'mores and the pumpkin spice shooters. I thought they were alright, nothing special to note. I assumed the dessert was on the house since it was my boyfriend's birthday, but it was added onto the bill and I didn't realize it until after she charged my card. Overall, it was a good first time experience. Though, I didn't appreciate the extra charge. Make sure to look over your receipt before handing over your form of payment :) 3.5/5 for the food, because of the bland lamb.3/5 for the front service. We had to wait about 20 minutes for our table when I made a reservation a few days prior. 5/5 for our lovely waitress. Thank you so much for your hospitality and warm services, Vanessa. We had such a great night."], ["Jerry D.", "When you walk in, the room is a bit dim...lots of wood, modern decor, looks pretty elegant for the most part. \u00a0The dim lighting is great for a romantic dinner, but sometimes makes reading the menu a challenge. \u00a0Although this is a chain restaurant, they go out of their way to stick with local-ish produce, meats and seafood (they stick to West Coast suppliers, and go more local than that when they can). \u00a0The menu changes quite often (weekly, I believe) to take advantage of what is freshest and ripest in the markets. \u00a0With all of that going for it, I was a bit disappointed in the flavors of the food...I somehow expected more from the kitchen then they seemed to be able to provide. \u00a0I don't know if being a chain restaurant, and thus lacking a big-name executive chef who could adjust the corporate recipes better to suit the variances in the local produce from one store to another makes a difference, of if they just rely on more poorly-paid and less-experienced cooks than other restaurants in this price range, but many of the dishes tasted a bit off-balance. \u00a0For example, I had a porcini mushroom bisque. \u00a0The flavor of the porcinis definitely came though, but WAY too much! \u00a0The mushroom flavor was sooo strong, I had to ask for some cream to dilute it, it just overpowered my mouth with earthiness...too much of a good thing is not always better. \u00a0I also had the lobster flatbread, which was basically a crispy thin-crust rectangular pizza. \u00a0The lobster was barely there, a few clumps pf pinkish strands of meat, which would have been OK because they also used a light hand with the cheese and herbs, but they diced red peppers again overpowered the rest of the flavors of the dish, even though there didn't appear to be that much of it when you looked at it. \u00a0Didn't anyone sample the ingredients before putting the dish together? \u00a0With a lighter hand on the red peppers, this would have been a dish to rave about.The service was great. \u00a0Our server was very attentive, and gave some good recommendations off the menu, which she knew very well.With the quality of the ingredients here, and the excellent service, this place has the potential to be excellent, but they need someone with a firmer guiding hand and more nuanced palate in the kitchen to supervise the inexperienced staff. \u00a0It's a shame to see such good meat and produce being wasted by inexperienced cooks turning it into Applebee's or Chili's quality food...the prices here are too high for that."]]}
