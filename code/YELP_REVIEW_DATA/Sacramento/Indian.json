Its ok for small parties or functions but it does need some work. The sound system needs an upgrade really bad. They charge $150 if you want to use their sound system, which consists of a small old control unit and 2 speakers, only one of the speakers work. The audio cables used to hook up devices or speakers is in bad shape. The control box and cables are sitting on top of an unstable shoe rack looking thing and it starts swaying side to side if you barely touch it. Its hard to work with if you're the DJ and have your laptop or device set up on top of it. This is where the cables start having problems if the entire setup moves or shakes too much the cables come loose and your sound gets cut off. Not worth the $150 fee. The food is very mediocre. The butter chicken was ok, the lamb curry was way too fatty. In one spoon full you get maybe 2 pieces of lamb and the rest were big chunks of fat. The rest of the vegetarian curries were just alright. Their chicken kabab is also very mediocre. I had some pieces in my order that were juicy but no flavor, and then some pieces were flavorful but dry. Definitely had better at other places. I don't know why their food tasted a little \"off\". I've heard of some people rave about their food but it wasn't very good. I thought it was bad that night because they were making everything in large batches for the party and if they make individual orders on a regular day it might be better. I'm going to have to try it again on a regular day and maybe give them a better review if things change. Their food needs to get better specially if its cooked for buffets for parties, and their equipment could use an upgrade."], ["Nathan U.", "Really good, authentic food!

I decided to take my kids here for the lunch buffet, so they can pick whatever they wanted. I even ordered fries just in case they didn't like it, but I was surprised my kids loved it. They love dipping the naan bread with all the curry. They also have this delicious mango shake that my kids enjoyed. Everything was so fresh and delicious I had to go back for seconds with never ending fresh naan bread. I just love that fact that my kids loved it and ask when can we go back to eat there again. The food was that good. Plus the waiters were so nice they kept coming back refilling our drinks and bread. I can't wait to go back and pig out again."], ["Sandi B.", "I was working in Massachusetts last year, and we would sometimes go to a wonderful Persian/ Iranian restaurant for kabobs. They were wonderful hunks of beef and vegetables on a skewers. \u00a0Had a taste for that, so though I would try Kabab N Chutney. The kabab in this restaurant is much different- it was kind of a sausage like long piece with Indian \u00a0spices. I was kind of debating on leaving a 3 or 4 star review. I liked it, but not as much as the one I had at the previous restaurant, But then again, I had a pre conceived idea of what to expect, and probably because of regional/cultural differences, they are not made the same way. Service was a little slow- but not extraordinarily so. The waitress came and apologized- without me saying anything about the service- and gave us a free appetizer, which was nice. Also had the vegetable samosa, which was very good, I though the prices were extremely reasonable. One of the Yelp questions asked if this was a good restaurant for kids. I brought my grandkids, ages 6 and 7, because i want them to experience different foods. They had kabab wraps- \u00a0wrapped in Naan. One liked it- one didn't. If your child likes trying different food and likes food a little spicy, this is a good place."], ["Maryclare H.", "We have been here a few times and every time the food never disappoints.

Shakeel made sure everything went smoothly and in a timely manner. Our guests loved the food and so did we.

I can say without any regrets that i had every dish there and that stuff is the real deal, so good.The service is good also, i haven't had to ask for water refills or naan refills they are always on top of it..I think if you're Looking for some spicy, authentic, and flavorful Pakistani-Indian food, you have to give this place a shot. there's really nothing comparable in the area."], ["Xeng Y.", "Really good food, but the price is a ok for the portion.

And the AYCE buffet sounded appealing.I came here with my husband for dinner buffet. There were only a few options available from curry to chow mein. The rice was also hard and stale. Although I wanted salad, the waiter never refilled it, so I did not get a chance. For $30 (two people), I expected a lot more. The fact there was hard and stale chicken nuggets and chicken chow mein did not appeal to my pallet. I expected Indian food at an Indian restaurant, and not a mixture of American and Chinese cuisine just to fill up the warmers. Only the front warmers contained food, and the kheer was mediocre. The naan was disappointing since it looked and tasted like it was store bought and not freshly made."], ["Cheri W.", "Expect authentic Pakistani and Indian food! \u00a0This is what Kabab N Chutney is all about! \u00a0The restaurant is basic but fairly clean. \u00a0Good or bad, it was good to see security actively patrolling the area."], ["Lisa S.", "Food is very tasty.

We were barely through the first basket when they brought us another basket of naan. OK. Hey I love naan and won't turn down more! But it was odd that I had to walk to the other side of the restaurant to get my own soda. I don't mind getting it myself but there's half-dozen employees and no customers, and if you're watching the table like a hawk for naan quantity, maybe offer to bring a soda too? Not a big deal, just thought it was weird.The food was hot and tasty. The naan was amazing. Price was totally reasonable: $15ish for 2 lunch buffets with drinks.

We were seated right away and given menus. \u00a0Our waitress was very helpful and nice explaining some of the dishes we asked about. \u00a0Water is served in a \"pour yourself\" glass decanter that was room temperature. \u00a0Of all the delicious looking options available, our choices narrowed down to Prawn Masala, which is a shrimp curry cooked as a red sauce containing green peppers, onions & spices, Aloo Palak is a spinach dish that contains large chunks of potatoes and spices, Vegetable Biryani is Basmati rice mixed with lots of vegetables and saffron, and finally we tried 2 types of Naan: garlic and onion. \u00a0It took quite a while for our food to be served, but you could hear them working hard in the kitchen. \u00a0A good sign of getting freshly prepared food! \u00a0Once the dishes arrived, it looked and smelled so good. \u00a0We dug in immediately, filling our plates. \u00a0Those first bites were very reassuring that our whole meal was going to be a successful lunch. \u00a0 Every dish was so flavorful and had the right amount of spices and heat. \u00a0I did notice that a lot of oil is used in the dishes, but I guess it is necessary for the recipes. \u00a0We'll see how our stomachs handle it later! \u00a0Ha!

We ordered the berahani beef kebab, butter chicken, and garlic naan. I did not enjoy the berahani beef kebab for many reasons. One of the reason was the texture was too soft to my liking and it did not taste like beef, instead it tasted like liver. Also, the portion was very small for the price and lastly, the veggies that came with it seemed old and not fresh. The butter chicken sauce was on the okay side, but some chicken strips were stale and hard. The last item, the garlic naan, was perhaps the only item i liked. It was fresh, warm, and tasty, but sort of lacked the garlic taste. All in all, I didn't really enjoy my experience. The service could be a bit better and the food is not the best.

As a long-time customer, I wasn't impressed with their buffet choices and this was on a Saturday afternoon which didn't have any traffic in customers. They've always prided themselves in having a rich selection of buffet choices. But this selection wasn't impressive and, at $13.00 a head, was rather costly. There were some positives: The naan bread was good as usual; as were the chicken kebobs, the selection of sauces and the basmati rice. But beyond that, the rest of the buffet was lacking. The chicken pakoras were never refilled on the buffet for the entire time we were there. The chicken and lamb curry looked watery, and the lentils didn't look appetizing. The waiter was friendly and attentive to our needs. But when the bill was $39.00 for a family of three, no drinks, just the buffet. I was expecting much more out of Kathmandu Kitchen than this recent visit. Not a bad experience, by any means, but I left feeling disappointed."], ["Abigail L.", "I only came here because I bought a groupon for this place. The groupon was good for dinner and it was for 2 entree and an appetizer for $18.50. Before I ordered I asked what the groupon is good for in case they had restrictions for menu items since I noticed there were some restrictions listed on the groupon itself, just wanted to make sure there were no more. When I asked the waitress told me they dont take any groupons. I was surprised since this has never happened before and the groupon itself didnt expire until October. I told her I wanted to talk to the manager and she pointed me in his direction and I asked if he could just come to the table and explain it. He ended up giving me a buy one entree get one free deal instead of the groupon but his story was one of the mangers called groupons drunk and set up the deal so now they are not allowing the groupon to be valid. I personally don't believe the story especially since they list restrictions on the groupon for certain items. Now they told me to contact groupon and ask fora \u00a0refund, I hope groupon actually refunds me or else I will kathmandu even less for shady business practices.Onward to the food, I ordered the Lal Maas since I've never had it before and i did it with the dinner meal that came with rice, naan, side of veggie and some bean stuff. The portions for the side of curry veggie was absolutely tiny and I couldn't taste much curry on it. The naan was super disappointing since it wasn't hot when I received it and it was too doughy for my test. The mild lal maas which was a lamb dish was okay. It wasnt awful but it also wasn't spectacular.Service: aside from the mishap in the beginning concerning groupon everyone seemed to be very nice, someone asked if we wanted more rice or naan when they noticed we were out and they refilled out waters. The manager came back later and checked in with us to see how we were doing. I asked for container to go since I had leftover lal maas which is lamb in a sauce and they gave me a normal box container which unfortunately spilled so I lost quite a bit of the sauce when I was transporting it home. \u00a0I would recommend them to give their customers who have saucy dishes to go soup containers to avoid this. Also I didn't want to put my naan with my lamb because I didnt want it to get soggy so I placed it on top of my to go box expecting someone to come by and offer another bag, napkin or something for my naan and nothing. I ended up just asking for a bag later to put all my stuff into.Overall, the food isn't that great considering my dinner cost close to $18 \u00a0for small portions of mediocre food.

We said hello to an approaching waitress as we were waiting to be seated, who then proceeded to ignore us and chat up some people at a table in the front, leaving us standing there another couple of minutes. When we were finally seated, we ordered vegetable somosas for our appetizer, in addition to Veggie Momos and Alu Kauli Ko Tarkari (potatoes and cauliflower curry), Thali style for our entrees. The veggie somosa were just ok I would say, and didn't have much spice or flavor. The Momos my wife ordered came out next but my entre was nowhere to be seen. We usually like to eat together so this was a bit odd. Also, not only were some of her momos broken open, but they were not very well presented (dipping sauces thrown ontop like in a take out tray) and they had too much vinager for her liking.\u00a0My dish was average I would say, and the naan was good, but the portion of rice and curry could have been larger, so I would probably recommend getting this a la carte, especially if you're like me and are not a fan if the pickled cucumber chutney that comes when you order it Thali style.It seemed like we didn't have one waitress per se, as we had at least two, and both were helpful and pleasant I would say. Both disappeared however when we wanted to pay our bill. We saw the manager hovering around the back of the room and managed to flag him down finally, but after he ran my credit card I watched him deliver it absentmindedly to another couples' table. They looked at it and were confused but he walked away and didn't even notice his mistake, so I had to walk over and retrieve it. That was weird.We used a Groupon this time so even though the experience was far from memorable, I guess it wasn't a total loss. I agree with Dave M. that this place has definitely gone downhill and may be on its way out. For us it was definately below average and there is already plenty of average Indian food in Sac. IMO.

(I tried burfi at another place but wanted to compare)I didn't have time to sit down and eat so I ordered for pick up. The lady on the phone was nice and easy to understand. I got butter chicken, garlic naan, plain naan, mango burfi and a gulab jamun that had a cream in the middle. She even called me to tell me that my food was ready (I was given a time of 15 min and that is about what it took) I got my food, and actually tried the Lassi, burfi, galub jamun, and naan in the car. WOW! I hurried home and poured the butter chicken on a plate. Beautiful golden/orange colored sauce (mild) poured onto the plate and made a nice little pond for the chicken. For me, the serving of chicken was perfect, but might be small if you have an extra large appetite or don't eat naan or anything with it. The chicken came with rice in its separate container. It was warm and aromatic with small shavings of something (pistachio? I am not sure) on it. Anyways, I only used 1/4 of the rice cause I had naan. The warm rice sopped up the butter chicken sauce and the flavor was outstanding. The chicken is not over flavored with any curry or any one flavor for that matter. The meat was tender and the rice and sauce with it hit the spot of my craving. I have never had butter chicken but after reading how it is made, I think it tasted exactly how I thought it would. The sauce is not thin and not overly thick, it will soak in to the rice, but it is thick enough to spoon onto some naan without it running off too fast. Both naan were soft, doughy and delicious. Wrapped in paper and then wrapped in foil, it too, was warm when I opened it at home (I already tried in the car though). The garlic naan has some herbs and minced garlic cooked on to it, like they spread it and fry it really quick. \u00a0The mango lassi was cold, creamy and refreshing. My kids liked the drink as well. It is a slightly different taste a traditional smoothie but it is good and not as heavy as a milkshake. \u00a0I definitely would come here just to get this on a warm day. \u00a0Next time I come here, Im looking forward to trying the lamb biryani, chicken tikki masala or tandoori chicken, or tandoori chapatti."], ["Craig J.", "I went to AB Indian on recomendation by a friend, who is actually from the Indian subcontinent. \u00a0When discussing Indian cuisine with people of Indian origin, there is a disagreement between folks from the subcontinent and those from FIji. \u00a0Since it was a first vist, we sampled the Tandoori Chicken and Lamb Punjabi prepared mild instead of spicy. \u00a0Although ordered mild, the Lamb Punjabi sauce still had some spicy heat while flavorful enough to soak your Paratha bread into. \u00a0Portions were ok. \u00a0Ambiance is divey but my rating is based on the food. \u00a0Staff are welcoming and very helpful to those with virgin stomachs to Indian cuisine. \u00a0The customers here tend to patronize for the sweets at the counter and takeout orders, rather than a traditional dine-in purpose. \u00a0AB Indian was a good experiance and will visit again to try other entrees."], ["ron c.", "I drove from Vacaville to AB Indian Sweets to get some meetai and boy was it awesome. \u00a0It was definitely worth the trip! \u00a0I bought a 5 pound box of sweets....they have everything! \u00a0Gulab jamins, laadoos, barfees and a huge variety too. \u00a0The guy prepared a good mix for me. \u00a0I shared the sweets with my family and girlfriend's family and everyone enjoyed it a lot. \u00a0It brought a lot of fun and especially cause the meetai, sweetens everyone's mouth and tastebuds it was a really awesome treat. \u00a0I highly recommend this place!"], ["Sasha C.", "I go out to eat with my dad at lest once a month, since I just recently gave up meat, he suggested one of his local favorites. AB Indian, is small restaurant with about six tables, and a pastry case at the register. Unlike a lot of Indian restaurants there isn't much emphasis put on the ambiance, which is good because that attention is instead place on the food. The server was very kind a knowledgeable about the different dishes and remembered what my dad had ordered in the past. My dad and I both ordered the AB Special; only order this if you are very hungry and still expect you'll most likely be taking some home. The special comes with four dishes, a vegetable rice, naan, a crunchy bread and dessert. Unfortunately I can't remember the names of all the dishes we ordered, what I do remember was the Navrattan Korma was Delicious! Navrattan Korma is a mixture of vegetables and sauce, we both gobbled it up first. My dad isn't a fan of Raita, a mixture of yogurt with some cucumbers and other seasoning, but I love it. To eat it, you'll want to put some rice in first to soak it up, then eat it! give it a try. The garlic Naan was the best I've ever tried, we also tried the stuffed with potato naan (that's not what it called but I'm sure you could easily find it by reading the descriptions) that was good too. I was too full to try dessert and I cant remember what I got to go, but I selected sweet looking little white balls dipped in coconut out of the pastry case. One thing I have learned about Indian food is not to be in a hurry, good food takes time and is well worth the wait, so expect to spend about an hour there if you order as much food as we did."], ["Christina H.", "This place hasn't been open long...possibly under 2 weeks. \u00a0It's located in a new strip mall near the corner of Mack and Stockton Blvd. \u00a0I have only had Indian food probably twice so my judgment of how it should be can be scrutinized. I do know whether or not something is fresh and tasty though.This restaurant is primarily a sweets and catering business. There are only 2 tables in this small place. They have a case that features all kinds of interesting desserts. \u00a0I walked in wanting to try something new and interesting. Upon looking at the menu I became confused and disoriented at my lack of ability to chose something. I decided to try their lunch special which consisted of 2 vegetable dishes, nan, rice and raita for $4.99. \u00a0There were 4 vegetable dishes to pick from and since I didn't really hear what the friendly worker was telling me I pointed at a couple that looked good (they have a back bar that holds some pre-made items). \u00a0He called back the nan and scooped up my lunch. The plate was perfect sized with a nice portion of smooth rice, some lettuce, a small \u00a0(but sufficient) cup of raita and my two entrees. The nan was a little flatter than I have had before but tasty. I found out after I ate and asked the very helpful and friendly worker what I had eaten. It was Aloo gobhi Masala (cauliflower and potatoes) and Malai Kofta (mixed vegetables and cottage cheese balls in a butter sauce). I couldn't get enough of the Mali Kofta!! Had I known there was cottage cheese in it, I probably would never had ordered it because I can't stand cottage cheese and would have pictured something COMPLETELY different.Overall, I was really happy with my food and thought the place was nice and a great stop for lunch or dinner to go.

We ordered:Fish pakoras - fresh, pipping hot fried fish with Indian spices. This was a favorite for the 10 and 11 year old dining with us. Paani Puri - this version is a sweeter version of crispy, circular puff shells that you fill with a mixture of mashed potatoes, chickpeas and herbs. For me, I wished the sauce was a bit spicier but for the kids, they loved the mixture of sweet and tangy. Vegetable appetizer platter:two large samosas - stuffed with a mixture of spiced potato and peas marinated; full of flavor and a kick of heat; must try with some of the mint and tamarind sauceassorted fried vegetables pakoras: I wish they would have used some more onions and made the potato pieces a tad thinner and the batter was too thick for the pakoras. Overall, it was okay.Dal Tadka - a bowl of mixed lentils and red kidney beans. We were actually disappointed by this dish. It should have been a dish of one kind of lentil with a heaping of \"tadka\" which is usually a mixture of hot pipping oil flavored with hot chili pepper and other various Indian spices. This was more of a mix dal curry and not your normal \"dal tadka\". Also, if you're not a big fan of ginger this dish had cubed sized ginger, it should have been a ginger paste or finely chopped ginger pieces. Baingan Bharta - This spiced eggplant dish isn't your normal eggplant cooked in cream. This one was cooked with onions and spices. It tasted better the next day after the spices had enough time to marinate into the eggplant. One of our favorite dishes of the night. Butter chicken - pieces of moist chicken pieces mixed in with a smokey, slightly tangy tomato cream sauce. I loved their sauce better than most that I have had because of the hint of smokiness. This is a safe dish if you have kids with you. Garlic naan- soft, butted garlic naan a side that everyone loved. basmati rice - just plain basmati rice topped with cilantro, nothing special"], ["Tina N.", "What do you eat when you have to eat veggie?

It was pretty much the exact same thing but instead of chicken it was paneer! I was a happy camper with my garlic naan and veggie butter chicken haha. I think it was the shahi paneer.

There's lunch buffet from 11am-3pm going on while I was there as well. My takeout order took about 10 minutes before it was ready which was really fast. I ordered the Butter Chicken, garlic naan, and vegetable samosas (come with 2). The Butter Chicken had a nice kick to it (spicy level), it was creamy, tomato-y, with deliciously tender chicken. The garlic naan was a little soggy, being that it was a takeout order and had to be wrapped in paper/foil, which is understandable. It had a nice garlic taste to it though, and went great with the butter chicken! The veggie samosas came with the green and tamarind sauce and had a nice kick to the filling. Crispy and flavorful, it was just great. Their samosas have a unique twist to it because of the salty/sour powder they sprinkle on top which is nice.

We ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Tikka Masala, Naan, Garlic Naan and the Chicken Biryani. The Chicken Tikka Masala was delicious, quite possibly the best in Elk Grove. I recommend that you get the medium spice level as it gives you a nice kick without being over powering. It paired perfectly with the chicken biryani and naan.As for the service...everyone that helped us was wonderful. The owner even came out and attended to us as they were getting ready to close. We received our food rather quickly as it was later in the evening but everything was really fresh and tender.

I looked around and saw that at least 3 tables were still left with a pile of dirty dishes on there. So you're just are you not cleaning after your customers? Anywho, all I ate was a bit of the butter chicken. It was good with the rice. I sat and ate for a while before they said they would give me naan or water. After I got a taste of the water, I quickly asked for sprite since it tasted weird. I also went up to look for napkins and they didn't have any more so I sat back down. I think one of the staff saw my facial expression and figured out that there was no more napkins so he personally went to restock them and brought some over to my table.

Stockton Blvd (this zipcode for this location is incorrect, make sure your GPS has the one for W Stockton), a very kind lady directed me on the phone to the correct location. When I walked in the door, I was met by the same kind face that matched the voice on the phone. The place is shared with non-Indian and Indian patrons. It reminds me of the home cooked restaurants you find in college towns, where the cooks cater specifically to native eaters. Chaat of India is new, and I think it is the bomb. Perhaps the most authentic Indian food I've had yet in Sacramento. I ended up ordering Aloo Gobi and Saag Paneer (spicy) for my bf and me. The food was simply amazing, and my bf said the saag was almost a transcendent experience for him because of the spice combination and level of spiciness. The portions were good (for the richness of Indian food). I think we only ate 1/3 of the food.The only thing I'd suggest they work on is the vegetarian selections for the buffet. Originally I had planned to get three buffets to go, but ended up going for the individual dishes for dinner, and just one buffet for lunch to split with a friend. The lunch buffet had three dishes for vegetarians and one appetizer, which is an awesome number--however, one of the dishes was a strange hybrid \"bowtie\" noodle and the appetizer was eggrolls. These two hybrid dishes were just okay as compared to what I know the potential of these cooks...and I think the eggrolls were frozen, which was disappointing. The restaurant is based off of Mack and W Stockton, so I am guessing perhaps there are some patrons who enjoy the eggrolls. However, I was expecting vegetarian pakoras and perhaps one of the two dishes I listed above like a Saag or Gobi for their buffet. Instead it was a paneer curry (that was good) and daal (equally good). My suggestion for them, is if they're doing the buffet--consider the vegetarians equally. Vegetarians are Wonderful allies for Indian restaurants and Indian buffets. They will drive across town and bring friends (and tell friends) and become totally devoted if an Indian place has a good spread for vegetarians, too. I hope Chaat of India might change their minds regarding the hybrid-vegetarian options, and just be themselves. In the meantime, I'll keep coming back for the regular dishes and will renew this review after visiting again. I suggest for any vegetarian to come and enjoy Chaat either way! It's amazing, and you've had nothing like it in Sac. Its a easy drive from wherever you live on the 99. Happy eating, everyone!One more thing--as far as the \"Indian\" patrons as compared to non-Indian patrons being treated differently. I did notice some Indian patrons asking for things non-Indian patrons didn't, and the wait staff helping them. However, they also did the same for non-Indian patrons when they asked for Chai, or anything else they knew about Indian cuisine. My observation: I think sometimes when Americans go to Asian restaurants where the food and culture is authentic (and the patrons are from the country of the cuisine), they take this mixed-cultural environment as prejudicial. However, I think it's cool when I'm in a restaurant and I hear non-English languages spoken, and get a better sense of a food's culture. I think a lot of these negative reviews were perception based, not actual."], ["Abdullah S.", "Butter chicken and naan was good. Good service. Rice was not fresh. Not much variety and no desserts.

Other people who come to this restaurant, expect to be here at least 1 and a half hours due to how they serve your food.I really like the food here. This is the best Indian food I've had anywhere in Sac (so far). But I had to take away two stars for a few reasons. I have been to this restaurant twice now and each time, I waited almost an hour to get my food. I know they make it fresh, so it will take a bit longer. But this is not why I'm taking away two stars. I took them away because during my two visits here, I noticed that anyone who is not Indian gets their food last. Both times that I have been here, I have witnessed Indian people who came into the restaurant after me or after other customers that aren't indian receive their food before us. The first time I went here, there was a Caucasian family that had been there before us and two other tables with Indian families there. My cousin and I were seated promptly and we ordered 10 minutes after sitting down. Of course the tables with Indian families had food and the Caucasian family were still waiting for their food. Then I watched as 3 different Indian families came in after us and received their food before us. Me and my cousin ordered 1 appetizer and 2 entrees only. The Indian families that came in after us ordered the same amount, if not more and they received their food first. The Caucasian family received one or two of their dishes so far and were still waiting for the rest. The Indian families however, had all received their food and were already eating. Me and my cousin were still waiting for our food and watched as the other 3 tables got their food even though they came AFTER us. By the time my table and the Caucasian table had been done eating, they were just about to close. Two of the 3 indian families had finished their food and left already. My table and the other table left at the same time since it took so long for our food to come out.The second time I was there, I was with a friend and his son. we came in at 8pm. The same thing happened. We came in, waited 10 minutes to be seated, while there were 2 tables filled in the restaurant; one is a table with 2 Asian girls and the other table an Indian customer. So we sat ourselves down at a table and waited to order. Low and behold, two Indian families came in after us. And what happens? They get their food before us and the table with the 2 Asian girls still have not received all their food yet, even though they were there before any of us. The other table with the indian customer was empty by that time because he had received all his food and had been done eating. So I look at the table right behind me because they came in after me and they had 3 different entrees and side dishes while our table had 1 entree. I look across the restaurant at the other indian family that came in after me and they ordered way more food then my table, but still got everything brought out at about the same time. We had 1 appetizer and two entrees this time also and one entree came out after a 45 minute wait and the other 15 minutes after the first entree. By the time we were done eating, there was only my table, the table with the 2 asian girls left and one of the indian families that came in after us (but they had their leftovers packed already and were just hanging out after eating). Of course my table and the table with the asian girls were the last ones to pay and leave. We left at the same time. I'm seeing a pattern here. It was 10 pm by then, past closing time. All the other indian customers had received their food already, ate and left before the restaurant closed. Don't get me wrong. The food here is good, and the staff are very friendly, but because they prioritize certain people over others, I will NOT be back. They get 2 stars for the food and 1 for the friendly service, but I took away two due to their prioritizing certain people over others. That is NOT how you run a restaurant. First come, first serve should be every restaurants motto."], ["Brittany H.", "We just finished our meal and are sooooo satisfied! We ordered Butter Chicken and Prawn Curry ...

We asked for both entrees to be \"spicy,\" and of course being Indian food the spice builds as you eat. By the end I was sweating, but it was so delicious I was sad when I got full!

Parking is ample as its in the same center as the Goodwill store, a gas station and a Food Co. They advertised that they were open at 11:00 but upon arrival, they were open but they told us they're buffet didn't start until 11:30. Sighhhh, so we had to go another time. When we went, we were greeted fast. The place is small but fairly clean. The buffet selection was fairly small- about 8 different items. For vegans, the only choices are a plain yuk bagged iceberg lettuce and cucumber and onion salad, rice, and a dal that says it's vegan but is so spicy it makes your linings burn (! which can be good or bad I guess). They had fish pakora, a few chicken dishes and one of them had white tender meat, potatoes and peas, and a few other dishes. Veggies are at a minimum here, but who eats veggies these days? (I do I do! Im vegan.. sighhhh). They had rice pudding and a few dressings too. Their naan came after our first plate and tasted pretty decent. The decor isn't anything to be desired, but their food was tasty (kinda spicy for the average person tho). Buffet was 8.99 which isn't so bad. I didn't go into their bathroom there though because one lady was saying that she couldn't get the light to turn on. They have a hand sanitizer dispenser on the wall by the window and I hd my own hand spray anyway. For vegans, you'll probably have to order on the menu unless you're like me and don't mind mega dal. For meat eaters, it seemed that everyone was pretty satisfied. Not to be racist or anything, but a good sign was there was a lot of Indian customers there so it was probably authentic tasting. I'd go back if I was too lazy to go to my Indian hot spot downtown. It's worth a try. There's limited seating too..."], ["Oswald H.", "Palak pakora, chicken tikka masala, shahi paneer, saag paneer, buttered nan; perfection. We waited twenty-five minutes for our order.

When we went in there was hardly anyone as it was early evening time, we ordered some chaat, chicken pakora, boti-wrap and desi-chicken-wrap. Everything came out pretty quick obviously the chaat was the 1st to arrive, it was fresh and pretty good, then the chicken pakora which was really tasty considering the chicken was marinated beforehand which added to that additional flavor, the STAR was boti-wrap absolutely delicious real perfect spiciness and flavor in short I just couldn't stop my mouth from munching on it but then there is always something that acts a let down which was the desi-chicken (C)wrap.And by the time we were wrapping up the samosas were looking great in other patrons table and I did order a to-go, another great product (Good portion size, nice spiciness) \u00a0and they give you chole on the side.So, Overall a great experience definitely my to-go place on my next visit to SacTown."], ["Kb B.", "I was in Sacramento for some business and I was craving for some Indian food.

Then the paneer tikki masala, delicious, especially with the garlic naan bread. Just a little more on the spicy side for me, but still very good. The lassi was okay. I wasn't feeling it, but then again, my taste buds were a little off that day. Anyhoo, two days later, I was back at it again. I ordered \u00a0the Buttery Chicken, bomb! It's a little on the sweet and creamier side, which I like a lot. And I also ordered the sagg paneer, which was good, but the buttery chicken was the highlight that evening. Food here is yummy!

Insult to injury, they didn't even offer a 'sorry for the trouble'. Probably top 3 worst service offenses I can actively recall.Regardless of that incident, the food I got that night was bland. I've never had Indian food where I didn't immediately devour it all. We couldn't finish either the chicken tikka masala or choley bhature because it just didn't taste right. Both the nann and papri chaat were good, although the papri chaat was too sweet the second time I went.My image of the place was really tainted from the first impression.

The naan was good...yay!We ordered wine but sent that back as it was like vinegar and got a bottled beer instead.Maybe we just came at a bad time because the place was packed (maybe because of the buffet option).The staff were courteous but not really that interested in the guest experience.

What a great spot to experience my first Indian food and buffet!The options blew me away.

I don't have a lot of knowledge about Indian food though, and nothing to compare it to, so that might just be how Indian food is typically made though.

It's sort of like a dippable pita bread to polish off the remaining sauce on your plate. I also got to try their mango lassi--basically a chilled yogurt and mango smoothie--which was great too! I'm not much of a curry connoisseur, but all-you-can-eat with a drink for 12 bucks is not bad! Based on other reviews the staff can seem neglectful during peak hours.

If you a have guest that eat like a bird, then you may want to think about cutting some in half just to be sure they don't go to waste; your guest can always go back for more. Another plus is that they are vegetarian! With so many people becoming more health and animal-conscious-thus moving away from animal products and bi-products-this is the perfect appetizer (although I can eat these as my main dish)!The filling has just the right amount of spice, but mild enough for adults to try for their first time and for kids to enjoy. \u00a0They give you the traditional chutneys: Imli ki (tamarind) and my favorite is the pudina (mint).

The bhel puri was a bit stale. The samosas were old as well, and the crust was more hard than chewy. The batura was ok. The curry was very bland but the puris were good. The sweets are a hit or miss. The pistachio burfi was very good, as was the coconut burfi. Skip on the cham chams as they are way too sweet and syrupy. Also skip on the stuffed gulab jamuns as the filling had a weird, dry, not-sweet texture. Ras malai sucked as well, the milk being very watery and the rest not so good either.The people were nice, although I can't understand a 13 year old doing all the work while the mom was watching t.v. in sweats and slippers.

Store front - yelp.com/biz_photos/pooj\u2026I've been to my fair share of Indian restaurants AND I'm still figuring it out, you can never go wrong at a buffet! (Well, correction, you can \"go wrong,\" but thanks to yelp*, the odds are in your favor.)The restaurant is well lit, relatively spacious, and clean.Dining Room - yelp.com/biz_photos/pooj\u2026I arrived at Pooja's when their doors opened for lunch @ 11:30am, with another couple walking in right behind me. When I go for buffet, I try to arrive right @ the start because I've been to a number of AYCE spots and 45 minutes in, it's not a \"purdy\" sight. Also, I can take some decent photos w/o splatters, handprints, and smears coating the buffet line... It was beautiful. (Single tear rolls down cheek)Buffet - yelp.com/biz_photos/pooj\u2026As I slowly made my way through the buffet line, taking my time to pick & choose for Round 1, the obvious thing that stood out, \"No skimping!\" Pooja Indian Grill is very generous with their meat portions and it shows. For $10/person, you would be hard pressed to find a buffet with equal quality and quantity. (Impressed.)Lamb curry - yelp.com/biz_photos/pooj\u2026I've been to my fair share of cheap, AYCE spots w/similar pricing and without fail, a solid 2 stars and that's on a good night. You know the place I'm talking about... 'We've all been to that one Asian buffet that's usually a Chinese knock-off of real Chinese food. The chaffing dish of the beef & broccoli has a whole lot of broccoli and sliver like bits & pieces of beef. Pooja Indian Grill is NOT that place!...

For under $10, you can eat all the naan, saag paneer, butter chicken, mango ice cream, and samosas that you could ever want. Everything tastes super fresh. Most items are well spiced as well -- this is probably the spiciest buffet I've come across but not unbarably so.I'll tell you all a secret -- if you fill the fried naan (that you can find at the buffet) with mango ice cream, it's the best dessert in the whole world.

My mom ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, which she downed without hesitation, and my wife ordered a Paneer Masala. Flavors were spot on, so much that i left in pain from stuffing Naan down my throat.

He orders different things every time, but in all honesty i have a hard time going away from the tikka masala! The location is dreadful, but its so close to west capital, it can't be helped. Sometimes there are scary bums and creepers handing around if you go at dinner time, but once you are inside its ok. :) I would not say they are overly friendly here but their service is good and they are always helpful if you need something.

I'm sure you could order off the menu and be happy too. Otherwise, make sure you come during buffet hours.Their selections change, but there are the usual staples: tandoori chicken, naan, saag paneer, etc. There are excellent vegetarian options as with any Indian food establishment. I don't think there was any item that I disliked.Over the years they have gone from excellent, to just phoning it in. Lately they have stepped up their game and it is as tasty as ever. There was also a light remodel of the decor. I think the price is $11 to $14 depending on when you go (it used to be $8 until people like me made that a bad business model... Sorry). The price is well worth it. I'm not sure if there's a better place in town. If there is let me know... If you say Sher-e-Punjab then I will laugh at you with curry breath."], ["Joshua J.", "My favorite Indian buffet in Sacramento. I try to come when I am visiting family.

I was happy with the assortment of vegetarian dishes and he was happy with those and their meat dishes, but the nan was terrible. It was both dry and hard, rubbery and tough. We wondered if it suffered from being on a buffet rather than made fresh and brought to the table or if it was just bad. Between us we didn't even eat one piece.I know Indian desserts are sweet, but theirs were the sweetest I have ever had to the point of being cloying.When we first arrived, we sat and waited for what we considered too long before someone returned to ask for our order. Then, I was left without a refill for my empty water glass, which I would not have appreciated under any circumstances but especially since there was only one other table occupied and they were finished and left. It was a while before the place started getting busier.The service improved as time went on, but it was too little too late to leave me with a good impression.I've had better Indian food elsewhere that was also less expensive (not accounting for the coupon).

Use the carrot chutney to spice up the food if you're like me and like heat. I found the food wasn't spicy enough, but they pointed me to the carrot chutney and it gave me the kick I wanted and blended very well with any of their dishes. Don't skip the dessert. They have some round pastry thing that looks like a doughnut hole thay you put in rice pudding. I wasn't going to have any because it looked weird, but the owner brought it to me and I didn't want to be rude so I tried it, and boy am I glad I did. Yum!!!

Not anymore! I've never had a bad curry there, delicious naan and nice puffy poorhies, and a potato saabji that's true veggie bliss (as close as a certified carnivore can get to, anyway!) Plus, my husband raves about the lunch buffet.I *will* say this: we almost always get our food to go, because the service can be hit-and-miss. Sometimes it's great and they're very attentive.

In a nutshell this explains the Mother India experience. Everything seemed watered down in the interest of making a buck. The least you can do after serving someone a big styrofoam box of salty, soupy curry is offer them a drink. Yuck."], ["Jason P.", "Before you continue reading, I am by no means an expert in Indian food.I've been going to Sac State for three year and I've always passed this place with no particular interest toward trying it, even though I like curry in general. It wasn't till last semester I started eating there and now I consistently eat there.The service is generally pretty quick and the food isn't too bad.Their rice is a little dry to my taste, but then again, I'm really used to the stickier Japanese style rice. Though, I don't think it really matters since you end up with the curry all over the rice anyway. The rice does have onion which is has never been cooked in my times eating there. So if you have a problem with raw onion, which I don't, that may be a problem for you and you can just request that you don't get onion.The Chana Masala (Garbonzo Bean Curry) is pretty good. The curry is a little soupy, but it does have a bit of a kick to it.The Chicken Malai is a curry dish I always get. The chicken has probably soaked in the curry for a long time, which would explain why the meat falls apart really easily. Definitely my favorite dish there.The Chicken Tikka Masala is not to bad either with the tomato cream sauce and spices. Though they only have it on Wednesdays and Fridays in place of the goat curry. I've tried the Samosa platter once with the sweet sauce and that was also pretty good. Two samosa are crushed open with chana masala, vegetables, and either a spice or sweet sauce on top. I see a lot of people get their Chicken Vindaloo, which I guess is their spicy chicken curry. I haven't tried it yet since I'm a big sissy when it comes to spicy food.They also have some wraps and breakfast items too, but I have never tried them.The naan is probably my only real complaint since its never really consistently good - in fact, I don't think I really have had a decent piece of naan from Mother India. In most cases, it is chewy and needs some soaking in curry for it to be edible. It usually sits out on their counter with tin foil wrapped over it.Try it if you would like to, but I certainly understand if people are turned off by it since I know curry may look very unappetizing.

Never once did the waiter come to our table to even check on us and see how we were doing; if we wanted something, we literally had to track him down ourselves.We took a look at the buffet and the food seemed decent enough, so we all opted to eat from there, instead of ordering off the menu.

We were the only ones in the whole place and by the time we left there were two more groups (groups of two) and yet we received little to no service from anyone. In fact, the male who \"greeted\" us at the door acted as if he was too cool for work, walking around with one hand in his pocket and ear buds in both ears. He did not greet us when we walked in, didn't seat us, and didn't ask what we wanted to drink...We walked in, was asked how many was part of our group, and told to pick a table in the middle (everything was empty).This place advertises as an Indian, Chinese, and Thai establishment which is laughable. The only Chinese options were really dried up, nasty looking chow mein and chicken/corn soup (which I tried and didn't like at all). There was one Thai option and it was a Thai curry which did not taste like Thai curry at all. Everything else was an Indian option. Only about 3 or 4 vegetarian options, one of which is a white sauce pasta. Altogether there was about 15ish options, and not once did I see anyone bringing out new food--most likely my group was their first customers of the day.Food was meh, 2 star ratingPrice was great, 10.95/person, so that's a 4 star rating Service was terrible, as mentioned above, however at the end the gentleman who helped us pay was great--very good humor, friendly, and lovable. So overall, 3? starsVenue was very dimly lit but it didn't feel run down. The furniture reminded me of what a Chinese restaurant would use because in the back part they had round tables with the spinning top--lazy susans? The bathroom needed a little revamping, as mentioned in another review, one of the 2 stalls was locked due to repair and the only open one didn't have a lock! It was also the handicap stall so it's not very easy to tell if someone is in it. One of the faucets was broken and the other had a spider on it. So...2 stars"], ["Michael D.", "Ive been here a couple of times and the food is..how can i put this... Amazing!! I think i must have been indian in a past life because i truly enjoy the food and could eat it everyday(daal and naan) I really enjoy the buffet selection and the fresh Naan that they bring to your table is nice too. Youve got to try the chicken tikka..lamb/chicken curry..daal..matter of fact its all Good. I also really like the Kheer(dessert)..its a sweet rice pudding with raisins and nuts!! Great way to end the meal..kinda cools off all the spices from dinner! All in all..this is a Dont judge a book by its cover type of place..Outside is iffy and overlooked but once doors open and inside its a world of difference..it really feels like your in India eating amongst locals!! Cant forget to mention that service was Great!!"], ["Elizabeth T.", "I ordered lunch to go. The restaurant was a bit hard to find. They should change their sign out front because it's too hard to see what the name of the place is. Inside there was a lot of empty, dark space, which felt uncomfortable. I wouldn't want to dine in. There weren't many customers to speak of. There were bollywood songs playing on the tv, which was nice.The chicken tikka masala was pretty good, but the pad thai was not. It did not look or taste authentic. It was so unappetizing that I could not eat it, and it was the most expensive thing I ordered, unfortunately ($13). I think this restaurant would benefit by just focusing on Indian/Pakistani food. If the owners brighten this place up and stick to one cuisine, I think they would have a better business to offer its customers.

They also had some kind of okra dish too. the selection was all great. a little bit of vegetarian and chicken and fish and one curry goat dish as well. when i sat down i was excited to try it and then the chicken was so well done and over cooked by the steam table it wasn't good. the sauces were good tho. i didn't like any of the chicken or meats they had because they were either too dry or well done cooked. the only thing i liked was the chicken meatballs which i took without the sauce and scoop my favorite sauce they had was the tikka masala sauce they had to cover the chicken meat balls. the veggie fried rice which i really like because it was moist and the presentation looks colorful and it tasted good too. the chow mien was a bit too oily ski dint like that much. the red fish was eh nothing special and didn't like it. i like the salad of the day they had and i liked using the mint dressing they had which was great. i didn't like the can mixed fruit they had which didn't look appealing. the service was ehh ok because no one checked up on me until they remove plates. they just left a jar of ice water and they didn't even offer me mann tip i asked if the lunch buffet comes with it. i most likely won't come back because the food was ehh ok not bad not good. i think its because the meats were so well done and dry which i dint like. the only moist chicken meat balls was what i really liked. and the salad and the veggie fried rice. if those were the things i only like and spending like 13 bucks during a buffet doesn't seem like it is worth that price. so i most likely won't come back unless i order side dishes made fresh togo or dine in. but i do like the tikka masala tho. the place is great for a party and large groups because of the space and tables they had."], ["caleb d.", "DO NOT TIP i have just received confirmation from multiple sources that the nice waiters are to give all tips to the owners, the waiters don't see a penny of it. the owners feel the hourly rate is sufficient and that extras, including tips that customers give with the intention that 100% goes to the waiters, go into the owners pockets. someone i know used to be an employee an left because he said the owners were too greedy. \u00a0word of advice to the owners, if you want happy customers, hire and maintain happy employees. your high turnover rate suggests otherwise. food is pretty good and is halal. can't get over it, I'm shocked at the owners. it's stealing to pocket tips because we give, or gave, them with the intention that it goes to your employees."], ["Melissa P.", "Great food!

After about a 10min wait, I received my food.The garlic naan was ginormous, like the size of a personal pan pizza. But what's interesting is they used fresh raw garlic and stuffed it between the naan. *see my pix* The naan was aite, seemed thick compared to other naans but it was okChicken tikki masala was smoking temperature hot and spiciness level was only like a medium. I was expecting more heat cuz it's an Indian restaurant but I guess they didn't want to blow me away. Each bite of the curry dipped with the naan, you can taste all the different spices they used to create this dish. The chicken was super dry but maybe cuz they used chicken breast. Only negative I have to say about this dish is the amount of grease floating on the top and the remaining at the end. I have to agree with a fellow yelper on the grease and once I walked out of the restaurant, I was hocking out grease from the back of my throat for a good 2mins.Overall, I'd give this spot another try but order diff foods.

Worst excuse for Indian food ever....................\"Buddy why you kick my dog?\""], ["Jesus Q.", "Loved the most authentic Indian/Pakistani cuisine here. \u00a0My 10 year search is over. \u00a0The most succulent Murgh Tikka Lahori and Garlic Naan. \u00a0Extremely reasonably priced! \u00a0The chicken tikka masala was full of flavor Racing through my taste buds. \u00a0I'm coming back to try the Seekh Kabab Mughlai, mutton biryani, and Nihari on my next visit....can't wait."], ["Randy S.", "This was the worst service that me and my wife and my friends had they gave a Styrofoam cup no menu set there for 30 minutes and walked out I don't care if the food is good or service sucks"], ["Tracy T.", "I went with a friend and since he speaks the language, it made it the easier to communicate meaning customer service was good :) The food was great! And it came out fast! Would definitely go back next time."], ["Zaheer A.", "What a great authentic Pakistani restaurant !! A lifesize poster of shalimar baagh from Lahore graces the wall. The food was stupendous. Nihari , garam garam naan , chicken tikka masala and seekh kabab . Delicious !!!Once you go Pakistan , you never go Backistan !"], ["Sharina C.", "This is our favorite restaurant. The food is delicious and very aromatic. But if you expect someone welcome you and seat you right at the moment when you walk-in this place doesn't. I still remember the first time my husband and I walk in there, we stand there like 10 mins and finally there was a guy smiled at us and showed us where to go. This place is worth a try and you might fall in love with it like us :) ."], ["Randy S.", "BACK AGAINI can't say enough about this place. Consistent, awesome Indian food. It is hands down the best Indian cuisine in Sac.We are regulars here (at least 20 dimes) and have never had a bad meal or even a bad dish.We love this place."], ["Sara E.", "Price is the only reason Shalimar's not getting five stars from me. I guess I've been spoiled by the lunch deals at other Indian places in town. I think Diana T.'s review from 6/5/13 is spot on regarding the fact that this is a place for the well initiated into Indian food. The decor is minimal, with an open kitchen dominating the restaurant. There is no wait service per se, but your food is brought to you once your order. I had the GOAT KARAHI, PALAK PANEER, SHALIMAR CHAWAL and GARLIC NAAN on my first visit- a nice blend of Northern and Southern Indian...part of what makes Shalimar so special. I was doubly- delighted when the KARAHI tasted nearly exactly like the goat my friend's mom used to make. The garlic-stuffed NAAN was the size of a pizza and beyond delicious.Everything is ala carte- and no lunch specials- so it adds up quickly. However, portions are generous, flavors strong and I had two hearty meals from my order. The bottled sauces brought to the table- tamarind and mint- are very tasty and a nice way to change up the flavor of your meal.The \"wait staff\" was efficient and attentive, but a language barrier made it hard to gush over how much we were enjoying the food and the restaurant. \u00a0All in all, a delicious experience and I can't wait to go back and try more delicious items at Shalimar."], ["Raheel K.", "This place is great. I've been to the Bay Area locations on many occasions and was happy to see one open up in Sacramento. The food here is great. I especially love the Nihari and the kabobs. Sometimes the food can be a bit oily but overall it's really good. Definitely recommend this place."], ["Bob P.", "OOOoooooo this place definitely hit the spot! The menu is very easy to follow and the prices were very pocket friendly. \u00a0I wasn't all that impressed with my the flavor of my tikka masala but the garlic naan, and the chicken were fantastic. \u00a0The service was great too. \u00a0I don't usually dine on indian food, but I was really glad I found this gem!!!"], ["Leslie T.", "So glad that my Paki friends brought me here! I mean, I love paki food that I be having withdrawals sometimes! And boy am I glad, that I don't have to drive all the way to Berkeley to get some excellent Paki food!!!The food is really excellent quality, so no complaints in that department. The prices are pretty cheap compared to Indus Village in Berkeley (but maybe because it's Berkeley, that's why it's pricier?) So no complaints in price dept. as well.Only thing I would recommend for people, or I guess warning in this sense, is to watch out for their water! Taste like plastic and totally has the disgusting tap after taste."], ["Ophelia F.", "Damn this place is great. \u00a0If you can mentally get past the delicious, sinful grease that sits on top of the best tasting dishes here, you're really in for a treat. \u00a0The vegetarian selections are plentiful and that makes me very, very happy. \u00a0The garlic naan is to die for and my personal favorite dish is the Paneer Masala. \u00a0I've never had a bad experience with the customer service here, and personally, I've found this place to be quite clean. \u00a0A must-try for Indian food enthusiasts."], ["Les d.", "Weeehehehehehehe! I frequented their Santa Clara location every time I was in the South Bay and I was so happy when I found this location. It's a hole in a wall kinda place, nothing fancy and please don't expect it to be. It is all about the food and... it is good!The portions were small compared to the other location but cheaper as well.Ordering is a little confusing, you order at the counter, they bring out your food to you and once done, you go up to the counter again to pay.We ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, chicken kebab, a vegetable dish with spinach and cheese, an order of basmati rice and a naan for the 2 of us. We were stuffed, satisfied \u00a0and nearing a food coma at the end.The Chicken Tikka Masala was tangy and buttery, as for the oil complaint, I think they've fixed that. They were spooning out the oil from the pots of curry they were cooking. So at least I know they've read the reviews.The Spinach and Cheese dish was best with the naan and the kebab was the most flavorful kebab we've had. The kebab alone would be worth the drive and wait.We came in during dinner time around 5:30 or so and the open kitchen was busy!! There were trays and bags of to go orders on the counter even though the restaurant was not busy at all. So be here early for dinner because the to go orders were for large parties and the kitchen was backed up.We spent around $25, includes 2 bottled water and my friend liked the food so much she bought some to go for her picky wife who is a chef."], ["Lina H.", "I got take-out from here a few days ago so I can't comment on the dine in experience. I ordered the chicken tikki masala, palak paneer, naan and rice. As the other reviews said, the naan was a huge pizza-sized sheet! Another review mentioned how they give you a heaping portion of rice but the to-go container was kinda tiny - enough for 1-2 people if there's also naan. I placed my order over the phone and it was ready in 10 mins. I got there, paid, and took my food home. Once I got home, I realized that they mixed up my order of palak paneer and gave me paneer masala instead. I called the restaurant again, and the man I talked to (can't remember his name) was super nice and told me to come back anytime and mention my name and they would give me an order for free! I went back right after and sure enough, there it was waiting on the counter for me! All of the dishes were very very flavorful with huge amounts of spice! I did notice that after sitting in the fridge overnight, a layer of oil formed over all of them which made it seem less appetizing...but overall, very great, authentic food!"], ["Cheryl B.", "Mu dining companion is very pick when it comes to Indian food and has yet to find on he likes in the Sacramento area. \u00a0I though we would go as we were in that area of town and it has gotten good reviews. \u00a0This is a order at the counter they will bring it to you kind of place. \u00a0Not fancy but reasonably price and quick. \u00a0there were only a few people inside when we came in but they did a booming take out business and most of the customers for take out and dine in were from that area of the world which is always a good sign. \u00a0 \u00a0We ordered PANEER MASALA, PALAK ALOO METHI , nan, and mango Lassi to drink. \u00a0The food was made fresh and was very hot. \u00a0it got a thumbs up from my picky friend and we had food left over. \u00a0They great think was it cost us $23 with TAX for the whole meal!!! \u00a0 We will come again."]], "East West Junction": [["Cind Y.", "Note: My review is only based on my one-time visit there to order chicken tikka masala. The chicken tikka masala was the worst I've ever had. The curry tasted funny and it was very watered down to the point the curry was runny, like water."], ["J. W.", "Love their buffet. \u00a0It is small but potent. \u00a0The last time I was there they served a savory vegetable dish of potato and eggplant that was one of the most delicious recipes I have ever eaten. \u00a0Wish I could make that at home. \u00a0I don't know about the goat being \"sublime.\" \u00a0I seem to recollect eating a more delicious goat in NYC. \u00a0But that goat was Ethiopian though, so... \u00a0Anyway, I have been totally satisfied with every dish I have had so far at East West Junction and heartily recommend it to others who are not scared of South Sac."], ["Raees K.", "Quality food at a low price! Spicy cheese burgers and fried chicken keep me coming here all the way from the 510 Bay Area"], ["Angelica A.", "One day in my speech class I was craving curry chicken. I was recommend to come here by a class mate of mine. This place overall tasted alright. \u00a0I wish I could have \u00a0gone here when it was buffet hour so I would make my money worth. \u00a0Tell you one thing about this place for some odd reason it was connected to a grocery store so I might been confuse which was the restaurant so I kept looking \"left\" and \"right\" and realize the left side was the restaurant and the right side was the grocery store."], ["Ms. O.", "Best halal burger. Full Stop. \u00a0You may want to call ahead, they can get busy, and it can get hot waiting in the cramped space."], ["Missy M.", "No Lassi, NO Samosa! However it was Sunday night. They did have VERY good Naan, cooked the authentic way (in a brick oven thing). The food was pretty good, but it was a little far and you gotta know what to get. i called in my order and picked it up. Still looking for a great Indian food place.. the search continues."], ["Shelby S.", "This place is delicious! I stuffed myself with a veggie meal here for 7 dollars. Such a good deal for 2 kinds of curries, salad, naan (with a few different dipping sauces) and a soda! The people who work here are really friendly and talked us through each of the items. They have a great little market connected to it as well. Can't wait to be back!"], ["Minha J.", "East West Foods has been around for a long time, and has a very loyal customer base for a good reason - they have everything you need, and provide it in the best way. \u00a0They have a great selection of ethnic grocery and halal meat. \u00a0 And, my favorite part, FANTASTIC burgers and nan kabobs. \u00a0My family and I have thrived off those burgers, and I guarantee that you will too."], ["Koala E.", "alright. kinda not my thing, but ok."]], "Cottage Mart": []}
