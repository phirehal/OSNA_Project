I have never eaten so much pizza in my life since then (almost a year ago). \u00a0I am practically pizza now since we end up visiting Chicago Fire almost every Friday! \u00a0The service isn't the \"best\" - we usually wait about 5 mins for a server to take our drink orders and we have been charged incorrectly for our orders, BUT they are all very friendly and we have our favorites! Oh and I've had to get up and get napkins as my request was usually forgotten but I don't mind making things happen ;)Our go-to is a medium pepperoni & pineapple deep dish pizza. \u00a0It never comes out the same as before, but it never disappoints. \u00a0The crust is buttery and the proportions between pineapple and pep are pretty good. \u00a0I would say they are overgenerous with the cheese though!My tips: call ahead if you're ordering a deep dish as they take about 45mins to cook. \u00a0do not order your pizza to go (ours was cold and not the same quality as dine-in). \u00a0I took away a star because, after frequenting this place so often, it wasn't until my last to-go order did someone mention their \"Chicago Fire Square Card\" where you earn points for every $ spent (goes towards future free pizza) and receive free deep dish delight on your birthday.

I believe it all to be raw garlic. We ordered a thin crust pepperoni pizza for the kids and it was the best out of everything we ordered. And it wasn't \u00a0that fantastic. I definitely could have gone elsewhere for something basic. We also ordered a deep dish half Greek half buffalo chicken. The topping were great but the pizza dough was horrible. It was like an undercooked salt-less frozen pre-made pie crust that you get at the grocery store. Lastly, the service...Oh the service. We literally had to ask for refills every time. (We were there for two hours mind you) Why were we there for two hours? Well it took 1hr and 20 minutes to get our pizza. We waited. And waited while our waitress told us that it would be out shortly two/three times. While we waited, tables were seated, ordered and got their deep dish pizza, and left ALL before us. And I'm talking about at least five tables that were sat after we had gotten seated (and we had a reservation )I will not be making the trip again. I feel like we over tipped the waitress and should have tipped the busser because he was constantly checking on us. He was the best. Icing on the cake, putting other people drinks on our tab.

Both halves were extremely salty and not deep enough to even joke about calling it a deep dish pizza. Even the Greek fries were disappointing.. such thin fries.. if I wanted shoestring fries I would have gone to a burger joint.

Everything else just tasted bad simply because they're items not suitable for takeout. \u00a0This I do admit was my fault. \u00a0Therefore, I will definitely be back to give their spacious dining area, multiple TV's and fun ambiance a try and hopefully, this time, it won't come with a fatty ticket!"], ["Kristel V.", "I've been here many times and have always loved their pizza!

Tonight's experience has changed my perception of this restaurant. I came with my wife, son( 3 years old) and my in-laws and arrived around 6 when we were told it would be 35 minutes. After 10 minutes we put in the order for our pizza so it would be ready shortly after we sat. After 45 minutes we checked in and was told it would be another 15 minutes. When seated after an hour we told our waiter we had pre-ordered a pizza and ordered a couple appetizers. \u00a030 minutes later the waiter pulled me aside, asking which pizza I had ordered. Because I am not a moron I asked if this meant our pizza order was never put in, and he assured me that was not the case and he just wanted to make sure he grabbed the correct pizza when it came out of the oven. 15 minutes later the manager came by and apologized for the delay and offered us an appetizer. We requested the Greek fries for my 3 year old son as it had already been a long time for him to sit quietly. The \"appetizer\" came 10 minutes later which was just some fries tossed on a plate (not the Greek fries a paying customer would receive). When the manager came back to check on us, we asked how much longer for our pizza to which he replied \"27 minutes\". This confirmed my original assumption that our order was never put in my the hostess. I pulled the manager aside and explained our experience this far and my concern about our 3 years old ability to behave for much longer. \u00a0He replied that he would \"see what he could do\" and I assumed at this point our meal would be comped. \u00a0When he returned I was provided a $20 gift card for my next visit. My mother in law asked if there was anything else he would do to compensate us for our experience to which he replied \"I think with the free appetizer and the gift card I've done enough\" (reminder: the appetizer was just some fries on a plate). He would not be seen again for the rest of the night. By the end of the night we spent almost 3 hours here with a small child and were unhappy with our service from the hostess to our server (no I promise we didn't forget to put your order in) to the manger who told my mother in law he had done enough. \u00a0When the pizza finally came my son was overdue to be in bed and we each quickly ate one piece and took the rest home.

I have yet to sit down and eat at the restaurant itself. Yes, I know, that's tragic and I hope that predicament is rectified soon. But I digress...I've made it a personal quest to try as many chicken wings as possible as recommended by good pal and fellow Elite Yelper Carol P. To that end, I was downtown getting the chariot washed at Harv's (using the last of my 3-punch card), when I had the hankering for wings. So, I went to the internet and put out a simple plea...what's close to Harv's where I can get some yummy wings? Naturally, Carol flew to my rescue and recommended Chicago Fire or Coriander (both of which have excellent reviews from Carol for their wing awesomeness, and I trust her implicitly). Since it was Sunday, Coriander was closed, so Chicago Fire won out on default, not that it was bad thing. I called in and placed my order to go. After swinging quickly by Suzie Burger to pick up one of their AMAZING chocolate shakes to go, I headed over to pick up my order of 10 mild garlic wings.Oh, I have to say when I called in my order, I spoke with Alex, who helped make sure I got the mildest wings possible (I'm a complete wuss when it comes to heat) but kicked up with garlic. I love garlic chicken wings. When I arrived, I went back to the Take Out counter and picked up my 10-pack of wings ($10.80 with tax). Let's just say the drive home was torture, because my car smelled of heavenly garlic chicken wings and I couldn't eat any yet!When I got home, I tore into those suckers, and they were finger-lickin' good! Sooo yummy! Can't wait to try them again...next time though, I want to eat them at the restaurant so they're nice and crispy (bad thing about taking them home is that the crispy skin gets a tad soft being in the to-go container for 10 minutes).

When I brought it my servers attention she asked my friends with the same dish to dig through their dish and see if any of there's had no chicken. One of the girls had the dish with no chicken but had already began eating it. I traded dishes with my friend anyways because I was starving. After eating a couple bites I BIT INTO CHICKEN. I haven't had a bite of meat in over 5 years! Horrified that I just done something unethical in my eyes I called the server back over and she took the dish from me and told me it be comped. A different worker came over and offered me a free salad. I took the salad to go because by this time everyone at the table was done eating. When I came home to eat my salad there was HAIR IN IT!

We win about 5 minutes before we were seated and not in the bar area. We decided to order a large thin crust, pizza along with 20 piece wings which were mild spicy. And we also ordered a deep dish garlic bread that came with olive oil and balsamic vinegar and garlic which was the best dipping sauce for the bread I ever tasted. I was having a major foodgasm as I was dipping for each bite lol. The pizza was really thin and the cheese and the toppings keep on falling off. Basically I was eating the crust alone and the cheese on another bite along with the toppings. I prefer the deep dish but the wait for the pizza is a little bit longer than the thin crust. The 20 piece wing was okay because it wasn't spicy and it kind of lack of flavor. I think that Buffalo Wild Wings serve better wings. I also got a 22 ounce of Chicago Fire blonde ale for only 6 bucks which I thought was very reasonable and plus it was on tap. The server was very nice and checked up on us a few times and refill our waters and drinks frequently. The server also cleared our plates that was in our way and also handed the bill to us without us requesting it. We all had a great time and enjoyed the environment. We all thought that inside the restaurant was a bit loud so it's kind of hard to hear each other when the table is like a long table in a rectangle shape.

Anyways, we finally got into the restaurant and we were pleasantly surprised by the intimate setting. Our server was always courteous and after she came by with our drinks, she always refilled our drinks full of water. She made sure that we were doing well the entire time and even after we were handed off to another server, the next server was just as nice. The pizza we ordered was 1/2 chicken pesto and 1/2 Greek.

Parking alone took 15 minutes, and when I went inside to get my pizza, there was 5 people in front of me waiting. When I finally got my pizza home, the same problem happened.

We arrived early to do some wine tasting since we read that it was free, let me tell you they have some good wines! And don't skip the sherry, we bought a bottle of it because it tastes like chocolate, yum! Just as a side note, it's cheaper to buy a bottle in here then to get the same bottle at the restaurant. I recommend doing the tasting like we did, before dinner. Don't have any with dinner, and then buy what you like afterwards. Cheaper that way!The place itself gave off a very italian feel from the outside, sooo cute! And when you go into the restaurant it's very cool! The dining room is situated in an old winery so that you can see all the massive old wine barrels. One holds up to 15k gallons of wine!Dinner was delicious, the only issue was with my clam linguini. I've never had clams before, so maybe this is just how clams are, but I had to be very careful while eating because the outside of the clams was flaking off, and it was very hard, I was afraid I was going to break a tooth! So I had to eat the meal as if I was watching for fish bones, very gently. My husband had the chicken ravioli and really liked it.We got the baileys chocolate mousse to go. Apparently they serve these in wine glasses, so we got two free wine glasses with the purchase, lol! But we missed out on the whipped cream and chocolate flakes that they were supposed to put on it. Oh well, not a huge deal, they were still delicious.Service was good, we didn't have any issues that I can think of.

I wanted to try the only remaining Italian restaurant (excluding chains...) \u00a0in the Elk Grove, South Sacramento area... without venturing into downtown SacramentoI didn't know there was an Italian restaurant out here! This was one of my commute routes when I worked in East Sacramento... long ago.On the menu...Bread & Butter (*** Complimentary) Small, sliced (and room temp) \u00a0French Bread Loaf, with wrapped Pats of Butter. I appreciated the endless supply of French Bread versus the negativity of some Yelpers over the the fact that the Bread came out Cold. ... Really didn't mind it all that much myself...Caesar Salad (*** 1/2 $6.50) Romaine Lettuce with Creamy Caesar dressing topped with (a whole lot of) slivers of Parmesan Cheese with Garlic Croutons.Specialty of the House - GRANDMA Rose's Pot Roast (*** 1/2 $12.95) Slow-Roasted tender cuts of Beef topped with a Port Demi-Glaze and served over Spaghetti with their family Meat Sauce.Very, very tender Pot Roast cuts that were 4\" x 1\" in size... served atop their Spaghetti with a Marinara Meat Sauce.... Big Mistake! The Hamburger in the Meat Sauce did NOT go well with the Pot Roast... NOT AT ALL! Recommendation to Frasinetti's... just use a plain Marinara in this Entree. Beef is Beef... but you have slow-cooked Pot Roast that just tastes very odd with... Hamburger. And despite the fact that the Meat Marinara was overly Sweet, I did like some parts of the Marinara Sauce - large slices of Tomato, Onion and Mushrooms... if it weren't for the Hamburger...Iced Tea (**** $2.50) Innumerable Refills... tasted pretty good... or was the long Bike Ride and the need for hydration influencing me.LemonCello Digestif (**** 1/2 $6.00) Served very chilled... as it should have been! Very reasonable pricing on Drinks.Lemoncello is now my standard after-dinner Drink when doing Italian... maybe I should just go to BevMo and buy a bottle...Ambiance (****) Who wouldn't like the ambiance at Frasinetti's? This area of Sacramento probably was considered Rural decades ago, now Frasinetti's (including the Vineyard) is surrounded by the burbs with commuter traffic on Florin Road zooming hither and fro at quite a distance from the dining establishment.Atmosphere is historical, dark, cool, but not dank... and even, I daresay, Romantic? Crimson table-cloth tables, Redwood Wine Vats, and there are black & white pictures of generations past of family delivering Wine in horse-drawn carriages... Wow! The Redwood Wine Vats loom over you while you eat. 60s Jazz is piped in during your dining experience... too loud, though. Turn the volume down... especially with the Concrete Floors and hard surfaces that typify a storage facility... Frank, Dean or Al would be more appropriate at Frasinetti's as background music...For whatever reason, though... not many of the fairer sex at Lunch yesterday. Majority of patrons were male Businessmen and unsuited executive types or small business owners.The lower-ranked Wait-Person was pretty friendly... I told him that my favorite Italian was Palermo Ristorante in Elk Grove. At the end of my meal he asked me how I liked the entree... you can be frank. Well... just so-so... I recommended that he take himself and his wife to Palermo...In summary... Frasinetti's retains too many qualities from their catering of large events which is really a negative at a family fine-dining restaurant. Service is brusque and quick... not at all friendly or conversant... maybe not enough Wait-Staff? Just too many Event-type qualities from Wait-Staff at this restaurant. And preparation of the Entrees seems like cooking by rote... I really doubt that this menu has changed... for decades (or more)."], ["A L.", "I had been here a few years ago and I had remembered the food being very good.

No one ever filled our glasses of water and when we were ready to go, there was no one to be found.

Even cheaper than the Arboretum in Davis, which... I dunno, seems kind of odd to me considering Davis doesn't provide its own caterer and/or alcohol; you have to battle it out with the wiccans for the Gazebo; and the reception site is similar to a classroom. You have it all at Frasinetti's: Food and drink; ceremony and reception site; and quite possibly the most good-natured, friendly and accomodating coordinator (Howard) that I have ever come across. You wouldn't think it on the drive out there, but it's a gorgeous little oasis tucked in a pretty industrial area. In fact, it's got a train track right next to the reception hall, but I'll be honest - I didn't once notice the train once it got close to ceremony time until I watched the video later.In the months leading up to the wedding, I spent a lot of time in the restaurant and wine tasting room and it was always a pleasant experience. Especially when Howard comes around to your table and spends some time with you, ensuring that you're having a great time, that you don't need anything, and regaling you with background stories that accompany each of the family pictures on the walls. My absolute favorite meal is the risotto encrusted salmon. My favorite wine - the Frasinetti Cab. Deee-lish!I told Howard that night and I'll repeat it here: Our wedding day was flawless and perfect and I couldn't have asked for anything more. We owe a large part of that to Howard Frasinetti."], ["Trish H.", "The whole staff at Fransinettis winery and Restaurant were over the top in helping me with a function for 30 people this last week...

After cleaning up the water, he made up for it with a complimentary bottle of chianti. Have to admit, I've visited on occasion just to taste the wine, browse the tasting room, and stock up on wine. \u00a0While most of their wines are decent, surprisingly it is their chianti that stands out for me. The chianti has served me well in entertaining a wide range of guests.

Bottomless salad, appetizers, entrees, & dessert until you're full !!For appetizers we chose the stuffed mushrooms and calamari frittes. The texture of the calamari was nice and soft. The mushrooms on the other hand, was just ok. It needed more flavor.Chicken and shrimp pastaWasn't a big fan of this dish even though I love pasta with the white cream sauce. The sauce on here was just too watery. Chicken marsalaCame with mushrooms and this was pretty good. The chicken was not dry at all and it was really moist. It was good. Baked zitiThis dish was really good and flavorful. One of my favorites. I really loved the Italian sausages that it came with. Lasagna I really enjoyed this dish as well. It was really good and I loved the flavor. TiramisuThis is the best tiramisu I had. It was delicious and moist and it didn't have a strong coffee taste to it.

I did make reservations via Open Table.When we first walked in, the pleasant hostess smiled and said welcome to Maggiano's! \u00a0My HB mentioned we had reservations and she instantly took us to our table. I had heard they had been at this location for six months now.My HB already knew what he wanted to eat but I was wavering a bit of course for those who know me; it's hard for me to make up my mind! \u00a0We had planned to order Marco's Meal for two that was priced at 39.95. We chose the Chicken & Peppers appetizer, Lite Chicken asparagus Fettuccini, Taylor Street Baked Ziti and mini dessert sampler that was an extra 5.00. I got pretty full by the time I was eating my main dish that practically everything was boxed up to go. \u00a0Our waitress was really on point although she got really busy so I can see that restaurant get really cray as the deal we had was order our main entrees and take one entree each home! We ended up with two large bags to take home with us but that worked out as we had dinner covered for sure. I also got a 10 dollars off if you sign up with their restaurant. \u00a0It really is worth the deal. \u00a0Don't wait. You snooze, you will lose!I forgot to mention the decor and ambience of the restaurant is upscale although we did come in jeans but I wouldn't do that for dinner. \u00a0Their background music was Frank Sinatra; reminded me of the good old days:))) \u00a0It's so nice they are located at Arden Fair Mall where you don't have to worry about paying for parking and their bathrooms are well, you tell me when you get there!

I had to divide my main course (a terrific \"lighter take\" baked zitti) because I wanted to have room for dessert. - Dessert was a sinfully good apple crostada with ice cream and caramel sauce.- To top it off, I was sent home with another full serving (really enough for two) of a pasta of my choice.My only regret...not having come here sooner!"], ["Doug G.", "I am happy we finally have a Maggiano's Little Italy in Sacramento.

Nice wine list and atmosphere."], ["Tricia F.", "The first time we experienced Maggiano's Little Italy was in Cincinnati, Ohio ~ we've been a fan ever since. We recently moved to Sacramento and, to our delight, there is a Maggiano's restaurant very close to us! I was so hungry for their half moon lemon cookies ~ melt in your mouth lemon cookies. So, at the end of our meal, I ordered a tin (like we usually have at other Maggiano restaurants) of these delightful cookies. When our waitress returned with a foil pan telling me those were our cookies, I was very taken back. Where is the beautiful lemon cookie tin? She had no idea what I was talking about. WELL, I wish I would have opened the foil pan BEFORE leaving the restaurant because I would have said, \"No thank you!\". These are not the same moon shape lemon cookies that my taste buds were craving. They were small little rectangular cookies. Say what?!! Maggiano's, what have you done??!! SO disappointed.Now that I have my lemon cookie disappointment out of the way...we'll move on to our meal. The hubster and I decided to have Marco's Meal For Two. For an appetizer, we ordered the Crispy Zucchini Fritt\u00e9 with lemon aiolo sauce. These delicious strips of zucchini are breaded in panko crumbs that give them a wonderful \"crunch\" when you bite into them. We would definitely order these little gems again.I ordered the Four Cheese Ravioli with Pesto Alfredo Sauce for my dinner. Not being sure of the pesto alfredo sauce, I asked for a sample. We had a great waitress and she brought me the sample pretty quickly. I was pleasantly surprised! As for the ravioli, I wasn't impressed. The hubster ordered the Lighter Take Baked Ziti. Along with the dinner for two, we had a choice to take two pasta dishes home so I chose the Lighter Take Fettuccine Alfredo and he chose Mushroom Ravioli al Forno. We had the later dishes today. The hubsters remark: \"I enjoyed the baked ziti more than this dish.\" I was done after just a few bites of the fettuccine because the pasta was way overdone and the sauce, albeit a lighter sauce, was tasteless. Sigh. We canned the remaining into file 13.For dessert we chose the Warm Apple Crostada with vanilla bean ice cream and carmel sauce. The first few bites were not bad, but when we dug deeper into this apple dessert we quickly discovered it wasn't completely baked. In fact, it was very doughy. We requested another fully baked Apple Crostada to go. After baking it in a 400\u00ba oven (here at home) for 20 minutes we were delighted to finish every bite.To quench my thirst, I decided to give their special Lemonade, cucumber, lemon and club soda drink a try. The first several sips are not to bad ~ but when the ice melts all the pizzaz of this drink goes right down the drain. There are free refills IF you can get your waitress to stop by your table. Needless to say, I had my second drink brought to the table with a to-go cup (not by request, but because it took that long to get it and we already paid the bill!).Maggiano's you let us down. Not only in the Lemon Cookie department, but your pasta was way over cooked and your sauces tasteless."], ["Josh D.", "This restaurant is not my kind of place.

I expected better service but I'm pretty picky when it comes to customer service.

Stepping into the restaurant was like walking into another realm because it went from a sunny and loud outdoor environment to a very relaxing setting with dim lights.

On Sunday, they serve dinner all day so the portions are huge so make sure you know what you are getting into. They also have a menu where you order an entree for dine in and they give you an entree to go! OMG! Overall, our meal was delicious and our server (Patrick?) was very amazing. He was very personable. He gave really good advice for what to order. He also got me a side of garlic bread. It is not typically a side you can order. I love garlic bread!

On the 1st of January, hubby and I were at the mall shopping for new clothes when we got hungry. It was only 11:30 am and we were debating between Seasons 52 or here. We decided to try Maggiano's because we have not dined there before and it was a fantastic experience!! Jessica was extremely sweet. She gave us a run down of the menu and they were having a special where if we ordered off the \"classic\" part of the menu, we would get a second entree to take home, complimentary of the chef! WTF?! Lol There was another special. They have the 2 for $40 deal. You get an appetizer, 4 entrees (2 to dine in and 2 to take home) and 1 dessert. WHAT A GREAT DEAL!! I ordered the ravioli and decided to take the 2nd entree (4 cheese ravioli) to take home. My husband ordered two different type of pastas. We had the zucchini fritters as appetizer. It was DELICIOUS and the portions were huge! They were not skimping out just because of the special. We both enjoyed our food thoroughly and did not leave room for dessert. Jessica wrapped our cheesecake to go for us. Our bill was only ~$45 after tax!! For all this great food!!!! I couldn't believe it. We had our second entrees and dessert for dinner last night and it tasted great!Special thanks to Jessica. We were her first customers for 2015 and she was our first \"dining experience\" of 2015; she made it marvelous for us. It was one of the best customer service experience we have had.

It was myself, son and my boyfriend. The funny thing was we were at Olive Garden waiting for about half an hour until my little brother mentioned for us to come here instead. I was like oh yeah so we gave them back their timer and headed here. I'm glad we left OG because the atmosphere here is more of a home feeling. It reminds me of Brooklyn New York. Very Sapprano like lol. It was like a little scence from a movie. Our waitress was very friendly she came and gave us time to order and she told us about the specials. My boyfriend and I had the dinner for two. My son had the shrimp alfredo. We started off with mussels. It came out piping warm lemony and buttery just the way I like it. The portion was huge. It was enough for four person. The good thing was they gave us an extra plate to toss our mussel shells in. The little baguette bread it came with was buttery, crunchy and delish too. I dipped it in the mussel broth. It was so yummy. For our entree we did the upgrade of two dollars for the premium plates. I had the mushroom raviolis. It came out on a piping hot plate and the raviolis were fresh and warm. It had a white cream sauce on the bottom. The mushrooms we're delicious. My boyfriend order the Lasagna. It also came out piping hot. The portions was huge too. It's not your average size lasagna. It was enough for at least a few people. My son's shrimp alfredo was cooked to perfection. The pasta was al dente just how it should be. The alfredo sauce was nice and creamy and not dry at all. The shrimp that came with it wasn't your average shrimp they were more like tiger prawn size. The portion was more then enough for the three of us to share. The great thing about Maggianos is they give you a complimentary take home entree of your choice. It's prepackaged, but I didn't mind. The downside was: We told them we wanted baked ziti, lasagna, and my son wanted spaghetti and meatballs for the complimentary take home entree and the waitress messed up on that part. She gave us baked ziti, rigatoni, and spaghetti with ground sausage meat sauce. My son was a little disappointed the next day because we had it for our lunch. He was looking forward to the meatballs. My boyfriend was looking forward to lasagna but they gave him rigatoni. The only order they got right was the ziti. For dessert we had the tiramisu because we had a choice of dessert also with our dinner for two. The dessert was rich and decadent. One of the best tiramisu I've had. My son loved the dessert he devoured it. So above all this is a great place to come dine at. Very family friendly. Great for large groups. Seats over 260 people dining area. After coming here I don't know if I'll go back to Olive Garden again. The prices are about the same but taste much more homemade and bigger family portion sharing style which I like.

The baked ziti was delicious and I only managed to eat half, so I was seriously able to squeeze multiple meals out of my $12.95! SCOREEEE!The take home option comes pre-packaged and appeared to be frozen. There's a label on the front that leads you to a website about how to bake or heat up your pasta.I also got to try my friend's lighter version of the Fettuccine Alfredo. The serving size seemed a bit smaller as he gobbled it up within minutes, but it was seriously one of the best tasting alfredos I have ever tried.We ended the night with the $12 dessert sampler that is *supposed* to come with 5 different mini versions of their best desserts. (Most desserts were around $7.95 if ordered alone.) They unfortunately were out of their mini cheesecakes, so Dana offered to replace it with another tiramisu and threw in an order of their lemon cookies. Seriously... BLOWN AWAY by the service! The desserts were delicious by the way, but way too much for just two people to share.Dana ended up bringing us an assortment of to-go containers to choose from so we could pack up our leftover desserts the way we wanted to.I think I just found my new favorite place to eat at if I get hungry after shopping at the mall."]], "Piatti": [["Freddie L.", "My family and I use to come here all the time when I was in high school, which was about a hundred years ago.

As I was heading to that restaurant on October 1st, 2015, I sat on the bartender side for a quick dining rest during the dinner peek hours. The atmosphere is quite relaxing and comfortable inside including their outdoor patio too. The concept is quite good showing a great view of Fair Oaks Blvd as well as their kitchen to show the chefs are cooking the customer's entrees and pizzas.The employees from hosts, bartenders, chefs, and servers have done a fantastic job for making the customers very friendly. No cons at all!For the entree, I ordered a sausage and peppers (sliced jalapeno and green chilies) pizza. As I take a bite of one slice of pizza, it tasted very good! The pizza baked well as I looked it. The sausage, mozzarella cheese, and peppers worked that pizza a huge top notch! Not a bad complete dinner meal!The parking can be confusing here which it's located at the Pavilions strip mall. Try to park closer to the restaurant near Talbots, so you can walk there easier. Otherwise, you can ride a bike, walk, or use public transportation to go to that destination in no time.In the end, Piatti is the finest, and remarkable national Italian restaurant that I've ever visited and dined there for the first time.

The same way a score for a movie can set the mood for the entire film, the music at Piatti's set the mood for the meal. It was a soft, ambient tone that gently rings in your ear, like subliminal messages telling you to enjoy your meal. Of course the look and the sound is only 2/4 of what makes Piattis awesome. No great restaurant would be truly great unless the food was on the same level or higher than everything else. A basket of bread was dropped off at the table. Because this is an Italian Ristorante instead of butter we get a small plate with a small metal cup that when lifted pools out the hidden balsamic vinaigrette. The sprinkle of herbs takes the mix a step above normal the normal balsamic vinaigrette. The bread was fresh and hot. Let me take a minute to stop salivating over the memories of bread and let's move on. In a quest to eat a little bit healthier, I ordered a small Caeser salad. No explosive comments about it because in all actuality it is just a Caeser salad. But it is one of the better ones I've eaten. The dressing was good and enough to evenly coat everything without drowning it. I especially loved the big pieces of shaved fresh Parmesan.I was able to also sample the Burrata appetizer. It consisted of Burrata cheese, with slices of grilled white peach and prosciutto on toasted/grilled bread. The cheese was creamy and easily spreadable over the grilled bread. Since it's very similar to goat cheese I became an instant fan. The prosciutto and the grilled peach were definitely my favorite parts of the app. The peach brought an amazing sweetness to a very savory dish, and the prosciutto added much of that savory element.The main attraction tonight was the Cast Iron Salmon. The waitress informed me that the chef likes to cook the salmon medium rare. A nice thick salmon filet with crispy skin and moist insides. It was cooked as described and tasted phenomenal. The dish also featured a white polenta cake that was easily my favorite part of the dish (Sorry Mr. Salmon) and a spring vegetable salad. The salad brought a light and fresh element to the meal. Not to mention it was also quite tasty. A ring of fava and pea shoot salsa verde circled everything. It tasted good; I just wish I had more of it. I was able to try the Spaghetti with Pork and Ricotta meatballs and I'm just going to say it. It was very reminiscent of Spaghetti O's with meatballs to me. I was really unimpressed and disappointed since it was one of the best sounding items on the menu. The service was both OK and great. Our main server knew the menu and the specials, but she was very monotone when speaking \u00a0to us. It kind of took away some of our excitement about the place. There was another waiter who helped out who was much livelier and seemed happy to be there. He brought a great vibe with him that was easily spread around. Aside from the one dish, the one server, and the fact that their website needs a major update I had a fantastic time eating at Piatti's."], ["Suzy H.", "What? \u00a0Two lunches at Piatti's in one week! \u00a0Yes...I think Piatti's is back!!! \u00a0Met long-time BF in her \"neck of the woods\"! \u00a0She had chosen Piatti's for lunch and since it was her \"pick\" I reluctantly agreed. \u00a0Only because Piatti's had not been on my radar for years for a place I'd go for good food (sorry, Piatti's!). \u00a0Well things have changed at Piatti's. \u00a0Two excellent lunches with superb service both times.The thing that never changes at Piatti's is the beauty of the restaurant. \u00a0It is set in an older but quaint shopping area (Pavilions) with an open, high ceiling, and lots of glass, rooms. \u00a0Inside seating (nice bar area too), seating in a glass room looking out at the patio and outside seating in the patio! \u00a0What's not to like about having three different choices to sit while one dines? \u00a0There is also a small, intimate, dining area for having a private gathering (i.e., wedding shower, baby shower, birthday dinner) with family/friends. \u00a0I have actually attended two separate functions in that room many years ago. \u00a0One in the day time for a friend's baby shower and one at night for a friend's birthday party. \u00a0Very nice atmosphere for both!Lunch #1Before meeting BF, I perused the, what else...latest \u00a0Yelp reviews about the food at Piatti's and had decided I wanted the caprese salad with grilled prawns (thank you, fellow Yelper)! \u00a0It was one of those very hot days and this sounded perfect. \u00a0And I was surprised by all the high ratings given to Piatti's by the most current Yelp reviewers. \u00a0Long story short...my salad/prawns were perfect! \u00a0And, the warm, \"baguette\" sliced bread, was wonderful. \u00a0Had one piece but could have eaten the whole basket. \u00a0That coupled with a nice sauvignon blanc...heaven! \u00a0Service: \u00a0Excellent!

As far as the food goes, all tasted well and greatly appreciate the support of local farms. \u00a0I order the small portion and felt it was just right. \u00a0However, my friend order the larger portion and to tell you the truth, didn't seem any different. My pork and ricotta meatball spaghetti was good. \u00a0Nothing too fancy but the small portion for someone like me was just right. \u00a0I would say a bit pricey for the size. \u00a0The ginger julep was also a nice refreshing, non-alcoholic beverage. \u00a0To me, it tasted like a mint julep without the alcohol...I think I was looking for more ginger flavor. \u00a0The best part about the meal was the olive cake! \u00a0When you read it...it is questionable...but let me tell you! \u00a0It's simple and light and hits just the right spot! \u00a0There is a hint of the olive oil but it just blends in very well.

Did everyone cancel or..... what happened to the full list of reservations? \u00a0I would have liked an earlier dinner, :(.We started off with an appetizer, the carpaccio. My favorite of all during my time spent at Piattis! 'Twas raw beef covered with some type of mustard sauce, vinegar maybe. Deeeeelish! I ordered the fettuccine and it was different, differently delicious! It wasn't the Alfredo sauce and I was glad, It was a bit soupy in a red sauce instead. It had a couple pieces of shrimp. The pasta tasted very fresh. My boyfriend usually orders spaghetti and meatballs if it is his first time trying out a new Italian restaurant as his way of critiquing. He says \"A good Italian restaurant always makes good spaghetti and meatballs.\" Instead, he went bold and ventured with the Bolognese. Indeed he was very impressed! Way to go Piatti! Sides:Whipped potatoes, the most disappointing part of the meal. It was very smooth and creamy, but it was so salty! I felt like a jar of salt accidentally tipped over in to the mashed potatoes. Either that or the recipe consisted of 4 times too much salt. The server gladly took it back after we ate only 2 spoons each.Kale, so yummy! I loved the kale and bacon bits. I was just not a fan of the potato in it, they were too hard to my liking. Dessert:We had complimentary chocolate covered strawberries, one dipped in white chocolate and one dipped in dark chocolate. They were very big, juicy, and sweet.We also ordered the Blood Orange Sorbet. I liked it because it was refreshing, but it tasted like grapefruit to me. It had a piece of cookie in-between the two mini scoops of sorbet.My boyfriend and I would definitely come back and revisit Piatti again. TIP** AS A SAC STATE STUDENT WITH THE STUDENT I.D.

The carpaccio is a great dish; ask to add capers. It's more than just raw steak. It also has olives, grape tomatoes and arugula that elevates it from more simple carpaccio. The sauce on the meatballs is heavenly. I could chug a bowl of the tomato sauce by itself. It is made with fresh tomatoes and you can taste it. The polenta is the smoothest I've tried. It's as if it was made with corn powder not a rough corn meal. It has just enough cheese and cream without being too heavy. Goes great with the pork chop it accompanies."], ["Lili A.", "Always great service and delicious food! Lovely interior and patio seating.

The salmon was only good because it was a good wild filet cooked ok. It was however absolutely covered with salt. One problem with tonight is that we showed up absolutely STARVING and I would have eaten a bowl of lard with a hair in it which is THE ONLY reason I ate my food at all. Anyway, here are my observations/statements etc...1. Olive oil is NOT a broth.2. Salt is ONLY a seasoning to be used in small amounts. 3. Even in a drought year the option for water needs to be addressed.4. Bus service cannot ONLY exist to clear plates. 5. When someone does not like a wine...it is NOT ok to cop an attitude and curl your lip. (Not our primary server)I am not sure if I will go back.

Selling $100+ bottles of wine in a bistro is a bit of a joke when so very many good wines can be had a lots better pricing (e.g. Italian and Spanish wines are bargains now and few of these were on the list).Overall we like P a lot.

My fiance and I usually visit Piatti at happy hour and sit at the bar, however they have a lovely patio and outdoor seating as well. They have really friendly and attentive bartenders. Their happy hour menu includes food and drinks. Everything is priced $5. For food: I love their cesar salad. The dressing is made with anchovies, lots of parmesan cheese and the croutons are super crispy. You can also get a margherita or pepperoni pizza for $5. They also have meatball sliders that are to die for. They are pork and beef, I think, because they are so light and delicious. They are served on tasty toasted buns with fresh mozzarella and tomato sauce. You can also order calamari, olives or truffle fries. These items are all $5! Each meal is accompanied with bread and dipping sauce made with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic and herbs. For drinks: They have several wines \"on tap\". They have the Coppola Pinot Noir and the Simi Sauvignon Blanc and a Zinfandel, Chardonnay and Merlot under the Piatti label. All of the above wines are quite good, especially for the $5 price tag. Well drinks are $5 or you can upgrade your drink to call for $1. They have several nice beers on tap, such as Anderson Valley Boont Amber Ale, for $5 as well.I have eaten items of the full menu at lunch time. The shrimp fettuccine is delicious. I think it had a saffron sauce. I also had the chicken sandwich, which was humongous and really, really good! Their menu changes seasonally. The patio at Piatti is really nice.

Daughter had a upscale Mac n Cheese. Everyone was pleased with their food. For me, the spice and the garlic were a good match to the spinach fetticini, while the shrimp (let's be honest, these were really big tiger prawns) were properly done. Afters were a bowl of pear gelato and coffee, which I shared with my very tired daughter on my lap. No issues with a well behaved six year old, but I could see other dinners in the immediate area were not very accepting of children - no matter how behaved they were. And truth be told, this isn't a kid's pizza joint, but they do have a children's menu.Overall ambiance was very good, and the food earns four stars. Service was acceptable, and the waitress attentative, but not always available... perhaps just an off night. The manager asked if we needed anything, and we were (at that point) well taken care of... but it was very much appreciated.Bottom Line: Would be happy to return, and the meal was great.

We began a satisfying start to our dinner with a shared bottle of a Berryessa Gap Barbera wine and the popular starter, the pork & ricotta meatballs. Yum!

The goat feta and polenta they layer the meat over is amazing with the fig mostarda - you can never go wrong with this one!

We ended the night with two desserts recommended by our server, Anthony. Chocolate gooey cake and the pear and brown butter bread pudding. Both desserts were to die for, but the bread pudding definitely stole the show! All-in-all, there's never been a low moment with my experiences here.

This is clearly a major improvement over my past experiences here. It is obvious that everyone here from the waitstaff to the kitchen knows their business. The menu is new almost daily and there is obviously a lot of attention to fresh and local ingredients. We usually order a few small plates and share between us.

Well, look no further because a recent lunch party I attended here left me extremely impressed with such a quality overall experience. There were eleven of us in total and we gathered at the bar as folks arrived, enjoying their signature drinks like the not-so-traditional Bloody Mary that had a dirty martini vibe to it, or the Johnny Depp if you're looking for tequila and refreshment all in one glass. It was delicious and seemed like a favorite in our group.We had one waiter assigned to our party for the afternoon, Chris - a super friendly individual, outgoing and extremely knowledgeable of his menu who explained everything thoroughly. He offered personal input regularly and recommendations when needed, our drinks never went below half full and plates were always cleared when empty. Quite frankly, he executed one the best services I've experienced in a restaurant recently and something I do, and will, remember most about our visit. The food was excellent - pork & ricotta meatballs ladled with crushed tomatoes and topped with melted, house-made mozzarella cheese. A \"Fritto Misto\" calamari dusted with semolina flour and fried to perfection, including slices of fried lemon. Surprisingly, a light dish without all the \"fried\" feeling you get from most fried dishes. The Prosciutto pizza with fresh arugula was a hit even though a bit salty, but hey, it's a \"prosciutto\" pizza, it's going to be salty. If you're interested in knowing where your food came from, the chalkboard above the kitchen shows the different farms Piatti sources their food from. \u00a0Overall, just a great lunch experience with good friends. It was a moment to enjoy delicious food with wonderful service in a classy but comfortable environment where we were warmly welcomed and treated like family.

Biba is as good as you're going to find in Sacramento. It's authentic. (Hello, have you met the owner?) I find it laughable that people actually try and tell you to go to the Olive Garden instead of this place for \"comparable food.\" It's Americanized garbage that's thrown onto a plate and reheated. That is NOT Italian, and it is definitely NOT Biba.Sorry for the vent - anyway. This place is a bit pricy, so if you don't want to drop $100 for a nice dinner, ambiance and some amazing wine - then don't go.As far as the food goes, of course I had the lasagna. It is superb to say the least.As far as the portions go, it is a fine dining restaurant...your portions aren't going to be ginormous. In any case, we ordered a couple appetizers, our main dish, and dessert and I was more than full after we left. As far as the service, it's impeccable. There's a reason this place is crowded on Friday and Saturday nights, so yes you may have to be a bit patient if you didn't make a reservation ( which I would suggest doing). I will agree with the older crowd comments, but it is a fabulous place to take a date - where you can actually hear yourself to have nice dinner conversation.Side note : If you use Facebook, Biba actually posts dishes on there too that are amazingly scrumptious!Keep going strong Biba! Buon Appetito!"], ["Aaron F.", "Tried this place out after reading about it as one of the places to try in Sac. I was a little cautious based on the up and down reviews but was pretty satisfied with the food. The inside and ambiance was just ok. It didn't really feel like the upscale place that it's trying to be with the decor. \u00a0It kind of lends itself to an older crowd which is probably why we were the youngest people there by about 20 years. Could also be bc we are dinner fairly early at 6:30 too. The food really is the reason to come. While my date had the lasagna which they just thought was good, I had the garganelli with lamb which was extremely tasty. I also had a half serving if the gnocchi which was equally as good. Started with the calamari which was just so so. Tasted like the store bought variety to me. Saintsbury Pinot noir paired great with all dishes. One of the best Pinots I've had and my favorite Napa Wine of this varietal."], ["J.K. E.", "We went here for a birthday splurge and found it to be quite impressive. They were classy and the tables were properly set. The server was professional and very competent. We were very pleased with the decor and the service. The wine was nice and not too expensive considering that it was a restaurant and all. The soup was excellent. We had the lentil soup which did taste a lot like Van Kamps pork and beans but it was still good. The pasta was really nice albeit a little on the al dente side. The entree was nice. She had lamb stew and I had the chicken. The chicken was boneless except for the wing but seemed overpriced for chicken. It tasted like chicken. The dessert was exquisite. A nice pound cake around a cheesecake with a delicious sauce that was like vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup drizzled across it. All in all it was a pleasant dinner but more like four $ than three $ if you know what I mean.

I'm a fan of the retro-looking lobby or the pink neon Biba sign in the window, but the main dining room is white, bright, modern and filled with indistinct chatter.

She was such a fantastic teacher that I wound up buying her cookbooks as fast as they came out. And still do. Most recent, Spaghetti Sauces, went on sale earlier this year. Some of the cooking segments that she did for KCRA are available on YouTube like this one for salmon fettuccine: bit.ly/sYPxiC I've been to the restaurant twice in the last couple of months and both times it was swamped.

The bartender was very friendly even when she was trying to do 20 things at once.If you want a table, this is one of the few Sacramento restaurants I would recommend making a reservation, no matter what time you're coming. Even with major construction going on around the building, they were booked solid one recent Friday afternoon. There's valet parking available on the Capitol Ave. side.Every day there is a stuffed pasta and a ricotta gnocchi special. I tried the ravioli stuffed with a pork mixture on one occasion. The pasta is served very al dente, so be prepared for a toothsome bite. The filling was tasty, but just a little dry.Next time was the gnocchi served with a lamb ragu. Light, melt in your mouth pillows were tossed with a perfect coating of the savory sauce. Delicious, it had me wishing for a second helping.Minestrone was good, but for $8 I was hoping for something more exceptional.Portions are small. I have a hard time being too critical of this because I tend to think that after many years of American marketing, my idea of what a normal portion size is might be a little skewed.They introduced prix fixe menus for lunch and dinner that seem like a very good deal, each including soup or salad and an entree.Recent renovations have added a classy, contemporary touch to a dining room that was a bit dated. It's a very comfortable atmosphere with polished, friendly service.I got a chance to meet the renowned chef/hostess. Gracious, approachable and always beaming, she is the epitome of an Italian grand dame.

She recommended the Masi panini ($10.00) and the Fiori pizza ($18.00). We went with her recommendation. Both items arrived fairly quick. The panini was not what I expected. It was cold and just straight up bland, the mozzarella cheese inside was cold (but I guess that's the type of panini it was). We took two bites of it and put it aside. The pizza was pretty good thankfully. The waitress came back and I explained that we didn't like the panini, but that the pizza was actually good, she clearly saw that we put the panini aside as well. Another worker came around and we asked him to take it out of the way. When we got the tab, she still kept the $10 panini on it. As a business owner I understand you have to make a profit and that the customer kind of needs to know what they are ordering, but at the same time customer satisfaction and retention is a higher priority. Again I was surprised that she kept it on there especially after we mentioned not liking the ingredients and that it was our first time.. I guess losing me as a client doesn't really matter for such a popular joint like Hot Italian where I'm sure their more loyal patrons receive better service.PS.

The space of the building is very wide, so there's much enough room for customers.The service is well received. No issues or complaints at all as I welcomed there!For the food ordering process, I ordered the Pantani Panini. So far, it tasted very good! I can feel the smoked salmon thinly slices through my nose. The homemade panini dough is very chewy to eat after it baked very well without extra burns. The cheese, tomatoes, and the arugula does match it very good! There's a good sections of oils to enhance it like the spicy oil and the Italian olive oil.

You can park at the surface street parking at Fremont park which it surrounds the small squared park for 2 hours limit, or park it at the garage between 15th and 16th Streets.

Their sorbetto is delicately perfect. The first time, I had nectarine sorbetto, the second time I had nectarine AND strawberry, and then this last time I had strawberry and passionfruit. They are seasonal flavors, so ask your server or the person behind the gelato counter.The place itself is actually really... hip. You walk in, grab a menu, and seat yourself.

It's really a cool and interesting layout. So, why the lower rating...? I love pizza and I just was underwhelmed. We ordered a 32 JOVANOTTI. It had prosciutto cotto, pepperoni, mushrooms, mozarella and a different kind of cheese (I forgot). Anyway, I felt like they took a pinch of the listed ingredients above, put it on some dough and then cooked it, and then waited, and then gave it to us. It was a very okay pizza. For almost $20.

The place has an espresso station, a bar and a awesome view of the park! There is an outdoor patio that also looks cool as well! The music is very happy and lounge style! Today I came in for lunch and was very hungry and in the mood for pizza! Upon arrival, I was pleased to see that Sebastion was behind the bar and working hard. I sat down at a table and was greeted by Eddie, my server of the day. He clarified a few quick. Questions that I had about the menu and helped me make a selection. Brought me my drink and a few min later my pizza was out. The taste was amazing! I was so happy to get a good pizza around this place! My taste buds are actually dancing with joy today! The pizza I ordered is actually big enough to feed two so I will be bringing some home and eating it tomorrow as a snack! \u00a0Now Matter how stuffed you are, it seems there is always room for dessert though! I was extremely excited to see the salted caramel gelato. I ordered some and it's happiness in a cup! I haven't seen anything this laid back sense the last time I was in NYC... I will definitely return to taste more! Thanks guys for a great experience and amazing service!"], ["Steve H.", "In town for business and looking for Yelper's help on good pizza.Decided to try Hot Italian with a co-worker. We arrived on a Tuesday night at 7pm and plenty of seats available ( but filled quickly). The menu had some interesting pizza combos and we took some time deciding.We ordered 2 pies, both outstanding. The crust has crisp outside and soft interior, proportions are spot on. We enjoyed it so much we ordered a third pie to go, split it for our flight home and we were the envy of our row!Service was excellent, prices fair, and our return guaranteed."], ["Yao C.", "This place is okay. It gets a lot of hype and i understand it can be a hip joint to spend time with friends and family but honestly.... The food is just alright. First off, you really don't get greeted when you walk in, you have to seat yourself and grab a menu. Also, I am not a fan of the high tables on wheels. It's not fun when you are eating and the table suddenly moves. We had 3 pizzas.... One veggie pizza with artichokes, olives with a pesto sauce, and meat pizza that includes Sausage, pepperoni and mushrooms, and lastly, a pizza with sausage and goat cheese. I was not a big fan of the veggie pizza and the other two were okay. It was thin crust which I enjoy. We also ordered two salads which I thought was mediocre at best. They didn't even have a caesar! We had a Cobb salad and a salad with tuna in it! Honestly, this place is just a fancy pizza and calzone place. Truthfully, round table, Woodstock, Steve's pizza have better pizzas. Would u come back, probably not...."], ["Michael P.", "Went here for the first time the other night and was amazed! The decor was very modern and the staff very friendly with great service. I would say this is the best pizza I've had in years, most certainly in California! As a huge soccer fan, I was delighted to see a pizza named after one of my favorite players, Andrea Pirlo. I could not resist ordering this pizza and enjoyed every bite! The flavors were very fresh, with just enough sauce to not be overwhelming, while having a perfectly thin crust cooked to perfection. I also ordered the white chocolate gelato, which was fantastic! I look forward to going back and trying out their other pizzas and gelato!"], ["Maria K.", "We enjoyed our brunch. The decor was minimal modern. First we ordered a Bloody Mary, blood orange Bellini and a lemon pellegrino. The blood orange Bellini was only $4! We ordered the #1 Bellucci calzone and the #57 Nibali. Don't forget to ask for the hot olive oil and the Rosemary olive oil! It really adds to the flavor experience! To finish off our brunch we ordered gelato - espresso and stracciatella. Muah!"], ["Jennifer M.", "4 stars for the pizza, 2.5 for the calzones, and 2 for the prices...I figured somehow mathematically that worked out to a 3 star rating. I really loved the pizza, but they are just so overpriced. It was $17.50 for ONE calzone. Maybe it's because I'm originally from NY, but in no neighborhood where I'm from would anyone ever pay that much for a calzone. The calzone was also really lacking in sauce. I understand overcharging a bit for the pizza since it's the fancy wood fired northern italian style, but they're still really small for the price. That being said, the times I've gone in to pick up my order, the place looks bustling, so the atmosphere looks good, and I've only ever had positive encounters with staff here. I might go back to try it and dine in this time, maybe my opinion will change."], ["Cindy D.", "Nice black & white decor. Simple and hip. You can see from the inside but not outside in. \u00a0I ordered the #32 Jovanotti.. This pizza has a thin crust and the sauce was kind of spicy. It feeds 2 people. #08 magnini.. It was thick crust panini. It sliced in half but my half didn't have a lot of salmon and too much greens but love the mascarpone cheese inside. \u00a0I wouldn't order this again. I felt like I was eating a lot of bread."], ["Marcus M.", "Decent pizza in dark settings! Spacious establishment as well. Italian beers were clutch as well! But turn dwn the music"], ["Winny S.", "I'm loving Hot Italian, I finally got to eat here Friday night, after wanting to for over a year! \u00a0This place is hip, cool and any other positive fun, funky adjective you can think of! \u00a0Large, open spaces with white and black painted walls, large industrial size fan, in the main eating area, and 2 Fiat cars, on loan from Niello, in the other room. \u00a0There's something for every one here, authentic Italian style pizza, with high quality, fresh ingredients, in unique and tasty flavor combinations. \u00a0On certain pizzas, they even give you the choice of having it prepared as a pizza or as a calzone! \u00a0They have beer, wine, specialty vodka drinks, sparkling water, espresso drinks, & did I mention Gelato! \u00a0We enjoyed the \"Bellucci\" pizza with house made fennel sausage, ricotta cheese, and tomato sauce. \u00a0Our waitress told us about a \"seasonal\"pizza, they had, it had fontina cheese, sliced figs \u00a0and a sweet balsamic drizzle, sounded so good, and figs are in season in August! \u00a0So we ordered that one as well. \u00a0I liked the fig pizza better, the saltiness of the cheese, complimented the sweetness of the figs, and the sweet balsamic was the perfect finish to a light and yummy pizza. \u00a0 She also brought over some of the house made spicy chili oil, to enjoy with our pizza, which gave a new and interesting twist, to our already wonderful pizza choices! \u00a0 Alas, I was too stuffed to enjoy an espresso & one of their tasty sounding dessert options. \u00a0But, next time, for sure! \u00a0After our meal we went for a walk in Fremont Park, across the street."], ["John H.", "3.5 StarsHot Italian has reached its fifth birthday and this pizzeria/bar/Italian merchandiser is dishing up! \u00a0The chic, strictly black/white interior features high-top family style seating, full bar, a gelato counter and a patio. The owners are picky about their authentic Italian ingredients and process, and they're also environmentally conscious. We stopped in recently to check out the pies.Our first was #11 Ligabue - a pesto based pizza with mozzarella, Pecorino, Romano and pine nuts (with the recommended prosciutto added on top) - $16. Along with that was the #25 Fiori - tomato sauce, mushrooms, mozzarella, prosciutto and arugula - $14.The first pizza arrived barely warm (huh?) and was just \"OK.\" Both were quite tasty, with a near perfect crispy yet soft crust on the second (it's gotta be hot or the crust won't be amazing). There's peppery olive oil if you want your pizza more spicy.For dessert we ordered the Zucchero, a chocolate-filled panini with bosc pear slices, nuts and lots of Nutella-tasting filling. Would I order again? Meh...methinks pizza dough is better used as a single crust.The optional gelato was a partial save, but the crust was a bit tough and doughy. More of a project than a dessert!The down & dirty:Food - 4 - authentic Milano pizzas with awesome crust!Service - 3 - They're nice & all, but c'mon, bring out that pizza while it's hot!Value - 3 - Right down the middle.Setting - 4 - Not your average Applebee's here. Plus, there's a patio.Date worthy - 4 - Nice theme, full bar, gelato counter!"], ["Summer M.", "After years of waiting I finally made it to Hot Italian. It was a lazy and slow Sunday and we went for a late lunch/early dinner (dunch? linner? meh, anyway...) Inside is a upscale modern interior, but not so much as to dispel the casual atmosphere. Random side note: I love the way the bathrooms are designed. I used to work at an architecture/design firm, so I appreciate a place with a posh aesthetic.As I am pear-obsessed, I ordered the Murino pizza topped with pears, honey, gorgonzola and mozzarella. Our order came out pretty quickly, I think we only waited 5-10 minutes. I LOVED the Murino, the taste was amazing and the pears paired well with my hard apple cider- but there was one issue. When my pie came out it had what I thought was pools of grease on top of the cheese (not an uncommon sight on pizza). I failed to grasp that the heat of the dish changes the viscosity of slow-flowing honey (the kind that stays in the place you poured it) and turns it into honey that rapidly runs onto your fingers, hands and wrists. The honey, as B put it, became \"quickly problematic\". And as the honey itself didn't add too much to the flavor, I will ask them to leave it off next time I order that pie. After our entrees we ordered dessert from the gelato window and sat outside. We enjoyed our cookies & cream and mint chip gelatos in the sunshine and it was just a bit of alright. Delizioso!!"], ["Kristy P.", "First time visit Thursday around noon. I'd been wanting to try this place and had a Chinook Book coupon for free gelato with purchase of pizza. No one welcomed us, went to the counter to find out how things work, do we order at the counter, get table service? I was handed 2 menus and asked to seat ourselves. Pizza was ok, nothing special, especially for the price, but we both loved the spicy olive oil. I like that they leave a bottle of water at the table. The server was very nice but never came back to the table after we got our pizza, oil and water. We went looking for her and the gelato and paid the check. Gelato was delicious."], ["Jasmine F.", "This was my first time at this place and I am just impressed with the quality of the pizza. Not only was the dough perfect but the toppings taste fresh and flavorful. The staff are friendly as well. I watched a man toss fresh pizza dough in the air over and over and was completely mesmerized. I will be back!"], ["Alice W.", "Aaaand the verdict is in: I am really not a fan. We decided to give this place another shot one night while browsing through, on Yelp, yet again, the lovely usual list of generic been-there-done-that restaurants here in Sacramento. Really, when what you're choosing between is a sorry sushi dinner, the usual mom-n-pop sandwich shop, the co-op, or something that seems slightly more interesting (Hot Italian?!), you're gonna wanna pick the most \"adventurous\" from the list. And so that's what we did. And, unfortunately, we regret it. My bf is strangely obsessed with smoked salmon, and what do you know, the 4th picture on this Yelp page is a smoked salmon pizza. So, without hesitation, we roll over to Hot Italian. We're embraced by the usual cool, hip vibe; cool, hip tables (and awfully uncomfortable chairs); and cool, hip waiters.We started with 1 pizza with the intention to potentially add to it if it wasn't enough. We didn't expect to have to. Surprisingly, a $16 pizza was simply not enough between my boyfriend and me (and we are notorious among our friends for having terribly small stomachs but large appetites). Which basically means that we were decently hungry, and despite having smaller stomach pouches, a whole pizza with its scant, paper-thin salmon slices, heavy and not filling mascarpone cheese, and tiny sprinkles of dill, was simply NOT enough. Elsewhere, you give us a pizza and we're carrying 2 slices leftover home. Not to mention the pizza itself has a terribly thin crust, so what you're looking at is a \"pizza\" that's more like 1/2 the size of something you could expect at BJ's or somewhere else for the same price (but better quality/taste/flavor). Because, really, I really wasn't blown away by the salmon pizza. I could have rolled some dough at home and sprinkled on my own smoked salmon. It could have been that easy and that cheap. And it would have tasted just like Hot Italian's. So basically we paid $20 after taxes and tip only to leave the place needing to spend more money on food elsewhere. Because we weren't going to drop another $20 on scant pizza, appetizers, or otherwise. No bueno!"], ["Katie K.", "Ok my bf is a pizza fanatic and expert! I mean he doesn't know how to make a good pizza but he sure knows how to select his pizzas. He literally can eat pizza every day. We've been to Hot Italian a few times and were completely satisfied with our pizzas and drinks. Especially with their house olive oils *** Great customer service, friendly staff and pretty laid back and causal atmosphere.Price- very reasonable especially when the pizzas and drinks are that good. Nothing tops good food and quality for a good price.. Hands down!"], ["Daniela N.", "I'd love to eventually work my way through all of Sacramento's pizza places (New Years resolution?), and decided to start my 2015 quest with this place. Placed an order online before driving over to pick it up. We parked a little bit ahead of the restaurant, only to find you can park pretty much right outside it. The area before it was a little sketchy. We walked in and though it is seat yourself, were immediately greeted. I like the decor, kind of minimalistic and done in neutral colors. The woman who greeted us and grabbed our pizza for us was really friendly. She did mention that a lot of people accidentally place an order for the Emeryville location when they order online, so be careful of that if you do an online order. We got the citterio pizza ($14) to share which was big enough for two if you're not crazy hungry. It had mozzarella, ham, spinach, and parmigiano. They have a great menu, with vegan options, calzones, lots of pizzas, and various desserts. I am kind of bummed we did not just eat there since our pizza was cold by the time we got home. Next time!"], ["Gianna M.", "Cool atmosphere, great pizza!"], ["Katrina F.", "Stopped by here with my friend to get their seasonal fig with balsamic pizza and man am I glad we did! My friend is a reoccurring customer, but this was my first time here. The location is easy to find and the interior is really fun. I loved the different tables and options to sit at. I could easily see myself coming in and sitting at the window while enjoying a gelato on a nice summers day. The pizza was delicious. We added prosciutto to it as what is a pizza without meat?! We also each ordered gelato, I went with their seasonal Rolo flavor, and it was a great, cool flavor. I will definitely be returning!"], ["Terrill C.", "Not only is the food wonderful, but as my good friend J pointed out, this is also an environmentally conscious establishment. \u00a0Kudos to Hot Italian for their use of biodegradable cardboard instead of the difficult to environmentally manage \u00a0plastics! \u00a0When we need to enjoy that delicious Hot Italian cuisine at home, we feel that we're supporting an institution that behaves as we would if given the opportunity. \u00a0Less green guilt, more tasty adventures."], ["Minda S.", "This place is THE BEST pizza on the planet!

The waffles themselves were just right: soft and flaky on the inside and golden brown on the outside! It came with three sauces (syrup, butter, and a \"special sauce\" for the chicken), and I must say that sauce for the chicken has a major kick, and I dug it! Overall, staff was friendly and welcoming. I have to come back with friends! PS I also saw they have happy hour deals, and specific nights where they do events! I will definitely be back."], ["Mickie R.", "I'm giving this place 5 stars for the fries alone. FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT'S HOLY PLEASE NEVER CHANGE THE WAY YOU MAKE FRIES. The fries are a fry snob's dream. Light and crispy but not crunchy, and they actually MELT IN YOUR MOUTH when you try to chew them. Made from fresh cut potatoes that are blanched and then fried, like perfect fries should be. You will hate all other fries everywhere after you taste these fries. On another note, the house salad was gorgeous and different and delicious."], ["Anderson S.", "I heard that Adamo's has amazing hand made pasta, so my sister and I stopped in for lunch a few days ago. Pleasant feeling dining room was nearly empty, of course, midday. The server was attentive and dry humored, which I liked. The pasta selection for lunch is minimal and none of the choices jumped out at me, so I switched gears and got a caprese, and a meatball sandwich with fries. MY caprese was a large portion with beautiful red and yellow beefsteak tomatoes which just on the verge of being too ripe, delicious, and the fresh mozzarella was satisfactory quality, texture, and flavor. My sandwich was huge and saucy, and the meatballs were very tasty. I could've been satisfied with half of it, but I manned up, sacrifice the remaining fries and finished that bitch. I also had a couple of session IPAs from Oskar Blues on draught, yum. Overall, great lunch experience. I will be back for pasta for dinner!"], ["jamie s.", "SHUT THE FRONT DOOR!!! Actually I hope the doors are forever open!!!!! This place is flipping awesome!!!! I am loving the fresh pasta. So eggy and chewy, which is pasta perfection. Loved every bite, and by every bite I may or may not have taken the time to drive 30 minutes here in the last couple weeks.

I walk up to the young lady preparing the menus--standing next to the sign, grab two, and my companion and I sit at the table and begin to peruse the menu. I must admit that my old fashioned self prefers to be greeted at a nice place like Adamo's and shown to my seat. It makes me feel like my business matters and they are looking forward to serving me. So I was taken aback at the seat yourself sign. BUT, dear yelper, to my surprise it went even further! I was greeted by a friendly waiter and then told by yet another waiter that they had a reservation for this table and we were welcome to wait 10-15 minutes for another table to become free. To say I was surprised is putting it mildly! There was no reserved sign on the table. We were instructed by another sign to seat ourselves only to now be told- whoops! Kidding! Customer experience=a BIG zero! \u00a0Now what would have made all the difference was a , \"hey! Our mistake. First glass of wine is on us.\" Short of that AND there was NONE of that, I'm walking right on down the street to the next place that actually values my business and treats me like you really want me to come and dine with you. SUPER DISAPPOINTED Adamo's and I was really looking forward to spending time with you these evening.

I also had the wings - if you hit a reset button on your expectations of buffalo sauce, you'll find these little tasty grilled wings a nice vacation from bready fried wings.

The toppings were also very good. I shared it with a friend but ended up eating way more than I should have.Now onto the bad...The wait was long. I think it took about 30 minutes after ordering until we received our meals. We were on our lunch break so we ended up asking for the boxes when they finally brought out our food. I ordered the Carbonara. It had no taste and I don't even think they used sauce or an egg. It literally tasted like boiled noodles with a little bit of butter. I actually feel offended with what I received as my meal. To be sure I wasn't over exaggerating, I had my friend next to me try it and she said the same thing. She said it tastes like just butter, if anything. I couldn't even eat my meal. I will likely have to go home and fix it up, or I may just end up tossing it.

For dinner, I've thoroughly enjoyed their tortellini and their baked pasta but was also turned onto the pork fusilini after trying it at their block party - it's spicy but delicious. The beer selection is great. The happy hour is a value - try a pitcher of their red wine sangria & some appetizers to start out your evening. It's a great place for dates.On the negative side, the crowds sometimes results in long waits. I've had a number of group dinners here, but with a large group you can sometimes get stuck waiting quite a while to be seated. Parking isn't so great.

During fall and winter my gourmet pizza substitute was their GORGONZOLA & FUIJI APPLE PIZZA - Olive oil, garlic, sauteed apples, caramelized onions, spinach, gorgonzola & mozzarella. Definitely another well crafted slice of pizza heaven. My man always gets their fried ravioli which he claims is amazing! \u00a0(I can't have because of my shellfish allergy and it is fried in the same fryer). Also, yesterday was our first time trying their ceasar salad, which by the way was very delicious. \u00a0It actually topped Ruth Chris' s Ceasar salad for me! Paesanos is a hidden gem to me. \u00a0Not to many locations near me but it's worth the drive. \u00a0Their menu is unique and every dish is full of flavor. \u00a0One of my favorite Italian restaurants by far! Delizioso!"], ["Marina M.", "Pizza is great and service is great! The crust was perfect! Crunchy and perfect size.

Maybe almost a little too great since it seemed like the servers were behind (our server seemed to be at least).What gives this place three stars was a shocking encounter I had with a manager. My mom and I split the pork fissuli (which by the way had AMAZING flavor). When the dish came out, the pasta was cold. Being in the food industry, this was no problem to me or mom, things happen. We told someone who told the manager. We told the manager that approached us what had happened and she STRAIGHT UP STUCK HER HAND IN OUR FOOD.... ON THE TABLE.. To check if it was cold. She put her hand in the middle part of the dish so of course it was warm. I just didn't want cold pasta. Overall it was a on par time. Good music, the service mean well and are sweet. Just handling situations seemed hairy."], ["Jennifer L.", "The pastas here are one of my favorites in town, I order the \"pork fusilli\" every time I come and it never disappoints. The concoction of spicy ginger pork and chili verde/sour cream is just to die for. My boyfriend and I have also ordered their vegetarian pizza & bbq steak pizza, a bit smaller than expected so it's definitely more of a \"personal\" size pizza but delicious none the less. Their mixed drinks are a treat too, I can't get enough of their pineapple/ginger mojito....I can drink those things like water."], ["Angela W.", "Service- we were seated promptly by a very nice waitress. She also took our orders quickly when we were ready. I was surprised by how fast our appetizer and then our pastas came out. I have definitely had to wait longer times for worse food. Ambiance- love the little buckets of napkins on the table and the chalkboard column in the restaraunt. The ambiance was very nice and classy without making me feel underdressed.Food- we ordered the bocce balls as an appetizer. Oh my god they were so good. The bread was dense and chewy and the garlic butter was savory without being too oily. I had the creole pasta and it was delicious! Huge portions and excellent spices. My friend were similarly pleased by the carbonara (lots of bacon) and the fettuccine.I don't live near here but next time I'm on the neighborhood I am definitely going to stop by for another delicious meal!"], ["Ashley J.", "Was sitting next to the hostess station last night when this rude customer walked in drunk and demanding to be seated. They were so busy and they told her it would be a few minute wait. She immediately started berating the hostess cussing her out because they had ONE empty table on the patio. I was absolutely shocked someone would treat another human so disrespectfully. After the drunk woman was done demanding to be seated she proceeded to walk outside exclaiming she was going to write a one star review on here and other sites and seated herself. She then demanded to speak to the manager. If this were my restaurant, I would have refused service. I wanted to take a moment and write this review as these ladies handled this situation so gracefully and with tact. They were slammed and packed and still were able to brush off how rude this woman was to them. Still serving them even though she was being a complete B word the rest of the night making rude comments about their appearances and telling them they were horrible people. The food was delicious and I would absolutely go here again despite the negative review M. L. gave. Just remember folks, be kind to the people who handle your food.

It was a little too warm to sit outside, but on a nice fall day or early evening that would be perfect. \u00a0The restaurant inside was nice & cool, not too busy at that time of day. \u00a0The service was good. \u00a0We started with the polenta fries, as seen on other Yelp reviews, so I took their word for it, & enjoyed them they come with two yummy dipping sauces as well. \u00a0I chose the Spinach & Papaya salad with goat cheese, \u00a0polenta croutons and a sweet balsamic dressing. \u00a0I substituted the bacon for candied pecans, and I think it improved the salad. \u00a0We were happy with our meals, and will certainly try this place again, as pasta, pizza and a good salad are some of my favorite foods."], ["Lyna N.", "Went to dinner here a few weeks ago while visiting my sister in Sac. Didn't make a reservation on a Saturday night so we were seated within 30 minutes. While waiting for our table we had delicious drinks at the bar. Once seated we ordered another cocktail because it was so good. Wish I could remember the name. Great version of a Moscow mule in a mason jar! Ordered 2 appetizers and 4 entrees to share between 4 people. -Bocce balls were fried pizza dough smothered in garlic butter, Parmesan, and basil. Perfectly crispy on the outside and super soft inside. -Fried Ravioli filled with spinach, served with marinara sauce. Omg so good!!-Butternut squash risotto had pancetta and Parmesan. My favorite dish of the night! -Fig and prosciutto pizza is a combination of fig jam, mozzarella and cambazola cheese, prosciutto, caramelized onions, Parmesan, balsamic, and fresh arugula. Pizza is my favorite food of all time and I'd have to say this was one of the best. -Cauliflower pappardelle had bacon, arugula, feta, spicy tomatoe sauce, and lemon. Pasta was perfectly cooked. Great as leftovers. -Tortellini formaggio had sun dried tomatoes in a pesto cream sauce. We added shrimp and extra Parmesan on top. Great ambiance. Friendly staff. Full bar and tasty food.

The Italian sausage pizza had a good overall ratio of ingredients. It had the perfect combination of meat, cheese, and sauce. \u00a0The Italian sausage was flavorful, but there was something missing to make it above average. I was mostly disappointed that the crust and bread was not as crunchy as I would have liked it to be. It was not soggy, but it was not able to stand up on its own which I believe is something that is the most important part that makes a pizza above average.  The all cheese pizza may have had lots of different cheeses on it, but overall it didn't make me love it as cheese pizza should be loved. There were certain cheeses on the pizza that had a kick to them. \u00a0The cheese had such a powerful kick that I don't even remember if it had sauce in the pizza."], ["Dan C.", "This is the neighborhood restaurant that we all wish we had.

I come here a lot lol"], ["Vanessa H.", "After driving by this place time and time again, for once we finally decided to stop in and give it a try. It was exactly how I would have imagined it to be! So much character! So much bustle! So much beer! I imagine that a lot of the people who eat there are locals who either walk or ride their bike to the area. It just seemed so relaxed, and the servers knew some of the customers by name. We came in early, around 5:30 and the dinner rush was just in the beginning stages. Kristina was our server and she was so sweet, knowledgeable and patient with us! We had wanted some draft beer, but we couldn't make up our minds. She offered suggestions and gave us a lot of time to decide. \u00a0Since it was date night, and my hubby and I decided to get a few things to sample. We started with the pear and endive salad, and the heirloom tomato bruschetta. I love how delicate the dishes were, and not overly seasoned or drenched in sauces. The special of the night was a ham and artichoke pizza which was fantastic! (I didn't realize how large it was going to be, we definitely had enough for cold leftovers the next morning.) After thoroughly enjoying our dinner, around 6:30 we informed Kristina that we had a show that we were trying to get to at 7:00 and we didn't want to rush her, but we wanted to get our check and another round. She was so nice and even though it was obvious she had a lot of other tables, she treated us like we were her only ones, and worked to get us out the door a mere 10 minutes later. This kind of service on a busy Friday night is unheard of! I really enjoyed this restaurant. With so many new restaurants claiming to be the next \"Farm- Fresh-LaidBackPosh-To Fork- Fusion-Swank \" popping up in downtown/midtown, i appreciate how genuine and true One Speed is. This place is just as comparable to all the new restaurants in regards to cuisine, service and style... but it still seems to lay right under the radar.

We ordered three pizzas - Italian Sausage, Napoletana, and Garden Pie. Out of the three, the Garden Pie was the favorite due to the sweetness of the vegetables (winter squash, brussels sprouts, mushroom, kale, ricotta, and sheepsmilk cheese). The wood oven made the pizzas so delicious. We also shared a gnocchi alla bolognese ($14) which was an interesting twist to the typical cream sauce. I thought the flavors were okay. Portion was a small. I tried to eat around the meat, but there were tiny pieces of meat in the sauce. Parking was a bit of a challenge.

And went back shortly after the first visit. Looking from the street the appearance is very clean and modern inside, with several tables on the patio. \u00a0Both times we visited were on the weekend, and their peak hours seem to be from 7 PM-Close. Even on Sunday 7:30 PM we did not have to wait too long for the table. The service on both occasions was good, no problems at all whatsoever. And the big plus in my book is that they have a pretty decent beer list, change their taps frequently, and the staff knows what's on tap at any given time.We tried several appetizers but their house made focaccia with hummus stood out. Simple but delicious and priced at bargain $4. Otherwise there are many antipasto choices on the menu, with most of them going for $10....Salad menu is also pretty extensive and their salads are made only with the freshest ingredients and dressed just right. On first occasion we got to try some of their pasta and while \u00a0the spring gnocchi were flavorful, the sauce was perhaps a bit too light and not very filling. I usually love gnocchi but these were not rememberable. Finally, the most compelling reason for visiting OneSpeed and what they are known for is their wood burning oven and the pizzas. We had pepperoni and margherita. Margherita was a hybrid in between Neapolitan and American pizza, and while not traditional, it \u00a0was pretty good. The pepperoni pizza was much better and one of the better option for this staple in Sacramento.Considered by some the best pizza in Sac, OneSpeed surely did not disappoint. Not exactly the best pizza (I put Hot Italian and Masullo's in front), but Top 5 for sure.

We did not and the hostess replied, \"not a problem, right this way\". Off to a great start because I hate when eateries make walk-in guests feel like a bother.

Anyone who reads my reviews knows I'm a sucker for homemade pasta, and theirs really hit the spot. It's not my favorite, but up there. For reference, the lunch portion comes with four large ravioli. I really also enjoyed the hint of lemon in their marinara sauce. Yummy! The soup was good, but a tad salty for my tastes so I think next time I will try the salad.

The pork schnitzel was every bit as good as I've had in Deutschland. The sausage platter came with a bratwurst and weisswurst. The weisswurst along with the mustard gave me flashbacks to the German version of a hot dog, which I used to order from the sausage stands. The potato pancakes were a bit too dense and the potato salad wasn't to my liking. It may not be to my liking, it was still pretty decent. We washed it all down with some Czech Pilsners. The ambience is cozy, cute and laid back. Aside from the pizzas, the entrees are Euro comfort food. Entrees are presented beautifully on wooden trays and gives you the feeling that you are dining in a Gasthaus in Europe.

I made a long overdue return and found it to be perhaps the best pizza in East Sacramento, and one so huge and packed with toppings that I enjoyed it all week long. I suppose my long delay between visits was because the pizza competition in Sacramento is so stiff. You've got options appealing to patrons both upscale (Masulo, Hot Italian) to the late night munchie crowd (Pieces, Uncle Vito's) and dozens in between. La Trattoria stands out by tasting fresher than any of the competitors with plenty of ingredients and a thick, addictive crust. Wash it down with a massive stein of Czech beer and sit out on the quaint patio and you have a perfect weekend getaway in your own backyard. The rest of their menu is equally as tasty and their pies.

We couldn't have been more wrong. The food was five-star. Great salads and great entrees all around. It may even be a slight notch below gourmet. I had the Arugula Salad with pears and goat-cheese, then and the Goulash- a rare treat. Others of us had the Chicken Paprikash, also amazing with a savory flavor impossible to find anywhere, and finally, the kids loved their unique Gnocchi.

Thank you chefs and staff of La Trott, we will be back someday."], ["Marianne W.", "Wonderful food!!! \u00a0It was my first visit and I decided to try the Bavarian Goulash and my friend ordered the Chicken Paprikash. \u00a0Both dishes were very flavorful. \u00a0The pork in the goulash wasn't quite as tender as I hoped but the flavor was there, it was well seasoned and the kraut was perfect. \u00a0One of their specialties is their dumplings. \u00a0I expected them to be small and incorporated into the goulash. \u00a0What I got was one very large dumpling, sliced like a loaf of dense, unbaked bread dough. \u00a0Although it was cooked I just didn't care for the texture, the bland taste, or eating it like a slice of bread. \u00a0The Chicken Paprikash was wonderful! \u00a0Great taste and texture. \u00a0The spaetzle that came with it was perfect. \u00a0The portion size for both entrees was very large so we were glad that we didn't order appetizers or side salads. \u00a0The wine selections are very limited.I was there early on a Tuesday evening and even though the restaurant only had a couple of tables occupied, the service was a bit slow. \u00a0I will definitely come here again and next time I'll try something from the Italian side of the menu!"], ["Brenda B.", "This place has some serious eats ! \u00a0Check your diet at the door cuz you're gonna want to eat everything and everything is super rich .

Pizza crust was nice and chewy . The pancakes with the sour cream was soooo good ! And sausage variety was yummy as well .. They had a nice bite to them .

My dad got the special - egg pappardelle with a creamy pesto, squash, tomatoes, and added sausage. We all loved our meals and the boys cleaned their plates.We all ordered beers. I loved the Belgian Lucifer. My dad got a dark lager, primator I believe. It was malty and had great flavor, but not bite so it as easy to drink.Our waitress was great too.

The ambiance is nice. House wine is pretty good. And there were a few menu items I thought I loved. Unfortunately, upon repeat visits, the quality had been pretty inconsistent. For example, the Bohemian Potato Pancake (with salmon, sour cream, capers, and red onion) knocked me off my feet the first time I ordered it. Today, it was greasy and the salmon was a little fishy (yes, I know it's fish, but the fishy smell was a little overpowering). \u00a0Last week, while the potato pancake was great, the schnittzle and the rosemary potatoes lacked serious seasoning. Totally bland. Disappointing compared to the previous times we ordered the same dish. On my visit a few weeks ago we received water at the table which is quaintly served in a recycled wine bottle, with two pre- filled glasses of water. The water had been pre-poured into glasses and were sitting on the bar. Now how long they been sitting there I do not know. But the water tasted like it'd been run through the hose in the backyard. Incidentally, the pizza today was a little greasy, too, and the crust was tough. Huge departure from the pizza we've had in the past. Now, I know I may be nitpicking on this next issue, but it bugs the hell out of me. I ordered a large pizza. Half with only cheese, half with pepperoni and pineapple. Where I come from 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. Instead, I was charged for a large cheese pizza +2 toppings (2.50/topping). There was NOT a whole pizza's worth of pepperoni on half the pizza. The waitress asked how everything was, I was polite but honest...even showed her the pool of grease on the potato pancake plate... She didn't seem too concerned, but did say she'd let \"them\" know. That knocked my 3 star down to 2. \u00a0Overall, there's been good days, great food, and some days where the dishes shouldn't have been served. If you want to roll the dice, you might get lucky. But, I've been there four times, and three out the four something wasn't quite right. The place isn't cheap, so if you don't mind dropping 50 for a crap shoot, you might get a winner dish."], ["Rachel H.", "We like their food and atmosphere so much, we've brought both sets of in-laws here for family dinners. The gnocchi, potato pancakes, and the chicken paprikash are our favorites. I really recommend the potato pancakes with the smoked salmon. They even have some Czech beers to try."], ["Gabrielle H.", "My friend and I tried this place out and were blown away! We had pizza and goulash. The goulash melts in your mouth, rolling eyes and smiles. The personal pizza was amazing. The portions are huge! You will detention go home with amazing left overs. Great comfort food! They have a great selection to choose from, something for everyone. Savory. The wait staff is very attentive and knowledgable of the menu. The atmosphere is wonderful, no TVs, light music. There's a small bar, but no rowdiness. Great place to enjoy yourself and have good conversation. I can't recommend it enough!!! I've been twice and have had the same lovely experience."], ["Tiffany Y.", "Czech and Italian food? YES!!! Something I was definitely getting were the potato pancakes and I was not at all disappointed. I usually only have them at the Polish Festival in Roseville which due to how they have to make it, it can be a bit too oily but this place had them surprisingly delicious. So glad I ordered it. Between Italian food and Czech food, I've hadn't Czech food much so I was definitely ordering Czech Specialties. I got their Chicken Paprikash while my boyfriend got their Beef Goulash. Their portions are good healthy portions where you could share an order between 2 people. So we ended up with A LOT of leftovers. Nonetheless they were good leftovers. Our waitress was super friendly. Super friendly and great to have conversations with. She got us another drink pretty quick when it was low or out. Don't have any complains about this place, I'll have to return to try everything else and get some more potato pancakes."], ["Marie D.", "Their pizza is on point!

I am a fan of the gorgonzola gnocchi."], ["Jennifer M.", "Nice atmosphere and good service, but the food was just okay. My husband's beet gnocchi were incredibly dense and huge - I prefer traditional italian light fluffy gnocchi. Also, my scallop dish, which was over $20, only came with about 3 scallops. The rest of the dish was good - including the spinach and risotto, but I would've preferred more scallops, or just larger ones, for the price. Also the apple strudle for dessert wasn't anything that special and I would've preferred it be warmed. Apparently they have good pizza, but we didn't try it. Might come back here to try the pizza but not anytime soon. Excellent beer selection, though."], ["Jonathan B.", "This place is a little hidden treasure on J Street in Sacramento.

In one of the residential streets, you can't park there unless you have a permit. The food came out fast. Service was ok.

I had to turn around and try to make eye contact with her.

I liked it, even though I wished there was more smoked salmon. I can never have too much of that.Tiramisu- Layers of lady finger cookies drenched in coffee and liquor alternated with layers of mascarpone cream cheese.The plate was drizzled with strawberry puree which added a hint of sweetness/tartness.

It is almost impossible to find Czech food done the old school way with Czech beers and wine there too. Hell finding Czech style wine anywhere is tough, but here they serve It for cheap. \u00a0Don't expect it to taste like Silver Oak but fits the Rizek and other meals from Bohemia and Moravia. My favorite is svickova - meat with vegetable cream sauce and knedliky. They carry LEV Black Lion dark beer that is an excellent tmave \u00a0style beer you never see in the USA as well. So you could order italian \u00a0and it looks good but the Czech food is outstanding. Anyone that has visited Czech will not be disappointed. The owner \u00a0Mark is usually there cooking himself.

My husband and I sat at a window seat just inside at dusk. Very romantic!My husband ordered a pizza, which looked fresh and good. It had a sort of middle-of-the-road crust - not deep dish, and not thin crust. Being that I wasn't super hungry, I had just the mixed green salad with olive oil and vinegar. The olive oil was well past its expiration date, and the vinegar was ... very vinegary. I know, not original, but I'm spoiled by my smooth 25-year-aged balsamic at home! I had some of his crust as breadsticks and they were pretty tasty. We ordered vanilla gelato in fresh hot espresso to share as a dessert.Also, I ordered three glasses of wine - one a house white wine and the others a pinot and a zin - and all were just ... whomp whomp ... dull. I think I kept ordering wine, thinking the next glass would be better and make up for the previous, but it didn't happen. I left most of the last one there when we left. Service was aloof and all over the place, but there was one huge table with about 12 people (including one with the LOUDEST voice and laugh I've ever heard - it was so hard to hear anything else!). Still, it took us just over 2 hours for dinner.Seeing such high ratings makes me think I should come back, give it another try, and avoid the wine menu!"], ["Nicole L.", "Okay, so this review is really directed at the pizza and the service, which I've had the pleasure of experiencing multiple times. Even though I've lived close by for a number of years, I've yet to have a proper sit-down meal here. In all fairness, I need to disclose this fact. It's \"on my list\" of places to go, but if you know me, you know that my jetpack is almost always on, so take this review for what it is- for the *delicious* pizza and the service for takeout. The restaurant itself is homey, inviting, and has always been spotlessly clean. It's located next door to a very popular pub, Bonn Lair, and even though Bonn Lair offers a great menu of its own (pasties, fish n chips, curry, etc), Trattoria has a symbiotic relationship with BL, and will deliver delicious pizza next door. Yes. Win. I've only ever had their pizza, which is unbelievably delicious. It's a completely different category from places like One Speed and Hot Italian who offer a traditionally thin-crust Italian style pizza - oh, no, Trattoria gives a thick, delicious, fresh, hot crust that you can really sink your teeth into. Comparing these places is like comparing apples and oranges. Their margarita pizza is heavy on the garlic (YAY!) and they manage to slice some of the most flavorful tomatoes onto their pizza every. single. time. I don't know where they get their tomatoes from, but they're doing it right. I've had the proscuitto/arugala pizza and the combo that includes all the meats as well- both are fantastic. You will NOT go wrong. The thick crust goes well with beer, so if you're afraid of carbs, this place is not for you.Service is outstanding. I offered to walk back over and pick up my pizza, as we were leaving Bonn Lair to hang out back at our house, and the gentleman helping me insisted he bring it over to me. Little things make a huge difference. Thank you.

It was much more tart than American potato salad, but the capers gave it exactly the kick it needed.The chicken paprikash is where it's at.

My other diners' dishes were hits and misses - chicken dishes were just A-okay, the seafood was fresh and flavorful, and the eggplant parmesan was a little different from what we were used to.The complimentary tiramisu (check-in on your Yelp app!) was a whopping portion and very tasty (even though it didn't have rum, because they don't have a hard liquor license). The proportion of whipped cream was a little too much. Panna cotta was underwhelming and lacked a good flavor - give me citrus or berry or anything!Our waitress was really friendly and personable. At times she was a little blunt, but it kind of added to the \"Italian\" atmosphere. Service was quite slow after dinner plates were cleared, and we waited a while for desserts and bill.

The place was full of young waiters who were not very professional and sitting around on their phones, our bread came out cold like it had been in the fridge (no one wants cold bread) and I ordered a margarita pizza that was drowning in so much cheese it was almost unbearable to eat.

Although the tomatoes in the Caprese Plate we ordered were disappointingly flavorless (tasted like those artifically-ripened tomatoes), we both really enjoyed the Lasagna Bolognese.The second visit was less impressive. The service was mostly inattentive. My wife had angel hair pasta with pesto sauce, but the pesto was on the dry and scant side, and we both felt we've honestly made better pesto at home. \u00a0I ordered the Chicken Piatti Picatta which was overly salty, so I personally wouldn't order that again. We thought the decor could benefit from a fresh update, and that the cleanliness of the restaurant and decor could be improved. The dining area just had a worn feeling to it. Last night we thought we'd return to give the restaurant another chance. We had made reservations, showed up on time, and walked up to the hostess table, which was unmanned. However, no less than five staff were running around frantically directly in front of us behind the hostess stand, getting plates and to go orders ready, some of them just looking confused as to what to do. One server was delivering a plate of salad and holding the plate with his finger in the food, which is not sanitary. We stood there at the hostess stand looking at these employees for a long time without anyone even acknowledging our presence. A woman customer who was waiting behind us in line also commented to us about the lack of acknowledgement. A simple \"We'll be right with you\" would have sufficed, but after two full minutes of no eye contact from any of the five employees dancing around only 3-4 feet in front of us (even after I intently stared at them to try to make a point), it was like we were invisible. So we turned around and walked out. We won't be returning, which is too bad because I really wanted to like this place. The management really needs to focus on improving the service. The restaurant advertises themselves as having a \"quiet, romantic atmosphere\", but in our three visits we found it to be neither, with bustling staff, customer noise, and the bright overhead lighting. Their web site says, \"Please relax and enjoy our neighborhood restaurant while we create a dining experience especially for you.\" I'm sorry, but when your employees are running around like frantic chickens with their heads cut off behind the unmanned hostess station when you first walk in, and you're never acknowledged by the staff, it doesn't exactly create a feeling of relaxation or appreciation.Oh, and they had a sign on their door stating that the Entertainment book company had filed for bankruptcy and thus their restaurant is no longer accepting Entertainment coupons. However, a quick Google search the following morning reveals that the company had already been back in business for several days and the coupons should still be valid. We ended up going directly to another local restaurant and they happily accepted their Entertainment coupon.

My coworkers were excited and got me to go. That day they had chocolate chip cookie. Because some lady had ordered 20 of them cookies, they had run out of their first batch so we waited. They gave us a 6 minute timeframe. So we decided to just wait there and chat for a bit for the cookies to come out. 6 minutes passed, \"Give us another 2 minutes.\" Okay, so we waited again. 2 minutes passed, \"Give us another 2 minutes.\" We were getting antsy because we needed to get back to work. One of the workers saw we were still waiting and yelled to one of the girls behind the counter to check on the cookies.What do you know? They were ready! Not sure if it was just a coincidence or...something. Anyways, when we got back to work, I took a bite and wow, delicious! Since it was fresh out of the oven, it was warm. The outer sides were crispy and the inside soft. I got maybe a quarter through it, and all the sugar just hit me. I had to take a break! It's not one of those oreo sized cookies. It's the size of a Mrs. Fields cookie. Huge for $1!Their coffee and pastries are pretty good. If you decide to go on a day with a special item (Tuesdays-hot cookie and Thursdays-$1 and some change for gelato; they have others, but I can't remember them right now) come early because lines can get long and/or they run out.I want to try their restaurant, but looking at their prices, maybe when I earn more money I'll come back. Until then, just coffee and pastries for me.The girls here are always so nice and friendly! It's like Starbucks treatment, but better! Good job!

The appetizer, main course, and dessert was all five stars for us."], ["Vanessa P.", "I am completely in love with this place!My boyfriend threw me a birthday dinner here on 2/7/15 and all my expectations were not only met, but were EXCEEDED! I had my dinner in a private room located towards the back of the restaurant. Walking through the restaurant, the space and ambiance were perfect! Everything was so nicely decorated and clean - especially the bathrooms! My friends were allowed to decorate the space with confetti on the table, balloons, streamers and signs!!! The space was enclosed, which I enjoyed because it was a lot more intimate.As appetizers, they brought out the biggest plates of stuffed mushrooms, calamari and these tiny little pizzas! Everything was absolutely delicious!!! As an appetizer I ordered the cappellacci di zucca (which was ravioli filled with butternut squash and walnuts served with tomato sauce, brown butter, Grana Padano and crispy sage). My order came with 5 heart shaped raviolis! It was perfectly cooked and dressed in a beautiful presentation! I was sooo full from the appetizers that I was only able to eat 2 raviolis! I was so impressed with the attentive staff, amazingly delicious food and fanciness of the restaurant that I would like to hold an upcoming event of my own here! I'm not sure why the lack of 5 star reviews, but I know that I had an amazing experience! This restaurant was the best place I could have celebrated my 30th birthday!"], ["Mary N.", "Came here for Dine Downtown. \u00a0The food was ok but he service was just off. \u00a0We had a reservation but when we arrived, it was clear the hostess was overwhelmed with all of the guests. \u00a0Three other people had to come out to assist her. \u00a0So we had to wait awhile before we were seated.It took quite awhile before anybody came to take our orders. \u00a0My partner and I both ordered wine. \u00a0The wine took a long time to come out. \u00a0The wine didn't come out until we were almost done with the first course. \u00a0This is the first time I've ever had wine brought out after the food was served. \u00a0Really threw off the evening.Then we had to sit around and wait for quite a bit in between the courses. \u00a0I also noticed inconsistencies. \u00a0My salad was quite delightful where as my partner, who ordered the same salad, barely had anything on her plate.The only thing I really enjoyed that was a standout for me was the duck ravioli. \u00a0Very savory with a nice light cream sauce. \u00a0That was a five star dish. \u00a0The rest? \u00a0Unimpressive. \u00a0Perhaps I would feel different if the entire dining experience had been more satisfactory. \u00a0With wine and tip, the bill came out to about $115 for two people and I was quite dissatisfied with the whole experience."], ["Kurt C.", "The night was crisp with a certain aroma begging to be noticed, whispering softly \"Ti adoro.\" I held my lover tight as we rushed across the empty intersection, knowing it would be bustling again at any moment. We shared one last intimate glance as we made our way through the glass doors and into the grand hall...Il Fornaio is located in the building with Wells Fargo - easy to find with an attached garage and validated parking. However, due to our large truck, I had to park across the street. But hey, meters were free on Friday night!This is an Italian restaurant using French cooking techniques and ingredients prepared by Caucasian and Hispanic chefs. That's not a racist statement, it'st just setting the tone for the hobglob of tastes they present.I made reservations before hand, but we still had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated. That's kind of annoying. It took a long time for anyone to take our orders.We did get a complimentary appetizer (Bruschetta) because it was our first time there. We ordered the $35 3 course \"taste of Umbria\" special.Drinks: Lemonade ($4!!!) \u00a0- this was good. They have some flavor syrups as well. These are NOT free refills.Bread (free) - this was really good, but rarely do we dislike free bread!App: Bruschetta (free!) - This was OK. A little heavy on the tomatoes without much else.3 Course Meals ($35 each, with individual pricing as well)Course 1: Porcini mushroom Soup - this was OK. Really just a broth with some stuff in it. OK in flavor, but lacking in substance. My wife didn't care to finish it.Course 1: Polpettine - Meatball dish - this was not the best. There were (maybe) 2 tiny meatballs with a few mushrooms and a LOT of polenta (French cornmeal porridge) which didn't taste that good. There was a bit of sauce, but none of it meshed well together.Course 2: Gnocchi - This tasted good, but there were literally 6 pieces of nickle sized pasta in a plate of garlic sauce. Huge disappointment in serving.Course 2: Cannelloni - This was a seafood pasta that should have stayed in the sea. Again, the flavors just did not mesh well. The pasta on its own was great, but the filling tasted awful, and the sauce had little to no flavor.... a rather long wait before the third course ...Course 3: Rack of Lamb - Another huge disappointment. First, we order this well done, and it came dripping in blood, not only that but it wasn't even warm. What little meat accompanied the bones was tough AND fatty. It had a decent flavor, but you only got about 2 bites of it - maybe a couple more if you forgot the utensils and just went at it hand to mouth. The Yukon potatoes were good, but kind of hard to mess that up. The green beans were OK, if you like whole, plastic-like green beans.Course 3: Rotisserie Duck - This was about the only thing I really enjoyed. The serving of duck was huge; I will be having that on a sandwich for a couple of days. Although, to be honest, it had little flavor separating it from a cheap chicken breast. Great potatoes and spinach as well.... a very long wait before desert ...Desert: Fondente ai Tre Cuori ($12.60!!) - Dark Chocolate flourless cake with white chocolate and berry glaze. The cake was OK, but was fairly bitter, even for dark chocolate. Great presentation, but lacking in real flavor. The glaze was good, but the white chocolate was off-putting. Desert : Tiramisu (Free, because ours took so long to bring out, normally $8.79) - We don't drink coffee, nor do we like it ground on cakes, but this was brought to us for free, so I tried it. After scraping the top coffee off, it was OK. I saw other people really enjoying it. Total Bill after tax (pre-tip): $108. And we don't drink alcohol, so use who do will have a much bigger bill.We were here for over 2 hours, and not because we wanted to be. Only 30 minutes was spent actually eating, it just took that long to get everything.Also, this place is trying to be classy, but it is too loud and bright with too many people there dressed incredibly casually to achieve this effect. On that note, stop bringing your young children to these places. They DO NOT LIKE THE FOOD!All in all, I cannot recommend this place. The building is beautiful and the staff was friendly (one of the hostess sang \u00a0a beautiful happy birthday aria to someone), but the food is way overpriced and lacking in real quality or flavor. Disappointing all around."], ["Tika D.", "We have been here a few times and it has been a pleasant experience each time. This place is classy and beautiful and the atmosphere is wonderful.

After everyone placed their orders we sat on the patio to dine AL fresco. \u00a0It was a perfect evening for al fresco dining as the night temperature had cooled down and a plesant breeze was blowing. \u00a0 Something that I love about Pronto is the scale--you don't feel like you're in a huge restaurant. \u00a0Its small, cozy, and \u00a0very new bohemian. \u00a0A perfect way to introduce the charm of Midtown Sacramento to a bunch of Texans. \u00a0For my main dish, I ordered the Buffalo Blue salad. \u00a0It was made with fresh greens , red radicchio, chopped apples, sliced boneless buffalo wings, walnuts, and crumbled blue cheese. \u00a0What a fresh blend. \u00a0My dad ordered a plate of spaghetti with marinara sauce, and mom ordered the macaroni stroganoff. \u00a0I sipped my red wine while we all sampled the appetizers. The fried ravioli was nice and hot, but not in a \"burn the tongue\" kinda way. \u00a0They were filled with fresh spinach and white cheese (possibly mozzarella.) \u00a0The Tai chili fries were also outstanding. \u00a0My dad told me he wasn't a fan of spicy sweet fries so I encouraged him to step out of his box and give them a try...after all that's what you do when on holiday--right?When he tried the fries he said he wasn't a fan. \u00a0I said that's okay at least you tried and now you know. \u00a0We continued to eat and drink and talk while waiting for our food, I noticed, out of the corner of my eye, my dad grabbing \u00a0scoop after scoop of the fries. I guess he liked them afterall but I didn't say anything. \u00a0Within 5 minutes our food arrived. \u00a0Guess that's why they are called Pronto. \u00a0My salad was quite large and I dug right in. \u00a0It was outstanding. \u00a0Dad's spaghetti was not overcooked but lacked oregano and I had to fetch the oregano, cheese and pepper shakers so he could spruce it up a bit. \u00a0I was given a sample of the macaroni stroganoff. \u00a0It was not overcooked, perfec al dente, and the onions and sour cream made a nice touch. \u00a0Overall this meal provided the perfect amount of comfort my family was needing. \u00a0Pronto makes good Italian dishes and has some interesting appetizers. \u00a0The Tai Chili Fries are yummy, and you need to try them. \u00a0Then Why 3 stars???Well the service was just OK. \u00a0When we went to the patio to find a table all the open tables were dirty and we stood and waited for them to be bussed. \u00a0When it was evident that nobody was gong to bus the tables, I walked back up to the register and politely asked if a busboy would be able to wipe the tables so we could be seated. Again we stood and waited for several minutes before anyone showed up with a towel. \u00a0This was a very awkward \u00a0as my family was tired of being on their feet and they were hungry. \u00a0And that is the only downfall I have with Pronto otherwise the food is very good."], ["Elise C.", "Finally An Italian Place That I Actually Like.

I also got a cup of the self-serve Java City coffee (oh how I miss that place!). My boyfriend ordered the cornmeal blueberry pancakes. \u00a0He didn't like them at all. I think using cornmeal in pancakes is definitely an aquired taste. \u00a0It's a totally different texture and flavor than the usual fluffy, flour-laden buttermilk kind...imagine a giant, flat, blueberry cornbread muffin. \u00a0Now add some syrup.Since it's one of those order and pay at the counter-get a number-find a table-we'll bring your food to you-places, I didn't expect too much table service.

Order at the counter, sit and eat or take it to go. The price points may edge toward the high side but you get a lot of food and most selections will leave you patting your belly in utter satisfaction. Their pasta dishes are rich--probably a tad more richness than any single human needs in one meal--and hearty appetites will be thankful. Highlights include the baked pasta and the pork fusilli. Eat it. Take a nap. Have sweet dreams.There are a couple of terrific sandwiches on the menu. I'll direct you here to the Turino Panini. The bread and everything in between will have you making those involuntary happy eater noises. Mmmmm. Mmm. Mmmmmmmmm. You know.My current menu fav is the Farmer's Market Salad. As Barbara S. will attest, this is the perfect blend of all that is good and pure. Savory gratification is provided by roasted chicken coated in tarragon dressing and it's followed by a punch of sweetness from dates that have no doubt been supplied by some alien civilization with highly advanced culinary skills. There is no other explanation for their flavor. That also explains how the cornbread croutons are crisp on the outside and ever-so-slightly doughy inside. They are not of this earth.Luckily, Pronto can be found on terra firma. We should all be grateful for that.

I love the Farmer's Market salad and have tried the Carribean Salmon salad, but since I always crave the Farmer's Market salad, I am hesitant to ever order anything else here. I've also had some of their paninis, pasta dishes, and polenta bowls, but the salads are what bring me back. I've also had brunch here, which isn't nearly as good as their lunch/dinner choices. I much prefer the cornbread croutons to the cornbread pancakes. In fact, on a meatless Friday, I opted for more croutons instead of the chicken in the Farmer's Market salad, and I might make that a more frequent add-on, even when I do eat the salad with chicken. The crunchy texture of the croutons and their honey-sweet flavors pair so well with the dates, but really, everything in the salad adds very complementary flavors. Plus, they're really generous with the avocado, which is awesome! It's kind of cool how you can also order pizza from Uncle Vito's right next door. I got the tomato pesto pizza, and not only was the slice gigantic but it was also delicious. The food here is always fresh and service is fairly quick. The only complaint is one time, my boyfriend had to inquire multiple times about the beer he ordered, but that was a one-time-thing.

The girl at the register was nice and knowledgeable. The menu is short and sweet. A few items in each category. Omelettes, scrambles, sandwiches etc. I really had my mind made up on the Italian scramble, until I glanced over and noticed that they have Italian Benedicts on special. No hesitation, I'm a sucker for eggs benedict. The eggs were poached beautifully over tomatoes, Prosciutto and Pugliese bread instead of the normal English muffin. The eggs were cut into the the yummy yolk spilled out like lava from a volcano. Perfectly poached eggs. The tomato and Prosciutto were lovely accomplices to the dish, especially that Prosciutto. Amazing flavor there my friends. The bread was buttery, so it felt like it was melting in my mouth. Total foodgasm. The breakfast potatoes were seasoned nicely and cooked perfectly. I was also able to try some of Terri's dish. She had the pork scramble so I was a little excited. Though it didn't look like much, I personally thought it tasted quite well. I didn't get much of the pork sadly, but the eggs mush was good, and a bit spicy. The one server I saw, who brought ours and everyone else's food didn't look very happy or friendly. He didn't say anything when dropping our plates off. Plus he seemed to do just that, drop our plates, onto the table. Overall though, I thought the place was pretty awesome.

The muddled orange added an interesting layer to the drink.The table ordered a round of starters.Starters Steak tare tare - well balanced, finely diced, excellent flavor. Was a little odd to eat it with pomme frites (fries) instead of toast points, but still delicious. Oysters - I dont know which oyster we had, but they were fresh, sweet, briny, and the mignonette was well done.Antipasti - Very balanced platter of charcuterie meats, cheeses, crostini with white bean hummus, and cheese.Sweetbreads - saut\u00e9ed with an excellent sauce. Entr\u00e9e I ordered the house special, the bouillabaisse. It had a really lovely layered broth. The wine, tomato, spices and herbs were so complicatary to the squid, fish, clams, and mussels. All were perfectly cooked...very excellent fishermans stew.Two of my friends ordered the Portuguese pork and clams. Uhhh the broth was soooo good. We all thought it was weird that it came with fries too. But again, still delicious. Another person in my group ordered the parpadelle pasta with lamb and chantrelle mushrooms. I tried a bite and it had a really nice umami flavor. All in all everyone enjoyed themselves and we had a really lovely time.

The menu is simple but still plenty of options if you're a choosy eater. We went for the deviled eggs, antipasto plate, and bruschetta to start off. The bruschetta was very delicious. But the best appetizer: melon proscuitto- drizzled with balsamic vinegar. Who knew cantaloupe with taste so good with a savory meat?? For my main course I went with the ricotta filled ravioli special, topped with bacon and a poached egg. Ravioli, bacon, AND a poached egg?! You can't go wrong with that.

My friends treated me to a birthday dinner, which consisted of the most delicious scallops I have ever had in my life, accompanied by a crisp glass of rose. I also tried the steak tartare-- it was to die for. All of the ingredients seemed extremely fresh and of great quality. I started recommending this restaurant left and right, specifically the scallops. Unfortunately, after my second time here, I was extremely disappointed. I ordered the same entree, and couldn't get through half of my meal. The scallops were a little overcooked (not a big deal), but the way they smelled and the texture of the meat left me with no appetite. Thankfully my date shared his meal with me, which was a succulent cut of lamb with a hearty potato puree, and perfectly roasted heirloom tomatoes. Aside from the scallop mishap, the atmosphere of this restaurant, the friendly staff, and the quality of most of their ingredients leave me hopeful.

The service we received from our waiter was great though. We started off with the 5 Dot Ranch Steak Tartare. I was looking forward to eating this more than anything else. It's one of their signature dishes. It was so delicious that I could've eaten the whole thing by myself! The menu may not look extensive, but they also had several specials. I went with the Mixed Grill- lamb, pancetta, and sweetbread with saut\u00e9ed greens and polenta. It was my first time trying sweetbread (thymus or the pancreas). I'm not sure which animal it came from. The food was tender enough that we didn't have to do a lot of chewing. I cleaned my plate as did everyone else in my group. We shared several desserts. The best part of the Apple Crostada was the brown sugar-pecan ice cream. Cr\u00e8me Brulee is one of my favorite desserts. Theirs was served in a shallow and wide dish, so there was a lot of burnt sugar. My favorite dessert was the Pot de Cr\u00e8me. Salted caramel anything is usually a win.

You won't regret it!"], ["Jessica D.", "The food was amazing and our waiter, Andrew, was excellent. We started with the Antipasto. The hummus was delicious- had a nice kick to it and bell peppers.

However, sometimes its worth the drive to venture out of my normal dining zone. And since this place is still within the Sacramento city limits (more along the lines of being in the Antelope/North Highlands area), I figured why not give it a try? Which takes us on a trip up Interstate 80 to a \"Taste of Tuscany\".Located on Roseville Road and close to Antelope Road, a \"Taste of Tuscany\" is definitely a hidden gem. At first glance, you would never even think this place existed. I sure didn't until I saw a high number of positive Yelp reviews. Once I glanced at the photos, prices, and reviews, I knew I just had to give this place a shot.I came here on a late-Sunday afternoon with my fianc\u00e9e and our friend for what would be an early dinner. Parking was a breeze as no matter what time of day, you should never have a problem finding a close spot. Once we entered the building, we are pleasantly surprised by the aromatic flavors of garlic, basil, and oregano. It definitely smelled like my mom's kitchen as it had that distinct Italian feel to it. And the inside was fairly spacious with several tables that can accommodate large parties. There was also an impressive wine collection and several TV's for viewing the games.One key thing that we particularly liked about a \"Taste of Tuscany\" was the service. It was top-notch as our server was quick, prompt, and very helpful. The menu itself offered a wide variety of options; everything such as your traditional pastas and even several pizzas, salads, calzones, and sandwiches. As I wasn't craving anything as filling as a pasta dish, I decided to order their \"Turkey Pesto Delight Sandwich\" (for $6.49). This included their signature turkey breast meat complete with homemade pesto, mozzarella cheese, light mayonnaise, tomatoes, and baby greens all nestled in warm focaccia bread. I also opted for a side salad (for $2.99) with Italian dressing to complete my order.The first thing to come out was warm cheesy bread that absolutely hit the spot. Our server was also include complimentary marinara and alfredo sauce. And once the three of us devoured the cheesy bread, she brought out a 2nd at no charge! The best part of this was that once we were done eating the bread, our main entrees came shortly thereafter! My sandwich was a very generous size. The bread tasted as if was just baked while the mozzarella cheese was oozing out to perfection. And the turkey breast had the right about of substance while being moist yet flavorful. In fact, this entire sandwich was too much for me to finish as I took my 2nd half to-go.I will say, trying a place off the beaten path definitely was worth the drive. The prices are lower than anywhere you would find in Midtown Sacramento and Roseville while the overall quality of the food was above average. The only reason why I didn't rate this 5-stars was that the food was a tad bit on the salty side. Not a big deal but the portions didn't skimp at all. I will try a \"Taste of Tuscany\" again as some of their signature pizzas look like they'd be well worth trying. Definitely a good find!"], ["Erick L.", "This italian spot is ridiculously good! My favorite EVER."], ["Lewis V.", "A horrible experience...I had read many great reviews online for this restaurant. I am a lover of good Italian food, so I decided to take my wife out to dinner here. When we arrived, it was busy. I usually take that as a good sign, as it means people like the place. We were sat outside on the patio, since the restaurant itself was full, and we knew immediatly there would be issues.First, the smell. The building must be located next to a sewer line, or something like that, because the smell in the air was awfull. I am not \u00a0exagerating when I say that it made us lose our appitite.Next, we waited around 10-15 minutes to have our drink orders/ meal orders taken. A little long, but I was willing to forgive this if the meal was good. The meal never came. We both ordered pasta dishes, which, even on a busy night, should not take long to cook and serve. We waited for 45 minutes. So from the time we arrived, to the time my wife and I got up and left, we had wasted an hour of our night. When we left, I offered to pay for our drinks, and the manager got very upset with us. She was very defensive and acted like we were being totally out of line. She told us to forget about the drinks, and then we left. What a rough experience.I would like to think that maybe we just had a bad experience, and that it is not the norm at this location. Who knows. I wont be back to find out though.UPDATE: I have moved my rating up by one star. I was contacted by ownership, and I was very impressed by their efforts to make my experience better.

We decided on this place because it's pretty close to Sac State. Very convenient. We came in around noon and the place was pretty empty. Only a few tables were occupied and there was a group of about 5 ahead of us waiting to order. The dining area is huge and there is additional outdoor seating with about 8-10 tables. Looking over the menu, we decided on the \"$5.99 Lunch Special\" that includes two slices of pizza (from a list of about 6 varieties) and a drink. You also have the option of replacing a slice for a side salad. It took a little over 5 minutes to get to the front of the line and place our orders. I chose the \"pizza pie\" (fancy name for cheese pizza) and a side salad with ranch. It came to about $6.50 and the server walked it out to us within minutes.I was pleasantly surprised by the salad. It was much larger than expected and good quality. The greens weren't soggy and the vegetables were crisp. The ranch was thick and garlicky - perfect for dipping your pizza crust into! The pizza was very basic. Nothing special. (Hence the ranch-dipping). I appreciated that it was light on the sauce and cheese. The crust was thin and crispy but the first half of it was nearly burnt. The upper half was perfect though. Overall the food was pretty standard fare. Nothing blew me away. The service was a little slow at first and not really inviting or friendly. Just average. The outdoor tables could use a cleaning. Very dusty and sticky. I think this place probably has a different vibe in the evening so I look forward to coming back and trying out something new at that time. For now I'm giving 3 stars because my lunch experience and the food was just mediocre."], ["kathy p.", "Love the Little Italy pizza. \u00a0Great beer on tap so it's a winner!"], ["William L.", "Solid thin crust pizza. Accommodating employees, good knowledge of pizza and their business.No fresh parmesan, honey or cloth napkins... Without the clutch little extras I would call their prices 15% high for a counter service pizza joint. Considering the quality pizza, the fact that they have multiple IPAs on tap, \"with\" the above mentioned, I would give em a strong 4star."], ["Mallory A.", "The good: the pizza (yum) and the entertainment (shoutout to the crying drunk lady on the patio... hope your night got better) The bad: it took us 15 minutes just to order, and there were only 2-3 people ahead of us. They were also clearly understaffed. Don't come here if you're in a hurry. If you're not, check it out!"], ["ML H.", "So done with Giovanni's. \u00a0Very poor service, long wait, insufficient management, and mediocre food. \u00a0The Broccoli Rabe was overcooked and a very sparse portion for the price.The pizza itself had soggy crust that did not support average quality toppings.The staff forgot to make our kids' pizza, and then delivered it burned and 20 minutes late without the slightest explanation or apology. When we tried to locate an actual manager, we found only inexperienced staff and no leadership or accountable persons in sight. \u00a0Bad business model.This was a very disappointing experience. \u00a0What's worse, our family subsequently visited the Land Park location at lunchtime, hoping to have a better experience. \u00a0Incredulously, they again forgot to bring out our kids' pizza, and then totally made excuses or shunned responsibility until we insisted on some type of compensation for our horrible experience. \u00a0For a place that purports to cater to families and children, there is absolutely no awareness of the needs of families with small children. \u00a0The adults had to wait 20 minutes for the kid pizza to come out, and in the meantime allow the specialty pizza to either get cold or eat in front of hungry kids.We will not return."], ["Julie S.", "This is a great place to get a real New York slice in the beautiful California sunshine. As a native New Yorker, I fully support this pizza. I like the pizza. Pizza. Pizza. Pizza."], ["Erin K.", "This place is a true pizzeria. The wings are phenominal, great beer selection and good honest service. We had a plain ol' pepperoni (medium), 10 wings, and a pitcher of Pintail Pail Ale for 40 bucks. Wish they had more tv's, would for sure come back to enjoy football on Sundays."], ["Cassie B.", "Discovered this place by accident. I love it and brought my east cost boyfriend to check it out. He says that the atmosphere and the pizza remind him of home. This is becoming our new favorite pizza place. So glad we discovered you guys and your tasty pies."], ["Juliane Yelp T.", "Finallyy,, I found NY pizza in sacramento. \u00a0After 17 yrs in Citrus Heights and many pizza dissapointments I stumbled upon Giovanni's . NO MORE . \u00a0THis place is run by a Brooklyn X-Pat. \u00a0Did I tell you the Cannoli's are to die for!!! My NEW favorite place. \u00a0Good thing they are not closer because I would LIVE here"], ["Tom S.", "Laughter is all I can say. Maybe I ordered the terd pie because that's what it tastes like. This is definitely not the spot that took Pizza Hut out of the equation."], ["Manny G.", "I love this pizza. Great customer service. \u00a0The salads are great also although they used to be much bigger."], ["Ayeron D.", "Just your regular, no frills, basic pizza. Nothing to write home about. Ambiance is okay. A bit dated. They got a TV with sports on, beer and some arcade games so...meh. It's a bit overpriced but whatever. Just got a pepperoni pizza and some beer. Crunchy crust. A little over cooked. I'd come back, but only if someone else was buying."], ["Mark S.", "One or the best pizza places in Sacramento. \u00a0They have a 2 slice pizza deal for lunch with a soda for $5.99.  \u00a0Just like your typical pizza from New York. The place is clean and has tons of seating. Free refills that you get on your own - which is a plus.  \u00a0And the ambience is just like an authentic pizza joint. Highly recommend coming here for lunch."]]}
