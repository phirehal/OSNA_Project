The blend of flavors is just right. Good mix of textures with the crispy pita, the tang of the sauces, the flavor of fresh herbs and well-cooked chicken... it's a winner. I'm not sure if I was dealing with the owner or manager when I went last, but he not only welcomed my check-in offer... but he applied to the whole meal instead of just my appetizer. Pretty cool gesture!My only gripe here is that the rest of the food doesn't seem to have the creative flair of the nachos. It's still all good, but just not as exciting. Maybe I'll discover something new as I explore the menu, but I'll have a hard time distancing myself from the already beloved plate of nachos."], ["Chetna J.", "The food was good. Their mediterranean nachos are a must try."], ["Becky H.", "This place used to be a favorite. The Mediterranean nachos were so delicious and flavorful! But the service here is awful. I mean awful!! We ordered 5 dishes, we only ever received three of them. The other two never showed up. When our bill showed up, they were on there though! The bathroom here is beyond gross. The vinyl is peeling away from the wall and mold is growing between. If you decide to brave this place for the nachos, GET TAKE OUT. Do not eat in the place!!!!"], ["Latda V.", "I came here for the first time because I was in the neighborhood and I love it! It's a little hard to find since it's located in the far corner in a shopping complex on Fulton. Just look for the sign when you're driving!I ordered the Mediterranean nachos and a side of greek salad. It was so freakin good! The nachos were delish! Fried pita chips with chicken, lettuce, tomatoes with the yougurt sauce...so good! Perfect for sharing too. Staff is friendly too. He asked us if it's our first time and told us to if we have any questions to feel free and ask him. I likes :)This place is inexpensive and serves great food. Spent only $12 for the nachos and salad. I can't wait to go back! Sucks that I live so far but this place is so worth the drive! :)"], ["Rick M.", "Zero Stars. \u00a0Never eat here or get take out. My wife got food poisoning off of the Mediterranean nachos. Should've known something was up when I walked in to pick up the food that there was going to be an issue. \u00a0This place barely even resembles a restaurant as the dining room was unorganized with chairs littered about, there was no hostess, no silverware, no wait staff, no ambiance, no nothing. \u00a0Just a room with a empty tables and chairs.

The falafel, gyro meat wrap, and chicken Mediterranean nachos were very very good. The place itself is different. It was like visiting a different county which was kind of unique and nice, but where there are different decor and ambience standards. Also different style in customer service. We were a little nervous being the only 2 there, but overall it was good. I think their customer service could use the most work; I did for a minute feel like an ignorant American with too harsh of corrections.

We walked in and was greeted and seated right away. \u00a0Great customer service!Food was delicious. I wanted to try everything on the menu because everything looked so delicious, but I ordered the Mujadara, Meditteranean Nachos (since that was the fuss about this place) and the tabouli and spinach pasta salad. Sadly they were out of the tabouli and the pasta salad, so the owner came to apologize. I was shocked because I'm very patient and I told the owner it wasn't necessary for her to apologize.I will be coming back to try MORE!!"], ["Karla Marie D.", "I can't believe this Fresh Medi is so close to my place. I love Mediterranean food!! I had Sam's Mediterranean Cuisine in Davis and I totally love it!!I had the Chicken Shwarma Entree ($8). It had salad and some sort of noodles, chopped into small pieces and chicken. Usually, I would have it with rice, but the alternative was equally delicious. The chicken was seasoned well. I mixed everything together and topped it with the Tahini sauce. The dish is a little spicy. The only thing I would change is the portion size. I wish they would give a little bit more.Overall, delicious!

We wished we'd gotten a bigger size. Good affordable prices for the nice ambience they provide. \u00a0When we went, it was a little bit before closing on a Friday night but they accidentally had their open sign off and I assume that was the reason no one was in there. They were preparing to close but when I stated that they're supposed to be open for another hour, they were quick to seat us, even though we told them it was ok and we'd go somewhere else. The service was great, and I loved the cook's attitude. We got a chance to talk to him when he stepped out and he was the most pleasant, good-hearted man. Between the yummy, cost-effective food and the decor/ambience and hospitality, I was sold!"], ["Andy J.", "Good lordt, it was tasty. \u00a0Fast, friendly service. \u00a0Delicious fresh food that's super vegetarian friendly. \u00a0Great prices, and a Yelp deal to boot. \u00a0I will certainly be back!"], ["Aaron K.", "Mediterranean nachos with chicken were excellent! \u00a0All the ingredients on the nachos were fresh and a nice compliment to the pita chips.

We seated ourselves since we didn't see anyone by the door. Food was relatively inexpensive, but there is not much of an ambience. Our server was a friendly young lady.I had the gyro plate which came with a good portion of gyros, rice, pita bread, spicy sauce and salad. Everything was good except for the salad which was wilted and not fresh. The chicken shawarma plate which my husband had was mediocre though. It didn't have the Mediterranean spicy taste, but again good portions."], ["Elizabeth C.", "I wanted to try out Cafe Europa but they were closed on Sunday, so I opted for this place instead and I am so happy that I did! The place was clean and simple with barely any decor. \u00a0The restaurant was very quiet. Our server was very attentive and friendly. I ordered the chicken kabob pita and my boyfriend ordered the ground beef pita. We both split a small order of the mediterranean nachos because I read so many reviews on yelp raving about them. We requested eggplant but they didn't have eggplant so we opted for the shawarma chicken instead. The nachos were delicious! This place has the BEST taziki sauce that I even asked for an extra side of it. The shawarma chicken was delicious, flavorful, and slightly spicy! My chicken pita was also really good but i would probably order the shawarma chicken pita next time just because it was more flavorful. My boyfriend seemed happy with his ground beef pita but I think he would probably order something else next time. The cost of these two pitas and a small nacho order for $20 bucks! What a deal!Only small complaint is that it did take a while for us to get our check. If i was in a hurry I would be more annoyed, but I was so happy and content with our food that I didn't let this ending ruin my experience. Overall, try this place! My boyfriend is a picky eater and doesn't usually like ethnic foods and he loved this place. And be sure to try the nachos! There's a reason why everyone raves about them on here! I will definitely be back to get a larger order of the nachos but since the restaurant environment is definitely lacking, my boyfriend and I agreed that we will probably opt for take-out rather than dine-in next time."], ["Bayan A.", "Food was great and the service was good.

As many have mentioned before me, the Mediterranean Nachos are not to be missed. They are a unique treat and are absolutely delicious.

The falafel was plain horrible - definitely not homemade or fried onsite.

Service however was good."], ["Scott W.", "The food is delicious and authentic. I found myself getting a little impatient with the service (especially when they were late with the fries on our order) but I'm not beyond recognizing that for good food you sometimes have to wait.

We are picky. And each of us, has a different idea of what the food should taste like. \u00a0For me, if you say you're giving me greek salad, I want a lemon dressing with it, not a vinegar one. \u00a0That's just how I have always had it... but who knows? I've never been to greece itself. I've had it in Iran, and in Turkey. \u00a0so, I'm not basing my review on that. \u00a0This place is clean, and has a very friendly service. I like their greek fries which come with feta and lemon and parsley. \u00a0I really, really do like the fries. \u00a0They could be more golden and crusty, but really are quite fine just the way they are. \u00a0I also have tried their rice pilaf... not my thing. \u00a0It was cooked well, but I didn't really like the seasoning. The chicken kabob was a bit too dry for me, and I wouldn't order it again. \u00a0The lamb kabob was ok, but the pieces are small, and a little tough (over cooking lamb does that), but I would give the lamb another try. \u00a0I really did like the flavor on it, so I think next time, I'll just order lamb. The prices here are pretty fair. I guess having the terrible location (as mentioned in some of the other reviews), allows them to keep their prices low, so no complaints about the location here."], ["Kelly M.", "This is such a Sacramento gem!I absolutely loved this place. It is completely unassuming and in a shopping center near Nordstrom Rack, but the food was not disappointing.First off, the service was great. \u00a0The gentleman who took our order was so polite and responsive.

We participated in a special brunch just for club members last Sunday. Upon arrival to this small but sparkling-clean restaurant just shy of the Howe-Bout-Arden center, guests were treated to heaping plates of pork sausage called Loukaniko topped with fresh herbs and lemon juice; fresh chickpea Hummus; yogurt and cucumber Tzatziki; warm Pita bread; rice-stuffed grape leaves called Dolmas; Calamata olives and Pepperoncinis. Many Epicureans commented that the Dolmas and Hummus were among the best they'd ever tasted. Owner Taky Cazanis provided diners with some background on Cafe Europa's history reaching back to 1981. Continuing the tradition started by his parents in Arden Fair Mall (when it was only one story), Taky opened the current location in 2010. Staffed by family and drawing from longstanding recipes, diners could sense and taste the pride as Taky concluded his history by saying \"Thank you for coming to my house.\"In short order, the buffet styled main courses were brought out- beef and lamb Gyro; white wine and lemon marinated grilled Chicken Breast, Green salad with olives, tomatoes and feta; Rice pilaf; savory green beans stewed in a tomato, olive oil and onion broth called Fasolakia and more warm Pita bread. The once lively conversation fell to a murmur as Epicureans thoroughly enjoyed the Greek cuisine. As conversation picked back up, Taky invited guests to come back for seconds, then passed around plates of decadent butter cookies topped with mountains of powdered sugar known as Kourambietha. After reviewing the chalkboard of daily lunch specials ranging from Greek Cheeseburgers to Pastrami and even Mizithra spaghetti, many Epicureans left Cafe Europa already planning their next visit. \u00a0The well-executed traditional Greek fare and family-friendly atmosphere make Cafe Europa truly delightful and worthy of the Sacramento Epicureans \"hidden secret\" status.

They've obviously minimized portions on the menu. Ordered what I believe was a platter which came with gyro meat, salad or rice, and pita bread. Gyro meat portion was much smaller but very good, pita bread was dry, and the lettuce in the salad was not appetizing or edible. How much more can it be to use a little Romaine instead of hard, thick, chunky, white portions of iceberg lettuce. If you're going to do that at least shred the lettuce. I have to say the additions to the salad were fresh and very tasty though. Husband was also very disappointed in his gyro due to the dry pita bread, but he said the fries were good.

Of course it was Tuesday and the lunch special on Wednesday was the falafel pita. Oh well.

They left me wishing I had some ketchup.The falafel pita sandwich was good, it was pita bread filled with 6 pieces of falafel, lettuce and cucumber (I requested no tomatoes but it usually comes with it). The falafel were a little on the crispy side and could have used more flavor, but the tzatziki sauce was good and made it not so dry.I did enjoy my meal, and would come back again if I was in the area or other people wanted to go.

I ordered a lamb/beef gyro sandwich with Greek fries and a drink. The price was fair and the service fast. The food arrived hot and fresh and tasted outstanding. The veggies were crisp and fresh and the meat was tender and moist. I appreciated that theTzatziki sauce was on the side; this allowed me to choose how much I wanted on my sandwich. The tzatziki sauce, however, was delicious and was even worthy of dipping a few of my fries in. \u00a0Hubby's meal was also pleasing to the eyes and tastebuds. My only complaint is a little odd...The floor, throughout the establishment was unusually slick.

I didn't get to ask what kind of meat it was, but it was seasoned well and tasty. The sandwich is also stuffed with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, potato FRIES, cheese and a side of Tzatziki sauce. Tzatziki is a Greek sauce that is yogurt base and mixed with some seasonings.

The chicken kabob sandwich was so delicious. The chicken pieces were super juicy, not overdone and the sandwich as a whole was really delicious.

Located on Howe Ave. in a smaller strip-mall (than neighboring \"Howe Bout Arden\"), this place can be a tad bit tricky to find unless you know exactly where it is. Fortunately the parking lot always has an abundance of empty spots so there is never a need to hunt down a spot to park.I've been to Caf\u00e9 Europa at least a dozen times simply because of exceptional service, quality of food, and close proximity to my home. I've dined here alone, I've dined here with my lovely lady, and now I am dining here with fellow Yelp friends Todd G. (with his daughter) and Devo S. We all meet for lunch around 1:30pm as the dining area has a few tables occupied but overall it is not too busy at all. And as I mentioned how great the service is here, the owner actually remembered me from nearly a year ago! He was very polite and had a great positive attitude which already made this experience a very welcome one.For those of you that have dined here, the inside is very no-frills. There are basic tables for dining complete with wood paneling throughout the counter and walls. You will also find a small flat screen TV as well as a giant mirror in the dining area that gives you that illusion that the restaurant is bigger than it really is. But enough about me talking about the inside, let's get on with how their food is!As I've already tried their Kabob entrees, falafels, and Greek salads, I've actually never had their gyros. And I don't why I waited so long! After seeing many positive reviews on their gyros, I give in and order the \"Beef/Lamb Gyro\" (for $6.25). The gyro itself includes large seasoned slices of meat in a warm pita pocket and is completed with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and their signature Tzatziki sauce. And for only $2.99 more, I opt for a side of regular French fries and a pink lemonade.My meal comes out in less than 7 minutes and this thing is loaded with meat! The Tzatziki sauce comes on the side which is a nice touch. And the gyro, well let's just say that It is so big, I only wonder how am I going to pick it up and eat it without making too much of a mess? Well I successfully took my first bite and was literally in gyro-heaven. The portions and seasonings they use in the beef/lamb was tender and cooked to absolute perfection. The warm pita bread was absolutely heavenly while the lettuce and onions created a nice crunch to every savory bite.Overall, Caf\u00e9 Europa is my #1 go-to spot for some amazing Greek food in the Sacramento area. The portions are generous, the food is amazing, and the prices are very reasonable. If you're looking for a no-frills restaurant that packs some amazing Mediterranean flavor, look no further because Caf\u00e9 Europa is the place to come!"], ["Devo S.", "I was in the Arden-Arcade area, and decided I wanted to have dinner someplace I hadn't eaten before. Naturally, I turned to Yelp, because I'm not completely familiar with all the dining options in the area. Cafe Europa caught my eye because I had previously bookmarked this place, AND its average Yelp rating is 4.5 stars, which is amazing. So, I headed on over to the strip mall on Howe, where that mongolian bbq place that's been there FOREVER still is. For all the great reviews, I was surprised to see the place empty on a Saturday. I still forged ahead, and was greeted by the sweetest older gentleman. I perused the amazing menu, and settled on a beef/lamb gyro sandwich, to which I added a greek salad and diet coke. The older gentleman went into the back, I guess to make my order, and out came a just-as-nice younger gentleman, who was talking to the older gentleman in Greek. Pretty sure it was Greek. Which, honestly, made me anticipate my food was gonna be pretty damn authentic.Anyway, out came my salad and drink first. Nicely sized salad with all the right stuff, plus the dressing was on the side...nice touch!. The younger guy really wanted to make sure I was comfortable, and let me know that I could have the TV channel switched to whatever I liked, and if it was too cold he would shut the front door (no worries on that since it was still in the mid-70s at that time of the day, even though it was dark outside). Plus, which I found endearing, he called me \"dear\" and \"honey\" at the end of every conversation. So nice :)My gigantic, filled-to-the-gills gyro sandwich was brought out, and I was uber-impressed. It was just piled high with flavorful mounds of gyro meat, lettuce, and onions in a warm, soft pita bread. It was the biggest gyro sandwich I've ever seen, and it was DELICIOUS! I like that they put the tzatziki sauce on the side, too. I like Opa!Opa! and Greek Village Inn (side note: drove by there last night after shopping at Safeway and noticed it was closed...they're not out of business, are they?), but I have to say that Cafe Europa is probably going to be my go-to place for Greek food for a while. In fact, looking forward to coming back for lunch with Hubby on Veteran's Day so he can experience how good the food is here. Do yourself a favor and try this place, too! It very much deserves the high rating it has :) Yassou, my friends!"], ["Catherine G.", "The juiciest, most flavorful lamb beef gyro I've had in CA. Far superior to Petra's. The feta cheese they use must be laced with crack, because I inhale my salad, not eat it. The service is also on point.

It's not the most impressive restaurant, but it's clean and the food is great.So far, I visited twice. On both occasions the individual taking our order at the counter was courteous and extremely professional. One of my dining companions asked about the gyro meat. The gentleman gave us a lengthy and informative explanation as to why they use a 90/10 ratio of beef and lamb. He is also familiar with the other major Greek restaurants in the area, and gave us some suggestions on what to order if we visit them.The place itself is not fancy. You order at a counter and they bring the food to you once it's ready. The prices are reasonable.I've tried the Supreme Gyros and the Greek Salad.Supreme Gyros - Pita bread packed to the gills with thinly cut gyro, a few fries, various veggies, feta, and a side of Tzatziki sauce. I would say it's a tad overfilled, making it difficult to get a taste of everything in a single bite. The contents of the pita tend to fall out into the sandwich wrapper as you are eating. All the produce tasted fresh, and the gyro meat was delicious. I didn't think the fries really added any flavor or texture as there weren't that many of them stuffed inside. Giving the Tzatziki on the side is an extremely smart move. You can continually add it to the top of whatever part of the sandwich you're chowing into next, making sure you always get some creamy goodness in every mouthful. \u00a0 \u00a0Large Greek Salad (with added 4oz of gyro meat) - Your standard Greek salad combination with a vinaigrette on the side. I elected to add 4 ounces of their delicious gyro on top. I really enjoyed the salad. The cut of the vegetables were right on the money, and it had a healthy dose of feta to provide some creamy richness. There was a nice ratio of gyro meat to salad. I'll definitely be ordering this again.Ultimately, if you are craving some Mediterranean flavors and want to skip the crowds downtown, Caf\u00e9 Europa is a great choice."], ["Javi H.", "My first time eating here and let \u00a0me tell the food \u00a0was actually good.

She loved it and wondered why I didn't take her there sooner. Thanks owner, Taky, for having a restaurant so good that I get in trouble for not going there sooner.We finished up with baklava.

We had quite a challenge deciding which table to sit in, as every table in here was institutionally clean. Nice!The side salad was delicious, the vinegarette was perfect. The vinegar and oil ratio was spot on. The salad was cold and clean to add the right amount of a fresh crunch after every bite. The beef gyro was okay, but I'm not sure if I'm much of a fan. We did have fries added to it, maybe I'm not that great at rating gyros? I will say that there was plenty of sliced beef. The greek fries was interesting, if I could re-do my order, I would \u00a0order it plain since it may have been a feta cheese overload for us. The Greek spaghetti wasn't anything to note.

However, you can see the kitchen from the front and it was kept very clean. This is one of those places where you order and pay up front before you go to your table. What I didn't like was that the menu on the boards didn't have descriptions; I had to rely on the takeout pamphlet to see what was included. \u00a0I got the veggie souvlaki because it sounded the most interesting with all these different veggies; the meat options seemed a little scarce on the greens. I was hoping this joint would be on par with Sam's from Davis, but it didn't quite impress me. The pita bread was grilled on the stove for a while making it soft and warm, but as a result it was way too hard to even hold up to eat as a wrap. I ended up eating it with a fork and breaking off the pita bread a bit at a time.

I've eaten Gyro's before but it's been hit or miss. \u00a0I wasn't excited to go but Jeremy had mentioned us trying Greek so I said what the heck and the reviews were great and the menu sounded tasty so I decided to give it a try.We started with the Chicken souvlaki Plate for $12.99. \u00a0It is chicken skewered and seasoned with Greek spices, cooked over open flame, served with rice pilaf or french fries, Greek salad, tzatziki sauce or Greek yogurt and pita bread. \u00a0We ordered the fries.

I can't vouch for the food really, I had ghormeh sabzee which I know not many people would order right off the bat, but a few of my coworkers tried it and loved it.

My ghormeh sabzee was very good, along with the rose water ice cream which DOES CONTAIN NUTS, FYI.

Poultry dishes start around $17 and any other meats around $19.99. Service was a little slow but maybe that was because it was a busy night. While their parking lot is small there is ample parking on the street and at 24 hour fitness across the street."], ["Arushi S.", "EVERY Persian food-lover needs to come to this restaurant if they are in the area and don't mind spending a little money. My entire family swears by great kabobs (it's a blood trait) and we just can't get enough of this place. We've been here for birthdays, Christmas, and brought family friends from around the country here, too.Appetizer: The little pita-cheese-onions-tomato-greens appetizer plates they serve for FREE is literally the best thing ever. I have not seen it in any other Persian restaurant I have been to and my family was so impressed our first time here, that we now serve this simple appetizer at our family dinner parties!! Famous Kabob, you are doing this right...don't get rid of it, ever.Entree: We always order the Beef Koobideh and Chicken Barg. Super, super juicy. \u00a0The Mahi Kabob (fish) is great too -- very crispy skin and flavorful fish. Beware: sometimes they run out of the beef, so call-ahead if you are wanting it. Fortunately, the chicken koobideh tastes just as delicious and juicy. What impresses me as the meats are not ever over-marinated or swarming with sauces + rubs. They are just seasoned in a proper way and then cooked to perfection. Probably consistently the best koobideh I have ever had. PROTIPS: 1) If you are VEGETARIAN, you should tell them beforehand and specify if you don't want meat to touch with non-meat. \u00a0In the past, they have served our veggie kabobs on the same large platter as our meat kabobs. 2) Keep a look-out for Famous Kabob coupons/deals on Restaurants.com. We once found one that allowed us to order lamb, chicken, AND fish at this place -- all under $50! For a restaurant that is on the pricier side, it was such a blessing to eat Famous Kabob's juicy, high quality meats/poultry/seafood for much less than what it would have costed otherwise."], ["Daniel H.", "As usually, Cindy K takes me to all the amazing places that I've come to fall in love with.

Don't be fooled by the shabby looking parking lot and outside structure. - Good service, manager stops by to make sure we enjoy our food- Delicious complimentary appetizer- Juicy flavorful meatIt's slightly pricey, but the quality is good.

The location isn't fancy at all, but when you walk into the restaurant the ambiance completely changed. \u00a0They have a large steel chandelier that hangs in the middle of the restaurant. \u00a0Red, cushiony, velvet booths and tables with linen cloth napkins. \u00a0From the outside, I didn't expect to be walking into something fancy. \u00a0Even the waiters looked sharp in their black pants and uniform white button down shirts. \u00a0We decided to order from the Dinner menu (it was lunch time) because we were craving lamb. \u00a0The lunch menu is definitely reasonably priced. \u00a0Dishes ranging anywhere from $10-12, but you don't get any lamb choices. The dinner menu had items listed at $19.What I ordered:1. \u00a0The Lamb chops and rice: \u00a0This dish originally came out medium rare. \u00a0I can't eat medium rare cooked lamb. \u00a0I had the waiter take it back to cook it more with no problems. \u00a0He was happy to do it! \u00a0After it came out the way I wanted I was able to enjoy my dish. \u00a0It was delicious. \u00a0The lamb was cooked to my liking and the rice was very good. \u00a0It's like they cooked it and slightly flash fried it. \u00a0It was buttery and a little crispy, but all in a good way. \u00a02. \u00a0The fiance ordered the lamb kabob: \u00a0I think they got our order mixed up because he wanted his dish prepared medium rare, but it came out medium. \u00a0Since I had to return my dish for more cooking, we returned his as well. \u00a0Again, with no problems from the waiter or anything. \u00a0Very good customer service if I do say so myself. \u00a0Once his dish was returned to him he was able to enjoy it as well. \u00a0The kabob had grilled red onions and bell peppers that accompanied the lamb very well!Overall, we had a great experience! \u00a0The food was great, service was great, and parking/location wasn't an issue.Since I'm not familiar with Persian/Iranian food, I'm not sure what makes a particular dish \"Persian\" or \"Iranian\". \u00a0I only say that because I swear I ordered a dish similar to this at Petra Greek and a Kabob at an afghan restaurant that tasted similar. \u00a0So confused. \u00a0Will do more research on what makes a food Persian, Iranian, Greek, or even Afghan. \u00a0Their dishes are just so similar to me. \u00a0Pretty ignorant in this department, so if there are any yelpers out there who can school me it would be greatly appreciated!"], ["Anthony W.", "We made a mad dash to Famous Kabob because as usual, I had put off using a Groupon for months and months and it was about to expire. When I drove up to this humble little strip mall with a payday loan next door servicing the needs of the community, I kind of assumed it was a no frills fast foodish kinda place. But lo and behold I walked into a lavishly decorated little piece of Persia. Granite tables for all and ornate ceiling adornments galore. I found it amusing that most of the waiting staff were older Persian men, reminded me of Goodfellas. They were efficient and cordial, and were overall pleasant and attentive. First off let me say, the basmati rice blew me away! It was the fluffiest, most fragrant basmati rice I've ever had. Infused with saffron and most likely cooked in some kind of broth, I could eat it plain and be done with the meal. The rice alone deserves a 5 star review. However, the other elements, bring my rating down to an overall 3.5 star. I had the lamb shish kabob and the meat was tender but cooked well done, and not seasoned much at all. I had to sprinkle salt on it to taste and the waiter actually told us to load it up with the sumac seasoning. In my mind I was expecting something wonderfully seasoned in a way I could not do myself with my limited knowledge of kabobs. But alas, I think I could've grilled a tastier meat on my Weber at home. Now combine that with the $20 price tag and I'll have to knock it down a few stars.Overall, rice was fantastic and alone deserved 5 stars, but man does not live by rice alone."], ["Gara G.", "Everything taste truly delicious every time we go, best Persian restaurant in Sacramento !!!"]], "Babylon City Market": [["Carri S.", "Love this place.

Chicken marinated for 24 hours and cooked with onions and a garlic sauce? Sign me up 100% of the time. The chicken (+ sauce) was served on top of pita bread with a side of hummus and a salad. If you are not a fan of parsley, this may not be the right salad for you, since it's pretty much a salad of parsley, but I thought it complimented the chicken well. The hummus was delicious and flavorful, as expected. My only complaint would be about the pita served UNDER the chicken. Yes, serving it this way added extra flavor from the chicken juices and sauce and made the pita more scrumptious, but it was also more awkward to eat since you had to dig it out from underneath all the chicken where it had become quite soggy (I know, that makes it sound super appetizing...). I should also mention that the Chicken Sumac comes with a soup as a starter, which was so-so-- it falls in that grey area of being not terrible, but nothing to write home about either.tl;dr: Definitely on my \"will come back again\" list for Sac.

The falafal was kind of dry but still pretty good, especially with the cucumber yogurt dip. The baba ganooj was good, but maybe a little too interesting for me, and the hummus was okay. Not the best I've had, but not bad at all. I was personally not a fan of the dolma.The kabob was very decent. The chicken was just right, maybe slightly on the dry side but still moist.

I probably would have been satisfied with just a big bowl of that, and nothing else.I had the rouge wine, which was advertised as \"similar to merlot,\" and that's exactly what I thought of it. It was very decent, and I would definitely order it again if I came back. This is a very small establishment with seating for maybe 30 people at most. The ambiance is alright but maybe kind of generic and repetitive. The bathroom was dingy and not very well-stocked. I would definitely suggest that as an area of improvement.

Oh my goodness, the sandwich was amazing! The chicken was thinly sliced, moist, and the sauce was good enough to lick off the wrapper. I was so stuffed after finishing it, I almost didn't have space for the lentil soup. The soup by the way, wasn't exactly what I thought it was going to be. It had a color similar to pea soup and a consistency similar to some Progresso vegetable soup. It was hot, the spices weren't overwhelming and it was 16 oz. of heaven.

Eveything was made to order and fresh and not a huge wait."], ["Brook Y.", "Crest Cafe is a well-priced and tasty lunch spot conveniently located to the Capitol. No beer or wine, just delicious and healthy options at a reasonable price.The Crest Greek salad is my new go-to lunch: a generous heap of lettuce (romaine, not iceberg, thankyouverymuch), a few thinly sliced cucumbers and tomatoes, a sprinkling of feta cheese crumbles and a light and tangy vinaigrette. Add garlic chicken or gyro meat and your total is just under $11, which is pretty good for the neighborhood, and it's usually enough to send me into a minor food coma afterwards (um, no small feat for a mere salad!) Please note, I'm kind of a super salad snob, so finding a place with a housemade dressing that doesn't use mayo or corn syrup to thicken it = major happy salad dance. The garlic chicken is also well-seasoned and the portion is more than satisfying. The lamb gyro on their pillowy soft pita bread = a perfect meaty-crunchy-chewy lunch that won't bust your gut or your wallet.Crest Cafe has a nice combo of Mediterranean fare like dolmathes, falafel, and babaganoush, mixed in with some Americanized faves: if you're not in the mood to be healthy, the Mediterranean fries are seriously to die for, topped with gobs of feta cheese and smothered with creamy tzaziki dressing. Straight up hangover fare.In terms of how this place compares to the other Greek spot downtown: it doesn't have the hip factor, but I would argue that Crest's food is better than Petra (do NOT get me started on how shady I think it is to add fries to a gyro, that is just a ploy to give me less meat!) Crest's interior is more like a cafeteria space, roomy with tiled floors and fluorescent lighting, although on a temperate day the partially-shaded patio is a small slice of serenity next to the clamor of lightrail and K Street bums. It could maybe benefit from some sprucing up, but as long as the prices stay low I'm not complaining."], ["Kim C.", "Flavorful and traditional Greek food tucked away on K Street. \u00a0The chicken gyros are delicious! \u00a0The restaurant atmosphere is nothing to write home about, but they have plenty of indoor and outdoor seating right next to the Crest Theater. \u00a0Great for a quick, affordable bite to eat!"], ["Charmaine S.", "I'm always iffy about Mediterranean food but this place does it right.

First things first, today is 102 degrees so naturally I came went inside Crest Cafe feeling hot and sweaty and was hoping it would be cooler indoors. WRONG! There was neither AC nor fans blowing. This means one would get sweaty just standing in line to order (which I did). I admit that not having AC is a first world problem. I can forgive that it was too warm for people to be eating and ordering there. I waited for my number to be called. I grabbed my order thinking it was strange because the box seemed smaller than what I can remember. I was thinking \"all right... food is getting expensive so maybe they had to cut back on their portion size\" which is understandable if you want to keep the prices the same but have to cut back slightly. Well, I got back to my office hot, sweaty and hungry. When I opened my take out order, it dawned on me that the portion size didn't get smaller; I did not get what I ordered. I was thinking that maybe I picked up someone else's order, but that is not it because she called out my number and everyone else around me was dining in. My co-workers told me to go back or call and ask for a credit. At that point, I just didn't care because it was way too hot to go back. I ate the meal and it was filling and delicious. Unfortunately, I was slightly disappointed that I paid too much for my meal. What I ordered was more expensive in comparison to what I received. \u00a0Another reason a star got knocked down was the amount of oil that was at the bottom of the box. I know olive oil is healthy, but too much of something healthy becomes unhealthy.

I ordered the wrap, which was more food than I wanted, but I didn't feel $6.99 was a good value for the pita falafel. The falafel wrap was good, but I've had better. The wrap itself wasn't very tasty, a cheap flour tortilla, and the sandwich was pressed in a burrito maker. IMO, the falafel sandwich in a pita wrap at the N Street Cafe is far superior for less money. Another thing that annoyed me about the Crest is that 2 p.m. all the tables were dirty.

LAYOUT It is a pay first, before you sit down and eat, because of the neighborhood i guess. The entrance is greeted with some nice poles, and bright floors which reminds you of a greek environment. Nice waterfall wall along the buffet food area. Lots of seatings, for large and small parties. There is a soda machine, where you can help yourself when you purchase the all you can eat.

Yes $15 for lunch buffet. I think it is worth it for kabobs, if your a meat lover! FOOD Chicken Kabob - juicy and tender, and just cooked well with a char grilled favor. I wouldn't have thought the quality for a buffet would be so good. Beef Kabob - You can definitely see herbs mixed in with the ground beef. The beef tasted like hamburger meat, and not much herbs flavor in it, but yes you see lots of green herbs mixed in though. I do prefer the chicken kabob any day. Eggplant - this is a greasy dish. The non spicy eggplant tasted like an italian flavor dressing. It was different and good, but just a bit too oily for me. Hummus - this was just an average hummus, can't go wrong with this. Nothing to special like in flavor or anything, but it is pretty good with the pita bread offered in the buffet :)Yellow Rice - This did have some flavor in it. Light and fluffy, kind of reminds me of a quick ten meal cook up kind of yellow rice. I didn't find it too authentic in \u00a0the flavor inside the yellow rice. Basmati rice - the presentation does look like its fluffy and mmm. I did find some hard or uncooked grains in some bites, might of been dried up or something. But i do like basmati rice, but finding some hard pieces was just ehh.... i like it fluffed.... Lentil soup - This was great. The soup was creamy with lots of lentil. The soup flavor was on the calm and bland side. Falafel - this was in a pretty good bite size. The outside is kind of hard on the outside and kind of dry in the inside, i didn't attempt the second round of plate. \u00a0spicy eggplant - Yes on the more oily side. The eggplant was not spicy, but more on the mild side. I did like to mix this dish with the 2 kinds of rice offered. cucumber salad - This was refreshing mixed, which is a great all around dish and perfect for the summer and spring. It had a light italian dressing mixed kind of flavor in it. roasted squash / Zucchini- This was my favorite. Yes i love my veggies roasted and yes it was perfect! so good and just on point with the chicken kabob and rice. SERVICEThe only service you get is when they come and fear the plates. They do ask if you need anything else or have any questions. They do like to interact with the customers and ask if it is their first time or not. Friendly staffs here.

Perusing the dinner menu, I noticed that most of the entrees were quite pricey and decided to go for the beef shawarma sandwich ($9) with fries (extra $2) instead. The sandwich came stuffed in a nice little pita pocket, which made it less messy to eat than if it were a traditional two-slices-of-bread deal. There was a hearty portion of beef and the flavor was quite tasty. The fries were thick, hot, and delicious. I almost wished there were a bit more but I was still left reasonably full afterwards.The shawarma sandwich seemed to be a way better deal for the price than the actual dinner entrees that a few members of my party ordered - the shish kabob and moussaka both came on nicely presented plates with rice but there didn't appear to be that much actual food for the amount that you were paying. For a similar price, one could come in at lunch time and eat way more at the buffet! Service was not bad, as we had our water refilled regularly and our waitress was friendly. Food came out quickly. The decor was interesting, with the glow of a green light over the buffet in back and a large television screen in front. Although we were fairly lonely with few other patrons, the space was large enough that it didn't feel too awkward.

We came here to grab some food before going to watch a movie since it's not too far away. Arrived on a saturday at night and there was pretty much no one there. The food was pretty good, I got the beef kebab but it's just too expensive for what it is. Considering you can get a sandwich for $9 or a plate for $19 there's quite a disparity there. I would be much more inclined to go for their lunch buffet if I could that way I could sample more things. It just feels very disjointed. I can't tell if they're supposed to be a nicer sit down place, or more casual. From their website and everything it seems to play it up as more upscale, but my experience was anything but. The food was well seasoned and very flavorful though. Just wish the price was more consistent to reflect the overall experience."], ["Yixuan Z.", "This is a very nice Mideast restaurant. I went for its 15$ buffet. It has a variety of dishes. I enjoyed several classic Mideast salads, chicken kebab, and falafel.

The coffee is good, deep roasted beans but not much acid.If they heat up pitas a little bit would be better.If they provide lamb kebab would be perfect."], ["Jessica S.", "We got here at 11:15 and the door was locked. We waited and an older guy finally came and opened the door. While paying, my S.O. asked if they opened at 11 (we thought maybe it was later and we'd misread the website or their hours has changed or something). The guy was really curt and unfriendly and said, \"Yeah, 11\" like he was doing us a favor by letting us in. Not a good start. So, for 2 people, it was $30 which I think is absurdly expensive for a lunch buffet. Especially considering the selection is pretty limited. The baked chicken was pretty good, as was the labneh and the hummus. The pita bread was awful - clearly out of a bag, a little bit stale... The smaller pieces of chicken were really dry, and so was the falafel. Just, overall, it was mediocre for $30. I was pretty disappointed."], ["S B.", "Went there for lunch today. This place is AWESOME!!! A 5+ stars restaurants based straightly on their food ratings. All meats are super juicy ~ one of the best juicy kabob I have ever had!!! Chicken meat is very juicy also. They served beef ribs on Friday lunch ~ Oh my goodness!!! They are the bomb!!! Great meat, juicy and awesome bbq flavor. Very good hummus and eggplant dip, although their pita/naan is only ok, and too much dressing on their salad. With the amount of great and yummy food in that restaurant, it's definitely worth 5+ stars!!!Price wise - it's decent since I got beef ribs today. hahaha.EVERYTHING I had tried was so yummy in this restaurant. Highly recommended this place."], ["Vladimir G.", "Can I give this place 6 stars?Was planning to check this place out for a long time and finally the opportunity had arrived. So, our group of 6 co-workers headed to the spot. It was pretty busy during lunch on Friday, but we were seated in a timely manner. They have variety of plates from hummus, sour middle eastern salads, appetizers to BBQ halal beef ribs (served only on Fridays), chicken and beef kebabs. Everything was so delicious that at the end of my carnivorous feast I had a big happy bbq smile across my whole face due to those bbq beef ribs. Their chicken kebab is made of chicken breasts and I am usually hesitant and prefer thighs over breasts due to the fat and juicy factor, but their chicken breast kebabs were not dry at al, but instead - juicy and flavorful, and by far-the best chicken kebabs I have ever tried. Price includes buffet and a soda, and you have to pay for extras like desserts, etc...P.S. The service is very attentive and the empty plates were removed quickly. Definitely \"I'll be back.\""], ["Tammy S.", "I came here for lunch for the first time and for me, it was a mixed experience.ProsLots of delicious food options on the buffet - seriously, the food was great!Dining area was spacious and cleanThe people seemed quite friendlyConsMany dishes on the buffet were severely depleted - they were having a hard time keeping even the basics, like pita bread, hummus & falafel stocked. Empty pan syndrome!Beverages are included in the buffet, but their iced tea machine was broken. How hard it is it to brew some tea over ice and serve it in pitchers? My only choice was soda, which I don't drink$15 is a lot to pay for a buffet that they couldn't keep stocked and had limited beverage offerings. I waited for over 15 minutes for them to bring out more pita bread & hummus!Were it not for the actual AVAILABILITY of the delicious food, I'd love to be able to come back, but based on this experience, I have a hard time recommending it, not knowing if there will actually be any food available to eat.

The food was very tasty and well prepared. I spoke with one of the family that owns the restaurant and much of the food is Palestine based, but it also offers other middle-eastern style dishes. Lots of flavors and textures to try, which included lamb, beef, chicken, vegetarian dishes (including a cauliflower dish that was both a pleasure to look at and good), salads, hummus, pita bread, a yogurt dip, and more. They even had a dish that apparently consisted of bread with cheese on top (at least I think it was cheese). The ambiance is somewhat sterile, so this is not a good place (in my opinion) for a romantic dinner, but that was not off-putting in the least since the food more than made up for that. The staff answered by questions very professionally and offered some really good information. My only real issue is that their website lacked some key information, such as that on weekends they apparently only serve buffet style. But otherwise, it was a wonderful meal for a reasonable price. I will definitely go there again and recommend it to my friends."], ["Kristi B.", "I preface this with I set my falafel standards high.

Within a handful of bites, \u00a0I would walk back to campus or my apartment in a happy falafel bliss.Today I was hungry at lunch, \u00a0the first three restaurants I visited were closed. The cashier invited me to check out buffet, \u00a0saying there were a few vegetarian options on it. I declined, \u00a0opting for a falafel sandwich to go, about $8. When I got back to my desk, \u00a0I was pleasantly surprised it came with french fries. While I loved the pickled vegetables and the yogurt cucumber dip and even the bread, the falafel fell flat. I \u00a0finished the french fries before I ate the second half of the sandwich. While I shouldn't judge a restaurant based on one sandwich, admittedly I am. On a positive note, \u00a0a few days ago I booked a flight to Cairo, \u00a0and while the most of the university moved to a new campus, \u00a0this visit to Darna reminded me that one of my goals is to see if I can find that temaya stand a few blocks away from Tahrir."], ["Kristian D.", "I am so glad that I finally tried Darna.

I went in on a Friday afternoon and it wasn't too crowded. There was never a line at the buffet. You go in and pay up front and then you choose wherever you want to sit.$14.02 for a lunch buffet is a little too much for me. The only buffets that cost that much (or more) are places with a bunch of seafood or \"exotic\" meats, and Darna only had one dish that was seafood-some deep fried tilapia. Nothing special, just battered and deep fried tilapia fillets. Other meats included beef and chicken. I was really disappointed that the shawarma wasn't included in the buffet! Another thing I wish they had was dessert! They have a display case of it in the front and it all looks so good, but it's not included in the buffet. On the other hand, drinks are included. I didn't really care for that though, since I typically drink water anyway.It isn't a giant buffet either, maybe 20-30 dishes? I can't remember exactly. Half of it was cold food, such as hummus, tabouleh, baba ghanoush, salad, and other dips/spreads. The other half was hot food, such as kebabs, beef ribs, moussaka, spicy eggplant, and others. Everything was refilled quickly.The quality of the food was excellent! Sometimes buffets lower the quality of the food but not here. The hot dishes were hot and the cold dishes stayed cold. Everything was so flavorful and had significantly \u00a0and wasn't overly salted. The one that that I'll take away from here was the quality of the food and how fresh everything was. I was very surprised by it.A side note-the buffet is HOT, which means the tongs are hot. I wish they had longer tongs!

It turned out to be a small-ish fast food type restaurant in a plaza with a pretty empty-looking drinks fridge and similarly empty tables. But whatever. The staff was friendly and quick to complete the order. The food - kebab with rice - was really good for an okay price. It was served at the right temperature and wasn't overcooked or dry or anything. The only thing I would have liked would have been if I could have half rice / half salad like I usually got at my usual Persian place. But again, whatever. This place hit the spot for my food craving :)"], ["Chris M.", "Family owned and operated. I live right around the corner and the family makes some authentic Armenian kabobs. \u00a0Been here several times and the portions are huge and the taste is uniquely delicious. My wife requested it when she was in labor at the hospital with twins! I actually told the family when I picked up the food and they gave me 2 pieces of baklava as good luck. They have me as a regular for life:) I see a lot of complaints about waiting. Yes, you wait because they make every order, the same as a fine dining restaurant. It's not a fast food joint. People need to relax if you want to enjoy good food. I say go to McDonald's if you want fast food."], ["Veronica C.", "Ate at CKR on July 19th 2015: Everyone was extremely friendly. I dinned in and had the chicken kabob combo. They brought pita and hummus while I was waiting and it was yummy. When my food came out it looked so good and tasted superb! The flavor was great! I was NOT disappointed one bit, the portions were generous as well. If I didn't have a long drive home I would have had left overs. When I was ordering I saw Baklava!!! Baklava are one of my favorite treats! I didn't order it when I ordered my food just incase I didn't have room (of course I made room for it I was just trying to have a little discipline) so when I was all done ordering I went and ordered my yummy treat!

The Ground Lamb and the rice came in a foam container. \u00a0It was more rice than anything else. \u00a0The lunch special came with only 1 lamb skewer. \u00a0It would be nicer if it came with 2 pieces of lamb. \u00a0I was a little disappointed with the Ground Lamb. \u00a0I have had better lamb elsewhere. \u00a0The rice was not very good. \u00a0The pita bread was good and thick, but, I don't think they make their own. \u00a0It probably is not bad for Sacramento, but, I've been spoiled by the many Greek places in Southern California. \u00a0Perhaps their other dishes are better. \u00a02 1/2 stars."], ["Sean M.", "The salad and chicken were decent but the rest tasted like dry hamburger and plain rice. \u00a0Also I feel compelled to rate it so low because this cost over $30.

I'd say the hummus was the only thing that was tasty. The beef kabob did not have seasoning. The chicken had some seasoning and was cooked just right. But the dip was all mayo!

This was a total fusion place. \u00a0I should have read the reviews first but since I was craving for some Greek food, and this place was the first one that popped up on yelp for me, decided to hop in. I'm glad I did though. Above all, the service was excellent, kind waiters and very accommodating.

The service I received from the waitress on duty was rude and uncalled for. I politely asked for a glass of water while I waited as was told, \"you're gonna have to wait.\" Clearly this employee is not a suitable staff member to handle the restaurant on her own.

This is one of my favorite places in Sacramento. It's affordable and the portions are large (leftovers for lunch). I've tried five other Greek/Mediterranean places in Sacramento and none of them have all of the elements that I enjoy at The Kabob House. My usual dish at dinner time is:-Marinated Chicken or Garlic Chicken with Rice-Hummus Comes with Pita Bread-I always order extra Pita Bread as it is delicious here!-I always have them bring out the squeeze bottle of their house marinade sauce, which you can purchase by the bottle - I of course have one in my fridge.Some of the other yelpers have complained about the rice being bland or plain, I think this is intentional. The flavor of the marinade and the flavor of the garlic butter are meant to be served with other mild flavors, this way your palette is not out of control. Personally I cover my rice in the marinade and I could eat that by itself for a meal (and have done so, since I often have leftovers).Like I said, I've been a customer for well over a decade so there have been plenty of opportunities for mistakes which is the only reason I've given four stars instead of five. I've never been to any restaurant that had the very best food and service every single time."], ["LY L.", "Soft music and no TV! Yay we all can have decent conversations at dinner.Pita bread: soft, warm, and delicious. They keep bringing out extra bread too. I was stuffed from eating baba ganoush \u00a0and pita bread.Baba ganoush: I couldn't taste the eggplant which was a little let down for me. It definitely was not the best I've had in this life time.Salad: fresh salad but the dressing was too tart and sour for my taste, I left it alone after two bites.Beef kabob plate: the meat was cooked perfectly and very tender. Rice was a bit bland and I wish it were more buttery.Service: excellent!
