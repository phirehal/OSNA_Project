{"Darna": [["Sarah S.", "Stopped into this little gem for lunch and was very pleased! Lunch Buffet was kept full, all the food tasted fresh and hot. Staff took used plate away quickly and though it cost about $15 per person it was well worth the price. I loved everything I had! Falafel was yummy and their chicken kabob was so flavorful. I also overheard some regular patrons asking if certain items were available. The waiter stated not today which excited me to know that when I return I will be able to experience different foods, and I assume those items to be good if patrons ask about it!Definitely stop in to experience Darna!"], ["Amal S.", "Very personable, hospitable, and kind staff. We were a family of 11, we had to wait for a while to be seated, with the restaurant being pretty empty. Food was very delicious, juicy, and perfectly seasoned. I loved the choices of different kabobs (kofta and chicken) we also enjoyed the roasted lamb. They had a live band that played oum Kulsum, Egyptian classical singer and a favorite of mine. Onto tea time and the Baklawa, which I have grown up loving and prepared frequently by my mother and my grandmother. This one by far THE BEST tasting baklava ever!!!! It tasted like an authentic original PALESTINIAN baklava, the filing was made from scratch using mascarpone type cream and corn starch (according to the owner's wife).The only thing, I think they're a bit on the high price. $25 for 12 and older. I think $20 is the perfect price. Regardless, I can't wait to come again in the near future."], ["jeremy t.", "This place is definitely worth the try if you are about to get into middle eastern food. You can try a lot of variety without incurring a huge cost. The hummus was pretty fresh and tasty. baba ganoush was also on offer as well as several kabobs, rice, Tabbouleh, lamb, chicken etc.On fridays they have bbq ribs. Buffet is around $14"], ["Alex T.", "Knock knock, Kabob Who?!!, AYCE KABOB VIBE I have always dreamed of kabob for all you can eat, man i can never get enough when i order elsewhere Ala carte and only receive 4 to 6 pieces only with lots of basmati rice. Yes when i saw ayce kabobs, i was suspicious wondering how the quality would be like, so one way to find out is to try. LAYOUT It is a pay first, before you sit down and eat, because of the neighborhood i guess. The entrance is greeted with some nice poles, and bright floors which reminds you of a greek environment. Nice waterfall wall along the buffet food area. Lots of seatings, for large and small parties. There is a soda machine, where you can help yourself when you purchase the all you can eat. The location is right in the corner of the light rail, on k street, next to insight and buds sandwiches. Parking would be hard, but there is parking garages nearby or park on j street with the meters. PRICE As of September 10, 2015, lunch buffet is $13.85 with tax included it comes out to $15 for lunch. Yes $15 for lunch buffet. I think it is worth it for kabobs, if your a meat lover! FOOD Chicken Kabob - juicy and tender, and just cooked well with a char grilled favor. I wouldn't have thought the quality for a buffet would be so good. Beef Kabob - You can definitely see herbs mixed in with the ground beef. The beef tasted like hamburger meat, and not much herbs flavor in it, but yes you see lots of green herbs mixed in though. I do prefer the chicken kabob any day. Eggplant - this is a greasy dish. The non spicy eggplant tasted like an italian flavor dressing. It was different and good, but just a bit too oily for me. Hummus - this was just an average hummus, can't go wrong with this. Nothing to special like in flavor or anything, but it is pretty good with the pita bread offered in the buffet :)Yellow Rice - This did have some flavor in it. Light and fluffy, kind of reminds me of a quick ten meal cook up kind of yellow rice. I didn't find it too authentic in \u00a0the flavor inside the yellow rice. Basmati rice - the presentation does look like its fluffy and mmm. I did find some hard or uncooked grains in some bites, might of been dried up or something. But i do like basmati rice, but finding some hard pieces was just ehh.... i like it fluffed.... Lentil soup - This was great. The soup was creamy with lots of lentil. The soup flavor was on the calm and bland side. Falafel - this was in a pretty good bite size. The outside is kind of hard on the outside and kind of dry in the inside, i didn't attempt the second round of plate. \u00a0spicy eggplant - Yes on the more oily side. The eggplant was not spicy, but more on the mild side. I did like to mix this dish with the 2 kinds of rice offered. cucumber salad - This was refreshing mixed, which is a great all around dish and perfect for the summer and spring. It had a light italian dressing mixed kind of flavor in it. roasted squash / Zucchini- This was my favorite. Yes i love my veggies roasted and yes it was perfect! so good and just on point with the chicken kabob and rice. SERVICEThe only service you get is when they come and fear the plates. They do ask if you need anything else or have any questions. They do like to interact with the customers and ask if it is their first time or not. Friendly staffs here. JUST A NOTE Don't go to a buffet before an interview or work, because food coma is real, lol... yes oh man was i stuffed and couldn't move. i needed someone to roll me out of there. I can feel my pants getting tight, and my button up shirt popping out. lol"], ["Aleeta P.", "Everything looked delicious and was very appetizing. \u00a0The workers were very friendly and the place was filled with customers. \u00a0The buffet had numerous dishes, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. Lentil soup, spicy eggplant, falafel, chicken and goat kabobs, beef ribs, and 2 types of rice among other things. \u00a0Once I finished eating I needed to be rolled out of the restaurant (it was quite embarrassing). \u00a0Other than that, everything was wonderful and my Mediterranean buffer experience was very positive."], ["Brittney K.", "Darna definitely stays true to the reviews as a lunch spot...as when we came in for dinner on a Saturday night, it was close to completely deserted!We didn't let this bother us, however. Perusing the dinner menu, I noticed that most of the entrees were quite pricey and decided to go for the beef shawarma sandwich ($9) with fries (extra $2) instead. The sandwich came stuffed in a nice little pita pocket, which made it less messy to eat than if it were a traditional two-slices-of-bread deal. There was a hearty portion of beef and the flavor was quite tasty. The fries were thick, hot, and delicious. I almost wished there were a bit more but I was still left reasonably full afterwards.The shawarma sandwich seemed to be a way better deal for the price than the actual dinner entrees that a few members of my party ordered - the shish kabob and moussaka both came on nicely presented plates with rice but there didn't appear to be that much actual food for the amount that you were paying. For a similar price, one could come in at lunch time and eat way more at the buffet! Service was not bad, as we had our water refilled regularly and our waitress was friendly. Food came out quickly. The decor was interesting, with the glow of a green light over the buffet in back and a large television screen in front. Although we were fairly lonely with few other patrons, the space was large enough that it didn't feel too awkward. They also have a display case with yummy-looking desserts at the entrance...oooh so tempting!Overall, while very quiet around dinnertime, Darna is not a bad downtown option if you're in the mood for some shawarma and want to grab a drink on K Street afterwards!"], ["Alan X.", "Eh, I'm not really a fan. We came here to grab some food before going to watch a movie since it's not too far away. Arrived on a saturday at night and there was pretty much no one there. The food was pretty good, I got the beef kebab but it's just too expensive for what it is. Considering you can get a sandwich for $9 or a plate for $19 there's quite a disparity there. I would be much more inclined to go for their lunch buffet if I could that way I could sample more things. It just feels very disjointed. I can't tell if they're supposed to be a nicer sit down place, or more casual. From their website and everything it seems to play it up as more upscale, but my experience was anything but. The food was well seasoned and very flavorful though. Just wish the price was more consistent to reflect the overall experience."], ["Yixuan Z.", "This is a very nice Mideast restaurant. I went for its 15$ buffet. It has a variety of dishes. I enjoyed several classic Mideast salads, chicken kebab, and falafel. Most customers are the managers working around this area (u can tell from their shirts). The coffee is good, deep roasted beans but not much acid.If they heat up pitas a little bit would be better.If they provide lamb kebab would be perfect."], ["Jessica S.", "We got here at 11:15 and the door was locked. We waited and an older guy finally came and opened the door. While paying, my S.O. asked if they opened at 11 (we thought maybe it was later and we'd misread the website or their hours has changed or something). The guy was really curt and unfriendly and said, \"Yeah, 11\" like he was doing us a favor by letting us in. Not a good start. So, for 2 people, it was $30 which I think is absurdly expensive for a lunch buffet. Especially considering the selection is pretty limited. The baked chicken was pretty good, as was the labneh and the hummus. The pita bread was awful - clearly out of a bag, a little bit stale... The smaller pieces of chicken were really dry, and so was the falafel. Just, overall, it was mediocre for $30. I was pretty disappointed."], ["S B.", "Went there for lunch today. This place is AWESOME!!! A 5+ stars restaurants based straightly on their food ratings. All meats are super juicy ~ one of the best juicy kabob I have ever had!!! Chicken meat is very juicy also. They served beef ribs on Friday lunch ~ Oh my goodness!!! They are the bomb!!! Great meat, juicy and awesome bbq flavor. Very good hummus and eggplant dip, although their pita/naan is only ok, and too much dressing on their salad. With the amount of great and yummy food in that restaurant, it's definitely worth 5+ stars!!!Price wise - it's decent since I got beef ribs today. hahaha.EVERYTHING I had tried was so yummy in this restaurant. Highly recommended this place."], ["Vladimir G.", "Can I give this place 6 stars?Was planning to check this place out for a long time and finally the opportunity had arrived. So, our group of 6 co-workers headed to the spot. It was pretty busy during lunch on Friday, but we were seated in a timely manner. They have variety of plates from hummus, sour middle eastern salads, appetizers to BBQ halal beef ribs (served only on Fridays), chicken and beef kebabs. Everything was so delicious that at the end of my carnivorous feast I had a big happy bbq smile across my whole face due to those bbq beef ribs. Their chicken kebab is made of chicken breasts and I am usually hesitant and prefer thighs over breasts due to the fat and juicy factor, but their chicken breast kebabs were not dry at al, but instead - juicy and flavorful, and by far-the best chicken kebabs I have ever tried. Price includes buffet and a soda, and you have to pay for extras like desserts, etc...P.S. The service is very attentive and the empty plates were removed quickly. Definitely \"I'll be back.\""], ["Tammy S.", "I came here for lunch for the first time and for me, it was a mixed experience.ProsLots of delicious food options on the buffet - seriously, the food was great!Dining area was spacious and cleanThe people seemed quite friendlyConsMany dishes on the buffet were severely depleted - they were having a hard time keeping even the basics, like pita bread, hummus & falafel stocked. Empty pan syndrome!Beverages are included in the buffet, but their iced tea machine was broken. How hard it is it to brew some tea over ice and serve it in pitchers? My only choice was soda, which I don't drink$15 is a lot to pay for a buffet that they couldn't keep stocked and had limited beverage offerings. I waited for over 15 minutes for them to bring out more pita bread & hummus!Were it not for the actual AVAILABILITY of the delicious food, I'd love to be able to come back, but based on this experience, I have a hard time recommending it, not knowing if there will actually be any food available to eat. It's a bummer because I feel like this place has a lot of potential."], ["Moozhan T.", "We were going to have lunch at Bud's, but as it was a rainy, stormy day, Bud's was closed, so by complete chance we ended up at Darna. \u00a0Let me tell you, the food is 3.5-4 star quality, but I felt that $12.95 which comes to a little over $14 was a little too high for lunch buffet. \u00a0Otherwise, this place is totally worth a visit. I think you should order things off the itemized, ala carte menu to get a delicious value meal.

The food was very tasty and well prepared. I spoke with one of the family that owns the restaurant and much of the food is Palestine based, but it also offers other middle-eastern style dishes. Lots of flavors and textures to try, which included lamb, beef, chicken, vegetarian dishes (including a cauliflower dish that was both a pleasure to look at and good), salads, hummus, pita bread, a yogurt dip, and more. They even had a dish that apparently consisted of bread with cheese on top (at least I think it was cheese). The ambiance is somewhat sterile, so this is not a good place (in my opinion) for a romantic dinner, but that was not off-putting in the least since the food more than made up for that. The staff answered by questions very professionally and offered some really good information. My only real issue is that their website lacked some key information, such as that on weekends they apparently only serve buffet style. But otherwise, it was a wonderful meal for a reasonable price. I will definitely go there again and recommend it to my friends."], ["Kristi B.", "I preface this with I set my falafel standards high. I spent a year abroad about 20 years ago at a university that edged Tahrir Square and I would eat falafel (Egyptians call it tamaya) almost daily, \u00a0at this barely there hole in the wall, \u00a0hot crispy patties, with a splash of tahina, topped with pickled vegetables. Within a handful of bites, \u00a0I would walk back to campus or my apartment in a happy falafel bliss.Today I was hungry at lunch, \u00a0the first three restaurants I visited were closed. The cashier invited me to check out buffet, \u00a0saying there were a few vegetarian options on it. I declined, \u00a0opting for a falafel sandwich to go, about $8. When I got back to my desk, \u00a0I was pleasantly surprised it came with french fries. While I loved the pickled vegetables and the yogurt cucumber dip and even the bread, the falafel fell flat. I \u00a0finished the french fries before I ate the second half of the sandwich. While I shouldn't judge a restaurant based on one sandwich, admittedly I am. On a positive note, \u00a0a few days ago I booked a flight to Cairo, \u00a0and while the most of the university moved to a new campus, \u00a0this visit to Darna reminded me that one of my goals is to see if I can find that temaya stand a few blocks away from Tahrir."], ["Kristian D.", "I am so glad that I finally tried Darna.

There are lots of tables with open seating after you pre-pay your food near the entrance. The star is the buffet with lots of typical dishes - hummus, various salads, lentil soup, grilled meats, and fresh fruit. They have a standard menu as well for a la carte ordering.The food was fresh and plentiful, however some meats may take a while to refill since they are grilled fresh in the back.

Darna's one trick being its lunch buffet, well, even that seems to have mixed reviews. Anyways, Darna is clearly a lunch spot based on its location near day-offices, large buffet area, and level of service. We ordered:1) Kabob combo: Shish tawook (chicken), kefta kebab (finely ground beef with seasonings), shish kebab (beef cubes), and rice/veggiesThis dish was fine, but nothing remarkably special. The almonds on the rice were appreciated2) Eggplant Massouka: Baked eggplant, ground beef, seasonings, covered in mozzarella, with a side of riceThis dish seemed a bit small once you really got into it, also the cheese on top wasn't evenly melted at all. Seemed rushedThe ironic part of it seeming rushed is that with just these two orders, it took 1 hour and 45 minutes to get in and out. We were totally fine with this as time was precisely what we wanted that night. But if you're in a hurry, don't count on this place. The service was also a little odd, it took a while for anyone to notice us and a family, the family ended up just wandering through the tables and seating themselves. The staff eventually seated us and tracked down that other group. After that, 3 different waiters and waitresses approached our table to ask if we had been helped. The one bright spot on the service front was our main guy, who acknowledged our reeeaally long wait with some pita, dessert, and genuine apologies. But still, that's not much good to someone who didn't have about 2 hours to spend on a simple dinner. It's pretty clear Darna's main target is the lunch crowd, and dinner's just the after-thought."], ["Adam G.", "Well I will definitely have to check out the lunch buffet next time I come here because I clearly missed out on that. I instead made an order for the Beef Shwarma sandwich \u00a0to go. There is a large portion of sirloin sliced into pita bread with all the Mediterranean works inside.

Food: If I had written this review after coming here once, it would've been five stars all the way. Now, having visited a number of times, I can say that consistency is not their strong point, but I still think they are one of the better lunch options within walking distance of the California Capitol. During my first visit, I ordered the Shawarma sandwich, a pita filled with meat straight off the spit, pickled veggies, sauce, and thick fries (yelp.com/biz_photos/darn\u2026, yelp.com/biz_photos/darn\u2026). I have nothing but good things to say about this sandwich. The meat was seasoned well and had that perfect roasted and slightly crispy texture you crave when you order red meat shawarma. The weather was amazing, so I decided to eat in Capitol Park. Here one of the highlights of eating at this place: If you order out, they give you a green mock single-use bag that is totally reusable. To top it off, it's a nice green hue and stamped complete with a redundant \"Thank You\" and a smiley earth stamped on the front. I've since been using this bag like crazy and people keep asking me where I got it. Unfortunately, my second visit wasn't so hot. I came with a couple friends and for some reason the shawarma was replaced with this nasty substitute. I don't know if that was a permanent change because I didn't have a chance to visit afterwards, but it was pretty gross. Luckily the falafel and other components of the meal were good enough to compensate. The lunch buffet seems a bit more consistent, but it's pricey unless you can cram massive amounts of food down your gullet. If you have a chance, check out their collection of sodas. They have some interesting stuff I'd never seen before. Atmosphere: The transition between the dirty, seedy strip of K street this place sits on and the interior is rather shocking. This place looks like a palace. The walls are decorated with gorgeously intricate geometric and floral designs (yelp.com/biz_photos/darn\u2026) and there's even a huge flatscreen tv to keep you entertained if dining alone (yelp.com/biz_photos/darn\u2026). All of the surfaces sparkle with cleanliness and the seating goes on for miles. Service: Maybe this is a family owned business because it seems like many of the operations could use some streamlining. The first time I visited, one of the younger employees seemed to have trouble operating the cash register. It also took me forever to get my food during my second visit. Synopsis: If I could guarantee the kind of quality I encountered during my first visit, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place. I say, try one of the pita sandwiches, get the takeout bag and see for yourself."], ["Andrew And Lynelle H.", "This is by far my favorite Mediterranean restaurant. I went there a few weeks ago with my mother-in-law. We had a sampler of many appetizers. Everything was delicious and then the main dishes came out. We had a rack of lamb, grilled chicken, steak and ground beef kabobs along with grilled vegetables and rice topped with thinly sliced roasted almonds. I was extremely impressed with the quality of all the dishes. Everything was full of flavor. To top off the appetizers and main dishes, we got a plate of Kenefa, a savory yet sweet dessert.

The menu stated that fries or salad were available for an extra $2, so when I didn't ask for them and they came on my plate, I thought I would be charged extra, but I wasn't. I'm not sure if it was a mistake or if all of the sandwiches come with a small serving of fries, but there were enough for me to only be able to eat half of them, so I don't think paying $2 for more would be necessary even if I was starving.The fries were pretty good. The chicken shawarma sandwich was amazing. It was all hot, and the pita bread was overflowing with chicken and a combo of tomatoes, pickles, garlic sauce, and tahini. There were some extra pickles on the top of the sandwich, too, and they were probably the best pickles I've ever had.The chicken was insanely flavorful, and juicy. I'm not really a Mediterranean food connoisseur, but this food was better than I've had at any of the other handful of places I've tried. I thought that $12.99 sounded a couple bucks too expensive for a lunch buffet, but as I watched them clean it up, I realized that they really do have a ton of selections to choose from. I will definitely be back for that sometime.I love the ambiance here. I can't really think of a better way to fuse American and Mediterranean decor than to hang two giant flat-screen TVs in the middle of plants and tiled walls and clay plates. There are also waterfalls all throughout the restaurant, and the sound is very relaxing. Maybe it's meant to make you eat more.The service was outstanding."], ["Daanyaal K.", "Came here on a Friday evening. From the looks of it, this place is fairly new as the inside is very shiny and spiffy.

I went back to my room and opened my sandwich box which had steak cut fries with some parsley or cilantro on it. My sandwich was great, it was literally 90% filled with meat which stuffed me up real well. The lentil soup was also really good and extremely filling. For $14 you can't go wrong.

That's enough to cover 1.5 hours of parking, and one of the reasons why I'm rounding up to 4 stars. This was our second time here for the lunch buffet, and our reactions mirror our first time. My dining partner liked it much more than I did. I feel the $15 (including tax) price is a bit too high. I loved the Falafels and the lentil soup, but nothing else jumped out at me as above average. However, my partner also raved about the baked chicken and the fish, and liked several other dishes, too. So to be fair, 4* it is."], ["Elisa M.", "Their pita sandwiches are delicious!

But after stopping in here, I realized that they are very different from Crest Cafe b/c they are upscale and they know it.But the good rating is due to their decor and presentation of their restaurant.

ORIGINAL ISSUE:To give a Cliff's Note's version of my past problem: \u00a0customer service / cooking prep were lax. \u00a0When you are on the clock, the buffet is supposed to be an efficient option, letting you get in & out in a timely fashion without fuss or muss of ordering from a table. However, that was not the case:DEFICIENCIES THEN:* \u00a0Out of Kabobs (a gentlemen in front grabbed these last ones as I took picture). More than 10 minutes to refresh pan:yelp.com/biz_photos/darn\u2026* \u00a0Out of Pita Bread and took 10 mins to replace:yelp.com/biz_photos/darn\u2026* \u00a0Out of Falafils and took 15 minutes to replace:yelp.com/biz_photos/darn\u2026* \u00a0Massouka was NEVER replaced entire time from 12:20pm-12:50pm:yelp.com/biz_photos/darn\u2026BUFFET METRICSAt the time, I finally confronted the shawarma attendant (who was periodically in & out), and said, \"You are out of Massouka, Pita and Falafils, and other things.\" \u00a0His golden response was, \"Oh! \u00a0We're busy.\" \u00a0Really? \u00a0Like it's MY JOB to inform staff that they are out of food? \u00a0And \"busy\"? \u00a0Like having people come to your business at lunchtime is some unexpected surprise? .POOR RACHEL AND HER \"TO GO\" ORDERHowever, the worst case-scenario of deficient \"buffet-prep & delivery\" was the poor gal who had been 2 spots in FRONT of me at the register - she had gotten the \"To-Go\" option, probably thinking (like I would LOGICALLY also) this would make things \"faster\" for her. \u00a0(\"Hahahahahaha! \u00a0Oh god.\") \u00a0She just confided to me that this was going to make her late in getting back to her office and her whole idea thinking that this would \"save time\" for lunch was \"hijacked\" by lax customer service. \u00a0\"Hijacked\". \u00a0I liked her use of that word. Funny thing is that I'm already familiar with lazy buffet operations who engage in lax attitude about food replenishment - they include such notorious stalwarts as Annabelle's in Old Sacramento and Mountain Mike's Pizza buffet off of College Town Road. \u00a0I just had no idea that DARNA would devolve to such depths. \u00a0But the fact of the matter is that Annabelle's and Mountain Mike's are only charging me between $7-$8 to waste my time, not $14.02.SOME THINGS DO CHANGE!But I have to say now that in the last few times I've been here to Darna, I've been delighted at how quickly and efficiently food replenishment does take place for the buffet. \u00a0And today was probably the best example of this, especially since this was the choice for several of us to come together:The Roasted Chicken - Kept Full!yelp.com/biz_photos/darn\u2026The Ribs - Plenty!yelp.com/biz_photos/darn\u2026The Hummus - Great Presentation!yelp.com/biz_photos/darn\u2026And the same for the other items I took pics from on this occasion. \u00a0THE LOWDOWNYour food - when PRESENT - Rocks The Casbah! \u00a0Thanks for a delicious time with friends today at my most recent visit. \u00a0:)"], ["Crystal C.", "I came here for an early half-hour lunch and beat the crowds. There were only 3-4 other people here when I came, so I think I avoided the empty-pan syndrome that so many other Yelpers have been disappointed by.Service was generally good and the restaurant and buffet were spotless. We found a table, drinks, and everything we needed with no problem.The buffet is smaller than I expected, but there is a good variety of food and it ranged from pretty dang good to pretty much buffet-style mass produced food. The meats had generally good flavor but were a little dry. The roasted veggies were awesome and done perfectly. The rice was also very good - well seasoned and not too dry. I was not a fan of the stuffed cabbage, but had seconds of most of the cold salads. All in all, I would say $14 is a little high considering the size of the buffet and the quality, especially considering I only have a half hour lunch (which isn't their fault), but once in a while it would be worth the splurge to come early, avoid the crowds, and feast on some of the better dishes."]], "Lucca Restaurant & Bar": [["C.

First off, if you're looking for a spot with a hip younger crowd you won't find it here. To be fair, we dined on a Sunday evening which isn't exactly the best time to eat out, but this definitely seemed more like a family-friendly or comfort-food-for-elderly-patrons kind of place than a modern experience or good place to take a date. And so Lucca's follows a long list of American-Italian establishments.The interior is dated and noisy, and not at all in a charming, rustic kind of way. However, the outdoor patio is nicely appointed and spacious--definitely worth waiting for if you have the choice. Service was friendly, but a little slow for the number of diners present.Our meal started off well enough with a fantastic plate of zucchini chips, a large hot plate of well-prepared mussels, and two creatively inspired and excellent refreshers. Unfortunately things took a turn for the worse after that. I had pan seared salmon, which came on a very uncreative bed of could-have-been-instant mashed potatoes. My wife had a disappointing rendition of cioppino; although the seafood was generic, there was plenty of it, but the sauce had a strange aftertaste and little of the deep flavor you might hope for. Now granted this isn't San Francisco, but you can easily make a tastier cioppino with premade sauce from the supermarket.Despite our disappointing entrees, based on Yelp reviews we decided to stick around for caramelized bananas. Unfortunately, this too left us wanting for... well, something else. The bananas themselves were tasty and the salted caramel was delicious, but the layer of semifreddo beneath didn't really go well with the dish, and instead of being creamy had a texture rather like ice cream that had been left out too long and then refrozen.It's quite possible Lucca's best servers and chefs had Sunday night off, but it will be a long time before we consider eating here again. However, based on the quality of our appetizers and drinks, it could well be worth checking out for happy hour."], ["Cyn T.", "Ambience, service are okay.

High quality food at an affordable price in a shady part of town. But a new job requires a new lunch spot and Pita Q it is. Pita Q is serves Greek food cafeteria style. You go up to the line, order and pay at the register. They serve wraps, salads and Greek bowls. The bowls remind me of Chipotle. You pick your rice, your veggies, your meat and sauce. I had the chicken with grilled onions, peppers, tomatoes and feta cheese. They finish it with lemon and olive oil. It was delicious. The peppers and tomatoes were a little too soft but still good. I also ordered a side of falafel's \u00a0and the taziki sauce was amazing. The store is clean and they have a nice waterfall outside so you can try to forget that you're eating in the hood.

I would come here every day, but it's a little out of the way for me. Worth the trip, but I wish there was one in Elk Grove. The staff is super friendly and the place is always clean. I get the chicken salad with cucumbers, mushrooms, onions, bell peppers and feta and it is AMAZING. I have also had the steak pita and that was great as well. The pita is fresh so you need to eat it right away or it might start to get a little flaky. The food is fresh and you get a large portion. The flavors are distinct, but not overbearing. The spicy sauce has a kick to it, but not mouth-on-fire hot so you can't enjoy your meal. I feel completely satisfied when I eat here. I feel like I ate fresh, healthy food prepared to order. You should definitely check it out. Oh and try the pita bread too.

The food is absolutely great but the workers are a bit on the slow side. I have a lot of patience for people but can't help but get frustrated every time that I come here.

Regardless, I keep coming back because of the food. The Souvlaki Chicken pita is my favorite. The quality of the food and the ingredients is unbeatable. I will usually get a side order of falafel balls with Tzatziki sauce because they are delicious.

Yes, I'm in dire need of trying new ethnic foods, I'm aware. Regardless, this place has the best falafel I have ever had! It literally beats anything and everything in Sacramento, hands down.

Hope they close.Edit - read the owner's response and I am in shock. First time in 3500+ reviews that someone has flat out lied. I didn't even talk to him directly but the poor cashier girl who served as the middleman. And, there was no discussion of six dollars.

A MUST TRY! :) Though this place is quite small (mostly indoors), they also have seats outside as well. Staff here is really friendly and they definitely want to make sure you enjoy your meal. You order inside and then you have a seat anywhere you want and they bring the food for you.All I got to say is that their Shawarmas here are the best. If you never had a Shawarma before, you definitely got to try one here! It's basically roasted meat with veggies served in a pita bread and they either ask you if you want their yogurt sauce (aka white sauce) and/or their spicy sauce. I usually end up getting both but I always ask for extra white sauce ;)My to-go order is always their Beef Shawarma :) For about $8 including tax, you get a huge meal that will make you happy.

A falafel should be crisp on the outside and not too soft on the inside. The service was good - very friendly people. It's definitely a student hangout, but not a great spot for a family night out."], ["Jonathan T.", "Small shop. Strange seating arrangement. The man at the register who takes your order at the front is also your waiter. It seems sort of strange to me because this causes you to have to wait very long for your food. He's also very friendly and talkative, which is great if you enjoy good casual conversation, but if you are in a rush somewhere, it may get frustrating watching him talk to customers about the weather when he could be taking your order instead. Nonetheless, the food here is sublime. It's Very flavorful and not too heavy. They use a secret cucumber sauce which is very well prepared and complements the gyros really well. They also serve fries here as a side which are okay. I'm really between 3 and 4 stars, but it's still closer to a 3 than a 4. Would get a solid 4 stars if they split the waiter/cashier position into 2, like how it should be."], ["Lexy L.", "My friend recommended this place to me, and I have to say it was worth finally trying this place. I ordered the beef shawarma over rice, which comes with yogurt and fresh vegetables. The food portions here are very generous, the vegetables on the side were fresh, and the seasoning on the book was great! A recommendation I would make is to add more vegetables, as the beef/rice is so rich in flavor, there is more of a need for something a little blander on the side like the vegetables. Another thing I liked about this place was the customer service. The chef was delighted that I enjoyed the food, and the girl who took my order was very polite and made sure everything was to my liking at least twice during my stay. I will definitely be coming here again!"], ["Thuy T.", "I am a huge fan of Mediterranean food, and Sam's does a pretty nice job. I think it's one of the better places in Davis, and it's really affordable, but Davis is a very small city. I always get the beef gyro, and it always satisfies my cravings. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because of their lamb. I don't know if it's just me but every time i order anything with lamb in it, the texture of the meat is always very soggy. I don't know what it is, but I feel like I'm eating lamb paste as opposed to lamb meat. I'd advise against getting lamb because in my opinion I don't think meat should be that consistency. BUT the beef gyros can't be beat."], ["Allison S.", "Good food. Pita is fresh. Seating inside is kind of annoying and hard to maneuver.

Sam might have had a bad day, but I've been a customer for over 6 years, no one should be treated with such disrespect, especially a loyal customer.In Response To Samir:Hey Samir, I just wanted to clarify a few points for you. I have definitely been a customer for over 6 years. Since my siblings started going to Davis (the oldest one graduated in ~2006), I've patronized your store multiple times a year (essentially every time I'd visit them). Last year I patronized your store so much, your son knew what my \"usual\" was (a spicy beef shawarma with tahini sauce). Your definition of \"soliciting customers\" is very different from mine. Those \"customers\" are my roommates. And if you're angry that I \"solicited\" them (asked them if they wanted to eat somewhere else because you ran out of shawarma over rice- the thing I used to come to your restaurant for) you really need to grow up and learn some empathy. It's pretty normal for roommates to want to eat together, especially if they all came in the same car. If you run out of an item, don't be offended if people no longer want to order. Instead of taking offense to people leaving, you should work on improving the availability of that item.I'm really disappointed that you didn't even give me (yes, a six year customer) a chance to explain what happened. Instead of talking to me like an emotionally balanced adult to find a way to mediate the \"problem\", you booted me and my friend out of your store (remember how I was being respectful while you were screaming at me?).

I choose the original hummus flavor as I believe flavored hummus is a western influence and not what I grew up with. The Shawarma and Falafel was very flavorful, but the Hummus was very thin about the consistency of split pea soup. The flavor of the Hummus suffered from the consistency and had a very weak flavor.

However, you can see the kitchen from the front and it was kept very clean. This is one of those places where you order and pay up front before you go to your table. What I didn't like was that the menu on the boards didn't have descriptions; I had to rely on the takeout pamphlet to see what was included. \u00a0I got the veggie souvlaki because it sounded the most interesting with all these different veggies; the meat options seemed a little scarce on the greens. I was hoping this joint would be on par with Sam's from Davis, but it didn't quite impress me. The pita bread was grilled on the stove for a while making it soft and warm, but as a result it was way too hard to even hold up to eat as a wrap. I ended up eating it with a fork and breaking off the pita bread a bit at a time.

I've eaten Gyro's before but it's been hit or miss. \u00a0I wasn't excited to go but Jeremy had mentioned us trying Greek so I said what the heck and the reviews were great and the menu sounded tasty so I decided to give it a try.We started with the Chicken souvlaki Plate for $12.99. \u00a0It is chicken skewered and seasoned with Greek spices, cooked over open flame, served with rice pilaf or french fries, Greek salad, tzatziki sauce or Greek yogurt and pita bread. \u00a0We ordered the fries. Which if you're new to Petra they also have Petra Fries which are french fries with feta cheese and oregano. \u00a0We wanted the Petra fries, they are not the ones that come with the \"plates\". But Jeremy upgraded our regular fries for Petra fries and only paid an additional 50 cents. \u00a0We also go the tzatziki sauce and not the Greek yogurt, I can have that anytime. \u00a0You get a good amount of food on the plate. \u00a0Two chicken skewers with about 5 big chunks of juicy spicy chicken meat, a nice size salad, a nice large bowl of tzatziki, good helping of fries, and then four pieces of pita bread. \u00a0The food was beyond amazing, we were not disappointed in anything we ate, and we ate a lot. \u00a0Everything was super fresh, the spices were amazing, the meat tender, the salad crisp, the tzatziki sauce (I'm officially in love), the fries and the pita were fantastic. \u00a0We shared a plate and I seriously could have eaten a whole plate myself. After the chicken souvlaki plate, Jeremy was still hungry and I wanted to try something sweet. \u00a0So Jeremy ordered the triple dip plate for $7.99. \u00a0This dish is big and could easily feed 3-4 people as an appetizer before a meal. \u00a0It consists of \u00a0tzatziki sauce which is cucumber and garlic, revithosalata, which is Greek hummus, and tyrokafteri which is spicy feta cheese; and lots of pita bread. \u00a0I absolutely cannot tell you how delicious this is. \u00a0Have you ever tasted spicy feta cheese?

I couldn't believe how quickly they prepared it. It was so delicious. The meat was shaved thin and melt in your mouth soft. The pita bread is fresh. The yogurt sauce was very thick and oh so tasty. It lives perfectly in-between sour & rich. The hints of dill are not overpowering. The rice was cooked perfectly. The tomatoes, cucumber, olives (pits, watch out) and red onion are cold, fresh & crisp. They bath them in a layer of feta.

For $6.99, it comes with fresh pita bread. It will definitely fill you up even though the serving looks small. I have to get the Chocolate Baklava every time with the Fix beer. For me, it's a really good combination. If you don't like sweets, then don't get it because it can be very sweet, but the portion is small, so you'll be able to finish it without feeling sick. If you tried baklava, you know it is sweet. I really want to try the Petra fries because it looks so good. Guess i'll have to try that next week Friday.

The lamb seasoned well and tender. The chicken just slightly dry and I do mean slightly maybe a minute less and we are talking perfection. The beef also seasoned well and quite tasty. The plates came with rice and a salad. Overall I can honestly say we were both quite taken aback and very satisfied. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because of the styrofoam plates and they only have plastic utensils. That's ok for a hole in the wall who's business in 90% take out but they have a nice sized sit down dining area. Aside from that we will go back and I recommend it. I had a brief very friendly chat with the woman who cooked and served us. She asked if it was our first time, answered a couple of basic questions and bid fair well with a hope to see you again. Thanks for a wonderful late afternoon meal and experience."], ["Irshad A.", "Upside they have the best burgers with lots of flavor. Now for the bad, ever since this place sold to the new owners the service is bad.

This is my new favorite place in Sacramento. It's so clean. And the food was so good. I had the beed and my bf had the chicken and both were so delicious.

My mouth is watering right now just thinking about it. I could eat that salad every single day. I daydream about that salad. I can't wait to go back and have more.

It had a weird texture. The casing on it was waxy. Then it hit me. \u00a0Chewing it was like chewing one of those round stick beef jerkys'. It had a weird taste like GRILLED BEEF JERKY! I'm not kidding. This was not fresh meat. This must have been in dry storage in the back somewhere. Is this what they normally serve here? I looked at other patrons pics and the beef kabobs looked like real beef in most of the pics. WTH man! On the bright side, the chicken kabob was really good, but the lamb was chewy, tuff, and full of gristle. I liked the rice, salad, complimentary hummus and bread. Since the main meat item (beef kabob) was the largest on the plate and I could not eat it, I gave the establishment three stars. The staff was nice also."], ["Haidee B.", "My friend and I \u00a0been wanting to try out this place because I've always wanting to try out something new.

Make sure you try it, you wouldn't regret it. Later got into conversation about the place and how long he's been there, and he's such a nice person to talk too. Can't wait to be back!

I told her how great the new remodeled floors new tables and chairs are looking. She gave us a fresh hummus and pita bread right away. She offered us lemon water since we don't drink soda. Our usual order combination place with consist of ground beef,chicken kabobs,2 pieces of lamb, rice, and salad. The flavor of the meat is superb. You can really taste all the spices they marinated the meat on. The chicken is never tough and I believe it has minimum of 10 species. It's grill pretty well. The portion is a lot compare to the other places. Maybe they can serve some \u00a0kind of sauce on the meat. But with exceptional service, cleanliness and great price its not even a big deal. So if your looking to eat some Armenian cuisine and kabob I highly recommend this place."], ["Grace M.", "Don't let the Styrofoam plates fool you. The food here is gourmet.

While waiting for my coffee I saw a young man with an Extreme Hummus tshirt on. It must have been a sign. I asked him about the place and his response was \"I guess you'll have to come in and find out\". I headed there right away. A wonderful gem of a family run, (99.9% of food made on the premises) Greek restaurant. I also want to give a shout-out to those who I spoke to there, all were incredibly friendly. A special shout-out to the young woman behind the counter who helped me. A bright, cheerful, informative, beautiful young woman....thank you for helping me navigate the menu!"], ["Marina M.", "First time. Ordered to go. This place is like 5 minutes from our house!Fries was pretty goodFalafel was fresh and goodMy lamb and beef gyro meat inside was pretty good.

I love Greek food and this place is just amazing. I had their chicken wrap the first night and it was HUGE I couldn't finish all of it. Saved for later. I also ordered their 3 sampler of hummus.

Next time I might try something different."], ["Alix C.", "To add to all of the buzz about this place, I have to say it is pretty incredible. The falafel wrap was really good and the cilantro hummus was the best! We also tried the red pepper hummus and the garlic hummus.

Prices are very reasonable too."], ["Nick V.", "Unreasonably flavorful for the price. If you like things like \"Carne Asada fries\", get the Greek fries with the lamb+beef gyro.

Rolled through the drive thru on a slow Tuesday night... the best night to test out a new restaurant by the way because it tends to be the slowest and if you are a question-asker (like me) you won't be holding up anyone. So I decided to sample the chicken gyro (pronounced Euro for those of you new to Greek/Mediterranean food), the artichoke pesto hummus, and the baba ganoush. All satisfying, delicious, and freshly made. Pita bread was soft and warm. You can taste the quality in this place for sure.Service at the drive thru was friendly and informative.

Whatever, we're pretty low-stress people. We don't say anything (because we didn't really care) and dug in. Wow, the meat was terrific, the veggies were fresh, and the tazaki and hummus were amazing. We also ordered the Greek fries which were far-and-away the most delicious part of the meal. After about 5 minutes, the manager came out and apologized because he realized we received the incorrect order. Again, my wife and I are pretty easygoing so it really wasn't a big deal, but he continued to apologize and ended up giving us our correct orders to-go!I've been back here about 8 times since the first time and it is still amazing.

You could buy a whole pita bread for just a buck its not a bad deal considering how good it is. I will surely be back i loved it my old lady loved it and shes normally picky bout this type of food.

When I got to order the guy behind the counter was super super nice and helpful. He explained the difference between a Wrap and a Gyro (Answer: The bread. The Gyro comes with Pita Bread) and allowed me to sample several different types of Hummus. My favorites were the Extreme Hummus and the Original Hummus. The Sundried Tomato and Basil Hummus was surprisingly good as well, and the Spicy Red Pepper Hummus had quite the kick!I ended up ordering a Falafel Gyro which came with falafel, hummus, lettuce, tomato, onion, red cabbage, tzatziki sauce and creamy hot sauce in a pita. They made the sandwich within a few minutes right in front of me and I was on my way. My total was about $6.50 which isn't bad for the quality of the gyro and ingredients.Note: They make everything in house and it shows. Everything I tried was so good!The gyro itself was amazing! I loved the flavor of the falafel (nicey seasoned and cooked, not bland at all) paired with all the sauces which made it super moist and unique. Yummy!

When you order the side of hummus, it is more than enough to be enjoyed by two or 3 there and \u00a0still take some home as it comes in a portable little tub with lid.

It was hard to find the place but we managed. Look for Twisted and then move your eyes to the right to the corner of the L shaped complex. You'll find it there probably behind their catering van.The place had three tables occupied when we walked in. A couple very cozy sharing some pita nachos; another loud couple arguing about the fact one was out of town and never contacted the other; and another family of 4 or 5. So not one bit crowded. The service was so slow I told Jeremy the waiter must also be the cook. He laughed cause it sure felt that way. And not only was it slow, but the waiter, who had only 4 tables to wait on kept bringing people the wrong food. We almost got the table behind us nachos and sambosas. And 20 minutes after we placed our food order, he brought us our food, he gave us the wrong plates. He's either new or just simply a bad waiter. I can't imagine how the orders would be screwed up if the place had more customers.We ordered a bunch of food. I had the grilled chicken pita; the meat was very tasty but it was dry, even after I added the included taziki sauce and the taziki sauce left over from my sambosa. \u00a0Jeremy ordered the Taziki from the \"Starters\" section and that's all we got, no bread to go with it. What are you supposed to do with big bowl of taziki with nothing to dip in it. \u00a0For $5 you should get a few pieces of bread. We ordered from the starter menu the Sambosa, I had cheese and Jeremy had spinach. It's puff pastry with some ingredients added to the middle. Mostly puff pastry, very little stuffing til you get to the middle. I liked the flavor of the cheese and Jeremy liked the spinach, I did not care for the spinach.Jeremy ordered the falafel \"entree\". I came with 6 falafels, which was my favorite part of the meal, very tasty and nice spices, not dry. Also on the plate was rice that was nice and moist and tasted slightly of butter; a salad that consisted of romaine lettuce, a few pieces of tomato and cucumber. The salad was mostly lettuce, when I took a bite I didn't get any tomato or cucumber because there simply wasn't much to be found. It was seasoned with a nice fresh lemon type dressing. It also came with a small side of hummus. I did not like the hummus, it tasted like honey, kinda like medicine.Jeremy also ordered the eggplant pita, he said it was delicious, I choose not to try it.The food is fine, not the best Mediterranean food I've ever had.

We got a small order of the nachos on the house. They were pretty good, but the sauce was quite heavy, and we could've done with that on the side. The fried nachos were crunchy, but not super fresh; they tasted like they may have been fried earlier in the day.For the entree, I ordered the Chicken Sumac, which was very flavorful with a savory onion and garlic flavor. The rice was quite good, but the pita wasn't quite grilled enough and it tasted a bit dry. I was pretty disappointed that the salad came with ranch dressing...I don't remember ranch dressing being mediterranean. My friend got the lamb shank and while it was very tender and fall-off-the bone, the dish overall was not anything mind-blowing.As for service, I think they were still working out the kinks since they just opened not too long ago. Ordering hot water was a bit of a curve ball for them, and they didn't serve it until much later after we reminded them again. There were also some funny dark green / black pieces inside...I can only hope it was leftover tea leaves.Apparently they do a barbecue on the weekends where they bake the pita bread and grill the meats fresh outdoors. That sounds like it could be even better with the food fresh off the grill."], ["Nicole D.", "Yum!!! Was searching for somewhere new to eat in the area and stumbled across FreshMed. I purchased a $10 for $15 worth of food deal and the husband and I took off to check it out. We started with the hummus which was a generous portion, fair price and served with warm, fresh pita bread. It was delicious! My husband ordered the gyro plate, and I couldn't resist trying the nachos with falafel. We were both very pleased with the prompt, friendly service, generous portions and taste of food. The gyro meat was SUPER tender, and the nachos were full of flavor. We can't wait to return to test out more of their very large menu."], ["Elizabeth T.", "The nachos that everyone is raving about, really ARE that good.

I quickly Yelped and found FreshMed and saw the great reviews so we gave it a shot. Upon first arrival there isn't anything fancy about the place, just a restaurant no bells and whistles pretty bland on that other than the pretty fabric on the ceiling.We figured whatever lets eat here it got good Yelp reviews so it has to be good. We were happily greated by the gal working the tables (we were the only people there) but she gave us a recommendation when we weren't sure what to get for our combo plate (we went with Chicken Kabobs and falafel's). Then we also asked if that was enough for two and thankfully she gave her honest opinion that yes it was plenty for two. \u00a0Indeed it was! We split the combo dinner and then a gyro too. \u00a0The combo dinner came with a greek salad, pita and hummus, rice and two sauces for the meats. It was SOOOOO GOOD - Spicy Garlic Sauce.. NOM NOM NOM...We will totally be coming back. \u00a0The bill was under $20 and we were perfectly stuffed and the service was great. Thanks for the good find Yelp!

Pro Tip: Do not believe Google Maps. It's right on Fulton, not right off Fulton in the middle of some houses as it would lead you to believe.The inside of the restaurant definitely needs a little work. It is in serious need of an update and teetering on the edge of disrepair. So much so that I wondered if my tummy would later regret eating here. Help! I also walked in and there was no one to greet me, or seat me, so I stood around awkwardly for few minutes before seating myself and waiting for the server. She finally came out of the back (I think there's one cook and one server only) and I was able to order my Falafel Nachos which only took a few minutes to come back out before I was on my way.The nachos were lovely. Fresh pita chips were topped with a lovely tzakiki (I know screw that up) sauce, falafel, spicy sauce and tomatoes. The falafel wasn't the best I've ever had, but it wasn't bad. I loved how everything went together so well and how it was something different than what I would normally order. For about $5 for a small order (which is plenty for one person) it's a good value too.I would come back."], ["Paul S.", "My family and I wanted to try something different.

I ate two pita chips with toppings, enough. \u00a0I am not one of the masses whoadore these nachos, however done right with traditional sauce and greek olives, it really would be outstanding.Tabouli was as it should be, hummus was missing a lot of lemon, garlic and tahini. \u00a0it had no taste at all, worst I've ever had. \u00a0Sambosa with spinach has a nice phillo crust but the glommyspinach inside has no seasoning and tastes only of frozen unseasoned spinach. One person ordered the lentil and rice dish, a ton of rice, very little lentils and no carmelized onions as indicated on the menu. \u00a0I love Kebbe, used to work in a Syrian restaurantwhen I was young, their kebbe could not be compared, once again, no mediterraen flavors.I guess I should be thankful that they had no grape leave rolls \u00a0today, because I am sureI would not like them either. \u00a0I am not trying to be turn anyone away, but most of the menuitems I ordered I have made myself, and it's not hard to have them taste really good.If you have never eaten this food before pay attention to other peoples reviews, and youmay like it.

Went with my friend Alliver V. and we enjoyed the nachos, falafels and a 2 meat plate. Everything was really yummy. The falafels are a little different from others I've had. A much crispier skin like a panko crumb almost. For the meat, we got the lamb and chicken. Pita chips were crispy. Everything tasted super FRESH, hence the name. The only hiccup during our dine in was when they lady took our money and didn't thank us or let us know that she was done completing the transaction. I had used the Yelp $10 for $15 deal so we didn't know if it went though but she didn't come back to say anything so we left. Kinda awkward."], ["Jeeno M.", "I came here based solely off of the pictures of the Mediterranean nachos. I was not disappointed. Everything that I had to eat here really tasted fresh; hence the name of the restaurant. It's a small little place. Not much seating. There was no host stand, also. It made me feel like I walked into the living room of a person's house and they were in the kitchen cooking your food for you. It's not a bad thing, but I wish they had music or something playing in the background so it's not too quiet.Like I said, I came here due to all of the reviews and pictures of the mediterranean nachos. It was absolutely delicious. The ingredients were their house fried pita Chips, topped with Feta cheese, tomatoes, olives, Taziki and their house sauce on a bed of lettuce. Topped with your choice of Chicken Shawarma, Eggplant or Falafel. Our server didn't even ask us which one we wanted, but fortunately he automatically gave us the chicken, which is what we wanted. The pita chips were crunchy, the vegetables were crisp, the chicken was flavorful, and the sauces were just delightful. It all went perfectly well together like bacon and eggs, steak and potatoes, milk and cereal, peanut butter and jelly, cake and frosting, salt and pepper, you get what I mean.I also had the gyro pita. This is a simple, yet satisfying dish. For those who do not know what a gyro is, it is slow roasted meat, which I think was lamb, on a vertical rotisserie spit, traditional style with lettuce, tomatoes, and their special sauce, which tasted like a slight variation of the traditional tzatziki sauce. The prices are reasonable as well. The food served is of great quality and very fresh. I'd recommend this place to anyone. Its different from the usual burgers and fries, but could easily be anyone's comfort foods."], ["Strongbull G.", "So I typed in Middle Eastern food on yelp and this placed popped up. Mind you, I do have my favorite spot that I usually go to for my Middle Eastern fix, but I wanted to try a new place. I got the lamb gyro and small chicken schwarma nacho. The nacho was pretty good but the sauce to chip ratio was a bit off. It could have used a few more chips or a little less sauce. Taste was really good. The lamb gyro wasn't too great. The meat was nice and tender but the bread was old and tough and it totally ruined the sandwich. Please step up your bread game. Discard old bread instead of using old, because the competition out there has nice soft fresh bread and that's where I would rather spend my money. The waiter was nice and attentive and the place was clean. Overall, for what I paid, I was a bit dissapointed."], ["Shannen C.", "Came here for lunch two weeks ago and when we walked in there was only one table and no server in the front.

The blend of flavors is just right. Good mix of textures with the crispy pita, the tang of the sauces, the flavor of fresh herbs and well-cooked chicken... it's a winner. I'm not sure if I was dealing with the owner or manager when I went last, but he not only welcomed my check-in offer... but he applied to the whole meal instead of just my appetizer. Pretty cool gesture!My only gripe here is that the rest of the food doesn't seem to have the creative flair of the nachos. It's still all good, but just not as exciting. Maybe I'll discover something new as I explore the menu, but I'll have a hard time distancing myself from the already beloved plate of nachos."], ["Chetna J.", "The food was good.

We were a little nervous being the only 2 there, but overall it was good.

I wanted to try everything on the menu because everything looked so delicious, but I ordered the Mujadara, Meditteranean Nachos (since that was the fuss about this place) and the tabouli and spinach pasta salad.

I ordered the chicken kabob pita and my boyfriend ordered the ground beef pita. We both split a small order of the mediterranean nachos because I read so many reviews on yelp raving about them. We requested eggplant but they didn't have eggplant so we opted for the shawarma chicken instead. The nachos were delicious! This place has the BEST taziki sauce that I even asked for an extra side of it. The shawarma chicken was delicious, flavorful, and slightly spicy! My chicken pita was also really good but i would probably order the shawarma chicken pita next time just because it was more flavorful. My boyfriend seemed happy with his ground beef pita but I think he would probably order something else next time. The cost of these two pitas and a small nacho order for $20 bucks! What a deal!Only small complaint is that it did take a while for us to get our check. If i was in a hurry I would be more annoyed, but I was so happy and content with our food that I didn't let this ending ruin my experience. Overall, try this place! My boyfriend is a picky eater and doesn't usually like ethnic foods and he loved this place. And be sure to try the nachos! There's a reason why everyone raves about them on here!

The process of picking my toppings had very little direction and was haphazard (borderline painful.. possibly too many options and I was not sure how much to fill my pita). The chicken on the grill was ready in about 5 minutes and once it was packed in the dismal looking pita, I was out the door, largely unexcited about my lunch prospects.

Pita Pit truly is the mediterranean version of Subway. Though on their menu they have a list of a bunch of different Pitas they can make, what actually goes in each pita (other than the meat) is really up to you.Customization here is KEY. I usually get the chicken souvlaki (trust me, it is divine), and add all the things to it. I definitely overstuff my pita full of veggie goodness (in addition to the grilled mushrooms and onions, I add spinach, cucumber, tomatoes, olives, feta cheese, and tzatziki sauce.) I also love that they have whole-wheat pitas (yay for attempting to be health conscious). The ingredients are fresh and make for a scrumptious pita-- definitely has become a go-to place for me when I'm too lazy to cook and just want to grab a quick bite to eat.I will say though, that I wish they listed what their \"recommended\" ingredients/toppings for each type of pita were. You can find them online, but it would be more convenient if they could find a way to squish that on the giant board where they list the types of pita. Even so, if you get stuck, just ask the person helping you what they would recommend you add for the type of pita you ordered-- they usually know what they're talking about.All the people who work at Pita Pit are super sweet and very student-friendly (show your student ID card for a discount on the combo!). A lot of the people who work here are also Sac State students, so that might have something to do with it...Again, with everything else in this plaza, I love the location.

Also, If you come here enough, give them your phone number and every 10 pitas you order, you get a free one! :) Food: There are endless ways to have your pita! It's really hard for me to choose which is my favorite because I change it up every time. You choose which pita you would like, there are many options including breakfast and vegetarian. This past visit I ordered the Chicken Cesar (chicken and bacon) in a wheat pita. They grill the meat in front of you and you choose from a huge selection of fresh produce. Like subway, you let them know which toppings and sauce you would like. I opted for lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms, cucumbers, jalape\u00f1os, pepperoncini, and Swiss cheese with the Chipotle-BBQ sauce. \u00a0It was so good! Next time, I will ask them to cook the chicken into the sauce so it picks up more flavor. The pita comes out pretty big depending on your toppings. 4/5Service: Quick and friendly :) 4/5Final thoughts: I love Pita Pit!

And it's a damn good thing for him that I enjoyed it.A damn good thing.It's set up is kind of but not really like a Subway, with a end result that looks like a Chipotle burrito. I thought they were just going to open the pocket bread and throw stuff inside, but this was not the case. You pick your pita from a selection of different choices. There was a club sandwich, and a Greek sounding one. My friend even ordered an Aloha one that wasn't even on the menu, 'cause he's a bit of fan of the place. I ordered the club, which consisted of turkey, ham, and bacon. Yes, bacon.So they take all the meats and they throw them on the grill and heat it up, and I thought to myself, \"Hell yes!\" Then I thought, it's a darn good thing we are the only ones in here, because had there been a line, this would have taken a really long time. So they throw the meat into the pita, and you add your typical produce, lettuce, tomatoes, olives, and some onions. There are a ton of sauces to choose from. I went with the tahini. Then they roll it up, and in the end it looks exactly like a Chipotle burrito. They saw that puppy in half and away you go! Chips and drink make a combo to which I said, \"YES!\" only because they had Cheddar and Sour Cream Ruffles and I was on vacation.The staff was very cool. I guess the lady that was helping us was the manager or owner or something. The other was this cute kinda surfer guy who was so nice. We were afraid was going to get mad because we came in late and thought maybe they were close to closing, but he was cool.

We said no so she continued to explain how ordering worked. Basically its a subway for pitas. You start with your meat and they warm it up on their grill top. After your meat is ready they ask if you want wheat or white. Then you pick what veggies/toppings you want, which are unlimited. \u00a0You get 1 cheese option and sauces too. I would have given them 4 stars if I could order a side of fries. All they had were chips. The gyro pita I had was very good, but I wish I added cucumbers and had more tzatziki sauce.

My favorite dish so far is... I can't remember what it's called, but it's like a creamy eggplant dish with meat (ugh lamb is so good) on top. Excellent. Their lamb casserole was okay, but the eggplant dish was definitely A+ with extra credit.Service:Very friendlyParking:No lot and... well, it's midtown.Ambience:Casual, nice night out kind of sit-down place. Great for families and date nights."], ["ny w.", "The BEST lamb I've ever had, aside from my Granny's. Service was great.

I really think the warm pita bread hid the taste of the dip. Next time I want to try the \u00a0shepards salad. We also shared the lamb hunkar and the lamb kebap. I thought the hunkar was better. The lamb kebap had good flavor but I think it was just a tease. I was just disappointed since last week we had a 5 star experience at another restaurant.

I got the Betyi Kebap. The meat was very flavorful and with just the right kick, and it was delicious with yogurt sauce drizzled over all. Would definitely order again.Second visit (takeout) was the chicken casserole. To me it's more of a chicken stew, but definitely order a side of rice because you'll want it to make sure you don't miss any of the delicious flavor of the sauce. I garnished this with both chile and yogurt sauces (both go well together), and scarfed it down. I need to try to make this one at home, it's really excellent.I would highly recommend this place.

Some other service pitfalls included timing of the food, as well as not checking on the table as often as I would have liked.

This place is amazing!!! I've past by it many times without giving it a second thought. From the street, you don't really notice it because it seems to share the buildings with other businesses. You first see the words: Pizzazz! A K Street Collective on the side of the building. What does that even mean!?! I don't know but the delicious smells coming from this restaurant were too enticing to miss. We walked up the broad step that leads into this place and saw it was Turkish food restaurant and decided to give it a try.When you first walk into this place, you might think this is just a regular casual fast food type restaurant. The chairs and tables are clean and nice but nothing fancy. There are paper placemats on the tables and the menus are printed on a colored paper brochure. Which we were totally fine with and we started to head towards the front counter to order food when a kind man asked us to take a seat.From there I was totally blown away by the service. It felt like we were dining at an expensive restaurant, but we weren't! The prices are sooo reasonable. Our waiter was so kind and polite. He really helped us find just the right thing to order off the menu. It was a fascinating experience. And the food!!! Omg! It was sooo good. The chefs worked in an open kitchen with white uniforms. Everything was so professional and amazingly delicious. I highly recommend anyone to come check this place out.

We went for an office lunch, and there were 6 of us. We did make a reservation, but it was totally pointless, as only two other tables were full (SO SAD -- this place needs some more business!!!!). We ate like complete pigs, and two of us had leftovers. We had appetizers, entrees and dessert -- for a total of $130 (before tip). Pretty damn good price!But the food -- the food! Yum. Highlights: - Babaganoush was phenomenal- Hummus was good, but not nearly as good as the babaganoush- Feta appetizer was delightful (I think they must make the feta or buy it fresh) - Salmon was good- All lamb looked awesome (I don't eat meat, but I was a little jealous at HOW yummy it looked) - VEGETABLE HUNKAR -- I cannot recommend this enough. I had never had this dish, but it's a creamy eggplant sauce with roasted veggies on top. The flavors were bursting, and it was so rich and delicious!

The Tapas were really yummy and the staff were attentive and pleasant. Only reason it gets 3 stars instead of four is because, the main dish was a little bland.

These were delicious, but maybe a little dry. Would have loved more sauce, it was delicious!We split an entree, the braised short rib over polenta. Delicious & so tender! Only needed a fork.We also each got 2 drinks. I opted for the sangria which I wasn't a huge fan of & boyfriend got a bourbon & ginger ale. For all of that, our bill was about $70.

It probable took me about 5 minutes to finish the whole dish....YUMMY!Grilled Swordfish - the fish was cook just right and went very well with the green garlic sauce. \u00a0The winter greens were a little on the saltier side, but overall the dish was yummy.Hanger Steak - the steak was cook to his liking and was pretty tender. \u00a0This dish is also pretty tasty. Both of us finished everything on our plates. \u00a0The portions were just perfect and we both walk out of there with a happy stomach."], ["Rebecca J.", "Very nice ambiance. Food is good with interesting flavors. In terms of price, you are getting what you're paying for so I have no complaints there."], ["Ashley R.", "Let me start by saying this was my first and will not be the last. We started with three tapas, they came out super quick was good. I wouldn't go crazy for them but nice for sharing with friends. I had the braised short ribs for dinner, they were so good both my friend and I wanted to lick the plate. Of course we didn't but would recommend to anyone! Wouldn't change a single thing about my main dish. However our water who \u00a0did his job well in clearing plates and stuff, he was not very chipper just seemed to do the job, and go through the motion, with minimal interaction. This is the reason I took a star I will joyfully come back one day In the future."], ["patrick w.", "If you want to skip to the end I think I can summarize this review in one line \"a mediocre restaurant that happens to serve really good steak\"I will preface this review by saying I did sit in the communal table as I have a life and I choose not to make reservations at restaurants on a Friday night. i'm sure if I was at an actual table the service might have been passable.First things first, The hostess was pretty rude. When we walked in she just looked up at us and said can I help you. This is kind of a offhand comment for someone who's standing in the very front of restaurant Who sole purpose for being at the restaurant is to meet and seat. \u00a0Normally a hostess would say something like \"hi how are you? two for dinner?\" It gave me the impression that she thought I had just wondered in there lost. She then gave the impression that waiting for a table was not an option, \u00a0then second handedly offered communal seating. \u00a0Unprofessional. As for the service. Here's my thought. servers basically have just a few things they need to do. Get your order right, ask if you need refills, Have personality or at bare minimum be polite, ask for feedback about what was ordered, and make suggestions.My server was polite he did not mess up my order and that was about it. For that service I gave a 20% tip that I immediately regretted when I walked out of the restaurant. For instance one of the many items that I ordered was a salad that was over sauced and could've really used some type of pepper which wasn't on the table or offered.I tried a variety of the food, the steak, was amazing and pretty much why I gave any stars. Everything else was sorta of bland or blah. \u00a0The pork was pretty good but needed some greens. I had some of the stuffed peppers - the presentation was sloppy but tasted decent. \u00a0 The fried risotto was pretty gross - it had a decent batter but the innards were bland and blah."], ["Larry B.", "The Press consistently delivers the 'best food for the price' dinner in Sacramento. The quality is excellent and the pricing is very fair for the fresh, seasonal gourmet quality that David's team cooks up. The hangar steak with potato gratin (amazing) is a go-to, the seasonal fish and the commonly-accompanied risotto variations are always a treat. The desserts and tapas are also amazing. Not to mention, this place has visual appeal too. The exposed brick and wood-framed interior provide a clean rustic, relaxed decor. The atmosphere is one of the best unassuming vibes in midtown located next to the likes of other popular locations like Zocalo, 58 degrees and holding, and Paesanos. It's great for a date, dinner with friends, or family. The alcohol is also fairly priced here, try the house red blend, for $6 per glass you can't beat it!"], ["William V.", "We've been here a number of times and each visit was special . \u00a0The food and prices and service keep us coming back. \u00a0Tonight's black cod entr\u00e9e and calamari appetizer were to die for. \u00a0Try the new early bird special \u00a0 A great deal."], ["Ashley D.", "The Press Bistro has a good ambiance. The service was prompt, the menu has a good variety and the prices were reasonable. Overall I enjoyed my experience and would return again. We went on a Sunday evening, it was too packed so there was no wait but I'm sure it would be during typical dinner hours/days."], ["Tina C.", "I have been wanting to try this place since it looks cool and the menu sounded great. \u00a0It did not disappoint. \u00a0Got 3 tapas: octopus, watermelon salad, and arrancini. \u00a0They were all great. \u00a0We also shared the steak the au gratin potatoes and the short ribs and polenta- both were also great. \u00a0The polenta was too cheesy for me as I like it the traditional Italian was that's more grainy, but my husband loved it. \u00a0Had banana crepes for dessert, which were also great. \u00a0Can't wait to go again...."], ["Nicole S.", "But it is not group-friendly. We had 12 in our party and 1 check to figure out. With all the technology available (and it is available at most good restaurants) they could not give separate checks with the gratuity included on each check. What happened was we sat at the tables figuring the amounts, tying up the tables for a long time and no one could sit there, so if time is important and your guests are important, please offer separate checks. Or offer a check per table (4 guests) so it is easier to compute."], ["Ashley B.", "This is the perfect little date night spot, especially if you're local. I loved the interior- think the love child of industrial chic and cozy creamy goodness with sexy low-lighting. We started with a carafe of red, which was a blend of Zinfandel, Syrah, and Barbera; it honestly was pretty good for a house wine and a great alternative to a bottle.Next up were tapas. We chose the fried meatballs with garlic yogurt sauce. They were delicious and the portion was perfect for two. My entree was a half-portion of the pappardelle bolognese. The sauce could have had a bit more flavor, but it was enjoyable. My girlfriend ordered the swordfish and it was cooked to perfection. The spinach and roasted potatoes added substance to her meal and were pretty tasty as well. We ended the meal with the rest of our wine and espresso. I enjoyed the espresso so much that I would stop in just for that!The service was attentive without being overly intrusive. Overall, a lovely start to our Saturday night! We look forward to returning sooner than later."], ["Alex T.", "I like the vibe here for a nice date or a birthday celebration. came here for my friends bday for maybe 35 people here and I didnt really like the food because each person paid about 50 bucks including tip and we barely got food. everything was shared like family style and a bunch of side dishes and appetizers like olives or stuffed mushrooms and etc. the main dish we got was steak and we each only had 2 pcs and their was a ravioli dish which each person had one piece. over all I didnt have a good experience with a big group like that and the restaurant makes us order this special package and etc. anyways it was expensive 50 bucks for each person but we werent even full and needed to go get some food after we walked out. but I do give the nice vibe like a good spot to date."]]}
