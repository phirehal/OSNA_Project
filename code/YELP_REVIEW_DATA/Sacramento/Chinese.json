{"Viet Ha Noodles & Grill": [["Colette S.", "amazing foodwynn and colette love coming herewe get the noodle with pork and shrimp with egg rolls the food is always fresh and yummy"], ["Margaret L.", "I've been to the Viet Ha location on Florin/Fruitridge, and I am a fan of that place.As for this place, the menu ordering is very simple. It's almost like your chipotle of vietnamese noodles except, you don't get to see them place everything in the dish. This is not your authentic Vietnamese restaurant, but the food here is good. I pretty much ordered everything on the menu because I had to try everything. I like the tangy ving dressing for my noodles. The fried wings were tasty. The banh mi was also good. I definitely do recommend coming here.Parking can be difficult, street parking. If you know you're in a hurry and want take out, I recommend phoning in your order. This place is extremely small so I don't recommend bringing in a big party. I think of it as more of a to-go place."], ["Cari H.", "Good food. But there's no pho here, FYI.I had the pork over jasmine rice with all the garnishes. All really fresh. Both sauces were excellent. Two people are for just under $20."], ["William L.", "Whoa! I have no doubts at all cause Viet Ha Noodles & Grill is my go-to spot to munch some awesomeness of Vietnamese entrees in no time! Located at Broadway near the DMV Headquarters and McDonald's at the Curtis Park neighborhood, this small, casual place gives the taste of remarkable steamed vermicelli noodles as well as banh mi too! On 11/4/2015, I decided to try that place out. As I entered, this place is small, yet in a speedy, friendly matter! The concept is very contemporary indie made filled with vintage bricks and furniture too!The employees are doing an excellent job for making the customers like me a fantastic service! No cons at all!For the process, I started with the CYO noodle box. In this process, it has all the garnishes for this vermicelli noodle box which it includes green onions, basil, cilantro, carrots, white carrots etc. Then, I can pick 1 or 2 proteins of my choice, so I chose chicken as my protein add-on. Finally, I can choose 1 of 3 dressing choices to complete it. I picked the Vinaigrette as my dressing choice. So far, as I ate it, that noodle box creations that I've made is totally superb! The ingredients are very fresh and eatable to eat! The proteins like chicken cooked perfectly without all the dryness and burnts. What an excellent meal for a Vietnamese fix!Parking at Broadway can be difficult to park, you can park it at the nearest surface street parking available. Otherwise, you can walk, ride a bike, or use public transportation easier without the hassles.All in all, Viet Ha Noodles & Grill the coolest local Vietnamese shop, so you can get your Vietnamese foods faster! Perfect for lunch breaks for most workers and residents near and far. A well, worthy visit! My rating: 5 solid stars."], ["Monica C.", "Came back , this time on a Friday so I just have to update my 3 stars to a 5 . I love how they have pictures of their menu items hanging on the brick wall. Cute and convenient ! We ordered a beef banh mi for the bf, and a vermicelli box with a pomegranate raspberry tea for myself . Second times try was a success ! Not only was Annie's customer service on point, the food was as well . My only complaint would be the bread used for the banh mi. It was kind of tough to eat with the bread cutting the roof of my mouth. Other than that, everything was awesome . The thit nuong in my vermicelli was tender, flavorful, and plentiful . They definitely did not skimp out on the meat! My boyfriends banh mi was packed with the right amount of everything ! Enough meat, daikon , carrots, and cilantro. It was yummy . I'm so glad we were able to give this place a second try . We will definitely be back :)"], ["Julia D.", "I've been wanting to visit since this place opened and I finally got to and it was SO worth it.Reasonably-priced, fresh, fantastic Vietnamese food. They don't have soup; their main model is bun in a box with rice or noodles. TONS of meat, TONS of veggies, and the savory soy dressing is DELICIOUS on all of it.I can't wait to go back."], ["Vanessa L.", "Small cute little restaurant. Loved the decor inside. Not sure if it's the same chain as the Viet Ha in south sac, but this restaurant has a smaller menu and you also basically serve yourself. You just order and once ur food is ready, pick it up at the counter and proceed to get your own utensils, etc. The menu you can choose to get vermicelli noodles, rice, or a Vietnamese sandwich (banh mi) and your choose of meat & sauce. They have two kind of sauces: tangy vinaigrette, which is the traditional fish sauce, or the savory soy which is kinda like a teriyaki sauce. I ordered the noodle box with beef and with the vinaigrette sauce. It came with a lot of garnish and vegetables. It also came with a generous amount of meat. I kinda wish it came with egg rolls as well ($2 extra) just because other locations usually comes with egg rolls for the same price. But oh well, this box was filled me up already. Every bite I had, it was enough to have at least 2 pieces of meat onto it. It was flavorful. BF ordered the rice box with pork and with the savory soy. He really liked it and I thought the sauce went really well with it. I also ordered the pomegranate iced tea sweetened. It was really refreshing and light. It also had the right amount of sweetness to it. It wasn't too sweet but it was enough. They have a fridge of Asian drinks to choose from!"], ["Anne H.", "Came here with a friend to check this place out on a Wednesday. The place wasn't busy and there was no line when we came for dinner. Food: HIGHLY recommend their banh mi! It was really delicious! The bread was fluffy and soft on the inside and has that nice crunch on the outside. They don't skimp out on the meat. I got it with the pork and it was really juicy. The banh mi also had a good amount of veggies to balance out the flavors and adds a nice tangy crunch. It was really tasty. Would definitely come back just for the banh mi! Ambiance: The inside is very modern with a minimalistic feel. There aren't a lot of tables to dine in but I noticed a lot of people to go their orders or call in before hand and pick up. Parking: To my knowledge, they don't have their own parking lot which is a bummer. There's a couple parking spots on the street right outside of the restaurant. If those aren't available, you gotta circle around the block and hope you get lucky."], ["Jenny S.", "Viet Ha is like a Chipotle, but b\u00fan tht nuong style! You get a choice of carbs (rice, vermicelli, or banh mi) and meat (beef, chicken, pork, or shrimp). Each box comes with a generous amount of lettuce, bean sprouts, cucumber, cilantro, peanuts, and fried shallots; they put everything on it unless you specify otherwise. Regardless of your protein choice, they always do a great job at cooking it. They don't marinate the meat as much as I would at home, but it's got good flavor and it's really tender.Another thing you should note is how large the portions are! I always leave with leftovers and have enough for lunch the next day.Viet Ha's got a small menu, but they make sure they're good at everything they offer. The boxes are good and the wings are some of the best I've ever had. I'll definitely be back to try other side dishes and the coffee!"], ["Jackie F.", "Only ordered once from here, but that one time hooked me. Now I can get a banh mi fix steps from my office.Sure, it's not as cheap as the places lined on Stockton blvd, but hey, I'll save money on gas coming here.The bread is fantastic, that hallmark crust and soft inside that puts banh mi steps above Subway. I like how I can get beef on my sandwich, not a typical banh mi protein choice. Tofu is available for veg-heads. Mmmmm. Even that's divine! The sauces that are served on the side makes up for the fact they don't have headcheese or pate. Oh yum!"], ["Stephanie S.", "I really enjoy the concept of this place. It's like an Asian Chipotle. Everything that comes in or on what you order is very fresh and worth the price. The only downfall or complaint that I have is that sometimes it takes forever on your order. I've called 20 minutes in advance and arrived on time but the food was still not ready. So now I try to order 30 minutes in advance and just arrive there a couple minutes earlier. I would still recommend this place to people."], ["Catie D.", "Had a Pork Banh Mi with extra vegetables, Salt & Pepper Wings, and Eggrolls. Everything was really good and our order came up pretty quick. However, they charged us for everything - 50 cents (it could have been a dollar, cant remember) per sandwich for extra veggies, 50 cents for each container of Nuoc Cham (dipping sauce), and I think they even charged when we asked for a box to go.The 2 egg rolls is more like one long thin eggroll cut in half."], ["Tauhid C.", "This is my \"close-to-work lunch scramble\" that I go to. I LOVE their banh mi sandwiches the mostZ their rice box and middle box are good as well but the sandwich is cheaper and has a spicy kick to it.The prices are OK, I prefer the sandwich as well because it costs me less than $9 or so and its pretty filling.I've stopped by this place multiple times and leave satisfied every time. The wait isn't too long either."], ["Savoon P.", "I was craving for vietnamese food so I found this place online. \u00a0I decided to try it and was definitely impressed! I came in and ordered for take out and only waited ... Maybe 8-10 minutes which is super fast.... Can't beat that! I ordered the Pork Banh Mi $6 for my husband and the Pork Rice plate $7 for myself. \u00a0Both of these items were very fresh and delicious! They do not skimp you on the protein at all. We all love quality more than quantity and Viet Ha does it right. Two thumbs up for service and food! See you again soon Viet Ha!"], ["Jefferson L.", "On the wall just inside the door of Viet Ha Noodles & Grill is a word cloud that lists everything you can find on this eatery's menu. This addresses two points: the fact that Viet Ha focuses on doing a handful of things very, very well and that their menu items, like a cloud, are that close to heaven.Indeed, the food here is delicious and plentiful. It's served hot, fresh, quickly and with a smile. But, best of all, you get it the way you want it. Choice is king and 3 steps is all you need: protein, carb base and sauce. Veggies come with every meal. You want it in sandwich form? They do that, too. Viet Ha also offers side dishes if you just feel like picking or if your appetite is boundless. Either way, you must try the Salt & Pepper Wings. Crisp, savory and addictive.Bottom line: Viet Ha is where simplicity and scrumptiousness meet. It boasts a small menu with big flavor, fresh food without frills and a checklist of choices that'll have you floating on a cloud."], ["whitney s.", "Parking is slim, had to circle a few times before ending up just parking at Taco Bell. The restaurant is small and cozy. We were greeted by a young man that was very helpful and informative. The staff was friendly. Very welcoming to everyone who walked in the door. The menu is simple, sweet and to the point. Either sandwich or noodle box. Pick your protein and or topping/ Sauce for the box. We both went with pork banh mi sandwich. BOMB!!!!! So fresh and very balanced. Gorgeous in fact. The bread was perfect. It was our 1st time here and since we live in woodland we decided we would just go all out and try all 3 appetizers (triple threat as he called it.) Egg roll, cheese puffs and the wings!!! All were amazing!! The wings were on steroids, so huge, super crunchy yet mouthwatering. The egg rolls were my favorite of the 3. Cooked perfectly, just enough crunch. Yummy goodness on the inside- paired perfectly with the sweet and sour sauce. Like heaven to the tastebuds. The cheese puffs were good. Something in them I couldn't put my finger on that was sweet, but non the less we devoured them in a quickness. To wash it all down we got the iced Thai tea. Disappointed I didn't get a second one for the road home it was that good.We will be returning to this establishment and telling everyone we know about it. Wonderful job guys, keep up the great work."], ["Lyric L.", "Probably the best Vietnamese food I've ever had, AND it's super affordable. The noodle box is life changingAnd the Bahn Mi.... Words can describe the taste of the Bahn mi. The salt and pepper wings are amazing! I could eat 15 lbs of them. If you're in the neighborhood... Or even if you're not... Come to Viet Ha! You won't regret it"], ["Crystal C.", "Viet Ha has been on the list of bookmarks for a while now, so when our dinner plans were abruptly cancelled last night, we finally went. Not sorry.Parking was kind of a pain and we had to circle a few times, but once we got into the restaurant everything was great. The service was super friendly and explained how their menu works. We each got a bahn mi and a drink and the total was $15 - totally affordable. We waited less than 10 minutes and they have Sriracha out on the tables so you can go nuts. The sandwiches are bigger than expected and the bread and veggies were really good. The bread was fresh and soft, but still crusty. The pickled carrots were perfect. The beef was honestly a little sweet for my tastes, but the hot sauce remedied that and I really enjoyed the sandwich overall. I couldn't even finish the second half and ended up taking it to go.We will totally be back soon and look forward to trying a noodle bowl and some spring rolls! I wish this place was closer to my work so I could get it for lunch!"], ["Steve L.", "Went in for the delicious Chicken wings but got an earful of the cook having a completely inappropriate conversation with his friend on the other side counter. \u00a0 How about teaching the staff how to be professional. \u00a0To make matters worse, there was a family with two young children sitting in the \u00a0restaurant."], ["Danielle C.", "This place feels very Americanized but I thought the food was tasty regardless. There is no pho here, only sandwiches and rice or noodle boxes. They give you a lot of food for $10 or so which is a good deal.The meat was well cooked and slightly sweet. It went well in the box. I really liked their pickled daikon and carrots. The sauce was just what I wanted."], ["Rainbow W.", "I love coming here on my lunch break.. I work in downtown and its super convenient due to their \"order at the counter\" type thing. It is super quick and everything is made fresh. I usually get the noodle box with CHICKEN.. something about their chicken is super yummy.. its perfectly marinated charbroiled chicken (and they LOAD IT UP!!) definitely get a lot for what you pay.Today, I ordered a Banh mi sandwich instead just to try something different and change it up. IT WAS AMAZING! They use the charbroiled meats for the banh mi.. nothing like those stores in South Sac where they use the processed meat. NOTHING LIKE THAT! it was bomb dot com! The French roll was really fresh.. most places serve their banh mi on stale French rolls.. gross."], ["Yao C.", "I heard a lot of hype on this place and we finally went down on a Saturday to try this place for lunch!It does have its pros and cons:Pros: the food is good! They have the choice of a noodle box, rice box, and banh mi. The meat selection is between beef, chicken, and pork. They have veggie selection and also shrimp. All the garnish is optional: lettuce, fried shallots, peanuts, bean sprouts, cilantro, and diced carrots and daikon.The appetizers selection: deep fried wings marinated in with jalape\u00f1os, cheese puffs, and egg rolls. We ordered 4 noodle boxes: 1 beef, 2 chickens, and 1 pork! They were all delicious and full of flavor! All the meats were tender and juicy! The noodles were vermicelli.... And you get a choice of tangy vinaigrette (fish sauce) or the soy sauce. I had the soy and I loved it, and everyone else has the vinaigrette and they enjoyed it very well. We ordered 3 sides of wings, 1 order of cheese puff and 4 orders of egg rolls! We killed everything and was so full!!! The service is great! Employees are friendly and full of energy! They give good suggestions and consistently making sure there customers are satisfied! \u00a0Cons: size: the place is very small and if you have a large party, good luck finding a table! It has counter seating as well... And at times, ordering to go is better if the place is jamming! Also, parking isn't very good because it's all street.... And my boy got a dang ticket... We all didn't see the sign \"no parking beyond this point!\" Lastly, the selection is limited but they are all good!Overall we had a great experience! We enjoyed the food, service and the experience!

This is a limited option menu with only rice/noodle boxes available or banh mi sandwiches. I ordered a rice noodle box with pork and their tangy vinaigrette sauce (aka fish sauce). The meat wasn't as flavorful as I am use to eating at their Florin Road location. It was a bit tender and chewy as well. Prices here are decent for the amount of food you get. Simple ordering formation similar to Chipotle. Choose either rice or noodles, type of protein along with accompanying garnishments. Located on Broadway directly across the street from the DMV. There isn't a private parking lot; only street parking is available. The venue is pretty small with limited seating capacity. I think this place is catered mainly for the to-go lunch crowd (like myself)."], ["Douglas E.", "This place definitely has good food.

Yum yummm"], ["Ben W.", "Not what I was expecting but pleasantly surprised...When I looked up Viet Ha, I was expecting a traditional sit-down Vietnamese restaurant. I was craving some tasty pho noodles, and was greeted with a Chipotle-style Vietnamese assembly. Choose your grain (noodles or rice) and your protein and your sauce. All entrees come with an assortment of veggies on top. I went for the noodles with a beef and shrimp combo.The final product is basically a glorified bun, but the ingredients were very fresh and well-cooked. The shrimp had a great seasoning and were still very tender. The beef wasn't what I was expecting, although tbh I was picturing Chipotle steak haha.The real star of the show were the wings. I could honestly eat a whole meal consisting only of these wings. Some many things were perfect: the texture, the tenderness, the flavors, the crispness, the peppers sprinkled on top, the portion, the price, etc. I really wish I have found wings like these in NYC. Anyone have suggestions??"], ["Lucy M.", "I came here after reading Patrick Y's review...not once but twice. Yup...I've been here already and liked it so much that \u00a0I went back for more.

Select a bahn mi sandwich, noodle box, or rice box, a type of meat and the vegetable trimmings. \u00a0I love the noodle box with beef. \u00a0The salad is super fresh and the savory soy dressing is delicious. \u00a0Should you decide to come to Viet Ha be sure to bring your appetite because the portions are generous. \u00a0Added Bonus: \u00a0The food here is conveniently packaged in a box. \u00a0All sauces and dressings are in little containers as well so you may add as much as your taste desires. \u00a0Thus if you are a person who never makes your own lunch this would be a great place for you. \u00a0You gotta try it for yourself...its yummylicious ;);)"], ["Carolyn G.", "I hail from Silicon Valley, where the nearest equivalent is Asian Box. For the same price, I get twice as much food and can control the amount of sauce. It's a slightly simpler menu, but I appreciate not having a gazillion options when I want something simple and healthy and quick! If you're gluten-free, you are limited to the vinaigrette, which is totally fine. Turns out there is a tofu protein option, but it's not on the menu. You have to ask for that.The servers are super nice and service is ridiculously fast.The only thing that would be nice is to not fill the sauce cups to overflowing, use tamari instead of soy sauce (for GF folks), and maybe have a slightly sturdier box. But those are incredibly minor details. I plan to stop by here whenever possible."], ["Kurt C.", "Noodle box (vermicelli) w/ beef and savory soy dressing -- order it and be full, happy, and thankful that I told you so ~And for only $6.99?? That box was heavy and satisfying. What's even more important was its taste! The quality was in tact: beef was flavorful and tender, vermicelli was soft with the perfect texture, veggies light & fresh, and the sauce was definitely living up to its name -- savory and a kick of sweet. If you're looking for a quick, affordable, and hefty meal that'll quiet your Vietnamese hunger pangs, this is the place to go. I've already gone twice the past week. I wish I lived closer. Cool new spot with an amazing staff and delicious food!"], ["Chris E.", "I've had about 11 Bahn Mi Sandwiches from Viet Ha. They are fantastic. I started ordering them with the Savory Soy sauce that they have and pair it with an ice-cold Coke, (which I recommend if you're a soda drinker). They Savory Soy gives it a little boost in flavor, not that it's lacking any, but it's a nice addition. The veggies inside are fresh, crunchy, and always flavorful. Daikon, carrots, cilantro, and jalape\u00f1os. The chicken wings are a pretty good salty add-on. They get their kick from some sliced jalape\u00f1os. I'd order again when in the mood. Same with the egg rolls. It's your basic spring roll, deep fried and served with a side or sweet/sour red glaze. Seating is limited inside. It can get packed at lunch time during the week. They have seats along the wall and tables near the entrance. I usually take my food to-go and eat at home so as not to scare anyone with the fervor in which I eat my Bahn Mi. \u00a0Parking can be a small challenge. You might have to park on the corner of Broadway and 24th or 25th and walk to the building. Which is no problem. Staff is friendly and happy to help with suggestions. Overall, I recommend this place and will continue going for the Bahn Mi Sandwich."], ["Ashley C.", "An old coworker invited me to like Viet Ha's Facebook page, and I am always down to try new places so I'm glad we finally got the chance to stop here for lunch today. They have a good location off of Broadway. We came right at opening so it wasn't crowded around 10:45am at all. \u00a0Their decor is simple and clean, yet very hip. Same with the menu - it's very simple and they break it down easy for you: protein, toppings, and dressing. They even have a few appetizers. I went with the vermicelli box, with chicken, and everything but bean sprouts and peanuts. I chose the fish sauce, which isn't a dressing option on the menu but I saw some containers by the register so I knew they had it available. The portion is huge! I ate half and I was already full. It was fresh and tasted great. I enjoyed my boyfriend's beef vermicelli box with savory soy dressing as well. I have a few favorite Vietnamese places near home but I wouldn't mind driving out here again. The only thing that was missing were some drink options. They only had sodas and canned drinks in the fridge available :("], ["Jackie T.", "Happy to see that Viet Ha has another location closer to where I now live. I used to live 5 minutes away from the original location in South Sac. But unlike the original location, the menu isn't as extensive, but they have their most famous dish: the vermicelli noodle (or rice box). Depending on the number of protein you get, the price varies. For one protein, it's $6.99. For two protein, it's $8.99. What they mean by protein is pork, chicken, beef, or shrimp to go with your rice or noodle box. There are also six different types of garnishes that you can add to your rice or noodle box, and it also comes with fish sauce. I personally got the two protein rice box. Got the beef with chicken and it tastes just as delicious as I remembered at their original South Sac location. The portions are huge, so I stretched it out and made two meals out of it. If the noodle or rice isn't your thing, they also have a banh mi sandwich on their menu.I think this location is perfect for people working downtown and/or the State workers clientele looking for a quick inexpensive meal. I know I will be back, even if I have to drive a bit just to get here from the office!"], ["Karen K.", "This was my first time to this Vietnamese restaurant. Nicely decorated with seating facing the right brick wall reminiscent of the walls of buildings in Old Sac. There were about dozen bar stool seats there.There was also seating for a total of 14 closer to the door.The restaurants interior was done in a modern way. There was street parking in front plus parking along the left side of the restaurant and parking for four cars located behind the restaurant.We got here early when they first opened up at 1030 am. They were conveniently close to the DMV building where the state employees work. I'm sure there will be a rush later!

Take my word for it.By the way there is a nice clean bathroom in the back if someone needs it; I usually do:)You can bet on it I will be back on a number of times!

Everything we've ordered is A-MA-ZING. It is especially comforting that we know when we ask for vegetarian/vegan they don't even bat an eye. When we order the vegetarian hot and sour they even double check that eggs are okay. Every. single. time. Anyone who \u00a0adheres to a vegan diet can appreciate that the business is looking out for the dietary concerns of the customer, without the customer having to sound nagging or picky. That being said, lets talk food. Hot and sour soup (flavorful and clear-your-sinuses spicy) and veggie lemon 'chicken' are a must. The lemon chicken is not the little nuggets that you find at most Chinese places, but a flank of faux-breast, breaded and covered in a sweet and tangy sauce. It somehow defies physics and avoids sogginess even if you take your time devouring it (like that is possible) or -- as we do -- frequently take the food to go. We're trying delivery for the first time tonight, so we will see how that holds up.After the hot and sour and the lemon 'chicken', the next favorite is a toss up between the Szechuan broccoli and the vegetarian broccoli 'beef'. The beef is comprised of thin slivers of seitan, which I am not usually the biggest fan of, but their sauce is so savory and flavorful I just think of the seitan like a chip -- something to transport the delicious sauce into my face. The veggie hot and sour chicken was also a hit due to the perfect flavoring, and we always top the order off with a side of egg rolls, and sometimes some chow mein.Holy crap.

Traditionally, there is supposed to tendon so it's not weird or sketchy or anything, but I would've liked some more actual meat Noodle with Meat Sauce (Ja Jiang Mian): Loved the noodles. Loved the huge portion. Sauce surprised me since I'm used to ground meat and just black bean sauce but this one had mushrooms in it - guess it was a vegetarian version of the sauce?

They are one of the best I've had out of quite a few restaurants and they give you so much at a great price (around $8 and 6 portions). Bread so warm and delicious and the meat is tender and the sauce/fillings don't overpower anything. The bread with pork fillings is also good but if you had to choose go with beef rolls!ALSO get the beef noodle soup! Hand made noodles with a great savory broth with plenty of veggies. If you've never had beef noodle soup and want to be adventurous and awesome go for this dish. Pretty authentic, big portion and delicious. My not so great experience has been eating the dumplings, which was so sad for me as dumplings are my favorite food of all time and I can eat them all day every day. Their filling was probably the least tasty I've had out of so many restaurants I've lost track. I got the pork and cabbage dumplings and it just tasted almost alcoholic and was a bit rubbery. I would definitely not recommend getting this dish. The restaurant is pretty quite on weekdays but that means service is quick and wonderful.

Lots of tendon/skin. Fried rice - surprisingly tasty.Szechuan boiled fish - not 100% szechuan, but it was spicy and good.Shredded potato - Refreshingly spicy. A bit oily.Beef pancake roll - Good. Flavorful.The handmade noodle is good. Not world class hand pulled noodles, but something that tastes rustic and homemade. Definitely recommend trying it.

Right when you walk in, fresh air, clean floor and walls ( i know u know what im talking about).2. They played classical music instead of traditional Chinese culture music, or even chinese pop music.I wont go into detail the dishes me and my Feyonce ordered, just know that they tasted different and had their own unique flavors. \u00a0Why does this matter? You know when you go to an asian restaurant and can taste that all their dishes taste the same? \u00a0Like they've cooked the rice, soup, noodles all in the same pot? Even though they are named differently? \u00a0NOT this place. Food is GREAT. NOT greasy!! One item i have to speak on is their Walnut Shrimp. \u00a0Probably the staple/safety choice for most non asian individuals. \u00a0Other places ive tried, the breading is thick, or it just gets soggy at the end of the course. \u00a0This was not the case here. \u00a0The breading was light but CRUNCHY. \u00a0Even for dessert i had one more, crunchy bro. Also the SHRIMP. \u00a0A lot of places, the meat of the shrimp, the flavor, is just bland. \u00a0Now im not saying you can taste the ocean or anything, but it has that \"sea\" flavor. \u00a0Namsayn? Ugh. Hard to describe, but know that their shrimp just tastes FRESH.Last thing that was awesome.

Came in today for lunch around 12:30 and it was a PACKED HOUSE! Luckily, we were seated right away and our food even came out SUPER QUICK! We ordered the Beef Stew Soup ($8.50) and the Chinese Beef Roll ($7.50). The beef stew soup actually had handmade noodles which were really good! It came with a decent amount of ox tail, cilantro, and around 3-4 stalks of bok choy. The broth, however, was a bit too salty for my liking and for $8.50 i'd rate it a 3/5 (I've had much better Taiwanese food the bay area i.e.Ma Liang's and Fusion House). Their Chinese beef roll was decently sized (not worth $7.50 in my opinion) and it didn't come with any sweet hot sauce so it was a bit dry. The beef they added was really THIN cut--to the point where it reminded me of a Subway sandwich (THEY NEVER GIVE YOU ENOUGH MEAT) AND it had cucumbers inside of it. I've never had it with cucumbers inside but it was a bit overpowering. I would rate these dishes a 3/5.Next time I come I plan on trying the XLB and other pot stickers/dumplings they serve. The pictures people post on Yelp make me salivate! The service was a 5/5! It was really refreshing to see a friendly face right when we walked in! A young girl greeted us and, later on, the owner--I think-- (an older white male) made sure we had everything we needed and were taken care of.

They were thick enough to hold up the meat sauce.Chive shrimp & pork dumpling- Each bite into a dumpling was hot and juicy. Chinese beef roll- Crispy and flaky. The sliced beef was thin though.

By \"veiny\", I mean there's a slab of fatty stringy chunk of tissue with a cylindrical \"tube\" adhering to it. The opening of the \"tube\"(vein) was big enough for a standard-sized sharpie marker to effortlessly glide through.Not very appetizing! You'd have to swallow the pieces whole in order to consume these cheap cuts of meat. Even if you attempt to masticate these cuts of meat, you'll keep wasting your energy chewing forever with no progress in breaking it down. Although, this will be an ideal \"meat-chew\": if you're craving meat flavor, pop one of these suckers in, get your meat fix & spit it out (like \u00a0tobacco chew).The handmade noodles were okay: they were drenched in sesame seed oil (overkill!!), so that in conjunction with the cheap cuts of meat pretty much ruined the soup. The soup itself was decent--nothing special-- but once the sesame seed oil-drenched noodles were added, the soup transformed into a greasy gulf, while killing the decent broth flavor in the process.Perhaps I was supposed to pour off the excess oil & kill a roll of paper towels while trying to dab the oil off before introducing the noodles to the broth?!Hopefully the reasoning for this \u00a0(which is still unacceptable) would be that it's the end of the night, therefore the \"last of the soup/meat\" in the pot. The beef roll was OK. Again it was takeout, so the roll was not crispy by the time I got it. They failed to cut venting holes in the styrofoam, thus it became soggy. I liked how the beef in this was actual deli-like slices of flavorful beef \u00a0& was much easier to eat compared to beef rolls with shave bits of beef.The flavor of the beef noodle soup is nothing to wow about compared to SoCal places. Based on what I received for my soup this time, I'm not sure if I'd give this place another try w/ the noodle soups.. maybe if I was really craving it or give it another try again if I decide to order another beef roll from here.Tip for those who order beef rolls/fried stuff to go: make sure make vents in the container as soon as you get it."], ["Karen T.", "Came here with my friends and we tried the beef noodle soup, beef wrap, soup dumplings, and noodles with meat sauce.Out of all those dishes, the beef wrap was the best in flavor and texture. Definitely order one on your visit!The soup dumplings were big and good in flavor, but the skin was very thick, so it could have been better. I found the beef noodle soup to be a little too strong in flavor. I typically loveee slurping up my soup, but could not do it with this one. The beef tasted good though!I was excited to try the noodles with meat sauce because I'm on the search for good tasting black bean sauce noodles... but the thick noodles served with the dish killed it for me. The noodles were thick and heavy, which made eating the dish overall a little difficult. I think if the noodles were thinner, then it might have been okay.Service wasn't terrible, but it definitely could have been better. We had to flag down the waitress to tell them her we were ready to place our order. Also to note... you have to go up and pay since they had the fancy iPad style register for you to sign on. That kind of threw us off since the check was brought to us, but they told us we would have to go up front to pay.

The staff here was very attentive and friendly. We ordered the lion's head meatballs, beef noodle soup, and XLB. The meatballs was our favorite. Super flavorful and moist. The beef noodle soup was also really good. We really liked the broth here. The XLB were the only item that was a little bit of a disappointment. The wrappers that they were in were very thick and chewy and when we ate them there wasn't any liquid in them."], ["Karen K.", "Wanted to try Taiwanese Chinese cooking. I am American born Chinese and grew up with Cantonese Chinese parents. I never experienced any other kinds of Chinese food except the spicy Szechuan in my adult life.It's cool to have this type of cooking within 20 minutes of our home. We found it easily as they had signs and address clearly marked. The place looked renovated and new! Bathrooms available in the back and were decent. \u00a0There was a large table in the back room that could hold maybe 15-18 people.We overheard the manager talking to another customer saying they hand make their noodles. Pretty awesome, huh?I ordered entrees to go: Beef noodle soup, pork meatballs, beef roll and jaija mein (pork noodles). Everything was cooked to order and came out quickly! I'm sure we didn't wait for more than 15-20 minutes. There was only one other lady customer in the restaurant.When we finally got around to eating, I really liked the beef roll except a member of the family said it has cilantro in it. I didn't have it in my slice but I guess I better mention it when I order it next time to request it without it. \u00a0The noodles were great with the pork sauce and slices of cucumbers. Also the pork meatballs were huge!!! I barely can eat one whole one. \u00a0I liked the cooked cabbage underneath. The beef noodle soup was average to me plus there was cilantro in it too.I don't normally eat Chinese food often but I \u00a0may come back more for the beef roll & other entrees.Try it out if you're in the area. I know if you work at UCDMC that it's conveniently on Stockton Boulevard and on the drive home toward South Sacramento & Elk Grove.It's different cooking style from the Cantonese but in a good way. Always good to try something new!"], ["Rob L.", "Across the street from King Palace.Was looking for good Taiwanese food and not having to drive to Hometown Chinese in Davis. \u00a0We've come here in the past, but noticed that there was more recent buzz on Yelp regarding their Taiwanese offerings.Ordered a bunch of stuff to create our own sampling menu, the xiao long baos, beef roll, beef noodle soup, scallion pancakes, pork chop rice, and yang chow fried rice. \u00a0All were awesome, the pork chop is a huge portion, could be better with some pickled veggies, but the flavor was awesome. \u00a0Xiao long baos were great too, obviously not Din Tai Fung, but what is? \u00a0Recommended if you're looking for Taiwanese fare!"], ["Margaret T.", "We finally got the chance to try this place out tonight. Our first attempt was a fail due to no parking, but today when we drove by the lot wasn't full so we pulled in. The service was really quick. After ordering we received our food within 10 minutes. What we ordered:Beef Noodle Soup - after reading reviews about this dish I thought that we had to try it. The bowl was big enough for us to share (with leftovers). The dish was seasoned well and had very tender, fatty pieces of beef. The noodles were handmade and are, in my opinion, the heart of this dish. I expected it to blow me away after reading the reviews, maybe I over sold myself on it, but the soup is good, not great. Beef Roll - very easy to eat in that it doesn't fall part when you pick it up and the beef is tender enough to bite through. Heavy on the scallion but this is a good dish. Bean curd & Pork - this was my favorite thing we got. It was seasoned perfectly and I would definitely recommend. Green Onion Pancake w/ Egg - tasty but not very different from other places where I have tried. If you are planning to order I would say get it without egg. All in all Yang's Noodle is good and I'm glad I stopped in today to check them out. If you're in the area and looking for a smaller, more condensed menu then I would recommend."], ["Julie S.", "My first time trying Taiwanese food and I was quite impressed! It's definitely not your average Chinese restaurant so don't come here expecting the typical orange chicken and greasy chow mien. Me and my friend had no idea what to order so we just let our Chinese friend order all our dishes since he was Chinese and had been here before. Here's a breakdown of what we tried:Beef Noodle Soup - This was so DELICIOUS! Can't wait to come back here on a cold day to try it again! Love that the noodles really taste home made. Large enough to share if you are getting another dish or two.Xiao Long Bao - These were super YUMMY! Tip... I guess you are suppose to pop these on your spoon or eat it whole so you can taste the soup that's in the bun. But these were so big, I couldn't do it. They were just as yummy as me popping them on my plate and tearing it up to eat.Beef Roll - This was okay. It was a little bland but the meat was actually really tender and tasty. I think the pastry just thew me off because it was too thick and couldn't taste all the flavor.Service overall was great. Also, they didn't charge us for tea. A big pet peeve of mine at Chinese restaurants is when they charge. Tea is so cheap, just give it to me for free! Can't wait to come back here and try the other things, especially the hot pots!"], ["Regina W.", "When I arrived on a Sunday at 11:30 a.m. there were two other tables that were full and more people walking in. The atmosphere of the main dining area was clean, but very bare bones and with minimal decorations. All of the tables in the front area sat 4+ people, so I got the impression that people are expected to come and dine here in groups rather than solo or in pairs.I was kind of surprised how many vegetarian options were on the menu to choose from and ended up ordering the Mixed Vegetable Dumplings (10) for $7.25 and the Five Spice Bean Curd for $4.95.You could tell that the Mixed Vegetable Dumplings were fresh when they arrived on the table. I had to wait for them to cool a bit after I ate my first one because they were still very hot. I sort of liked the dumplings, but they weren't anything I would come back for specifically to get.The Five Spice Bean Curd consisted of these thin strips of cold marinated tofu that were not spicy even though you might think so based on the name. It tasted alright, but was not something that I would recommend.The service was also slower than it should of been and at one point my water glass sat empty. There should of been better communication that I should pay up front too because I sat waiting for them to pick up the check for 10-15 minutes until I was finally told to take it to the front.Overall, I had an OK experience here, but don't really plan on coming back. Check it out and see for yourself what you think."], ["Yvonne N.", "I really wanted to like Yang's Noodles. I was pretty excited to try their XLB's after finding out there was supposedly a decent XLB spot in Sacramento! Perhaps it was because my expectations were so high, I was so utterly disappointed. We ordered XLB, potstickers, green onion and egg pancake and Korean style noodle soup and weren't really impressed with anything. Let's start from what I enjoyed most down to the very least. Surprisingly, the green onion and egg pancake were my fave! Flaky, crunchy and perfect with egg. Next up would be the Korean style noodle soup. Their noodles are homemade and you can definitely tell because of their texture. \u00a0However, the Korean style broth was bland and the soup wasn't hot enough. Next time, and there will be a next time, I would probably order their beef noodle soup! \u00a0And finally, the XLB and potstickers probably tie for last because they tasted the same to me. The wrapper was way too thick but the optimist in me thought \"well, at least that means none of the yummy soup could escape!\" However, with the first bite came absolutely no juice. And btw, they're called Juicy Dumplings on their menu. :(On the bright side, I had a lot of leftovers to take home and those babies landed on a pan to be fried. Honestly, I probably would have given a 2 star review but the day was saved when they came off the fryer.

She is abrupt and short, slams things down, shoulder checks you if you're sitting near the walk way, and generally just makes being there unpleasant. Walk in with a good mood, leave pissed off.

They refill your drinks and tries to get you in and out. Your food comes out super fast! But the owners are absolutely adorable and nice. The only thing I don't like is when your plate is cleaned they come by so fast to pick it up. Are they short on plates?

If you've ever been to June's Cafe down V St, that's what this place reminds me of, right off the bat -- a fusion of American diner and Asian food. I ordered their Fried Rice w/ two fresh eggs (scrambled) and bean sprouts. I also added some bacon and Chinese sausage just to make for a hefty meal. It definitely was one of the better plates I've had for lunch; not your average fried rice mixture, and I like that nothing was overpowered by excessive seasoning. The hot sauce I drizzled generously atop gave it a little kick and more flavor, which I highly suggest if you have a lot of tolerance for spice like I do. Good first visit, overall. I'm in no particular rush to come back, although I'm not opposed to accepting an invitation for a lunch break here either. Seating can be very limited and service, albeit semi-present, isn't anything to look forward to.

Anyway, I kept seeing lots of rave reviews over their pancakes, so I went with the order of 2 pancakes and 2 french toast. Everything was moist and fluffy. I can see why people think the pancakes are so yummy - I agree! I wish I had ordered pancakes with a side of egg or bacon instead... my plate was basically a plate of starch so it got overwhelming after a while. But that didn't take away from how delicious it was..so I decided to take my leftovers home. \u00a0I also ordered a tropical iced tea on the side, which turned out to be unsweetened, but if you add two sugar packets, it's perfect!My second choice off the menu would have been the fried rice, so luckily my boyfriend ordered that! I had a bite (or two..or three) and I really enjoyed it! It had lots of flavor and they give a generous portion for $8-9. The service is far from personable but they give you everything you need, and it's very fast. The place is limited in space, but by noon time, it was packed.

There is soMuch variety on his menu and everything you order comes out fresh and they are all at a reasonable price $$$$!!!First off, the location is decent, on 16th street and the parking isn't my favorite because it's on a busy street! If you are lucky, you can parallel park right in front of his restaurant; or you have to park somewhere that is walking distance. Inside the restaurant is pretty small and if you go on weekends chances are you will have to wait..... It's popular for breakfast and lunch! They do have couple of tables outside which is nice, especially if it's a nice day!My absolutely favorite dish at Harry's is the Chicken fried steak with two poached eggs and white rice!!!! It has the best gravy which has green onions over it and when you mix that with the steak, rice, and eggs it is a bite of heaven!!!!! The steak is incredibly thin and tender and the batter is delicious!!!!After i eat that, I order two pancakes because they are the best!!! The pancakes are fluffy and sweet!!! So good!!!Other wonderful dishes is the famous beef short ribs that are soooooo good!!! The gravy is so tasty and it comes with potatoes and carrots over rice!!! (You can order extra gravy too). Also, you can order a fried egg over it!!!! That is my second favorite dish, and my third favorite dish is the ox tail stew over white rice!!! Similar to the beef short ribs but the ox tail meat is great and you can suck the bone!!!!Harry's also has excellent fried rice plates, especially Harry's fried ride and the curry fried rice!! Tip: Always get a fried egg on top!!! I go to Harry's probably once a week and always enjoy talking to Harry and his work crew! The service is great, the employees are friendly and nice and always take your order fast and get the food out quick!!!

I added a side of bacon and an iced Vietnamese coffee. The coffee was amazing and the pancakes were incredible, perfectly light and fluffy with a slight crisp and not overly sweet. I was a happy camper.My friend had the Harry's omelet and must have been happy as there was not a speck left on his plate.The only reason this place gets 4 instead of 5 stars is that my boyfriend ordered the pork chop with two eggs and steamed rice, and his pork chop, although very well seasoned, was also quite dry.

They also have good Vietnamese and American dinners.There are literally a dozen Chinese restaurants within a mile or so of Harrys, and I have tried them all. Most of them are mediocre. Some are downright terrible. For this reason I wanted to write a review. You can tell that Harry's food is high quality and fresh. There is a brightness to it.

That alone impressed me to no end.Then the food came. Aww man...food coma in the making and worth every bite! The rice was so flavorful and the eggs were cooked perfectly. I got mine with Chinese sausage, and there was lots of it mixed in. If it wasn't for my fellow Yelpers' reviews, I never would have thought to try the pancakes. They were amazing! Some of the best I've ever had. So buttery and the crispy edges...omg to die for.

The food was hot, fresh and tasted authentic! The portion sizes were good enough for us to take home leftovers!The reason I couldn't give them the full 5 star rating is simple - wait times were too long! First of all, the restaurant is VERY small. We must have waited 30-45 minutes to sit down and because the restaurant is so small, you have to wait outside - in the cold! Because the restaurant was getting busier after we arrived about halfway through our meal they set up some seating outside! I'm sure if they did this sooner, I might not have had to wait so long.

When the server (he may have been the manager) noticed my disappointment he informed me that two of his cooks were out with the flu so they had to stop early that weekend. He offered to let me still pick my favorites and he would have them prepared for me and they were delicious!

I have high standards for my dim sum, maybe because I grew up in the East Bay where the best dim sum outside of Hong Kong is birthed. New Canton Restaurant has a parking lot that fits about 20 cars, compact spots and you probably won't find a spot in the lot on a weekend day unless you come before 10:30am. The food was subpar, it wasn't bad, but I knew it was the bombdiggity that I've been accustomed to. The problem for me wasn't the food, it was average. For Sacramento, dim sum was pretty good (to be fair). The service thoughhhh, oh nooooo. Yes, the culture can be different, but that isn't a pass on having terrible service. I come from a Chinese background and I know bad service, bad manners, etc. But my experience made it so that I probably won't be coming back ever. At dim sum places, the waiters/waitresses reach in constantly to grab the empty dishes, but that doesn't mean they should spill all over your plate and personal area. Even if they spill, they should at least acknowledge it and/or replace the plate that they spilled on...right? No one wants to eat out of a plate that was spilled on. This next thing made me laugh more than anything, but I felt pretty bad for my friend. The waiter spilled all over my friend's head. Yikes. He was sleepy so it woke him up but still... a sorry doesn't do! Charging us extra, TWO times (corrected them once) doesn't help either. Maybe because we are all young adults (21ish) so they think they can get us? But nahhhh we in college, we smart man. Anywho, don't think I'll be back.

Haven't seen that happen ever. Usually it's just 50% or something. Anyway, they came out with plates after plates after plates of food. First, it was this abalone soup. This is SO good. I really like it. It was flavorful. It didn't have a fishy taste to it either. For those that don't like the fish taste, get this because no or little fish taste. However, that might be the only item I did like. Next was deep fried crab meat. I usually would like this, but this time it just didn't taste as good. The texture was crunchy and soft on the inside, but it wasn't juicy compared to other places. Next was lobster and quail. The lobster was spicy! It was good, but I didn't wanna get messy, so I had to use my utensils to get the meat out. This was the first time I had quail. I've had quail eggs when I was young, and I didn't like it. Similarly, I don't like the quail. I was hesitant because I based it off of the eggs, but my bf said it's like duck. I ate it, and tasted like liver, and I hate liver. So ew. Next few dishes were veggies. They're just veggies so they're....okay. Next came the crab. I like crab, but don't like to get messy in public, so again I used my utensils to pick out the meat. Next came a fish dish and the salty fish and chicken fried rice. I actually did like the fish, but it was on the bland side unless you get the sauce/oils from the fish. I've had fish were it was good by itself. The fried rice was good, but I didn't get a lot because we had to share. It wasn't as salty as other places I've tried so kudos!We were there for about 3 hours. Not once did a waiter check up on us. If we wanted something, we had to go up to them and ask for it. I know it's a big group, but come on. Check up on every table once in a while. I went thirsty or just kept drinking tea the whole night.Also, I just felt like the workers seemed annoyed when serving us or getting something we had asked for like we're asking them to get us all gold. Again, yes we're a big group, but that shouldn't mean that your service should be shooty.Overall, I guess this place is good. Had a few good items and some not so good. It might just be an acquired taste. Quail...never again for me. If you like liver, try the quail. I do suggest the abalone soup! Really tasty! Wish I got more of the soup.

The waiter was efficient, extremely quiet, and polite enough (distant). The food was ok. The hot and sour soup was better than a lot of places I've had so that got high ranks with me. The meat was a bit chewy and the broccoli tasted a little weird and the rice had an interesting texture. Again I'm picky about Chinese food having been spoiled my whole life by Mandarin Gourmet in the Bay Area. In comparison this place would get one star but it is in Sacramento. For Sacramento it gets 3 for being edible. There was no dipping sauce for my egg roll but rather they pre sprinkled sauce on it. Also most disturbing was how bombarded with religion I was. The radio was on the fish and everything from music to commercial was religious and about specifically Jesus. That's great but maybe the name should be changed to Mrs. Kim's religious Chinese food. With the logo \"jesus on every plate\" in honor of my love for Gilmore girls! That would turn it into an event and solicit me to come back. Also there were invitations to join the Rock church instead of advertisements on the table for the food they serve. Possibly food isn't their calling. I couldn't tell if I was eating Chinese food or back at church. Did I just get saved? Also everyone has a right to their own religious choices however it Is a public business. I thought it a bit tacky and exclusionary to not be mindful of other patrons who might have a different religious view or none at all. Actually wait after all of that I think I'm going back to my original desire to put a 2.

Food was good, veggies nice and fresh and still maintained their crispness, the orange chicken was little doughy , i prefer and love it when its still crispy in its coating. but still not bad. the pork fried rice was nicely done. the veggies mixed in were still crunchy and flavorful to the contribution to the rice as a whole dish. price is reasonable for the basic items i got. I will most likely return as the location and price and ease of ordering is super convenient."], ["Samantha N.", "A friend was craving Chinese food so here we are! The food was pretty standard with good portions. There's a dinner special for $8.99 that includes a small bowl of soup, an egg roll, choice of entree, choice of rice or noodles and a beverage. Not too shabby. I actually took advantage of the separate entrees cause I didn't care for soup or egg roll. I got MONGOLIAN BEEF ($8.50) and BBQ PORK FRIED RICE ($6.50). It was a good amount to share with my BF. Again, standard Chinese food to me but family style saves you money. The customer service was good. Refilled water and asked if everything was okay. They also gave use fortune cookies and a slice of orange for dessert. I would give this place a try if you're craving Chinese food and near the area."], ["J C.", "Was craving Chinese food and randomly chose this place for delivery based on proximity to where I live. I was very pleasantly surprised with how good the food was and how nicely it was all packed; no messy spills and leaks.

Definitely will order from them again!"], ["Jenni T.", "I came to Chef Bo for lunch on a Thursday with my coworker Alesha S. because they have a lunch special where you get a meat/tofu dish with chow mein or rice, a cream cheese wonton and egg drop soup.The decor inside is nice and new with fresh paint on the walls and nice floors. The service is friendly and attentive and even made a substitution on the menu for me which was nice. I ordered the lunch special with Orange Tofu and Chow Mein. The Egg Flower Soup was OK because I'm not a big fan of that kind of soup in the first place. I loved the Cream Cheese Wonton and thought it was a nice treat. The Chow Mein had good flavor as well, and the Orange Tofu could have been cooked a little longer (a little softer in the middle than I usual like) but I did like the orange sauce that it came with because it wasn't too sweet. My coworker liked the taste of her Mongolian Chicken, but there were too many onions and seriously lacking in chicken so it was quite disappointing.I would come back here again when craving Chinese Food because they have great lunch specials. They also have cheap drinks which I may have to partake in next time as well."], ["Hu L.", "Food was good, price is great! \u00a0Service is really good. I got a Yelp promo discount for this place so it was definitely worth it to come here to try out. It was really slow for a Friday night but it wasn't super dead. It was nice and quiet inside, and they played Christian music the whole time we were there. I also saw on their alcohol drink menu an advertisement for worship hours at a local church which was pretty odd... Nonethless, parking was plentiful and inside was beautiful and ambient. I would recommend this place if you like americanized Chinese food and good deals. However, if you want more authentic Chinese food, this is not the place to get it."], ["Tamara S.", "Bomb af!!!

I swear like 30 seconds after receiving our food the waitress came and placed the check on out table that really bugged me. A table across was two white guys eating their food in peace no check was brought to them anytime soon as a matter a fact when we left no check was on their table that really annoyed me.

I think not!!I suddenly got a craving for Chinese food on Friday night, and loved the idea of having delivery. I had never gotten Chef Bo before, but they were close and did delivers to my location.It began to go downhill when the waitress could not understand my street location. Even though I spelt it out slowly 5 times, which at a certain point becomes crazy. I'm not sure if the delivery driver got loss, but it took them nearly an hour to deliver our food even though we were only 10 minutes away.We got orange chicken, vegetable fried rice and honey walnut shrimp, which was almost 30 dollars. I understand with delivery you are paying more, but that seemed on the high end. In the end, the price was not worth the food at all.The orange chicken seemed very fatty and had very little orange flavor. This was surprising since there was giant orange rinds still coated to the orange chicken. The orange chicken was mostly sticky and flavorless and extremely chewy! Ew!The honey walnut shrimp was just as bad. It was covered in a thick layer of sauce that tasted like day old mayo. It was slimy and even though I love shrimp, I could not suffer through eating it. The fried rice was just OK. Pretty salty, but the best out of the three. But really how can you mess up rice and veggies?In the future I'll make the effort to drive to better and cheaper Chinese restaurant."], ["Allie C.", "I decided to come here on a whim because I remember one of my nuggets asked for noodles for dinner on Friday, a break from our usual pizza on Fridays..since they're having a sleepover tomorrow I figure pizza is good to feed three boys..anyway, I called in an order since I saw that they had some good reviews.I got there and I spoke to the lady waaay before she even spoke or acknowledged me. Then she says , u have call in ordah!?\" (Said with heavy accent) I said yes, she turned around and put my food on the counter and then gave me my total and proceeded to start talking to someone else working there, in their language obviously. I thought wtf? I got the food home. And its ok. That's it, it just ok. I ordered broccoli beef since my small humans like that, and they said the meat was gross, I tasted it and it had the most bizzare, gummy, yet rubbery, and almost mushy at the same time texture. I can't get over the texture to even decide what it tastes like.The chow mein is okay. I mean chow mein to Chinese food is like water is to a lake. How do u mess up a staple? The flavor was blan, the noodles were semi mushy. Ugh! The sweet n sour chicken was actually good though.My kids didn't even eat much of the food. In fact they asked me to make something.So much for me thinking I got it of cooking for the night!! \u00a0If you want cheap Chinese? U are probably better off going elsewhere.Lack luster food with a bitch for a cashier....the only thing giving this place the extra star is that the sweet n sour chicken was actually good. I will more than likely NOT be going here again. But I may give them a second chance...to impress me."], ["Rhane T.", "Three stars for food and fourth star for great service. We dined there around 2:00 pm which is always a slow period for restaurants. We were greeted by the host, seated quickly, ordered and got our food promptly. The presentation of the dishes was excellent. I had sweet and sour pork. While the sauce was good, the meat was overcooked and unidentifiable as pork, or anything else. The vegetables were fresh and tasty. Excellent chicken fried rice. My companion had the sesame chicken and remarked that it did not meet expectations."], ["Cory C.", "Dude, went there 7/13.

I loved their orange chicken. The dinner specials are very affordable."], ["Nicole I.", "As a long time customer of the ever changing Chef Bo, I was eager to see what changes the new management made to the menu, the decor, and the staff. Over the years, as soon as my family enters the doors, the order is being yelled back to the chef. I was confident that nothing substantial had changed on the menu as the general decor of the restaurant had not changed that much. The walls are repainted white and they took out the awkward bar area that was always a bit of an eye sore. To do so, however, they had to add more tiles and regrout the area which was not done in the most methodical manner. The new management also took out the old soda fountain and the shelf that ran along the backside of the restaurant that has opened up the space substantially. Changes: 1) Decor: Everything has a new clean white paint job. The bathrooms have been cleaned out and they added accent decor and potpourri which is a huge step up from its previous state. The dining area has a cleaner flow to it and the space is much more open. 2) Staff: The old staff has been changed out to a brand new staff that are still getting their sea legs. There was confusion over the menus, water, ordering, and the wait staff would wander out in the dining room, sit down in an empty table and text then remember that there were customers out there. 3) Menu: The menu has been drastically reduced. Before, the menu was roughly 4 pages but it has been cut down to 2. My favorite dish (of any Asian restaurant, period) has been taken off the menu. That was definitely difficult to hear as I was definitely prone to drive the 20 mins to Chef Bo just to get an order of teriyaki tofu over noodles. Also, the soda fountain has been removed and they are using cans of soda as an FYI because I would have stuck with the water if I had know I was paying for a can rather than a refillable soda. Review: I asked if they kept the tofu over noodles item but she said that everything comes over rice. So I opted for the sesame tofu over steamed rice and we split the veggie spring rolls. My husband got the veggie chow mein and my mom and her boyfriend split hot oil wontons, General Tao's chicken, and pork chow mein. The spring rolls and wontons came out really quickly and we did notice that they have switched the company that they get both the wontons and the spring rolls from. The spring rolls are a bit more substantive but the wonton portion size is significantly smaller. I got the tofu first, then after five minutes the pork chow mein came to the table and then five minutes later, the veggie chow mein arrived. We decided to just dig in while it was hot so everyone's dinner was staggered. The way they prepare the tofu is the same and the sesame sauce that they use doesn't really taste like sesame as it has a slight kick to it (but I didn't mind that). One huge problem with the dish was that it was soaked in sauce. The ample serving of rice that was underneath the tofu was completely saturated with the sauce so much so that I was only able to salvage 2 tablespoons of edible rice from the entire plate. My mom and her boyfriend both seemed to like their dishes but I did notice that the chow mein was completely scraped clean while the chicken was abandoned. My husband loved the chow mein and said that it was an improvement to the previous version of the dish. He was a huge fan of his dish but I am still upset that they 86d my favorite dish of all time. In terms of service, we walked in and were seated but then were never given menus and were just sitting at the table. Another waiter dropped off the menus and shortly thereafter dropped off chilled waters (which were heaven after today's 102 temp). They came around after a while and got our orders but she seemed a bit unsure of her menu and so the process took a bit longer than it normally would. I chalk it up to first week jitters but they need to be on top of it. We also had to ask multiple times to get hot peppers for the dish and my mom who was especially parched was left high and dry a couple times so she would siphon off some of our waters. This would normally be somewhat acceptable but we were one of two tables in the restaurant and the second table had just been seated while we were finishing our meal. We got the check and were pleasantly surprised to get a freshly cut orange and fortune cookies with the check- nice touch. It seriously pains me to cut down the previous review but until the new staff finds its bearing, I can't give them the rating that they had before. I will definitely be going there again and will do another review after that visit but for right now it's only a 3/5."], ["Staci V.", "Pretty good Chinese food! It's hard to find while living in my part of Sacramento. Sweet and sour chicken was great! The sauce comes on the side, not sure if that was due to picking up the order to prevent it going soggy, very true to taste! Sesame chicken is also very good. Dinner combos are $7.99 and come with your entree and choice of fried rice, steamed, or chow mein.

This is located on a tiny strip (with parking in the rear) right next to a 7-Eleven. When you walk in, you first notice the empty buffet counter. Maybe they used to be a pick-your-items type of place prior? Now it looks like the restaurant makes most of their business from to-go orders or through Eat24 as they constantly had orders ready to be picked up.Our order:Egg Flower Soup: ($4.95) eggs, sweet peas, mushroomsBeef Mu Shu: ($8.95) beef, cabbage, bamboo shoots, muyi, egg cooked with seafood sauce served with mu shu pancakes (aka: m\u00f9 x\u016b bng or b\u00e1o bng)Steam Rice: $1.50On the menu, the Egg Flower Soup only lists three ingredients but when we got the soup, there were quite a few other vegetables inside (i.e. zucchini, water chestnut). A fairly easy dish, it was egg-y and fit the bill for a simple soup.Hadn't had a mu shu dish in quite awhile and pretty much forgot what it was but when it came out out, I remembered (it's almost like ma po tofu).. but it was different than how I'm used to eating it. Typically, I'm used to eating mu shu over rice while some places serves it with noodles and/or soft tofu. Here, they serve it with mu shu pancakes which are white tortilla-like wrappers made of flour. They're very thin like crepes so you have to eat the wrap quickly or the wrap gets soggy in your hands. The dish was on the salty side though (and this is coming from someone who likes salty foods).Service was barely there and not very good. I heard multiple times an employee apologizing for something, where an item was incorrect or the wait was so long. When we placed our original order, after about 10min an employee tells us that they are out of the Temple House Marinated Oxtail. Wow.. It takes that long for you to realize that you don't have an item? Really?! In addition, since the employees were concentrating on all the to-go orders, it was difficult to flag someone down. They took awhile to re-fill our waters and for one of the dishes they brought out, they didn't give us a serving utensil. I had to get up and ask for a spoon (in which the employee looked at me funny for asking). Another bonus feature, there were TONS of flies flying around. They kept landing near our food or on it so when they did, we had to scrape off the top layer of food where the fly landed. Not my idea of a pleasant dining experience.

Noms.- Salt and Pepper Cod - salt and pepper anything pretty much, but especially the cod. My dad introduced this delectable dish to me, and I have since introduced it to my roomie (who normally doesn't like fish!) and some other friends who have all fallen in love. Seriously, the salt and pepper cod is amaze balls.Other things that I've tried that are good:- Beef Chow Fun - this is a pretty standard Chinese dish, and it's made pretty well here!

One in English and somewhat more tailored towards the \"American\" taste and another that is completely in Chinese and features some more of the exotic items (pork belly and chicken feet). It is a tiny place and usually fairly full but they give you free soup (always different each time you come in) and it is warm, simple and delicious with bran meat and veggies.

Banging dishes, yelling to the kitchen, and making more noise than I thought possible.The patrons were just as bad. Every possible bad table manner was present. Talking with mouths full of food, chewing with mouths open, eating with hands (on food that should be eaten with some sort of utensil) and I saw one guy, to my horror, reach inside his shorts to scratch his balls, and then continue eating as if it was no big deal at all.And lastly, one of the server/owner/manager personnel was wearing running attire.

The complimentary soup is freshly made everyday but they taste practically the same no matter if it's the carrot or the lotus based. Anyhow the authentic menu is decent with a variety to choose. Their cod fish and prawns are definitely worth a try! Bitter gourd stir fry beef is another signature dish to help relieve the stress of this blazing summer! Freshly prepped giant seashells are pricey but tender and tantalizing! Scramble egg with shrimp is another not to miss. Mix with some fresh made spicy oil, which you have to request, is just amazing. However, minus 1 star for charging for tea and rice. It's customary for 1 rice to be included in every main dish ordered.

It's just a nearby place to satisfy my Chinese food cravings without having to deal with the Americanized versions of certain dishes. Definitely stick to the authentic dishes instead of venturing into chow mein, orange chicken, etc. Those dishes tend to taste really cheap and you could literally go to Panda Express to get the same dish but more delicious and spend less money.

Rude!!!!But let me tell you what she said:Most of the food they cook has MSG, the soup she said they don't but all meat is marinated and they do use MSG in the meat they marinade. So whether you are allergic or just trying to limit your intake this may not be the place to you.AND, if their wait-staff is as rude as the lady who just hung up on me and you are a stickler for excellent customer service, this may not be the place for you.

The orange flavor just tasted really artificial and whatever amount that was in it was seriously overshadowed by the immense amount of soy sauce. The sweet and sour chicken was okay, but a bit too sweet and thick in my opinion. All of the food just seemed oversauced and really greasy and heavy.

I almost always order the pork ribs or the orange chicken, both are fantastic.

The woman who works the front (I'm bad with names...) always recognizes us. One time, I actually went to pick up food by myself after having not eaten there for around a month and she asked where my fianc\u00e9e was! I was surprised that she remembered me after how many people she likely sees every day.

Jenny asked if it was our first time and made small talk. Very nice lady.We recently returned because it was so good and Jenny remembered us and asked how our move was going. We were impressed of such a level of customer service. The food was also amazing once again. Oh and just FYI, we ordered 2 lunch combo plates with a side of potstickers both times. We tried the lemon chicken, sweet and sour pork, and sesame chicken. All were out of this world!!!Lunch combos come with a choice of entree, side of rice AND chow mein, and soup. All for less than 8 bucks.The egg flour soup was also very good because it was comforting and not spicy.Anyway, definitely a place to try... The only thing I want to throw out there cuz I keep things real, is that the location is not in the best neighborhood. Mack road is a bit sketchy on some parts, but do not let this deter you...

This is not the \"to die for\" dim sum restaurant, but this place definitely has some pros and is actually a smidgen better than the other places I've tried.I actually like the variety here over some of the other dim sum restaurants in the area. They actually served a variety of soups that is fitting for this cold, fall weather. I also liked that they served cold jellyfish, duck with crispy skin and plum sauce along with the usual faves.What makes this place better is the dishes were actually served warm and some fresh and hot from the kitchen. I don't know if it was the location of our table, but I was doing the \"it's hot! It's hot!\" dance with a full shu mai in my mouth. There's always the risk with dim sum of lukewarm dishes arriving to your table because of the cart service, but this was not the case for us!Servers were definitely on top of it here. Waters were refilled promptly and dishes were cleared in a timely manner. And everyone was actually really pleasant and friendly. The sizes of dumplings and dishes were also Connie-approved because I came in hungry and wanted to run home because I was so stuffed.The only downfallI I can think of is the pineapple custard bun was not baked thoroughly. The bun was a pale yellow color that I am not used to. Also, the dough was too doughy on the inside. Maybe it was just that batch, but we didn't eat it.This place was packed by 11:00am on a Saturday so I can tell this is one of the more popular dim sum restaurants.

But it also depends on what you order. I've probably been here over 20 times since they re-opened after their remodeling a few years ago and they have always been somewhat above average. Some of the better items to order - shrimp dumplings (ha gao), pork dumplings (siu mai), any rice noodle roll (shrimp, BBQ pork, or crispy donut with shrimp) (cheung fun), deep-fried shrimp ball, deep-fried pork dumpling (ham sui gok), pineapple buns with egg custard filling (bolo nai wong bao), Portuguese egg custard tarts (po taats), and deep fried green tea mochi with black sesame filling. There are many other dishes that are pretty good, but I couldn't list them all. Sometimes you have to see what looks best on the carts before selecting as not every item is best every time. Some less desirable items to order - fried taro puff (I've had better elsewhere), the regular egg custard tart (yuck! tastes artificial and bland, crust is not flaky at all), and fried salt and pepper calamari (it was WAY too salty last time).Their noodle dishes (on their regular menu) were pretty good as well. And importantly (at least to me), their tea tastes good! Some Chinese restaurants offer watered down, tasteless tea, but HK Islander has a decent selection and is fragrant and pleasant tasting. The restaurant is huge with plenty of seating (and a back room with even more seating), but sometimes on the weekends, there is a bit of a wait. There is not a lot of natural light in the restaurant as there are no windows, but they have plenty of beautiful artificial lights throughout the restaurant. They have plenty of TVs around the restaurant as well in case you want to watch that game on Sunday. Also, the service is not bad for a Chinese restaurant. Definitely one of the better dim sum restaurants in Sacramento. So if you are trying to decide between here and a place on Broadway or downtown, go here!"], ["Crystal C.", "This review is for dim sum only.

Another big hit was the bitter melon egg pancake. The bitter melon wasn't too bitter and the presentation was lovely. The pork neck was pretty good too, having a lot of flavor.

None of that small stuff. Servers are SUPER nice (especially if your Chinese). Maybe it's just from my personal experience but these servers actually tried to hold a conversation everytime they swing by. Too bad they are younger and more attractive, otherwise, i'd make one of them my dim sum girl ;) lol.

It was an honor that we will truly treasure and when my husband mentioned that he needed to help set up the reception, I was more than happy to help.Upon our arrival, I instantly saw another woman who was in a bridal cheongsam (the Chinese version of a wedding dress). At first, I thought she was part of the wedding and instantly thought she was doing the ultimate sin (this would be like wearing a wedding dress to another person's wedding). Apparently, none of the other people that were part of our friend's wedding realized it either until it was time for us to place the liquor bottles at the table. Turns out this group was ANOTHER wedding party IN THE SAME ROOM...and there was no partition that was placed to separate the two weddings. The thing that confuses me about this whole thing is that they have another banquet space...why didn't they just put the other party in that room?While this is horrible enough, this was only one part of the crazy....My husband had specific directions from the bride and groom on where things were needed to be set up and he had come with the groom the day prior to drop the decorations off. They had set up the boxes in a certain way so he would be able to find things easily. It turned out that the restaurant ended up moving all of the decorations around and caused major confusion. Once the bride and groom arrived, they received the shock/surprise of their life. As you can guess, they had no idea about this other wedding being held in the same room and were really upset. Immediately, the family worked with the manager/owner to get partitions up (which didn't do anything because they only had 3 sections of the cheap Chinese screens) and the staff looked extremely bothered by the request. It took multiple people asking for things to get done before they reluctantly helped.Once the reception started, things started to calm down. However, the restaurant owners decided to once again show how greedy they could be and opened their back room to the public and walked people right through the reception. As you can see, there are others who have also written reviews that are able to provide a little more detail than I can, so please read their reviews for their version of the day that was supposed to be as stress free as possible for the couple and their families. However, I can say that in all the weddings I have attended, this has NEVER happened before at any of the other venues I have been to.

The dining area wasn't very large or roomy, but was adequate and has a bar area with a big array of soft drinks and such on ice. The bathroom was nice, clean, and had shiny, colorful tile, but was being used as storage for a dust pan and tallish lockers (probably for the employees).The employees were all gracious and pretty friendly overall, but our server was chatting at length with a man (who was alone) that was sitting at a table behind us. Part of me was glad that she was taking the time to be friendly and nice, but another smaller part didn't like that the service wasn't as speedy as I anticipated because she was distracted.The prices are a little bit higher than under ten dollars (on average the more expensive dishes were a few dollars higher but not by much if you don't have to worry about money as much).There's a Jamba Juice right next door (which has outdoor seating), with a Togo's, Baskin Robbin's, and Chevron Station on the other side of the semi-busy road,"], ["Mike R.", "Ordered the Salt and Pepper Prawns, the Chicken Chow Mein, and the Pan Fried Noodles:The Salt and Pepper Prawns was arguably the best part of the order.

If any of the dishes really needed the salt, it was this one. Not to memorable really. Moving on.The Pan Fried Noodles was the second best thing. Crispy where it needed to be and plentiful. It had more flavor than the chow mein, but less than the prawns making this one probably the three most balanced and maybe even the healthiest of the three.Overall, I loved all of it.

I'm super picky with Chinese food too! My husband always orders the Szechuan beef and the chicken chow mien. The beef is always so flavorful, a little spicy not too much though.

It was my first time here and I got sushi rolls. I was disappointed with their sushi creations because it didn't taste authentic, it was bland, and the fish texture and taste lacked freshness. :( \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I wanted to like this place because of its huge menus though (both Chinese and Japanese) and because it had 4.5 stars on here. I should have gone somewhere else for my sushi but that's OK... it happens. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0So I got the veggie roll ($7) and the spicy yellowtail ($5). The veggie roll was basically veggie tempura in roll form but with lettuce inside of it... The fried veggies were soggy and the roll itself fell apart upon picking it up. If I was not hungry, I would not have had a second bite. I did not finish it, it just tasted bland and there was nothing special about it. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As for the yellowtail roll, there were simple ingredients yet there was so much to dislike. First of all, the texture was too chewy and made my breath smell like old fish. It tasted like a fart. Also it was not desirable in its presentation; plain and grey... Just not the freshness that's required of a sushi place...Neither roll held its own; they came apart.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The place DOES get a star or two because of the service; I was on my lunch hour and was served promptly! :) The server was charming and actually asked what perfume I was wearing and asked for a spritz! Very nice of her, so props to her, I left her a nice tip nonetheless. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0All in all, I might return in the future if I'm craving Chinese--the Chinese dishes I saw coming out looked pretty bomb even though I don't eat meat (other than fish).

Even though I was frustrated, he was calm and respectful the whole way through, and took the time to suggest some alternatives that I might like more in the future. Later that night Frankie took it upon himself to call me and apologize for the mix up, while offering my gf and I a free meal for the trouble.

I've tried the dragon roll, spicy volcano, and a third roll whose name I can't remember. All were great! My favorite was the spicy volcano (which wasn't very spicy but the taste was on point).

I ordered General Tso's chicken and this place probably has the best I've ever tasted in Sacramento.Pros: Authentic food, extensive menu, nice atmosphere, short wait times, always good hk shows on the tv, clean bathroom, nice music.Cons: somewhat pricey"], ["William L.", "I've actually remembered for this Land Park restaurant near Oto's Marketplace and Blue Moon Cafe several years ago. New Hong Kong Wok has all the HK and Chinese cuisines and entr\u00e9es available, so you can feel and experience the Southeastern China's dining right here at home. Last night on 9/3/2015, my parents, my sister, and her bf were planning to have an evening dinner here for family dining gatherings.As we entered, the atmosphere is closely average despite of the small compactly of tables. There are two or three TVs there showing Hong Kong drama programs all day and all night. Additionally, they have cooked and roasted ducks, pork, and chickens there, so you can take it or dine in there too without prepping on your own!The service is a hit-n-miss for me. The communications can be an issue for some because my parents are trying to ordered some Chinese food that they know the most. We did managed it successfully by speaking their foreign language (Cantonese; Chinese) including speaking in English too. I'm hoping they need to learn and make more approachable and communication improvements to the customers in the future.Now onto the entr\u00e9es! First up, is the Salt and Pepper Fried Prawns. So far, the shrimps are very good! The batter of the shrimp is very crispy and eatable as well as the seasoning too. A huge effort for this finest food!The Mustard greens (which it's looked like spinach in my opinion) tasted quite good. This entree is well balanced, and cooked perfectly as I ate it.The string beans with ground pork tasted OK for me. The downside: sodium intake of this entree despite it might be added a little bit of MSG. Hopefully, it needs to reduced the sodium and MSG to make it balance the flavor. Otherwise, it's a fine meal.The soup which it's made of pork or beef broth with beans, steamed, boiled pork, and carrots. So far, it also tasted OK.The stir-fry vegetables with fish is quite delicious. It tasted good, yet it also needs to reduce the salt and MSG too because it's closely salty for me including my parents too.Finally, the Beef Chow Fun, one of my sister's BF's favorite meal. So far, the chow fun tasted not that bad! The steak cooked excellent as well as the rest of the ingredients of this chow fun too! A superb entr\u00e9e!The parking can be a hassle to park, try to park at the strip mall where this place is. My best recommendations, park early before the dinner peek hours starts. Otherwise, you can ride a bike, walk, or use public transportation without the hassles.To conclude, New Hong Kong Wok is a good, average Chinese restaurant in the Land Park neighborhood. Perfect for friends and family gatherings, or simply having a late night meal of yourself! A well worthy visit! My rating: 3 solid stars."], ["Jo B.", "~ I got really sick from eating at this place because there was too much MSG on their food.~ Menu list is not organized and they deliberately leave prices. \u00a0The waitress kept checking with someone else with the price. \u00a0The list is not in alpha order.~Very pricey for a very, dirty building. \u00a0I have ordered a onchoy stir fried and it was $12.95. \u00a0~ Flies were in the restaurant. \u00a0I wouldn't want to go back here."], ["Jennifer N.", "Food: - Won Ton Noodle Soup: this is my favorite place to get wonton soup.

The shrimps were not crunchy at all. The flavor was good but the crunch is what makes or break the dish. 3/5- Peking Spareribs: pork spareribs marinated in a sweet Peking sauce.

We had to tell them to slow down, because the rest still haven't arrived yet. We ordered the set menu. Everything was good and flavorful. Out of everything, I would recommend the beef tenderloin with mixed mushrooms. The beef was indeed tender and I like mushrooms. For dessert, instead of fortune cookies, they served grass jelly with sugar syrup. It was refreshing.A caveat is that parking sucks! The parking is shared by several businesses including Jade Fountain Caf\u00e9 next door.

The food here is authentic not a typical american chinese food such as chow mein and etc. If you like americanize Chinese food your in the wrong place. I suggest next door Jade fountain.I recommend there emperor chicken which is a yellow skin and the chicken is very different than regular chicken dish. This chicken is like more chewy and has a different flavor which we call fresh and sweet chicken flavor in the asian culture. They also have wonderful dumplings or won ton egg noodles soup. The broth is very flavorful and strong as well. The dumplings are a good size and a good portion of noodles as well. I love the fried fish with eggs inside they have which has lots of eggs in the tummy of the fish. The flavors of the deep fry dish was in heaven with garlic bits and jalepeno as well. The texture of the dish was pure crispiness. The porridge is another one of my fav all time. I usually get the shreded pork with oysters which is so good. This place has a slow and bad service as well. \u00a0Basically you have to flag them and ask for stuff you need. I was observing others flagging them down for more napkins and boxes as well. This place is on the pricier side but it does feel authentic. What i mean by authentic is first the chicken is yellow skin which is different. In the asian culture we like the wok taste in our food meaning the food was cooked in a high to medium flame on the wok but isnt burnt or anything just cook to perfection. not every place can do this and this is one of the place we can taste it."], ["Tuan N.", "Was here with my family for lunch. I arrived a bit late but it was better for me since my sisters ordered for the entire table and I did not have to wait as long! My sister got some of the family together to have lunch and celebrate her daughter's birthday. At this location, they have a table that fits 20 people; however, we were not able to sit there even though we have 16! Reason was that they only give out that table if we had the full amount of people to seat the entire chair.. So instead, we were seated at two medium sized tables which was inconvenient because now we had to distribute the food evenly to allow everyone a chance to try all of the dishes that was ordered. If the restaurant was completely full, I would understand why they would not allow us to sit at the large table. But when there are plenty tables around, I don't see why being short by 4 people shouldn't be allowed to sit at the table for 20. We had a variety of plates coming to the table. Among the ones ordered, I liked the peking spareribs the most. The sauce was generous and soaked every piece of meat. My least favorite was the roasted duck... It came with steamed buns which I wrapped the duck with like a taco. I felt the duck lacked flavor even after I drizzled the meat with some of the juices. All of the other dishes were just okay. At one point, my sister tried to order more food but one of the server couldn't understand our orders. She ended up returning with another server who then took our order. It would be nice if they trained all staffs to understand the menu, but it was not too big of a deal. Parking here is the worse too! A lot of the neighbor stores have designated parking spots which gives you very limited space in front of this restaurant. Most times, you will be better off finding a spot out on the side of the streets."], ["Jenny S.", "In simplicity, the food from NHKW's massive menu is delicious and authentic, but service is lacking. To start off, parking is on a thin strip in front of the restaurant and since there are several businesses on the same shopping strip, parking can be limited. This restaurant isn't really all that great for groups of 6 or more. If you plan on coming with a large group, I suggest making a reservation. Be careful not to hit the person sitting behind you and watch out for dandruff flying in your direction (on 2 occasions, we sat next to someone who continually scratched their heads). In other words, the seating area is a bit small and tables are closely placed next to one another. Despite how busy it is, food seems to come out quickly. However, once the dishes are out, you may need to flag down the waiters for more water and napkins. I wish it was more consistent, but sadly, service is only excellent when I dine in with Chinese families. When I come with Mandarin speaking friends/family, the waiters are much more attentive and friendly! Again, the menu is massive so there is something for everyone. For the authenticity and great taste, prices are very reasonable. I have not had one bad dish from NHKW.

I guess she had ordered the family package, which included (sorry if I don't know the names) red bean soup (appetizer), cold yellow chicken, roasted duck, crispy noodles with veggies, seafood chow fun, BBQ spare ribs, salted fish fried rice, and others that I don't remember. It was A LOT of food! There was only 8 of us, and 2 of them were kids! I was full with just the soup and spare ribs! The food actually didn't taste bad. A other times I came here, the food tasted kinda old. But this time, it seemed fresher. I do recommend the crispy noodles with gravy and veggies. That kinda grew on me.I suggest you either make reservations or come super early, as it gets busy and full fast!!! The parking lot is a B**** to park in too! You most likely will need to park in the shady ass neighborhood. A few of the businesses next door have \"reserved\" spots for their clients. There are folding chairs that say, \"Reserved for this business.\" Dude, a foot massage place shouldn't even HAVE reserved spots! Who goes to a shady place like that to get a foot massage?! Whatevs.The service here is okay. Since they're always busy, they don't give you the kind of attention you would have hoped. Most, if not all, Asian restaurants I've been to, they're not as attentive to their customers anyways, so I just push that to the side unless the servers are going above and beyond to piss me off.This place can be a hit or miss for me.

I was told that this is the place to go for authentic, good Chinese food. Upon sitting down, there was hot tea waiting for us at the table. We ordered the roasted pork, roasted duck, and a tofu and eggplant dish that was prepared with sliced jalape\u00f1os. To make a long story short, the roasted pork was probably the best pork dish I've ever had. The crispy skin is so full of flavor, and gives such a nice crunch, words won't do it justice. If we're rating on food only, this place is as good as I've had. As good as the food is however, the service is lacking. For example, as the waitress came over to the table to take our order she interrupted us twice to turn around and yell something in her language at the workers in the kitchen. She didn't apologize or even acknowledge it at all, but that might have been because she didn't seem to speak English. Once the food was brought out, we were left to fend for ourselves too, and weren't checked on once. We also realized we didn't get a chance to order any drinks. The tables are all positioned very close to one another, which means you can overhear everyone else's conversations too. This is not a place you come to for service, or to host a group though. You come here for delicious, authentic, and surprisingly inexpensive Chinese food. \u00a0I give the food five stars, and the service one. This is the best Chinese food I've had in Sac, and I recommend to anyone as long as you're not high maintenance.

I've come here countless times and the food here is always on point. A few dishes I would highly recommend is the Empress Chicken. This chicken is very juicy and flavorful. The accompanying ginger onion oil dip is what makes this dish bomb! There's no other place that can make the chicken as good as HK Wok! The steamed shrimp with garlic oil is also a must-try! (There is a photo of the dish inside the menu, btw!) The shrimps are laid on a bed of thin and clear noodles with garlic infused oil mixed in. The combination of the noodles and garlic flavoring is O.M.G... to die for! Their claypot dishes are all a hit. One of my favorites has to be the bass fish claypot. Also, the oyster claypot (you'll have to check if they carry any oysters that day) is also a good dish I'm sure you'll enjoy as well. The clams with black bean sauce is best made here! My husband LOVES this dish. The clams are either hit or miss, sometimes they're super dinky...but the sauce is so good and worth drizzling over your rice! (Yes, I know I'm a fattie!) If you're thirsty, I'd recommend my all-time fave...red bean drink! There are chunks of red beans mixed in with some condensed milk (I think?) topped off with some ice. Very refreshing and good on a hot summer day! :) You can even order this as a dessert! The lemon ice tea is also pretty popular here. The service here is subpar, but hey... don't let that be the reason to stop you from coming here to try their food.

Well you would be mistaken. On Friday March 6th my friend and I had been in the area going to an event that we decided to leave early and grab some dinner. Since I had lived in the area year ago I suggested the New Hong Kong Wok because my wife and I use to order takeout for them. Once we got in we were treated like they didn't want our business. My friend and I were seated and it took the waiter over 20 minutes to take our order or even ask if we were ready to order and there were waiter available not attending to customer standing around the register area. We even put down our menus to make sure someone would know we were ready. The waiter that did come over was extremely rude he actually rolled his eyes several times when asked questions from me and my friend I even made a point to say please and thank you several time. Now once the order was taken we got our food rather promptly but that waiter never came back to check on us. During the delivery of our dishes only one of the servers actually even smiled and spoke to use in a normal manner. From what I can observe they didn't appear to be that busy at one point all the waiters were standing around the cash register talking, we finally had to flag down someone just to get our check and of course our waiter who was looking at us didn't even bring us our checks. As we left only the one female server even spoke to us and said goodbye like I said she was the only one that even acknowledged use politely. The shameful part of this whole experience was that the food was rather good but the dining experience was ludicrous. I have eaten at many Chinese, Thai, and Indian restaurant even some off the beaten path, so I'm accustom to dealing with different cultures just so that no one makes that excuse for the ridiculous way we were treated. I would not suggest anyone like me or my friend going into this restaurant until they get their act together. They made it quite apparent that my business was not needed and they won't get it in the future."], ["Mimi V.", "I recently came here for mother's day dinner around 6pm and surprisingly we got a table within 10-15 minutes of waiting for a party of 7. We ordered the mother's day special for 188.00 and it include about 8 dishes and feeds for a party of 10. I don't know why we decided to order that much food but boy did we have so much left overs! Remembering the savoring food from this restaurant, i couldn't wait until the dishes came out. The first dish came out and it was a mixture of duck, hai nan chicken, and bbq pork. That dish did not please me as it tasted mediocre and lost it's delectable taste. The second dish came out and it was the lobster with thin clear noodles. I am used to eating lobster with the chow mein noodles, so i was thrown off a little by the mixture. The lobster was not that great with no meat, and the clear noodle was salty. I did not enjoy this dish. \u00a0When i saw the walnut shrimp dish i thought to myself, \"now they can't mess up on this dish\". Well, turns out that it wasn't so great as well and tasted mediocre.There were a bunch of other dishes that were included in the mothers day special that i did not mention, but to sum it up, i think this place has lost it's touch. OR, we came on the wrong day because they got really busy by 6:30pm. I was not pleased with dinner and honestly i didnt care if i got to take home the left overs (Usually i would hop on the left overs).

They will ignore you, until you have to flag them down to order, I've been to this place over 100 times, 99 times is the same. \u00a0Only the female waitresses do any work in this place.2. If you order a soft drink or any drink, expect it to arrive AFTER you start eating your dinner, sometimes you have to let them know you haven't gotten your drink because they are too busy with each other.3. 10 out 10 times, they will ask you if you want steamed rice with your order, which 10 out 10 times we need rice to compliment our dishes. They will mark down how many people they will charge for the steamed rice, but once the dishes start arriving, they will just walk away, go back to their TV conversation, walk around looking busy, talk to their regular customers. You will have to flag a waiter down for rice, its like ordering spaghetti and then only give you sauce, ordering a hotdog and they don't give you buns. \u00a0I've been to this place over 100 times, with family, with friends, and its the same thing everytime. NO ASIAN person in this restaurant ever eat their dishes without rice, its the attention to details that's important, too bad they lack that detail.4.Pictures and artwork, its just an eye sore that nothing in the restaurant that's hanging is straight. Every picture or artwork is either slanted or crooked. C'mon, if you gonna put a nail on the wall, pull up a chair to hang the picture or wine rack, don't just throw it on the wall for the sake of throwing it on the wall, look at it, give it some love and effort.So, why do we keep coming back? Its authentic Hong Kong style cooking that's why. \u00a0Their roast duck is flavorful, Hong Kong style seasoning without a lot of 5 spices to hide its flavor. \u00a0The Hong Kong pan fried noodle, with the small egg noodle, is perfectly crispy, and a true authentic Hong Kong Chef uses a white gravy, not a dark oyster sauce flavored gravy. \u00a0You can't go wrong with their crispy salt/pepper tofu, nor their large pea sprouts saut\u00e9ed with garlic. Try the dried scallop fried rice with egg whites, perfectly seasoned. \u00a0The black bean sauce clams is a hit and miss, sometimes its fresh, sometimes it taste like shoes. If you are looking for sweet and sour pork, General Tao's chicken, or Mu Shu Pork, well they are good at cooking Authentic Hong Kong meals, not dishes invented in America.Things they can work on.How about service? C'mon guys, its the same thing every time.Specials- No doubt someone went to great length to come up with specials, spent money on the ingredients, and they even write it down on paper and plastered it all over the restaurant. So with all that effort to make a little more money and to distinguish themselves from their competitions, why not also write it in English? How hard is it to put another 2 minutes and translate the Chinese writing into English? Just because you are Asian doesn't mean you can read Chinese, open your market to a bigger audience and you will make more money."], ["Ray A.", "customer serivce. SUCKS. Thats right. 1 star why?

Best I've EVER had anywhere - bar none.Photo here:yelp.com/biz_photos/new-\u20262) Stir Fried Chicken and Mushrooms: \u00a0A fairly straightforward dish usually, but yep, the aroma again was just delectaable. \u00a0They had a variety of mushrooms, incl. enoki. \u00a0Good stuff.3) Fried Squab - Excellent, Very Fresh, and didn't taste gamey like some renditions. \u00a0Each piece was pretty darn meaty too, which I found unusual for Chinese Fried Squab.4) Hong Kong Style Chow Mein w/Chicken - Good stuff. And.. gee.. most dishes were in the $8-9 range. \u00a0A fantastic value, IMHO.Our entire family thought this place was just plain excellent. \u00a0They obviously saved their money on their exterior to provide a high quality meal for their patrons. \u00a0OK, well, that's how I look at it! =)Here's a pic of their rather unassuming awning outside.yelp.com/biz_photos/new-\u2026This just goes to show not to judge a book by it's cover - or a fantastic restaurant in this case!"], ["Food C.", "Worst service hands down.

The preference was for Chinese and some place not too out of the way from Hwy 50. Yelp directed us to Hoicin Cantonese Restaurant (phonetically sounded like seafood but not to be confused with hoisin sauce). We were surprised it was not your typical Chinese restaurant with bright lights, loud, uncomfortable chairs and filthy bathrooms. It was pretty mellow. clean, had soft music, pleasantly muted lightings with padded comfy chairs. The restaurant wasn't very crowded with just enough patrons for two servers to handle. They were welcoming and friendly and bilingual speaking both English and Cantonese.We were given menus and I can see at least one similarity with all other Chinese restaurants.... an extensive menu that made decisions difficult. I saved some time \u00a0and ordered for everyone \"family\" style. There were no BBQs (roast duck, BBQ pork etc) or soya sauce chicken hanging behind the counter. The seafood tanks against the back wall were not a pretty sight.... some half dead lobsters and crabs and a couple of motionless seabass. Oh well.... it might be best to skip seafood!We all love garlic pea leaf ($10.99), a bright green leafy veggie lightly stir-fried in oil and garlic. There was a heaping mound on the plate. The leaves had unique tendrils that curled and twined like mini-grapevines. They were not too garlicky.... just enough garlic to enhance the taste w/o overwhelming it. Some of the leaves were however wilted and was texturally soft. This was a bummer as fresh pea leaf should be crunchy to the bite.Mapo Tofu ($8.75) is a Szechuan original and can be addictive when done right. This dish was simple enough.... cubes of soft tofu with shredded pork sauteed in red chili oil and black bean sauce. One person in our party was visiting from Singapore (they love spicy food there) and unbeknownst to me, she had requested this dish to be made extra spicy. Let me say this.... the first giveaway clue was the reddish sauce. This was not for the faint hearted. It was lip-smackingly spicy and downright incendiary. My lips were swollen like they were bee stung but I survived and still agreed it was good in between gulps of ice water!Anyone care for sea cucumbers? For the uninformed, a sea cucumber is a grotesque looking marine animal that looks like a cucumber and hence the name. It has a weird slimy texture and is a delicacy amongst the Chinese and Japanese. The dish? It was unceremoniously called Sea Cucumber Casserole with ginger, scallion and fried tofu in a light soy oyster sauce. Sea cucumber like tofu does not have its own distinctive taste and acquires the taste of whatever broth or sauce it is cooked in. At $15.25, it was understandable that Hoicin were skimping on the sea cucumbers, as they are not cheap. The dish tasted just a tad better than mediocre and the sea cucumber's quality was also middle of the road.Peking Pork Chop ($9.99) was the clear winner. The meat was lightly deep-fried and marinated with their homemade sweet and sour red sauce. The tender and juicy meat coupled with the sweet, tart and smoky sauce made this a messy finger licking good dish.Overall, it was a satisfying dinner but by no means gourmet. It remains very mediocre by Bay Area standards but it deserved a well earned 4 stars in the Sacramento area and may possibly be the best Chinese food I have in Sacramento so far."], ["Jae H.", "MY PRAYERS ARE ANSWERED!When we moved to Rancho from SoCal, we desperately tried to find chinese food that was: tasty, affordable, and close.

We also ordered honey walnut prawns and they were ver over battered, almost couldn't even taste the shrimp. We then got the check and the soup was of course on it. We were not happy about that, we didn't even touch it. The lady who took our check was also no help, we explained we didn't even eat the soup and sent it back right away.

I have only enjoyed their take out options, therefore I can not speak about the dine in experience. Regarding takeout the Food is prepared fairly fast and always taste fresh.

First off, I did a pick up order and the lady was rude not only to me but to the customers who waited after us to place an order, typical of asian restaurants. The bbq pork fried rice was good and standard, the beef and broccoli was also good, but broccoli was way over cooked and mushy, the hot and sour soup was a little spicy and didn't seem to have any pork or chicken like I'm used to from other restaurants, but flavor was good still, and lastly the wor won ton soup was aweful, the BBQ pork in it tasted like it had been dry and frozen then rehydrated in the broth and the shrimp and chicken tasted very mushy and slimy, wonton themselves were not very impressive, but broth was standard. The two stars were for the good fried rice and the quick 10 minute it took to prepare all my orders."], ["Andrew G.", "Jane and her team prepared fried rice, chow fun, and some vegetable dishes for our small wedding party.

But the food was delicious and even my son loved the hot and sour soup. The second time we ordered take out even though the whole place was empty. I just wanted to watch tv and eat delicious food. We got the egg flower soup and it was yummy too but the hot and sour is better. Chicken chow me in for my son was good. General chicken for me was a mistake to order.

I've gotten take out from here several times and the food is always hot and flavorful. I've tried the basics--chow mein, sweet and sour pork, fried wontons, mongolian beef, orange chicken, and wanton soup--and have never been disappointed. (Their wantop soup is really good!) Everything is always fresh and delicious! I can even eat this Chinese food cold the next day which is a testimony in itself. Usually Chinese food is tough and sitting in congealed sauce after 24 hours! The prices are reasonable too (around $8 for an entree) and they often have coupons for \"family meals.\" I can't believe people are giving this place bad reviews because they won't deliver to their apartment??

Yes, I said brown rice even though I ordered fried rice. \u00a0Then after digging through it, it was actually their version of fried rice as there was little bits of scramble eggs and the rice probably turned brown from the soy sauce. I was expecting the normal fried rice of tiny pieces of BBQ pork, green onions, and chopped up carrots and green peas.The mixed veggies consist of zucchini, snow peas, broccoli, carrots, celery, mushrooms and water chestnut. \u00a0The dish was pretty good but the sauce was a little too sweet for me.I was definitely stuffed as the portion was big and with all the complementary appetizers, and soup Service is definitely really fast and staff is very friendly. \u00a0I can tell they get a lot of regulars as they greeted customers by their names which is good, especially from a Chinese restaurant.

My co-workers can't stop raving about how great this place is.... Howecer, I honesty think it's only great because of 1. Location 2. Huge portions 3. Affordable lunch combos. Definitely not because of the quality of the food. This is too much catered to the American palette. You can tell by the amount of entrees they serve fried!

It was definitely sufficient to blunt my lunchtime hunger. I can't review the potstickers, since they never brought them! They did, however remove them from the bill, so whatevs. This sort of highlights the chaotic but friendly service you can expect here...I got a chance to try the fried wontons, which were surprisingly tasty. Not normally my cup of tea, but they were not bad at all. The orange chicken I was able to try was excellent. It was easily, hands-down the best orange chicken I have ever eaten. I don't normally order this either, since it's generally a corn-syrupy, goopy, bready mess when served at places like Panda Express, or many other Chinese restaurants. This version is lightly fried and has a distinctly authentic orange taste. If you order it, you will not be disappointed.Definitely a legitimate lunch option!"], ["SC T.", "I love this place.

I usually order two things and they give a complementary soup of the day if you eat in. It's a nice little bonus. Service here is generally pretty good too.

Well, T Kee would be a great choice for authentic Chinese cuisine in Sacramento.First things first, when you arrive at T Kee, the parking lot is full during eating hours. That's a good sign. Secondly, when you go in you see a lot of Asians. And that's a really good sign. That's because you know that you'll find the 'real stuff' when you come here.I came with a medium sized party of people. We ordered family style where we each chose a dish and shared it among ourselves. The variety at T Kee is very good, but one dish I was craving was not on the menu... the fried chicken with shrimp chips... ahhh man... wish that were there!Even though I didn't get that dish, there were some really delicious entrees for us. We had snow peas and shrimp, Hong Kong style ribs, a veggie/tofu/mushroom dish, and noodles. A friend of ours recommended the more expensive eel fried rice. It took 30-minutes to prepare but was definitely a highlight of our meal. Be careful when ordering this dish though, you may not like it if you are squirmy about wiggly looking things.We also got the house soup and dessert. These items came with the meal and were a nice bookend for the dinner.Service was pretty good, though can be spotty or slower at times.Overall T Kee is one of the better Chinese places that I've eaten at in Sacramento. I would suggest giving it a try!"], ["J L.", "Quality is inconsistent. Don't Don't Don't order the clay pot eel rice. There was no sweet soy sauce come with the rice. The rice was so oily. You could barely find any eel in the rice, but it cost $36 a pot.

I know it is tap water but it should not have a smell to it and a noticeable after taste like sewer water. \u00a0Thank goodness I had a water bottle in the car. \u00a0Everything was so bland, lacked flavor and ingredients did not taste fresh or maybe its the water???. \u00a0I am used to some jalapenos in the clams that should be in a nice rich dark sauce but it did not. \u00a0I love beef green bean and this one was so bad, that I couldn't eat it. \u00a0 \u00a0It should cook to a nice bright green with a smooth shell but it looked greyish meaning the beans were old, dry and shriveled prior to cooking. \u00a0The only saving grace was the chow fun. \u00a0That was really the only decent item. So it ended with the most expensive tab we have EVER paid at a Chinese restaurant for 9 adults, 2 teenagers, and 4 children under 8 was $269 because they added 15% gratuity for our large party. \u00a0Nonetheless it came to $234 prior to that. \u00a0We usually spend about $180-200 with tip anywhere else. \u00a0They charged $9 for a very small pot rice. \u00a0I gave two stars as it had a little better service than most and they packed up the to-go plates for us.

I vaguely remembered someone told me to try Oriental Restaurant some time ago but I never built up the interest to do so. Apparently it is now called T-Kee. Hmmm... With few friends recommendations I thought it is as good as anytime to give it a shot. The Establishment: Seems clean and organized. Staffs appears to be not hating their jobs which is always a plus sign.The Service: We had a cake with us for a birthday celebration. Upon seated I placed it on the table. One of the waiter saw it and immediately offered to put it in the fridge for us. Nicely done with the attentiveness. :) At the end of the meal he brought it out, unboxed, with a candle, and small paper plates ready to serve. Double like! Let's say I tipped well for his attention to details. The Food: Over all the food was great! Although the food was not WOWing but it was a pleasant meal. We ordered the Egg Plant and Sea Bass Clay Pot, Garlic Giant Bean Sprouts, Pork with Green Beans, BBQed Pork Belly, Steak with Chives, Hand Shredded Chicken Salad, and Yellow Eel Rice Clay Pot. According to the big giant banner on the out side of the building, they make the Eel Rice Pot \"THE AUTHENTIC\" way. Here are the results: Egg Plant / Sea Bass Clay Pot -- WIN, Better than New Hong Kong WokGarlic Giant Bean Sprouts -- MEH, decent but doesn't WOWPro with Green Beans -- MEH, decent but doesn't WOWBBQed Pork Belly -- LOSS, too dry and no flavor. New Hong Kong Wok does it better. Steak with Chives -- WIN, fresh and great flavor. Steak strips were tender. Hand Shredded Chicken Salad -- BIG WIN, better than any placed I tried for the same dish. Perfect salt level and chicken was tender. Eel Rice Clay Pot -- LOSS, The key to Rice Clay Pot is the burned layer. There were virtually non of the burnt rice chunks. The soy sauce was bland and colorless. CF Cheng's Rice Clay Pot can have this one for lunch. It is a decent restaurant with some good dishes.

The dishes were good, but I can't determine if they are better compared to other Chinese restaurants. If you're a vegetarian, there may not be a lot of options. My brother ordered the mapo tofu. I suggested that because I recently had it elsewhere and enjoyed it. Their version however was subpar. The sauce was a glutinous. The place is a-okay overall.

See post. \u00a0Looks like someone puked in the sink but no one ever bother to clean it."], ["Conlan K.", "Went and ordered the GIANT Shrimps they had there. \u00a0So sweet and very meaty. \u00a0Had to try it once because they are always sold out. \u00a0I would recommend trying it once."], ["Batzmaru B.", "MANAGER TRYING TO RIP CUSTOMER OFF BY GOUGING THE PRICE -- BE WARE DON'T BOTHER EATING HERE. \u00a0THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER RESTAURANTS IN SACRAMENTO JUST AS GOOD!The food is okay, they only have 2-3 dishes that are good, but not worth the gouging prices. \u00a0My large family are from out of town, we have lots of relatives in Sacramento and the last time we've eaten at T Kee was in September. \u00a0We had a reservation for four tables and ordered off the menu.On our recent visit in May, we wanted to host dinner for about 50 people. \u00a0We tried to make a reservation over the phone in advance for five tables, but were told we need to come in person to pay up front which was fine with us. \u00a0When we got there, we were told that we were not allowed to order off the menu, that we have to order their set menu which was $268.00 per table. \u00a0First of all, the food we want to eat is the not on their set menu and we've ordered off the menu in the past. \u00a0We had a copy of the menu from our last visit and were planning to order 12 dishes per table. \u00a0The manager took our list with the 12 dishes that was off the menu to calculate the amount; because it didn't come out to his gouging price of $268.00 per table, he couldn't accommodate us. \u00a0He came back to us saying we can't order off the menu and that the set menu was the best price we can find in Sacramento. \u00a0Really, then why were we able to find another restaurant with better price and food?The manager then told us if we insist on ordering off the menu, we would only be allowed two tables and we would have to wait like everyone else without a reservation. \u00a0 Our response, We don't need to eat here! \u00a0Apparently this manager didn't have any common business sense, he rather give up serving guaranteed 50 people and take his bet to see if he gets another 50 customers for the rest of the day. \u00a0STUPIDITY ON HIS PART!We told all our 50 relatives what happened, they will be boycotting this restaurant too and passing the words of their poor customer services. \u00a0WE DEFINITELY WILL NOT BE COMING BACK HERE.p.s. to all the viewers out there as I was reading others comments about this restaurant tacking on 15% Gratuity. \u00a0There is a new IRS gratuity law (throughout the US) that went into effect January 2014 stating restaurant cannot automatically tack on gratuity. \u00a0If they do, you can report them.kielichlawfirm.com/2014-\u2026wave3.com/story/24352173\u2026laist.com/2013/12/26/new\u2026"], ["S B.", "Awesome food restaurant. Food pretty fresh.Best signature dish that you should order and try which is NOT on their menu is:1) Boneless chicken (except the two wings with bones on the plate) salad (You can order half or a full chicken)2) Sizzling Seafood Tofu (Japanese Style) 3) Peking duck4) Lettuce wrap with duck meat (they do not usually have this for order, only when you order a duck and separate into two dishes[3) + 4) then they will cook it like this style for you. Otherwise, their normal lettuce wrap's meat choices are: chicken, pork ~ the common ones]5) their porridge is pretty good here - give you descent amount of meat compare to other Chinese restaurants. In addition, the porridge is not starchy (as other Chinese restaurant sometimes add corn starch or flour to make the porridge look thick and look like they use a lot of rice but they are not)6) their hot pot rice is very good here also - the best we have tried and our favorite one is: the ell one with Chinese sausage (one of their new menu items)You can try for yourself. To me, this restaurant has certain level of quality it's representing."], ["Kiana L.", "Great services! when we went there at noon on Sunday, 2/3 the place was full. \u00a0We ordered the 1/2 emperor chicken, 1/2 peking duck, braised beef stew in clear broth, baby oysters egg pancake, steamed pork rib with xxx sauce, pork intestine with preserved vegetable. \u00a0I really love the chicken especially the sauce, love the peking duck, the skin was very crispy, and bun was not too sweet, love the beef stew in clear broth! will cone back to try more."], ["mae gee w.", "Last time I was here the place didn't seem as nice, but it looks like they fixed the place up. Service was good last night. The chicken was excellent, the duck was good as well. Salt n pepper shrimp was good flavor, but strange the heads were removed... As a whole the place has good food, but in a location you could drive past fast without knowing it."], ["Alex S.", "I am a fan, my partner too. Going to T Kee almost every weekend, never been dissatisfied or disappointed! Yummy food and very nice staff and service. Thanks T Kee! 5 stars"], ["Miguel C.", "The best Chinese restaurant I've ever been too and I spent 30 years living in Bay Area with Chinese places in every other block. Always coming back, trying new dishes, 5 stars, no questions! The only thing it's not only seafood as the name says. All kind of meats, deserts and so forth! Thanks T Kee"], ["Vinkin Ken T.", "I got really confused with the name of this restaurant. My mom came here before and brought a menu home. The menu said it was called The Oriental Restaurant. I searched yelp and couldn't find it. I searched the address on yelp and it brought T Kee Seafood Restaurant. I get there and their restaurant window says T Kee Seafood, but the waiters were wearing black tshirts with the name \"The Orient.\" Whatever it is called, the food was delicious! If you like fried rice, order the clay pot rice. But be warned, it takes a minimum of 30mins, it took 45mins for us. They said you can call ahead to order when you come in to dine. Or, if you're waiting in line, which at the time we went on a Saturday at 7pm, there was but we didn't have to wait long for a table, you can order while waiting for a table. The restaurant was completely full. Their parking lot is small, so get here early. Minus 1 star because of the wait and slow service, but everything we ordered was good. Large portions and we had left overs."], ["Harrybobo L.", "First visit since the name change and the restaurant has expanded with one side accommodating parties of six or more and the other with four or less. The service is virtually the same at all Chinese restaurants; you have to flag them down if you ant drinks, rice etc... We ordered fried oysters , always a favorites, \u00a0Cod and shrimp sizzling platter , House special tofu sizzling \u00a0platter with lots of fried and steamed tofu, shrimp and beans?, and the always good pork patty and salted fish rice or Fan Ju. \u00a0Great dishes but very crowded with all Chinese on Xmas night."], ["Yixuan Z.", "Very good and authentic Cantonese food. Milk tea, sea food, goose intestine and clay pot dishes are must tries."], ["Parlor T.", "What a surprise. Food was excellent and service was great. Love their scallop fried rice. This place definitely feels authentic but without the dirty chinese restaurant feel. Would definitely come back here again."], ["Robbie G.", "I haven't actually eaten at the restaurant, so I can't give an opinion on the food. However, the simple fact is that they own the only bathroom in that part of the strip mall where they lie; they allow other businesses to use it (like the comic shop), but they're the ones responsible for maintaining it. For four weeks in a row (FOUR WEEKS IN A ROW), their bathroom has been out of soap in the pump, and it's been only marginally clean. That raises serious questions about the cleanliness of the place and how the hell the employees are washing their hands."], ["Kenji L.", "Favorite place in Sacramento to get authentic Chinese food. If you are confused, this place used to be called Orient Restaurant but they changed the name when they switched owners a couple months ago. Some of the house specialities here are the rice casseroles. But if you want one of those call in early because they generally take 30 minutes to cook because they cook it from raw, uncooked rice. My personal favorite is the salty fish and pork patty rice casserole. I also like the steamed chicken with a ginger and scallion sauce and is served with a side of peanuts. This place in my opinion is one of the best places in Sacramento to get that chicken. Service here is standard for any Chinese restaurant you visit and parking is in a small private lot. If you're lost trying to find this place, its around the corner from the Fish and Chips place off of Freeport."], ["Matt C.", "Wow. If it weren't for the decency of the food itself, this place would get no stars. The service was dismal from the start. We were seated quickly but then were promptly ignored by the waiters for over 20 minutes. \u00a0It wasn't even busy, too - plenty of open tables and not that many people. Finally had to stand up and flag down a waiter to take our order. Also asked for water. 10 minutes later, still no water. We watched as parties that came in later were served and got their food before ours. Finally had to stand up again just to wave him over to remind him to bring us water. When the food finally came, our mood lifted.. but they seemed to have forgotten our rice as our dishes began arriving. Finally asked them after 10 minutes where our rice was, and we were told that they had run out of rice and it was cooking. Hmm, thanks for the update - if we hadn't have asked would you even have told us? Waited forever before we finally got our rice, and by then all the dishes were cold. Then they charged us for the rice anyways, awesome.In sum: the food is above average, but the service is horrible. If you have lots of free time and don't mind being snubbed, then this place is fine."], ["Vanessa C.", "The food here is ok. Its like the typical Chinese restaurant including the mediocre service. But, i must say ive been around Chinese food my entire life so i guess my opinion is biased lol! I probably wouldnt be back unless my family wanted to come"], ["Miss H.", "Good food, good sized menu with all kinds of different dishes, good service, decently priced. I come here often and everyone has always been nice and helpful."]]}
