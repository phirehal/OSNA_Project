{"Kyoto Sushi Bar Grill & Ramen": [["Paige S.", "Came here last night on a whim after tacos... because what better dessert than sushi? I've been here before (sometime last summer) and it was fine, nothing special, but was good and the fish was tasty.This time, I came in with my neighbor. We had uni nigiri while waiting for our hamachi and salmon don. Why get $5 nigiri with only two pieces when you can get a $15 don with NINE pieces!? And full of sushi rice!? This is my new favorite thing. Best Monday idea yet."], ["Anne W.", "The one star is because they have happy hour prices on a Saturday afternoon.This place looked really promising but I was extremely disappointed. I went in on a Saturday afternoon with a group of 6 classmates (7 in total) and we were seated and given menus and water. There were only two other tables there at the time. We had a few people in the group who don't eat sushi often and naturally had a few questions. The waiter answered the questions and left. When we were ready to order, I signaled to him that we were ready. I signaled 4 times. Each time, he looked at me and didn't come over. He was too busy chatting with a table (the customers were Chinese and so was the waiter). They were having a good ol' time chatting it away in Chinese and our table was trying to order. Well my classmate finally spoke up and said we are ready to order after he ignored me. He said ok and instead of coming over, he walked back to the table of Chinese customers to chat again. At this point, my classmates had enough and decided to leave since we were on a time crunch. A few of them walked out and I was ready to too when he walked over and said he was ready to take our order. I said to him in Chinese that we were ready to order a long time ago and we were on a time crunch. He looked extremely embarrassed after realizing I spoke Chinese and apologized to me in Chinese. However, he continued to be really rude to my classmates. His reasoning for not coming back to take our order? \"You still had questions so you weren't ready to order. When you don't have questions anymore, I know you will order\" but isn't that his job to answer any questions we had about the menu?! This was a ridiculous answer. We ended up ordering anyways and a classmate got sick from the food. The place doesn't look bad on the outside but beware of the horrible customer service. I'm still debating on whether or not he did that to us because we were a mixed group."], ["Jeanette L.", "Actually if I could, I would give this place NEGATIVE stars for the service, quality of the food, and for the pain my friend and I suffered immediately after the consumption of the food. We both threw up all the contents of the meal within 10 minutes of finishing. We used \"Requested\" for lunch at Kyoto on Thursday 11/5. For those who are not familiar with Requested, it is a reservation booking app with discounts available during certain hours of the day, and it's currently available to use in Sacramento restaurants. Because there was no discount offered during the time we made the reservation, we thought that we could order any item on the menu, including the happy hour menu (for example, if there is like a 10% discount at the time you make a reservation, you're not allowed to order from any further discounted menu/happy hour menu). We even asked our waitress/possibly owner to confirm if it was ok to order from the happy hour menu and she said yes and allowed us to move forward with our order. For 2 people, we ordered the items off of the happy hour menu: 2 tonkotsu ramens, 1 quail egg wrapped in pork yakitori, and 1 OMG sushi roll.My complaints-The meat in the ramen was possibly tainted-Pork was burnt & I don't think they cook the yakitori skewers over charcoal (not legit)-Egg in ramen and quail egg were overcooked and dry-The raw fish in the sushi was warm with a goopy brown sauce on the bottomBecause I didn't want to cause a scene and the items were off the happy hour menu, I didn't have any of the food sent back. I expected to only pay $22 plus tip for the happy hour items, but was chased down by the waitress on our way out. Apparently she went back on her word and told us that if I wanted to pay through the app, I had to pay for the \"happy hour items\" with the regular price. Redic! I would not eat at this restaurant if I had to pay for these mediocre food for the regular price. She said if I paid using the app, she will give me a 10% discount off the total of the food based off the regular prices. After seeing my receipt, I don't think she actually gave me the \"10% discount\". I ended up paying $40 for food that exited our bodies immediately after consumption. Thank you for allowing me to pay you to cook me bad food only to barf it out. Food poisoning is so fun!Negative starsWill never come backWhere's my refund?"], ["Ladonna A.", "This place was ok. Their sushi didn't taste fresh to me. The price was normal 8-10$ for a roll. The thing that caught us by surprise was their \"special roll\" which was $8. When I say special it means it was a special request. My friend has a son who doesn't have a palate yet but loves the sushi roll with tempura flakes on top and nothing in the center. Basically just rice seaweed and tempura flakes. She ordered two and it came to $16. My rolls came cheaper and it actually had tuna in it.Nonetheless you get a good waitress and a clean place."], ["Cha R.", "Came here with friends before a night on the town. I had ordered a Spicy Double Salmon roll (called a \"double\" because it had salmon on the inside and outside of the roll) and my husband had the Sushi Combo A. I had asked how spicy my roll was and if they could tone down the spice \u00a0for me. \"No problem\" said the waiter. When my roll arrived it looked very nice but was as spicy as h*ll!!! I swear they stuffed sriracha in every nook and cranny of that roll...much too strong for my liking. I ended up only eating 1.5 pieces and had to order a Boxer roll instead. My husband's sushi A combo came with 5 pieces of salmon sashimi and 2 of the 5 pieces still had pieces of fish bone in it. One of our friends (a regular at Kyoto who spends $50+ by himself on their sushi) asked if jalape\u00f1os could be added to his roll and was charged a dollar extra for thin slivers that he couldn't even taste. Not a bad place if you're in a pinch but I'll stick to my regular sushi spot...Sushi Q."], ["Julia D.", "I needed a sushi roll and I ordered the creamy maguro roll to-go and it was fresh and delicious and just overall amazing. I really like all the pictures they have on the wall in the waiting area- makes it feel like a cozy, friendly business. Hopefully I'll eat there again soon."], ["Valerie K.", "Came here before, but I never reviewed! Anyways, food is reasonably priced here. Sushi averages $8-10 with generous portion sizes. Friendly staff. Our waiter wasn't the most friendly, but the owner took photos with his instant-photo camera to post of the group. Only complaint was that the food took a while and the waitress simply said it was because we got there late and ordered later...but even so we were waiting around a while since ordering. My friend got a really nice birthday dessert, which was fabulous. :) Would come back."], ["Micki M.", "Omakase please! We asked the chef make us a small platter of his choice of nigiri and sashimi. Our request was that he omit Saba (mackerel) and Sake (salmon). It was a work of art! Chef Brian included my favorite Ankimo (monkfish liver) and mom's favorite Uni (sea urchin). The platter had a variety of fresh and delicious slices of melt in your mouth fish. It was quite impressive! I'll admit that my photo didn't display everything on the plate. Plus, the Omakase dish was delivered right on cue. No waiting around for minutes on end, waiting impatiently. Fast, precise, artistic hands that the sushi chef has here! Along with the omakase, we ordered:*Gyoza-delicious*Oysters (Kuma or Miyagi?) on the half shell -Delish*Kaki Fry (fried oysters) although small, compared to other places, it was quite tasty!*Tempura -satisfactory*OMG ROLL-fantasticCute location, great service by our friendly male server, sorry, I didn't catch his name! He was pretty awesome, for being so young. With everything we ordered, we paid a little bit over a $100, we would've paid a lot more at other places! This was a great place to take my mom for Mother's Day!"], ["Jessie K.", "Being right around the corner from my work, this is my go to lunch spot when I feel the need for sushi (which is often). I've had a number of their rolls and appetizers so far, all of which have been good quality and fresh tasting. The atmosphere inside is homey yet urban, with a few tvs and very friendly staff. I always order online, and they are always ready for me when I get in."], ["Jackie F.", "Okay, so....Happy Hour is amazing. Sure....it ends early but dude....I can take advantage during my lunch hour. Deals on beer, ramen, and sushi make this girl happy.My only complaint is that it's slllllloooooowwww. I don't expect my food here to be fast food fast, but goodness, when you have plenty of state employees coming in during the lunch rush it would be nice to actually eat versus scarfing food down. Next time I'll be ready to order once I sit down...."], ["Annie K.", "Udon was really good, rolls and nigiri were decent, and stuffed jalape\u00f1o appetizer was delicious. They were out of fried oysters, though :( Price is decent, too."], ["Tiffany D.", "This sushi restaurant is located in Broadway and luckily, they have their own parking spaces for customers so parking isn't too hard to find. Upon arrival, I was seated promptly. The restaurant isn't too big so there's only one server taking care of all the tables. Service was good, it could've been a little faster. Now on to the food.. Stuffed jalape\u00f1os: deep fried battered jalapenos with some type of meat inside. I got this as an appetizer and I was pretty relieved it wasn't too spicy. I thought this plate was alright. I would probably try another appetizer next time Lamp chops: you get to choose how you want your lamp chops cooked and this had lots of flavor! It comes with a bowl of rice. I thought the rice balanced out the flavor of the lamp chops perfectly. The flavor kind of reminded me of something you would taste at a Korean bbq restaurant 49er: this roll had salmon and guac on top. I thought this roll was really good! The guac on top was creative. The panko shrimp gave it a nice crunch and had a good spice from the siracha sauce. American Dream: my boyfriend liked this roll. It has a few different types of fish on it and drizzled with lots of sauce. Salmon salad: if you like salmon and garlic, you will love this. The salmon is seared \u00a0and has garlic aioli right on top.Overall impression: this place was alright. The sushi itself had lots of rice and I had to pick most of the rice out of the rolls. I felt that the sushi rice wasn't prepared properly cause I can see the rice falling apart from the sushi. However, their happy hour menu would probably convince me to come back. I would love to try their ramen and udon noodles next"], ["Kathy Y.", "My friend and I were in search of a ramen house and stumbled upon Kyoto. \u00a0The interior is a bit small and has a homey-cozy feeling, imitating the Japan feel (even the toilets - check it out). \u00a0The waitress was friendly and said we could seat ourselves. \u00a0Service was good, our food came out in a timely manner, and occasionally asked how our food tasted. I ordered the red tonkatsu ramen and my friend had the dinner bento box with mixed tempura and sesame chicken, and we both shared the OMG roll. \u00a0My ramen had a nice spicy kick to it (I love spicy foods and this wasn't too spicy) and the tonkatsu pork melted in my mouth; overall, one of the better ramen I've had in Sac. The OMG roll was a decent size, the fish was fresh and plenty, and there was a good amount of sauce (fyi in case you don't like sauce, but I thought I complimented well). \u00a0The dinner bento box had huge portions. I tried a little bit of the sesame chicken; it was moist with a light batter. I would definitely recommend this place! \u00a0I'm looking forward to trying the pork belly ramen next time. \u00a0;)"], ["Kali D.", "I had this review located at yelp.com/biz/kyoto-sushi\u2026, but I saw this new page so I'm re-posting this review.

Then we are told But everything is 50% off but drinks. Ok ok now you talking!Thinking it was Happy Hour plus a HH menu was displayed we attempted to order vino, but no no due to 50% off no HH on drinks. Ok fine but vino was $4 so it's ok. We settled on a number of items; gyoza, Pepperfin, jalape\u00f1o poppers, a fantasy roll, oysters lol and more! All the food came very timely. But sadly it was mediocre. Not all the oysters tasted great, Pepperfin ok, jalape\u00f1o poppers had fish in the mixture making them to fishy, etc etc. It all was hella cheap, but not the best or even good! Maybe within time? But I'm confused, they changed names and management again but some of the same employees. Thus they are not new to the cooking world.

The menu is extensive and centers around sushi, but it also has a nice ramen list, plus rice bowls and entrees.

Good amount of parking and even going there for dinner around prime time it wasn't too packed getting into the parking lot or finding parking. We got seated quickly as the place wasn't that packed. Friendly server and good food. Between the two of us my girlfriend got a Benjamin roll and a Bob's roll as well as a beef teriyaki plate. Benjamin is one of my favorites. I like the spiciness, Bob's isn't bad but I like having the kick of the spice and Bob's is a bit more plain. It was enjoyable. There's nothing amazing about the place to me as I've grown up with Taro's but this is a good place for a nice dinner or with a group of friends. The service is friendly and attentive without being overbearing and the food is decent. It's a solid four stars."], ["Jennifer P.", "Of all of the Mikuni locations, this one is by far my favorite. The sushi chefs are all fantastic and very friendly. Ryan is the BEST! He is always making suggestions for us based upon what is fresh that day, and there hasn't been one thing yet from him that we have been disappointed in flavor-wise or consistency of presentation. Last meal on earth? This is probably my spot. The sauces they make take the flavor profiles to another level, and their simple dishes (nigiri, sashimi) are always fresh, never badly trimmed or cleaned.We go here a lot, but even the staff that don't serve us often remember us and our favorite orders.Love this place."], ["Cassandra T.", "I got a Sacramento Roll, and man was it delicious! Very Americanized, obviously considering it was deep fried. 5 stars on that roll. I also got a California Roll, very basic and yummy and light. 5 stars if you like simplicity.I got vanilla, and strawberry mochi and they're only $1.50 so it's a nice price! 5 stars because they're so yummy! The customer service was wonderful! The food was wonderful! No complaints!"], ["Erica M.", "Some of the best sushi in town, I absolutely love this place. I met some friends for happy hour and I must say it was a great experience. We ordered a lot of items from the happy hour menu and I was blown away by how delicious everything was. The Freaky Edamame is really good. They cook the edamame in garlic and other spices so not only does it smell savory, it taste wonderful. The Fair Oaks roll is really good too, and I must say they aren't cheap with the shrimp. This roll has a good size tempura shrimp inside, yummy. We also ordered the Flaming Shrooms and I must say that is probably one of the best things I have every tasted. Every time I go back I will undoubtedly order this. I'm not usually a huge fan of mushrooms but after eating these I have become a believer. The mushroom is stuff with a crab mix with cream cheese, jalapenos and fried in a tempura batter. Simply delicious.The ambiance is a little more upscale but you will be fine walking in dressed down. The bar tenders and wait staff were very friendly and accommodating. The restaurant has TV's throughout with whatever game is on so its a great place to have some great food and watch your favorite team.

However, their voice mail instructed me to leave a message and someone would call me back. I did as instructed leaving a brief but detailed message making a birthday reservation dinner for two. Around 1:45pm, I became concerned that I didn't get a call back to confirm my 6pm reservation, and here it was almost 2pm. So I called again. I asked if they had gotten my vm message and were able to schedule my 6pm reservation? The \u00a0woman answering the phone was very curt and stated that they don't take vm reservations and that I need to call during business hours. Note that while she repeated this statement throughout the conversation, she never actually said what the hours were. I asked if someone from Kru was planning to call me back to let me know of this, since that policy was not indicated on their outgoing vm and I would otherwise not have known. She stated that no, no one was planning to call me back, \"I suggest you call during business hours\". Very politely, I asked if I could make a suggestion... that they state their policy in their recording... She kept cutting me off, talking over me, and was generally rude. \u00a0She said with a very nasty attitude that she'd pass the message on. But since she wouldn't let me talk, I doubt she actually heard the message. It's been a long time since I dined at Kru. No doubt the food is exceptional. However, I hope the staff is more pleasant in person than they were over the phone. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and see how it goes tonight.Ok. Here's an update. \u00a0Thankfully, the interaction on the phone did not match the service we received face to face. The service was excellent! Our waiter, William, was awesome... very attentive but not to the point of being intrusive, \u00a0and quite pleasant. All the staff were very courteous and accommodating.

Me and the bf came here for a nice date night dinner and decided to do the omakase. It started with a cold corn soup which was to die for, my first time ever having cold soup glad I tried it. That was followed by a fresh grilled squash salad which had a char taste that actually was fantastic. We also were served oysters with caviar, beef Tatar with fish skin chips, a variety of nigiri. But by far the best dish was a tie between the 3 squash fritter over a bed of salmon and tomatoes or their version of fried rice with veggies and crisp wagu beef. Fantastic meal and experience!

I order it every time I go to Kru. Lastly, my boyfriend and I got a free dessert. ;) Their employees are very awesome.I highly recommend this place."], ["Gina G.", "Nice quiet spot on J st. We went here before a concert at Harlow thinking we could walk to both easily. The ambiance is nice and the food presentation is fancy. I'm guessing that is what we paid for also.

The sashimi and nigiri was very good here but the rolls are poorly packed. Pick up one piece and it falls fully apart. They did put some effort into the nigiri, so it wasn't BAU on that front.

I am literally a sushi obsessed freak of nature. Like, I could eat it all day, every day and not even be upset about it. Sushi for breakfast? Why not?! Sushi as a midnight snack? Even better!! Throw some sake in the mix every now and then, and I am one happy camper! Anyway... enough ranting. The food here is both fresh and creative. You can get artfully plated grade-A sashimi and nigiri that just melts in your mouth OR a wacky, crazy, funky roll with layers of flavor. They are masters of it all here, and always have innovative specials going on too. Don't know what you want? Just ask the chefs to surprise you. I've never had a bad meal here in my life and neither will you.Some personal faves are the Sashimi Tapas, \u00a0Sunshine Roll, Sake Steamed Mussels, Great White Roll, Beef Marrow, and any of the fresh fish daily specials. Oh, and their Happy Hour is great too. Love the Lomi Salmon and the Hamachi Scallion Handroll!

While I can't say anything about the regular menu (rolls, etc) in this review, I can give kudos to the omakase served here. The most different thing about the omakase here as opposed to other sushi places is that they also include mini non-sashimi appetizer dishes in between the sashimi/nigiri. At first I wasn't sure how I felt about this, but after tasting the different small plates I'd say that it definitely adds to the overall experience.They serve uni from Japan here!!! That alone gets me excited. If you have never tried uni from Japan, please do yourself a favor and order it. Do a side by side taste comparison with uni from California and you'll be blown away by the difference. Other fish we were served during our meal: monkfish liver, kampachi, hamachi (two varieties - farmed and wild), live scallop... others I seem to be forgetting at the moment. Some of the best fish I've ever had!The owner of the restaurant was actually the one who served us all the fish for our omakase, which was a nice touch. Super nice guy! And we even got to take a few shots of sake with him.So if you have a special occasion coming up or just some extra cash to blow, treat yourself to a sushi experience and get the omakase at Kru!"], ["Karen K.", "I had the idea to review this place after attending the Sake Fest. \u00a0I wanted people to know that this is not authentic Japanese food.

It is located on busy J Street which is probably convenient for a lot of people who work downtown. \u00a0Their service is average. \u00a0The place itself is really not that large that if you come with a large group, you might have to wait a while. The food does come out very artisticly on the plate. \u00a0I do give them props for that. Here it isn't about large amount of food but how it is presented. \u00a0Probably why the chef at Kru did not win the sushi making contest at the Sake Fest. \u00a0The cost for dinner is not cheap. \u00a0Probably best to come here for a special occasion.I probably wouldn't be coming back here as it's pricey and the taste of the food is average to me.

Sitting at the bar was a bit uncomfortable especially with the servers getting plates right next to you. Food was very presentable. The beef marrow bone was the most memorable dish I had tried. Never had that before this restaurant, but it was still delicious. Tesla roll sounded really good on the menu, but when it came to taste, it was bland. The flavors didn't come together very well in a roll. Regardless, the sushi chefs were very knowledgeable about their menu & gave very good suggestions."], ["Ameenah M.", "Walked in at 10. The host told us that there was four people ahead of us if we wanted to sit at a table but if we wanted to sit at the bar they'll wipe it down for is real quick. We sit down.

Keep in mind this place is extremely small. Their capacity is probably 40. The place itself is extremely nice, it's like an upper scale Japanese restaurant. Nice ambiance. It takes 20 mins to take our order. And another 10 mins to bring out our drinks. Keep in mind I'm checking the time. I lie I went to the restroom and there's more tables in the back lol. Still not too big.Food: presentation of the food was really nice. We ordered the j street roll and fire cracker roll. We also got hot ramen with lamb in spicy miso broth. The j street roll was great. The fire cracker was eh, it wasn't even spicy. So much for jalape\u00f1o being in it. It also has this sauce at the bottom, which tastes like soy sauce. The ramen was ok. Lamb is something else though, it had pouched egg over it. That was new. I prefer my ramen somewhere else. Would I come back. Maybe. I could probably have better somewhere else. Service was super nice but extremely slow."], ["Rosanna K.", "Fresh sashimi, innovative rolls and small plates (think tapas), AND real wasabi? It doesn't get much better than this. I've been to Kru on several occasions and have never been disappointed. What ever you do, order one of their sashimi platters. Each platter comes with an assortment of some of the freshest sashimi I've had, along with their fresh wasabi root. The fresh wasabi is SO GOOD that I end up asking for a side order of it just so that I can put it on top of everything I order. Yummm Their menu changes from time to time, but if I really enjoy their scallop and uni small plate. They also serve bone marrow here. The flavor is good, but is a little too rich for my taste. My friend really enjoyed it tho!As for dessert, get their chocolate molten lava cake! I know will probably be stuffed by the time you get to dessert, but trust me, it is worth it.

Popular or not, Kru has plenty of room for improvement:1. The food was simply too salty. Both my husband's and my meals were deluged in goopy, oily, brothy saltiness. I don't have any contraindications, don't get me wrong, but the surplus the chefs use here almost seems like an apology.2. Service was a labored crawl. Food from the kitchen arrived to the table 20+ minutes before sushi. The sushi was prettily plated and good, but that doesn't reconcile the lag time. 3. Wakame was severely under-dressed and warm. 4. The bill was steep for what we ordered. There's a noticeable chasm between $8 and $20 rolls, no real fair-to-midland items, which is weird. If not for the fact that Kru was on the way home from Destination A, I probably would have stuck to one of my usual spots."], ["Raf G.", "Had a nice date night here with the wife.

Not only was the meat hard they threw in 2 duck necks that have almost zero meat on them. The menu says duck wings not duck necks.Sunshine roll was very good, nice lemon taste and I enjoyed the flavor of it. It was pretty yummy.The Krazy Kali was good, but if your a someone that enjoys actual raw fish sushi this is not the roll for you. I liked it, but I'm not a serious sushi person.

It is not uncommon to have something put in front of you overnighted from Japan like the uni, hotate. otoro, etc. The otoro is so damn buttery!! Their wasabi root was a refreshing and very tasty; it was highlight for me for sure.Billy and Ricky know their stuff and are quite personable which adds to the experience. I love that they incorporate mostly nigiri and very few rolls, if any, throughout the meal. Service is on point as well as I don't think I was ever without a beer in hand and water in cup.

We ordered Spicy Tan Tan Ramen, BBQ Albacore, and Kimmie roll! The Spicy Tan Tan ramen was very flavorful! I love it! I can smell the bamboo shoots, I wish they give us some more tangible meat vs ground meat and some veggies. The BBQ albacore was good, we ordered 3 pieces vs 6 pieces. The Kimmie roll was different, it had bacon bits on top which was good! The place is a bit small, I can hear everything that's going on at the front door.

The Kimmie had good sized slices of fresh salmon and yellow tail. It also had bacon bits for texture. Dessert was fried cheesecake with green tea and ube ice cream on top, which I looked forward to more than anything. Presentation of all the dishes came with extra oomph. The place is much smaller than I imagined. Be prepared to wait for a table unless you come early. Service was good. The waitress checked on us multiple times.

I went with my boyfriend and we ordered 3 rolls and unagi nigiri. The ungai was by far the best thing we had. The rolls we had were the elk grove roll which had bbq albacore on the top which was nice, the bomb dot com roll which was suppose to be very spicy and the Sacramento roll. The elk grove roll only redeeming factor was that there was bbq albacore on top. The bomb dot com roll was spicy but sadly that was it, i was hoping for some sort of spicyness which would bring out the flavor of the ingredients in the roll but NOPE. Then the Sacramento roll had bacon bits on it which was interesting but sadly I felt like all these rolls were one dimensional and didnt really have depth and the flavor that I was hoping for.Also I came on a Saturday night and the wait for my food took forever. People who came in and ordered after my bf and I got their food before or at the same time. I waited over 30 minutes just to get my rolls which would be somewhat understandable if the were a lot of people waiting for their food before me but there wasn't because I noticed all the tables around me we finishing up and they got their food so I don't understand why there was such a long wait.Only reason this place didnt get 1 star is because our waiter was actually good. He kept coming by to see how we were doing and apologizing for the wait. He also kept checking up on our order and tried to figure out why it took so long. I do wish he didn't lie to our face and say that it is slow because it was crowded when clearly it wasn't.I won't be back, this place to far away from me, takes too long and there are plenty of other good options for quality sushi in Sacramento."], ["Vanessa M.", "Was super excited to try this place and let me tell you, it's worth all the hype! We had the choice to sit at a table or the sushi bar, the decor is very clean and inviting. They have a ton of choices anything from rolls to lunch boxes to like 5 different types of oysters. We went with the box where you can choose 2 choices, we went with the boxes and both chose the BBQ albacore tuna and tempura vegis. And OH MY GOD the BBQ tuna was AMAZING! Perfect sauce, just the right amount of kick to it. The tuna itself was so tender. Left me wanting more! If I had to do it over I would have ordered 2 of the BBQ tuna instead of the tempura vegis. We also added a roll to each of our orders, I got the dragon 9 and the hubby got the bomb dot com which is know for its heat!!! We both loved the rolls! Our lunch boxes also came with rice and a salad with a tasty dressing. They didn't skimp on the good vegis such as asparagus and the broccoli was cooked perfectly.Very excited about this place...I would totally recommend the BBQ tuna, and next time I go I'm also going to try the BBQ salmon. Yummy! Our bill came to $51 but I think they are totally worth the money!"], ["Ashley C.", "When I first heard about Sushi Q, I'll be honest I wasn't expecting much. But as the days and weeks went by, I noticed a lot of rave reviews! We aren't in the area often which is why it took a while for us to come try it out - but we decided to choose this place to meet some friends for dinner and fulfill our sushi craving. There's a ton of options for sushi rolls on their menu. It's hard for me to pick when everything is just listed out with no photos...all of the rolls begin to sound so similar. I finally picked the Sacramento roll - it has bacon, so why not?! It was odd, but it worked. I think it just needs some spice to balance out with the salt - maybe a dash of sriracha or spicy mayo, or fresh jalape\u00f1o to give it a kick. Their rolls are a little on the pricey side compared to the size of the actual roll (I'm partial to Sushi Hook, large rolls and affordable prices), but still reasonable for some good quality rolls with plenty of toppings. The server was very helpful - he advised us to be careful ordering their spiciest roll. He even brought us a sample of the habanero sauce - and he was definitely right. It burns your tongue right away! Check out their specials listed behind the bar and ask them for their to go menu..there are a few rolls on there that they haven't put on the regular menu yet!"], ["Pu B.", "I love how convenient this place is located to me. As for the sushi they give good portions and the fish is definitely a little higher grade then the 50% off places. The price is a little on the higher side almost damn near mikuni price.

They also have very cute wooden plates and our server was super nice!"], ["Leilani Q.", "5 stars for the moment I ingested a piece of the scallop tataki roll, stopped in mid bite & realized I embarked on a new mind elevating favorite. So much so, I winced in emotional pain & greed when I watched with hands in claws as Hubby ate the last piece. I wanted to order a roll to go, but due to the 25 minute wait on the roll (I asked server how long it would take to order to go) due to the party of 10 that just walked in, and the 1 hr seating wait, I said, \"Nah I'm good.\" $9 a roll4 stars for the super uber yummy BBQ albacore whose taste has depth, a hint of spice, the great accompaniments, daikon & lemon, that added a dimension of fresh & tart to my anticipating tongue. Minus a star cuz I am spoiled by great AYCE buffets like Fuji & Azukar & don't believe in paying much for sushi anymore. 6 pieces for $114 stars for the great sashimi platter, 18 piece chef's choice. I was very happy I found a new favorite, the white flesh colored fish with a sliver of silver skin around it. Never had it before that night, but it was very good! $183 stars for the big, decieving picture of the Extreme roll, whose variety of additives & hefty price of $13 miraged my brain into thinking it would be the roll that caused the mouthgasm of the entire meal. Mouthgasm cause it did not. The inner content's amount-to-rice ratio was \"meh\" & the soft shell crab was so not fresh or just cooked. I am very very big on fresh especially if something is fried. It was cooked earlier & that fact was evident. Won't get again. 5 stars for the hunky buff Asian server who was patient with my undecided self, despite the full house & hungry patrons at the climax of dinner rush hour. He came back at least 3 or 4 times. And not once did his beefy quadriceps legs try n scurry off as I spoke mid-sentence. Good job for that. A lil thoughts before you come n check it out...I personally would bring a group of 6 at the most, or less of my loud crazy girlfriends, but no more than 6. This places size borderlines \"mom-n-pop\" shop. It's that small. And if you want a romantic-cozy-quiet-feel-on-your-Hotties-leg place to cozy up n stare into each others corneas, go elsewhere. It's loud club status up in hizzle. Club being said, if you like that scene, it may be a good place to peep out a new beau. If you like the type, well dressed Asians ages 20-40 populate this place. At least last Friday night they did. And I would suggest against bringing kids or toddlers unless they are ok with very confined spaces & lots of noise. Besides theres probably limited to slim space to even put a high chair.Other stuff that looked good to try was the the fried cheesecake, good for fat days. Oh & the oysters I wanna try too. Other food fare seemed typical of Sushi spots. And if you have old eyes, or a contact prescription of -7 or similar, bring your magnifying glass to read the menu. No kidding, the font size is like 6 or 7. Would I come back, yes I would. But on a Mon-Fri lunch or def before 6:30pm. We came at 6:45pm on a Friday & still waited 15 mins. Hunky buff server was overheard saying it's \"always this busy \" & when we left around 7:30pm waits were up to an hour, & people were leaving to find another place to eat."], ["Connie C.", "This tiny, new sushi restaurant is first place in my finding the-best-sushi-restaurant-in-Elk-Grove race! I was really impressed with what this little restaurant had to offer!I was impressed with the large sashimi platter. There were wonderful cuts of your typical tuna and salmon but they also had octopus, crab, halibut and other varieties. It was so worth the $26. I loved the presentation on a wooden boat as well. I am actually salivating for this dish as we speak.They actually offer pickled wasabi with the sashimi platter that just \"packed a punch\" in every bite! I loved pairing each sashimi piece with this pickled wasabi! The wasabi really enhanced the dish to another level. I have not heard of any other sushi restaurant offering pickled wasabi as a condiment.The spicy ramen was also a wonderful entree. I usually have to ask for Sriracha or the Japanese chili flakes for more spice/hotness in other restaurants, but this was perfectly spicy to my liking. I found the noodles cooked well and broth full of flavor besides just spicy. I would get this dish over and over again. I was also happy that they offer Gunther's ice cream in this restaurant. I can tell this restaurant appreciates quality for their customers.The only downfall is this is a smaller sushi restaurant. It can get packed which is great for the owners but it can be a problem during busy times."], ["Karen K.", "There were five booth tables, twelve sushi bar seats plus two tables in the middle in a very cute contemporary ambiance. We arrived here on a Sunday and it being a small place but new was already crowded. We were seated by the owner Kim whom I had recognized as she had cut my hair once before in a local hair salon plus she mentioned she just opened the restaurant with her husband.I asked about the lunch box special but it was only good for lunch. I was a bit disappointed that they did not offer it for dinner. We did however receive a complimentary but small bowl of slightly spicy edamame. I ordered the lobster tempora and veggie tempora which were both small plates. They did not come with a bowl of rice which was fine with me but it may not be enough for someone else! Because they were small plates they would have come first which was what the waitress warned me. So I asked that they arrive simultaneously as everyone else's entrees. Because it was our anniversary weekend I went with the lobster tempora. This was the first time I ever had this. I asked for tempora dipping sauce but was unaware of why it wasn't brought out in the first place until I separated the pieces for a pic. \u00a0The reason being was there were two different sauces hiding underneath the lobster. One was a darker sauce like for tonkatsu and the other had a nice spicy kick that enhanced the lobster tempora. Both were awesome and it was a definite plus!Later came out my vegetarian tempora which the waitress warned me it was plate hot. I didn't eat it right away anyway because I was savoring the lobster tempora. The vegetarian tempora was excellent though I would order the shrimp tempora next time.I was pleased however with our service. Waters were constantly filled and they also asked if we wanted dessert but passed being there were taro or green tea ice cream or \u00a0 mochi.My husband had the chirashi which was so beautifully & artistically displayed. I'm sorry I didn't take a picture though because it wasn't my entree. My hubby did say it was the best he's ever had as they usually are the chef's choice as to what is placed inside. It's basically different kinds of sashimi on top of sweet sushi rice. Kind of like eating sushi but in a larger sized bowl. Daughter's bf even expressed that he would choose to eat that the next time. All in all we had a favorable experience that we may come back especially if I crave lobster or if my husband would like chirashi. It wouldn't be our first choice but it is a definitely an option."], ["Kimmy N.", "I was introduced to this place by my brother in law and from several friends because of their snap chats and I hadddd to try this place out!! The place is super tiny but there is a good sized bar. I will say that going in big groups might be a little difficult or there will be a wait time! I've been here twice and was seated right away but this place was a full house both times I came here. The people here are really nice. Nice servers and the sushi chefs were friendly as well. They will definitely take care of you at the bar! Waters were always refilled by the servers and emptied out our dishes. The food here is amazing! I tried the torch roll (without the torch) and the elk Grove roll. The elk Grove roll was definitely my favorite roll that I've tried since there were BBQ albacore on top. This was only $14! Arigatos sells the BBQ albacore appetizer for $13.95 so the elk Grove roll is a good deal (only if they keep their prices since I went during soft opening). Definitely try their salmon sashimi! Their large sashimi platter was definitely worth it. $26 for 25 pieces of assorted sashimi. BOMBBBB selection of fish that was provided. My friend ordered the Nigiri combo for $17 I believe and her boyfriend loved it and made her order more food to go for him LOL I will definitely be coming back with more people and already recommended this place to tons of people so I hope sushi q is prepared for more customers! I will say that the food takes a while for it to come out but the wait is worth It :)"], ["Stephanie A.", "Just average for me. The boyfriend and I decided to try this place since they just opened and we happened to drive by. The restaurant was a lot smaller than expected but had a wonderful atmosphere to it. They serve on wooden plates/bowls which was just really unique and cute. I was surprised of how many servers there were for the size of the restaurant. There were a lot of servers and they were all very friendly and attentive. Great service. I was super excited to see pork-based ramen on their menu and decided to order that. It was subpar, in my opinion. The broth was not as creamy and tasty compared to our usual ramen spots. I found it very bland and was still bland after adding soy sauce and didn't want to ruin the taste by adding too much soy sauce. The amount of toppings in the ramen, the meat, bamboo, egg/corn, was very little. The pork meat was just okay, the seasoned egg was delicious and tasty. However, I probably wouldn't eat ramen here again. I also ordered a California roll on the side. It tasted great but didn't look the most appealing for a sushi roll. The rice had little holes here and there, it wasn't even/wrapped tight enough. The masago was in clumps on top of the roll and wasn't distributed evenly. Overall, it was slightly sloppy. We were also disappointed in how late the roll came out. The server did apologize about it but when I looked at the sushi chefs (3-4 of them) behind the sushi bar, there was a whole lot of talking and laughing, and to be honest, there were not many people ordering sushi at the time. In the end, the roll came out near the end after we had finished our food. The boyfriend ordered the unagi plate. We found the plating really pretty and unique, and it was really pleasing to the eyes. It came out, fresh and hot off the grill so it tasted delicious. The salad that came with the unagi plate was delicious! We loved the salad dressing which had a sweet, vinegar-y, sesame(?) taste to it. The miso soup was hot delicious and doesn't have the faucet-water taste like many other restaurants do. Based mainly off my meal, which was the ramen and Cali roll, I'm going with a 3. Excellent service, nice atmosphere. We will definitely be back to this place that's full of potential to be the hottest spot in town."], ["Karen T.", "Super cute place that serves sushi on wooden plates. Woot!My friend and I shared the large sashimi order and the Kimmie roll, which was just enough food for us. The Kimmie roll had bacon bits that added a nice texture to the roll. All the fish tasted very fresh and I felt like we got our money's worth.The place seemed to get busy around around 7:30pm/8:00pm. Didn't realize how small the place was until all the seats were filled.Service was pretty decent. This place is definitely worth a visit!"], ["Jessica W.", "Real wasabi!!! I am never really impressed with sushi restaurants in Elk Grove. They usually start off as a regular priced menu at Grand opening, and then as time goes on, they turn in to an all rolls half off restaurant due to business not doing so well. This I say because in Elk Grove, everything is a fad issue. Once your in and then next thing you know, your out! If the sashimi is not fresh, produce isn't fresh, and rolls have an over abundance of rice then all fails for me at a sushi restaurant. \u00a0Sushi Q is located in a pretty good location I'd say, due to it being in a prime shopping center with a grocery store and many other chains located right next to it. The restaurant it self is pretty small, but it is A-OK to me because it is sushi and a mom and pop store I think. Dining area sits in an L shape. Prices are very reasonable..food is served on bamboo rather than the oriental plastic plates or the white ikea dishes, innovative. We ordered the spicy garlic edamame, \u00a0very reasonable portion for the price.Large sashimi boat, nicely cut and very fresh variety of fishes. My fave!Sushi Q roll, interesting choices of flavors complimenting eachother, especially the bf red garlic on top. The roll was very big, bigger than I expected. Service was great. She Checked On US ALOT. Knocked down a star \u00a0because it was my first time, hope everything stays consistent and it will be my new and only sushi place in town."], ["Tania H.", "The fact that there's a sushi restaurant that's so good and so close to my house is scary!! I'm going to be broke pretty soon. The food here was so great! We ordered the bond roll, torch roll (which had a garlic sauce on top and normally I hate garlic but this roll was so tasty!), the pepperfin, and the nigiri. Everything was delicious. The pepperfin only had 7 pieces though but still so good. The fish is fresh and their rolls are a good size. The prices here won't put a huge hole in your wallet after your dining experience. Our servers were extremely attentive which I can ALWAYS appreciate. The only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars is that the sushi bar was a bit slow. I felt like we were waiting awhile for all our food so that was a little disappointing but knowing that they're a new restaurant there's definitely kinks that will need to be worked out. I also think they need a host station. When we walked in we didn't know who to ask for a seat but then someone at the other end of the sushi bar came over and asked us if we wanted to sit at a table or bar. I know that when my sister came here on the same day no one bothered to help her or her boyfriend so they ended up walking out. Try this place out. The restaurant is very small so try and plan accordingly. Maybe go early/later or order to go. I have a feeling that once word gets out how awesome the food is here the line will be out the door and the waits will get crazy. I will definitely be back though. I saw someone next to us eating the ramen and it looked bomb."], ["Ricky N.", "Contemporary Japanese food and sushi done right! Definitely worth a try.They're still brand spanking new so give them some wiggle room for errors.The things that stood out to me were: BBQ Albacore (6 pc) $11 tasty and seared perfectlyCalvine Roll $11 which has lots of yellowtail and hamachi then topped with thin lemon slices Salmon Skin roll $7, simple but crispy with a lot of taste and textureLarge Sashimi platter $26, chef's choice of fresh fish. Comes with seaweed salad and pickled wasabi, really well presented. Be sure to let them know if there's a sashimi you don't likeWe also ordered the Calamari and some hand rolls, but they weren't items I would order again.Try to plan ahead because there is NOT that much seating, small restaurant but really nice interior.Sake bombs for $2! Not bad, and they give you a good amount of beer! We will definitely be back."], ["Marvan C.", "Was in town and searched for a good sushi restaurant close by and Sushi Q came up. \u00a0I sat at the sushi bar with a bunch of my friends for over 3 hours and none of the staff rushed me. This is the spot to come chill and enjoy some bomb ass sushi. The fish is super fresh, the best I've ever had, no joke. There is no hype, just my type... Quality over quantity for sure even though I ate more than I anticipated. \u00a0Service was great and the chefs know what they're doing. Going into detail about some of their fish, they served me stuff I've never had before like king mackerel, king salmon, and 3 types of oysters. They topped of their nigiri with unique flavors that left me wanting more. I will definitely be back every time I'm in town. \u00a0They even have beers and sake I couldn't find anywhere else in Sacramento or Elk Grove. Sushi Q, you the shit!"], ["Thomas A.", "My family and I got there about 8:30pm. Waited about 10 mins. There was probably 4 chairs at the bar left. It was pretty busy. Atmosphere was clean, well lit, hostess was kind. When we were seated, waiter was prompt, ordered our drinks, and then ordered. Got the calamari appetizer, very tasty. Would order again.Entries came out after 15-20mins afterwards. A little longer than I had expected but not a problem. My family loves sushi. Everyone ordered rolls except the wifey, she got the Chicken Katsu.Uncle J roll - flavorful Bomb Dot Com - heater, yummy, didn't burn my taste buds off, creeper heat, able to eat the other rollsChicken Katsu - moist, batter was good and crispy I forgot the other rolls but all of it was pretty yummyWill come back again so we try the rest of the rolls."], ["Alejandra M.", "5 stars for its delicious sushi rolls and great service ! Came out of town and was in the mood for sushi and this lovely place happened to be right down the street from were we were at. There's a lot of interesting sushi to choose from we settled with ordering The Bomb.com (extremely spicy! Would suggest if you're a spicy sushi lover ) and the Overdose ( really really delicious ! Big, Crunchy and sweet) we also ordered miso soup because even though it's not complimentary it's well worth buying. OH! And dessert!! FRIED CHEESECAKE!! Amazing way to end a delicious meal :)"], ["Bruce S.", "This place was great! Sushi chef TJ, Ben and Adam have many years behind the counter and very helpful when my girlfriend and I were deciding on house specials!"], ["Kristen S.", "Holy shit this place is bomb.It just opened and the crowd is already packed. I believe it's been open a month. My friend and I went here tonight and ordered half the menu and ate it all.Awards go to the fried calamari for classiest junk food on the menu, 26 for $25 sashimi for best healthy item on the menu that was nowhere near as filling as it sounded, and an award for that one roll we had that was really good and it doesn't matter which one because they are all delicious. How do I know? Because everything we ate was delicious. Oh and I tried roe and eel for the first time and they were good too. Especially the eel. Man. I like me some eel.The prices are expensive like any other sushi spot but it's worth it. We were there for like two hours but we probably could've gone on to eat like four more rolls. The space is small so you hear everyone's conversation along with yours, but it's not so loud that you can't hear who you're talking to. Overall you'd never expect such bomb sushi to come out of this hole in the wall. I may or may not be back depending on how fat/broke I want to get in the future."], ["Joseph J.", "Sushi q -Walked in not knowing what to expect but this place turned out to be a hidden gem!

After living in Japan for about 14 years, I love finding real authentic Japan eats, not to mention, legit sushi. I am so glad I tried this place. It's a small little establishment, but very cozy. I ordered the Wagyu beef nigiri ($18 for two pieces) which was worth every penny! ... It literally melted in my mouth like butter and had an amazing taste I can't even describe. My friend and I ended up ordering a total of four rolls: extreme, Sacramento, Elk Grove, and taste like chicken. If your a BBQ albacore lover, the Elk Grove roll is right up your alley. It was the best out of the rolls. Sacramento roll had bacon bits and it wasn't too overpowering.... All the rolls were fresh, tasty, and 100% Japan stamped! I will definitely come back for more, even if it's a long drive from Sacramento.Oh, and the servers were very attentive and friendly! Great customer service here!"], ["Jenny V.", "Never wrote an review before, now I am. Wow! First time coming to this restaurant last Wednesday 11/11. Little wait but that's ok, Service was excellent.

We ordered a sesame chicken, steamed sea bass, Elk Grove Roll, and Kandy Kain roll. Service was very slow. The sesame chicken came out first, which was when the football game just started. The person who ordered that finished and then we waited. The seabass then came. That was also finished and we waited. Finally my sushi rolls came out, and it was almost halftime for the game!And it wasn't worth the wait! The Elk Grove Roll is supposed to have tempura shrimp in the middle but all I found inside was a sad, soggy, lukewarm shrimp. The Kandy Kain wasn't any better and seemed to lack some sort of textural balance.Staggered wait times for mediocre food? I'll pass for the time being. I'll give them another try when they work out the issues."], ["Pearl M.", "Bomb.com!We came here on a mini-date night and were happy with our service and LOVED it here.

I obsess over both these dishes at Kru and was excited to find a closer option but I probably wouldn't order these again. \u00a0For my main dish, I ordered their Tempura Udon for $10 and added pork cha su for another $2. \u00a0This and their ramen were probably my favorites, surprisingly! \u00a0And finally, I threw in a Bombdotcom Roll because I was ordering with my stomach and when I realized I had absolutely no room for it, it was already too late to cancel my order. \u00a0When it came out, our server forewarned us that it was going to be spicy and he was right!!! \u00a0It was all kinds of spicy! \u00a0Their insanity sauce is exactly what it's named. \u00a0My first bite was manageable but when I brought it home and ate the rest, I was dying. \u00a0No wonder it has 5 peppers next to it on the menu! \u00a0Nonetheless, it was a good roll and the spice still didn't overpower the fish. \u00a0Finally, I think one of their best deals are on their sashimi platters! \u00a0Our large, 25 piece, came out with a lot more than 25 pieces! \u00a0There were the basics: maguro, albacore, hamachi and salmon. \u00a0Then there was also, I believe katsuo, escolar, crab a bit of kizame wasabi and wakame on the side! \u00a0For $26, this was definitely a steal. \u00a0There's so many other options on the menu, I will definitely be back to try the rest. \u00a0SushiQ may not top my favorite sushi spot, Kru but it is a winner as opposed to Mikunis. \u00a0Keep it up, SushiQ!"], ["Reeny W.", "I didn't feel like this was authentic Japanese food. \u00a0I can usually tell just by my miso soup test. \u00a0I didn't like the flavor of their miso and they used hard tofu instead of soft; hard tofu is a bit sour. \u00a0Also I can usually tell if they use flavored sushi rice; I couldn't taste it here. \u00a0Their rice was cooked very dry which is an indication that the cooks prefer long grain rice."], ["Chris O.", "The owner is staring over my right shoulder as I type this .

Life's been busy, but at the same time I haven't been to a place where I had such a bad experience in a while. At the time of my visit this new place was sitting on a 4.5 Star review so it's gotta be at least decent to good, but the truth was far from it.We arrived on a Saturday night and was told the wait was 45 minutes. Although there was not too many people waiting, I noticed the place was quite small, a little cramped to be honest. So we waited 45 mins to be seated. We were placed at a table in the middle and it was so cramped that the waiters and waitresses had a hard time getting around us. We finally ordered our food and had high hopes! 30 mins passes... Where's our food? The place is no longer full and not that busy so why is it taking so long? 50 mins passes... Still waiting and not a word from any of our waiters to update us on the status of our dinner. I finally asked and the only answer I got was \"We normally have 4 chefs but tonight we only have one.\" Really? Saturday night and there's only 1 chef? They weren't apologetic either. After about 1 hour and 10 mins, our food finally arrives and we're already half-starved to death. The food should taste amazing at this point right? We noticed that 3 out of the 6 rolls we ordered were deep fried... It wasn't clear on their menu. I hate deep fried rolls. The sushi Q roll was the only decent one but was definitely not worth the wait. The spicy roll did not have any flavor and was spicy to the point that you can't really enjoy it.Overall, the layout of the restaurant is terrible, matching it's logistics of their kitchen crew and customer service. Food is mediocre but nothing to get excited about. This restaurant definitely has some kinks to work out, but they are also fairly new. Would I come back here? Probably not, there are many many better options in Sacramento. Maybe wait a year for things to improve and then try it out."], ["Josh K.", "Well, I have a new spot for really good sushi. \u00a0After looking at the other reviews I can understand the 4 star ratings but I would not hold it against them, they've been open less than a week (last week was their soft opening). \u00a0There will definitely be some hiccups.With that said, I came in on a Sunday around 5ish and lucked out because the dinner rush had not come in yet. \u00a0So I have been living off of half price sushi rolls at Bento Box in midtown, while their fish is fine and rolls aren't too shabby for the price, I also realized that it had been a while since I've spoiled my mouth.This place was a treat, not only to me, but my wallet. \u00a0Toro for only $10, and it was better Toro than I've had at Mikuni Downtown as well as a couple other spots. \u00a0Their rolls were all fairly priced with many under 10 dollars and only a few below 15, not necessitating the need for the half price gimmick, they're fair already.So we did Salmon, Himachi belly, Red Snapper, and a few other Nigiri. \u00a0They all melted in our mouths, the fish was so good. \u00a0We then had (Well I abstained, Im not a huge fan of the texture of Uni) the handrolls with Uni and the Pickled roe, the other two in the party loved it. \u00a0We then ordered some oysters and had both types, they were great, with pickeled real wasabi, and I'm not a fan of oysters.We followed that up with the Steamed Sea Bass, I wanted to make love to it and like the dish after, the sauce with it was amazing the meat was cooked perfectly. \u00a0At this point I was looking at some sort of flaw to ding them on. \u00a0All this time they were quick to make sure our waters were filled, beers were poured and $2 Sake bombs were coming when demanded.After that we busted out the small sashimi, it was anything but small. \u00a0I am posting a picture of it, the slices were ginormous and it even had Uni for those who dig it, and it was only $18, I felt like I was robbing them at this point. \u00a0We then finished this parade with a roll, I think it was a Cute Roll. \u00a0It was good, not too much sauce, but what I did notice was that the crab salad actually had real crab in it! \u00a0It looks like a 50/50 split. \u00a0The tempura shrimp was done perfectly and they even cut the tails off to make it more manageable.Everyone tapped out at that point, although I did see the calamari roll by, they use rings and tentacles, and I really wanted to try that (Next time squid, next time!). \u00a0I'd say it would've been topped off perfectly if they did a Green Tea Ice Cream Tempura sushi roll for desert, there's nothing better. \u00a0They did say they had the ice cream, a mousse and something else, but that's not what I wanted!!!So in summary:Incredibly fresh fish is masterful chefs who know their stuff, fair prices where you can have some incredible sushi and not break the bank. \u00a0Small footprint which can make it cramped but also keeps their overhead lower so they don't have to cut corners to pay rent (I've seen that too many times), very attentive servers (For some may feel too attentive, if so, say something, they seemed very responsive), and plan on multiple trips to try the whole menu, cause everything seems great."], ["Lien C.", "I must say, I'm impress. \u00a0I'm impress by how fresh their fishes are. \u00a0The blue fin tuna is to die for. \u00a0It was their special of the day, 2 pieces for $10 and well worth it. \u00a0It was so fresh, delicious and tasty it just melts in your mouth and slide right down. \u00a0Note: Don't you dear dip it in your soy sauce wassabi mixture either.I took one star away because I wasn't too trill with their rolls. \u00a0The Bomb Dot was too spicy and no flavor. \u00a0The Sushi Q was good but wasn't excellent and the best roll I had. \u00a0Overdose was also okay, but the flavor wasn't there either. \u00a0 \u00a0The service was good and the restuarant is on the small size so it gets pretty crowded when they get busy.I would definitely go back for their sashimi and try something different. \u00a0Wait, did I forget to mentioned about their BBQ Albacore ....What About it? Just Order it! You won't regret it!"], ["Hannah A.", "Sushi Q is soooo amazing. Service was quick and attentive. I love the color and art around the restaurant. It didn't feel cramped, but warm and inviting. \u00a0We were greeted right away and when we sat down, we ordered a beer and looked over the menu. Beer glasses was chilled and the beer was at perfect temperature, and I'm a picky beer drinker and I downed the whole glass. My boyfriend and I ordered 3 rolls between us, and a sesame chicken plate. The food arrived and was plated beautifully. I love the wood plates! Each roll tasted fresh and we finished our plates in no time. Finished off dinner with a creamy greentea ice cream. So glad we found this place. The owners did a fantastic job and this is going to be the newest hit spot on elk grove hands down. 10/10"], ["Steven M.", "Best place for fresh sashimi.

Will be back!"]], "Ju Hachi by Taka's": [["Sant\u00e9 H.", "I found the prices to be tolerable if nothing else, and that in itself the only shortcoming. The staff all had a pleasant countenance about them, but were relatively silent. The sushi was presented in a manner I would call nothing besides appropriate. The amount of rolls themselves were acceptable. Finally, and most importantly, they were exquisite to the taste. Whensoever I find myself craving sushi, this will be my preferred locale.I will add just that it is a calm enough place that I could actually savor the food instead of feeling the heavy gaze of waiters trying to push you out or similar such things, as in busy restaurants. This is of course convenient given that it was not busy at the time I was there."], ["Alice W.", "2.5 stars, round up because I feel mean if I went the other way. I gave this place several tries before coming down with this review. I have to say that while the service was impressive, on time and on point, very customer-oriented, the food left me very disappointed.First of all, anyone would balk at a plate of what came out to be a fat roll of rice, basically, and still have to pay $13 for \"sushi\". It was the salmon sushi roll, and it was not only mostly rice, it was 5 slices of this ginormous, very unconventionally sized roll (still yet, it was still just RICE). So disappointed. I do think their ramen is reasonable and their broth pretty decent. However after trying it several times, I've decided that while their tonkatsu broth is good and very authentic and rich, everything else in there is whatever and cheap. A few chashu slices and skimpy spinach leaves..... Not impressed. Overall the quality of the food was in the crapper. It was not good at all. Half-hearted effort. The service however was top notch. So I feel bad writing such a critical review when the staff members are apparently trying so hard. But the food needs a major tune up. Even for Sacramento standards, it was pretty unacceptable."], ["Lee S.", "Huge disappointment.Came here with my coworkers for lunch. It is my birthday, so they thought they would treat me.Well, we get there and ask for seating for five. We were seated promptly. No menus. Asked for menus.Still did not get them. Went to the front and grabbed some ourselves.The waitress, Mariah, had a very poor attitude from the get go, and throughout our entire visit.One member of our party asked for a fork, and when Mariah brought us our drinks and soups, the member in our party reminded her of the fork.She snapped at her and said, \"Ok, I wrote it down and did not forget, so I am going to get it for you in a minute.\" The tone was completely uncalled for and harsh. Mariah had not taken our order yet, so some other gentleman started taking our orders. They were submitted to the kitchen.Our food came out. The food itself was not bad, but nothing spectacular. I ordered the Chef's Choice sushi special and it came with two sushi rolls, a salad, and two slivers of fish with rice. Overall, a filling meal.Because it was my birthday, the same person who requested a fork was paying for my meal, but had to leave early to get back to work. She asked Mariah to pack up her food to go. Mariah took the plate away, and did not come back for several minutes. I suspected she probably threw the plate away. Well, we decided to inquire about the whereabouts of the leftovers, and Mariah snapped by saying, \"Ok, there were some vegetables and maybe some rice left, I don't understand what the issue here is.\" Uhm, excuse me?! A customer asks for their food to go - what difference does it make? Since when does a waitress get to decide who or what takes their food home? Anyway, we \u00a0let her know that there were leftovers and that the member of our party requested to take this food home. This is where it gets fun - Mariah took her round plastic tray, cringed her teeth, and DROPPED it on the counter. The tray wobbled before coming to a rest. Mariah said, \"Ok FINE. I'll go in the back and we will throw some rice and vegetables into a box - for your FRIEND!\" I was obviously irate at this point but decided to keep it together. What I wanted to do was get out of my seat and tell her off.I watched as she went into the kitchen, and told the cook our dilemma and heard him snap at her, \"THEY WANT THIS FOR FREE?\" There was some bickering going back and forth, which from a customer stand point, was not a good sign. Obviously now we have a waitress pissed and a chef that is pissed, all because Mariah was having a bad day and not comprehending basic direction.We started to complain out loud and were very clearly displeased, but no one approached us to find out what was wrong or to apologize. I would expect this scenario in a customer service training video on what *not* to do around a customer, or maybe on a Saturday Night Live/MAD TV sketch comedy show, but not in real life. Was the food spit in? I don't know. Dropped on the floor? I wouldn't be surprised. Again, I don't know if Mariah was having a bad day, or if she is just a horrible waitress, but this overall experience left me very disappointed."], ["Stephanie S.", "Sushi was bomb, got here in time for happy hour. The Susan roll is a must!!!! So is the miso soup, the most flavorful miso I've ever had. And the teriyaki chicken portion was huge, and really sweet and smoky. \u00a0So why the missing star? Well the restaurant smelled like urine, which is not an appetizing smell for me personally. Also, the rolls were pricey! $15 for an 8 piece roll is one of the priciest rolls I've ever gotten. Oh well, you get what you pay for. Most of the time...."], ["Ed P.", "The sushi was above average and the portion sizes were large, but frankly it was on the expensive side for what they give you.

I don't think they have them on their regular menu - only for Happy Hours. Also, great deals during Happy Hours for drinks!I also ordered the Double-T Roll (Sushi Masters Event Roll). Really interesting combination of usual seafoody-sushi ingredients (includes Tuna, Crab, Avocado) rolled in an egg roll wrap. The texture of the wrap was similar to eating a Chinese egg roll. The added teriyaki and spicy cream sauce saturated the dish with some sweetness and savoriness. The food was also presented elegantly and with obious attention to details. Definitely something to try! + ServiceGood service and friendly, attentive staff. Came by every now and then to ask us how we were doing, how the food was, and to fill our cups with water. Not disappointed at all."], ["Elly R.", "I come here quite often because it is right down the street from my work. It is great to grab a quick bite to eat. Some of the rolls can be expensive, but they are delicious. I usually always get the Coleen roll and some yummy miso soup. Some of the waitresses can be very inattentive sometimes which can be frustrating. Especially when eating here on a lunch break, so I would recommend sitting at the sushi bar for faster service.

Per our arrival, with both of us in gym clothes, we were greeted warmly and escorted to a spot at the sushi bar in front of a tv and two chefs. Throughout the evening I was impressed with the level of service from the chefs and FOH staff, as they walked well the fine line of attentive service and not being overly obtrusive (as it was obvious my friend and I were well engaged in conversation).We ordered some wings off of the happy hour menu, along with some Orion (one of my fave Japanese beers!), and even the wings were a nice surprise, coming out perfectly cooked, tender and juicy! The rest of the food we ordered from the bar: blue fin tuna, hamachi, ocean trout, lobster hand roll, spicy scallop hand rolls, hotate, sake, aji, saba, oysters (kumamotos), etc. The firmness and flavor of the saba was GREAT, loved the lobster hand roll and the freshness of the oysters; the consistency of the rice was perfect (a detail often poorly executed) and the portions of fish were perfect.

Sushi houses were literally that, houses where a chef practiced his art. The sushi was fresh, made in front of you so you could watch the strong hands of the sushi master design the plate you would soon devour. These sushi houses were simple, comfortable and traditional. Now, I'm not saying I don't patronize the likes of restaurants like Mikuni or Nishiki--they're fun and the food's still good--but there's something to be said about the old world stylings of a place like Ju Hachi.At the corner of S and 17th, on the first floor of a flood-era Sacramento home, Ju Hachi is small, even quaint. The sushi bar is its highlight and a smattering of tables fill the rest of the restaurant's L-shaped floor plan. It's homey and welcoming and there's always a smiling server who will find you a table or a spot at the bar. The sushi is wonderful. Fresh, flavorful, tighly rolled and ranging from nigiri to specialty rolls. You can also get sashimi and, in the non-fish category, ramen, udon, tempura, katsu and teriyaki. Also notable is Ju Hachi's daily, all-day happy hour where you can gets bites like bbq ribs, chicken karage, small hand rolls and beer and sake for 2 to 5 dollars. I've never been disappointed with what this place has offered and it'll likely remain my favorite sushi house in town. Simple, comfortable and traditional is hard to beat."], ["Stephanie D.", "My cousin and I decided to try a place we'd never been for Ramen. I thought I knew exactly where it was since I'd passed by this place for many years. We walked in and there was only seating at the sushi bar, ordered 1 of 2 possible ramen options and some mixed tempura. I was a bit confused since I thought there would be more ramen options.The tempura had a nice, light batter on it and was quite tasty. The Ramen was very good with a lot of flavors. We enjoyed our meal and I realized mid-way through that this was not the place we had intended to go. The actual place was a new Ramen restaurant a block down the street and said \"RAMEN\" on the outside. Oh, well. I've still been meaning to try Ju Hachi anyway.The waitress was very helpful, nice, friendly, and answered all of my questions.

While the staff is friendly and pleasant, and I do really enjoy their spicy scallop hand roll and dynamite roll (basically a spicy tuna roll), they are a little on the pricy side. They used to have a happy hour menu with several of food and drink specials for all hours of business, but now it is limited to a few hours in the late afternoon Monday-Friday (I suppose it was inevitable that they would eventually conform to pretty much all other places that offer happy hour, as far as limiting the hours, lol). Luckily I can make it in during this time frame right after work and my dynamite roll is on it for $5 (as well as a small, hot sake for $3, if I'm so inclined)! :)Overall, I'm not too impressed with this place but it will do as a conveniently located sushi fix."], ["Carol P.", "I may have found my new sushi spot! \u00a0Ju Hachi is small, homey, casual, and comfy. \u00a0Food is fresh and delicious, albeit on the pricier side (every roll I was interested in was $14 or $16). \u00a0They start you off with a little cucumber salad that is seasoned with the right amount of rice vinegar and sweetness, and the cucumber slices still had a good crunch to them, implying freshness. \u00a0I asked for miso, and that too was just the right amount of saltiness, with tiny cubes of firm tofu and thinly sliced green onion, served hot. \u00a0We ordered the mixed tempura, which I think our server forgot about. \u00a0She had to look at our order when we asked about it, then brought it out after our sushi rolls came to the table. \u00a0The tempura was slightly greasy but still tasted good and the veggies held up well in the panko batter. \u00a0My friend had the California Roll and I had the Shelley Roll. \u00a0California Roll is too standard and boring for my sushi taste, but it was still fresh and light, good for those non-adventurous palettes. \u00a0My Shelley roll on the other hand was a beautiful and scrumptious combo of deep fried shrimp, snow crab, avocado, masago, and garlic cream sauce. \u00a0All that, yet it still managed to taste light and fresh, without being overly sauced (like my favorite Mikuni rolls). \u00a0I left feeling full and satisfied. \u00a0This is a great neighborhood spot to fill your sushi needs without all the hoopla of other midtown joints. \u00a0Grab a Groupon and support the best little Japanese restaurant in town!"], ["J T.", "Great chicken katsu. California roll was ok."], ["Carol M.", "Came here for lunch and had some sushi. It was okay, I've had better but it's down the street from my job so I'll try again. Nice people fast service though."]], "Banzai Sushi": [["Ally H.", "I'm a terrible reviewer for the sushi. I do not eat fish regularly because I'm not fond of the taste. However, I did try two appetizers. One had salmon sashimi on a bed of guacamole; the other was tuna in a spicier sauce. I liked the guacamole better than the salmon, which seemed to be flavorless and just slimey. The tuna tasted fine, but I feel like it would've tasted better with the usual soy sauce and wasabi combo. For dinner, I had the curry ramen with an egg. I am a ramen fiend, but I don't think I'm too hard to please. This ramen though was probably the worst curry ramen I've had, although it is definitely not the absolute worst ramen in general. The curry broth wasn't broth-y at all; in fact, it was straight curry - thick, bland, and only had meat and onions in it. It made it really hard to eat the noodles and I was full before I made it even halfway through. The worst feeling is being full of food that you aren't even satisfied with and that's exactly what happened to me. The ramen was somewhat salvaged by the egg, though. The egg was soft-boiled, runny on the inside, and flavorful on the out. The menu has a large variety of options including donburi bowls, bento boxes, ramen, udon, soba, and sushi rolls. The prices are good. Maybe it was just my dish that night, but everyone else seemed to enjoy their normal shoyu ramens and bento boxes. I think I would revisit this place in the future, but order something different. Above all, this place has fantastic service. We called ahead of time for a party of 7 and they were able to reserve a table and quickly seat us when we arrived. They always made sure our drinks were full and that we were happy with our food. They were also quick to serve us. I believe customer plays a large role in the experience you have at a restaurant and this place definitely has it!For now, I'd recommend it. Just don't order the curry ramen. (: Good luck!"], ["Felecia F.", "This is a great sushi place located in the pocket greenhaven area, where if you don't know about it you'll miss it.

I'm very partial to anything spicy and this place has a large selection for those who can take the heat. I always find myself ordering the kinky role mostly because this roll really fits in with great flavor, heat and texture, it's topped with panko!! So good!!!

Yay, a rare find these days!And to top it off, the atmosphere was excellent, with the friendly crew really adding to it. Tip: When you ask about something, listen to the waitress. LOL.

You know someone favorite when the wait staff is knows my Aunty by name. LOL...Just shows that since not in the city city they appreciate their loyal customers. The first time came for diner went with bento box. Two item bento box. Teriyaki Chicken and Tempura. Gyoza. Talk about hearty box. Get decent portion all around in every compartment of the box. Not single component that did not enjoy. The basic cabbage salad with the dressing was delicious! Since yelpers raving about the spicy killer roll. I ordered one. It was solid speciality roll. Not as hot compare to the rave reviews. Second visit went with the beef yakisoba. I had craving for noodles. Again nice size portion so not going leave hungry. I really enjoyed is the amount of vegetables and nice assortments not just one or two kinds, The noodles cooking on point. The sauce was delicious. We went HH so went with couple of hand rolls. I ordered the spicy tuna and my Aunty order salmon roll. My roll was awesome plus again gave nice portion of tuna in hand roll. It was overflowing start and had tuna till the last bite. The quality of fish was good. The HH menu nice selection. Not just couple basic sushi but really half of the full menu on it. They have full section of ramen. I need try my next visit. The service without doubt five stars. Talk about truly never judge book by its cover. Banzai Sushi it literally in run down or say old looking tiny shopping area. Other restaurant around bakery, Chinese place, and discount grocery store or something. It literally right off one of the exit on one of the major interstate. I have no idea since visitor.

My favorite, though, had to be their flavored soju! So easy to drink and gets the job done. \u00a0My second visit was just a couple nights ago and we ordered some fresh oysters with uni, grilled calamari and pepperfin among other items. I definitely recommend the grilled calamari over the fried calamari! \u00a0Every dish was fresh, tasty and presented nicely. This time, instead of the flavored soju, we stuck with sake.

After they changed management/ownership last year, I noticed right away the quality of the fish has improved by leaps and bounds. The fish is fresh and portions are generous. The dinner Chirashi is bountiful and a work of art! The kids love the kaarage chicken and zaru soba. My wife loves the rolls. \u00a0Ramen is not their specialty so I'd stick with the sushi.

Will def be back to try some more rolls!"], ["Mandy H.", "With whispers around town that Banzai was under new ownership, I decided to give it a go. \u00a0I've never had a terrible experience here, regardless of what management it was under. The food is always pretty standard but never over the top. Service is usually a bit above average. Staff members are always friendly and attentive. The complimentary miso soup was too salty. However, they do provide a generous amount of tofu, which is great. We did the 2 for $40 deal. This includes an appetizer, two sushi rolls, an entree, and mochi ice cream. It is a pretty generous amount of food for the price. Everything tasted okay. The BBQ albacore was unevenly cooked and the cut on each piece were too large. They should consider cutting the current size of the pieces in half. The cook on it was incredibly uneven. One side would be well done, while the other side was medium rare. The sushi was drenched in a sauce, making the roll to mushy. \u00a0Much like the sushi, the sesame chicken was also soggy, due to the over use of sauce. The mochi ice cream was nothing you wouldn't expect already. Although, the mochi came out pretty melted when it arrived at the table, perhaps it was sitting out for too long. Bottom line, I wouldn't go out of my way to return, but if I was in the neighborhood and had a craving for sushi, I wouldn't be opposed to returning."], ["A B.", "Great food and customer service.

A few complaints I've seen from other reviewers is the service. Our service was okay, it could of been better but the food definitely made up for it. The appetizers were good (my favorites were the hana hamachi and banzai chips), the sushi rolls we asked for were all unique since we asked the sushi chefs to surprise us, but one of my favorite dishes was the cold ramen.Not sure how great the old management was but the new ones did a good job while we were there. Also, it wasn't as busy while we were there but definitely picked up at the end of our meal. I'm sure they will get all the little kinks out.Few pluses are the beers on tap, two TVs for sports, HH everyday from 2-5pm and the great selection of sake!

I came here with a large crowd (15+ people), few friends (2-3 people) and take-outs in the past 6 months. Food: Banzai Chips is still my favorite. It gives a fresh and lightness to my taste buds. I also enjoy Hiyashi Chuka a lot, it's simply cold noodles with dipping sauce and serves with shrimp, vegetables and etc. I have no idea how Banzai creates the sauce because I love it so much and I'm usually not a huge sauce person. It's perfect for summer or a day when you desire to get some light/non-greasy food. I love the rolls. As I mentioned in my last review, I will try to get different rolls in the future... and I lost counts on the rolls. However there's one I really like and it's not on the menu -- Banzai Roll. It has everything I like in ONE ROLL: tempura shrimp, crab salad, salmon... and lemon! Oh. Me. God. Adding lemon to the roll is a genius move. It balanced the roll so well with the citrus taste. One thing I noticed is that a lot of restaurants have one tempura shrimp in one roll, Banzai on the other hand, generously put in TWO TEMPURA SHRIMPS in one roll. This is pretty self-explanatory, right? I pay the same price and double the experience. BAM.Service: I love the service in Banzai. They always greet their customers as an old friend with a warm and friendly smile. They are so patient to explain/answer any questions and try to make a great experience to us. How many times that you've been to a restaurant and the server forgot to add more water/tea? Servers in Banzai never \u00a0forget even if they are super busy with other customers. That's some consideration and it's definitely a plus to me. I'm so glad to see Banzai doing better and better. I appreciate the new management trying to bring the best to the neighborhood and I'm really excited to see what they will bring to the restaurant. 5 stars with no doubts."], ["Rori A.", "The new owners are killing it at Banzai! They say they previously worked at a high-end place I won't name here - and it shows. We did a sake flight and chef's choice rolls, and were treated to sushi that had other diners at the sushi bar envious. Let your sushi chef know what kind of fish and flavored you like and prepare to be impressed. Lots of great sake selection, and the ramen is now on par with some of the addictive ramen houses downtown. Welcome to the Pocket, new owners! So glad you guys are here."], ["Mike W.", "Pocket area Sushi at its finest. Unparalleled presentation that will leave your taste buds yearning for more. Definitely one of my favorite spots.

The inside is trendy, low lighting with big screen TVs. Not too many people were in for a Saturday afternoon. I really felt like munching on sushi so we ordered a roll. My bf wanted ramen so he got that and I got 2 other hand rolls. Kind of disappointed in the sushi. The salmon skin hand roll I got was mushy. The wasn't crispy like it normally was. The spicy scallop only contained 2 tiny pieces of scallop. The larger roll I got was nothing memorable. :(The ramen!! It was sooooooooooo good! The flavor was really tasty. It was something with pork, veggies, and mushrooms. I think if I ever came back it would be for the ramen and nothing else. Yup."], ["Lauretta C.", "Excellent customer service.

As a born-and-raised San Franciscan, my standards are quite high when it comes to eateries, fine dining, and of course... sushi. In a previous review, I stated that good sushi is hard to find in Sacramento. Well, fear no more because I have found my savior... my safe haven for fresh, delicious sushi!My fellow Yelper Kim C. recommended I come by Banzai and sit at the sushi bar to get the full experience of the place. At first, I was skeptical. The drive was long for me and when I arrived, the plaza didn't exactly look stellar. However, Banzai is what you call a HIDDEN GEM. Upon entering, you're immediately greeted by the staff at the sushi bar. As I sat down, I was immediately offered a beer and given a menu by Chef Raymond. Now that's what I call service!Before this review becomes a short novel, here's the scope on the chow. The sushi is So. Freaking. Fresh! I had about 5 plates of their unique sushi dishes and loved each one (minus the monkfish but that's because I don't like it in general haha). You don't even have to know what to order. Just let the chef know what you like to eat and they'll be more than happy to prepare something special for you! All the dishes I tried were definitely unique and not something you can order at most places. In addition, the chefs put so much care into preparing the sushi you can practically taste their passion! (lol I'm cheesy) The BBQ Albacore was delicious and spicy. The white albacore drizzled with truffle oil was divine. I'm not sure when they'll offer this but when you see it, you HAVE to order the Seafood Ceviche. It's light, refreshing, with delicious morsels of shrimp, salmon, and scallops. Lastly, I had a chance to try their sesame creme brulee - something you don't normally get to try very often. Throughout the night I experienced excellent service from all the chefs at the bar - they're all super friendly and they love to joke with their regulars from what I observed. To my fellow foodies in the Sacramento area, I would highly recommend you stop by this little hidden gem. With my five thumbs up for this place, you KNOW I'm speaking the truth =P"], ["Joe R.", "So I decided to visit this place even though it was pretty far from me because a friend of mine referred it. I must admit, I have pretty high standards for sushi, since I been in the sushi business since 2006. I came in and first noticed it was a little bit on the smaller side compared to places like Sapporo or Mikuni. I decided to be positive about it and assume the quality of food must be pretty decent. I started off simple, a sushi plate of mixed fish. I figured if a place has good tasting nigiri, the rolls will be pretty good as well. I received some pretty good size slices. Fish was pretty fresh and some would melt in your mouth. I was given a free sample of some toro marinated with what tasted like garlic and lemon stuff. It was pretty good and impressive. Moving on to a roll, I was made a chef special. Im not a big fan of sauces so I was pleased to have a good tasting roll not drenched in mayonnaise. The highlight of the night was the staff and owners. They are very welcoming, friendly and seem like they are having a good time. I ended up staying roughly two hours just drinking with friends and talking to the staff. Its more than just a restaurant. It is a place to feel welcomed and enjoy a good time.

They have really upgraded the place since I first came here. Very modern and sleek. However, the bathrooms are never clean which is a big no no for me. FOOD: The sushi is alright...I feel like the more popular this place got the more the sushi went down hill. I always get the Fair Oaks roll...it is a good basic roll (I don't mess with the raw stuff). My fiance always gets the Teryaki chicken he said the meat is really fatty. Their plum wine is really good. They never have gluten free soy sauce...like come on now its 2015 everyone is gluten free get with the program. SERVICE: This is why they get two stars. The staff here is really rude. They rush you in and out. They pretty much basically come to your table and ask you if you are done. If you say no they give you the side eye. They do not give you any time to order. They barely take your order right bc they are in such a rush to get to the next table. Yes i understand that you guys are busy but if you continue to treat your customers like crap you won't have any customers to make the place busy. Overall, this place in my opinion has went down the drain and I rather pay full price at Mikunis then deal with the rude staff here. I will only be coming back if I am desperate (they stay open later then most places) or someone else requests we come here.

The spicy edamame is the best I've had anywhere. The sushi is always fresh. Some of my favorites are the orange blossom, lucky #7, the howe, rainbow roll, etc. They also have a vegetarian section with a vegan roll that is very good. :)I recommend this place to my friends all the time."], ["Anum A.", "Arigato is definitely one of my favorite places for sushi when I'm in the Arden area.

I really like coming here largely for how nice the interior is. However, the service is usually okay. Nothing special.The sushi rolls are great! I like a variety of things but mostly my favorites are rolls with tempura shrimp. On my last visit I had the \u00a0Lucky 7 and the Sexy rolls. The sexy roll is so delicious!

I don't have much to complain about, to be honest! One of my favorite spots."], ["Kelly D.", "I come to Arigato regularly with my girlfriends. The restaurant is open late and the rolls are cheap! My review isn't necessarily on a single visit but my overall experience itself. Food: The rolls are cheap! Usually under $10 for a roll that's average sized (about 8 pieces). I don't usually order anything other than sushi, but my friend and I return often and they order sashimi and I haven't heard any complaints. The sushi is good for the price, but I've had better. The rolls also come out inconsistently. A roll I order almost every time is the lion king and it always comes out a little different. I've also received rolls where the tempura shrimp tasted a little stale and rolls that're a little soggy on the bottom. On the positive end, I've ordered rolls that're perfection as well. It just all depends on the sushi chef.Atmosphere: The place is usually busy and kind of loud. I wouldn't recommend big groups here because the restaurant is on the smaller end but they can fit groups along the walls.Customer service: The customer service depends on the day. I've had service where I barely got checked in on and my waters stayed empty and other days where we got great service. On busy days, I can understand not getting as thorough of service but it seems like even on a weekday, the service is a little slow. If you were on a time crunch, I'd make sure to call the servers over yourself. Cleanliness: Average. No complains. Food preparation time: Baked rolls (like the lion king) usually take some time. However on average, the rolls come out in about 10 minutes. On busy days, it can take up to half an hour for your food to come out.Overall: I'll continue returning because the sushi is good and the prices are cheap, but I wouldn't call this a great restaurant. It's all pretty average."], ["Jessica B.", "Pretty decent spot. Came for lunch on a weekday and it was surprisingly really crowded! They had a special where it was 50% off the 'special' rolls, which is a good deal because the rolls original prices are kind of pricey in my opinion. The rolls are on the smaller side, but taste pretty good. Got the yummy yummy and the lion king and wasn't disappointed. Love the atmosphere here!"], ["Liana B.", "I'm not ashamed to admit that Arigatos is the restaurant that made me fall in love with sushi. I used to frequent this place about once a week. I loved the atmosphere and I thought the sushi was delicious. This was before I began to notice that the service sucked, the rolls were fairly small, and before I discovered the other sushi restaurants within the vicinity. As a result, I've only been here a handful of times in the past two years. My last visit, however, pleasantly surprised me. Due to Arigatos' popularity, they've hired more people who actually know the definition of customer service. Also, the rolls were much bigger than I had remembered! I'm not sure if I just came on a good day or if Arigatos has really stepped up their game, but I'll definitely be more open to coming here more often now.

The waitresses and waiters were friendly but they also seem pretty busy (so don't expect a 5-star service). They also kept rushing us to order in the beginning.As for the food, we ordered some ramen bowls (House Ramen & Kakuni Ramen), Kansai roll (their biggest roll) and the Pepperfin. The ramen was pretty good, although the broth started to get a little salty towards the end. I got the House Ramen. The char-su was thicker than most ramen places. I also appreciate that it was not as fatty as other places. The Kansai roll was really big and had unagi (eel), on top, which I liked. They don't seem to be too stingy with the amount of fish on top so that's a plus. Nothing too special about the taste of it, but I would still recommend it.The Pepperfin was a carpaccio/sashimi type of dish. It comes with jalapeno slices on top that gives it a good kick when eaten together. The fish by itself was also very fresh and the flavoring of the sauce (sesame oil & soy sauce mix?) made this very satisfying. If I come here again, I would definitely try out their other sashimi dishes!Overall, I think this place is a 3.5, but since the sushi roll was pretty impressive and their pricing is good, I'll round up :) Would come here again to try the other rolls & ramen!"], ["Sarah C.", "A little in the middle of no where.

Still in the search for the perfect bowl of ramen but I will be coming back here within the next three years."], ["Saul M.", "Pretty cool new find!I went to check out this place because of the good reviews from fellow Yelpers and I have to say, I was not let down as I was with the Melting Pot. PROS:SUSHI ROLL: I ordered the Hornet roll which consisted of shrimp tempura, avocado, along with a couple sauces that quite frankly, I have no idea what they were, but they were delicious! The crunchiness from the tempura and the smoothness of the sauces yielded a roll that satisfied my taste buds. I will probably go back and order like 3 of these bad boys. RAMEN: I ordered the Spicy Tan Tan Men sans menma and it was pretty good. While I can't say it was the best I've ever had, it was definitely up there on my list. The ground beef has a cool way of getting tangled up in the ramen so its a nice surprise to bite into. The broth itself was a little on the bland side though. I was hoping they had Sriracha to go along with it, maybe it needed a little more spice? Not sure, overall I was pleased but there is room for improvement with their recipe. CONS: PARKING: It sucks! There are only a few spots (maybe 10 total) to be shared between Wing Stop, Kansai, and Starbucks!! What are they thinking?? It took a while to wait for a spot to open up because I didn't feel like getting my car broken into. I would have had to park down the street where the lighting was essentially non-existent...I would've been asking for it! DRINK REFILL: Again, this was non-existent. You pay $1.50 for a canned soda and of course there are no refills to go with it. I mean come on!! This is America! Land of the free refills!!CONSENSUS:Give it a try! I will definitely be going back.

Well, I knew I didn't have any fried components, but too be honest it was worth the wait. The sushi was light and full of balanced flavor. Inside the sushi was daikon radish and grilled shitaki mushrooms. On top of the roll were avocado, grilled asparagus, thinly sliced daikon radish, and a spicy vegan mayo sauce.

Nor, will I tell any of my friends to go or when family comes into town I will not take them to Lou's. Too many times have a I gotten the worst service in Sacramento. Example 1: Lame policies such as having an entire party present to be seated.We came for a friends birthday, we had 8 people present. 2 stuck in traffic. They wouldn't seat us and we waited 30 minutes for our friends and then waited 45 minutes to be seated. They could have seated us and we would have bought plenty of appetizers and beer for while waiting for our friends in traffic. This would have boosted our bill with add-ons and would have lead to a higher gratuity to the bill. Instead we all left pissed because of waiting so long. Nobody drank that much because we were pissed, and gave an inadequate tip to the server. All of which would have been avoided. Example 2: being treated like a second rate citizenI live 2 blocks away and my fianc\u00e9e liked to think of this place as our spot when it first opened. We haven't always been able to go in and eat because of life. NEVER order from here for a Togo order. Unless, you like being treated like someone with leprosy.

Offer some water while I wait or if ask if I want to order a beer. Be friendly. These are all simple things. Do those and you'll get tipped regular 18%.I used to work in the food industry and you all are awful.Ever since Lou started stepped away from the restaurant to take time off, which is well deserved.

Lou's had me at \"hello!\" Next time I'm going to sit at the bar. Made a mistake sitting on the patio in the corner. There's a table, the third ugly stepsister table that sits behind the large swinging door and under an orange tree. It looks okay, until you sit down and notice it's missing an umbrella, and it's weebly wobbling all over the place. Then you move it over two inches and the waitress comes out and moves it back to the precarious position it was originally in. Anyway, don't sit there - sit at the other two tables. Needless to say we moved over as soon as a previous diner had left and we saw that no one was ahead of us waiting. So, I ordered to pot stickers, and a spicy tuna roll. Everything was extremely fresh. The gyoza was not the typical pork, it was a seafood mix. The chili oil dipping sauce was amazing. My spicy tuna roll was perfect. The fish tasted really fresh. I wish sushi places would make little tiny rolls so those of us who can't, erm, figure out how to get our mouths around big pieces, could eat them without embarrassment. Personal problem, I know.

B loved his Daft Punk roll so much that he didn't leave a piece for me to sample! Harumph. Oh well, it looked pretty. Haha.The only downside I've seen so far is that Lou's is a small restaurant and it's popular, so it gets packed quickly and often. Other than that the service is great, the food is amazing and the prices aren't too bad. (Oh and random props to the waitress who was pouring a table's untouched water onto the tree outside.

Chef Lou keeps the ball rolling, while keeping up with the latest bacon trend and maintaining high standards of traditional sashimi. Our latest visit we were focused on sashimi but the Bacon Boomers were calling us. Bacon Boomers are crimini mushroom caps filled with a smokey bacon, breaded then deep fried. Served with a creamy sauce, these will be one of our regular appetizers.  \u00a0We ordered $50 sashimi for two \"omakase\"...I'll leave it to you. Chef Lou presented us with not only a large variety sashimi and cooked octopus but mixed them with a wide range of compliments, ranging from sweet, spicy, and the nice clean taste of green onion.  \u00a0The following is very strong noted by the large amount of takeouts seen during our visit. Since the dining area is very small, there is patio seating also.  \u00a0Parking is limited to street parking only but plentiful on the weekends at the park across the street.  \u00a0We did have a some server / communication issues on two visit but these \"growing pains\" we're quickly addressed and corrected.  \u00a0Raw or cooked this is one of the top sushi restaurants in Northern California."], ["Kristal A.", "The server is very nice, the place is very quaint. \u00a0The owner is behind the sushi bar hard at work.I am a huge sushi fan, however I love the purest sushi itself, not necessarily the rolls and the sauces. \u00a0I typically order the Chirashi dinner, and my usual taste test would be either Tekka maki or negihama. \u00a0The negihama while not inedible, it was not phenomenal either in freshness or texture. \u00a0In another roll the tuna (maguro) was not the bright deep red I was expecting, it was a pale red, not quite the pink color you would see at the grocery store, brighter, but not the deep red I've seen at other restaurants. \u00a0It is the rolls' tasty sauces and spice that make the flavor of the rolls great. \u00a0Unfortunately the sauces simply mask the lack of freshness I demand with my sushi.While the sauces in their rolls are wonderful, I don't think I will return since I have other sushi restaurants that I frequent and are much closer that meet my demand for fresh sushi grade fish due to the fact that I primarily eat sashimi."], ["L M.", "I've tried a lot of sushi in Sacramento, this is by far the best place -- no question. The quality is far beyond that of which I have experienced in other establishments. The customer service has always been nothing short of superb, and the atmosphere is quaint and inviting. To clarify, what I mean by quaint is pretty small. It's definitely a cozy little place, and due to its popularity you may want to avoid the busy times. I generally like to make it in for happy hour when I can to avoid the crowded little spot and sometimes long wait. This place is definitely worth a try, you'll be hooked! They're certainly doing it right."], ["Jeff P.", "I see a few bad reviews and all I can say is they are complete BS. I'm guessing they are from a competitor or someone who has a personal grudge against the owner. I've been to almost every sushi place in Sacramento over the past 10 years and I can easily say that I can't remember liking a sushi place as much as I like Lou's Sushi. The specials are original and inventive and the entire menu uses high quality fish and other ingredients, are consistently prepared, and are delicious! The Simple Simon and 6 Item rolls are a couple of my favorites. The oysters on the half shell are the best I've had at any sushi restaurant I've been, anywhere! Sushi places are notorious for serving tiny oysters buried in a bunch of sauce and other crap that just masks the flavor of the main thing you're paying for... Not true at Lou's. They serve actual small to medium sized oysters that rival those you would normally get at an oyster bar, and for only $1.50 during happy hour! Can't recommend this place enough and every person I've sent there has felt the same. Try it. You won't be disappointed.My only complaint is that they don't deliver"], ["Kim W.", "Something in the sauce is real special because I'm allergic to it. We brought our food home. Now I'm on Benadryl and itching all over. My partner doesn't like the mayo taste.,this review is on the special shrimp. I'll just say, we won't be back. Y'all fans can have it.

Now, keep in mind, I'm not really a sushi person...gotta \"be in the mood\" for it, and then it's not guarantted I\"m gonna eat that much sushi. I needn't have worried; I've found my new sushi nirvana place!One sushi roll that I will ALWAYS come back for: and damn if I can remember its name! Zig Zag roll? Soft shell crab with avocadoa and mayo...oh my friggin' god! Plowed through one with Holly, and ordered a second one that disappeared almost as quickly. I LOVE.THIS.ROLL! Which, again, is saying a lot because I'm not a sushi-hound at all. I will always come back for that roll. All for me. Not sharing. Also delicious? Everything! Hubby and Brian plowed through whatever Lou was whipping up for them; salmon carpaccio, four different rolls, whole fried shrimp with their beady eyes looking up at you from the plate...it was practically endless. It's really nice sitting at the sushi bar and having Lou himself indulge you. Their BBQ albacore was delish, as was the myriad of Happy Hour items in which we indulged. Add to that HH prices for drinks (always gotta imbibe cider when it's available, so HELLO to my glasses of Two Rivers Pomegranate Cider that evening! Surprisingly, with all our noshing, we never tried the infamous seafood nachos! Definitely a reason to come back! Plus, between the four of us, we spent beaucoup bucks, so I'm SURE Lou would love to have our gang of four back in da house! Ok, so I guess we'll oblige...it was worth every penny, and there's sooooo much more to try."], ["Miss M.", "This is my new...well not so new favorite.Brussel sprouts and sushi, yes please.I'm a huge oyster fan and they are delicious here.

Located in downtown, this venue is fairly small with a seating capacity of less than 25. Great happy hour prices including $1.99 sake bombs & $1.50 oysters. My friend and I ordered other items from the regular menu and they tasted mediocre. The Fuji Roll was a bit overwhelming with too much sauce drizzled on top. The seafood nacho was good while the chips were still crunchy; but the chips eventually became soggy from the fish sitting on top which made the entree less enjoyable. Service was great. The waitresses came around often to replenish our drinks. Street parking is only available considering you're in downtown, but there were plenty of vacant spots available the evening I was there. Probably will be back for their sake bombs and oysters in the near future."], ["Jenni T.", "I went to Lou's Sushi with fellow Yelper Patrick M and my coworker Alesha for Lunch one Tuesday because they have Happy Hour all day on Tuesdays. Yes, ALL DAY HAPPY HOUR ON TUESDAYS!!! Need I say more?The inside of the restaurant is super duper small with only a small sushi bar and a handful of tables so get there early to make sure you get a seat! I had a Two Rivers Pomegranate Cider which was great, and I got the Veggie #1 Roll which was on the Happy Hour Menu. The roll consisted of avocado, cucumber and asparagus wrapped in a soy wrapper for $1.00 extra. It didn't come with any sauce or fancy garnishes so I requested a side of sauce so I would have some flavor in the roll and I'm glad I did! Otherwise it was rather plain. I'm interested in coming back for dinner because I saw some more Vegetarian Rolls on the dinner menu that looked more exciting and I'm interested in trying the Secret Tofu. Ill be back!"], ["Aman P.", "Love this place! Good spot for vegans and vegetarians! Zig zag roll is delicious."], ["Alice A.", "Please, please keep your vegan offerings! I loved sushi pre-vegan and I love it even more post-vegan! The rolls Lou's sushi offered during the October Vegan Chef Challenge was not your typical avocado roll. Far from standard sushi rolls, the rolls Lou crafted were like flavor explosions in your mouth! The clear star of the Vegan menu was the OMFG roll; spinach and oyster mushroom roll topped with avocado, grilled asparagus, silvered onions, and spicy garlic mayo. The texture, flavors, and quality was spot on. Even non-vegans would enjoy this wonderful creation. The brussels sprouts with garlic mayo was a delightful app to start with; crispy brussels with a savory dip sauce- you can not go wrong! The restaurant is a bit small, but the atmosphere is quite nice and friendly. You are greeted by the Chef himself as you enter and the waitress takes you to your table. They offer Two Rivers Cider on tap here which is a plus in my book. The food is top-notch and the service is outstanding. We did come across a error with our order but the chef and waitress quickly solved the issue and comp'd the mistake. Thank you Lou's for crafting such amazing plates of art. I would like to return to try more of what vegan dishes you have to offer- especially the popular mushroom bulgogi rice rolls I was unable to try last time. :)"], ["Lance K.", "Lou's can't get any better!!

Get the mountain if you like something more decadent."], ["Chris W.", "We decided to try Lou's Sushi because of the menu I saw for Sacramento Vegan Chef Challenge, but we will definitely be back with more friends if they keep rocking the vegan dishes! We started with spicy edamame and shishito peppers and goma-ae which were all wonderful, great flavors. Then we shared Vegan OMFG and Can You Dig It vegan rolls. High marks for both, but fried tempura in Can You Dig it was a little more \"wow.\" Then we got spider roll and Vegan #2. Presentation was beautiful and wait staff friendly and helpful. I had a Japanese IPA that was great with dinner. So far this is my favorite dinner in the Sacramento Vegan Chef Challenge. In fact, it's one of the best dinners I've had in Sacramento. Highly recommend!"], ["Crystal C.", "Lou's has been open and thriving for about a year now, and deserves an updated review. I visit rougly once a month (maybe twice) and continue to see additional menu items, small improvements, and a loyal and growing group of regulars. I am so happy to have a place like this in the neighborhood.Lou himself is funny, entertaining, approachable, and really knows his shit. At most sushi restaurants I don't like to sit at the bar, but at Lou's, it is a treat. The happy hours rock, the menu has improved and expanded to cover people who aren't into raw fish, and the prices are fair. The atmosphere is always energetic and comfortable, and I know before I walk in that I am going to have a good time and leave with a fully, happy fish-belly.I firmly believe that they have the best veggie tempura in town, and I really dig their other grilled and tempura items, particularly the shishito peppers and asparagus.My favorite menu items (so far) are: the BTS (like Ju Hachi's but with green onion - delicious!), the L-Train, Miso Chicken Wings, the BBQ Albacore, the OMFG roll, and an order of sashimi or nigiri of whatever Lou says is freshest (usually hamachi or tuna).I am not a fan of large or complicated rolls, so I haven't even tried some of the more popular items like the sea food nachos, mt. fuji roll, and the 6-item roll. They look good but a bit much for me personally. Some of my friends swear by them.I would love to see some kind of sashimi sampler on the menu, like you see at other restaurants. Like $20-25 and the chef picks an assortment of sashimi instead of having to order each type separately. I have been pleasantly surprised by Lou's creativity and what he has in stock, and I think a chef's choice sashimi platter would demonstrate that in yet another way.Also, while Lou himself is a total bad ass, some of his other employees don't quite have his magic. The rolls come out consistently good no matter who makes it, but I have noticed that items like the BTS and L-Train, if Lou doesn't make it the fish/asparagus is sliced a little too thick/long and while it is still good, it isn't as good. I realize they are learning and they have a tough act to follow.All in all, Lou's is a great neighborhood sushi shop!"], ["Jennifer S.", "Well, this place was absolutely delicious! Great service, delicious rolls, reasonable prices. Can't wait to go back!"], ["Jeremy D.", "Lou's has a small seating area so be cautious when deciding what time to eat there. \u00a0They have an equally small menu but it's sufficient.What Lou's does very well are there inventive rolls and yummy sauces. \u00a0He really knows what tastes great together. \u00a0I've tried various rolls including: Irish, Block, 3 Amigos, OMFG, etc.The ginger variant they have is soothing to me and I was able to eat the ginger like it were potato chips.Come here to eat mixed rolls, especially the non-raw. \u00a0If it's only raw that you crave for, then you might want to try somewhere else. \u00a0I can say this because I've had much fresher and higher quality grade sushi at other establishments.All in all, I will routinely come back because I work in the area and I like combo mixed non-raw sushi."], ["A M.", "We have been here 4 times. The first time was a great experience. Each time we return we are less and less impressed. We wanted to love Lou's, but after several visit, we give it a final review of 2 stars, and here's why:1. Over use of soy sauce reduction, seems like it finds its way on nearly every dish. It's burnt. It tastes like shit. It's not cool.2. Over use of mayonnaise. Every roll and every appetizer seems to be swimming in a mayonnaise based sauce. After a while, the mushy/greasy flavors become disgusting.3. No fish! You can easily spend $80 at this place and realize that you haven't received a damn bit of fish. Fried oyster mushrooms, fried tofu, secret fried shrimp, a few rolls off of their specials menu, some grilled ribs, and damn, not even the sushi rolls had fish in them. We ordered the top secret roll at the recommendation of the friendly waiter. It was filled with Wakame salad and mayo with fried crunchy bits. No fish. WTF?!It's like Panda Express makes American Chinese food... Lou's is white guy sushi. It was nifty at first. We won't be back."], ["MaryClaire M.", "Favorite Sushi restaurant in Sacramento.

Most yelp reviews rave about the sushi here, saying it's the \"best sushi in Sacramento\" but I think it might be more like the \"best sushi for people who don't know what authentic sushi is.\" I give this place credit for trying to be creative, but the quality of the sushi was not up to my standards. This place is definitely for those who are into the whole sushi \"trend.\"Parking:- Easily found parking on the streetService:- Good service. Lou was a friendly guy and the servers were pretty attentive. We went around 9pm on a Tuesday night and there was no wait.Food: - Tried the Midtown and \"Hi-ya\" rolls, which were happy hour specials (regular prices are a bit high). The rice was too mushy and was not prepared how sushi rice should be. The midtown was crunchy on the outside, but most of the roll was made of that mushy rice. Yuck. The Hi-ya contained the same mushy rice and the taste was okay. We also ordered the cream cheese wontons and spicy wings, both not Japanese dishes, but were alright. Ambience:- The restaurant is small but lively. The crowd varied from young people doing sake bombs to families enjoying a nice meal. Overall, I would most likely not waste my money here again. To those who are new to sushi, I'm sure this place will suffice."], ["Eric K.", "I went to Lou's on a Sunday around 7pm and it was packed and the wait was about 20 min to get a seat inside. \u00a0We would've sat outside but they aren't allowed to serve alcohol outside which is kind of lame. \u00a0Also it was ridiculously hot outside still anyways so we chose to sit and wait for a table inside.The food was absolutely delicious. \u00a0My friend got the tekka maki roll and I got the spicy tuna roll off the happy hour menu and it was also delicous. \u00a0The best things were the bbq albacore tuna and the seafood nachos. \u00a0Holy hell these seafood nachos can be a meal as you get a total of 6 and they are pretty big nachos. \u00a0 For $13 it seems pricey but it is definitely worth it compared to some other places seafood nachos as the portions for the seafood nachos here are perfect!Happy hour is all day on sunday and tuesday sooo good! \u00a0Cute little place that will be packed up quickly since it's so small. \u00a0Has a nice neighborhood feel to it."], ["Terra F.", "My hubby and I had a few of their gluten-free vegan rolls- yummers!

They are the only sushi place that I've gone to that had a very tasty vegan menu as well! One can only eat so many avocado rolls before getting sick of them...

The restaurant is on the smaller side and I wouldn't bring in a group bigger than 6 or you will probably have to wait! Seafood Nachos: We only ordered after seeing photos on Yelp and other customers ordering it, but it just wasn't very good to me! The whole dish had too much sauce on it (especially way too much sour cream/mayo sauce!) I liked the thin, crispy won ton chip and would've enjoyed the dish more if I could actually taste the Chef's choice! California Roll: Average, but good!Midtown: Panko crusted AND spicy tuna sushi roll sounded delicious and it delivered! Would order again.BTS: The albacore pieces tasted fresh and the sauce was light = perfect! We also ordered the \"secret shrimp\", but didn't get to try it because instead the waitress instead heard \"spicy tuna\" and brought out the wrong dish. It was an honest mistake though because secret shrimp and spicy tuna does sound sort've similar if you say it fast enough... I guess...Overall, I really liked the urban modern atmosphere of the place and the HH menu items were good. I'm interested in the other creative items they have on their menu (like the Mt. Fuji!)"], ["Kara S.", "Not only do we absolutely love the sushi, and not only do they have a terrific kids menu, and not only do they carry Two Rivers cider, and not only are their appetizers (the brussels sprouts, secret tofu, tempura, and shishito peppers are all aces), but their service is excellent. Whenever we come in, we are greeted warmly by all the staff (and we come bearing TWO kids to a small dining room, so we would understand if people weren't excited to see us). A few times, they've brought us a complimentary snack plate for the baby, with sliced strawberries, tofu, and edamame. And today, the server remembered us from a previous visit and had gathered (or remembered) that I was a vegetarian, so when we ordered something that didn't sound like it had meaty bits (bonito flakes) but did, she let us know and had already asked the kitchen to hold them. They've also given us water in a doubled plastic cup with a lid and straw for the baby, and put a rubber band on the chopsticks for our older child. In short, the food is terrific and so is the service. We love it at Lou's. (Particular shout-out to Christa the server, who is fantastic.)"], ["Shawn K.", "My favorite Sushi place in town!

Everything they serve up is like a more creative, improved version of your typical sushi roll from your typical sushi joint. At Lou's, they obviously take pride in serving quality eats. Yes, because they're small, service can be a bit slow depending on the night and you may have to wait for a table.

I took my daughter out for lunch, to meet up with her mom and some friends at Lou's Sushi. Should have turned around and left when we walked through the door and was not greeted. Once seated, the service was very slow even though it was not busy at all. They didn't have any high chair or booster chairs for my 3yr old daughter. While waiting for the food, my daughter was using her mom's phone to watch some kids music video (Frozen) and sang along. When the food finally arrived, it was not worth the wait. The sushi was wet and the fish was a little fishy. The plating and presentation was mediocre. Nothing about this place deserves the pricing they charged. It was a hole in the wall and not some fancy place in downtown. That being said, not even half way through our service, we were approached by the manager of the place and was told to tell my daughter to be quiet and turn down the phone music. I wouldn't have a problem with that if the place was a high end fancy quiet spot, instead it was only a casual lunch spot at best! The music at Lou's Sushi was louder than my daughter and the phone music. Lou's Sushi was pretty noisy with restaurant background music, other customer conversations, and the street noise! After that altercation, with only half of our food coming out after 30 minutes of placing our order, \u00a0we told the waitress to box the rest and asked for our tab.

Last time when I came here on a Tuesday, they were all sold out by 7 but this time I was so happy that they didn't run out ^.^ This place is really small. They only have about 12 tables, a sushi bar, and outdoor seating which includes about 3 tables. Definitely not great for big parties. When I arrived, all the tables were taken so my boyfriend and I sat at the sushi bar. We ordered oysters, the firecracker roll, the mermaid roll, and salmon nigiri. This was my first time having raw oysters (due to my bf's convincing) and they were good! I liked how the ponzu sauce and the siracha had a good balance to the oysters. The firecracker roll was spicy and delicious. It has tempura jalapenos inside and regular jalapenos on top. I wouldn't recommend this roll if you don't like spicy. But if you do, then it's a must try. The mermaid roll was also good. this roll had wakame (seaweed salad) and ikura (fish eggs) on top and was perfect. I felt that the firecracker and mermaid balanced each other out since the firecracker was so spicy lol. Lastly, the salmon nigiri was very fresh. Most salmon nigiris taste the same to me so this isn't anything too special. Service was excellent. The server grabbed our drinks and the sushi chef took care of our orders. The chef was so nice and accommodating. I loved the environment."], ["Carlos E.", "New to the area, started ordering take-out here for their vegan options. First time I ordered was great, they told me I could order any combo of veggies for $7 per roll. After that, the second time I ordered they charged me $8 per roll, the third time they charged me $9. I didn't say anything because although their service is bad, the sushi is decent and it's hard for us to find vegan-friendly sushi places around here. Today ordering the same rolls as always, I was charged $10 per roll. That was straight-up theft, so I spoke up and the guy said the chef told him to charge 10 cause they're \"custom\" rolls, to which I replied \"its just vegetables\", and he did nothing. Horrible service, and their sushi is definitely not good enough to come back again after being ripped off. Try Mikuni Sushi instead - they have a veggie sushi selection and much better service."], ["Jasmine C.", "If you want sushi that tastes horrible come here. That might sound like a bold remark but my group waited a long time to be served sushi with wet rice. The owner and waiters greeted everyone but my group. The service was terribly slow for it not being that busy. And for the price I would go to a more upscale restuarant that has quality food. Also we were asked if we ordered our food by a second waitress. So the waitress took her break right after we ordered without saying that someone would be replacing her. In my opinion, all around bad service. And if you have kids it would he smart for you to not bring them here. Lous doesn't even have high chairs so they don't cater to kids at all. My niece was with us and the owner only acknowledged us by asking us to keep her quiet. I think you could get better quality sushi elsewhere for a cheaper price."], ["Sara P.", "Lou's sushi has an amazing vegan menu! Any other sushi place has 1 or 2 things I can eat, which is always a bummer. You have to ask for the vegan menu and it doesn't list everything that they have online, so I pulled up the menu on my phone and mostly used that when ordering. The food is creative and tasty, with seasonal offerings such as shishito peppers. Everything is good and the service is very friendly."], ["Armine H.", "This place is just okay. I find it so funny how effective hype can be and cause people to lose their senses. This place is just okay.1) Parking is obviously inadequate/nonexistent.

I believe the word is \"courtesy\" or just plain \"giving a shi+.\"2) Happy hour prices do not apply to take out orders, but they won't tell you that over the phone when you order-- even when you ask them, \"you are still within happy hour time, right?\"3) Here are their prices for my order:Hi-Ya = 8.00Secret Shirmp = 10.50Philly Roll = 9.50Salmon Skin = 7.50Block Island = 11.00OMFG = 16.004) The salmon skin used in the Salmon Skin Roll tasted more like old oil as opposed to salmon skin.

The rest were just mediocre and not worth the inflated prices.They greeted me as I entered and said goodbye as I exited, but I'm not stupid.

The first time I went there we waited 45 minutes to get a table for 4 even though there were 2 tables (2 tops) that could've easily been put together. Instead we watched 2 couples walkin right in and get seated. The food was good but the service made the experience a bummer. The second time again we waited for about 45 minutes this time for a larger party so that's to be expected. However the waitress messed up 2 of our party's orders and when we brought it to her attention she blamed us, claiming both people ordered incorrectly. At the end of the meal she separated out check into 5 tickets without is asking. A little presumptuous. It was a birthday and I was paying so it made it super awkward. Everyone was a little bummed about Lou's that night. And the 3rd time, a complete nightmare in fact I'm writing this from my bed at 4am w cold sweats from food poisoning. I've been up all night losing it from every which way from the secret tofu and veggie zig zag roll. It's not even fish and I'm this sick. It was take out this time.

I noticed a sign on the door that said to wait to be seated, but the place was pretty packed and understaffed, so it took a moment before someone could come over.I decided to sit at the last available table on the patio because it was farther removed and seemed less hectic for a person dining alone than what appeared to be going on indoors. The inside of the restaurant seemed to be full of people in their 20s and 30s...many who looked like couples or were on dates.For dinner, I ordered the complimentary green tea and water as beverages. The green tea was good--how can you go wrong with free!? But the water tasted strange--like it needed to be purified or filtered because the taste was off. Weird.For food, I ordered the Miso Soup, Secret Tofu, and Veggie #1. The Miso Soup was average, the Secret Tofu had sort of a weird sauce, and the Veggie #1....that was tasty.

I heard that they recently went under new management and so my boyfriend and I decided to give them a second chance yesterday. The girls here are so sweet. Service was really great as the girls here are really attentive to our needs. We ordered the Bbq Albacore as an appetizer. My boyfriend ordered a chicken teri and salmon teri bento and I ordered the Koji roll and the Volcano roll. The Bbq Albacore was pretty good but it wasn't as saucy as other restaurants make it, so I had to ask for spicy mayo on the side. \u00a0I tried so hard to like my rolls but I really didn't. I ordered the Koji roll after someone posted it on yelp said it was the best roll they had so far and with a lot of fish. When it came out, it was huge! I definitely think what you get is well worth it for the price, but the roll in my opinion was too big to fit into my mouth! And the roll didn't have \u00a0much flavor to it. It lacked something but I'm not too sure what. The Volcano Roll I liked a little better, but it tasted like it was put together with random sauces that did not compliment each other well. My boyfriend said the bento wasn't too bad. Maybe I just ordered the wrong rolls, but last time my friend and I came here we weren't too fond of any of the rolls we ordered.

There is no one who greets you at the door to seat you..I honestly usually just walk past the host booth and seat myself at the sushi bar.

I flag down for my check and for them to actually come back and take my card after waiting an excessive amount of time.

I felt like reviewing because I notice a dramatic difference during the day/lunch when compared to the evening/dinner shifts (or particularly when Jennifer is not on/off shift). Visiting during the day is much more pleasant because Jennifer is there and she gives excellent service, she's always checking on us, and she's super friendly. Jennifer is very attentive and quick to serve all of her tables while still maintaining patience and seems to give you the attention you need for a pleasant dining experience. Jennifer also makes sure new customers have been greeted and seated in a timely manner. When we come in and Jennifer is not working we get stuck sitting at the doorway even when it's not busy, no eye contact or greetings from the other staff even when it is obviously not busy. During the evening shifts service can be slow and somewhat unresponsive. It can take forever to get our drink orders in, then somewhat slow to get our food. Even if it is pretty busy there seems to be enough staff to efficiently take and serve orders in an expedient manner. Maybe there is an unseen kitchen backup or shortage that floor customers cannot see. My other gripe is knowing that tips or gratuity are pooled and divided amongst all wait staff, and not given directly to your primary server. This discourages tipping because I do not want my tip disbursed to another server that has not given excellent service. I want my tip to go directly to my server (regardless of who it is, but because they have worked hard and give excellent service). Food quality is pretty good. Some dishes can be disappointing. Most dishes have been fine. The Lion King is very good. The Kimchi Fried Rice is pretty good as well. The Tuna Paradise is nothing but a plate of salty mush, you cannot taste the tuna at all. 5 stars for Jen3 stars for other times I know this seems like a biased review for Jennifer, but this is a very honest critique and observation based on all of my experiences here so far. I really hope and wish that Jennifer is acknowledged and compensated for her exemplary customer service skills."], ["Darci K.", "Free edamame for checking in!!

The atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice, filled with many trinkets and decorations. The sushi rolls are very presentable and well made. Came with some friends. We all ordered rolls. All rolls are 50% off which was nice, however, a common thing with all these sushi restaurants in the Sacramento area is the 50% off deals on rolls that are pricey to begin with, which sort of make you feel like it's a good deal. We ordered the Hulk, Princess, Sushi Hook, and Webster. The sauces used were the same but each roll had a little different ingredient to make them distinct but in the end, it all tasted similar for the most part. The service was excellent, the servers checked up on us multiple times and were attentive. Some things to note... I didn't realize they offer 1 order of edamame for free if you check-in on Yelp when visiting, which was awesome! Also, for bills of $10 or less, they charge a $0.50 fee."], ["Ariana V.", "This place is solid. They have a good variety of rolls, and they're half off. I think that seems to be a standard in Sacramento... except where I live... anyway, I digress.It's a great go-to place for the dressed up sushi roll fix. Of course, if you're looking for high quality stuff, this is not the place to go, but if you want something satisfying and within budget (for rolls), then this is your spot.You get free edamame with check in, which I should redeem one of these days because the cucumber-cabbage salad they give you is not my favorite. It's worth a shot if you're in the area."], ["Caressa Q.", "The Anna Roll is one of the best rolls here. The service here is fast too! The atmosphere is laid back and a good place to go with friends.

It was again rice covered with this mayonnaise sauce on top that the rice was like a paste. \u00a0 Not pleasant.after two bites I couldnt eat any more.If you are hungry, looking for something cheap and dont care about the actual taste or texture of the sushi..this is your place. If you have tasted good sushi..find anither place. Im sure there are better places in the area."], ["Luciano Z.", "I am very pleased with the sushi that lies within Sacramento and Sushi Hook is one of my favorites. The spacious restaurant is packed with Japanese decor, giving it a very authentic vibe, as well as having music and a generous amount of tv's for entertainment. Not your usual game day spot, but honestly why not? Luckily for us, the playoff game was on! For starters, they give you a free cucumber and cabbage salad, coated with a very nice ginger dressing. We even got free edamame for checking in with yelp! These as well were quite tasty, however I would have probably likes the spicy flavor a bit more for flavor purposes. For my main entree I ordered two rolls. One of my default rolls is the lion king, so I was obligated to order that. But to be different I also ordered the spicy dragon roll. Both rolls were packed with flavor and were cooked to perfection. If you like crab, you will definitely love the lion king, which is a baked roll. And if you're a fan of spicy tuna, the spicy dragon roll is such a good roll for that. They're also all fifty percent off the price on the menu!From friendly waiters, to a warm setting, and amazing food, sushi hook is the place to try."], ["Allison L.", "The food here is best described as bleehhhhh! I've been here twice now and can say I will not be returning. For 50% off sushi, I would much rather go to Arigato down the street. The sushi here has so much rice and the fish doesn't taste fresh. The sauces aren't good and leave a weird after taste in your mouth. The bento boxes take forever to come out and the food isn't even hot. How does that happen?! My pet peeve is when everyone's food doesn't come out at once. Two of us got sushi and had to wait for the two bento boxes to come out. They're overpriced as well. Service isn't amazing either. The last time our waiter spilled the tempura sauce into the salad and he didn't even offer to replace it. Mm nothing like WARM SALTY SALAD. The only good thing is that you get free edamame with check in."], ["Jeeno M.", "Probably one of the best sushi places in all of the Sacramento area. I go to school right down the street and have always lived (relatively) close by. I am glad that they switched places with the ramen and rice restaurant and got the bigger location. (Yes, I know that was hella days ago, but its something I really appreciate). I really enjoy pretty much everything that I have ordered here. I also like how late this place is open. At least midnight every night! Nothing better than getting off late at night and having great sushi!All of their rolls are half-priced but just because they cut the price in half, that doesn't mean they slack on the size of each of their rolls. Compared to arigatos further down Howe avenue, this place gives you a whole lot more. Sure, the ambiance of Arigato's is a little more exciting with their dim lighting and flashing lights, but that doesn't make any of the rolls bigger or taste better.This place just has so much to offer. I normally get their roll special which includes the chef's choice of a roll and appetizer, rice, your choice of chicken (teriyaki, spicy, or curry) and a few orange slices. Included with each meal is also a complementary salad. The dressing is so good! Anyways, a few other favorites of mine include the spicy crunch california, rock n' roll, crunch monkey, and their kimchi fried rice. Just always remember, that the roll prices are always half off, so don't freak out when you see the price is $14 when it is actually only $7. It's a good marketing technique that they have, and clearly, it works.Every time I have been here, the service has always been pretty good. I also never come during peak hours, or at least try not to, so I wouldn't see why my servers couldn't give me great service. Always great food served here. The sushi chefs are also really nice and enjoyable to talk to if you sit at the bar.Sushi is my favorite food and Sushi Hook is the reason why. I can never go wrong here. You best believe, I am (sushi) hooked!"], ["Lina T.", "Love this sushi restaurant! They have plenty of options to choose from and I usually get something on their secret menu & it's my all time favorite. It's called the Crack Cocaine roll and it's honestly one of my favorite sushi rolls! I would recommend anyone who comes here to order that roll. It's not on the menu, so just ask your server. \u00a0I've gotten udon here a couple of times and it's alright. The noodles are cooked perfectly but the broth could use a little more flavor. The staff was very friendly but we weren't greeted or seated when we got to the door. We were standing there waiting for someone for about 5-8 minutes. Can't remember our server's name but he was very friendly and helpful. The atmosphere was nice, and there's plenty of seating.

But today, we had the worst service. It wasnt a busy night, yet when we were waiting for a table the host asked us to sign up to be seated. When we finally got seated, we were totally neglected. Not given any water or menus. A few more groups came in and were seated, given menus, and water right away. Getting impatient, I had to go up to a group of the servers(who were standing around talking) and ask for some service.

I'd say it's good but not great which makes the difference between making a 4 and 5 star restaurant in my opinion. My go to is the sashimi combo with a spicy tuna roll or a Gail's Special and Candy Cane Roll. Thursdays-Saturdays they have $1 Sake bombs which are AMAZING and get the job done and compliments the food pretty well. It's definitely THE best \"half-off\" sushi spot in the area.If you are looking for a sushi fix, this is the place to go.

You will not be sorry."], ["Frank O.", "Came here with my dad and his Japanese wife for a Lunch. Setsu is from Japan and she is pretty critical of Sushi places so I like to take her to Japanese places. I have to say the food quality here is very good. Setsu agreed, she only said that the rice on the Nigiri is not what Japanese would expect, it was too clotted. I agreed. She had octopus, tuna and eel. All Nigiri, she liked it. I had the seared albacore, with just dabs of garlic sauce on it. The fish was excellent and not hidden by too much sauce, just the right amount. My dad ordered the Thai Carpaccio, it was Tilapia fish, but this was some really awesome Tilapia, and the dressing and mild peppers (*probably jalapeno), and lemongrass made this very tasty stuff.I would say the decor in general is pretty ho-hum and bit awkward, with a purple hue in the dining room and just some generalities of awkwardness you need to look beyond this, it's not trying to be Mikuni, but you get the original Sushi guy every time as well. The food quality and some generally very unique dishes such as the Jensai Ribs make this a repeat, rinse, and repeat again.Try it!"], ["Andrew F.", "First time here and loved this place! Got there an hour before closing but everyone was very kind and the food was great.

Would really prefer a bit more mood lighting in the evenings :)"], ["Tauhid C.", "I love coming here because they have happy hour prices for sushi and alcohol from 4 - 7:30 p.m. Trying to find a sushi place that has happy hour prices (besides Bento Box) AFTER 6 p.m. is tough, and the quality here is very much worth the price.If I ever crave sushi and want something better quality than Bento, this is definitely my go-to spot."], ["Derek L.", "First time here, very impressed with their menu for happy hour.

Wow, that is incredible.The bar area is also nice because it has a super chill and loungey feel to it.. especially on a Friday or Saturday night! Kick back relax, eat some sushi and cheers!!!

The restaurant is spacious and spread out with at least two bars. Big screen TVs for \u00a0Game 2 of the NBA Finals was on every TV screen. There wasn't a crowd so we were seated and served right away. Location, Service, and ambiance were all good. \u00a0I really wanted to like the place, but....Cons:The Sashimi wasn't fresh. Most of your senses can detect the fact that it was previously frozen. Just by looking at the fish you can tell by that the light red color and texture wise you can taste it. The sushi rolls were just ok. They were either to saucy or just had too much rice that you couldn't taste what was in/on top of the roll. When I think Sushi Restaurant I automatically think Fresh Fish, and if that factor (which is a major factor and practically in/on every menu item) isn't on point, then my personal experience is put off."], ["Brenda B.", "I was debating between a three and four star review ...

It was worth every dollar, and the amount you get for 20 bucks is more than worth it.

Not too much sauce drizzled on top, and the tempura shrimp wasn't soggy! -- Fried calamari -- Not too much batter caked on so you can actually taste the calamari! But not my personal favorite of the night. -- Mama's chicken wings --One of their specialties, and apparently it's a secret home recipe! Batter wasn't too thick, which made the wings really enjoyable. With the right amount of seasoning and spiciness to it :P-- Salmon (sake) nigiri --FRESH FRESH FRESH. AND THICK. That's what she said.-- Green tea ice cream --I think their ice cream is from Gunther's! Really rich in green tea flavors and the consistency was awesome.SERVICE/COMMENTS:Friendly, quick, and efficient! The atmosphere is also really chill, so definitely perfect for GNO or hanging out with your co-workers after work typ-a thing. Recommend, and will return!

Everything for only $5 each, yes, only FIVE DOLLARS.We started off with the Mama's Chicken Wings, which is the owner and her mom's own secret recipe. The wings are perfectly seasoned with a Cajun spices and fried to perfection. It came with 7 large meaty sized portions and is easily one of the best wings I've tasted. It's so good, no sauce is needed. \u00a0I highly recommend getting your hands on these!The Miso Fish and Chips is also a winner. It came with 2 pieces of beer battered white fish on a bed of house cut seasoned fries. The fish was so flaky and just melted in my mouth. The fries were super crispy on the outside, soft and airy on the inside. Yum!I am a big sushi lover so was excited to try their rolls. We had the Sactown roll which comes with deep fried shrimp, crab salad, topped with salmon, avocado, unagi sauce and spicy mayo.

The interior is great, very modern and the bar area is painted Kings purple which is awesome! I guess I know where I'll be watching games once the new season starts up. We opted to sit at the sushi bar area so we could catch the Giants game. Our sushi chef was great! Very friendly and skilled in his craft. Jensai has a wide assortment of dishes, from their house rolls to the more intermediate specialty rolls. Don't worry if you're not big on sushi they have bento box/rice plate entrees as well. We opted to go with Calamari as an appetizer which was practically a meal in itself. The Calamari was cooked to a perfect crisp and the basil dipping sauce made it that much better. For sushi I went with the Sac Town Roll and the Tune'em Up Roll, both of which were amazing! Each bite was savory and kept me wanting more. The service here is excellent! Always smiling and they provide such a friendly and welcoming environment. Tuyen is AMAZING! So friendly and attentive, she made sure our glasses were never empty and checked up on our party often.

My favorite roll off the special roll selection is the Bao Bao roll. Beware, \u00a0this roll is HUGE. Come hungry if you plan to order this roll. It's both flavorful and filling. \u00a0This place has the best happy hour in Midtown. \u00a0It lasts an entire 4.5 hours, from 2:30pm-7 (everyday!!). You have appetizers and rolls for only $5.

You get a full roll for the reduced price. \u00a0Sadly they only have one vegetarian roll on the happy hour menu. the green machine is still the second best of the veggie rolls. My top selection being the veggie dream. The ramen here is good for the bucks. I love the variations it comes with.

The location looks similar but nice improvements.Food: 3 StarsEveryone began ordering up everything on the HH menu which included wings, calamari, lettuce wraps, pork buns, a number of rolls and lots more. \u00a0As HH Queen I was busy socializing but I did munch on pork buns, pepperfin (which was not on HH menu and ended up being tuna) and the wings. \u00a0The pork buns were my favorite, sweet and savory. \u00a0Hubby loved the wings! \u00a0I did not end up trying the rolls because they were on the smaller side and very simple ingredients.Service: 5 StarsMany know customer service is a big thing for me. \u00a0Sai and his crew (though a bit under staffed) worked that room. \u00a0They smiled, explained, made expectations and overall did a wonderful job. \u00a0Drinks: 4 StarsThe HH menu reflects great drink options and great drink prices. \u00a0Not sure what is up with the different size Sake bombs but next time if I have a choice, LOL I will take the larger of the two, Thank you!Overall we had a wonderful time, and I think a successful UYE. \u00a0I think over time, more consistency, and maybe tweaking the recipes; this Sushi Joint could be Very popular. Thanks for everyone who came out, and special Thanks to Tuyen, Sai and the rest of the Jensai crew. Cheers!!!"], ["Topaz B.", "Love this place! I love how they have a great happy hour menu and time! The earliest happy hour I've seen around. I'mA huge sushi and sake bomb fan and I always want to go to this place to indulge.

Decor: Very clean, and spacious. There's a lot of room to hold a medium size dinner. I'm sure if you plan in advance you can book a larger area. The restaurant is basically separated in to an eating area and eating/bar area. Inside is very clean and I guess similar to Mikunis. Service: Our server Benneth was superb! he took our orders, offered suggestions when we couldn't decide on what to eat, and promptly brought out extra items like Yuzu sauce, extra ginger. I highly recommend seeing him or Tuyen next time you come here. Thanks for the excellent Service Benneth.Food: Food was tasty. We ordered the $55 Boat Dinner, which came with salad, gyoza, sexy angel, some other roll, sashimi, and nigiri. OHhh man this is a pretty good deal. There was enough food to feed 3 hungry guys. All the fish was fresh and smelled like how good fish is supposed to (like the ocean). Gyoza was nice and crunchy the Yuzu sauce with it was tasty aswell. But my favorite, and you're going to think I'm weird is the salad. The house dressing was fantastic I ate 3 servings. It's like a miso something/secret recipe. The ramen was ok. The broth was flavorful and the servings were very generous, but the noodles were not what I'm used to. At other ramen restaurants you'll have to pay a lot more for the extra that were included here. (so I'm a bit torn)Overall: This is an excellent place for sushi, I'm not sure why I haven't been here before, but I'm glad that we went. The food is tasty, but I don't think I would order ramen from here unless they change the noodles. The other food was great especially the salad."], ["Carol P.", "We walked into a beautiful, chic, and empty lounge/bar before 5pm to meet up with some fellow Yelpers for a Thursday happy hour. \u00a0I was really impressed with the new digs of the old Kamon Sushi, now Jensai. \u00a0Although their HH is from 2:30-7pm, I'm pretty sure we were the first ones there that day. \u00a0They turned on the lights, wiped the dust off the tables, and turned on the music as we took a seat in the back. \u00a0Right away I ordered crab cheese wontons, fried chicken wings, and calamari strips ($5 each during HH), and a \"Mamie Sister\" ($3 well HH drink). \u00a0I loved that the HH menu had a lot to choose from appetizers to sushi rolls. \u00a0On the back was a whole page listed of the \"well drinks\" offered for $3 and other HH drink specials. \u00a0I think one can get really f*cked up for cheap so designate a driver! The calamari strips were tempura battered and came out slightly oily and not very crispy. \u00a0The crab cheese wontons tasted like standard Chinese restaurant cream cheese filled fried wontons, served with sweet & sour dipping sauce. \u00a0I didn't detect much crab. \u00a0The winner was the chicken wings. \u00a0Deliciously seasoned with garlic and fried perfectly. \u00a0Tried a few of the HH sushi rolls. \u00a0Nothing was outstanding in taste, but I'd say they were a good bargain for $5. \u00a0Service was good, they had about 4 different servers/bartenders working hard to accommodate our group that eventually took up half the lounge area. \u00a0The only thing I didn't care for was the music they had piping in. \u00a0I think they should stick to one genre and one decade, or even one radio station. \u00a0Besides that, Jensai's cheap prices and hours will have me coming back for HH!"], ["Ed P.", "FULL DISCLOSURE: The wife and I only eat fish and veggies. No chicken/beef/pork, etc...GOOD: The service was great. Our server was attentive, extremely nice and I was never hungry or without water. The stuffed mushrooms ($5 for 5) were very tasty. Also, the happy hour drink prices are phenomenal. My beer came in a glass that was caked in ice, phenomenal way to enjoy a frosty beverage. Also, they have pickled wasabi, which a lot of places don't.BAD: The place smelled like old beer (maybe on the floor) when we walked in. The happy hour menu that everyone brags about was a complete waste of space. Little-to-no fish (I don't count spicy tuna or deep fried shrimp) in any of the rolls, so you're paying $5 for rice, some cheese and some veggies. I'd say they were worth exactly what we paid, and not a penny more. The yummy roll was as close to decent as it got. It was so plain, we just decided to splurge and order off the menu. The one roll we got (I think it's called the Spicy Angel) was slightly below average, and when you consider you paid full price, it was a total letdown. The fish was tasteless, ingredients were bland, and the rice was cooked like it was rolled for Safeway. I cannot believe that this place has 4.5 stars, there has to be some inflation going on here. I'm not surprised that the place was empty, and as much as I wanted to like this place, my 2 star rating says it all: \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"My favorite place for sushi is Akebono on Freeport, but really you could go to Mikuni, Bento Box, or Sushi Cafe and have a better meal - at least their happy hour prices include rolls with actual pieces of fish. The mere fact that I told you to go to Bento Box should be reason enough to stay away from this place.Oh, and a recommendation for the owners: please have low sodium soy sauce out and available (not on \"special order\"), and when someone asks you for more ginger, try to provide more than 5 shavings."], ["Jennifer N.", "Food: I came here for their happy hour where every food selection on the list is $5. Happy hour is 2:30 - 7:00 pm every day. - Crab Cheese Wonton: The cheese was flavored nicely. 4/5- Chicken Wings: This was my favorite of the night! Lots of flavor and cooked perfectly. 5/5- Deep Fried Gyoza: yummy, crunchy dumplings! 4/5- 16th Street Roll: cream cheese and avocado, topped with spicy tuna, unagi sauce, and spicy mayo sauce. 4/5- Philly Roll: cream cheese and cucumbers, topped with salmon and masag. 3/5- Yummie Roll: deep fried shrimp, crab salad, cream cheese, and avocado, topped with masago. 4/5Service: Fast and friendly. 4/5Final thoughts: All of the appetizers were really good and the rolls were okay. The rolls were worth $5 but I would not pay the full amount for them. They were all a little plain and the chef was a little heavy-handed on the cream cheese. I would definitely come back for their happy hour, 3 appetizers, 3 rolls, 2 large hot sake for about $50. What a steal!!"], ["Tania H.", "I've been wanting to try Jensai since I saw that it had replaced Kamon and I can say without a doubt I'm extremely satisfied with my experience here. The decor is really nice, there's a relaxing ambiance, and they were playing 90's R&B now that's what's up. We shall start with the food:**Crispy Calamari ($5 during happy hour)- the batter had a good amount of salt and a little bit of a seasoning on it. It came with 2 dipping sauces: sriracha and a basil sauce. They definitely lived up to the name because the calamari was crispy but not greasy. **Yum Yum and 16th Street rolls ($5 each during happy hour)- \u00a0I lump these 2 together because they were pretty basic rolls. Nothing too special about them so I can see why they're part of their happy hour menu. The Yum Yum had crab salad, avocado, deep fried shrimp, and cream cheese while the 16th Street had spicy tuna, cream cheese, and avocado and it was deep fried. **Bento box with chicken katsu and salmon teriyaki ($15) - my boyfriend used to work at a sushi restaurant and apparently in order to judge the quality of a sushi restaurant he orders salmon teriyaki to judge how that restaurant is. Well I can tell you they didn't disappoint. The salmon was really moist and the sauce on top was a bit sweet. It was served with two small pieces but they were delicious. I'm not a fan of chicken katsu but I did try it for the sake of this review and the chicken was pretty good. The meat was also moist and the panko was crispy. The rice ball could have been a little bigger but such is life. Onto the service, absolutely amazing! Our server Jenny was really nice and observant. She noticed all our ginger was gone (the boyfriend loves that stuff) and brought out more without us even asking. We don't normally ask for more but just her thinking we might want more was really sweet of her. The other employees were quick to fill up our water glasses and ask how we were doing. The calamari and sushi rolls came out super quick but the bento box took a little longer which Jenny apologized for. No biggie we didn't even wait that long for it. I'll definitely be back to Jensai to try their other stuff and to get more of that amazing customer service!"], ["Fancy N.", "One star for dropping the bill off to us trying to kick us out without asking us if we wanted anything else. \"What if we wanted dessert?\" -the hangry bf"], ["Michelle M.", "This was my first time here so I'll start with OK.

We also ordered albacore, which was really good and the slices where thick! *thumbs up* for rolls, we ordered black Pearl, sexy angel (I think that's what it's called) and ring of fire. My friend and I were waiting to eat the sexy angel which looks delicious on their pictures on yelp because it had chunks of scallops on top but when we received it, there were no chunks of scallops so I was really bummed. Ring of fire was OK. It was kind of plain for me and I tasted mainly the jalape\u00f1o. Black Pearl was amazzzingg. Had a torched taste to it and this roll was huge!

I ended up ordering the Sexy Angel because it sounded good except for the cilantro. I wasnt sure how I would feel about having cilantro in my sushi roll and after having it I've decided I am not a fan. When I walked in it was pretty busy. My friend ordered the wings and a chicken teriyaki bowl. The wings were okay, it reminded me of the wings I've had at a standard chinese restaurant and the chicken teriyaki bowl was sub par. The teriyaki sauce tasted like the big containers of teriyaki sauce you can buy at costco and the rice was overly mushy. Our waiter was pretty nice but he was busy. In fact my friend asked our waiter, the hostess and another lady about the raffle and prizes going on and no one got back to us during our meal at all. No one had any idea what was going on so it was pretty disorganized. We had to wait at the end after our meal finished to see what was going on and they said they would do the raffle tomorrow because they were too booked. I'm pretty sure if they advertise on their flier on facebook that they were doing a raffle of their grand opening they better do it the night of their grand opening instead of delaying it. Also when it was time to pay our bill our server vanished, I had no idea where he went and I didnt see him for the rest of the night. It took forever for someone to come by and pick up my money.The good thing was that because it was a grand opening it was 20% off all food items ( note online it said food and drinks but in the restaurant it said only food items) and they gave me a little goodie bag which was a nice though.Overall sushi wasn't bad and it wasnt great.

The owners went around introducing themselves to their guests and everyone I met was friendly. There are two main rooms. One room has the sushi bar while the other room has the bar. I love the d\u00e9cor of the place, especially the bar side. The walls are painted a dark purple. There are two booths that line one side of the wall. There is also a small space between the two rooms with comfortable looking couches and paper umbrellas hanging atop decoratively. \u00a0I believe that's where you wait to be seated. I wouldn't mind waiting if I was hanging out there. I came back a second time to try more things off their menu. The smiling hostess seated me immediately when I came in. I decided to sit at the bar while waiting for my friend to show up. The bartender, Ben, greeted me as soon as I sat down. I normally don't drink, but the lychee martini sounded yummy, so he quickly made one for me. When my friend came, she ordered the sake sampler. It's great for those who like sake and want to try different flavors and don't want to commit to just one.Appetizers- Gyoza, Mama's Chicken Wings, Oysters, EdamameMy favorite was the oysters of course. If I was to describe them using one word, then it would be FRESH. I liked the accompaniments that were atop of them. I could probably eat dozens of them and still want more!Jensai Blue Fire- Spicy scallop & spicy tuna mix, jalapeno, cucumber, topped w/ tuna, unagi & tobiko (torched)The roll comes out set on fire- hypnotizing. Dinner and a show! :) It not only looked great, but tasted delicious. Order this if you can't decide what to order. \u00a0Dragonfly- Deep fried shrimp, avocado topped w/ tuna, salmon, scallions & masagoThe first thing I tasted was the freshness of the fish.

A restaurant who has a 4.5 stars you would think everyone would be on top of their game. And yet here I am so disappointed in this place. I wish I could say that maybe it was a bad day under staff whatever the case may be.

I came in and they sat us in the bar side in the back. The ambiance was cool, it actually felt cozy. The man who sat us down was nice I thought ok maybe we get some good service. Little did I know...We placed our orders about 7:10, only 10 minutes and we've made our selection. For our appetizer: Soft Shell Crab, 1/2 Oysters, and Wakame Salad. For our rolls: Sexy Angel and BaoBao. 7:30-7:45 comes around and our food has not even been served yet. Mind you, this is a sushi restaurant and I did not order any actual soup or anything like that. I kept it simple, rolls. Rolls that should be done in maybe let's say 1-2 minutes and I only ordered 2. And my appetizer should take no longer than 10 minutes tops! And most of it is raw so there should be no excuses.We first got the Wakame Salad, and I must say it was delicious. What made me disappointed was it was only seaweed and some oil drizzle and still took that long to be brought out. The Soft Shell Crab came about 10 minutes later and it was over fried. You can tell when all you taste is just the burn pieces from the batter. And the 1/2 Oysters were pretty good.About maybe 15 minutes from that we were expecting ok maybe the food will come out back to back since we have waited so long. Nope, we had to ask for our food and the person who came to assist only rolled his eyes. Look, don't be sassy and roll your eyes at me chump. It's so rude I had to knock a few stars. When he came back he says the order is coming up. And literally about 2 minutes later the food finally was served. The rolls were simply delicious and I wish I could have enjoyed them with a positive review from the restaurant itself. Its not too saucy, perfect. Sigh. I'm so disappointed that I can't seem to get myself to give a better rating. I know they were not understaffed because the restaurant side had 4 chefs multiple waiters. Don't play. I'm big on sushi and by saying that is just full of shiiiet. How the hell did I end up waiting almost a full hour to only take less than 5 minutes to eat? I don't know. Would I come back?

So I know if I have a bad day at work, I can leave early and hit up their Happy Hour to start drowning my sorrows mid-afternoon. And, the HH prices are $5 for most things, both food and drink related. I had a nice Pinot Grigio (from a selection that also included Chardonnay, Merlot, and Cabernet). There were several apps and sushi rolls from which to choose from, for only $5 each as well. So, to me, since HH is supposed to be synonymous with \"cheap\" this Jensai scored on that :)To eat, I ordered/tried the gyoza (very good, with six pieces) and the pork bao (presented more like tacos, but I loved those!), Also tried one of the chicken wings, which were very good and I would try again. I didn't try any sushi, because I just don't dig the stuff. But,from what I saw that folks around me ordered, you got a pretty good sized roll for only $5, and there were about 6-8 that you could order.Oh, and a few of us sat at the bar, and the bartender was very nice and efficient, having to serve us individually while keeping up with the orders constantly coming in during HH. Good job, sir!!All in all, I don't know how often I'll hit up this location (and I've just got tons of sushi options nearer to where I live), but my experience here with HH prices and good friends warranted a 4-star review from me. Thanks for being a gracious host, Jensai!"], ["Scott F.", "I'm sad Kamon is no longer there. \u00a0It was my favorite Japanese restaurant in Sacramento. \u00a0When it was sold, the article stated they would do their best to retain recipes and staff, and when I came for dinner they did not meet my expectations. \u00a0Yes, the bartender was the same, but quite a few of the other sushi chefs and servers were not there when I came in. \u00a0Yes, they kept a number of sushi rolls, but the execution in flavor or size were not up to snuff. The teriyaki sauce and sauce over the sesame chicken were salty.Don't get me wrong, they do some things right. \u00a0They have a good number of items on their happy hour menu, with the highlight being their chicken wings. \u00a0Tasty salt and pepper wings, and I think it was 6 or 8 wings. \u00a0The new roll that I especially liked was the flaming one. \u00a0It not only looked cool, but it tasted really good. \u00a0Better execution than on my favorite Jiu Jitsu roll. \u00a0For dinner they have choose two items, but the choices were the different meats. \u00a0I liked how Kamon had the choice of 3, with different things like haru maki, gyoza, or korroke to choose. \u00a0Bring it back!The parking here stinks, but the food and staff always brought me back. \u00a0I hope Jensai can sustain and bring Kamon's \"it\" factor with it, other wise, they are just another Japanese restaurant."], ["Siemny C.", "This place has a great daily happy hour where a bunch of stuff is only $5!

I surrenders that and he took 3 minutes reading every fine detail on the paper, and said this is their policy to TAKE AWAY such ID for approval. I explain to him that Mikuni simply DOES NOT have authority to treat my ID differently as the DMV hold the temp license as good as the plastic. If they dont take away my coworkers' IDs (they really dont have a right to) then they should not take away mine for \"APPROVAL\".

This radically trendy, Americanized-Japanese restaurant and sushi bar, located in midtown Sac, takes pride in its three exclusive sushi bars, sleek bar, flat screen TVs, and its extensive menu. This bustling venue has abundant seating (upstairs and downstairs), so bring the fam and all the homies. The whimsical Wheel of Fortune wheel on the second level of the restaurant will certainly intrigue you. According to a server, you may only spin the wheel on your birthday for a prize. Boo. While our friends opted for the $45 dinner for two (four course selection of their most revered dishes), my significant and I selected four various dishes: + NIGIRI SUSHI MIX 10 pieces for $19.50: The dull appearance of the fish was telltale of the quality and freshness. Nigiri was constructed rather haphazardly---the overall presentation was undignified. Nevertheless, the taste of the fish was MEH, all right. What an overcoming disappointment. + SASHIMI MIX 8 pieces for $10.00: I requested for half sake (salmon) and half Hamachi (yellowtail). I was really looking forward to mouthwatering, exquisitely soft and buttery Hamachi. This sashimi dish did not deliver. Hamachi had a disagreeable fishy, and slightly sour taste. Salmon on the other hand, was acceptable. + SPICY JOHNNY ROLL $10.95 (Spicy tuna, panko shrimp, avocado, eel, masago): My resentment for sushi rolls remains. The monotonous sushi roll was not spicy and primarily tasted of rice.+ ALBACORE PEPPERFIN $13.50: The delicate albacore tuna was thinly sliced, coated with citrus soy dressing, garnished with jalape\u00f1os and sesame seeds. Oh maaan, was this dish a delight! The fish truly melted in my mouth. The provocative flavors and the lingering heat were outstanding. We absolutely adored this tasty dish! FYIService is exceptional.

We had the following.-freaky edamame - garlicy soy beans. Sight kick. 4 stars. -Fish and chips - Tempura batter on the fish so not fried to a golden brown but still good. Fries had a simple seasoning that seemed like your run-of-the-mill curly fry seasoning. It came with two sauces (a simple ketchup and another sauce that was sweet and flowery). Maybe 4 stars. -Peter Two Roll (yelp.com/biz_photos/miku\u2026)Seared tuna, eel, avocado, spicy tuna, crab mix, panko shrimp, spicy dream sauces, masago, onion. I was hesitant to try this as I really don't like eel (not a fan of the stuff, raw or cooked) but I actually liked this roll quite a bit. Maybe because the eel was competing with the other ingredients. There's a lot going on in this roll. I was a bit overwhelmed at first considering all of the fillings if you take the time to try to look for all the flavors, you will. The same goes for the other rolls I tried. The two sauces were interesting and I've never had anything similar with sushi. The red one was a more intense sriracha and the yellow was some sort of mustard sauce i believe. 4 stars.-Benjamin Roll (yelp.com/biz_photos/miku\u2026)Eel, seared tuna, panko shrimp, crab mix, avocado, jalapenos, sauced, torched, masago, onion. Basically the same notes as the peter two roll. Liked the thinly sliced jalapenos. Sauce was different (mild and creamy). \u00a04 stars-Pimp My Roll (yelp.com/biz_photos/miku\u2026)Spicy tuna, panko shrimp, avocado, salmon, sauced, torched, masago, onion, macadamia nuts. This is the one that I ordered haha. Had trouble tasting the macadamia nuts in this one. Not bad, though. 4 stars-Japanese Mafia Roll (yelp.com/biz_photos/miku\u2026)Scallop, shrimp, crab, cream cheese, avocado, salmon, sauced and torched, masago, onion. Normally, I HATE cream cheese in my sushi. If anything is sushi has that melt-in-your-mouth thing going on, it had better be due to super fresh fish. Much like the eel, I didn't mind this time around. The rolls here are over-the-top and very trendy. That is great because Mikuni stands out quite a bit, but then again, this is exactly what elevates the sushi from complex to borderline complicated. That isn't to say that I didn't enjoy the sushi, but I probably didn't mind the eel and the cream cheese this time around because it had to compete with the other ingredients. Furthermore, the lengthy list of sushi-fillings commands a higher price. Service was excellent and close to 5 stars. The woman that seemed to be in charge of the front/reception area noticed it was out first time and took us to our table herself while making some menu suggestions along the way. She mentioned all of the specials and answered our questions. Our server was also pretty helpful.I am definitely a fan and I will be back. I suggest you check out Mikuni for yourself!"], ["Sandra G.", "Overhyped. I was in the Sacramento area craving for sushi, and made the mistake of only seeing the four stars here and 1000+ reviews, instead of actually reading them. If you love Japanese food, don't come here. This is Asian fusion; the place for cocktails, taking pictures of your food and your date/girlfriends to post on Instagram, but not a place to feel satiation unless you have the $$$ to order more dishes. A lot of rolls have the same ingredients, just under different names, and I think a considerable amount had jalapenos? What is up with THAT. 5 star customer service, mostly fresh fish, atmosphere, alcohol. A shot of fresh sake came in a pretty little glass cup (bigger than shot glass), absolutely worth $5. And because I'm a light weight, half of it was enough to make my head spin. If I came back, it's for the alcohol, not the food!"], ["Jane F.", "I am not going to lie, I was skeptical about eating sushi in Sacramento, being spoiled by San Francisco and all, but let me tell you this place is legit. The service is outstanding, the sashimi is fresh and delicious, and the seared white tuna is out of this word good. Oh and be sure to get a torched salmon belly with sea salt - it does not disappoint! I will definitely be back."]]}
