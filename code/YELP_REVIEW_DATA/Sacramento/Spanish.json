Even when I call and order ahead of time I end up having to wait when I'm there. I've really only seen 1 or 2 cooks even during busy times, which is what causes the lag.P.S.

So I thought I'd also order a fool proof dish as my main as a just in case. Boy was I wrong.I ordered nachos and they came out with crappy congealed cheese (like the kind you get at 7-11) a little pico de gallo and some not so great guacamole and pickled jalapenos. The lady at the counter was a little rude too, and forgot the curtido at first, so we had to go up to the window again and get it.

In fact, these are the best pupusas I've had. I prefer ones that aren't meat just because they seem to always be so dry, so the bean and cheese one was just perfect. The tamales were killer, the tacos surprisingly flavorful and not greasy, and the salsa dangerously spicy. I loved it and licked my salty fingers clean :)Others mentioned the sketchy parking lot.

I expected it to be bigger like a quesadilla but it was about the size of a small pancake. It was yummy especially with the salsa and I wished I ordered two. The cabbage was pretty good too.

The filling was delicious and the masa had a good texture to it.My husband tried the chicken special with bell peppers and onions. It is worth noting that the chicken was very flavorful, unlike the dry and burnt meats you typically get in most Mexican restaurants.As for the atmosphere, it is pretty much a hole in the wall Mexican restaurant in a sketchy neighborhood. It is not a place you want to be late at night.

Yet the staff was not hovering and let us enjoy the evening. Great service!We started with the zucchini chips. I've attempted to make zucchini chips for years and fail every time but they nailed it! Thin with a little crunch and soooo flavorful! Bonus that you get a huge plateful for only $4. The bread and butter included was warm, light and flaky. I got the duck confit. Tender, falling off the bone and rich with a crispy skin. Served over a bean ragu that was mild and the perfect bed for the rich duck. We split a side of the creamy white corn polenta. Just a bowl of decadent creamy goodness with a light spicy kick. My partner got the gnocchi bolognese. Gnocchi were cooked perfectly tender and the sauce was rich and meaty.

It was a perfect dinner out and we'll definitely be back soon!"], ["Thomas M.", "Been here a few times and always left satisfied.Great appetizers like the zucchini chips! They are a must try.

My good friend loves the mussels, and I've tried a few and can see why.Service has never lacked as far as I can recall, and I've been here quite a few times. Everything is courteous, timely and accommodating. Happy hour is all day on Thursdays, which can get a little dangerous! Ha. The decor is lovely; I really dig the blue water glasses.

For dinner I had the port wine short ribs, super tender and falls apart. My friends got the gnocchi that was bomb. But best of all make sure to save some room for dessert.

The sandwich was amazing. A real burst of flavors with great bread and everything.Given the surroundings, the sandwich with the side salad was a good deal as well. Granted, because we were attending a conference we received 10% off which certainly didn't hurt. \u00a0Service was great. Although most of us just drank water, our glasses were never empty.

If it weren't for some extremely slow service, I'd have more to recommend. I made a return visit for dinner recently and at first I wondered why it had taken so damn long to give them another try. We sat out on their lovely and spacious patio, the late summer sun peeking through the ivy, and proceeded to salivate over the many menu options. Unfortunately, that was the peak of our experience. After swiftly receiving a heaping plate of fried zucchini chips as an appetizer (wonderful, by the way) and getting a detailed rundown on the specials from our enthusiastic waiter, we waited to place our order. A good 15 minutes later we put in our order and let him know we had a show to attend after. Almost 30 minutes later, and after having considerable difficulty getting him to pay us any attention, we reminded him of our deadline and asked where the food was. He looked flustered. The food came, but the dining experience had to be rushed. On a bright note, the chicken piccata was delicious. \u00a0Maybe they were understaffed. Maybe he was overwhelmed by the dinner crowd.

It was really cool that they agreed to do a half portion of it because we really wanted to try it but didn't want a whole gigantic plate of just pasta. And I've discovered I am pro duck!

I checked in to get my name down for our party of 6-- a 10-15minute wait. Perfect timing for the remainder of the party to find glorious downtown metered street parking.The service seemed a bit understaffed, but the employees were able to maintain their composure despite the hectic demanding rushing atmosphere from multiple customers.We had zucchini fries, courtesy of Yelp check-in. I ordered the pappardelle which was pretty good, but a bit too salty (because of \u00a0the sausage, as expected). It took a while to grab someone's attention to order, for our dishes to arrive, & even get refills on our waters. Luckily the zucchini fries kept us occupied, as well as each others' company. I only had 45 mins left after ordering before I had to leave. Seeing as how restaurants courteously try to serve the entire party at once, I was only left with less than10mins to scarf down as much piping hot food as I can without burning my tongue, making a big mess, or looking too savage-y. I tracked down a worker for a box to take my food, threw money for my share of the meal (+ tip), bid my comrades farewell, rushed back to my car just before time was up on the meter, & maniacally drove back to work before I was late. Moral of the story: it'll take a while, so it'll probably be best to not be on a \"tight schedule\" when you come here, especially when there's a list of people for 'party of 2' out the door waiting to be seated. Even more so when you come in a large group during a time like this.I think the staff did a splendid job in terms of customer service considering how chaotic the late lunch rush was. I'm sure everyone else was in a rush to get back to work ASAP as well & it seemed like the staff tried their best to do this without compromising customer service too much.The prices seem steep-- then again, it is midtown.. My pappardelle was pretty good, but I don't think it was $15 worth of good (for lunch?!). \u00a0If any fellow Yelpers are feeling generous enough to take me out & pay for an expensive lunch or dinner date, I'd be happy to return here--given that I'm not in a rush or on a tight schedule."], ["Yao C.", "Went here for my birthday with my lady and couple of friends and was expecting a GREAT birthday meal and I only got an average one!!!

Visual appearance was much better than the taste though. I liked the saut\u00e9ed garlic shrimp and the cheese flatbread served with hummus and olive tapenade. Parmesan fries were good too, but were a little soggy. Didn't care for the ricotta gnocchi or the zucchini chips. We also all ordered a round of shots and some cocktails off their drink menu.

Yes!I thought the Parmesan Fries were good (especially the dipping sauces they came with), the Gnocchi was OK, and Elyssa thought the Mussels were delicious.I will definitely be back here again for another Happy Hour or to sit in the beautiful covered (and shaded!) patio."], ["Mallie F.", "I went here with my parents to show them downtown Sacramento. As a local, I know that Sac has some pretty awesome eateries, but this one was new to me. My mom's family is from Lucca, Italy, so we thought it would be a fun place to eat. Not so much.The ambiance was strange. It looked like a nice higher-end casual restaurant, but it didn't read Italian/Mediterranean like it advertised being. It looked like a nice American bistro. I can get over that. Looking at the menu, nothing screamed Italian or Mediterranean to either my mom (full blooded Italian) or me. Whatever. My mom informed out waiter of her life-threatening fish allergy, and the waiter acted as if she was annoyed. It's an allergy, she can't control it. I ordered the Cioppino, which I have had at countless other restaurants, including one in Italy. This was not Cioppino. This was random fish in oily tomato broth with WAY too much fennel. One of the mussels in the soup tasted rancid to the point that I had to spit it out and, frankly, fight the urge to vomit. I have never had any seafood that tasted that bad. It ruined the rest of the already mediocre dish.My mom had vegetable soup, which was in a similar oily tomato based broth with way too much fennel. She was not too happy with it. We also split olives, which were good, but very pricey.My dad ordered the swordfish special (after not being too thrilled with the rest of the menu) and enjoyed it. At least one of us had an enjoyable meal.Back to the waiter (apparently waitress is not politically correct anymore). As time went on, she seemed more and more annoyed. When I mentioned the mussel tasting off (which I mentioned mainly so no one would get sick), she said she would get her manager, then rolled her eyes as she walked away. The manager then came over and was very passive. He offered to make me another dish, which I didn't want, then didn't want to do anything else. My mother asked if we could receive a small discount, which he agreed to, then abruptly walked away. All in all, a disappointing dinner. Needless to say, we will not be returning."], ["Ed R.", "Had a great time here two weeks n a row.

Instead Erin hangs in there and chats up her customers to make them feel welcomed. Erin could teach the new A-hole hipster/sleeved up bartenders a thing or two about customer service.

Overall it was good, and I would recommend to others, but it's not really my cup of tea. Everyone who works here is very professional and friendly, making all guests feel welcome. Great service behind great food? Makes a huge difference. Our group started off with a number of appetizers. Zucchini Chips ($4) are a popular choice here, and they're pretty good. My favorite is the Fried Calamari ($13) with sweet pepper, fennel, kalamata olives, and spicy harissa sauce. I don't usually like calamari but these were perfectly seasoned and not overfried like many other places. We also had the Iron Skillet Roasted Mussels ($12) which I would also recommend. Oh and I also ordered a Jalape\u00f1o Martini ($9) because I had been eyeing it since I opened the menu. YUM! Spicy and satisfying.For my entree, I got the Port Braised Beef Short Ribs ($19.50) which has roasted root vegetables, caramelized pearl onions, and creamy white corn polenta. It was too heavy for me at the time, but if you like short ribs, this is a good selection. The short ribs are tender and fall apart. The port makes the short ribs and vegetables very flavorful so the polenta balances it out.We concluded our meal with their holiday special Egg Nog Creme Brulee with Peppermint Biscotti.

The broccoli was fine, maybe a bit overcooked . \u00a0I also got to taste my friends shrimp risotto and the chicken that's wrapped in bacon (I forget the Italian name). The risotto was amazingly rich and creamy. The chicken was not too salty with the bacon and moist and delicious. Omg. Perfect. \u00a0And yes there was dessert.

Service is impeccable. If you like high end cuisine minus the attitude... this is your place.This is a small restaurant in what appears to be an old building & loan (hence the B&L). There isnt really a sign out front, so just look for the big brick building. No, they don't valet, so park around the corner in the $5 lot up the block if you are like me and dont like having to search (or wait) for parking.And now the food. Menu changes quite regularly, but there is something for everyone here. Amuse bouche was a carrot, gingery cold soup that was divine. We had the cheese plate (really amazing cheeses from Wisconsin and other mid western places) with samplings of pistachios and fruits. Although we liked the bread, we both weren't fans of the paper thin crackers they serve with the cheese. Those were dry and basically crumbled when touched. I had the locally raised sturgeon with potato coins, asparagus, and some kind of phenomenal spicy chile sauce that had me wishing I could beg for an extra side of it to go. My sis had the rib eye that was one of the best she had (and trust me she is picky as hell about her beef). Luckily for her (she's one of those people that likes to substitute items) they put up with her requests pleasantly.Had a great Santa Barbara pinot noir with dinner and into dessert, where we split the famed ding dong that other yelpers raved about. This is a super rich, thick as fudge chocolate cake. Its the kind of dessert that someone who wishes for a slow death by chocolate would enjoy. Apparently there is a lovely patio here as well. I really wished I would have known that was an option when I booked the reservation, but there's always next time.

We also had the sun-dried tomato linguine with house-made andouille sausage. That was probably our favorite dish, though I couldn't really taste the sundried tomato. For entrees, hubs and I had the pork chop and rib eye steak. The portion sizes are very generous. The pork chop was the largest I've ever seen. \u00a0It was good - moist and flavorful. The rib eye was also decent - had a nice amount of char on it. The desserts were okay - kind of lackluster and really not pleasing to look at. We had the pumpkin cheesecake and \"dirt\" pie. I guess that's what I get for ordering something called \"dirt\" pie anyway.Our waiter was not helpful; didn't give us any recommendations or anything like that. He kind of didn't have a personality; maybe it was an off night for him... I dunno. Hubs ordered a beer and he brought out a glass of cab. I already had a wine; I ordered a rose to start off my meal. I was planning on ordering red once my entree arrived and offered to keep the cab since it was already there and I hate to be wasteful.

Our server, David, was a jokester and really lightened the mood by mocking their overpriced $18 special of the day: toast with house-made jam. Seems weird right? He checked up on us periodically but for the most part, let us enjoy our night. Smoked salmon drizzled with some mayo aioli served with deconstructed egg whites, yolks, capers, and toast on the side: smoked salmon is smoked salmon but when eaten with the eggs and capers, that's the game changer! Also, the creamy mayo sauce really upped the flavor. I wasn't too fond of the toast because it was flakey and broke off pretty easily. Fettuccini with house-made pancetta: I really enjoyed this dish. It was made with a light white sauce (easy on the love handles) that tasted so flavorful. The veggies and pancetta were cooked properly. Zero complaints here!28 day aged rib eye: this was my boyfriend's dish and although I didn't try much of it, it wasn't over cooked. Can't stand over cooked steak.

The lovely hostess greeted us and led us through the romantic-white-curtained entrance of the dining room. There was outside seating too, but it was cooler inside. The restaurant was busy and loud, but the acoustics were good so we didn't have to shout.The daily menu was exactly as described--full of fresh farm to table choices. We chose a few starters such as: House Smoked Salmon with Irish Brown Bread and traditional accompaniments. The Salmon had a light smoked flavor, thinly sliced and the accompaniments were super fine chopped boiled egg and capers. The brown bread was unique and paired with the salmon and its accompaniments very well. We also ordered the Shaved Kale Salad with heirloom tomatoes, peach, goat cheese and saba (wait, what's saba?). This was so interesting and tasty! Everything played off of each other like a symphony! During this time we also got fresh bread delivered to the table with butter (no foil butter pats to unfoil, thank you!). And constant attention from the staff as far as (my favorite) dusting the tablecloth for crumbs. Oh good service how I love thee. Our entrees were B&L Fettucine with Braised Lamb which ended in a clean-swiped plate. And Seared Day Boat Scallops with Beet Relish and cranberry bean succotash. The scallops were large and cooked perfectly. Unfortunately I learned I don't like succotash. I always wanted to try it since, well, you know since Sylvester mentioned it! Our server seemed a little concerned. We ended our meal with Peach Cobbler served with Corn Ice Cream. Yes, I said \"corn.\" I want corn ice cream all the time now!

The menu is always changing but if you can get the tomato and fresh mozzarella starter then do it! It's so so good! The dessert chocolates are fantastic as well.

Our server, Ginger, was so wonderful. \u00a0We are wine newbs and her suggestion of the Napa Valley white Matthiasson was spot on for us. \u00a0She was so attentive and charming the whole meal. \u00a0We had the heirloom tomatoes and hand-pulled mozzarella starter, which was phenomenal! \u00a0The mozz is even still warm from the pot. We also had a special small plate of beef (I forget the name of it) with white nishiki rice and a red spicy mousse.For entrees, we had the Sturgeon and the duck. \u00a0Both were wonderfully cooked. \u00a0The fish was very fresh and bright while my duck was a treat paired with turnips and gypsy peppers. \u00a0Needless to say, we cleaned our plates of every drop. \u00a0And, as if it wasn't amazing already, I had the ding-dong for dessert (super decadent and luscious, a chocolate lover's heaven) and he had the apple strudel paired with the 12 yr Irish whisky. \u00a0All together (so a bottle of wine, two starters, two entrees, two desserts, and a whisky) the meal came to about $200 excluding the tip. \u00a0Mulvaney's will stay a special occasion place for us but I'm already imagining we'll be there again come the next birthday or anniversary (or both)! \u00a0Thanks for a great night!"], ["Tom S.", "We had a special dinner for 50 people in the event room.

Though there were just 4 servers & a manager the efficiency of the folks was extraordinary. Prompt, friendly, happy, & accommodating. A bit pricey. Dinner with 13 bottles of wine (& I brought 8 bottles from home - corkage was $18 per bottle), per person cost was $50. \u00a0 No host bar liquor prices seemed high also, my not so good martini, small in size, was $13.Excellent food, skip the cocktails."], ["California G.", "This is a late review post regarding this spot but I thought to share my experience.

It's located in an old brick fire house. There isn't a sign out front.I normally skip on bread and butter, because I want to save room for the good stuff. The bread and butter were really good though. The bread was soft with a crusty exterior. The butter was smooth and sprinkled with red sea salt.I ordered the Smokey Line Caught King Salmon Filet. It came with Brussels, salsify and fregola. I wasn't sure what salsify or what fregola was, but salsify is a root and fregola is pasta that is similar to couscous. The salmon was crispy and flaky. I also enjoyed the fregola. It was a balanced meal- meat, vegetables, and grains. I was debating between two desserts and the waiter recommended the Chocolate Pecan Tart. It sat on a smear of cranberry jelly and a dollop of vanilla bean cr\u00e8me on top. I don't know why I even picked this when I don't like nuts. Besides that, the crust was hard and was difficult to cut through with my fork. The cranberry jelly was sour and didn't complement the tart. The vanilla bean cr\u00e8me tasted more like sour cream. I should've gone with the other dessert instead.Service was ok. I'm not sure how I should take our waiter's demeanor. The bus boy, however, always refilled our cup before it was even half empty (or should I say half full?). At the end of the meal we were given our receipt in a book. I found a word I liked, \"smile\", circled it, signed and dated it. My experience was ok, but I was expecting more."], ["Christina G.", "Giving a rare 5 to this one.

The wait was a bit long and as we were seated we were informed we'd be given a complimentary appetizer as well. Everything was delish! The amuse bouche (a nice touch), the smoked salmon appetizer, the beet salad, the duck and lentils (my husband LOVED his steak) and the tart for dessert. We made a night of it with drinks and dessert and espresso. The atmosphere (again I can only speak to our private room) was lovely. Candles everywhere, soft Sinatra music and the right balance of good-humored attention from the staff and privacy. My husband, who abhors noisy restaurants, loved it.

This inlcudes Dungeness Crab Cakes, Poblano Creme Tuscan Marinated Rib-Eye, Demi-Glace Pork Belly. Crab Cakes were pretty much 99% lump crab meat. OMG sooo good. Best crab cakes ever! It wasn't just crab flavor or else it would be meh. There's seasonings & other flavors mixed in. Awesome. The Tuscan Marinated Rib-Eye was juicy & so flavorful. It's got a smoky char flavor as well. Loved it. I'm not a fan of Pork Belly but if every pork belly tasted like this one, it would be my favorite part of the beast. This was some super tender fall off the fork, juicy Pork Belly. The flavor was out of this world. Smoky, tangy, sweet...it's all in there. Soo good. Mmm mm. Get the Sampler & sample a taste of heaven.\u00a4 Day Boat, Fresh Fish (4*). The fish of the day was Swordfish. Caught that day. Tender & flavorful. The tomatoe based sauce was excellent.\u00a4 Frutti di Mare (5*). You can't tell in the picture but this dish came out & my jaw dropped. The largest Prawn/Shrimp I've seen served in a restaurant. It's the size of my fist. Oh, the lobster trail is hiding behind it in the picture. So yeah, it was bigger than the lobster. I like shrimp better than lobster, sorry folks. Overall the dish was very delicious.

First off I need to express how amazing Randy Bowling is. From my first sit down with him we immediately made a connection. He genuinely cared about me and my fianc\u00e9 (at the time) and our vision for the wedding. When we met for our first overview of the night he listened to everything I said I wanted and was willing to offer up his suggestions as well. Let me tell you, he knows what he is talking about. All his suggestions served for a better execution of the night. His timeline also served as a checklist and helped me figure out what I still needed to do. His excel spreadsheet for the meal selections were simple and easy to input, making it helpful for me to keep track as well. Now onto the the real deal, the actual wedding. Wow it was more than I could ever imagine. The venue is naturally beautiful but with all my decorations added in the courtyard, it looked magical! While waiting in the eagle room Randy came up to check on me and immediately calmed my neves. His number one priority was to make sure I was happy. I got to peak out at the courtyard and see everything and I was speechless. The rest of the night was just as smooth as his customer service. The staff members are professional and respectable. I have never had better service in my life. All the transitions were smooth and everyone was so accommodating to us and our guests. Not to mention the food is spectacular! When family and friends come together and alcohol is involved, it can get a little crazy. The staff was exceptional and able to contain any conflict before it could start. I can honestly say not one thing went wrong. I am still extremely satisfied with my decision to get married at The Firehouse and I would recommend it to anyone. I promise Randy will take care of you. The night was like a fairytale and I didn't want the clock to strike midnight."], ["Paige S.", "What an experience. I compared it in my mind to other fine dining restaurants in the area and none of them come close now. By the end of the meal my fiance and I agreed we never wanted to eat anywhere else again. Never mind the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches we had for lunch the next day...The service here is impeccable. They can really read their audience. A well-placed joke about flogging can do wonders.Here's what we had:- A bottle of red that for the life of me I can't remember what it was. It was a 2011, and that's as much as I've got for you. We left it up to our server, Stephen B., to choose one that would go with both my scallops and my fiance's filet mignon. It was a little earthy and light enough not to overtake my seafood but dark enough to enhance the steak.- Lobster bisque: just a little taster to start off. It was perfect.- Oysters: 3 shinguku and 3 of their special (not sure what they were) paired with champagne mignonette. Best oysters I've ever had. I wish we had ordered nothing but oysters all night.- Dungeness crab cake: honestly, not the best crab cake I've ever had (you're talking to someone who lived in New England for 10 years) but still very tasty.- Hearts of Romaine Caesar: fiance had this and enjoyed it. I did not try it but he cleaned his plate.- Heirloom Tomato Napoleon: OH MY GLOB. Layers of thinly sliced heirlooms of every color, mozzarella, basil, and topped with a fried parmesan basket filled with even MORE tomatoes!??!?! Surrounded by olive oil and dots of balsamic!??!?!? YES. YES YES.- Pancetta Sea Scallops: Perfectly. Cooked. Scallops. Wrapped in pancetta. I can't even. I barely even touched the puree and potatoes underneath because the scallops were so perfect by themselves.- The Firehouse Filet Mignon: so perfectly cooked I think my fiance might have shed a tear. Every bite he took he saw a little bit of heaven.- Coffee and tea to end: they brought out a wooden box filled with tea for my fiance to choose from! Much fancy. Such tea. Wow.This place is ridiculous in every sense of the word. Be prepared to spend a little bit of money. Like a few hundred on two people. We didn't enjoy any dessert (we had Gunther's on the mind) but the menu looked like it would have sent me over the edge. You would have had to drag me screaming and crying away from the place."], ["Eduard G.", "I don't come often to this place but when I do I play the role of a little rich kid. Lol.

It was very refreshing.The bread came warm out of the oven next. Delicious. One was white and one was honey whole wheat.Our salads came with a nice variety of mixed green, toasted and spiced nuts, and blue cheese. Perfectly dressed and a good balance of flavors.Next we received a palate cleanser (first time I have had one of these in a 3 course), it was a small scoop of basil sorbet. It was very sweet so we only ate a little(dessert was coming at the end).We both ordered the Salmon. I asked for mine Med-rare, and there was definitely a lot of rare which I like but it might turn some people off. My wife had hers as the chef prepares normally and it was cooked to perfection. We both were VERY happy with the entrees. Great portion sizes as well.Dessert, I ordered the chocolate mouse cake and my wife ordered the creme brulee. BOTH WERE FANTASTIC. You can tell the quality of chocolate they use is good. The creme brulee you can see the fresh vanilla bean seeds in the vanilla.

On the outside, it may not be what you expect after looking at the pics online. I felt like I was in a old western movie in Texas as I was approaching the restaurant. It was actually really really cool. Firehouse used to be a fire station by the way - fun fact woop woop!We were greeted and brought to our table. The ambiance is romantic (go for a date or anniversary?), dim, relaxing, and very classy to say the least.There is a table for two option, which is $50 per person. It comes with a three course meal per person. Our waitress, Denise (who was the best!), informed us that we could elect to have one person do the \"Table for two\" option, if we wanted to. So we went with that, and then ordered the Fish of the Day entree as well to fill us up. The fish apparently comes fresh every day, and comes \"whole and intact\" as Denise described it. Ensuring that it is fresh and boy oh boy was it good. We had the Salmon that day, highly recommended ($36)They brought us complimentary bite sized scallop on deep fried wontons after taking our order. \"compliments of the chef\" is what I always like to hear! Warm and soft garlic bread ensued with flower carved butter (lol). I don't know what that is funny to me, but it just is. We went with the asparagus soup, filet mignon and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for the 3 course meal. The portions were big despite the stereotype of having small portions at high priced places. In between our soup and our entree, they brought us complimentary cucumber sorbet to clean our palettes. What. \"Clean your palettes\"?! Okay, I dig it *pinky up*.

The lighting is dim and the noise level is pretty low. The service is amazing! Nothing is rushed and they seem to be focused in your experience. I guess my only complaint would be the the waiter checked in a bit too often to see how we were doing. The food was delicious. It isn't crazy creative but very solid cuisine that is done extremely well. I had the duck confit and the skin was perfect in crunchy texture with still very juicy and succulent meat under.

Classy and elegant with rich and decadent flavors.We came here for lunch and the staff was very nice and polite. We were served all at once instead of as our dishes were ready and must have filled my water a dozen times, making sure it never went half empty. Attentive service to say the least. Lunch was served outside in the courtyard and it is a very relaxing, peaceful atmosphere. The inside is has a nice elegant decor but too dark for my personal taste, especially when the outside space is so nice. Even on a hot summer day it was cool enough to be enjoyable with the copious shade and fountain white noise. For lunch our group ordered the Pork Belly appetizer, lobster bisque, Firehouse burger, Swordfish, apple and brie steak sandwich and the tenderloin tips with fingerling potatoes. The standouts were the pork belly, steak sandwich and the tenderloin. With the slight sweetness from the chutney and just a touch of sear from a torch the pork belly is heavy but a small bite as you share with the table and it's perfect. The brie sandwich paired with apple was rich yet fresh with the hint of that apple. A combo I will remember. And the tenderloin with the full grain mustard seeds was my absolute favorite. It was rich and earthy and how fine beef should be prepared. Everything was very good though and for about $15 dollars for a sandwich at lunch and more for the main dishes and seafood I would consider the prices on the higher side but I've certainly paid more for worse.

We told the Server she didn't order the pork and he said he can take it away now instead of suggesting to leave it as the plate was already on the table. She chose to try it. Meanwhile, we all have our food except one person. What happened was the waiter preset the wrong order so the Foie Gras wasn't ordered instead the Oxacan pork was ordered. Shouldn't he have checked what button he presses? So we waited a good 10 minutes for the Foie Gras. The Foie was good but it was so miniscule it wasn't funny. I tried the Crabcakes which it didnt say it was a little spicy and it was only 1 small crabcake. \u00a0Oxacan pork was dry. So far not impressed. We ordered the Duck, the kids Filet Mignon, Seared Ahi, the Pork Chop and the Steak. Duck was chewy, spicy(wasn't told it was spicy or how I wanted it cooked) and small portion. The kids Filet was dry even though it was cooked medium and stringy which means they used lousy meat but the mashed potatoes and fresh vegetables were good. The Seared Ahi was just slightly cooked but it lacked flavor. The pork chop was OK but Macaroni Grill makes it better. Finally the Steak. It was 2 4oz slices which didn't make sense but to only cook it faster because they forgot about it. The Waiter said it was going to be 1 8oz Steak. Again, the lousy quality of meat comes through. Now desert. The Peach and Kalua chocolate. The peach was good but not many peaches. The chocolate was really dense which was hard to finish so we left half. Overall the food is just ok. Wouldn't go back. The quality and portions aren't good.Service was just ok too but should be way, way better for the price. Took a long time to order, messed up on the Foie Gras appetizer, ice tea wasn't refilled until I asked and the waiter asked us about the food only a minute after we got it and didn't come back to ask again after we told him we didn't try it yet. \u00a0All in all I think these ratings are based a lot on what you're past dining experiences were. I'm old so I've eaten at many places in Paris, Lyon, Rome, San Francisco, St. Barths and St. Marten to name a few so it's hard for me to give a high rating here. As long as people enjoyed it is the main thing.

I don't know why we never came here earlier. Now I would love to come here at least a month to try their tasting menu. Yum! I made reservations for this place. Not sure how busy it gets on the weekend, but we came on a weeknight. No problems getting a table. Really really excellent service. Waiters came by frequently to clear plates and scrape away bread crumbs. They would answer our questions politely and never once did they stick their nose up at us, which some fancy places do when they find out you're a Joe Shmoe. The hubs and I felt really welcome here. We felt comfortable and were very happy with our dining experience. We opted to try the Tasting Menu and each got our own glass of wine. Here's what we had:+ Artichoke Tortellini+ Spring Beet Salad+ Blackberry Cabernet Sorbet+ Chimichurri Sea Scallop+ Rib Eye+ Gianduja Mousse BombeI was telling hubs how much I loved the tortellini. I normally hate tortellini, but that might be because I've only ever had ones from Costco, haha. The beets were so fresh! My fave dish was the scallop. I kept thinking about Gordon Ramsay yelling at chefs in Hells Kitchen while eating it. The scallop was cooked perfectly and went well with the ragout. The rib eye was delicious and buttery. My only issue was that it was quite red in the middle, which I thought was more medium-rare than medium. The dessert was really decadent. We each got one bombe but each could only finish half. So we took the rest home. Would've been find to just share one mousse bombe between the both of us. Really exciting to dine here and the food was delicious."], ["Terry K.", "a place where royalty and executives may more than likely dine. Rated one of the best restaurants in the Old Sacramento area (maybe rated one of the best on all of the Sacramento area) is the Firehouse Restaurant. Yep! an old Firehouse hence, the name. Walls are lined with photos of Presidents, Royalty, Celebrities and great articles of commendation.Oddly, Host station is located in the middle of the restaurant floor (you would walk through the bar to get to the host station). We sat in the bar area dining room. Our servers suited up in a coat and tie as with the bus boys. (No female employees; \"A\" typical of an upscale fine dining steakhouse)The Firehouse Restaurant sits in the heart of Old Town Sacramento about a mile from the Capitol Building of the Great State of California. This may explain the former Presidents, Senators and the like. Those who read my reviews know that I am a carnivore. That said, this restaurant was right up my alley to dine and review. I was a guest and reading the reviews, I was excited and glad to learn I would be dining at the Firehouse. Now, reading the reviews, I notice many well written, well descriptive FIVE star reviews. Now, more excited than ever to dine here I head out like a little puppy waiting for a treat! How I wanted to give this place a FIVE star review but I just can't and here is my story:We are seated (there are 3 of us). I browse through the 50 page wine list and select 2 bottles; champagne to chase our appetizers and a nice 2001 Cabernet to compliment our meat. I asked them to open the Cab (better yet, decant the bottle and let it sit; longer sitting open the better IMHO) They decant the bottle on a rolling tray with their backs to us. (I am accustomed to having the decant performed in front of our table) Next, Champagne opened, glasses filled, then bottle is placed in the ice bucket. Amouse Bouche was tasty! \u00a0Next pour of champagne, waiter leaves bottle on our table. (Hmm, maybe that's their procedure dunno... why have an ice bucket if that is the case?)Between the appetizers and the entree we get a dollop of cucumber sorbet= to clean the pallet for a great carnivore experience. \u00a0My host enjoying the sorbet realizes she was crunching on a PIECE OF GLASS! NOT A CHUNK OF ICE.... Quiet and shy, she removes the piece of glass to show us. Her husband calls it to the attention of our waiter who asks \"Are you okay?\" She replies yes. \u00a0There was no I'm sorry, no removal of her tainted sorbet, no replacement of her sorbet, no manager, no nothing! So the rest of our meal just swooshes by.... Oh, they didn't offer us coffee with the Chocolate decedance. Go Figure! They did bring us glass of their \"house desert wine\". Didn't mention its name... oh well, who cares at this point?I am sorry to deliver such a sad review for such a supposedly great place. I am a visitor to the fine City of Sacramento and wanted to experience more... Oh wait! 1 star to the chef who prepared the chateaubriand to perfection. \u00a0This is the end of my story."], ["Mark W.", "Absolutely magnificent! If you're in Sacramento and looking for a truly fantastic dinner then the Fire House is where you need to be. Don't be taken back by the location. The restaurant is located in Old Town which is a cheesy tourist area and my initial thoughts were...oh great this is going to be akin to AppleBees. But step inside you immediately know this is different. First they have the most amazing wine list. I counted 3 pages of just Silver Oak vintages and nearly the same for champagnes. If you're a wine lover then you'll have your choice from some of the finest vineyards in Ca and the world and if you really want to go all out, you'll find some bottles priced at nearly $5,000. For myself, I opted for a growers champagne that was wonderful and priced at about $80.The food is where the action is. Perfectly presented and sublime in taste. Hint, get the heirloom tomato's and be prepared for something really different both in terms of look and taste. I also had the filet which as so tender I did not even use my knife. The service was over the top attentive and everyone you encounter is an expert on the food and wine selection. I really cant say enough about the Fire House and I'll probably be there again tonight."], ["Jonathan H.", "How have I never reviewed The Firehouse before?This place is the pinnacle of classic fine dining in Sacramento. \u00a0The bar up front is fantastic (some of the best mixed drinks I have had in California), the service is superb, and the food of course is excellent. \u00a0 I have not had a more perfectly cooked steak in this town before and the desserts are incredible as well. \u00a0Oh yeah, and a wine list to die for. \u00a0And they just put some local beers in not long ago which is so great to see in a place of this caliber.Seriously?

The foie gras is just a burst of flavor. Salad had just the right amount of dressing and croutons were so good! I love their bread and butter! I swear it's like one of the best butters I've ever had. They also gave us a bit of Alaskan halibut on a chip which was delicious and melon sorbet scoop to cleanse our palette before our entree. The only thing is that it took a while for our entree to come out.. If I could I would give 4.5 stars. Lastly the valet guys are hard workers.

First class experience!I live out of state, and my son was graduating from a nearby college. I realized at the last minute that we had not made dinner reservations for the celebration dinner which was a BIG mistake as most restaurants we were hoping for were already booked. Well, fortunately, this one had availability for our party of 10. We were originally going to be just 8, but had to call back and see if they could possibly squeeze 10 at our table. They hesitated, and came back with a yes. Because of the size of our group, and availability I suppose, we were given their private (and very grand and elegant) room downstairs which we were totally NOT expecting. \u00a0We had our own hostess, and tons of personal attention. It felt like we were at a very high end dinner party. We could actually converse with everyone at the table, and hear ourselves talk. The service was outstanding, patient, and kind. \u00a0Despite the fact that many of our guests did not order alcohol based beverages, which resulted in this NOT being the huge money maker they probably usually expect from this room, the servers were extremely friendly and hospitable. We were not rushed, and we felt like we were entertaining in our home (but nicer). The food was also absolutely delicious. Some standouts were the filet mignon with potato croquette, crab cake, scallops, and a beautiful cheese tray. We were given a lovely cucumber sorbet as an amuse bouche (sp) before the main meal which was a lovely and unexpected treat. A few of us shared a delicious desert souffl\u00e9 at the end, and it was AMAZING. We were stuffed, but had to try it. They continued to wow us and exceed all expectations when they brought my son a cr\u00e8me brulee served on a plate on which they had drizzled \"Congratulations\" in chocolate. I'm pretty sure we closed the restaurant, and still they gave some of our party hugs as we left. I highly recommend this place, even if you have to sit upstairs in the regular dining area.

We sat outside in the courtyard area. It was an incredibly romantic setting...white table cloths, vines growing over the old brick building and white lights wrapped around the trees. The waiter places your napkin on your lap for you and they are very attentive to meet your needs. My husband ordered a steak while I opted for the lobster dish. I wasn't particularly impressed with my dish that's my fault because I misunderstood what I was ordering. I thought it was lobster tail and it turned out to be more of a seafood medley pasta. In-between the salad and the main course the waiter surprised us with a cucumber melon sorbet and it was fantastic! My husband doesn't like sweets or icecream so this sorbet was perfect...not too sweet and it had a lovely refreshing citrus taste perfect for the palette. The desert looked fantastic but we were both so full by the time we got to the desert menu that we decided not to order any.

The filet mignon was delicious and it's a must have there. You can tell it was a high quality piece of meat and it was cooked perfectly. The lamb dish was good for someone like me who does not like lamb! Usually I can smell the lamb meat and not touch it but this dish did not have the strong lamb smell, just faintly. I was very surprised at myself for eating it. I loved it how in between serving you new dishes they gave you small but size treats to clean you palate so you can enjoy a fresh new taste on the next dish! Don't forget to leave room for dessert! I've had better dessert outside of sac, but i think it's the best you'll get in town! :) Service: The service was awesome and fantastic.

The goat-cheese stuffed piquillo peppers were just the right combo of savory and rich. The arancini (Italian fried rice balls), were savory, crispy and all around delicious even though I generally don't \"do\" fried food. Not at all greasy - hearty flavor yet delicate feel (not gross or heavy). The grilled calamari appetizer was special because most restaurants default to breaded and deep-fried. The grilled presentation better highlighted both the flavor and the tender texture of the calamari in a way that the deep-fried presentation doesn't, no matter how well handled it is.I had the potato gnocci on both visits. The first time I was surprisingly un-wowed. On the second visit, our server made a point of helping us group our dishes into courses; this made a huge difference because we got to eat the gnocci without having five other more-assertively-flavored dishes compete with the more delicate flavor and texture of the gnocci. Wow, I'm glad I got to taste it a second time.Finally, a shout-out to the staff. A friend and I called at the last minute (we were a few blocks away) because we found the noise in another restaurant too painful (among other issues, my friend wears a hearing aid) and excused ourselves before ordering. Press was able to fit us in. We explained our noise concerns, and they were able to accommodate us in the outdoor dining area with a little wait. While we were waiting for a seat to open up, the staff was solicitous, brought us a carafe of water, and was just generally friendly and accommodating.

Some things are exceptional such as the grilled calamari salad which had the perfect texture.

I don't like to order all my food at once since no matter the promises made, I always end up with all the food out at once instead of staggered in courses. I was promised yet again that I would get food one dish at a time. For my entree, I got the hangar steak rare but had to send it back as it was obviously not. Most things I can forgive but not when it comes to my steak. Not sure if it spent too much time under the heat lamp but it was more on the side of medium rare and medium in some areas. It's understandable as most diners want their food right away but I would rather wait and get it done right! I'm guessing it was made and kept waiting for when we were done with our second course. It's a lesson learned! No matter how much my wait staff insist I will be ordering my food one course at a time in the future. The service was very good and accomodating.

I actually had the mussels and soup as my dinner (two apps, and the waiter was super cool about letting me do that) - both were excellent. The mussels were huge and the broth was very flavorful. The soup was also great, I had the apple/cauliflower and it wasn't too heavy at all. My husband had the linguini with clams which he really enjoyed. I think next time I want to try the short rib!

The calamari was grilled and was different and the pork belly was great. The both my friends had the bologanese and said it was good. My wife had the swordfish and said it was just ok, a little dry. I had the duck confit and it was pretty good. The place started getting more people and louder which was not too bad. The food was just ok, nothing fancy or special really and the prices seemed a little high. We ordered bread, focaccia and it came with side oil and balsamic. My friend said the balsamic was rancid and I guess the owner or head chef came out and asked how everything was. The owner/chef immediately said that it's fine you must like the cheap American stuff, I will bring that out for you. It seemed really rude and he acted like he made the balsamic himself. My friend was really upset and he brought out the American \"cheap stuff\" and it tasted the same. My friend tasted the oil and that was what really tasted bad.

We arrived without a reservation at about 5:15, and were told that they would not be able to seat us until 8:15. I was quite disappointed and surprised. It is fairly small inside though. The hostess offered us a spot at the community table, but it was already pretty crowded and we aren't tiny folks. ;) Unfortunately, we had already sent the Valet away with our car, so we were kind of stuck. We were just deciding what to do when the Hostess pointed us to a bar-like table in the waiting area and said they would serve us dinner there. We took it, and it turned out to be fine. Not the most comfortable spot, but definitely adequate. My only complaint on this point is that there were two tables that sat empty the entire time we were there. I know they could have had no-shows, but it was a bummer to see.We started with some tapas - we had the fried meatballs, the piquillo peppers, and the arancini. All were delicious, but the peppers were the winner of the three. For dinner I had swordfish and aspagus risotto, he had the hanger steak with au gratin. We enjoyed both very much. For dessert I had molten chocolate cake and he had the maple walnut pie. No complaints on dessert either! The service in our little strange space wasn't the best, probably because nobody was quite sure who was taking care of us. So we had a round table of servers, which was ok except our entrees were served and we had no silverware, and later someone stopped by to see if my husband wanted another drink and I wasn't quite ready and nobody ever came back to check on that again. \u00a0We had to flag someone down to pay our bill, and (our fault) forgot to ask for the discount for the theater. :) Overall a nice dinner, great atmosphere and very good food.

I've loved everything I've ever tried, and the prices are so affordable! This is gourmet food for the price of a plate at Paesanos. Why would you even go anywhere else?I've tried the chicken piccata, the pork chop, and the hanger steak, all of which are mouth-watering. You really can't go wrong here! I also highly recommend trying the butternut squash ravioli and the endive salad. The Press is a must try spot and it is now a favorite of mine and all my friends!"], ["Eloise B.", "Went here on a Sunday night and they said they were booked completely unless we wanted to sit at the community table or out on the patio. It was nice out so we opted for the patio. I had a feeling this place was going to be amazing if they were booked on a Sunday evening.When you go here you need to try the tapas first. They do 3 for $10 with a nice selection. We ordered the goat cheese stuffed piquillo peppers (amazing), the fried meatballs with garlic yogurt sauce (also amazing) and the potato croquette (so-so - could have used some kind of sauce with it). I also ordered the caprese salad which was fresh and had a really flavorful balsamic vinegar on it. For my main course I was so stuffed full of tapas already that I decided to order the half order of the chicken cannelloni. I actually regret not ordering the full because it was a creamy, delicious treat and I would have loved to bring home leftovers!The wine selection is also great and they don't skimp when they pour you a glass. This would be a great place to bring a small group of friends to drink wine and enjoy tapas and pasta for the night!

They were a good size and delicious. \u00a0The roasted beets with goat geese was very tasty and fresh. \u00a0The mac & cheese and corn/arancini were good but too similar. The caprese salad was fresh and very tasty. \u00a0Good balsamic.The wild king salmon was made perfectly. \u00a0We asked for not raw, but not medium. \u00a0It was not dried out and served with the most delicious ratatouille which added to the salmon flavor.We were too full for dessert. \u00a0Our waiter was helpful. \u00a0The restaurant has any waiter serve so the food is served at its optimum perfection.Thanks so much."], ["Merrilee V.", "BRAVO!Who knew? So little press about The Press Bistro, simply fantastic in every respect. The Moscow Mule is the best I've found in Sac. Cecconi's West Hollywood, the best anywhere, mix is freshly pressed, but The Press's version is great.Tapas to die for! Meatballs, celery melange, arancini, and pequilla peppers with goat cheese, easy to make an entire meal on these, hating to leave them...Appetizers amazing! Mixed green salad, how good can that get, right?! \u00a0Surprise, it's full of tasty palate pleasures that leave you wondering what is this combination? It works!Grilled calamari with cherry tomato panzanella? Put your fork in a cloud, it's that tender. Never have I tasted calamari like this, heavenly. Topped with the panzanella you fight the choices all night, a bite of this or that...?Finally, chicken Parmesan with fresh tomato sauce, and basil on top of homemade fettuccine. The chicken, moist, not underdone, tender and firm with no overdone frayed edges (not easy to do), the noodles, alone they are delightful, light, tender, perfectly al dent\u00e9, then tomatoes the way they should always be, light, naturally sweet, full of color and tenderly firm... Such a dish!!All on a Sunday night, usually not the best time. Service at the bar, the hostessing, and the wait staff exemplary.Kudos to you Mr. English and your Sou Chef, Mr. Johnson!

I wanted to eat there during the challenge and never got to. Months later they were offering a 4-course dinner for two for $50 and I decided see if they could do a menu for a vegan with that special and they said they would do something for me. I came in with my vegan friend and the chef came up to our table to discuss food options with us. After knowing what we like, he got creative and created a bunch of small, original and incredibly delicious dishes for us. We were excited they kept coming! The chef also recommended a delicious bottle of wine for us and brought us 3 different sorbets for dessert. The experience was very personal and special and made us really want to go back for more. This place is a must go!"], ["Matthew James R.", "WOW!I was wined and dined by my General Manager...Don't tell HR because I really want to come back here.The Old Fashion was delicious!!!I had the Steak and my mouth is still watering just thinking about it.The waiter knew his wine list like the back of his hand. \u00a0I will return with or without my GM. :)"], ["Stella A.", "Very lovely here. I like the fact that there are an array of tapas to order so that you can try a few things for dinner without feeling overly stuffed. The food is very delicious and flavorful.

We had a reservation, just in case, and were seated immediately. Within the first 3 minutes, three separate waiters came by to ask our drink order. It's great that they were attentive, but give us a minute to check out the menu! Once we ordered drinks with one guy, he pretty much handled us for the remainder of our time which was perfect.We ordered 3 tapas - goat cheese stuffed peppers; celery, date, bleu cheese & almond salad & fried meatballs. All were delicious & perfect for the 2 of us to get enough of each one.Shortly there after we got our appetizer, gnocchi with truffle butter sauce & mushrooms. These were delicious, but maybe a little dry. Would have loved more sauce, it was delicious!We split an entree, the braised short rib over polenta. Delicious & so tender! Only needed a fork.We also each got 2 drinks. I opted for the sangria which I wasn't a huge fan of & boyfriend got a bourbon & ginger ale. For all of that, our bill was about $70. I thought that was pretty fair! Loved the feel of the restaurant too. Great tall ceilings, exposed beams, big front windows for a lot of natural light & mirrors for it to bounce off of. I'll definitely go back!"], ["Courtney F.", "Let me just say this place is amazing!!! \u00a0I work down the street and is truly a hidden gem.

It probable took me about 5 minutes to finish the whole dish....YUMMY!Grilled Swordfish - the fish was cook just right and went very well with the green garlic sauce. \u00a0The winter greens were a little on the saltier side, but overall the dish was yummy.Hanger Steak - the steak was cook to his liking and was pretty tender. \u00a0This dish is also pretty tasty.

When we walked in she just looked up at us and said can I help you. This is kind of a offhand comment for someone who's standing in the very front of restaurant Who sole purpose for being at the restaurant is to meet and seat. \u00a0Normally a hostess would say something like \"hi how are you? two for dinner?\" It gave me the impression that she thought I had just wondered in there lost. She then gave the impression that waiting for a table was not an option, \u00a0then second handedly offered communal seating. \u00a0Unprofessional. As for the service. Here's my thought. servers basically have just a few things they need to do. Get your order right, ask if you need refills, Have personality or at bare minimum be polite, ask for feedback about what was ordered, and make suggestions.My server was polite he did not mess up my order and that was about it. For that service I gave a 20% tip that I immediately regretted when I walked out of the restaurant. For instance one of the many items that I ordered was a salad that was over sauced and could've really used some type of pepper which wasn't on the table or offered.I tried a variety of the food, the steak, was amazing and pretty much why I gave any stars. Everything else was sorta of bland or blah. \u00a0The pork was pretty good but needed some greens. I had some of the stuffed peppers - the presentation was sloppy but tasted decent. \u00a0 The fried risotto was pretty gross - it had a decent batter but the innards were bland and blah."], ["Larry B.", "The Press consistently delivers the 'best food for the price' dinner in Sacramento. The quality is excellent and the pricing is very fair for the fresh, seasonal gourmet quality that David's team cooks up. The hangar steak with potato gratin (amazing) is a go-to, the seasonal fish and the commonly-accompanied risotto variations are always a treat. The desserts and tapas are also amazing. Not to mention, this place has visual appeal too. The exposed brick and wood-framed interior provide a clean rustic, relaxed decor. The atmosphere is one of the best unassuming vibes in midtown located next to the likes of other popular locations like Zocalo, 58 degrees and holding, and Paesanos. It's great for a date, dinner with friends, or family. The alcohol is also fairly priced here, try the house red blend, for $6 per glass you can't beat it!"], ["William V.", "We've been here a number of times and each visit was special . \u00a0The food and prices and service keep us coming back. \u00a0Tonight's black cod entr\u00e9e and calamari appetizer were to die for. \u00a0Try the new early bird special \u00a0 A great deal."], ["Ashley D.", "The Press Bistro has a good ambiance.

We had 12 in our party and 1 check to figure out. With all the technology available (and it is available at most good restaurants) they could not give separate checks with the gratuity included on each check.

We chose the fried meatballs with garlic yogurt sauce. They were delicious and the portion was perfect for two. My entree was a half-portion of the pappardelle bolognese. The sauce could have had a bit more flavor, but it was enjoyable. My girlfriend ordered the swordfish and it was cooked to perfection. The spinach and roasted potatoes added substance to her meal and were pretty tasty as well. We ended the meal with the rest of our wine and espresso.

Chips and salsa come with your meal if it's over $5, but you only get one fill up on the chips. Salsa had a good flavor. The horchata seemed sweeter than the Mexican version, and the flavor of peanuts came through. Definitely a bolder, nuttier horchata and worth trying.The pupusas had a nice texture, and were filled with gooey, melty fillings. The cheese/jalapeno one was a little greasy but had a great flavor. The pork one was good too. I really liked the sweet tamale filled with chunks of pineapple; it was a perfect dessert.Conclusion: Salvadorian food is tasty but could quickly expand my waistline!"], ["Tacozdelengua N.", "Probably the friendliest Pupusaria in the Sacramento area.

I have has pupusas numerous times before and love them, but I have only had them from this place once and haven't had the stomach to come back. I ordered 4 bean and cheese pupusas and they looked and tasted good by all accounts, but the grease that flowed out of the pupusa when I cut into it was not good.

I must add that my Husband did like their chili verde burrito.. So if you eat meat, that's a solid winner!Atmosphere- 3/5. Nice and bright inside with lots of widows and bright nice colored paint. TVs kind of kill the mood though, and they seemed to be short staffed the day I came because with the exception of the two occupied tables, all the others were covered in the previous patrons leftovers and dishes.Service- 3/5.

I only gave this place a good score because I really enjoy their food. The pork and cheese pupusa with their slaw is really good. The service this time was horrible. The girl with the piercing on her lip was rude, impatient and lazy. She wasn't sure how the dine in chips and salsa policy worked and had to check the sign that was 8 inches from her. After checking the sign she then told my friends and I that she was not going to make more chips because that would require her to cook chips. The first time I was here, they allowed me to have a small sip of their Salvadoran Horchata because I never had it before. Excited to share the experience I was able to share it through the kindness of their other workers. However! Today I asked for a small sip for my friend because she has never had it either and the girl with the lip piercing delivered a resounding \"no\". I love food \u00a0and I love their food. I encourage \u00a0everyone who loves Latin food to try their pupusas, however I am a firm believer that bad service is enough to ruin a meal. My pupusas during my second visit were given away to another patron. During our visit there was only one other group dining in and our server managed to give away my food to another table.

Although you're not missing much, they taste like cardboard. Also only one free refill. Again the pupusas where really greasy and made me sick.

I'm not sure if it's better for brunch, but I went for dinner while visiting my brother. The parking lot in the back was pretty tight but luckily we found a space. From the parking lot, you walk through a peaceful garden and once you walk inside, you get a bright cheery feeling. The d\u00e9cor is kind of eclectic and very colorful. There are colored mosaic tiles and neat pictures and trinkets hanging all over the walls. This is really a family oriented restaurant and people from all age groups dine here, which is nice. I got their famous Monte Cristo sandwich and my brother got the fish and chips and his gf the Piags' thai steak. When the food came out, it looked pretty average. The Monte Cristo sandwich was plain and kind of dry. I wish there was more \"gooeyness\" to it - either the sandwich didn't have enough cheese or it wasn't served warm enough. When I read the description, I was thinking it would be savory and sweet, but the sweetness really wasn't there. The sandwich is sprinkled with powdered sugar but adds nothing to the overall taste. The best part was the chipotle raspberry jam. I smothered it all over my sandwich and it gave it so much more flavor. This was the most unique (and best) part of this Monte Cristo and if I were them, I'd consider putting it directly in the sandwich and serve it on the side as well. Unfortunately, I can't really speak to the other two dishes, but neither my brother nor his gf seemed particularly mind blown. Maybe they're better for brunch?"], ["Nancy D.", "I'm missing this place as I am typing my review. Oh my! Where do I start? Well they do not take reservations for brunch.

Whether you're enjoying a lovely brunch on their patio or a scrumptious dinner in their eclectic dining room, you just can't go wrong!The first thing you obviously notice is the architecture and decor of the restaurant. My niece loves to walk around to admire the colorful knick knacks. It feels like you've walked into the home of a famous world traveler and these are all his souvenirs. But enough about the decor, how's the food? Like their decor, their food is just as adventurous. For brunch, I love their simple, yet delectable french toast. At first glance, it looks like a large slab of french bread. But this unassuming dish has just the right amount of sweetness and perfect bread to egg batter ratio. Just put a little butter on it and you're good to go. It doesn't even need much syrup. The other gem on the menu is the blueberry cornmeal pancakes. It's like if cornbread had a mad affair with a blueberry muffin and this was their resulting love child. Genius! I've also had their Madame Cristo, but be prepared for defeat because this is a monster sandwich and is not easily consumed in one sitting.In the evenings, we love coming here for tapas and drinks. Their imaginative menu really taps into my faves: latin and asian flavors. We love the satay, poh pia and the ceviche tower.They also offer a Monte Cristo and a superb grilled cheese.

It comes with a side of chipotle raspberry jam, which isn't too sweet and does add a fruity punch to the meal. It's topped with over-medium eggs, yumm!- Seasonal French Toast: Probably made my entire meal that much better. It was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. The bread is decadant, fluffy and the crispy crust really makes it the best French toast in town. The seasonal fruit with the dense house made whipped cream really completed the whole \u00a0dish!-- SERVICE --Awesome wait staff!

Eager to try everything, my friends and I decided to split a plate of French toast rather than have our own plate. We still wanted room in our stomach for the rest of the menu!I got the eggs benedict which was really good, but nothing too special. They did put an exaggerated portion of their hollandaise sauce, which was a bit overwhelming. I have to say though, their side potatoes were definitely on point. They were flavorful and extra crispy.

A few specs of something apeared in the glass as well. The napkin that the utensils were placed on had specs of dirt too. The problem is due to the popularity of this place there is usually a wait. We came in about 30 minutes after opening and still had a ten minute wait for the outdoor section. No biggie. My food was filling and good except for the bland potatoes. I have such a pet peeve about bland potatoes because they're so easy to season. I couldnt finish them. I focused on my Madame Cristo. The bechamel sauce was good and I liked the french toast they make for it. I wish the chipotle raspberry sauce was offered without chipotle and there was more swiss cheese on the cristo."], ["Katia K.", "Great food, huge portions.Came for breakfast but we'll definitely be back to visit for lunch. We ordered:1) Madame Cristo - a must try because it's so unique! I loved the custard soaked toast and the chipotle raspberry jam was super good!2) Eggs Tower - their sauce was good. The English muffin was too large/thick for the eggs and ham size, so I had to cut off half the muffin. I recommend asking for no tomato, as it is distracting from the rest of the flavors. FYI: even though the potatoes look old and flavorless, they are surprisingly super delicious! Was seated quickly, despite a long line (on a Tuesday morning). The food came fast and our waitress, Melissa, was really sweet!"], ["Shawneshia H.", "Let me tell you first hand: you will wait upward of two hours to get into this place on a Sunday. The wait is somewhat worth it. Let's start with the pros:The food is fairly inexpensive for the quality. The fruit is fresh and they have fresh baked pastries and desserts. The decor is very inviting, almost a tropical feel. The customer service is superb. They Compt out first round of drinks because of a mix up. (FYI we had a party of 12).The food came out at the same time and was hot. The bacon was perfection. The French toast was popular. In my opinion it was very dense. I would recommend a half order unless u have a huge appetite. They use quality French rolls. I'm simple And prefer the simple single sliced bread. But you have to try it. The applewood sausage appeared to be over cooked as it had some char on it. But I love any sausage cooked that way. So it wasn't a problem for me.The drinks were tasty and refreshing as well.Area of improvement: Perhaps some form of appreciation for the folks waiting in line. Like 20% off a pastry or one free drink for the table. They almost lost out service. Lastly, the bill procedures. They can only split the checks twice. That's insane for a party of 12. They gave us three separate tables in which we could not eat together and treated us as if we were one table. That policy should only stand if we are all at the same table in my opinion. I would love to try them for lunch. The burgers look like they are on steroids. Guaranteed any human being that comes here will leave with a to go plate. Soo much great food for quality price."], ["Lauren R.", "A nice stop on the way from Tahoe back to the Bay Area. \u00a0Unfortunately for me, I wasn't feeling too hungry so I didn't get to order what I really wanted to eat.I ended up with the cup of black bean soup and a scoop of the tuna salad. \u00a0Both were pretty good. \u00a0I kept seeing what others were ordering and the portions seemed plentiful and fresh \u00a0If you're looking for lighter bites, you may have to opt for the combo that I went with as there weren't a lot of small plate options on the lunch menu. \u00a0There is a parking lot behind the building and they offer both indoor and outdoor seating."], ["Traci M.", "Do they really need another review? Since I have a little time as I sip on my second Americano in their lovely outdoor garden... Why not?This would have been 5 stars if they would offer pure maple syrup.I have visited twice. The first time was slightly disappointing as they didn't have pure maple syrup. I ordered an omelette special that looked better on paper then it actually tasted. Also ordered the blueberry cornmeal pancake, which I mostly enjoyed as leftovers at home with my pure maple syrup. They did offer mighty leaf teas, which I appreciated. I sat inside, and the decor was funky in an interesting and fun way.My second visit (right now), I came prepared with my own bottle of pure maple syrup. This time I sat outside in the beautiful garden. I ordered a half order of the French toast and asked for it well cooked (not too custardy texture). Also asked for side of eggs and potatoes. The potatoes portion was crazy huge. I have enough for 2 more meals at home. French toast is as good as everyone says. I'll be back with my maple syrup... Also appreciate they offer espresso drinks."], ["Mariah R.", "Ive come here on many occasions but the one that sucked the most was on my recent 21st birthday. The waitress didn't even read my ID thoroughly or she would have said happy birthday. \u00a0Goes to show you how much they actually pay attention to the laws. Anyways once you get past the 1 hour wait you can enjoy the corn chowder, Thai steak & eggs, french toast, and eggs Benedict. These are awesome dishes every time. I wouldn't order alcohol here as it's way over priced."], ["Cindy H.", "I normally would love having brunch here but I'm not sure if the chef was changed because the food hasn't been the same. I always get the eggs benedict tower (veggie style) and it would be good however just this one time it wasn't so great.. my english muffin was hard the egg was not poached. It just didn't taste great, but again maybe it just wasn't a good day for them. I do love the atmosphere especially outdoor seating and the staff is friendly."], ["Justin S.", "This review is strictly for their dinner. I did a quick Yelp search on most reviewed dinner places for my home city and Tower was the most reviewed. Most of the reviews are for breakfast/brunch. Don't go here for dinner. Their brunch is just alright too. Overhyped and not worth the wait on weekends."], ["Tawni H.", "Tower cafe is one of my favorite restaurants in Sacramento. If I ever have an occasion it is one of the first to come to mind, especially if I have someone visiting from out of town. The French toast I promise you will be the best you've ever had. With or without their seasonal fruit compote. There is no duplicating this recipe and nothing comes close. Truly legendary. I often get a normal dish (usually something I haven't tried) and a side order of the French toast. Their bloody Mary's are veryyyy yummy as well but their mild is still spicy so be careful! The restaurant itself is also very beautiful inside and out, but there is often a wait for either one. The outdoor seating has a very forest-like ambiance and with sacramento's weather it's worth the wait for the outside table."], ["Lillian H.", "Whenever I have an out of town guest, I always take them here. This is one of the nicest restaurants in Sacramento. The food is great and the ambience is just lovely. The menu has so much variety that there's something for everyone. The outdoor patio is beautiful. Lush trees and plants with a string of lights. I feel like I'm somewhere tropical. The inside is nicely decorated as well. I had the asian noodle salad. It was served cold and definitely hit the spot in the summer weather. My friend has the earth burger. If you're looking for a vegan burger that tastes kind of like meat, this isn't it. It tasted grainy and the sauce was sweet. I also really like their salads. The portions are big. None of us finished our food."], ["Allison L.", "I'm surprised i haven't written a review for Tower Cafe yet. \u00a0I've been here several times over the years as this is an iconic Sacramento spot, especially for breakfast. \u00a0With that being said, if you don't come early (before 9 on weekends), you will have to wait. \u00a0Since a lot of people ARE willing to wait, that's an indicator that it's worth trying at least once. \u00a0The restaurant isn't HUGE, but there is a lot of indoor and outdoor seating. \u00a0However, usually since it's early when I go, it's too cold to sit outside (they have heat lamps but still).As everyone knows, their french toast is legendary. \u00a0It's made with french bread and custard, so it's different than the standard. \u00a0It's big and very rich, so you can share or get a half order. Over the years I've had it so many times here and at home (you can find dupe recipes online) that I'm kinda over it. \u00a0But, if you haven't, I'd recommend it.Their denver omelet is tasty as well, but it's hard to mess up an omelet. \u00a0I'd say the best part of their breakfast is the potatoes. \u00a0They are deep fried with onions and bell peppers so they're flavorful and extremely crispy. \u00a0Sometimes, however, the potato to onion/bell pepper ratio is really off. \u00a0My boyfriend who doesn't like onions as much as I do ends up with a plate full of onions, so then I end up eating them haha. I've had their version of eggs Benedict before and did NOT like it. Their hollandaise sauce tasted like straight up mayonnaise! It was so weird! Bleck. I would not recommend. Recently, on Father's Day, I tried their huevos rancheros for the first time. \u00a0The salsa that tops the over-medium eggs is very flavorful and fresh. \u00a0The beans are tasty too. \u00a0In the future I would ask for over-easy eggs as that is my preference. \u00a0On the tables they have bottles of tobasco (which I think tastes disgusting), but they also have Tapatio available if you ask! My boyfriend always orders the all-week special that includes eggs prepared however you'd like, a choice of bacon or sausage, and potatoes. \u00a0Their food is generally tasty, but a little on the pricy side for breakfast. \u00a0Their portions are pretty generous at least. \u00a0Every time my boyfriend and I eat here, we end up in a food coma a couple hours later.They have a parking lot in the back, but it gets packed quick and the spaces are pretty small. \u00a0Be careful. \u00a0Their decoration is very worldly - if that makes sense. \u00a0They have little knick knacks from all over the world, so the restaurant is very vibrant and colorful.I've been here for dinner once several years ago, but it wasn't very memorable. \u00a0I'd stick to them for breakfast every once in a while."], ["Colette S.", "Breakfast We always come right when they open for the Madame Cristo"], ["Nina N.", "The outdoor seating is lovely. Inside has more pretty cool decorations to look at. This place has everything you ask for. Good fusion food, great dessert, friendly staff and nice ambience. While waiting, you can take a walk in the mini-garden they have on the site too"], ["Jeremy D.", "I like Tower Cafe for their hodge podge menu. \u00a0I have eaten here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the last several years. \u00a0Their service is always friendly and accommodating. \u00a0The food is typically prepared and delivered around 10 minutes. \u00a0The plates I receive are in line with the descriptive menu and the amazing taste has never failed to impress me. \u00a0Even simple foods have a slight ingredient difference that makes the dish special and appropriate for Tower Cafe.My favorites here are the Desserts and French Toast.I especially adore their eclectic decoration that equally matches their food variety.The atmosphere and food selection may not be for everyone. \u00a0But it's a staple in my book. \u00a0Give them a try and you'll know on your 1st trip if Tower is for you."], ["Michelangelo S.", "Seasonal Fare Brings Out New, Delicious FlavorsSITREPThe Tower Cafe is a mainstay on the weekend brunch landscape, but that's when I NEVER go there. \u00a0I have no desire to sit in the hot sun for 45-75 minutes to wait for a table to open up for our party of 4.However, as a quick stop for an early dinner (on this occasion Bambi and I popped over at 5pm), it was a great time.P-A-T-I-O !First off, I DO have to give a physical plant shout-out to Tower Caf\u00e9 since it has one of the nicest outdoors patios that you enjoy truly enjoy weekend brunching or mid-week early dinner (such as we do). \u00a0During the late Spring and Summer and early Autumn is when you will enjoy the \"exposure\"most. \u00a0;)THE MENUThis was Bambi's surprise-choice for dinner, and so I was happy to let her take the lead on menu decisions:* \u00a0She primarily chose what turned out to be a rather delicious Thai Steak Salad. \u00a0At medium-rare, the beef was very tender, but had a nice spicy kick to it. \u00a0The steak slices lay upon a garden of fresh lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers and other tasty produce.yelp.com/biz_photos/towe\u2026* \u00a0I primarily opted for the Asian Chicken Noodle Salad - it was a really delicious & hearty selection, and was very happy with the juicy chicken, marinated in a fresh, citrus flavored sauce & garnished with red cabbage & cashew nuts.yelp.com/biz_photos/towe\u2026We enjoyed healthy portions of each. \u00a0The Asian Noodle was $12, and the Thai Steak Salad was $14.PARKINGA nightmare. \u00a0Another reason to come early on a weekday. \u00a0The lot is configured for small cars and is shared with Tower Theater. \u00a0Got a new movie in the house, expect to park far away and may even off street.THE LOWDOWNFor a nice early dinner with fresh, tasty ingredients, I would highly recommend selections off of their seasonal menu."], ["Ninja K.", "A really fun spot to meet friends for breakfast but be sure to get there early or you'll be standing in the loooong line that goes down the block, which actually looks like a concert line.The food is average - nothing special, but the ambiance, architecture, design, and experience is great and service is also friendly. \u00a0The outside patio is also a fun place to dine and you'll find tons of free parking behind the building. This is a good place for groups and children. \u00a0If you're visiting Sacramento, this really is one of the must-dos."], ["Jean S.", "Tower has always been one of the best brunch restaurants in Sacramento. \u00a0 Even when it's over 100 degrees outside, people are willing to wait 45 mins - 1 hour in that heat for a table! Although I do like their food, there is no way I'd wait in such weather for a table anymore. \u00a0But this past weekend, I found out I can drink coffee and wait in the extremely air-conditioned Starbucks across the street! Yes, the buzzer reaches that far! That makes the wait completely bearable and actually worth it (otherwise I probably would not have eaten here). \u00a0Tower has a nice multicultural menu and decor inside the restaurant. If it's a nice day, the outdoor seating is a great option as it feels like you are eating in a garden. Their food tastes pretty good, but I wouldn't call it perfect. Here's a recap of what we ordered on the last visit here. Seasonal french toast - it's always been one of my favorite orders over the \u00a0years. The fruit on the french toast is seasonal and this time it came with white nectarine and blackberry compote. It's definitely above average and I especially like the crust on the bread, BUT it does get pretty soggy quickly from the compote and cinnamon whipped cream. Possibly you can ask for the compote and whipped cream on the side if you don't like it too soggy. The price went up to $12.95. Jaliscan Hash - Sauteed pork carnitas, potatoes, onions, bell peppers, and jalapenos and comes with two over medium eggs. This hash was quite tasty, but I wish there was more pork and less potatoes. It seemed to be potato-heavy. This was on the \"Specials\" menu so they may not offer it all the time. $14.95Thai Steak and Eggs - This skirt steak is delicious! I love the sweet plum sauce they used to marinate the steak. This also comes with a jalapeno sauce for a spicy kick. It has lots of flavor and an excellent order. $16.95East African Veggie Burger - Even though I'm not a vegetarian, I really like this burger. The patty is made of \u00a0ground peas, sweet potato, garbanzo beans, corn, and African spices. I also like the side of curry sauce it comes with. It's a good choice for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. My only complaint is that there were too many onions. After only eating half the burger, you can smell the onion breath. Other than that, pretty good! $12.95All American Burger - This burger is thick and huge! It's a 1/2 pound patty with the standard ingredients of cheese, tomato, onion, lettuce, and pickle. Although it didn't come with bacon, we added bacon for an extra 95 cents. It's pretty decent for a burger and will definitely fill you up. $10.95 by itself. Service was good. Our waitress was not overly friendly, but was polite and brought us everything we asked for...so no complaints. The portions are huge so you can either share (for smaller appetites) or prepare to take home leftovers. If you don't mind waiting for a table on the weekends, it's definitely not a bad option for brunch. Actually, it's a great restaurant for any meal of the day. I've been here several times for dinner and it's been pretty good as well. The desserts also look delicious, but I haven't had one recently."], ["Viclaire S.", "Great breakfast spot. \u00a0Took some family here after they landed at Sac airport. We yelped breakfast spots and we were not disappointed. I had the 2 French toasts full size. It was very moist, filling and delicious!!!! Best. French. Toast.

Our 9 yr old ordered the Seasonal French Toast. That is THE best french toast we have ever tasted! I tried the posole and it was great! The plate had an array of spices so I was able to spice it to my fancy, which is extra spicy. My hubby got the basic dish and his potatoes were divine.

This 25 year old restaurant (established since 1990) brings all the incredible flavor from simple to exotic dishes that your taste buds will enjoy. I've been to Tower Cafe in some numerous occasions (mostly Easter Sunday for brunch), and I have a good time to experience it.The dining experience is magnificent. The inside interior is much incredible filled with international artifacts, awards recognitions, etc. The indoor atmosphere is quite average despite the amount of crowds dining inside. On the other hand, I totally obsessed the outdoor dining garden. It's much peaceful and calming, so it's perfect for dating, family gathering, and friends gathering too. The garden is well maintained and neatly. And of course, it's easy to make dining conversations easier outside than talking indoors.Now onto the food feasting. I've ordered the Madame Cristo for a brunch meal after my spring semester finals at SCC has completely finished on 5/18/2015. The entr\u00e9e is outstandingly good. The French Toast with slices of ham is very mouthful and flavorful that I can taste the sweetness of the bread. The bechamel cream is also tasty too including the chipotle-raspberry jam. Very spicy yet very fruity for that jam. Finally, the baked potato slices tasted alright unless if added salt; it's a close good foodie add on.The service can be hit-n-miss depending when your drinks and the food will arrive. So far, these employees are friendly and approachable for me.In the end, Tower Cafe is definitely the best restaurant in the Sacramento area! A must visit!

I can't remember if it is because I read about it somewhere or someone recommended this to me.Parking lot is large and free but almost full. We found a spot on the other side of the same city block of this restaurant. That's how many people are trying to get into this restaurant. OK, I exaggerate. I'm sure customers from nearby businesses use this parking area as well.When I arrived at the front, I discovered how truly busy they were: At least 15 people were standing on the sidewalk or sitting on their benches waiting to be seated. I think they were part of 2 or 3 large groups and that is why it is taking longer for them to get seated. I say this because after I signed my name in, we asked to use the restroom and by the time we got out, our table (for 4) was ready.They have an indoor dining area that reminded me of a colorful Mexican restaurant.The outdoor dining area is beautifully shaded by trees and section off by bushes. Unfortunately, when we were there, the incessant mini-explosions of the jackhammer from the construction project nearby made our dining experience less than ideal. It's obviously not the restaurant's fault, but man that was harsh.Pricking Prawn - is very very good. But you must eat it when it just came out of the kitchen.

Wow that's certainly a milestone as it's tough for restaurants or any business to make it past a year let along 25 years!!! On top of their comment that they were celebrating it on Earth Day and giving one order of seasonal French Toast per table to the first 25 tables. They mentioned they open up at 8 AM.Well you know what that means! I'm there with my Hubby! \u00a0I love, love, love their French toast as it is so very Special. \u00a0I usually order a half order as the first time I ordered an entire order. OMG TDF!!! It was way too much food for me! Actually this was the first time I ordered the Seasonal French Toast. \u00a0It was so yummy with the cinnamony whipped cream like ice cream topped over the super sweet strawberries, blueberries and blackberries on a slice of their humongous infamous french toast that is custard filled and do I need to say more??? Why aren't you there right now???It was cray as we got to Tower Cafe super early this morning! My HB and I saw Fox 40 news van parked close by. \u00a0I said to myself is this going to be on the news? \u00a0Next thing you know Gary from Fox 40 was interviewing their fabulous Tower Cafe crew of people, waitress and me! OMG! \u00a0Gary was a good sport and super sweet guy. \u00a0I was born & raised in Sacramento plus so familiar with Tower records, drugstore and theater that Tower Cafe is an monumental restaurant, one of a kind and a staple in Sacramento that if you are visiting Sacramento, this is the restaurant you must come, visit and eat!There is plenty of free parking and one can eat outdoors in their wonderfully landscaped patio filled with many plants, flowers and trees. \u00a0I even caught a pic of their water fountain too. \u00a0I used to work at UCDMC. Tower Cafe is located right in the middle between where I worked and where I grew up in Old Land Park. My favorite dinner meal is their Monte Cristo which they utilize the french toast sandwich with ham and cheese, baked and then there is powdered sugar on the outside. It is served with chipotle raspberry jam. So Yummy! \u00a0I have had their santa fe salmon too and that's delish too. This morning on top of the Seasonal french toast I ordered the Eggs Tower which is like their eggs benedict and my HB ordered their Portabella Toscana omelette. \u00a0We had so much food this morning that we had to take it to go but everything was so delicious. \u00a0Certainly one of the best restaurants I know in town that deserves recognition for being so generous with food!

There are 2 Unisex bathrooms which are also clean and adorably decorated!I would highly recommend this restaurant, especially for brunch or lunch; and for friends, couples or dates."], ["Rebecca K.", "I usually go here for desserts but this time I tried some of their entrees. I never had their burger before and it was amazing. The portion was enough to feed two people and it was packed with flavor. I love the atmosphere and the staff are real friendly. Parking is plentiful and you won't have a hard time finding a space. I love that this place stays open late enough so that I can get some desserts. Definitely recommend giving this place a try!"], ["Rockne H.", "On a short trip up to Sacramento to visit some friends, we were introduced to this place by some of the locals in our circle. From what I was told, the French Toast was the way to go...Walking up to this location, you'll notice the VERY eclectic vibe this joint gives off. Buddha statues, iron arch ways to the garden, colorful tiling really brings out the personality. When you go indoors, you'll notice the same type of theme. It's like chaos truly brings some kind of order. It works! The only challenging situation that happened here was with the hostess. We originally got sat for a party of 5. Like many other parties out there, we had a last minute addition to our party making it 6. The hostess came back to our table and gave us a lot of attitude because they were busy. It immediately escalated when she rolled her eyes at us. I apologize for the wrench in your day, however, this situation happens to a lot of folks out there and it was an honest mistake. Reacting in a sassy way, may have not been the best decision on her part, but it certainly did not ruin the meal!For brunch, I got a couple of plates to try:-Famous French Toast for $12.95 - 2 HUGE slices of French bread soaked in their secret style custard and topped with butter. OH - EM - GEE! This was THE BEST French toast I've ever had in my life. Talk about a \u00a0decadent and flavorful dish. Dense and delicious. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!-Egg Tower for $13.95 - Their take on the benedict. English muffin, tomato, ham and poached egges with hollandaise. This dish was also served with seasoned potatoes. Definitely a good dish. They made a great hollandaise and it really tied every flavor nicely. I'm so glad I got to experience this place! The service was excellent (less the hostess incident), our servers were super accommodating and really personable. When I'm back in the area, I will certainly return for another round of the amazing French toast!"], ["Jennie C.", "I came here on Friday, 10/23, and that will be the last time I ever go back. \u00a0I got there at 11:05 am and they told us that they will not be serving breakfast anymore except french toast and bacon. \u00a0I was bummed out but decided to give their lunch a chance.1. They refused to give us a menu. \u00a0They said that this was their process. \u00a0Even though we acknowledged that we would not be able to order until 11:30 and requested to just look over the menu, still we got no menus and was assured that someone would bring us menus at 11:30.2. \u00a0We ordered a half order of french toast which came out in literally 2 minutes. \u00a0The plate was very hot, so you know it was extra that they had made and was sitting under a heat lamp. \u00a011:35 rolls around and still we got no menus. \u00a0I look at the table that go sat next to us and they got menus. \u00a0I'm not sure if Tower Cafe has taken a step down on their customer service since they're so popular in Sac, but definitely disappointed by this whole experience and won't be returning."], ["Lo D.", "Came here on Tuesday for some drinks between lunch & dinner , they were only serving beverages , soup & dessert at that time . The service was nice in the beginning but after we were done we sat there for 15 minutes waiting for our server to bring us out check . We sat outside & it was absolutely BEAUTIFUL !!! You can hear the fountain (on side of building) and you sit between trees & plants very relaxing with lights throughout all the trees ! Came back on Friday night for date night with the boyfriend . Service was way better !!! Came around 10 pm & sat outside again , waited maybe 2 min for our server to come to us . I had the florentine ravioli ; BEST RAVIOLI IVE EVER HAD !!!!!! & my boyfriend had one of their burgers . Good was AWESOME . But be careful . They charge you for aoli (sp) sauce on the side to dip your fries . Had the blackberry mango iced tea so delicious ! The outside was even more beautiful with all the lights on!!Very happy about our dinner date here ! Will definitely be back ! They only lost 1 star due to our server the first time & the charging of sauce for the second time !"], ["Yoon S.", "Tower Cafe was one of the best decisions during my road trip from east coast. I was craving solid brunch for a while and the eggs benedict and french toast at Tower Cafe delivered! The eggs benedict melts in your mouth. The \u00a0cheesiness combined with perfect seasoning will make anyone happy. The french toast is so soft and fluffy that you cannot stop eating it once you start. Definitely a must-try! I wish I tried the seasonal french toast with fruit and other toppings, but the original did the job (and boy, it made me full!). It's a funky decor with plenty of seating. If i'm ever back in Sacramento, you can expect to see me here for a weekend brunch!"], ["Yai B.", "You wanna go somewhere with your family to eat? This is the perfect place!

So my dog and I sat and waited for about a half hour in front of where the hostess was standing.When my buzzer went off to notify me that a table was available, the hostess then decided that the time had come to tell me that no dogs were allowed, even on the patio.Kind of a bummer, the food looked good from where I was sitting."], ["Mildred H.", "Oh man...I've been here twice and had a good experience both times! *I'm a huge breakfast girl and I find their breakfast incredibly delicious! Hey, I'm of moving to Sac just for this"], ["Will N.", "Tower Caf\u00e9 is one of my favorite brunch spots in Sacramento! It's typically packed during brunch hours on the weekend. The wait can be as long as an hour wait! But at least they have benches and nice scenery nearby. You have the option of picking and waiting for an indoor seating or an outdoor seating. Try to eat outdoor if you can! It's a really beautiful with plenty of trees, bushes and flowers. The only times I do eat indoor is during the scorching summer times because they have fans and air conditioning (there was this one time that their air conditioning broke down and I was just melting inside lol). The other time I eat indoor is when my allergies are acting up.Their employees are awesome! Very attentive! I don't need to flag one down to request something. My waiter, Ruben, was constantly coming by to check up on us, refill my drink, make sure that I was satisfied with my order.I have tried their Famous French Toast, Seasonal French Toast, and Madame Cristo. Their Famous French Toast is what they are well known for! The bread is dipped in their house made custard and topped with butter. Delicious, not too sweet, and can be filling! Their Madame Cristo is a spice up of their Famous French Toast. They basically stuff their Famous French Toast with sliced ham and swiss cheese. The Madame Cristo is my favorite/go-to order! I recently tried their Seasonal French Toast. It's their Famous French Toast with seasonal fruit compote. The waiter warned me that it may be too sweet for some people. He advised that If I'm unsure whether I can handle the sweetness or not, that I should get the fruit compote on the side so I can adjust the amount of sweetness to my preference. I'm glad that he told me because it was really sweet.Their brunch keeps me coming back. I will be back soon to try other things on their menu!"], ["Sarah K.", "Horrible horrible customer service by the MANAGER!! Waiters were very professional but not the manager. Usually when a customer talks the manager about an issue during a meal, the manager smooths things over and makes the customer feel important and valued so they at least don't leave pissed. But this manager became defensive and basically ended the conversation with, \"well we've been here 20 years and we don't need to do things differently.\" And then he walked away leaving a table of 6 totally pissed."], ["Joy H.", "Holy good food! Pay attention to the those items marked spicy on the menu because they are and are good but if you don't like spice, find something else. Don't let the line to get a table scare you, staff is fast and friendly and turn tables quickly. Lots of options on the menu and potions are worth sharing. I already know what I will have next visit...and the time after that."], ["Amir N.", "One of the best breakfast places in Sacramento. They do have a lunch/dinner menu but I haven't ever been here for any other reason than breakfast. The outdoor seating area is the best. Nestled within a lot of greengage and trees there are tables and ample seating. If it gets too cold, the staff lights up the space heaters which does a great job of keeping the area warm. The coffee and bloody Mary's are delicious every time and as far as the breakfast goes, anything can be modified and made to order per your liking. Personally I'm a creature of habit so I stick with the eggs, bacon and potatoes. The omelets and French toast are next in the list though."], ["Heidi H.", "I came here with a friend on a Wednesday evening for dinner. \u00a0I never even knew this place was open for dinner! I thought it was a breakfast/brunch only kinda place. \u00a0I have only been one time before for brunch on a weekend and it was so busy and I don't remember much of anything else. \u00a0So needless to say it was nice to come back and enjoy the place. \u00a0My friend treated me to dinner and showed me a whole new side to the place. I never saw the foundation or the walkways lines with benches before and the patio area was amazing! We sat outside and it was amazing how relaxing and cozy it is under all the trees. \u00a0Your \u00a0pretty much right on the street but you didn't even hear the traffic and you soon forget and get caught up in the ambiance of the tree canopy above you. \u00a0When it gets dark they have colored lighted metal lanterns on strings that they turn on as well. \u00a0But anyway let get to the food. My friend got the ravioli dish and I got the Earth Burger which was fabulous and so big I could only eat half. \u00a0The nut burger was flavorful but didn't stay together too well but I was very happy they had that choice of a homemade vegetarian burger option that wasn't bean based (they do offer one of those as well) I didn't care for the curry sauce on the burger itself but it was a good sauce just didn't work for me with the burger itself. \u00a0The fries were very good and I asked for ranch but they said they didn't have ranch. What?! Ok well give me something similar cause I just don't do ketchup. \u00a0I just wanted something for my fries so they brought me some creamy sauce I cannot remember what they called it but they took so long to bring it my fries were cold my then (hence the lost star). The sauce was very good and worked on the burger very well flavor wise too. \u00a0You must go by the dessert case too and at least look. \u00a0Its conveniently located on the way to the ladies room so you can't help but look we ended up taking two pieces of carrot cake home and it was very good! Moist and not heavy the cream cheese frosting was light and had a little lemony taste. \u00a0It wasn't overly sweet either. Overall I enjoyed my trip here and glad my friend reintroduced me to a place that I was not properly introduced to in the past."], ["Breanne B.", "Came here on a Thursday morning to get breakfast with a friend who I just picked up at the airport. She got the season french toast (or whatever the one with apples) & I got the eggs benedict. Although I did enjoy my breakfast, I did wish I had ordered the french toast instead. The cinnamon whipped cream was amazing - I kept eating it off her plate. Will definitely be back, great service & food!"], ["Lily M.", "Oh Tower Cafe, I so wanted to give you 5 stars!The environment is absolutely amazing. Artsy, modern, fun, and an altogether great vibe! I was also extremely impressed by the veg*n options offered on the menu! The service, though? Quite average, if not slow. They weren't extremely busy, but both our servers seemed to ignore us. When we finally got our food, my partner and I were split on our opinions. He was in heaven with his hamburger and fries; whereas, I was almost unable to finish my veggie burger. I couldn't place why I disliked it, but maybe it was just too \"out there\" for my tastebuds. All of those little things plus a rather pricy bill, and I had to knock a star off.Sidenote: Thumbs up for gender-neutral restrooms!"], ["Charlotte S.", "This is more about the ambiance. The food is pretty good, but can definitely be on the mediocre side.The service can also be extremely slow, even when thee isn't a crowd. It has taken me up to an hour and a half to get my food.However, they do have authentic, exotic food. Unfortunately, it is all EXTREMELY pricey."], ["Megan S.", "I am a first timer to this place and tried it out based on the stellar YELP reviews.Arrived at around 10:40AM on a Sunday, pleasantly surprised to find out brunch was being served until 3PM. Wait time was about 35-40 minutes for a table, but the wait was well worth it. They had ample seating in the outdoor garden area and customers could grab beverages inside while they waited for a table.Ordered the Eggs tower with Advocado and the Madame Cristo with a side of bacon. The eggs tower was divine, the hollandaise sauce they use is superb. The poached eggs were cooked to perfection. The \u00a0tomato added great flavor. The portion was ample and I ended up only being able to finish one of the egg towers.(Yay for leftovers)The Madame Cristo was AMAZING. It was the perfect blend of sweet with the chipolte raspberry jam. The mixture of the ham, eggs, and swiss stuffed into French Toast is a delicious combination. Highly recommended item!This place is YUMMY. Good coffee too. You may have to wait a little while for a table, but good things come to those who wait! :-)"], ["Sadaf S.", "Dinner was amazing and their Florentine Ravioli was seriously out of this world!!!I really was dying to try this place out for brunch, but unfortunately it didn't live up to its dinner in terms of taste. The French Toast wasn't phenomenal like other reviewers said. I may have tried it on an off day. It definitely is a very large portion and perfect for two people!"], ["Jenny P.", "I recently came here for brunch and had what might have been the best eggs benny of all time. And that is my favorite dish. I order it everywhere. My bloody mary was too peppery, but still excellent. I really dug the heaping portions at this place and the prosecco mimosas. Mmm. We didn't wait long, but there were only two of us, and willing to sit outside. I imagine larger parties would have a harder time of it. The decor inside is so much fun! It's just a mishmash cluster of fun items, and the outdoor seating is very pleasant. Like Rainforest Cafe without the gimmicky animals. They've got space heaters for cold mornings and when ours wasn't functioning properly, we asked a server and he had someone fix it right away. Very polite, efficient servers in the patio area.I would have given it five stars if not for the meat bees in the outdoor area. I know it can only be helped so much, but there was a definite handful of them, and that would suck if someone happened to be allergic. Or just a huge baby.

I'm going to start off my day here at tower cafe for brunch. The parking here sucks. It's small and cranked. I seen two cars back up and try to get out 5 different times. Other cars wouldn't even back up, they just stay there. At night this walk way scared me. Someone could be sitting on the benches they have for people to sit at while waiting to be seated, and it startles me because I couldn't see the person. It's cold right now but thankfully there are heat lamps everywhere so people don't mind sitting indoors or out. The building is so huge, but it feels stuffy and cramped from all of the decorations and displays they put inside of the restaurant, but it is nice to look at.I've been here before on my birthday last year. I ordered the French toast and a Bellini to drink. I was mad because the French toast was a long bread and a ball of butter on top. But when I ate it, it was really good. I was really impressed. Today I ordered the seasonal salmon omelet. The omelet was flat over the salmon. On top was a ball of goat cheese. On the side there were country potatoes with onions and bell peppers. Taste: I did not like the goat cheese, it was too heavy and tasted weird to me. The texture wasn't something I liked. Salmon was salmon I love salmon but the fish was a bit salty. I love the egg though. Country potatoes were good. My friends chorizo con huevos were good though. People love this place and I know how good it can be. I enjoyed my food before but today the goat cheese was not good to me.Would I come back? Of course. I like the uniqueness of this place, the atmosphere, and brunch here is great."], ["Rhina C.", "As always and never fails, still my favorite place for breakfast/brunch. Great food!

It seems like there is always a line during brunch on Sundays and Saturdays. I went on a Saturday and it was quite lengthy. I ordered a mimosas (sorry they don't offer bottomless) and it hit the spot with my perfectly made eggs benedict which goes by Eggs Tower.

Everything from the FOOD, ambiance, decors to the servers just made my experience very enjoyable. \u00a0 I ordered the thai steak salad and the mushroom Omelet. \u00a0The thai steak salad was amazingly delicious! \u00a0I savor every orgasmic bite. \u00a0(Ohhh how I'm salivating as I'm typing). \u00a0 I can't wait to reunite you...

To die! They also have a full service bar, as well as a small pastry bakery with amazing creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. \u00a0Their lunch is just as eclectic but having a kind of Caribbean/Mexican fusion theme throughout. \u00a0I give dock one star just because most of the times I've been, the service has taken a VERY long time..."], ["Kim B.", "As always great service and fair prices.

It's great for casual and romantic dates since the surround outdoor area is filled w/ vines, trees and lots of lights/string-lights. I also love it's calm atmosphere every time I visit. I've been here a few times, but only for dessert and I can tell you their tiramisu is to die for. Service was always good, the waiters/waitress're always friendly and patient.

They have their own parking lot in the back, so that's not a problem at all."], ["Patty R.", "Not sure why this place is so popular.

Service is fast but seating takes a while. Overall not a fan and probably never going back."], ["Alex L.", "I was far less impressed than the multitudes who praise Tower as the best brunch in Sacramento. For me, there are much better options in both tastiness and service with about 1/10th of the wait time. I can see Tower's appeal though, especially since it's such a historic and well known venue. If you scan through the reviews, people will praise the French toast. Maybe it was just too much hype, but to me the dish was soggy and sickeningly sweet. The special batter that gives their version its signature flavor was the taste equivalent of melted ice cream. Add in gobs of butter and syrup and you have a rich dessert. For some, that's worth the wait. For me, it was just a stomach ache waiting to happen. Furthermore, the service on the weekend we came in for brunch was just atrocious. Mixed up orders, some cold food and a server who was almost completely MIA and overwhelmed. If you're waiting 20 minutes or longer for a table, you want to feel like it's a special experience when you finally sit down. Our meal felt like a rush job at best. Tower Cafe has a reputation as one of the most popular places to eat in Sacramento, especially for tourists and those unfamiliar with other offerings.

My plate just looked sad and underwhelming. \u00a0Dry all round and deeply unsatisfying. \u00a0Two final insults:1- their water tasted absolutely disgusting. \u00a0It may be presented in a fancy bottle but the aftertaste is foul. \u00a02- they add a service fee to your bill for the \"kitchen staff\". \u00a0Wtf?! \u00a0This double-dipping takes the absurdity of our tip-happy society to a whole other level. \u00a0How about paying your staff a decent wage instead of passing on even more additional costs to customers already paying overinflated prices.BFF warned me that this place would be frou-frou. \u00a0I don't mind a bit of frou if ultimately the overall quality and experience justifies the silliness, but this place absolutely did not."], ["Sina R.", "Started off with the caprese salad, delectably intriguing.Then had the pork belly dish. \u00a0As the waitress mentioned it's like meat butter. \u00a0Perfectly seasoned and it truly melted. \u00a0Finished up dinner with the ginger ice cream sandwich...another home run! \u00a0Friends ordered the steak which looked great, but hard to sway away from the pork belly dish...Great service & the owner Ed was fantastic. \u00a0Definitely will be back with friends."], ["Shani M.", "I look forward to dining at Magpie Cafe whenever I am in Sacramento and have been known to travel the 40 miles from home just to go there with friends and family.

I recently went there for brunch and it was bad from beginning to end. When we walked in, we were asked by the hostess if we would like to sit inside or out. It was a beutiful Sunday morning so we told her that we would like to sit outside, so she said ok, grabbed some menus, and proceeded to seat us. Instead of takin us to the patio, she walked right passed the door and took us to a booth inside and said that it looked like all of the tables on the patio were dirty so \"here's a booth.\"A couple people had mimosas with their brunch and they were brought out at obviously different levels. (like one would be half as full as another)The food was sub-par and one person had to send it back because it was full of egg shell. I had asked for bacon because I was such a fan of the chunks of pork belly I become accustomed to at the other location, but apparently they don't have that anymore \"due to shortages from the supplier.\" This definitely should be something mentioned at the time of ordering, not after the food has come. Every time an issue came up, we would mention it, but they were all responded with excuses.I could bring up a few more shortcomings, but complaining takes too much energy and it's just not worth it to me.The bottom line is: Magpie used to be my favorite brunch spot in Sacramento. I would go out of my way to bring new customers and spread the word about how great it was. (emphasis on WAS). Now it is easily my least favorite spot and I will not be returning. In addition, I will be making every effort to let everyone I know that brunches downtown to avoid this pathetic new location."], ["K H.", "I always liked their food.

Not only can we count on some of the delicious meals that started at O.G. Mag, the kitchen is trying new things like chicken and waffles and a burger. I was excited to try their new cocktails and expanded wine and beer list.I will continue to be a regular. The new space is big, and open, yet still reminiscent of the O.G.The wait last Friday night was worth it! Regarding the kitchen tip line, treat it like the regular tip line-OPTIONAL. Also, if you're confused you can ask your waiter. Magpie has been a longtime family owned business that prides itself on not just the food, but how they treat employees. The kitchen tip line is one way to enhance the income of the kitchen staff the respect and depend on."], ["Bauer L.", "I used to go to the old location on R st quite often. My experience at the new 16 Powerhouse location was absolutely abysmal and I will never come back. First, we were seating indoors since it was starting to get chilly outside and the waitress seats us at a table soaking wet with scraps of trash all over the place. She wipes it down but it's still leaving a sticky residue so we ask her to wipe it again later and she rolls her eyes and reluctantly does it. Service here would be a Zero if possible and not for this reason alone. I ordered the burger. Way overpriced for what you get and it tasted like a normal burger from any of the other 100 places on the grid. Service was slow between drink ordering and food delivery and they weren't even close to full capacity. I won't be back. The rest of my party was having their 1st Magpie experience and they agree, this place sucks. Adios Magpie and good luck, you're gonna need it."], ["A O.", "We all know this used to be my favorite spot for a tasty treat so I was excited to try out their new location today.

Really lacked flavor and even the presentation that Magpie has been famous for all these years. Let's hope it was just opening jitters. (But in my book, if you're not serving quality from the get-go, then why open at all? Have a couple weeks of soft openings first.)Then there's the extra tip for the kitchen staff. Seriously Magpie? Pay a living wage to the people that work for you and reflect it in the cost of our meals. Thankfully, our server was outstanding and saved the day, almost apologizing for the tip on the bill.We'll go back. But Magpie needs to work out the kinks.

So please don't let any comments on that strategy concern you. Personally, I could have figured out any number of graceful workarounds, but am pleased not to have to make the effort. It rather pleases me to think of the staff sharing the proceeds of the tips in some teamwork-y fashion.And I would not doubt that this is the case, because we were treated so attentively and cheerfully when we came to the new Magpie for an early supper. Plus, the waitpersons laughed at my little jokes, which is always a plus for me. We had the classic Magpie lemon chicken salad and it was as good as ever, with its crisp greens, tender chicken, and light citrus dressing. Did it always have paperthin slices of fennel on top? It did last night-- lovely.And the chocolate/avocado mousse was wonderful. The new location is handsome and roomy. I can hardly wait for the winter months, when I will be so ready to dig into one of Magpie's pasta dishes-- the absolute delicious-est thing I have eaten in Sacramento since I moved back here from Berkeley.Yay indeed!"], ["Staci S.", "LOVE this place!!! I've been here a couple times for breakfast, brunch and lunch. Their food is exceptional. The service is solid. I can't wait to check out the new location!"], ["Patsy O.", "I was so excited about trying the new Magpie Cafe. \u00a0Let me start off by saying that Magpie is one of my favorite restaurants and one of the best in Sacramento. \u00a0This review is based on my one recent experience only. \u00a0I plan to continue going to Magpie as often as possible. \u00a0 The new space is beautiful. \u00a0It has the same vibe as the old place, but it is newer and more modern... more sleek. \u00a0My only comment on this location is a similar problem I had at the original location: \u00a0It is too noisy. \u00a0There are so many hard surfaces that the voices and sounds are too loud. \u00a0It would not be a good place to have a nice conversation because you need to raise your voice a bit in order to be heard. \u00a0I noticed there are some sound baffles hanging from the ceiling, but I wish there were more. \u00a0The wood chairs make a loud noise when moved around on the concrete floors similar to chalk on a chalkboard. \u00a0A suggestion would be to add rubber knobs on the feet in order to soften the sound. \u00a0This annoyance, however, would not prevent me from returning. \u00a0But if I wanted a quiet dining experience, I might choose somewhere else. \u00a0 The reason for giving a two-star rating for this visit is based solely on the new hamburger. \u00a0Yelp describes a two-star as \"meh. I've experienced better.\" \u00a0A three-star would be \"A-OK.\" \u00a0Well, my burger was \"meh. \u00a0I've experienced better.\" \u00a0For $15 you get a very tall, artistically beautiful bacon cheese burger with your choice of fries or a salad. \u00a0While it looks fantastic, it is actually difficult to eat that huge burger. \u00a0Once you pick it up you can't put it down or else it will fall apart all over the place. \u00a0As I took my first bite, I noticed the bun was dry. \u00a0The meat didn't have much flavor, and the cheese wasn't fully melted. \u00a0It was kind of cold. \u00a0With all the high-quality ingredients they used, I would expect a better final product. \u00a0I'm hoping this was unusual for that day and when I return again, my hamburger will be better. \u00a0 Everything else we had was as good as the old location... especially the ice cream sandwich!  \u00a0 Beware, upon receiving your check, you will be asked to consider the usual tip for your server PLUS the new option of adding a tip for the back-of-house. \u00a0This left me pretty confused. \u00a0Tips for servers have become customary, and we are made to feel guilt if we don't give the mandatory tip and feel cheap if we don't pay a high enough percentage. \u00a0Are we to now accept tips for the kitchen staff to become customary too? \u00a0The whole debate on tips is too big and complicated to thoroughly discuss here. \u00a0I appreciate that many kitchen workers do exceptional work and most are not paid a generous wage to do the job they were hired for. \u00a0It was a bit awkward for the server to ask us to pony up for the kitchen staff. \u00a0Whatever your thoughts are, just be forewarned that you will need to decide this when you pay your bill."], ["Katherine B.", "The new location is certainly a new look for Magpie but they did an impeccable job of keeping the same feel and good food. I've fortunately been able to visit the new location a couple times and only have good things to say. \u00a0Still would say it's one of the best restaurants in sac. After reading some of the negative reviews, it's unfortunate that some people had a bad experience but sometimes the kinks have to get worked out when you move to a newer and larger space. I only had positive experiences and amazing food at the new place. For brunch I had the usual breakfast plate which was good as always. Another person in our party had the fruit and yogurt and it was amazing!! The kitchen tip on the bill is something to get used to but I commend magpie for trying something different. Seems some people don't fully understand that the kitchen tip is optional and find it offensive. I didn't have any problem with it and gave them a couple dollars. The food is always superb at magpie and didn't have any problem showing the staff some love."], ["Calloway C.", "We love, love, love the new location! Much mor space and awesome decor! There was a shirt wait for brunch but that is to be expected on a Sunday afternoon. We tried a breakfast platter (scrambled eggs, white and purple potatoes, thick cut bacon, and grilled veggies) AND the Chicken N Waffle. The platter was good, I could have did without the veggies. The bacon was very delicious! My only complaint is that the baguette was not edible... If toasted lightly and served with a homemade jam it would have been a wonderful accompaniment. My husband asked if the chicken was made with love and the waffle was wonderful as well. We ended with a HUGE homemade Ice Cream Sandwich that was to die for! Our server was quite delightful as well!"], ["Susan F.", "I went to the original location one time for brunch, which was amazing and I have always wanted to try Magpie's lunch. My coworkers and I decided to try out the new location for lunch during the week. First Impression: Not so good. This Magpie has you place your order and pay at the counter before receiving your food. The bill includes a line for tipping the server and the kitchen staff. I don't know about you, but I only tip after I receive my food and service. Also, tipping the kitchen staff is a new thing for me and I'm not sure how I feel about it. More money is coming out of my pocket unless I adjust the tip for the server. It put a bad taste in all of our mouths before we even received our food.Service: Not Stellar/Not horrible.The Food: I split the trout sandwich and lemon chicken salad with my coworker. Delicious, but fortunately we didn't clean my plate like we thought, because there was a little extra protein wiggling on it! The manager was apologetic and compensated us for my meal. She also gave us an ice cream sandwich on the house, which was nice, but there has to be a better process for cleaning the lettuce! I know the food is fresh, but this is a little too fresh for me. I am sad to say, I will never go Magpie again. :("], ["Margo R.", "Love the new place. Great location, great ambience, same great food.Had a very nice lunch today.

For brunch, I usually go with the breakfast plate (great bacon) or granola. Lunch time is busy but new location has 50% more seating and nice outdoor patio area made out of redwood trees previously onsite. For lunch, I recommend the burger, soup/salad, turkey sandwich, or a special like the caprese or fried chicken sandwich. For dinner, I like the Ahi Tuna and vegetable plate. I like what Magpie is doing with tipping too. I've heard other respected restaurants might do the same soon and the trend has started in bigger cities. They explain how tipping is always voluntary but now you can leave whatever you feel like specifically for the back of house kitchen folks. The bar is beautiful. I recommend the old fashioned and picking the bartenders' brains. The list of \"well drinks\" is pretty impressive."], ["K K.", "This review is based on my to-go order.

It's payday, and what do people like me do on payday, not pay bills but spend it on food. \u00a0This salad is truly worth every penny. \u00a0Flavors on point.

It's different from the paella I'm use to from Barcelona to SF & LA. But we haven't had Basque paella yet, so perhaps that's why? It is still good though. The rice is not as yellow, it comes with a whole lot of veggies that I wouldn't expect & a little more liquidity than I'm use to. A whole bunch of seafood in a beautiful presentation. The portion size to me is huge. The menu said good for two. If you're Asian, get a 3rd person to help out. We had a good amount left over, which should make for a good lunch the next day. =)-Calamari (4.5*) in a tomatoe based sauce. Excellent dish. Very delicious. Calamaries were tender & fresh.

It's only two of us so we only ordered one appetizer figure the entry would be enough for us. And it was. I'd say Paella Valenciana was not impressive, maybe my expectation is little higher.

I attempted to make a reservation online, and there were no times available. I quickly called the restaurant, and they were able to make a reservation for the time I had requested (6:30). The three of us showed up at 6:30 p.m., and it was a little unusual to enter in the restaurant. Was not sure whether we even entered in through the right door and we stood around waiting to see if we had to be seated. It wasn't until I went up to one gentleman and told him we had a reservation, then we were seated right away.Coming from a Spanish background, and my family cooking very delicious food, it is difficult to go to any restaurant, let alone one that cooks many of the same dishes I eat at home. I ordered their Sangria, which I thought was a bit off for my personal palette. We ordered two tapas: the costillas and the gambas (a la mexicana). They both were very good and I had no doubt that the rest of the food would be delicious. The costillas were very flavorful, similar to ones that my family makes at home. The gambas or shrimp, were grilled and topped with a version of salsa fresca, but with olives.Then we decided, with some reluctance, to order the Paella Mixta. Any restaurant in the U.S. or Spain I feel has never made it as good as my family does. The waiter said that it is very popular and well-liked. We ordered, and it seemed it was not the right color or flavor. Could have been more \"bright\" in color and flavor. The chicken pieces were underwhelming and so were some of the other ingredients. Overall, I would definitely recommend the tapas to share and not get anything too large. We were full from just the tapas when the paella arrived. I liked the overall ambiance, though I think the service could have been even better. There was something a bit off. Not sure if I will come back again, but if I do, I will just go for the tapas."], ["Stan L.", "Great experience. Walked in, and was seated (for two people) within 5 minutes -- although the physical location of the host was not very clear. Ordered 4 tapas: portobello mushroom, lamb skewer, braised pork, and cod fish. The portions are good, so for two people, 4 tapas, and one dessert definitely put us over the top. You could just order three tapas and a dessert, and that would probably be enough. But we wanted to try everything!Our favorite was the portobello mushroom and the cod fish.Portobello mushroom came with cheese (I forgot which kind). The juice from the mushroom together with the cheese was so full of flavor, with just two ingredients. Definitely surprised and highly recommended. The cod fish was served on top of a bed of greens, which complemented nicely. Fish was cooked and seasoned \u00a0just right. Might be on the salty side for some folks, but it was fine if you ate it with the greens.The lamb and the pork were just OK for us. Both meats were fully cooked, made it kind of tough to eat. But they were both quite tasty.They kept refilling our bread basket, which was delicious with their special bean dip. But save some of the bread to go with the tapas.We got the dessert, forgot what it was called. But came with slides of plain cake soaked in some kind of dessert wine, topped with fresh fruits and drizzled with syrup. Not too bad with coffee, but I'd personally like it more if there were some kind of cream filling.Definitely recommended."]], "Ten22": [["Kevin G.", "Ten22 has consistently been one of the best places for a nice lunch or dinner in Sacramento. \u00a0It is never busy and always had outstanding staff. \u00a0Food has always been great."], ["Greg R.", "For the first time ever we decided to try Thanksgiving out. My wife has had a horrible couple months and I did not want her to cook or clean or worry about dinner. I had heard good things about this restaurant and the fixed price menu looked good. I made reservations weeks in advance and asked for a quiet table preferably a booth. We arrived and were seated in the middle of the restaurant at an open table. The place was cold and drafty and service was poor. Dinner was overall bad! The lamb was very smoky and inedible so I sent it back and got the turkey. The turkey was dry and the potatoes cold and beans over salted. It took forever to get our waitresses attention. We did not want to stay for dessert.

Not only was the food amazing, we enjoyed the mist in the outdoor area. We got here around 6pm and it was still pretty damn hot. They turned the mist on for most of our dinner and it made the dinner just so much more enjoyable. I was just lounging in the cool air.

Not sure where the waitress would dissappear off to. The watermelon basil salad was quite refreshing. I asked for a medium steak and got it rare. :( not worth the $38. boyfriend ordered duck and it was quite flavorful. \u00a0Mom ordered lamb and the wine and mint overpowered the lamb taste.

Not to mention the food came out cold and whatever herbs were smothered into the meatballs of the shepherds pie was soooooo overwhelming and did not go well with the sauce AT ALL.The pineapple chicken pizza was kind of a bust too. The bread portion was good, but way too much canned bbq sauce. Wayyyy to much, and little to no chicken.Overall, service was eh.

If you do not know what a rillette is, it really is similar to p\u00e2t\u00e9 but is more chewy as the meat is usually shredded. Wonderful dish.My second course was the Grass Fed NY Steak (with garlic mashed potatoes, and green beans). Nicely cooked (medium rare), well seasoned, and oh-so-tender! Loved it.For dessert, I ordered the Chocolate Mouse Cake. Extremely rich in chocolate content and moist. Solid and tasty.Overall, I was not disappointed. The food was on point and well concocted. I enjoyed my meal.+ ServiceService was good. Nothing out of the ordinary. Making a reservation went smoothly and they nicely reminded me that I had a reservation a few hours before dinner time. However, It was hard to actually get someone's attention during dinner. We had trouble bringing someone to fill our water cups. Other than that, the servers were attentive and caring when coming to our table."], ["Cindy C.", "Came here on Valentine's Day and had a good meal here. - THE APPETIZERSMy boyfriend and I both ordered the lobster bisque to start. Initially, the soup tasted good but then the brandy cream kicked in and it got really bitter really quickly. They also served us bread with butter or olive oil. I personally liked dipping the bread into the bisque as it provided more flavor but didn't have the intense bitter taste.+ THE MAIN COURSEMy boyfriend ordered the New York steak, which came with garlic mashed potatoes and creamed winter greats, while I had the seared salmon with crab risotto. I loved my meal because the salmon was crispy on the outside and cooked medium well on the inside. The crab risotto was fresh tasting and was very delicious. My boyfriend's steak was a bit more rough than he had liked but it was still very tasty. + THE SETTINGLocated in the middle of Old Sacramento, the restaurant is very different from the shops surrounding it. It had more of a classy and upscale vibe that contrasted from the vintage, run-down shops next door. Despite being very busy on a holiday, the servers were very nice and checked up on us regularly to see if we needed anything."], ["Yao C.", "Came here for the dine in for $31 where they have a set menu for you and your special friend! My cousin actually recommended this place after he took his date here and my boy has good taste!!!! Here is the breakdown:-parking: easy and fast because it is in old Sacramento and there is street parking or the garage parking which I recommend BUT park at an end spot If you care about your ride because I got a nasty door ding years ago and am still pissed about it! But I got it fixed but just be careful because people still can't park in between the lines and and dumb people always open the door to wide and ding the car next to them..... BUT garage parking is better but you have to pay. When went on a Saturday night and paid $5 which is decent..... And it is a short walk to the restaurant.....Oh yeah, ladies.... I know you like to sport those nice shoes with the high heel but BE careful because when you walk in old sac, there are holes in the walkways and your heel can get caught!!!!! - atmosphere: nice, modern, and welcoming. We made reservations and arrived on time and were seated right away. We were seated in a nice spot right in front of the open kitchen which is cool because it's fun to watch the chefs! The lighting was nice, the noise was not too loud.... Lots of families, couples, and large groups! They had some sort of banquet going on but had plenty of staff to cover the tables.... - staff: our waitress was average. She did greet us right away but she seemed to pay more attention to the other parties she was taking care of. BUT she did do a decent job..... We also had another employee greet us and we started talking sports which was fun.... And then the manager greeted us which was cool! - FOOD: we both ordered from the dine out for $31 so they had selected items to order from appetizers, entrees, and desserts....We both ordered the duck sausage with caramelized onions and some kind of sweet sauce.... The sausage was wonderful and we both agreed we could of skipped on that sauce! We also ordered a side of garlic fries which wasn't on the menu but we were just craving some garlic fries.... And they were just average.... Slightly soggy with no crispiness at all....For my ladies entree, she ordered the White Sea bass over risotto. She felt the fish was slightly over seasoned but for the most part she was happy.For my entree, I ordered the grass fed steak over mashed potatoes and green beans. I loved everything BUT the only drawback was there was slightly too much fat in my steak. BUT the flavor was excellent and you can taste that fresh grass fed factor! The mashed potatoes were buttery and the green beans were cooked perfect! Tip: order the steak RARE!!!!For dessert, I ordered the cheese cake and it was average.... Nothing too special and doesn't beat Cheesecake Factory. My lady ordered the chocolate mousse cake and it was very rich! My lady took two bites and was full since it was so rich! Good news for me since I ate it the next night!!!!Overall, we will definitely come back...maybe for valentines day!!"], ["Samantha H.", "Today I went and enjoyed a delicious lunch with a friend. I ordered a glass ofChardonnay and the chicken, apple and Brie sandwich, it was delicious. We sat on the back patio which is very inviting, it would be amazing for a warm Sacramento evening date.

The interior was clean and nicely decorated. I had a quick glimpse of the outdoor patio that appeared to be a nice dining atmosphere. I had high expectations of this self proclaimed farm to table establishment. I had the duck curry ($27), which was nothing to write home about. The curry flavor was good with the peanut, cilantro and mint garnishes, but the basmati rice it sat on was undercooked. The duck wasn't very flavorful and could have been cooked crispier to offset the fat. My husband ordered the pork chop with ratatouille ($23), which was a disappointment. The waitress who took our order wasn't our server and neither were very present or attentive. I did inform the waitress of how dry the pork was, but this was more than half way into our meal when she finally came around. She ended up comping that dish, which was obviously the right thing to do. The kids menu was fair compared to the typical gross fare of hot dogs, grilled cheese, mac and cheese and pizza (you get the picture). My kids had the grilled chicken and steak with vegetables (green beans) for $6.95 a meal. Not bad, but it should be the norm to see vegetables on all kids menus, ya with me? I'd say the entr\u00e9es were overpriced for the mediocre dishes we tried. I wouldn't choose this restaurant again as it's disappointing to pay their prices for an unsatisfactory meal. But I'd consider trying a different dish if I were treated to a meal here since a few other dishes I saw on other tables looked like they had the potential to be good."], ["Nigel N.", "I dined out at Ten 22 during the month of September. The bartender was affable. I ordered the pork pulled sandwich and a couple of Anchor brewing beers. The bill came to twenty-one dollars, which was fair. On my second visit, which was during lunch hour on Saturday and there were a good number of customers, I was seated and waited upon almost immediately. The waiter was patient and gave me sufficient enough time to make a decision as to what I wanted to order. I ordered the bistro burger with a side of sweet potato fries. The burger meat is offered in a choice of rare, medium and well done. I had medium and it was delicious. Decent portions and was reasonably priced at twelve dollars. I also had a couple of Great White beers. For an upscale restaurant in Old Sac, the lunch menu prices are fairly priced and food is prepared in a timely manner."], ["Ilana T.", "Great for large group corporate dinners!I am an event coordinator for a company who holds a few dinner meetings per week.

You can sit either inside or outside. Inside is very cozy but we were sat outside in a very nice garden- inspired atmosphere. They had mist spraying throughout outside to keep customers cool which was weird at first but it's nice on a hot day. I had to ask for a new set of plates since the ones on the table were dirty. Also be weary since it's outside you'll see some flies and I had to swat away a bug on the table.Free bread with balsamic vinegar and olive oil was a nice touch. The bread was warm but there was way too much olive oil in the sauce. I ordered the bone in ribeye steak which was \u00a0recommended by the waitress. I ordered medium rare but unfortunately the chef obviously didn't know what that meant as it was more on the medium-well done side. It looked like a pretty big chunk of meat but a lot of it was just fat and bone. There was a pesto sauce on top which I liked. It comes with mashed potatoes and roasted carrots and green beans which were delicious. Overall a nice dish but more pricey at around $43. The service was great as our waitress came by to check in and our glasses were constantly refilled. However the restaurant did a big no-no as we ordered the crostini appetizer but it didn't come until a few minutes after our entrees. The waitress apologized and took it off our bill and the manager came to our table to apologize as well which was nice. All around nice staff. Drinks are reasonably priced.

The second manager was even more helpful then the first, he went above and beyond to make sure it stayed a surprise for my sister. When we arrived we were welcomed and our table was ready. Once everyone arrived everything kinda fell into place. Unfortunately our server forgot a few things and we had to keep on reminding him and he still forgot, which was really annoying. I wasn't gonna let someone ruin my sisters day, so I kept my cool. The food was great, portions were good and the prices weren't bad. I would totally come back if I lived closer.

We always sit at the bar and it was empty so we expected to have good service. Wrong!! One unfriendly bartender took 20 mins to get my husbands beer. I'm not exaggerating. We would have left but we ordered an appetizer.We got the mac and cheese.. The chili on top was hot but the pasta and cheese were cold?!? We sent it back and got a new one with no apology for the beer or the food. We didn't even finish it and we were hungry. The menu didn't have many appetizing selections neither. Very disappointed and will never go back and will let others know how bad they are.We even heard a regular customer next to us complain about how some of the dishes come out in different temperatures.

I love the ambiance of this place, and the live music was a nice touch. We got a booth to ourselves, and it was super roomy. It could easily fit 6 people. The booths are tall, so you can't see other people in the booths next to you, which is nice for privacy reasons. (I can't tell you how many times I've seen a child peeking over a booth and staring at the party next door! So awkward.).We ordered the Yams, Bacon, and Jam for the appetizer. The bacon was delicious (when isn't bacon delicious?), but the yams were a little too dense for me. It was a heavier appetizer than I expected because the photo on the website looks like a spooned dumpling, rather than a dense hockey puck. For my entree, I ordered the Pork, Yams, and Cabbage. I think I forgot that we ordered yams for the appetizer or I would have ordered a different entree. The pork steak was huge, and I could only eat half of it before wanting to box the rest. The yams were good and not dense like the appetizer since it was just wedges. I wasn't fond of the cabbage kraut since it was a tad too sour for me - I had a slight cold so it didn't sit well at the time. My boyfriend ordered the Duck, Rice, and Beans. I had a bite and really enjoyed it. The rice and beans were a tad spicy, and the flavor was good. There was generous amount of duck, and he only ate half before wanting a box too. For dessert, our server brought a complimentary slice of chocolate espresso cake since it was our anniversary. I love when restaurants do this for special occasions! Not that I can't afford my own cake, but it's a nice gesture and shows that they pay attention and care about providing great service. Overall, I really like this place. I will definitely be back!"], ["Katie G.", "Our experience at Ten22 was decent. It doesn't warrant a glowing 5 stars, really not even 4, but I am rounding up because I like their HH and there are some really grimy places in the Old Sacramento area, so for that, 4! HH offers some run of the mill Apps and reasonably priced beer. The fried oysters were huge! My husband ordered the local farm to fork 3 course meal. I sampled his salad and it was perfect - I would have just eaten that. I ordered the pork chop as most of the meat options on the menu were a little too exotic for me. I hardly ever eat meat when we're out but the pork chop was perfectly cooked. The polenta tater tots were also delicious, I wish they were on the HH menu. If you are a chicken or mostly veggie dish person, I highly recommend the pork chop. We walked out of Ten22 with a pretty big bill, but it was mostly worth it. There was some confusion when we entered about where we could and couldn't sit. The hostess sort of shuffled us into the bar area and kept pointing at tables with \"Reserved\" signs on them. I kept saying that I hadn't made a reservation (plus it was the bar area) and finally she got it across that Ten22 will put \"Reserved\" on bar tables to people just don't come in and sit. I guess it makes sense to them... Definitely pricey but good food. There are plenty of other lower end restaurants in the area, including Joe's Crap Shack, but if you're looking for something with better quality food, this is my suggestion."], ["michelle w.", "The service was great, nice and quiet outdoor seating , food was good, great happy hour prices , loved the fried chicken sliders ..

It was 88 degrees out and both my guest and I were dressed casually yet tastefully in shorts and a tshirt... We ordered our drinks and being that is it the same restaurant with the same walk in fridge and typically the same ingredients I asked if they would still offer the Chicken Pineapple BBQ pizza and the server quickly said no because the ingredients are not available.Disappointed with the limited options on the menu we finished our drinks and politely left & had dinner elsewhere."], ["Lillian M.", "The atmosphere is great. Love the patio. That's where it stops. We had a big party of 18 people with just one server. The service was super slow. The food came out all at once but almost all of the plates had cold food. It wasn't worth asking them to take it back for them just to microwave it.I had the steak and it wasn't good, the mashed potato was cold. Not worth the $32 they charged for it.They also gave us one bill for the entire party. I do not understand how hard it would be to separate the bill. We were forced to figure out a way to split the bill evenly which wasn't really fair for the single folks. The only choice for the bill was to split it 10 ways evenly or by four.

On the plus side, the bartender helped us with beer samples from a few of their dozen taps. Our $6 HH street tacos were OK, but I was hoping for a more authentic taco, as well as a condiment other than Cholula. Our bartender quickly became overwhelmed by the HH customers, so we felt a bit neglected after awhile.Ten22 is a worthy and classy addition to Old Sacramento and deserves a visit. We'll try it again to see how the dining experience pans out."], ["Eileen L.", "Make sure to check-in to Ten22 on any of their social media networks (Facebook, Yelp, etc) and they will waive the fee of valet for you! Let the hostess know you have checked in and they will give you the slip to present to the valet when you leave.I can only vouch for their catering services since I attended a banquet for dinner in their outdoor patio. Which I must say, their outdoor patio is quite cozy and pleasant. We were offered limited menu options because it was a banquet, so we did not get a full list of choices of their actual menu.The appetizer I got was tomato basil soup and it was relatively oily and it contained an overabundance of mushy beans. Since they were mass cooking the steaks, I'm assuming that's why they didn't individually ask banquet attendees how they wanted their steak cooked (it was a banquet of at least 50 people, give or take). Personally, I like my steaks rare-medium and my steak came out to be rare. I asked a server (I believe her name is Annabelle?) for it to be cooked some more and she came back with a brand new medium-rare one for me! Awesome! Their creme brulee dessert is so delicious. Perfect creaminess under the caramelized sugar. They also had some type of chocolate lava cake that was super rich in chocolate goodness.By the way, Annabelle was awesome and attended all the requests that my table (in addition to all the other tables she served) threw at her! The staff at Ten22 are awesome and have great customer service.Would like to give them a shot again and give their full menu a chance. Until next time, Ten22!"], ["Svetlana K.", "I absolutely love coming to this restaurant. My first experience wasn't so great because it was a crazy day in Old Sac. But all my visits since than have been refreshingly superb! Their food is so delicious and amazing. Yesterday I had the chef's special lasagna. I never usually order that dish because I'm not a huge lasagna fan. But the waitress made it sound so appetizing I just had to give it a try. Wow, was it amazing! Just phenomenally good! I can't even describe it. The best lasagna I've ever tasted in my life. I love the atmosphere in this restaurant. Open and airy. The decor is updated and tastefully done. You don't feel like the decor is distracting you from focusing on your conversation. You can just enjoy having a pleasant dining experience with some really great food!I've found that the servers are all very nice people. I feel they genuinely help with a smile and its nice to see people who seem to enjoy what they do. I highly recommend coming to this place. Just don't come during a festival or while some big event is happening. It's not as enjoyable when it's packed in Old Sac."], ["Jim D.", "I like the place but my experience at the bar left a lot to be desired. All I wanted was a simple glass of wine but appears toy I'm invisible!Two bartenders on duty, each walked by helping and serving other customers. Finally the guy next to me caught their attention and I finally got a drink."], ["Jackie F.", "I had really been enjoying Ten22 the past few years with only the occasional poor dish, but this week, the entire meal was bad- really, really bad. I ordered the sea bass special, and it was one of the most disappointing dishes I've ever had. I'm not sure it was sea bass, it was a very THIN, dry, unseasoned piece of white fish. Not at all what you expect for Sea Bass costing $32. The \"truffle\" risotto was so horribly salty it was inedible, and that was the only flavor there- salted mush, no truffle flavor. The green beans could have been really nice, but they were also drenched in salt. (Again no salt on the fish, but everything else was drenched in it). The pizza dough was bland and soggy. The mac and cheese (formerly one of their best) seems to be made with velveeta cheese now- bad taste, and it had disgusting chunks of dried out pork- I can't even believed they served it. One piece of pork was so dry and tough it hurt the roof of my mouth. It was like it had been left out all day. But the absolute worst, was the \"yam, pork belly and plantain\" appetizer. We've had their version of that dish in the past and it was yummy. This was nothing more than huge chunks of fat on dried, flavorless plantains with a puree of yam that had no flavor at all. I have never said this in a review before- but I wouldn't have fed that to my dog. Most of the food they brought us should never have been served in restaurant like that. I am not someone who is squeamish about spending a lot on a nice meal, but I feel very ripped off by that dinner. It was not good food and it was very expensive. Is it just going to be a tourist trap now? Such a bummer. I will say that the desserts were yummy, but it wasn't enough to make up for the rest."], ["Alonso R.", "I am very appreciative that while all other restaurants literally ran out of food and closed during the Gold Rush Days weekend, Ten22 remained opened and served food. So good for them! The place looks really nice, and the service is very friendly. The food took a while to come out, but that's understandable because it was pretty much the only restaurant opened. However, the food was nothing to brag about, you know? Nothing out of the ordinary. I had their signature burger, which looked good, but was seriously lacking in flavor. My wife had some sort of salad and she also thought was pretty meh. Probably won't go back unless friends want to go there, but I thank them for being open."], ["Cyndi R.", "If you like cheese go here. Our server left little to be desired ...Checking out yelp reviews in Old Sac and trying to avoid tourist trap yucky places, came across Ten22 which had 4.5 stars, ok.Greeted by nice hostess who took us to the back patio. Awesome ambiance, perfectly shaded and felt like you were in a different part of town. There was also a free concert going on so we could hear the live music.Started out ordering an artichoke and beers. Asked server which IPA's they liked and they seemed puzzled. They then said one, but said it was taken off the menu. Then said another and saw it wasn't on the menu, but they had it. Server returned with drinks, minus the beer they suggested because it had been taken off the menu \"probably cause it's the one I liked\". Beers are set down ... One IPA 12oz didn't look right, it was a dark dark beer in a small 9 oz glass ... We asked server is this an IPA? \"Should be, bartender is busy so they might have messed it up.\" Returns with new beer \"sorry bartender messed it up, I didn't know I don't even like beer.\" What about those suggestions???!Grilled Artichoke showed up, with soft cheese crumbles on it ....Ordered the strawberry salad! Was SO excited until it showed up covered in chunky cheese, I thought to myself...am I crazy I didn't see that on the menu. Didn't complain because I always am scared what might happen when you return food...well then I found a hair (a short black one so not mine) so guess I should have returned anyway. Stopped eating and left half my cheese with side of salad there. Server didn't ask if I enjoyed it which was surprised since half of it was there.Everyone else enjoyed their meals and the salad was really good minus the cheese and hair.Our server was nice but I think their lack of knowledge led to some of the non 5 star rating. The table next to us (different server) heard the specials, after we had ordered and they sounded awesome! I wish we had heard them! And we noticed some tables got bread and we didn't. Server was nice but just there to be a server not anything over."], ["Nc R.", "The patio, the beer selection, and the live music on the weekends... Those three reasons alone are enough to keep coming back to Ten 22. Beer selection is awesome. Tons on tap that rotate through out the year and several in the bottle. My favorite thing to do is to get there before our reservation, sit at the bar, and drink a beer (or two... maybe three). Bar is pretty cool and I have had nothing but great service. The way the restaurant is set up is really cool. Sitting inside is nice and the decor is great. Service varies on what night and who is working but I have only had one big problem out of the 6-7 times I have been there. \u00a0When Sacramento is nice you NEED to go to the patio. It is really nice out there. \u00a0Its on little pearl in the middle of old town. I was pretty upset because I did not even know they had a patio until the fourth or fifth time i was there, Besides the great inside and the wonderful patio in the back there is live music on weekends. This is the perfect place for a date. Acoustic guitar fills the restaurant while you and your date sit back and enjoy a drink (or two or three). Additional notes. Food is above average but not the best in Sacramento. I have always been happy with the what i order."]], "Bandera": [["Jonny L.", "Last night was my second time to Bandera. Date night with the GF. She loves it here and I really enjoyed my first visit. When we arrived around 5 for dinner there was no open tables due to reservations, I'm guessing there was a ton of reservations around that time cause about half the tables were empty. The hostess mentioned we could sit on the back bar and watch the chefs work their magic. Those are definitely the best seats in the house, my GF and I were very excited to sit there, enjoy watching all the food get made. We started out the with the cornbread skillet appi, if you like cornbread this is a must. It's crumbly corn deliciousness and I think there's bits of jalape\u00f1os. It's a pretty big size serving for an appi, could be shared with up to four people. \u00a0I'd recommended to anyone. The entrees. (We were going to see Aziz Ansari on this date night so I wanted to Treat Myself) I went with the prime rib (bone in), came with sides of mashed potatoes and saut\u00e9ed spinach. The Gf went with her favorite Asian Noodle Salad with Steak and a side of saut\u00e9ed Brussels with dates. She loves that salad and says she would get it every time. The noodles could have been cooked just a tad longer but it was no big. Now the main event, the prime rib, it is just the way you want it and it couldn't be done better. I like mine at medium rare to medium and it was PERFECT, just melted at first bite. It was a huge steak and I was sad at the end when it was gone. The mashed potatoes were mixed with green onions and something else I could not figure out but I didn't care, it was a perfect pairing with the prime rib. The saut\u00e9ed spinach was a nice side, not over cooked. Easily a dish I would order again. My first visit I ordered the Rotisserie chicken and beef rib combo. Definitely surpassed my expectations. The chicken had amazing flavor and juice run down your hands as your take the first bite. The beef ribs were tender and fell off the bone. I think the bbq sauce was more Memphis style, but don't quote me on that. I prefer pork ribs to beef but I can't complain, they were down right delicious. After sitting by the kitchen, I'll have to order the pork ribs at my next visit. The GF and I had an awesome experience, one to remember and we will remember to ask if a spot is open by the kitchen counter. The food doesn't disappoint. Oh we forgot to get dessert, so we won't forget next time."], ["Ian I.", "The restaurant was amazing. The service was incredible. And the dessert was, unbelievable. You know you're reviewing a high quality restaurant when you run out of adjectives to describe the experience. Zach and Alex, our waiters, were the very embodiment of hospitality and friendliness. The Prime Rib-Eye Steak was cooked to perfection and seasoned quite liberally. We ordered the Oreo Fountain dessert and I practically lost myself in my seat. My deepest apologies to my girlfriend, but that dinner was the highlight of my night.$80 for two dishes, one appetizer, a plate of delicious cornbread that rivals that of Soup Plantation, astounding service, a lively atmosphere, and an Oreo fountain that would make any health-nut reevaluate their life choices?Come on."], ["Matt R.", "If I could give this place 10 Stars I would!!!I have been to this amazing Restaurant with my Fiance several times and they never disappoint!!

Something else! \u00a0Thank you Bandera. \u00a0Can't wait to see you again."], ["Brittany H.", "So good! I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and we really liked it. I made reservations and a table was waiting as soon as we walked in. We started with the jalape\u00f1o cornbread that was to die for and the ahi poke. The ahi poke was very good too - there was also shrimp and avocado and I think mango - very flavorful. I ordered the roasted chicken and the birthday boy got the prime rib. We had a lot of leftovers because the portions are very well-sized and all of the food was so good. I heard from friends after we came here that they do not have a corkage fee. I'm not sure if it's definitely true, but it's awesome if they do! We will be back!"], ["Bridget W.", "This place was overall good but not great. Our reservation at 8 led us into a hopping place. I had expected, given the pictures of the decor, the reviews, and the pricey menu that this would be a more upscale experience. It ended up a mixed bag. Some people were dressed, others apparently didn't get the memo and were jeans-and-baseball-hat casual. A booth full of high school seniors in basketball shorts and hoodies were seated to our left. Thankfully no corkage fee!!Food was good. I did research (thank you fellow yelpers) and we decided to try some of the most highly recommended items (ahi poke to start, prime rib, banana cream pie). Also the sea bass that is a fix on the menu (but not on the one yelp shows).Poke was mostly mango and avocado chunks- we wondered where the tuna was? Prime rib was a monsterous slab. The mashed potatoes that accompanied it were worthy a plate all their own. I had the sea bass, which was served with sauteed spinach, and that was pretty good and thankfully not overseasoned. Highlight of it all was the famed banana cream pie. Divine.The noise level was a real disappointment. I have no idea how this place is considered a date night type of place. Yes it's dark, but we were nearly shouting across the table at each other. Even the waiter had a hard time hearing us. The group to our right was feeling no pain and decided to belt the Happy Birthday song three times amongst themselves during dinner. Our evening at times felt like we were trying to have an upscale dinner in the middle of a sports bar during someone's game seven. Yeah, that loud.Server (Alex) was friendly but not really attentive. We had to ask him ourselves if there were any specials and were disappointed that we weren't asked if we wanted our wine decanted (only to see a table near us that came later get their wine decanted by another server). Overall we had a nice enough time and good food. We both agreed that although this isn't a place we would come back to for dinner, we would partake in another slice of the banana cream pie... but probably take it to go :)"], ["Jenny L.", "I wanted to take my date Kevin out on a somewhat upscale restaurant that wasn't too fancy and Bandera was just perfect!We made reservations for 8 o' clock but got there around 745 and was seated promptly although there was a long wait, so I highly suggest making reservations on weekends. The spinach and artichoke dip was delicious! Probably the best spinach and artichoke dip I've ever had, but I haven't had many. Included is sour cream and salsa. It's a good idea to interchange between the dips or you'll get tired of it real quick.The steamed garlic clams were really good, but nothing too special. I'm not a big fan of the shell taste, but I did love the tart sauce drizzled over the clams and the sauce the clams were cooked in. Under the clams was a soaked piece of toast and included were two pieces of grilled toast. Kevin got the ribs which included jalepeno Cole slaw and the infamous cornbread. The ribs were stacked on top of each other, which was smart cuz it kept the ribs warm! He loved the ribs and they were really fall off the bone ribs. The jalepeno cole slaw was soooo good. I seriously could eat it all day long and I'm usually not as big fan of cole slaw. The cornbread had a sweet, yet savory taste. It had chunks of jalepeno but it wasn't spicy whatsoever.I got the seared ahi tuna with mixed greens. The seared ahi tuna was delectable in every way. The sauce was really soy sauce-y which was kind of overwhelming, but the fish was so fresh that it made up for it. The mixed greens was refreshing. It had jicama and mangos!For dessert you know we has to order the banana cream pie. Best dessert I've had thus far from any restaurant. We even came back the next day and ordered to-go!! It's better if you eat it at the actual restaurant though.The service we received was impeccable. Our server always came back to check on us and other servers as well! Like other reviewers, I agree that for $$, you get $$$ worth of service. We spent $100 for all those items and tipped them generously because of their great service. Definitely going to come back!!"], ["Overworked U.", "WOW! Took Mr Dude here for his birthday. I had the prime rib, he had the center-cut filet. \u00a0Cannot explain enough how delicious the dinner was. They had cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e as a special dessert tonight....scrumptious! Love that they have no corkage fee so we brought one of our fave wines and it was a PERFECT match with our slabs of mooo. Only downside is that it's kinda loud for a date atmosphere.

Because we decided to venture there on Labor Day, we were thrilled that we were able to book reservations using their website (Rezbook Reservations). That is an awesome feature. Our reservations were at 6:45pm, got there about 5 minutes before, checked in and was told it'll be a few minutes. I think 15 minutes went by and finally we were seated. Our waitress was Jeannie, she came to introduce herself - then left. We thought that was super odd. Then five-seven minutes goes by, she comes by and asks us for our drinks - just water we said. That took another ten minutes to get, just plain water. By that time, I was annoyed-told my husband to make sure she knows we're ready to order our appetizer and entrees. I would think that \"drink orders\" should be a given, start there when you introduce yourself to the customers. So, hubby had the Hawaiian Ribeye and I had the chicken/ribs combo. The ribeye was to die for. My plate was good but not as great as his ribeye. Overall, I like the online reservations feature, the ambiance, and food but service was not up to par.Probably will not be back again due to the service."], ["Julia D.", "Fantastic totally amazing food. Ridiculously awesome ambient lighting. Attentive service.

Moved back without one was a bad idea).The Grange is located in The Citizen Hotel. \u00a0Since it was Cocktail week, this event had a band, really tasty cocktails, a more professional mid 30's crowd that dressed up for the event, and limited seating. \u00a0Tables were reserved, crowd started to build, and you still couldn't sit at any of the \"reserved\" tables that for the 2 hours I was there no one sat at but could have with all the drinks and small plates they had. \u00a0A few things that bugged me:1. \u00a0 It was cocktail week, it started at 6pm - HH Time AND they didn't have HH pricing on their cocktails. \u00a0Delicious but at $10 a drink and $4 for a mocktail was a little on the pricey side. \u00a0At least there wasn't cover.2. \u00a0A small cheese plate was $18: \u00a03 teeny tiny servings of cheese with one freaking cracker. \u00a0Are you kidding me? \u00a0It just didn't make sense!We're not poor or anything, but last time I checked the hubs and I don't shit money. \u00a0$50 for 2 drinks, 1 mocktail, and a ridiculously small cheese plate was not worth it. \u00a0I would have rather had dinner somewhere!"], ["Noni C.", "My experience at Grange Restaurant was exceptional .

Well, they didn't have a cheesecake on their menu but Eddy told me he would find a way to get one! \u00a0Dinner came and went (wait, I will tell you about dinner in a minute), we ordered desserts for ourselves and figured Eddy will bring out the cheesecake for my sister. \u00a0Her dessert came out with a candle, we sang Happy Birthday, looked at the dish, it was a panna cotta...not cheesecake! \u00a0We were a bit disappointed but more perplexed. \u00a0Why didn't Eddy tell us there was no cheesecake so my sister could at least pick the dessert she wanted from the menu. \u00a0Our question was answered quickly. \u00a0Eddy explained that the cheesecake was still a little frozen and he needed extra time for it to thaw and didn't want the others to have to wait. \u00a0Half way through our dessert, lo and behold, Eddy came out with the cheesecake with a candle on top! \u00a0My sister was sang Happy Birthday to for the second time and got desserts with a triple S! \u00a0We all had a taste of the cheesecake and it was DELICIOUS! \u00a0Eddy made my sister's day! \u00a0She could not stop talking about Eddy all night and the next day! Thank you Eddy for making my sister's birthday a memorable one with your top notch service!!The Ma\u00eetre d also deserve mention. \u00a0Grange is located inside the Citizen hotel and to get to the restroom, you had to go some ways to get to. \u00a0He could've just told us, straight, take a left, through the lobby, down the stairs on your right. \u00a0But, he walked us outside to the hotel lobby and showed us the stairs to take to our desired destination. \u00a0When he saw me taking pictures of the open kitchen, he made sure to clear the way of busy waiters and invited me to walk closer in to get all the shots I wanted. :)Just the service alone will get me to come back! \u00a0However, we LOVED the food too. \u00a0Fresh and interesting blend of ingredients! \u00a0I thought I've tasted the best Brussels sprouts but Grange's Brussels sprouts with srirracha, honey and toasted garlic is top of the world and over the top!!

The fish is tougher than the Ahi but tasty accompanied with butter beans and cooked endives. \u00a0Husband got the pork chop and it was 2 inches thick and cooked just right! Dessert...oh you heard about dessert. :) Short version, I had the chocolate mousse with caramel popcorn, root beer pudding and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \u00a0We also had the carrot cake, panna cotta and of course the cheesecake. \u00a0All yummy!Excellent service and excellent food! \u00a0Can't ask for much more....oh wait, MUST ask for Eddy!!!"], ["Tauasa T.", "Great selection of local beers on tap with exceptional service.

And after such an amazing experience, I am so glad I picked Grange. My birthday fell on a Sunday, which worked out since Sunday evenings tend to be a lot less packed than Fridays or Saturdays. We got a drink at the bar while we were waiting for the rest of our party, and I told the bartender when flavors I liked, and she created a nice light cocktail for me to start the evening off right. Shortly after they were seated, they took our drink orders. My hubby got the infamous Tusk, which is now his new favorite cocktail. They had him at candied bacon! Strong and smooth, this drink is a must when at Grange. The blood orange mai tai my sister in law was tasty as well. I didn't order another drink since I just had one at the bar, but that didn't stop our awesome server from handing me a beautiful flute of birthday bubbly! Very nice touch. And very good champagne as well.We started this memorable meal with grilled yogurt flatbread, which came with olive tapenade, sweet potato hummus (which had a big punch of flavor), and north valley goat cheese (I think marscapone was in there too). The dips were all delicious and quite plentiful. Usually the dips run out before the breads, but it was actually the opposite in this instance. We dipped our table bread into the extra dip after the flatbread was all eaten. By the way, the table bread and butter was nice and fresh as well.We ordered a lot of food, and here is a listing:Polenta soup with black pepper croutons, jack cheese and lardons: the soup itself was quite mild, but the 'stuff' it came with gave the dish all the flavor punch it neededCapay Beets: my husband ate this side as a salad, and it was fantastic, even if you aren't a huge fan of beets. We ate every nook and cranny of it. Truffle mac and cheese: one of the weaker dishes, this rendition was good but a little blandChickpea fries: this was my favorite side out of the ones we ordered. I can't tell you how much I enjoyed these. Crispy on the outside and super fluffy on the inside, and the chili aioli that came with it was a perfect dip for it. You will be addicted to these after the first bite!Potato and Leek Angolotti: this was their pasta offering, and was served with braised endive, celery root puree, and hazelnuts. My sister absolutely loved itCrispy pork spare ribs: I didn't get to try these, but my brother said they were delicious and the meat very tenderSkuna Bay Salmon: served with braised fennel, capers, piquillo and herbs. The crispy skin was my favorite part. The flesh was nice and moist.Beeler pork rack: this was my actual entr\u00e9e. Whoo boy was this good. This gourmet version of a pork chop might be the best pork dish I've had in years. Huge thick slab of moist pork, served with Brussels sprouts saut\u00e9ed with bacon, apple and raisin compote, and mashed potatoes. The potatoes were ok, but I loved the rest of the dish. I would come back for this dish alone.And...dessert! Yes, I did save room for dessert. And you should too! The malt custard is SO very good. Every bite melted in my mouth. We also really enjoyed the pear donut holes (pillowy fried goodness), the lemon meringue pie, and a chocolate torte with pistachio ice cream. Our server (I hate that I forgot his name, but he had a british accent) couldn't have been more perfect. He made this experience that much better. I have only had brunch here prior to this visit.

The spice lasted on my tongue but not in a fiery way, it was more of a lasting spice flavor that didn't over power the battered calamari. The subtle taste of Chard paired well with this appetizer.Whiskey burger with homemade fries and homemade ketchup was delicious.

Ugh!! If there's one thing a restaurant needs to guarantee, it's that meat is served to the customer as ordered. Big disappointment there. The focaccia bread that came with the burger was a bit much, as I found myself eating plain bread by the end of the meal.We were also given fries with the burger which were ok. Nothing special there. The aioli sauce that came on the burger was bomb, as was the housemade ketchup and dijon mustard with which we were also provided. Big thumbs up on the ketchup.

It has a decently diverse menu for dinner, something for everybody and a nice interior.I arrived and my client was already there waiting. We're seated and drink orders taken. We started with 2 glasses of red wine. Red wine prices by the glass run anywhere from $11 to $14, so no there's no $4.00 glasses of wine here.While small talk mixed with some business ensues, we check over the menu. Our server comes back, and we start with the Calamari. It was described as, fried calamari with stir-fried bok choy and wasabi ponzu sauce. That sounded interesting and a departure from the usual fried rings. For salads, I did see a pork belly salad, but my cholesterol levels got the best of be, and I went with the green salad ($9.00) as did my client. My client seemed ready to order \u00a0his entree, so I made up my mind fast. He ordered the Fettuccine ($19.00). I thought he could have ordered something more expensive, but I guess since this was our first meeting, he was trying not to take too much advantage of my expense account. I went for the Seared Salmon ($22.00).I liked the ambiance of this restaurant, upscale yet still relaxed and not stuffy old school. Our Calamari arrives. No food pics at client dinners ... that's just bad form. It does look delicious. The taste is very nice and balanced with the seasonings. I resist doing the happy feet dance under the table .....being professional and all! We enjoy our appetizer and good conversation. Our salads arrive next. OK, yep a green salad ...a nice one, but nothing to get too excited over. As our entrees arrive, we order more wine. My salmon looks pretty nice and cooked proper. Mine was cooked normal all the way through and still flaky, as some New American restaurants like to serve their fish med rare .... thinking the customer likes sushi. Some do I guess. My client's pasta looked nice and had a good looking cream sauce. We didn't taste off each others plates, since this was business! One thing about these client dinners, I have to pay more attention to my client and conversation than focusing on the food itself. But I was still enjoying my salmon and he is pasta. I'd say the food here is very good, maybe not off the charts OMG! good, but a pleasant place to come along with the competent service and nice interior.

Do yourself a favor and get your booty down there."], ["S S.", "Was here the other night to redeem a Groupon that we purchased. \u00a0We'd never been and the deal (two burgers and a bottle of wine) was solid, so we were hoping we'd stumble across a new favorite restaurant.Goods: The place clean and comfortable with a decent sized patio out front. \u00a0We were seated quickly and the service was speedy and polite. \u00a0The Whiskey burger itself is fantastic (when cooked properly...see below), and the fries are good too (when cooked properly...see below). \u00a0The wine that came with the deal was fair, had a retail price elsewhere of about $6-7/bottle, though it was $9/glass and over $30/bottle at Formolis (but you already know that the markup on booze is insane in American restaurants).Bads: \u00a0I ordered my burger medium rare (also the waitress' recommendation), and my wife ordered hers medium. \u00a0Though they came quickly, mine was rare/meduim-rare and my wife's was, at best, medium rare. \u00a0When the meat in the center is still raw and mushy, it's not medium. \u00a0The fries, however, were also undercooked on both of our plates. \u00a0The centers were basically raw and still crunchy, while the outsides didn't have that crispy fried coating you look for. \u00a0But the waitress was apologetic when we pointed this out. \u00a0She said she would have my wife's burger and fries cooked some more. \u00a0She returned and my wife's burger came back medium the second time, but even the \"twice cooked\" fries were still underdone. \u00a0The house made Ketchup was also pretty watery and flavorless.Summary: The burgers really had potential with some awesome flavor and moisture, but the execution, at least on this night was poor. \u00a0The rest of the menu looked fine, although it's probably 30% overpriced based on comparable options. \u00a0And with the lowest priced glass of wine set at $9 (for what should be \"house\" wine elsewhere...a red blend of no particular quality), it definitely gives the sense of being overpriced all around. \u00a0We might give it another shot, but with so many amazing places around, I'm not sure."], ["Luci N.", "This was probably my fourth time at Formoli's so it was definitely time to write a review. Based on the very delicious meal I had- I was more motivated to give a shout out to this East Sac restaurant. The food:We sat in the patio on a beautiful evening, enjoying our Drake's IPA and ice water with cucumber. The waiter brought out some bread and dipping oil which had macerated arugula and onion in it- we couldn't figure what the flavors were and had to ask about it. We ordered a Beet and Brie salad, \u00a0Roast chicken skin-on breast which was crispy yet moist and flavorful. It came with mashed potatoes/parsnips, wilted arugula and pork belly. All in all, our meal was enjoyable to the last bite! Compliments to the chef for creating dishes with unique combinations of ingredients which enhanced the flavor without being over the top. I've also had the Cubano, $9 (which I highly recommend!) and the famous Whiskey Burger $10- you can't go wrong with either one of these. The service:The service has always been friendly with prompt service. The servers know their menu and can give you recommendations on what to order if you're uncertain.Extras:They have 5-6 beer on tap and are about $6. There is a heated patio for colder days. This place can be a casual dining experience or it can be a romantic date place."], ["Carole W.", "We started going to Formoli's when we moved to Sacramento, Sunset magazine mentioned them as a great neighborhood restaurant. \u00a0The food is always innovative, fresh and tasty. \u00a0Last night we had the peach/fresh cheese salad, the peaches were grilled, amazing. \u00a0We also had the beet salad, and the fresh tomato plate. \u00a0All the salads were perfectly dressed, yum. \u00a0Our entrees were all so beautifully presented. \u00a0I had the special, crispy trout on a spicy pur\u00e9e with thinly sliced carrots, wow, so good. \u00a0Also good, the day boat scallops, and the pork chop dish. \u00a0The pork chop was one of the best I have ever tasted. \u00a0A lot of people go for their whiskey burger, it is good, but try their other dishes too.They have a fun wine list, and their pours are good, we tend to order by the glass to try the wines. \u00a0They also have a good beer selection.Excellent food, great service and fun atmosphere, a must go to."], ["John H.", "Formoli's is a cafe bistro in the quiet East Sacramento neighborhood.

Although the burger did not appear to be the most exciting item on the menu,and despite the fact that is certainly now what they are known for, the burger was delicious! The meat was cooked well done the way I liked it and was drizzled in a delicious semi spicy aoli and plenty of good quality cheese. My only complaint would have to do with the meat to bread ratio. I felt the ciabatta style bun was a bit too much. \u00a0A couple of my favorite parts about the dining experience was the home made ketchup, and the yummy olive oil and bread appetizer. Did I mention, the atmosphere was pretty cool too? I would like to come back to see how the rest of the menu sizes up. Again, the groupon was a great value."], ["Nicole L.", "Whenever I come here, I feel like Norm from \"Cheers\" - they remember me! That was the case from the second time my boyfriend and I went to eat here, and every subsequent visit to this awesome place. Formoli's is an exceptional space with exceptional food and exceptional service. I have been here a number of times, and have always been treated not just politely, but warmly. There's a difference. When the manager smiles at you, the waitstaff genuinely say, \"Hey, how're you doing?\" and remember little details, that's what gives this place the neighborhood feel and what makes me really want to return again and again. That- and the amazing food. Aimal and Suzanne also collaborate with other chefs in the area from time to time, such as Billy from Kru, and I *love* knowing that they really enjoy what they do. I've never met them, but their passion really shows in the food they create. First of all, you may notice the decor is \"homey.\" It's almost like walking into someone's (well-decorated) house - high ceilings, lampshades, artwork, billowy curtains, lights everywhere. It's clean and comfortable, and that's just the beginning of the experience. When we first came in here, we weren't drinking alcohol for health reasons (training for a longer bike ride), and that was never an issue- guess what they carry? Yes, cucumber water, but also cucumber-mint *soda* that is to die for. Delicious. Never pressured, always respected. Every table where I've been seated has had good acoustics- even in the middle of the restaurant. I can hear whomever is accompanying me. Shortly after we are seated, some amazing tasty treat comes directly to the table- a single serve appetizer from the chef's imagination. I've had house made potato chips with amazing garnish and other extraordinary flavor combos that exemplify the excellence for which Formoli's is known.The appetizers rotate, but there are some staples that are out of this world: the scallops with apple and pork belly on pea shoots, the dates stuffed with goat cheese and pancetta on endive, the poutine. You should try these. The first time we ate here, we ordered the dates and split the whiskey burger, and our server also brought us the scallops, on the house, because it was our first time. If you can imagine Archer's voice going through my head, \"Do you want regulars? Because *that's* how you get regulars.\" Hook, line and sinker. Done deal. Since then, may I also recommend the kabobs (don't know how long they'll be on the menu), which sit on carrot-vanilla puree, aka \"crack.\" Salads: these also rotate. I recently had the tamarind shrimp, and have not experienced the caprese or the peach based salads that are currently on the menu, but if their history signifies anything, then do yourself a favor and get one. Mains: So, the whiskey burger really *is* the best burger I've put in my mouth, but there are so many other great items here that it's difficult to say which one is the best. If you haven't been here yet, you absolutely should try the whiskey burger at some point, but don't sell yourself short by not experimenting with the rest of the menu. The flat iron steak is unbelievable, as is the salmon. I recently had a risotto they offered in spring that was vegetarian (it had peas!) and I was absolutely blown away. Whatever you order will be fresh, with fantastic flavor combinations, and I promise you will be satisfied......So satisfied that you might not want dessert, which would be a mistake to refuse. Our first visit here, I honestly felt as though dessert needed a little more oomph to it, but subsequent visits have demonstrated that they have just as an imaginative dessert menu as lunch and dinner, as evidenced by things like the \"lemon chocolate tart\" they have listed currently. We have begun drinking alcohol again, and the wine list is also very impressive - lots of variety from multiple countries: Spanish, Italian, Australian, Argentinian, French, and our own wine mecca (seriously, California's record speaks for itself), with prices that are reasonable. There's even a ros\u00e9 flight right now, should you venture towards a more summer-like experience. As a Napa native, this place has the quality and the friendliness that I really enjoy in a restaurant. It reminds me of places like Angele and Celadon, where the menu is flavorful, fresh, and interesting, and the folks running the place enjoy seeing familiar faces. I'm looking forward to becoming even more familiar."], ["Kim S.", "My dad and sister took me here Sunday night for my birthday dinner. As soon as we were seated the server greeted us with an amuse bouche. Classy! My sister ordered the flat iron steak and scallops. Dad had the whiskey burger. I got the mole glazed pork chop. Hands down the best pork chop I have ever had. Tender as could be with a slightly sweet/smoky glaze. Dad said the same about his burger and he and sister both loved that their meat was perfectly cooked as requested: medium rare. For dessert we shared the huge serving of bread pudding. Fantastic! Again, the best I've ever had.I will be a repeat customer at Formoli's for special occasions; my budget doesn't allow me to be a regular. But that's fine, I wouldn't want to spoil myself!"], ["Tina N.", "Before coming here, my boyfriend already knew what he wanted to order: their Whisky Burger. He is always on the hunt for the best burger in Sacramento. I on the other hand needed time to think. After much deliberation, I chose the meatball sandwich. I absolutely LOVED the meatball sandwich. Although a little on the saltier side for me, it was delicious and went so well with the side salad. I was tempted to order more salad because their dressing was so delectable. I had some of his whiskey burger as well. It was just as reviews have said, delicious especially with a side of fries and their homemade ketchup! Personally I couldn't finish half a meatball sandwich and half a Whiskey Burger so I chose the latter to have my boyfriend finish. He was more than pleased.We used an Amazon Local Deal ($10 for $20). We ended up paying $4 by the end of the meal. AMAZING."], ["Cee Cee L.", "This place is a tastebud adventure! Love love. Would drive hours to get to eat here. Always order the dates and the poutine. Then we always share an entree to get to taste everything. This is one of my top and most favorite restaurant!"], ["Suzy Q.", "Had the Whiskey burger everyone raved about on here and needless to say it was pretty lackluster. For starters, I asked for medium-rare (something I've become accustomed to doing since 90% of restaurants never get it right) and it came out over cooked and medium-well. So off goes my plate and it takes another 10-15 minutes before I get to eat. All the while my son finishes his Po'boy sandwich in the meantime. I mean, the server could have atleast left me the fries to munch on. When I finally did get my burger it was already cut in half (I'm guessing the cook doesn't know the finger test with burgers and had to actually cut it to see that it was cooked to my liking). And in doing so- he let all the juice of the burger ooze out and although it was cooked less than before it STILL was over cooked. Not to mention that the flavor of the burger had no taste of being a whiskey burger but that of a very basic, ordinary burger I could have prepared myself at home. I'd go as far to say that the bun was the best part about the burger. So on #NationalCheeseburgerDay I left disappointed and wishing I would've taken my walk to lunch to Bistro 33 instead. Or even Limelight..."], ["John P.", "Really enjoyed our dinner here. Went against all the reviews for the life changing whiskey burger and got a few small plates instead. Glad we did.

I have read many Yelp friends' reviews about how delicious the food is here and I figured I'd give it a try. I guess I was quite lucky at parking because I found a parking spot along J Street, a few feet away from the restaurant. Maybe it was because it was a Sunday? \u00a0I was also lucky because I failed to check if there was a meter, or if there was a time limit. Yikes! I could've gotten another parking ticket! Anyway, parking was quite a breeze, that day.I met my girlfriend here for lunch. I arrived first, a female server told me to seat myself anywhere. I did, and she brought over the wine list and menu. When my girlfriend arrived, I asked the server if they had any cocktail specials, she said they only serve wine and beer. Sigh! We ordered two of their IPA ales and we both ordered the famous Whiskey Burger. We couldn't resist. Girlfriend had fries with hers and I ordered a salad with mine.Our burgers arrived in a decent amount of time. While waiting, we looked around and noticed that every table had ordered a Whiskey Burger! We both ordered our burgers medium well and we cut it to make sure it was cooked to our liking. It was cooked perfect, no complaints there. The burger was juicy and seasoned perfectly. I like the habanero aioli, wish there was a little more on the burger, the arugula was unlike \u00a0your boring staple of lettuce, onion and tomato. With that being said,the only roughage you have within your burger is the arugua (a delicate, peppery lettuce). I would say that our burger was \"frugalicious!\" With my Groupon which was for $20, I ended up with a remaining balance of $13. Now that's frugalicious! Posting my review now because I'm not sure if I'll be coming back. The whiskey burger was good, but didn't stand out. With the whiskey burger being the most notable favorite among reviewers, I tried, and I'll pass!"], ["Alice W.", "I wanted to like this place but sadly \"like\" would be a bit of an overstatement. We got the whiskey burger and poutine. Both had a lot of potential but the whiskey burger came out extremely well-done, heavy, and dry. Hardly appetizing combination. The poutine also didn't taste or feel fresh (some fries were overcooked and even a little stale) and also came off extremely heavy. The service was fast and perky, on the plus side. I just really didn't fall in love in the food. Not surprising though, heavy and dry food is very typical for Sac."], ["Lisa K.", "Absolutely amazing from the moment we walked in the door. All pro no con, from the food to the service to the decor. We had the Whiskey burger and it was everything it is hyped up to be on this site. Absolutely the BEST burger I have ever had.

Might be the best burger I've ever had, it was very juicy, the buns just fell apart because of all the juices flowing from the meat. Staff was great and provided excellent service.

Boy, am I glad he passed it onto us. The food was...how do I put this...divine. Balanced, tasty and presented to utter perfection. On this lovely hump day we sampled the mussels, whiskey burger and the beat salad. Not quite sure where to being with my description of these three beauties. Can I just say my mouth is watering just thinking about it? And I feel like I didn't even get to try the really awesome things, like the fish stew or the pork chops....must....return...The mussels were coupled with a coconut-curry broth that was absolute heaven. It made for a great dipping sauce with the complementary sourdough bread (low rent of me to do, maybe, but I couldn't let that sauce go to waste). The portions were extremely generous and I had zero issue with the $14 price tag. I highly recommend. As for my whiskey burger...oh, my sweet sweet whiskey burger. I have to say it's probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. Not so much because of the fixins but because the meat was cooked to medium rare godliness. Very few places cook medium rare right and the chef did right by me. I'm sure this was aided by the fact that the beef is 5 dot ranch beef...\"melt in your mouth tenderness, freshness you can taste, flavor you can savor..\" Yes. All of it. Forever. And such taste for a meager $13 dollars? Honey, check me in FOREVER. As for Jason's shaved fennel and beet salad, I can't really describe its flavor because I spent the vast majority of my time shut down and enamored by my burger, but I can certainly comment on the presentation. The arugula leaves were drizzled with a nice tarragon vinaigrette and topped with some lovely toasted brie. I've got to say, the part I loved the most were the wonderfully red and gold beets. I love beets. I had to have them and I almost tried to act a fool and snatch them off Jason's plate with my dainty and precision like fingers, but had to catch myself. NO, I can't be that racheta in this classy restaurant with all these fine east sacramento people. No GODT. (I've lost my marbles over a $9 salad -- well played chef, well played). Our server Ryan was super. Very friendly, knowledgable and diligent. I think over the course of the hour we were there we had at least a handful of table touches and my water was always filled. No complaints, fully stars in that department. Now for the ambiance of the restaurant..I'm not sure if I'm the only person in Sacramento who hasn't heard of this little gem, but I wasn't expecting it to be as nice/quaint as it was. It's definitely got a modern feel to it and the food doesn't hold to any one particular European cuisine (tho it clearly incorporates some Spanish, some Italian, some French). Immediately upon entering I realized I was underdressed. I'm no coxcomb, but let's be real, if you're gonna stop in at Formoli, go ahead and make it a special occasion and dress up a bit. I would have loved to take some cute selfies and hash tagged #classycat if I dressed up a little more. you catch my drift. Alright I've droned on long enough. Loved this spot, loved the price, loved the service and most importantly, LOVED the food. Thank you Formoli Bistro team for bringing all of your amazingness to the Sacramento dining scene."], ["Britta G.", "We heard rave reviews about the best burger in town.

I am so happy that my friend wanted to try this place, or else I never would have. The restaurant is interesting to say the least. The outside seating is gorgeous at night with burning glass fireplaces to keep you warm; it looks very modern. However, the inside is very classic looking with an island bar and plenty of booths; you definitely don't feel like you're eating in the new millennia. I came here just in time for happy hour scallops; 3 seared scallops for $5!!! What a steal! The scallops were good; not the best I've ever had, but for $5 you can't complain.For the main course, I had the Branzino. Prior to this experience, I have never had Branzino before. I might not be the best person to listen to, but I like to think that I still know what good food taste like (I hope!). If i had to describe that entree in one word it would be: addictive, which is so bad for my wallet! I can't rave enough about this dish; it's fresh, well seasoned, light, well textured, juicy, etc. It's literally everything you want from a perfectly cooked fish!If you have a chance, I think you should definitely stop by and try the Branzino while you can!

I was surprised that it was not as expensive as I had expected, lunch was reasonable for a nice sit-down style meal. I ordered the lobster flatbread, which was excellent. Crispy crust, with chunks of tender lobster, melted cheese, slices of scallion, lemon zest, roasted red peppers, and a lobster sour cream that really rounded out the flavor. I got the lunch combo of flatbread with field green salad, which had fresh greens, tomatoes, cucumber, and seeds (unsure of what kind).

I was surprised to see so many new restaurants popping up near the Arden mall. Having lived in Sac for almost 9 years this area has not always been the best. In fact I basically avoided it for the longest time. Seasons has been here for about 2 years and based on the reviews from yelp we decided this would be my birthday dinner on Monday night. The happy hour drink and small plate specials are outstanding. I was really excited to see the different Spanish wines available by the glass and bottle. My girls even enjoyed their meals which is rare for picky young kids. I ordered the filet, my gf had the ahi tuna salad and for dessert we each picked out one of their small selections offered. The server even took a picture and printed it out for us.

We were seated right away (without a reservation which was great), we were a party of 6. The food was very good, fresh, excellent presentation etc. The service from our server was extremely mediocre, and that is a stretch. She seemed as though the last thing she wanted to be doing was waiting on tables. One of my main issues was the server chose not to write down any of our orders, which i typically don't mind if you are skilled enough to remember all the specifics; however, the server didn't write anything down and messed up half of the orders. We were brought things we didn't order, there were items she didn't put in until it was brought to her attention that it was never received. Her comment was \"oh i didn't know you wanted that\", well if you would have written the orders down this would not have happened. At the end of our meal, the server went to remove some plates from the table and instead of reaching across the table or asking us to pass her items to remove (we were at a large round table), she reached over the head of one of the people at the table and managed to drop a fork on the top their head with little concern. One person from our party did speak with management prior to us leaving, we were given a gift card for a later date which was a nice gesture of compensation; however, it would be nice if the server had a better approach to her job. Being a server is a position that requires great customer service and she definitely needs to work on her's.

We started with the lobster flat bread...which was absolutely delicious and light! Loved that it was tasty, but didn't fill you up before dinner!

Also, this mixer spot is where I first met fellow Yelp Elite members Elaine F. and Kaycie L. -- nothing but good vibes I tell you. I don't always go to the mall, but when I do I can think of a reason to eat here. Firstly, their seasonal menu changes every 4 months but they tend to have the same basic items such as flatbreads, salads, a vegetarian sampler plate, meat entrees, seafoods, and an extensive wine bar and dessert shooters. The accompaniments or flavors do tend to change depending on time of year (for example, asparagus vs. butternut squash) but always work well together. Best part is that each menu item is 475-500 calories or less! My favorites are the flatbreads, scallops, ahi salad, the desserts, and drinks (they make a strong Moscow Mule!). You don't just get a dessert menu, you get a dessert display (a la the dessert tray at Il Fornaio) with all of the shooters described to you while right up in your face. Delicious. For some reason I tend to go for the fruity, non-chocolatey ones.What gets me every time is how once you enter the restaurant you're transported, forgetting you're at a shopping mall at all. There is a piano man playing at the bar, heated outdoor patio that amazingly hides the fact that on the other side is parking lot, spacious booths, a separate room for private events, etc. For special occasions the waiter/server will even take your table's photo and print the picture for you to take home (Esquire Grill being the only other place I know that does this), sometimes they have little cards saying Happy Anniversary or Happy Birthday, and also a comped dessert. Really makes for a very pleasant dining experience! Great for small groups, reservations recommended during peak hours. They do have valet like Cheesecake Factory but it's an easy walk, can't miss it, right aross from BJ's near that mall entrance. They do have giftcards too."], ["Greg L.", "Have been here before and it was good but this time was bad.

Went last night with some friends who had never been and they all enjoyed the food. The wine list is perfect and my swordfish was delicious. The dessert \"shots\" are a must. The chicken pesto flatbread was also a pleasant surprise."], ["Megan S.", "We had a gift card and came here to celebrate a belated birthday dinner for my boyfriend.Went here on Friday night and was immediately impressed by the exceptional service. There was no available seats on the patio and since we didn't want to wait 30 minutes for a table we opted to sit inside. The indoor ambiance was fantastic, lighting is dim, decor is modern. Can watch the chefs cook since the kitchen is completely transparent and can be seen through glass. Dinner was amazing. For starters we ordered the Grilled Chipotle-spiced chicken skewers. Only comes with 3 skewers for $9.30, but they're well worth it.For entrees my boyfriend ordered the Southern style shrimp and grits and I had the Wood-grilled pork tenderloin. \u00a0The sweet potato mash was perfect, maybe the best sweet mashed potatoes EVER. We tried multiple dessert minis and it was hard to choose a favorite. \u00a0Since it was a birthday dinner our server Vanessa gave us two minis for free, and even took a picture of us. \u00a0Those minis can be dangerous--- you can't just have one!!Since the dessert flavors change we will definitely be back to sample any new additions.Our server Vanessa C. was very attentive and personable. Best service I have had in a LOONG time. Our water glasses never went dry, she was very knowledgeable about the menu."], ["Jen W.", "I went to a YEE here a couple of years ago and finally made it back for a true dining experience. \u00a0We made a reservation on opentable and our wait was only a couple of minutes. \u00a0The restaurant is decoratively upscale...hard to believe that this is in the Darden group (Oiive Garden, Red Lobster, etc.). \u00a0Frankly, there should be more of this restaurant elsewhere!What an experience we had. \u00a0The service was impeccable. \u00a0Her name was Hope and she blew customer service out of the water...probably, the best service I have ever had. \u00a0I was impressed that the company educated the staff with the menu by allowing them to try everything. \u00a0She was able to give us numerous recommendations. \u00a0Best thing about the menu? \u00a0Everything is under 450 calories. \u00a0Wow. \u00a0So I ordered the whole branzino served with potatoes and broccolini. \u00a0The fish was cooked beautifully while stuffed with lemons and fresh herbs. \u00a0We also had the rack of lamb served with mashed potatoes and mixed veggies...DELISH. \u00a0We originally started off with the ahi tuna tartare...not my favorite but still tasty. \u00a0Lastly, we each picked a small dessert. \u00a0I had the key lime blueberry one while G had the pecan pie one. \u00a0Don't be deterred that this restaurant is located at a mall. \u00a0The restaurant has an identity of its own. \u00a0I plan to make this place a staple in the future. \u00a0Solid 5 stars."], ["Tasha C.", "A friend recommended Seansons 52 as I was in the area for business. \u00a0It did not disappoint. \u00a0The atmosphere is relaxed and the decor is beautiful.

The grilled meatballs were delicious. \u00a0It was sitting in the yummiest tomato and cheese sauce. I also had the lollipop lamb chops. \u00a0The 1st bite i wasn't impressed as it was too fatty but for \u00a0$5, I was willing to give it another try. \u00a0I \u00a0decided to take another bite and was happy I didn't send it back, \u00a0yummy glaze and crust.I had a glass of Jam Jar White Wine to go with my small plates. If you're a sweet wine person, \u00a0it's a must try. \u00a0Sweet with a bit of a zing. Service was excellent and the Bar Ladies were pleasant and friendly. \u00a0The reasons for the 4 stars are due to the fatty lamb chops and it took 20 minutes to bring out my small plates; a little opps but it will not stop me from coming back."], ["Melynda D.", "My partner surprised me by taking me here for Sweetest Day. I could have not been more pleased with the choice. We had a reservation made at 7:30pm for a Friday night and decided to get there about an hour early so that we could enjoy a couple of cocktails before dinner. We checked in at the front for our reservation and then found seating at the bar right away. Our bartender at the bar was friendly, funny, and knowledgeable. She helped us pick out some great glasses of wine before our meal. Not only was the wine selection huge, the bartender was extremely knowledgeable and had a full understanding of the selection. Once seated everything stayed just as great. I ordered from their seasonal menu and had the mushroom bisque soup and the mushroom flatbread as my meal. My boyfriend had a shrimp pasta. Both meals were delicious. The service was just as a great as the food. We wrapped our meals with desserts that hit the spot. I had a the pumpkin pie shooter like dessert and my boyfriend had the chocolate one, both were divine and capped off the meal beautifully. Our waitress was knowledgeable and provided great service from the beginning of our meal until we left. I would suggest making a reservation ahead of time because some of the people who came in without reservation had a wait time ranging from 30 minutes- 1 hour on the Friday night that we went. Also, we utilized the free valet parking the restaurant provides, I would suggest using that because finding parking that close to the mall on a weekend is no fun at all."], ["Le M.", "We had an amazing time here last night!!The food selection was amazing. \u00a0The waitress was knowledgeable of the menu.

Excellent service. The wine list was extensive and well thought out with most wines being available by the glass. The bar was a bit slow in getting out the drinks. The crust on the steak and blue cheese flatbread was very thin and quite good. My tablemates seemed to like their trout and salmon. My short rib was tasty, but was not \"silky smooth\" as the waitress described. Rather it was stringy and required a knife. \u00a0Given the total bill was over $50 per person including wine I expected better of the short rib."], ["Kristian D.", "Seasons 52 is a relatively new full service restaurant located in Arden Fair Mall. The restaurant is accessible only from the outside which helps reduce the noise from the normal mall traffic. Their fancy modern entrance is right near the main entrance. I visited Seasons 52 as part of a YEE and was impressed by the look and feel of the place immediately, although it was very hot on the upscale outdoor patio.The event was an opportunity to sample the seasonal appetizers and special wines available at Seasons 52. There were a few logistical issues, but the overall food was top notch. Most of the items were variations on traditional heavy appetizers - shrimp skewers, meatballs, etc. - but they all had great ingredients with the flatbreads really shining. Their peppers and blue cheese option tasted great, but it ended up being too messy and complicated to enjoy in a buffet setting.The selections of wine were rather eclectic with some interesting imports. Wine is always subjective, but the fact that they have these options indicates someone is really paying attention behind the bar. Speaking of which, inside the air conditioned building lies a massive and wonderful bar with plenty of bar and table seating. It meshes well with the overall dark and intimate feel of the restaurant.This would be a great place to meet friends for a quick happy hour or an impromptu dinner. It may be a little weird having date night at the mall, but Seasons 52's seasonal menu and beautiful interior are a great combo."], ["Diane G.", "We had an event here and WOW was it good. I had been once before and already loved the place but this experience really topped it off. First of all, every dish under 500 cals? yes please. \u00a0We happened to be on the patio on a 105 degree day and the staff made it much more tolerable with their top notch service. Huge points, they happened to have my favorite white wine for summer (which I can't find any where else except for Hook and Ladder) Vinho Vearde- If you like white wine TRY IT.Now for the Food: We had quite a few things but the stuffed mushrooms, beef skewers, different Flat breads, and meatballs really stood out. Everything was great. Can't wait to come back!"], ["Christyne T.", "This use to be my favorite place... for happy hour. Good eats, good wine and relaxing live piano. They have gotten rid of the live piano. That is what made this bar particularly distinct. Now it's just another bar/restaurant. Nothing special, just another chain with overpriced food. For example, they charge $4.50 for corn... I don't see how they justify that when corn on the cob is like 20cents at the store. And then $4.50 for broccoli also, again, broccoli is pretty cheap. Granted the food has always been good but I can make most of it at home. I will return when they bring the live piano back."], ["Aneesh R.", "I liked my dish a lot! I got the lamb with yukon mash and red wine reduction sauce. Tasted amazing. I also had a meyer lemonade- which was also amazing"], ["Marissa C.", "Love the concept and implantation of farm to table and the seasonal menu deserves a five star. A restaurant that changes their menu regularly.... Just on point!! \u00a0Ordered the blackened mahi tacos and stuffed mushrooms... Absolutely delicious. And, coming from an angle of preferring savory to sweet things, the desert AND presentation... Could've ordered more (rare for deserts). \u00a0A very, very strong four.. Hard not to give it a five (propane scent and dirty fork are my reasoning) BUT the service was also five star without a doubt. \u00a0We're on our way to a wedding after and when we were seated they asked if we had any time constraints or appointments to get to. \u00a0Would absolutely come back without a doubt when in Sac again."], ["CK T.", "Seasons 52 is the place to go if you are looking for a healthy meal in a fairly upscale, classy environment.

Well, my calorie counting days are over, I'll have this, that, and this. One does not need to restrict when eating right :)I always appreciate a restaurant that offers alternative menus based on dietary preferences. They offer dairy sensitive, sodium friendly, gluten-free, vegetarian, and vegan menus! Ofcourse I requested a vegan menu. Since my special other was getting the Vegetarian Tasting entree (or should we call it the Vegan Tasting?) I decided to get the Cedar Plank Roasted Tofu with Broccoli and Roasted Crushed Tomatoes. For appetizers we ordered the Artichoke Flatbread and the Roasted Roma Tomato Flatbread, both without cheese. Everything tasted wonderful. You can tell there was not much salt and oil used on the dishes but rather the ingredients spoke for themselves. The flatbreads were crispy and the toppings were yummy. The sampler my SO ordered was the most colorful plate on the table (among omnis) as well as the most delicious. (I regret not ordering the same one after stealing a few bites!) My entree was a wonderful HCLF (high carb low fat) meal. If your looking for something filling and flavorful, try the Cedar Plank Roasted Tofu. It may have been a bit dry, but this allows you to taste the flavors they infused in the tofu and the simple sweetness of the vegetables. But I definitely recommend the Veg Tasting if you want to sample everything!!I also had a Raspberry Lemonade and ooO it was on the sour side but refreshing. They use fresh raspberries and garnish it with mint. Overall, a pleasant experience.

That night we talked about our lives while we enjoyed a steak dinner and some fine wine. As it wound down, I left feeling a little closer to my father. I think Seasons is special place.

The crisp wonton chips paired with melt-in-your-mouth ahi tuna bits, Sriracha mayo, raw onion and avocado worked in every bite. So flavorful! If I just stuck to this dish, the restaurant would have a 5-star review.Loco Moco: this dish was a miss for me. On one hand, I did ask for well-done on my hamburger patty so that was dry, but so was the entire dish. This dish is supposed to have gravy smothering everything, but there wasn't enough. I felt like a fat kid asking for extra gravy on the side...Also, the rice actually tasted old and had soft and hard pieces in every bite. I'm Asian, so of course I only like my rice soft and sticky! The fried egg was actually well presented and was actually the best part of the dish. I don't think I'd pay so much for a perfectly fried egg again though.Monkey bread: monkey bread can be done really well or just come out hard and inedible. This was the case for us. The caramelized bread was so hard to bite into, even with ice cream on top. I do not recommend this! I would like to come back and give it another fair try to see if there is an improvement.

Came here fairly early around 11:00am. Our party of 14 was split amongst two high top tables that are not equipped with hooks for your purse! (Just a personal annoyance.) Our server was fantastic and was attentive to our table. Came around often to replenish our drinks. I ordered Mac and cheese trio along with the garlic shrimp pizza with added chicken. I decided to order the tavern, basil pesto and lobster as my Mac and cheese options. All were good, but unfortunately none comparable to the Mac and cheese at Sandra Dee's!! (Still the BEST in town!) The pizza was subpar. Couldn't taste a hint of garlic on it at all. The pizza was topped with shrimp, Alfredo sauce along with cilantro and tomatoes. They weren't too generous with the toppings. The price for added chicken was at a hefty price of $4.95. Not worth it. The chicken was extremely dry! Definitely enjoyed the interior design and ambiance.

Iron Horse has some issues that go beyond recent-opening jitters. It's a poor take on a tired concept. Our first visit on a Saturday night was disappointing, but considering they'd only been open a month at that point and still had lines out the door, it was to be expected. Our large part waited almost an hour after the anticipated time we were to be seated only because the party in front of us took their sweet ass time before leaving - long, drawn out discussions of the bill, a round of drinks from the bar, more talks about who would pay, etc. No matter how many dirty looks we flashed, they still wouldn't leave. Once we were finally seated, the food and service were hit-and-miss. The nachos were decent but my steak was bathed in a sickly sweet glaze and extremely fatty, as evidenced by the mound of fat I piled on the edge of my plate over the course of the meal. \u00a0My second visit came when my wife and I popped in on a whim for some midday Saturday brunch. Again, the wait was painful. We stood around for 45 minutes for a table for two plus our baby. And again, I couldn't fault them for being popular. Our server was very nice and attentive and once we'd finally been seated, I figured this would be the redemptive meal. Unfortunately, the meat in my Loco Moco (hamburger patties and gravy, fried rice and sunny side-up eggs) was extremely undercooked. It was only after I'd eaten most of it that I discovered what was a nearly raw second patty oozing with blood underneath it all. I told our server and she offered for them to cook me another one. No thanks, a refund is really what would have been appropriate.One of the few bright points is their bar and tap selection. Despite a constant hoard of people, the bartenders seem attentive and on their game. Look past the hubbub and this is just another restaurant serving a mediocre take on what Yelp categorizes as \u00a0\"American (New.\" Firestone, which I believe has the same owners, does it all much better, even with the crowds."], ["Erica D.", "Great beer selection!

Reasonable prices as well."], ["Jenni T.", "I came to Iron Horse Tavern a few weeks ago for Happy Hour with some friends. I arrived around 5:20pm on a weekday and was surprised how PACKED they already were! There is a huge patio out front which was already filled, and I didn't see many empty tables or seats at the bar inside either. Fortunately we had a nice comfy booth reserved to the right of the bar so it was easy finding a place to sit. It was also nice because we had a perfect seat for people watching! The crowd seemed to be a little older with most people in their 40s and a lot of professionals. Nice.I ordered the Giant Pretzel which was good. Our server let us know that it is the same pretzel that's at Firestone down the street! It came with a beer cheese which I liked, but also a bacon jam which as a Vegetarian, I wasn't able to try. Next time I'll just ask for double beer cheese.Since it was Happy Hour I ordered two of their specialty cocktails. The first was a Dark and Stormy Mojito which they used a darker rum for. It was ok, but I think I'll just stick to a regular Mojito next time. My second drink was the Mustang Sally which was good (flavorful but not too sugary) but after two cocktails (and little food) I was disappointed that I didn't feel even the slightest buzz. So what did I do? Shots. Now this is one reason I only gave them four stars. Maybe I'm not used to buying my own drinks, but in my experience shots are always cheaper than mixed drinks. So I ordered three tequila shots for my two friends and I. My total? $27. $9 Tequila Shots?! Then my other friend ordered a few Fireball shots for the crowd. $8 each. You can get a whole bottle of Fireball at Walmart for $10.86. Wtf. So after weak cocktails and pricey shots, I have decided this is the place to go to for food, but to possibly have beverages somewhere else. To finish off the night I tried one of their Beignets which came with a nice berry sauce and super tasty chocolate ganache. Yummy! I would like to come back and try more of the food and sit on the restaurant half or spend a nice evening on the patio."], ["Shelby D.", "Just had dinner here! We were looking for an excuse to try more after that awesome brunch. This time, we arrived around 8pm for dinner on a week night and we were seated on the patio right away. Nice!We shared the combination pizza and I had a kale Cesar salad. The kale Cesar was really good! Not too much dressing. Fresh Parmesan cheese. My fianc\u00e9 had the Luau Chicken Salad. He thought it was good. The pizza was for sure the best part. We are already making plans to return for the Poke nachos and the fried pickles and onions! We also had some more great cocktails. I had the Daybreak with rum and elderflower liqueur and flowers floating in it. Yum! Very sweet. My fianc\u00e9 had the dark and dirty mojito. Overall, fun time!"], ["Michelangelo S.", "Coming Together For Food & Fun In A Great Chill EnvironmentSITREPI have really enjoyed the expansion of R Street corridor. When Shady Lady, R15, and the businesses sandwiched between them came, there was energy added to the lunch environment (I only work a few blocks away) and excitement for more night time options.With addition of Iron Horse Tavern (IHT) on the OTHER side of R Street, there is added NEW culinary fun.THE SETUPI've been fan of the Wong Family for more than two (2) decades and they represent a successful branding for restaurants & nightclubs. \u00a0Without them, this city would be lacking a lot of vitality without their substantial contributions to this community.HISTORY*Back in the 90s, Alby (owner of IHT) and brothers Mason & Curtis were stoking the yummy flames of the Luau Gardens, the Chinese buffet restaurant that was in the strip mall across the street from the Arden Faire Mall. \u00a0The banquet rooms for this restaurant suddenly launched into THE BEST dance club that I have ever know in Sacramento: \u00a0THE RAGE, later to be renamed BARCODE before Luau Gardens first, and later BARCODE, shut down in 2012 because of demolition & reconstruction of the strip mall. *But before this happened, Alby, Mason and their parlayed their talents into opening the complex at 15 & L Streets that consisted of Majongs (a wonderful Asian-fusion casual dining restaurant), The Park Ultra Lounge (a very energetic & hip dancing club - consisting of some of the same DJs, Promoters and Managers that got their start at THE RAGE), and Mason's, which was later renamed Cafeteria 15L (and classy restaurant which has the best brunches on the weekends, and elegant dining in the evening.*And from here, the Wong Family also opened THE MIX, a very exciting rooftop club just a block over from The Park Ultra Lounge. \u00a0And I'm sure I'm missing some of their other establishments, but these are just a few of the highlights of how they have imprinted the Sacramento community with their vision of great food and fun entertainment.ENTER IRON HORSE TAVERNWhat I love about IHT is it's different vibe from all the other places the Wongs have pioneered. \u00a0It feels both *fresh* and yet also traditional. \u00a0You have a gorgeous bar culture along the lines of an Irish pub, and yet there is a substantial element given over to the sports bar culture as well.When I was here recently with friends, however, it was for none of these things. \u00a0We got cozy in 2 adjacent booths and had ourselves a party, with refreshing libations & delicious foods.EXTENSIVE TASTY HAPPY HOUR OFFERINGSAnd no matter what else I said above about the history & appreciation for the Wong family's stamp on this restaurant & clubbing community, it is the FOOD that will keep bringing back. \u00a0I have to give it to their menu creators for a terrific array of very different options, spanning culinary cultures from the Deep South to Seattle to the fusion-dishes of Peru and all points in between, a virtual cornucopia of savory & sweet tastegasms. \u00a0These include:* Deep-fried pickles, with a tantalizing cream sauce and are always a treat * Deep-Fried Onions that Amazeballz in a thick whiskey batter* The Deep-Fried Chicken (notice there's a \"theme\" with deep-fried?) is scrumptious!yelp.com/biz_photos/iron\u2026* Poke Nachos that had a spicy Asian flare!yelp.com/biz_photos/iron\u2026* AND the Mac & Cheese Trio, with different kinds; Classic, Basil & Jalape\u00f1o, Ole!yelp.com/biz_photos/iron\u2026DESSERT I had the Stuffed Waffles, that come with Ice Cream, Blueberries & Strawberries, and covered with a deeply satisfying Caramel Sauce. \u00a0Probably shouldn't have eaten all of it. \u00a0But I DID, and LOVED it.yelp.com/biz_photos/iron\u2026STAFFThe staff who served us were diligent in taking our orders, checking back with us with only a few minutes in between, and provided us with all the orders we asked for as well as getting us refills on our drinks when needed and desired quickly.In addition, the hostesses were very diligent in making sure members of our party who came at various times over the course of 2 hours got to our tables without further ado. \u00a0PARKING & TRANSITThis is downtown, YES, but you can easily snag a parking spot on the street within a block or two in the evening. \u00a0For lunch, I would recommend you walk or just jump on the light-rail with the 15th St. station literally just only one block up.. \u00a0THE LOWDOWNMy thanks goes to The Wong Family - and especially Alby - for providing another outstanding environment to enjoy food & drinks with friends."], ["TRACY R.", "What makes this place different from all the other bars in town?

Get the breakfast board, the buttermilk biscuits and the creme brulee oatmeal and share it with some friends.

The place is spacious with outdoor seating, a full bar, and TVs. The menu is pretty simple but still with lots of options.I ended up getting the egg white frittata which came with asparagus and potatoes with a mixed green salad and goat cheese and two slices of toast. It was delicious! Super flavorful and light. My only complaint is NOT ENOUGH GOAT CHEESE!!My sister and friend shared the waffles and spanish frittata. The waffles were four mini waffles served with fresh fruit and syrup. Perfect portion and super cute to boot.My other two friends got the chicken and waffles. It smelled suuuuper delicious but did look a little burnt. They noticed that it was all white meat but it still managed to be super juicy.Will definitely have to return for more brunch and possibly happy hour."], ["Alex T.", "After seeing all the other yelper elites review i had to come here to experience it myself. With not know what to order i had to do some serious thinking. Came here after the color run which was a good and bad idea! i was super thirsty and tired and hungry! It was perfect time for bottomless mimosas and yea that is what i did with my friend! believe it our not, i did not leave a single drop in my champagne glass haha. Vibe/layout Of course when i walked in there was waiting even though they had space. We had waited for a good 15 mins which was acceptable. Had went to go use the restroom to wash up and found it clean and new! Awesome bar lay out and with multiple outlets under the bar counter for you to charge your phone while your sitting at the bar. Love that! will try to come here for happy hour and get some drinks in and just kick back after a long day in the office. Also great waiting area with comfy cross hatch stitched black leather booths in the waiting area and dining area as well. Love the checkered black and white floors. Awesome decor on the building with a nice modern touch. i did get confused with the entrance and its facing R st. by the way. \u00a0Food CHILI RELLENO Since it was brunch time, i order the brunch food from the menu. I asked the server what is good and she sold me that they only make this dish on the weekend during brunch time. So instantly all my hard decisions became a piece of cake. Had made the right decision! my friend followed me and order the same thing! The only difference is i had sunny side eggs, love when the egg yolks leak onto certain bites. So the dish had black beans not he very bottom, then the crispy fried tortilla filled with homemade green verde salsa and chorizo as well. Then topped with their homemade red tomato sauce and topped with 2 sunny side eggs. Also a stuffed pepper on the side which was very good as well! i believe the stuffed pepper was the main character of the dish a haha.... but overall i can taste the different layers of flavor and texture as well. worth the 13 bucks for this dish. Also GREAT AWESOME SAUCE PRESENTATION! Drinks BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS Well you have to order an entree before they let you do bottomless. Meaning unlimited mimosas and yes to cheap champagne and oj! oj such as orange juice! i don't think the oj was cold pressed but it was doable. Just drink until your little heart gives out and your illusions are spinning haha..... no just drink until you are fine and feel the glow well asian glow for me. haha... i def say it was worth the 11 bucks. i told my server what my limit was, and told her to stop me at that number. She didn't have a problem with it and was very nice and did what i said haha. Location Awesome location! love it! i call it the new midtown area which is R st where it has really grown by adding lots of new restaurants and bars around the area. I don't go to this area much unless I'm craving a good burger at burgers and brew or a good bowl of shoki Ramen! Parking Lots of parking in the neighborhood and parking meter area as well. i don't mind the one or 2 block walking, because we need our exercise. Overall Love this place for brunch or lunch. I told my friend i can see this place more for brunch and lunch, but not so much of a dinner place for me. I mean i haven't try it yet, maybe i am wrong, but til i experience it then i will do an update of this review. But for now perfect place to be at on a sunday morning or afternoon and catch up with some good friends."], ["Cheng S.", "I've been wanting to come here for brunch and finally got the opportunity. So what did I think? Not sure. Maybe, I ordered the wrong thing, but not as impressed. I ordered the waffle and my date got green eggs and ham. I really love waffles so why not give this a shot. Needless to say, I had better waffle in my days. It's missing some excitement. I even got bacon on the side, but still a little boring. I took a bite of the green eggs and ham from my lady friend and it was too salty for my taste bud. It has a nice nostalgia of Dr. Seuss, but not as good. This experience wasn't up to par. Only highlight is this place as a nice d\u00e9cor and hip. Hate to do this, but I'm giving it a 3-star. Until next time, that's my experience."], ["Allison L.", "My boyfriend, sister, brother in law, and I decided to go here for happy hour after Joe's Crab Shack ran out of shrimp (wtf, I know). \u00a0It looks really nice and it's always busy when we drive by, so I was excited to finally try it. \u00a0There was plenty of street parking available when we arrived around 5pm. \u00a0Happy hour is until 6 so it attracts customers coming straight from work - I noticed a lot of customers in suits/work clothes (myself included). \u00a0The host said the HH menu was available at the bar, booths behind the bar, high-top tables, and patio. \u00a0We were seated at a wooden bench style table on the patio. \u00a0The weather outside was nice and we were close enough to the building to be in the shade, which I appreciated. We decided to order a bunch of things and share. \u00a0Their HH food promotion is half off appetizers and pizzas.Tuna poke nachos: a huge plate of wonton chips with a generous portion of poke, diced tomatoes and avocados, sriracha mayonnaise, and garnished with furikake and micro greens. \u00a0I asked for no wasabi cream because I wasn't sure how wasabi-y it would be and I'm not a big fan. \u00a0This was delicious! The wonton chips were light/crispy, the fish was fresh, and the avocados and sriracha mayo added the right amount of creaminess. \u00a0I would order this again.Sweet and spicy shrimp: Like honey walnut shrimp with sriracha. \u00a0The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the sauce was addictive. \u00a0My boyfriend even dipped his pizza into it. \u00a0It's served on a bed of lettuce, which my brother in law ate because how good the sauce is. Asian style street tacos: marinated beef, shredded carrots, Asian bbq sauce, jalapeno, and cilantro all served in a bao! \u00a0Yum! \u00a0Comes with kimchee (my brother in law said it was good). \u00a0You get three to an order.Brandy fried chicken nuggets: \u00a0these are REAL pieces of chicken, not mushed up chicken reshaped into something else. The outside was crispy and the inside was still juicy. \u00a0Served with fries, ketchup, and sweet dipping sauce. This was my bf's favorite.Garlic Shrimp pizza: cream sauce pizza with shrimp, cilantro, red onions, and chili flakes. \u00a0It was sliced into 8 pieces and each piece had AT LEAST two shrimp. \u00a0I thought this was very generous. Watermelon Fizz mocktail: watermelon puree, honey, lemon juice, and ginger ale served in a mason jar, garnished with a lime wedge and li hing mui around the rim. \u00a0Very pretty and tasty. \u00a0Good alternative to an alcoholic beverage.Monkey bread: we added this at the end. Monkey bread with apples baked in a little cast iron skillet, topped with vanilla ice cream. \u00a0The top of the bread was crunchy and the bottom was soft. \u00a0Some of the cooked apples on the bottom turned black because of the pan, which looked weird, but overall it was tasty .The portions were larger than we all expected. \u00a0The food came out quickly as well. \u00a0The four appetizers came out at once, and the pizza shortly after. There are busers that clear and refill water. Our server was friendly and shared her favorite dishes with us. \u00a0She knew we were sharing so she brought us plates, which were warm. \u00a0I thought this was a nice touch.Everything was heading toward a 5-star review... until the check came. \u00a0The menu and our waitress said appetizers and pizza during happy hour are HALF OFF. \u00a0I don't know who did the math here, but it is not HALF.Brandy fried chicken nuggets are $8.95 on the menu... rang up as $4.50Asian style street tacos and Sweet and Spicy Shrimp are $9.95 on the menu... rang up as $5.00Tuna poke nachos are $12.95 on the menu... rang up as $6.50Garlic shrimp pizza $13.95... rang up as $7.00.Okay, now I know we're just talking about a couple cents here and there, but I'm not a cheapskate and I don't like feeling as if I'm being deceived. \u00a0And if you think about it, all these cents add up for the restaurant. \u00a0Why doesn't the restaurant just round up the original price so the HH prices actually ARE half off? \u00a0Also, our monkey bread was rang up as full price $7.50, when it is in the appetizer section of the menu, which should make it half off. \u00a0The worker did change the price after we asked, but I'm not sure if it was because the menu was misprinted and it shouldn't be in the appetizer section or he just did it to make us happy. \u00a0Either way, the whole pricing issue ended the meal on a slightly sour note.Nevertheless, I would return for happy hour. \u00a0The portions are fair, the food is tasty and fast, and the vibe is very relaxed. \u00a0I looked at the normal dinner menu and felt it was a little overpriced. It'd probably only eat dinner here for a special occasion kind of thing.Side note: My sister and I went to the restroom to wash our hands and they have touch faucets, which was pretty cool. \u00a0Bathroom could use some air freshener though (cough)."], ["Cynthia T.", "The first thing I noticed was the decor - it's beautiful. The hostess was very friendly as well as our waitress.Our table ordered the croque madam, shrimp garlic pizza and hamburger. The croque madam was ok. I've had better. It was kind of like French Toast with ham and Swiss cheese. \u00a0Even though it was packed - we didn't have to wait long for our meal so that was good.They have TVs and if you're inclined they have communal tables. The outdoor seating is nice and quite large.I'd probably come back here again to give it another shot."], ["Aaron T.", "Four stars for a good, solid draft beer selection, very tasty pizzas, delicious appetizers and great happy hour pricing.I tagged along with some co-workers for a happy hour to celebrate a work accomplishment, so everyone was in a good mood and ready to relax a bit. I started with a Firestone Walker 805 Blonde Ale, $7, (since they didn't have Goose Island and a few others that were on the menu) and their Tavern Combo pizza (pepperoni, Calabrian salami, pork sausage, bacon, tomato sauce, mozzarella and parmesan cheese for $13.95). The beer was actually $5 and the pizza, $7 and change, since it was happy hour. Like many Firestone Walker brews, I enjoyed the beer and the pizza was actually very, very good.At this point, I'm sold.I wrapped up with a stout -- which I can't remember the name of, since it wasn't on their menu. (I got it on the referral of one of my coworkers and was not disappointed.) So, I assume there are other drafts available that aren't on the menu. I didn't get up to look at the bar, so there's that.The restaurant itself is nice. There's a large, outdoor patio area and the bar area (where we sat) is clean and sharp-looking. The bathroom was clean and featured a somewhat disconcerting Dyson v-air jet air dryer. (Not the one that you put your hands in but one that shoots air out in a v-shape.) I mean, that's fine but just something that threw me for a loop. Hand-drying technology has advanced so much!Anyway, I had a great time and look forward to going back. The rest of the menu looks amazing and many commented on their mac 'n cheese selction. Thanks!"], ["Brainard B.", "My friend and I had a early dinner before heading out to the King's game. We were in Downtown didn't know where to go. So we yelped it and this location came up. Read some the the reviews and both of us decided to go here.I started with the Farm Fresh Salad and was surprised how well the vegetables were. All the leaves where nice healthy green leaves and was crunchy when eating it. To me the salads portions are huge.We also ordered the cheese plate which was very good. I just wish the cheeses were more of a higher grade cheese. The cheese that was on the board seem store package cheese that were just cut. But don't get me wrong, it was good. I finished my meal with a Margherita pizza. It was nicely portioned and good. The size is like a flat bread pizza. There were a lot of cheese and reds sauce on the pizza in which I like. This location is a typical bar restaurant. If you want a great place to hang out to drink and eat great food, this would be the place."], ["Serena L.", "Great brunch! Try the cinnamon apple pancakes!!! Good breakfast and great versions of the classic menu. Try the beef jerky bloody mary!"], ["Jesse P.", "Stopped in for a drink last weekend and found a spot at the bar. I ordered the \"last spike\" cocktail which is essentially a Sazerac, which is a favorite of mine. The bartender was on \u00a0point, making one of the best I have had so far. We didn't have any food, but all the meals that came out of the kitchen looked yummy. Will definitely be back!"], ["Charmaine S.", "So to celebrate my 1st official year of being in California after my move from the east coast we decided on brunch. My fianc\u00e9's cousin suggested this place since she went here last weekend and raved about it. And we now know why. It's located in the developing neighborhood of R and 15th streets. There is mostly street parking but there is a new pay lot that is near there if you are unable to get a spot. \u00a0This place has an open concept which I love. It has outdoor seating that has those big doors windows that open up into the restaurant. When you walk in the hostess stand is near the bar and open door area leading to the outdoor seating. The ladies there were so warm a friendly. This place doesn't take reservations during brunch hours I believe, but the wait was stated to be about 30 minutes. This place has a great concept of private or community tables to share with others that may come in. Pretty cool idea. They take your name and number and text you when the table is ready. So once we did that we started our bottomless mimosas tab at the bar and had a seat to watch the game and wait in these nifty nooks behind the bar area. It was probably about 15 mins later and I got a text that our table was ready. The hostess walks us over and gives us our menus and also tells us our waiter's name before he comes over. I think this is a nice intro touch. Our waiter ANTHONY was AMAZING from the start! So nice, knowledgable, and personable. He was great with suggesting and answering our questions. I ordered the Tavern Fried Chicken n ' Pancakes that comes with burbon-jalape\u00f1o syrup and 2 pieces of boneless fried chicken. My fianc\u00e9 ordered the Huevos con Chile Relleno. Both dishes were absolutely amazing. The chicken was hot and tasty the pancakes were so fluffy. And that syrup was just divine and unique. Since this was a cheat meal I wasn't able to finish all the pancakes but I sure did finish that chicken with a lil hot sauce. The Huevos was so flavorful. Anthony made sure that our glasses never stayed empty and came back to check on us and chat a lil when he could. Such a wonderful way to celebrate and watch the game. We will definitely make this a regular spot and we will always ask for Anthony if his area is available. Definitely check out this place. Definitely on my new list of brunch spots"], ["Nani V.", "I came back due to another friend's request. It was their first time, my third. This time, I ordered the ahi tuna poke nachos to share with the ladies and the tavern combo pizza. After 2 slices of the pizza, which was amazing by the way, bites of the poke nachos, a bite here and there of the other dishes, I was stuffed. I really enjoyed what I ordered; the nachos were enjoyed by everyone and the pizza, I took home. I kept eating it, a slice or two daily, until it was gone. Now, I know what to avoid and what to order. Still not my top choice of places, but once in a while I can see myself here. Our waitress did her job well, checking on us. One thing though, we got there right before six and she never mentioned that we still had a few minutes left before happy hour ended while taking our order. I didn't want to be that customer and wasn't in the mood, so I didn't say anything."], ["Nichole H.", "Tried this spot for lunch. I had the mac trio - jalape\u00f1o, lobster, and tavern. BOMB.

I noticed that the crowd started to clear out around that time. We were starving so we ordered Asian style street tacos, The big Leg, Beef Shortribs Strogi, and the monkey bread. Everything was pretty tasty, especially the Strogi. For some reason The Big leg came with two smaller turkey legs instead of one huge one. I think they ran out. I thought it was salty, maybe it was my tastebuds. Everything was delicious. I also ordered the mocktail Watermelon Fizz. It was good, but wished they had free refills because it was small. 2 Gulps and it was Gone!! Overall, I like this place. It's definitely good for late night eats."], ["Tracy P.", "My friend planned a brunch for 10 of us. She said this place doesn't take reservations (the website says it does) so she got there at 11:30 to put her name in. They said it would be an hour wait. We all arrived at 12:00 and weren't seated until almost 1:00! That started things off badly. Once seated we ordered drinks- most got bottomless mimosas but I got a strawberry lemonade with vodka. It was very good! I had seen the yelp reviews and pictures and wasn't sure what to order. I really thought I wanted the cinnamon roll pancakes but pushing 1:30 I thought maybe more lunch.... I got the asian street tacos as an appetizer- they were very good!! I ended up getting the juevos con relleno (chile relleno with eggs). It was really good! The very bottom was black beans - on top of that were 2 crispy fried tortillas- then eggs - then chile relleno- then sauce & cheese. The crunch of the tortillas made the dish! Make sure to get some hot sauce (they has tapatio- my fav!) because the relleno needs some spice!!! On yelp I saw they have a red velvet ho-ho! I had to try it! I'm obsessed with ho-hos! I couldn't really notice a difference from regular ho hos but the filling was more like cheesecake than a ho ho filling. The waitstaff was very friendly and surprisingly accommodated my friends that asked for all separate checks! Wow! Extra star for that!"], ["Fancy N.", "Came here for lunch and the wait wasn't that bad. We were seated in a section wedged in between 2 parties and were awfully close to them. It seemed as thought they were part of our party. As for the food, we tried the Asian Style Street Tacos, Tuna Poke Nachos, and Korean Fried Chicken and everything was pretty tasty. I tried the Iron Horse Tavern Bloody Mary and it was made pretty well. I have tasted better, but I'm glad it wasn't bad. There are so many other things on the menu that i'd like to come back and try."], ["Mandy L.", "Interesting menu going on with the loco moco, mac n cheese, and pizzas! Happy hour is Monday-Friday 3-6pm. It gets packed and busy around 5pm. They take orders fairly quickly even if you don't have seats at the bar. Take initiative to get the bartender's attention for food + drink orders, or you'll be waiting a while. Their half off pizzas are my favorite happy hour item. Request to add fresh jalape\u00f1os, it adds a nice kick :-) I wasn't expecting the basil pesto pizza to come with salami, olives, onions, and cherry tomatoes but it was still tasty. I'll try their red sauce flavors if I get the chance next time.Appetizers are also half off. The buffalo chicken eggrolls were stuffed with chicken and nothing else. I liked them but it may not be for everyone. It also came with a few celery sticks. Their monkey bread and cheesy bread looked tiny but tasty.My sister loves their trio Mac and cheese flight. The Lobster mac and chicken chorizo mac were surprisingly very bland. The only flavor I recommend is Bacon and Egg. Actually, you can make a better restaurant-style mac n cheese at home.Total for two large beers, two happy hour items, and trio mac was $40 w/ tip included. Pretty good deal but I wouldn't come again for happy hour unless a friend suggests it. There are many other options in town."], ["Karen T.", "Went here for a late lunch and had a good experience. Super cute place! I ordered the $10.95 Tavern Burger and definitely got my money's worth. The homemade chips I chose as my side were good and was more than enough. I was impressed by how quickly the food came out. Our server was also super friendly!I could have lived without the flies that kept flying around though."], ["Ameenah M.", "This place is right across the street from r15. You can't miss it. The outdoor seating is very big. Very noticeable. And the place is already very popular. You can't miss it. The entrance is on the side near dos coyote. You'll notice the very muscular security guard that opens the door for guests to enter. When you enter and turn a slight left you'll see a huge bar to the right and the host station right in front of you. To the left, it's an open patio the table looks like a picnic bench but very elegant (kind of) a much better looking picnic bench than what you would see at the park. And it's white, which probably seats 6 and a 4 top with brown chairs. Right behind the host station is a bit darker. Very upscale looking. Very pretty. Table tops. Booth tables that can fit three different parties. Very convenient during busy hours.Finally sat. Everyone's so nice. That's already a 5 star for me. Menu is the same exact style as the Firestone ( I mean come on, some type of same owners or not) What we ordered, ice tea for my twin sister, watermelon fizz ( watermelon pur\u00e9e, honey, lemon juice, ginger ale, and Li hing mui on the rim) and a black butte porter for myself . For appetizers, we ordered the wings, the mac n cheese bar trio: jalape\u00f1o,pesto, and lobster. The paella , and the monkey bread for dessert. Mm!!!!!!!What it tasted like: the tea tastes very tropical, hence the tropical ice tea. The fizz tasted like the fizz drink from Denny's. Still good but I can live without it. The porter was very good, if you like dark beers, then try the porter here, I certainly enjoyed it. The Mac trio was amazing. The pesto was my favorite. Especially with the bread crumbs on top: made it even better. (Sigh) I'm in love with it. Not too heavy, just good. The wings, were wings. Tasted like buffalo wings. Nothing amazing but nothing bad about them either. Exactly what I ordered. Now the paella I was disappointed about, it didn't taste exactly how I tasted before. Maybe that's because I tried it at the food truck convention and they added mayonnaise to it. Lol. Here at the iron horse it's just plain. But not bad, I was just hoping for more flavor. Let me tell you about this monkey bread I just ordered. I've seen it around on pictures and snap chat and now it's my turn to order it. Is it stale? Or is it because it's baked? Or is this because it's a monkey bread? I'm not a big fan of the texture because I want it to melt in my mouth like a cookie but it can't because it's bread but the flavor is really good. Would I come back? Of course, drinks were good, service was great and the Mac and cheese was good. I have to come back to try more !!"], ["Karen K.", "I've been wanting to try this establishment ever since it first opened several weeks ago. I'm so glad we did too.I was tipped by another Elite Yelper from out of town to sit in the bar areas or you will not get the half off prices. We asked the hostess if we had to sit at the bar to get the reduced prices for happy hour? She was very kind to let us know to sit in the booths area on the right side of the bar. We ended up in a booth that seated ten people easily even though it was just my HB and me!I ordered the short rib accompanied by kimchee & cucumbers & carrots, sweet and spicy shrimp with baby romaine lettuce, brandy fried chicken nuggets with French fries & the trio of Mac n cheese. For me I totally enjoyed the tasty fried shrimp with sriracha honey mayo and mac n cheese. I ordered the lobster, chicken chorizo & truffle Mac n cheese. I truly loved them as they were all equally so delish! Just a hint the mac n cheese was not half off.The short rib was okay as it did have the bones in it and that can get messy! The fried chicken nuggets entree with crunchy French fries was humongous! Reminded me of Mom's home cooking very similar to how she used to make her crispy fried chicken!The waitress enticed me by bringing the dessert menu! I decided to go ahead and order the red velvet ho-hos. It was an awesome suggestion as I totally thought it was TDF! \u00a0I only ate half and took the rest home. Yummy!!!I have to admit our waitress was so on point too! I wished I got her name! You know we will be back to try more food! We loved the cool dark ambiance of the tavern plus there was good sized outdoor patio seating which reminded me of Napa downtown or San Jose's Santana Row. Very classy and upscale! We lucked out parking just across the street too! You know we will be back to try breakfast, salads, pizzas and dinner entrees!!!"], ["William L.", "I can't believe that Iron Horse Tavern is the greatest, and the newest restaurant spot in this well-known R Street corridor! As I entered, the atmosphere is very remarkable and refreshing showing all the vintage wooden and bricks building parts that surrounds this place. The outdoor dining patio looks incredible, so you can see the view of R Street near Ace of Spades as well as other dining restaurants and bars nearby.The employees (from hosts to bartenders) have done a fantastic job! Very friendly and approachable! No problems at all!For the dining ordering process, I've ordered the Cubano sandwich which it has black, smoked ham with sweet peppers and jack cheese pressed in panini oven with fresh green salad topped with homemade dressing. So far, it tasted very good! I can feel the smoked ham flavor through my taste buds as well as the jack cheese and sweet peppers too! The greens salad with homemade dressing also tasted outstandingly good! I haven't ordered any alcoholic drinks, so I'll might be back for more next time.Parking can be an issue for some people. You can park at the surface street parking where it's available, or park at the mini lot. Otherwise, you can walk, ride a bike or using the transit to go there easier without the hassles.Overall, Iron Horse Tavern is the coolest restaurant/bar site where you can experience the guilty pleasures of a life time in the middle of the Downtown and Midtown neighborhood! Perfect for hanging out with friends, dining with your family, or simply going for a happy hour or brunch including after the Ace of Spades performances too! Highly recommend this new place!"], ["Allison G.", "Came here last Saturday with my family for a nice breakfast before my brother and sister in-law went to the Bay Area.

As good as any place in town. Try the truffle mac n' cheese and bruschetta trio for starters! I've come here for a drink and an appetizer before dinner, and the food is so good, I cancel my dinner reservation and eat here!*Could do better: Offer wine flights; make better use of the space in the back room, which is a wine storage area.OTHER INFO*Secret: There's a secret wine club room, that only members are allowed in. Probably also serves as a private party room. I've never been allowed in.*Last time, we sat near a tanned 50-something couple. The husband, sporting a gold watch and upscale vacation wear, was a little red in the face and it was clear that they had been through a bottle or two of wine. He was probably a big talker already, and on this occasion was turned to the side, trying to talk up a group of younger women. The mostly one-sided affair went on for some time, and I could tell that he was enjoying the conversation more than the women were, and MUCH more than his wife was.

The salsa that came with it was very good, but with only a tablespoon, it couldn't salvage the dry, bland taste of the fish. \u00a0The ribeye was a huge slab of meat (size of the plate), but didn't have much flavor and was barely touched by my friend. \u00a0Best part of the meal was the chocolate covered strawberries for dessert. \u00a0The bartender was super cool so this place could possibly be kept on the radar for drinks during 2nd Saturday?"], ["Catherine H.", "Simply FANTASTIC! \u00a0 Had the BEST dining experience here last evening - it was our first visit to Blue Prynt and it won't be the last. \u00a0Delicious assorted appetizers were all winners - tuna tartar, quail with polenta, beef skewers, and foie gras, and two rounds of signature drinks later..... \u00a0 We shared our four entrees of Pappadelle pasta with duck confit, chicken (so flavorful and juicy) served with the most delicious polenta (like none we have had before), perfectly grilled salmon, and rib-eye steak done to perfection. \u00a0All were simply delicious. \u00a0 Great service, we were treated like VIP's by Chef Spence, who showcased his talents in the kitchen. \u00a0His Napa Valley restaurant roots shine through in his dishes. \u00a0 We \"yummmed and ahhhed\" throughout the whole experience and left our plates clean... \u00a0it was a such memorable evening! \u00a0 Thank YOU, and we will be back again!"], ["Nielsen G.", "I went here for happy hours with some friends at about 6:30. \u00a0Happy hour ended at 7:30, but we enjoyed out time enough to stay for their 9 o'clock happy hour."], ["Leonard I.", "Random private parties. A bar that is closed is lame. Not much else to say that is useful. To make it a review I have to add more detail about how the bar doesn't actually serve people on random Saturday nights. You should call first cause they might be closed on a Saturday night."], ["Shelli B.", "Blue Prynt RestaurantWe recently joined the Dine 27 club in hopes of discovering wonderful places to eat in Sacramento. The Blue Prynt fit the bill. The bar was stocked, waiter, Giavonte (sorry if I butchered your name) awesome and food fantastic. My husband and I did not agree on the atmosphere. I loved it, he did not. The colors are cobalt blue and dark browns. I found it relaxing and inviting. There were tables and booths with soft comfortable seats and high back seats that provided some privacy. The bar was awesome with an amazing granite top and beautiful accents. It was odd to not have a reception desk at the front of the restaurant and I did stand around a bit awkwardly until the bartender finished 2-very beautiful froofy drinks to be greeted. \u00a0I sat at the bar and awaited my husband's arrival. I ordered a Bay Breeze in a tall glass. I received a beer glass which was fine but as cool as this place was, I thought I might be served in a fancy tall cocktail glass. The drink was awesome and perfectly mixed. It was so good I ordered another and would have ordered another if I did not have to drive. The drinks are reasonably priced and selection unlimited. The bartender was quite charming and very efficient at making, drinks, small talk and taking money.The time from seating to order and order to service was not short but no major complaints. We took the time to look at the artwork in the restaurant. \u00a0Our waiter was witty and very enjoyable and served us water with a hint of cucumber and lemon. Again, I liked, husband looked cross eyed at it. The food was amazing!!! I had the Trout and it was perfectly cooked with brussel sprouts. I really dislike brussel sprouts and only eat them because I know they are good for me. These brussel sprouts were actually good and I ate them all. Hubby's Chicken Cordon Bleu was totally beautiful and the accompanying vegetables were beautiful and really good. I would come to the restaurant just for those veggies. When the bill arrived, we were pleasantly surprised. I had not asked the price of the drinks in advanced and they were reasonable. We will definitely come back and wish the proprietor the best."], ["G K.", "Average is all this place going to be. From sub pare food (McDonald has more gourmet patties than this joint) to service. Staff appear bored and resentful of their job responsibilities. D\u00e9cor sad and washed out. Food bland. This was a one time deal for me. Would not be going back."], ["Bob R.", "This review is for the Happy Hour at the bar only. \u00a0This seems to be mostly what is happening here although the dinner menu looked OK. \u00a0Well drinks and house wine, and lots of yummy appetizer. \u00a0We stopped in for a drink before dinner and ended up just ordering appetizers, three for $10. \u00a0Everything was great and the service was very good."]], "Tapa the World": [["Raquel V.", "Service was mediocre, Tony never checked on us and forgot one tapa. \u00a0The tapas (scampi, empanadas, calamari, olives) with sangria outstanding were very good.

Actually never really ordered anything here that I wasn't satisfied with. \u00a0If you do happen to get here in time for happy hour get a pitcher of Sangria to compliment everything and let your day wind down. \u00a0I don't remember which nights they have it, or if its every night but they do have live music.Food is amazing here, drinks are on point, live music is a plus if you're into that if not just sit back and people watch. \u00a0I'd say bring a date a happy hour or bring the family for dinner.. Either way it hits the spot!"], ["Sabrina K.", "My boyfriend and I tried Tapa the World on a Friday night and we loved it. I was hesitant to take him there at first because he had never tried tapas and I didn't know how he would feel about the small portions. But we both loved everything. The patatas bravas are perfectly crispy and served piping hot. They were extremely close to the ones I had in Spain so I was very happy! We also tried the gambas and the potato chicken Parmesan empanadas which were to die for. He ended up beings satisfied and saved room for dessert. The live music is a very nice touch and the seating is intimate and romantic. Will definitely be back for another date night :)"], ["Kelli S.", "I wasn't floored by Tapa, but I wasn't turned off by it either. We ordered the paella, which takes 45 minutes, and some tasty pork. The paella was good, nothing extraordinary. We originally went because we wanted happy hour, only to be told that next door (the hookah joint) has happy hour and that they didn't have one."], ["Briana H.", "Okay... Soooooo perhaps I am missing something about this place. I came here with a friend on Saturday night and was not impressed. The food was not good, didn't taste fresh at all. Maybe we came in too late after everyone was served the fresh food but if a restaurant is going to advertise (open until midnight) I would hope and pray for food that's up to par. We ordered the mussels, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and calamari (way too tough). The mussels didn't taste fresh and were rubbery. I've never had bad calamari but this was bad. I can't even describe the taste. The remoulade sauce that it was served with was odd tasting too. \u00a0 The only descent item that I had here were the saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. Who can screw up mushrooms though?! The service was just okay!!! Again it was about an hour to closing so the server seemed like he wanted to get out of there which made us feel a little odd but honestly I was happy to get out of there.. (I'm happy we didn't sit on the patio too. All of that hooka from next door would've definitely ruined my dining experience) I told myself that I wasn't going to go back but I don't want to completely give up on this place. I would like to go at an earlier time to at least see if there's a difference."], ["Sara G.", "Try the sangria. Trust me.The bread bowl with olive oil is great. They give you a few different breads that are warm, I think freshly baked too. I ordered the dinner special which was chicken, mashed potatoes and asparagus. The thickest part of the chicken was dry but the rest was cooked just right. The sauce for the chicken was tasty, sweet but not too rich. It went well with the mashed potatoes too, which were outstanding. The asparagus was also cooked just right.My husband got a tapa which was so small. Granted, the waitress did warn us but after a couple of drinks we didn't really understand just how small the tapa was. It tasted phenomenal though. My meal was enough to feed two people so my husband didn't go hungry luckily.Our friends ordered burgers. One friend really liked the burger. It was cooked as he has specified and was juicy. Our other friend said the burger was good but he wasn't a fan of the goat cheese. Fair enough, not everyone likes that. The ambiance inside was lovely. There was a traditional spanish guitarist playing. He wasn't so loud that we couldn't hold conversations but he wasn't too quiet either. It was perfect for a Friday night dinner.Would recommend."], ["Tom T.", "Everything and I mean everything was tasty. The wine list is a rare demonstration of reasonableness. The owner told me about a wine made from a grape that was recently found after being dormant (Manturana) and he later brought over a glass. What a gem!"], ["Allie D.", "I've been coming to Tapa the World for several years now, and I feel like it may have fallen off a bit in recent years. They charge you for the bread basket now (whaaaa?), the sangria is just okay (have had better at Aioli and Blackbird), service is hit or miss, and sometimes their meat is just a bit overdone.BUT I keep coming back because I loooove going out for tapas and Aioli is pricey. The inside of the restaurant is cozy in the cooler months and the patio on J is great. Order the grilled veggie platter! I hear they have a good happy hour so I look forward to checking that out sometime."], ["Mary N.", "The tapas here were decent, I think I've just had a lot better in the bay area. \u00a0A little pricey for what you get.Sangria - More like punch. \u00a0Very weak and served in a small juice glass with lots of ice.Seafood Paella - The flavors were pretty good but there was almost too much seafood vs rice ratio. \u00a0It just makes the dish too busy, instead of focusing on good simple flavors. \u00a0I would have been happier with half the seafood and maybe be charged a bit less for the dish.Empanada - standard dish. \u00a0Not disappointing but not a standout either.Calamari - again, a standard dish. \u00a0Not very memorable. \u00a0Mussels - Probably the smallest mussels I've ever seen. \u00a0If they only have that size, they should probably take the item off the menu. \u00a0The flavor was decent but the small size of the mussels was quite disappointing."], ["Brooke D.", "Started with the Berenjenas, a plate of breaded eggplant, which I would have enjoyed more if it had more sauce. The food is pretty bland and overpriced for its lack of quality control. I'd give this place two stars if it weren't for the mussels --WHICH WERE OUT OF THIS WORLD--and patio (great for people watching). Service is slow, impersonal and doesn't have me wanting to return."], ["Tiffany D.", "I really like this place that it's open until midnight. There are some nights where you just eat a late dinner. I came her on a Thursday night, there was belly dancing on the alley way. It was very loud, and very busy, so service was on the slower side. It's very entertaining. We sat outdoor on the patio/sidewalk area which was refreshing compared to sitting inside, because it's an open kitchen, and someone was cooking seafood could be the seafood paella but the smell was not appealing to be sitting inside.Pros for it being open late, at least I know where I can get a healthy dinner other than just bar food. There was plenty of options from small plates to a full on meal. We started with calamari which needed to be crispier, it was a little too soggy, and I can taste the oil. That is not great! Then for the dinner itself, we did not order paella, because it took too long, and I was hungry, so I order the marcos pollo, basically, chicken & mashed potatoes. It was overall, pretty decent. The chicken breast was moist which is good, but the one thing I did not like was in between the layer of chicken & potatoes was baby spinach. The spinach was not cooked, it was just topped on there. I think they should've at least sauteed the spinach, because it really looks sloppy when it's just piled on."], ["Lyndsay B.", "Horribly rude service!!! We not only waited 20 minutes and asked for an item twice but when my husband asked about the specifics of the item we waited for the server replied with attitude and pretension implying that my husband was a moron for asking the question.When the bill came we were reviewing it and we made a mistake (I was with a group and we wanted to divide it evenly), while we were taking about our mishap our server overheard us from the table next to ours and very rudely interrupted us and scolded us for leaving the wrong amount.

We will NEVER come back!!!"], ["Meghan M.", "I really really like this place!Came here on a random Friday night looking to try something different.

It's right by the sidewalk, so people passing by could just reach over and grab a spoonful of your dinner if they wanted too-the bread served was cold, good but cold-the egg plant in the grilled vegetables was super mushy and unedible-There is a hooka place next door, so the smoke drifted over to our side (hooka smoke I don't mind so much but the cigarette smoke it blegh)-our table was super uneven so it rocked the entire time...that was just annoying~~~for some reason I can't upload my pic from my phone or I'd show you the wonderfullness of the food~~~"], ["Ann M.", "Fabulous authentic Spanish food! My boyfriend and I joined his folks there on a Wednesday in the evening. It was busy understandably because it's awesome! The Sangria is awesome as well as the 1$ bread basket with the olive and vineger mix. We shared a huge plate of pyaya. Chicken+shells+shrimp+chorizo=good times.

Came here after we'd been looking at local art galleries, but my mom has been coming for years. Friendly people, good location in mid-town. If the weather's nice, sit outside...inside is a bit dark. I've had the Green Mole with Chicken - amazingly good mole on boneless chicken thighs with a very tasty rice. My mom had the shrimp - delicious (ask for extra bread to soak up the garlic sauce), a salad plus the mushrooms. Everything was very tasty. We've also tried the mussels (so good) and a pasta dish.
