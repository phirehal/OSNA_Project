Even better. We have been here a few times so let me start with my favorite. The Tom Yum is to die for. It has that flavor that keeps you digging in and it's so fresh the flavor explodes on your tongue. The drunken noodles were fantastic. \u00a0We got beef for the kids and they ate the whole serving. \u00a0On our first trip we tried the pumpkin curry. I think it was telling that we finished everything else we've ever eaten here but barely touched the pumpkin curry. It had chunks of undercooked squash and just lacked in flavor. Our second trip we stuck with the Tom yum and drunken noodle but decided on the spicy red curry. It was definitely spicy. Not in a bad way but it was definitely something that warmed me up. I rolled my sleeves up pretty quickly after digging in. My only complaint this time was they left us by the door. Third trip more Tom yum and pineapple curry this time. Yummy way to get ready for the game."], ["Jaimee N.", "I want to give this place four stars, but there is something that stops me from doing so. The last three times I have been here the same thing has happened, and for that I cannot totally just let it go.Being in the industry, I pay attention to service. My pet peeve with this place is that they DO NOT come back to check on your refills. When I come here I get the Panang curry, and for me its spicy. I drink a lot of water. I drink all of my water. The last time I was there I actually had to get up and go over to the front where they keep the water and almost grab my own new cup before the server told me she would be right over. My word of advice is just to check on your tables a little more.Other than that I really like the place. I absolutely love the Panang curry and get it just about every time. I like that they serve lime with their Pad Thai. ; ) I also think the pricing is fine, especially with their lunch menu. The restrooms are very clean and the atmosphere is generally pretty nice. Except for when you are playing loud rap music on your break and it has cursing in it that the whole restaurant can hear. Kind of out of place for a Thai restaurant, but hey I understand. Do what you will with your own place. I don't really care, but I could see how other customers might not like it."], ["Rebecca C.", "I came here on a Friday night with my fianc\u00e9, super excited about having Thai food. After a minute or two we were not greeted and thought \"they need a minute\" so we grabbed menus and started perusing. After a few minutes of not being acknowledged we thought \"better sit down, this may take awhile.\" Presently, another couple walks in. They were immediately greeted and the waitress scanned the room for a table. My fianc\u00e9, seeing what was taking place, immediately stood up and said \"excuse me, we were here first.\" The lady glanced at him briefly, then looked back at the other couple and curtly stated \"there's a wait.\" The other gentleman replied \"how long?\" The lady replied curtly \"10-15 minutes\" and stalked off into the kitchen. Another five minutes crawled by and a single lady walks in. She was greeted immediately and seated in a booth. My fianc\u00e9 and I looked at each other silently asking, \"did that just happen?\" After another five minutes we were escorted abruptly to our table and made to endure the coldest service I've had in a long time. Our waitress (the same woman who ignored us and curtly greeted the couple behind us), avoided eye contact with us the entire time. It was very weird. Either she dislikes couples or was having a bad night. Either way it was incredibly unprofessional. Did the food make up for the scorn? No. The Pad Thai was rubbery, tasted slightly stale, and had very little egg, and no peanuts. The Pumpkin curry on the other hand was delicious--which is why there are 3 stars remaining."], ["Sue V.", "Still a fan! We grabbed lunch here after the baby sister's graduation ceremony.

My dad spilled his water everywhere, and even though it was busy, they brought us napkins before we even asked.The dishes are consistently good. I got the pineapple fried rice which still wowed me. The sriracha fried rice is better if you have a spicy tooth instead. I don't, but I still liked it and it wasn't too hot. The yellow curry is well seasoned and creamy. I recommend it with chicken. We also got Pad Thai, which tasted delicious. I do like my noodles a little more al dente, but that's another cuisine and no one else complained.Good to know:The one disappointment was the tilapia dish. We assumed it was a whole fish, but instead it was a stir fry. Oh well, that's why it was only $12.95.Would I recommend?Yes, I always do to anyone in the area looking for a place to eat."], ["Wendy C.", "The service was quick and the staffs were nice. I would recommend this place because the food is really good! The chicken wings are the best and so is the pineapple fried rice."], ["Garvy S.", "Good food! The staff is very attentive and very patient despite my boyfriend's demanding mother. My favorite dish is the spicy beef salad. It didn't come out spicy to me, but I added more crush red peppers to my liking. I think its best to do that so everyone can adjust to the level of spiciness how they want it. Food came out super fast! I wasn't able to get the other food pictures like the drunken noodles because everyone was digging into. Everything i ate i enjoyed.

I have been eating left overs all week (which I'm not complaining.)I have to knock down a few stars though for the service. They are nice, but forgot our soda, I had to walk up to get the check (I think they forgot about us) and then had to go up again for boxes.

Actually I was anticipating a small cup of soup, in which then I was going to order the drunken noodles because of the other positive reviews I read about them. Instead, she brought out a behemoth of a bowl of soup. It was the Sukiyaki soup and the flavor was fantastic with a some heat which I liked. (Not too hot though, and I'm a medium to mild kind of heat guy)Having a bit more time to kill here in Sacramento, I decided to order a desert.

Veggies are crisp and all veggies are accounted for in each dish. Example- larb, some people skip the garnish cucumbers, or lemon grass, or even mint, NOPE not this place! It's got everything, veggies I can't even name. and if veggies aren't your thing? Well how about the condiments, I want to believe they make their own chili oil, cuz, BAM! It'll hit you like they roasted the pepper under your nose. Table side fish sauce, crush pepper, even roasted ground rice. And my last real jump of joy?

I saw some other things like the fried chicken caught my eye I'm coming back. \u00a0I'm a Kapoon freak and Google everywhere in Sacramento I can get it this is by far one of the best among 1 other spot I love.

Meatballs (Boiled): \u00a0I'm totally a fan of meatball, just in general. \u00a0However, I never really understood why meatball was so special, because you can always get it from the supermarket frozen for your Pho. \u00a0I was told the meatballs were homemade, that's why they're special. \u00a0So I apologize for being so ignorant about it, but the meatballs were still delicious and definitely the way to go for a small appetizer. Overall the portions were huge! \u00a0The pricing wasn't bad either. \u00a0Pretty typical, but you are able to share. \u00a0However, the rice portion they give you for $3 kind of bums me out, but rice isn't that good for you anyways right? \u00a0No...

Something about the flavor was lacking. Maybe it was the use or pepper flakes rather than the real Thai chili pepper that I am use to. In addition, there were these mini dried shrimps that were added. I like those little shrimps just not it papaya. Or maybe I have grown fond of papaya salad made at another unnamed location. The Ka-Poon was a little on the salty side. I did however like that it was not oily.The Partner wasn't too find of the seafood Pad Thai. I didn't try it with the exception of a piece of fried tofu which I found too chewy. The partner said it was lacking flavor. The Lao sausage was pretty good.

I'm not sure if that's still the case, but if so, I have been wanting to try Bangkok@12 and compare them since Thai Chili is usually my go-to Thai restaurant. I ended up here with a friend for dinner after a nearby Thai restaurant was unexpectedly closed for the day. We were looking forward to unlimited Thai tea refills, which Bangkok@12 does not have. However, their cups were so large here that I could barely finish one. Upon entering I noticed about half the restaurant was filled, which seems average for a Tuesday night. However, service was slow on all aspects. It appeared there was only one server doing everything, from delivering drinks to taking orders. I spotted another girl but it looked like she wasn't doing too much up front. As a server myself, I automatically felt that lone server's stress and eased up on my critique of service. I wasn't too hungry so I went with the spring roll appetizer, which I've been craving for a while. They were delicious and fresh, although I didn't like the touch of mint. The peanut dipping sauce was one of the best I've had. I was able to taste my friend's panang curry, which was delicious! It was as good as the curry at Thai Chili. Normally I would give three stars for a place that was A-OK but wouldn't return to immediately. Their food was comparable to Thai Chili. However, I would come back only if I was in the area.

I was always a fan of their Bangkok Fried Rice (the curry and sausage are what put it over the top for me), and have yet to try their Crab Fried Rice (Boon Boon Thai's is still my fave in that category) but that'll have to wait until red tide is over. Their veggie pad thai is also one of my go-to dishes during Lenten season, and their seasonal curries are good too (pumpkin, mango)! We had reservations and were seated in the back near the aquarium.

There was a little mixup with the last order (brought an eggplant dish with meat to our table by mistake) but it was quickly remedied without having to make a whole new dish, was just a plate brought to the wrong table, the veggie dish was done just not delivered properly. $10-$15 for each dinner entree depending on if you got a house/chef specialty or what. There were some newish items that caught my eye, like the curry pad thai. The entire back page of the menu is devoted to thanking Yelpers which was cute.

They are a great crew and have excellent customer service! They are friendly, tell you what's good, and make you feel comfortable!!!! The food is hands down excellent!! Authentic, flavorful and a lot of selection on the menu!Our favorites: crispy chicken is awesome with white rice! The chicken is tender, juicy, and crispy!!! Yummy!! The garlic prawns is to die for.... Fresh prawns with the shell on with an amazing garlic sauce!! The prawns are so good you can eat the shell..... And the flavor is so garlicky it will stick with you for at least a day and a half!!We also like the spicy cat fish dish with mushrooms, bell peppers, and basil!

The soft shell crab is excellent, the garlic fried rice is wonderful, and the mango sticky rice for dessert is great!!It's a must try!!!"], ["Rei H.", "My friend took me here a week ago and everything was delicious!

It was fine. There just...wasn't anything particularly great about it, either. Take the tom yum soup, which we ordered with seafood. It certainly looked great when it arrived, with generous amounts of shrimp, calamari, and scallops. But the flavor was a big disappointment, totally lacking the sharp, pungent, spicy kick that defines a good tom yum. It was just a mild, vaguely tart broth with seafood, tomatoes, mushrooms, and onions. It didn't taste bad, but as tom yum goes, it was uninspired.We also tried the basil beef and the green curry with chicken. The basil beef was OK--heavy on the ground beef, with just a few token bell peppers tossed in--but the basil was more noticeable to the eye than to the palate, and I felt the beef was a bit saltier than it needed to be. The green curry was better, and it was also the most significant source of vegetables, with more zucchini and bamboo shoots than chicken. But although it was my favorite dish of the evening, it was far from what I'd call a great green curry.The service was very good. My water glass was never less than half full, and the food arrived quickly after we ordered. As a side note, none of these dishes was even remotely spicy. I probably should have specified when ordering that I do like spicy food--since I didn't do that, I'm not taking off any stars for lack of heat."], ["Crystal R.", "First time here.

I was really hoping he would do something to correct it, offer a gift cert for the same amount, or something. He had record of my credit card transaction. Once he pulled up a record of what I ordered he just said, \"oh, it doesn't look like the person that took your order wrote down that you wanted anything spicy.\"Well I was bummed that I paid for such crappy food, but even more disappointed that the manager did make any effort to resolve things.

I would highly suggest coming here if you are in the area."], ["Liz S.", "Well, clearly I like Thai food because I come back so often and rewrite this review. Last night, we walked in for an early dinner, and we were the only people in the restaurant. We were tired, hungry, and thirsty! The woman gave us two menus and walked away. Did not ask if we wanted a drink or get us water. Nothing. Ten minutes went by (hubby says less, but it seemed like forever, and did I mention we were the only people there?), and a take-out customer walked in. I could see that they were going to help the take-out customer before giving us a drink.So we walked out. Went next door to Taste of Thai, not for the first time. Chada is uneven. It's a family run business and I think maybe some days the family is not functional! Last time I tried to go here, they were closed for a week for a family vacation. I'm not going to say I won't come back, because sometimes it's awesome, and I get that nobody's perfect. I just wish I could count on it being awesome all the time. And I think the service here is just relaxed, for good and bad.Chada's drinks are cheaper than Taste of Thai, if you can wait sometimes."], ["Josh L.", "After going back and fourth between the two thai restaurants (chada thai and taste of thai) I gave in the reviews and went to chada thai. I'm not sure how the other one is but I definitely made the right choice!! I love the simple and elegant decors of the restaurant. The waiters were so nice and helpful with recommendations. I ordered the eggplant dish with beef and drunken noodles with shrimp. The food came out super fresh and quick too!! The flavors of the vegetables and spices complimented each other. I would definitely recommend this place and I'll be coming back!Ps - I just made an account after eating here. They deserve more recognition!"], ["Danita N.", "One of my go-to spots between mid-town and Land Park. I usually get take-out, but my experience eating in the restaurant has always been good, too! There are lots of Thai options around town - including one right next door(!) - but I always come back to Chada Thai. The service is great. The staff is super friendly. And it seems like it's a family run spot, which makes me like it even more! I especially like that they are willing to vary the spice of dishes. I like mine on the spicy side, and they are always very accommodating of my requests to pump up the heat level!"], ["Trisha D.", "Absolutely love this place! They never disappoint and the service is always very quick and efficient."], ["Emily N.", "My husband and I are pretty picky about our Thai food and this place definitely fulfills all of our expectations. The waiter/waitresses are always friendly and I believe all the cooking is done by a mom in the back. I really appreciate how the always bring out the food hot. We usually order pad see ew and it always comes out perfect. Thank you!"], ["Doug G.", "First visit was very good!Tom Yum w/chicken was 5starsGreen curry chicken. 4 star2nd visit:Tom yum w/chicken greatAvocado Curry good3rdTom Yum -good chicken nice balanced flavor.

The lunch special is a great deal and comes with delicious coconut soup!"], ["Lisa D.", "Chada Thai was amazing. Their service was fast and the food tasted great. We had the pumpkin curry special and the Chada Fried Rice (which includes pineapples, cashew nuts, and raisins) and both had such great and balanced flavor. I am excited to return."], ["Nando V.", "I was on broadway craving indian food so i yelped near by spots and this spot caught my attention i saw it had curry so i was like, screw it lets go there im starving. When we got there, there was 2 thai spots next to each other so i went to the one with more stars. The place looked nice inside the service was friendly, not as attentive as i would like but friendly enough to help with the menu since it was my first time there.The waitress helped out gave me her input on dishes to pick some stuff i picked like the curry some she suggested like thick noodles with shrimp.The food came out it was nice and hot but the food was missing something. I looked for my waitress but i couldnt find her my food was missing SOY SAUCE!!!We were almost full , the couple across from us got there food and their waiter had brought them a tray with soy sauce, fish sauce, garlic hot sauce etc. i was like why didnt we get that? I finally got a glimpse if my waitress i flagged her down and asked for that tray i was kinda up set that we didnt get that from the start thats where im deducting a star and deducting another one because the food was bland with out soy sauce. Once i put the sodium on the food then it was great but yea that sucked with out it. I would go again but next time i will ask for the sauce tray. Seems like the whole review im bitching bout a sauce tray, smh.Curry was great the spicy rice was good pretty spicy but i knew what i was getting my self into the thick noodle was also good the beef dish was my least favorite the beef was tough and dry other than that it was good and like the terminator, I'LL BE BACK!"], ["Cynthia M.", "The food here is great, but what stood out to me the most was the exceptional service. I had the pleasure of being served by Brady my first time here. He was very friendly, accommodating and recommended to me the red curry. If authentic and fresh Thai cuisine is what you're looking for, this is the place to go. The ingredients tasted fresh unlike most Thai restaurants that load up their dishes with artificial add ons or flavors enhancers. All in all, I would definitely come back for the great atmosphere, food, and experience."], ["Tiffany S.", "First time coming here and it's pretty good! I had their red curry, papaya salad, crab cake, and pad thai. Everything I had was really good! I would consider coming back here again when craving for Thai food."], ["Maya B.", "My family lives about two blocks away from the restaurant in Land Park and it is by far some of the best thai food I have had! The pad thai is excellent and the curries are really good (although taste pretty standard for most thai restaurants). The thai iced tea is also good and not too overpriced. Overall I would definitely recommend this place to any thai food enthusiast!"], ["Anne C.", "Great food, service and staff. Best yellow curry in town. Ask for the avocado green curry! It is delicious too."], ["David G.", "The best Thai in town plus super friendly staff!"], ["Elisa R.", "We prefer coming to this Thai restaurant because of its authenticity. \u00a0I've tried just about all their curry's and love each of them. In the winter we enjoy the Pumpkin Curry and during the warm months the Mango Tofu is delightful. \u00a0From the Pad Thai to the sauteed veggie dishes...never A disappointment. I've tired each of their specials written when you walk in at least once. Give this busy Broadway street restaurant a visit.... you won't be disappointed."], ["Dani P.", "My boyfriend and I come here at least once a week now that we live off of W St. They're always so friendly and welcoming and of course they have quick service. The food is amazing! We always get the vegetable red curry with no tofu as we are vegans who don't eat soy! They are always so accommodating and easy going! Best thai food I have ever had, and I'm a tough critic so that is saying a lot! If you're in search for an amazing and authentic thai food place look no further!"], ["Tracy T.", "This place is located in town where theres not much parking. The restaurant seem emptied but the food was great! Had the eggplant dish with rice and flat/wide noodles. They were super delicious! Customer service was great & our waters were always refilled! Definitely going again!"], ["Cindy S.", "Loved the chicken green curry and fried rice thai style i believe and the thai iced tea. very chill atmosphere. the service not so much as service but really? had to ask a waiter about three times to re fill our waters i would have just thought they'd come back around but nope. disappointed in the service but overall food was great. wouldn't come back tho. better to go to taste of thai or thai spice much better."], ["John W.", "I came here again because i loved it so much the first time. Oh em gee you have to try the avocado curry and mango curry!! Goes great over rice! My girlfriend had the mango and i the avocado. The curries were so creamy and delicious! You can definitely taste the coconut milk as well and it compliments the fruits so well. I thought it was odd at first -fruits in curry? But they go so well in their curry! Its like little bites of heaven when you get a combination of vegies with avocado and some rice.. Mmmmmm..!!"]], "Thai Canteen": [], "The Coconut Midtown": []}
