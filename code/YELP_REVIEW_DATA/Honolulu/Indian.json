I want to add that there is nothing ghetto nor poor about me or my appearance. I carry myself with class and and I am never offensive nor abrasive. I introduced my friend to the man who showed the apartment, and I mentioned that my friend came with me for support. He jokingly said \"and she probably came with the checkbook\".

The truth is that I make VERY good money, I work very hard, I pay all of my bills, I go to school and pay my OWN way through it, and I do not deserve to be belittled. Moving to Hawaii was a decision that had a great deal to do with comments like this from white people that I had to suffer almost every day of my life on the mainland. I am TIRED and EXHAUSTED of being treated as if I am broke, ghetto, poor, a lesser human being, or not worth being considered because of my skin complexion. I LEFT the mainland, so that I did not have to suffer that here! I am utterly offended because he had no right to disrespect me!On top of that, I voiced my concerns to the manager via email, and I have never even received a response back from them. Please do NOT let this company prosper with your money. Racism should have been abolished along with slavery a long time ago!! It is appalling that there are companies that still treat people like this. I am shocked, offended and exhausted of this treatment. I've suffered enough racism on the mainland. I refuse to suffer through it here. This is supposed to be a land of Aloha. I work hard here,m and I give back by doing a whole lot of volunteer work for the less fortunate and for the animals here. I do NOT deserve this!!Since I received no response, I forwarded my complaint to the Better Business Bureau, who in turn told me that this is a federal offense and that I can actually sue! I am going to go through the process of suing and at least I will feel confident that I made some type of difference by at least taking action!!!NO ONE should suffer racism.

Yeah, I'm a haole, so people are probably like \"ohhh you don't understand Indian food. blah blah blah\" but you know, I spent two weeks in South India, I teach in a school district in PA that has a huge Indian population, my students' moms send in food with their children to give to me because they know I'm addicted to Indian food, AND I spend a lot of time looking up recipes from Kerala and trying to recreate them in my home--so I needless to say I have some foundational knowledge. \u00a0Third: I was reading some reviews where people were saying \"oh I heard the chef talk about adding tomato paste\" or \"they don't seem to use fresh spices.\" --folks, folks...let's be serious here IT'S A PLATE LUNCH PLACE. It was not meant to be 5 star dining xD So given all these pieces of information, I think that India Cafe is pretty swag for quick, cheap S. Indian food. Now, on to the important part--what I ate from India Cafe. 1. Spicy eggplant. I ate this in a house with no a/c, during the hottest part of the day with almost zero trade winds. I'm good with spice, I really am--but it was the perfect storm of scary spice levels and super hot weather. I may have almost died--but it was worth it because the eggplant was soooo good. On an island where people think tabasco is super spicy. . . this was refreshing (kind of like the two bottles of water I consumed after eating it). \u00a0I'd eat this again. . . as long as I had a/c ;) 2. Channa Masala: This is pretty much why I am giving this place a 4 instead of a 5--too much salt :( \u00a0It was really overpowering to the rest of the flavors in this dish and that disappointed me a little. 3. Vegetable Sambar--So this must be a Tamilian dish (at least I think it is) because it's not like the sambar I ate in Kerala and. . . after going on India Cafe's website, I noticed they had a thing about Tamil new year, so I'm just going to assume (I also looked up recipes for Tamilian style sambar soooo...:P). It was pretty nice. I enjoyed eating it to wash down the eggplant and channa. \u00a0I just really, really like sambar though. Take me back to the days of eating sambar and idli (or vada, I prefer vada) for breakfast and I'll be happy.Next time. . . I'm going for the masala dosai :)To finish this off. . . I am going to confess one thing: I am incredibly partial to S. Indian food. I like it more than N. Indian food and so . . . the fact that India Cafe sells a lot of S. Indian inspired stuff, it just gets brownie points in my book. Not to mention it's plate lunch style---so it's quick and easy. If you are just looking for quick, tasty, spicy, S. Indian food, India Cafe is a great place to go for lunch :)."], ["Andrea H.", "I was disappointed with the food. The samosas were too heavy on the filo and grease with very little filling.

My favorite was the traditional lamb curry because of how tender the lamb was and the curry sauce was amazing. I also enjoyed the naan basket which came with plain (salt), garlic and onion naan.

They have several diary free options which was great since my mom is very sensitive to cream. \u00a0The staff was welcoming and friendly and came around constantly to refill our waters.

We ordered another side of naan, and had to wait about 10-15 mins because the waitress forgot our order... We sat there waiting for our food longer than we took to actually eat our food. Food portions are tiny! $20 for a small pint sized bowl of curry & $8 for 4 pieces of naan. However, the only upside of the night was how the food tasted. The chefs special curry and cheese naan was really really good. In all, I would not come back here.

The Samosa's had a nice tamarind sauce and a mint/cilantro puree which was pretty good. The only problem was that one of the two samosas were really oily (on the inside). The lamb biryani was alright, but I didn't care for the yogurt-like sauce. However I LOVED mixing my biryani rice with the coconut curry!! The coconut curry itself is small, but its rich and very filling. And for the monsoon kabab...what's not to like? A little bit of everything; chicken, prawns, and lamb (the lamb was my favorite maybe I'll get a kabab with just lamb next time). What I didn't like was that you have to pay for rice or naan bread. Luckily we had a rice dish (the biryani). But we did order the plain naan. Unfortunately I didn't like it. There were 4 pieces and it was very oily to touch and was soggy/flimsy...Service was pretty good considering there was only one server for the longest time! They had one lady taking orders, serving, and filling up \u00a0water! Poor lady...but she did an amazing job. The meal was pretty pricey but I guess it's around the average price other Indian restaurants charge. Luckily I had a groupon coupon! I wouldn't mind eating here again!

She doesn't even apologize she simply says \"what would you like\" FINALY !!! We order & ask if we could have water please. She says she'll be right back with our waters. Another 15 mins go by & no water. We weren't upset of not having water. We were upset at the timing & the fact the we were watching her talk to a coworker at the register. We give her another 5 mins.

Also, the cups they give you is this cool looking gold goblet that makes you feel like royalty while drinking cheap beer from it. hahahaAMBIANCE: It's rather a small restaurant but with beautiful decor. It's a good place for a small group (3-5) because of the size. Or else you'll probably have to wait awhile for a larger table. Good place to bring a date! SERVICE: Well, they won't entertain you, but they fill your cup with water constantly & bring your food out quickly! Perfectly fine by me! I suck at small talk anyways. PARKING: Small lot behind the restaurant, usually full. There's a Long's across the street so you can park there for free. They don't take reservations and the weekends are busy as heck, so try to avoid the busy hours. I came here on a Wednesday dinner time and we only waited 5 minutes 'til we were seated.

My favorite dishes at Maharani's are the chicken tika masala, the eggplant tikka korma, and the lamb vindaloo. I try pickle do not like lamb because it is so gamey, but they do it right here. It's really soft and yummy. Their chicken tikka masala is really tasty as well, it can be sweeter from time to time (which I love), and other times, it's been more savory. In terms of the eggplant, this one is a surprisingly good one. I didn't think I would like it as much as I do. It's sweet, crispy, and the sauce is so good. The naan at Maharani's is also really good. We always order the garlic naan and rice to accompany out dishes. It's always crispy around the edges and soft enough in the middle to scoop up your food. The staff here is sweet, the decor is colorful and bright, just as if imagine India to be. I also love their dishes. They have really nice dishes, which are a detail often overlooked by some places.

Being on Brick Lane all the way in East London is something else. It's not everyday where you get an Indian man standing in front of his family's restaurant asking you to marry him... Not Cafe Maharani is NOTHING like that. lolLet me break it down:Parking: Not really. It's a small lot but difficult to navigate. Best bet is to park on the street.Exterior: Unless you're really looking you'll find it, I'm sure. If not, you could miss it 100% It's a really small restaurant.Interior: I have a weakness and it's Bollywood movies. Not only do they have one small tv setup near the register and the kitchen playing nonstop Bollywood movies of attractive god like indian men body rolling but you can make yourself feel like you're in one. Sure it gets hot, but it's probably from all the spices you're eating (or how you feel about watching bollywood movies that just get your temperature up) but it's really hot in there. LOL It's also VERY tight. Although it's definitely doable, don't expect to have much movement when you're with a big party.Service: Like everywhere else, make friends, I've friended a few of the waiters because hey, I've seen them around the UHM campus and I'm just an outgoing person. What's the golden rule? ... exactly!Food: Don't worry if you don't like things spicy, they have something for everyone, even the uber vegetarians.

Whenever we get together, there's always deliberation on where we'd like to munch. And thankfully, my hubby Ikaika O. is not too fond of ethnic dishes like Vietnamese, Thai, Indian, Ethiopian, etc., so it makes a great dinner date excuse with the ladies. It was Monday, and we were walking to a Peruvian restaurant that so happened to be closed on...you guessed it, Mondays. Heads turned left, then right. After a few mutters and restaurant names being thrown out, we started looking toward eateries by Down to Earth. As I regurgitated all the foodies in that area, I quipped, \"You know, I've never eaten at Maharani.\"It was as if I said the Earth is SQUARE.\"WHAAATT???\" replied Denby. \"You've NEVER eaten at CM??\"As I fumbled for reasons why I could be so negligent like \"well, you know, the wait is always so long, and the parking, gosh...\"...Iris added, \"I've never tried that place either!\"Oh, it was on.We beelined it there and Denby had the higher intelligence to make a mad-dash call (using our beloved Yelp app, of course) to see what the wait time was. It was easily close to 6pm at prime dinner hour. BUT! As luck shined in our favor, the owner said that there was ONE table open and NO waitlist if we could get there soon. SHYAAA!!Empty tummies barreling to CM could be seen from space at the rate we were going. And there it was...a big four-top table--empty and waiting to support our derrieres.I was in awe at the decoration. From the outside, everything looks so modest and unassuming. Inside, the chairs look like they would seat a Maharaja. The mirrors are bejeweled with rubies. And the cups added to its authenticity! I felt like I was at a Disneyland attraction in an antiquated version of the Mumbai Tower of Terror. I have heard how good the food is. I have seen the leftovers my coworker would bring home. And NOTHING could prepare me for how delicious everything actually was!We ordered three 4-combination plates and a side of Raita (fresh yogurt) to temper the heat. You are only allowed to order certain meats and veggies with the combination plate. So we strategized on which veggie and meat dishes we each wanted to try, and did a switcheroo when the plates arrived. We decided on:1. Chicken Masala Curry- Like Yellow curry is to Thai, this was a staple dish. Popular and savory with huge chunks of chicken, moderately spiced.2. Chicken Makhni (Butter Chicken)-Don't let the name fool you. The flavors are more of a tomato base and rounds out a smoother, milder acidity with the butter. Easy to eat and minimal spice.3. Lamb Saag- Creamy spinach and cubed lamb makes this a House Specialty.4. Vegetable Jalfrezi Masala- Another House Specialty, and a delightful combination of all different veggies with moderate spice.5. Dal Sambar- Lentil and veggies cooked in cream had remarkable taste (careful with the chilis!)6. Vegetable Korma- Hearty chunks of stewed veggies...let's not forget the cardamom!7. Palak Paneer- CHEF'S SPECIALTY of homemade cheese and creamy spinach. Tasty, however not on the top of my priority list.Everything, and I mean every last morsel was well rounded with exceptional flavor, including the buttery soft naan bread (ohhhh...).

Of those, Cafe Maharani is probably the best option if that is what you are looking for. Located on King st near University, Maharani is a small restaurant with somewhat limited seating. I'm a fan of Indian food and once in a while I definitely crave a good lamb dish with some garlic paratha. Tonight we got some takeout (which I recommend considering how crowded this place gets) consisting of Chicken Malai Korma, Lamb Vindalo, Eggplant Tikka Masala, Garlic Naan and Garlic Paratha. The eggplant dish is one of our regular favorites and was enjoyed by everyone. We ordered the lamb to be 8/10 spicy and it turned out fairly well. The chicken dish was average and not that well received. We all wished that instead of one naan and one paratha we had instead ordered two (or three) parathas. It was just that good.Overall, Maharani is probably the best Indian food on the island, although that's not really saying much since it doesn't have much decent competition.

After reading the reviews my boyfriend and I decided it was best to come early to avoid a long wait time on a Saturday evening. We were able to be seated right away upon our arrival about 20min after they opened. As previously mentioned in other reviews here, the space is very limited and crowded. That didn't bother us at all but what was irritating was our seats. If you lean back, there are jagged plastic edges on the chair back design that poked through our shirts. Even then, we tried not to be bothered with it and just sat forward all dinner. Our waitress was quick and friendly so no complaints there, but our food was not very delicious. Actually, the food didn't taste bad either. What's worse was that the food was completely bland. It needed a bit of spice or some salt or anything really but there was no flavor. They overcooked the lamb to the point that I thought it was beef and the chicken masala curry had absolutely no taste except for a hint of tomato. We should have known when we received our food because there wasn't an aroma coming from any of our dishes or our neighboring tables' dishes. Even the mango lassi I had was bland and fairly gritty. I am so disappointed. In addition to our chicken masala curry and vindaloo curry, we ordered the garlic topped naan and the cheese stuffed naan. Either the kitchen or a runner forgot our order so had it not been for us asking the status on the naan after 40min since taking our order, we would have never received it. Actually, we never received the garlic naan but we didn't want to ask our waitress again because we just wanted the check already. The cheese naan was good, we'll give them that, but that's pretty hard to mess up cheese with naan. When we got our check they charged us for our entrees, drinks, and the two naan. Since we only received one of the two naan, we just added that to the tip we left in addition to the cash amount to round the tip off at 20%. Like I said, our waitress was nice but the others seemed a bit aloof. Oh well we got lucky with ours. Long story short, we were very let down with our experience. We would always drive past and see the long lines so we were very eager to love this place.

I even heard whispers of \"it would have been worth the wait\" yesssss!Fortunately there have been people around me who are willing to wait it out with me when take-out isn't an option...so I have gotten to eat at CM relatively often. But as Tracy K. mentioned....when we had our tastebud adventure GDO, she and our BFF Iris K. admitted to being CM virgins I was shocked! Then totally happy that there was a table ready for us when we got there. we ordered the combo plates...passed around the Naan and small dishes of the sampler plates. The company was happiness for my soul, the food was happiness for my stomach. The servings are deceivingly LARGE. I have not walked away hungry from here! Wish the wait wasn't so long and the table got turned over faster so us CM fan-atics can get seated quicker....but patience is a virtue and I can be good at waiting.Learn from the wise Emi H....DO TAKE-OUT....trust her.

The eggplant was hella spicy and we ended up not finishing it. Not sure if that is normal but if you like spice that may be your dish. The butter chicken was good and made with nice pieces of chicken thighs. I'm not a huge okra fan but I actually enjoy their okra dish. The roti bread is served warm and buttery.

Those we knew were gone, or almost gone, working a single shift a week. The good became worse and worse until we just stopped considering curry as a stop.

They have rotating specials everyday from Butter Chicken (Tikka Masala) curry to Chickpea curry, and even Okra curry. You can even add some tasty roti flat bread, which is a MUST for mopping up leftover curry. There are mini (1 choice) or regular plate (2 choices) options and prices range from about $8-12. From what I've gotten, chicken is really tender and I'm a fan of all the veggie curries...their spicy is INDIAN spicy, but their milds are more my temperature...especially if I have to walk back to my compound in the hot sun. I just have issues with the richness of the flavors...they could definitely be more robust and...INDIAN, ya know?

Naturally with my love for all things Indian, India Cafe Express and its array of pre-made curries tickling my aromatic senses into wanting more.The menu tacked on the outside of the kiosk is pretty simple. There are daily specials which range from vegetarian to meaty options. Most of it is northern Indian inspired, along with a nod to some of the local dishes (oh hai, coconut shrimp). While most Indian food court spots will automatically serve naan as a bread accompaniment, it should be noted that this joint also serves roti as well.If one should choose the veggie + meat combo, I think there is no better combination than the chicken curry and bindi masala. Chicken curry is as staple as it gets, but this version from I.C.E. offers some real kick and a sauce that isn't too overbearing. The chicken is chunky and on the bone, which is a plus flavor wise. Bindi masala is the veggie dish all health nuts can appreciate, but the spicy creaminess of the masala combined with the fresh eggplant is very decent.I can't sing the praises of their navratan korma, which was a bit too chunky for my tastes and a tad on the bland side. Chicken tikka masala is a little sweet and their seafood selections (fish curry, squid, etc.) are always a toss up between subpar and sublime. For a city as expensive as Honolulu can be, a $10 lunch plate here is not the worst thing in the world, especially when the cuisine is Indian.The guys behind the counter are nice, which enough warrants the multiple returns.

It was good but for the $8 more we eat at Himalayan Kitchen and get nice ambiance, variety in the menu, a smile, and sorry to say better food...I hate to write negative reviews but I was disappointed and put of by the lack of friendliness and feel $22 bucks for lunch I should at least get either ambiance, good service, or great food.
