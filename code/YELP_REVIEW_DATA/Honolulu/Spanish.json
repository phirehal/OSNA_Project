I also ordered a side of beans and rice ($2.50).After opening up the foil that wrapped up the tacos, the memories of L.A. were rekindled. \u00a0These were the simple grilled silver dollar tortillas with meat, chopped onions and cilantro that seemed so elusive here. \u00a0This looked like a real taco. \u00a0Then I bit into the carne asada taco, and it tasted like a real taco. \u00a0The carne asada was still not exactly the skirt steak meat found in California, but it was the closest I've found here as it was flavorful. The tasty carnitas filled up the other two tortillas nicely, whereas the carne taco had a little less volume. \u00a0The green and red salsas were solid. \u00a0Now I'd rather have black beans than the brown beans he provides along with the golden fluffy Spanish rice. \u00a0I like red Spanish Rice, and to that end I like Serge's kine. \u00a0They do not serve tortilla chips either. but that's not a big deal at all. \u00a0I also hope he'll have a jalape\u00f1o bar (with pickled carrots, radish, onions, etc.) one day, but I shouldn't get greedy especially with the price of produce here. \u00a0I'll just be happy if a good small food establishment survives in Hawaii (so hard to do). \u00a0So for now it's all about the tacos, which it should be. \u00a0While they are $1-2 more than it would be in L.A., that's the going rate here, and it is completely worth it. \u00a0Alejandro's is only open Thurs-Sat. from 12-8pm so you have to hustle and plan to get yours. \u00a0He has a taco cart where he serves up his tacos as pupus at Waikiki bars on the other days. \u00a0Bookmark this place, and plan on going to get your taco fix on. \u00a0No complain -- this is the real deal. \u00a0I give it 4.5 stars. \u00a0Free parking, cash only, and no liquor license (drink your Pacifico or Corona somewhere else later)."], ["Ninarae N.", "FINALLY.Alleluia!

My bf got the beef burrito ($7.50) with sour cream ($.50) and cheese ($.50), with a side order of rice and beans ($2.50).Everything was fresh and delicious. My bf literally inhaled his burrito. While I devoured mines with their homemade spicy salsa and I squeezed my own limes it was very piggy tasting which, I love.

Well now you've found it! Alejandro's mexican has that amazing authenticity to it that you just can't find many places. I'm talking about the flavor and juiciness of the carnitas... I'm talking about the spices he uses on his carne asada. Brah you need to come here and order 1 burrito to eat there and then get 1 to go for later. The place is clean which I really appreciate. Condiment wise, he is prepared with tapatio (thumbs up to that my friends) and limes (the holy grail of taco condiments). There is enough seating with respect to his location, and it's just as easy to get take out. He only takes cash so come prepared. Lets talk about the owner himself. You've never been to a place like this. Alejandro is literally cooking right over there behind the counter and talking to you like you're old pals. Ask him about his story, ask him about his food, ask him how else you can get more of his tacos. The guy is outspoken and funny. This is not just an eating establishment, it's like a homie hangout with your new friends. What an experience. Yes this place is out of the way and probably not the most convenient location. But guess what, it's worth it. It's worth that extra $5.00 of gasoline in your hummer to drive up here with all your friends just to eat this food.

It was quite tasty! I doused it with the homemade salsa verde and Tapatio on the counter which made it even better. I was a little disappointed with the size, but beggars can't be choosy right? I also had a side of rice and beans and wasn't \u00a0impressed, sorry Alejandro! I consider myself a bean connoisseur and prefer pinto beans that are more than just boiled. And the rice, meh. I would just skip the sides. The hubby ordered 3 carnitas tacos and inhaled them. I didn't even get a chance to see what they looked like. He then looked at me and said gimme a bite of your burrito. Of course, if your husband is anything like mine, \"a bite\" is shoving the whole thing in his mouth so I told him to get another taco, which he did and proceeded to eat it in one bite. Our 4 year old had a cheese quesadilla ($5), and no complaints from him...besides his protests against my husband for stealing his food. A few requests for the menu, may be a long shot, but here goes...1. Chips and Salsa 2. Refried beans 3. Rice made with tomato base 4. Hot carrots!!5. HORCHATA! Or some orange soda? Jarritos maybe?

He didnt even know that his sign on the door was mispelt \"asta manana.\" Some white lady was telling him how to spell in spanish. First sign that he is not really Latino. Second 9.50 for a small @$$ burrito. Rice wasnt cooked good, beans were dry, little to no meat and the meat was just \"ok\". No jarritos or agua fresca. Salsa was blah.

These are hand made corn tortillas which hold Alejandro's slow cooked Carnitas meat. Delightfully spiced with the proper spices and not overloaded with the kitchen sink. My only regret was I forgot to get some added Avocado. The fresh diced onion gave it a bonus crunch, but not overpowering to the flavors of the meat! Rice was fresh and fluffy, not too wet or greasy.

After waiting for our luggage and the other people on our pre-arranged transfer from the airport to our hotel, we finally settled into our room about 5 pm. My body was confused about what time it was but I knew I was hungry and wanted a relaxing glass of wine. Luckily, I did some research about local wine bars before the vacation and found Vino Italian Tapas and Wine Bar and since it was sort of early to go out to dinner we felt justified in that Vino offers an amazing Happy Hour Special. All tapas (the whole food menu) is half off from 5:30 to 6:30 pm. Perfect! Tapas...can be a light or a heavy meal depending on how many tapas you order. We arrived at the address but didn't immediately see Vino. Facing Ala Moana Blvd, there is a Ruth Chris and Hiroshi. You have to go around to the right side of the building to find the entrance to Vino. We took the last 2 seats together at the bar. Vino offers an impressive collection of wines by the glass from small or boutique wineries. I like that Vino has two pour sizes: 2 oz. if you just want to taste a new wine and a full glass (5 oz.). Since I quickly breezed over the food menu before ordering wine, I decided on a French white wine to pair with the salad of fresh greens and pink beets, grapefruit, feta cheese with a lemon vinaigrette. The wine was dry as expected with French wine and I didn't care for it by itself. However, the wine came alive and was significantly enhanced when the salad was served. It paired well with the tart grapefruit and creamy feta cheese. The salad ingredients tasted fresh from the farm. I've never had pink beets before and they were very yummy. However, I have to admit they tasted very similar to red beets but the color was very pretty. Since we are big fans of ravioli stuffed with any and all 'squashes', my husband and I were the most excited about the Kabocha pumpkin and Molokai sweet potato ravioli. Yea baby, we were not disappointed! The pasta 'wrap' tasted homemade and the lightly sweet, creamy pumpkin and sweet potato filling was ambrosia. But that's not all...the ravioli were accompanied by tasty shrimp drizzled with pesto and sprinkled with sharp parmesan cheese and surrounded in a little lake of rich brown butter sauce. This was a stellar dish! Before our next course of tapas, we sampled some of the red wines. We were impressed that Vino had a sangiovese from Ciacci Piccolomini on the menu. My husband and I did a guided hiking and wine tasting tour in Tuscany in spring of 2009 and our Italian guides arranged a Brunello vertical wine tasting at Ciacci Piccolomini, a artisanal winery in Montalcino. This was the first time we have seen Ciacci since our Italy trip so of course we had to have a glass to celebrate wine and traveling. The sweet bartender told us that the owner and sommelier focuses on small, specialty wineries. She was more than willing to listen to our tale of visiting Ciacci Piccolomini and to answer our questions about the local produce and food scene. We finished with the Crispy Whole Branzino and a glass of cabernet sauvignon from Molly Dooker. We really liked the sea bass and it was certainly crispy but as the description says it is the whole fish...head, tail, and bones. So we had to de-bone the fish and I'm not very good at it so my husband and I had to eat each bite carefully to avoid the bones I missed. About 5 minutes before Happy Hour ended, the bartender came by to see if we wished to order any more tapas. We were full but I liked that she gave us the opportunity to put in an order before the special ended. Great service with a smile! Our first meal in Honolulu was fantastic...a great way to start a vacation."], ["David T.", "Came for late dinner last week and was pleasantly surprised at the quality and value of this restaurant. I knew that this is basically the sister restaurant of Hiroshi Eurasian Tapas, which is next door, but I have never had Italian tapas before so I was hesitant to give this place a try. The menu was much more 'Mediterranean inspired' and Italian than I anticipated, I saw more 'normal' items than tapas. I've heard they recently decreased the size of their menu so perhaps that is why. I ordered the truffled Mac and cheese for the night, and it must have been a slow night because we received our food about 5 minutes after ordering (we did arrive at 9:15 so the place was dying down at the time). Fortunately, the food was hot and looked like it was freshly made.The truffled Mac and cheese was great, the cheese was crispy on top and gooey on the inside. The mushrooms were nicely chopped so I didn't get any overwhelming bites of mushrooms at any time. The addition of prosciutto to the dish was much needed, it gave a necessary saltiness to balance the richness of the dish (I'm not a foodie, just my opinion). The truffle oil made the dish though, my only complaint was that it wasn't mixed in well enough, some parts of the plate had no truffle oil while other parts had too much. Overall, the price was good ($15) and, very importantly, the serving was absolutely perfect, not too much, nor too little. The bread appetizer was a little stale, otherwise it was a great meal. Also FYI, I heard you can order from the Hiroshi menu as well. I would definitely come back again."], ["Russel M.", "I wanted to love this place, really.

That's like having a Groupon, and never needing to print it out.I ordered myself the Osso Buco, a healthy serving of veal over mashed potatoes, vegetables and smothered in love ...errrrr, a reduction sauce. It was amazing for the price of $8. The veggies were soft and with the savory reduction sauce, melted once it hit your taste buds. The veal was perfect and tender, it slid right off of the bone, and into my mouth then I nearly slipped into a heaven. I asked which wines would pair well, and the bartender gave me an option of three available wines. I chose a rustic Italian wine, but when it came time to eat, I forgot all about my beverage because the food was delicious. Overall: with 50% off, it is definitely a Happy Hour, and one I will surely return to. An eight dollar osso buco was not the cheapest dish on the menu either. Additional pasta dishes, pizzas and meat dishes peppered the menu as well as sea food. Another additional aspect of the experience which made it all the better was owner Chuck Furuya who is an all-out amazing host... and funny jokester.24/365"], ["Teri Y.", "After a rough week at work, I decided I wanted to go for a glass of wine and some tapas. This was the first place that kept popping up on Yelp, so grabbed the hubby and said \"let go\". Set in the dying shell of Restaurant Row, which used to be a hip popular place to hang out, but is now filled with closed lease available areas, it was nice to see a bit of life in the corner of the area. It was like walking into a place we used to go to in Boulder Colorado - an attempt to look like Tuscany, not realistic, but fun. The place was buzzing! We were asked to sit on a leather couch as they worked on putting out more tables. The hostess quickly too our wine orders and then asked to take a tapas order so we would have something to nibble on while we waited. We ordered a Lambrusco and a Sangiovese. Wonderful! For our waiting tapas order, we chose the goat cheese agnolotti and langoustine. very expensive, but a larger serving than most tapas, so it did make the pocketbook scream as loud. Very good dish - an perfect example of how garlic should be used - not to overpower a dish but to bring out a contrast, especially with the goat cheese. \u00a0After about 20 min , we were seated and immediately had our entire order taken, more wine and fresh bread with really good olive oil and balsamic . My second glass was a Pinot Nero - never heard of it, but it was nice, light, went with the food well. We ordered a pan seared Foie Gras on Brioche. It was really really good, came with a sunny side up quail egg (cute) and this awesome duck proscuitto. OMG! Delish! Savory, smooth, irony at the same time. We then had the salami and cheese platter which was really good as well. One of the better charcuterie platters I have had. Finally my husband's favorite was the mini veal osso bucco...melt in your mouth....and marrow! We finished the meal with an apple tart your Grandmother would wrestle you over.

My faves include the ahi poke, ahi poke mandoo, unagi and butterfish arancini, spam musubi, and nairagi nacho. Actually, I pretty much listed their entire $5 happy hour menu, haha. Other items I enjoyed were the \"fried chicken\" (lunch) and beef and fois gras (dinner). I really liked the fried chicken but my fiance commented that it was a bit too sweet for him.

I got word from other foodies about how great and unique it was and from March until now it's been ongoing and we already have booked our Afternoon Tea sessions till November and it's gonna keep on going till they stop doing Afternoon Tea here at MW. I have been to many High Tea events from Canada to Japan and every single time i have been there it is usually the same things over and over again and at the end of High Tea, i am usually looking for the nearest Burger King or McDonald's to satisfy my appetite because it only makes mt stomach yearn for more food. What i truly like about the Afternoon Tea concept here at MW is that it's not the normal High Tea that you would expect. Now the portions here aren't huge, but let me tell you Chef Wade and staff make these Savory Bites with a twist and each and every month they outdo themselves each and every time as they create these little morsels of heaven that just erupt with some sublime flavors and textures it's like having an orgasm right in your mouth. I love the creativity and presentation of their Savory bites it just keeps me yearning for more. And the best part about this is that you get seven savory bites each month. And here's the kicker,it doesn't end there. You also get seven sweet bites and Scones to boot. So all in all, not only do you get fifteen samples of Chef Wade and Michelle's creations but they outdo themselves every month i have been coming. I am truly a fan. To me, this is the best 35 dollars you are ever going to spend your money on and believe me. once you start, it's gonna be pretty hard to stop attending these once a month events that on the third week of every month.Now the beauty of Afternoon Tea at MW is they have supplemental items that are included each and every month for an additional charge. And for a voracious eater like me, i always gotta have one or two of them every time i come here at MW. If there is one supplementation that stood out from the rest of them was The Prime Rib that they featured on June's Afternoon Tea menu. At 25 dollars, i was probbably expecting a sliver of it, but when the server told us it was 10 ounces, i almost peed in my pants. i was sold on it as soon as he said Ten Ounces and not Ten Inches ok??? The Prime Rib was phenomenal and cooked to perfection.  And for July's menu's supplementation, there were two things that got my mouth watering from the start by having the Lobster Ragout with a Butternut Squash Puree and Uni Chawanmushi with Bacon Dashi both for only 15 dollars each. All i can peeps is that after trying both of these supplemental items i literally died and went into a foodie trance.  So my advice to you is at least try the supplemental items that are featured in addition to the Monthly menu because they will defintely not disappoint. Now it's never a perfect world when writing a review, but if there is one gripe i have about our Afternoon Tea Sessions here at MW was the pace on how our food was being served. There were so many ebbs and flow's when getting served here and my only concern here is how the savory bites are being served in a timely manner. I understand that things have to keep moving at a steady pace but when you wanna truly enjoy the savory bites that they offer, they should be served at a pace where you can enjoy it and not eat it as fast as we can before our server comes and shoves more plates on the table at a blistering pace when there isn't even time to enjoy and savor our bites without all of us looking like a bunch of Hungry Hippo's trying to pop things in our mouth one after the other without us even having a chance to breathe.  I don't mind things coming out to our table, but the server's should see the pace as to how fast we are eating our savory bites and just when to come out with the next set of dishes. What's also disappointing was that most of our table's ordered supplemental item's all at once with the other items and there was literally no room on the table for all of it to fit and it got a bit chaotic and we were more concerned about eating things in a frenzy that we truly want to enjoy. We are spending extra money for it and i think they should pace it where we can truly enjoy it without \u00a0having someone breathing down are backs waiting for the next dish to arrive. And here's where it really puzzled all of us. After serving us our Savory Bites and Supplementaion's at an INDY 500 pace, the sweet bites took almost half an hour to come out. So in that half an hour, we were all trying to catch our breath's and let our savory bites settle in because they were still stuck in our throats and waiting for it to digest.I just wish they could slow the pace so we can truly enjoy Chef Wade and Michelle's creations. Will that detract me from coming back? No it won't because thing like that can be corrected and the food here is just too good to pass up here at MW. Make that reservation now....."], ["Erin H.", "I've been here twice: the first time for dinner and the second time for lunch. The food was superb! Here's what we had when we went for dinner:appetizers- fried chicken, unagi and butterfish arancini, and caesar saladI LOVED the fried chicken and caesar salad! The chicken had the perfect amount of crisp to it and was nice and moist on the inside. Caesar salad is always something that I like to order at restaurants and this was one of the best caesar salads I've ever had. It was just a little bit salty and that made it taste so good! The unagi and butterfish arancini was also good but not something that I would HAVE to order again. entrees- kalbi and mochi-crusted opakapakaThe mochi-crusted opakapaka was TO DIE FOR. There's just something special about that crispy, mochi-mochi texture around the moist opakapaka.

You only turn a year old once a year and what a great way to celebrate by going to a nice and elegant afternoon tea with a great companion. Food does taste better with great company! Thank you for this lovely treat!Thank you to the endless tantalizing photos of small sample bites and sweets galore galavanting all over the world wide web, I've been able to finally try the afternoon tea here. What a great introduction to their menu and what a fun tease! For the curious that are afraid to take the plunge, afternoon tea is held every third Sunday of the month with their changing set menu selection samples of small savory bites and for the sweet tooth, they also have a nice inviting selection of sweet bites. Their tea tastes divine! The selection of tea is what seems to stay the same (so far). When you select your tea, each different flavor will come with a glass teapot and a built in infuser. You have the liberty of making your tea however strong you like it. My go to choice was the Mango Peach. I love my fruit and sweet tasting teas. The tea is perfect to clear your palette after every new sample.Tea Choices-Sencha-Lemon Mamaki -Mango Peach-MW Chai-Lychee Acari-Maui Earl GreyThe month of September's Savory Bites consists of Lobster Bisque. One of my favorites out of this set menu and I wish I could have more. The small size soup is served in a glass with a tiny spoon. I love the hint of curry on top especially with the flavors blended together, which tasted divine. The Chilled Local Egg Flan which was also served in a small glass and chilled have a nice light taste to the palette. Which I was not use to. Another one of my favorites was the Wagyu Slider. Served in a nice sampler bite size bread with super tasty beef. One bite was not enough for the hungry! The Red Braised Pork Bao Bun is an unforgettable one. I loved how the texture was crunchy on the bottom, soft pork in the middle with a nice chili on top. The flavor had a nice sweet and chili touch to it. Pork Hash & Chinese Roast Duck Meatball was just as delicious along with the Beet Salad. One I want to have more of is the Housemade Gnocchi. I'm a big fan of Gnocchi when made right. This one is definitely something I want to have a full bowl of. The creaminess from the sauce fit perfectly with the gnocchi, crispy kale and cherry tomato on top. The month's freshly baked scone is the Lilikoi Curd which I really enjoyed.Sweet Bites for September-Summer Truffle Dolce Decadance-Banana Mousse with Caramlized Bananas-Chocolate Dipped Pretzel-Macaron with Lychee Acai Buttercream-Lemon Meringue Eclair-Almond Cake with Lemon MamakiMy favorites of the sweets is the Macaron with Lychee Acai Buttercream. I've had many Macarons in my life but not one like this yet. I love how it's served with the macaron on the bottom and with everything else on top. I took my first bite and it was a nice settling taste and not overly sugary. I love the hint of the Acai with the buttercream. Everything danced perfectly together. I enjoyed the Lemon Meringue Eclair as well. I am a huge fan of cream puffs with soft and yet crunchy texture to it. This eclair had it all with the sweetness from the lemon, cream and more cream! Lastly, I adored the Chocolate Dipped Pretzel. This particular dessert was not in any shape or form of a pretzel but tasted everything like a chocolate dipped pretzel. The chocolate did taste as if it were dark chocolate and milk chocolate layers and tasted wonderfully. If you're not full with the set menu, they also have supplemental items for an additional cost. After the nice introduction, I am ready to try their full size dishes. I would also like to try some of their other events.

I'm no high tea specialist but for the quality of food, I think it's worth the price. I'd highly recommend making reservations way in advance because spots fill up fast! For this afternoon tea, the tea is definitely not the focal point..the food is! Each little bit is flavorful and we were actually full at the end. So full that we all didn't finish our desserts!

This month, the savory bites were: a smoked opah sandwich, cucumber tapioca salad, Korean BBQ pork sandwich, duck pastrami burger, corn fritters, curry tofu & quinoa cake, and french onion soup. The sweet bites were: MW's twist on a french toast, banana foster, cherry cheesecake, cinnamon donuts, bread pudding 'creme brulee', pineapple upside down cake, and scones with yuzu curd. I loved everything, except the cucumber tapioca salad. It had weird textures from the tapioca and the tomato gelee. Everything else was delicious! My 2 girlfriends who are VERY picky said they wouldn't like/eat certain dishes ended up eating and loving everything!Not only was the food good but the service was great too! Our waiter was very attentive and let us eat at our own pace. After we finished our savory bites, he took all the dishes away and brought all new plates and utensils.

DOn't get me wrong, The food is all well prepared, the appetizers were very good, the entrees also good, however, I feel that just a s high quality meals can be had for less, or better quality and venues for the same price.

I'd heard a lot about MW from my foodie friends on Facebook, who raved about their Hawaii regional cuisine.I love their logo - the letters \"M\" and \"W\" formed by two forks. By the way, \"MW\" stands for \"Michelle (and) Wade\" Ueoka, the owners.The restaurant is not visible from the main boulevard; one has to enter through the building's side driveway and use their valet service, as the restaurant is on the backside. Unless you did what we did and entered the parking lot from the back street. Any parking you find there can be used (subject to certain restrictions) and you won't be charged the $4 valet fee.Inside, MW is bright and friendly, with the service counter on one end, and a small bar on the other. We got there for our 5 p.m. reservation and there was plenty of room. However, the host said that from 5:30 to 5:45, their reservations were stacked up, thanks to a corporate party in the adjoining room.Our waitress, Alyssa, who's a grade-school teacher during her day job, was very helpful in explaining a few of the menu offerings. She and the wife hit it off because they are both graduates of the same Honolulu high school.Their buttered toasted bread with a mayonnaise-butter aioli was absolutely delicious. They give you one slice apiece and you can ask for more, but as tasty as it was, we exercised restraint and held off.I had regular iced tea (it tasted of a mild mango flavor); the wife had the greenest green tea I'd ever seen - iced Macha Shiso Green Tea. Macha is the powdered tea used in tea ceremonies; Shiso is the \u00a0leaf used to flavor Japanese salted plums - ume.The wife ordered their Miso Butterfish, which, of course, I tasted. Oh my, one of the best I've ever had. It kind of made me wonder if I should have order it instead.But I had ordered their \"Course Menu Tasting\" selection.My meal started off with a chef's selection of appetizers:* Onaga and Nairagi Ceviche with Avocado Salsa and Corn Tortilla Chip - a pretty tangy spoonful of \"pickled\" fish that woke up my mouth.* Ahi Poke with Ikura, Uni, Crispy Rice Cracker - the traditional Hawaiian raw-fish dish, this one a bit on the spicy side that slapped my tongue to ensure it was awake.*Raw Kusshi Oyster with Oscetra Caviar - this reminded me of the ocean, with the little pop of the caviar.*Unagi and Butterfish Arancini with Nori Tsukudani and Kabayaki Mustard - this was the creamy appetizer of the bunch, it soothed the mouth of the previous appetizers' vibrancy.* Pickled Local Beets with Hawaii Island Goat Dairy Goat Cheese, Dill Pickles and Ume Beet Vinaigrette - an excellent taste of tangy beets and pickles, tempered by the creamy goat cheese.The next course was Mochi Crusted Opakapaka with Kim Chee and Yuzu Kosho Soy Vinaigrette. This is one MW's most popular dishes, and in fact, it's the one most mentioned in Facebook postings. The wife ate half of mine.Then, they brought me a Seafood Ravioli with Kauai Shrimp and Mentaiko (fish roe) Butter Sauce. The shrimp was perfectly cooked, and the ravioli was so good. The only problem was that I just dug right into it without taking a picture first. Now that's a head slapper. I did take a picture when I realized that, but then when I got home, I did a search on Yelp to find an untouched dish. I did - one posted by Jason D. So I swiped it to show you (that's his picture on the right). Thanks, Jason.My last entr\u00e9e dish was \"Stew and Rice\" (Big Island Tenderloin on Oxtail Risotto, Peanuts, Carrots and Mushrooms), basically a small steak on risotto. The steak was pretty tender, nicely done medium-rare, requiring no additional table seasonings (I refrained from asking for Tabasco Sauce). The risotto was delicious - just softer than al dente, with the peanuts, carrots and mushrooms providing some slightly firm \"crunch\" (or should I say \"shmunch\") with each bite.Finally, for dessert, they brought us a Tropical Fruit Creamsicle \"Br\u00fbl\u00e9e\" (Lilikoi Sorbet, Tapioca Pearls, Tropical Fruits, Lilikoi Custard, Guava Chiffon Aircake). They knew it was our anniversary, so they wrote a \"Happy Anniversary\" message in chocolate on the plate.My God, that dessert was so damned delicious I didn't want to share it with the wife. But she ate ... and ate ... almost half of it.If you go there, look for me. I need to go back and try some of the other wonders on their menu - say, the belly pork."], ["Hampton S.", "Went early one evening about 5:30. You're notgoing for the view, but for the food.

Most of us were done with our meal by the time his entr\u00e9e was delivered.

Service: it was my birthday and they were nice enough to put happy birthday Sungjin on the menu. I also enjoyed the waiters very prompt and dedicated service to our group.Food: they say that this place is Asian fusion but I have to disagree. It feels and tastes more like Korean fusion. So many of the flavors Korean inspired. We started off pretty much trying all the appetizers and were enthralled by all of them. My favorite was the \"fried chicken\" because of how tasty it was! I also enjoyed The tomato salad with pesto so fresh! For our main entr\u00e9es almost everyone had fish you have to try their special mochi crusted opakapaka which I absolutely loved!

We ordered Kalua Pork Quesedillas, ahi poke over tortilla chips and a Greek salad for appetizers. \u00a0The quesedillas, as aforementioned, were good. \u00a0But they weren't anything you couldn't make at home by throwing kalua pork and cheese in a tortilla. \u00a0The ahi poke over tortilla chips was a big disappointment. \u00a0It was cubes of fish over tortilla chips with some avocado. \u00a0Not worth the price. \u00a0The Greek salad was okay, but I would have expected it to be of more upscale quality from a place like this. \u00a0It was...well, a Greek salad. \u00a0Nothing special.For entree, I ordered the special, which was the chef's take on a Loco Moco. \u00a0This was essentially meatloaf with kim chee fried rice and gravy. \u00a0I was impressed with the combination, and the variation they took on a Loco Moco. \u00a0The meatloaf was okay...I was expecting it to melt in my mouth the way other upscale meatloaf I've had was. \u00a0It didn't do that. \u00a0It was just meatloaf. \u00a0The kim chee fried rice wasn't spicy the way I liked it, and it tasted like something you get from any old Korean take-out. \u00a0I wasn't impressed. \u00a0It tasted just fine, in fact, the egg on top really brought the dish together. \u00a0The gravy was okay, nothing to talk about. \u00a0I was also disappointed with that, also.The dessert was fantastic! \u00a0It was a lemon ice dessert, with a curd and a mousse. \u00a0I bit into the first layer and was hit by a bitter-sour taste. \u00a0I then took a bigger bite of the entire ensemble, and the way the flavors melded together was amazing. \u00a0It takes a GENIUS to think of these flavors and textures, and how it would be engineered to create a delightful sweet experience in your mouth! Unfortunately, as it came to the table looking like it was half-melting, I did not get a picture of it.I will come here again, if anything, for dinner. \u00a0I think maybe because this place is fairly new, they're still ironing out the kinks. \u00a0I can see great potential here, and I have a feeling that this will be the next hot spot for upscale dining."], ["Ray L.", "This was the second time I have dined here the first being a lunch which was when MW first opened up. \u00a0We went early enough to try and catch their happy hour which ends at 5 pm. \u00a0Parking here is all valet for $4 which is basically giving your key to the attendant who backs your car into a stall about 25 yards away. \u00a0There is also lots of metered street parking nearby if you can find an open stall. \u00a0We arrived about 4:50 pm and confirmed with our host about the happy hour time and after she sat us down, she told us that she would return with the other happy hour menu. \u00a0I watched her walk away and started to work on other tasks such as seating other patrons and realized we would never make the cutoff at 5pm to place our order in for happy hour. \u00a0The ambiance is nothing fancy with a standard dining room with large windows overlooking the parking lot. \u00a0There are a lot of servers working here and kitchen staff. \u00a0I counted close to 10 wait staff and over 14 in the kitchen. \u00a0Since we were there early, all of the wait staff were basically standing around talking to each other. \u00a0I guess when they get busy, all the staff are called into action.Our server came over to take drink orders and we quickly asked her for the menus which she confirmed that we only had 5 minutes to order. \u00a0There are basically about 10 items that are $5 each with the exception of two which are $10 each. \u00a0Those two are the deep fried oysters and the pizza. \u00a0We chose the oysters and the spam musubi for appetizers. \u00a0The main entrees were the seafood gumbo and the seafood spaezel.The spam musubi was the first to show up and it was two small pieces of spam covered by what appeared to be a flat rice layer chip fried to a crisp. There was a mix of seaweed which looked like they took the nori and mixed it to a paste. \u00a0Topping all of this was a small quail egg cooked sunny side which looked rather cute. \u00a0We did the obligatory tiny taste bites to sample the tastes when the entire thing could easily be swallowed in one bite. \u00a0RATING (1 - 10) 5 - taste was ok and the only unusual thing here was the rice chipNext came the oysters which was 6 tiny deep fried balls. \u00a0It came with a small slice of kim chee cucumber and some again very small portion of vegies. \u00a0I dont think this is worth the $10 cost of the dish and no better than what you might get at a standard fast food counter.RATING 4 - biting into the morsel only gave you a tiny bit of oyster before the panko took charge. \u00a0Would pass on this appetizer.The main entrees arrived and were nicely presented. \u00a0The Gumbo had some large chunks of scallops and jumbo shrimp over some cajun type rice with portugese sausage mixed in. \u00a0It has a kick of spiciness in it. \u00a0The clams were a disappointment as they were already shucked and really mixed into the whole mess so you really had to look for it. \u00a0I think keeping it in the shell would lend a more appealing effect. \u00a0This dish is about $35RATING - 6 good presentation and nice flavor but nothing outstanding. \u00a0The seafood spaezel was similar to the gumbo but without the spice. \u00a0Again the clams where lost in the mix since they were shucked from the shell (say that 5 times quickly!).RATING - 6 good presentation but nothing else specialDesserts are all $10 each and decided not to sample any of them. \u00a0They have some fancy names and descriptions but thought that it would be the usual tiny portion, fancy presentation experience.The total tab came to $76.00 for two with just two appetizers (supposedly happy hour priced) and two entrees only. \u00a0We drank water and no dessert so you can gauge the cost if you decide to go full heads in and order cocktails and dessert.FINAL RATING - 8 for service. \u00a0Our server was attentive and my water glass never got past empty.8 for presentation - nice appearance of dishes7 for taste - most dishes had good flavor but nothing to YELP about4 for value - high price and tiny portions"], ["Roxanne H.", "2 stars because the appetizers were amazing.

We came in promptly at our reservation time. The ambiance of the place is very open space. There are no columns or pillars to walk around...it really is one big open space that is filled \u00a0(but not cramped with) tables and chairs. The bar is on the mountain side of the building and allows for the guests to look at MW's collection of liqueur. On the side closer to Ala Moana shopping center, there is some bar seats, but instead of watching the bartender make drinks, you'll be watching the chefs cook your food. The party I was with was seated in the middle of the room.The menu changes frequently. There were specials of the day that the waiter went over. I decided to order the prix fixe menu - mango salad, loco moco, and the Hawaiian crown chocolate banana cream pie. The prix fixe menu was $25. While the waiter said it was smaller portions, and it may have been, there was still more than enough food as I had to take home leftovers.SHARED APPETIZERS:Chinese roast duck and pork hash quesadilla - tasty dish. Definitely has a fusion of Chinese flavoring with a Mexican twist since it was served on a tortilla with avocado puree on top.Fried chicken - while it is chicken, this was very reminiscent of roast pork with the crispy skin and the fact that the meat was cut up and served in a 1 inch cube. Regardless of how it looked, it was still very tasty and a unique take on fried chicken.PRIX FIXE MENU:Mango salad - it was a nice appetizer. I like the light, citrus, refreshing flavor the mango added to the salad. Loco moco - the beef patty in the loco moco was actually a meatloaf. The meatloaf was tender and seasoned well. The rice was actually fried rice that included Portuguese sausage and various vegetables. The sausage and the seasoning they used on the rice gave it a bit of heat and spice to the dish. It worked well with the meatloaf. Usually, the loco moco is drenched in gravy, but MW's take on the loco moco was light on the gravy...but I'm not grumbling about that. I think it was good that there wasn't too much gravy so that it didn't overpower or hide the flavor of the fried rice. The egg was cooked to my liking - over hard (I'm not a fan of runny yolks).Hawaiian crown chocolate banana cream pie - this is MW's take on the traditional banana cream pie. It's almost like a deconstructed pie because it's not some sort of chocolate and banana pudding served on a pie crust, topped with whipped cream. Rather, it is served in a jar. Inside the jar, there is a layer of dark chocolate, decadent pudding. On top of that pudding, there is like a layer of crumbled graham cracker cookies. Above that is some fresh bananas with kinako banana ice cream (it's not an overly strong banana flavor in this ice cream though). To top it off, there is some whipped cream with a bit of that graham cracker cookie crumble. On the side of the jar, there is a delicious salted butterscotch shortbread cookie. As decadent as the cookie sounds, especially in addition to the chocolate banana pie, it works so well with the pie because it offers this salty flavor that helps to bring out the flavor of the pie. The 'pie' itself is delicious - how can you go wrong with chocolate, banana and ice cream?!?!Overall, it was a good experience. Service can be a bit on the slow side, but it's worth it to taste the very unique dishes offered at MW Restaurant. Tip - there is street parking and valet parking available."], ["Kiana M.", "My husband and I had a wonderful first time experience.

For visual reference I took to Yelp to help me pick out which ones were the most popular- The crab cakes were a great choice. I felt like the consistency of the crab was very light and cooked well, but the star of this for me was the garlic black pepper sauce that it came with. The flavors melded so well together! No disappointments here. My boyfriend also got the lobster bisque soup with pieces of lobster in it, a delicious choice to start our evening off with. \u00a0For our main courses i went with the favorite- the Mochi Crusted Opakapaka, and bf had the special-Ahi. The dishes were an amazing work of art; all very creative and elegantly displayed. The flavors were bright, fresh, and all components complimented each other perfectly. These guys know good food. I felt like the opakapaka could have been cooked horribly at another restaurant, however this place takes such great care in making their food that the fish was on-point. By the time I was half-way into my dish I was already feeling full. \u00a0After filling our tummy's up with the main entrees, it was finally time for me to try their dessert (I've heard so many great things about the dessert here)! Feeling pretty full from my opakapaka, I decided on a somewhat lighter option- the tropical fruit creamsicle \"brul\u00e9e\". Made up of layers of Lilikoi Sorbet, Tapioca Pearls, Tropical Fruits, Lilikoi Custard, and Guava Chiffon. Each bite felt like I was biting into a different \"season\" (warm, cool, tangy, mild). I managed to finish the whole thing without feeling super \"full\". I recommend this dessert for those going for a lighter, more refreshing option instead of something creamy, heavy, or savory. \u00a0Price: Expect a pricey bill for dinner. Most of the dishes range in price from $26-$55. Lunch would be a great option for those who want to try this place without breaking the bank. Overall I really enjoyed my meal here. I left happy, having had a good experience (food + service related) and would like to thank our server for the bday wishes and \u00a0gifting me with an extra bag of their delicious chocolate mac nut cookies at the end of our evening. :) So appreciated."], ["Jason D.", "1:30am Sunday morning: that darn oatmeal raisin cookie totally hit the spot after a night out on the town partying it up with amazing friends on a Saturday night.Rewind to 2 months ago: text to best friend and cousin: let's go check out MW Restaurant. I'm going to make a reservation early, I heard they get super busy and have heard good things. Text from best friend and cousin: what's MW? What's the food like? Yeah, we're down. Rewind to Saturday: call in the afternoon from MW to confirm the reservation for 7:30pm.7:30pm: We arrive on-time and are promptly greeted. We're celebrating a birthday and the birthday girl is wished a happy birthday right before being seated at our table that was ready and waiting for us. That was the beginning of an amazing night and for the 5 of us, our first time to MW Restaurant, located in the old KGMB building on Kapiolani Boulevard, right next to the large First Hawaiian Bank. There's street parking or valet for a nominal cost. Perusing the menu, my cousin, who's birthday we were celebrating, quickly noticed her menu was custom printed with a happy birthday message - a real nice touch. She even got to take the menu home as a momento. We ordered appetizers, and of course, drinks. We got the fried chicken, which was amazingly crispy and reminded us Filipinos of chicharron \u00a0(fried pork rinds) - I mean, how do you get chicken to be square? We also got the calamari - super crisp and accompanied with a black pepper sauce that grew on all of us as we ate more. After much deliberation, 3 out of the 5 of us got the tasting menu, along with the wine pairings. It was a bit hefty at $100, but we were out celebrating a special occasion and we were MW virgins. Let me just say that it was money well spent. The staff was professional and answered our quesrions with ease. \u00a0Each dish paired perfectly with each wine and we didn't feel overly stuffed at the end of the evening.

This place is located next to Pho Saigon on Kapiolani. I'm not sure what the M or the W stand for but the logo for this restaurant is two forks pointed in opposite directions, which I thought was pretty clever. There is a large well lit (too well lit if you ask me) dining area as well as a bar as you enter. You can see the kitchen from the dining area. You're seated and the waiters are very attentive to filling your waters. The drinks were not good here. The shrub-a-rita had so much agave nectar that you felt like you're drinking straight up simple syrup. The feel the beet was very bland. The house focaccia bread is very well made with an aioli sauce, but the portion is so small it might as well be an amuse-bouche. The unagi and butterfish arancini is well made with rich flavors. The mochi crusted opakapaka has a great crust with a nice sauce. It rests on a bed of noodles, which together make a pretty good combination. The soy braised pork belly was not good. The pork was very sinewy and inconsistent. The braised short ribs with foie gras was a good dish with nice truffle accents in the mash. However, it was a very incoherent dish. I'm not one to complain when someone serves me a hunk of foie gras, but it really didn't belong in this dish and felt like a cheap attempt to elevate it. The chocolate banana cream pie was very underwhelming and uninspired. My big issue with this place is that I think it implies to promise a fancy meal: the valet up front, asking if there's a special occasion for dining with them over the phone, servers dressed up nicely, and even putting your napkin back on your lap after you've come back from the restroom. But in reality, this place doesn't deliver. They serve up mediocre food at fine dining prices.Overall, promises to be a fancy dinner without being so. Decent place for food not the drinks and not necessarily worth it."], ["Denalee C.", "MW has been on my 'to try' list for so long that I was afraid it was going to grow some serious roots and I may have to hire a professional to move it off the list to 'tried'.Fast forward to 14+ months MW has been open. \u00a0I tried to make reservations via yelp but since I had a party of six I had to actually call. \u00a0They required a credit card # and would charge me $20 a head if I cancelled my reservations less than 24 hours in advance. \u00a0Wow. \u00a0Maybe they've had many no shows, but I thought that was extremely strict.From the moment we got in the door, we were greeted by a friendly, helpful, attentive staff. \u00a0One of my favorite things was the bread. \u00a0It is a small piece of cut bread, buttered and toasted/grilled to a beautiful crisp. \u00a0They don't leave it on your table, they come around which makes sense when it hits your plate nice and hot. \u00a0Use their special sauce and I wish they would just stand behind me the whole night, refilling my bread plate once I devoured it. \u00a0Everything we ordered was downright delicious: beet salad, steak and potatoes, pork chops, gumbo, opakapaka, and butterfish. \u00a0The beet salad was definitely not drowning in beets, it had a ton of other well flavored items as well: cheese, tomatoes, pickles, etc. The opakapaka had a thick crust and was surprisingly crunchy for a pan fried dish. \u00a0It was tender and juicy on the inside. \u00a0The pork chops were incorrectly named. \u00a0They were really fork chops-it was fall off the bone tender and no knives were needed. \u00a0The steak was seriously enormous. \u00a0It took residency on most of the plate and was definitely the heartiest meal on the table. \u00a0The gumbo kind of reminded me of stew and was a little bit spicy. \u00a0The butterfish was simply amazing. \u00a0It really was like butter. \u00a0It was flavored well and cooked to perfection on the inside. The desserts. Wow. \u00a0Shave ice, br\u00fbl\u00e9e, chocolate banana cream pie, and lemon meringue. Shave ice kind of reminded me of guri guri...sweet but milky and melt in your mouth. \u00a0Br\u00fbl\u00e9e had a lot going on but was a sweet symphony of tropical fruit. \u00a0The lemon meringue was very tart. \u00a0I think I made the 'super lemon' face when I had a bite of the sorbet. \u00a0But the rest was sweet with a little bit of tart. The banana cream pie was not a pie-it was kind of like a trefoil. \u00a0It was my favorite dessert. \u00a0So simple yet so delicious. \u00a0The flavors all worked well together and was a delight.

Others at the table also enjoyed the oysters and the lobster (the lobster was the favorite of the afternoon by all who partook).As if we hadn't eaten enough, Formag Blanc Scones were served with Lilikoi Butter which was heavenly.The Sweet Bites included Wailua Chocolate Tiramisu, Tropical Fruit Cheese Cake, Banana Foster Malasada Bread Pudding, Pineapple Upside Down Cake, and Meyer Lemon Tea Cookies. \u00a0The favorites at the table included the bread pudding as well as the tiramisu. Additional sweet bites available for purchase included Apple Pie Lumpia and House Made Tropical Fruit Granola. \u00a0 The lumpia was so good I didn't even share....Tea selections were Jasmine Pearls, Lemon Mamaki, Mango Peach, MW Chai, Lychee Acai, and Maui Earl Grey.Service was attentive and the food was beyond perfect. \u00a0The tea menu changes monthly and is offered the third Sunday of each month. \u00a0There is already a wait list for February, but we're all looking forward to going back in March....and I'm sure again...."], ["Ruby P.", "It was last minute planning for my brothers birthday and everywhere I called was booked.

It's hidden behind a Vietnamese Restaurant on Kapiolani Blvd. I've driven on Kapiolani so many times but have never noticed it. It's painted a mint green color and its sign are two forks, one pointed upwards and the other downwards. It's probably easier to see on Makaloa St. Their parking lot is small but they do offer valet service for 4.00. Most of us had their Prix Fixe lunch for 25.00. What a bargain it was. Their Kim Chee Portugese Soup was one of the best for those of us who loves hot and spicy food. \u00a0Most of us had their Miso Glazed Butterfish or their Mochi Crusted Monchong. I had the Monchong. It was excellent! It had a light crunchy batter. The fish has a mild flavor. It is served with a Yuzu Shoyu sauce over somebody. Yum!My friends who had the Miso Butterfish also loved their selection. It was served with Taegu and watercress and a bowlOf rice. Our desert was a puff pastry with black sesame cream. This was \"ok\". Their menu changes. I guess it depends on what fish or produce is available.The down part of it all is that they are closed during lunch on the weekends!They have high tea about once or twice s month.

What does that have to do with the food? Absolutely nothing, but I liked the use of two forks, one right side up and one upside down to represent and \"M\" and a \"W\". (There's a picture of it by another reviewer, so I'm not the only one who was impressed by it.) \u00a0I also loved how on the inside of my menu, it read \"Happy Birthday Christa\" at the top. \u00a0Nice and easy way to make a girl feel special on her birthday. \u00a0Now for the food, wait, not just yet...let me first mention the Speyside spice cocktail. \u00a012 year old Scotch mixed with house made chili pepper water, Lehua honey (which is the best honey ever), and salt on the rim. \u00a0That was the best thing I had all night. \u00a0It is a great combination of spicy, sweet, and salty that leaves a slight tingle on your lips kind of like your first kiss! Ok, let me rephrase that, your first really good kiss. Ha ha! But I digress...on to the food:-Arancini appetizer is a fried ball of unagi and butterfish that is not overly fishy but mild and perfectly fried and crunchy-Oxtail Stew is tender and moist, but I was unable to detect the taste of mushrooms and peanuts that the menu description claimed to be included-Mochi encrusted Opakapaka was one of the dishes that fellow reviewers raved about, but I couldn't figure out why. \u00a0I thought it was plain and lacking flavor-Foie gras has an excellent taste and buttery consistency-Ribeye and potatoes were mediocre-\"Candy and donuts\" entree for dessert was a very small portion, but fortunately did not leave me wanting more because like the decor of the restaurant, it was just too plain and simpleThere was one last dish that I had, but for the life of me, I don't even know what it was! It was served in a small espresso like cup and it was creamy and smoky, with flavors of a mushroom.Valet is $4 and service was good. \u00a0You get a bag of cookies when you leave.

We were greeted at the door and waited no longer than 5 min as we did have an early dinner. We were then greeted by the servers as they placed the napkins on your laps and gave us the menu that was personalized Happy Anniversary.

The house bread was made I order and one of the best bread I've tasted. We ordered appetizers that happen to be on the happy hour menu. We ordered ahi mandoo and butterfish arancini. Both delicious! For our main entrees we ordered the steak and potatoes and the Kauai shrimp and ravioli. It's prepared differently than any other dishes I've seen before. The taste was impeccable, something different and new to the taste buds. We both enjoyed our meals and thought everything was good. Service is outstanding, servers kept refilling the water and checking up if we're doing okay and if they notice that we leave to go to the restroom they refold the napkins back to how it was when we sat down. For dessert we had the kula strawberry shave ice. They brought it out written in chocolate, Happy Anniversary. Then ended with two bags for chocolate chip cookies to take home.

But I must say this, as I've told part-owner Wade today. After ten years of searching where've been across the World and the Sate of Hawaii: I rate the oxtail pork belly soup the best in the State. I fully recommend \u00a0the dish. I don't often describe the dishes, but I want to explain what made me rate the soup so highly. It comes in a hot pot like they serve Korean Stew. It's piping hot but the pot keeps it temperature. The broth is thick and you can sense life from the aroma. Almost like the marrow is tickling your nose.It also comes with your choice of white or brown rice or quinoa. And a dipping platter of ginger sauce like the type they use for cold ginger chicken accompanies the dish.Inside, there's pretty much everything you expect to be in oxtail soup. Choi sum, cilantro, peanuts, shiitake mushrooms. The combination of oxtail and pork belly just takes this over the top.There are many restaurants that claim to have the best oxtail soup. MW doesn't boast this but they now know, according to this Yelpie, that they could and should.Just so you know, this is in comparison to Aiea Bowl, Violets, Zippys, Kalihi Bowl, Tanakas, Asahi, George's Meat Market and countless others."], ["Divina R.", "This rating is primarily for their special dimsum brunch featuring Joanne Chang.

Our waiter didn't come to our table until we had been waiting for 15 minutes after we'd been seated. Then our wine bottle took another 10 minutes to arrive after we ordered it. The explanation was that they lost track of their wines. Our salads took another half hour to arrive after we ordered. Then a long time passed with no explanation of what was going on. Eventually our waiter came by to apologize that our food was taking so long because another event was taking place next door. After another 20 minutes the manager came by to ask if we were having problems but offered no apologies or accommodations after we said it was unacceptable to wait so long for our food. Over an hour and fifteen minutes after we ordered our food it was delivered. We ate and ordered desert, which then took another 20 minutes to arrive.

Such was the case when I wanted to try the nairigi poke nachos but with cooked instead of raw fish. I know, sacrilege to the poke lovers, but I can't do raw fish. So it came cooked and I was able to enjoy the dish all the more!So far, the fish dishes I've tried have all been sheer perfection ... It shows the tender loving care of the chefs that the fish just melts in your mouth. That same attention goes into the desserts, and that candy bar plate has got to be right up there in status with Alan Wong's crunch bars! Service is attentive and friendly, and there's ample parking.

This place has been on my list to try for a while now, and I was so excited to see it on the list.For Lunch Menu ($25) The choices of starters: Portuguese Bean Soup or Caesar Salad. The choices of Entree listed online: Mochi Crusted Monchong, Twice Cooked Tonkatsu, \"Roast Beef Sandwich\", but there were more list there. And for dessert, it was Coffee and Cream.I chose their take on a local favorite the Portuguese bean soup with a Korean twist. Such comfort food with a spicier kick. Instead of cabbage, it was kim chee cabbage. This is now my new favorite PBS.My mind was set on the Roast Beef Sandwich when I saw the online menu, but when I got there, the list was 3x more. I couldn't resist another comfort item, the Red Wine Beef Stew. When it arrived, it wasn't the traditional beef stew I am used to. It was plated with the beef under an array of veggie either what seemed to be roasted or tempura'd served with a side of rice. Oh. My. God. It was so delicious!! The red wine beef was more like a braised beef goodness. It was a bit saucey (teriyaki-ish), and that's where the rice came in to mellow out the flavor. And the veggies were good too.The dessert... oh, the dessert! It was a nice balance. Not too sweet, but just the right light-ness to bring the meal to a close. I would write about it, but to be honest, I can't remember what was explained to me. It was good!!I loved that I was able to reserve a table online via Yelp. I did wait 30 minutes after checking into the time I had reserved. This place isn't for a quick meal. I was there for about almost two hours.The staff is very friendly and professional. They were attentive even though the process was slow.I really enjoyed the food! I look forward to returning to experience dinner."], ["Irene G.", "Awesome service, ample parking, food was on par!

Long story short: pretty good, but with so may other better options for the same food in Honolulu there's other options out there. Loco moco was a solid choice. I think this was a strong tie with the garlic shrimp for best things to order. The garlic shrimp had a good flavor but left me wanting more shrimp. The Omu haiyashi looked so good in the pictures but was actually fairly mundane in real life. I think it missed out on having stronger spices and sauce with the rice diluting the better flavors. The cobb salad was standard fare and came out in a nice bowl that was easy to share, but was nothing to write home about. I think overall a better rating would require better seasoning and stronger flavors.

But since they emphasized this item so much, I went with it.I gotta tell you, although I still think its a waste of good meat, it was pretty ono! Not for its meat quality, (which is indistunguishable in burger form) but its composition, spicing, and texture. The burger was smothered in a gravy that was a little reminiscent of curry.

I ordered the braised beef \"curry.\" It wasn't really curry--just a modestly (and appropriately) portioned dish of delicious, flavorful, tender braised beef and rice. For $10, that's pretty much the best deal you can get in Waikiki in a sit-down restaurant. My boyfriend's salmon pasta was fine--a bit too rich, but good. My only complaint would be that there weren't many vegetable options and the entrees didn't come with sides. Service was also pleasant. I ordered the acai dish, which was out.

We were under the impression that just slicing it would not be considered \"splitting.\" He also said the garlic fries had the $1 up charge just like the sweet potato fries (sweet potato fries were on the menu, garlic fries were not). He was friendly enough but he didn't make the situation any better either. I think we all understood these extra costs, but they should have been told to us by the waitress up front.

Normally, I feel like the manager would give us some kind of credit back since the up charges were not mentioned to us up front...even just to make us happy. $6 is a small cost for the restaurant (they probably didn't even incur ANY cost for slicing) to keep our business.

You can bash me and say, \"just ask them!\" I don't wanna waste time asking them to detail each and every damned thing.***beet and cheese salad comes with blue cheese NOT goat cheese; I was obvi very saddened about this twist on the traditional.Wi-fi: Ok, so others have stated it was free; one reason I wanted to come. But the employees don't tell you about it (they don't even really ask if it's your first time here/if you have questions.) So I'm a bit split in how I rated this.Service: Overall ok, nice enough! Except when I tried to have our dishes clear, the girl told me to leave it. And. Didn't. Come. For. Another. 20. Minutes. I could've saved her, me, and you time (this would've not been In this forever review.)Last but not least, the food!I expected way too much. For the price I paid, at least. *French dipped pizza $16: tomato-based thin crust pizza, thin pastrami, drizzled with sour cream with au jus. First off 1) pizza you have to dip shouldn't be thin. And the crust was burnt burnt. Tomato sauce tang overpowered everything.I don't know why you'd put tangy dairy (sour cream) on tomato sauce. Acidic+acidic= acidic (yah the dairy of the sour cream didn't cut anything.) YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED IF YOU GET THIS.Beet and goat cheese salad ($12-16): Spanish dressing. What is that? Girl sure didn't know, but I got it. No goat cheese but blue. Yuck. Greens were fresh and lots of beets tho!Maui onion soup ($6-9?) Their twist on the french onion soup. The broth itself was really good (you could tell they cut the broth with tomato juice or something) but it was nice and not salty for a change. No melted cheese/bread inside but served separate. Pipikaula/arabico(?) pork charcuterie($12): Very thinly sliced pieces. Maybe 6 pieces of each? Pork is quite strong in flavor game-wise. Otherwise both plain pieces of meat. Overall: While the decor and premise of the establishment has so much potential, food is an inadequate representation of price. Don't think I'll be back, sorry!"], ["Terri L.", "I came here with my girlfriends for Restaurant Week last night. I absolutely LOVE the atmosphere and interior of this place--that's always a big factor for me. Let's get down to the food...Black Truffle Custard: YUM! I like how simple the presentation was (similar to the rest of the restaurant...simple, clean, and modern, with a touch of rustic) and the taste was really good! The custard is in an eggshell so it's quite a small portion.Tapa Trio: I really didn't care for these bite-sized tapas at all. Beets and peach, mango and crab tartar, and a beef empenada. These just didn't vibe with me as something I would really ever order. Especially the mango and crab tartar, the flavor was just a little too strong and kind of off-putting.Blue Prawn Risotto: I LOVED this one.Make sure you eat all the meat in the head of the prawn :) Honey risotto was really tasty (this course is served cold) and I love prawns so it was a big win for me.Double Duck: The duck breast and foie gras was cooked perfectly. So tender and so delicious! This is served on top of mashed potato with a coffee glaze, and although I don't looove coffee, the taste was actually really good! The glaze almost tasted like barbecue to me. The corn with parmesan and truffle was also very tasty. My friend got the uni pasta and I tried a little bit of that. The noodles seem very fresh and the sauce was nice as well. Not as creamy/heavy as some other uni pastas I've tried, which is good!Molten Lava Cake: This was kind of whatever to me since I'm not a huge dessert fan. But I will say from the completion of our entree course to when the dessert came out was a whopping 45 minutes. I was getting a little impatient. 45 minutes for a dessert course (especially during restaurant week where everyone is getting the exact same set menu??) seems unacceptable. Overall, not a bad restaurant week dinner. I like three of the courses a lot so I'd say it was a win for me. I definitely want to come back when it's regular menu and try the paella, oyster shooters, and chicken liver pate!!"], ["Ariana M.", "Decided to check this place out on a Sunday. I was sad to find out that they stopped serving breakfast by 10 am :(And they don't offer their tapa's menu till 3 pm. BOOOO. They did offer other items on the menu, but I already had my heart set on breakfast. The venue itself was nice. I loved how spacious and bright it was. The Grub. [[ FRENCH DIP PIZZA $14.95 ]] yelp.com/biz_photos/brea\u2026 This was an interesting concept, I never thought of something as creative as dipping a pizza~![[ SMOKED AHI SANDWICH $13 ]] yelp.com/biz_photos/brea\u2026 This was surprisingly good. It was light and refreshing and perfect for lunch. Overall: I was a bit disappointed that I couldn't get breakfast, I wish they served it at least till 12 pm. But the two items we did end up ordering were good."], ["Diana L.", "Came here on a whim. Bread and Butter is located next to Shokudo, where Angelo Pietro used to be. There is validated parking - FREE! Just make sure you park in the marked stalls for the establishment and not the reserved ones!The place itself is open and very, very well-lit. Seating is limited. When you walk in, you walk all the way to the other end of the place in order to order your food. If you decide to dine in, they give you a number and it's up to you to find a place to sit. So if you can't, tough luck. Wait it out and hopefully someone will leave soon. I think this system could be a little better organized. My suggestion: find a place to sit first then go ahead and order. They'll bring the food and drinks to you. Otherwise, just take your food to go. I tried their ham, cheese, salami sandwich. Take-out, of course. It wasn't bad. Wasn't exactly WOW either. Came with a salad and some pickled vegetables. My friend got their loco moco. That, too, wasn't bad.Although food wasn't out-of-this-world amazing, I'd come back. I think they have a lot of potential and have a lot to offer, they just need to get their rhythm first. Cashier had said they opened less a month ago (from the date of this review). They've got a tapas menu too, which I intend to come back and try out. Enjoy!"], ["Van L.", "I visited for restaurant week so the menu was prefixed. Most things were borderline okay, while the risotto was horrible and the foie gras was pretty good. The first plate was an egg custard that had truffles, and was a good teaser for the rest of the meal... Here, the word teaser is very appropriate because it was all downhill from there. The second course was a mix of the small dishes. The beet and peach fruit salad was nothing special. I could have lived my life not eating it and I would have been fine. The blue crab cake tasted like canned tuna from what I was told since I don't eat seafood. The wagyu beef mandoo was bad. It didn't taste like it was a quality product, more like frozen ground beef. The risotto was the third course and as I mentioned before, it was horrible. It was so undercooked that the grains were raw. The saving grace (saving this review from crashing toward one-star categorization) was the main dish comprising of duck, foie gras, and truffle corn. While I didn't care for the duck, everything else on the plate was pretty good. The dessert was blah. A molten cake that wasn't hot enough to melt anyone's heart paired with vanilla ice cream and some fruit. It wasn't bad, but also wasn't good. My friends all agree, we're never coming back."], ["Malia H.", "This place is the new thing. It's by Shokudo and I believe it's the same owners. I love the interior: spacious and fresh. There are high ceilings and it's brightly lit. There definitely are choices on where to sit. There are tables, wine bar counter seating, booth/chair seating, counter seating in the middle of the room and a small couch table setup area to sit. The place is large but not crowded. It's a good thing I ran into my friend who was having breakfast...who showed me the ropes. The place is a cafeteria style. There are menus at the cashier where you order. Then you pick a table or counter. \u00a0You can also get water and get your utensils. The water had lemons in it and the cups are the small trendy jars you see at various places. Breakfast finished at 10am and we got there at 10:05 am. The cashier was nice and let us order breakfast still. smoked ahi sandwich - best tuna sandwich on island. Fresh tuna salad with sprouts on toasted bread! Need I say more? It came with a salad with a light vinaigrette and pickled veggies. The salad was ok but loved the pickled veggies! breakfast dashimaki tamago- interesting skillet with egg mixed with dashi and rice topped with prosciutto. At first, I didn't know what to make of this dish. It's light and a interesting mix. Maui onion soup - basically a French onion style soup that comes with a piece of foccacia covered with cheese. The soup was good but nothing different from a French onion soup. mac nut cappuccino - oh my gawd sweet goodness. It's everything you'd want in a mac nut coffee - a good strong coffee with the sweet aroma and flavor of mac nut. It is a little more on the sweet side which is probably why I enjoyed it more. The prices were average and the portions were decent sized. I wasn't stuffed but I wasn't hungry still either. Coffees $3.50-$5Breakfast $3-$16.95...there's a $32.95 charcuterie plate...I'll look at other people's photos to see if it's worth it Tapas $7-$15Lunch/dinner $5-$16.95 Overall, a cute place with decent dishes. I still need to come back and try their tapas and dinner menu. To be continued..."], ["Paul C.", "After seeing some pics and mixed reviews of this place I wasn't anxious on trying Bread + Butter. \u00a0However, when some fellow Yeeps announced a UYE here I jumped on board. \u00a0It's not easy to host UYE's so I wanted to support the co-hosts.First of all, I wasn't planning on attending after I heard their AC was out-of-order. \u00a0Having dinner in an enclosed restaurant when it's been warm is NOT appealing to me. \u00a0So, when I noticed Kristine C. check-in here I texted her asking about the AC situation and when she advised it was working I headed over here.Located in the previous spot of Angelo Pietro's just next door to Shokudo, Bread + Butter has a great layout and I appreciate the tall ceilings and brightness of this place. \u00a0Their menus are on a clipboard so once you're ready to order, head to the Ewa side of the restaurant, just by the pizza oven to order your food. \u00a0It's like a cafeteria-style format where you order, pay and receive a number which you bring to your table. \u00a0Utensils and water are both self service. \u00a0Once you secure your seat you place your number on the table and the staff will bring over the food to you. \u00a0Because this was a well attended UYE we occupied a very long table and could spy on each other's meal. \u00a0If you were lucky some Yeeps would offer their food to you to sample. \u00a0This is what I tried:1) Chicken Pate w/ Truffle Oil (4/5)I LOVE LOVE LOVE liver and pate so this was a no-brainer for me. \u00a0The flavor was very good but the texture was a just bit too soft. \u00a0Served with lightly toasted Foccacia bread this was a great appetizer / light meal.2) Iberico Pork and Local Pipikaula (1/5)I was really looking forward to this dish but it just fell FLAT with me. \u00a0They are both smoked meats but the flavor was to be found. \u00a0Do you enjoy eating flavorless meat? \u00a0Not my cup of tea at all. \u00a0I forgot what I paid for this but it was a waste of my money.3) French Dip Pizza (2/5)My friend gave me a slice of this pizza and I didn't really care for it. \u00a0Could it be because I don't care for french dip sandwiches where the bread gets soggy from dipping it in the au jus? \u00a0I chose NOT to dip the pizza and just ate it as is. \u00a0It didn't have any wow factor. \u00a0Chewed on a lot of crust so it was a waste of space in my stomach. Service was disappointing. When I decided to order I waited for quite some time and saw the pizza cook in action. \u00a0I looked around to see employees talking among themselves. \u00a0When I saw them laughing I realized they were just goofing off. \u00a0Before I had a chance to interrupt the girls the pizza cook yelled at the cashier to come back to the register. \u00a0No apology offered in having me wait. \u00a0She smiled and asked me what I wanted to order.Want water refills? \u00a0It's self-service so the good thing is that we didn't have to tip. \u00a0Some people may like this type of dining. \u00a0This could be a great place for a date because of its convenient location, spacious seating and bright atmosphere. \u00a0But sadly, the food just didn't do it for me. \u00a0Did I make the wrong food selection? \u00a0Perhaps. \u00a0I'll give this place another shot but not eager to return here soon."], ["Liberty P.", "Don't let the name fool you. Yes, Bread + Butter serves carb-laden food like sandwiches, pasta and pizza, but they also happen to have some pretty tasty salads. My go-to pick is the mango and quinoa salad. Sounds super healthy, doesn't it? *smug face* The light papaya vinaigrette they use on this salad makes it both refreshing and a delight to eat. Yes, a DELIGHT.I've also tried their four cheese and honey pizza. While I loved the combo of cheeses and honey, it doesn't beat Happy Valley's super cheesy version (and obviously \"cheesy\" is a good thing in this context). I usually like thin-crust pizza, but the crust was almost too thin and too crunchy for my liking. The honey flavor is also quite subtle, though this may be a good thing for people who aren't into the whole sweet-and-savory thing.Thumbs up for the cute modern/rustic interior design!"], ["Diane K.", "Bread + Butter is a delightful new spot located right next door to Shokudo. While my overall experience was very enjoyable, we had a bit of an awkward start. We walked in and had no idea what to do. Do we wait for someone to seat us? Opening seating? We took a seat near the entrance and after a few \"...\" moments of sitting, I asked someone if we were supposed to order our food at a counter. Yes!The counter is located at the back of the cafe-style eatery. While this may seem obvious to others, we arrived when there was no line and it was hard to tell since all the other patrons already had their food. Several people popped in during our meal and asked us about the food. I think they were probably also under the impression it was more conservative dining. Perhaps signage at the entrance would be helpful.The food here is excellent and I will definitely come back. We were on our way to an event and stopped by for some tapas. The Margherita Pizza ($12.95) was delicious and a perfect shareable for two. The Smoked Salmon and Dill Cream ($7) went surprisingly well with pizza. I can't wait to come back!"], ["Chavah A.", "I love Bread + Butter. I'm a foodie and very particular but this is now one of my regular spots! Their selection is good for anyone. They have a great wine selection, good coffee and the ambiance is perfect. Good for breakfast lunch and dinner and they have a fantastic event 1x a month with food and wine paring! Does it get any better? I submit that it cannot! It's my favorite place in Oahu thus far. Cheers to you Bread + Butter!"], ["S Y.", "First time there and on yelp, clean place. workers were all friendly. Food was good and many varieties you usually don't see."], ["Kristine C.", "Seeing numerous yelpers check in sparked my curiosity about this pretty cool looking and trendy spot. First, I've read some pretty mixed reviews. But I am a stubborn girl and at most will have to try things at least one time. The atmosphere was beautiful and relaxing with lots of white, wood and foliage. It's a nice place to bring a book and enjoy solo and sit on their couch or lounge with a group of friends for a relaxing meal. The Menu consisted of different variations. A nice selection of hot and cold coffees' but no iced tea. I am pretty excited about their breakfast which is served until 10am. The choices for breakfast looks and sounds delicious! I absolutely love that they have some local fusions to Japanese dishes, tapas (served starting at 3pm), soups and salads, pizza, pasta to acai and poke bowls. But no desserts! Don't let me forget to mention their separate menu for wines and beers. What to expect when dining here. First it's a cafeteria style. After deciding, you will stand in line to order with the cashier and your order will be brought to your table. \"Technically\" there is a number system for the meal runner to deliver people's order (receipt inside the mason jar you take with you). But at the time, they were still having difficulties finding the owner to people's food outside of our group. Confusing.. We came with a pretty big group. Thankfully, we didn't have a problem with getting our food. I had chosen the Carbonara. Needed a meal that contained lots of carbs and this did it's job. I liked this dish which was creamy and tasty. The only thing I would change is the fatty smoked meat. While I enjoyed what was left of the meat, I mostly got the fatty parts \u00a0(one star out). The portions are okay. However, if you're ordering the lobster bisque mac + cheese or the short rib loco moco, they are served in a skillet which isn't so big. But still might fill you up for the most part. A friend of mine ordered the French Dip Pizza which was \"a fun pizza\" he said. I had a bite of his and I agree. It was definitely fun and I enjoyed the au jus dip that came with it.Overall verdict. I am still looking forward to trying their breakfast, tapas and everything else on the menu."], ["Rachel W.", "My boyfriend and I were looking for a cafe to grab a quick breakfast and decided to try out Bread + Butter -- despite hearing mixed reviews on the place from friends. In short, we should have listened to the warnings.Walking in for the first time can be confusing. Do you sit down or order at the register? We didn't know because no one approached us to ask if we had dined there before. We eventually gravitated towards the register because there was a woman behind it and a few menus on the counter.I decided on the breakfast burrito ($5) and Jake decided on the same plus a spam and quail egg musubi ($3). We found that both these items were already prepared, sitting in what looks like a container that keeps them heated. However, as soon as we grabbed them we realized they had been sitting there at room temperature for however long. We each paid for our orders along with two iced coffees ($4 ea.) and then sat down at a table of our choice. I bit into the burrito and was disappointed to find that it was barely a breakfast burrito -- the only thing breakfast about it was the bits of egg inside. No breakfast meats like sausage or bacon -- just lukewarm meat and beans... Not what I was expecting at all. Aside from the disappointing food, the atmosphere just wasn't the most inviting. The floors are unfinished -- maybe in an attempt to look hipster? But overall it comes across as just trying too hard to be trendy.On the plus side, the place does have free WIfi, along with some comfy looking seating. I would love to come back and try some food that changes my opinion about the place. Maybe I'm being too harsh, but it was far from a good first impression."], ["Stephanie L.", "Nice new place!FOOD:I had the onion soup and a truffle oil chicken musubi for a light lunch one afternoon. The soup was really really tasty - not too salty (like onion soup can be) and full of flavor. The musubi was a little bland, sadly. SERVICE/SPACE:It's order-at-the-counter service, which is fine. It took about 10 minutes for my soup too arrive, which seems a little long for soup, especially when I was only the 3rd customer in the place. The space is really nice. It's open and light and feels welcome. I saw some other people there studying - and what a beautiful place to study in. PRICE:I was a little disappointed by the prices. I was looking for a small lunch around $12, but after ordering the soup there wasn't much else I could add and stay at that price (maybe a handful of olives). I ended up adding a musubi, but it think it would be nice if the restaurant offered 1/2 salads or a soup + something combo. That's all... a small suggestion."], ["Diana C.", "I really wanted to like this place, I mean the name is so catchy! Unfortunately, it was a mediocre experience. I would have given this place just 2 stars, but the customer service bumps it up to 3. The decor was very eye catching... High ceilings, white walls, drift woods, and lots and lots of succulents... This one of those places where you order your food first, get a number, and then find a seat. I ordered the lobster bisque Mac & Cheese and my fianc\u00e9 ordered the ahi poke bowl. I also got the iced cafe latte. No fountain drinks here, which is another minus for me. The lobster bisque Mac & Cheese was on the runny/soupy side, I prefer mine thick creamy. The flavor was pretty on point though, there was a good amount of lobster and it wasn't over salted. I would give it a 3.5/5. I didn't try the Ahi Poke bowl, but the fianc\u00e9 said the fish wasn't the freshest. It came in a huge sized coffee mug with rice, limu, and the ahi (shoyu/wasabi flavored). He gives it a 3/5.Finally and probably most disappointing was the iced cafe latte. It was way to milky... The only part of the coffee I could taste was the bitterness. I would give it a 1/5.Also, and this is probably the only reason I would go back... They had a wine bar with deli meats and cheese! I'm totally a sucker for the whole wine & cheese experience!"], ["Ryan M.", "Came here with a group without really knowing how it worked. You gotta order up at the counter then they give you a number and bring your food out to you. Well I guess not that complicated but just a heads up.It makes a great first impression with stylish clean decor that would perhaps best be described as industrial modern meets vintage shabby chic?The food selection is pretty interesting haole kine and we got a couple salads, pizza, gourmet Mac n cheese, a cool: meat, cheese, olives and bread platter that was delish. Overall I thought it was good and a break from the usual island fare"], ["Liz S.", "I have visited Bread + Butter three times now, each time I have enjoyed my experience but in different ways.The First Time - I came here with a group of friends for dinner. Their menu consisted of tapas, appetizers, salads, pizzas, soups and small entrees. It was great having the variety of menu items to choose from, so we could share and try all the different plates.The Second Time - I came here with one friend for dinner and was just craving a soup and salad, something light, but delicious. It was perfect, I could choose from different soups and a nice refreshing salad. I love soup/salad places! They are really perfect for people with small(er) appetites, like myself. But don't get me wrong, they have other items on the menu that are for people who like rich and savory foods too.The Third Time - I recently visited when they started their full dinner service. I really liked the idea (makes it less casual), but their menu was lacking. The new dinner menu still includes tapas, appetizers and entrees, but doesn't have the variety like the (now) lunch menu offers. The food was great (we got the braised oxtail), but we were looking for more vegetables and color to our meal. The new menu didn't even have a salad (or at least I didn't notice one, unless it was in some fancy language that I didn't know/recognize)!Overall, I suggest coming to lunch at Bread + Butter if you're looking for a soup/salad/sandwich-like place. It'll be more of a light and refreshing kind of deal. But if you're looking for more of a rich and savory meal, come at dinner time, where the dishes are a little more complex and heavy."]]}
