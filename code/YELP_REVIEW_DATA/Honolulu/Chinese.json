Kimchi is served per table. We ordered shrimp fried rice, mongolian beef and orange chicken and mannnnn was it good! It tasted like real Chinese food with real Chinese spices. Food are on the hide side and also took a little bit to come out but I believe its because it's cook-to-order. Be advised to eat all you food because leftovers (a day old minimum) didn't taste as good.Customer service is good as well; our server paid attention to us even if they knew little English (the menu itself will say it all!)If you're ever craving Chinese food, I recommend you to check out this place."], ["Joyce L.", "Eastern Paradise Restaurant has been around for a long time.

So seeing that this was the top highlight initially had me thinking this was just a regular chinese place which only does well on the dish that is impossible to screw up. It turns out that I was wrong. I don't know what they did differently, but their honey walnut prawns were absolutely delicious and better than any other I have had previously. It is perfectly sweet and creamy and the sauce melts so nicely into the rice noodles it rests on that I actually ate all of the noodles as well. Definitely try this out.Crispy beef - I couldn't resist ordering something called crispy beef. It was decent enough, with a slightly sweet and tangy sauce. The texture was a little crispy but also a little chewy. I liked it, but I would not order it again.Spiral buns - This was a very bland fried bread dish, which is probably why they serve it with condensed milk. The look is interesting but it's rather plain overall. Pass on this.Overall, I was very impressed by their honey walnut prawns and I would order that again. I probably wouldn't order anything else, but I would get takeout from here again."], ["Laces S.", "The food simply did not compare to Chinese food back home in SF and the area was scary at night."], ["Mailin C.", "Great Chinese food!

It was a really small hole-in-the-wall that earned its reputation for its cake noodles. Mostly Chinese-speaking folks frequented the restaurant so you know, if the native language speakers go there, then it must be good! \u00a0The owners are a young husband and wife who took over from, I think, the wife's parents. \u00a0The husband does all of the cooking while the wife runs the front of the house. Since the young couple took over, the clientele has expanded to a more diverse patronage. As regular diners, whenever we enter, the owner knows our \"usual\" order but will still politely provide us with a menu.

Both of our cake noodle dishes have crisp fried squares of thin Hong Kong-style noodles napped with chicken or pork based gravy. The bite-sized boneless chicken is tender and flavorful with tender cooked color contrasting pieces of choy sum. My dish of Sam See cake noodles is just as flavorful that has a meat topping combination of chicken, ham and pork stomach and choy sum. \u00a0There is a small crock of spicy chilie oil and a bottle of Chinese red vinegar as condiments that you can use to compliment your dishes. \u00a0We've tried their equally fantastic Minute Chicken, Beef with Ong choy (water spinach), braised beef brisket, fishcake and..and..cake noodles. \u00a0But, we always return to our favorites.

But it is a great place to eat and establishment to support. Chen's Noodle House can learn a lot from this place.The food is great! I had the wontons which were perfectly cooked and had meaty chunks of shrimp embedded in the ground pork. I also had their signature dish: fried chicken thighs served on a bed of crispy noodles and Chinese broccoli. The beauty was how the chicken was prepared. The thighs are cut in thin cross-section so that in every bite you get a mix of muscle, tendon, and fried skin. It was surprisingly flavorful. I also got the stir-fried \"empty-heart vegetable\" with bits of garlic which was also wonderful. It is amazing how people can screw this simple one up. But not here, it is perfect here. The salt and pepper shrimp was also good. Better here than on the North Shore. I think in general, if you want to eat shrimp, you should have it Chinese-style.One last thing: the tea. They have the best farging tea I have ever had at a restaurant. It seemed like an oolong tea. But it had notes of apricot/date/figs and was extremely fragrant. It's as if someone shoveled dried fruit into the tea kiln. Not like the water they call tea at Legend next door. The first brew was the best. I will remember it forever.The restaurant is very much a family business. And the owner/chef was very attentive to our needs. We apparently caught him when the restaurant was short-staffed. He was almost overly polite and eager. He put out dishes in under 2 minutes, flat. The best thing you can do is let him pick your meal."], ["Joann M.", "My favorite childhood restaurant!

It might not be the place to chat with future in-laws, but it is a cozy place to catch up with friends.5.

Typical foods in Cantonese cuisine include dim sum & fresh meats/veggies stir-fried in light, fragrant sauces. A significant staple is rice, as it is a major crop grown in that region.Over the years, we've taken a liking to a small Chinese restaurant named Dew Drop Inn in Makiki that's been in that same location since 1988. \u00a0What a cute name for a restaurant! It specializes in Taiwanese & Northern Chinese cuisine. Taiwanese cuisine is a variation of the Fujianese style of Chinese cooking which includes shellfish, fish, water plants, oil, vinegar, sugar, sweet bean paste, bean curd, & rice ale; many vegetarian dishes & soups have evolved in Taiwan due to the long tradition of Buddhism in the area. Northern Chinese cuisine is influenced by the lack of sufficient water in the region, so rice is not easily grown; instead, people there have adapted to making their own noodles, dumplings, & bread-based foods. yelp.com/biz_photos/dew-\u2026 We enjoy their tasty dishes, which are a change to the normal Cantonese dishes that we've been accustomed to. Colorful picture menu is useful when ordering. Dishes are made to order & are always served piping hot. We've enjoyed the following: - Chicken & chive dumplings (shui jiao). Fillings are wrapped in perfectly textured pi (not too thick, not too thin). Served hot & dipped into a fresh ginger/garlic/vinegar sauce. Delicious! yelp.com/biz_photos/dew-\u2026 - Spicy sauce won tons w/ shrimp or pork. Soft won tons served in a delightful seasoned spicy garlic sauce. The sauce is so flavorful that you want to use it for anything else you can dip it in, including rice. yelp.com/biz_photos/dew-\u2026 - Hot sour soup. The soup has tofu, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, fungus, Chinese parsley (no meats). It is spicy, peppery, & vinegary w/ a flavorful bold taste. yelp.com/biz_photos/dew-\u2026 - Orange chicken. Lightly breaded/fried, slightly crisp chunks of chicken served in a tangy sweet sour sauce w/ an orangey flavor. Yes, a winner & absolutely better than Panda Express! yelp.com/biz_photos/dew-\u2026 - Stir-fried mochi slices w/ chicken.

The sesame pockets were very soft and flavorful, and the serving of pork&tofu was probably about a cup and half, which I thought was filling.

And in Heidi, I trust.This little gem is snuggled in a very old \"yellowish\" square building directly across of Goodwill on South Beretania. It shares space with an Asian Antique store (never seen it open) and a Hair Salon (never seen it open).Dew Drop Inn has a very vintage feel about it. Like time warp back to 1930's Hawaii. I close my eyes and I easily dream of Anna Mae Wong in Shanghai Express. It's that vintage! The sign alone screams 5-stars!I'm in love with Dew Drop Inn and here's 8 \"lucky Chinese\" more reasons why...8. The location. Away from the hustle & bustle of downtown Honolulu. Away from the tourist areas like Ala Moana & Waikiki.7. The ambiance. Very charming! Even romantic in a \"Shanghai Express\" sort of way. Lots of Asian \"funky arts\" decoration and a tiny guppy fish tank too!6. The cook (owner). He's kinda mean, but in a old Chinese Uncle sort of way. Whatever. He cooks REAL Chinese!5. The cooks #2 son. He's the hostess/waiter/busboy. Very nice guy. We talk story when I drop by, but no we don't always talk about Chinese stuff. We talk fashion too, since we both wear tight black AX t-shirts.4. The sign. Yes, the OLD WOODEN SIGN hanging just under the awning! It's so vintage and screams come... Come inside & eat!3. Taiwanese cuisine. Something about true Taiwanese dishes... So fresh, creative, and easy on the eyes. My Cantonese ex-girlfriend, once said Taiwanese cooks are snooty, but know how to cook! More on her later on a Chinatown, SF review (TBA).2. The \"picture-book\" menu is fantabulous!So you know what Jellyfish looks like if you do decide to go the REAL route. Or, bird nest. Or, my non-real Chinese favs Sweet & Sour and Orange anything!And the number one REAL reason...1. Chinese food is dang good here! I'm sure even Anna Mae Wong would approve too! *drools*Ok, I've been saving my 150th review for a special place! Dew Drop Inn is my not so secret place I love to dine-at. Yes, I've been coming here at least 10 years now, but for some odd reason maybe only once a year. One of those places you don't want to share, but being a decent human being, it's my civic duty to do so. It's probably not for everyone if you're more into the FAKE Panda Express plates, but if you appreciate REAL Chinese and your taste buds scream Taiwanese.... Go here! Trust.TIPS:\"#1 Son\" says we have a small parking lot on the side. \"#2 Son\" says papa getting old, but we now have a second cook that cooks almost as good as papa. \"#3 Son\" says yes we have odd hours.

The orange chicken was perfect, not covered in an overly syrupy, sugar sauce. The orange flavor was perfect, and the chicken was not too heavily battered. Beef and broccoli was boyfriends favorite dish, it was probably the snap peas that did him in. Xiao long bao was not the best ever, but the juice was inside the dumplings where it belongs and the meat stuffing was sooo good. Definitely will order again.

What? Didn't the sign say \"Northern Chinese\"?! \u00a0Oh, I bypassed the history lesson to my husband as we perused the menu of Korean/Chinese food. \u00a0We are and have been longtime fans of another nearby Northern Chinese restaurant so we had some basis of comparison dishes to try.THE FOOD:- Banchan: \u00a0several small plates of house made pickled turnip, kimchee and chopped raw onion with bean sauce were served. \u00a0The Napa cabbage kimchee looked fiery hot with its red chilie peppers but was surprisingly not spicy. We actually asked for a refill as our food was served because my husband insisted on ordering a bowl of steamed rice. \u00a0- Noodles with seafood and bean sauce aka Jajangmyeon: \u00a0Just as flavorful as its nearby fellow Northern Chinese restaurant with its chewy noodles. \u00a0The bean sauce was a little bit thinner or watery but nonetheless very tasty. \u00a0As far as seafood, all I could see was shrimp. The serving size is good for sharing or one very hungry noodlehead. \u00a0Ha...I DID share.- Gan Poong Chicken (Ggan pung gi) or deep fried chicken in garlic sauce: \u00a0Peking-style spicy fried chicken served with a mixture of dried or fresh chilie peppers, garlic, green onions lightly tossed in a sweet brown sauce. \u00a0The chicken was fried crisp and still retained much of that crispness even though it had been tossed into a sauce. \u00a0The boneless chicken pieces were juicy and flavorful. \u00a0My husband ate most of this dish which he claimed satisfied his penchant for fried foods.- Boiled dumplings aka mandoo: \u00a010 plump and juicy pork filled dumplings were served. \u00a0Each dumpling could've easily been two bites and its wrapper was light and translucent. \u00a0We \"wiped\" our flavorful dishes. \u00a0Service was a little slow but we expected it as this restaurant was filled with other hungry people. \u00a0One of the servers told us that this establishment has been here for 30 years and has a huge following from both the Korean and Chinese communities. \u00a0After tasting these few dishes, we can understand why and we'll be back for more.#467"], ["Es L.", "I ordered jjampong.

However the jjampong both here was flavorful and just the right amount of spice for me.The kimchee and pickled daikon are made in house and really good!

A must have accompaniment is a heaping plate of sweet and sour pork. On Dong's version is sweet without being overly saccharine.

Lol!! Food was good and it was a lot!! Looked like they renovated so it is very clean and nice inside!! Thank you On Dong for your great service and friendly hospitality!!!"], ["Andy F.", "Chinese food is great. Korean food is very good. Together? Ehhhh, maybe not. In this case, it's Korean style Northern Chinese food with Korean flavors, so....it's pretty much Korean food that's just influenced by Northern Chinese Cuisine. Yeah? Yeah. It bothers me that this restaurant has the \"Northern Chinese Cuisine\" signage on the front because it's far from it.I've never had Chinese food prepared Korean style, so I was excited to come here, and even more so from reading a few Yelp reviews. I believe I have a good understanding of Chinese flavors or else I'll have dishonored my family, and I know Korean cuisine is well-known for its fermentation of vegetables and pastes.Of course, the Jajangmyeon was seemingly highly recommended. I've had the original Chinese version, Zhajiangmian a few times, so I was expecting it to be almost alike since it uses similar ingredients and a fermented soybean paste. Umm, I don't remember it being cold, bland, fragrant-less, flavor-less, sugary-sweet. The bowl of noodles was cold as if the noodles were cooked then strained through cold water, put in a bowl, and then scooped in the room temperature jajang sauce from a pot sitting on a table. The sauce was bland as bland can be. There was no fragrance of any kind either. The fermented black bean paste is the main ingredient, and it's supposed to be fried in a pan to intensify its fragrance and brighten its flavor. What happened?? It's supposed to be salty! It's fermented for goodness sake! It tasted like Sweet Bean Paste that was scooped from a jar and mixed with water and added with tablespoons of sugar. I'll pass. Keep it for yourself. Thanks.The Sweet Sour Pork. It was $15.95, which seemed ridiculously overpriced. I had to order it from the good reviews, and I had this similar dish at Lobster King that was very good. The portion was small, but looked appetizing. And again, not what I expected. Again, this was bland. I could barely taste the sweet and the slightest hint of sour. It's never good when you find yourself forcing down bland food or always dipping it in numerous sauces. The pork had just too much batter and was fried poorly, and it ate chewy and tough.The Shrimp Fried Rice was an even smaller portion. Thank goodness this had some taste to it! Though, why is there corn and French style green beans in this? Peas look good. Boy, those carrots are diced so evenly, and the peas are so green. Wait a minute..... Hang on a second.... perfectly diced carrots? Green peas? Green beans? CORN? This couldn't be from a bag of frozen mixed vegetables, could it? Sadly, this was obviously the case, as the rice was very mushy from the water from the frozen vegetables. There was zero wok heat, so it didn't even feel like a fried rice. Just stick with Korean food, thanks.For the banchan, there was only kim chee, raw sweet onion with the black bean paste, and pickled daikon. This was probably the best part of this meal. The kim chee was good, as it should be. The pickled daikon was good with a nice level of flavor. I enjoyed the raw onion with the black bean paste because the paste actually had flavor.The service was okay. One server was awful, while the other was nice. We just sat down and one of the servers wanted to take our order after thirty seconds. Okay? A bit more time, please? Thanks. She came back less than a minute. -_- Then she got lost her patience and said, \"Just wave when you're ready.\" When we were ready and tried to get her attention, she just stayed busy doing this and that without ever looking our way. Finally the other server came over and took our order and then brought our banchan. The food came out somewhat slow, but the nicer server was very attentive and friendly.This place is pretty small with a pay-to-park lot in the back you can enter from Kaheka. The d\u00e9cor feels very old-fashioned with the booth seating and the style of tables and the plates and bowls.Overall, I did not enjoy this place one bit. I tried the popular dishes, and they both failed miserably. At the end of the day, it's Korean food. It's not even close to Northern Chinese cuisine. If you took the hamburger, and replaced the beef patty with a steamed pork patty with water chestnuts and preserved cabbage and a salted egg on top served in a sesame hamburger bun, would you still call it \"American Cuisine?\"I may have a solution though. There's Americanized and Localized Chinese cuisine here that do well. Chop Suey, everywhere! Now we have this Koreanized Chinese cuisine here at On Dong that's not so well. Take a page from those other restaurants and Lobster King especially who do make decent Koreanized Chinese dishes, and hire Chinese chefs. I feel they'll be better at cooking \"Northern Chinese Cuisine,\" right? Plus, isn't that how it went? Northern Chinese people emigrated from China and into Korea, lived in a certain area, and then developed pseudo-version of Chinese food to assimilate to Korean tastes?"], ["Grace L.", "Three words: black bean noodles.Hollaaaa if you like jajangmyun because this is where it's at. \u00a0There are two places on the island that we frequent for black bean noodles and it's On Dong and Eastern Paradise. \u00a0For those of you that don't know, this isn't a standard \"Chinese\" cuisine type restaurant. \u00a0It's actually Koreanized (I made this word up but please bear with me). \u00a0This dish originated in China but it was eventually brought over to Korea where the dish has been altered and adapted to Korean palates. \u00a0On Dong caters to the Koreanized version of black bean noodles. \u00a0I guess you can call it like a Korean-Chinese hybrid.The black bean noodles here are probably the best on the island. \u00a0I definitely prefer the noodles here in comparison to Eastern Paradise. \u00a0The noodles are the right consistency and the sauce is perfectly seasoned. \u00a0My mom usually gets the double portion and I just eat some of hers.A great appetizer to order is the sweet and sour pork. \u00a0I think you can choose beef as an option too but trust me when I say to choose pork. \u00a0Pork wins hands down. \u00a0The sauce is nice and thick, it's \"sweet and sour\" without being overly sweet nor sour. \u00a0It also comes with lots of veggies and these really awesome black stringy mushroom type things.The jjamppong is also pretty good. \u00a0It's a spicy seafood noodle soup. \u00a0Most people will order this or the jajangmyun. \u00a0Just keep in mind that it is pretty spicy and if you're not big on spicy then stick to what you know.There is lots of free parking available in the back and a few street parking stalls in front. \u00a0If you want to try some black bean noodles, I definitely recommend On Dong. \u00a0The main reason I deducted 1 star is because it can be a little on the pricey side depending on what you order."], ["Ashley I.", "I cannot wait to come back!

Some people swear by mac and cheese, others live and die by mom's spaghetti. But for me, and I'm pretty sure a lot of other Koreans around the world, nothing says \"Everything's gonna be ok\" like jjajangmyun (black bean noodles) and tangsuyuk (sweet and sour beef or pork). It's like the Asian peanut butter and jelly. Ok...maybe not really to the same extent, but at least in my opinion it's impossible to get one without the other. And no matter how old I get, give me an order of these two dishes and I'm little kid again. And if you were to look at my shirt and face after a bowl of jjajangmyun, you wouldn't doubt it for a second because it is scientifically impossible to not splash black bean sauce everywhere. One of these days though I'll figure out the secret. One day.And when it comes to jjajangmyun and tangsuyuk in Hawaii, it doesn't get much better than On Dong. I've been coming here forever and it's always been somewhere I've looked forward to going. They're located across the street from Sanders Piano on King Street, with a parking lot in the back you enter in via Kaheka St. I have many, many memories of waking through the kitchen into the restaurant from the parking lot, and just being captivated with the woks and huge boiling pots going. The dining area isn't too large, but there's usually a booth or two you'll be able to find a seat in. The service is pleasant and I've yet to have a problem with any order, and this going back years.But enough about my nostalgia and other things. Let's talk about that jjajangyun and tangsuyuk. The noodles are cooked on point and with that great chew and texture you look for from any noodle or pasta dish. The jjajang sauce, although generally salty no matter where you go, is not overwhelmingly so at On Dong. And whereas some jjajangmyun places rely on a more watery sauce, the jjajang here clings nicely to the noodles, so you get that perfect sauce to noodle ratio each bit. The tangusyuk matches the salty jjajangmyun by giving that sweet and savory flavor profile to the meal. And did I forget to mention that the meat is prepared in a way that it's crispy and then covered in the sweet and sour sauce? But yeah, that contrast in texture the tangsuyuk provides, in addition to the flavor components, make for a perfect accompaniment to the noodles. The protein of your choice, beef or pork, is served with a variety of vegetables as well, which give for a nice splash of color and a little extra flavor.You'll honestly never hear me turn down an opportunity to eat these two dishes. As simple and common as they are, they could quite possibly be my favorite meal combination in the world. Don't hold me to that statement, but in general I'll always be happy with jjajangmyun and tangsuyuk. And until another place pops up that makes me reconsider my opinion, I'll keep on coming back to On Dong to get my comfort food fix."], ["Sharon H.", "So glad I made this return visit because when a restaurant's customer service exceeds expectation, it's something to yelp about!On this occasion, my Korean foodie expert and I ordered the black bean noodles and spicy garlic fried chicken for our late Saturday afternoon lunch.

Chewy but tender. Able to soak up sauce but retain their own flavor. I also dream of black bean sauce. That last bit is a little bit harder to explain. So why not combine them in one reality? The reality of jajungmyun.Luckily Tze M. was willing to go on a major food adventure with me. We made our way over on a lazy Sunday afternoon and were lucky enough to score parking right in front. Just a heads up, the restaurant is basically on the King-Kaheka intersection, so once you turn onto King off Keeamoku start looking for parking, it will be on the right hand side of the street. It's a small sign and easy to miss, it is just before the Panda Express.We had to wait a little bit to get anyone's attention and the restaurant was pretty packed. We ordered two bowls of black bean noodles, regular, and sweet and sour pork. Apparently you can get the black bean noodles either regular (with pork) or with seafood. The service was pretty decent, not the greatest, but pretty standard for a legit Asian restaurant. Tea and kimchee and sliced onions with a black bean puree were immediately brought to the table.The jajungmyun is pretty good, but was a little on the blander side than I was expecting based off the puree that came with the banchan. There wasn't a whole lot of meat in the sauce, in fact I was pretty sure that it was just the fresh noodles, some cabbage, and the black bean sauce. Even then it was really satisfying and delicious. We told ama that this was our first time, so our noodles came out already covered in sauce, not in two separate bowls. The sweet and sour pork was good, but I wasn't in love with it. It was done really well and wasn't overly battered. It just wasn't something I was in love with. Our total bill came out to $31, half of that was the sweet and sour pork. So really, if you just swang by for a bowl of jajungmyun for lunch it would be pretty affordable meal. Definitely will be back, maybe next time to try the spicy red soup with noodles and the chives mixed with pork."], ["Grace H.", "I've been coming to On Dong for their JJM ever since I can remember. It's been a while since my most recent visit during lunch and I was pleasantly surprised to see so many locals there! I'm glad that even local people can enjoy this eclectic yet oh-so-tasty and somewhat messy bowl of noodles in a mysterious black sauce.Depending on my mood, I usually order the JJM or the cham pong (a spicy noodle dish with seafood) and an appetizer usually the spicy chicken dish called kkam pong gi or the sweet and sour BEEF.

I mean to each their own, but personally I hate when my noodles are drenched in sauce. The noodles were cooked perfectly but I felt that sauce lacked something. It did help to put a little bit of the black paste they serve you in the noodles but honestly, who wants to put a whole chunk of black paste in a bowl of noodles. And I'm not even sure thats what its supposed to be used for since they served it to us with a bowl of raw onions. Would I come back here again? Maybe.

We got the jja jang myun (which is spelled zha jang men or one of the other million ways its spelled everywhere else) and the sweet sour pork.

I took one bite and i thought i died and went to Manapua Heaven. The Baked manapua was so soft and airy it didn't taste like a baked manapua but the lady told me they use hawaiian sweet bread which makes it so light. It was like biting into a freshly baked dinner roll, it was just OH MY GOD....BAKED CHARSIU MANAPUA: A must order yelpies, not your traditional baked manapua but simply outstanding..BAKED KALUA PIG MANAPUA: A little diappointed in this one but to each his own. It's just hard to like something else after you eat the Baked Charsiu Manapua..PORK HASH: It was very good as well but i think Char sung Hut and Libby's are just as good if not better..ROAST PORK: Love the roast pork here. Crunchy Skin always gets to me and they have a nice Crunchy Roast Pork here..CHOW MEIN: This was just as good too..BAKED HOT DOG MANAPUA: Can't go wrong with this one too. That Soft Bun with the Rat Dog, oops, i mean the Hot Dog was delicious..OVERALL: What really captivated me is that i have been in the service industry for 23 years now. The service from this one particular lady just made me feel like i was king for a day. She was so sweet and never tried to rush me as if i knew her for years. I even tried to give her a tip and she refused. She just told me to come here more often and that just sealed the deal for me.

sitting on that same stony ledge all grown up in tailored suitjacket and trousers, sharing the same baked Manapua out of a small brown paper bag; remembering what the world was like in a different, simpler time before life became a terribly complicated thing -- and for just a few minutes letting myself be that kid growing up in Chinatown again, enjoying the simple love of warm, freshly baked bread opening up to steaming hot roasted shredded Char Siu pork.There is something unquantifiable about freshly baked Manapua from Royal Kitchen -- there's a kind of temporal fleetingness that, almost like the steam that wisps away when you tear open a freshly baked Manapua, wisps away just the same way in increasing orders of magnitude the more time that passes between oven and mouth. \u00a0These Manapua are best enjoyed pulled from a fresh tray right out of the oven, dropped into a paper bag and eaten on-the-spot -- as anyone who has ever eaten bread freshly pulled from the oven can tell you, there is no other experience like it. \u00a0Here's what you need to know about Royal Kitchen:FOOD:Royal Kitchen specializes in Baked Manapua. \u00a0These are yeast bread buns that are slightly sweet, thin-shelled and airy soft, surrounding a filling that is traditionally Char Siu, which is a red-colored traditional Chinese Roasted Pork Loin, chopped up into small bits. \u00a0The Char Siu Bao (Manapua) is their most popular by far, and they bake fresh every few hours. \u00a0Think of them as round, semi-spherical Piroshky (anthropological records show a migration from China through Russia as an ancestral basis for European Piroshky). \u00a0Fillings include (made less frequently through the day) in my descending order of preference and recommendation:Great: \u00a0Char Siu, Kalua Pork, Portuguese Sausage, Lup Cheong Pretty Good: \u00a0Curry Chicken, Chicken, Vegetarian, Hot Dog, Black SugarMeh: \u00a0Okinawan Sweet Potato, Coconut, Ma Tai SuRoyal Kitchen also offers various Chinese roast meats and a few \"plate\" options.PARKING:There are two lots you can park in, both paid. \u00a0The first one is on North Kukui and is on the ground floor of a building. \u00a0This lot is closer to Royal Kitchen and has a 30 minute grace period. \u00a0The second lot is the Cultural Plaza parking structure with 8 floors off of Maunakea. \u00a0If you are staying longer than 30 minutes, this is the better lot to use. \u00a0Be warned though, at lunch time this lot (structure) fills up quick and it takes a while to get in and out. \u00a0There is also street parking nearby.ORDERING/ SEATING: \u00a0There's usually a mob of people waiting inside, overflowing outside. \u00a0Take a number, wait for them to call it. \u00a0While you're waiting, take a look inside the Manapua case on the right side of the counter, and get an idea of what they have. \u00a0The Manapua will be marked with a red mark of some sort on top of it (except the standard Char Siu, which will be unmarked - see photo), indicating what the fillings are. \u00a0Before you start ordering, tell them how many you want total so they know whether to get you a box, a take-out styrofoam case, or a paper bag. \u00a0When you're done, go to the register at the far left and pay there. \u00a0No seating inside. \u00a0There are some tables and benches outside.SERVICE: \u00a0Minimal. \u00a0They take your order, you pay. \u00a0Move along. \u00a0They understand English just fine even though some of them speak with a heavy accent.ATMOSPHERE:Tiny, oldschool Chinatown. \u00a0Manapua case to the far right. \u00a0A selection of local style Chinese foods in steam trays line the center of the counter, with a case of roast pork, Char Siu loins and roast duck and chicken hang in the case to the far left next to the register. \u00a0COST/ VALUE: \u00a0Extremely good. \u00a0Each Manapua as of 17 May 2012 costs $1.20 and it only takes about 3-4 to fill up an average sized person.VERDICT:5/5 - When it comes to Manapua, there really is none better, period. \u00a0I have not had better anywhere, be it NYC, San Francisco, Honolulu, Taipei, Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong or anywhere in between. \u00a0I've had better Char Siu Bao, but none with quite the same soulful satisfaction that comes with a touch to the heart of a young, innocent Chinatown kid buried somewhere underneath the hardened exterior of the man I have become in my years. \u00a0It's Manapua like this that makes you realize that your suit from London, your tie from Paris, your watch from Geneva and your car from Stuttgart mean nothing, and that the best things in life sometimes come $1.20 at a time from a tiny shop in the run down neighborhood you grew up in."], ["Anna F.", "I love the baked char siu manapua (bao/bun).

Nice size, not too oily and well seasoned. This usually disappears first on our table.The kalua manapua is a little too salty and what is that? Liquid smoke? If it is, go easy. I mean, sheesh! The meat is a tightly hand packed ball of kalua pig. You bite into the manapua and you get all bun in one bite and then a huge chunk of salty kalua in another.The half moons are not bad. Moist and nice size. I have a hard time eating those ever since I watched Three Extremes. \"Dumplings\" have changed my mentality towards half moons. My favorites from here are the hot dog and lup cheong buns. I wish they would put \u00a0A WHOLE hot dog or lup cheong inside.

They have cool fillings like black sugar, sweet potato, usually char siu, veggies, etc. The manapuas are about the size of a fist. My only complaint about them is they're really airy... Sometimes i'll bite into one and there will be a solid inch and a half between the thin outer bread and filling... I typically like my manapuas heartier, with the filling baked tight and full. It's a dirty hole in the wall, so don't expect cleanliness. It's seriously a tiny place along side the canal. When it's busy you take a number and they will call it out.

It's an excellent deal. The place was packed with a long wait time. We had reservations for when they opened so we didn't have to wait that long.I shared a table with Nadine C., Traci R. and Jennifer S. We're the table that had the mild broth since none of us like spicy. They want you to cook and eat your food before you order some more. The first round of orders, you get 3 choices. After that, you get 2 choices. You have an hour and a half to order. They had everything from beef, pork, chicken, vegetables, noodles and seafood. I wasn't expecting seafood because of the price, but it was on the menu. I ordered a whole bunch of shrimp because that's my favorite and it was fresh. I also got the calamari and cuttlefish balls. The beef and pork belly were also good. The one thing that wasn't good was the corn on the cob. I took one bite and spat it out. I knew it was rotten. Yuck!They also have a sauce table for your dipping needs. My favorite sauce was the sesame. The garlic sauce and sa cha sauce wasn't bad either."], ["Paul C.", "It's been soooooo HOT and HUMID this summer. \u00a0I mean, unbearably HOT HOT HOT. \u00a0One would think about eating cold SOMEN noodles or cold soft tofu but why on earth would I venture here on yet another HOT and HUMID Tuesday? \u00a0AYCE Dinner at Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot with a bunch of friends.Yes, I'm a social eater. \u00a0I don't care to dine by myself. \u00a0Since I started to Yelp I've met many cool Yeeps. \u00a0I usually tend to organize dinners and gatherings but when a fellow Yeep texted me asking if I wanted to partake in the second week of AYCE (all-you-can-eat) at Little Sheep for $23.95 per person I jumped on board and that friend made reservations for us.Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot is a chain of restaurants here in the USA and internationally. \u00a0Several years ago I dined at their San Gabriel, CA with my SoCal Ohana and also was selected to last year's Elite event here. \u00a0To be frank I'm not a big fan of hot pot / shabu shabu but do enjoy eating with friends. \u00a0Reservations were set at their initial seating at 530pm. \u00a0Upon arrival the restaurant was CHAOTIC at the hostess stand. \u00a0CHAOTIC can pretty much sum up my dinner experience here. \u00a0I'd say more than 75% of the diners that night were Chinese (including myself) and in our culture can be very rude by ignoring other diners who are standing in line. \u00a0Service this night was also CHAOTIC. \u00a0We had several waiters (the ones with wireless earphones) that night and many, many wait staff. \u00a0Our waiter asked which broth we wanted between regular and spicy. \u00a0In our group we had a handful of newbies of Little Sheep so we opted for split broths. \u00a0Each table had a plate of veggie starters (seasoned KONBU sea kelp and Mongolian kim chee cabbage) for us to munch on before the food arrived. \u00a0As part of the AYCE dining rules each person may order up to 3 items the first round and once consumed from round 2 you may each order 2 items here forth. \u00a0Here is where the confusion was - - our table of 12 had 3 hot pots where each table ordered differently. \u00a0Our waiters became confused with who ordered what. \u00a0When the wait staff dropped off plates of food we were given wrong plates of food as well as given the wrong order sheets as our table was designated with a RED pen when selecting food items. \u00a0There was a long turnaround time for us to get the plates of food we ordered. \u00a0For the whole evening we kept on having to flag down waiters and wait staff. \u00a0The restaurant was PACKED. \u00a0I mean FULL HOUSE with diners and with AYCE on its second week the restaurant staff need to resolve this issue.Onto the food, it was not bad. \u00a0I'm not a fan of boiled meats dipped in various sauces so I guess it was okay. \u00a0But I was impressed with the large list of food items to choose from. \u00a0My favorite of the night was beef tendon. \u00a0Sooooo gelatinous. \u00a0We sat near the sauce bar and it was also CHAOTIC. \u00a0There were many Chinese patrons who would ignore the line and went from the other side, hence taking a long time to custom make your dipping sauces. \u00a0Regarding the flavors, they did have a large selection to choose from but I was disappointed I didn't see any chopped Chinese parsley. \u00a0Furthermore, the sauce station was messy as patrons would spill here and there, and I even witnessed this Chinese lady drop her whole dipping dish into the sesame sauce as while she was busy talking with her friends. \u00a0You have 90-minutes to order food and that was ample time to order, cook and eat. \u00a0It was so HOT and CHAOTIC the whole night. \u00a0I was surprised when I found out it was cooler in the restroom than in the dining area! \u00a0I also noticed several members of our table had beads of sweat on their faces. \u00a0And when I came last year for the Elite event I was pleased the same manager was still working there. \u00a0I was also impressed to see him work the tables as he walked back-and-forth which explained why his shirt was soaking wet. \u00a0Great to see a manager help out when the restaurant is rocking.Overall, a great dining experience when it comes to communal dining but personally there are issues the restaurant needs to resolve to alleviate the CHAOS we experienced during my meal here.NOTES: \u00a01) Literal Chinese translation of LSM is \"LITTLE FAT SHEEP\" - - I used to enjoy OXYMORONS when I was growing up.2) Highly advisable for you to check your bill carefully. \u00a0Our bills were divided by tables of 4 and for our check I noticed they AUTOMATICALLY added gratuity into the total.3) Reservations highly recommended if you have a group of at least 6.4) Don't dress up to eat here as you'll be walking out having your clothes smell like the restaurant. \u00a0 :P"], ["Nadine C.", "All You Can Eat (AYCE) dinner on Tuesdays began at this location on 8-25-15. \u00a0Twelve of us jumped on the band wagon and had a fun adventure... \u00a0We had 3 tables with 4 people sharing one pot of broth per table, so 12 was a perfect number!Our good friend messaged a bunch of us and we answered the call. \u00a0Some of us were new to this restaurant and others had been here before. \u00a0We divided ourselves in 2 main groups: Spicy and Plain eaters. \u00a0My \"plain\" table of 4 gals had a big pot to cook our meat and veggies. \u00a0One gal (the Duchess of Asuka Nabe) had been here before, so she was very helpful in ordering from the form on the clipboard. \u00a0The form is good for up to 3 rounds of orders, but you can add more rounds if you like. \u00a0The \"spicy people\" had divided pots with half spicy broth and half original broth. \u00a0For the first round, each person gets to order 3 menu items (example: quail eggs, shrimp balls, and udon noodles). \u00a0On the 2nd and 3rd rounds, each person can order 2 menu items (example: pork belly, tofu, and pork dumplings). \u00a0After ordering, we followed the experienced diners to the Sauce Bar - there were so many flavors to choose from - ponzu, House Sesame, Chili, Garlic, etc. \u00a0Just fill a little bowl with whatever you want to try and come back for more! \u00a0We appreciated the 4 slotted ladles and 4 tongs - one set for each person! \u00a0The frequent refills of water and ice cubes were great! \u00a0Yes - it's the middle of summer in Hawaii and we're consuming steaming, boiling Hot Pot! \u00a0Go figure!Service was a bit lacking, as we had to wave down the servers to order the next round and to check up on the missing food that we did order. \u00a0We were a bit stressed because of the 90 minute cooking limit. \u00a0Most of the food must be out of the pot and on your plate before ordering the next round. \u00a0We were able to stay later (after the 90 minutes) and continue eating and chatting.At first, they had some difficulty separating our bill. \u00a0Eventually, they got it so that 3 of us could use our credit cards! \u00a0Yay for Mileage Points!It's a really fun cooking and dining experience, but we wouldn't be able to do it every week - our Food Babies would be REALLY showing! \u00a0Some of us did the Stand Up exercise so our tummies could drop a little and let our lungs expand...

The restaurant itself is HUGE, clean, and cool(air temperature-wise). For a hotpot place to be all these three things in Hawaii is what will keep me coming back. Along with decent prices, a sauce bar, and delicious drinks, who can go wrong!?If you come to Little Sheep, give the Winter Melon Tea a try. Though a little on the pricier side of drinks, it's worth it. Tastes exactly like the milk tea we all have come to love, just no dairy!The broths are limited (two choices- original and/or spicy), but delicious nonetheless. My family is a little less adventurous when it comes to eating the berries, spices, or spicy peppers in the soup, but it's easy to put to the side on a plate, thanks to the many ladles that hang onto the side of the pot!The only reason for the 4/5 rating is because sometimes, the waiter would forget about us after out food was delivered for us to cook. We didn't know how to turn down the hotplate, so by the end it became a chance for us to do yakiniku too, hah! They are generous with soups though. If you are running low on soup, they will refill it for you.Will definitely be back, in need of more enoki mushrooms!"], ["Niki N.", "This place deserves more than just 5 stars....seriously. We took advantage of the all-you-can-eat special that they have on Tuesdays ONLY. The only thing is that you have to go right when they open or else you'll have to wait over an hour for a table. They do give you a time limit of 90 minutes, which is a fairly long time for dinner. Inside was much bigger than I thought and accommodated more people than expected. Since we arrived a little before they opened at 5:30, we got seated right away. The way the all-you-can-eat works is different from a regular hot pot restaurant. First, you choose your broth. You can either get the spicy, house, or both. We decided to get both just to try it out. Second, the food is separated into 4 rounds. For the first round they allow each person to choose three items from the menu so there are total of six items for the first round. And let me tell you...that was a lot of food. For the second round, they limit the number of items to two per person, so four total items. However, they will only allow you to get more food if you have eaten majority of the food from the first round. Smart. The portions aren't any smaller so be careful what you order. I wouldn't recommend getting anything too heavy because you'll end up getting full fast. And for the rice, we only ordered one instead of two and just shared between two of us. Also, when we got there it was happy hour so we also got a pitcher of beer for $8. Deal! They also have a sauce bar and a posted sign with pairings of the sauces that go well with meat, seafood and vegetables. Compared to other hot pot restaurants that I've been to, this one has got to be one of the top places to go to specifically because of their all-on-can-eat special. I would like them to have a \u00a0little more variety of broth but they did have a wide variety of vegetables, meat, seafood, and noodles that made up for it."], ["Liza M.", "Another hot pot restaurant to add to my list of hot pot spots. This is my first time dining at this restaurant. I've been to Nabeya Maido, Shabu Shabu house, Asuka Nabe, Ichiriki, Sweet home cafe, and Hot pot Heaven, the interior of the restaurant makes you feel like you are in a modern restaurant like Ichiriki. Sleek and dark furniture was appealing for me.For our group of 6, we made reservations ahead so we didn't have to wait like other parties. There were so many people coming in and out of the restaurant. The menu is straight forward and breaks down how to order. But it was shame that there were no prices on the menu. Instead they have you write down how many per item you want to order on a separate sheet of paper, especially for the meat and vegetables, half or full plate you must indicate. The staff should change that and put the prices on the menu. It was confusing how much of group was going to order since many of us haven't been here. It didn't help that the staff were FOBs with heavy Chinese or Taiwanese accents and talked very fast that we couldn't understand what most of them were saying. All we heard were meat and asking if we prefer meat over vegetables lol. We nodded that we got what our server was saying. This restaurant is a franchise and has locations in the West and East Coast as well as China, Canada, and Japan. This is the first location in Hawaii.The dipping sauce station was alright. They didn't have ponzu sauce available which was disappointing. After 5 mins waiting and standing there blankly, one of the workers brought over another container of ponzu. Most of the people were coming to get ponzu sauce, most popular sauce used at any hot pot restaurants. I like that the meat was sliced thinly than some of the other hot pot restaurants. It is easier to eat while indulging with vegetables and rice. BTW, the rice is extra, cost $2.50 and meat cost $6 to 11 per order. Our group ordered two half and half broths, but it was a mistake. Our mouths were on fire from the spicy broth. That broth was soaked with hot red peppers. Later on as we were finishing up our dinner, I was fishing through the sea of hot peppers, removing and checking if there were any more meat or vegetables left. Good thing the scooping spoons had a holder to prevent the spoons from falling into the broth :) I laughed at my bf as he was guessing what the final bill for all the meat, vegetables, beer and iced teas our group ordered. He thought it was $80, but he was so off. The final bill came out over $148 for party of 6. I'm so glad we didn't order more food or the bill wouldn't been higher. Happy that the server offered water several times during our entire dining time, not like the other yelpers who mentioned that they only got 1 refill of water once during their time. I would try this place again, maybe during the lunch hour. I heard about their lunch special, so I am curious how good it is according to some foodie reviewers."], ["Frank A.", "Little Sheep Mongolian Hotpot:Can you say \"All You Can Eat Crazy Tuesday?\" LOLThis establishment is located in the Ward Center, Third Floor on the diamondhead side of Ryan's Bar and Grill. \u00a0Ample parking in the Ward Center or adjoining Ward shops across the street.The restaurant opens at 5:30, and there are already crowds of people waiting outside beforehand. \u00a0Reservations are recommended on \"Crazy Tuesday\"!

Sauce is just as important as the veggies and meat this place provides because it adds to the taste of your meal. \u00a0They have a variety of soy or sesame sauce and lots of cilantro (parsley) and garlic. \u00a0If it's your first time then just take a little bit of sauce before you go all out and pile it on. \u00a0(Don't be wasteful, be mindful of what you take)The staff takes care of turning the electric burner on and they walk by often enough to monitor if the heat needs to be reduced from time to time. \u00a0I believe this was one of the better hot pots I've had in a while. \u00a0And I've been to a number of them like most of us who like in town. \u00a0Ambiance is great, it's clean and they open space allows you to enjoy your meal without having to worry if you're in the way of someone else. \u00a0BUT, don't expect stellar service and once you get over that you'll be fine. \u00a0Dip and boil away my friends. \u00a0I'm going back for more. :-)"], ["Mel H.", "This place is getting three stars only for the refreshingly different taste. \u00a0That being said, this place is.. well.. different than most hot pot places you find around Hawaii. \u00a0My girlfriend and I are hot pot fiends, so we enjoyed feasting at a new spot, but we were a bit disappointed with the service.The good: \u00a0 This place originally caught our eye when we were just walking by. Super sleek, new looking. \u00a0It's attractive and well lit. \u00a0 The broths are very flavorful and give all of your add ons a great kick. \u00a0 I'm a spicy food freak so I really enjoyed seeing the surface of our pot literally covered with chilis. \u00a0You get a decent amount of food, and there is a massive, like really massive selection of meats and veggies, some of which are uncommon at other placesThe bad: \u00a0 The service. \u00a0After being sat, we stared at our menus and the foreign ordering slip and waited a decent amount of time before anyone approached us.

I went with a bunch of awesome people (they know who they are)! Some had come here previously and others were like me, new and inexperienced! Here's a jist of what goes down: 1. Come early (5:30pm doors open) on Tuesdays for buffet. People are rude and will push you to get to the front. 2. Choose your broth (original or spicy). Spicy has peppers everywhere. 3. Have a game plan. 90 minutes of cook time and that's IT! (was enough time for us)4. Only allowed to order 3 items per person on Round 1. 2 items on Round 2, etc. unlimited rounds after that but you can only order 1 item per round. (Provided on a clipboard and you check off items. Can duplicate items.)5. House sesame, ponzu, some fish paste, chili oil, with minced garlic are available as sauces and located in the center of the restaurant. 6. Total: $23.95 plus tax & tip. Why the 3 stars? 1. Service was subpar. We just called out to any worker who would give us our clipboard to order. Items came out relatively slowly. :( 2. Original broth was really bland despite how tasty it looks. I drenched my food in sauces. 3. You can only order 3 items on Round 1. I like having variety: cabbage, meat, noodles, seafood, etc. all ready to cook at the same time. I had to settle to eat meat and cabbage, first. Then wait for the next round to get everything else. 4. A lot of items we ordered came frozen (udon, corn, dumplings, etc.) Not to mention that apparently our corn was spoiled. :(5. The sauce area is messy and would have preferred having individual containers at each table. People were spilling into other sauces. 6. Some people noticed how hot the restaurant was. I didn't feel too hot but then again, I decided to show up in workout clothes (don't worry, I hadn't worked out in them yet) since I knew it would be as hot as a sauna! Biggest plus: your bill doesn't magically increase. Somehow I can manage to spend $30 at Sweet Home Cafe/Hot Pot Heaven even when I don't realize it. For that, I am grateful. :) Let me just say that although I didn't personally like what Little Sheep had to offer, I can see this being a great deal for others! Would I come back?

Free, structured parking beats street parking any day! Despite the mediocre food and service, I still had a blast cooking and eating!

Don't be intimidated by the red color or floating peppers. This place is very spacious and includes a sauce bar! What is also refreshing is the watermelon juice. Yum! I love that stuff. It's a great way to cool off from the soup and if you're soup is too spicy. Due to the nature of this restaurant, wait times can be a bit high since you cook your own food and are drinking hot soup. Can't really finish in like 15 minutes. Parking is located in the ward parking structure. Little sheep is located next to the mexican restaurant down from Ryan's."], ["Kanani C.", "**0 stars**Me and the gf came here for dinner, got seated at 8:30 on a Friday. Wrote our order down and turned it in 8:35. Nobody came by, and 2 other tables that came after us (one even came 10 minutes before this) got their food. Table next to us complained about not even having the stove turned on.So I asked for a manager, none came by. Went to the bar asked again, just asked if I \"had a question\" no manager or anybody showed any interest. proceeded to walk out at 9:30... And we still hungry :-("], ["Nate A.", "This was a spontaneous adventure after the movies with my friend. It was also my first time here and had no clue that it was in Ward. We had to check in with a name and there is also an option to put your phone number. During the wait, the front receptionist gave us the option to order ahead by giving a list of items to order on a sheet of paper. Our wait was less than 10 minutes. Note: there are two sizes of proportions such as half and full for your sides. The half proportion were just right for two people. My friend and I got the House Original Pot, the broth (white broth that kind of resembled a paitan) was decorated with an assortment of fresh ingredients that contain goji berries, jujubes, black cardamon pods, ginseng and herbs.Unfortunately, the waiters were a bit off because initially we had a lady that took our order and shortly after another waiter was trying to take our order but we told her that another lady took our initial order after sitting us down. Also, we had to get their attention for water and an add on for a bowl of rice.I also got the Green Apple Green Tea and it was delish. One of my favorite parts of this was the dipping sauce, I got the garlic sweet ginger sauce (i might of forgot the name but that sauce was broke-da-mouth).I got a free steaming facial. Seriously. No matter where I moved within my seat, the steam kept following me. My face and pores were thanking me but I needed a chance to breathe. LOL.For a table of two our bill was less than $50. I would call this outing a success. Everything was amazing and delicious. Again, I have to rave about the dipping sauce. Go get it! Overall: a great place with friends to dine for dinner, plan ahead, reasonable prices"], ["Becky M.", "I had the opportunity to try another hot pot restaurant! The strong taste of ginger is still marinating on my togue! Little Sheep is a great place for families and large groups to go for either lunch or dinner. It's a great option because the amount of food given can feed up to 8 adults and it's pretty healthy. We came for dinner and ordered both the house original and house spicy soup bases. They have an extensive selection of meats and seafood options and the normal varieties of veggies. My only mistake was not getting noodles. Nonetheless, it tasted great! And don't forget to visit the sauce bar! Load up on your favorite sauces to spice up your meal. I usually get the ponzu sauce and make a concoction of ginger, green onion, cilantro, and soy sesame. It really brings your hot pot meal to life.I loved the modern interior of this restaurant! It feels so clean and inviting. My only gripe was that the ventilation or a/c system was turned off (or on low) when i got seated and I wondered if it was going to be like that the entire evening. Luckily the staff fixed the issue and I felt comfortable once my food arrived. I feel like good ventilation is pretty important, especially at a hot pot restaurant. Our server was very attentive and made sure all our needs were taken care of, and the hostess was super friendly and accommodated my group quickly.I recommend bringing some after dinner mints or gum in case you're having the ginger because it's potent!"], ["Megan G.", "Tried this place last night with my boyfriend. Very nice atmosphere and super spacious. We were confused on how we should order since the waiter didn't mention the chart system. My boyfriend wanted to order the Kobe beef but our waiter kept insisting that the market price was super high and kept telling us that we should get something else. Although I think he was just trying look out for us spending too much I could tell my boyfriend was disappointed. Food was good and portions are fairly large, good for eating with family. Service could have been better. We ended up getting overcharged on the bill and our wait for takeout boxes took way too long (they forgot) so we ended up leaving without what seemed like a lot of leftover food :( I really wanted to like this place but I'm not sure if the food itself is good enough to come back."], ["Jenny G.", "Came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. As a party of four, we were interested in the lunch special. Our waitress recommended three premium lunch specials - should be perfectly enough for the four of us. With that information, we got three orders of the premium lunch special with lamb! [[Each special comes with fish balls, dumpling, wonton, vegetables (Chinese cabbage, spinach, daikon), fish, shrimp, imitation crab meat, tofu, noodles, lotus root, pumpkin, mushrooms, a tiny bit of seaweed, corn, and of course course your choice of meat ($18.95).]] It's a WIDE variety of food so I really enjoyed that. We also ordered half regular and half spicy broth. (The spicy broth isn't spicy at all unless you eat a chili... And it's more flavorful!)For sauce, I mixed the house special sesame sauce with a soy garlic (??? I don't remember) and added fresh garlic and green onions. Yummy!In terms of the food itself, everyone was such high quality. The restaurant wasn't crazy busy so the atmosphere was nice and calm."], ["Stephen M.", "Very friendly staff! Clean and modern place to eat. Great selection of quality food. Probably the best hot pot place in Honolulu. :)"], ["Amber T.", "It's really funny when you enter a restaurant remembering it as the club you used to go to back in your mid twenties lol. Ahhhh Ka... Anyways it basically looks the same way, but now there are all these nice tables! Ambiance of the restaurant is very nice. When you get seated the waiter explains that you choose your broth and food. What's really helpful is that they give you a clipboard that you can just write your order down, so the waiter isn't struggling to write it. For the broth we ordered was a half n half with the original house broth and vegetarian broth, which is a nice option to have! When eating we found all these things in the broth and realized they were huge pieces of ginger and other spices that make the broth delicious! One of the tastiest broths very delicious. There are also tons of different sauces to choose from at the sauce station. And the best part is they have all the green onions, cilantro, hot peppers, and garlic that you want to add to these sauces. I really enjoyed the house sesame and garlic sauces, yummy!The meats we ordered were beef and pork belly. The beef was good, but the pork belly was disappointing. It was cut very thin, and didn't have much flavor. House lamb wontons were really good for the first pieces, and then it tasted really gamey towards the end...They should make beef wontons to kill that gamey taste. Vegetables were shitake and enoki mushrooms, tong ho, bok choy, pumpkin all which were good. The tong ho is good, but just wish they chopped it a little more because it's like a huge tree going into your broth. The yam noodles were weird on texture, I will probably never get this again.Overall a great experience, but what is very strange is that they don't put the prices on the menu in the restaurant. You have to refer to the clipboard for the prices which is a little annoying. Also when checking the menu online, they don't show the prices either! \u00a0I think you should at least make the prices known online, it shouldn't be a secret. I've been wanting to try this place for so long since I'm such a sucker for Hot Pot and I wasn't disappointed. The wait can be long so reservations or coming early would be recommended."], ["Lisa C.", "This place is great and especially if youre hungover.

I would think this place would be pretty busy but every time we come it's so close to empty. I like that they come with a sauce bar to make your own yummy concoctions. No complaints about service, we had a good experience every time we came here."], ["Jazlyn B.", "Little sheep makes me so happy, I always have a smile from cheek to cheek while at little sheep. I recommend the half original house half spicy broth. I love to use the spicy broth for cooking my meat in for a little more flavor and kick. The original house broth is so yummy for sipping and drinking while eating noodles with. What really gets me though is the sauce bar!! Dipping my meat in the sauce gives it so much move flavor. I usually mix the ponzu with chili, garlic, green onions, and cilantro. My boyfriend loves the garlic soy mixed with more garlic chunks. They have a lot more great options as well that you can try out because it's self serve, so you can fit your sauce to your food pallet preference!I LOVE AYCE Tuesdays. Such a good deal. They don't offer the whole menu but they offer customer favorites. I'm not too crazy abut their birthday specials. Its some sort of azuki pancake, which i could live with out but its nice that they offer it.Customer service is great. All servers are ready to take care of you, taking your order, bringing your food and refilling your drinks.

The food is always on point, as is the wait staff. However, you may be wondering, \"what gives?\" with a two star rating. Well...up until tonight, we've always had good experiences here. \u00a0That ended with tonight. We put our name down on the wait list, however the hostess never mention the amount of time we'd have to wait. So we opted to sit inside and wait. Numerous groups came in and also out their names down. Now this is the part that grinds my gears. We were a party of two. A bunch of other groups came in after us, and also out their names down. The two hostess seats a group of four, who were two lines below us. I didn't know what their reasoning was, but we were very upset that we were overlooked, especially since we were sitting right in front of the hostess stand. It's very unfortunate I felt the need to express my disappointment with the way we were treated especially since we love everything else about Little Sheep."], ["Tina L.", "I come here a lot with my friends (one of whom is a weekly regular). I absolutely love the food here, and the restaurant itself is very beautiful. The atmosphere is great, and they have a very wide variety of food, sauces, and drinks. They also take reservations, which is very convenient for me. And the best part is that although the bill comes out to be pricey, my friends and I usually leave without having paid more than $40/person.Everything is great here EXCEPT for the service. The hostess is not very welcoming, and the busters, waiters, and waitresses couldn't care less if you're in their way. They'll run into you if they need to. The way I've been bumped into here by the employees, I almost feel as though they would walk right THROUGH you if they could. I was just there again last night. The server that we had was absolutely creepy. He stood behind each of us, and would tap on our shoulder every time he wanted to ask us if we needed something. His face looked like he was half asleep, and he seriously stood WAY TOO CLOSE. Like, no joke, right when I felt someone tap on my shoulder, I turn around, and there's an apron-covered crotch in my face. And he NEVER smiled. Or frowned. Or anything. I think his face is stuck in one mood: bored. Oh, and we were there from 9-11:30, and from 9-11:15, my entire party of 8 people had ZERO water refills. Keep in mind that the soup is very salty, and I usually drink at least three glasses of water during any regular dinner outing, which would average about an hour to an hour and a half. So for TWO HOURS and FIFTEEN MINUTES, we had NO REFILLS for our water. This is completely unacceptable! If you're looking for great food at a decent price and you couldn't care less about the service, this is a place to eat. If they ever fix their service practices, I will come back with an updated review. Until then, two stars. Minus one star for employees not caring about their patrons' presence, minus one star for rarely ever refilling our water, and minus one (million if I could) stars for the creepy waiter!

The servers were attentive, friendly and helpful. \u00a0Today, the service was just so-so. \u00a0Had to serve ourselves water A couple of times.The food quality is still very good, most of us share the Sunday lunch special combo, which consisted of a variety of vegetables, fish, meat, shrimp, mushrooms, noodles and bean curd. \u00a0The hot spicy soup base was very delicious. \u00a0I selected black vinegar, green onions and cilantro as my first sauce from the sauce bar. \u00a0Lunch combos easily fed two people per serving, making it a very affordable and filling meal.

Not sure which sauces to use? \u00a0There's a handy sauce guide located atop the sauce bar, which provides you with suggested sauces for the different ingredients.The prices are affordable, you can also select ala carte ingredients instead of lunch combo if you wish to try a variety of different things.We all walked away very satisfied, and those who have never been here before today were delighted with the experience."], ["Jurija M.", "Oh man. What in the hell did I get myself into here? I took a chance. I like to be adventurous and I like to try new foods. I like to try new foods even when I have no idea what I am doing because I assume the servers will help me. I was wrong! The service here is not good. Not good at all. It was already challenging that the accents and English of the servers was limited. I am fine with that, but when you don't greet us at the front and we think you are closed (even though we see one table seated) and you don't even try to explain the menu to us once we are seated because \"it's hard,\" well then, I'm already at a loss for words, too! Side note: he said it was hard because of his English. I respect that so we did our best to minimize our order and questions. We told him we were open to whatever, including in and all of his suggestions or him placing part of the order for us. Whatever is easiest... We ordered half vegetarian soup and half regular. Then, we picked random items on the menu. We were given the number of items that each item came with...for example: a full order of shrimp was 10 pieces and half was 5. Other than that, we chose random vegetables and fish we liked, or, thought we would like. The fishcakes were very, very rubbery. Is this normal? The spinach did not taste like spinach. I honestly can't even put into words what it tasted like. It was weird. The sauce bar was kinda cool. We didn't understand that we could just go up and help ourselves until our server pointed and said \"Get yourself.\" The flavors of everything overall were just weird. I can't quite tell you if I liked it or not. The whole thing was a mish mosh and the service was not helpful: we didn't ever get our waters refilled, we never got the juice we ordered, and they didn't replace our spinach. Yes, something was that wrong with the spinach! It was kind of a bummer to pay so much just to understand so little and not really know if we were even eating the meal properly. I won't be back.

As I am washing my hands I noticed a server come out of the stall after using it and simply walk out... He went straight into the kitchen to grab some trays of food!!! Disgusting!I will never be going here again because that turned my stomach, I was lucky I didn't see this before eating. I would have told my party we were leaving if we hadn't already finished eating. To review the food: \u00a0As a fan of Ichiriki and Asuka its hard to beat those. This is a different style of hot pot, not the Japanese style. Knowing that full well going in I went in not expecting the same flavors. I had the lunch special with the mild spicy broth and the angus beef. For $12.95 it was a ton of food and was overall satisfying. My girlfriend and her friend shared the regular broth and seemed to enjoy it with the pork belly and angus beef they both selected. A side of rice was about $1.50 and was worth it to go with the meats. They have a sauce bar with suggestions to go with the type of meat you choose.The Service:The service was really slow and inattentive for the amount of people in the restaurant. With a total of maybe 5 or 6 parties and about 8 servers walking around we were only checked on toward the end of our meal. We had to flag someone down when the broth was running out for my girlfriends selection. Water was refilled with no ice and warm water... Overall I would not return if I could go to another hot pot place around, after seeing the incident in the bathroom I will never go back.

He comes to us again saying the same thing. He leaves. Comes again to ask us. Uh....you're just annoying now. Water, not refilled unless asked. Soup was boiling till it was to the pot...no refills unless asked. Didn't come to check on us unless we ask. They only came up to us..\"do you want the check?\" Wow, they sure want us to leave. We just hate that the tips are already fixed because we have a big group...and service was just VERY HORRIBLE! No good tips for you again."], ["Amber-Lynn H.", "Is it ok to write an updated review a week later? haha. Well, I'm just such a fan of Little Sheep. Plus, we decided to try their lunch special for the first time since we always come here for dinner. After this outing, think I'll be coming here for lunch more often when overcome with a hot pot craving. Got there exactly at opening and there was a line of maybe 15 people in front of us. Everyone was sat quickly and the servers were on top of everything, taking orders, refilling water, offering more broth, etc. The $12.95 lunch special is actually bigger than pictured. I wish I had known this before ordering a few too many add ons. It's ok, it was delicious! The special comes with your choice of meat, fresh thick noodles, napa cabbage, a seaweed knot, 2 pieces of potato and daikon each, enoki mushrooms, a single different type of mushroom, a fish, pork, and beef meatball and 4 pieces of sponge tofu. I wasn't a fan of the balls but hey, it's still a steal! Then we got a few faves...more sponge tofu, bean curd knots, and baby bok choy.I know I'm a little late to the game, but I just discovered the fried and steamed buns! HOLY MOLY! Hot and fresh, dipped in the sweetened condensed milk....it reminded me of andagi. Whatever the case may be....it's now the equivalent to the bean curd knots and lychee sake in the sense that I cannot come here without ordering it. These buns are a game changer. I mean, just about every table in there had an order on their table. That's saying something. The cool part is you can get all fried or steamed OR half/half. I enjoyed the balance of both.Although there were tons of people here taking advantage of the lunch special, it was easy to get a seat and it felt like the servers are more attentive and friendly at lunch. Very satisfied."], ["C L.", "We had the premium lunch special for $18.95. It was so delicious and way too much for one person. I really enjoyed the spicy broth. But I would suggest getting half spicy and half original. You can mix the broth to tame down the spicy-ness. They also have all you can eat for $23.95 but the lunch special had everything you need to feel complete. They do have a lunch special for $12.95 but does not include seafood. However, it is still enough to eat if your not craving seafood. I can't wait to go again."], ["H. H.", "It was the first time I have been here after hearing some good reviews. \u00a0We had the lunch special plus some sides and that was enough for us. I liked the selection of the soup bases and the sides. \u00a0Too bad they don't have some of the items available any more. \u00a0They have an all you can eat for a set price one of the days. I'll have to come back to try it so I can try different sides. \u00a0The selection of sauces were good since they gave some suggestion on what to mix together.The decor of the restaurant was nice and bright. The food to cook came out quickly. \u00a0All in all it was a delicious and healthy lunch to share. \u00a0It would have been nice to have a bit more vegetables in each order."], ["Nick E.", "Decent shabu shabu. A very extensive menu to choose from, but as a first time customer, I found it hard to gauge how much food we should order. Fortunately, the waitress we had let us know how much we could get. I did find the broth selection limited. We got the standard broth and its spicy counterpart. \u00a0The sauces were quite good though. Great selection there. The regular broth was flavorful - meaty and salty. But the spicy was more on the spices side than it was caliente. It was littered with red peppers that weren't too spicy either. They instead cluttered our dish to the point where we took another plate and removed them from the dish. It was a heaping mound.If you show them a check-in on yelp or Facebook you get adorable scoops of ice cream.I'll have to return with a veteran who knows what they're doing to see if I botched my first experience. In any case, as a first impression, I was nonplussed. I'd come back if someone wanted to go. But I don't know that I'll be returning on my own."], ["Jeff T.", "Little Sheep is a solid hot pot restaurant by any standards. I give it 4 stars because the prices are not what I would consider to be a great value. Hot pot restaurants are trendy here these days...I find this strange given our weather is nearly always warm or hot. Anyway, none of the other guys in town are of comparable size or quality to Little Sheep and most of them are not authentic. I am a hot pot fanatic and have traveled around with the specific purpose of eating at hot pot restaurants. As I mentioned at the top of this review, Little Sheep can hold its own anywhere. It is nice to finally have an establishment like this in Honolulu. The soup base was tasty and you are able to heat up the spicy version to your liking. There is a huge variety of meat, vegetables and other items - all were all fresh. The sauce bar was large, well-stocked and cleanly kept.The House Fish Balls were excellent. Go ahead a try the Sesame Pancake (a fresh loaf of bread) that you are probably looking at on the menu.The staff we interacted with spoke Mandarin Chinese and good English. So, whether you are Chinese or not, they will be able to service you well (sometimes you need a Chinese speaker at authentic restaurants). I appreciate the later hours of operation.Little Sheep has *many* locations in the contiguous U.S., Canada, Japan and China. I have been to several of them. Our location here in Honolulu does not disappoint."], ["Lyla D.", "Baa baa baa...Wow! Our lunch specials had us bleating out compliments of satisfaction with \u00a0the food flavors, quality, quantity and wait staff service. For $12.95, you get a full serving of the protein of your choice, fish and meatballs, assorted vegetables, and broth. The individual portion could easily feed one really hungry person or 2 light eaters. We went full-tilt and each of us ordered our own set. I ordered the lamb set and my husband went for the pork belly. This was our first time for lunch so we weren't sure about the portion size so we also ordered the Mongolian Beef Pancake (a delicious but over-order mistake). While waiting for our lunches, our carafe of watermelon juice was delivered. We quickly took a trip to the sauce/condiment bar. We got several dishes of varying dipping sauces (sesame seed, spicy soy and garlic, and bean curd sauces). Also, at the condiment bar were containers of fresh chopped garlic, green onions and red chilies. Our waiter timed our seating with delivery of our platters. He inquired if we needed anything else and checked back with us several times during our dine. We didn't even have to hail him...we liked his attentiveness and efficiency. \u00a0We also understood that he had a little trouble with his command of English but he really was trying. Another Yelper stopped by to point out the Yelp check-in promotion on shown in a placard. Free dessert PER check-in. We chose their luscious black sesame seed ice cream. The 3 scoop portion was rich, refreshing and mouth-cooling relief from the spicy chilies. Our experience was nothing short of a fine time. The broths (Original House and Mild-Spicy) were flavorful and if you didn't think that there wasn't enough flavor, those dipping sauces were there to amp up the tastes. This is \"Flavor Town\"!Our only regret was that we ate too much that we had to \"fight\" to stay awake while watching a movie at the nearby theater..."], ["Brianne Y.", "Ordering your food on a check-list type menu, serving ourselves to sauces and whatnot limited the amount of interactions with our waiter, but after hearing so many many good things, service was a disappointment. Broth was tasty, meat was great and sides were pretty hefty. Overall, I loved the food and the ambiance of the restaurant. I would recommend the restaurant to a friend. Three stars from me."], ["Kanoe I.", "My Mongolian Hot Pot experience was just.....OK. After seeing all the hype on Yelp and IG, I decided that I needed to try this place. The restaurant itself is pretty spacious, location is great and parking is good. Thumbs up! We walked in on a Tues night with no problem. The menu can be overwhelming but if you follow the steps, you can find a way to navigate through it. Options options options!! Ugh. We over-ordered and ended up with an unexpected feast for two. Stuffed beyond belief. Next time we'll know how much and what to order. We got the Half House/Half Spicy broth. Perfect for us bc I don't like spicy and my bf does. It was ok. I wasn't used to the herbs in the broth but I worked around it. While we did make choices I wouldn't recommend, these will definitely be in our order the next time we go. Watermelon JuiceMushroom MedleyTofu----All Types, especially the Tofu SpongeBean CurdVeggies----AllScallops----Not the Seafood MedleyNoodles----ClearSorry, we don't eat meat so no suggestions. I did like the sauce bar: House Sesame, Bean Curd Sauce, Sweet Garlic Soy, Sa-Cha Sauce, Seafood Soy. Liked the House Sesame and Sweet Garlic the most. I may try this place again but I have other fave ones in town that I like better. I just wasn't impressed...."], ["Kris A.", "My experience with This place was awesome. Though service was a bit crazy (poor waiter was going everywhere so ordering food took a bit), our waiter Sydney helped us understand how their ordering system worked. Me and the fiance was there to celebrate my birthday (cue the confetti), we ordered the ying/yang soup to try both broth, the pork belly slices, meatball sampler, tofu combo plater, seafood plater, and mongolian beef pie (broke da mouth). Oh and their honey green tea. In all it was about 66 bucks, but portions was worth the price. I was super full by the end, and the fiance had to finish the rest of the meatball sampler... Sucks for me, cuz I disn't get to try the rest of the flavor TT___TT. Btw the green tea was sweet and floral, yummmmm! Definitely \u00a0want to introduce my family to eat here, but imma make them pay for their share XD"], ["Victoria A.", "I've hesitated writing this review only because I think there's a definite learning curve when coming here. I read the Yelp reviews and figured out how to order (yes. Apparently there's a language barrier and lack of attentive or directive attention on the part of the wait staff). This is what I've learned after two visits:1) You're on your own unless you have a personal interpreter to help you.2) First visit was difficult, almost comical but got better after the second one.3) Don't let the poor customer service deter you from your soup.4) K.I.S.S. (refer to Rod U.'s review)5) Secret's in the sauces (so, I like sauce...chose wisely)I think the wait staff assumes that everyone that comes here either already knows what they want and know what to do hence the poor lack of direction and ability to convey direction. \u00a0So if I made my review based from my first visit this probably would've been a one-star review but I love soup and wanted to try another visit taking my lessons from the first visit and applying it again. Still crappy service but I LOVE soup (refer to #3 above).The soup base was good and only had to be minimally tweaked to my liking with the various sauces. I like a simple soup with complex flavors. 1) So start with the soup base (original vs. spicy)2) Decide on full (original or spicy) \u00a0or half- half (original & spicy)2) Add your \u00a0protein3) Add vegetables and/or noodles 4) Simmer a while 5) Tweak to your taste with the various sauces from the sauce barOne order of proteins and veggies is good for 2-4 people (depending on whether or not they are huge eaters). You can order additional sides to your main order or perhaps just go ala carte. I revised my last order from the initial visit and stuck to what I liked, seafood and veggies - remembering and chanting, \"KISS, KISS, KISS.\" 'Twas a much better experience than the first and almost felt like I was ready to get my hot-pot training wheels taken off. I think I need another go around before that happens. Mind you, I still had zero assistance from the wait staff when it came to ordering. So again, if you've never been here before you'll need these cliff notes.Also, if you're planning on eating here first THEN going somewhere else - you're going to smell like food! Just saying, the aroma of all these hot-pots going will penetrate your pores and clothing like cigarettes to a non-smoker. Just saying, if you're not opposed to this, go on and get your soup on. Otherwise, just be prepared to smell like a hot-pot mess."], ["Alina S.", "I had the BEST SERVER! I think his name was Jun. We got the lunch special. Their portions were huge and so worth the price!

Living on The Big Island for some time, we really missed good Chinese food. When we came to Oahu and found Golden Eagle, we were pleasantly surprised. The food was fresh and service was good. Prices were normal for Chinese food. If you like Kung pao, theirs is really tasty, just need to ask for extra spicy since they make it pretty mild.

Yes a DOG in a restaurant! Then the same people moved to a second table with their dog in a stroller and were holding it there as well. WOW. The pork fried rice was pretty good and the egg rolls were so-so. Unfortunately the cake noodle was not fried long enough. The black bean sauce was only soaked on one side of the noodles and they were stiff and dry on the bottom, not soft. Service was very attentive.

After stepping into a few locations we decided we liked what we saw and smelled in this restaurant and decided to stay. The food looked amazing in the photos so we decided to go with beef with mixed veggies and roast duck. While both plates were delicious we were both disappointed in the portions. I suppose if we had ordered more than two plates it would've been enough but since we didn't, it was basically enough to only feed one hungry person. The roast duck was a bit too salty, but I used hot mustard and soy sauce to cut back the salty taste or one could use rice. The rice was a little too stiff but all in all we both liked our experience here. The waiter wasn't so bad once the restaurant started to get busy. All in all... I would perhaps go again and see how the portions would feel with more than two plates to choose from."], ["Krystal S.", "This is my go to Chinese restaurant.

For the record, I tend have zero expectations for ambiance from inexpensive, easy, half-way-hole-in-the-wall restaurants, so the comfortable booth seating and very lit, diner-esque decor of this place caused me neither shock nor dismay.We were immediately greeted by a very friendly, smiling woman who was handling the front of house. She sat us down at a booth to peruse the menu, and we were able to place our order just as soon as we were ready. The service throughout was absolutely fantastic.We opted to try the 2-person special. For $29.99, we had honey walnut shrimp, house special sauce chicken, crispy gau gee mein, egg drop soup, and steamed rice. This 2-person special easily could have fed 4, and very well.The honey-walnut shrimp was by far the favorite. Even 20-25 minutes after it was in our hands (the time it took to get it home, dish it out, and dig in), it was perfectly crispy and remarkably un-soggy, nor was it overly oily despite being fried. The sauce was lightly applied, but it was enough to be tasted without any overkill. There were plenty of candied walnuts in the dish. Absolutely loved this, and will be back for it!The egg drop soup was very good- \u00a0I grew up looking forward to dim sum meals in San Francisco that were always started of with egg drop, and as far as I'm concerned, it was good. Extra vegetables and pork in there just can't hurt!The gau gee mein was my boyfriend's least favorite part- too many veggies, without enough noodle, he said. Respectfully, I disagree. It had large bits of char sui, crispy wontons, and a few large pork (chicken? Aah, I couldn't tell and didn't care) slivers in it alongside the just-crunchy-but-cooked-enough broccoli and other vegetables. To each their own. I enjoyed it, although I would concede that perhaps the meats could be chopped up for the sake of distributing more evenly throughout the dish.The steamed rice was steamed rice.Overall, I'm happy to have found a much-needed, better alternative to my past Chinese food haunts... the food was quite good (the shrimp dish was GREAT), the staff was positively lovely- efficient and very friendly, and the price was absolutely worth it. For a good, casual Chinese place, this is the closest to 5 stars that I have found on the island."], ["Sumana M.", "Food was good! We had egg fried rice with curry chicken and hot and sour soup. Portions were good enough for the two of us. Our baby loved it as well!The waitress was very friendly, and this says a lot considering it was an authentic chinese restaurant.

And the fact that Chinese people are always eating here is a strong indication that they serve great Chinese food! What we ordered:Honey Glazed Walnut Shrimp - I have never had HGWS like this. The shrimp are heavily breaded and lightly covered in the honey mayo sauce. It's crunchy and light and savory all at the same time. Upon first bite, I was unsure if I liked it. But after my first shrimp, I decided that it was a different take on a Chinese classic but that I liked it. The texture was different but the flavors were still good! Salt & Pepper Shishamo - OK, there must have been at least 20 fishies sitting on our plate. They came out piping hot and crispy. Next time, when we order this, I'm going to ask them to make them crispier. And beware, the salt and pepper seasoning is mixed with green onions and spicy red peppers. Those red peppers are H-O-T! Pressed Duck - What an interesting dish. It's like a duck sandwich. I liked it but it tasted \"oily.\" It was good but definitely not my favorite dish. I'm actually not sure if I'd order it ever again but it was definitely worth trying. I didn't particularly like the sweet and sour sauce they served with it so I asked for hoisen sauce and I liked it much better. Szechuan String Beans with Pork - Yummy dish and packed with pork.

Golden Eagle's wait staff is superb though! There is a waiter and waitress who complement each other well, joking with our group, along with just being very pleasant in general. Food is good, like any other Chinese restaurant, although I was disappointed by their honey walnut shrimp (too much batter, not enough mayo-honey sauce). I would recommend their crab-cream cheese wontons, lettuce cups, steamed fish filet with onions and ginger, and stuffed eggplants (my personal favorite).

Definitely not tasty.But the host/waiter was super nice and seemed really apologetic.

And as we pondered whether to buy the pork dumplings, someone walked in and bought whatever was left. Man!I did manage to get a fresh batch of pork chow fun though. The thing with chow fun is that the restaurant needs a good noodle supplier because the fresh rice noodles are what make the dish. And I consider myself a bit of a chow fun snob because I live close to a good noodle supplier in Washington DC, so I generally expect to be disappointed by chow fun in other cities. Here, the rice noodles were very good and fresh (though a narrower width than I'm used to). There was less soy sauce than I'm used to but it was still tasty. And the pork was different than the beef than I'm used to (although I get that it's cheaper to ship pork than beef to Hawaii). But overall, it was a delicious experience!

Omg!! Noooooo! This sucks, I wanted to try it. I just got the manapua $1.80. It was about the size of my hand. When we got it, it was steamy and soft. I took a bite of it, the bun was soft and smooth. The charsiu was not over marinated and was shredded good. It was sooo good. Or maybe cuz I haven't tried one for awhile. But yea it was good!

Oh, the other hole in the wall with the long line of folks. Grew up eating the manapua's here, like every other Asian-something kid in Hawaii.

One box for your loved ones and two for you. That being said, I think you have to grow up with them for it to match the hype. Otherwise, it's just yummy manapua and let's not forget how many people make and eat manapua around here, and not to mention we used to eat the manapuas from 711 for crying out loud. Mmmm. Manapua. Dead cat. Did anyone else grow up with that joke too? I eat it cause it's free. As in, some family member's always bringing it to me before or after their Vegas trip. When I do go myself, I really like their half moons and pork hash. You have to be kind of gross to make me a pork hash that I won't enjoy, but I still can taste the difference between hashes and know a good from a bad one, unlike my husband who inhales his pork hashes.

Holy nostalgia batman. Growing up, manapua from Char Hung Sut was a special occasion both literally and also when one of my parents had to wake up early and take someone to the airport. Then, I started middle school near Chinatown and my dad, ever the opportunist, decided we would get manapuas here at least once a week using \"if you can get ready early we can grab manapua and rice cake on the way to school\" tactic. Which is probably one of the few ways to get a middle school aged girl awake at 4:45 to leave Ewa. So back to this morning- everyone working there were the same familiar faces I'd seen growing up. Not having been here for awhile (I have to admit we became Libby's people the past few years) I way over ordered ordering for more like 8 people than the 4 in my house but it was totally worth it. It may still have the red dye but what's a little red dye numba 5 once in a great while, right? Everything was delicious- my manapua, my pork hash, pepeiau-way too full to eat my rice cake now but if it's anything like when I was in school-it'll be my favorite part!

If you're gonna be in Chinatown, don't miss this place!"], ["Jonathan T.", "After tasting every \"dim sum\" item on their menu, I can't really say that I would return. For starters, mainlanders visiting Honolulu should understand that this Chinatown hideaway does not serve traditional dim sum; rather, they make Hawaiian style dumplings, cakes, and buns. It's similar to how Laotions have their own version of pho (Vietnamese), or how Americans americanized taekwando (Japanese) in the form of karate. To my point, don't expect traditional dumpling regulars such as shu mai, har gow, or deep fried crab paste balls on sugarcane sticks. Even one of the chefs spoke with my mandarin speaking girlfriend and confessed she's never heard of the items written on the menu, too! lol.Upon entering, you'll notice women scattered about, each holding down a different job. One is cutting and wrapping cakes with banana leaves. Others are making and steaming dumplings. And, of course, there's someone holding down the cash registers, taking orders, and barking them back into the kitchen. The menu hangs high on the right wall, and there, you can order from a variety of \"dim sum\" goods that, for most people familiar with this common Chinese brunch, sound completely foreign: -Pepeiau-Pork hash-Cripsy Kau Gee-Rice cake-Yap chai-ManapuaAside from the manapua (which is like a Hawaiian pork bao), each goodie listed above just tasted a bit bland for me. The texture was there, the size, the shape, but they all needed additional marination. Especially the pork hash (which is their version of shu mai) - it tasted like bland steamed ground meat. Gah! I regret buying multiples of each, because it was truly a bit difficult to eat it all. (And I eat everything.) Really too bad, because I love supporting small businesses and dim sum. If you want to take a risk and try out their bites though, your pocket won't take a big hit. They're incredibly affordable. (Even for Hawaii.) The staff there are nice, too."], ["Andy F.", "I am born and raised in Hawaii my whole life. However, I've never developed a taste for local style Chinese food. Growing up with parents and both maternal and paternal grandparents who arrived in Hawaii from Canton, China a couple of years before and after I was born, I was brought up to be a proper Chinese gentleman. Apparently, they did an excellent job because nowadays, the Chinese people I talk to are asking me, \"when I came to America or what part of China did I come from?\" LoL! The point is, I didn't grow up eating manapua, pork hash, gau gee, and etc. A trip to Chinatown for Dim Sum was Empress, Golden Palace, Legend, and Wo Fat for me. I don't remember anyone even mentioning this place until recently. I've heard a lot of chatter about how Char Hung Sut has excellent manapua and dim sum, but these are from locals or non-Chinese individuals. All right, lets see.Not to totally dismiss this place, but I do remember coming here on a field trip in elementary school. That was the only time I remember coming here. When you first enter, it appears you stepped right into the factory because you will see a table with ladies huddled around making dim sum, the kitchen ahead with stacks of metal steamers on the counter and giant pots pumping on the stove, and towers of white boxes everywhere! Did I come in the wrong way? Where's the menu? Ah, the menu is high up on the wall to your right on two small felt boards with random size changeable letters. Looks like a defective eye test chart! Ummmm, is the menu in English? O_O What the hell is Yap Chai and Ma Tai Soo and Pepeiao??? Is this Chinese? I was so confused. I figured out Ma Tai Soo since the Cantonese is somewhat the same, but the other two I still have no clue. Romanizing Cantonese doesn't work! I gave up looking at the menu and just looked at the food and figured out what was what. Luckily, I had a Cantonese-speaking lady take my order, so I could order what they're supposed to be called, and besides Ma Tai Soo, the other two items aren't even close.I pretty much ordered one of everything to try. The Rice Cake was very mushy, sweet, and dense. No where near the best. It was a decent size piece at a decent price, 80 cents a piece. The Char Siu Manapua was huge, but the bun was super dense and heavy, and there wasn't enough filling compared to the size of the bun. It felt like eating a concrete block! The filling in the manapua was pretty much the same in the Half Moon. It ate more so sweet than savory or meaty. In addition, the wrapper for the Half Moon was very thick, and that made it more tough and bland. Similarly, the Yip Chai had the same exact filling, and the mochi outer layer was super thick and dense. It was also very oily. The Ma Tai Soo had a similar filling too! I'm getting the idea this place uses the same pork as the basis for every filling. Anyway, the outer on the Ma Tai Soo was hard and tough, especially the bottom portion, very dry, and it wasn't flaky. I made the biggest mistake when I ordered the Taro Cake. I wasn't thinking at all! This brick of taro was thick, heavy, dry, and dense. The taro chunks were unnecessarily big, and it had some of that pork filling again! The Pepeiao is still a name I haven't deciphered, but by process of elimination, I deduced it's the Chiu Chow Dumpling/Fun Gor. Though, it's hardly similar. The filling is different and clearly adjusts local taste. The outside wrapper was thick like the Half Moon.The service here is great. There's a mix of locals and people from China, and they're all friendly and nice. Your order comes out pretty quick. When it's crowded in there, you get confused as to who is in line and who is just waiting because there's just people standing all over the place staring aimlessly around the area.Apologies to the locals who love this place, but this local Chinese guy didn't care for the food. Everything was very heavy and all tasted the same. Now I'm not a hater of local Chinese food, I just have a different preference: I prefer Royal Kitchen for my manapua; I prefer my rice cake at U-Choice In; I prefer my Ma Tai Soo at Sing Cheong Bakery; and I prefer my taro cake from my grandma, who makes the best!And I prefer my chicken feet. :)"], ["Char B.", "WOW! Unbelievable! I just went to Char Hung Sut for the first time and it was great. The half moon, Mai tai and pork hash Sui were awesome. Also, the Char Siu Bao (aka char siu manapua) \u00a0was awesome. \u00a0It's a big fluffy roll packed with meat. I believe it's pork. This seems to be what they're known for and man they've mastered this item. Also got some sort of dessert not sure what it was called but it had some coconut sugar filling and was interesting and . The whole box was like $8.25. FYI this place is a whole in the wall in Chinatown and directly across the street from a park with a lot of homeless. The area is fine but I wouldn't go eat in that park. \u00a0It's a takeout spot.

Calm down. I'm not making fun of the name - it's simply a name you have to think twice before you say it, unless you were born in Canton. No, not Canton, Ohio... I meant Canton Province in China! Ok, before you de-friend me because you can't take the heat or can't take pure honesty rolling from my lips... hear me out!First, have you noticed I gave your favorite spot a perfect score?! So there! I mean it's good and all. Hung Sut Char, oh I mean Char Hung Sut has delicious half moon(s), pork hash, and other bite sized goodies, in fact the last time I was here my sister purchased half dozen crispy things with idk what was inside it, but it was all good! However, I need to say once again the manapua here is good, but it's simply not my favorite manapua! Maybe second, or even forth?! Just IMHO I prefer (1) Libby, (2) Pinky's (Big Island), (3) Chun Wa, over (4) Char Hung Sut... Again, I'm only speaking of the manapua!I do think the pork hash & half moon(s) here edge the rest. So, even though I feel the manapua here is maybe 4th rated in the islands, I have to admit it's pretty consistent, big, and generally meaty! I know of some Char Hung Sut fans who want to take me to the back shed and give me dirty lickins, but it is what it is. I love Libby more... Sorry!Ok, having given my very IMHO about the manapua here... I still highly recommend Char Hung Sut! You really can't go wrong here, hence the perfect score of 5-stars! Yes, I still advise you to pickup the famous manapua here and compare! Hey, you might like it better, maybe? That's the great thing about our wonderful country - freedom of choice and freedom of opinions. Maybe it's the mysteries of Chinatown that influence some that walk in the \"don't trip\" doorway. Maybe because it's always fresh here, like no matter what you order, even if you don't know what you order! Hey... As long it does NOT \"meow\" or \"bark\" and we good, right?! Lastly, another big influence for me is how Char Hung Sut has remained such a go-to landmark, in an ever growing hipster destination, Chinatown! I mean Char Hung Sut was founded in 1945 by Bat Moi Kam Mau (yes, I'm not making up her name, silly)! Yup, it's small and the sidewalk or car seat is your dining table, but that's the joy of these one-of-a-kind places! Oh, and the owner is NOT rude, like many wimpy hipsters claim he is... Nope! The owner is simply \"Chinatown Friendly\"... Come on in...

Char Hung Sut takes this to a whole new level though. You literally walk into their kitchen to order and get your food. Also there is no menu, you just need to know what to order ahead of time. I thought all of that was actually rather charming though. It gave me hope that the food would be just that much better.Unfortunately, there were a lot of things about the food that I didn't really care for. The pork hash was fairly dry and the filling was not very flavorful either. I really liked the manapua filling though, it was very good and I thought the stringy texture was just right. However the outer portion of the manapua was just too thick and bready. I ended up just breaking it open and avoiding the bulk of the outer portion.Overall, While I thought their manapua filling was the best, I had a few issues with other areas of their items.

Like most places in Chinatown it doesn't look very clean or impressive, but head down there around 6am any day of the week (except Tuesday) and you'll see a pretty impressive line. They start running out of the good stuff around 9-10am and are usually closed by 1-2pm, so make sure you get there early. It's worth it."], ["Amelinda L.", "This place is the BUSINESS! I'm a big fan of manapua (as most people from Hawaii are) and every time I'm visiting home, I need to get my hands on some delicious steamed manapua just like I used to eat in my childhood. I don't mind baked manapua, but there's seriously nothing like a big, fluffy steamed manapua filled with char siu (Chinese-style BBQ pork). We parked on the street and made a quick trip here on a quiet Friday morning. It was really cool to see everyone working and expertly making manapua, pork hash, and other specialties. I wish I was able to catch a couple photos, but we were the only customers in the small shop, so we ordered steamed manapua ($1.75/each), paid, and made our way out within minutes. We returned to the car and devoured the hot, fluffy delicious buns before heading to our next destination. If you can manage it, this is a worthwhile trip. Delicious manapua made the same way it was 50+ years ago in the same space. I'm craving some right now. I'll have to make sure to grab some pork hash, half moons, etc the next time I'm in town!Tip: Bring cash!"], ["Elizabeth D.", "Small hole in the wall place in China town that makes their food with pride. Been here couple of times before because my school was near by. Nothing fancy pancy about this place, just good food made from hard work and pride. Location is old and run down but very organized by the buzy bee workers. \u00a0be ready with your order cuz they get buzy . Pork hash is very tasty and steamed manapua is so good hot. I shall return to try other stuff on the menu."], ["Jason P.", "If you're looking for the best pork hash on the island, this might be #1... But to get a 5 star rating, the manapua has to be top level too so I had to bump the rating down a little... Manapua bun was a little too hard and heavy for me. \u00a0Prefer libbys or royal kitchen. \u00a0But the pork hash is awesome"], ["Leilani R.", "I've been fortunate enough to have been eating Char Hung Sut's manapua and pork hash since I was a wee little baby! \u00a0Every time my grandma came to California from Hawai'i she brought at least two dozen manapua and some pork hash. \u00a0We would freeze the manapua, steam them and prayed that they lasted until her next visit! \u00a0Whenever we make our way back to 'Oahu our first stop is Char Hung Sut to pick up these delicious manapua. \u00a0Nothing in California or Hawai'i compares to their manapua. \u00a0Light soft bread with the perfect amount of delicious char siu. \u00a0They are absolutely delicious!! \u00a0Let them know you'll be flying and they will special pack your order :)"], ["Lofa L.", "So I've been on a manapua kick for 2015 and I can't get enough. But I miss the days when I could get manapua for under a buck. My other spot raised prices where to where I decided NOT to order manapua so I could have a pork hash feast instead. WTF!!!!!!!!So last minute right before entering town during the busy morning rush I pulled over real fast to Char Hung Sut. I'm not sure if this is my favorite manapua but i love it lots. I can be my manapua sidebang if its not my main squeeze (I havent picked on yet). I ordered two and two pork hash, picked up my bag, and walked out the door. Yeah you walk in the middle of the prep area to order but at least you know THEY making it. I kinda enjoy the show of the cooks making half moons and pork hash in front of you while you what (although the wait is never super long unless someone orders huge order and you waiting for the new batch of manapua to finish). The one thing you might have to do is let the buggah cool down because they come out SUPER HOT when fresh out the steamer. That slows me down when I try to drive and eat (not suppose to do that I hear but I do it anyways) but they dont make a bunch and keep it in a warmer, NOPE, cook and sell fast. Warmers are for chumps, they got woks and bamboo steamers on the constant rotation. I just talked myself to getting another manapua today. Daym. Char Hung Sut. Bango! Can!"], ["Hope S.", "This is my go-to for the best steamed manapua. Once you walk in you can see manapua and pork hash being made. The quality and taste is unlike other places. The char siu is delicious and filling for the price that you pay. Remember to go early because they do run out quick! The staff is very efficient and fast when placing your order. \u00a0However, I did feel rushed as I entered the store and it is only cash or check."], ["Gail Y.", "The best manapua in Hawaii. It has always been a treat when growing up, but now that I am closer, I get to enjoy it more regularly. \u00a0Now they have a website with all the prices. Cash only. \u00a0Reasonably priced. \u00a0Stop in or call in. \u00a0Go in and come out. The early bird gets the manapua (opens at 5:30 am)! \u00a0They run out of items as you get closer to closing.The bun can stand alone, unlike others where I pull the bun off and toss it in the trash or feed the animals. \u00a0The bun is slightly sweet, with just the right elasticity. \u00a0Not too dry and not mushy like some of the competition. \u00a0The pork is shredded and moist, but not soupy. The proportion of meat to bun is perfect. \u00a0They also have the best half moon-- just enough seasoning. \u00a0(Some of the competition's have a funky seasoning--too strong for my taste.) \u00a0Again, they have just enough filling (good crunch on the filling--chestnuts? turnips? bamboo shoots? Not sure what gives it that crunch, but it's really good) and the wrapping is not too thick. Their taro cake has nice chunks of taro, their pork hash has lots of pork in it and doesn't have that eggy yellow color, and their chow fun is awesome. \u00a0They have the hotness of their mustard down to a science. \u00a0It just stops short of going up your nostrils! Everything is good here!"], ["Josh N.", "The people here are very friendly and accommodating. The manapua is the best I have had. Makes regular char siu bao look terrible by comparison."], ["Ju F.", "A little ghetto and unappealing to get food in this tiny hole in the wall place in Chinatown next to river of life but they have really really good half moon! Wasn't too impressed with Manapua or pork hash but their half moon had great taste, flavoring, and texture. So fresh!! This is definitely my favorite place to eat half moon and I will be frequently stopping by each time I am in china town. I just wish they could have places line this where I am from... Just wondering, why are a lot of good places so ghetto? Does it cost more to keep it clean.. Just wondering."], ["Kim M.", "It's truly amazing to watch these crazy, hardworking people in action. They work in precise synchronicity, like a well-oiled machine. No joke. It's actually kind of fun to watch.Get your half moon, pork hash, and manapua ON!Srsly. You can taste the difference between generic versus Char Hung Sut's tasty, freshly made morsels of goodness. No greasy, soggy, or rubbery half moons and pork hash! And I've never encountered any weird, mystery hard bits or stringy pieces in any of their goodies.Prices are set (pretty cheap) and the old-school cash register is freakin' cool.This place is great for early risers bc they open at the buttcrack of dawn. Like, the sun isn't even up yet. Great for before-work pick-up. :)FYI - Cash and take-out only, which works out bc I wouldn't really want to dine in over there..."], ["Mike And Leslie B.", "Awesome..... Simply awesome! Stopped by for a dozen pork hash thingies and i think we ate mist of them..... So delicious! Like we said before, the place doesn't look like much from the street, but the food they make is absolutely delicious. We will always come back here, for sure."], ["Henry R.", "Growing up in Hawaii this was one of the go to places when visiting china town. The Manapua, pork hash and half moons are off the hook. When entering to order, you are in the middle of the bakery. Just look for the register. Yes they make the delicious food where u order. So it confuses people. They think they walked into the back of the bakery. I have had people ask me where the front of the bakery was. \u00a0So funny."]], "Good Fortune Chinese Restaurant": [["Maya H.", "We came at a time when its after lunch but too early for dinner. \u00a0We had the chow funn, shrimp foo young & green beans. It was all delicious!"], ["K L.", "Food and services are both good but zero parking. \u00a0I especially appreciate the affordable set lunch menu priced at 7.95."], ["P C.", "My sister is this big food snob....so while she was visiting me, we ate here daily!!! \u00a0The dim sum is great! \u00a0No msg, no fatty fillings....just delightful. \u00a0You must try the Malaysian Sponge Cake! It's made like that in Malaysia. \u00a0For dinner, it's reasonable and they serve typical Cantonese but everyone loved the garlic spareribs....I am not even a big fan of pork and I still liked it! \u00a0The service is pretty good and the restroom is clean.....only thing is parking.....but not too bad!"], ["Warren N.", "Went here for lunch today after we picked up a lei. It's in the site of the old Mei Sum dim sum restaurant and later the Adega Portuguese restaurant. They have remodeled the inside and painted the walls a clean white color. The restroom area has also been redone (nice touch). We were seated promptly and given a menu. It did not appear we had our own waitress, but the wait help we flagged down did take our order for char siu look funn roll promptly. She also snagged us some siu mai and mochi rice pouches. Other wait help came by with very fresh char siu turnovers.The food was all very fresh and did not taste like it was just warmed over. The wait staff was very attentive (a pleasant change for a Chinese restaurant) and even filled our tea pot without the obligatory tipped teapot lid. All in all, they are trying hard to please the customers and give good service. The manager (maybe the owner?) even came over and asked us how things were. Wow! That's something you don't see too often in a Chinese restaurant!The food is good, but then, we didn't order any menu items...we'll just have to come back and try some soon!"], ["Emme K.", "Went here for dim sum, which was great! Nice and clean. The owner is a warm and friendly person who made our visit worthwhile. Prices reasonable as well!"], ["Jake H.", "Just opened on July 1, 2015. The place is super clean and really good! You pretty much tell the waiters what kind of dim sum you like and they will steam it up for you. :)"], ["Kyla W.", "This restaurant is new and clean. But the food overall was just okay. I tried the siu mai, shrimp dumpling, beef tripe, onion pancake, the egg tart and the ShangHai fried noodle, and everything was just okay. Service was just okay too. I also found a hair in the beef tripe :("], ["Japheth C.", "I'm not one to eat at a lot of Dim Sum places but I love this location. I love the fried shrimp balls and the fried rice. I'd also like to say that the fried shrimp wontons are delectable with large pieces of shrimp and with the amazing mayo on the side. The service is excellent! It's now a weekly routine for my family to come here and I recommend yours to do the same!"], ["Tom S.", "Stumbled into this non descript storefront while searching for bunch while visiting from NYC. \u00a0Fresh and delicious dim sum. Friendly staff and great service. I question the decor but did notice they just recently had a Grand Opening, so possibly a work in progress. Thumbs up!"], ["ed k.", "I have to agree with Ron H. on his one star rating for service. \u00a0We were given a warm greeting at the door and was seated immediately which was the only positive part of this dining experience. \u00a0The service was horrible. \u00a0A waitress comes to our table and offers us the one dim sum she had on her tray, sui mai. \u00a0We took it and then another waitress comes to us with only one dim sum on her tray, spinach with scallops. \u00a0We took it and that was pretty much it. \u00a0We waited for 5 minutes before asking one of the servers if we could order more dim sum from the dim sum menu, he says no, wait for the one dim sum cart. \u00a0Okay, we waited 10 minutes, no dim sum cart. \u00a0We stopped a waiter again and asked for the dim sum cart. \u00a0The dim sum cart finally arrives and there are only 4 different kinds of dim sum on it and all 4 were not our choice of dim sums. \u00a0What a waste of time!!! \u00a0We paid for the 2 dim sums we ate and left. \u00a0p.s. the 2 dim sums we ate were nothing special."], ["Sheila K.", "A friend invited us to try this restaurant that he loves.

I had some major sads when I first heard that Mei Sum was moving, but Good Fortune is a great replacement! I don't come back to Hawaii often, but my parents took me here when I told them that I was craving some Chinese food (mainland just can't get it right). Got the Singapore noodles, the string beans with sliced pork (gotta special request that), sizzling beef (b/c that's my go-to to judge how good a place is), garlic spinach, and walnut shrimp. HOLY MOLY SO GOOD. They also gave us some complimentary almond pudding desserts! Great service and amazeballs food.
