I love sushi and this place definitely DID NOT disappoint. It's an intimate, somewhat romantic, sushi bar/restaurant that specializes only in omakase. This means, you must trust the chef to serve you what is freshest and best for you. Oh, and dress up when you dine here. We didn't. We unexpectedly stopped by in beach attire with sand all over our feet -_- However, staff were very nice, accommodating, and welcoming and served us unbiasedly.Thirteen courses. Man, we were totally stuffed, but it wouldn't have made sense to stop the omakase at the 10th course because EVERY course was so amazing we didn't want to miss out on the next and I know there's no way to get something this awesome in L.A. without paying an arm and a leg.Amazing. Amazing. Amazing!"], ["Clay O.", "First time visit here so the recommend the omakase. I am not a huge fan of omakase, since I like to choose what I am in the mood. However, I still must give 5 stars.

Love the tastes experienced here.Dress states business casual, but dress is all over the place. They control the flow of seating, so even with reservations you might wait.

I dont however like that they force omakase. I like to spend lots of money on the fishes I like. Eating here, I was forced to eat a bunch of fishes that I didnt care for. This place is very similar to Sugar Fish By Norizawa, which is a small restaurant chain. They serve fish on warm rice.

Been to several places and always find myself back at Sasabune. Just like my experience in Japan...consistently meticulous about quality, presentation and delivery. Arigato gozaimasu"], ["Kenneth N.", "A tight 3.75 stars, I'm just being a tad tight, compared to similar omakase sushi bar tasting menu.First off, the food quality is definitely there, service and knowledge of the different servers dropping off 13 plates is impeccable, though a bit more interaction would've been nice compared to what we experienced at the bar. \u00a0It was full there so knew that over the phone, sat a table a few feet away.For the price, Vancouver has the Iron Chef, Tojo's, which offers better option in terms of setting your own budget, starting at $100 pp...but here, they were quite vague, 'all up to the chef'...while the bill came to close $300 which I had no issue, the experience was there: I'm just too spoiled lol.I fought valiantly not to post so many pics again (overkill) but needed to keep track. \u00a0Best highlights: red snapper, scallop, squid/crab, unagi/tamago and seaweed wrapped sweet onion albacore..."], ["J W.", "Red flag immediately went up with the first dish of the omakase, tuna completely drowned in ponzu and unfortunately things didn't get too much better throughout the meal. \u00a0Disappointment culminated with the tiny dried lobster tail at 18 dollars a piece which tasted like rubber. \u00a0The negiri was decent although vastly over piced. There is nothing magical about the about the omakase here, basically you are just letting the sushi chef pick dishes off the a la carte menu for you without any clue as to what you prefer(he never asked at any point during our meal). At the prices they charge, might be a better idea to just ask him what's fresh and order off the a la carte menu yourself. \u00a0 Another disappointing 4 1/2 star yelp black pearl in Hawaii, which happens way more often than it should. Over 300 bucks for 2 person lunch and very minimal alcohol. \u00a0Definitely does not live up to the hype. Try Gaku or Torae Torae for a similar meal at probably 1/2 the price."], ["June W.", "This is the PLACE for the true sushi lovers!!Defiantly a very special treat, must try and must trust!!The chef takes his career very seriously, it can only be the best when there is pride with the job!It is the BEST SUSHI ever, and I'm in LOVE with SASABUNE!Special Thanks to Sadabune family for being and serving in Honolulu!"], ["Chantee F.", "This is a late review as I went here a while ago but they are worth the wait.

Simplicity and excellence its best."], ["Debbie L.", "I've heard so many stories about this place. I love sushi, but I wasn't sure about not being able to pick my own food, especially if it included food that I didn't like. My fiance took me here for a late Valentine's Day dinner for their omakase.As we walked in, the host greeted us and took us to our reserved seats at the sushi bar. In fact, with everything I had heard, I was really nervous, not sure what to expect. Thankfully, we had a choice between the western style or the eastern style sushi. I opted for the western style which consisted mostly of tunas. I wasn't ready to try exotic foods just yet.The sushi was amazingly delicious! I have never tasted sushi like that in my life. The fish was a perfect cool temperature, while the rice was nice and warm. It instantly melts in your mouth. This was the first time I have eaten eel.. and it was delicious! In fact, every single one of the 13 dishes were amazing! If I had the chance, I would definitely return. However, I was unaware that we didn't have to do all 13 courses... so when we left, I was uncomfortably full. Next time, I'll know. :)The BEST sushi I've ever eaten! Sitting at the sushi bar definitely makes the experience worth it."], ["Alyssa R.", "Just delicious! We visited Oahu (we are from Los Angeles, CA) and wanted to find the best sushi on the island. Guided by the yelp reviews we chose Sushi Sasabune. We ordered Omakase, and were so happy with what we were served. The sushi was melt-in-your-mouth delicious! Presentation was beautiful, waiters were attentive. We were served 13 plates and were full by 11. Mind you, we eat a LOT of sushi when we have it, and so it was surprising we even got full, but if you can, make it through all 13 plates!! They are each unique.My only regret was that we weren't dressed up a little nicer to show our respect to an amazing restaurant and delicious meal (we were just coming from snorkeling that day!), but know that we were impressed and would love to recommend this place to others who will visit the island. Thank you!"], ["Lonny K.", "The best sushi I have ever had in my life is a place called Sushi Yasuda in midtown Manhattan near Grand Central. The second best is... Sasabune! (It is a distant second... but there's even more space between Sasabune and whoever is third... so that should tell you something about the Yasuda joint!)Interestingly, they're quite similar in concept. My first time at Sasabune, I found it a little off-putting; but over time, I think that's actually part of the allure. Of course, what I'm referring to is the meal-accompaniment affectionately referred to as the \u00a0\"sushi nazi.\" And if you don't know what I'm referencing with that comment, then just read a handful of the other reviews here, and you'll get the jist of it. Yasuda has their own; as does Sasabune. But I get it now... I really do! To these master sushi chefs, their dishes are not mere dishes... they are works of art; they are masterpieces... each and every one of them are unique (Yasuda more so, because they customize EVERY SINGLE CUSTOMER'S omakase, if you can imagine that!). That said, if you're an artist, and someone buys your painting... how would you feel if they immediately painted over some piece of it because they didn't like the tone or the hue of something. It might be offensive. That's how these chefs feel when you plop down their masterpiece into a brownish-green blob of shoyu and wasabi. In their eyes, you just ruined the work of art. \u00a0So that little rant aside - if this will be your first time at Sasabune, and you opt for the omakase \"chef's special,\" then expect that you may be told how to lift the sushi with the chopsticks so it sets delicately atop the sticks without the rice crumbling out, how to devour it in one bite (as opposed to biting it in half), and yes - even which sauces to enjoy it with. But...... if that sounds a bit off-putting, then think of this: there is no way any food establishment could get away with that and continue to be busy night after night UNLESS THE FOOD IS EFFING AMAZING! And it is! If your best sushi-dining experience is Genki, or Kuru Kuru, or for the high-rollers, perhaps something of the Doraku or Shokudo variety... then expect to get your mind blown by the simplicity and purity and depth of flavor of a place like Sasabune. Now of course, as other reviewers have stated... this place is not for everyone. If your idea of great sushi means add sriracha and chili-mayo and unagi sauce and dynamite sauce on EVERYTHING... then this won't be your cup of tea. You're better off sticking to Ninja Sushi by the airport (which isn't bad at all when that's what you're craving). This place is NOT that! It is soooooooo much better. Final note - if you bring a date with you, then plan to feel like a baller (even if you don't want to)... because you're about to spend like one. Two omakase's and a couple wines will easily take you over $300. Again - this is not the case UNLESS THE FOOD IS EFFING AMAZING! And it is!"], ["Anthony P.", "I'm a big fan of the omakase at Sushi Sam's in San Mateo, CA. This means that I am constantly looking to find a place that can do better. Sushi Sasabune was recommended when a good friend and I were visiting Oahu, and I've gotta say that this place is worth checking out if you are hungry and don't mind dropping ~$150 person as the omakase is mandatory. I'll just go into the highlights since the reviews I've seen on here seem to say a lot of similar things.Prepare yourself and come hungry!- I can't stress this one enough. I thought I was hungry and was feeling full around course #7. My friend was full around #5. I also fell into the trap of helping her with some of her food because she wasn't a fan of some of it. The couple next to us started 15 minutes after us and they were struggling too. I gave the guy advice not to eat his date's food so he would have room to try the rest. The wait staff will advise you on how to eat certain dishes.- We were told not to use soy sauce for some of the sushi. Not uncommon for omakase style meals since they preseason everything for you. - This one is kinda funny, but the waiter told my friend to eat certain pieces in one bite so that you could get all of the intended flavors.Did I mention to be hungry when you go here?- I was ready to tap out around #10. My friend had given up and was just taking one bite out of everything. I saw some reviews later on that mentioned you could ask to not have every course, but I can't confirm if that's true or not and how that would affect pricing. Would I go back? Yes! Food was high quality, the staff was attentive, and there's a certain Wow! factor to this place. Good for special occasions or a very nice date."], ["Jeff L.", "This place was a breath of fresh air compared to 4 star yelp rated sushi places on this island, but that's expected when it is a bit more expensive. But even accounting for its price point and for the name's reputation it did well. And the service was very attentive.Sitting at the bar, we were offered a choice between \"Eastern\" and \"Western\" omakase. The more adventurous (ie do you like uni and ikura?) are encouraged to pick the eastern omakase. \u00a0There were 5 of us and three who like uni, but only two eastern courses available. My little brother got the short end of that stick.The people eating the western courses had a good time - they were more straightforward fish and oyster dishes and many of the 13 eastern and 13 western dishes were actually the same.The red snapper nigiri garnished with fermented fish intestines was really good. \u00a0Score another one for Tyler Cowen's point about how if something sounds disgusting but is still served in the restaurant it must taste really good to make up for grossing out a certain percentage of guests who never try it. There was no food menu at the bar but if you somehow have room for a la carte orders at the end see this dish is available!This place is relatively strict - no soy sauce was even on the table for a customer to potentially ruin the fish. When one person was getting full and trying to eat just the fish from the rice they were chastised by the chef who told her that the experience was how the fish balanced with the rice - but then he offered to make most of the rest of her courses sashimi when they involved merely fish and rice.Four stars instead of five only because there were a few too many merely good courses and not enough bites like that snapper (the abalone served in the eastern omakase was also great). It's definitely worth the trip here vs going to the slightly more than moderately priced sushi places preying on tourists in Waikiki."], ["Victoria R.", "This is our second time dining at Sushi Sasabune. We made our reservation online but the restaurant prefers an additional confirmation as well. I phoned in our confirmation and requested seats at the bar. If you don't make a specific request, online reservations automatically get table seating. We arrived on time and only had to wait a couple minutes to get seated.Our main sushi guy was Kyle (aka Shinji/Shitake) who was wonderful. He was super fun, knowledgeable, and explained everything. The food was great and since it has been described in depth in so many reviews, I won't repeat all the same info. Suffice it to say, the fish quality was excellent and though sushi on hot rice isn't what we're used to, it really works. Service was attentive and the food came out extremely quickly. Last time we ate here, we ate the full omakase menu. This time, my daughter and I tapped out after 9 courses and my son did 11. Our bill had one error where we were overcharged for something we didn't get but they corrected it when we pointed it out. We only drank water and had no dessert so after a $70 tip, our total bill was around $430 for a party of three.The spoiler for us was near the end of our meal. The host seated a party of four right next to us. I smelled them before I saw them. The overwhelming stench of cheap perfume was like a slap in the face and it actually made me gag. We were at the end of the large empty sushi bar. I do not know why the host seated them RIGHT NEXT TO US. I don't hold the restaurant responsible for the inconsideration of its patrons but the host should not have ruined our evening by placing them adjacent to us instead of in any of the other empty chairs farther away. Instead of having a wonderful, memorable meal, I spent $430 and I'm miserable and upset because I can't get that stench out of my nose (hence four stars instead of five as in my previous review of this restaurant)."], ["w t.", "What happened to my once all-time best sushi place ever?! \u00a0Even my friends who have been there recently mentioned that quality has dropped off. \u00a0Jamaican lobster was overcooked (where's the South African almost raw lobster?). I know it's omakase but big dropoff in quality. Albacore roll at the end - maybe slightly better than something you get out of canned tuna. There were 3 other dishes which weren't quite up to par. \u00a0Yes, I'm being hard - but I'm hoping that our Sushi Nazi will step it up again."], ["Andy M.", "Omgosh, just trust them. They will not steer you wrong! After I came back from being in Japan for a summer (specifically Hokkaido where sushi is beyond amazing), I was told that I was ruined for all sushi in the US. This place has done me in; I will never eat sushi again without dreaming about sushi sasabune.If it melts in your mouth, you know it's legit. At the end of the meal I felt like I could just fall asleep satisfied while sitting upright in my chair. The dessert...oh the dessert. Try the house made green tea flan (pudding). Delicioussss and a perfect item to complete the meal. Omakase all the way. For two people going 8-10 rounds, it only cost us $150 (incl. tip). We thought it would cost wayyyy more. Also, sit at the bar so you can talk to the chefs and watch them work their magic.

I can say with confidence that Sushi Sasabune not only has amazing service, the food itself is indescribable. Nigiri sizing, rice to fish ratio, cut of the fish, quality of the ingredients; you can really tell that the chefs are passionate about their work and strive for perfection.

You would never think in a tiny restaurant in a strip mall on King street that you would be transported back to Japan. We took on the 13 course Omakase. I have to say we were told there is not any noodles, no tempura, it is sushi so if you are looking for a variety, go elsewhere. The chef provides what he believes you would like. You don't believe that sushi would fill you to the brim but it is a LOT of food. It felt like going on a tour of the world with all the different fish. The first bite I knew it was going to be amazing because the plate of sashimi just literally melted onto my tongue. The service was really superb, on point but the guys weren't stuffy and would crack a smile every so often. They moved quickly around and took plates, filled glasses and I liked how they took the job serious it made me appreciate it even more. We sat at the bar and I was mesmerized by how deft Chef's hands were at forming the sushi each one right after another. Yes it is going to be on the pricier side of sushi but like the sign said....Trust me. I did...and happier for it. Felt like we floated out the door. I hope Chef enjoyed his beer."], ["MR T.", "Simply amazing. I don't know about all the hype of the chef being a nazi but the food is amazing.

I had never been here before, but always heard wonderful reviews from friends. When I made the reservation over the phone, the worker suggested we sit at the bar to fully experience Sushi Sasabune. He also suggested we order the omakase, \"trust me\". I can say, that both suggestions were spot on and I would also recommend first-timers to do the same. First off, sitting at the bar allows you to watch the chefs as they make the dishes. These same chefs also serve the food to you and explain exactly what you are about to eat and how to eat it; usually in one bite. Secondly, ordering the omakase and not knowing what dishes we were going to be served was very exciting. It was sort of like receiving 13 gifts! That being said, although the sushi was great, I do need to say that some pieces of the sushi were loaded with wasabi and definitely made my eyes water and sinuses clear up! Overall, a great experience at Sushi Sasabune. Service there is outstanding! The staff are so attentive and so polite, 10 stars for them!

Me and my husband ordered the Western version of the Omakase and it was really good. The salmon and scallop sushi stood out as they were so soft and tender. Also, the squid was also really good. The quality of the fish is really soft and just melts in your mouth. There were some that was ok. I think people hyped this place up a little too much and I expected a lot more. It was good overall.

I can't give it 5 stars since I've had better sushi in Tokyo and the SF Bay Area, but Sasabune definitely serves great quality fish (and rice)!We managed to get through the entire 13-course omakase meal; when you factor in the fact that each dish contained at least 2 pieces of very fresh, high-quality seafood, the omakase actually is a great value! While Sasbune doesn't serve Americanized jive rolls, they also don't serve completely traditional sushi as some pieces have other ingredients (such as fried garlic chips and specially-ordered-from-Japan hot sauce) to complement the flavors of the fish. I'll spare you a fish-by-fish account and just summarize with: great fish; we preferred some dishes over others, but have no real complaints.We sat at the bar and service was great as we enjoyed chatting with the assistant sushi chef (as the master chef sternly and quietly observed). I tried offering them sake but that apparently is not allowed in Hawaii - go figure. :) Regardless, I appreciated the generous pours of sake they gave me, haha!One of the neat things we learned is that they don't accept random drop-ins at the restaurant: they prepare a set amount of rice for the exact number of guests for each meal. Talk about keeping high standards!"], ["Leslie B.", "Recommend sitting at the sushi bar & enjoying the Chef's creations. We enjoyed every dish that was presented & liked how each dish was explained.

In terms of sheer quality, it is possible that it is up there for the best sushi I have ever eaten. Was it the definitive sushi experience? I am not sure. I still think sushi can get even better. That said, in the end I was pleasantly surprised that dinner did not break the bank, and thus is definitely worth a visit if you don't mind spending a little more for a good quality meal. I had some beer and also shared a bottle of sake and the final bill seemed more than fair. I ordered the Omakase, and thus what I tried was up to the chef. The dishes received varied from classic nigiri to sashimi in ponzu and baked clams. Some general observations: the rice was nearly perfect, the wasabi was extremely delicious, the fresh fish very tasty and subtle. If I had to express one small critique it would be that a lot of the fish dishes were topped with ginger, shiso leaves, and green onions. These bold flavors, while a good compliment, did mask some of the more subtle flavor of the fish. If you are a fan of sushi and are in Oahu, it is likely a must-visit."], ["Angie H.", "My husband took me and our son (7mos old) there for a dining experience. \u00a0We certainly got what we asked for. \u00a0The food was delightful, however, they did not have any high chairs for babies so we had to hold our son on our lap throughout dinner. \u00a0Not ideal. \u00a0Then, about half way through, a waiter came to our table and scolded me for taking bites out of my sushi. \u00a0He said, \"Excuse me but it is considered bad etiquette to bite the sushi. \u00a0You must place the entire piece in your mouth.\" \u00a0 I laughed but soon realized that he was dead serious and was really giving me a warning. \u00a0This restaurant is known for asking people to leave if you don't follow their RULES. \u00a0 Needless to say, this left a bitter taste in my mouth after paying a $150 bill. \u00a0Screw that!!!!"], ["Kaimera F.", "Sitting at the bar and letting the chef decide was really great. I highly recommend it. I was hesitant at first when my friend suggested it but it was the best experience ever."], ["Samantha P.", "Feels like a gimmick. 13 bite sized pieces for $100. Seriously? Use to feel like they were picking the sushi just for you... Know it's a conveyer belt. Don't waste your time or money. The interior is dark and lame and now the food is too."], ["Reid S.", "Okay I wish I used my yelp before I went to Sushi Sasabune (meaning I wish I wrote a review when I actually went). A week ago, I wrote a review about Mitch's, but now it's time for me to review the sushi mecca of Hawaii. I believe I went to Sasabune 2 years ago, it was a present from my dad because I was leaving for school. I wanna leave Hawaii with a bang! So he said that I was ready for Sasabune. A lot of pressure I have to admit. It just so happens that my childhood study-abroad sister, Naoko moved from Osaka to Honolulu permanently, and works as a hostess here. So I was excited to see her once again! My dad made reservations to sit at the sushi bar, which made me a little weak in the knees because I have heard about the Sushi Nazi himself. The last thing I want to do is insult him in any way. But I broke it down: I love sushi right? Yes. I'm honored to be eating here right? Yes.So I saw no reason to be nervous. Just enjoy and appreciate the food.Branching off of my last sentence, I love that Sasabune truly teaches customers how to appreciate sushi. Sushi is not just fish on rice, it's art, it's a lifestyle, it is to be respected. So when I hear people complain about how they couldn't eat some of their sushi with shoyu, I have this to say: when you spend money to eat at a place like Sasabune, what must be understood is that the menu was precisely calculated to present the food in the best way possible, according to the Chef's ideas. So, if the instructions are \"no shoyu with this,\" instead of letting our 'food-egos' get in the way, just respect the fact that maybe shoyu isn't actually necessary here. Maybe it is better without shoyu. But I get it, no one likes to be told how to eat something, but at the same time, if instructions are to enhance the flavors and experience, why not just eat it the way the chef wants you to? Otherwise, you're not really tasting what the chef prepared. But I know most people don't struggle with this problem, I'm just...putting it out there. #RespectTheChefWhich is why you taste food before you dump salt, pepper, tobasco sauce, etc. all over it. So rude. lolOn a side note, I'm noticing that most of the bad reviews for Sasabune were from out-of-towners. Maybe it's not Hawaii, but where you're from? Food for thought. Our Japanese food in Hawaii is better than almost every establishment I've dined at on the mainland. Bold, but I completely stand by it. Anyways, I got a little off topic. We ordered the omakase, of course. And one by one, the dishes of sushi arrived. You know you're about to eat something incredible when your heart starts to flutter a bit from excitement. Well, I felt that all night. And then the food arrived:1) Abalone with Ocean Seaweed Salad2) Toro Nigiri prepared in two styles3) Hamachi Nigiri4) Aji + Saba Nigiri5) Salmon + Scallop (with yuzu) Nigiri6) Amaebi, Hirame, and Raw Oysters7) Soft Shell Crab, Taco, and Ika + Mentaiko Nigiri8) Uni + Ikura Nigiri9) Egg + Cooked Anago10) Negitoro Roll11) Prawn Miso Soup 12) Green Tea + Azuki Bean Ice Creamand my dad ordered sak\u00e9 from Nagano and Hiroshima, appropriate because my mom's family is from Nagano-ken and my dad's family is from Hiroshima. Too bad I was under 21, but at least my dad enjoyed it.All 12 courses were scrumptious. It was like a tour of the ocean. Brutal maybe for the ocean and its creatures, but pure heaven for me and anyone who eats at Sasabune.After eating at Mitch's I realized that Sasabune has them beat in the sense that there is concept and aesthetic here. You know and feel that you are eating the highest grade seafood, and in the midst of it all, the sushi chef observes his restaurant, with his arms crossed and a stoic look on his face. He rarely smiles, but somehow you know there is so much passion within. \u00a0When we were finished with our meal, my dad and I bowed towards the chef and his sous chefs, thanking them for a brilliant meal. \u00a0By far, one of the best meals of my life. And I have a feeling it will be difficult to top it. 6/5 stars."], ["Tweet T.", "I have had a lot of sushi in my life from other cities and countries; including Japan and boy o boy this place deserves a 5 star.

However at night, it is very hard to see their black sign! We had to call the restaurant to ask where they were because we didn't see it lol!! Luckily, we were able to find parking in that tiny lot.When we arrived, we were hungry and quickly ordered: truffle teri edamame, ahi poke, spicy tuna tartare, kikune pork belly, Cali roll, bakudan maki, chawanmushi, and I also asked the server if the chef was able to make the dashimaki tamago... And luckily he said ok! TRUFFLE TERI EDAMAME: SO insanely addicting!!! I never would have thought to pair teriyaki and truffle oil on edamame... I loveee truffle oil so I was happy that the truffle oil was noticeable (unlike some restaurants where uou taste nothing).. We loved this so much, we ordered 2 orders \u00a0lolSPICY TUNA TARTARE: this dish was creative and unique and the flavors matched so well with each other! Spicy ahi on top of guacamole accompanied with a small raw egg on top and served with deep fried nori \"chips\". I was a little hesitant with the egg, but it was good...so good that my bf ordered one just for himself LOLAHI POKE: nice and fresh CALIFORNIA ROLL: basic but delicious, the spicy tuna roll was accidentally given to us for free but that was good too. My bf loved the Cali roll so much as well, that he ordered another oneCHAWANMUSHI: reminds me of my childhood...even with all the delicious food, this was one of my top favorites!BAKUDAN MAKI: filled with seafood and is filling, but to me I'm not a fan of deep fried sushi so I found it a bit heavy and it tasted like there was cheese in it? Which I didn't care for with the seafoodKIKUNE PORK BELLY: by the time this came out, I realized I was full and my bf and I realized we ordered too much lol!! Anyways, I still took a few bites, and the pork belly melted in my mouth and went great with the onsen egg. The white thing in it (not sure what it is but it tastes pickled) tasted weird to us and we didn't eat it lolDASHIMAKI TAMAGO: unfortunately since we ordered too much, and since this dish does take awhile to make, we were stuffed when it came out! However, I ate one piece and it was delicious! The egg was light, airy and a little sweet and it was filled with unagi and cheese that oozed out. It came with mayo, dashi, and green onionOverall, this place was SO good! And I think my bf and I found a new favorite. However, next time we know not to order more than we can eat (at least we had lunch today lol). Also, service here was great, and the server (I think her name was Sunnie) was really sweet and even packed our food at our table even though we said we can do it.

This restaurant is very popular with locals and tourists alike, but I still deem it a find since there are so many Japanese sushi places out there.

Our waitress was very nice and suggested some popular dishes for us to try for our first time. We ordered the Spicy Tuna Tartare, which was delicious and came with too few seaweed chips to dip in. The spicy tuna roll was also very delicious! The Pork Belly Kakuni was like butter, super tender and flavorful. We also indulged and ordered the o-toro, which was super fatty and fresh, although a bit sinewy. My favorite of the night, however, was the hamachi carpaccio! Melt-in-your-mouth good with a nice kick to it! One thing I do want to mention is the amazing decor around the restaurant. I guess the artist is a friend of the owner, but her work is amazing! If I had money to burn, I'd definitely buy a piece! Reservations are recommended, as I hear it gets very busy. Parking is extremely limited, so come early or risk having to look elsewhere.

If the beer isn't iced down and super ice cold, in frosty mugs, that's already not authentic...many lower caliber izakaya in Hawaii will only refrigerator chill the beer...that's not enough. Torae however does beer right, including frosty imported Asahi draft beer...a true taste of Japan which is great.The food is fairly priced but uniquely and expertly crafted...for instance, all Izakaya have gyutan, but only Torae places 8 thin succulent slices on a large bed of thinly sliced white onions...you pinch the onion between a a slice of gyutan, dip in the sauce and it's heaven.Their sushi is delicious but also beautiful...they're not trying to whip them out too fast where the rice isn't even pressed and holding together well...they craft with care and it comes through in the balance of vinegar, shoyu, and that hint of wasabi...just enough to make your nose tickle...but not enough to make you tear...Nigiri sushi is buttery and melts in your mouth...truly delicious and the right hand pressed temperature so the subtlety of the fish and flavors pop just at the right moment...you sigh a relaxed and satisfied sense of relief that it's as delicious as you expected.It also helps that the izakayas owner us the lead sushi chef and is front and center ensuring his patrons are tended to and happy...his serious sincerity shines through and makes the amabiance alive with authentic Japanese craftsmanship.and quality service...Torae Torae is now in my top 3 favorite izakaya in Honolulu...but one star off for horrible parking."], ["David Y.", "Great service and great food. We didn't bother looking at the menu, instead looked at the photos from yelpers and went with all the favorite dishes. Tried to order the Dashimaki Tamago but the chef wasn't making it tonight. Overheard another table wanting the same but was told the chef made 5 the previous night and decided to take a break for tonight. For two we ordered 9 items. Turned out to be one roll too many between a light weight and a heavy weight. Originally I had the Pork Belly Kakuni and the Pork Belly Don on my list but was told by the waitress to just order one since they're both similar items. The broth in the Kakuni was good but with the soft egg, the don would have been better. Pork Belly Kakuni: Tender pork with a nice melt in your mouth belly fat. The pork was slightly tough but still very good with the broth. 8/10Spicy Tuna Tartare: The spiciness is very subtle and does not overpower the dish. Melt in your mouth texture. The guacamole under the tartare added additional creaminess to the dish. 10/10Hamachi Carpaccio: Melt in your mouth Hamachi with right amount of green onions and a hint of spicy pepper on top. The Hamachi was the star. 9/10Ahi Tataki: Essentially Ahi tuna carpaccio. Better than the Hamachi as the Ahi tuna was like butter. The freshness to this dish is unbeatable. 10/10Snow Crab and Corn Cream Croquette: Real snow crab meat mixed in with some corn in creamy potato with the consistency of puree. Two comes on a plate with half of each drizzled in a katsu sauce. The sauce gave it more flavor, otherwise the croquette was light on its own. 9/10Mini Negitoro don with Uni and Ikura: This is more of a customized donburi with the addition of uni and ikura so the price was adjusted for the customization. Fresh and buttery. Rice was cooked to perfection with just the right amount of rice to mix everything in with ponzu sauce on the side. 10/10Jidori Chicken Karaage: Good but nothing to write home about. If you've had good chicken karaage before I'd skip this and order another spicy tuna tartare. 8/10White dragon roll: Like another reviewer said, the garlic chip overpowers the hamachi. Actually the truffle oil overpowers the garlic chip. This would be a good option if you like the taste of truffle oil. Good roll but not as enjoyable for me as the Red dragon roll. 8/10Red dragon roll: spicy tuna inside and unagi on top. The spiciness of the tuna is very subtle. The sauce that's drizzled on is spicier. 9/10The rolls portion of the menu just had the names without the description. Our waitress had to explain to us what consisted of each roll. In the end it came out to be about $65 per person. We could have done without one of the rolls. Not a bad price for great service and quality. Come early for the limited parking spaces out in front."], ["Jenna D.", "This place and chefs are amazing, the food is fresh and innovative. I was so hungry after being out all day and skipping lunch, so ordered something pricey off the nightly special menu with uni and fish eggs.

Comes on a bed of rice, seaweed strips, shiso leaf, wasabi, and ginger. + MANGURO... BRAHHH---- the best I've ever had. Amazingly THICK and well worth the price. Must try!

Again, I mentioned above that I have not been to a lot of sushi restaurants, but, I have always believed the fish should be cold. \u00a0 The warmth of the fish made the texture very weird in my mouth and I was not the biggest fan."], ["Paul C.", "After a good but somewhat disappointing dining experience here I made it back the other night. \u00a0 I had assisted a friend \u00a0with his taxes in the Kapiolani area and wanted to grab an early dinner. \u00a0 He wanted Japanese food and I wasn't keen on going to Waikiki so we came here. \u00a0 What a great decision that was.First of all, this place opens from 6pm so we arrived about 20 mins prior to opening and decided to wait. \u00a0I was quite surprised to have seen so many couples come for an early dinner only to realize they weren't open yet so we waited patiently.At 6pm the mad rush starts and about 2/3 of the restaurant fills up. \u00a0We didn't have any reservations so we didn't mind sitting in front of the sushi counter. \u00a0Personally, I enjoy seeing the sushi chef in action and I get to spy on the fresh seafood for the day!They no longer have OMAKASE courses where I didn't care for them as I prefer traditional Japanese food without teriyaki sauce, mayonnaise / aioli dressings so this time I ordered ala carte and had:1) UNI & IKURA donburi (5/5)OMG - - this is almost better than you know what!!!!!! \u00a0Talk about having a foodgasm at the sushi counter \u00a0They had Japanese UNI that day, where the roe is smaller but so rich and creamy. \u00a0I personally think the Japanese UNI is more flavorful so this was a home run in my books. \u00a0The IKURA was really fresh and enjoyed the roe popping in my mouth. \u00a0I'd give this dish 100 stars!!!2) KAKUNI (5/5)I've been told by the head chef Hideki Yoshimoto that his sleeping time is cut short due to making this dish. \u00a0I realize this is a time consuming dish and wow, this was also a winner. \u00a0Huge chunks of belly pork have been simmered for a loooooon time to have it melt in your mouth. \u00a0Served with stewed DAIKON and a soft boiled egg. \u00a0So refined. \u00a0So tasty. \u00a0 WARNING: \u00a0There is a limited amount of this dish each day so I highly suggest you pre-order if you want to eat this.3) Grilled SABA (5/5)Although this fish took quite some time to come out of the kitchen, it seems that it is grilled-to-order. \u00a0It came out piping HOT and the outer skin was so crispy. \u00a0Served with a lemon wedge and some grated DAIKON and ginger, all you need is a bowl of rice to make me happy.Because the 1st time dining here was so disappointing I wasn't keen on rushing back so it took about a year to try this place again. \u00a0Food was EXCELLENT and I see myself wanting to dine here again.Service that night was excellent as the waitress came back to check on us repeatedly and refilled out water and tea cups. \u00a0Overall, a SOLID 5-stars. \u00a0I highly suggest you make reservations when dining here."], ["Vivian L.", "Izakaya Torae Torae is probably my new FAVORITE Japanese restaurant on the island. I made reservations here for two the day before for 6 p.m., and to be honest, we (as in us and the restaurant) did *not* get off to a great start. We arrived at 5:45 but got parking right outside since we were early. The restaurant opened at 6 p.m. sharp so we went in to get our table. When we gave them our reservation, they couldn't find us on the reservation list. I am not a patient person when it comes to dining, so I already felt myself easing towards irritation. Their manager (I believe) came over to apologize for the mix up and told us she could not give us a table. Then she asked if it would be okay to seat us at the sushi bar counter. I said it would be okay and they added an extra chair for us. It was a lot squishier than I had liked.Despite the mixup, the service we received the rest of the night was impeccable. The same woman who seated us took our orders. Although it seemed as though she was rushing us to put in our orders, she kindly let us know that she wanted to get our orders in so we wouldn't have to wait for the food when the crowd comes. And (of course) the crowd came. The restaurant filled up in 30 minutes.For appetizers, we ordered the Lollipop Roll, Ahi Tataki, and Spicy Ahi Tartare. I loved how refreshing the Lollipop Roll was, with fresh fish and the strong taste of shiso wrapped with cucumber. The Ahi Tataki was amazing, too. For our main dishes, we ordered the Red Dragon Roll and White Dragon Roll. The Red Dragon Roll tasted very similar to the one at Doraku Restaurant. However, the White Dragon Roll with the hamachi and garlic chips was out of this world! I really enjoyed it!I can't complain about the prices either! Worth it for the quality and amount of food. I was very pleased with my first visit and can't wait till my next one."], ["Stefanie C.", "For someone who is not from Hawaii, THIS is fresh sushi. Make a reservation or call ahead to make sure there is a table available, especially if you are bringing more than four people. Go for an early dinner because Izakaya gets busy closer to 8:00PM. Once you are seated, the fun begins. Prepare to pamper your tastebuds!I would highly recommend the Hamachi Carpaccio and the Lollipop Roll to start. For a group of six people, we also ordered the assorted nigiri and sashimi. Those dishes were enough. Honestly I think you could get anything from the menu and it would taste freaking amazing. I would say you end up waiting a little longer than your average restaurant for food, but that's the price you pay for fresh fish. Our waitress was incredibly educated on the menu. She could tell us where all the fish was from (local or imported) and gave us suggestions on what to get. We ended the meal with black sesame ice cream, which was okay. Always good to end meals with something sweet. I'm definitely going to try other sushi places on my next visit to Hawaii but if you end up coming here, you will not be disappointed!"], ["Trung L.", "My GF and I came here on a saturday, they take reservation. \u00a0I've been into trying Izakaya places as of late, and this place certainly hit the spot. \u00a0Fresh fish, creative dishes.Dishes that we had that I liked:Hamachi carpaccio - Presented nicely, and tasted just as goodBeef Tongue - Lots of flavor, could prob go lighter on the peppers though.Otoro Nigiri - Melts in your mouth Toro, was delicious.Uni nigiri - Good Uni.Hamachi Kama - Go for the Large, was grilled nicelyDishes that we tried, but didnt hit the spot:Agedashi Tofu - was kind of bland, could have given us a spoon to eat with though.Tako Wasabi - Raw RAW RAW, and is very strong with Wasabi. \u00a0Cold, slimy, and \u00a0had alot of Wasabi.Watercress - was a cold dish, didnt like it as much."], ["DrAl 8.", "Wanted to try this new izakaya for over a year, just never could get a reservation due to its small amounts of seats available and limited parking. \u00a0Finally get a seat for us tonight. \u00a0Menu:Shio TongueHanpen CheeseWhite Dragon rollSpicy ahi tartare Hot udonPork belly donStamina donChiwamushi Overall food is 5 starsService 4.5Limited seats 3 starsParking 3 starsTherefore 4 star experience.

I've had this place bookmarked for a while now and finally made it out there since I was craving for some Uni and Toro. First tip: make reservations! I called them before they opened and they had countertop seating open. If you have a larger party, I suggest you call several days ahead. Parking is limited. There are a couple of stalls of to the side of the building reserved for Territorial Bank, but only until 6pm. There's always street parking, you'll just have to walk a little. The service was great. My waitress was attentive. Always came by to check up on me. But not too excessively. Which is a good thing. Sushi chef was also very attentive. Would check in with me every now and then to make sure I had what I needed. Great job for service. Now let's get to the food I ordered: - Tako Wasabi: Interesting taste. It's raw. Soaked in wasabi. Not that it was spicy, the texture was interesting. Slimy and chewy, is how I'd describe it. - Tan Shio: Of course I'd get this. I love beef tongue. Grilled nicely, ponzu on the side. Spritz a little bit of lemon on top and you're good to go. I did enjoy this, but it wasn't outstandingly memorable. - Uni Ikura Don: If you love Uni, you'll be sure to like this. It is a very generous portion of Uni and Ikura served over a bed of rice. It totally hit the spot with my Uni craving. - Spicy Tuna Tartare: I love spicy tuna. I love avocados. Great combination. The fried nori and crispy won ton made it even better. Definitely try this out. And yes, I did get my O-toro fix satisfied too. Although I will say, it was good, not great. Not memorable. I've had better. All-in-all, I had a good evening. The prices are reasonable. Food was good. Place was clean. Service was excellent. I'd definitely come back. Enjoy!"], ["Grace L.", "After my second experience, I unfortunately had to reduce a star. \u00a0The food is still AWESOME, the uni is extremely fresh and everything is still so good.However, the 1 star reduction comes from service and cost. \u00a0I really think Torae needs to hire another host/server because there was only one employee tonight and she was really busy. We asked for green tea at the end of our meal but I guess she forgot because it was so busy. \u00a0It is understandable given the dinner rush but I mean if you're so busy that you're forgetting orders, it probably means you need more people working.Last time we went, which was about 6 months ago, the uni/ikura don was $10. \u00a0I thought that was really well priced for the portions and I was so happy that I could get my uni fix without breaking the bank and also getting to taste other appetizers because the portions are smaller. \u00a0The price has gone up to $13. \u00a0I suppose $13 isn't THAT expensive for an uni/ikura don but a $3 increase still seems pretty large to me. \u00a0I'm not entirely certain but based on that alone, I assume other dishes had a price increase as well.My friend and I tried some new dishes (that I didn't try last time): Hanpen cheese, crab croquette, and dashi tamago.Hanpen cheese: Fish cake with american cheese ($5). \u00a0I thought this dish would be awesome because hello, everything is greater with cheese! \u00a0Unfortunately it was nothing special and it tastes like regular fishcake with melted american cheese.Crab croquette: I really enjoyed the rich creaminess of the inside of the croquette. \u00a0You could tell there was real crab inside instead of just fillers. \u00a0The outside was nice and crispy, which complimented the crab mixture on the inside.Dashi tamago: \u00a0We honestly just wanted tamago. \u00a0The sushi tamago that is apparently traditionally served as \"dessert\" at Japanese sushi restaurants. \u00a0I never order tamago nigiri but I just wanted the fluffy egg cake (minus the rice). \u00a0I guess we weren't clear on what we wanted because the dashi tamago was NOT the sweet egg custard we were thinking! \u00a0It was made with the same tamago but stuffed with cheese and unagi? \u00a0Don't get me wrong though, we may have ordered the wrong thing but this dish was DELICIOUS. \u00a0Only downside is that it was $9 for 8 small pieces. \u00a0I would definitely still order it again though!We realized that you could park at the bank across the street if there is no parking in the tiny/terrible torae parking lot. \u00a0Make sure you have dollar bills because it's $3 for night time parking. \u00a0It's worth it I suppose if you really want to eat here and/or you get parking anxiety because that tiny lot kind of sucks.The food is still pretty good but I'd say service has gone down and prices have gone up. \u00a0That combination definitely can't be good..."], ["Noel H.", "Overall, good food and service, but unfortunately, they were out of ama ebi! Anytime I go to an Izakaya or sushi restaurant, I have to get ama ebi sashimi and munch on the fried head! Maybe it was because we went on a Sunday, but they were also out of the regular uni (we had to spend a dollar extra for the \"one from Japan\") and regular sized Hamachi Kama (normal price ~$15; we had to pay for the \"large\" for $20). Don't get me wrong, everything was delicious, but I was pretty disappointed that we had to be flexible with our desires. So, if you're expecting a full menu, you may want to call before making a reservation and ask if they're sold out of anything you're craving!"], ["Roy M.", "Simple, good food. Should get reservations if you don't you will be waiting and go a bit early since parking can be weird there. But its worth itThis place is everything an Izakaya should be - Unpretentious atmosphere, delicious food, familial hospitality. It's filled with local regulars who stream through the door the minute they open and they know each other and know the owner and everyone is smiling and happy.Only thing I didn't like was the owner/cook should dress up a bit he was wearing shorts and a polo collar shirt which he was very nice and smiling but it makes a rest look better if it was bit more classy.This place would be good for first date night outing. Again don't let the unwelcoming location and limited parking in the lot stop you. There is street parking on Young St. or CPK parking for $3For the small, rather hole-in-the-wall joint, they could rival any big establishment in terms of quality and service.

We were in town on a Sunday afternoon and decided to have dinner somewhere. We both were craving some kind of sushi and my boyfriend saw pictures from this place and he was convinced we needed to go there. He called around 5:30 pm asking if a reservation was needed. Since they opened at 6:00 pm the lady said the sushi bar was only available. Okay, perfect we love sitting at sushi bars.I swear I've seen this restaurant so many times as I drive home on McCully from work but for some reason, I couldn't picture it in my head. As we started driving up McCully, boom there it was. On the right side, right before the Shell gas station. The parking here is really tight and I can't imagine if we came at a later time, where we would have parked! But lucky for us, there was a parking stall right in front of the restaurant. As we walked in, I was surprised that the restaurant was half full. I swear it was only a few minutes after 6:00 pm. We got quickly seated at the sushi bar. They handed us a menu and asked for our drink order.We looked over the menu several times before finally deciding what to order.Things we ordered:Snow Crab and Corn Cream Croquette $9.95 - this was amazing!!! I don't really care for corquette's but this thing was delicious. The crab and corn was a perfect mix.Saba Shioyaki $6.95 - can't go wrong with saba. pan fried seasoned with salt.. perfectly seasoned and delicious! however, if you don't like the real fishy taste, you might now like this.White dragon roll $12.95 - YUMMERS!! this sushi roll was amazing. the truffle sauce made the sushi taste even better. this roll had hamachi on top and shrimp tempura inside. this most definitely was one of my favs.Daily special: Negi otoro ikura uni quail egg don $14.95 - my boyfriend was in heaven. All of his favorites, in one bowl! He absolutely loved it. California handroll - plain and simple. Can't go wrongAnkimo - monkfish liver. (not for me)Several pieces of Kampachi sashimi Some kind of sakeOverall, this place was a great pick. It could be a little pricey but what sushi place isn't.

Lucky there were seats open at the sushi bar for us. We were greeted right away.The food was really good. I was so sad that they ran out of the hamachi kama! They only have a few so order it once you sit down! Vegetable Tempura ($8.95): carrot, zucchini, shiso, lotus root, shiitake mushroom, and Japanese pumpkin served with tentsuyu sauce. The batter was light and crispy. It was really good.Jidori Chicken Karaoke ($6.95): Free range jidori chicken battered and deep fried. This was alright. I wouldn't care to order it again.Seafood Shooter ($8): Oyster, scallop, sea urchin, sweet shrimp, and ikura served in a ponzu sesame sauce. It tasted good but the shooter was extremely small. Tan Shio ($8.95): Grilled Beef Tongue. I love beef tongue! This was really yummy. It comes on a bed of sliced sweet onions and a dipping sauce. There were about 4 or 5 pieces. I wish the portion was bigger.Ahi Tataki ($3.95): So good!! You gotta get this! Ribeye Steak ($19.95): 8 oz premium ribeye beef served with a special garlic onion sauce or teriyaki sauce. I felt like we waited forever for our steak to come out like at least 30in. It came on a sizzling platter on a mix of grilled onions, bean speouts, and lettuce. There was a lot of flavor in this dish and I would definitely order this again. Shiromi Nigiri ($3.95 for 1 pc): Yum!!Overall the food is pretty good but I just wish the portions were a bit bigger.

The ahi tataki has dried garlic and garlic mayo drizzle and its addicting. I even put the garlic mayo on my chirashi don. \u00a0This meal can be very cheap or very expensive depending on what you order. Its very reasonable pricing.The interior is very nice and modern, a little traditional. They have paintings of female silhouettes doing different things which i think is awesome.

He is always trying to perfect his dishes and comes up with something new often. The prices are very reasonable for the style and quality of food, and he appeals to all types of sushi and izakaya eaters. Everything on the regular menu is very flavorful and delicious. Some of my favorites are the hamburger cheese steak, pork kakuni, chawan mushi, ahi tartar, cream corn and crab croquettes, and anything raw - sashimi and sushi. However, my ultimate favorites are whatever's on his specialty menu of the day. I remember specifically going one time to literally only eat one thing because of his post from Instagram - it was the wagyu topped with uni and ikura (BTW if you don't follow him yet, his IG name is @hideyoshi808). If he's not super busy and able to do special requests, I suggest getting the dashimaki tamago, negitoro with uni, ikura, and quail egg served with fried nori, king salmon ikura sashimi salad, and pan fried snapper in ponzu butter sauce, or ask if he has any omakase's planned. I love that Hide is always trying to find the freshest ingredients and fish that's in season. He recently did a special omakase on Matsutake mushrooms since they are in season now, and you can only get it two times out of the whole year. I'm so glad Izakaya Torae Torae is right down the street to where I live, because it has now become my go-to when I'm craving sushi, sashimi, sake, or just a fabulous meal in general.

The fish quality is good, but by no means top-tier. The small plates we got were also solid dishes, but nothing in my mind really stood out.

We ordered quite a bit, but the following were the most outstanding: + Spicy hamachi tartar. If you come here and don't order this, you might as well have not come at all. The tartar is soaked with flavor and comes with a stack of fresh seaweed on the side. Wrap the tartar into the seafood for the extra crunch and voila! Best tartar ever. + Uni wrapped in hirame (thinly sliced halibut) - for the uni lovers, this is a must try! Definitely on the pricier side, but totally worth it. + Seared toro sushi with garlic - tbh I can probably eat 10 of these.+ Gyutan (beef tongue) over a bed of thinly sliced onions with ponzu sauce. The beef tongue was flavorful and the onions added a crisp, refreshing taste. My dad's favorite!! - SERVICE & AMBIANCE -Excellent service, chef came out a couple times to personally serve the food and give us more recommendations.

I'm sure sushi chef thought what dummy eats at sushi place without wasabi. I wasn't upset at all. I really came here to feed my husband. I can't tell you how sashimi was. My husband prefers Mitch's though. Shhhhh. Their dessert was pretty good. We had mochi with Azuki, guava and peach jelly, vanilla ice cream for my boring son. The atmosphere is nice and cozy.

To me, it's about the same since I don't eat sashimi."], ["Vivian L.", "When you're only in Hawaii for 24 hours, you need to be efficient, organized, and hungry to be able to do as many of the greatest hits as possible.Our objective was to have fresh fish (specifically Toro) while in Hawaii. Sushi Izakaya Gaku was an easy decision. It offered sashimi and unique small plates izakaya style. It's a favorite among locals and tourists.We took a cab from Waikiki Beach, and it was kind of difficult to find, even after putting in the address in the GPS. There's a big, bright Japanese restaurant right next door, and we thought that was it, even though the GPS said we already passed it. The entrance is not really lit, and you have to look carefully for the signage. We called in for reservations a couple weeks prior just in case and we opted for a table instead of the sushi bar.I knew I had wanted the toro for sure, and also the spicy negi hamachi tartar after looking at all the yelp photos. We also ordered a rockfish carpaccio, seared garlic Toro, and steamed sweet potato manju with pork. Spicy Negi Hamachi Tartar+ The spicy negi hamachi tartar was our favorite that night. The bowl of tartar sits in a bowl of ice, and they give you sheets of nori to wrap the tartar with. After mixing the egg into the tartar, it becomes savory, creamy goodness. We wanted to order another one, and almost did as our dessert...Rockfish Carpaccio+ The rockfish was so fresh that it was almost crunchy when biting into it, it had such a springiness to it. It didn't have much taste to the fish itself (which was rather mild), but it was quite tasty with the sauces, oils, jalape\u00f1o, and garnishes. It was more about the texture of the fish than flavor.Oh Toro+ The plate of oh toro came with 7 pieces for $40. Honestly, and surprisingly, I was disappointed. I expected a creamy, butteriness since it's the fatty belly of the tuna. Instead, it was juicy. I don't know how to explain it except to liken it to an under ripe avocado. It's watery, and bland (but very fresh). It was wetter than sashimi that I've had in the past. I didn't care for it very much at all, and I still prefer sake sashimi.Seared Garlic Toro Nigiri+ We also got two pieces of seared garlic toro nigiri, at $14 for two pieces. I liked the seared toro more than the sashimi. It brought out a little more butter flavor, and I always like the smokiness of the blowtorch on my sushi. However, I didn't notice the garlic taste.Pork Manju+ This was our \"wild card\" and ordered it as something different to try. It was so good! the manju is a big ball of pork inside a soft, mushy mochi skin sitting in a puddle of warm flavorful broth. It was delicious.We wanted to order one more thing just to push us over the threshold between content and satisfied. We almost ordered another negi hamachi tartar, but asked our waitress for fresh fish suggestions. She asked us what types of fish we're looking for, we said something fatty. She brought out two slices of local fish (sorry, the name escapes me) and it was so much better than the toro. I usually don't like skin on my sashimi, but I couldn't even tell with this one. Overall, if you have the means and ways of getting here from the touristy beaches, please do. While you're in Hawaii, you gotta have fresh fish."], ["Kim M.", "Everything I've ever had here = great, delicious, worth every penny. OMAKASE is absolutely fab. I totally recommend it.

I appreciated the small mound of rice that accompanied each piece of fish. The uni had a watery appearance (sucked). Overall, it's okay. It's a bit far from the strip of hotels to command Waikiki prices so a bit overpriced. Stick to ordering rolls and a la cart.

The sashimi was nice and fresh, I am not a fan of uni and now not a fan of raw scallops. Both taste just like sea water to me, but some people like that. I wouldn't say this is a 3-4 person platter although it is good for sharing but as you can see, some items have 4 pieces, some have 2. So if you are getting this for 3-4 ppl, a couple will just have to miss out on a few items. If you are thinking that it will be a lot of food, it's not. 1 person voice of easily finish and eat more.

Their sashimi is of excellent quality and our waitress even informed us that some of the fish the chef prepares is straight from Japan. Can you get any more authentic than that?

After a long day of shopping, it was so nice to sit back and watch with awe as one dish after another arrived at the table. For starters, a dashimaki tamago served cold was simply presented with a generous scoop of grated daikon. While Fran C. and our friend Cathy dined on oysters on the half shell, I munched on kabocha karaage with it's delicate fried crunch giving way to a meltingly soft pumpkin. We all shared the chicken karaage with a squeeze of lemon, perfect alongside a hearty bowl of udon noodles bathed in hot broth. The two of them also indulged in sushi and tempura, signatures of the restaurant, while I was content to finish my bowl of udon and contemplate dessert.Parking is in a tiny lot adjacent to the restaurant, and we were one of the lucky ones to find a space, though most folks will have to make a few passes along King Street or Sheridan Street to find an open space.

These bar stools were comfier than most, so all was well.I didn't see the bill, so I can only comment on the quality of the food, which was incredible, start to finish, as was the presentation. \u00a0We enjoyed oysters served on a bed of ice (super fresh and slightly briny, just like I like 'em), the thing with the quail egg on top (hamachi tartar?), otoro, a savory custard, cold, pickled spinach (or some other greens), green tea, cold sake, and a not-overly-sweet mousse like dessert topped with fruit.The service was gracious and impeccable. \u00a0The staff was knowledgeable but not obtrusive. \u00a0I never thought I'd say it, but I now have my very own favorite sushi spot."]], "Hawaii Sushi": [], "Odori-ko": [], "Yohei Sushi Restaurant": [], "Hawaiiana Cafe & Sushi": [], "Akasaka": [], "Sushi Ginza Onodera": [], "Sushi ii": [], "Ginza Sushi": [], "Morio's Sushi Bistro": [["Michael O.", "Morios is an institution.

But keep at it, be flexible, and you will find yourself enjoying some of the freshest sushi in town!The best part about Morio's isn't the fish - though the fish is fresh and fantastic - it is the setting. Since it is BYO you can roll up with a cooler of sake and beer and enjoy yourself silly, but bring some to share with your fellow diners (it is quite close-quarters), the staff, and Morio himself! There is a tendency for the fish portions - always expertly sliced and prepared - to get even more generous as Chef Morio enjoys a Coors Light or two. Omakase is quite reasonable and has a few levels, one of which includes the live lobster sashimi and lobster miso soup (You have to order this ahead of time). Tasty, but I admit I had some cringe worthy moments as my lobster tried to escape to freedom right off my dinner plate as I was enjoying his tail meat. Excellent rolls and nigiri, with lots of options and a constantly updating menu (with plenty of revisions on the wall). My favorite Morio moment has to be my first time - the staff brought us complimentary shots of sake that they were passing around to all the customers - and then Morio even sent over some complimentary oysters which I had attempted to order, but which had been unavailable to those not doing the omakase (I wasn't). Turns out he found a few extra, and I got my oyster fix! That is the kind of place Morio's is - small, and hard to get a table at, but oh so worth it for the food you will eat and the people you will meet.

The place itself is very cozy, and it's pretty much like walking into Japan. \u00a0Food: \u00a0 Varieties of fish and ingredients will vary from meal to meal; Morio himself is a fishmonger by day and sushi chef/comedian by night. \u00a0He'll only serve the very best, and being well-acquainted with the fish business in Hawaii, he knows how to get the best. \u00a0Here's what an omakase is like at Morio's, course by course:1) Hamachi Kama - cooked to perfection, graced with a lemon wedge. \u00a0The meat is so moist. A great prelude to an even better meal to come. 2) Chawan-mushi - a seafood chawan-mushi. \u00a0Soft, savory, hot custard with mushroom, shrimps and topped with tobiko. \u00a0I don't care for chawan-mushi, but this was tasty.3) Raw oysters - lovely and fresh, served on a bed of ice. 4) Sashimi - Morio will take note of how many members are in your party and serve you a sashimi platter accordingly. \u00a0Ours had maguro, salmon, hamachi, and another unidentifiable but delicious fish. \u00a0The freshness of the fish was even more pronounced because it was served cold.5) Lobster Sashimi - chopped up tail meat, served in the shell of the lobster tail. \u00a0Great texture; no sliminess. \u00a06) Deep fried Flounder with bones - Fantastic. \u00a0No hint of oiliness at all. \u00a0The meat was great; moist and flaky, but the bones were the real star. \u00a0They were fried to the point where you could eat them like chips, and I wish I could, every night with a glass of wine and Netflix. Then the actual sushi:7) Rockfish- very good. \u00a0The vinegar in the sushi rice is calibrated to perfection, and it's as much a joy to eat as the fish itself. 8) Chutoro - fatty, fatty. \u00a0Don't ruin the flavor of the cut by drowning in shoyu. 9) Hirame (Flounder) - one of my favorites of the night. lightly dressed with ponzu to bring out the flavors even more. \u00a010) Shima aji - delicious. 11) Awabi - abalone, served in its own opalescent shell, accompanied by mustard. \u00a0My first time having raw abalone. \u00a0Great texture and taste. 12) Engawa - possibly my favorite of the night. \u00a0I am verklempt, and that never happens. 13) Uni - I'm not sure if my appetite bested the length of the actual omakase, but at this point, Morio asked if I was still hungry, and I earnestly requested uni. \u00a0It was some of the freshest, most delectable uni ever. \u00a014) Negitoro - chopped tuna and green onion sushi, with a gratuitous pile of extra negitoro on the side. \u00a0So generous! \u00a0If you don't finish all the little extras he gives you ... I don't know about you as a person. 15) Lobster Miso Soup - Miso soup made from the leftover lobster shells. \u00a0A bit salty, but what miso isn't? \u00a0A nice way to end the meal, while you finish up the last of the Sapporo and sake you brought. \u00a0(It's BYOB here) 16) Complimentary post-meal Nestle drumstick - so adorable I had to mention it. The singular gripe I have with Morio's is that the wasabi could be more potent. \u00a0That's it! \u00a0Everything else was marvelous.Reservations are necessary. \u00a0You will be disappointed beyond belief (not to mention embarrassed) if you attempt to walk in without one. \u00a0At that point, you can't do anything but temper your shame with an even more shameful sourdough jack w/curly and buttermilk next door at your friendly neighborhood Jack in the Box. \u00a0Morio's has a two to three-month waitlist, and deservedly so. \u00a0The little sushi restaurant that could houses only sixteen patrons; eight at the bar, and four each at two small corner tables. \u00a0I will be dreaming of going again."], ["Anna K.", "Morio's has a special place in my heart.

If you didn't get a call... \"ahh next time maybe?\"5 years later, his restaurant is still going strong with reservations booked months in advanced. There is 2 seating times, at 6 and 8:30 which allows more people to dine at his place The restaurant is still small about 16 seats, which adds to the cozy, fun atmosphere that Morio's is known for. The food is still fantastic and insanely fresh. I went there recently and had the omakase. There was sashimi (lobster, hamachi, salmon), miso lobster soup, chawamushi, hamachi kama, raw oysters, various nigiri (scallop, uni, crab with kani miso, filet mignon), etc. I ate so much I could've slept at the restaurant.

Because words can't describe the silky texture of the maguro or perhaps the fresh crisp flavors of the uni. Nor can you ever forget how bites that come out of the kitchen are just down right epic. Its a small place. Yes. So you get to know people rather intimately. However, that is part of the nostalgic charm that helps define Morio's. You aren't going to get to know the stranger next to you...well, unless you are sitting at the bar, which are some of the best seats in my book.

Omakase was great, we got uni, ahi and salmon sashimi, oysters, hotate, amaebi, toro and a bunch of other stuff I can't remember. But what I do remember was that each bite was amazing. Ordering off the menu, we got uni, salmon (I always need salmon) spicy tuna roll, onion salmon roll, hamachi kama, we even got a crab roll (poor morio, majority of the people in the restaurant ordered off the menu AND he had to omakase for two parties)..it took a while to get food but it didn't bother us at all.. we had a blast just watching him make the different dishes!!.. Plus its hilarious watching the playful banter between him and some of the other patrons. I cannot say this enough.. Morio is awesome lol!Oh yeah, you have to get the baby tako.. It is so yummerz.. Just do it. It is BYOB and sharing with Morio is always a plus.. I always see him drinking while making the sushi that I'm amazed he can do this every night. He does like to share his drinks with the ladies (he's a true gentleman) The restaurant is small.. a bar and three tables... leads to a more family/relative's house feeling. He's a blast to dine with.. and he always tells everyone to come karaoke. If I didn't have to work, I'd be down to go lol. He's always nice enough to provide dessert.. We got mochi ice cream the first time and drumsticks the last time we came.We wrote our name down for a reservation in December.. We figured three months would be a decent amount of time for us to start craving Morio's.. Pricing??.. Compared to other places I've been to, this place is well priced!..When we did Omakase, I was like \"where's the rest of the bill?\"..

Getting a reservation is the most important and difficult thing about dining here. Their books fill up fast and they fill up months in advance. I made my reservation at least 3-4 months in advance. You can call and ask what months they are taking reservations for or what day they will start taking the next round of reservations.

They were cracking jokes all night and I was constantly laughing. \u00a0Okay and now lets talk about sushi. His sushi was probably the best I've ever had in my life. Everything was so fresh and melted like butter in my mouth. We tried probably everything he had that night like: ama ebi, uni, toro, oysters, baby octopus, hamachi, and much more that I can't remember. But the best and most interesting thing I've tried their was something called \"ankimo\". Its monk fish liver that tastes like seafood foie gras. It came in a pate form and it was AMAZING. Definitely give it a try if you like that kind of stuff. If you love sushi and love a good laugh definitely give this place a try. Btw it's BYOB so bring lots of drinks for you and Morio and his staff. It'll make it feel like a party=)"], ["Inthira M.", "I used to go to Morio's for every special occasion, but then one day I called and they said they were booked through the end of the year, and then I called back and they said they were full until summer... and then I called back and they said they'll start taking reservations around a certain time of month for the next 3 months. \u00a0So, I decided to be more diligent and marked my calendar off to remind me to call. \u00a0The day they started taking reservations I called.... and called.... and called. \u00a0But finally got through and was able to book a few reservations. \u00a0I had to call back again as they could only take two at a time as it would be unfair for other people calling (legit reason). \u00a0Finally the day arrived and I was so excited! \u00a0We chose the omakase. \u00a0A little after 6:00pm the doors opened and they started seating everyone. \u00a0They already had waters and edemame out on the table for everyone and they started promptly serving us. \u00a0We had a grilled Hamachi collar, chawanmushi, ocean salad, another type of fried fish (so good, but I forget what type of fish), assortment of sashimi, fresh lobster tail sashimi (killed right in front of you... cool!), oysters (1 per person), ama ebi, and then he started serving us nigiri sushi. \u00a0He takes suggestions, but the best fish he gave us was the blue fin (at $20 for 2 pc nigiri it was worth every penny!). \u00a0Whenever you're full you can say to stop otherwise he does last call around 8:00pm and the meal ends with a soup made from the rest of the parts of the lobster. \u00a0You pay per dish for the omakase. \u00a0The bill for (2) came out to about $180. \u00a0A little more pricey than I remember, but for omakase I'm sure he wants to give you the best cuts of fish that he got that day so do you blame him? \u00a0Can't wait for the other reservations I have!!"], ["Emi H.", "My fiance finally popped my Morio's cherry. And unlike the first time for \"other\" things, this one did not disappoint! There's a four month wait list at Morio's and as fate would have it one of our friends had a reservation but gave his spots to us because he wasn't feeling well. We showed up for our 5:30pm reservation only to find out that he had given us the wrong time and it was actually for 8:30pm. Dismayed we returned home and came back three hours later.I'll be honest in saying that I wasn't expecting much from Morio's because reality rarely lives up to the hype in most situations, but I had the BEST TIME I've had in a long time! Not only is the food fantastic but it's a STEAL! We ordered an array of sushi, sashimi and hot items. At the end of our meal we were stuffed and including tax + tip our bill came out to $40 for each person in our party. Are you kidding me?! That's pure insanity.Morio's is not just great because of the food but the service is stellar and Morio himself makes a really fun drinking buddy! This is the blessing and curse that is BYOB. You drink more than what you'd usually consume at a restaurant because you're the bartender. I wasn't planning on drinking much when I got there but somehow I got carried away somewhere between glasses of red wine and shots of sake with Morio. You know the saying, \"When in Rome, do as the Roman's do.\" Well in this case it's \"When with Morio, do as Morio does,\" and you had damn well better be ready to drink, drink, drink, drink, drink. I'm not the young belle of the ball I used to be and I can most assuredly tell you that it took me a good two days to recover from my Morio induced hangover. How do you do this two seatings a night Morio? Tell me your secrets and I will make an infomercial for the masses. Next time we've decided we're going to reserve the entire restaurant,16 seats total, and it's going to be on a Friday night so I have Saturday and Sunday to recover. If you have the chance to get a reservation, visit Morio's and bring lots of friends who love to drink. Be sure to bring lots of sake to share with Morio. You will have a blast!"], ["Alan V.", "Nestled in McCully on S.King St is this very personal sushi joint that should not be judged by it's appearance prior to entering. \u00a0Permanent sidewalk residents a few feet from the front door does little to affect Morio from getting his tables booked a year in advance. Counter seats provides a very personal experience for curious eyes guessing what the Master has in mind for his salivating guests. \u00a0You won't be disappointed with any dish placed before you where prices are \u00a0determined by the current market. \u00a0BYOB and do show your appreciation to the Man and his staff who do not show any effect of the tremendous amount of sake that they so politely accept throughout our 6 o'clock seating. \u00a0I'm certain that after the 8:30 seating departs a private party continues to who knows when.

But then out came the Hamachi kama. SO TASTY. SO JUICY. No shoyu needed. Then out came Canadian oysters....made Yanagi sushi oyster shooters look like garbage. Deep fried flounder with ponzu next. Crispy bones like potato chips. Then a sashimi platter to DIE FOR!! \u00a0LOBSTER SASHIMI!!! And then several types of sushi maguro, Hamachi, salmon, clam, amaebi (with deep fried heads), A few others that I didn't know but still was so good, so fresh. And then the piece de resistance.....

The very attentive waitstaff asks chocolate or vanilla??? And you receive a drumstick Lmfao HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!! As far as I'm concerned this is THE BEST SUSHI IN HONOLULU."], ["John N.", "Hurray! I was finally lucky enough to try Morio's Sushi Bistro!Morio-san has eluded me for years. His reservation list is often months long and I now can see why. This spot easily represents the best of what Honolulu has got to offer.I came here for a birthday party of a fellow Yelper along with many other awesome Yelpers and friends. There is nothing better than great company and food. There is ample parking for everyone in the back since the restaurant isn't too big. Our whole party went omakase!Starter salad and edamame - It is like Morio deliberately lets you down with the first 2 items because, worry not, everything else that comes out is good. This is your standard greens and sea salt edamame.Chicken Wings - Its fried chicken wings and drumsticks. Standard appetizer fare.Hamachi Kama - Large piece of hamachi collar. Not the best I've had but one of the top 3.Sashimi Platter - Easily one of the best I've had. Every piece was obviously fresh, well cut, and simply delicious. My favorite was the salmon and hamachi.Lobster Sashimi - Lobster tail sashimi with rest of the body kept alive. The lobster is still moving and while some people might be skirmish, this represents how fresh the sashimi is prepared. This was my first time trying it and I loved it! The texture reminds me of shrimp.Deep Fried Flounder - Best fried flounder I've ever had. It is smaller than other restaurants that serve the same dish, but flavors are much better. The flesh is completely moist. Remember to eat the bones like chips!Hamachi and Salmon Nigiri - Two of my favorite fishes! Fresh and delicious. Not the best I've had but very good. Perfect amount of wasabi between the rice and fish. Also, the nigiri was served in a very proper temperature.Asari Drunken Clams - A Japanese favorite dish. The flavors are subtle which allows you taste the natural flavor of the clams. Clam sizes were smaller than average. Uni Nigiri - The amount of uni was quite generous. Not overly rich and sweet like some places, \u00a0but just right. If you have the same taste I have, you would definitely enjoy Morio's uni.Ebi Fried Heads and Shell - Eat the shells like chips then chomp on the head. Not a large fan of the shells, but I love the heads! I mean, who doesn't like head?Ebi Nigiri - Since the heads and shell is used in the previous dish, this is what is left over(or originally intended). Love Morio's ebi. Just melts in your mouth!'Negitoro Maki California-style - Negitoro didn't have the usual negitoro flavor. Forgettable.Lobster Miso Soup - As said in countless other reviews, the lobster, minus the tail that was used for sashimi, is made into Morio's famous miso soup. This was the highlight of the meal. Morio's Sushi Bistro represents what's great about eating out in Honolulu. In big cities, the restaurants that are normally booked for months are either highly regarded, expensive, top of the class, type restaurants. Morio's is different. It is a small restaurant, serving great food(although not top of the class), inexpensive, and with great service."], ["Dex N.", "This is a great little sushi bar! \u00a0Prices are very reasonable; however, because of the limited seating reservations need to be made several months in advance. \u00a0What makes this sushi bar even better is that it is BYOB. \u00a0We ordered the omakase and wasn't disappointed. \u00a0Dinner started off with a salad, fried karei and Hamachi Kama. \u00a0The nigiri sushi offered aji, salmon, tai, hamachi. \u00a0The sashimi platter included lobster, maguro, mirugai, and salmon. \u00a0Once the lobster sashimi is finished, the lobster head is taken back to the kitchen to become miso soup. \u00a0Of course you cannot eat sushi withou eating some uni! \u00a0The portion sizes were generous and I think prices are very reasonable...way cheaper that Mitch's and the quality of the seafood is not much different. \u00a0I think you can probably walk away from this place satisfied for about $60 versus $100+ at Mitch's. \u00a0It's also better to go in as a pair because you'll get more lobster from your omakase dinner. \u00a0I think bigger parties have to split fewer lobsters..."], ["Diane K.", "A friend took me to Morio's first location years ago and it was such a memorable experience. \u00a0I haven't been back since because I could never get a reservation! \u00a0I had originally planned to take my parents here for their anniversary in March, but May was the earliest and I called in FEBRUARY.If you want to try this spot, their books are filled until August. \u00a0In a day or two, it'll spill into September.I took my parents here last night to celebrate my Mom's birthday. \u00a0I've been raving about Morio for years and was thrilled to finally share the experience with my family. \u00a0Everything was AMAZING. \u00a0Freshest fish that MELTED in my mouth. \u00a0My FAVORITES:- Mix Fish Poke! \u00a0Oh dear! \u00a0This is heavenly!!! \u00a0*** MUST TRY!!! \u00a0This is a special, so look out for it on the white board.- Hamachi and Onion roll- Sashimi OmakaseThe two tables next to us made their reservations IN AUGUST almost instantly after they took their first bites. \u00a0Seriously, get on Morio bandwagon NOW!!! \u00a0Soon, it'll be more likely to travel to the Moon than snag a reservation! \u00a0Don't be foolish, make the call!It's BYOB here, we brought a 6-pack of Kirin Ichiban (my favorite beer) and shared it with Morio. \u00a0He really is the sweetest man, I love him!"], ["Emi L.", "Can't eat here without a reservation (months in advance, but it's worth the wait!). \u00a0And do not leave here without getting the Hamachi Kama & Lobster Sashimi!! \u00a0Trust me. \u00a0But call ahead of your reservation if you want to get these items, as Morio needs to know ahead of time before he goes shopping if you want to get these. \u00a0(But already included if you're doing omakase--so only need to call ahead if you're doing ala carte).The Hamachi Kama melts in your mouth & when I come to Morio's I usually get one order just for myself! \u00a0The Lobster Sashimi comes out so fresh (as in, the lobster was probably alive a few mins earlier) & it's moving around on the plate while you eat the sashimi! \u00a0Ours seemed like it was trying to crawl off the plate, no joke. \u00a0This order of lobster sashimi comes with lobster miso soup to conclude the meal, which is equally as delicious.Also, BYOB & make sure to bring extra sake for Morio! \u00a0He'll love it."], ["L L.", "Disregard this, tried to edit my review for our dinner Saturday 9/5/15 and somehow hit updated review by mistake. \u00a0Please refer to my previous review which has been edited. \u00a0We have only been to Morio's once so far. \u00a0Gomen Nasai."], ["Mark H.", "After reading much fanfare, I came here expecting great sushi, and Morio did not disappoint...

I highly recommend the 8:30 seating because 1) the 6:30 one you have a time limit and can only stay for 2 hours. 2) 8:30 gets personal ;)*It's a tiny ass restaurant that can only accomodate ~20 people (only 4 at the bar) so make your reservations a month or so in advance*If you can, sit at the bar so you can have more of a one-on-one interaction with Morio*BYOB and share with Morio and his staff! *Get the omakase - we had fried ahi rib cage, sashimi platter with live lobster, lobster miso soup, sake clams, nigiri plate (toro, uni, aji, salmon), and ankimo.

I still don't get what the hype is all about. I came here couple nights ago for my birthday and i wouldn't say this is the best place for sushi. I've had better. Quality of their fish isn't quite there, but staff and Morio, of course was very friendly. Ordered most of the popular dishes here and it was decent. My favorite dish was the hamachi sashimi. \u00a0Other than that, the price is reasonable! I'll come back again, but def not worth the wait."], ["Jacob N.", "If you get to dine here you're lucky. Not because it's extremely expensive, or a members only place like Vintage Cave, but because they're always fully booked!OH YEAH!!+ Fresh ingredients+ Attentive staff+ Morio himself+ Reasonably priced+ Great omakase spread+ Cozy, personal atmosphere+ BYOB+ \"Best (Amaebi) head in town\" OH NO!!- Very limited seating (about 2 dozen seats)- Always fully bookedOh My!?~ The restroom out back has a ridiculously tiny sinkI've been fortunate enough to dine at Morio's several times and each time was great. Most times I had the omakase, or chefs recommendation. This is a predetermined meal of assorted dishes selected by the chef. No thinking or decision making involved, and you get to try a nice variety of things. If you're interested in this you'll have to let them know ahead of time, like when you book your reservation, or at least a week before should probably be ok. Each time I've gone with the omakase option it came out to roughly $60 per person. Not a bad deal! Keep in mind that process will vary depending on which cuts of fish and other seafood is used, and if you have any special requests to add on. A typical omakase meal here starts off with a green salad and edamame followed by a pan fried hamachi kama (collar). You'll probably get an assortment of sashimi, live lobster sashimi and some asari (Manila) clams in a light broth. Yes, that's right. I said live lobster. The thing is still moving around as you eat the tail meat (for that dish you only eat the slices of tail meat). Now that's fresh! I know some people who don't like this dish because of that, so if it bothers you I'm sure you can ask for the moving parts to stay behind the counter with Morio. Towards the end of your omakase meal the rest of the lobster will revisit your table, but this time it'll be chopped up and cooked in your miso soup, but before that you'll be dredged up an assortment of nigiri sushi. Lately there has also been simple desserts offered at the end of the meal. Just something small and sweet like a Good Humor type drumstick, or a fresh cold slice of watermelon.You can also just order things off the menu if you know that you want specific items. Keep in mind that although the ingredient are fresh, and the dishes are wonderfully prepared, it's not mind blowingly out of this world. It's, for the most part, relatively \"traditional\" Japanese sushi and sashimi. Some have written that out lacks the \"wow factor\", but to me that \"wow factor\" isn't really needed here. It's perfectly fine the fine it is. Where the simplicity is what's amazing. They don't serve alcohol here, so it's BYOB, so be sure to bring some cold beers and sake to enjoy with your meal. Also, don't forget to bring something for Morio and the staff too. They really appreciate it. In case you're planning to follow that little bit of advice Morio likes drinking Heineken, and Miller Lite, but his favorite is Echigo. He also likes dry sake the best. The wonderfully fresh seafood, and the BYOB goodness aside the thing that really makes Morio's Sushi Bistro one of my favorite restaurants is the man himself, Morio. If you get to sit at the counter and chat with him you'll find him to be a very funny and entertaining guy. As long as you've got a sense humor I think you'll enjoy the conversations. However, during the first seating of the night Morio and crew are usually a bit more serious since they're under some time constraints with having to serve everyone in the first seating with enough time to get the place reset and ready to go for the second seating a mere two - and - a - half hours later. During the second seating everyone is usually more relaxed and things more easy going since they don't have to worry about getting the place ready for another seating afterwards. If you're thinking that you want to check the place out you'll need a bit of luck on your side. Currently they're completely booked through September, and won't be opening reservations again until maybe some time in August (is June right now!). You can also try giving them a call randomly to see if there were any cancellations. Sometimes it happens, so if you try for that may the odds be ever in your favor!If you do manage to land a reservation and need to fill a seat, let me know. I'd be down for another visit to Morio's!"], ["June K.", "I LOVE this place! First of all, you wouldn't expect to find such an amazing establishment on a bustling King Street of all places, right next to a Jack in the Box.

After reading reviews about this place and how hard it is to even get in, I can definitely see why now. The restaurant seats about 14 or 15 people at a time. They have 2 seatings at 5:30pm or 8:30pm so they would only be able to feed about 30 people per night. We had the omakase (set menu served) which is like a 10-12 course set menu that the chef serves to you.The service is great which can sometimes make or break one's experience, but the one waitress who was serving and Mo (Morio - the sushi chef) is one character. Always cracking jokes and talking stories with us like we've been friends for years. The food was out of this world. This was the first time I've tried uni (sea urchin) and natto (fermented soy beans), which are delicacies in Japanese cuisine. It was fresh and delicious and I couldn't have imagined it tasting that good! He brought out live lobsters and opened it up right in front of us and served lobster sashimi while the rest of the body was still moving... SO COOL! Then he roasted the shell and remnants up in a miso soup. OISHI!The restaurant is casual and very small, so don't be afraid to wear shorts or even slippers. It really is all about the food! Don't forget that this place is BYOB! And please please don't forget to share with chef Mo, cuz he'll be your best friend. This is no ordinary sushi place, so don't expect a genki style conveyor belt. The omakase menu is probably about a half compilation of sushi, unless you order more sushi off of the menu which we didn't do. We had brought our own sake and umeshu which we ended up sharing with Mo, who gladly shared his as well throughout the night. Such an awesome experience that would definitely be worth the wait.The approximate wait for reservations would be about 4-5 months, so be sure to book early!MAHALO MO!

This is second time to Morios and here is a break down of why the best part of the dinner yesterday was the byob sake. 1. Food was bad and I mean real bad. For the omikase price Morio is asking of diners I expected at least average to above average quality. The hamachi collar was cold, the cuts small and seemingly not fresh and the uni just topped it off as all I could taste was iodine and rotting uni. \u00a0This was a huge slide from the previous meal. For the price this should get one star, much much better places for that price point.2. And this bothered me more. It was a mainland guy who made the res for 6, last time I was there with the same amount of people and we got twice the amount of sashimi and 2 lobsters for sashimi. The only difference was I went with a local family last time. I think this a slippery slope, I mean sure an extra order of collar or tempura but one less lobster and sashimi platter for six people for omikase price, something wasn't right. We had to each grab one small piece if lobster and that was it. \u00a0Two star for valueSo there you go. Maybe it was an off day, but a couple more reviews like this and word of mouth will begin to spread."], ["Richard K.", "I have been here a bunch of times now, enough to give it a rave review. The food is great, staff is awesome and the times are always good.Eating here isn't so much as just dinner; it's more of a dining EXPERIENCE. The space is small and intimate. Everyone is usually in a good mood and the whole restaurant is buzzing, not confined to conversations at your own table but with the place as a whole. Eat at the sushi bar and enjoy joking around with Morio and the others at the bar or grab a table if you have a larger party. Again, this place is small so make reservations (pretty much required unless there is a cancellation). BYOB is definitely a plus and encouraged. Don't forget to bring some for the staff and Morio. Sharing is caring. So far, the sashimi omakase is my favorite. Red dragon roll is also ono. Still have yet to try the lobster tail but heard it's as fresh as can be (ie. still alive). Complimentary appetizers are also nice to get yourself started while you're deciding on your order and popping open the drinks."], ["Sophia M.", "I truly enjoy this establishment!! I have attended a few birthday celebrations as well as coordinated a girls night out that was fabulous! Definitely recommend to try the omakase ....you will not be disappointed. The prices are extremely reasonable, the quality of food is excellently prepared, atmosphere is relaxing, and I leave here fully satisfied every time.The restaurant is very small but i like that intimate arrangement which probably allows the chef to make sure everyone is happy. Chef morio will make jokes and the waiters are extremely attentive. You do have to make reservation in advance...I think they have seating for less than 25 people at a time so space is limited. Many acquaintances of mine will reserve the whole place on a monthly basis for the 8:30 seating so that is probably why it is so hard to randomly enjoy but I have requested them to contact me if they had a cancellation during a week that I had a friend in town and I was lucky...they phoned! We got a table for 4 and had a blast!If you want to enjoy alcohol, make sure you BYOB! Also, there is ample parking in the back. \u00a0Highly recommend!"]]}
