The worst is that I felt like there was a rock in my gut all night and now I feel really nauseous. Not good! I don't know what happened to this place, but it is not the quality that it used to be.

Overall the places smells and looks a lot better than it actually tastes which is a big disappointment to my search for decent Italian and Mediterranean food on this island.I tried the falafel and hummus.And the chicken parmesan with a Amazon wave smoothie.The food was mediocre would not return. And the smoothie was amazing.I gave it three stars for atmosphere and they did have live music the first night."], ["Malia H.", "I always see this place at Farmers Markets and wanted to try it.

It's a huge space and sometimes I think they have live bands play here.The service was ok, I told the girl it was my first time so I wasn't sure how to order or anything and she just looked at me and reluctantly told me about their plates. They have a cafeteria style ordering system and serve Middle Eastern/Indian food. You can order a mini, regular or double entree plate that comes with rice and tossed salad. I will say make sure you get their saffron rice. You can upgrade your salad to one of their daily special salads. The plates are reasonable for $6-$12. They also have a regular menus with wraps and sandwiches. They also serve smoothies and you can create your own. I didn't know what their specialities were so maybe I didn't choose well. I had their garlic butter roasted chicken and Thai red chicken curry. The food was ok but was a bit greasy. It's supposed to be healthy but I'm not sure. I did enjoy the saffron rice. I guess I should see what they're known for and give them another try. It's worth checking out."], ["Amy M.", "I had a good workout, and so I decided to reward myself by going to da spot.

I was planning on ordering a mini plate and ended up with a combo;).  \u00a0 \u00a0One of my choices was the morrocan chicken a popular favorite. It was honey, caramelized, cinnamon, based, roasted with almonds and cranberries. My second option was the lemon, herb and coconut chicken. For my starch it was saffron rice which came with a salad. \u00a0 \u00a0 I can see why the morrocan chicken is a favorite. It was tender and sweet. The sauce mixed into the rice was absolutely wonderful. I did not want that feeling to end. Now for the coconut chicken I can't say I feel the same. I barely tasted any herbs or lemon. The coconut was really light almost bland. But, the chicken melted in my mouth like butter. It would've been perfect if I had tasted those flavors. \u00a0 \u00a0 I will be back to try more of their exotic food options along with their sides!!"], ["Kris B.", "Okay, straight to business - docked a star for the following things: 1) street parking sucks sometimes bc there are a number of good restaurants nearby, 2) no AC so you hotheads out there might not appreciate that, and 3) sometimes they have live music which is awesome and cool but honestly it is ridiculously loud and makes enjoying company near impossible.Now, the food and service are still worth 4 stars! Get a combo plate and coordinate with a friend to try as many dishes as possible. They offer different kinds of rice, and the entrees change pretty much every day. Entrees include vegetarian dishes and offer all kinds of meat (though primarily chicken). The entrees also range in culture, I've seen anything from Egyptian and Moroccan chicken plates to good old Honey BBQ and dishes including Thai curry to Eggplant Parmesan. I'd recommend any one.

I can't stop thinking about it, talking about it, I think I have a crush. \u00a0On a food. \u00a0From what I've seen it's also the best priced one on the island.

Great place to take guests and have a leisurely lunch or dinner. We almost always partake of the prepared foods. But be prepared to wait if your order a sandwich or a smoothie (both have gotten high marks from my friends). I love the curries, of which there are usually several choices each day of varying levels of spicyness. There are plenty of meat and vegetarian dishes each day. I get the regular combo with two selections on tossed salad (rice and other side options are available, some cost extra). It's a LOT of food. You won't go away hungry. They manage to sneak in a lot of veggies in their meat curries, which is great. I've tried both the Egyptian and Moroccan chicken. They were fine, but I found them to be rather heavy.Drawbacks: No air conditioning and nearly no parking. Mostly street parking. Warning: Park across the street at Longs at your own risk. You may find yourself with a ticket upon your return.The 1 and 6 buses have stops nearby on King Street. \u00a0The A and 4 stop on University and you'll have to walk a bit (about 2 blocks).

I don't know how they get their food so flavorful and still call it healthy! Da Spot serves middle-eastern, thai and fusion style chicken, fish and lamb dishes. They are all wonderful - I've yet to have a bad tasting dish. Some of them can get a little spicy (so you can ask for a sample if you're nervous), but overall they are just jam-packed with flavor and the meat is so tender. They must spend a long time preparing each dish. A mini plate, with rice, an entree and salad, is the perfect dinner when I'm too lazy to cook. For this place to have flavorful entrees, and then offer tasty rice and a fresh salad is awesome. None of the food they offer suffers from lack of attention. From time to time I also like to get a pint of their homemade sorbet or get one of their smoothies. I've also hired Da Spot for catering and event twice before, and they are awesome! They have a great catering menu, and will work with you to make sure they fit your budget for the event.SERVICE & SPACE:Service is really chill and laid back. Mostly college kids that work there and they are really nice and never skimp on the portions The space is really great too. It's so open and there is always plenty of seating. I'm a little shocked this place isn't busier. The line to order is always pretty short and it's cafeteria-style, so you get your food right away. PRICE:AWESOME! A mini-plate is only $6.

I just know it's delicious. \u00a0Sorry saffron rice, you come in second place now. There are certain surcharges for food, such as lamb plates or upgrading from your romaine salad to something else. \u00a0While I can't say if the lamb is worth the upgrade as I've never tried it, I can definitely recommend the salad upgrade. I always try to get their quinoa salad and/or olives, which I love.From my experience, the people working here are very friendly, helpful when asked for recommendations or suggestions, and pretty quick with service. \u00a0Their healthy drinks aren't bad either, but it doesn't compare to their plate lunches.Super chill atmosphere and very quick, the food is totally worth it for the price you're paying."], ["Lana P.", "I used to love this place when it first opened.

I tried eating the other pieces of chicken, hoping that the other ones were fine, but they all tasted and looked questionable. I had to throw the whole thing away after two bites.

Needless to say, they fell short, as in way way short of our last spectacular visit. The normal menu is unimaginative at best. The only thing they did right was my negroni cocktail (which was probably one of the best negronis I've ever tried) and sitting us by the main window were we had a fantastically clear view of the Friday night fireworks done by the Hilton Hawaiian Village.Aside from that, eating through their menu was like forking through mud, trying to find good edible bits. They go well on presentation but the food was honestly, just boring tasting. Didn't amaze, which you'd expect for the price. It felt like they were pumping out a template of service as opposed to treating every plate as special. For appetizers, we ordered bocconcini (bufala mozzarella wrapped in speck & grilled over tomato) and roasted portobello bruschetta (marinated portobello mushrooms & artichoke sun-dried tomato puree). I thought the bocconcini sounded great...it just didn't taste all that great...it lacked so much flavour it was so plain..what happened! My partner despised the portobello bruschetta so much he didn't even eat the second slice, and he eats anything.Entree was veal cotolette capricciosa 'durini' (milanese style, roma tomatoes, bufala mozzarella, arugula & spicy orzo) and handmade pasta & filet mignon meatballs (herb tagliatelle, rustic chili pomodoro & parmesan shavings). To be honest, I ordered the pasta because I was curious to see how they were going to murder a top shelf piece of meat and turn it into a mere meatball. Sure enough they delivered on that crime. Filet mignon meatballs my rear end. I thought the pasta would make up for that because I like the tagliatelle style but low and behold it was undercooked. Come on!Desserts was cheesecake, which their daily selection was strawberry (staying in theme with their unimaginative style) and triple layer chocolate cake (oreo cookie mascarpone & brandy chocolate glaze). My partner loved the chocolate cake, apparently this was evenly well done. The service was attentive but a restaurant isn't all about service, especially when they class themselves as fine dining. Makes me wonder if the service and presentation was simply a mask to cover the bland food.

I think it was a dollar (or maybe less). I chose valet this time because it was raining and with validation it came out to 5 dollars which is cheap considering its in Waikiki.-Atmosphere: You take an elevator from the hotel lobby to the top and the view was breath taking. The lights turn off and the open glass view showed quite a lovely view. The restaurant was gorgeous and definitely shouted fine dining as you look around. The views are definitely what set the mood for the night!-Drinks: I did have a bottle of wine, but it turned out to be fairly pricey. The half bottle prices and cocktail menu seemed to be upped a little but its Waikiki. The clientele is most likely your upscale diners. But, you don't go to somewhere like this solely for just drinks, or you can just sit in the bar area.-Food: The food was the absolute best part. The fresh focaccia bread with a mango/lilikoi butter I believe was light and vibrant. It had just the right amount of sweetness, and it wasn't heavy at all but very light in fact. We then proceeded to the appetizers where we ordered 2 oysters which were fanny bay that night I think. The Lilikoi mignonette paired well with the ahi tartare and truffle oil, it made the oysters delicious. We had a shrimp cocktail as well, and I can't ever say no to a horseradish sauce! We also had the Osso Bucco potstickers with a gremolata and orange saffron vinagrette. I've never had something quite like this before. The crispness of the potstickers was just right and with the Osso Bucco against the sweetness of the orange saffron sauce made it just delicious. The Caesar salad came on the whole head which is looking to be the norm lately for fine dining. The flavor was there but, cutting a salad with a steak knife just seems weird to me honestly. It seems like a bit too much work for just a salad, though presentation made it look nice. Finally, the star of the night which was the veal! It was nice and had a crisp and outer edge which had a nice a spicy flavor to it. The balsamic reduction on top of the arugula and the bufala mozzarella cheese paired with the veal was delicious! It all came together perfectly. Overall my experience has been a pleasant experience. The prices are a bit much for me being just the normal local folk.

My server let me know that the crudo was removed from my bill and apologized for the inedible meat.Next was the house-made pasta and filet meatballs, so covered in goop I had to scrape off the sauce to the side to find the delicate pasta. \u00a0What a shame to cover up fresh pasta with so much sauce. \u00a0Have they ever been to Italy? \u00a0Doubtful, since this is an Italian-American dish, in Italy meatballs are their own course as well as pasta and the pasta is the star - not hidden under heavy sauce. \u00a0The meatballs, however, were very well made and the highlight of the meal. \u00a0I ate one (they are huge) and put all the scraped off sauce on the others to take home, eating the pasta as plainly as I could to appreciate the effort placed in a fresh noodle. \u00a0My servers, Nick and Mason, were very helpful and listened to my reviews and did their best to help, I would have sent back the pasta to be remade with sauce on the side, but didn't want to send back two dishes the same night.Almond-scented towels came out warm to freshen up - nice touch. \u00a0I watched the manager walk past my table about 3-dozen times (it was in his path), so close I could touch him, but despite my server alerting him to the issues with my food, he never looked at me, talked to me, apologized for the flaws, didn't do a table-touch AT ALL! \u00a0Something that would have been so easy, given his path, and should be done with every table regardless - especially when there have been complaints. \u00a0He was a mess, arrogant and useless - Adam I believe?The hostesses were great, they anticipated my walk about as looking for the bathroom and walked me to the area - nice.Next came the dessert, a poor attempt at a classy dessert for such a nice interior. \u00a0Another goopy, over-dressed dessert (everything was very heavy-handed, no nuance or finesse). \u00a0I ordered the Chocolate volcano - I love molten lava cakes. \u00a0The menu reads: \"dark chocolate center, chocolate pudding cake with salted caramel gelato\". \u00a0Sounds yummy, right? \u00a0Not so, souffl\u00e9 dish with average chocolate cake, overcooked - so no lava - with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top and salted caramel and chocolate sauces poured all over the top and the plate with lots of mac nuts all over too. \u00a0What!?! \u00a0No mention of nuts on the menu, what about nut allergies. \u00a0Fortunately I don't have one, but I dislike mac nuts immensely - pecans would have complemented the dish better, but still NO MENTION of NUTS and there were about 1/3 cup of them on my plate - overkill, again, and allergy issues. \u00a0A lose-lose. \u00a0Also, no finesse. \u00a0I would have sent it back but the manager had been such a waste of time, why bother? \u00a0Just never return and ensure my friends don't make the mistake of going there."], ["Kehau K.", "What else can I say but they are AWESOME in every way.

A little salt could have been great.3) Frutti di mare seafood sausage also lacked seasoning and very dry.Dinner:1) Osso buco was very dry. I swear this was cooked previous day and then reheated for 5:30 dinner service. Risotto also lacked seasoning. $44 for that? I could not justify it2) Seafood Fra Diavolo was below average pasta.

A PLUS FOR MAKING MY DRINK STRONG LOL that definitely gets a star. Food was pretty good. Ahi bruchettas were good, my pasta was good, my bf's pasta wasn't that good. Can't exactly remember what they were called though. We also had a chocolate volcano cake for dessert. That was just okay. Nothing special. Service was meh too.

I read countless reviews of this place (the good and bad) and this establishment deserves nothing short of 5 stars. It could have just been the emotions speaking for me as I got to celebrate with my significant other but I'm sure the service, food, and ambiance spoke for itself. As a first, The elevator ride up to Sarentos teases you for the beautiful view that awaits your special night. When you arrive you're greeted promptly after the elevator doors open. You're soon seated and I would suggest ordering an appetizer because the main course may take a while but who could get mad with the beautiful view surrounding you. I would recommend placing a reservation just as others have suggested to ensure you're seated upon your arrival."], ["Wayne S.", "Great place to eat the chicken was great and the drinks were strong, \u00a0 Great place to take somebody to celebrate."], ["Carolyn I.", "My man and I took my mother to this establishment last night for her birthday. \u00a0She had never been here before and was clearly enamored by the gorgeous view and swanky feel of the place. \u00a0My father came along too and was more shocked by the sticker price, but since we were covering the meal, we told him not to worry about it. \u00a0 \u00a0Between the four of us, we enjoyed some delicious lavosh and rustic-style fresh bread \u00a0and Cesar and Greek salads to start. For our entrees, we feasted on filet mignon meatballs and spaghetti, the double pork chop, the tiger prawn shrimp scampi, and the osso buco, which was my delicious choice. \u00a0ALL of the entrees were absolutely ono and amply-portioned. \u00a0Prices for entrees start at the low $20s here, but our waiter kindly informed my mother, who is a little woman to say the least, that she could order a half-sized plate of pasta for half the price, which was a very reasonable alternative.The view is gorgeous, so try to get a table at sunset. \u00a0We came just after the sun went down, and we weren't disappointed. \u00a0The service is at a very lax pace here but not because the staff is inattentive; this is a place where you drink wine and linger over deep conversation, so lovers won't miss being pestered by their servers every five minutes. \u00a0The atmosphere is very romantic, so gentlemen, if you don't want your ladies thinking that she's headed into a proposal, definitely stay clear of this place. \u00a0Expect to pay a pretty penny here (our bill came out to just over $200 with the tip for a party of four and no alcoholic beverages). \u00a0It's well worth the investment, however, because you'll walk away with a full stomach and a doggy bag. \u00a0We'll be back."], ["K C.", "The only redeeming factors of our meal was the server we had and the ambience of the restaurant. As a \"high-end\" Italian restaurant, you would expect every pasta dish to be equally amazing and flavorful, but both entrees we ordered feel short of that mark, especially my own. I ordered the penne calabrese, it had an interesting flavor, but not the appetizing kind that makes you want to keep eating. The homemade Italian sausage was extremely dry and the eggplant was overcooked. My boyfriend ordered the chicken rigatoni alla vodka which had a nice, light flavorful sauce but the cubes of chicken were pretty dry. The drink I ordered was extremely strong, the alcohol overpowered the other flavors. Our appetizers were pretty good, we ordered the calamari fritti (a little on the salty side) and the bocconcini (simple and tasty but make sure to cut it in half as it is a large bite whole). The Cesar salad we ordered was alright, I've had better. For dessert I ordered the strawberry mascarpone cheesecake which was pretty yummy. My boyfriend ordered a latte which wasn't bad. It just took forever to come out. The only reason for the third star is that we felt very well attended to throughout our meal, the view from the top of the ilikai was amazing and the live piano player made for a romantic setting."], ["Vince B.", "Oh man...I love roof top restaurants...and I enjoy special occasion meals...and I kinda liked it there. It was A-OK and a pleasant experience. I've been there twice and I might go again to listen to music in the bar and have pupus there. I might go back for dinner if someone else was paying.

Whether you are a tourist or a local you deserve to know what you are really going to get for your money.Anniversary: \u00a0As we are going up in the private glass elevator my wife says \u00a0\"We've been here before.\" As usual she was right. Someone invited us to dinner here before. I honestly forgot it completely until my memory was refreshed. So it was kinda of forgettable that first time too. Table: Most of the tables arranged to take advantage of the view. Nice view that is for sure.Drinks: I had a nice house red wine. Wife had a speciality drink listed on the menu and liked it. Daughter had a non alcoholic drink recommended by the waiter. She didn't care for hers. Waiter didn't offer to replace it even though he suggested it and she wasn't drinking it.Service: Hostesses who were efficient. Friendly experienced waiters who had been there a while and knew the menu well. A little confused as to why we had two separate waiters who were never seen together. For a while I felt like we were on that TV show where they switch waiters to see if the customers noticed. Fine dining experience? No. Bit of a disappointment on the service. Food: Appetizers were #1 calimari. I've gotten more quantity and better quality for half the price at a food truck. For real. #2 Asparagus pizza because it sounded good to me since I'm a vegetable fanatic. \u00a0It was A-OK. I liked it but was barely enough for a couple of bites. Main course: When I go to an Italian Restaurant I want Italian food which usually means pasta of some sort. I had the mushroom \"fungi\" pasta. It was good. 3 stars good. My wife got the fish special pasta which was recited by the waiter #1. I think it was Opah fish. Sounded great and the $36 price seemed fair for excellent fresh fish. The fish was shredded into the pasta. Not what I was expecting from the description. She liked it and was not complaining. I tasted it too. I was not at all impressed. But, I'll go with her 3 A-OK stars. Daughter had Chicken Pasta and she enjoyed it too. I tasted it too and it was a full 3 Stars too.Desserts: Tiramisu and Chocolate Volcano. They were also 3 stars.Enjoyment factor: We were all in a good mood and looking forward to a special occasion meal. We were not going to let a 3 star dinner get us down.

The server informed us we could sing and blow out the candles, but the General Manager would not let us cut or eat the cake since Sarento's serves desserts.

The selection of food is broad enough to manage many different appetites. There were certain items not listed on the menu as specials-- I sadly was not able to try them during this occasion.  \u00a0 \u00a0The only downside I felt was the excess charge to bring in my own personal cake for my guests birthday. I understand it being a place of business, but if the restaurant does not have the available dessert-- I think it should be acceptable to allow entry for special events as it would have made the night much more spectacular. \u00a0 \u00a0The view from this location was quite astounding. We didn't get to see the sunset from which I requested during my reservation, but I did still get a view of diamond head and a show from the top of one of the facilities near by.  \u00a0 \u00a0The food quality had definitely met my standards as I am not an avid fine diner. The grilled ahi was quite pleasing with the zesty flavors on top of very tender seared ahi. The veal Osso Bucco was quite soft and tender also as it was promised. I didn't find the sauce to be very unique or special, but hit home well as my guest did appreciate the taste of beef stew which had similarity. \u00a0 \u00a0As a student studying customer service, I will definitely give Sarento an A. The servers were very prompt and courteous-- I almost felt sometimes they came around \"too much.\" I do appreciate that they did offer my \u00a0guest a dessert provides from them since I wasn't able to bring my own.

I didn't want the mess. I opted instead for the rice plate. Generous scoops of light-yellow rice, equally generous salad (romaine, cucumber, onion, tomato - none overpowering) dressed with a tasty vinaigrette, and my choice of meat (chicken, lamb/beef, or combo). $7.50.

They also have an item on the menu called the \"Downtown Doner\" (12\" tortilla, meat, veggies, feta, sauce, $8.25). There is also a Downtown Wrap; I believe it was $7.25 & is basically the same thing as the Downtown Doner but there's no feta cheese. There's also a Downtown Sandwich and a couple other options... A \"small\" size (10\" tortilla) is also available at a cheaper price for each menu item, but why not just go all the way?In my opinion the food was great--it was made fresh & it was tasty! The workers also clearly bust their butts--that rent space is HOT inside--I guess my only concern would be that they were sweating so much & wiping it across the back of their hands...& then touching my food...maybe use some gloves?

You can not beat the price and the serving size here, especially when you consider how good the food really is. I will have to try the wraps next time. I wish they were served in pita but, oh well... you can order a pita on the side. I am in love with their hot sauce. Authentic Mediterranean food is hard if not impossible to find on this island. This place is no exception. It is not perfectly authentic. That said, it fills the authenticity gaps of some other local places. Their meat is cut in perfect strips which just feel right. The fragrance coming out of the place is an inviting flashback. I used to live in Astoria NYC which was filled with Greek food. Other Middle Eastern/Mediterranean places on Manhattan almost spoiled me. It is so nice to have a place here that really reminds me of these places.

The crab cakes are served with a salad of mixed baby greens, spinach, red onion, and calamata olives. We had French onion soup next. It's flavorful and delicious. Rather than a beef stock flavor it seems to have more of a sherry base for the soup. It's topped with cheese that's melted perfectly across the top of the bowl. The soup I think could be improved by adding the crouton sometimes found under the cheese. My wife ordered the lamb and polenta. It was delicious as I got to try several bites. The lamb shank was braised and fall off the bone tender. The polenta was made with a little basil and mint. I'd never had polenta prepared this way and thought I might not like it but the herbs weren't over powering and tasted great. I had the Alfredo Campanella with a side of meatballs.

There is no indoor seating so please please please bring a jacket! Last night was cold! Our server was super nice to us, and we noticed she recognized and took care of the regulars really well as well.

Super cheesy, dark, oniony goodness. I had the NY Strip (which is listed on the menu as Ribeye but that night they didn't have that cut), I didn't mind it was still yummy! Nicely charred, cooked to my requested doneness, and came topped with mushrooms and onions that were cooked in some kind of sherry sauce. The potatoes it came with was AMAZING! - super crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, hint of garlic. So yum! One downer to my steak (which is totally not a downer to me, but could be for some), was that there was a good amount of oil/butter on my plate under the steak - being the fatty that I am, I used that to dip my cut pieces of steak into. But some people are healthy and don't like the oil/butteryness of it all, so if that is your thing, then maybe avoid the steak? I thought it was great though.Hubby had the linguine with italian sausage. The italian sausage was good, the marinara sauce or whatever on the linguine was standard. He loved it. I thought it was just normal. Not bad, not amazing. We ended the nice with the flourless chocolate cake, they were out of vanilla ice cream so they gave us their coconut gelato and it was a delicious mix! This flourless cake wasn't dry like some that I've tried at other places, and we ended up eating the whole thing even though we thought we were \"stuffed\".

Her costume was very bright and pretty.Overall, we will enjoyed our night at Kan Zaman!"], ["Amy Y.", "I bought a groupon $12 worth of $20 food here. It was definitely worth it. Of course, a good deal has it's rules. We can only use it during weekdays Monday-Thursday between 1:30pm-4:30PM. That did not stop me. I made a reservation (required, and stated on the groupon) 2 weeks beforehand, just in case it got busy. I cannot risk pushing the dining date later because of my busy work schedule, and finding someone to eat with is definitely a struggle. When I made the reservations, the guy didn't sound like it was necessary. But I did, Monday at 1:30PM.On Monday, it was really empty. We went in a little before 1:30PM and got seated right away. The decor was really Moroccan-ish? It was a little dim. We had a choice of sitting inside or outside. I didn't want to be sweaty out in the sun nor get mosquito bites (cuz they love my blood). So we sat inside cuz it was a little bit cooler. Though I wish I had chose outside. On my way to the bathroom I passed by the outside dining and the view and set-up was really beautiful. Darn, wish I said outside. Much regret. *sigh* To the food: I ordered Chicken Kebab sandwich $12~ and my bf ordered the lamb kebab sandwich kebab. Both plates come with salad on the side. The server told us the dishes were the most popular. Wow, what a surprise. The food came out pretty quickly. It was of course hot. It was a lot of filling to wrap and to hold with hands. The chicken was stir fry? The spices mixed with the chicken was ooooo so delicious. It wasn't too salty, but just right. The lamb kebab was sooo yummy with the blue cheese. The meat was tender. The food was amazing and filling. \u00a0The guy server was really attentive and nice. After our meal he poured us drops of this flower scent aroma. I guess its to cover up the food smell when we were using our hands? I would love to come back for more."], ["Luis R.", "So I go back to Kan Zaman after a year hiatus and while the food did not improve in any significant way (see previous review) I had another issue. \u00a0 \u00a0Unfortunately I paid with my debit card and left a cash tip. \u00a0 For most customers, paying with debit is standard practice but after a couple of days I looked at my online statement and I was overcharged by $6.00. \u00a0I called my bank to dispute the charge but since it was on debit it makes things a bit more challenging. \u00a0FYI. \u00a0Use credit as it makes it easier to dispute charges should issues arise. \u00a0Well, lucky for me I had my receipt and I called the restaurant. \u00a0To be honest, they were pretty proactive and refunded me the total charge and then gave me 20 percent off the original bill. \u00a0This was a nice gesture on their behalf. \u00a0I just hated the fact that I had to go through this. Maybe I will give them another shot in the future."], ["Kaori I.", "Another great dinner at Kan Zaman \u00a0before 4th of July fireworks. We got there before 5 so it wasn't too crowded yet and be able to get cozy sofa in the lanai to enjoy beers we brought.We started with Lentil soup and today's special Mussel stew. They were both great but we loved especially the mussel stew. Its rich tomato sauce had a great essence of seafood and so delicious! We shared today's special Lamb chop and my favorite there Lamb Kebabs. The lamb chop!!!! It was so tender and nicely seasoned with authentic herbs. It was a good portion and so tasty but priced just 20 something I think. So reasonable!! No need to mention about lamb kebabs. Always GREAT here! Kebabs could be too salty for me but not here so I can eat a lot!! Great food in affordable price and BYOB!! The servers are always nice and friendly and I love the lanai tables there. \u00a0Nothing fancy decor but really cozy lanai. \u00a0It's one of my favorite spot."], ["Nat N.", "Maybe Moroccan/Lebanese food is not my thing. Never tried it before so I have nothing to compare it to. That being said, my review is really just my gut talking about what it liked/didn't like.The best thing about Kan Zaman is the portion sizes. Wow. It's been a long time since I've walked away from a restaurant uncomfortably full, especially after lunch. \u00a0While most restaurants scale down their portion sizes for lunch, Kan Zaman does not. \u00a0 The lamb kabob sandwich was pretty good. Bread was nice and soft, and it was topped with a heaping amount of lamb. \u00a0In fact there was so much on there that I had to eat this sandwich with a fork and knife. My sandwich came with a salad, but I really wanted to try their fries, so I asked the server if I could get fries instead of the salad. \u00a0\"Sure, i can do that for you\". What he didn't tell me was that he was going to charge me $2 for this substitution. \u00a0I hate being blindsided like that.The baklava seems to be loved by many on Yelp, but not by me. It was cold and overpriced at $6 for two small triangles. It's a rare occurrence for me to not finish my dessert, and in this case, I left a few bites on my plate when we left. If you're coming here for lunch, dress casually and comfortably - it's hot in here."], ["Alexander G.", "Amazing food, lovely ambiance, and friendly service make this a must-stop restaurant in Honolulu!I have been trying to eat here for months now, but the stars have not aligned until last night. \u00a0The wait was worth it! \u00a0Nestled on Nuuanu in an old Chinatown building, Kan Zaman has a cute and tight feel in their small storefront. \u00a0The big windows and decor are welcoming. \u00a0Despite this, we opted to sit outside in their peaceful courtyard. \u00a0Surprisingly green and open for Chinatown, the courtyard offers a serenity and freshness in which to enjoy all their incredible fare. \u00a0I noticed the soft strings of light, that gradually added to the coziness over the course of dinner. \u00a0The seating area is a small wood area with nicely spaced tables. \u00a0I liked the comfortable seat covers and table cloths. \u00a0The waitstaff was very professional, efficient, and more friendly than I've experienced in a long time. \u00a0They made my birthday special, thank you JC and Samantha. \u00a0With the Chinatown location, parking is a bit of a hassle, but there is a municipal parking garage across the street with reasonable charges. \u00a0It is also just off Hotel Street's multiple bus lines, and easy to walk from A'ala Park, Downtown, or Chinatown areas. \u00a0The restaurant is traditionally Middle Eastern, so they offer various teas to drink. \u00a0If you're inclined for alcohol make sure to plan ahead and BYOB!For dinner, my dining companion and I ordered many small dishes and one entree to share and enjoy together. \u00a0We had the Mezza Sampler including stuffed grape leaves (my favorite), babaganoush, hummus, and peppers. \u00a0We tried the delectable felafel with tahini. The lentil soup was so flavorful, a true dish to nourish the soul. \u00a0My favorite salad, tabouleh, was lightly refreshing with a hint of citrus. \u00a0Our main entree was the lamb couscous; the lamb just fell off the bone and was so tender and lean. \u00a0Served over a bed of saffron couscous, the various vegetables were just as soft and nutritious. \u00a0 I ate a lot but felt more content and happy than anything.This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Honolulu; I'm happy there is an authentic Moroccan/Lebanese/Middle Eastern restaurant so close by. \u00a0Definitely give this place a try if you're looking to try something distinctively not Hawaiian!"], ["Samantha R.", "Last minute recommendation for my husbands Birthday as the Belly Dancer was performing...

Typically, I prefer posting yummy pics to IG with concise comments on my culinary thoughts and experiences. However, I was so impressed with the impeccable service I received at Kan Zaman that I was prompted to post this review so I could properly credit the staff at this amazing establishment. I threw a surprise birthday party for my SIL at this restaurant. As a former executive assistant, I've planned many events at a variety of different venues from intimate gatherings to full-blown galas. I worked with Kamal the manager for this particular party. I found him to be one of the BEST I've had the pleasure of planning with. He was clear and professional in his communication, he responded quickly and politely to my inquiries and questions, and he made me feel at ease that my party would be a success every step of the way.He helped to arrange a henna artist and a belly dancer since we had the party on a night that they are not regularly scheduled at the restaurant. I didn't have to lift a finger!! My wish was his command...Kumiyo, our henna artist, created unforgettable henna art on my guests. Malia, our belly dancer, was so magnificent it took our breath away and got our blood ready to party. It was the first time most of my guests had the opportunity to experience these things. So fabulous to be able to offer them this and to share in it. All this and we didn't even order yet!!We had a party of 11 and Michael and Samantha served us with exceptional care. They were polite, attentive, and very fun!! We stared with our BYOB cocktails. The restaurant supplied the stemware, but we also brought cups as well. They even provided ice. Did I mention no corkage fee?!?!Then, the food came...for many it was the first time dining on Moroccan meals. Every one enjoyed their dishes with delight and vigor!! I actually picked up my rack of lamb bone with my fingers and \"indulged\" and others did the same. We could not get enough. And, the atmosphere made it feel appropriate to be \"primal.\" My SIL who had lamb the week before at Hy's said she enjoyed her shank at Kan Zaman more than her rack at Hy's. And, she'd never pick up her bones at Hy's. Nothing against Hy's. It was just everything...the flavors and the flair of the atmosphere that made every bite unbelievably memorable!! Portions were generous but most of us licked our plates clean. The rack of lamb, the lamb tajine, the seafood special...all were truly \"special!!\"They helped us serve the bday cake and brought out dishes for us to use. A very nice touch. Again, no extra charges. After dessert, they sprinkled a scented water on our hands from a decorative silver decanter. It topped off the meal so perfectly!! Finally, they served a marvelous Moroccan tea. The fragrance from this warm brew filled the night air and tickled our tongues with its delicate flavors.I will definitely be back to Kan Zaman!!! It was like an oasis in the heart of downtown yet they treated us like guests in their home. Most importantly, my SIL and my guests all experienced a very magical Moroccan evening under the moon that will be a lasting memory for all of us!!"], ["Alison S.", "Came here around 5 on Saturday for a late late lunch/pre dinner. After seeing the review and looking at all the pics and menu pretty much knew what I wanted us to order! We started out with the sampler for an app and split a dinner special they had....rack of lamb with a sauce and saffron mashed potatoes. We also got their mint iced tea. I don't normally drink sweetened iced tea but it's mint and lightly sweetened and refreshing especially on a humid day. So good!! The sample was ahhmazing!! Hummus, and babaganoush, and grape leaves with rice, and red and green bell peppers with lots of pita! So tasty. The entree which we split was out of this world. The gravy sauce was so good and I can't even tell you what flavored I tasted cause I would prob be wrong. Lol. The mashed taters were yummy! Never would've thought to add saffron to them. We ordered the orange blossom cheesecake to go. Will have to update on that later....it's still in the fridge. Lol. But from the reviews it sounded good which is why we chose it! Will definitely come back to try their other dinner entrees! Oh and Samantha was our waitress and she's awesome! Super sweet and friendly and helpful!

Their baba ganoush, hummus and tabuleh is especially worth noting. SERVICE:Also wonderful. This place is routinely packed on weekends (which is why I hesitate writing a review... I want to keep it low key), and yet the staff always try their hardest to squeeze us in. The indoor and outdoor eating options are both great, and create a cool atmosphere.

I'm not really sure how the combination of morocco and Lebanon came about, as morocco and Lebanon are not even really close to each other, but hey, the food is good, so I'm not complaining. I've been here a couple times, both for dinner. Of the menu items I've tried, I particularly like the Orange salad, the Orange blossom cheesecake and the babaganoush.

They offer one free refill too!!

For dinner entrees, I have tried the lamb tajine and lamb kebab. \u00a0Firstly, I absolutely loved the lamb tajine. \u00a0The meat was incredibly tender, the sauce flavorful, while the white beans and herbs complemented the dish well. \u00a0I would order this dish again on a future visit. \u00a0The lamb kebab was a very generous portion served with rice pilaf, hummus and pita bread. \u00a0Overall, I liked the dish as the lamb chunks were a decent size, and they were not skimping on the sides. \u00a0Sadly, the lamb was slightly salty and for that reason I chose not to finish my entree. \u00a0I am entirely not sure if that is the traditional way this dish is prepared, but I do wish I could have eaten more.SERVICE: \u00a0Very good. \u00a0The staff was friendly, polite, and very patient with our boisterous group. \u00a0As the evening progressed and the restaurant grew crowded, we did have more of a difficult time catching the attention of a server.BOTTOM LINE: \u00a0Cozy restaurant in downtown. \u00a0BYOB is a plus for sure. \u00a0The babaganoush is a true standout on the menu."], ["Travelmeister T.", "Returned three weeks ago with a friend. \u00a0Reserved a table outside -- thank goodness since it was so hot inside. \u00a0The food and service were excellent. \u00a0The lamb kebab is fantastic! \u00a0And BYOB! \u00a0Love it"], ["Rusty B.", "The lamb was amazing.

It was basically tons of garlic and olive oil which I love. I pretty much ate that app myself and would recommend it to anyone, especially garlic lovers such as myself. The hummus was good. Definitely homemade, but a bit grainy for my liking. All of the pita was warm which is a must but worth mentioning. The feta and olives were good as well. I liked that they give you a big block of feta rather than feta pieces.Regarding the entrees, there was a slight mixup. They accidentally made me a lamb plate instead of a fish plate but they were able to quickly make a fish plate for me before everyone else was finished eating. The fish was fresh though a teeny bit dry. The sauce was sooooo good. Super delish tzatziki!!! The side salad was super yummy too. I really liked the dressing and all of the veggies were fresh. My bf really enjoyed his lamb plate. This place has downsides tho. The cash only is antiquated and the fact that they don't even have an ATM in the restaurant is annoying. Also, we came on a Sunday night and it was a 35 minute wait for our food. We were going to take the food to-go but we were lucky enough to score a table outside. It's also annoying that you pay after your meal. This place just seems really backwards.

Thats just me though..."], ["Lindsey S.", "I've been here so many times I can't even count. I love everything on their menu. I've had everything at least once, or tried it from someone who shared with me.

I've asked them not to add it and it only worked once =/ BUT its still amazing melt in your mouth crazy good!

Must be really good. I came here around 7ish, danggg...it was full. It took us awhile to find a table since there was like 5 of us. Anyways, I order a mahi mahi souvlaki, includes the pita bread and the salad with dressing. I didn't like the dressing because it was really sour. The mahi mahi was really good with pita bread. Mmmmm...definitely will come back to try some thing else. My friend told me on Tuesdays, there are specials..not sure what it is though."], ["Lien V.", "I have a love affair with Olive Tree Cafe ever since the summer of 2000. I love coming here on a regular basis and back in the day, I used to walk to OTC for my weekly dinner meals. It was always a treat to eat here and I really enjoyed walking back home after I \"pigged out\". The walk back home would only take less than 10 minutes in this neighborhood but I figure it was better than driving such a short distance but more than anything, walking gives me an excuse to eat more here... hehehe. The food was amazing then and is still amazing now. I have not had a bad meal here at all. These people know what they're doing and they do it extremely well. The menu is small but what they make, they make it good. Olive Tree Cafe has it down to a science. Located across from the Kahala Elementary School and adjacent to McDonald's, Olive Tree Caf\u00e9 is a small restaurant with mostly outdoor seating but there are some indoor tables where there is AC but it is too cold for me. The d\u00e9cor is really cute and you can see the Mediterranean influence, including the Greek music playing in the background. Since it is BYOB, you can pay 50 cents to use their little glasses for your wine. Ordering is at the counter and you pay when they call your name. It's cash or local checks only. Kitchen is small but the staff is extremely efficient but sometimes you might have to wait a little longer for them to wipe down your table. My \"must-have\" staples when I get here: baba ghanoush, Greek salad, New Zealand lamb souvlaki, mussel ceviche and tabouleh salad. This is Greek food at its best; the flavors are so phenomenal! Since I am not a fan of hummus, baba ghanoush (roasted eggplant instead of chickpeas) is my ultimate answer to hummus and I could keep eating this all night long. Their house made pita bread is so good and addicting! Then, there's the authentic Greek salad, it's out of this world and I love their homemade dressing (which I have not been able to imitate as to date) and I feel good eating this salad. The entire garden seemed to be packed in this plate of fresh lettuce, yellow bell peppers, red onions and grape tomatoes. As far eating lamb goes, I don't order it unless it is not gamey. I do order the lamb here and enjoy it more than I expected so now the lamb souvlaki is one of my favorite selections. Lamb kabobs made here (perfectly grilled on a skewer for hours) is not gamey but very tender and juicy wrapped up in that warm pita bread. It is simply delicious served with the tzatziki sauce and the accompanying side of fresh salad. Another great dish is the mussel ceviche. When I first ordered their mussel ceviche, a light bulb went on in my head :-) This is a fantastic, healthy source of protein for my dinner because it is not a red meat. A hint of fresh ginger served on top of the mussels really make this dish. Another yummy salad I'm totally a fan of is the tabbouleh salad; it has the perfect combination of bulghur wheat grains, minced parsley and mint herbs, lots of diced cucumbers, tomatoes and onions served with their lemon vinaigrette dressing. So tasty and satisfying. What is nice about coming here is that if you forget your wine, you can walk next door to their market and buy a bottle of wine or beer. They even sell cheese, crackers and of course, their yummy halva. This Middle Eastern confection known as halva (made from sesame seeds mixed with honey or sugar) taste almost like fudge, is such an awesome and addicting dessert; I prefer it over baklava.Coming to eat at Olive Tree Cafe is always a treat for me and I think it is the best Greek restaurant in Hawaii and even better than some mainland Greek restaurants.Parking could be a problem sometimes since they share the parking lot with Subway and Wahoo's Fish Tacos. But I've always found parking along side of Pahoa Street or Kahala Mall. Olive Tree Cafe is my must-go-to-places to eat good at anytime."], ["Mark S.", "Great neighborhood restaurant in Kahala, tucked in a strip mall. Don't let the location fool you. There is a wine shop next to it owned by the same guy. BYOB/BYOW.The menu hardly changes but the food is always consistently great and fresh. The organic chicken souvlaki is a favorite and the falafel is a good vegetarian option. The New Zealand mussels are great with a dash of lemon and capers. The tabbouleh salad is light and refreshing, but if you're ordering a souvlaki skip the salad unless you're really hungry (small salad comes with souvlaki entree). But don't skip the baklava (made fresh daily) because it's probably the best I've had on the island.You can either sit inside or if you're lucky, get a table outside where it's more of a relaxed and casual atmosphere. Cash only."], ["R W.", "We arrived at 5:20 pm and they open at 5 so we thought we would be arriving before the dinner rush.

Once you place your order you must find a table in the small indoor space \u00a0(6 small tables) or outdoor space (11 tables some medium size) and then you sit and wait an even longer time for your food. Once they call your name over a loud speaker you pick up your food at the counter and pay. The amount of time that we waited was ridiculous!!! The food was ok and had small portions sizes.....but not worth the wait. We ate our food and waited an additional 20 minutes just for them to call our name so we could pick up our baklava dessert at the counter. Their ordering processing needs help. We won't be back.

After just eating at Kan Zaman I'm addicted to these 3 items. I'm very pleased with my purchase. The pita is not made in Hawaii and according to the packaging it's distributed by a New Jersey based company. Fanti \u00a0Foods Inc. was established more than 100 years ago in the U.S. Fantis Foods imports and distributes fine Greek/Mediterranean food and beverage products throughout North America and as I now know to Hawaii as well. The pita that I ordered was a package of ten. When I got home I was pleasantly surprised \u00a0to find a warm pita wrapped in foil on the bottom of my bag which allowed me to immediately test out the baba ganoush and tabouleh. Oishi!!!Nice touch just like the prize on the bottom of a cracker jack box. thank you!The pita is delicious, the tabouleh is soooo fresh, and the baba ganoush tasted more like hummus and not an eggplant/hummus dip thing but very very tasty nonetheless. I've already shared this place with a number of people and nice thing for me it's right down the road. Great place to pick up something different to take to a tailgate, potluck or any occasion. Variety they say is the spice of life. Don't know who Mary is but I like your food.

We go to 99 ranch all the time but I never knew this place existed here. That's probably because its located all the way in the back and I never go past Imari's. \u00a0I don't eat greek food very often (unless you count just eating pita chips and hummus) so I wasn't familiar with the food on the menu. However, I try to eat healthy on the weekdays and I know greek is supposed to be healthy. \u00a0 After about 10 minutes of looking at the menu and asking a few questions we finally order. Food - 4 StarsI end up choosing something that I was familiar with. Yes, of course, the Gyro plate. yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026I came here to be healthy and I end up choosing one of the more unhealthy of the greek dishes hahah.. oh well, so much for that plan. The food turned out to be pretty good though thank goodness. The plate came with the gyro meat which is a mixture of lamb and beef (in case you don't know), toss salad, rice pilaf, hummus, pita bread and the yogurt sauce thing. The meat was very tasty and they were very generous with their portions. The only very slight downfall for me was that it seemed just a little bit dry for my liking. Everything else was perfect. All that for just about 8 dollars.Service - Good/Standard Its a fast food stand so service was standard. They were friendly and happy to answer whatever questions we had. Environment - \u00a0The location that its in is where the grocery store used to be so it's the most spacious and always the most empty part of 99. So empty that I think you can hear an echo if you speak loud enough. There is also a huge video being played on the back wall that plays Filipino programming. I positioned myself to be facing the video when I ate so I could watch the show. It wasn't subtitled so I didn't understand a word they were saying but that's okay because it's something about watching TV and eating that makes the experience more enjoyable for me. Overall, I think I found a new place to eat in 99 and would definitely come back again. Next time I will probably choose the other unhealthy of the greek dishes...the falafel."], ["Chris L.", "It has been way too long since I had a falafel. \u00a0I'm am so happy that I happened to find this place.Ok it wasn't the best falafel I've ever had, but it was pretty dang good. \u00a0If I could make it better, I would spice it up to add more kick. \u00a0 \u00a0I will come back next time I have a craving."], ["Neeko M.", "I've only had the falafel from here but I must admit that it was pretty damn good.

My only complaint is that they were slightly overcooked in the deep-fryer, with the crust being a bit darker in color and flavor than \"GBD\". Not really a problem though, as the absolutely PERFECT Hummus and more mild Tahini Sauce picked up any slack in that regard, giving this Falafel Pita sandwich a truly exotic flare, packed with spices and herbs, rounded out being creamy, earthy, and ultimately very refreshing.Best of all, being meatless, you feel so light, vibrant and full of energy after eating it. My friend tried the Gyro value meal combo, which for $8, you get a fully-loaded Gyro, \"Garlic\" Fries (or tossed salad) and regular drink. He gave the Gyro itself a big thumbs-up, while the garlic fries were perfectly cooked with nice cut size to them. The only drawback is that they use bottled Garlic Salt, and not real minced garlic, which is how it SHOULD be made.Overall, well-executed, very fresh, good quality ingredients and very authentic tasting mediterranean fast food."], ["Keith K.", "Updated Post 2/16/2014Came back here for lunch today. \u00a0Had the exact same thing I ordered a couple of weeks ago. \u00a0Ya know what? \u00a0I'm knocking this place up to 5 stars. \u00a0For the type of food Mary's serves [Greek to go], I think it's really good.Original Post 1/31/2014Our office cleared out for lunch today and headed down to 99 Ranch. \u00a0Most of the eateries in this place have Asian foods, but Mary's was quietly waiting for me over on the other end of the building. \u00a0I have no idea what they named what I ate, but it was #13 (lamb in pita bread; tossed salad and bottle of water). \u00a0Rang out at $8.95 and I have to say I got my money's worth. \u00a0I'd give this place a 5 for lunch, but would expect more for a dinner meal. \u00a0Lamb was tasty and really enjoyed the sauces on the pita and tossed with the salad. \u00a0Quick service, affordable and tasty.

It comes with two lamb skewers, rice, salad, hummus, and fresh pita. The lamb was juicy and delicious, especially dipped in the side of tzakiki. And the fries are my kind of garlic fries.

I'm so glad that I took a chance on this place because I have found me a new comfort food! \u00a0The owner Varouj was very friendly and welcoming, infact he added an EXTRA CHICKEN kabob to my already plentiful order of BEEF AND LAMB KABOBS with the RICE PILAF and PITA BREAD. I'm usually a tough tough critic with my food and I honestly have nothing bad to say about this place other than HE NEEDS TO HAVE MORE LOCATIONS! Support this man's recipies and hospitality by TRYING HIS FOOD and bringing a friend with you because Hawaii needs more diversity in it's food and he surely delivers! You'll NEVER REGRET ever trying this place, trust me!"], ["Paola R.", "I recommend their gyros with lamb. It's a little over $6 for the gyro a la carte, but you can get it with a drink and french for a little over $9. They're not my favorite gyros on the island (that dubious distinction goes to the gyros place at Don Quijote in town), but they're a close second."], ["Dan F.", "*Update 11/12/13*After posting my review, I immediately got this message from the business.\"\"\"ShawarmaAloha Mr Dan F, thanks for stopping by and trying my restaurant dishes, I really appreciate it. The sandwich comes with lettuce,tomato, onions and tahini dressing. the salad comes with vinaigrette dressing, i do not have thousand island in my restaurant. to warm up the pita bread takes about 3 minutes, and yes the chicken shawarma was cooked already. To cook the shawarma i need at least 60 minutes and i don't think customers can wait that long for their orders. Hope this message help you about the preparation . Any suggestion that helps to improve more to satisfy customers please feel free to contact me. Mahalo and have a great holidays.\"\"\" **In response to the message**I'm not sure why the Shawarma I had didn't appeal to me in flavor. Maybe it just lacked the right seasoning. It's understandable that the owner mentioned that Shawarma takes hours in preparation and cooking, but if it tasted well I probably would've ignored the temperature of the food. The salad did had vinaigrette dressing on it since the liquid was transparent and not opaque like thousand island (which I made a mistake when writing my review). It was still too tangy for me so I drained out half an ounce of the dressing but it was still all over the salad. If there's a dish that is significantly better than what I ordered, drop me a message again and I'll be sure to drop by to try it. ***My original review***Ordered the chicken shwarma (Shawarma) sandwich which came wrapped in a pita bread. The chicken was bland, the vegetables were mostly lettuce, but the pita bread was soft and warm. The lettuce salad I got was fully drenched in thousand island (Vinaigrette) \u00a0dressing. I tried draining it but it was still overpoweringly tangy and I couldn't finish my salad.My order came out in 2 minutes. I'm assuming that everything was cooked ahead of time."], ["Jon A.", "Delicious and reasonably priced. The best Greek I've had on Oahu by far. Even the general weirdness of Ranch 99 doesn't ruin it. I usually get the chicken shawarma wrap."], ["Kat W.", "I really love the hummus and enjoyed the chicken kebab. \u00a0 Would like more lamb choices."], ["Lori W.", "\"What is this? 'Mediterranean' (with finger quotes)--what's that? Lebanese? Greek? Lebanese? Cause this tastes Lebanese...\" says Mr. Man as he's eating his food. Sigh.Sometimes, travelling/living abroad sucks, because when you get home, you get cranky when you expect something and don't get it. So to be fair, we had kind of high expectations for this shop. In the end, very nice owner manning the front; OK food. If you are more interested in Greek, this is not your place. If you're OK with more pan-Mediterranean inspired with a leaning towards Lebanese flavoring, you'll be alright. Hidden in the back by the bakery. Went here just before the New Year.+Tzatziki sauce was decent--much better than many other fast-food type places, as it actually used yogurt you could taste and had good body with a soft mint back. A little more seasoning would have been welcome, though.+Saffron rice was plentiful and had flavor, but could use a little more salt for our taste.+Beef kebab was good, but not as tender as we'd hoped.+Pitas are soft, but taste like they *might* be bought vs. handmade. Very consistent texture, shape, and size. Very kiddie-accessible, much more so than the shawarma this day.+Chicken shawarma was coated in dressing, but luckily the dressing was wonderfully spiced. Make sure you like cumin and turmeric. We do, so it was a good moment for us.+Hummus was nicely presented, with the paprika dusting and olive oil. Not too salty, but we would have liked more acid to it--maybe a skosh more lemon?+/-Value is average for what you receive, although the portions did seem a touch small compared to other places we've been. Perhaps they were doing larger portions earlier in the business.+/-Garlic fries were fried to order, but needed much more seasoning and more garlic flavor, for us. Another kiddie-accessible food, if you let them eat fries.+/-Falafel is organic when they can source the ingredients, if you're tracking that kind of thing. They usually advertise this. Ours was overcooked and small, but had decent flavor. Not as good as we hoped, though.-No spanakopita.-Lamb was OK, but tasted more like goat for some reason. However, was lightly seasoned, tender, and a good size for the mouthful.-No Turkish coffees; all can drinks and bottled water. However, the cans and bottled water are very reasonable and aren't gouging you like some other spots in 99 Ranch. No juices, though, so if you have kids--get the juice somewhere else. Caf\u00e9 Ivy has some, in the back by the photography place.We didn't try the dolmades (stuffed grape leaves) because we were so bummed by the spanakopita not being available, and it seemed like a place that was more inspired by Mediterranean flavors rather than committing to a distinct flavor profile. Maybe the owners are adjusting to local palates and so tweaked their home recipes, but we would have loved to try the food the way they make it for themselves.Overall, nice for something different but not our go-to for a quick Mediterranean or even just Greek, despite the plentiful parking and convenient location of 99 Ranch. Sweet customer service. We'll probably try it one more time or so, in case this batch of falafel or kebabs didn't really rep the place."], ["Reimi D.", "I had the beef suvlaki pita and it was pretty tasty. I was going to try their gyro but I'm not a big fan of the gyro (any gyros...something about the texture that I just can't get into). I was pleasantly surprised. I've been here once before and had their stuffed grape leaves and those were good too. I think the next time I will try the beef and chicken combo skewers. The prices are reasonable and there's always ample seating at Ranch Market. My only issue is the garlic fries are made fresh--though they're good, they just taste like regular fries--can hardly taste the garlic. They also have a vegetarian combo--hummus, grape leaves, falafel, and something else, I can't remember. Comes with a salad and drink for $9.00.Oh, and their baklava is pretty good too. Overall, I was satisfied and will likely return again."], ["Adam G.", "Everytime I drop by I always get their Chicken Shwarma Plate. \u00a0Way too good to pass up!"], ["S M.", "Beef tongue plate was delicious - tender and flavorful, and a pretty decent price at $10.99."], ["Amber S.", "I'm in love with this place. I'm so happy I live right down the road. The gyro plate is so delicious. And the gyro sandwich combo with garlic fries never disappoints either. Sooooo good!!"], ["Emi H.", "If there's one word to describe Mary's, it's VALUE! Ordered take-out for dinner because I have three kids and I'm tired. The last thing I want to do after working all day is cook. Mary's is located right next to my kid's gymnastics class and I was really WOWed by what you get for $8! I ordered the gyro plate which is thinly shaved beef & lamb on a bed of rice with salad, hummus & pita bread. My BF is a big eater who needs a lot of meat in his meals, so I was worried about whether or not a gyro plate would suffice. There's a ton of meat on the plate and he was stoked! I really enjoyed the hummus and pita bread!I met Mary (who is actually Filipino) and she was nice enough to give me a sample of her chicken shaorma special. It was decent but I decided to go with the gyro plate which is a mainstay item on the menu. I also got the chicken kebobs for my kids because they're very picky eaters but will always eat chicken and rice.They cook your food when you order it, so be prepared for a 10-15 min wait or call ahead. Mary's is located in the old 99 Ranch Market in the corner. For $8 you really can't beat how awesome her food is and the fab portions. I'm stoked because I've found a delicious dinner option for those days when I just don't have time to cook! Yelp 365 Challenge: #10/365 (The Hummus Hands)"], ["Kris A.", "Love love LOVE THIS PLACE! Went in again, and I always get greeted with a big smile on the owners face. And I just found out that I could cater, omg gotta get my family into eating here now. :)"]]}
