The owner is the same as Nana's Deli in Topa Tower in downtown.The stars of the show here are their noodle dishes like pad thai and pad woon sen as well as their pad ga-prao (I've seen this as pad ka pao in other thai restaurants). The food seems very authentic and also not as oily as other places I've tasted. The curries and stir fry dishes are $13.95 each and come with your choice of rice (including sticky rice as an option at no additional charge).The other dish that didn't disappoint is their green papaya salad, it's really tasty! It's $8.95 and the serving size is a little on the smaller size but the quality is on point.Nana is just the sweetest server - I used to go to Nana's Deli when I worked in downtown and I remembered her sweet demeanor from there. Service is great and fast.Parking is located in the back of the building. They have a small lot as well as a small (tight) structure.

Thick coconut soup was barely edible.Another problem came when the sticky rice was served 10min after curry had been on our table (cold by then) and rice was mostly hard.

Dinning room is clean and bright. Parking is easy and free. The ungood:Lost a star because of rancid peanuts. I ordered Pad Thai made with wide noodles and was surprised when the dish came with no crushed peanuts on top. Perhaps because of the prevalence of peanut allergies these days, the peanuts are offered as an option. Each table has little jars of hot sauce and crushed peanuts.

It comes with mushrooms, lemongrass, cilantro, kaffir lime leaves, and galangal in a clear broth. The portion is huge, and it is more than enough to feed 2-3 people. The broth was clean and flavorful, and had the perfect amount of sourness from the lime juice. The other ingredients were all fresh and really stood out in the soup. The herbs gave off a very fragrant aroma and distinct flavors in the broth. All in all, it was a very pleasing soup with a multitude of flavors from sour, sweet, spicy, bitter, etc.We also ordered the Larb or Larp (Noo, not Live Action Role Playing ;p), which is Minced Meat Salad, spicy. You can choose from chicken, beef, or pork. We opted for the beef. It came with scallions, white onions, cilantro, and mint all on a bed of fresh cabbage. Everything was mixed in with spices without the fish sauce and lime juice (like the Lao-version of Larb). I really enjoyed this dish because each ingredient was fresh and fragrant, and stood out individually with everything working collectively. Also, the beef was not overcooked! All the herbs and spices made this dish very flavorful, and at the same time, very light.My dining partner just recently vacationed in Thailand, and she said the Tom Yum here at Malee is exactly the same there. That right there shows this place is authentic.The service was very good. The lady in glasses was very patient and attentive, and the food came out at the right time, not too fast or too slow. The prices are really good, especially with the amount you receive. We were both very full from just those two dishes.Overall, I'd come back to this place in a heartbeat to try all the other Thai dishes. This place is truly authentic Thai.

We were able to find street parking and the restaurant only had two other parties when we arrived a little past noon. We could choose our own seats so we chose the table closest to the entrance for the natural lighting.We ordered summer rolls, pineapple curry with pork, and pad thai with chicken. The summer rolls were packed with fresh veggies and I liked the accompanying peanut sauce. We went with mild level of spicy since our waitress said even the mild's a little spicy. We should have gone with medium--I didn't really taste any spiciness in the curry. Although the curry was tasty, it didn't blow me away and lacked the vibrancy and consistency seen in other Yelpers' pictures. The pork in the curry was also dry, which sadly detracted from the value of the dish. The pad thai was a saving grace--it had great flavor and the chicken was cooked well. The portion sizes were good and the prices were competitive. With tip, our meal came out to $35 and we left very full.The service was pretty good. Our water glasses were refilled and the food came out quickly. We were checked upon periodically and the check came as soon as we asked for it. I would come back to try other items on the menu."], ["Cora D.", "Very cute place. Very small but they use the space very well so you don't feel cramped dining in.

The waitresses were very attentive in refilling water glasses and bringing our check. One of their young sons was in the restaurant and my friend and I watched as the waitress tried to train him to work. It was cute. I like the whole family-run business idea. My friend and I shared a green curry, pad thai and the crispy chicken wings, all of which were delicious. We were a little too ambitious and ordered too much, so we took home a lot of left overs. Like many Thai restaurants, they offer a variety of curries, noodle dishes, and fried rice. I would also recommend getting the Thai iced tea.

The tom kha was delicious, full of seafood, and big pieces of shrimp. I just wish they would strain out the inedible pieces of lemongrass and Galangal. The larb was ok, but it was a little bland. The piece of raw cabbage that was included was the bottom core with hardly any leaves attached and it was black on the bottom, a little gross.

After my experience last night I don't think I will be going back.I called in a phone order for takeout. It was so loud in the restaurant I had a hard time hearing the girl who answered the phone and she seemed to have a hard time hearing me as well. The first thing I ordered was vegetarian yellow curry with tofu. She told me that there was meat in the sauce, and asked \"is that ok?\" I thought I had misheard her, so I asked for clarification. As best I could understand apparently the curry has shrimp sauce in it, which really disappointed my vegetarian father who has eaten there 10 or 12 times now. I tell the girl on the phone that I would call her back. We discuss it and try calling back. Its still equally difficult to hear anything over the din of noisy diners in the background. After much communication difficulty we find out that they can make the yellow curry without the shrimp sauce. We order that, plus two other dishes and even repeat the order multiple times to make sure she understood it and got everything right. I would like to add that the girl on the phone was very nice (and I don't blame her for the horrible background noise that makes her job nearly impossible to do.)So we arrive at the restaurant 25 minutes later to pick up our food. Turns out that she totally couldn't hear us and screwed up the order. In fact, the only thing that was right was the vegetarian yellow curry. Our order of long rice salad turned into a long rice strie fry, and somehow our order of seafood with spicy lemongrass sauce became tom yum soup with shrimp. We let them know about the mistakes and they comped the soup for us, but we were still disappointed that we weren't getting what we wanted. I think they should have comped both the messed up orders. If they had they might have retained me as a customer. We took the food home and pledged to make the best of it. Leaving the mccully shopping center took 10 minutes because the nightmare parking lot gets pretty crazy on friday nights. Finally, the vegetarian curry was pretty bland. I suspect it was the lack of shrimp sauce that made it less good. So in a way, it was out own fault for ordering it without, on the other hand the restaurant should have a tasty recipe for vegetarian curry that DOES NOT include meat or seafood products. TL;DR- Vegetarians beware of this place; All others make sure they read the order back to you at least twice when ordering takeout."], ["Kathy Y.", "Had the yellow curry, pretty basic.

Lol!They offer other fixed lunch specials, but basically I'm here for this particular lunch special which cost just about $10 bucks! How can you go wrong????The chicken is crunchy on the outside..........and all so juicy on the inside. They give you two pieces of deep fried goodness! As for the veggie stir fry, they offer it mild, medium, or Hot spiciness........and I'm talking so HOT, that it will make you sweat like a pig when you eat!It is quite entertaining when I took my co-workers here to eat two Friday's ago.......... We all ended up taking the lunch special, but I was the only smart one who took my veggie stir fry with the medium spiciness.Both my co-workers took their veggie stir fry to the maximum HOTNESS, and I had the pleasure of watching one of my co-workers sweat like a pig while he ate his meal! Also, they couldn't fill his glass of water fast enough due to the spiciness of his meal! Everyone ate up, and enjoyed their meal...........we will be definately coming back for more in the near future!

There really is something for everyone. They have the most extensive menu of any Thai place I know and really, everything is yummy. Sure, I have some favorite dishes, and I do return to them frequently, but this is a place where I consciously try new things because I trust they will be very good even if they are not my favorite thing ever. Their spring rolls and stuffed chicken wings are my favorite appetizers. If you like curry, you can't go wrong. It seems they do something special with each of their curry sauces so they do not taste the same as anywhere else. I think the Massamun Curry is my favorite, with its healthy serving of large, melt in your mouth cubes of beef. Panang Curry is a close second but really, I have returned to all of them more than once. My spouse loves the Green Curry. Their servings of fish, seafood, shrimp and beef are more generous than most other places and well worth their extra price. Other dishes worth note include Thai Elegant, anything cooked in their lime sauce or garlic sauce, anything with basil in the name. They have a seafood soup that is overflowing with fish, shrimp and crab that is quite the filling bargain. Desserts are worth saving some space. Tapioca and sweet sticky rice being my favorites. Writing this review, I realize I need to try more of their noodle and rice dishes. They are usually my go to dishes if I am at a mediocre place, and I have never felt the need to fall back and try them here. I bet I am missing out. They are a vegetarian's paradise. Many options, in fact, almost any dish can be made vegetarian if requested. The service is usually best at dinner time but the lunch specials are the best deals. Also, they do not close in the middle of the day, so when you want food between 2-5, you can count on them. My main minus? The kitchen can be a bit inconsistent depending on who is cooking and sometimes I have to beg them to make my food spicy, and I mean nuclear spicy. Like too many Thai restaurants, they just do not seem to believe me when I say, \"I have never sent a dish back for being too spicy and I never will.\" The servers who have already served me once, they remember how hot I want it. Getting a new server to convince the kitchen you want it Thai hot however, can be an exercise in futility. A tip, if you like it hot, ask for the pepper cart after you have been served. They tend to remember you after that. One other minus, this place lacks the family touch that can make many other Thai restaurants special. You know what I mean? It isn't like mom is in the back room cooking something special just for you. That one little detail has us venturing out to other places and giving them a try. That is not a bad thing. There is a lot of good Thai food on this island and it is worth the quest to find your favorite. In my experience, Phuket Thai excels at the most things while playing it safe enough to introduce people to Thai Food. It is our go to place to bring friends who do not know their way around a menu. If you are looking for a three course family meal, or just an order of curry and rice, they do it right. The general rating seems low for Phuket Thai but you will see after a quick search that most Thai places have similar ratings. People really do have their favorite places and if another does things different it just does not stand up in their eyes. I respect that. Thai Food is like jazz. People cook around a theme but everyone does it their own way, perhaps you like Davis better than Coltraine. Fine.

Being that we both are Thai junkies, we made our way here for some awesome Thai cuisine. I learned that my friend had lived near Bangkok for a few years, so she knew a thing or two about Thai spicy hot. I later learned, through the menu, that only a bunch of dishes were Thai, and everything else was a hodgepodge of dishes from various parts of the world.With that in mind, we were craving Thai cuisine and needed a spot close to the Hyatt Regency Waikiki hotel, within walking distance. We even asked the hotel concierge for help, but without avail. Enter Yelp. We searched for a good Thai place and came up with Keoni's by Keo's. We walked here from the Hyatt Regency Waikiki and it was just about 2 short blocks. There wasn't really any places to park, so best bet would be to walk it, if you were staying in at a property nearby. If not, the public transit would be your best bet. Bus routes #2, 8, 13, 24, 42, 19, and 20 runs and services through Waikiki. This is my first time here, so I read the reviews and hope that it would be a good one. And it turned out it was good. My friend and I arrived here around 2pm, after a morning session of the Honolulu marathon expo. We settled down into the restaurant and chose a spot next to the entrance, so we could people watch as well. Keoni by Keo's is a small restaurant, but a nice restaurant to be in. Nestled in the heart of Waikiki at the Outrigger Ohana East hotel on Kuhio Avenue, there wasn't any line to speak of. Probably because it was already 2pm and the lunch crowd had left and gone. Keoni's by Keo accepts major credit cards, so that's always a good idea. \u00a0The menu here is not as extensive as I previously thought, but there was some Thai dishes here. They even serve Pho, a Vietnamese dish, which was a little surprising. While I probably won't come back here just for the Pho, knowing that they do have it here is good to know for the future. The prices here are decent, comparable to other options outside of Waikiki. While this place is not your idea of fine dining, it's definitely a good choice for your cravings for Asian cuisine.The service here was pretty good and typical. My friend even made small talk with our server, and I just smiled. While we were eating here close to 2pm, the wait for the food was about 10-15 minutes, which wasn't that terrible. The restaurant ambiance was definitely casual comfort, which made everything just happy and easy. \u00a0I ultimately ordered the eggplant tofu dish, thai hot, with sticky rice. I figured that would just be the standard for anything that Thai food lovers can enjoy. I know there's the Thai curries, but almost all Thai restaurants I have frequented have some sort of eggplant dish, so that's that. Lol The portions here are limiting for the prices, which could be considered overpriced. Then again, the dish was delicious and definitely worth the spicy taste. The sticky rice hit the spot. Haven't had that taste in quite a while, so that just made me smile even more. The overall experience at Keoni's by Keo's was nice. Quiet ambiance, since the restaurant wasn't full, so it was just a nice lunch with a friend of mine.No Pad Thai.

In fact, the restaurant is quite large and every time I've gone, despite the throng of people in gathered near the entrance, I've been seated immediately. I wouldn't recommend getting seated on the \"ground floor\", as the birds like to jump on the unoccupied tables and eat the crumbs on the tables closest to the open doors.

Crispy Spring Rolls wasn't memorable either. Cashew Chicken seemed like the most decent thing to eat on the menu because they use an a lot of cashews. Yum.Service was decent, but the items are quite pricey given the type of food they put out. Also -1 star for having rice (2.95 for white rice) a la carte.

And so a couple of friends and I decided to try this place for breakfast.First, customer service is on par. Our server was prompt with everything we needed and is definitely friendly. I liked the variety of their breakfast; however, the breakfast was according to a semi Americanized/local/Japanese style cuisine. I was a little disappointed because I was expecting a Thai breakfast style for my first dining experience here. However, I had the pleasure of trying their Mahi Mahi breakfast which contains two egg battered Mahi Mahi (side of tartar sauce), two sunny side up eggs, white rice (or you're also able to have corned beef hash). The Mahi Mahi lacked taste to me so I had to get my side order of onions to add taste to my dish.The prices were not bad.

I was really hungry and perhaps just lazy and \"Thai\"-red to look for a place, I picked the first restaurant that showed up in my search for Thai food. Chiang Mai came up first and to Chiang Mai we went. Parking is plentiful behind the building, but for those who are a bit scared, there are tents up that the homeless live in lined up on the sidewalk. We entered into a pretty empty restaurant and sat down next to the windows, where the seats are traditional Thai triangle cushions.For our appe-\"Thai\"-zer, we decided to order the Chiang Mai BBQ Cornish Hen (Gai Yaang), because it would be something new. Cornish hen?! Is that good?! Let me tell you, it was so delicious!! The meat was so juicy and had good flavoring, but when you add the sauce they give you on the side, it was to \"Thai\" for. Yup. I could've eaten this whole dish as my main meal if I hadn't ordered something already. That sauce killed it though. It was just \"Thai\"-riffic. It was like a mixture of fish sauce, lime, cilantro, and Thai red peppers all mixed together to form a heavenly dipping sauce. I HATE cilantro, but I loved this sauce. P.S. Does ANYONE know the exact recipe to this? I want to my own supply of this, enough to make a \"Thai\"-ranosaurus Rex full! I don't know why, but I ALWAYS order Pad Thai whenever I go out to eat Thai food. I don't know if it's because it just always sounds so en-\"Thai\"-cing, or if I'm just so lame I don't want to \"Thai\" something new. So...I ordered the Pad Thai here, medium spicy. It was good, a although not the best I've had. The dish was a little sweet for my liking and definitely could've used some heat. I also got to try a bit of my boyfriend's chicken pineapple curry which had really good flavoring. The food with the glasses of yummy wine we ordered as well as great service made the en-\"Thai\"-re meal amazing. I'm definitely coming back to have some more of their food.

Pretty specific right ? It didnt say crab curry, snow, blue, king or otherwise it said clearly Dungeons. \u00a0So when they served me a pile of onions and peppers dripping with oil and what appeared to be a broken curry sauce with snow crab parts under it all, I had to ask the waitress \"is this dungenous crab?\" She replied with little hesitation \" no its not, we only serve this kind of crab here anymore\" and so it went... I do not hate snow crab so I decided to give it a try instead of returning the order. \u00a0Bad idea :( I tried to eat a bit of the crab but gave up after realizing the amount of oil I would have to consume in the process would not be worth it. \u00a0I will be hard pressed to give them another chance.

That was her idea of good service. It wasn't busy so they could have easily made another. Not wanting to be confrontational and end up with who know what in my food, I decided to deal with it.

Recently we had guests in from Thailand for a week, and after we took them here, they insisted on returning every night for dinner. They loved it that much. It's also notable to watch yourself when ordering spices here. This place is NO JOKE. We brought one guest here who prides herself on handling the spice, and they kicked her mouth in the ass!

No big deal though - this place has been around since before Thai food was even a \"thing\" or a standard ethnic food category expected in any US city. Just the fact that they're still around now that there is competition on almost every street corner means they must be doing something right. We ordered spring rolls as an appetizer. Those didn't last long as we were pretty hungry. For main dishes to share we ordered Red Curry with Shrimp, Garlic Shrimp, and some noodle dish that I can't remember the name of. Noodles were ok - I wasn't the one who chose it so I didn't partake too much anyway. Red Curry was awesome even though it was not too spicy - had to tone down things as I wasn't eating alone. Garlic Shrimp was tasty but it was a tad on the salty side so it ended up the last dish to get fully devoured. We enjoyed the meal and there were no leftovers - a good time was had by all.

He initially suggested Peace Cafe, so he obviously doesn't even read my reviews since I mentioned more than once that I am a CARNIVORE and that place is vegan! Strike ONE. Then he suggested Dee Thai but didn't bother to check if they were even open for lunch (they're not). Strike TWO. So I picked Sala Thai, called them to confirm that they would be serving lunch \u00a0@11:30 (sign says open 11:00am-2am)\" but when I got there, the gates were padlocked shut at 11:34am. Strike THREE! By this time my stomach is growling and I'm slightly annoyed that restaurants don't open at their posted times. I told Val \"FINE. We can eat at Peace Cafe\", his original suggestion. But as luck would have it, there was horrible traffic and by the time I got to Peace Cafe I was way too hungry and grouchy, and vegan just wasn't going to cut it (sorry Peace Cafe, maybe another day). Lucky for me, Chiang-Mai was right next door! BINGO. Located on King Street just past the McCully library, Chiang-Mai has been quietly serving Thai food for longer than most Thai restaurants, so they must be pretty good to survive this long, right? Val suggested ordering two dishes each to share family style. Okay, this is finally off to a good start - 4 dishes for 2 of us! After I started stuffing my face, these were his exact words: \"whoa girl, you can really eat!!\" (If you actually read my reviews, you'd know that I can eat...a lot) What did we eat?? Oh yeah: Papaya salad $7.50 yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026 This was Val's choice since he likes healthy stuff. I've never had papaya salad before so I have nothing to compare it to, but it didn't taste anything like papaya and I don't think I'll ever order that dish ever again. But thanks for sharing. Evil Shrimp $12 yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026 This was Val's other choice. Shrimp with bamboo shoots in a reddish curry sauce was good but not evil like Phuket Thai Evil Jungle Prince. The server never asked us how spicy we wanted anything so everything was pretty mild. Green Curry with chicken $9.50 yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026 Bite size chicken with eggplant in a creamy green curry was my favorite dish of the meal. It was really yummy over the jasmine rice. Which brings me to my next point:Rice $2 I thought the rice came with the curry!? (I just ate at Sabai Dee and paid $7.95 and got curry AND rice). Pad Kee Mow with chicken $10.50 yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026 The flat chow fun style noodles topped with eggplant-jun (?) and other veggies looked spicy when it arrived but it was all just an illusion. It was good, but not spicy and there was NO BROCCOLI! You gotta put broccoli in this dish! Pad Kee Mow was better at Sabai Dee. The place is cozy and cute (I could use more A/C though, it was hot), service was good, my water was topped off quite often, and I was happily stuffed when I left the place. However, I would rather go a few blocks down the street to Sabai Dee Thai, which had better prices, easy parking, bigger portions, lots of broccoli, and free rice.Definitely a dining experience that deserves a yelp review! Now go read Val Y.'s review of Chiang-Mai and see how the events unfolded in his eyes! P.S.

It has nine tables (three two seaters and six four seaters) and a regular flow of take out customers. At one point in time, the waitress had difficulty returning back to the back of the restaurant because the line was so long. My typical question when going to a new restaurant is what would you recommend. I was thrown off that the first suggestion was Ph\u00f2 (especially for a place called Pad Thai), but was also offered a few more suggestions. I decided upon the Tom Yum Soup with Seafood at medium spice level and a bowl of sticky rice. I have a medium palette when it comes to chili pepper spicy so my lips were consistently tingling and nose was watering as I ate this soup. The soup had a delicious flavor with a few mushroom and tomatoes thrown in the mix. I wish there were more seafood though: two shrimp, few pieces of white fish, and a scallop or two was in the bunch. There was also an abundance of non edible flavor additions (lemon grass and some sort of husk thing). Aside from that, the flavor of the soup was tasty enough to disregard them (or was I supposed to eat them to follow tradition). The way staff looked younger, but they were friendly. The tables were cleared at a medium pace; faster as more customers came in for dine in. Would I come again? I would. I am curious to try the other offerings (maybe even try the ph\u00f2)."], ["Marian S.", "First time in, not bad... Owner appears to be Lao and most employee spoke Lao..
