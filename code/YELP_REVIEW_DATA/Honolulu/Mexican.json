I said, \"good.\" \u00a0Whether it be grilled or fried, the fish is cooked well, but not overcooked. \u00a0The tacos also topped with a generous amount of cabbage and some of their house dressing/sauce. \u00a0The cabbage is not only healthier than lettuce, but also provides a nice crunch (texture) to the taco. \u00a0*** I always go soft when ordering tacos...but I roll hard in real life. J/K. But seriously. *** - Good salsa bar: Home to some good salsa mixes (when it's stocked). \u00a0Here's how I roll. \u00a0Mix some Pineapple Passion and Maui Firedance salsa together (in those tiny cups). \u00a0Add some onions, a little cilantro, and Bam!!! \u00a0Sweet, spicy, savory...your mouth will be confused, but ask for some more.- Good \"wet\" burritos: Normally, I'll eat burritos with my bare hands, but I'm willing to use a fork and a knife to eat their moist burritos (I had to sneak in the word \"moist\"). \u00a0Food portions served here are generous and 'Merican-sized so beware. \u00a0Get big and go home (with leftovers). To sum it up: Way better than the Bell, NOT a backhanded compliment, good fish taco, good salsa bar, good \"moist\" burrito, good overall, get big and go home. On last note...To the folks at Maui Taco (Waikiki), Don't change the food. It's fine the way it is. People will always be critics (including myself). \u00a0Most will either like it, hate it, or say \"Meh. It's okay.\"Don't sacrifice food preparation time for speed. \u00a0You guys are pretty fast already. \u00a0 However, please make sure to keep the Salsa Bar stocked and clean.Doing this would likely bump you guys up a few notches in most people's books.

The food took about 10 minutes and she didn't pop back out until then. There were a few people passing by looking at the menu so she could have lost potential sales.

This is the only Maui Tacos I've been to (there's one in Kailua).They say there's no good Mexican eateries on the 'aina. I disagree. There's La Familia in Waipahu; there's that place on Hotel St run by father and son; I like Cholo's. That said, Maui Tacos is not what I consider authentic Mexican food - more Westernized and quite sanitized, and when I say \"sanitized,\" I mean the food is missing all that good grease I find on platters from the aforementioned places. Maui Tacos is some steps above Taco Bell and a couple of notches below Chi-Chi's. No way does it approach La Familia.Now, this is not a negative review: the food is good. A little pricey, but maybe because it's in Waikiki. $10 got me the chingalinga today with black beans and Spanish rice. Soda refills are free and I got a collector's plastic cup to sip my Dr Pepper out of. What else can I say? It's Mexican fast-food, and pretty fair stuff if you're craving for it.

My husband is full Mexican (first generation born in USA) and my in laws eat pretty much nothing but Mexican food, everyday. So, we kinda know real Mexican food. We stopped here for breakfast and ordered up some grub. I definitely went in with some prejudice, we thought familiarity for the in laws would be nice, though. Now for the big guns....we were surprisingly SHOCKED. The food was good. I love chorizo (Mexican sausage) and eggs, so that's what I got. It did taste similar to ground beef (which I like too) so I ain't complaining. But I'm not sure how true to real chorizo it was. Also, there are lots of brands where we live (L.A.) and chorizo varies there too. Anyway, they add tomato and onion to their scrambled chorizo and egg, which we usually don't do, but is was an excellent touch of freshness. It came with a hearty side of beans (you can choose refried, black, or pinto beans) and Spanish rice and 2 corn tortillas and some chips. Mmmm, good. They have a pineapple passion salsa that had a really nice flavor, which my father in law loved. In laws had huevos rancheros and huevos la mexicana...both traditional breakfast meals and the in laws gave their seal of approval (nodding and saying \"es muy bueno\" or \"it's very good.\"Quesadilla for my son, from the kids menu, was big and we ordered a side of Spanish rice, which he loves, and the portion was HUGE. (I've got some serious run-on sentences going on here). No milk for the lil one, but we just love that Fanta Fruit Punch (we don't have this back home...but I'm starting a campaign to get it as soon as we get back to the mainland).They also, have a large variety of salsas to choose from Hot to mild.

My burrito was really hot temperature wise. \u00a0As I mentioned before, the beef was really juicy, which made it tricky, trying to eat it and keep all the goodies still wrapped up in the tortilla. \u00a0I suggest giving it a minute, because my first bite did slightly burn my tongue.The salsa bar had about 5 different types and level of spiciness of salsa. \u00a0There were mixtures of pineapple, tomatillo, oregano spices, jalape\u00f1os, chile arbols, \u00a0and even spicy grilled onions. \u00a0My favorite part was being able to add all the cilantro and lime I wanted on my burrito.The order came with a side of chips, which made it nice because that gave me an opportunity to try most of all the salsas. \u00a0I chickened out and couldn't go for the HOT stuff. \u00a0Our total bill came out to be just under $16, but with the IDcard we scored 15% off that total.Is there good Mexican food that exist in a food court? \u00a0The answer is: S\u00ed, claro."], ["Michael F.", "I loathe food court food, but I was famished so I got something here for dinner.

I'll tell you right now though. Whoever bartended tonight drowned me in Patron. I greatly appreciated that, but I just couldn't handle that much straight tequila flavor. Cara was also sweet enough to ask the cooks to make my Diablo Shrimp app spicy as hell. Hence Diablo. They added habaneros I think and the sauce was delicious. The sauce though was the only good part about the shrimp. It was so far past over cooked it was rubbery sadly. Like honestly. I've burnt shrimp at home that wasn't as over cooked as the shrimp I had here. But again, the sauce was AMAZING. So my recommendation when you order this bad boy is to ask for the shrimp to be raw when you get it. The skillet will cook it enough probably.

I'm just going to try to describe our experience and let you decide. Mexico Cantina has some great strong points and I'm hoping the bugs get worked out in the coming weeks as they try to find their footing. I want to be optimistic about this one.Reservation: We thought it might be a good idea to get a reservation and did so over the phone. It did get pretty busy later and I'm glad we didn't have to wait.Mariachi Band: Damn!! This was the best Mariachi Band I've ever experienced. Mariachi is a form of folk music from Mexico. This six piece band had it all from the ethnic instruments to skillful players to authentic songs and talented singers. Plus a killer trumpet. I don't know the band's schedule. But, if you are into music. Don't miss this band! I'm glad I got to see these guys play. 5 Stars! My wife is a closet salsa dancer. She loved it and I could tell she wanted to get up and dance to the music. We stayed a little longer just to listen to them.Venue: In the space of the old Compadre's Mexican Restaurant. It has been at least 2 failed Mexican restaurants over the past few years. The latest incarnation is nicely decorated. 50% restaurant and 50% bar...that's the \"Cantina\" part. Bar has an outdoor seating area which has been part of the original design going back to Compadre's era. Noise: The restaurant side is loud. I mean really loud. To be honest I couldn't find the source of the loud talking and laughing. The restaurant wasn't that busy at first and I couldn't see anyone being that loud. \u00a0The bar had a few drunks yelling at a football game but that wasn't it. \u00a0I think it may just be really bad acoustics of the space. Noise is somehow amplified to an annoying level. A party of 4 was seated next to us and they left within 5 minutes because of the noise. The noise annoyed me too.Service: There was one Hispanic looking waitress. She seemed nice. \u00a0They were all dressed in Yoga type tank top sort of outfits. Unusual uniform to me which reminded me more of a cocktail waitress or bartender outfit. None of the staff looked like they were locals. Our waitress was disinterested. The food runner/table clearer was more involved and sorted out a situation where the wrong food was delivered. I think this is a training and supervision issue. I did not see a manager over seeing things in the dining room.Food: Oh Myyy! I didn't see the guacamole ranchero on the menu but I would have ordered it if I could have seen it. It wasn't recommended by the waitress but should have been. My vegetarian burrito was big but second rate. I had a veggie burrito the day before for lunch at Maui Tacos and it was great. This one was not authentic nor tasty. It was a jazzed up trendy recipe designed for American tastes. It was served with a salad with ranch dressing and a fruit topping. I'm looking for spicy favors and not fruit with a ranch dressing salad. The waitress said it came with rice and beans but it did not. \u00a0I tasted my wife's beans and rice and they were a disappointment. Dry rice and watery beans. The salsa served with the chips almost seemed store bought. Did not seem anything like the premium salsa from Maui Tacos or Senior Pepe's. And those are just food court fast food joints. The other dishes from our party of four were also average. I tried then all. The food is OK. But 3 stars max IMHO.Focus on the food: My suggestion for Mexico Cantina is to switch to authentic Mexican food. Authentic Yes! Trendy No! Great Mexican food transcends average service and a noisy venue. It's all about the food at a Mexican restaurant. Drinks: Not all of your customers are there for a raucous bar experience. Focus on the food and the customers will come and buy margaritas and beer like crazy. I remember many gatherings at the out door bar of Compadres where the group lingered and spent as much time eating as drinking.Three Stars but I'm planning on coming back for sure to listen to the band."], ["Lenny B.", "One of my supper club ladies (4) suggested we eat here before heading to a matinee of \"50 ????\" \u00a0Lol i was kinda hesitant about eating here because most Mexican restaurant in Hawaii is okay. \u00a0And this is the same as all of them. \u00a0I would have given it a 3 star but service is what makes or breaks. \u00a0The waitress was very pleasant but to bring the food for the three of us and tell us that one of the dishes was not made yet because they did not have the wrap for it. \u00a0She could have told us earlier. \u00a0Duh......so one of us had to wait another few minutes for her dish. \u00a0Manager was nice enough not to charge us for that one dish but that's not point.

No cheesy touristy crap here. \u00a0LOVED the feel of the place. Mariachi band that played great music but wasn't too loud or distracting, authentic feel to decor, and no sombreros on any staff member. Perfection. 2) table side guacamole is a must. Trust me.

Three times, and screw up our dinner though so beware)4) the chicken is well seasoned so I would stick to that in your dishes. We got the nacho appetizer with our guacamole and it was amazing. I would recommend just those two appetizers and skip dinner honestly... Because.... 5)As a carne asada fan I was so disappointed when my dinner came out undercooked and unseasoned (I asked for medium rare and got raw with a slight grey outside) and the returned plate was grisly and so well done it was crispy. And still unseasoned. The husband ordered a mixed fajita dish and it was seasoned with heaven knows what but standards like cumin, lime and onion/garlic were not present. Also the steak in the fajitas wasn't standard strips but more of the thin slices you see in typical Mongolian or stir fry. (Very odd). No, we didn't end up paying for my dish and they took his off as a courtesy for messing with mine twice. 6) their rice is outstanding. I have yet to find Spanish/Mexican rice in this island that is even close to authentic. 7) their retried beans are watery and probably canned and then ...something. 8) tortillas are not made in house9) the drinks aren't very strong at allOverall tolerable and will try again but with chicken dishes only.

I asked if they could pick me up so they obliged since it was three adults to one 4 year old. For some reason they chose to eat here. We drove out of our way just to eat here. Surprising because the last time we ate Mexican food as a family was over 15 years ago at a Chevy's (mainland chain). My parents aren't big into Mexican food like my husband and even then, I only like to go to chipotle. Anyway, we come here in the pouring rain and the \"inclement weather.\" We got seated quickly even during happy hour. However it took forever to get a waitress to even take our drink orders. My dad got a margarita which he said was delicious but since I was pooped and wanted to sleep, I just ordered my son a juice to share. It took forever to get our drink order and another long wait for her to come take our food order. We ordered nachos (for my son, $7.95 with drink on the kid menu), flautas appetizer ($3.50 for rice and beans for a \"meal\"), 3 tacos, and carne asada soft tacos. My mom ordered the tacos thinking she was going to eat 2 (she eats like a bird) and share with my dad but she snarfed 3 of them! My dad said his food was good too. I really liked the crispy aspect of the flautas! I think it was better than Serg's (when they first opened). The only disappointment food wise was the nachos. The cheese on it wasn't very good and had a weird taste. My son loved it with the side of salsa we ordered. In conclusion, service was very spotty but to have good Mexican food, it was worth it.

The rice is nice and soft where its not mushy but just right. The meat is seasoned perfectly and juicy, and the salsa gives the burrito a nice kick. They grill or idk, do some heavenly magic to make the wrap (ughhhh, brain fart -___-') where its nice and warm, soft but with a touch of some nice crispy spots.

I like the fact that they make it in front of you so you can see and pick what you want in your burrito or tacos etc. However the downside which is why I only give them 4 stars -1 is the lack of personal hygiene.

We only asked for a piece of foil to wrap it up, but the person at the register offered to wrap it himself.

Tex Mex will not taste like Baja nor will the regions like Chihuahua or Guadalajara. It's like saying the US all tastes the same and judge them on food from New York, Florida, Texas, and California. Not at all. Just think of the 10 or more styles of BBQ sauce. This place is the best Mexican I have found on island. When I found out they have Chilaquiles I literally kicked my heels like Dorothy on the Wizard of Oz and loaded the family up to head to Serg's. I am not used to having Verde on my chilaquiles however this place has drool worthy Chilaquiles. I've had their tacos and they are really good as well. The grilled pineapple on the al pastor (I believe it was that one I have tried ALL their tacos) it sooo delicious. The rice is great and a huge and at a great price.

I usually don't send food back but it was inedible. I sent it back with deep apologies alerting them that my food was still frozen. Thy apologized and I'm guessing they threw my plate into the microwave-- they delivered the exact same plate, with the exact same cold unmelted cheese.

The first time I wanted the tortuguesa (burger), but they were already out just before noon. So I ordered chicken tacos and chips and salsa. Of a party of 6, I ordered first but was served last, after everyone else was done eating. The chips were overcooked and had a faint burnt taste. There was a human hair in the taco sauce, and not just sitting on top. It was down in the cup, and sticking out over the side. When I pointed it out to the server, she took it away, but never apologized. Our party was split; two would go back, three wouldn't, and one was on the fence.The second time (summer 2014) I had the tortuguesa and was unimpressed. This burger seems to really be a matter of personal taste; another person who had it at the same time thinks it's one of the best burgers around.I gave it one more try today. Another friend who's never eaten there want to try it. We each had a burger and split an order of papas fritas (it was take-out). Although both burger patties spent about the same time on the flat top, mine was medium rare and his was more well-done. The burgers were a mess, literally and figuratively. My first bite had a large glob of cheese, and there was no other cheese on the burger. Same issue with the cilantro and other toppings. Neither of us really cared for the burgers. The fries were okay. But - and thus is very important - both of us got very sick not too long afterwards. It's five hours later and I'm still feeling queasy. I read some other reviews and found others mentioned members of their party felt sick afterwards, too.Their food is really a matter of personal taste, more than you find in a lot of other places. If you can get past the food safety issues I've mentioned, try for yourself and judge. You may love it. If you choose to try the burger, I suggest removing the top bun first and making sure the toppings are evenly distributed.As for me, this was my last trip.

Well, whatever you want to call the style, it's DELISH!We came here to dine before going to the CMYE HOT Preview: \u00a0The Flying Dutchman. \u00a0This was our first time, although, we've passed by several times on our way to other venues. \u00a0Our draw tonight was Taco Tuesday (which we missed because we were too early) but, the food was downright amazing! \u00a0This restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating \u00e0 la community tables. They don't serve alcoholic beverages but, you can just go down the block to the convenient liquor store to pick up your own \"poison\", er, beverages. However, if you want to keep in the non-alcohol mode, Cocina offers daily agua fresca, Mexican Coca-Cola and Jarritos (Mexican soda). \u00a0Being that this was our first time here and we were waiting for a fellow yelp friend, we started with chips and salsa. \u00a0The chips were served freshly fried and salted with a salsa that was delightfully refreshing. \u00a0The salsa wasn't your typical salsa fresca that is chunky or just chopped tomatoes and cilantro. \u00a0Nooo, it was fresh tasting but its consistency was like a thick pur\u00e9e. \u00a0The tortilla chips were thicker than what we've eaten before but it held up well when dipping into the thick salsa. \u00a0It was very tasty. \u00a0By the time our friend arrived, we jumped to place our orders because we were told that it might be a wait for our food to be prepared if the kitchen gets overwhelmed. We ordered hibiscus drinks to quench our thirst and accompany the food. \u00a0We also shared our dishes with each other so we'd all get a taste of each dish.THE FOOD: \u00a0- Two locally caught fresh fish tacos: \u00a0street vendor sized tacos featuring grilled locally-caught fresh fish with salsa Vera Cruz, capers, green onions, jalape\u00f1os, and drizzled with yogurt. \u00a0Each taco was served with two soft tortillas so you could actually make 4 tacos out of the serving. \u00a0The fish was delicate while its condiments matched as well piqued natural flavors.- Two house made headcheese carnitas tacos: \u00a02 street vendor sized soft tacos with house made charcuterie headcheese, poblano chilie-orange relish, pickled jalape\u00f1os, and Cotija cheese. \u00a0These tacos were very flavorful, not spicy, but just tasty. \u00a0I'd return just for these!- Tortuguesa: \u00a0is not your typical hamburger in a bun. This dish was made up of a grilled locally-raised Kulana beef patty, avocado pur\u00e9e, picked jalape\u00f1os, grilled onions, Tex-Mex cheese, house ketchup and topped with a sunny side up egg. \u00a0This burger was served between a torta roll and to eat it, you had to \"prepare\" to be a bit messy. \u00a0You should first burst the egg yolk to allow it deliver its eggy rich sauce all-over, place the top of the torta roll right over the egg, cut the burger in half or just go for it by picking up the whole sandwich and bite into its luxurious flavors. \u00a0We liked the flavor of the burger as it was grilled to its perfect doneness and melded well with the rest of the flavors.- Frijoles charros: \u00a0this was a bowl of tastebud unctuousness. \u00a0These pinto beans were nice and creamy when bit into yet still held their form without looking like mush. \u00a0There were chunks of smoked trotter meat that added that flavor layer of saltiness and smokiness, and finally, the pickled jalape\u00f1os did its magic of adding a bit of vinegarness and spice. \u00a0The beans were rich and fillng and I could only eat a soup spoonful. \u00a0This was \"Flavor Town\" in a bowl!- Papas fritas: \u00a0fried potato wedges tossed with toasted garlic, Tajin (Mexican seasoning made from Mexican chilies, lime and salt), queso fresco, and habanero ketchup. \u00a0These fried potatoes were tasty and served fresh out from the kitchen but, because I'm not really a deep fried food eater, I would say that it's not something that I'd order again. \u00a0My husband and friend said that they would...- Fried avocado with creamy Valentina slaw: \u00a0admittedly we were a bit skeptical at first, but, this appetizer/small plate was the BOMB! \u00a0This dish hit us on all points--flavor, texture, portion size, presentation and aroma. \u00a0I was expecting a beer-battered avocado half but instead got a light tempura fried avocado half filled with a slaw that was not overly vinegary or slogged down with mayonnaise. \u00a0The cabbage was still a bit crunchy, too. \u00a0Cutting into this dish was a treat...you could crack the light battered crust then your knife slid right through the ripe avocado half like butter! \u00a0The flavors and textures were just amazing. \u00a0Um, okay, I'd order this one again and NOT share. \u00a0Haha.If you're in the Kaka'ako area and up for Mexican cuisine with a twist, great service and casual ambiance, come on and try Cocina."], ["Lori L.", "Cocina is Mexican hipster happiness. \u00a0Eat your beer braised beef and your jalape\u00f1o yogurt from a metal tray while you sit at a communal table and dine al fresco.I enjoyed the Headcheese Carnitas Tacos. The pork had craveable crispy edges, the toppings were fresh and flavorful, and the corn tortillas were nice and thin. \u00a0The Chicken Mole Burrito was less successful for me. You can tell they use quality ingredients like guac and fresh chicken, but the flavors and soft textures muddle together resulting in a bean-y, sweet burrito. \u00a0The taco version might be better. \u00a0The Papas Fritas are also good. \u00a0The potato wedges were deep fried, topped with bits of salty, tangy, garlicky cheese and served with homemade ketchup.BYOB. \u00a0In the early evening, when it's cool and still light enough to sit outside, this is a great place to hangout with friends, drink beer and eat tacos."], ["Sheila K.", "I had the TINY $9 fish tacos, which were FISHY (and I LIKE fish)- in my mind I think that it wasn't fresh. \u00a0I asked the host if ordering 2 orders of combo beans and rice was enough to feed 3, he said \"Oh yeah!\" \u00a0It wasn't. \u00a0I am a small person. \u00a0My son said his braised beef burrito was super oniony. My husband came home hungry and when he dug into his chicken burrito, he discovered it was beef. \u00a0He said \"it's okay, since there's hardly any meat.\" \u00a0I ate a piece of meat and it was dry and tough, kinda like it was jerked. \u00a0He could not finish it. \u00a0He said it was the worst Mexican food he'd ever had. \u00a0So sad....Too bad...."], ["Anela A.", "TACOS AND BURRITOS WITH A SIDE OF SMOKY HAIRI love Mexican food so went here on the recommendation of Yelpers. This place is a take-out, hole-in-the-wall off Keawe St. with out door seating but prices were that of a sit down restaurant. First thing you experience when you walk in is an overwhelmingly smoky grill- and not a good kind of smoke, more like a burnt, call the fire department smoke. I almost couldn't breath! I suffered the rest of the day as my hair soaked in the smoky smell and followed me the rest of the day. The menu is extremely small and dishes are not run of the mill Mexican dishes- don't expect cheesy, savory burritos and tacos- there's a twist to each item. For instance, the chicken burrito comes with a pineapple pico and the fish tacos come with a stewed tomato and olive relish. So I didn't exactly feel like I got my Mexican fix, but the food was good. Beer Braised Beef Burrito - Could not detect any beer flavor. Very strong acidic-stewed tomato flavors. Very little queso cheese. Average sized burrito and does not come with beans and rice.Fish Tacos - Fish was perfectly cooked with a nice hard sear on the outside. I'm used to fish tacos with some sort of creme with cabbage. This one came with stewed tomatoes and olive and had a nice kick to it. Very messy to eat. Tacos were extremely small (refer to picture). Size comparable to a credit card. These were $9 and also didn't come with beans and rice. Side Potatoes - Quartered and fried yukon potatoes with spicy seasonings and sprinkled with queso. This thing was horrible. Would not recommend.Chips and Salsa - You need to pay extra for this, but the chips were freshly fried and salsa was very good!In all, when I think of Mexican street food, I think of smoky, bursts of flavor and spice laced with melting cheese. This was not it and for a hole-in-the-wall, it was TOO EXPENSIVE."], ["Jennifer L.", "This restaurant is so cute! Everything is cooked fresh and the cashier was super patient with us, as it was our first time eating there.My only criticism is that the menus doesn't offer much selection, and the tacos were TINY! For $3 a taco I would expect something slightly more substantial but it was delicious none the less.Definitely try the fried avocado. It is amazing!"], ["Andy F.", "Psst.. would you like to know a secret? I'm a huge fan of Mexican Cuisine! I find this cuisine to be very similar to Asian cuisine because it incorporates a balance of flavors between salty, sweet, bitter, sour, and spicy, different types of food textures, and sometimes different temperatures. Each ingredient is distinct and stands out on its own. At Cocina, it incorporates all of this...., almost.Cocina is specifically a taquer\u00eca (that for some reason has a burger on its menu :o) that offers a pork, beef, chicken, or vegetarian $3 tacos or $8 burritos, and a fish or headcheese tacos at $9 for two.The place is very small with seating at the counter (facing the kitchen) and outside. If you come during the day when the sun is bright and scorching, it will get ridiculously hot sitting outside. Sadly, it's the same inside, but the heat is coming from the kitchen. Pick your poison! Or order to go!I ordered the two headcheese carnitas tacos and an elote (street style corn). The tacos were very good and tasty with a nice balance of flavors. The orange relish added a nice sweetness to the tacos and balanced out the richness of the pork. I also added some hot salsa to it too, which was excellent with the perfect amount of heat. They came served on a little baking pan, which is either a cool presentation or a super lazy way of plating. I'm leaning towards the latter. A problem I had was the way the toppings was put on. One taco had two pieces of jalapeno and onions, while the other had none, and the rest of the toppings were all over the place! Lack of precision and lack of care. Another problem with this taco is it was predominantly carnitas or shredded pork over headcheese. Lastly, the corn tortilla wasn't cooked very well as it tasted raw and doughy, and it was a bit cold. The flat top grill was most likely not hot enough, which affected the elote as well. The Mexican street style corn tasted very, very good with a great balance of flavors, but it had absolutely no char. It was as if I was eating a steamed corn. My friend ordered the Papas Fritas, which was delicious with an amazingly tasty habanero ketchup sauce. However, the potatoes weren't fried long enough as the skin and outside wasn't that crispy and the inside wasn't as soft.Overall, the food was tasty and delicious. I loved the flavors, but the lack of char and heat from the flat top grill really hindered what should have been a great experience. The headcheese tacos are pretty pricey at $9 for two tacos, and the appetizers are slightly overpriced.The service was very good. The lady in the front was patient, and very friendly and attentive. From what I could see and hear, the cook was probably new and still wasn't too sure on certain things, so that kind of explains why the food wasn't that well-prepared. I can't say that I thoroughly enjoyed this experience, but the food tasted good, so I'm willing to return to try the other items."], ["Hannah Q.", "I love this place! \u00a0It's not your traditional Mexican food. \u00a0It's a small restaurant next to Bevy (great place to grab drinks after) with indoor and out door seating. \u00a0Really cute interior/exterior design--emphasizes that modern vibe. \u00a0They have all kinds of tacos, burritos and your essential Mexican foods like rice, beans, chips, salsa, etc. \u00a0tacos are small so be sure to order many if you're hungry. \u00a0My husband and I ordered fish tacos, green chili taco, t-chicken tacos. \u00a0Our favorite was the green chili taco, then t-chicken, then finally fish tacos. \u00a0I wasn't too impressed with fish tacos honestly. \u00a0We also ordered the corn on the cob that had mayo, lime, pepper, salt, Mexican spice and it was my FAVORITE. \u00a0I'm obsessed with corn though...Bottom line: really cute modern/new Mexican style food. \u00a0they have really creative items on the menu. \u00a0BYOB!

Wonderful!Papas fritas were thick cut soft potato-ey fries. It comes with a house made ketchup. Who does that? The ketchup had some chiles in it also.And Mexican Coke isn't what you initially think.It is Coca Cola made and bottled in Mexico.

I ordered a bowl with spanish rice, black beans, chicken, corn, habanero salsa, pico de gallo, lettuce, and guacamole. My bowl was gigantic!!! It filled up two thirds of the bowl and was really heavy! I could barely even finish half of it! OMG definitely fulfills my Chipotle cravings. I like the spanish rice at OMG more than the cilantro lime rice at Chipotle since I'm a tomato fan. The chicken at OMG was softer and moister than Chipotle. I really enjoyed my bowl except the habanero salsa was a little too spicy for me! I normally LOVE spicy, but this was spicier than I would prefer. Probably because the worker poured a lot of salsa in my bowl! I'll just make sure to ask for it on the side next time.My husband also ordered a chicken bowl and finished the whole thing before I had even eaten a quarter of mine!! He went to college on the mainland and Chipotle is one of the restaurants he misses most. I think he found a new replacement restaurant :) He liked OMG's food so much that he stood in line again and bought another bowl for later. Now we're only 6 stamps away from a free meal!! :) The restaurant is on the smaller side with only 4 tables, but it was never crowded or difficult to find a seat.

To be fair, I can see why people who's never had Chipotle think this is great - build your own burrito, keep it healthy like a bowl, or make it a salad, a taco. When I first stepped into this place, I peeked into the food line and immediately had a feeling this \"chipotle\" was going to disappoint. Spanish rice was a good touch, but the cilantro lime rice consistency was off. They used long grain instead of short. The limey taste was not there. The barbacoa, normally a juicy chipotle flavored shredded beef that has consistency of kalua pork (reference for locals) was SO DRY and the color was way too dark. The veggies that costs extra did not look appetizing and I believe they had zucchinis in it, of course I was expecting onions and bell peppers like normal Mexican food. The portion was not nearly on par with Chipotle burrito bowls (which normally the workers had to push the cover down to squeeze all the food in) and not to mention they ran out of guacamole... The emphasis on organic, grass fed, non GMO was great and all, but they gave out plastic bags. Aren't those banned?! Anyway, if I've never gone to Chipotle heaven, I would've given this place a 2*. So to be fair, this place gets a 2 from me. For the amount I paid, I'd really enjoy a giant plate lunch. Unfortunately this place has quite a lot to learn from Chipotle other than their menu.

Having grown up in the area, I remember sneaking out of high school to grab take out for lunch. And I regret nothing. With my juvenile delinquent days in the past, I'm happy to say that Torito's has remained consistent and continues to serve up great food at cheap prices.Full disclosure, however, in the many, many years that I've been coming here, I've only ever ordered one thing off the menu: the veggie chimichanga. And that's not to say that other things on the menu aren't good. I just so happened to find my favorite dish my first visit here, and haven't had any reason to divert from my default order. The veggie chimichanga is filled with oozy gooey cheese and assorted veggies. The crunchy tortilla provides a great textural contrast to the filling, and when paired with fresh guacamole, salsa, and sour cream, the flavor components meld perfectly in every bite. Anytime I'm feeling I deserve a little Mexican cuisine indulgence, this is probably the first thing that springs to mind. As an ala carte order, it's more than enough food. But if you're feeling extra hungry and adventurous, you can make a plate out of it and add sides of Mexican rice and beans. Important note, however, is that although the chimichanga is vegetarian friendly, the sides are not since the rice is cooked in stock. And as an added service, every table gets complimentary chips and salsa. And these aren't your normal Tostitos style out of a bag chips. No no no. These are fresh, not overly oily, light tortilla chips, and the salsa is amazingly refreshing and pops with that bright tomato and cilantro flavor. I would be happy ordering just the chips and salsa.

I ordered the Buho burrito with a substitute of carnitas instead of the shrimp. I'm glad they were able to accommodate me. The burrito was alright and overpriced.

The atmosphere was great... very lively, loud music, outdoors, and great lighting. When it came to the food, that's where it dropped. The flavors were muddled. My plate and my dining partner's meal both came soggy and luke warm. The service wasn't the best either. We asked for the same thing multiple times, and some things were forgotten or just took an absurd amount of time. Even walking in, I should have known... the 3 girls standing there just stood there and barely acknowledge us... no smile or greeting. So I started the conversation. In my mind, the customer should not be the one starting the dialogue upon entering. I understand being busy, but all 3 made direct eye contact.

The first time I went, my shrimp was overlooked. It was meh. I don't remember what it was but it came with beans and rice. But today when I went I had the buho burrito and my friend had the tempura battered Kauai shrimp tacos. We both enjoyed our meals! The burrito I had was HUGE, spicy and delicious! We also had the shrimp ceviche. I had the yellowtail ceviche last time. Both were yummy :DThe waitress told us about happy hour at the bar which is 4-7. Perhaps we will check it out next time.My burrito was supposed to be $18.99 but I got it as part of the lunch specials menu and it was $13.99! Woohoo. Love this place.

Moist fresh chicken on top of bacon jalape\u00f1o potatoes... \u00a0check the pictures for a sample of the menu. The drinks were fantastic compliment and the service we received from Mark was amazing. Recommend to go during sunset and to sit under the trellises.

Nothing was greasy or overly salty. The outdoor atmosphere was very nice with a bar area, fire pit area and dining area. Even with the recent heat wave we've been experiencing, there was a nice breeze to keep us comfortable. There is even a private room for small parties. No complimentary chips and salsa when you are seated.The waithelp was friendly and attentive. They also gave good recommendations.A big disappointment was the desserts. They were out of tres leche and Kahlua cake; on a Saturday night? Not good planning. The drunken strawberries soaked in tequila with whipped cream was OK. Hardly tasted any tequila and there was much too much whipped cream and not much strawberries. That was an expensive dessert for $7.95...

I regret not ordering food - with the exception of some chips and salsa which I thought was pretty good. I was accidentally given an order of chips and guac which I think the worker was about to freak out about even after we offered to pay for it. No big deal lol. We were with quite a big group and based on the amount of workers, you'd think we'd be able to have decent service. I felt really bad because two people in our party waited and waited, and waited some more and they could not get a drink. It was pretty slow that evening too. Our friend finally got up and bought a drink from the bar. (poor thing). Worst part was Emi kept saying someone take their order - on the microphone lol. Someone from our group ordered the shrimp tacos and those looked really good (again, I regret not ordering food.) We ordered some drinks and I was surprised that I received my corona as a draft instead of in a bottle. I honestly have never had a corona in a draft before. So this place is beautiful, the service could be a little better and faster. Let's just say they could be more attentive too. It's a great place for a date night or for a big group friends.

We went with a party of 8 to celebrate a friends birthday.She ordered a salad, it took a while but several of us got our entrees and were mostly finished when the waiter came by and told her that they were out of the item she ordered wtf? They didn't know that when the food order went in or when it was served? Drink orders took forever, the margaritas are terrible, their signature margarita is sweet and weak, like, they forgot to put the tequila in. I guessed they can't mess up beer right, so I switched to that, couldn't get many served though. \u00a0We were only able to get 2 rounds the entire evening. The water and cocktails go in the same glassware, the servers are supposed to use black straws to identify a cocktail from water so the bussers don't fill your cocktail glass with water..... Well someone forgot to tell our waiter the code, all our glasses had clear straws, so the bussers filled the cocktail glasses with water..... And didn't even offer to replace the drink!!!! Good thing I switched to beer yea? Smart like a fox right?To make the evening evening worse the band started to play! They were terrible!! and to cover up for their lack of talent they turned their amp up so loud that the speakers were popping. We complained about the volume, but nothing was done, I had to walk out, the noise was terrible. To add insult to injury we were hit with a mandatory tip! That did it for me, I usually don't complain to management, I'll just pay the tab, leave a 15% tip and never go back, but a $275. Meal that sucks, and you get hit with a mandatory tip for terrible service, mediocre food and piss poor drinks was too much for me, the terrible music probably put me in a bad enough mood that I had to pitch a bitch to management..The manager took some items off the bill. Woopdeedoo!!! She did invite us back for a free meal. I would rather put a glass rod in my man parts and break it! \u00a0I think I have PTSD from that music torture.

The food was excellent, servers were friendly, and ambiance was beautiful.Visiting from California, I have high standard for Mexican food and Buho's menu really delivered.

If you find yourself enjoying some time in Waikiki I highly recommend stopping in to Buho!"], ["Natalie C.", "Okay, so every single thing we tried (between the 8 dishes that were ordered at our table) was absolutely amazing!!! I ordered the brisket enchiladas. The brisket is marinated for 48 hours prior to slow cooking it. So many amazing favors going on in the rice too and the beans were so yummy! My sister ordered the shrimp enchiladas and I have to say, noooooooo complaints here!!!! It was equally as good (maybe even slightly better than the brisket) our waiter told us that the shrimp enchiladas are his absolute favorite! We also ordered the Mexican street corn as an appetizer (which was soooo amazing)! Then we order another app of their chips and freshly made salsa that had an amazing taste of roasted peppers! I cannot ignore the super great service!!!! Our waiter was so informative with it being our first time there. He gave us the best recommendations on what everyone likes to eat the most and what was his favs on the menu!!! He was attentive and super sweet!!!OMG...the amazing ambiance of Buho!!! From the moment you step off the elevator you are completely mesmerized by the beauty of rooftop dining!!! The bar stretches all the way across the entire outside dining area! There's nothing like this in Hawaii right now! It's so much bigger than most anything else that Hawaii can offer when it comes to places like this. It's obvious that Hawaii only has so much room being a small island, so it is wonderful to see so much space and dining, both inside and out!!! FYI...On Friday night at 8:00pm, you get an perfect view of the Fireworks show that the Royal Hawaiian puts on each week! We had the perfect evening at Buho and I highly recommend it!!!!"], ["Jenn N.", "Worst service ever. Will not be going back. Had to carry our plates to a table.

Was getting mixed reviews and finally decided to go and check it out for myself. It is a rooftop bar/restaurant. Feels real trendy. Seems like a nice place to grab a drink and some pupus. The food was decent. I loved the pan-seared duck breast! It was so juicy and flavorful! Their French fries were also pretty good. I actually ordered their Jidori chicken. It was very tender and juicy as well. The Pork Belly Flautas are a must! Get it with some hot sauce and you've got a winner. Their habanero brownie dessert: winner. It had a kick to it. Very interesting taste. The wait staff was friendly. The service could have been a little faster. Took a while just for us to get our drinks. And one of the drinks was just a beer straight from the bottle. Not sure why it took as long as it did. \u00a0Overall, it was a good experience. The food was decent.

The rooftop setting in Waikiki, the modern/chic elevator and decor got me feeling great for our girls night out. And the service - although the waiter was awesome in the beginning, she wasn't so awesome after our orders were taken. The food was good, but some were hit or miss.LOCATION Top of the Waikiki Shopping Plaza (ground floor has Victoria Secret and Sephora). Park upstairs (enter on the side street right off of Royal Hawaiian St./Ave) and go up the lot, or park elsewhere. You walk around to Kalakaua Ave and you'll see an elevator that will take you up to Buho or Tanaka of Tokyo(? Can't remember what's the other restaurant). That elevator is awesome - so new, fast, like the lights too hehe).ATMOSPHERE Potential happy hour, date night or girls night out place. It's huge and overlooks Kalakaua Ave. Would even be great for a party! When the elevator opens, directly in front is the host/hostess to greet you and take you to your table. So far so good, except the place was maybe 75% empty on a Saturday night at what's normally peak dinner time. Ruh roh.SERVICE Ok..so the waitress was awesome in the beginning. Since it was our first time there, the waitress explained some of the popular items and the ones we had questions about. She was so enthused and so knowledgable on all of them, as those she was the chef or something! Great start. Then...she disappeared a lot during our meal. We had to flag down other staff several times for water refills, ordering dessert, and getting the check. It was a shame because there was so much potential! For being a mostly empty restaurant, I have no clue why we didn't get any service after we put our orders in.FOOD A hit or miss. But we did have some clear favorites, so I will start with that.+ GOAT CHEESE QUESADILLA: our waitress suggested this one, and said it was her favorite. And we can see why! It was delicious, and we really liked the fresh guacamole and sour cream to put on too. Noms.+ CHURROS and MEXICAN HOT CHOCOLATE (dessert): oh man, this was a surprise. The hot chocolate was super delicious! We would order one per person next time because the hot chocolate was that good. And the churros were perfectly crisp and delicious.- PORK BELLY FLAUTAS: lots of yelper's raved about this one so I suggested we try it. And I kind of regretted it. Maybe an off day? It was too much tortilla, too little meat, and was just ok.-MEXICAN STREET CORN: I am kinda a super fan of this...but not from Buho. My friend can make way better Mexican style street corn at home, and Cocina's one still tops my list. -QUINOA STUFFED CHILE RELLENO: I think this was the least favorite dish of the night. Just so so. We didn't finish it and no one wanted to take it home lol.DRINKSI really like the drink options here, and hope to try more next time. But in my opinion, I had the best drink of the night...+ CUCUMBER FRESCA: Perhaps because I'm more partial to cucumber juice lately since I love juicing cucumber at home lol. This was the bomb - so smooth, not too sweet, not too strong.+ GINGER LILIKOI MARGARITA: Second favorite drink of the night. My friend said it was too sweet for her, but to me it was just right. Not too strong of the ginger and nice flavor.- SKINNY MINNY: I think the least favorite drink of the night. It was too strong and not much flavor. Maybe just an off night, idk."], ["Dan C.", "Really great atmosphere \u00a0great food. Great prices. Best meal we've had on the island so far and we didn't get raped when we got the bill.

Today's lunch wasn't spectacular by any means, but I wasn't disappointed. About 10 bucks got me a Carne Asada burrito. A mainland taco truck would have cost half that, but I'm used to the inflated Hawaii price. The burrito was large as expected, and they didn't skimp on the meat.

I found it when I was searching online for something new. \u00a0I've been there a few times and it's been great each time since.Being a self-described burrito aficionado, I can only focus on the burritos. \u00a0There are Vegetarian options, but I'll focus on the meat. Meat selection is pretty standard with carne asada (steak), pollo asada (chicken), and carnitas (pork); but, they also have chorizo (sausage). The burritos come in Mexicano, Clasico, G\u00fcero, and Super Mixto. The Mexicano is with no rice, but has cheese/guacamole. The Clasico is with rice but no cheese/guacamole, the G\u00fcero is with rice and cheese/guacamole, and the Super Mixto is the G\u00fcero with all meats combined.I usually get a selection with the carne asada. I really need to branch out, but I can't help it. There is so much flavor to the meats, that I find the variation between the selection subtle. I think you probably see the most difference with the Super Mixto: my favorite.They have combinations with rice and beans available. There are 3 Tacos, Quesadilla with meat, 3 Mulitas (like taco sandwiches - which I need to try here), and Burrito & Taco. I was so glad to see Burritos and Tacos served together: finally! \u00a0The place definitely reminds me of LA taco trucks. It's pretty legit as well. The shop serves up juicy, flavorful burritos.

It's also a good thing we got the pickled carrots & jalapenos because the tacos need that extra acid to give them some interest.We got the carne asada which was great! Thin sliced & not chewy or dry as saw dust. The pork was okay... kind of like salted crockpot pork, not much flavor. Anything cheesy is amazing! The white cheese is gooey and creamy.

Delicious burritos, tacos are the majority of what they offer but you can also get quesadillas, tostada , and taquitoes. The sauces are amazing and they have real Mexican coke! I highly recommend this restaurant."], ["Laurie P.", "Take it from this girl who has put down quite a few plates of frijoles, tortillas, y carne asada in her life, Zaratez is legit Angeleno Mexican street food. \u00a0I grew up amid taquerias and pupuserias and juego stands and when I get homesick, I crave Mexican food. No. Not that \"authentic\" mess from Cholo's. Not that Tex-Mex mess. Not anything with a hard shell. Not anything served with sour cream and french fries inside a tortilla (AKA a California burrito, that mess is OFFENSIVE and strictly a surfer San Diego thing, it is about as authentic Mexican as California Rolls are authentic Japanese, so check yo' self mother trucker). And if you are looking for or comparing this to Taco Bell, dear Lord, please see yourself to the door. Paul makes the kind of food I crave, homestyle street food. Food that brings me back to Highland Park and Echo Park before both gentrified. Blah blah blah, enough about me, here's the skinny on the food.Paul generally has a pretty stream lined menu as a food stand operator - tacos, mulitas, quesadillas, burritos. Street food. His carne asada is moist and flavorful and not overly salty, something I have found to be a problem with most Mexican places here on island. The chorizo is never overly greasy, which is freaking amazing because how the heck do you get ground pork sausage to not swim in its own fat while still being flavorful. Beans, are they flavorless? Only if your standard is Taco Bell or some crap. Real Mexican beans are mild in flavor, letting the flavor of the bean show through. This is how Paul makes his beans. There is the flavor of lard, delicious, delicious lard in there and the creaminess that can only come from twice cooked frijoles. The rice is flavorful, but not overly so. Simple and flavorful. \u00a0I really don't understand the demand for extremely flavorful beans and rice which would compete with the flavor of the meat in the burrito and your taco. BALANCE PEOPLE! Now that Zaratez has a permanent home, mulitas will be going off menu in May as they won't have a way to cook them properly for awhile. To replace them, Paul has said he is going to start making tortas - think of them as Mexican hamburgers, but instead of ground beef, it is filled with delicious asado (grilled) meats. I am really going to miss his mulitas, but I am looking forward to those tortas! He will also start making fresh juegos or juices. This is such an intrinsic part of a sit down taqueria experience to me I was ready to start crying when he brought it up. Also, keep an eye out for breakfast being served on Saturdays once they open for real. I can't even begin to tell you how freaking excited I am for huevos rancheros and chilequiles, and really anything Paul decides to cook. I will admit I have only had his street food. I missed the pop up where he made albondigas - meat ball soup. This is to me what saimin is to many locals, classic soupy comfort eating. I am really excited to see where Paul takes Zaratez and what the permanent menu will look like. You want REAL Mexican food, food that is deliciously flavorful but incredibly satisfying after a long day of living/visiting in beautiful Hawaii nei? Come to Zaratez. Seriously. Just come by and try it out. Just don't compare Zaratez to Taco Bell when you are ordering."], ["Rose M.", "Awesome beans, great tacos, amazing fresh made tortilla chips, real salsa. \u00a0Meats are grilled, fresh tasting.

I ended up parking a few blocks away and trekked my way over. I made it just in time to give them my order before the huge crowd started (phew!!) and joined the group outside on the bench.

That always makes for good times (thanks Laurie P. for the beers!). Just be sure to enjoy your beverage INSIDE or ask them for red cups, live on the edge, and drink up outside.

Most of them were some really good homemade warm chips. However, there were also some really stale chips that were a different color, size and texture thrown in with the rest. The queso was good...

Lo and behold, when I bit into the the pork taco it was also awful. And it wasn't just that it lacked flavor. No, it was the pork itself -- the pork was in weird enormous chunks. I felt like I had just taken a bite of the bland midwestern pork roasts of my youth. Carnitas are supposed to be slow roasted, delicate and spicy chunks with lovely pineapple. This was not even close to the the same realm. I was hoping the guacamole would save it, but even that lacked garlic, salt, and lime flavors. It was just an avacado. All in all, this meal made me feel like I was at the Ponderosa (remember that joint) or Old Country Buffet, but instead of putting the bland meat on mashed potatoes, they decided to put it on a tortilla and call it a taco. Hey, anything can be \u00a0a taco if a tortilla is involved, right? \u00a0So. Very. Wrong. Well, unless you are in to that sort of thing.Oh and our bill was around $40. $40 for tacos. \u00a0My fiance put it perfectly when he said, \"this is the worst Mexican I have ever eaten.\" I must agree. The worst. Actually, this goes on my list of 5 worst meals ever."], ["Elise T.", "3.5 stars really, but had to round down. Went here for an early dinner with my family.

I ordered the chicken enchilada verde. Tangy (and I mean tangy with a ZIP) green sauce and tender pieces of white chicken meat. The spanish rice was a little less thoroughly seasoned than I'm used to, but the consistency was good--light and not too chewy or squishy.

They will only eat mexican food when we go to California and I'm always stuck eating tacos a la carte or taco salad.....Even in here, my parents are always wanting to try new Mexican places. Our conversations when we go out to eat usually go something like this:Mom: \"Can we go get mexican food tonight?\"Dad: \"Yes!\"Brother: \"YES!\"Me: \"again?....please no!!\"I only agreed to go to azteca because I had some how managed to get out of coming here with my family every other time and I hadn't yelped it yet. :DFriday night: we find a great parking spot across the street and find out there is a line. No, not a line....a huddled mass outside by the bus stop. There was no real organization to the madness, no clipboard to write your name on etc. I think the aunty running the place was getting a little frazzled and snapping at people to \"just wait outside\". The party \"in front\" of us decided to go to Jose's instead and we ended up sitting down after only waiting about 10 minutes. Here's the thing, I hate beans. They were in my a la carte tacos. I thought about getting up and leaving, but was stuck in the corner (the restaurant is a little crowded). I ended up eating part of my brother's burrito (which also had beans....but in a really yummy sauce). Next time I'm going to order a burrito. No beans inside or on the side, with extra sauce.

The egg was cooked well. It was moist and not overcooked, but it was bland. The chorizo was decent that had a nice spice. Tomatoes were fresh, but it was too cold. Lastly, I didn't feel like I got any mango habanero sauce, or it was super weak sauce. Also, isn't there supposed to be cheese in this?? I either got a few shreds or none at all.

My favorite burrito for breakfast, oddly enough, is the breakfast burrito. They give you a choice between tortillas, a bunch of salsas, meats (soyrizo, bacon, or chorizo), and even ranch. Lots of options can mean a lot of pressure, but trust me it's worth it.

That's what I think of the SoCal and Breakfast Burritos at Verde, my go to place for a gourmet, fastfood burrito. \u00a0Get it to go or they have seats for you to dine-in. After you choose your burrito type, choose the tortilla (spinach, tomato, regular), protein (carne aside, ground beef, chicken, carnitas, etc.), and salsa (2-3 choices each of mild, medium, or hot). They have a few other menu items like street Taco Thursdays, \u00a0Chips and Salsa, Horchata, and Lemonade, but I go for the burritos. The SoCal and Breakfast Burrito have almost the same fillings--fried potatoes, cheese, meat and salsa choices, the major difference is the SoCal comes with sauteed onions and the Breakfast Burrito has eggs and limits your protein choices to bacon, chorizo, and soy. \u00a0Two light appetites could share, but I always finish mine cuz they are just that good!

This isn't going to be the most authentic Mexican-est of Mexican food you'll ever eat. The reality is though, outside of Mexico, what really is? So don't go in expecting that. You can however go in expecting delicious food wrapped in a tortilla. I usually go with the seasoned chicken to fill a standard burrito. I've tried a couple of their salsas, but I always end up back at the verde, which, I suppose, makes sense that it's their signature. The mister has gotten a few of the other filings and liked them. He says the soyrizo is a good veggie option and will get it if he needs to do some meat detox. He's also gotten the Papas and the SoCal and enjoyed both of those. I'd also highly recommend getting their chips. I think they make them in house, but even if they don't, they're high quality for tortilla chips. Best part is getting the salsa with it. It's kind of like a cross between a pico de gallo and a more standard salsa. It is so delicious and is the best accompaniment to a burrito. We've ran out a couple of times while dining in and they've offered to refill it free of charge too, so that's a major plus. I'll agree with another person on here that their hours are less than ideal given that when we go for burritos, it's usually because we've gotten caught out too late to cook. But, to each business his own. They must have found that sales are hard to come by after a certain point. I certainly can't begrudge that. Looking for something delicious in a tortilla?

These things looked epicly amazing when we opened them up to split them. I took lots of photos & oohed the deliciousness. Then I decided to take a spoonful of my strawberry habanero salsa to 'test' it. Now I love spicy food. I really truly do. The hotter the better. But this was crazy hot. Burning faces hot. My tongue was on fire! Yet I couldn't stop eating it. So confusing. Needless to say, we used very little. The watermelon was bright & pungent with the right mix of heat & sweet. Now on to the burrito... The barbacoa was seasoned so well & melted in my mouth. Oh, and the chipotle sauce it was in was yummo! The al pastor was mildly dry but avocado made all the difference.

Hawaii's version Chipotle? I'm in.As per my chipotle tradition, I went ahead and got a steak bowl or standard steak burrito (sans tortilla), I added guacamole and paired it with the corn medley mild sauce. Pretty much a chipotle \"go-to\" staple that can do no wrong. We also decided to try their agave lemonade since they no longer have the agua fresca (disappointed because I reallly wanted to try it). The cashier was friendly enough and the worker that delivered our food wasn't unfriendly but not friendly, just blank faced. We took our food to go and I was excited to venture home and snuggle up with an episode of House of Cards on Netflix and dig in. Unfortunately, what I was met with at home was a serious disappointment. Barely a tiny ice cream scoop of guacamole ($1 extra), frozen tasting corn, and lukewarm to almost cold food. Portions are very small as well. The tastes weren't the best either and my food was soggy within 15 minutes because the salsa was an extremely watery tomato sauce consistency. The agave lemondade was just okay.What was the most disappointing though, was their steak which was more like very chewy barbacoa cut into cubes. If you've ever been to Chipotle you know that their steak is seared to perfection and sliced up ready for you to devour... just delicious stuff. The steak here however is far from that. I think they stew it so it really just tastes like beef stew. Honestly, the food here reminded me of cafeteria style slop :/ it just didn't have the right taste, freshness, etc. seemed to be left out for a while. To me, it was very far from chipotle standards. Now I know chipotle isn't real mexican, but the food here isn't even close to chipotle in terms of both freshness, taste, and quantity of food. I have nothing against this establishment, it's just not my style. I've been to mexican joints on the mainland where the menu is in spanish and they roll out the tortilla chips by a hand crank and make it fresh in front of you, so I just can't justify paying the prices here when I've paid less for better quality food.2.5/5 starsedit: This place gave my brother the runs so we won't be returning."], ["Jasmine W.", "A friend and I decided to meet here on a random Sunday for dinner.

I got an al pastor burrito with a flour tortilla (you get to pick from a variety of options), several salsa options (corn, red, and green), and guacamole ($1). With tax, my burrito came out to $6.24. Now, I went to school in LA for 5 years, so I'd like to think that I have a higher standard for Mexican food. But I really don't haha. Verde wasn't the best burrito I've ever had, but its definitely one of the better ones I've had on Oahu! I liked that we could get as many salsas as we wanted, which definitely spiced up my burrito.

They have complimentary water and cups at the counter where you pick up your food from, and bottles of tapatio that you can take to use at your table as you eat.

It's decent Mexican food but it is still not as good as Mexican food from my Californian home town. Not a bad back up place for a Mexican food craving though. The exterior is painted in a cute green color theme, hence verde in their name. It does have that green, eco-friendly vibe to the place. They have bench-style tables and it's open seating. As an added bonus, it's a BYOB place making it more affordable to eat and enjoy a few glasses of vino there.We ordered the two-tacos combo: 1 soft steak taco and Verde's barbacoa (where the term barbeque derives from) pulled beef and the gigantic chicken adobo burrito. The steak taco was a little bit overcooked so a tad on the dry side but the barbacoa beef (soft taco shell fried so it puffs up crispy) tasted fantastic! Beef was tender and has just the right amount of seasoning to make you wanting more. I would definitely order this taco anytime. The chicken adobo burrito I think weighed 10 lbs, jk. and it seemed like everything was loaded inside that big burrito! Who can really finish the entire burrito? Although it was good, I'm not a big fan of the adobo seasoning and would consider getting another flavored meat. Even though Verde is owned by the same people as the former BC Burrito, I missed the altar of hot sauces they had there. It made the trip there a little bit of a fun mystery \u00a0when each person in the group picked a hot bottle so everyone in the group can try. We used to have bets on who can picked the hottest bottle and that's when the real fun begins because you can see the sweat beads and red coloring build up on the faces of your friends!

Too long have we been deprived! Unfortunately, our burrito salvation does not seem to be on the horizon anytime soon. But after discovering Verde Kaimuki today, I think I'll be ok. Now full disclosure: I live in Kaimuki. So you would think that I would've known about this place for awhile. Wrong. In fact, ever since BC Burrito closed down, I kinda glanced over Verde without much cause for pause. What finally changed my mind, however, was hearing a strong recommendation from a couple coworkers whom both hail from Chipotle heaven California. In their own words, \"Verde is the best Mexican food we've found here and closest thing to Chipotle.\" After hearing that, I knew what had to be done. So today, finally, I stopped by Verde for lunch. And what were my findings? Oh. My. God. Having this been my first time at Verde, I wasn't too sure what to get. Everything sounded genuinely delicious. While the gears were grinding in my head, one of my coworkers pointed out the Kitchen Sink Burrito. You know that old saying, \"Everything but the kitchen sink?\" Apply that here because basically everything imaginable is in this burrito. After mentally psyching myself up for the challenge, we put our order in and grabbed a table. Because I wasn't too hungry, I decided to share the burrito with a coworker, so we had asked to have it cut in half beforehand. Thank goodness for that call. Let me put it this way, if you've ever seen that meme of the heavy breathing cat, that was totally me when my burrito order came. Excuse my language, but holy sh*t! Half of a Kitchen Sink was the equivalent of a normal order. I honestly do not know what kinda person would be able to tackle that monster, but it will take a much better man than me. For reference, we ordered another Kitchen Sink to bring back to the office and left that one whole in all its glory. The burrito literally extended from fingertip to the crook of my elbow. You have to cradle that thing like a baby to support all the weight. Anyway, getting back to how taste, it was so good! In addition to all the fillings, you get to choose the type of meat, salsa, and tortilla type.

I usually don't get anything else. Their breakfast burrito and SoCal is definitely where it's at. I recommend the soyrizo if you want your protein on the smoother side but not get chorizo.I have been here a handful of times, each time was a good experience. They're usually fast so it's great to-go food. The price is decent considering you get a pretty hefty sized burrito. But that's also why I mainly get this. I've had their Huevos Rancheros and I didn't like it. It's a mush of textures and flavors. They also offer coffee, horchata, and free water.

Not a whole lot of interior seating but enough (and no, there is no public bathroom available).Had the Mexican Loco Moco, a breakfast burrito, the nachos, and a Mexican Ice Coffee, all for around $24. The Mexican Loco Moco is tasty! The Al Pastor is soft and tender. The cheesy queso was a bit overpowering for my taste, but it definitely added to the dish. The Mexican ice coffee is nice. Cinnamon-y and mellow, not to sweet, not bitter, and clean and light. The mild nachos still had some heat to them, and the breakfast taco with chorizo for $3.50 - that's a deal.Oh, some interesting old school music playing while eating and watching surfing videos on TV. ;)"], ["Craig F.", "I love breakfast burritos, and I've wondered how a food Mecca like Oahu could be so bereft of these when they're pretty simple to execute.

Oh, and salsa made from Hatch green chiles (New Mexicans take heed!)Breakfast is served all day, and there are vegetarian-friendly choices. In the mood for something large and in charge, try the kitchen sink burrito. It'll set you back $16.50, but even Bruddah Iz wouldn't leave hungry. Also, very friendly counter service. Customer service is a big deal. Especially in a service economy. Your livelihood depends on it, and my encounter here was quite good. I'd give the food a solid five stars.

The portions are quite a bargain too since it is one of the few places here that I actually can not finish the portions.

Of course, drinks include Agua Fresca, Soda, Coffees, Horchatas and complimentary H2O. I've had the following on different occasions:---QUESADILLA- pulled pork, jack-cheddar cheese, pinto beans, pick de gallo & salsa. ---MEXICAN LOCO MOCO- Al Pastor on a bed of Spanish rice and pinto beans covered with eggs over easy and smothered in queso.GRADE: BVERDE STAFF: Friendly and casual. Straight forward and informative if you have any questions. No attitude crowd which is nice. Efficient enough, but I hope they have a regular crew now.
