The ingredients are always fresh, the meat is never overcooked, and the food is consistently tasty and flavorful. This is one of those places where you can always order something new, because you know it will be super yummy. I haven't had a single dish from Green Dragon that I didn't enjoy.However, I do have my favorites, and they are: Pan Fried Pork Dumplings (super juicy, I'm pretty sure these are 100% homemade), Chicken Noodle Soup (full of flavor, yummy mushrooms, great when you have a cold), Aromatic Shrimp (the shrimp is the perfect consistency, the batter is light), Szechuan Eggplant (add pork to it, trust me, it's delicious), Chicken with Orange Peel Sauce.If you're trying to be healthy, try the Chicken with Fresh Vegetables and the Chinese Broccoli with Garlic.Their lunch specials are the best-- cheap and delicious! For $7.95 from 11am to 3pm on weekdays, you get their daily soup, a veggie egg roll, steamed rice, and your choice of entree.We have had delivery, take out, and also eaten in the actual restaurant. Everyone who works there is so nice and friendly. Delivery usually takes about an hour.Long story short, Green Dragon is my absolute favorite restaurant in Eagle Rock.

I haven't had a chance to really write a proper review...(sorry Mr. & Mrs. Chu) so here it goes! Talk about an authentic and first chinese restaurant in the heart of downtown la! This place has been open since 1971! Do the math quick! =) It's 41 years! WOW! How many restaurants have you been to that's been open for 41 years by the same owner/cook? Now that says a lot about this place for starters. It's a quiet & quaint chinese restaurant run by a dynamic duo - Mr. & Mrs. Chu. Very nice couple! Mr. Chu's the cook and owner of this place. It was a bit dated before...but now..it's all brand new! they totally remodeled and looks fantastic! Everything is super clean and simplistic. \u00a0Still in the process of finishing up the decor...but looks 1000% better than before. it's like a new place with the same great taste! They have a hot table up front, but the good stuff is on the menu. Order ....and it's made on the spot! all of their veggies are cut right before they're cooked ..so everything tastes fresh. You can also request less or no msg in your dish if you prefer. They're known for their Garlic Soy Sauce Chicken, shrimp fried rice, kung pao chicken, and their hong kong style chow mein. You won't get this style of pan fried crispy noodle anywhere else near by. Another unique dish to Chu's Kitchen is their tomato beef dish. Sweet and salty. Love it! Oh...and if you have room, try their chinese chicken salad (contains nuts). Its one of my favorite dishes. Finally, don't forget to top off the dish with their Home-Made hot oil sauce! Adds a little kick and small flames to your dish! Very spicy and good! Mr. Chu! You need to sell this hot sauce! I'd buy a jug! Tips for traveling with toddlers: No bathroom but, you have plenty of room for strollers. You can also order non-spicy dishes for the kids and various other dishes modified to suit your kids tastes and needs. You can also request NO MSG. Sorry, no milk at this place.

Like Mrs Chu (?) said, their homemade \"hot oil\" goes really well with the thin vermicelli of the Singapore chow mein, and it wasn't real greasy, and there was enough variety in the added ingredients for it to be a good mixture of textures and tastes. The egg foo young came with a bowl of delicious brown gravy (no, not like you'd find with meatloaf, which is often the case) that complemented it very well.There is also a \"hot table\" of prepared dishes but we decided to go with made to order.

A few days later, i stumbled in here for some din-din.The proprietor and host and server is Mrs. Chu (aka 'Laura'). She and her hubby (the chef) have been a dedicated dynamic duo to this humble corner of 9th and Main since 1971. Yes, this yr is the big 4-0! Sure, it's an 'American-Chinese'-esque greasy spoon, but Mrs. Chu is willing to work with you if you like your Chinese a bit more on the authentic side. Which is how I like it.So it seems she kinda got what i was getting at, and even said she could make the dishes I ordered 'special way.' I took that as a good sign we were jivin'. I also asked her to make sure that spicy dishes are 'true spicy', as i am not your typical whitey when it comes to wimping out on some heat. Results were mixed, with some real standouts.She sufficiently spiced up the Scallops with Black Bean Sauce, but we musta had a misunderstanding b/c when I asked her if the scallops were jumbo or bay, she said 'bay,' but that she could make with jumbo. 'yes, Jumbo please,' i said. Yet they came out as bay. i don't consider it Scallops with Black Bean Sauce unless the scallops are muy grande. So pass on this one.Buddhist Delight, which is mixed veggies (bean sprouts, tofu, mushroom, water chestnuts, chinese cabbage etc...) with Glass Noodles is tasty and not too heavy. Definitely worth getting.But the real winner here is the Soy Sauce Chicken Wings. At first I was skeptical of them being of sufficient size and goodness, as it says 4pc order is $1.85 and 8pc is $3.70, which in my mind is waaaay too cheap to produce anything but undersized, dried up mini-wings. i got the 8pc, fully expecting nothing exceptional.how wrong i was!These wings are huge, meaty, and effin' fantastic. perfectly chewy and crunchy and not too deep fried, the skin is expertly cooked and you'll find yourself licking that crackorific garlic soy green onion sauce off bare bones with nary a shred of meat left behind to spare. so who cares if you might not be kissing anyone that night once they get a whiff of you. it's all about the poultry rapture!i will be working out extra specially often in order to steal a quick sidewalk score of my new favorite drug of choice.

This is my favorite menu item. I'm an extremely picky either so I'm also very judgmental. Although these are bigger than DTF's, it was poorly constructed. The dough was far too thick in my opinion. I felt like this was just an average XLB I could get at any traditional Chinese dim sum spot, nothing special about them. Not enough broth inside either - 3 stars. Orange Crispy Chicken- $14 Definitely enough to share! I really loved this dish, perfect to pair with a side of rice - 4 starsGarlic Seafood Noodles - $20 I'm unable to eat seafood so I substituted beef instead. I thought it was good but I can easily make this dish at home for $6. Since I substituted beef for seafood, this doesn't justify the menu price. Probably only worth it if you get the seafood - 3.5 stars. Lychee Martini (888) - $12 this was okay, I didn't even taste any alcohol. Very weak drink, I definitely wouldn't order this again. Normally, I would have asked the server to have my drink taken off the bill but doesn't seem like there's much business yet, so I just sucked it up. We parked in the east garage at LA Live but apparently there's no validation at night yet..something to work on.I really enjoyed my experience here, the service deserves five stars, but the food was just mediocre.

So my review is not reflecting any other dish, other than the Wonton Noodle Soup ($5.50) (I will put it this way, I have tried many other dishes about 4-5 years back, but won't bother ordering anything else any more) The Honk Kong style noodles soup is a scarce in the great city of angels. This place is the only place I found that resembles very closely to the authentic noodle soup of the similar type I've had in Asia. You eat it with Chilli oil and pour in the red vinegar to give an extra kick.Service, however, has always been a missed. Normally, when I frequent this type of establishment, I never expect there service to be anything memorable. But this place has consistently ranked among the worse in my book. I don't understand why we rarely get seated, taken order, nor checks in the first-come-first-serve basis. Regardless of the situation, busy, or non-busy hours. Majority of the time, I just don't bother and walk up to the counter to request check and pay there.I have a really weak stomach and always able to gauge the cleanliness of the establishment by timing my tummy's movement after the meal. This method has been working for me even when I have McDonald's.

Having said that, New Dragon is more than a hole in the wall. The chef worked at Sam Woo for 20 years (86 - 2006), and finally opened his own spot. He's got 30+ years of cooking experience and it shows. Light, fluffy perfectly seasoned squid, amazingly flavorful crispy noodles, very fresh fish and shellfish...expertly seasoned...(their steamed fish of the week is an excellent bet)And yes - it has many of the Qwai Lo favorites on the menu but I would not consider this to be American Chinese food. The good thing is that they take their food seriously. They don't do BBQ much, so that's really at Sam Woo but for hot dishes, and seafood at a reasonable price - this place is excellent.Did get sick here once, as mentioned, but that can happen with shellfish anywhere.

I don't know how long this place has been here but walking into this restaurant was like walking into a time machine. Instantly I was transported back to the 1970's, only I wasn't a kid anymore. There was just something really familiar about the restaurant. From the menus on the walls, the ancient waiters, and to the mah jong playing seniors nearby (I can hear the scrambling of the mah jong tiles!) We ordered a few of the lunch specials (comes with soup and rice) and their wonton noodles. The food is authentic and good, especially the wonton noodles. I like this place better than Foo Chow across the street (famous from the 1st Rush Hour movie). The only thing that wasn't from the 1970's was the prices. But still, relatively cheap for Chinese food. Then again, Chinese food should always be inexpensive. Just don't tell Mr. Chow in Beverly Hills."], ["Shauna S.", "Yummy! Lunch specials!

I loved that the wontons had shrimp inside of them as well as pork. \u00a0We also had the pan fried noodles with chicken and vegetables, the honey walnut shrimp, and a side of rice. The side of rice was a HUGE bowl that could have fed a family of 10, so be aware of that and don't order more than one! \u00a0The pan fried noodles were extremely flavorful and although they were the same type of noodles that came in the wonton soup, the flavor was completely different. \u00a0The honey walnut shrimp was just okay, not the best that I've had (Yang Chow's is better) but it was a generous serving size for the price and we talk a bunch of it home with us.Cheap, super FAST and authentic.

We went with the seafood pan fried noodles, slippery shrimp, shrimp fried rice, Chinese greens and string beans. The seafood pan fried noodles were a little lacking. I thought the quality of the seafood was mediocre and the the noodles were soggier than I would have liked. The slippery shrimp were amazing! A great mixture of flavors surrounded by broccoli. We all had to fight over the last one. Shrimp fried rice was the perfect mix. \u00a0The Chinese greens with oyster sauce was good but a little bit over cooked. It was not awful, but by far not the best I have had.

It has a slight crunch and is covered in a more sweet rather than spicy red sauce.House Special Pan Fried Noodles (3 stars) - It's not the best pan fried noodles I've had but still very tasty.

None the less, the food was really good and inexpensive. We had fried rice with chicken that was about $6, noodles with beef that was about another $6, and orange chicken. The orange chicken was the most expensive, coming out to about $11 but I think it was because this wasn't your regular orange chicken from Panda Express. \u00a0This chicken was infused with the various flavors it was cooked in. Definitely must try it. It's a different taste, but a good taste.We had complimentary tea and just asked for water while we were there. Their customer service was not great.

In like manner, Shin Beijing operated for the longest time as Shin Peking until it closed down two years ago, only to reopen under new owners as the renovated Shin Beijing in 2012. Call me nostalgic, but I still remember the original Shin Peking as being one of the first Koreanized-Chinese restaurants in Los Angeles dating back to the 1980s. Family gatherings, birthday celebrations, and engagement announcements were made here since it was one of the few \"Korean\" restaurants that had private rooms at the time. Shoot, I even have fond memories of staring at the picture wall that use to be located in the lobby where various printed photos and Polaroids of celebrities and athletes from Michael Jackson to Chan Ho Park were affixed... and of course I remember getting in trouble for pretending I was a DJ and spinning the \"Lazy Susan\" too much and knocking over water cups because there was always a stupid ass spoon sticking out way too much.But alas, the Shin Peking of old is no more and in its place is a remodeled restaurant that has been modernized with a dark oak d\u00e9cor and rectangular tables, multiple televisions (showing Univision/Telemundo for some reason), and bumping KIIS-FM music. It's quite weird to be eating Chinese food to Rihanna while a telenovela is playing... on a side note - there are some real hotties on Spanish-language television, muy caliente!As for your dining experience, along with complimentary tea, Shin Beijing serves kimchi, daikon kimchi, and raw onions with black bean paste that are standard fare at Koreanized Chinese restaurants. BTW Koreans like to add vinegar to the raw onions for a reason I have yet to learn. I've come here a few times for lunch paid by the boss since he loves this one entr\u00e9e which is a pork and yellow leek dish served with bread rolls. He claims that not many Koreanized Chinese restaurants offer this dish. Who knows? But yea, the dish is pretty delicious. We also end up ordering several dishes family style. The sizzling rice soup with chicken and various vegetables is tasty and is needed to help with settling the bottles of 100+ proof Chinese sorghum-distilled alcohol that we always end up drinking. Seriously, that shit tastes like licorice-flavored rubbing alcohol!Okay, so the Mongolian beef is good, but the meat is really thinly sliced so it's crispier than other restaurants; the deep-fried shrimp is commendable; the Kung Pao chicken is okay but if you expect something akin to Panda Express you might not like it; and the Pal-bo-chae which is stir-fried veggies and seafood (supposed to include 8 different sea creatures among which I recognized sea cucumber, clams, shrimp, and squid) in a thick sauce is okay.After a while though, all the food started to taste the same. I think it had to do with the fact that it's a damn corn starch and grease overload... or the fact that the alcohol was kicking in. Seriously, that Chinese liquor will put hair on anyone's chest! But yea, Shin Beijing needs to dim the lights because the lights made everything look even shinier!At the end of the day, despite the makeover, the food was simply \"A-OK\" and I guess I'd recommend Shin Beijing if you love corn starch sauces and kimchi with your Chinese food. However, if you want authentic Chinese food I would suggest you drive on over to the 626, because true Angelenos know that Chinatown Los Angeles is an epic fail. * Oh yea and R.I.P.

They did a really good job with the deep fry and it was crispy and wasn't greasy or get too soggy even though we took our time with it. I'd definitely go back for seafood dishes because they had really good quality ingredients. Saw some people having lobster and it looked great - they finished it off so must've been good. They've got ESPN on a big screen if you care to watch while you eat and plenty of rooms for various parties/ events. The wait staff was attentive and made good recommendations.

They offer valet parking in the back, but we opted for free street parking instead.We walked in to find a family waiting at the front desk, with no employees in sight. They were waiting to pay for their food and leave, so I thought they must be in a hurry. But no one was coming to help them... or to seat us! I did see servers walking around, but they just looked at us blankly and ignored us. Finally after several minutes of waiting one of them came to seat us. I was already feeling a bit critical on being ignored upon entering, so my opinion of this place just went even lower when they handed us torn menus that were taped together. Mine didn't even have a cover on it. This place is advertising that they're newly remodeled and yet they're giving customers crappy torn menus?! NOT COOL.I will say that the venue looked pretty nice. They have a wall of large rooms which apparently can open into one really huge banquet hall. The main dining area has a large TV, which was playing the Lakers game. And their bathroom is clean (two stalls) but smelled really strongly of bleach.The food did make me feel a little better about this place. For side dishes, they give you kimchi (mum said it was just OK), kkakdugi (this was pretty good), raw onions, and danmoogi (yellow picked radish). I ordered a small jjajangmyun and my mum ordered a small jjampong; we also ordered spicy garlic shrimp to share. I appreciate that they offer small portions of their noodles, since my mum and I wanted completely different items. The jjajangmyun was pretty decent, and my mum thought the same of the jjampong. Neither of us were a fan, however, of the spicy garlic shrimp. It wasn't bad, per say, it just wasn't very good. A bit disappointing.Service was also pretty slow. I had to flag someone down whenever I wanted anything, and I never did get a refill on my water :( Overall, the food here is decent, but why bother coming back when the food is better at Young King across the street and the service is much better?!"], ["Susan C.", "Their spicy jjambbong (different from their regular jjambbong, I believe) is the best jjambbong I've had in LA.

It was really hard to find this place because the sign is so small. The restaurant is located underground, so right when you walk inside you will have to go down a flight of stairs. The environment was nice, inside is pretty dark, very loud (I can barely here my friends as they were talking), there are two long, communal seats on the middle of the restaurant which is where me and my friends sat. They have hooks underneath the tables as well for your purses which I love. Service was great, no complaints there! When we came here some congress man was advertising for his campaign, so Im guessing thats why it was pretty packed. They were advertising this really strong alcohol that the President goes to drink whenever he visits China. I forgot the name, but oh boy it was strong. They gave us all free shots to try it out, which we were all grateful for. They also gave us free pancake shots that we chased with orange juice. It was DELICIOUS! I will definitely order that again the next time I come. It tasted like breakfast in a shot glass. As for the food, I got the vegggie dumplings, which I thought were okay. The best thing I got here was their veggie rolls (similar to the beef rolls, but instead theres no beef, just vegetables). The outside layer of skin had a nice crunch to it which is why I liked it, and they put a lot of cilantro in there which I also love. Parking is a hassle of course because youre in LA. I parked a block down on Spring before the restaurant and it was only $6 bucks I think. Across the street parking was like $10 on the weekdays. Just drive around the block to see which parking lots are the cheapest, dont go to the first lot you see."], ["Russ C.", "Pretty hidden gem down here.

They were a tad oily, but if I went back I would definitely order again because they were really flavorful.Ordered the Beef Roll - nothing mind-blowing, but good enough with some hot sauce.When we ordered a drink, they happened to be out of the fancy syrup in this particular drink. Nothing else was popping out so we asked our bartender if he could make something special up.

Texture was perfect and you can really differentiate between homemade vs not. The lamb dumplings were perfectly seasoned- loved the cumin.

The only downside was the time it took to recieve our food and drinks. If you are in a hurry this will be a problem - we were all meeting to relax and drink for a while, and weren't terrible hungry, so it wasn't an issue!The night we went they served happy journey until 10 which was great. Some small plates, 3 specialty cocktails, and your typical hh deals. I orders the Peachy Keen. It was delicious!! By the end of the night that's what 4/6 of us were drinking. The ginger garnish was the perfect complement to a strong and refreshing drink. We ordered their version of fried chicken and chips and the beef roll. The fried chicken was alright but I highly recommend the beef roll!! It's fairly large and cut into 4 pieces. My only issues was that there was too much cilantro in it - easily remedied by me pulling it out. That much cilantro made it a little dry but one of our group knew to ask for the plum sauce to accompany the dish and that MADE it! It went from a 5 to a 9/10 by removing the cilantro and eating sauce. Overall the food was really tasty but I can see picky eaters having issues. The Happy Hour pricing meant it was worth it to me!The decor done really well and ambiance is perfect for getting after work drinks or taking a date to dinner. Located ubderground, next to Crane's (dive) bar is also a plus as well.My -1 stars is for the service. Our server was very nice but the place was just not busy and yet it took a very long time for our food to come out. I understand that the delay in the food is mostly due to the fact that most dishes are made very much from scratch, but it really is too long to wait if you are on a time crunch or are hungry.

I'm born and raised in the 626 -- LAND OF AUTHENTIC AZN FOOD -- so I had my bar set high. The fair at Peking Tavern exceeded my expectations. + Beef Noodle Soup - Flavorful, thick, and beefy broth. The noodles were the perfect texture, and not overcooked. It was also a good individual portion, unlike the MASSIVE bowls in 626 that can be split for 2.+ Gyoza - The dumpling was lightly pan-fried on the bottom to give it just enough crisp without burning it. The dumpling skin is nice, thick, and chewy. They came out super HOT, and damn nearly burned my entire mouth off. And they were JUICY! I had to slurp them with a spoon to catch the soup that was oozing out. They were almost like shiao long boas, but with thicker skin. And you can watch them make them through the tiny window in the back!+ Zha Jiang Mian - AH-MAZING chewy, hand-pulled noodles! They are thick, without being too doughy. The sauce was also really rich in flavor without over-drenching and overpowering the dish. Just perfect.But enough about the food, let's talk about that SEXY ASS BEER MENU. Great variety and they had not one, BUT TWO, double IPA's on the menu. We were in craft beer heaven. Service was also fantastic. The ambiance was mellow and laid back.

I waited several months until I finally found myself in DTLA around dinner. Walking in was a breeze and I was promptly seated. Inside, you can see workers in the back making the noodles from hand (pretty cool if you've never seen this before).Server was quick to come and grab our orders. Now everything after this point went downhill. My girlfriend and I both ordered beef noodle soup, and dumplings to share. Her bowl of beef noodle came out 5 minutes after ordering (very fast!). My bowl came out nearly 15 minutes after hers, and the dumplings after we both finished. Our server (who was great - no qualms about her) couldn't figure out the holdup but I was willing to forgive if the soup lived up to the hype. But it didn't. The broth was nuked with a soy sauce flavor and was consequently very salty. The beef was overcooked and tough.

I've never seen anything sooooo terribly small. Beef noodle soup was lukewarm and at $9, an utter rip off. Did I mention that it took 25 min for it to come out?? Everything is handmade here so perhaps they were pulling the noodles as we were waiting? Doubt it. There's nothing special to it either, except that it's super salty.The pork dumplings took another 30 minutes to come out and they were also super underwhelming. What looked to be one of the owners came out and delivered it and when he did, it was definitely an awkward exchange. He stared at us intently for quite a while and said he wasn't sure whether it was our order bc we looked like we had been done for a while. Yes, we looked like we were done bc we were waiting for half an hour! We also asked for some ginger and it took another 10 min for it to come out. But I give them credit bc the server said they usually don't serve it. When he did bring it out, it looked like he himself chopped up the ginger bits himself.The aura is great, relaxing and ample space and good lighting, but no reception (it's under ground).They really need to start over..bigger portions, better tasting, or cheaper prices--you can't suck at all 3 and expect to stay in business.Let's just say we weren't willing to spend another dime here and made a dash to our actual dinner."], ["Michael Z.", "Love this place!

The seasonal fish dumplings are my personal favorite, with the pork dumplings and the cucumbers being a close second. But seriously, EVERYTHING IS GOOD, I SWEAR. The drinks are pretty tasty, but you can skip drinks all together and just eat if you want. The only issue I had with this place is that they got confused when we had a large party and our orders got a bit mixed up, and we got extra food, but considering how large of a party we had, that's totally understandable/excusable.

The beer wasnt even filled half way and this drink reminds me of a sake bomb since the shot or white wine or beer was mainly the power shot in the alcohol.

Before eating it i spiced it up with soy sauce and hot sauce. I also asked the girl if she had any dipping sauces and she said the same thing i said. She wasnt helpful. The turkey chive dumpling had a thick texture to it and i wasnt a fan of it. The meat inside felt kind of weird also. It was also bland as well til i had to spice it up myself but it still wasnt what im use to taste with flavors. I wasnt a fan and was dissapointed. The price was very reasonable 6 pcs for 5 bucks.

Great concept but only great if the service and food are great. We ordered the seafood dumplings, fish dumplings, and onion pancake. Honestly, all were bland. Not sure if it's because they are seafood or without meat but the flavors weren't there. The fish dumplings are served in spicy sesame oil. Even pouring soy sauce, there was no flavor or hit of anything aside fish. I was hoping there would be some 5 spice or ginger flavor in the broth. The same with the seafood dumplings. The scallion pancakes were just fried dough. The service here is good though checking up on us numerous times. The waitress was nice enough to turn on the air after noticing a warm pocket where we were seated. I didn't try the cocktails. Maybe next time, I'll try something different on the menu. Pricing is premium here. Don't expect SGV prices. It's priced and flavored for the DTLA crowd. Good for anyone who doesn't know how to get to the SGV nor knows what to order there. I'll stick to DTF in Arcadia."], ["Patricia L.", "The soups were very good. The bowl was the right size for one person without making you feel overly full. I thought the dumplings were nicely done as well. One serving had about 6 pieces so good to share. But what I liked best was their tangyuan dessert - choice of regular sitting in ginger syrup sauce or fried with chocolate drizzle. I decided to go traditional with the ginger and it was soooooo good. The inside is a red bean paste and it goes really well with the ginger syrup!"], ["Ajay H.", "Food was just average - I tried everything on the happy hour menu. Everything was served way too hot to eat (better than the other way around, but still). The pork on the flatbread was served cold, which was a surprise, too. Finally, the Chic with fries was very greasy, and primarily breading. Dumplings were a bit bland, but again - too hot to gauge the taste properly.The best thing on their menu is the fries :/ Go on Wednesdays, at least you can take advantage of the 50% off wine bottles. :) Cocktails are good too, but it took over 15 minutes to order our first drinks. The second star is really for effort, everyone who worked there seemed like they were trying to get the food out on time, but it just wasn't happening."], ["Donna L.", "My husband \u00a0and discovered this place where killing time before a concert at the Orpheum. \u00a0The food is wonderful. \u00a0My taste buds were dancing with delight.

The noodles and dumpling wrappers are all made in-house, which makes for totally fresh and delicious eats. And they have yummy cocktails to boot. You can't go wrong here.The restaurant has a \"gastropub\" feel because it's located downstairs in a windowless dimly lit basement. There's a bar just right next door in the same basement, which is the perfect place to grab another round of drinks after the meal.Here's what we tried:- Salad trio which comes with the lotus roots, marinaded cabbage (my favorite of the 3) and the smashed cucumbers. Refreshing and delicious, a great way to start the meal.- Pork dumplings. Really good, but wish I tried the beef potstickers instead.- Beef roll - Fluffy and flavorful. Delicious.- Spicy beef noodle soup. Maybe a tad bit too salty but still very very yummy.The prices may be a bit higher than their 626 competitors, but are still pretty low for downtown standards.

There were some truly terrible dishes, and there were some pretty good ones too! So I guess this restaurant is a solid mediocre. I feel bad for saying that because the owner really is, as all the reviews say, such a sweet lady. We also speak the same Cantonese dialect, so she reminds me of...all my relatives.The restaurant itself is pretty small...the lighting is super fluorescent up in there as well. For some reason though, I felt right at home while sitting there waiting for my order. This place is cash only by the way.I ordered the Family Special for \"Three Persons\" (hehe, adorable), which came with the fried shrimp, wonton soup, house fried rice, house chow mein, egg rolls, sweet and sour chicken (+sauce), beef broccoli, almond cookies, and homemade fortune cookies. The total cost was $30 including tax...can you say CHEAP? We all couldn't even finish the meal since it was just SO MUCH FOOD. The two-people portion would have been perfect...next time.Next time, I would just order the wonton soup, house fried rice, house chow mein, beef broccoli and almond cookies. Those were decent. Unfortunately, the rest of the meal was a MAJOR miss. The egg rolls were something else. Probably the largest egg rolls I've ever seen in my life. It tasted so bad! So you're stuck with not only a gross egg roll, but a HUGE gross egg roll. Fried anything here should be avoided because they use waaaay too much batter. The fortune cookies were too hard for me, but it said I was going to \"receive pleasant news of a personal nature\" soon...so FINGERS CROSSED!Anyways, this is a great deal of food for what you're paying.

It's close to where I live and it has some really good reviews here on Yelp. Unfortunately I found it to be some of the worst Chinese food I've ever had in my life.NOTE: First off let me say that the woman running the front of the place is very, very sweet and friendly. The service was very fast and attentive. But the food... well, it was awful.I only got to try two dishes (thankfully). Both of them are American inventions, but they are two very popular items at American Chinese food restaurants and they among my favorites to order; egg foo young and chop suey.The chop suey was a goopy, over-cooked mess. I ordered it with beef but they use a kind of limp, spongy 'meat' product here that is questionable not only in texture but also in taste. The dish consisted of about 55% bean sprouts, 25% water chestnuts, 15% carrot slivers, mushrooms, and other vegetables, and only about 5% 'meat' (which in this case turned out to be a blessing). The worst chop suey I have ever had.The egg foo young I ordered made with 'chicken' - and again, it was served with this bizarre limp, spongy 'meat' stuff. But this 'meat' was dropped on the sides of the plate, not diced up and in the egg mix. They give four thick patties of what they call egg foo young, but instead of it being a delightful, eggy omelette with crunchy fresh bean sprouts and diced green onion and chicken, they were odd, overly browned, pucks that tasted like there was some kind of flour batter mixed in with a bit of egg. They came absolutely drenched in a nasty dark brown gravy that tasted just like it came from a box. One of two worst egg foo young dishes I've ever tasted.The place is bare-bones with zero personality (like a funky low rent donut shop). It smelled very strongly of stale, dirty cleaning rags inside. I saw the 'A' rating on their door so I hoped it was evidence that they at least try to keep the place clean. And to top off my delightful dining experience there was an extremely loud argument going on in the back room/kitchen between a woman and the cook - the ENTIRE time I was there! Then the very nice lady who waited on me got on her cell phone and started having a super loud conversation with someone. The man she called was so loud you could hear his end of the conversation from anywhere in the dining area - and she was doing her best to talk over him!Nice lady. Horrible everything else."], ["Marc A.", "I like the chow mien and Mongolian beef.

Bready, thickly battered. The pork was chewy and fatty (not the good flavorful kind) It was smothered in the red sweet & sour sauce so by the time I got to it, the batter was mush.

When it's bad like this, I try and warn everyone!My review is based solely on the food.Egg Rolls: They reminded me of a Chimichanga mixed with a donut. They were huge and had a corn dog-like batter around the filling. This is not what you look for when you want egg rolls. Mongolian Beef: Was it beef? It was very chewy, and drowned in sauce.Sweet and Sour Chicken: I couldn't even get through the dish. It has a very thick batter, like a fish and chips batter. Not the type of fried chicken you'd want. The sauce had a weird taste to it, and it had a thick syrup like consistency. Again, this dish had way too much sauce in the container.Chow Mein: This was the best dish we had, which doesn't say much.

This was great paired with plain white rice. It has the authentic \"three cup\" flavor, although they don't technically call it that.Zhajiang noodles: One of my fave Taiwanese dishes overall.

The problem is, seating is quite limited given the number of patrons, hence the wait. Luckily, literally everything we got tasted on point. I tried:Zhajiang noodles: I would assume this to be one of their most popular items, and it tasted amazing. Noodle quality was the right amount of chewy, sauce and freshly sliced cucumbers complemented that perfectly. Jidori chicken: Really tender and full of flavor. If I have to complain it would be that it was slightly salty, but it wasn't a deal breaker.Spinach: Simple, yet tasteful. Definitely worth a try if you're in the area and enjoy authentic Asian food. I would avoid weekend though, because of the wait and street parking being hard to find. Overall, good food and love the fact that they use organic and fresh ingredients-- highly recommend!

We also ordered the shrimp wontons, potstickers, and the Dan Dan \u00a0noodles. Wifey also got a tea with tapioca balls in the bottom (boba).The food was all brought out and I didn't know where to start...I took a bite of the beef roll which was very good, but compared to everything else, was completely muted by its competition. The wontons with the house chili oil...uhhhhgh. It's been a month and I can still taste it. I sampled everything else in that chili oil. Don't leave this place without trying this plate.The potstickers were handmade and fresh. Somehow Pine and Crane elevates potstickers to another level. They were soft little pouches of deliciousness and very quickly devoured by the table.Lastly, the Dan Dan noodles were an excellent compliment to the rest of our selections. A very light peanut sauce (think pad Thai...but not pad Thai...I know, that doesn't help) but was fun and tasty.We both washed \u00a0all of this down with the glass of tea.A wonderful experience, which frankly we knew we were in for when that place was packed the second it opened. My only criticism is that they don't have a location closer to where I live. I'd have to start paying rent there I'd be there so often."], ["Nguyen L.", "I really wanted to like this restaurant since it offers the classic Taiwanese dishes in cool Silver Lake area but I was disappointed. They are close on all their dishes but it's just not quite there yet. Everything was just missing something. The one thing I ate that tasted like Taiwanese food I can get in Monterey Park or even at Din Tai Fung was the Beef Roll. If I lived in the area and had to get my fix instead of driving far I'd come here, but then I'd feel I was satisfied and then have to go to Monterey Park next week. Ugh..From what other Yelpers say it can get crowded here but I guess we were lucky on the day of a Dodger game and US vs Mexico Soccer so not many people were out early to eat. Street parking in the area can get tough but I was lucky enough to find a spot.Tip: You can easily miss the restaurant as the address says Griffith Park Blvd, tiny road, and you are most likely driving on Sunset. It's right behind a tiny park, patch of grass."], ["Lloyd B.", "Best thing here? The beef noodle and wonton noodles soups. The beef noodles were perfectly chewy and the broth was beefy flavorful without being salty. It was served with the wider, flatter egg noodles. That was deeelicious! The wonton noodles were served with the thinner variety but just as good in its lighter broth. The spicy shrimp wontons was another tasty dish. Great for someone that likes a teeny tiny kick to their dumplings.As hot as it was outside, I still ordered the Dong-Ding which was great with the food. It's an oolong tea with roasted barley and pineapple. It's served with a little timer indicating exactly how long to steep the tea. Perfect. This is wonderful Taiwanese spot outside of the SGV. There's a decent selection of traditional appetizers like scallion pancakes, potstickers and pork buns. There are also vegetarian options too. Definitely worth a visit if you're on this side of town. It may be tough for a group of four or more though. The tables are small. It's counter service with a handful of tables and one large picnic style seating area. Street parking is a hit or miss.

My expectations for good Taiwanese food generally come with expectations of poor service, language barriers, and questionable health scores. This place breaks that association completely: Authentic Taiwanese comfort food served up in a clean and modern atmosphere with friendly (and English-speaking!) service... I didn't think something like this was possible! How to order: Grab a menu, get in line (don't worry, it moves fast), and order at the counter. Once you're done, the host(ess) will help you get seated before your meal. There are a few larger tables which means you might have neighbors (nice touch: this is just like eating in Taiwan, but much cleaner!).What to order: Whatever you want! Everything here seems to be delicious and the menu is in English so you'll have no reading problems! In particular, I really enjoyed the Dan Dan Noodles and Taiwanese Water Spinach. Also, get a pot of tea! They have an extensive selection of great teas with subtle and delicious flavor combinations.For the entire meal, my thought process went like this:\"Wow this tastes amazing!\"\"Man, this place is so clean and nice!\"\"I can't believe this exists.\"Now, if only something like this opened up in the Bay Area..."], ["Mark S.", "Taiwanese food is a unique kind of Chinese food that the majority of America hasn't really had the chance to experience. \u00a0In LA and OC, Taiwanese restaurants are a dime a dozen in areas like Monterrey Park and Irvine, but even in the old Chinatown of DTLA, there isn't much of \u00a0a Taiwanese presence. \u00a0I was so stoked when I ran into Pine and Crane in Silverlake - a restaurant that has a modern take on traditional Taiwanese favorites.The line here can be long, but don't let it deter you from some amazing vittles. \u00a0You order at the cash register, and are seated when the meal is ready. \u00a0This can make for some awkward standing around, but it's worth it for this food, trust me!Leaving a Taiwanese restaurant without eating \u00a0a beef roll is sacrilege, and the same is true of this restaurant's version. \u00a0These things are incredible: the dough surrounding them is so flaky and buttery...but they tasted way less oily than the traditional Taiwanese version. \u00a0The Dan Dan noodles are peanutty and taste delicious as well, and the spicy beef noodle soup is also not to be missed. \u00a0The restaurant also has a salad area, with some really good three mushroom salad. \u00a0I recommend this.Drinks wise, you can have beer/wine, or you can order boba and even Taiwanese drinks like Sars (Sarsparilla). \u00a0The boba was tasty - I had a green tea one with sea salt foam (so creamy) and boba. \u00a0Yum!So for the quick and dirty - eat the BEEF ROLL, DAN DAN NOODLES, BEEF NOODLE SOUP, and get a boba!Overall:Food: 5/5Drinks: 5/5Price: 4/5 - a bit pricey for Taiwanese food, but I appreciate the modern takeAtmosphere: 5/5Service: 4/5 - it's annoying to stand around to wait for the food, and to order at a cash register, but the food makes it worth itParking: street parking onlyOverall: 5/5. \u00a0Epic restaurant. \u00a0I'll be back often!"], ["Ponarett X.", "Oh my gosh, this place is so good!

Parking here can be a pain, so I suggest coming here after between lunch and dinner. Linner as I would call it. Their restaurant is very simple and clean. White, wood, and cement decor.

Each dish is very unique and packed with wonderful flavors to arouse your palette. My favorite here is their aha jiang noodles. It tastes like my mother's cooking. The veggies here are super fresh.

She said it's the best Taiwanese food she's had outside of Taiwan....including all the places I took her in San Gabriel! So there you go, food that pleases both the natives and the tourists. All wrapped up in a clean, warm aesthetic with great, friendly service and an impressive bang-for-buck ratio. And I love the order-up-front-then-sit-down method. More efficient, with no loss in ambiance. The only negative I can think of is that the restaurant is too successful for its space, so if you go at peak hours it is very crowded. But I do love their location at the sunset triangle, so I hope when it gets warmer again they'll expand onto their massive front patio and do \"official\" outdoor seating!

They weren't stingy with the meat and veggies. mm, delicious! [x] Scallion pancake - This was okay to me, a little dry, and not enough flavor. It was kinda a little tough to eat as well, kinda like beef jerky texture haha.

The staff members were all friendly. Seating is limited but the server will seat your party after everyone has ordered and paid. The ambiance is casual. It gets pretty loud inside too. There's a large selection of drinks including teas and alcohol. There's a small refrigerated section of cold dishes next to the cashier. I decided to try the beef noodle soup. It's served with the pickled vegetables inside too. We also tried the pork buns and beef wrap.Taiwanese food is delicious. The location they have here is catered to making their dishes less greasy for their customers. With that in mind, the food tastes good. Service was friendly and attentive.

It's better than the SGV restaurants, and their drinks are great too.The Pumpkin Potstickers was a must-try!! There's minced veggies and stuffing inside. The Dan Dan Noodles was my favorite. It's similar to the one at Ding Tai Fung. The Three Cup Jidori Chicken with Rice had a rich flavor. The Mapo Tofu was spicy and flavorful with the rice as well.I ordered the Salted Caramel Black Tea with Boba for drink. It's very innovative.

They have this Taiwanese Beer with boba too.I will definitely come back again!"], ["Chris K.", "One of my go-to places in this location. Slightly saltier than I like at times but I still come because the portion is perfect and delicious. Only complaint I have is that the price for the portion is a bit steep but I do appreciate that the food tastes clean and consistent. It is a pretty hipster joint so I can't compare this to other Asian counterparts in the San Gabriel Valley area that makes really awesome Asian food for half the price and double the portion. Pine and Crane hits the spot and offers a variety of different dishes that is plenty enough for me to say, \"I had good Asian food today.\" I would say Pine and Crane is a nice introduction of Asian food to non-Asian communities, offering enough portion and variety for customers to enjoy. I always enjoy it.The location is pretty hidden but once you find it you notice that the interior is perfect. I love the setting inside and the bright wooden tables. It's good to see all ethnicities enjoy delicious Asian food with good CUSTOMER SERVICE and friendliness. Something that not all good Asian restaurants can brag about. Recommended dishes: spicy shrimp wonton, dan dan noodles, Taiwanese spinach, three cup jidori chicken and zha jiang noodles. Last recommendation: Eat it family style to get a taste of everything. It helps balance out the saltiness with sweet and flavor. 1 green, 1 meat, and 1 noodle = feeds about 3 to 4 people."], ["Jimmy C.", "Taiwanese food all the way out in Silver Lake?!?! What is this?!?! Yes I was in disbelief. Neighborhood looks a little ghetto and parking is resorted to street parking.

You have to treat it as communal tables and share sometimes.Food wise. Is the quality there, YES. The taste and quality is all there that you expect but the one difference you can taste is that it just feels healthier. It feels like fresh ingredients and really well made. The only thing that you can complain is that the portions are small for the price you pay. I believe this place is really trying to elevate the Taiwanese dishes we all love as a child. But I cannot justify paying the price to eat this on the daily."], ["Priya G.", "Apparently I need to start eating more Taiwanese food bc this place is AMAZING!!!!!!!

They have plenty of seating and the decor is very classic - reminds me of Restoration Hardware with pine tables and simple black chairs. I like that they have a caddy on every table with chop sticks, napkins, soy sauce, and chili paste. The food is exceptional and not greasy like a lot of Asian (Thai / Chinese) food. We had the dan dan noodles which are a little peanuty with chilli paste, cucumbers, cilantro, green onions, and were delicious. #ilovecarbs We also had the ma po tofu which was the best ma po tofu I've ever had. The flavors were PERFECT and I loved the mushrooms that they added. I also appreciated, as a vegetarian, that they did not make the dish with fish or oyster sauce.They have a wide assortment of teas. I didn't feel like having caffeine so I had their taro tea which the gal described as tasting like cereal milk and that was pretty accurate! Not too sweet and really tasty.

We also had their beef rolls, I would say theirs are more on the less greasy/ oily side compared to beef rolls from other Chinese places in SGV. The dumplings were aight, I like that they are part of the menu but the wrapping is a little thick, so I probably wouldn't order that again. There were other mouth watering items on their menu that I wasn't able to get to.Over all super hipster vibe.

Even added vinegar and hot sauce to add some flavor but I just didn't like it. I ended up eating the wontons and bokchoy only. Left the noodles/broth.My friend and I enjoyed the beef rolls but our number one place is still in SGV.

I was told the green onion pancake was bland (too little green onions) and it certainly didn't look like there were many layers to it (I couldn't try it myself as it was cooked with lard). The vegetarian dumpling was filled with pumpkins as a special for the holidays and it was awful. The skin was too thick and the filling discordant with the pumpkin. The sesame noodle bowl was nothing to rave about. The vegetarian Ma Po tofu was the best part of the meal and it was also generic and possibly had MSG. Overall, we really liked the ambience and had heard great recommendations on the place. The restaurant is clean and hip.

I have always thought a good Asian restaurant would look like a hole in a wall place, but this restaurant was so clean, spacious, and modernly designed. I couldn't help but ordered as much food as I can...- Cold dishes: Bean Curds, Wood Ears, and Seaweed were all on point, lots of sesame oil, good seasoning, very appetizing way to start the meal.- Dan Dan Noodles: The restaurant's specialty is in their noodle (the grandpa used to work in a noodle factory in TW), and it definitely did not disappoint. The peanut sauce and the chewy noodle were refreshing and delicious.- Three Cup Jidori Chicken: Kinda different from what I was used to, probably because they're using jidori chicken. Not bad but it's the least authentic dish of the meal. - Spicy Shrimp Wonton was amazing, the shrimp was fresh and the skin of the wonton is not too thick which is wonderful. One of my favorites. - Passionfruit Green Tea: Wow they use actual passionfruit, there were even seeds in my green tea, not too sweet, not too bitter, it was great!I CAN'T WAIT TO COME BACK TO TRY MORE THINGS, and maybe I will bring my parents next time and enjoy some Taiwanese beer over delicious Taiwanese food!"], ["S. M.", "First of all, I was amped to find out that there was a place in Silver Lake like this. I love me some good Taiwanese-style comfort food, and I'll typically drive to Arcadia or Alhambra to get my fix. I decided to give this place a try after the rave reviews. Maybe I wasn't ordering the right things, but I wasn't entirely impressed.For one thing, the menu is still fairly limited. They have popular choices like Dan Dan noodles and beef rolls, but I still felt like I didn't have a ton of options. We ended up ordering a beef roll, Zha Jiang noodles, and Vegetarian Mapo Tofu. The beef roll and noodles were solid. I would compare the quality to a lot of the SGV restaurants, like 101 Noodle Express. However, the portions are a bit smaller. The Mapo Tofu, on the other hand, wasn't that great. It was really salty, and the sauce tasted similar to those packaged Mabo Tofu kits that you can buy at any Asian supermarket. Their cold appetizers rotate frequently, and while they taste fresh, the portions are tiny. As for beverages, they serve iced and milk teas (with and without boba), as well as beer and wine. That's something you won't always find at a more traditional Taiwanese-style restaurant. Their modern twist on Taiwanese cuisine also attracts a very hip and young clientele (it's Silver Lake, after all). \u00a0It's on the smaller side, so it's good for intimate lunch dates, but not large groups. Still, Pine & Crane hasn't quite made its way to my favorites list. In reality, most of my favorites are fairly traditional, and don't really have the style component found here. But in reality, all that should matter is the food. After all, comfort food should be just that...comforting, regardless of how you define it.

You can tell they didn't make this from the box (something that I think about when I eat at other Chinese restaurants). Not too sweet, not too salty, it's just right to fit your appetite.The dan dan noodles are also worth a try. Not too many toppings, but the noodles are still really good alone.I don't recommend their boba though, if you are looking for something sweet.

I liked literally every single dish we ordered...+ beef noodle soup - really flavorful and the beef is really tender. The broth is not as oily as I've had it before... which made the dish even more enjoyable. Noodles are perfectly cooked. + dan dan noodles - simple dish with peanut sauce, cucumbers, and a hint of spice... just a little kick. SO GOOD.+ spicy shrimp wontons - ok these are a must. THEY'RE SO GOOD. + three cup jidori chicken - so much flavor. MY FAVORITE dish from the whole meal. You order, grab a number, and snag a table. Everything is served family style so I recommend getting a few things and sharing. They have a few separate tables/booths against the wall/window and one huge communal table. The spacing/seating could use some work, but it wasn't terrible. I will definitely be a regular. Open one closer to Mid City!!!!"], ["Alyssa C.", "They had really delicious food.

I thought about going back to the Palace in Los Feliz, but they are much pricier for their dishes (shrimp dish is about $15 I think compared to $9 here)I ended up ordering the shrimp fried rice, sweet & sour shrimp and egg drop soup for $28 total. I felt like I got a lot of food for $28, but it seemed pricey compared to Golden Hen. I do have enough for about 4 meals at least, which is great. The food itself was decent, nothing beyond amazing but tasty and definitely hit the spot and fulfilled my craving! Parking was easy and plentiful in the private lot.

But the brown sauce was not as dark as other restaurants. We also got the egg rolls which were pretty basic and nothing special there.

I ordered Sesame Chicken. The order was plentiful and the lunch special was a good price ($6-$7) and came with soup and rice and an eggroll. I tasted the chicken and it was breaded pieces, just as usual for sesame chicken...but the sauce was just red sweet and sour sauce. That makes this dish \"Sweet and Sour Chicken\" in my book. Not usually my choice, but okay...I know not to get the \"Sesame Chicken\" again. Today at lunch I decided to go there again...quick, easy, workday, you know...I avoided the Sesame Chicken and decided on \"General Tso's Chicken.\" In my mind, very different tasting than Sesame Chicken. When I got my lunch back to my office...I opened up the box and had exactly the same thing I had on my last visit...breaded chicken with the same red sweet and sour sauce...with onions and peppers. Again - this is \"Sweet and Sour Chicken.\" NOT General Tso's Chicken. I don't understand people that write these grand reviews if the food isn't good. Either they (A) don't know the difference between these three dishes and just are happy with \"whatever\" or (B) they are fake reviews written by people trying to promote the restaurant. It makes the yelp experience bad. I trust YELP on most occations, but I have found a couple of bad places that have outstanding reviews. People - please don't do this.

I consider myself a fan of panda express but this place totally kills panda's orange chicken. The meat to fried ratio is on spot. We usually get the mongolian beef too which is always an excellent choice.

I use to drive by this restaurant all the time, and if you've seen where it's located and how it looks, you wouldn't even think anything of the place. Yelp is the only reason I ended up trying it, and I'm glad I did! Called in around 230pm and was greeted by an extremely Cantonese lady who's first language was obviously not English. It took 10 minutes to tell her my name, phone number, and address. Why you ask? Not only is she having trouble understanding me, she's periodically asking me to \"hold\" while she slams the phone down to yell stuff in Cantonese. Honestly, it wasn't a big deal, what did you expect from a hole in the wall joint, lol. I got a good laugh out of it.Onto my order:Mapo tofu: 3/4 Never had authentic Mapo tofu but my Chinese boyfriend said this was pretty tasty.Hot n sour soup: 5/5 My all time favorite no matter where I get it from. Kung pao chicken: 4/5 Surprisingly very delicious! Great sauce.House lo mein: 3.5/5 Lots of pieces of chicken, beef, and shrimp. Really yummy!String beans: 3.5/5 Different than other string bean dishes I've tried, but in a good way! It had chopped chilies in it which I really enjoyed.They managed to deliver this under 40 mins, and it only cost $40 including tip. Simply amazing.

Order any of the dishes that say \"with spicy salt\" or anything with black bean sauce and you'll have no regrets. But really, I haven't had anything there that I didn't enjoy. If we're being honest, the best time to go when considering costs is during their lunch special hours. The price is about half of the dinner pricing, but you get the same portion size PLUS soup.

There were a few tables already seated in this small place but by the time we were eating every table had people sitting at them. I ordered a tofu item that was not on the menu (mapo tofu) and I feel that, in my experience, if the restaurant is able to make this dish that it is authentic. I was happily surprised that is was made correctly and was delish. My daughter ordered beef fried rice and when I asked her how it tasted she gave it two thumbs up. My daughter's grandmother and great grandmother shared sweet and sour chicken and they really enjoyed their meal as well.I have read some other reviews and they said that service was bad. I did not have bad service but it was not overly friendly either. I had no problem with this. I would not consider it rude but maybe call it abrupt. Again, I was not offended because I knew I wasn't walking into TGIFs.The price was really reasonable. We received four complimentary egg rolls. The Thai iced tea was from a bottle and it was okay at best. I am very picky when it comes to Thai iced tea and was not impressed. I felt safe in the area.It is very convenient to the Griffith Observatory and very close to the 101.Would visit again if in the area.

This place isn't exactly a \"hidden gem,\" is it.I love Yang Chow. There are very few places that I would venture outside of Santa Monica to go to, and this place is one of them. It's rare, of course, for two reasons: one is that it's far, and two is that the amount of food we order can get a bit expensive. And reason two and a half is because while we LOVE the food, it makes us feel SO fat. We're trying to keep those food experiences to a minimum.We really only order the same thing every time we arrive. It's not exactly an adventure - we know what we like, we order it, there ya go. A plate of potstickers, wonton soup, anywhere between two and four plates of slippery shrimp, and a beef dish I can't for the life of me remember the name of. There ya go. Oh, and rice. And tea.The slippery shrimp makes the entire meal. Legit, you just aren't experiencing the full spectrum of what they can offer if you don't try some. If you're allergic, then I feel so very bad for you (no seriously, I do). Don't like seafood? Now I feel even WORSE for you. I don't really like ordering shrimp at a restaurant, and was obviously suspect of the dish before trying, but it's my new favorite thing, to the point where we order a box just to take home to have for lunch the next day.Dear slippery shrimp, I love you. lalalalalalalalala.It's already packed all the time, so be prepared to wait."], ["Rene Y.", "My family has been visiting Yang Chow for nearly 30 years.

The food is always delicious and I have many positive memories at Yang Chow. I stopped in to eat for a late dinner last weekend and it was fairly empty. The staff did not appear to know how to handle the calm as I felt we were being stared at to see what our next move would be. We had the cashew chicken, broccoli beef, sides of rice, and a sizzling rice soup. The soup is amazing and such a fun treat if you have never tried it. Yang Chow makes the best broccoli beef! The chicken was okay for me, but the person I was eating with loved it. We had ample food leftover, which made the price seem more reasonable. Things add up because you pay for the side of rice, it's not standard. Also, you pay by the drink, they don't have a fountain, i.e. refills."], ["Andrew M.", "Authentic ChineseIn the midst of Chinatown?Oh yah, oh yah...*chomp*I always thought Chinatown LA was a place where Chinese make food that specially caters to the Western palate. Chinatown is supposed to be where you go for kitschy fusion food, and San Gabriel is where you for the REAL stuff. Imagine my surprise to find Yang Chow.The menu definitely caters to Americans, having phrases like \"Hot Spicy Bean Curd (With Minced Pork)\" instead of \"Mapo Tofu,\" but that's to be expected. We had the mapo tofu and string beans with a couple of bowls of rice for just over $20. The mapo tofu was spicy, but not overly oily or hot, and the string beans came out nice and crispy.One thing that stands out is their homemade chili oil. They fry it to give it a light, smoky flavor as well as a light, crispy crunch to the chilis in the oil. Of course, it's also nice and spicy without being sour, which is the main reason to add Chinese chili to any dish.The owner, is a SUPER friendly, happy guy who oftentimes walks around, greeting everyone, asking us how we like our food and making us feel welcome. He was extra attentive to every table, and quickly gave me a new bowl of rice before I had finished mine, and also gave us a batch of their homemade chili oil to take home when I mentioned to him how much we liked it.

The packaged noodle scent still unmistakably lingers.Next, the infamous slippery shrimps were slippery alright! They were coated in thick batter and were bland at best. So far I haven't found any of this as authentic let alone good Chinese food dishes.The steamed rice is of course the garden variety that you can find anywhere (but in my house). The Yang Chow fried rice lacked flavors completely as well as the color and texture of fried rice. It does have the meats and veg but again, tasteless.The Yang Chow lamb, fried pork chops, and string bean with minced pork were the most flavorful out of all the dishes I ordered...my favorite being the string beans with minced pork. Again, I find little \"authenticity\" in the food here.

Well it's kind of like that minus the mayonnaise, with some garlic to it.And the string beans were salty with enough oil to make them limp and able to bend like a gymnast. Not how I like my beans.

So as you're eating the rice, expect small rice crunchy balls in between. Bring some dental floss to floss those rice chunks out.Our table didn't think these dishes were worth the hype.

However, I was disappointed with the food especially with all the hype and the high prices.I got the sizzling rice soup (pretty average, always a good soup choice but there was nothing special about this one), eggplant in hot garlic sauce (good at first...), and steamed fish in a black bean sauce (ehh not great). The sauces were so salty it was just kind of overkill. Maybe I'll go again and explore some other dishes, but in my experience it wasn't worth the wait or money."], ["Dan L.", "A while ago, my friend and I used to stop by here (at his suggestion) to have dinner after our class was over. The food was always pretty good, and I recall the service to be above-average for a Chinese restaurant. We also never had to wait for a table, as we would come during a (slow) Wednesday or Thursday.After a modest hiatus, we ended up coming here again recently for dinner - this time, for take out (instead of dining in).I am pleased to say that the food is still of decent quality and tastiness, and that the level of service still seems fairly solid. The place was alarmingly packed during our (Sunday) visit, so if you're stopping to dine-in on the weekend, expect long lines.My friend's favorite dish here is the slippery shrimp - and to be quite honest, it's pretty much become mine as well. It's quite flavorful, and fried to a very nice crisp factor. I also like that they don't seem to skimp on the amount of sauce in the dish.If you are not averse to consuming swine, you may very well enjoy the fried pork chops. They somehow have quite a bit of flavor despite being served without any sauce, and the cuts seem to be fairly lean, and not composed of a ton of fat.The sweet and sour chicken is not bad. It's served with white onions, carrots, green bell peppers, pineapple, and a copious amount of sauce. I've probably had better elsewhere, but I've *definitely* also had worse. I say give it a try if you like chicken.For a veggie-based (but not vegetarian) option, you can't go wrong with the string beans with minced meat. You can get it with your choice of meat - I tried it with beef, and I found the dish to be quite good.The spring rolls are decent, and served with a generous cup of sauce (yay!). The yang chow fried rice is always a good choice for a starch-dish, if plain steamed white rice is too plain for your tastes.The parking in the back lot seems insanely tiny and cramped. I f you want to eat here, your best bet is to just walk here (tip: the Metro's Chinatown Gold Line light rail station is not far from Yang Chow at all).Portion sizes are reasonably filling. I think pricing is definitely on the high side for a Chinese restaurant, considering that you can get similar Chinese food elsewhere (not too far away) for noticeably less. The majority of patrons here appear to be non-Chinese, which I think explains both the above-average service and above-average prices.Overall, for my lunch runs at work, I think I prefer Hop Woo (which is literally on the same block and side of the street), as I appear to be able to get similar dishes of equally-tasty food, in greater portion size *and* for noticeably less money."], ["Andrew H.", "I had the chance to stop by since I was exploring LA. Yang Chow is a pretty cool little restaurant. It gives off that authentic vibe. Place is a little small and looks old, but the food was great. Since I was by myself, I just ordered the slippery shrimp. Great choice and definitely recommend. It reminds me of orange chicken and walnut shrimp in a way...good choice though!"], ["Mark V.", "The prices at Yang Chow are unusually high for the product/cuisine that's offered, but the quality of the food itself is a step higher than what you'll find at your neighborhood Americanized Chinese place. For starters, the overall aesthetics and ambiance at YC are a bit lacking (i.e. bleak). The restaurant's front doors are covered by shutters - which may lead some to assume that the place is closed down or something at first...don't be fooled! Give the door a hesitant pull (\"Is today a holiday that I didn't know about?\"), and you're good to go. We visited around lunch hour on a weekday, and were immediately surprised by how quiet the place was on the inside; it was unexpectedly empty for a Chinese restaurant (people were speaking in hushed conversations). There wasn't that sense of liveliness that you'll find at the average Chinatown eatery; the vibe feels a bit more stuffy and bougey here. I wouldn't really categorize the atmosphere as better or worse than the typical Chinese place...just different; to some, however, the place may feel somewhat lifeless. This being said, the overall lack of of customers enabled us to grab a table with no wait whatsoever. The celebrity autographs on the wall are fun to look at while you're waiting for your food. How cool is it to say that you've dined at a Matt Barkley-endorsed restaurant? Okay, maybe not that cool...but it gives you something to do. Our orders were taken promptly; to start things off, we nabbed an order of Spring Rolls. From there, we requested two entrees - the Szechuan Beef & the Eggplant with Hot Spicy Garlic Sauce.The Spring Rolls came out rather quickly (I was impressed), and were a solid take on the classic dish. The egg roll wrappers had a nice flaky texture, and didn't require much effort to eat (you know how some egg rolls can transform into concrete if they've been overcooked!). That being said, the portion size was a lil' bit undersized, and I would've liked a bit more to devour. As for the entrees...they weren't half bad at all...until you factor in the price of each dish. The Szechuan Beef was pleasantly crispy and had plenty of fresh sweetness and umami flavor; it was several steps ahead of the mushy, rubbery tasting Szechuan Beef that you'll find all too often at the everyday mom & pop Chinese place. I believe that the freshness of flavor was in part due to the usage of actual orange peel, as opposed to the gooey, syrup-like sauce that cheap Chinese places sometimes use as a cop-out.The Eggplant was pretty tasty, as well. Lots of fresh garlic flavor, and the bamboo + minced pork combination made for an interesting contrast of textures that went well with a spoonful of rice. One would think that the above average food being served at Yang Chow would warrant at least a four-star review; but I'm unfortunately led to knock off a star because of YC's tourist-trap menu pricing (somewhere between $12-17 for the average entree). When paying prices like those that Yang Chow commands, I expect to be treated to an eating experience that differentiates itself from the run-of-the-mill Chinese restaurant in some way. I'm not claiming that every Chinese restaurant has to aspire to Hakkasan-type standards, by any means (could you imagine how ridiculous that would be?), but it shouldn't feel like any old Chinese restaurant that I'd be able to visit in Alhambra/Chinatown. The service is quick but not especially friendly, and the food is good, but not mind-blowing.Yang Chow isn't worth making a major detour/making a day's plans around, but it's not a bad option if you're in or around Chinatown. Maybe an order of their highly-praised Slippery Shrimp will turn things around...we'll just have to see!"], ["Miriom D.", "A few glitches with the tea cups and the table, but overall, the food was still great! All time favorite - Slippery Shrimp. \u00a0Next best - Kung Pao Chicken. Food came out piping hot."], ["Alana M.", "So I normally wouldn't recommend getting Chinese food in Chinatown, but this place is a go! Unless I'm driving to Monterey Park, I don't have high expectations for many of the Chinese restaurants nearby. Yang Chow is a pretty decent sized restaurant and they serve some quality dishes. My favorite is the pan fried noodles. Last time I had that and the sizzling rice soup. It's also very reasonable and you won't have to be embarrassed for bringing someone to another bad Chinese restaurant. I've never come here and had to wait. The exterior is quite misleading. The windows are all blacked out, but once you get inside, the restaurant is often bustling with patrons. They also have the world's tiniest driveway to their parking lot. My mom was telling me where to turn in and I thought she directed me to drive into a building. Gah! Nonetheless, extra points for free parking!"], ["Yung W.", "This isn't super authentic Chinese it's more Americanized but it does the job and it's open late. Always order the slippery shrimp, hk fried noodles, wonton soup, green beans and minced pork. They have valet for a buck or two which is convenient and this place takes card unlike more Asian spots lol. It can get pretty crowded on the weekends but I usually take my food to go."], ["Zak P.", "I was actually impressed with Yang Chow and the reviews are pretty mixed I wasn't expecting it! Food- Everything we ate was delicious and executed well. I can only assume there is plenty of MSG in it because like a crackhead I couldn't resist more and more. Sliced Chicken with Hot and Spicy Garlic Sauce was amazing , and not its not too spicy, just the right amount of kick. The beef lo mein and pork fried rice were equally delicious. Its typically family style portions so they are pretty good size, two of us ate hand had enough left over for lunch the next day.Service- The servers were great at their job, they seated quickly were very polite and checked on us often.Restaurant- the location itself was so so, its a bit run down and could use some cleaning up but by all means isn't bad. We will just call it quaint. Easily one of my new favorites, I look forward to coming back next time I am in Chinatown."], ["Roy C.", "I was introduced to this place by a friend, thank you very much, may god have mercy on your soul. Regardless of what others have to say, this place is great. The wait time can be a pain, but I'm willing to wait for good food. Living in LA, you're surrounded by liquor stores, Mexican restaurants, fast food chains and Chinese food restaurants. Yang Chow is authentic Chinese food. Pricier of course. Don't bash this place saying Hong Kong express or wok wok express is better. Stop it!I highly recommend the sizzling rice soup and the slippery shrimp. Look around you when You're here, there's a reason why everybody else has a sizzling soup on the table, it's that good. Parking is valet only. You're lucky if you find parking on the street."], ["Peter I.", "There are so many reviews of this place, I'll keep mine short and to the point. My wife lived it and I did not. But, first things first....make a reservation! Lots of people waiting and we breezed in. No bar so you are crowded and outside. Good valet service and that helps.The food. Slippery shrimp was the best dish. Kung pao 3 ways second and spring rolls third. Potstickers were undercooked and the yang chow rice tasteless to me. Service is grumpy and quick. Get em in and out. Decor is 1950 or 1969 at most, could be charming if the staff embraced it. But, it just felt old. Not historic, just old. I guess it's one of those places you have to try and I'm glad I did, but not a regular spot for me. Value is there, we spent $140 on 5 of us so not horrible."], ["Qiaolei H.", "not authentic chinese FOOD at all. avoid it if you want to chinese food near China town."], ["Tom W.", "I've been searching LA for REALLY good Szechuan food ever since my favorite Chinese restaurant--Wang's in Carson--went belly up a number of years ago. Unfortunately, even though Chinatown is very near us, the only food most folks there seem to like is Cantonese, which is fine when you're talking dim sum, but sucks like a Hoover with a turbocharger when you aren't. \u00a0According to most online sources, the only good Szechuan to be found in Los Angeles is way the hell and gone over in San Gabriel, which means an exciting jaunt through East LA to get there, which I could easily miss out on without getting the chain links in my panties twisted.Then a niece turned me on to Yang Chow, which means we finally have a place that serves good Szechuan without having to risk passing through East LA. \u00a0My only complaint about Yang Chow is the prices, which are exorbitant for Chinatown (all dishes cost nearly twice what they would at an inferior restaurant), but for the food quality and service, we don't mind much.I have only tried the following: Kung Pao (combo and just chicken), fried pork chops, the house fried rice and of course the slippery shrimp for which the place is famous. \u00a0And yes, it's the best slippery shrimp I've had, although it is rather spicy so my wife can't have much, which works out splendidly for me. \u00a0But in the end it's still just glazed shrimp with walnuts, and I've enjoyed this dish everywhere I've had it, even if not as much.The dish by which I rate all Szechuan restaurants is kung pao. \u00a0I've had kung pao in dozens of restaurants and, so far, Yang Chow's is the best... of any restaurant in existence today. \u00a0The reason I only give YC four stars is that, although their kung pao is terrific, it doesn't match what I used to get at Wang's. \u00a0Then again, Wang's had the only 5-star kung pao in Southern California of which I know.YC's fried pork chops are without match: fantastic! \u00a0The house fried rice looks less fried than most fried rice that I've had, which isn't necessarily a bad thing; but it's tasty and loaded with stuff. \u00a0When I get a chance to try more dishes at YC, I'll add to this review, but for now I just can't stop ordering kung pao; it's such a relief to finally find palatable kung pao! As for the interior, YC is pleasant but not fancy, somewhat classy without pretense or attitude; the d\u00e9cor is standard Chinese restaurant stuff (you'll recognize the painting in the main dining room from every single Chinese restaurant you've ever entered), but there are actual folded napkins on the tables, which is something of a rarity in Chinatown. \u00a0The dining room is a bit noisy because the majority of the patrons are non-Chinese loud and boisterous Americans who enjoy talking even more than eating, but it's a friendly crowd that won't make you feel as if you don't belong. \u00a0The staff is fantastic: all speak English fluently (another rarity in Chinatown, or my neighborhood for that matter); they are polite, friendly and attentive. \u00a0Service is fine, and when you ask for your check they get you ready to leave in a rush (but never hover to encourage haste) because THEY NEED THE TABLE! \u00a0The place fills up completely at every mealtime, so if you're going some time other than a non-traditional eating hour you better make a reservation, or be content with food to go.Bottom line: eat here; it's good!"], ["Stephanie T.", "My first experience at this Chinatown staple. The Slippery Shrimp was so yummy. We tried a clam dish but it was a tad too fishy for most of us, but my nephew loved it.The noodles were yummy and filling. Service was good and they put up with a fidgety two-year old. Would definitely go back."], ["Yralla L.", "Run away from this overpriced chinese restaurant. \u00a0Although they had good service, the food was way way way way way way way overpriced and super super super super overly dressed with sugar. \u00a0In addition, the portions were uber uber uber chinsey small on top of all these other issues too! What the heck. \u00a0I felt bad for my 6 other family members because they were thoroughly hating the place that I picked for father's day. \u00a0Oh man. \u00a0I guess that what happens when you want to try something new in chinatown. \u00a0Too bad so sad that I will never go there again. \u00a0I wanted to like the place; however, you just get a better deal at other chinese places as well as get better food. \u00a0I rather have good food than good service any day especially if the price is right. \u00a0BTW this place is packed with people who do not know good chinese food if it hit them in the face."], ["Franklin P.", "When Chinatown comes into a conversation, and the topic of lunch or dinner pops up, you can't help but thing of Yang Chow. And when you think of Yang Chow, you can't help but think of Slippery Shrimp. Chinatown can be a scary place to some, but smack dab in the middle of Chinatown on Broadway, is Yang Chow. Inside, it seems like a typical Chinese restaurant, and it is. The furniture and layout is very old school as it should. It's a classic. The walls are scattered with pictures of local government icons and famous people. The restaurant opened in 1977 and has been a popular Chinese hotspot since.Of course I ordered the Slippery Shrimp -- It's what they are known for. The shrimp was kind of smaller than you think, but the flavor was \u00a0massive. The batter was light and crispy. It was a bit on the sweet side, but the hot sauce that they had there balanced out the flavors nicely. Eating it with the white rice was simple and delicious -- It was all I really needed. \u00a0Slippery shrimp and rice was like comfort food for me.We ordered the Chicken Lo Mein as compliment to our shrimp, though I would have been happy with just white rice. The noodles were thick and the chicken was plenty. Again, I put some hot sauce chili oil over the noodles to give it some spice. Most times, noodle dishes can get greasy and oily. It was a great noodle dish.Yang Chow is a Chinatown icon. The place is a popular spot for locals and visitors. It all started with five brothers who wanted to start a restaurant. Yang Chow was the name of their home town. How fortunate of us to have them bring their home town into Los Angeles."], ["Candace L.", "Overrated and overpriced for mediocre food. It's not spit into your napkin horrible but there's nothing great about it.Service was quick and friendly and we were seated immediately for a late lunch when we stopped in.I asked for the Kung Pao extra hot and it was no where near spicy, also ordered the slippery shrimp, spicy green beans (not spicy at all) and the Yang Chow fried rice all fine but nothing spectacular about any of them.Zero wow factor. I wouldn't recommend dining here if you are looking for really amazing food. If you're looking to pay above average prices for dishes that you can fill up on, sure this may work.They also have a B rating in the window.Free valet parking in back."], ["Sarah C.", "This is definitely a tourist trap but not knowing the general LA area I picked this place for our college reunion since I was going to be in the LA area. It also didn't hurt that they offer free parking in the back for 2 hours if your get your ticket validated. I hate finding parking. First off, my group of 5 was the most diverse/Asian patrons in the entire restaurant. The waiters are legit and they all spoke Cantonese but have decent English proficiency. The food wasn't bad. Three Flavor Sizzling Rice Soup - Started off with this. It was really good and I don't think I have ever had sizzling rice soup before. Definitely a must and it doesn't seem too Americanized. Slippery Shrimp - Their most popular dish. Takes a while for it to come out since everyone orders it. Definitely not what I was expecting when it is called Slippery. Reminds me of Panda Express's orange chicken. I think it is worth a try but not authentic. Snow Peas with Water Chestnuts \u00a0- Gotta have some veggies. I thought this was made well and was pretty good. Authentic-ish. Vegetable Fried Rice- My friend is a vegetarian. Typical fried rice. It would be pretty horrible if they messed this up. I would like to mention that what this place lack in authenticity they make up for in service. In our one hour-ish dine in experience, I think someone came over to top off our water 5-6 times. They took our picture no hassle and when I spilled some water they rushed over to reassure me. Amazing service. Multiple restrooms. No lines. Come here early or there will be a wait."], ["Bena W.", "What a disappointment. \u00a0Besides the hot n sour soup, which tasted good, but could taste better, our fish and bean curd were Fail. \u00a0They tasted like the cook poured white sugar over them and mixed it with cheap sauce. \u00a0My poor auntie, who couldn't eat much because of her lack of teeth, kept yucking through the food. \u00a0And not to mention, the prices were extremely pricey, a bit off the charts. \u00a0It was $17 for sugary fish. \u00a0$13 for sugary bean curd. \u00a0What a waste. \u00a0Customer service, cleanliness, and nice ambience/environment is what makes this place a decent restaurant. \u00a0Valet parking is in the back. \u00a0My aunt, who is a pretty flexible and open-minded person, sums up this restaurant by saying, \"Pay me $20 and I still wouldn't eat at this place.\""], ["Dina W.", "I LOVE Yang Chow. I'm from the Bay Area and in San Francisco we don't mess around with Chinese Food. Don't get me wrong there is GREAT Asian food in LA but sometimes it isn't the easiest to find, or close to where I hang out. Maybe I just love this spot because the food is excellent, the service is so friendly/family-oriented and the decor is classic comfort. All the dishes I have gotten here are yummy, the mushu, the kung-pao chix, the monogolian beef, the scallops. We always have a great time when we go and we always gorge ourselves. Make a reservation, it can be SLAMMED on the weekends. We always do and we end up walking in front of like 20 people that are waiting outside.I really don't undertsand the 2/3 star reviews I'm seeing.

But it's not crazy either..."], ["Christine F.", "This place is pricey but it's great and worth it. \u00a0We had the slippery shrimp, lemon chicken, Schezuan beef and green beans with pork. \u00a0Pretty big portions packed with tons of flavor"], ["Kari O.", "My friends were RAVING about the slippery shrimp. Overhyped? YES - but they were damn good. We came here thinking we were going to order a few dishes but since there were only two of us, we just got the sizzling rice soup and slippery shrimp. Everything was delicious (what food isn't when filled with sodium, starch, and MSG) but the prices were high. 17 bucks for the slippery shrimp (but the portion is HUGE) and majority of the dishes range from 8-30 bucks. Most of them around the 15 dollar range. Had a huge headache afterwards because of the jam packed MSG/sodium. Definitely tasted good at the moment though. I would probably come back with a big group so i would eat less and try more. Service was great. Warning : they charge for steamed rice"], ["courtney c.", "Pretty good Chinese food!I was happy with the slummy shrimp dish and the stringbean bean curd dish.The dumplings were not outstanding here...I would go to Alhambra or elsewhere for some amazing dumplings.It's was super clean and nicely air conditioned in the restaurant.Our bill was $38.00 for the three items."], ["Yo M.", "Pros: the food is good, they are known for the slippery shrimp, we also enjoyed string beans with minced chicken and veggie fried rice Con: the server came by to take our order and deliver the bill, we went through almost all of our meal waiting for our rice until another server noticed we kept looking around for our server. Also, call ahead to make a reservation. Otherwise you'll have a long wait. The food is worth 4 stars however this review takes service into consideration."]]}
