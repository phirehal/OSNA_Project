{"Tsuri": [], "Sushi Zo": [], "Sushi Ippo": [["Felix L.", "Eating sushi is a lose-lose situation to me. I find it unsatisfying to eat 10 pieces of sushi for $20 to $25 and then fill up with cheap pizza or hamburger afterwards. For the same price, the more reasonable alternative to me is AYCE sushi, where I can order as much as I need to be full, although the quality of seafood is usually compromised and sometimes the food is actually inedible due to problems with the preparation of fish or rice. The best scenario for me is to find AYCE sushi service that is up to the standards of basic Japanese sushi bars, but then so far, none exists in LA. After hearing about newly opened Sushi Ippo and sold on their Yelp description of \"Premium quality sushi\", I stopped by for lunch. I didn't know what to expect, since there were no photos of the menu uploaded on Yelp. Turns out that this restaurant is still in soft opening phase. The servers were still learning the table numbers and trying to figure out when to take away finished plates.After browsing the menu, I found the sushi variety to be fairly \"run of the mill\". There were no premium fish as I thought there might be. One unique item was called the \"white fish volcano\", a baked white fish smeared with a mayonnaise or cheese-based sauce.I noticed that the chefs at Sushi Ippo sliced the fish very thin and placed it on top of a very small ball of rice. One of the energetic chefs who had previously worked at Morimoto in Napa told me the motto of Sushi Ippo - \"we don't want to fill up customers with rice\". If you like the nigiri style at Sake2Me, then you'll probably like the sushi here also. Personally, I found the rice to be a bit problematic; in fact it was probably the worst aspect of the meal. The rice consistently tasted a tad more salty than sweet, which was a weird combination. In addition, the rice was hardly molded into a tight ball, so the grains often separated without effort when I attempted to pick up the nigiri. Sometimes the grains stuck onto the plate. It was a challenge to pick up the fish and rice without one element collapsing.Moreover, the chefs appeared to only use one type of topping for the nigiri - raw onions - which wasn't very thoughtful or interesting. It does complement albacore, but does not really pair with red snapper or mackerel, I think there are better sauces for those types of fish. The final issue is one that most AYCE sushi bars seems to have - for the sake of speed, all the fish is pre-sliced in large batches and then stored back into the refrigerator. As a result, the tuna had a noticeable freezer burn mouthfeel. Despite these problems, there were many aspects in which Sushi Ippo outperformed their competitors. Most of the fish were reasonably fresh for AYCE standards. Particularly, the octopus and squid were very tender and arguably the best I had for AYCE. My other favorite was the albacore tataki with a thick meaty texture and addictive smokey flavor. All of the other fish besides the tuna were very standard. Sushi Ippo should be recognized for its ultra clean sushi bar and seafood storage, plus the cheerful attitude of the sushi chefs' which is not easy to find at AYCE sushi bars. Finally, this place is appealing because even during lunch time, there were at least 5 sushi chefs and some kitchen helpers available. The food was prepared quickly - I never waited more than 5 minutes for an order to be brought out. At the moment, it's possible to be in and out for AYCE sushi within a 1 hour lunch break."], ["Ann K.", "All you can eat sushi. ENOUGH SAID.It's about 20 dollars for lunch and about 30 bucks for dinner. The menu is extensive and includes all appetizers, salads, rolls, as well as nigiri. The fish itself is decent for an all you can eat. GO NOW as it is their grand opening. Restaurants usually tend to use better quality ingredients when they first open. Lack of customers lead to worse quality overtime. I think it's refreshing to have an all you can eat sushi restaurant right in the heart of Ktown. However, we all know the pitfalls of an all you can eat sushi restaurants (e.g. TODAI). It's really important to find that right medium between the quality of the fish and the price in an AYCE restaurant. I think having a continium of customers will ensure freshness. As fellow sushi lovers out there know, FRESHNESS IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE WHEN IT COMES TO FISH."], ["Alice C.", "New AYCE sushi place run by Korean, but the sushi quality is pretty good, and it is really good in AYCE standard. AYCE include not just sushi, but a lot of other dishes that include udon, yakisoba, and even bulgogi. Basically you can order three rounds, and they will even let you order one round of uni, but everything else you can order one order per person each round. Some of my favorite is hamachi, unagi, and they have really good roll. Tempura is also good.They do have rules of not wasting rice, but they don't put a lot of rice with each nigiri. Decor is good, the table is a bit too high for me. Service is really great though. $20 for lunch, $30 for dinner, and you can also order el la carte."], ["Christina J.", "Second time coming here for the AYCE.What really bothers me about this place is that even though it is rarely busy when I visit, they still manage to get my order, that is written down on their AYCE paper, wrong. The first time I came here with my sister and mom, there was a fly in my miso soup. Instead of believing that there was a fly, they had every member of the waitstaff and the manager inspect to verify that it was indeed a fly, which I found to be a bit insulting. After the fly incident, we waited for more than 20 minutes for the salad that we ordered to never be served to us, among other food to be missing. During our second round of ordering, we noticed that the quality in the fish dropped from a 7 or 8 to a serious 2. The fish that was served the second time around was horribly dry and had very bad freezer burn.Second visit, again not busy at all, food is missing/never served and waitstaff get what is brought out wrong. When I brought up that food was not served, waiter says he will take a look at what has happened and never came back. Had to flag down another waiter to let him know that I didn't want what was missing and to just bring the check. Really annoying to do considering there were less than 10 people in the entire restaurant. \u00a0The sushi is not terrible in quality, but seriously lacking or inconsistent in the service department. Gave this place two tries and will only be coming back as a last resort."], ["Jen R.", "ITS ABOUT TIME they open up an ALL YOU CAN EAT sushi place in ktown. It's kinda weird because most AYCE sushi places I know ARE usually owned by koreans.. hmmmm. Anyways, this restaurant is located on the first floor on the mercury building. Parking is free right behind the restaurant.I went here on a Sunday night with 3 other people. Dinner AYCE is around $28. The variety you get to choose for your AYCE is pretty good, and the quality is also very good for its price. Some of my favorites were the Peppered Tuna, Mackerel, halibut and UNI (only 1 order of uni per person for AYCE). I was dissapointed that they didn't have sweet shrimp on their list! :( 5/5I think their service was OK. The staff was very friendly and easy to approach. however, there is definitely room for improvement. It was hard to understand our server. Her english was not good and she had trouble understanding our order. and I had trouble understanding what she was saying... \u00a0Also, they take forever on their ROLL ORDERS. We ordered a roll in the beginning with our nigiri orders, and our roll didn't come out until the end of our third round of nigiri orders. lol. 4/5FYI They don't have their permit to sell alcohol yet, and this was as of 9/27. I'm sure they will be getting it anytime soon!I thought this place would be packed with younger crowds, but it was both older and younger crowds. The ambiance was like a bar atmosphere when we went during dinner time - Pretty dark and had purple-ish lighting.I will definitely come back since this is the ONLY ayce sushi place in ktown right now - as long as they keep up the quality of the fish, I think this place will soon be packkkked with people."], ["Kristy N.", "Excellent place for sushi AYCE in K town.I really like there services \u00a0sometimes \u00a0little \u00a0busy but still so good sushi in town."], ["Ivy E.", "Sushi Ippo welcome to the neighborhood!

Was kind of annoyed when it wasn't anywhere to be found on the menu and they didn't tell us until we started to order food that this was the case. On weekends the lunch AYCE situation is ~$30, which makes for a pretty pricey lunch. BF and I ordered some apps but mostly went HAM on sushi. Some of the salmon we had was so fatty and decadent and their sushi comes with pretty small portions of rice, which let us fill up on the good stuff. Sort of made up for the higher weekend lunch prices. However they're still working out the kinks - no alcohol license still (even though all their signage advertises sushi and sake) and they still have issues with staffing (like others have mentioned). Poor server had almost 10 tables before another guy came to help. This and the pricing issues puts them somewhere between a 3- and 4-star review but giving them the benefit of the doubt here since I think they're technically still operating under a \"soft\" opening. Also free parking! Whoop whoop!"], ["Edward C.", "I went to get sushi with a couple of close friends for a birthday dinner. At first thought it was a really nice,clean and big place. But as soon as I sat down and pulled my seat closer to the table the chair had a (needle like) piece of metal sticking out that cut my finger. I told the manager about it and all he did was say sorry and didn't even offer To change the chair for me. I then wanted to order but I didn't know a sushi restraunt can run out of almost all sushi... Spent 200 to get a cut on my finger and to find out the all you can  eat sushi menu was limited to about 5 options of nigiri and rolls ... I guess I can't blame anyone but myself for trying to save a little money on sushi .... Go and check this place out for yourselves."], ["Cho L.", "Stopped by after a busy day at work. Wanted to try it out since it had opened recently. Ambience was nice, clean, and bigger than what I thought it would. Staff was attentive and knowledgeable of what they were serving. Me and my friend had the dinner all you can eat which was about $28 \u00a0per person. We had almost every kind of sushi on list. Our favorite was of course, the uni. The first round of uni is included in the all you can eat and there on are only $2.99 per order. We ended up ordering more uni since it was soooo good and fresh. Another new favorite of mine was the spicy miso. Never tried it spicy miso but it kind of looked like Tom Yum but tasted like the miso ramen broth. Will definitely be going back soon."], ["Marie M.", "Ventured out to the heart of K-town with the mister last Friday night to try this \"hot new\" sushi joint people have been raving about in Yelp. Super disappointed! It was truly an Epic fail. We had such a hard time finding this place. The gps kept leading us to the H-Mart building. We park and walk around only to find that it was across the street. We get stuck in the crowd letting out from the concert across the street. \u00a0Finally find parking inside the parking structure of the restaurant building. We follow the signs from the parking lot pointing to the restaurant leading us to the front entrance on Wilshire Blvd, which was closed. So we had to back track and walk around the parking structure. Finally get to the restaurant only to be greeted by someone saying there's no more AYCE at 10 PM. To our disappointment, we agree to do a la carte. Tried to order the beers on their menu, only to be told that they don't sell liquor yet since they're still waiting for the license. Come on! Why even put it on the menu?! Ridiculous!!! Didn't find anything extraordinary about this place. Very overpriced. Sushi was ok. We dropped $90 for a meal that was not even worth half of what we spent. Too bad this place disappointed me. It had such potential. Never coming back again."], ["Audrey C.", "Went in for dinner at around 9 and ordered the all you can eat dinner and they ran out of practically everything.... No shrimp no halibut no uni .... Whats the point of an all all you can eat sushi when you say you dont have all the expensive and delicious entrees.... Half way into the dinner a small bug came out of my dish and all the manager did was say sorry i have nothing to say.... First time here but a horrible experience."], ["Peyton M.", "Didn't order the ayce. We ordered 3 rolls, sweet shrimp, scallop, and one other. I will list the rolls and sushi that were a miss. The portions are very small here.-crawfish roll, over priced and the portion was small. The crawfish was not crispy and was very salty.- uni, for two pieces they were VERY tiny. 8.95 for 2 tiny pieces is definitely not worth it. Every other place I have gone, the size was twice as much for the same price.-salmon hand roll. Three tiny pieces were in the hand roll. 5.00, no thanks.I definitely would not come back here to order off the menu, instead I would do the all you can eat.

Restaurant was half occupied but waited aboit 15 min to be seated (I guess because of lack of servers). We sat at the table with booth on one side and chairs on the other side. Booth seats were sunken in and low so if youre short, might be u comfortable because the table is too high. Our first round came out pretty fast.. about 10 minutes? Their quality of sushi was better than any ACE \u00a0sushi ive ever had. Obviously you cant compare it to places like sugarfish, sushi zo, etc because its AYCE. You get what you pay for you know?I liked how they didnt give huge portions of rice for their sushi and their fish was was on the fresh side. Uni was so so because the quality wasnt that great but it wasnt gross. Their service is great and they are attentive to your needs.. they keep watch and when your'e done with a plate, take it away asap. Refill water if its empty, etc.I might want to come try lunch too one day. Will def be back."], ["Hwang J.", "Great great sushi for the priceMostly ayce sushi have too much rice so that you can hardly feel the sashimi but this place is where you can have real sushi with not too much rice"], ["Esther N.", "Came back here again this time for lunch... Ill get staright tk the point again:Service- still attentive. Cant complain.Food- the rolls and some sushi (esp salmon) are still great... But the rest of the sushi left an unpleasant aftertaste. It felt like as if the fish were not cleanes properly, leaving hints of bitter bloody taste in my mouth. The unpleasant taste became stronger after drinking water. Hm.. Makes me want to think if its worth paying $20 for unlimited.While the spicy miso soup was great, the udon was extremely sweet. In conclusion... I will go back only for rolls and some sushi."], ["Michelle C.", "I didn't do the all you can eat option but ordered the rolls separately. We ordered 2 rolls at first and the other 3 later. I think the server got confused that we were doing the ayce option and the later 3 rolls were substantially smaller.

Also there were a lot of servers but it was very disorganized and we still didn't get good service which was weird... Won't be coming back."], ["Sugean P.", "I am surprised it took this long for an AYCE sushi joint to open in la. There's a bunch in riverside where I went to college but you'd think a huge bustling city like la would've already had one by now? LolAnyway, I tried this place out w a couple friends for dinner. Dinner price was about $30 and they had a huge selection on their menu. Not just nigiri and rolls, but they had udon, yakisoba, chicken etc. like a lot of people here mentioned, they just opened so the servers are still learning the rolls and are a little slow. However, a lot of them don't speak English very well. One of the servers were explaining something to us and then had to stop and ask if we knew Korean & lucky for her, we did lol. (Note to management: yknow non-Koreans love ayce sushi too right? You guys should def hire some more servers who are bilingual. In ktown?! those are not hard to find haha)Service was friendly enough though and I have no complaints there. But lemme get to the food...it was amazing! Obviously the slices of fish on their rolls are pretty thin but this is pretty common at ayce. But the quality was decent and they didn't pack everything w rice which I looovvvved! However, and I'm gonna go off on a bit of a tangent here, I'm a picky eater and I hate cucumbers (sue me). I requested no cucumbers on all the rolls w our female server for the first round and she said she will let the chefs know. Great! For the second round, I requested no cucumbers and a guy server comes over to us and says for ayce, there are no substitutions. Ok..? I mentioned that they did it for us the first round and he said it was a one time thing and substitutions in general are not allowed. I asked him if the rolls are premade and he said yes. So yeah there you go yelpers. Lol the rolls here are premade. I didn't want to cause any trouble so I told him it's fine and to just make them as is. I'm just a picky eater which is all on me but if someone were deathly allergic to something in their premade rolls..is that too bad for them? They're just gonna have to drop dead in Sushi Ippo? That's another rule management should change. The food was great (but we'll see if the quality is still there once the restaurant is more established). Service was good but as a former sushi server, I noticed a lot of things that could be worked on (i.e don't take away plates when there's still food on them and customers are still working on them! They did this to us several times and at one point my friend got pissed lol) I still really liked it here though and I know they are still training their employees and working on kinks here and there. Sushi Ippo is still a godsend and I'm excited to try them out again :)****edit****So the manager just messaged me saying that the rolls are not premade and are made fresh.

It's a pretty casual setting where you sit, fill out an order form, and watch your rolls come to life. It's that sushi bar feel but less pretentious. Overall though I felt like the rolls weren't as flavorful as what I was accustomed to at Sugar Fish and it was nothing to write home about.

It's been in my bookmarks forever and finally got to check this place out! I came on a Monday 5pm and it was pretty much empty. I started out with the 4 roll for $13! I got the daily special (toro), scallops, salmon, and blue crab. Everything comes made to order so I was told to eat it right away when the chef gives it to you.EERREMAHHGOD! The rolls were so good! The seaweed was so crispy and broke so perfectly in my mouth. The rice was warm and complemented the cold fish in the middle. I love every single roll except the blue crab. It was kinda boring and made me want another to finish it off right. So I ordered the yellowtail and that helped me end a perfect meal.They were nice enough just to add it as a 5 roll combo and the total was $22 with tip included.

It's a handroll restaurant created by Sugarfish. It's a bar type seating here. It's very simple. The fish all chopped up. The most important parts to all this is the nori and rice. The rice is just delicious! The nori is fresh and crunchy. I ordered the 4 rolls for 13.50. There's also a 16% service charge and they recommend no tipping. The 4 rolls started with the toro handroll, then the salmon handroll, 3rd I went with a cucumber handroll, and finished with the blue crab handroll. I wish they open more locations of this awesomeness! Recommendation: choose a pre-set handroll menu"], ["Grace C.", "Awesome place for quick eats! Might be the best deal in LA!

I'm sad it's so far :(Walk in, take a menu and use their little golf pencils to mark your order as you wait for a seat. You'll have to seat yourself around their bar and hand them your order sheet. They then make your hand rolls one at a time so the nori stays crisp while you enjoy the deliciously wrapped fish in a bed of warm rice. Ohmagerd... Sooooooooo gooooooooood!!! Nom Nom Nom... Once you're finished, ask for the check and take it to the register to pay. That's it. Simple, right?! Enjoy :D"], ["Kayla M.", "I have died and gone to hand roll heaven!No seriously, this place is AMAZING! Same owners as Sugarfish so the concept is similar. Prompt and speedy service. Your meal will not last longer than 45 minutes. You are in and out without even noticing how quickly time went. Self-serve seating so the line can get sort of crazy. I was informed that there were only 24 seats total at their sushi bar so just imagine how crowded this restaurant gets during peak hours! Luckily, I arrived with my party of 4 just in time. With about 10 people ahead of us, the wait was only 20-25 minutes at best. Not bad at all considering that there were people waiting down the street when we left. Now for the hand rolls...sensational. Like I can't even express how pleased my tastebuds were. I ordered the 4 hand rolls meal that included the daily special (yellowtail), salmon, toro, and bay scallop rolls. Favorite of the night was the bay scallop hand roll. It was just phenomenal!! I thought about it all night after, seriously. A friend ordered the sashimi of the night (halibut) and oh man. Delicious!! Like nothing I've ever tasted before. They also serve their sake cold and in this adorable glass jar. You can opt to take the jar home with you also! Super cool. All in all, this was the best meal I've had in a very long time. I look forward to coming back!"], ["Grace C.", "LOVE!!I am a big fan of sugarfish so when I heard they opened a handroll bar version- I was ecstatic. \u00a0Luckily it lived up to its name, my first visit was amazing and I now go whenever I find the time.

I came here with my friend on a Monday around 4pm and there was no one here. I was excited because I've been waiting to come here for so long! I ordered the 5 hand roll combo for $17.50 (including tax and tip was $22). I was really blown away by the toro hand roll, this one came out first as it was the daily hand roll. This was by far the BEST one. It also came with salmon, blue crab, scallop, and lobster. The others were very good but did not compare to the toro for me. I think the best part about their hand rolls are the warm rice and the crispy warm seaweed it is wrapped in. It really makes the hand roll so awesome. I can eat here all day! Except that parking is a pain. You can park in the garage but it's usually pretty expensive. After eating at this place, \u00a0I am dying to try sugarfish now. This place is a must eat for those who appreciate good fresh hand rolls!!!"], ["Michael M.", "I really like this concept. Sushi, but they only serve hand rolls and have a sashimi option. They don't use plates, just paper place settings and plastic trays and cups. There are no tables, just a large bar. This makes it very quick with a high rate of turnovers. All the rolls are very good. They roll them super quick and i usually get about five hand rolls. The lobster and toro are my favorite. You have soy sauce, ginger, and wasabi, and thats about it. Very simple but good quality of fish and great warm rice. The staff is very nice, especially the manager. There is usually a line to get a bar seat, but it goes pretty quick. The price is very reasonable for what you get. The only downside is that parking can be tough."], ["Stephanie C.", "Oh, how I'd love to have a burrito-sized blue crab hand roll...I'm glad we live ~15 miles away from KazuNori, because if it were a neighborhood joint, we'd be forming a fast and pricey habit at KazuNori. \u00a0Simple, fresh, and delicious. \u00a0They could stuff the rolls a bit more to balance out the rice portion.My only downer is that everything they use is disposable, though the plates, cups, etc. looked compostable. \u00a0Nonetheless, the thought of all those throwaways make me frown."], ["Sarah L.", "Was looking for a quick lunch in DTLA over the weekend and was in the mood for sushi. I've been to the sister restaurant, Sugarfish, but didn't really want to stop there for a lengthy dine-in experience. To my surprise, I found the perfect answer... Kazunori! Yes, the prices are still on the steeper side, but the quality of the fish, the signature warm rice, plus the crunchy nori exterior make it completely worth it. We got the 5 piece (toro, scallop, salmon, blue crab, and lobster). The hand rolls were made and placed in front of me one at a time. It's as if the chef was orchestrating a sushi hand roll meal masterpiece. The only comment I have is that the seating is limited and is a bit unorganized. We didn't realize until having stood in line for a good 10 minutes that it was free seating; the party in front of us was not filling in the open seats because they were waiting to sit together (note to self: not good for groups). I wish that these guys were on my favorite delivery app, rushorder. I've tried postmates, but they take way too long and get my order wrong most of the time. Until then, I guess I will just have to hope to get seated and dine-in.Will definitely be back!"], ["Lauren M.", "How could a menu so simple, with food so simple, be so good? I ordered the 4 hand roll set menu, which included the toro, scallops, salmon, and crab. They were all delicious. The warm rice and crunchy seaweed put them all over the top. If I had to pick a favorite, maybe I would choose the scallops and toro, but they were all bomb! Believe the scallop hand roll was tossed in a light/sweet mayo, which melted in your mouth. Loved the set up. One counter with one sushi maker. Got a roll every 5 minutes or so (with a full counter)."], ["Anthony B.", "Simple. Fast. Good.Sit down. Mark what you want on the menu.

My favorite would be the blue crab roll and also the lobster roll. The food is filling, but it doesn't make me feel like I overate. The setup of the restaurant is like a small bar so it was a completely different dining experience. It operates just like an actual bar because the staff goes around asking if the customer needs anything else and they'll just add the items to their tab haha I thought that the price of the individual handrolls were pretty pricey. Just a cucumber roll is $4 and the most expensive is $4.75 for the lobster roll. I would suggest getting either the 3, 4, or 5 handroll sets because they're cheaper! Definitely going to come back here!"], ["Candice N.", "It's no secret I'm a huge fan of Sugarfish, so when I heard that Kazu Nori was opening in Downtown LA, it was a trek in high heels I was willing to make.

You get to choose from a combo of three, four, or five hand rolls (a set menu), or individual hand rolls. \u00a0A customer will be quickly reminded of the hand rolls at Sugarfish, including the advice that the hand roll be consumed immediately, when the seaweed is still crisp. \u00a0I ordered the five hand roll menu, which included their daily special (yellowtail!! my favorite :D), your choice between bay scallop and cucumber (bay scallop, duh!), salmon, blue crab, and lobster.

You can get these rolls a la carte or grab a 3/4/5 hand roll combo. Go for the combo friend, you won't be disappointed. And make sure you get the toro. PLEASE GET THE TORO. That fatty tuna will change your world. They also let you substitute some of the rolls offered on the combo, so don't be afraid to ask!

Service is Spectacular!"], ["Tony D.", "The Skinny: OK place for hand rolls in LA, but I feel like there are other places that would have better food. The place is more about environment than hand rolls.Environment:It's a cool little place along the busy streets of LA. The parking is pretty horrid; you would have to park in the structure around the block and walk there. However, can't complain too much because that's all of LA. The place is super clean and neat, and the place only seats people in a bar fashion. You come in either on the bar side or the to go side.Service:Service is a little slow here, but that seems to relate to understaffing. There should be more workers at the desk, and it takes a long time for seating in a larger group just because of the nature of the bar seating.Food:Hmm, I guess for the 5 roll price, it looks good on paper. However, I was expecting the hand rolls to be a little larger than what we actually got. The sushi for the handroll was okay, though some of it I felt was not as fresh as it could have been. Maybe a bad day. I would rather go to a different place so that I can order something other than the handrolls, because that's all you can get here when seated. Their iced green tea is good, though.Overall: 3/5If you are really craving handrolls and don't mind bar seating, check this place out at least once. It's not a place I'd come back to for the food, but it's a nice place to hang out and chill while having some ok handrolls."], ["Nida K.", "This is the casual side to Sugarfish which means quick service and more bang for your buck. KazuNori specializes in the handrolls and you can get a whopping 5 rolls for only $17.50. I always go for the 5 rolls because this set includes my favorite: the lobster roll, and I would be an idiot otherwise, because they charge $7 for the lobster roll on its own.If you're lucky, you won't have to wait in line. There are no tables, just counter space, and right after you order, your \"chef\" will prepare your rolls magically before your eyes. You'll be so amazed, because right as you swallow your last bite of a roll, another magically appears in front of you. They time it perfectly because they know you're hungry and also they want to get you out of there ASAP because you're taking up valuable counter space. Just kidding, they don't ever rush you which is nice, but it's hard to linger for too long when you've already eaten all your rolls within 20 minutes of sitting down and there's a line out the door of other hungry people eyeing your seats.

However when we got there, I was really not live in the food.The restaurant itself is super cute, reminds me of the cute little restaurants in Tokyo when we were there last year. It has a very authentic Japanese feel, so I definitely dig that aspect of it. We ordered a sushi roll called the Sunfire and that was actually really really good, but I ordered a beef dish for my main course and the beef was way too chewy. The blue ordered the seafood Ramen, and he really liked the amount of seafood he got however the sauce they were using was really not that delicious unfortunately. I'm giving them for stars because the customer service was actually pretty great, the lady was super sweet and very helpful. I'm sure there are super yummy dishes on the menu, and if I'm basing it off the sushi then yes you should definitely go check it out, I don't know if I necessarily order another main entr\u00e9e though.I'd say if you're in the area and there's nothing else open...(like what happened to us), then yes, definitely check it out.

First, the side walk tables are unfortunately located just down wind of the all the traffic on 8th street which meant while we ate raw fish we were accosted by the smells of gasoline and a cacophony of car noises. We would have sat inside but the place was so hot, just so so hot. The service started off not so great and only got worse. We were both very hungry and immediately requested an order of California rolls while we looked through the rest of the menu. This request was ignored and nothing was done until we put in our full order. Mind you, we were the only customers there. We also ordered one of our favorite sushi dishes, avocado and cucumber rolls. It's something we've ordered in a dozen restaurants without issue. Here, the waitress said it wouldn't be a problem, but then when she came out with our food she brought us plain avocado rolls with a side of cucumbers. Just to make it clear that there was no misunderstanding, both she and the chef came out to explain that they had simply forgotten to add the cucumber inside the roll and the side of cucumbers was their way of making up for it. Then, they offered to put extra cucumbers in the rainbow roll we had coming. Never did it occur to them to bring us the avocado cucumber roll we originally ordered or to in any way adjust the bill.As for the food itself, it was average but unworthy of the praise Yelpers have been lavishing on it.

That being said, this place personifies the feel of downtown, old,shanty, and a little beat up. The parking is ridiculous (as expected),the chairs and table outside make for an interesting sight (homeless,druggies,wanna be models,and possible craigslist murderers) but hey, welcome to Santee and 8th. But I digress,the service was ok. Limited English, but pleasant enough not to drive me away. The food,as stated earlier,was mediocre. The flavor was lacking, the crunchy was hardly crunchy,and the tiger roll,well let's say it wasn't as fierce as a tiger should be, and one big reason for dropping a star, only bottled water. I drink gallons of water (almost literally) and I hate having to pay for so much water (it's arrowhead, c'mon it tastes just like tap water).

We had to get the lady's attention more than once, and when we asked her a question about a roll, she just decided to \"give us more time,\" rather than answering the question. That was a slightly awkward moment...The food itself was decent. I had ordered the crunchy roll and my boyfriend got the tiger roll. It was prepared fairly quickly, and it was good but definitely did not stand out from other sushi restaurants. The fact that we had visited during happy hour (4pm- close) made the experience better. It's a relatively long happy hour, but the percent discount isn't as great - a sensible trade-off in my book!Other than those things, I didn't really like that they didn't serve water other than water bottles (of which they charge you for).All in all, it's a good place to go if you're in the sushi-mood and happen to be in the area."], ["Jes A.", "Well, that was unexpected!I saw the reviews were good and it was Christmas Eve, so anywhere would do!We brought a few friends here and we were pleasantly surprised!The woman who runs it is actually Korean.

Again, okay to decent quality, but you really can't beat the pricing. My least favorite was the tuna, and the snapper was pretty good! Some already have sauce on it, so don't double dip!The chef also served us salmon belly on the house, and that was super freaking delicious. It melts in your mouth and is extremely buttery.. mmm...

Wilcox Ave., a small dark side street north of Hollywood. \u00a0It was a small space w/ a subdued atmosphere which served mostly Maki/rolls & Kaisen Donburi/seafood bowls at decent prices, but had no alcohol license. \u00a0I mean, what is Sushi without Sake (sah keh)??? \u00a0Like French cuisine & wine, \u00a0the two have an affinity for each other \u00a0since they both evolved together over a long period of time, and have similar origins since Sushi & Sake both arise from the use of rice. \u00a0I had to console myself by pairing the Sushi with Ocha/Japanese tea in a paper cup. \u00a0Also, the chefs were hidden behind in the kitchen so there was no way of watching them assemble the Sushi to see how masterful they were at their craft. \u00a0So I went once & never returned. \u00a0Now almost 5 years later, Murakami has resurfaced into a full fledged Sushi restaurant w/ a limited list of good premium Sake. \u00a0There is a small outdoor dining area in front, long spacious bar seating in an L-shaped configuration w/ 3 Sushi chefs, Chef Murakami front & center, & table seating for those who just want to have the food. \u00a0I chose the Chirashi (chee rah shee) bowl which gives you the option to choose various Neta (neh tah)/ingredients to put on top of the Shari (shah ree) or Sushi rice which is infused w/ Japanese rice vinegar, bit of Mirin (mee reen)/sweet Sake & maybe Dashi/broth of Kombu/kelp, \u00a0The 8 Neta version runs $22, and chose: \u00a0Aguacate, Kani (crab), Unagi/eel, Shake (shah keh)/salmon, Ikura n(ee koo rah)/salmon roe, Hotate Gai (hoh tah teh gah ee)/scallops, Hamachi/yellowtail, whitefish - I forgot to ask. \u00a0The quality, fresh sea minerality & scent of this Chirashi made for a good deal. \u00a0If you got the same order of Neta on Nigiri (nee ghee ree) Sushi, it would almost cost twice as much. \u00a0I lucked out in sitting at the center of the Sushi bar so that Chef Murakami took my order. \u00a0He is not impatient & takes his time creating each bowl. \u00a0There is a tranquility about him that gives a reassuring feel that good things do not come out rushed which is similar to the old English aphorism, \"Good things come to those who wait.\"I paired the above with Hakutsuru Sake (sah keh) that came in a 300ml blue bottle. \u00a0The bouquet is subdued faintly smelling of rice Ko-ji & a bit of white florals. \u00a0The flavour was of a faint echo of strawberry & kiwi with a enlivening light bitterness that cleansed the palate for more.I believe Kaz was my waiter who is helpful, thoughtful, but at the same time he gives off a Shinjuku-like hipness & insouciance. \u00a0I get the feeling that on Friday & Saturday nights after work, he would go clubbing around West Hollywood til 4am just because it would be a cool thing to do. \u00a0For some strange reason, he remembered me from when I went one time to the old Murakami on Wilcox. He later told me why since he had also seen me hanging out at the Masters of Latin Art gallery at the Brewery for their semiannual Art Walk. Even in a big city like LA, there may be less than 6 degrees of separation. Murakami is a pleasant place, brightly lit w/ a happy feel. \u00a0When I got there on a late Friday night, there was a friendly buzz, but not the dreaded harpy, shrill, cacophonous bellowing like at Bestia, Animal, Son of a Gun, Bottega Louie, etc. that seems to be becoming the norm in LA. \u00a0Good Sushi, good Sake, nice atmosphere, reasonable price that doesn't break the bank.......4 Yelp stars for a nice nosh without having to wear earplugs."], ["Amanda K.", "Simple, clean and fresh!I got the make your own chirashi with 4 items ($14): scallop (with masago and mayo), spicy tuna, spicy salmon, and yellowtail.

What differentiates this place from the others is the simplicity and the cleanliness of the location as well as the food itself. You also get to choose what goes in the bowl rather than just receiving what they put into the bowl. I like the simplistic modern design of the restaurant. It is on the smaller side but there is also patio seating available which is great on a day with nice weather. There's valet parking available as well as street parking on Melrose or the surrounding neighborhood streets. We went on a Saturday night around the time they opened for dinner. The menu is easy to understand and simple. You order a chirashi bowl with how many different types of fish you wish, and the prices vary depending on how many you choose. We ordered two chirashi bowls, a cucumber sunomono salad, as well as a shrimp tempura appetizer. They had a small but good sake list so we ordered some Hakkaisan as well. We also ordered the red bean ice cream and it was sooooo good. The brand that they use is super tasty.Omg!!!!!! The chirashi bowls are so good!! The fish was super fresh and everything meshed well together. The rice was seasoned perfectly, the embellishments (ginger, daikon, cucumber, seaweed, etc) paired well with the fish, and the amount of food you get in one bowl filled me up. Out of everything we tried, I would recommend the spicy tuna, bay scallop, yellowtail, and the tuna. My boyfriend added avocado to his bowl and he said it was amazing. My final verdict is that the fish is fresh, location and design of the place is ideal for a date night, and I would come back for sure, hopefully soon!"], ["Wendy T.", "Great service, delicious food, but difficult parking (you can find residential street parking if you come for lunch).I absolutely love the chirashi bowl from this place!

I got the 5 for $16 (scallops, double salmon, tuna, and yellowtail). The fish is very fresh and great quality. The sushi rice, seaweed, pickled daikon, ginger, and cucumber complement the dish very nicely. Add a splash of the garlic soy sauce and it's perfect! I wasn't able to finish the rice because there was so much food. My boyfriend also got their toro (2 pieces) for the market price of $12 that day and he said it was absolutely delicious. I'll definitely be visiting again soon!!"], ["Sarah L.", "Love this place and the concept. Murakami is known for their chirashi (rice) bowls. You choose the quantity and the types of fish you want (uni costs extra but is worth it) and they put it over a bed of sushi rice. The quality of the fish is top notch. I usually go for: scallop, albacore, salmon, yellowtail, mackerel and uni. The rolls are awesome too!

This place is expensive because they have great sashimi, not for their California rolls and such. (Although they do serve a seared steak that looked pretty good)Definitely try the \"create your own\" chirashi bowl. Tons of different fish/toppings you can choose from (my favorites are salmon, albacore, tuna, and mackerel), starting off with 4 toppings for $14.

Since the restaurant doesn't offer valet parking, you'll just have to drive around and look for an available parking spot. Our group came in without any reservation. Staff was courteous and efficient.

Not a must order, but definitely a reasonable price.Make Your Own Chirashi Bowl (tuna, salmon, mackerel, uni with garlic-soy sauce - $13 + extra $5 for uni): Oooooooooo such a fresh sashimi + uni! Uni was totally worth additional $5 and garlic-soy sauce simply enhanced the overall flavor of the bowl. \u00a0 \u00a0Number Seven (tuna, salmon, yellowtail, albacore, crab, shrimp, eel, avocado, scallop - $19): Colorful, beautiful, and flavorful.

Eat piece was melt in your mouth good. Next we dug into our salmon, tuna, yellowtail, and albacore bowl. They give you three pieces of each fish over a large portion of sushi rice.

K.", "There are three things about Murakami sushi that are not mediocre. But let me start with what is mediocre: the location, the menu, the setting and the ambience are all pretty much average. The first thing that is not mediocre about this place is the food, it is certifiably well below average. We ordered five cut rolls, some nigiri sushi, a hand roll, and a cooked salmon dish and every single one of them was substantially inferior to what you would buy at a Ralph's or Trader Joes. The rolls are mostly rice with a smidgeon of fish that's barely fresh. No flavor, just the building blocks of sushi with no creativity or heart or soul. No pride in craft. Bland to the core. Which is almost impossible to do in LA when it comes to sushi.The second thing that is not mediocre is the service. It's certifiably lousy. I walked in with two small children and instantly the hostess was snapping at us as if we're walking in with the plague. I think I almost heard her say \"oh good\" under her breath when we declared our order was for take out. Rudeness aside, the take out order had no cutlery for the Salmon, rice and broccoli. Barely two napkins for four people.Now for the third thing that is not mediocre. It's the name of the joint. If it's homage to Haruki Murakami, then the name is about the best thing about this place. Unfortunately, I don't give out stars for great restaurant names.Avoid at all costs, unless you enjoy mediocre, but be warned that the prices reflect far tastier fare."], ["Vanessa M.", "I came here awhile ago when It was at the Hollywood location, which was way smaller. Glad they moved to a bigger location. Parking is street. Right in the heart of Melrose and all the shops. The inside is cozy and casual. A small outside seating as well. Menu is pretty simple. Chirashi bowls, sashimi and a few sushi's, salads and soups. They are mostly known for their chirashi bowl, which is a bowl of sushi rice and selections of fish on top. Kind of like Yoshinoya but a thousand times better. Okay that was a bad comparison but you get the idea of the rice bowl and fish on top :) On the left side of their menu is their chirashi bowls that are already picked. If you do not like some of the fish listed, like myself then on the right side they have a make your own chirashi bowl. There are a few price and item selections that range from $12-$18 ($5.00 extra charge for Uni). I also recommend asking for their garlic soy sauce, which just makes the dish that much better. _Make your own bowl of six items for $16. I usually always get the salmon sashimi, yellowtail sashimi, spicy tuna, avocado, scallops and spicy yellowtail. The rice portion is pretty big but one thing I wish the fish size was a bit big as well. I think they go a little stingy on the fish size. Especially when i ordered the spicy tuna and yellowtail it was the size of a small ice cream scoop. _O.M.G roll. The name says it all. It was indeed pretty O.M.G and in a good way! a little pricey but it's a shrimp tempura roll with asparagus and spicy tuna on top. It's also served a bit warm so that's a plus for me. _Sashimi Salad. Nothing spectacular. Just some greens with sashimi on top. The dressing was some sweet miso that was good but nothing that wowed me. I got this to avoid rice for the night, but I just recommend getting the bowl. I would definitely come back here again. I would be a complete regular if they gave more of a fair amount of fish but other than that the staff is always real friendly, helpful and overall great service!"], ["Rachel R.", "Murakami Sushi, you are the definition of a perfect Saturday night date in LA.

He has already revisited in the two weeks since we went."]], "Roll Roll Roll": [], "Sushi Gen": [["Jennifer H.", "One of my top 2 sushi restaurants to dine in Little Tokyo~ Sushi Gen is where I go if I feel like sashimi. Personally I think the sushi is better at Komasa and the sashimi is better at Sushi Gen. Both are still very good for me either way. Just to get a little taste of everything Sushi Gen has either sushi deluxe combos or sashimi combos or sashimi deluxe combos which I think are great. The sashimi deluxe combo is good for two people and maybe you can add on an appetizer or two on top of that. Everything is fresh and it never disappoints! I don't know if I've ever noticed before but be careful when ordering sushi a la carte off of the white sheet because prices are not listed. So don't get carried away if you don't want a fat bill at the end. The wait can be quite long but sometimes they'll call you in sooner than later but it's definitely worth the wait."], ["Rudy V.", "This place is truly legit. My wife and I have always heard the hype and finally decided to undertake the wait time for a table (about 30mins for us on this particular day). Service: really, really solid. Our server answered all of our questions and was you can tell that the staff work as a team. Food: we ordered so many things since we were excited to try as many things as possible. Started off with miso soup which usually is a throw away but it was so damn flavorful here. We also ordered this pickled seaweed dish that I can't recall the name for but it was really fresh and tasty. The sushi deluxe combo is a nice way to get a sample of all of their amazing sushi. We also ordered this steamed egg dish which was good if you like that custard-like profile. The uni-octopus dish was good but not as exciting as I was hoping for (these are usually two of my favorite items). The star, however, was the yellowtail collar. It was charred to perfection and was incredibly meaty. Overall: I'd definitely would recommend showing up early or making a reservation. However, having dined at high profile places like Nobu I can tell you that this place is definitely on par with that restaurant. Now Sushi Gen may not have all the neat food & cocktail items of Nobu but the sushi itself is amazing."], ["Huamei Y.", "I came here in May and kept forgetting to write this review.Their customer service is top notch for the price you're getting.

I think that's kind of rare for me.I came 30 mins prior to opening time on a Thursday, approx 10:30am. There was probably 10 people in front of me. The restaurant is cozy, so definitely come in smaller groups or come early--otherwise expect to wait! This was the best Japanese food experience I've had in the states.

Omakase at the bar is great but will run you a pretty tab. \u00a0The sushi deluxe is the perfect size for one person-- it comes with 2 cut rolls (tuna and cucumber) and 9 nigiri (halibut, tuna, hamachi, unagi, ikura, ika, toro, tamago, and shrimp). \u00a0The sashimi deluxe, on the other hand, is a platter large enough to be shared by 2 or 3 people; it features generous cuts of salmon, hamachi, halibut, tuna, toro, ika, octopus, spicy tuna, snapper, clam, chopped tuna, and crab, along with baked salmon and cooked fish marinated in soy sauce-- it's a lot and it's all amazing.My favorites here are the uni, toro, and Alaskan salmon. \u00a0All three are so fresh and decadent-- the toro and uni literally melt on your tongue as you chew. \u00a0At $42, the Uni Dinner is a little pricier, but it's served with additional sashimi and the quality is superb. \u00a0The uni is bright gold in color, has a firmer texture, and is sweet and buttery in flavor-- all are signs of fresh, grade A uni. \u00a0I highly recommend if you're a fan.I typically don't like tuna, but Sushi Gen's fish is so good that it temporarily changes my long-held opinion. \u00a0My first time at Gen was the first time that I remember enjoying tuna-- it melted in my mouth with each bite. I'm also not a huge fan of tamago, but I love it here! \u00a0It's fluffy, just sweet enough without being saccharine, and a quick dip in soy sauce gives it the perfect salty flavor contrast. \u00a0It's so good T__T If not personable, service is always efficient. \u00a0The parking lot is usually crammed and you should come prepared for a long wait-- tonight, I waited for almost 1.5 hours. \u00a0Granted, it was a busy Friday night and I have been almost immediately seated on random weeknights in the past. \u00a0The waits are long enough to dissuade some diners, but if you stick it out, you'll enjoy some great quality sushi for relatively reasonable prices!"], ["Kabir K.", "Oh yes.

Service was quick and our waitress was friendly. Prices weren't listed on the sushi menu so be sure to ask and the server will mark the prices for you. Alaskan Salmon sushi was killer. The color of the salmon was so deep. Not a hint of fishy smell anywhere to be found, just excellent quality sushi. Their tamago (Japanese omelette) tasted amazing! So much umami and a fantastic balance of flavors. It was perfect. Shrimp tempura were generous and beautifully battered. Japanese sweet potato tempura was fantastic as well.

Some of the fish simply melts in your mouth it's so fresh and buttery *sigh*- chiraishi deluxe - very generous chunks of fish, they even include a piece of stewed fish that was really delicious too- chawanmushi - probably the best chawanmushi I've had at a restaurant. Perfectly silky egg, with lots of shitake mushrooms and a big shrimp inside!SERVICE:Friendly and fast. No complaints, we were seated in this corner booth table that was pretty cool and comfy.VENUE/PARKING:Place is pretty spacious, the sign says they have a max capacity of 72.

Their omakase is worth the $$, and I loved what the sushi chef gave. The sushi chef was friendly, and I really enjoyed my experience with him. Going on a weekday close to their mid-day closing time (around 1:30 PM) allowed us to not only find a parking space but also no wait for the sushi bar. The negative of that is we were a bit rushed and couldn't stay too long. They validate parking. I had no complaints about service, and I'd definitely go back when it's not busy to avoid the crowds.

I came here for a weekday lunch and was more than pleasantly surprised by the simplicity of Hama. There is nothing fancy here, nor does there need to be anything of the sort. The fish was fresh and supple, very thick cuts with little tiny dumplings of rice tucked beneath. If you want an experience that resembles Japan, this is your place.

The negative - rest of the stuff just wasn't all that. From Spanish Mackeral, to kanpachi, to snapper, it was all very meh and unimpressive. Cuts are also on the stingy side. You'd probably have to eat a good 20 pieces or more to get full.

If you like traditional style nigiri and sashimi over the fusion style of Sushi Zo, eat here.(Read FOOD #'s 3 and 6 down below if you want to know why I love Hama so much.)When I hit review #100, I had to choose between my first love (steak), current love (sushi), and naughty mistress (ramen). Sushi won - I reviewed Sen Nari Sushi. For review #200, sushi wins again!I've always imagined what great sushi would taste like, and I didn't quite get that feeling 100% at Sushi Zo, Mori Sushi, etc.In the past year I have been to:Mori SushiSushi ZoTamon SushiMako SushiK ZOSugarfishKanpachiIshi Sushi, and many others.Knowing what you want makes a world of difference in the world of sushi. After Sushi Zo, something wasn't quite right, and I forced myself to try Mori Sushi. I'm so glad I've found Hama. I prefer Hama over the likes of Sushi Zo and Mori Sushi. This really is the journey of a lifetime (that will hopefully culminate one day with a sushi eating spree in Japan).Three disappointments:1. They ran out of albacore toro!2. They told me three times not to take pictures3. The sushi chef doesn't serve you the fish from lightest to heaviest. He goes down the order form from top to bottom. If they're so strict about no pictures, why aren't they as diligent about serving the fish in the proper sequence?I love nigiri, which is comprised of the fish and the rice. The sushi rice was excellent. It was served slightly warm, with a beautifully chewy consistency. The flavor was immaculate. Each order comes with two pieces of nigiri.The 19 seat sushi bar is the feature attraction. There are two small tables in an adjacent room.Oddly, they don't offer omakase. So I chose my own lineup of fish.FOOD:1 toro - not mind blowing. Good, but not that melty. I thought it would be the showcase item, but it was disappointing. I've had better toro at Mori, Zo, Tamon, and Ishi recently. So why the five star rating? The toro and uni were the only \"not mind blowing\" orders. Hama sushi is great. I want to try Komasa to make a direct comparison, but until then I am a firm believer in Hama. Sure, Zo and others have fancier, rarer kinds of fish. But Hama executes quality, freshness, and simplicity like no one else.2 uni - just ok3 tuna - There are times when simple, regular tuna is exquisite, delicate, and sensational. You don't need chutoro (medium fatty tuna belly) or otoro (highly fatty tuna belly). I was really surprised that I enjoyed the regular tuna here more than the toro.4 yellowtail - excellent, melty 5 halibut - soft and spicy. Lingering kick.6 tuna -second round. I want you to notice the color of Hama's tuna. There's much debate on this issue. It's estimated that 30% of all tuna is sprayed with carbon monoxide in order to maintain the bright red color. I don't like the way those tuna taste. The tuna here at Hama does not have this bright red characteristic popular at so many other places. I'm not sure if this is the reason it's so good, but it's surely part of it. This tuna tastes natural, the texture is heavy, there's a real chew to it, yet it's also tender. This is what tuna should taste like, instead of the bright red pieces elsewhere.7 salmon - very good8 red snapper - marvelous. Meaty, soft, delicate - best snapper I've ever had.9 Spanish mackerel 10 spicy tuna handroll - best spicy tuna handroll I've ever had. Perfectly portioned tuna, rice, and crisp, fresh seaweed combined into something pristine. Get this.11 scallop - excellent12 sea eel - quite good13 sweet shrimp - You can get fried shrimp heads or miso soup with the heads. I chose fried heads because I like to eat the whole thing. (I'll try the soup next time.) The head was packed with rich, bursting flavor. There really is nothing like it. You must try it. It's crunchy, crisp, and delicious.They validate parking in the Japanese Village Plaza garage if you spend a minimum of $20.Props to Shelley Z because Hama uses her photo of amaebi and toro as their profile photo on the Yelp page. (Does anyone know how that photo is determined? Do businesses choose it?)Disclaimer: I had to rush and quickly take each picture without being noticed. The result is sushi photos that are not up to my standard. My apologies.To Hama Sushi management: I know you have your policy. Just consider, a lot of customers use Yelp and won't try a business unless they look at pictures and reviews on Yelp. I came solely because I had friends who have reviewed your restaurant and posted good looking sushi pictures. Without those pictures and information, I never would have spent $100 at your restaurant. Just food for thought. It's your right to say \"no pictures,\" just the know the effect it will have on your business.To Hama management part 2: Your nigiri is phenomenal. Nothing can dispute that. 5 stars.Hama, I love you. Forget steak, forget ramen, you are the best."], ["Kandice C.", "Normally, I try not to dock down a rating because of bad service. I like to be fair and maintain focus on the food. Besides, I have many, many days where I'm a cranky monster and have a severe resting bitch face so I get it. Life is tough sometimes. But when your restaurant concept is as intimate as a sushi bar, where the entire place is literally CENTERED around the sushi chef, you better believe that your food and quality of your dining experience is heavily dictated by your interactions with them. And when you're dropping a pretty penny on sushi, the last thing you want is bad service. So let's just say our sushi chef was kind of a dick. When we were ordering, we hesitated a little because we didn't really know what to get. I'm not sure whether or not it was the lull in our ordering (like, one minute of confusion) but he was palpably annoyed; when he wrote down our order, he proceeded to SLAM his clipboard down on the counter. Um, excuse me? I'm sorry, but what the hell is your deal?

Look, you don't need to be my BFF4LYFE, so if you don't want to make conversation, the least you could do is be polite. Not to mention, the fish was not good.

This simply isn't that kind of place.Purist sushi or sashimi, ONLY.No reservations.Was about a 35 minute wait.Here are my thoughts:--Blue Fin Toro at $13 great value and flavor---Ankimo was a let down, old tasting and not fresh--- Spicy Tuna roll wasn't very spicy and had a weird pureed taste to it, like they blended the tuna and some spices together in a blender, but still couldn't get that great balance--Rock and Roll was good--Softshell crab was excellent---Softshell crab roll was even better, super hot and tasty--Hamachi was fresh---Sake (Salmon) was just okay---California Roll was disappointing, not very tasty and rather plain--Unagi very tasty--Albacore goodFor sushi purists, I can see this as being a 4 to 5 star place.The spicy tuna and California were a let down, and so was the ankimo big time.But everything else seemed to be great, and the service was spot on, hence the 5 stars.P.S The bill was more than $200 for two people.

Way to go, Hama sushi!"], ["Gary I.", "Small, old fashioned, unpretentious Sushi~ya in the midst of historic Little To-kyo- \u00a0looking as though it should be a down home neighborhood \"Cheers\" where they always know your name. In tiny Sushi~ya like this in Japan, the owners take special care to create a neighborly, get-to-know-their customer approach. But a relationship w/ the Sushi chefs will probably never happen since this place is like a cattle car. It's very popular so the orders keep the Sushi chefs so busy that there isn't even time for introduction. \u00a0 The customers are friendly, & there is a feeling of \"hail fellow, well met\". The more established looking Sushi chef does try to recognize their regular customers by saying a word of personalized greeting \u00a0& being a bit playful w/ the regulars. \u00a0If you want more than \u00a0a \"take a number, next\" approach & want to create a relaxed relationship with the chefs/owners, I suggest going to Mako Sushi on the third floor of Weller Court Mall just a block away where Mako~san doles out Edokko magnetism along w/ excellent Sushi & Sashimi artfully constructed. Edokko refers to an old time resident of Old To-kyo- w/ \u00a0fast to strike a conversation charm. \u00a0Farther east, two miles away on 1st Street \u00a0is Otomi~san, which does not have a Sushi bar, but does have tasty rolls & Chirashi.

The service & the Sushi here at Hama are fine if somewhat harried by having to take care of the hordes sitting hungry at the counter.

Tobiko or Masago fish roe is added crunch & savory, green Kaiware Daikon sprouts to contrast w/ the orange colored Tobiko, julienned cucumber for a moisture laden texture to add refreshment to the fried crab, a bit of what may be an aquacate based spiced aioli t adding \u00a0more complex Umami. \u00a0 This Spider roll was \u00a0non-traditional, but excellent on any level. 1-5a) \u00a0Kikusui Sake (sah keh) of the premium Junmai Ginjo class. \u00a0Neutral in bouquet, \u00a0light sweet dryness, & \u00a0finish has astringent cleaness serving as the ideal palate cleanser after each bite of Sushi. \u00a0I believe \u00a0Sake is the ideal pairing to all Sushi & Sashimi. \u00a0After all, rice based foods, fish, & Sake have all evolved & interacted together through more than thousand years of Japanese cuisine. \u00a0What could be more ideal? \u00a0Hama Sushi: good food, relatively good price w/ good bang for the bucks. \u00a0 For cognoscenti who want \u00a0good customer/chef relationship where they know you by name & \u00a0what you like as well as engage in personable conversation, then I suggest the 3 Japanese restaurants listed above. \u00a0A good solid 3+++ Yelp stars."], ["Maruko X.", "Ambiance: small and crowded traditional Japanese restaurant, only good for sushi or sashimi, no many hot stuffService: very slow and impatient, had to remind the waitress few times to get water refill, and servers speak poor English Food: in general just ok \u00a0Miso Soup (Tofu) - *** average taste \u00a0Softshell Crab - ** so so \u00a0Sashimi Combination - *** average taste, albacore tasted ok, tuna was so so  \u00a0Smelt Roe - *** tasted good  \u00a0Sea Urchin - **** very fresh, recommend  \u00a0Surf Clam - ** tasted so so \u00a0Eel - *** tasted good \u00a0Sea Eel - **** soft and flavorful, recommend  \u00a0Halibut - *** average taste \u00a0Shrimp - *** average taste  \u00a0Salmon - *** average taste  \u00a0Red Snapper - *** average tastePrice: similar stuff priced on the high ends compared with other Japanese restaurants, not worthy for its quality at all.

From their appetizers, agedashi tofu is my fav and their oysters are also fresh and tasty. Komasa's spicy tuna hand roll is one of their best from the menu, in my personal opinion. The size of the restaurant itself is extremely small and so there is almost always, usually a wait. But, honestly, the wait is always shorter than what they tell you it will be or close to it.

Can't believe the way the servers and chefs made us feel. If they felt that we didn't look like we didn't have money to eat there, we wouldn't have even bothered in the first place. Just a friendly advice, careful what you look like when coming here cause apparently when you're not some white descent you're non-existent at all. It saddens me how people easily judge just base on what they see and categorize you base off that.

The location is great if you're in the Eagle Rock or Glassel Park area, but despite what people say location isn't everything when it comes to food. The salmon nigiri was chewy and lacked the buttery texture and amazing flavor that I've come to expect from high quality salmon. The yellowtail and albacore were both sub-par as well. The highlight of the night was their firecracker roll. It was well made with great flavor, which although good, somewhat overwhelmed the fish (might have been good in this case). Aside from that sitting outside is also not what one might expect. Given that it's on Eagle Rock Blvd, you get an endless stream of cars passing by, many of which seem to rev their engines right as they pass by. In fact one guy parked right outside to the right of the restaurant and kept revving his engine thinking everyone thought he was really cool. I can't really fault the restaurant for this, but it does ruin the experience. \u00a0To top it off, it ended up costing us almost twice as much as some of the good inexpensive places I'm used to going to in Little Tokyo."], ["Alicia B.", "The new-ish owner Justin works in the floor so the service is polite and efficient.

We decided to get the warm sake and Japanese Red Ale that was recommended by the waiter. The ale was good, light with a bite to it. It complemented the salad we got. The regular sake was good, but the waiter then recommended the sake that had an added splash of plum wine in it and that was delicious.Salmon Skin Salad- There was salmon skin in every bite and was crispy complementing the greens.Spider Roll- I get soft shell crab everywhere I go and this definitely was fresh. Oxy Roll- This is my kinda of no rice roll. Filled with tons of goodies (salmon, white fish, shrimp, avocado) topped with crab and spicy mayo. Every exploded with a burst of flavor. Last but definitely not least DESSERT. The wonton green tea ice cream tacos were topped with whip cream and drizzled with chocolate syrup. The wonton were lightly fried and complemented the ice cream so well, by not taking away from the green tea flavor.

Sugarfish churns out tasteful sushi at a prefix price, and most of it melts in your mouth. It's a upscale dim vibe in here, so dress accordingly. Pretty packed inside and there's almost always a wait.

It's displayed prominently on the menu and probably the most popular. You'll already notice that sushi served here is not the most traditional. Mostly every sashimi is drenched in sauce.

And I'm not a huge fan of Tuna either soo, this was a total game changer! The Halibut and Snapper stood out the most (not saying the others weren't great; they were all sooooo amazing!) I can really tell how great the quality and and texture was with each fish. Sugarfish... I seriously don't think any sushi joint and top this. Everything is so fresh and superb. The sushi is also served with WARM rice which was sooo heavenly. The ONLY thing I did not really enjoy was the blue crab hand roll, which tasted okay to me. The 2 pieces of Daily Special was a piece of scallop on each shell. The lobster handroll was very good. All in all, the hype totally lived on for me. I'd come back here in a heartbeat.

All my friends who had the real food enjoyed it but NOT THE SUSHI PLACE FOR A VEGETERIAN."], ["Jennifer H.", "The hype unfortunately did not live up for me.I've been blessed with the opportunity to try wonderful sushi in my life and sugarfish is mediocre to me. I got their special sushi plate and it was okay at best. I thought the quality of the fish was okay not great. I could definitely tell the tuna was not fresh but had been frozen due to the color and taste. Which leaves me questioning why I even bothered to eat here if I wanted fresh fish?The fish quality wasn't even really what bothered me the most, it was understandable but some other things aren't.Why I didn't love it:1. rice to fish ratio: I thought there was too much rice to fish. Yes it's cutely shaped but I don't care about shapes, I want fish and the appropriate amount of rice to go with it.2. VINEGAR: that's all I tasted when I ate the sushi. typically sushi rice has vinegar in it to enhance the sushi taste but maybe it was that night or whatever, but holy crap.... the vinegar was strong and overbearing. It got to the point where I removed all the rice and just ate the fish.3. Selection of fish: Dismal is what it was. They only had basic fish cuts and maybe a couple of the more exotic ones. If I'm paying to go to a nice sushi restaurant then provide that quality. I didn't pay the special sushi plate price to get salmon, tuna, and yellowtail. 4. This last one is just my personal preference. I did not like how you cannot see the sushi chef make the sushi. This means I can't see how fresh the fish is and how they're making it. It makes me question the quality of the sushi. The kitchen is closed off and all I pretty much saw was a couple of guys just mass churning out sushi. It was really just disappointing. I have never had sushi like this until this restaurant and I don't think I will ever again. The service was good. They are normally very busy so expect a wait. I don't think it's worth the wait but if you're looking to eat sushi in a trendy, modern restaurant, I guess this fits the bill.

The food was spectacular, the staff was kind and helpful, and it doesn't hurt that the restaurant offers parking validation for the parking structure around the corner.If you're new and don't really know what you want, go with the Trust Me! It was the perfect portion size for me, and $30 felt like a very reasonable price for the amount (and the quality) of food I got. But if you think you're a more voracious eater, try the Trust Me Nozawa($40), or the Trust Me Lite($20) if you have a smaller appetite. This option makes it easy for sushi newbies to try a little bit of everything, and to get a feel for what they prefer.One thing that is blatantly clear is that this restaurant values quality. Every bite melts in your mouth. The seafood is fresh, the rice is perfectly cooked, and it all comes together so astoundingly well. The food was served in a timely manner, and in the end, I don't think I've ever been more satisfied by a dining experience in my life.I can't wait to go back and try some of the other menu options!"], ["Isobel L.", "Sugarfish sushi is always awesome but it WINS dineLA this year.

It is also one of my most favourite restaurants, not just in L.A., but the world. Weekday lunch is quite possibly the most busy time. Can you blame them? Nope.The food is always perfect, and the service is just as good. If you order one of the set menus (I recommend the Trust Me, $30), you get a dish one at a time, so there is no pressure to eat quickly or to wait impatiently for the next dish. They are very good with timing and are always available if you have any questions or requests. If you decide to pick up an order, you can call them in advance and wait about 20 minutes for your order to be ready. So simple!Love, love, love everything on their menu. I have eaten it all, not just here, but at their other locations too. Now that they have gotten rid of the Sugarfish app, you can record your check-ins by filling out a card that comes with the bill. They will manually record your visits and you will be notified of your free birthday meal when your birthday is nearing.I also love that they have a reasonable service charge (16%, which is absolutely great for the quality of food and service), especially since (for the most part) TIPPING IS AN INSULT in Japanese culture. Also, they will split the bill for you, if you ask. Just love everything about Sugarfish: food, service, ambiance (though it can get real loud in here), and the location.

Is it because people have not tried real sushi? Is it because the media has hyped this place so high that it's now a phantom effect?

Do i need to say more? I am a huge sushi fan and trust my judgement and specially my 're japanese gf's pallet. She agrees with me. Is it eatable? Yes. Will we go back on our own? Absolutely not. However, every time i've been there it's either been a vendor or a client. I recommend people to go and discover other places. The 40 minutes plus wait is NOT worth it. Unless of course you've been brainwashed into thinking that this sushi style is actually Japanese."]], "Shojin Downtown": [["Elvin C.", "To start off this review, I should probably mention that I'm not a vegan, and never had the slightest of interest in becoming vegan. I'm not on Ron Swanson's level, but the fact that I have 0 friends past and present who are/were vegan probably isn't by chance. I'm that dude who used to eat steak 4 or 5 times a week in college. I couldn't recall a meal that didn't include some type of meat in it, as the last time was very likely to be before my teen years. With that said, I like what they're doing here at Shojin. All things considered, Shojin puts out some pretty interesting vegan versions of Japanese dishes. Despite this, I probably couldn't see myself coming back because I feel like this place primarily satisfies vegan palates. At this price point, I could definitely have more value and possibly flavor going for the real deal non vegan alternatives.The food wasn't bad at all. The real issue is that it's too underwhelming for me when factoring in the price. I did also very much so miss the meat to my meal last night. We ordered: White Corn and Edamame Croquette, Spicy \"Tuna\" on Crispy Rice, Crunchy Tiger/Hidden Dragon, the Crispy Golden Gate, and the Ramen Revolution. The croquette wasn't that great to me. It was well made and nicely presented (same goes for everything that they served), but it was kind of dry inside and I wasn't too big of a fan of the edamame in it (yes I do like edamame on its own). I guess I just prefer the typical potato croquette. The yuzu mayo and tomato/mustard sauces were nice accompaniments though, 3/5. The Spicy \"Tuna\" on Crispy Rice wasn't very enjoyable either. The tofu substitute didn't save it and I felt that the brown rice cracker was way too hard and crisp for me. There was no soft delicious center like you find in tater tots or other versions of crispy rice cakes, just a very thoroughly fried brick of a rice cake. I thought that the The Crunchy Tiger/Hidden Dragon was the better of the two sushi rolls we got. The avocado, tempura asparagus, wasabi mayo/sweet tamari sauce really make this stand out. Definitely glad we chose to get this, 4/5. The Crispy Golden State wasn't bad or anything, but there was not much in this roll that I could really get myself to like. I wasn't too big of a fan of the balsamic sauce on it, and only the mushrooms and avocado stood as positives to me, 3/5. I should've taken the waitress's advice on getting the Super Pirates (d'oh!). Last, but not least, the Ramen Revolution was actually quite impressive for being a vegan rendition of a dish that is completely comprised of meat in just about every single facet of its composition. I recently watched the episode of Shokugeki no Soma where the dad returns and makes a really amazing looking vegetarian ramen, so that definitely got me a bit excited. The spicy miso broth was the most impressive of all. It actually had a lot of flavor and really was the primary reason this dish is enjoyable. The avocado is a nice addition (as always in just about every dish), and the flour noodles are pretty good for being vegan. The thing is, there was so many beansprouts intertwined with the noodles that it made it hard to really taste the noodles. I'm not a very big fan of beansprouts at all, but it was good enough altogether that I finished everything in the bowl anyway, 4/5. Once again, the food overall leaned more to the 2 or 3 out of 5 neighborhood, but considering it's vegan I guess it gets a slight bump up.Servers here are really nice and suit this place wonderfully. They're attentive, switch out plates and dishes when needed, and make sure to refill water/bring us whatever we need in a timely manner. Couldn't ask for better servers, especially how they seem to reflect the culture and feel of the restaurant (unlike the baristas at most Starbucks who are usually just a bunch of randoms who were looking for jobs). The interior is really cozy and romantic, definitely a positive. Overall, I'm glad I tried it and I am legitimately glad a place like this exists to the delight of vegans and vegetarians. However, considering the price (Ramen Revolution was $15) and the fact that I can eat (and enjoy) meat and animal products, it makes very little sense for me to return. I'd say it's worth a try for just about anyone with an open mind, but if you're in love with consuming animal products as much as me, this place is likely not going to convert you to becoming vegan. They do have a lot of other dishes that sound interesting so I wouldn't be totally against coming here again.Tips: - the place can be hard to find, but it's on the same floor as Honda Ya - enter through some red colored curtains - they validate for parking in the structure"], ["Debby L.", "Romantic spot for a lovely week date!

It's the only roll with eggplant and it wasn't very good in my opinion. Dynamite 2.0: I believe this is the other one we went with. They said it's the number one seller and we could see why!!!

It was a last-minute option before heading to LAX, and at first, I was completely ignorant of all the awards and acolytes this place had gained. And like Elsa going through her ice-magic puberty phase, this place really doesn't want to be noticed. A heavy curtain completely covers the entrance, and the entrance furthermore halfway blocked by a table. It's a little off-putting.But I never take points off because of ambiance. What really matters is the food, and for a restaurant that lives on its hype of organic, natural, super vegetal ingredients, I didn't expect the food to be so....well...so goddamn salty....It was a weird irony. The Stuffed Shiitake Mushrooms and Shojin Ramen were just ruined by whoever decided to get wild with the salt shaker. I can just imagine the chef's instructions were something like \"just shake it like a Polaroid\". Also not sure if Seitan strips are the best idea to put in soup-based dish. \"Soggy\" was the overwhelming taste and texture of it.However, I was pleasantly delighted with the Green Dynamite Roll 2.0. This is clearly what Shjoin excels at because they thankfully left the salt shaker far far from this roll. Instead, it left me feeling really fresh and clean as I chomped on this ridiculously green roll. Like I was going through a really delicious detox. Honestly though, while the concept of vegan sushi is definitely innovative and admirable in its goal towards freshness, it's not like the flavor combination of avocado, lemon, jalapeno, and cilantro is a completely new discovery. \u00a0So with a heavy heart, I really must say:Dear LA foodies, This place ain't that worth it.

I was surprised to see how intimate and romantic the place was. Loved the cute origami string lights! Service was really great too. It felt more like a fancy restaurant. They even had a cute basket under our chairs for us to put our purses in. The 6 of us shared a bunch of plates! As a non-vegan, the ones I liked and would recommend are:- Grapefruit Quinoa Salad: refreshing, light and yummy. - Ramen Revolution: the most normal dish of the night! Basically a spicy miso ramen but it just tasted so amazing compared to all the other very vegan dishes.- Spicy \"Tuna\" On Crispy Rice: It's actually spicy tofu (not tuna) but it was pretty good! - Dynamite Roll: my favorite roll of the night. Although it was tofu instead of tuna, it definitely tasted the most normal because of all the flavorful sauces. - Spicy Baked Scallop Roll: they torch it at your table which is pretty cool! But instead of actual scallops, they use mushrooms. The spicy mayo and dynamite sauce made this roll really delicious! The ones we didn't like so much were the Takatonic Roll and the Seitan Steak (definitely not steak. Had a carb-like glutinous consistency). Unless you're vegan, I would say definitely pass on those... they were definitely the most challenging for us to eat. \u00a0Overall, I think for a vegan restaurant, it's really good. But since I'm NOT vegan, and I know what real sushi is supposed to taste like, it was hard for me to love the food here. I probably wouldn't come back. If you are vegan though, definitely give this place a try! Located in the same indoor mall/shopping center as Honda-Ya. Parking garage on first floor, entrance on Alameda. Take your parking ticket with you and get it validated by the restaurant!"], ["Crystal N.", "The ambiance was interesting. The chairs were uncomfortable. The waiter was very nice!Among the 4 of us, we ordered three rolls, yuzu ponzu seitan (wheat meat), the apricot kale salad and a chocolate and green tea mousse cake to share. Just like my sporadic descriptions of Shojin, it was exactly what the dishes taste like. Very random, unexpected and slightly amusing.The dishes were interesting and at the same time, very straight forward and sub-par. Although everything was organic and vegan, I did not feel much healthier after the meal. We were all still hungry, even after dessert! When we stepped out of Shojin, the udon and ramen shops across looked ridiculously hypnotizing! We were on the verge of stepping into one of the restaurants ready for dinner round II."], ["Vered B.", "There were no raw vegan options. When I asked if they could just make a salad raw, they literally brought out a plate with 3 tiny pieces of lettuce, 2 grape tomatoes and a thin slice of cucumber. The service was horrendous. It took forever for each item to come out. The table next to us had come in way after we arrived (same number of people), yet their dishes arrived before ours.I'm 100% organic. I taste the difference between organic and poison. The food did NOT taste organic, even though they claim to be organic.The only plus was that the waitresses were sweet, though not helpful.I would not return."], ["chris l.", "Uniquely vegan. \u00a0It's good but for someone like me who enjoys robust taste, \u00a0it's too plain and it's just not for me. \u00a0It is pricy but the service is top notch."], ["Robyn M.", "I didn't even know vegan Japanese food existed! I'm so glad a friend recommended this place to me. I'm just sad I couldn't eat everything on the menu! We started with the pumpkin croquettes, and of course had some ramen. Oh, and the peach sake, perfect pairing with the whole meal! (Don't forget to grab some vegan cookies on your way out too!)"], ["Grace Z.", "The atmosphere definitely feels more upscale and so is the price range. I had the ramen revolution and the baked scallop roll. The ramen revolution was quite good, but for 15 dollars the proportion was on the smaller scale. The baked scallop was amazing, I used to be a sushi crazed fiend and their vegan options definitely can fool you. The only difference I would say is that the vegan sushi doesn't taste as heavy as actual sushi, but besides that I think anyone, vegan, vegetarian, meat eaters alike would enjoy this place."], ["Andrea W.", "I came here because I have a recently acquired gluten allergy and they seemed meticulous in making sure on their menu that customers know what is gluten free (non vegetarian). I stated on my reservation my health concern, and the waitress immediately let me know right away which items were not gluten free. Great service. My water glass also never emptied and they explained every dish when it was served. The food itself is interesting. The stuffed mushrooms and french onion soup were absolutely delicious. I would definitely come back for those. I tried 2 rolls as well (dynamite and spicy bake scallop) and to be honest... they tasted the same and were both pretty mushy. I normally love vegetarian food but veggie sushi IMO can never surpass real fresh raw fish. I didn't try the ramen but the broth smelled delicious.If I were a real vegetarian, I'd love this place for their interesting and unique take on Japanese cuisine. Only gripe is that is is VERY expensive (70 for 2 before tax and tip). More expensive than what it cost would be if there was meat and fish in the dishes. But that's the price you pay for having a special dietary concern.Tldr - great for vegetarians and gluten free. Great service. Unique food. Expensive."], ["S Z.", "Came in on Sunday night June 14, 2015 to pick up my spicy scallop roll.The 3 stars is for food which should be 5 stars. Service is -2 stars.The entrance is not obvious (see picture) so I go inside. Am I at a restaurant or the Magic Castle? I'm a fan of both but a curtain with a window and some drapes is very inviting.So I go in. Confused to find myself at some people's table. I spot the waitress and greet her 'hi, I'm here to pick up my order'. She looks at me like I'm crazy saying 'wait outside please'.I go outside. Waitress does not appear for at least 6minutes. When she does. She asks 'pickup?'. I say yes, ask if I can pay. She says 'just let me get the bill'.In short she goes back each time to get bill, Food etc so I wait 20minutes for something which should have been ready because j called and said I was in a rush, specifically asking nicely whether I could pick up and go.If she's the only waitress its management's responsibility to make sure there's enough service.Amazing roll though - compliments to chef."], ["Kinjal S.", "If there is a vegan sushi heaven, it's at Shojin near downtown LA!I am fortunate to have more than one vegan Japanese restaurant in San Francisco, but this little hidden gem stole my heart! The most delicious vegan sushi I have ever had, hands down!The ambiance is just tooooooo adorable and cozy, you must visit their bathroom too... it's so cutely decorated.The staff is very polite and friendly.Some of the things we ordered were:Tuna on crispy riceSpicy scallop roll -- my favoriteCrunchy Tiger Hidden Dragon rollgarlic ramen - don't remember the exact name, but it was garlicy and spicy -- yuuuumended with a chocolate orange cake for dessertThe restaurant may be tricky to find - it is located on the 3rd floor of a small mall.Between the 5 of us we tried various appetizers, ramen and sushis. Everything we ordered was fantastic. I also bought gingerbread cookies - vegan, organic, gluten-free and macrobiotic. They were sooo freakin delicious, wish I had bought more."], ["Annie L.", "Vegan sushi..worth giving it a try? \u00a0I say yes!Service: Service is amazing here. Every server in house probably paid our table a visit to check up on us which was great! However, the reason why I speak so highly of their service is because upon delivering each dish to the table, the server will reexplain dish to you ( what it contains). It kind of reminded me of a $$$$ \u00a0restaurant. 5 star service at a $$ restaurant, \u00a0I would say that is a steal!Food:Pirates of the crunchy:Out of the two rolls, we ordered I would have to say this would be my favorite. I am a sucker for fried/crunchy items so when I saw it on the menu I had to get it. The filling of the sushi roll consisted of some cucumber and avocado and the topping was tempura flakes. The only complaint I have is that the roll fell apart really easily. Other than that, the taste was spot on!Dynamite roll: I thought I would like this roll because it was suppose to mimic the regular one but I didn't. There were no problems with the roll itself, the issue had to do with the preparation of it. In the description it states that the roll is slightly torched but I didn't think too much of it, however when I actually tasted it I did not like it too much due to the smokey taste. If you are a fan of BBQ than this roll should be okay for you. Ramen revolution:The portion may be a little small for those who have a big appetite but it was perfect for me. The broth tasted clean and was not filled with the typical MSG.The noodles, tofu and kale were all cooked perfectly. The best ramen I have had in a while. Final Verdict: I love the concept and the fact that I am not leaving with a giant food coma which I am accustomed to. I will definitely come back!Tip: This restaurant is dressy not casual! Perfect ambiance for a date night with your significant other !"], ["Michael H.", "Traveling for work and was craving sushi and they definitely delivered. Recommend the yuzi and yukizo rolls. Delicious!!!!"], ["Andrew N.", "Looked for a place to eat in Little Tokyo and found this under vegetarian listing. \u00a0It turns out that this place is probably the best vegetarian/vegan Sushi I've ever had!I went with my sister whom is not a vegetarian and only agreed since I was visiting her for the weekend. \u00a0What did she think? \u00a0She loved it!We had to wait for about 30 minutes to be seated, and I will say it was worth the wait.Once we got seated, the servers tucked us into our chairs and gave us some great service! \u00a0They even refolded the napkins when you go to bathroom or away from your seat.On to the food. \u00a0We got:Tuna on crispy riceSpicy scallop rollRocky Mountain rollCrunchy Tiger Hidden Dragon rollGyoza(Naming this on top of my head, so I may have mixed it up some)Thoughts:Tuna on crispy rice - Great! \u00a0I will say I expected more based on all the photos and reviews. \u00a0It was somewhat spicy considering the jalapeno slice on top. \u00a0I will get this again, but I suggest consider getting a side of soy sauce or something to dip it in.Spicy scallop roll - The best thing we ordered! \u00a0The bring out a torch and torched the rolls to give it a nice toasty flavor. \u00a0For a vegan dish, this was a creamy awesome roll. \u00a0We did get wasabi and soy sauce on the side, so that made it even better. \u00a0Would definitely get this again!Rocky Mountain roll - Loved it considering it was topped with a fried Shitake mushroom. \u00a0Another favorite. \u00a0To be honest, all the rolls were great!Crunchy Tiger Hidden Dragon roll - Avocado galore and yum! \u00a0For sure this is another great roll. \u00a0I recommend it.Gyoza - At first glance it looks a tad small and more like a spinach tempura. \u00a0Turns out these are also great. \u00a0We only got the half order, but I can say that if you have more than two people eating, get the full order!The cost is on par with regular sushi restaurants (or high end ones) so expect to pay some money if you are hungry.My last suggestion, go in with no expectations."], ["Carolina H.", "The food is amazing!!!! My husband and I took advantage of the tasting menu, and we were not disappointed at all. Everything was terrific with the highlights being the spicy \"tuna\" on rice cracker, ramen, and the dynamite roll. The service was friendly, efficient, and warm. The restaurant was clean with good ambience. Hands down, one of the best lunches we've had!!!"], ["Cristina M.", "Simply amazing , genius menu , tasting delicious , cooked with love and very creative . Lovely staff and worth a visit for vegan or non ! Enjoy it LA people , this is amazing . Wish we had one in NYC"], ["Jason H.", "This place is Great! Its in sort of a weird place but once you get inside it feels classy. This is a vegan \"Sushi\" restaurant. The Spicy Tuna is good. Dynamite roll, Pirates of the Crunchy and dragon roll are a few of my favorites. I would recommend taking a few friends and sharing some things. Just a side note, it can get pricey. If you have never tried this place you should definitely check it out. Very unusual flavors. Its great for omnivores as well as people who dont eat fish.The staff are super friendly and very polite. Definitely feels very upscale. They do have a second location in Culver City."], ["N K.", "The torched sushi was insane. Skip the apps and dessert, they left much to be desired. Staff was great. Love the baskets under the chair for personal items, genius! Nice decor and use of space ( it's it a cheesy mall foodcourt). Very chic. Bathroom! Will def ho back!"], ["T C.", "Japanese need not come. If the night club-esque entrance or tacky appolstry does not turn you away the oppressive slow jazz soundtrack will. If you are looking for an authentic Japanese experience genki sushi does a better job. The best thing on the menu is the tea."], ["Tiffany S.", "Amazing Japanese vegan dinner last night at Shojin Downtown in Little Tokyo. Equally impressed with taste, service, and presentation. We did the tasting menu and we were not disappointed at all!"], ["Yuka K.", "I'm not vegetarian, but some of my close friends are so I decided to take them there since this place was a rare opportunity where our worlds collided. As a Japanese food snob, I had mixed feelings of curiosity and incredulity with the concept of vegan Japanese food. So much of Japanese food consists of seafood, meats, and especially dashi (what some consider to be \"umami\").We ordered the brunch special for two plus a roll. We had shiso gyoza, apricot kale salad, revolution ramen, crunchy tiger hidden dragon, and a green dynamite roll. I am not a huge fan of shiso, but it was not overwhelming in the gyoza so it was very tasty. Still not sure how they made the wonton without eggs, but it was good. I don't normally like kale (I swear I'm not extremely picky), but the kale salad was refreshing and delicious. It balanced the sweetness from the apricots with a tangy, not-too-sweet vinaigrette. The revolution ramen had good heat and had great depth in flavour, especially considering that it's vegan. The two rolls were less memorable. I remember them being good, but I missed the raw fish. But perhaps for vegetarians it's perfect. For another friend it was the first time eating sushi and she enjoyed it, so there's that.Atmosphere-wise, it's very upscale. Definitely a great date spot. The bathroom was phenomenal and they fold the napkin on your chair while you're away."]], "Noshi Sushi": []}
