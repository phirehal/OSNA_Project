They have an outside seating area that is quite nice on a good-weather kind of day.Parking - ValetService - very helpful and friendlyFood - very good and FrenchWe ordered the Escargots, which was very good and the sauce that they come in is awesome with their bread. Definitely recommend ordering these. Their soup of the day was Cauliflower, which was good, but I think next time we'll try their French Onion Soup. We also got the Mussels, which were also pretty good, and the broth (again) very good with bread. If I had to choose between the 2 though, I'd definitely go with the Escargots - they were perfect. We also ordered the Penne Pasta, which was surprisingly very good. It's hard to impress me with pasta, but they cooked their pasta perfectly al dente, and the flavors of their seemingly simple sauce were perfectly seasoned. Neither salty nor bland, I was impressed with how good the pasta was. Definitely one of the better pasta dishes I've had in awhile. Cute little French restaurant that I definitely recommend and would not mind returning to."], ["Jeff S.", "The whole experience with this restaurant was bad. There were at least 5 flies flying around us, the waiter has moved us to the other table which does not help at all. When we told them about the flies they just blame to the weather (it was a hot day), no apology, really? I just want people to know how this restaurant treat their customers. The food is good \u00a0here but I will not come back."], ["Jenny P.", "Cute little French place. Came here for lunch with a few friends. Though I was eyeing that croque madame I am a sucker for risotto and ordered the salmon risotto. The fish was cooked perfectly and the skin was oh so crispy. The risotto is different than what you find at an Italian restaurant. It was not as thick and cheesey with the sauce more runny. Delicious flavors. My 10month old was scarfing it down with me. Prices are a little steep but food was good."], ["Vanessa D.", "Good lord I love French food and Parisian ambiance. This is a wonderful, charming spot for breakfast or lunch in a quieter area of Beverley. Their food is absolutely stellar (I mean, it's French after all) and whether or not you sit outside or in, it's a great environment. \u00a0I've been here several times and it always delivers. For Breakfast try..... the waffles and berries with mascarpone cream... I mean, c'mon. Just say yes! For Lunch try.... the herbed goat cheese and avocado sandwich...you'll have died. and. gone. to. heaven.For anytime... I consider myself a croissant snob and trust me, the ones here are just as good as the ones in Paris. Flakiness perfection! Why not pick up one... or a dozen... for the ride home? :)Tips:- Beware of parking on side streets in the area... tickets abound!- The food is top quality, but not one of the cheaper options in the area. Breakfast and lunch will run you between $12 and $23, respectively. - Call ahead to check the wait, as it's popular on the weekends. They take reservations, always a good idea! - Brunch is served until 4pm, so take your time rolling out of bed and grabbing that mimosa. Hair of the dog!"], ["Haley C.", "The waitress was friendly. Me and my friends ordered two smocked salmon Benedict and a wild mushroom Benedict to share. They were perfectly cooked!

Great opportunity to try out new restaurants and everyone should take advantage of. We both had a really good time, super cute spot, and we sat on the patio and people watched. We tried the fried bun and country crouton for apps, half chicken and steak cauliflower for entree, and coconut cheesecake and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Also, since we went on Bastille Day, they served us free rose wines which was awesome. Everything was delicious and I already recommended this place to a few friends and coworkers. However, I probably wouldn't order steak cauliflower again even though the sauce was really good. I love meat and I didn't know it was a pure cauliflower dish lol my mistake."], ["Hang N.", "I was more impressed by the service and ambiance of this restaurant than the actual food. all in all, nothing i tried was terrible, but nothing was great either. Some of the items I tried: french onion soup: very salty!escargot: needed more salt!Pomme frites: liked this dish the most. love the thin cut of the fries. they were cooked well Grilled Marinated Daurade Fillet: this was nice and came with a medley of roasted veggies (tomatoes, fingerling potatoes, artichoke). i liked the flavor here but some parts of the fillet was overcooked coffee eclair: so so. nothing to write home aboutwhat i did like about the restaurant is that there is a prix fixe menu. i'm not sure if the items on the menu changes from time to time but I think for $35, it's a good deal to order off of there. keep up the great service!"], ["Muy S.", "Cute place!

My boyfriend and I were finally able to go here a couple month back, and I am so glad I found this place! It's honestly on the small side, but it is so cute and personable (kind of on the hipster side, but still love it). We came on a Saturday for brunch and let me start off by saying it was kind of hard to find parking. \u00a0I mean, when is it not, it is LA. But since this place is located close to a neighborhood they have parking signs that limit you or require a permit. My best suggestion would be to just pay the extra couple of dollars and just valet it.I was expecting it to be a packed, but it wasn't. There were larger parties there, but we were seated right away because there was only two of us. We sat outside because it was a nice day and the their outdoor patio area is just beautiful. Our waiter promptly greeted us and asked for our drink order.I don't think people know that they offer brunch because the website doesn't provide the menu for brunch, but their brunch menu has a lot of variety, I chose to get their french toast with fresh squeezed orange juice and he picked their salmon eggs benedict with apple juice. While we were waiting for our food to arrive they give you bread and butter like most places do. Our food came out shortly after, and it was actually a minimal amount of time that we waited. The food looked AND tasted excellent. The french toast was made with baguettes and came with three pieces paired with a small bowl of greek yogurt as well as some fresh fruit. It was very fluffy and the bread was not overly soaked with egg which is how I prefer it. My boyfriend's salmon eggs Benedict were cooked perfectly and tasted great (according to him. I like that they ask how you would like it the poached egg cooked AND actually cooking it how the customer asked for it (some places do hard when you ask for medium).Overall, the service, food and atmosphere were wonderful! I definitely want to come back to try their other menu items!"], ["Christy K.", "Amazingly cute brunch spot. If you plan to come on the weekends, try and get there before 11:30 to beat the crowd and long waits. The restaurant itself isn't very big,but it's cute and thoughtfully decorated. Valet parking is offered at a fee, but there's also street parking everywhere. The orange juice is freshly squeezed and amazing. Although, I wouldn't consider the large size very large.For some odd reason, I got the hamburger during brunch hours. It was very large in size and I had an extremely difficult time finishing it. It tasted good, but was nothing special. It filled my stomach and sent me home with some leftovers.My boyfriend did brunch correctly and ordered the salmon eggs benedict. The dish was amazing, and I'll probably order something similar next time. The serving of salmon was pretty good, and the sauce complimented the dish extremely well. And of course, it was beautifully presented.We will definitely be back.

The portions are generous for $30 compared to the little doors $50 course. But of course the little doors vibe and ambiance is more romantic and classy. I ordered the friend lamb bun, although very good but my bun basically had no lamb in it...don't know if that was a mistake or they were just trying to cut cost. Had the salmon and risotto for my main course, it was okay, nothing special the risotto was pretty plain. To top it off got the coconut cheesecake, it was good but way too soft for me, was more like a cheese flavored mouse, the graham crust was not hard enough either, too soft and soggy a little.

We started with the truffle fries; the truffle oil was actually noticeable and flavorful which was nice! We also had the country crouton and croque madame. I loved the country crouton since I'm huge fan of burrata. But overall, everything was just fresh and delicious. The champagne mimosas were great. The only thing that kind of rubbed me the wrong way was when we asked for mimosas, she inquired \"Champagne?\" \u00a0That's it -- very abrupt and short. If there were other options, she should have listed it (i.e. \"Yes, so we have champagne, sparkling wine, etc.\" instead of us assuming what they have in stock.We closed the meal with creme brulee which was fantastic. \u00a0If I'm in LA, I will definitely have to come back as the place did not disappoint."], ["Lolita T.", "The Vegan wrap is a filling, texture-ous (in a good way), light, and a delicious big healthy thing to share."], ["Helena H.", "Fun, romantic, adorable French cafe.

Our second choices, ham and gruyere croissant, an omelet, and (mine) poached eggs Proven\u00e7al, simply put, were out of this world. The eggs were poached to perfection, runny and soft, and the ratatouille was hearty, fresh, and flavorful without overpowering the eggs. Great portion without gorging myself. The highlight was the ham and gruyere croissant (and $5? Crazy). I don't care for ham, yet I loved this and ordered one to go. The cheese was delicious, the croissant flaky and buttery, and it was enough that my husband graciously shared some with each of us and it still filled him up. It was decadent and rich without the stomachache. I could go on, but it still won't be enough to describe how insanely good the food was. And I haven't even started on the gorgeous decor, charming French accents, or excellent coffee (They have soy milk as a dairy free alternative, although I didn't see it on the menu). \u00a0It's a little pricey for my usual brunch ($20ish pp without alcohol), but worth every single bite."]], "A Food Affair": [], "Petit Trois": [["Cesar R.", "I had this review on the back burner since I checked it out back in August for a birthday lunch...Truth be told, I recently saw my review draft and all it said was....\"honey. ham. slather butter on Ludo.\"I don't know exactly what that means but I'm pretty sure I'll be describing it in detail to a psychiatrist sometime in the distant future.JAMBON BUERREyelp.com/biz_photos/peti\u2026Boiled ham, honey, baratte butter and cornichon. \u00a0Sounds worse than it tastes...because it tastes ridiculously good.CLOSE UPyelp.com/biz_photos/peti\u2026The combo of ham and honey butter in a sandwich is deceptively genius...But I don't fantasize about drenching the head chef in butter cuz that's just weird. \u00a0I'm gonna go on the record and say someone hacked into my yelp account to make me look like a crazy person.I would only slather butter on Ludo if it was consensual...you bastards."], ["Yelena H.", "Stumbled onto this restaurant while driving around Universal City. Wanted something different and had a couple of hours to kill before doors opened for Universal Halloween Horror Night.  Located in a dingy strip center behind a gas station and wedged between a donut shop and an empty store front, it has little curb appeal but does advertise French food in the window, which caught my eye.  Inside is tiny and very crammed, all seating is counter only, no tables.  Kitchen is right there in the open, next to the bar and dish washer, which gets emptied and loaded right there in front of you, and their tiny back room only has enough space for a pantry and a single family sized restroom.  The menu is small but serves the purpose. Sadly, unless you want one of two bottled beers, on that end you are out of luck. Drinks are pretty limited to either bottled fancy lemonade at $5 or Mexican coke.  It's by no means kid friendly and I had a tough time helping them make a selection. My daughter settled on a French onion soup, which was too tricked out for her, my son settled on today's special- sausage sandwich on a baguette with fries and I had candied chicken that was served with a lightly dressed salad. It was definitely a delicious and unique flavor, but $24 for a chicken leg, even candied, does make $33 ribeye seem like a good value.  All in all delicious, but casual atmosphere and setting make you yearn for a lower price tag.  18% service charge is added automatically regardless the size of your party, and they only accept credit cards.

Working in medicine and with the public myself, customer satisfaction is of the utmost importance. I don't consider your establishment as lower end, nor do I expect service to be as such.

It's very unfortunate as the food was fantastic but experience and food go hand in hand."], ["Kevin R.", "Chef Ludo does it again with this new pocket-size restaurant opened next door to the amazing Trois Mec! While this new, more casual eatery doesn't have the exclusivity of it's relative next door, it still serves up divine French eats with a more casual, yet cramped, setting.Petit Trois does not accept reservations and is always first come, first served for lunch or dinner. There's only about ten or so seats at the counter on either side and no tables, no dividers, and no elbow room. If you're with a party of three or more, conversation can be a bit difficult so you'll resort to looking at each other in the mirror that is less than two feet from your own face instead of leaning back/forward. The servers are always up and down the aisle carrying food or wine so you should expect an elbow or two to get shoved in your side throughout the meal. It really reminds me of the tiny restaurants in New York or San Francisco while in reality it's located in a small strip mall in the center of Hollywood.The menu at Petit Trois is pretty small with only a handful of perfected dishes that don't change from lunch to dinner. Regardless, each dish is hand crafted at the counter while you watch (if you're sitting on that side) and sent out immediately. The dishes are on the smaller side and are great for sharing amongst the group.To get things going we ordered the salmon rillettes, green bean salad (with horseradish and plums), and side of fries. The fries were great with the perfect outside crunch along with the nice creamy dipping sauce. The green bean salad was nice too with fresh slices of plum to add a sweet twist. The salmon rillettes were delicious and easily one of the standouts of the meal! It was tasty I couldn't even get a photo until after it was half-devoured! The salmon was the perfect shade of pink and the baguettes were buttery and amazing all by themselves but when topped with the fresh fish each bite was better than the last!For our main dishes we decided on the croquet monsieur, steak tartare, and omelette (with boursin cheese) to share. The cheesy croquet monsieur was smothered in rich cheese and the sliced ham (which is not my favorite deli meat by any means) was great! The steak tartare was huge with the cold meat mixed in with fried onion strings and little flavor bomb capers. It even came with more buttery baguettes! Probably my favorite dish was the omelette (yes, omelette!). This amazingly creamy and rich breakfast dish was surprisingly perfect for dinner! Not surprisingly, my favorite dish next door was the scrambled eggs and caviar. Ludo sure does know how to make some great eggs!After this huge meal we still had to order dessert for research purposes. We got the chocolate cake that came smothered in caramel sauce and topped with fresh whipped cream. The cake was super rich and when mixed with the caramel it added up to one of the best desserts I've had!When we showed up to Petit Trois it was around 5:30pm on a weeknight and we snagged the last open seats available. The whole time we were eating there was a large crowd waiting outside with the hopes that something will open up. If you don't want to wait, be sure to arrive early! Part of the allure of Trois Mec next door is the exclusivity (you can only get tickets online, no walk-ins allowed), Petit thrives solely on walk-ins but still serves up perfected French food from one of LA's top celebrity chefs. Also like the big sister next door, the sign above the entrance was left from the last tenants (Tasty Thai for Petit and Raffallo's Pizza for Trois). If you're lucky enough to grab a seat for dinner at this tiny eatery, be prepared for one of the best meals available anywhere in the city!"], ["David L.", "SO I FINALLY CAME HERE!!!!!!

We ordered the salmon rillettes and green bean salad to start. The beans were raw and came in a light mayo/horseradish dressing with slices of apples and plums. I liked the lightness and freshness of this salad. The salmon rillettes were so good. Raw salmon with toasts, definitely one of the better versions of this dish I've had. Then we shared the omelet. It was good, but not the best omelet I've ever had. It was filled with creamy boursin cheese and pepper. As I mentioned, I was just in France, and I feel this was similar to all the omelets I had for breakfast daily. It came with heavily dressed greens. The napoleon was a beauty to look at but I found the custard a tad too thick and too cold. It was decent, just not my favorite. I would come back to try some of the other things on the menu. The escargot smelled marvelous and the gougere looked too good to resist. I love that they were playing old rap music. The vibe is super relaxed. Overall worth checking out.

Lucky for us, we arrived early and got their lobster toast (super delish). We both ordered the steak frites for our mains - rich, full of flavor, and reminiscent of the SF at Bouchon, and topped it off with the chocolate mousse. This dessert was OOTW. Actually, everything about our meal was a party for the tastebuds. Will absolutely return - brunch next!"], ["Sondra B.", "I recently went with a friend to check out the new little sister restaurant to Trios Mec, Petit Trios. Now if you don't already know Trios Mec is the very elusive restaurant by Chef Ludo which you have to call in advance for tickets to even have the opportunity to eat there. The establishment is secretly hidden next to a Yum Yum Donuts and still has never changed its sign which reads Raphaels Pizza. Theres also a little note on the door that says \"we don't sell pizza\". What they do sell however is delicious authentic french cuisine. If trying to snag tickets that sell out in 20 minutes its not your cup of tea, you can now head next door to Petit Trios to quench your French pallet.When you first walk in you\"ll notice the space is very small and set up pub style with bar stool at the seat and along a narrow mirrored wall. Comfort is not going to happen here. Its set up so you will eat and leave. If you have lower back issues your back will be sore like mine was throughout most of your stay. I guess thats the price you pay to watch Chef Ludo walk around with his tattooed sleeves listening to french hip hop. I decided to be daring and try something that always made me squeamish, escargot! Oddly enough I actually like snails and think they're cute. I don't want to eat them, but if I'm ever going to try them, this is it. We also ordered the Halbut Special appetizer, Fried Chicken Leg, Steak and Frites and for dessert the Floating Island. For cocktails they didnt have my signature Bellini so I let them get creative. They ended up making me a champagne and elderflower drink that wasn't as bubbly and yummy as my Bellini's. I was there for the food so i guess I'll give them a pass on that one. Below are my reviews of each dish.Halibut Appetizer: \u00a0This dish was a generous portion of smoked Halibut served with a variety of thinly sliced colored carrots. I am normally not a carrot lover, but I have to say the simplicity of this dish was perfect. The crunch and sweetness of the carrots was the perfect accompaniment to the smoked flavor and soft texture of the Halibut. This was one of the favorite dishes of the night.Escargot: ok so its basically snails drowning in a sea of butter, garlic, and fresh parsley. It would be extremely difficult for anything prepared like this to not taste good. The Escargot was actually not too bad. It was surprisingly very tender, not chewy at all, and not slimy. It was very similar to having a steamed oyster or fresh clam. But with that being said I could only eat two. I don't understand why I like snails as apposed to a chicken or a cow. Maybe it was the mystery snails I used to keep in my fish tank. In any event I just couldn't continue, but I'm glad I can say I've finally tried them. Mission accomplished!Steak and Frites: while this dish was tasty, it reminded me of the chicken fried steak I can get at Norms. It was tender, but it just had that taste of the tender flattened out steak smothered in gravy. When a friend orders this for breakfast I can usually handle having a bite or two and then I'm over it. Thats pretty much how I felt about this dish. The biggest disappointment however were the fries. They were equally as bad as the fries at In and out burger. For a $33 dollar dish that consists of steak and frites, I expect those frites to be amazing. Wowing me with homemade, delicious, perfectly crispy fries could have saved this dish for me, but I was just wowed.Fried Chicken Leg: Now what did wow me was this dish! OMG this is the best chicken leg I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying. It was fried and seasoned to perfection. We both could not stop eating every little sliver of chicken and crispy skin on that plate. I always found ordering the chicken to be the boring option, but this dish put that theory of mine to rest. It was served floating in a Brioche Butter, atop of Frisee Salad and regardless of the simplicity it all worked remarkably well.The Bread: Not to be unmentioned is the absolutely delicious french bread and butter they serve you before your meal. This and a glass of red wine could be a meal alone. I read others complimenting the bread here and they were absolutely right. It is the perfect soft moist bread on the inside with that crunchy crispy crust on the outside. I wanted to sneak some in my purse it was that good.The Floating Island: Finally time for Dessert, my favorite part of the meal. My friend is obsessed with this dessert, but I just dont get it. Give me a chocolate souffle any day. A floating island is basically a meringue floating on a very liquidy vanilla custard and usually topped with something crunchy like slivered almonds or in this case praline. I am constantly telling my friend I can make this dessert ghetto style for him by melting some vanilla ice cream, microwaving some marshmallows into a gooey ball, and throwing some almonds on top."], ["Kevin S.", "So you want to eat at Petit Trois? Get there *at least* 30 minutes before the doors open at noon, because:1) There will be a line.2) The dining room will hit max capacity in less than 10 minutes.3) The parking lot is small, very small.4) The closer you are to the front door, the better chance you have at bar seating facing the open kitchen.5) LA loves Ludo.Petit Trois is as French as it gets, and Chef Ludo has created a casual bistro that will leave even the most un-adventurous, apprehensive eaters happy and stuffed. Okay, maybe 99% French, since they do have what LA Weekly considers \"The Ultimate LA Burger\" - the Big Mec. (Which is now on my burger to-do list, and will guarantee a return trip as long as it exists on the menu). The dining room is quaint, and squeezing by patrons to get to the restroom and back isn't without some courteous moves - but Petit Trois is exactly what you would expect from a hot spot with a cult-like foodie following; energetic, in-demand and just downright tasty. It sets a standard in casual French fare for the LA area, and if you want some of the classics, you'll get them, right here.Now that we understand the price of admission...PANACH\u00c9Half Kronenberg 1664, Half Rieme Sparkling Lemonade. If you're looking for a refreshing drink without going down wine lane, this might be for you. Light and mildly sweet. ($7)BAGUETTE & BUTTERThe first thing that hits your table; a warm baguette with room-temp butter. Some might say, \"Bread and butter, that's not special.\" Yes it is. Eat it. Be happy that you did, because a \"low carb\" diet is a poor excuse for deciding to skip on it - and you should feel bad if you do.HEIRLOOM TOMATO SALADWhat summer should taste like on a plate. A classic pairing of tomato and buffalo mozzarella, kicked up with crispy bits and mint garnish. Textural perfection. ($15)MELON & HAMThick slices of sweet Cantaloupe met with generous slices of Prosciutto; an absolute yin & yang. Strange, wonderful things happen when this combination hits your mouth - some call it umami, but the Burrata and Buckwheat Honey keeps everything in check. Delicious! ($15)CONFIT-FRIED CHICKEN LEGBuried deep underneath a mountain of Fris\u00e9e Salad, is a beautifully moist chicken leg with a near-indescribable crust. It's somewhere between cornmeal and pork cracklin, although I'm certain there's a few more magic tricks in that batter they're not telling us about. My only knock on the dish, is that I wish there was more chicken to go around. ($24)BRITTANY WILD SOLE \"MEUNI\u00c9RE\" + RIZ PILAFMasterpiece. With a capital M. I need to spend a few minutes sucking up to this dish, because it was worth every penny. If this catch wasn't already considered a jewel of the English Channel, I'd say it's size and texture puts it up there as one of the best pieces of fish I've ever stuffed into my face. It was like eating a stick of butter, and pairing it with uber fluffy pilaf was a fantastic call. The Meuni\u00e8re sauce was light, yet highly acidic, producing mouthwatering qualities. I've had a preview of Sole in tasting menus before, but this was something else. It took an already solid meal and elevated it to greater heights. At the end of the day, never mind the market price - you get far more than you could possibly anticipate with this dish. Not only does the preparation stand out, but the quality and respect for the ingredient does as well. (Market Price / $79)SAUT\u00c9ED GREEN BEANSDon't forget the green beans! The snail butter pushes this simple side into indulgent territory, and don't feel guilty if you feel like pouring the rest of it over [insert dish here], or sop it up with whatever baguette you've got left. ($6)Service was great here. Thumbs up. Very attentive at first, then a bit slower as the dining room filled to capacity. Don't worry about all the bread crumbs, they'll sweep those up in between courses. We also ordered dishes that had longer cook times than compared to those around us, so there's that. Give yourself about 1 1/2 to 2 hours to eat here, and keep in mind that waiting parties usually crowd by the door, so don't be a jerk and sit around forever after you've picked up your check. Friendly staff, skilled chefs - they mean business. Oh and you might run into Ludo himself, he was moving in and out between restaurants during our service.If small, French-inspired joints aren't your thing, and you just can't bear the idea of someone pressuring you to try Escargot, you're gonna have a bad time here. However, this is without question a must-do in LA. Petit Trois for lunch, Trois Mec for dinner - you really can't do any better.I'll be back for that Big Mec. It ain't gonna eat itself."], ["Cynthia B.", "Ok, so it has taken me a while to write my review because it is hard to put into words what might be my favorite restaurant of 2015. \u00a0I have been here for lunch a few times and the service and the food is always impeccable. \u00a0From the greeting when you walk in, to the fresh French bread and butter, it's such a delight having a place like this in the middle of this polluted city. \u00a0A true gem. \u00a0The moules frites are delicate, aromatic and romantic. \u00a0The drinks are exotic thirst quenchers.

Try and sit at the bar if you can - it was so much more enjoyable interacting with our chef. \u00a0Our chef Chuck explained how to make that crispy crust on the chicken leg. He also recommended the green bean salad for us, which was a refreshing break from cheese-heavy dishes. \u00a0Goug\u00e8re, salmon rillettes, and steak with caramelized onion were all delicious. Just a note - Yes, they do re-use the shell on the escargot. \u00a0You don't have to wait till after 10 PM for croque monsieur.. This was one dish I was looking forward to, but it was my least favorite (too heavy). \u00a0Napoleon looked better than it tasted... Pastry part was perfect, but the cream was too bland for me.

It felt more like visiting a really good friend's house for dinner, rather than a restaurant. \u00a0Everybody was so accommodating, and they spaced out the dishes perfectly. \u00a018% automatic gratuity was so well worth it, we rounded up to 20%.

They sat us down at a table with leather seats that were very low and you sank even lower into the cushions.

No. The escargot was really yummy and I suggest getting it so you can dip your bread in the leftover garlic butter.The waiters all seemed rude, especially the tall thin French guy in a previously mentioned review. I anticipated this anyhow.When I got up to leave the whole arm of the chair came off in my hand. It was something out of a Charlie Chaplin film.

It was so bad, we had to request a different table. We were seated on the loungier side and it was very nice but the floors were disgusting. I wonder how often they mop and sweep here. I had an extreme urge to get up and clean. Our waiter was sub-par. He was the only waiter on the left side of the restaurant and he really didn't seem to care to be there at all. He never checked up on us after he took our order and the only thing he did quickly was bring us our check when he saw we had finished eating. The food was good until I cut into my eggs benedict and found my eggs to be incredibly overcooked.

I just went back today to the recently renovated restaurant and had melt-in-your-mouth Roasted Lamb and a scrumptious Strawberry Tart for an Easter Sunday supper.The farmers market and local purveyors-based menu rotates every 1-2 weeks or so, but there are some culinary hallmarks of Papilles which are constant as befits Chef Tim Carey's classic training and past history at Patina:-Beautiful and precise plating-Haute French cuisine technique combined with premium American ingredients and an up-to-date style-Farmer's Market fresh ingredients treated very thoughtfully; artisan vegetables are used in an accessible manner-Proteins maintain their integrity in preparation and are a star rather than accompaniment (this makes me very happy when eating low-carb/Zone-friendly/protein-centric)-In the new A La Carte format you can add/subtract courses according to your appetite (the prix-fixe menu is no longer offered because most regular diners like me kept adding several supplements, the dishes are all so tempting)Tim Carey is also the only non-sushi and non-Japanese chef I will ever fully trust to serve me sashimi-style raw fish as an appetizer. If you ever see kampachi or a similar fish offered as a raw appetizer, run don't walk. yelp.com/biz_photos/papi\u2026ORGANIC EUROPEAN WINES AND ARTISAN BEERSAs I mentioned in my original review, the wine selection is curated by Santos Uy, the owner/wine director of Papilles restaurant and Mignon, a wine and cheese bar in DTLA. \u00a0I'm petite and can't drink much more than 8 oz, but they will offer 1/2 glasses of wine instead when I ask, making it easier to pair wines separately for each course if I want.RELAXED, INITMATE AMBIENCE AND PERSONABLE SERVICEAnother thing I should add is that Santos Uy and Chef Tim Carey run a very tight ship and all of the staff are quite pleasant. \u00a0Chef Carey sets the tone in the dining room with his personable style: he is open to engaging diners and finding out about their tastes and will customize accordingly (with advance notice, he will make a vegetarian tasting menu). \u00a0He already had me figured out in terms of dining sensibilities at the end of my first visit - I feel like I have a personal chef when I have a meal here - it's a French Bistro version of Cheers for me when I walk through that door. Undoubtedly, he will extend the same courtesy to other diners who visit Papilles.CLOSE TO PANTAGES THEATRE:Located several blocks up the hill from Pantages theatre. \u00a0Papilles is in a strip mall shared with several other businesses with parking. It's a great place to have a low-key meal in 90 minutes before driving back down the hill to catch a show at Pantages. \u00a0Make reservations beforehand. \u00a0Papilles is open at 5:30pm on Saturday and Sunday so you can still catch the 8pm Pantages show if you go over 90 minutes for your meal.[NOTE: The parking lot is shared with other businesses so DON'T leave your car here during the Pantages show unless you want to chance having it towed.]As if my first review, update and fellow Yelpers' reviews aren't enough to read on Papilles, you can also check out LA Times food critic, Irene Virabla's review at articles.latimes.com/201\u2026PS: Get on their email list to find out the latest on their frequently rotating menu papillesla.com/menus"], ["Jackie T.", "Wow. Thanks to their billboard (and only their billboard!) otherwise, I would never have realized such a gem was hidden just 7 minutes from home (and that's a walk, so car issues need not apply).Dined here for the first time Tuesday night. Starved myself all day after reading the fabulous Yelp reviews and so was more than ready for dinner. Megan, the lovely (French?) waitress served me their crunchy, sliced baguette which they fly in daily from NYC (of course), and this nearly did me in. I could have eaten it all night - never tasted a baguette like this in L.A. I opted for the very reasonable prixe fix $36 and as a gesture on this my first time to the restaurant, Chef sorted my dilemma of whether to go for the foie gras or almond gazpacho, and served me a complimentary gazpacho to kick things off. My God, what a dream of flavors. This will be my appetizer when I return. Heavenly on the tastebuds with a richness of texture that makes you want to keep sipping, and sipping, and .... And the foie gras was as it should be. Creamy, slick and flavorful.I had the steak frites for an entree and while I thought it was odd the steak came sliced - it was delicious nonetheless, in both flavor and tenderness. The fries were delicious - crisp and flavorful. For desert I couldn't pass the chocolate desert - rich, moist and crunchy bottom. Paired with a glass of Rose champagne and one of their red's for the steak. My only grumble here is that I didn't groove to either of their red wines - would love to see an Oregon Pinot Noir make it on the list (or better yet, a fabulous New Zealand Pinot Noir).All in all - for a cost of $90 (including tip), it was a short trip to France that I look forward to taking again, and again, and again. Congratulations on your restaurant Tim, you deserve any and all success."], ["Clee O.", "Meal was alright... It wasn't bad but I wasn't blown away and I was looking forward to coming here since my husband is french and we were trying to find a good french restaurant to make him feel at home for his birthday. Left feeling a bit ripped off and wished we would have just made dinner at home.The best part was the dessert but not worth the price of the entire meal. Salad was boring. Also I feel like the staff could be a tad friendlier? No one was rude and I definitely don't like overly friendly but the vibe here is just lacking something. No one said goodbye or thank you or anything when we left... Felt strange being here. Wont return."], ["Chanel C.", "I honestly looked up this restaurant in shock that it has such a high rating! I ate here last night, and I was so let down by the food. Their price fix menu is definitely not one for the books. I ordered the light salad, snapper as my main and the banana pudding for dessert while my colleague ordered the foie gras to start, chicken and the banana pudding as well. We ordered a bottle of Pino which was lovely. My salad was just bits of arugula, now saying this I love small portions, but with good yumminess to it of course. This salad was just accompanied with an anchovy and some cherry tomatoes cut in half. It felt like I was eating a bowl of salt. No flavor, other than the over powering variables. The foie gras was a giant heap on a plate with some bread next to it. So I got literally about 12 pieces of arugula but the foie gras was abnormally questionably huge for the order. It was bland, no flavor other than the mango dressing they dot your plate with on the side. Ok round two, \u00a0the chicken looked like something out of a scary movie, just covered in huge chunks peppers and onions lathered in pepper. My snapper was burnt, severely dry and full of salt! Literally the thing tasted like one of those Himalayan pink salt rocks you get at the super market. I had two bites and didn't finish it because it was so hard to even chew. My colleague did the same. Ok finally dessert, banana pudding. The banana pudding was good. Lots of whip cream and store bought wafers to top it off. You know those ones you use to eat as a kid from Ralph's? Yeah those. But the dessert was yummy because it was just slices of banana, whip cream and some \"pudding\" on the bottom of the cup that just honestly tasted like vanilla ice cream mixed with some chopped bananas. But hey, I ate it, best thing I had all night. The service was ok. The bus boy that helped our table was rude and short with us. Our waiter was nice, not great at checking our table but still was there once in awhile to say hi.I honestly don't understand why this place is highly rated. The food is awful, and the restaurant looks dirty. I love finding little hole in the walls with great food, this was definitely not one of them. Don't waste your money. If you want a small place to eat that's hidden and savory, try Petit Trois and don't go here. It's just not good."], ["Joe F.", "I am kind of bias because I am friends with the chef, but honestly, it's fantastic. The menu changes regularly which some people don't like, but I thought it was cool. If you go with one other person, you can share and basically try the entire menu. That night we got the salad, foie gras, duck, and steak. Dessert was key lime pie and chocolate cake. The salad had bacon and an egg on top. It was delicious. The foie gras had an orange sauce and was great. I'm not that big on foie gras but I was digging it. The steak and duck were both cooked flawlessly and the seasoning was spot on. It was like every single speckle of your place is cooked perfectly right down to an onion bulb. The dessert was really good but the least exciting part of the meal I guess. I liked the key lime pie better than the cake, but I'm not really a big chocolate guy, so I'm not the best judge for that.Overall I was really impressed and for fine dining, it wasn't terribly expensive. \u00a0If I could afford it, I'd go here all the time. \u00a0I'm really proud of my old friend Tim Carrey."], ["Corian T.", "How does one come from somewhere south, say Del Mar.

The menu was somewhat enticing and I was pretty late on reservations (typical fuckboy behavior) so I settled for Papilles out of curiosity and desperation. I did think $75 was a bit high for what the menu showed, but hey... it was Valentine's Day. There looks to be a lot better value going for their regular prix fixe menu offerings, and I might go back eventually to give that a shot when the opportunity presents itself.INTERIORThe bistro is the size of a hole in the wall establishment, but is decorated with a modern and sophisticated vibe. It almost felt like a small and exclusive, but kinda crowded dinner party. I'm not claustrophobic at all, but the seating arrangements didn't sit well with me *badum tssst*. Everyone was packed closely and as someone who's been blessed with a wider set of shoulders, I felt way too intimate with my neighbors to my left and right. I came to have a nice conversation with my girlfriend over some cutely presented food, but ended up incidentally overhearing my neighbors' conversations and actually not having enough room to ourselves. Personal space is hard to come by here I guess. SERVICEThe host did his job well and got us seated not too long at all after we arrived. Our server however was hard to flag down as he seemingly always had his back turned from us. Every time we needed him he was either busy, or not busy but just had his back turned from across the room. I'm not the type of douche to whistle his ass over or anything so this was kind of annoying seeing his back turned again while chatting with the kitchen staff when I just wanted the check by the end of the night. Dinner service isn't over, stop mentally clocking out dude. When he was around he did seem like a competent server well capable of not being a slight pain in the ass, though. I'd chalk it up to it being an off night on a national holiday if I'm being optimistic.FOODNow I was looking forward to trying a John Dory for the first time as advertised on the menu, but it was altered to Arctic Toothfish. It was perfectly cooked, and moist throughout. It tasted just like Sea Bass to me but I didn't mind that at all because Sea Bass is one of my favorite fish. The accompaniments on that dish were a little underwhelming as they were just lightly stir-fried and lightly seasoned baby carrots with some half slices of purple potatoes and peas. If it was anything more than that, please educate me. My girlfriend's Rib Eye Cap was cute, but nothing to write home about. The soubise was maybe the only interesting thing I found on her dish. We've had some pretty mind-blowing steak in Japan for cheaper than this so we were mostly unimpressed. Our appetizers were alright. My girlfriend loves Foie Gras and was excited to try the Torchon they offered, but she was disappointed. I thought the combination of flavors presented worked well, but we would have much rather had some grilled foie. The Scallop Crudo + Panna Cotta was good though. The scallop was fresh, flavors of the dish came together well and was a very delicate start to my meal. Every time we saw the desserts being served to the other tables, we would just look at each other in awe and get excited for it. When both our Tres Leches arrived we thought it was nicely presented, but it was fitting in the sense that it was a decent end to a decent meal.Would I come back? Yes, for their regular prix fixe menu since it sounds like such a great deal. On top of that, I believe in this chef. What we had that night was somewhat flat, but showed a lot of promise and I really wanna see that through!"]], "Napoleon and Josephine": [["NLP F.", "This place could not be more perfect! \u00a0The ambiance, the food, the music, all of it is straight out of old world France. \u00a0And I thought the food prices were fantastic for the fresh, home-made everything that you get. \u00a0I kept telling my husband they should raise their prices!I read some of the reviews saying the food was too little, etc. \u00a0As I said, it's out of old world France. \u00a0It is certainly not the massive, disgusting portions that we get served at the Cheesecake Factory. \u00a0If that's what you're looking for, this is NOT the place for you. If you're looking for normal sized portions, that are fresh, home made, nicely presented and tasting amazing, then this place is fabulous. \u00a0The service is on the slower side but again, it's a French place. \u00a0You kind of have to go in knowing what you're going to get. \u00a0It took us 2.5 hours to eat here and we enjoyed every second of it. If they served us in 1 hour and packed us off, the food wouldn't be fresh made, it wouldn't be as good as it is and it certainly wouldn't feel French! \u00a0Fresh, made to order food takes time to make. \u00a0Have a drink and relax.

L.", "Before they become an OpenTable 3-week advance reservations required restaurant, N&J reigns supreme as the only Corsican restaurant in LA (in SoCalif, in all of California, pretty much the entire West Coast.) \u00a0A French province whose proximity to Italy heavily influences its naturally fusion cuisine. You'll experience something like an Italian classic prepared with French technique (or perhaps French cuisine using Italian ingredients?) \u00a0Anyway, it's an outstanding pairing of flavors, techniques and preparation that definitely hits the \"you can't stop once you start\" sort of emotional draw to the cuisine. \u00a0The antipasti course (which is ultra-Corsican selections) grows with the number of people sharing the Prix Fixe style ordering (you can still order ala carte if you really wish to, but the value alone of the assembled meal gives you plenty of choice of entrees and desserts and avails you of the bounty of completely unique Corsican delights (think of it like European banchan). \u00a01-person gets you a mixed charcuterie platter; 2 the addition of various spreads and tapenades, 3 adds the salad creations, and 4 includes the really great cheese selections. (bring 4 at least if at all possible, and everything is family style shared.) \u00a0 Your entrees are individual, but you can always go Basque and share everything to really gain the greatest variety and sense of balance to all the entrees. \u00a0We shared a medium rare duck breast with roasted peaches, a veal stew with tagliatelle that you just never want to end, and a veal moussaka that reminds you of a top-shelf shepards pie. \u00a0The entire wine list is filled with unique regional Italian and French small producer bottles, all available by the glass or bottle, all at really affordable prices. \u00a0The dessert selections sound perfectly normal (tiramisu, panna cotta, flan, and even a chocolate cake) but none of them are anywhere close to middle-road at all. Each one has really unique home prepared qualities, and unique tweaks to let you know these are really special finishing treats to a sumptuous meal. \u00a0The decor and atmosphere is quite romantically inspired and reminds you of being in the parlour of a family home. \u00a0It's cozy and a respite from the boisterous wildly populated establishments lining the Melrose neighborhood. \u00a0Valet parking in front (it's Melrose...so have at it and make your offerings to the parking gods before arriving).

The little chachkies on tables and lining the walls comprised of old coffee cans and figurines, make it seem like you are at your grandma's house - homey and warm. As you start to drift away to this far away place, you are quickly snapped back to reality by the glow of the bright yellow Sprint store sign across the street. The menu is simple, yet has something to delight everyone. Starting with the wines, the choices are limited, but pair very well with the meal. For our visit, we opted for several appetizers; Beef Carpaccio, Zucchini Beignets, and a Goat Cheese Tart. Our server was very quick to deliver our wine order and a complimentary Crudit\u00e9s platter. The Comte Abbatucci, Faustine, Sartene we ordered was perfect for our choices of food and came complete with an ice bucket. The crudites platter, although a nice idea, was a little awkward. Complete with crisps and what seem to be Mr. Peanut roasted nuts, it had a few heirloom carrots in three different dips, neither of which stood out. The first of the appetizers to arrive were the Zucchini Beignets. Light on texture, but sadly, very oily and just a tad bland. Perhaps the oil just did not get up to temp enough before frying? Hitting them with a little salt right after cooking would have gone a long way, but the overall flavor was nice and sweet with all the prominent Zucchini flavors front and center. Next on the pass was the Beef Carpaccio, which unfortunately, was also the worst dish of the night. Simply no flare or seasoning. A very mineral tasting cut of beef with no salt whatsoever. A bit of arugula and few shavings of Parmesan dressed with lemon juice did not help. Luckily there was some salt (and pepper) already on the table which did save the dish if only by a hair. The best and the most beautiful dish of the night was the tart. Artistically plated and masterfully prepared, it redeemed the overall ability of the kitchen to produce a great dish and ultimately led to a decision to return to NJ; hopefully soon. The tart ended up sitting on the plate for quite a long time as we almost could not bare to cut into it, but when the initial slice was delivered, it was clear that this creation was meant to be enjoyed not only with one's eyes, but pallet as well. The light flavor of goat cheese danced on our taste buds and married beautifully with an array of well prepared and seasoned vegetables. From artichokes and tomatoes, to asparagus and mushrooms, everything worked together wonderfully well. Our time at Napoleon and Josephine's went by quick and we ended up closing down the restaurant. So for this and everything else, I am grateful to the staff and recommend you give them a try as well."], ["E T.", "Purchased groupons for both brunch and dinner. \u00a0Hubby and I were so very pleased that we will return gladly -- no groupon needed. \u00a0We have lived in Paris and this restaurant takes us back. \u00a0Small, romantic, and more importantly -- delicious, well-prepared food. \u00a0You won't leave hungry either as the servings are ample. \u00a0Prices are reasonable, and the service is impeccable. \u00a0A++"], ["Olivia N.", "Great Dinner!!

The dessert was amazing we got the cheese cake which was so light and sweet, and the best of the best was the mascarpone with honey. It was like ice cream but there's no cream in it!

My date and i actually found the spot because we tried to walk-in to Smoke.Oil.Salt but there was a wait. To kill time we wandered down Melrose and happened on this place. Lucky us!The decor was cute and homey. Tufted red leather booths and cute shabby-chic 2-tops make up most of the small dining floor. It's a very intimate yet relaxed setting, like you're having a fancy dinner party at a friend's place, using their kitschy mis-matched plates and what not. To start off, the service was great. Our waitress was French, which makes a French restaurant seem much more authentic. She recommended wines to us (all we saw was a wine list -- not sure if they sell beer or hard liquor). \u00a0We went with a $12/glass red that was delicious and a healthy pour. After ordering, a plate of crostini and creamy-type dips were delivered. Not sure if this was supposed to show up... or if we were accidentally given somebody else's appetizer. I'm fairly convinced it's complimentary, but I don't want to make any promises since we were also given a basket of bread! That's a lot of free food!The crostini plate was delicious and the anchovy cream dip was really tasty (very fishy though if that freaks you out).For our appetizer we split the zucchini beignets. Get these please. They were perfectly fried and melted in your mouth. We couldn't get enough. That plate was gone in about 5 minutes. (We were also ravenous, but still. Hit the spot.)For my entree I ordered the cod. It was presented beautifully and cooked perfectly. It melted like butter on my fork, and was complimented by booked vegetables and beautiful red sauce. Highly recommended. My date got the lamb, which was also delicious, very rich and hearty. We skipped out on dessert because we were stuffed and wanted to continue our evening, but i'm sure that would have been delicious too.4 stars because the prices seemed just a tad high.

But once our lovely server came over greeting us in her adorably thick accent, I knew I was about to have a love affair with Corsican food for the very first time.Naturally, as the French do, we started with a bottle of red wine. Our server warned us that it needed to breathe, so we waited for it to do so while enjoying our impressively plated crudit\u00e9. We agreed that she was right as we sipped our delightful wine 10 minutes later and asked what she recommended for our pescatarian paletes. We went with her suggested zucchini beignet and the eggplant topped with honey-garlic a\u00efoli as our appetizers, shared a broccoli cannelloni as an entr\u00e9e and finished with a homemade strawberry ice cream dessert. And they were all to die for!The beignet was served with a fresh dill-goat cheese, the eggplant had the perfect flavors and textures and the cannelloni was so delicious there was no doubt it was made from scratch.

I've never been to France and to be honest, I never knew Corsica existed, but I sure as hell didn't eat like a dainty French person here: everything was WAY too delicious.

It is a decent amount of food served strangely in two parts where they will literally bring you steak and fries and then a bit later, bring you more steak and fries... Much like the questionable decision to split the recent Mockingjay picture into two, I'm not sure what the motivation here is. \u00a0I suppose I haven't picked up the source material in this case. \u00a0 Maybe so you skip the second half?

So here you are, having just finished your plate of delicious food and you are stuffed. \u00a0Then a smiling waitress comes to your table with a platter full of fries and another portion of steak for each of the diners at your table. \u00a0My boyfriend and I looked at each other in amusement/horror, because we were just saying to each other how full we were. \u00a0Terrified that they were going to take my portions back to the kitchen never to be seen again, I said I could handle a little more on my plate. \u00a0My boyfriend straight up asked if he could box this second serving and they graciously packaged his and what was left of my portion on the platter as well. \u00a0I couldn't believe it!We had a livingsocial or blackboard eats deal, and since dessert was the \"deal\" part that was included with the meal, we went ahead and stuffed ourselves even more. \u00a0The Amaretto cake was divine (although most of it came home with me, too). \u00a0The BF had profiteroles, which were the low-point of the night, in my opinion-- they weren't totally as cooked as they could have been inside and I think they were just a bit messy and an un-elegant finish to an otherwise perfect meal.Really, $25 for both the meal and a starter (the soup or salad) is unbeatable considering the romantic ambiance, the simplicity of ordering (no need to impress anyone here with fancy choices-- there's only one real option and it's just plain good) and the quality of service and food. \u00a0The BF and I are a bit strapped for cash but it doesn't mean we don't love a classy night out ourselves and this restaurant gives us the perfect price-conscious option without feeling like we cut corners or had to slum it for date night.Final point: they're open until midnight every night and have what looks to be a fantastic late-night menu ($14 for a steak sandwich or $12 for a steak salad, etc). \u00a0We live in Santa Monica, or else we'd be out there all. the. time."], ["H. M.", "I didn't really believe in sous-vide until I came here. OMG. What a difference. The meat was melt-in-your-mouth tender. It was amazing.

You pick what you want, they cut the amount you want, and they charge you accordingly. Being the fromage-crazed, I of course got a little bit of everything. Desserts were fine, not great, but the coffee deserves praise. Full-bodied, and piping hot. (I really hate fancy coffee service where the coffee is luke warm!)My only complaint was the slow service.

You receive two portions with your meal and it's just the right amount of food. The wine menu is very extensive and amazing. We ordered a pinot noir from California and it was great. We ordered all of their desserts and they were all exceptional. I plan on coming back in the near future. The decor of the restaurant is top notch as well.

Upon walking in on a late Monday night, the server immediately greeted and sat us down. He then gave us a detailed breakdown of the menu since it was our first time, and explained all the dishes to us. He was so good at speaking- we wanted to order everything on the menu! The restaurant has a spanish and african influence such as their North African savory pastries (briks), Spanish style pizzas (cocas), and the restaurant decor overall.The briks, which is what they're known for, are basically pastries with meat and a poached egg inside. These were... amazing. We ordered the Guru which had curry chicken, potatoes, peas, and tamarind sauce, and the Bougie, which had duck confit, cauliflower puree, duck egg, and balsamic truffle glaze. Each brik came with a side of salad, and this was seriously such a delicious appetizer! The puff pastry was light, fluffy, and crispy on the outside, and when you cut the pastry, the runny egg seeps out.... some serious egg porn! Our favorite was the guru due to the nice blend of flavors and the texture. The briks are a definite must order! We ordered two entrees to share- lamb shank with seasonal veggies, figs, roasted baby potatoes, lavender, and red wine reduction ($24), and the pork belly pibil with onion wrapped in banana leaf, black bean and chorizo puree, street corn ($24). The lamb literally fell off the bone- it was so tender we didn't even need a knife to cut it! The sauce was nice and rich, but not too viscous. The veggies such as at the potatoes and carrots that came with it were so good! After finishing the lamb, we could even eat the bone marrow inside the bone! So good.. I don't typically like lamb and I could not stop eating this dish! The pork belly pibil was super interesting; the pork belly as shredded and had a sweet and savory taste to it. It also had other toppings mixed in and it as very unique, but yummy! I ate mine with the beans for more flavor and texture. The street corn was yummy as well, too bad we had to share one!We also had a chili mango drink which had the mexican candy tamarind on the rim and shaken with jalape\u00f1o- tasted like delicious orange fuzz with a hint of jalape\u00f1o and a nice tamarind flavor. Definitely a drink that I would recommend as it is different from the norm. I was overall very happy with the food that I tried- definitely an awesome first impression!

Our server got us started with drinks while we were waiting for the people who were coming late. Because everyone was coming and leaving at different times, we intentionally began ordering in the order we came. Others ordered as they arrived. Our first food item did not arrive until 50 minutes later. I think it would've taken longer had we not asked our server to check on the food. If the food was amazingly good, it would've been excusable. Nobody was happy with their dishes and what had originally been happy pondering of what to order off the amazing brunch menu, ended up being the need for hot sauce and salt. At least their hot sauce was habanero-amazing!~ My personal dish, the croque monsieur, madame style with the egg, had to be eaten with my hand like a piece of crostini because the bread could not be cut with a knife.

Sweet!Next, let's talk service. Big smiles from the staff all around the floor. Grins and observations from those in the kitchen, making sure no one frowned after their initial bites. And of course, great customer service. Anything you wanted or needed - they were there for you. Awesome!Now onto the food. I've never had African food, but to have a delicious fusion of African/Spanish/French food, as the establishment claims - is a wonderful experience for your taste buds. As our party came in, I immediately analyzed the menu, scanning for items that could be labeled, 'exotic,' 'exciting,' or 'e-mazing' (needed another 'e' word but wanted to use 'amazing'.) I found it.First, \"The Bougie.\" A BRIK, essentially a North African pastry, that is made with duck confit, cauliflower puree, duck egg, and balsamic truffle glaze. Essentially, you break the surface in the middle, and everything mixes together in a fantastic dance of flavors. Delicious!Next up is an entree named \"The Shank.\" A braised lamb shank, surrounded by seasonal veggies, figs, roasted baby potatoes, lavender and a red wine reduction. Please note that as a manly man who loves to eat and get his money's worth (portion size) - this is the biggest The Briks has to offer! It's very heavy, so be fancy and pair well. How? See below!And of course, the dinner beverage pairing (fancy or bust) - \"Colores del Sol Malbec.\" A deep red Argentina wine (2012 year) with a bold and smooth finish, the chef and I readily agreed that this would be the best wine pairing to match \"The Shank.\" It ensured the flavor of the entree and the wine did not clash, but rather, kept the flavor of \u00a0the meal alive from start to finish.All in all, the experience was a little pricey but you know what they say (and it's cliche) - \"you get what you pay for.\" The Briks - thanks for the experience!

Our order: the lamb shank, the seafood flat-bread (vodka sauce), the tony montana briks, and a side of seasonal vegetables. Everything had good flavor, and with the exception of the overcooked/somewhat rubbery seafood on our flat-bread, everything was prepared nicely. Combined with decent prices on the whole and nice decor, I give this place 4 stars.But for me, the only stand-out dish was the Tony Montana Briks: thin pastry filled with pork, black beans, onion, egg, mojo sauce and then deep fried. Struck me as a kind of cuban-inspired, rectangular egg roll. Really, really good. Again, everything else was tasty, but most of this 4-star review is probably owed to that dish alone.

I mostly don't eat meat, but we were on vacation and everyone was raving about the Shank. I've never even had lamb before, so I went out on a limb and I was not disappointed. So tender and delicious, the meat was falling right off the bone. I saved a fig for my last bite as the combination of fig and meat was probably one of the best things I've had together on a fork. My friend had the Halibut, which I believe was a different fish that night. She really liked the cauliflower puree. We also got drinks. Hers was some kind of strawberry champagne that I think was called the Marilyn? I got some sort of lavender margarita. We were flying that day and I hadn't really eaten much. It was strong, so I got drunk within 2 sips. We had fun picking out the pictures of old punks on the tables. The vibe was definitely very eclectic, but cozy and warm. Our waiter was top notch.

The food though, was easily forgettable. We ordered the kale salad and two of their briks as appetizers.I liked the salad but it wasn't anything special.I enjoyed the briks! Very unique and flavorful. I love runny yolk so kudos to that. A little oily but I tolerated it. For entrees, we ordered the lamb shank, the pork pibil and a side of fries. Honestly, we liked the fries the best. Actually, no. The pork came with a spicy corn on the cob (mexican elote style) which was bomb. None of us enjoyed the pork or lamb very much.

From the selfsame breads to the zucchini-filled pasta to the cucumber vinegar found in small dots around the rims of vegetable dishes, not much has changed in Esnault went to Church and State. Unfortunately Patina's current chef, Charles Olalia, doesn't do Esnault's dishes quite as well as the original versions. And it's a shame that he hangs onto the coattails of his mentor so much because the best dishes now are the ones in which he branches out and employs his own style and unique flavors.I ordered the tasting menu (which seems to have the most variability of all the menu options but in reality is just a recycling of a la carte dishes) and added on a risotto. From top to bottom, here's what the evening looked like: Amuse bouche: Miso panna cotta, pickled shiitake, puffed rice, micro greens yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026 Wow, they chef doesn't waste any time easing his diners into savory flavors. This was bold and umami-packed! 5/5Three kinds of breads were offered, including a nine grain and an olive loaf. I wasn't overly impressed by the breads or the butter. 2/5Zuckerman's Green Asparagus, American caviar, vin jaune sabayon yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026 The plating was beautiful but unfortunately it tasted quite boring. The salty caviar was the best part of this bland dish. 2/5Morel mushroom risotto with acquerello rice, Parmesan, and vin jaune yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026 Soupy is the word of the night. Grains of rice were swimming in the wine and cheese reduction. It was more like lumpy fondue than a typical risotto. And I wish the morels had been cooked into the risotto instead of just being added to the end so that their earthen flavor could be more pervasive. 2/5Santa Barbara spot prawn, coconut milk, steamed taro, Fresno chili yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026 This was one of the few times when the chef (Charles Olalia) departed from the standard that the previous chef (Tony Esnault) had set with the menu, and it was the best bite of the meal. The prawn worked surprisingly well with the coconut and taro, which added some serious flavor without overwhelming the natural ocean sweetness. The chili was sparse but added an extra punch to the dish. 5/5Halibut \u00e0 la plancha, fennel, potato, tomato confit, clam yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026 While I enjoyed the vegetables (and clam) an the bouillabaisse reduction, the halibut itself was severely overcooked - much more than I've ever experienced at a Michelin-rated restaurant. 1.5/5Short rib, bordelaise, potato lasagna, morel yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026 The meat was fork-tender and incredibly savory even without the deep wine sauce. The \"potato lasagna\" was 20+ very thin layers of blanched potato were buttered and laid on top of each other before being braised. Very creative and a very delicious course! 5/5The cheese cart featured two bleus, two goats, several semi-softs, etc. yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026 I got a plate of 5 cheese with 2 breads, lavender honey, orange marmalade, golden raisins, and toasted hazelnuts. 3/5Key lime pie, cilantro sorbet yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026 The sorbet was very strangely strong and wasn't a typical dessert flavor. The pie was good but overall it was more of an interesting than tasty dish. 2.5/5Passionfruit pave, ginger puree yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026 Not good. The flavors didn't work at all together and I hardly touched the dish. 1/5While the food at Patina is middle-of-the-road French (I had a comparable meal at Papilles the next evening for 1/4 of the price), the service is spectacular and is what rounds this review up to 3 stars in my book.

Finally got the wine list... made a selection... then waited for someone to actually take the order. There must have been some confusion on our table because it felt like we were ignored for quite some time. I know they want to give you plenty of time to look over the menu, but it felt excessive. We ordered the Dine LA menu and shared essentially everything on it. The food was fine but really nothing was all that landmark. I honestly think my favorite item was the amuse that they brought out for us to have. Everything else felt pretty lackluster- odd flavor pairing, textures that I didn't find compatible, etc. The fish they served smelled terrible. The decor was much less exciting that I expected. The service was courteous but I felt there was something off. I have eaten at quite a number of very nice restaurants and service and ambiance here did not come close to those standards.

Rich, tender, like your grandmother would have made if she were a gourmet chef.And as good as food was, it was equaled by the service.Throughout our dinner, we were attended by polished, interesting fellows who (from the servers to the bus boys) were themselves interested in giving us a great dining experience.With 2 drinks ($28), French press El Salvador coffee ($8) and Estate Assam tea ($9),Patina can get a bit pricey for a Tuesday night.Our bill (with tip) came to $198.So was it worth it?

Upon arriving, it's located at the Disney Concert Hall. Valet parking is the main option for parking if you're to dine at this establishment. I believe they provide validation for valet parking since they asked after dinner if we parked with valet, but I'm not 100% sure.We brought a bottle of wine to celebrate the special occasion (Tues no corkage fee) and we were sat at a booth near the center of everything which was very nice.

The yuzu granite had a different texture of frozen slush but once melted it tasted fantastic. Also the tomato in the salad, the tomato's were very flavorful...not sure how it was prepared, maybe soaked, or blanched, or something (I'm not a cook and I don't know the terminology) I just knew it was good. It's been one of their signature dishes since our server/host, Jeremy, informed us when they were first in Santa Monica/Beverly Hills, they brought that dish over to this location.SecondShellfish Linguini garlic, parsley, white wineWhite Corn Agnolotti Nueske bacon, arugula, parmesanCaladonian Blue Prawns taro leaves, serrano chile, coconut milkWe opted for the Corn Agnolotti and Blue Prawns. Both dishes were great but I personally liked the blue prawns since the preparation was interested. It was lightly poached where it seemed like it was almost raw but you could tell that it was cooked.ThirdBlack Sea Bass cranberry beans, almond pistou, English celeryCalamari Farci Roma tomato, wild foraged greens, salsa verdeCalamari was fantastic (not the breaded kind), cooked very tender and the ingredients mixed well together with a slight hint of spice. Sea bass was moist and crispy on the outside and the sauce that accompanied it was flavorful and the almond pistou added a nice crunch texture.FourthVeal Tongue a la Probre mushroom gratin, okinawa spinach, garlic jusRoasted Jidori Chicken Potato and truffle mousseline, roasted asparagusBraised Pork Belly Polenta cake, zucchini tagliatelle, five spice jusWe opted for the veal tongue and pork belly. Yes I know I'm not that adventurous with the veal tongue and I've had tongue before but they were sliced thinly at a bbq house. When I asked how the veal tongue is plated, he said like a whole tongue which got me worried but hey here's to being adventurous (cheers!) Pork belly was shaped like a circular disk, but my gf was getting pretty full by that time. I have to say the veal tongue was the winner between the two dishes.Fifth\"Strawberries and Cream\" shortcake crumble, strawberry sorbet, tahitian vanillaDevil's Food Tart valrhona dark chocolate, condensed milk ice creamCan't go wrong with dessert but I'm a chocolate person and that chocolate dish you just can't go wrong if you're a chocolate lover.Toward the end of the meal the general manager came by to say congrats to a belated anniversary and gave us a few pieces of candy treats on a dish that said \"happy anniversary\". The fact that he remembered and came over to say \"happy anniversary\" and a \"belated\" one at that was great.

I guess I'm supposed to drink the air in the cup. \u00a0So I ask another server as he clears our current plates for water, and again, a few minutes go by and no water. \u00a0Finally, I ask our actual server for water and he finally brings me water, after asking 3 times. \u00a0Next up; my gf asks for a small box for the rest of her dessert and one of the servers nicely takes the plate to box it up. \u00a0Then, as the reservation was made for my birthday, they bring out a special little dessert with a few jelly/chocolate round things. \u00a0No idea what they're called but I didn't really like them. \u00a0My gf did like the chocolate one and wanted to throw it in the box but since they were keeping it up at the host stand, she asks the server to put it in the box for us. \u00a0He scoffs, attends to another table, and then comes back and says he will have it boxed up. \u00a0We were amazed... amazed at how a server at such a high class/sophisticated establishment would openly scoff at us. \u00a0We were pretty confused and upset so on the way out my gf decides to tell the nice gentleman at the front door about this and he apologizes and says he will follow up with her after some investigating. \u00a0It's now been 2 weeks and nothing. \u00a0Honestly, I wasn't expecting anything but this experience went from really really great to really bad. \u00a0It's too bad that happened because the majority of my experience here was fantastic. \u00a0oh well... plenty of other restaurants to try in LA."], ["Christina B.", "Still spectacular. \u00a0I see the Asian chef is still there:).

As broke ass college students, we wanted a place that wasn't too pricy, but still had some fancy foods. The small restaurant provided close quarters, awesome service, and delicious food -- all at a not too expensive of a price.Atmosphere: 4/5--Only street parking was available, and we got lucky enough to get a spot out front. Don't let the nearby Taco Bell discourage you, this little cottage packs a punch.-- I decided on this place partly because of mentions of its romantic decor. It is darker and candlelit, but awfully loud. Eventually you get used to it, but it can be pretty tough to hear in this smaller place. --The place is small, and a little cramped. Service: 5/5-- Man, the service was great. The host was super accommodating to where we wanted to sit, which is an overlooked privilege in my opinion. --Everyone was French, which was either selective hiring or these guys all probably came from there haha. --They checked on us sporadically, which was nice. --The food did take awhile. I've read on here that it's not rushed so you savor your food AND company. So make sure you come with someone you like!--We mentioned to the owner(?) that it was our anniversary. Dude comped TWO desserts for us. He was incredibly nice. He's the French Gerrard Butler looking dude.Food 5/5--Damn... The food was incredibly good. We were both very impressed!--We ordered the shrimp, scallop, and mushroom appetizer ($9). It was great, especially on bread. The size of the seafood was very small though. --I got the duck breast in the sweet and sour sauce ($23). Not only was it cooked perfectly, but the sauce was not overpowering at all. One of the best. --My lady got the rack of lamb with whole grain mustard sauce ($25). They overcooked it a tad (supposed to be medium), but it was so juicy. And that sauce was amazing. --Both came with scalloped potatoes (delicious), green beans (very good), and half an oven cooked tomato (refreshing). --Since he comped TWO desserts, we got the cr\u00e8me brulee and the tart tatin (upside down apple tart). Both were incredible. The former was creamy with a perfect crunchy top, while the latter was rich and sweet (and honestly tasted like dates a little). Price: 4.5/5 --Considering the price this food usually warrants, it was very affordable. -- For an appetizer and two entrees, it came out to just over $60. Not bad, and the damage would've been worse if we didn't get our desserts on the house!This little place gave us a really positive experience, and it's a place we'll definitely visit again.

The selection may seem terse but every major food group is represented and you needn't worry, they do a good job with most everything. \u00a0Not the best you've ever had kind of quality, no OMG factor, but still very solid. \u00a0 For starters, the French Onion soup and Escargot are almost a given whenever we come to a French restaurant, but we also ordered a shrimp and scallop with mushrooms in a bechamel sauce that was awesome. \u00a0The least popular among the appetizers we tried was a pate that was different in comparison to our other choices but went well with the French bread and came with cornichons, a traditional accompaniment along with some nice frisee...Known for their Halibut dish, it's covered and baked with parmesan and it's a showstopper -- in a great way. \u00a0How often do you hear of having baked cheese on fish, it seems like such a discord but it's actually genius. \u00a0The mustard sauce surrounding the Rack of Lamb as with all of the sauces that evening reminds me of why the French spend so much time perfecting sauces. \u00a0The rack of lamb which is frenched for presentation and sliced for plating revealing a nice medium-rare pink temperature within its light shallot/thyme crust...I would have chosen the lamb for myself but the bday guy beat me to it, so I selected the Filet Mignon with port jus and covered with a creamy, crumbly, pungent roquefort. \u00a0I like stinky cheeses, but rarely do I like to embellish my steak with it since I am more of a purist when it comes to such things. \u00a0The filet was caramelized on the outside, sealing in the tender juicy interior that gently yielded with each stroke of my serrated blade...Wifey went off menu and had a Chicken Breast baked within a flaky puff pastry shell, a bit reminiscent of Chicken Cordon Bleu, but only because it's encased in a shell. \u00a0The breast meat was expectantly dry but mitigated nicely by the spinach that was also enclosed. \u00a0We all had a vegetable medley for the evening consisting of baby carrots, broccolini, and scalloped potatoes...We had planned to have coffee and dessert elsewhere, but we couldn't pass up on the creme brulee or the flourless chocolate cake -- hmmm, yummy!...Comfortable enough that you could come here for a casual date or just to have dinner and catch up with some friends, \u00a0it won't wreck your wallet either. \u00a0Not perfect, but close... \u00a0A 4.5 star..."], ["Bee T.", "I went here on a date night two days ago.

It is wonderful! Before I came here, I went through a lot of the reviews to see what foods were given the most praise. I honestly don't think it would have mattered because everything we ordered and were recommended by the waiters was delicious.First off, the atmosphere is very cozy. I came here with my husband and it was right up our alley. Once it got dark out, the room was very romantic. My husband and I always try to find places where we can hang out, relax and not feel the pressure of hurrying up our meal. This is one of those places. We came early at around 6:30 pm on a Friday. Hardly any people. But by the time we left at 8:30 pm, the place was full. It gets a little loud but I don't see that at the restaurants fault. I was confused by the few one or two star reviews who mention this as an issue. I don't understand how the restaurant is responsible for that?We started off with the Escargot de Bougogne and Salad de Mozzarella et Tomates. Amazing. Escargot was delicious. It was served in a wonderful buttery, garlic sauce. Bread is served at the table so we used every drop of that butter sauce. Yum. The mozzarella and tomatoes, in our salad, were so fresh. Definitely a perfect start to our meal. For the main courses, we order the Le Fletan Au Champagne, which is the baked halibut in champagne sauce and Parmesan crust, and the Poulet Aux Morilles, which is the oven baked chicken breast in cognac and morels sauce. OMG! These were so amazing. I am just a tiny person and I ATE MY ENTIRE PLATE. I was pretty embarrassed when the waiter came back over to take my plate but I couldn't help myself. The fish came with mashed potatoes and a little mix of green beans/carrots and the chicken came with scalloped potatoes and a little mix of green beans/carrots. Also amazing. We also shared a couple... a few... a lot of their french beer, 3 Monts. DELICIOUS! As the waiter was pouring our glasses, he said \"Here is your new favorite beer.\" He was so right. I lost count at how many we ordered. Speaking of the waiters, they were all so nice and attentive. Constantly refilling our water glasses, bread and taking plates away to give us room. As I mentioned before, my husband and I like to take our time while on date night, we order a lot of food and spend a lot of money so we don't like to feel rushed or on some sort of time table. We had a couple different waiters and they were all French, very cool and very relaxed. That was nice touch.

I loved all of the food we ordered, from the escargots to the lamb, the scallops to the duck, everything was seriously delicious. I can only suggest for you to try out their lamb, it is absolutely tender, and although I was skeptical about the mustard sauce at first, I have to say it was extremely yummy.

It's new and expansive French Restaurant and soon to be marketplace hopes to establish itself as one of your favorite spots. What may appeal to you more than even the food is the building's architecture and restaurants layout. Le Petit Paris inhabits what used to be the El Dorado Hotel which originally opened back in 1913 on Spring Street. From custom made iron door to the 19th century grand staircase with original hand painted tiles that ascend to the upper mezzanine level where one will have the opportunity to admire all the detailed craftmanship.During my first visit, I had the opportunity to partake Le Petit's incredible menu and I must say that they are serving up some of the great authentic French cuisine in most romantic and elegant atmosphere. Some of their items in the menu are vegan friendly (which is good to bring one of my vegan friend), which is major plus for those where meat no treat for those who eat (No offence to the carnivores). For those of you eat meat, expect to be served a plethora of enticing treats (You've been warned)..The menu is solidly authentic in terms of its flavors and ingredients, you will find pizza, cheeseburger and even vegan ceviche on the menu. Look past those items, and you will spy seared duck Foie Gras, Croque Monseiur, garlicky escargots, fine charchuterie and cheeses as well as hearty entrees such as fillet mignon with creamy mashed potatoes, roasted lamb cooked perfectly medium rare, and braised chicken stew that mildly hardens at Coq Au Vin. The houses signature salad is its version of very traditional Salade Lyonnaise with crispy roasted potatoes, healthy helping of bacon, Smoked duck breast and a poached egg, making it one of the best not quite a salad you'll ever eat. The dessert menu is also a Euro-Cali Brasserie blend of American and French Sweets - Cheesecake, Crepe, Suzettes, Creme Brulee, Macarons and the tarts of the day to name a few. In the end, it's important to remember and not to forget that the French likes to enjoy the finer things in life and you should too. Life is too short to not treat yourself or date to someone special. So, if you are looking for beautiful escape, where you can indulge your senses and loses yourself in the most breathtaking of views, then no look futhur than Le Petit Paris. It's DTLA'S newest and most chic French Brasserie. You won't be disappointed, and if you are, take look around yourself and get lost. I am sure you'll find yourself somewhere along savior-faire avenue, or cest la vie street, because life goes on, and so should you. Now go out and seize the world, one bite and a drink at a time.SERVICE: Friendly.

We ordered the duck salad, sea bass and lamb shank. The duck salad was HUGE and not that special. The lamb shank was under seasoned, but it was cooked well and tender. The best dish was probably the sea bass but the portion was surprisingly flimsy... However, I did enjoy the grilled tomato side it came with.

I think the only thing that could make it better would be more vegetarian options (*hint hint*). Let me start by saying how beautiful the restaurant is. They have incorporated vintage elements of downtown with French/burlesque-y decor. The decor is very loud but also very romantic. I think of a cross between Perch and Bottega Louie. The food was good. Not the best, but definitely not bad. I would go there again and again. I had the one obligatory vegetarian option, the vegetable papardelles. The noodles were light and they had nice large chunks of artichoke that were seasoned perfectly. But whenever I see pasta (or pizza) as my only option I immediately think the chefs were like \"hey we need something for the veg heads... I got this pasta... ok there we go!\" So it was good, but I can tell there was little thought put into it. On the other hand, my boyfriend got the lamb shank and he was in heaven. Apparently they slow roast it for 48 hrs... that means nothing to me but it makes it even better. We got the heirloom tomatoes with burrat for an app, they were delicious and the pesto totally made the dish. We also got the souffl\u00e9 (order ahead of time as it takes 25 mins to make) and the crepes suzzette for dessert. The souffl\u00e9 was good but I loved the crepes. I'm not much of a sweet person, so I really appreciated that it was very tart with a full orange flavor. Ok, the best part for last. Our server, Lucas. I would return here just for him. He was so personable, attentive, and helpful. He truly made the whole experience here wondefful. He made a few recommendations on the wine, entrees, and desserts and we loved everything he recommended. He seemed like a genuine guy and when things were starting to get busy, he would still stay and chat for a minute at our table. Honestly, he was probably the best server I've ever had and I hope he reads this glowing review of him. I'll definitely be asking for his section every time I return. Overall the experience was great. It's a new restaurant and you can tell they're still figuring things out, but I'm excited that it's in my neighborhood because I will be returning."], ["R.

I would have much rather heard the specials from our waiter himself and had more room on our table. Other then that, the ambiance is beautiful and the food was delicious! We had foie gras appetizer which was amazing, delicious truffle burger cooked to perfection and excellent lobster linguine made special to cater to my onion allergy which made me very happy. The cocktails and French wine were also fabulous. Bonus, the real French chef came out to greet us. He was very gracious in answering our questions and in sharing his fresh ingredients list with us. We will definitely be back very soon!! Merci, fin."], ["Marie P.", "Been following and reading about this place anticipating for it to open. Came here this morning, still at a soft open, and I was so excited! Drove in to Dtla hitting the morning traffic which took about 50 min. Luckily when I got there there was one parking space right in front of this place. Right of the bat, I love the exterior of the place. Black and chic! You walk in and at first it's very intimidating but then you are greeted by the friendly host. I have to say that the interior is gorgeous!! Its obviously very European but omg is the space huge and elegant! It had beautiful furniture. It had this beautiful staircase leading to the lounge part of the restaurant. The chandeliers were gorgeous! I love the decor! The restrooms had a very chic and black interior. The only thing I didn't like about the restroom near the from door is that the men and women's bathroom share the same sink faucet! I ordered the omelet with bacon and potatoes called compagnarde. It was delicious. It comes with fresh Arugala salad. I also ordered the fresh squeezed oj, but I really don't think it was fresh squeezed. The waiters were all French speaking! It was so nice to hear their accent! What can I say, I'm a sucker for French speaking people! Such a beautiful language! I really can't wait to comeback and try the lunch and dinner menu and just enjoy the ambiance!!! Thank you Le Petit Paris for opening here in Dtla!"], ["Heather J.", "My fiance and I recently went to Paris and came back sad and depressed because we weren't finding our favorite Parisian food. We were so happy to have found Le Petit Paris because it is exactly what we were missing!We first had the mushroom soup, and it was super creamy and rich. They put mashed potato at the bottom which made it really interesting. Never had it like that before and it was well worth it.They brought by a sample entree for us to try (on the house) - salmon pate with baked bread. It was also very good. I wouldn't have thought to order it because it's not something I crave, per se, but I am glad to have tried it.Finally, our meal came out - we both ordered croque monsieurs.Let me tell you something about croque monsieurs...think back to the best grilled cheese sandwich you have ever had. Remember how amazing it was? Well it was crap compared to the cheesy goodness that is the croque monsieur. First, the bread is topped with ham and assorted cheeses. Then, they put unicorn tears and the laughter of children on it. Finally, they bake it to perfection - the cheese lightly toasted a golden brown on top yet oozing out from the sides.In Paris, this was my favorite food. I craved it the most coming back home. Everything else I had tried was was a cheap imitation......until Le Petit Paris. The cheese was gooey. The toast was crunchy. Everything melted together into heavenly bite-sized pieces. It was pure bliss.The macarons and espresso were the perfect way to top off the meal. Fantastic!Just keep in mind about the service here - it's a French restaurant. The service will be slower than American restaurants. That does not make it worse - just slower. The point is to enjoy the meal, not eat and leave.The decor is like this beautiful marriage of LA Noire and French Eatery feel. Really enjoyed the ambiance and the overall decor of the place.Love it here!

The appetizer (tuna tartar) is an elegant blend of savory and citrus flavors with a little spice of wasabi cream sauce, I dare you not to try it. You will most certainly be missing out. I order the filet which was so tender I didn't realize I was using my butter knife instead of the steak knife they provided. Giving new meaning to smooth like butter!

My drink was the 2010 Ch\u00e2teau Lacombe Noaillac, Bordeaux - \u00a0smooth was the overall verdict, which it was. \u00a0It comes a close second to the Bordeaux I had on top of the Eiffel Tower. \u00a0Jesse ordered a vodka/soda water; and a bottle of Badoit water for Andy. We started with the following appetizers: \u00a0Heirloom Tomatoes - creamy buratta cheese, pistou and fresh basil; Gravlax Salmon - with chive cream and house made blinis; and the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance - House Made Duck Foie Gras - \u00a0with exotic fruit chutney, toasted fig bread (Da Bomb!) \u00a0The first two appetizers are quite fresh and good. \u00a0However, I have to say that the highlight truly was the house made foie gras which was \"quite a heavenly experience\" --as agreed by both me and Andy, who is a gourmandise. Our entr\u00e9 consisted of: \u00a0Meuni\u00e8re Sole - with mixed seasonal vegetables for Jesse, and the 34oz Dry-aged C\u00f4te de Beouf - served with Himalayan Ice Salt, 3 sauces (Gorgonzola, Bernaise, pepper), gratin dauphinois, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms for myself and Andy. \u00a0If you are a meat lover you have got to try this, to share of course. \u00a0The presentation of both dishes was done table-side and quite a procession and a show in itself.We finished our meal with the Chocolate Mousse with Berries. \u00a0If you are a chocoholic, this is good for sharing; and the Vanilla Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e was mouth watering good. Kudos to Pastry Chef Dani who made me quite proud.Overall, my first experience, and shared by my group was a resounding - \"a must repeat experience\". \u00a0Compliments to the establishment for bringing a refreshingly new French restaurant that adds to the diverse palate of Los Angeles, and to Chefs Cazes and Baptiste for the good food. \u00a0Oh, and our server, Lucas, who had us as his first table serve, did superb!*** Today, Sunday, 18-October, 2015, Early Dinner ***So, now for the second experience. \u00a0I started with the Bordeaux, Ch\u00e2teau Lacombe Noaillac which is now my favorite red in L.A. I ended ordering two glasses of that should tell you something. I started with appetizer, Burgundy Escargots - dressed in garlic and parsley. \u00a0The flavors were just perfect as either flavors of the garlic nor parsley overpowered the other. \u00a0I followed it with the Bouquet of Shrimp - mixed greens with house made mayonnaise. Very fresh. \u00a0Entr\u00e9 was Lobster Papardelles - with artichokes and sun-dried tomatoes, in lobster cream. \u00a0I was not overly crazy with this one probably because by the time I ate it the pasta was overly cooked and the cream was all melted -- it came out the same time as the shrimp/salad and the host having noticed it going untouched offered to place it in the warmer. It was all just timing. Dessert was Le Verrine - two alternating layers of lime pannacotta and mango-passion fruit gel\u00e8e, topped with white chocolate balls and petit cubed pineapples and decorated on top with edible gold foil and pineapple leaves. \u00a0This was quite very refreshing with good complimentary flavors specially after the shrimp and lobster in cream.Overall not a bad experience once again, just a matter of timing recommendation as to when the entr\u00e9 should have been placed and brought out. \u00a0This place is a must try and highly recommended!!!"], ["John H.", "Loving this restaurant!!!

I'm not sure how their lunch and dinner are, but brunch was pretty disappointing. I was kind of surprised that the restaurant was entirely empty when I walked in at 11am. A couple others strolled in throughout our meal, but for the most part it was pretty empty. We ordered the Brioche French Toast and Crisp Pulled Pork Sandwich. The french toast was not good. It was extremely greasy and just tasted like bread covered in oil. I did not enjoy the sandwich either. It was pretty greasy as well, and I didn't like the \"crisp\" pork in it. Look for street parking or lots nearby! I was able to find a $5 lot about a block away."], ["Denny C.", "Industriel reminds me of a new American restaurant from DC. \u00a0When I was in DC a few years ago, new American restaurants were everywhere. \u00a0LA's food scene (thankfully) is much more varied, but I liked my recent trip to Industriel. \u00a0I came this past weekend with a party of two for a relatively early dinner. \u00a0Although I'd made a reservation online, it didn't show up in the system, but we were seated no problem upstairs. \u00a0The venue is kind of eclectic but fun. \u00a0I like the bar space with high ceilings on the first floor. \u00a0The table we were seated at overlooked the bar, and the chairs were huge - at least they encourage good posture.Everyone gets a free starter of focaccia bread. \u00a0It came with honey and cream to dip, but I thought the bread was great by itself. We split an order of the kale salad, and I opted for the lamb while my companion ordered the red snapper. \u00a0Kale salad: \u00a0Yum! \u00a0My dining companion said he could eat this all day and everyday. \u00a0Very refreshing, and the bacon definitely added some texture and saltiness. \u00a0Could've used more white anchovies though.Lamb: \u00a0I really liked this dish. \u00a0It was hearty and had lots of rich flavors. \u00a0The African spices were cooked into rice, and you could almost smell it. \u00a0The purple grain rice was mixed with black eyed peas, pistachio, and eggplant relish, so there was flavor, texture, and even lamb juice. \u00a0I think I almost liked the rice more than the lamb itself, which was a good mix of fatty and lean, but the lean cuts tended to be a bit dry.We also split the grapefruit creme brulee as dessert. \u00a0There are chunks of grapefruit on top of the creme, which made for an interesting contrast of sweet and tart. \u00a0I liked the fact that there were bits of pistachio here, too, but I did not like the licorice-tasting herbs that were sprinkled on top - the combination of the creme brulee, the grapefruit pieces, pistachio, and licorice herbs was a bit too much.Service: \u00a0Very good. \u00a0Great about refilling our water, and the food came out pretty quickly too. Note too that there's a weekday evening all night HH at the first floor bar!Bottom line: \u00a0Great new American restaurant in DineLA. \u00a0I'd be excited to go back and try some other dishes."], ["Drew B.", "Embarrassingly Good Service.Came for DineLA lunch. 1 Butter lettuce, 1 Kale Salad. Hardcore anchovy dressing and much pancetta turns the healthy into the tasty.1 Chicken sandwich, 1 Burger. I mentioned that the bun was ever so Slightly burnt, didn't need anything replaced, but the server understood things can get bitter so he said he would mention to the kitchen. I hate to complain, especially over a somewhat small, wasn't completely torched rather a few dark edges kind of burnt, but it did leave a bad burnt 1st impression on an otherwise solid burger.They offered to replace it, no.Free dessert; not today (full from Kale salad with healthy portion of bacon bits!)It's okay really.Then they Comped the whole lunch for one person. Oh no not necessary. Please!Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Your customers are king, and I feel like Royalty.So rare these days, out of the park."], ["Catherine K.", "This review is for DineLA! \u00a0My bf had surprisingly researched the restaurants participating in DineLA, and this was the chosen one. \u00a0The ambiance upstairs is definitely romantic and perfect for a date night. \u00a0The downstairs area seemed more group appropriate. \u00a0First, the bread with herb butter and oil was just so-so, but this is just house bread.We ordered one plate not on the DineLA menu, which was the FARM VEGETABLES with olive oil and sea salt. \u00a0I think they were mainly green beans charred black with seasoning, but something about it was fantastic. \u00a0I highly recommend this dish.For starters:KALE salad -bacon, panko, parmesan, white anchovies, roasted garlic bacon dressingSPINACH salad - radish, grated pecorino, shaved onion, walnuts, lemon dressing These were probably (and most surprisingly) the favorites of the night. \u00a0Really refreshing, yet extremely flavorful. \u00a0They're presented in tasteful wooden round bowls. \u00a0Makes it seem like they were foraged but still has an urban feel to it haha. Meal:Roast Lamb Stew (Poached egg, potato, sweet onion, annatto, yogurt, coriander, grilled baguette)Risotto (roast garlic, parmesan, amond, crisp shallots)The lamb stew was pretty good. \u00a0The risotto was rather heavy, so I wouldn't order this one again.Dessert:Biscuit (strawberry, whipped creme fraiche, vanilla ice cream)Peanut Butter Chocolate CakeBoth desserts were just ok. \u00a0The biscuit one was better. \u00a0The cake was on the dry side, so I wouldn't order this one.I will definitely be back to this place. \u00a0It's a trendy, delicious place. \u00a0Only complaint it the bathroom is only downstairs and there's only one stall per gender."]]}
