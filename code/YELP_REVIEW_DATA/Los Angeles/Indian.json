{"Gill's Indian Restaurant": [["Brittany B.", "Gill's is one of my favorite restaurants downtown. They have THE BEST naan (I love garlic, boyfriend loves Peshaari with raisins and nuts) and Saag Paneer I've ever had. We always order the Chicken Tikka Masala as well, because, c'mon, it's seriously one of the universe's sacred gifts to mankind. It's pretty tasty here (I like it medium, if my boyfriend could handle his spicy better, I'd get it hot). I have never ordered something from Gill's I didn't like, with the exception of the Onion Bhaji, which is just a little too greasy for me.Just a heads up, the restaurant itself is more of a dive than a fine dining experience, but I love coming for dinner because the service is always attentive and it's a very quiet lowkey environment. \u00a0The lunch buffet, with a pretty extensive selection and less than $10, is a draw for me as well. I even had my 30th birthday (\"Curry 30\") dinner here.Long live Chicken Tikka Masala! Long live Gill's!"], ["Andre S.", "Another of my favorite foods in the world is Indian cuisine....guess I'll keep looking.Was sitting at work with a overwhelming pang for Tandoori...looked through Yelp and found Gill's. I have to say I'm somewhat of a foodie, as for me the more exotic the cuisine the better. Boy was I disappointed, my first clue should have been when I called after placing my order to inquire about the pick up time. I called about 5 minutes after placing said order, the person stated that it was ready!?? I got back to work and first tried the veggie pajoras...tasted old and over cooked..or maybe they keep them prepped...either way, off to the bin they went. Onto the Tandoori Chicken....burnt / dry / bland...:( The most flavorful items I received were the fresh sliced onions. Where is my great Indian cuisine in L.A.??"], ["Ashley H.", "My agency ordered Gill's Indian food for my group and overall I would have to say it was okay. I live in Tustin where there's a lot of Indian restaurants and we're not too far from Little India in Artesia so if I want amazing Indian food I can get it in a snap.However, I noticed in DTLA there's not many places where one can get Indian food so Gill's it was! Here are some things I noticed about Gill's:1. The restaurant is inside the Stillwell Hotel. I wasn't aware of this so when I called the man he told me to just park outside the hotel and that the food will be brought out to my car. 2. The prices are great. We fed about 25 people for about $230.3. The saag paneer is AMAZING! So freaking good!The other items we had like the dal of the day and the tandoori chicken was okay. I've had it better at other restaurants. Would I come back? Probably not, but if you're around DTLA and you're craving Indian food I would recommend you to try this place out."], ["Katy M.", "Gill's is our standard takeout joint in dtla. Good food, nothing too fancy. The coconut chicken and saag paneer are the best!"], ["Marye S.", "The buffet is great for the price. I really enjoy their Chicken Tikka Masala and the fresh nann is to die for!! Super divey atmosphere but I love it!"], ["Vanessa L.", "I work just outside downtown LA and Gill's is the go-to option for Indian food because, well, it's pretty much the only option if you want a traditional take on Indian since you get a modern/fusion style at Badmaash.Gill's is okay; located inside a hotel, it's a sit down place with but not much going for it in the way of ambiance or decor. Usually we just go for the lunch buffet because it is fast and easy. It's $10 bucks a person and features typical dishes such as chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, curry (the curries vary from meat to vegetarian but usually only one is offered), dal, rice, salad, and dessert. There is always also some other type of vegetable dish, like aloo gobi (potato and cauliflower). The dishes themselves are average and, probably because they are buffet dishes, lack any type of spiciness. The flavors are very mild, especially for someone (like me) who loves spicy food. The tandoori chicken can get dry. Once I came with my fiance and we ordered off the menu but food was still pretty average. The naan bread that is brought warm and fresh to your table is one of the best parts of the meal, but it's hard to mess up naan. If I crave good Indian, I'll drive myself over to 3rd Street for some better, cheaper options, but Gill's is a place for an easy office lunch outing."], ["N B.", "Go eat here! \u00a0Indian food that hits the spot period. Order naan as you go. \u00a0The usual fare is great but try the lamb with some spice and basmati rice."], ["Anna P.", "I ordered delivery from here and was really pleased. I ordered butter chicken (mild), saag chicken, a bunch of naan, and samosas. Everything was excellent. I used to live in Delhi and the butter chicken really brought me back there, the samosas were nice and crispy and (really) big, and the saag chicken was great. I cannot speak for those who like spicier foods as I ordered everything in mild, but I would definitely order from here again."], ["Heidi H.", "I've never eaten at the restaurant so this review is solely based on their food. \u00a0 I am never disappointed with Gill's deliveries (free). \u00a0I've only had their Chicken TIkka Masala, Shrimp Saag, and Chicken Tandoori which are all delicious. \u00a0Their cheese nan is really good too. \u00a0Garlic is meh. \u00a0The only thing about this place is that the food seems very oily or buttery compared to other places. \u00a0But then again it makes it taste extra yummy.. \u00a0And if you love spice, ask for your dish to be really really really spicy and you will sweat bullets. \u00a0Love spicy food. \u00a0Love Gill's."], ["Cathy T.", "We love love love Gills. We've been ordering from them for over 2 years. They're our go to Indian place. Of all the other handful of Indian places in LA, they have the best hands down tasting dishes. We ALWAYS get the chicken tikka masala, sag paneer, garlic nan, basmati rice, and samosas. They're relatively quick; we wait about 45 min for delivery on week nights. Their restaurant is located inside what some could say is a sketchy looking hotel, but dont let that discourage you! Their space is intimate with an interesting Indian flare. But with all that aside, its the the food that is just bomb.com."], ["Allison H.", "Hidden in the heart of the Stillwell Hotel in DTLA, this little place is a gem. The lunch buffet (all you can eat) was a very pleasant surprise. And at a little under $10 per person, you really can't beat the price. Our warm naan bread was continually refilled by a smiling young man who was clearly focused on his job. The ambiance was very colorful and relaxing. Indian music played softly in the background - not too loud, not too soft. Just enough to enjoy your lunch companion's conversation clearly. I really appreciated this. The food was very good, not too spicy, very tasty. I will definitely come back. This place has all the components correct. Thank you!"], ["Cindy B.", "Oh man. Since coming back from London, I haven't had good Indian food and I was definitely craving it. I didn't want to go far so I thought I would give this place a try. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala for pick up and brought it up. It was really good but for the price, I would have expected that they would have thrown rice in there. I ended up cooking rice to go with it. After that, it was really good. Next time, I think I'm going to make my own food at home though. This wasn't worth it."], ["Nikitha R.", "Was craving for good Indian food (not tomato gravy!!!) and ended up in this nice restaurant in downtown. Its quite difficult to locate this place as it didn't have any board put up outside the building, but anyhow we managed to find it. We were bummed out that the buffet was only for lunch and hence ended up buying vegetarian pakora, shahi paneer, Malai kofta and garlic naan. Oh!the pakora was amazing and tasted just like how it tastes back in india :) amongst the two gravies , I personally liked the malai kofta better since it had proper seasoning which lacked in the shahi paneer. Garlic naan was incredibly soft and delicious. In beverages we ordered mango lassi, Chaas and masala chai, which were pretty good too. Oh ! And not to forget the complimentary papad that is served in the beginning ! We were one bunch of happy tummies walking out of the restaurant"], ["Jerry L.", "F$12 ayce Indian lunch including tips is a steal for DTLA. Tandoori chicken is on point here."], ["Stephen C.", "Gil's is one of those places that totally unaffected by the recent dtla transformation, and that makes the place so amazing. I go there by myself all the time. It's basically the exact opposite of Badmaash (which I also love), and it's a welcome respite from the expensive organic foodie stuff that's become way easier to find than just a good, old fashioned Indian restaurant. They're lodged in the back of a terrible old hotel that everyone hates but I love for the same reason I love Gil's: it's not trying to be anything other than what it is, and it doesn't care who you are. The waiters will serve you damn good food. They won't talk to you or be polite or do anything else. It's pretty sweet. They're totally jaded, but that's proof that Gil's has been around long enough for them to get that way. If you go there at an odd hour, they'll sit and watch soccer while you eat. This place is the restaurant equivalent of my favorite hole in the wall bar. They're awesome. The prices are even good. I wouldn't change a damn thing."], ["Esther G.", "Great selection for buffet . Extremely delicious food. The restaurant is nice inside. A little tricky if you're trying to look for it. It's inside a building. I don't like the service what so ever. Very rude all the time. Since I live close to here I wanted to try this place so I didn't have to drive all the way to Artesia to my friend's restaurant Ashoka the great. The parking is a pain, since being in DTLA you have to pay for parking. Not sure if I will be coming any time soon. Much rather go to Artesia."], ["Jen W.", "I love this place!Never seen it in person, as I always get delivery - it's amazing. Chicken tikka masala... so delicious. Samosas... hot and fresh. Just do it. You won't be disappointed!!!"], ["Maggie C.", "My friends like going to this restaurant for lunch. \u00a0I went with them a long time ago and hated it. \u00a0I couldn't eat anything at this place.I went back recently because 2 of my girlfriends wanted to go here :($8.95 lunch buffet is a steal.It wasn't as bad as the first visit but I stil didn't like it. \u00a0The only thing I could eat was the tikka masala sauce with naan bread.You can watch Bollywood while enjoying your lunch.QUICK TIP: IT IS LOCATED INSIDE STILLWELL HOTEL.2 stars!!Gill's Indian Restaurant is not yummylicious!!"], ["Ed S.", "I GOT SICK.They have a buffet for lunch, but they add new food over the old food and they mix it.They shouldn't have an A rating..."], ["Reesha P.", "Ridiculous. \u00a0Ordered the Chicken Biryani and it was the worst thing I have eaten till date.

I have never been a huge fan of Indian food but this restaurant has completely changed my entire views. I've tried various dishes but my absolute favorite is the mango chicken. It is super delicious and rich and goes perfect with the garlic nan. The restaurant is located in a 2 star hotel so don't be scared of the location because the food is great. The decor is old but the food is fresh and delicious."], ["Julie S.", "I was surprised to find a pretty decent Indian restaurant in DTLA, and the added bonus is that they deliver. Great for lazy nights in... which are becoming way more frequent these days but who's counting.We got the saag paneer & chicken vindaloo with rice and garlic naan. Everything was delicious and satisfying! I'll definitely order delivery again."], ["Guli S.", "I absolutely love the food, perfect for dinner. The fact that they have delivery is great. However, it's horrifying to have to deal with the rude man who answers the telephone and delivers the food. When trying to tip him because of miscommunication resulting in him waiting on us to come down to pick up the food, he yells \"I don't need no tip, call my manager, get me fired, I don't care.\" We know we inconvenienced you and we were at least trying to do our part and tip. Rude man, rude service. Sucks that we have to deal with angry people in order to get some good food."], ["Eric P.", "First: \"Estimate delivery time is 45 to 60 minutes.\".

My hips will not be thanking me though. So good!!! =PGill's is probably the only Indian buffet in the DTLA area. And it is such a steal. Only $8.99! The restaurant is located inside a hotel, so it isn't very visible on the street. We came during a Friday lunch and it was packed. The interior is relatively dark. I had to adjust my eyes a bit to actually see what I was scooping on to my plate. Limited seating inside, but they have a good amount of tables outside near the entrance.Tried pretty much everything they had to offer. About 8 different options and dessert! Not sure about all the names but I really liked the saag, fish curry, curry chickpeas and potato, tandoori chicken (juicy) and the chicken tikka masala. Delicious rice pudding for dessert topped it off for me. There was also fruit. Oh and the garlic naan. So buttery warm and fresh! I wanted a second plate but refrained because I would have gobbled it up. Nom nom nom!Service was great at lunch. Pretty efficient and they definitely hustled to keep refilling the buffet.

They continuously checked on the guests without interrupting our meal.

I absolutely loved that when the menu said spicy, they meant spicy! The former had delicious red bell peppers in a tomato sauce, the latter a chili sauce. Highly recommend.-Dum Gosht Biryani: husband LOVED this. It's made traditionally in a clay pot, with a great sauce to accompany the rice. This tasted exactly like the biryani we had in Hyderabad. Husband ate every last bit.-Chatpata Chilli Paneer (more paneer): this wasn't as chewy as the paneer from our appetizers. Nice and spicy.We got a few sides - some saffron and fried rice, roti and paneer naan. With all of this food, we only walked away with a tiny bit of chicken and some rice to take home. The service was really great, but just a little slow. It was clear that the wait staff was attentive and was letting us enjoy our meal (which we did!), but getting the check was a bit of a process.

Probably not."], ["Steve R.", "I wasn't blown away by the food that I got here, which is fine and somewhat expected in a local Indian restaurant, but I was a little off-put by how expensive it got to put a meal together. \u00a0A samosa here, some naan there, and all of the sudden your bill is quite pricey. \u00a0I got the \"badass\" chicken, which it definitely isn't. \u00a0I don't know why that dish is highlighted...definitely a skip. \u00a0I'd actually love to try some other things on the menu that I didn't get to...like the poutine or the lamb burger or the mango pork belly...but we'll see if I make it back due to the pricey nature of it. \u00a0I think the chai tea at the end of the meal typified the experience here. \u00a0Indian street-style chai is one of the main attractions of visiting India, and I've been craving it since my visit there. \u00a0The chai here was a noble effort, but didn't seem to really come close to what it purported to be. \u00a0I figure if you're going to charge a premium in all respects of the menu, I'd like to see the cuisine \"nailed,\" and I think they fall a bit short of that."], ["Seta A.", "How wonderful is Downtown LA food scene & eateries becoming! Lucky for us Angelenos!I loved loved this small two story hipstery with somewhat modern take on Indian food restaurant! Grubbing at its best. Great service included! It gets crowded so call ahead, or just enjoy people watching while you wait. I can speak volumes on how fun it was ordering Indian food with modern settings all the while food being served in traditional very authentic take in tin silverware and dishware! Can you picture that? Awesome!Order what you wish, you will love. Just leave room for the mango pudding/cake!"], ["Steve C.", "The servings are pretty small but the flavor definitely makes up for it.Definitely get the pork belly even though it's $16 for 3 small pieces. I loved how the Chicken Tikka Masala had a kick and spiciness to it that you usually don't get at other indian restaurants.This is a very small restaurant, come early as the wait can get long, and there isn't many places to sit. There is also little to no parking in this area, plan to pay for a garage or park a couple blocks away."], ["Vickie S.", "If you're expecting good Indian food, this place serves it. But if you're like me and expecting good Indian \"fusion\" food, you'll be bit disappointed. I came in expecting a unique dining experience since I've only had Indian food at more traditional restaurants. I was excited to try a trendy \"gastropub\" serving Indian-inspired flavors. Guess I should've studied the menu more carefully. The food is more traditional than \"new American\". We ordered the fried catfish (6 bite size pieces), traditional samosas (they are $4/piece), butter chicken, lamb vindaloo, masala poutine, mango pork belly, and some naan/rice. I have to say that the fry on the catfish and samosas are perfectly crunchy. The butter chicken and lamb vindaloo definitely have the bold flavors and Indian spices, but both were lacking in sauce. I wish I had more sauce to dip my naan. The masala poutine was good, but it tasted like normal poutine with some chicken. The pork belly was my favorite dish of the night, but the mango sauce was very faint and again, I couldn't taste the Indian fusion. There were two flavors of naan - plain and rosemary. Both had good textures, but again, where is the fusion? The restaurant is small with two floors and it actually smells more fragrant outside than inside, which is a plus for me. The decor is minimal and has a very casual vibe. The prices are kept low, but so are the portions, especially the appetizers."], ["Garen A.", "A truly great Indian experience in the heart of Downtown Los Angeles! Badmaash has been on my DTLA bucket list for quite some time. They intrigued me with their blend of both traditional and experimental Indian foods. We had:1. Classic Butter Chicken: Great flavor and wonderfully dipable (which is big for me)2. Tandoori Broccoli: It's an interesting concept, and the execution is nice, but there's just nothing remarkable about this dish. 3. Ghost Chili Lamb Vindaloo: A great dish, with just enough kick. I really enjoyed this one. We supplemented with Rosemary Naan and some plain rice. All in all the experience was definitely great. The wait staff is attentive and informative. I will say the space is kind of small, so make a reservation and be prepared to be quite close to those around you. Stay Cheerful ;)"], ["Theresa N.", "A very cool vibe! I love the movie they showed over hip hop music. The service here was on point, sometimes annoying that they kept asking how the food was.The only thing I dislike here was the pumpkin soup..just awful"], ["Justin O.", "Fairly small little spot but just follow your nose :) Inside is also pretty cozy with an upper level for additional seating. Service was pretty quick and I ordered a few apps and drinks + entrees. Mango lassi was tasty but was missing that little sour kick / spice that I'm used to from eating at Punjabi Dhaba in Cambridge. The butter chicken samosa was solid and had a lot of meat for a samosa! The 2 bite fish fry catfish was buttery and juicy. The sauce really paired well. Finally got down to the ghost pepper lamb and I have to say it definitely had some heat. Very tasty for me but I was a bit hot haha. The waiter actually ended up hooking me up with another lassi to help out (so cool!) so that was awesome and saved my tongue. Only thing that didn't really impress was the naan. I wish they had a good garlic naan that was buttery and light. Rosemary naan tastes the same as just naan.Overall great experience. Next time I'm going to have to save space for dessert.See you guys soon for sure!"], ["Vy T.", "I normally don't eat Indian food, but I saw a few pictures of their poutine on IG and it looked amazing! I stopped by with a few friends on a Friday night and it was pretty busy. Shout out to Knuckles, who got us a table to accommodate our group!We ordered a few entrees to share amongst our group. We started with the chili cheese naan, the butter chicken samosas, chicken poutine, and the spiced mango pork belly. The samosas was my favorite appetizer of the night. Crunchy on the outside with a creamy butter chicken filling. It also came with a cilantro dipping sauce that I loved! The naan was super soft like a pillow. but I didn't really taste too much of the cheese. The pork belly was another favorite of the night. It came with a \u00a0sweet mango sauce, and who doesn't like mangoes. The chicken poutine was yummy! I liked the cheese curds!Onto the entrees, we had the butter chicken, the chicken tikka masala and the ghost chili lamb vindaloo. We also ordered a few orders of rice to share, each rice portion is good for 2-3 people. The butter chicken and tikka masala was delicious and creamy. The lamb vindaloo was pretty spicy, so if you like spice its perfect. Overall, a great spot for a modern take on Indian food."], ["Lisa H.", "Came here with a group of four around 6:30pm. \u00a0It was kinda busy, but we were lucky to get seats right away.The taste and quality of the dishes are quite good. \u00a0We ordered the butter chicken, chicken tikka poutine, and the pork belly. \u00a0And of course, regular naan and rosemary naan. The butter chicken was flavorful, but not overwhelming and the chicken was moist. As for the chicken tikka poutine, those are some of the best fries I have had in a while. \u00a0It had a good crisp to them. I enjoyed the pork belly the most. \u00a0The sweet and tangy flavor along with the soft meat really brings in all together. As someone mentioned here, I agree that the menu is a bit small and lacking in variety, but they still do have a nice selection of dishes. \u00a0And yeah, it's also a bit on the pricier side of things. The portion sizes are just slightly on the smaller side, especially for the price you pay. Overall, the ambiance was neat, food good was good, and service was friendly and efficient. \u00a0Parking... well, not great."], ["Brandon S.", "We finally made it here for dinner. The main floor is a small space, but there is additional seating upstairs. The decor is cool. Our food came out very fast.We were sat right away. The entire time the staff was friendly and quite helpful. It is pretty much a small plate style, so we ordered several items to try. For sides we ordered the Aromatic Basmati Pilaf and the butter Naan. The rice had good flavor and complimented some of the other plates well. The naan, bread, was great. It tasted very good.For our plates we ordered the Badass Chicken Tikka, Chicken Tikka Poutine and the Spiced Mango Pork Belly. All three were very good. My favorite was the poutine. Fries covered in gravy and topped with meat is almost always good. It certainly is here. Of course pork bellies are always good, and theirs has a great spiced mango flavor. The chicken tikka also came through nicely with the flavor.For dessert I tried the mini ice cream sandwiches. These were great. They use Parle-G biscuits. The ice cream is good, but the biscuits are what make these great. They have excellent rich flavor.Overall this was a great experience. We received good service, food and value."], ["Annie L.", "I came here for a birthday dinner so we went off a pre-fix menu! I believe there were about 7-8 items I actually consumed that night, but I will just write about the ones I remember. 1. Chickpeas and ChipsPersonally, I didn't like this dish very much because I didn't like the texture of the mashed chickpeas. The chickpea mash was also kind of bland. 2. \u00a0Chicken SamosaThe best way I can explain this is that it kind of reminds me of a fried wonton filled with bbq chicken. The chicken was moist and dressed with a flavorful bbq sauce. **I also manage to try a bite of the regular potato samosa and personally I think it was kind of bland for my taste. 3. Chicken Tikka PoutineBeing a fan of poutine, I was super excited when I heard that this was on the menu. However, the taste was just ehh for me. The fries and gravy sauce were both salty creating a SALT OVERLOAD on my palate. But the actual meat and cheese were delicious though! 4. Chicken Tikka MisalaThis dish was my favorite of the night! The meat was super tender and delicious. I think I could of just scarfed down the sauce with a side of naan by itself. IT WAS THAT GOOD!Service:Service was spot on! Our big party was seated in the upstairs area and there were actually servers that constantly came up to check up on us! Final Verdict: This was my very first Indian dining experience and I am pretty sure it will not be my last! \u00a0Definitely going to give this place another shot and maybe next time I will be more adventurous and try something new!"], ["Rachel D.", "It is a rarity that I dine out for Indian food, and even rarer that I am impressed. But Badmaash is an exception. Located in trendy DTLA, Badmaash appears to be a little hole in the wall establishment very easy to walk right past if you're not paying attention. Honestly, it's not very impressive once you're inside. There is a small dining room with a counter serving about 6 tables, and a small top floor. The decor is clean albeit simple, nothing fancy. However, the food. The food is absolutely delicious, but even more than delicious, it is interesting. The flavor combinations are traditional but with a kicky modern flair.I came here for Dine LA, so my \u00a0review is based off of their menu:Summer Corn Gazpacho:A refreshing summer soup! Perfectly pureed and garnished with summer corn and cucumber. It was mild but tasty. The portion size was hearty for a tasting menu!Pickled Beet Salad:This was the first time in my life I ever truly enjoyed a beet. The manager came out to our table and talked to me while I was eating the dish, and he explained the pickling process (he was super nice!). You can taste the passion they put into their food in every bite you take. Another refreshing summer dish, the chopped salad was garnished with a yummy avocado puree.Matar Paloa Somosa:Perhaps I made a mistake not ordering the butter chicken somosa...However, when I pay 4 bucks for a somosa, I want it to be kick ass no matter what it is stuffed with! And I definitely don't want it to be greasy or to be wishing I was eating from the my local tandoori to-go spot. I really expected much much better from an establishment of this caliber.Main Dish:Butter Chicken with rice and Daal:WOW. Just Wow! This chicken was bursting with spices and flavor. Loved the gravy! Rice is rice, but the daal was the best daal I have tasted in my life. No joke. It was a very modern take to it, as it was not just purely lentils, but pretty chunky and seasoned perfectly. I could eat this dish for every meal.Fish in curry with collard greens:This dish was better than I expected. It was white market fish cooked perfectly. So moist and flavorful. The curry sauce and collard greens were delish, but the highlight was the pickled onions. I have never had an indian dish quite like it, but all of the elements worked together and it was quite easily one of my favorite fish dishes I have ever had. Dessert:For dessert they served us these cutie little ice cream sandwich cookies.A simple sweet treat to complete an adorable and memorable meal.The charm of Badmaash will bring me back just as much as the yummy food. From the Sari tutorial served with the meal to the tongue in cheek cheesy bollywood puns, this unique little eatery will have you smitten before you sink your teeth into your first naan."], ["Ariana R.", "Great experience for a first time Indian dinner in DTLA. First, when you walk in you immediately notice the small yet unique venue. Was greeted by Nuckle (pardon my spelling) who handled the table. He originally was going to seat us at the high top stool seating but then moved my boyfriend and I to the table-boyfriend hustled. Great service and really homey feel. I suggest to everyone that this isn't your average Indian family restaurant this a hip and new concept of the newer generation making something great.I will be back"], ["Ken K.", "A friend recommended Badmaash for dinner this past weekend, so I made reservations for 515pm (though that wasn't entirely necessary since they open at 5 for dinner and the restaurant is fairly empty at that time).I found metered (street) parking about a block down. I think you'd have to valet if you're not so lucky with finding a spot.I never noticed this restaurant when driving by. It's small, but fairly trendy inside. There is an upstairs section, though I didn't see it since we were seated downstairs.My friend had already ordered the Indian Pickles appetizer, and I was glad he did. This isn't something I would normally notice on a menu and order, but it was freaking delicious. I had never eaten pickled mushrooms before, but I couldn't stop eating these; I probably could have eaten 50 of them. The other veggies on the plate were good as well, but I sure loved those mushrooms.Of the three other dishes we ordered, my favorite was the Spiced Mango Pork Belly. The pork belly was cooked well, and that mango sauce was fantastic. I scooped up every last drop of it.The Classic Butter Chicken was my second favorite. The chicken was moist and the sauce had just the right amount of creaminess to it. Perfect for the chicken and perfect for dipping naan. Speaking of naan, the Rosemary naan was awesome. My friend really liked the Good Ol' Saag Paneer, but I wasn't as big a fan. I think it's an acquired taste, but the flavors were a bit over the top and bitter for me. But to each his own.I'm already looking forward to future visits so I can try the Lamb Burger, Poutine, Eggplant, and Chili Cheese Naan. I'm sure I'll try other things as well.Prices were a bit high in my opinion, but the quality of the food did not disappoint. And service was on point. Solid place for a slightly different take on Indian food."], ["Candace L.", "Badmaash came as a recommendation from a friend, which I love! I didn't find them on my own, or bookmark them on Yelp prior to this, it was strictly old fashioned word of mouth about good food in DTLA.My boyfriend and I had a 6P rezzie to grab dinner here before an 8P performance at the Ahmanson. I was a bit worried we were pushing it since we'd be driving from here to there, but not even close. We arrived very hungry and I was of course a bit agitated from sitting in traffic on the 101 all I wanted was a cold drink and food ASAP.Service was great! We were greeted and immediately taken upstairs to our table. This is definitively a hip eat - my first time having Indian while a bit of Biggie, yes Biggie, The Notorious B.I.G. plays over the sound system at an Indian food restaurant. Was I loving it? Of course! Was my boyfriend? Probably Not. Did I care? No. ;)We ordered up two samosas right away to get something to the table, one traditional and one butter chicken. I think I preferred the traditional and was very happy with the side chutneys. These come one per order, so you'll probably want a few at least. They didn't have the Thanksgiving samosa we saw on their online menu so that was a little disappointing. We glanced over the menu and I really wanted to have something a bit different than the same stuff we always order when having Indian and what better place to do that at than here?It may be a little lame to start with the Butter Chicken but gosh it was good! I love that their menu describes this dish as \"Indian Wedding Classic\" and although we aren't first timers to Indian we tend to order like we are.I also could not pass up the Chili Cheese Naan! I normally wouldn't be this experimental with a good thing but I love Serrano chilies and cheddar cheese so why not? It was delish! We could have stuffed ourselves silly and ordered two of these but one was completely satisfying paired with a delish yogurt dip and the rest of our dinner.I was all set to order the Chicken Tikka Masala - b.o.r.i.n.g!!! but thankfully my boyfriend spotted the Chicken Tikka Poutine! He reminded me that we had learned of this dish last year while in Vancouver and it was a Canadian thing! Fab, bring it on!We skipped on the Masala and ordered the Poutine, sooooo good! Very rich, but very tasty (two of my fav things ;). I mean can you really go wrong with cheese curds AND gravy? I think not.We ordered a side of rice to dish the butter chicken over and things were delightful.The food came out so quick which was really nice since I was a little concerned with timing. Not an issue here at all, everyone's dishes were coming out of the kitchen super quick.I of course could not skip dessert but after ordering the chocolate pot du cr\u00e8me I realized I could have. This was the only item I wasn't happy with and later wished I would have tried the ice cream sammiches. The serving dish which this item comes in is also a bit odd and makes scooping out the dessert a little challenging. I'd say skip this item, I've had too many awesome budinos that this little pot of pudding just failed in comparison.The small chai was sooooo good and a perfect finishing touch to our meal. I almost wanted another.They also have a beer and wine menu, which I passed on this evening but always good to know.I would definitely recommend this place if you are open to a fun environment, and great food! If you're looking for the more common Indian sit down meals in town, this is not it. I told my boyfriend it was actually really nice to enjoy one of my favorite foods in a completely different atmosphere than what we are use to when hitting the spots we do for Indian. Staff were all very friendly. Looking forward to returning when in the area.Parking - we parked blocks away on Main I think it was, at a meter which is free after 8P and walked around the corner to Badmaash."], ["Andrea V.", "They have a fair amount of options on their menu. I found this place to be average based on their dishes. Some were really good and some were just okay. I had good company (we celebrated his birthday here) so that was nice at least. Butter Chicken - This dish was average. It wasn't bad, but it was not great. I have had better butter chicken dishes elsewhere. I actually had a few bites with bone or something hard in it that I had to spit out. That's a little bit of a turn off for me!Eggplant Dish No 3 - This was my least favorite dish of the evening. It had a weird sauce that came with it (covered in it, actually) that really put me off. It was a weird combination that just did not sit well.Chicken Tikka Poutine - This was easily the best dish. They did a pretty excellent job putting it together. The cheese curds went so well with the fries. And the chicken in the poutine was very tender (and no tough pieces like the butter chicken).Parle G cookies with ice cream - very tiny, but decent. It seems like something you could easily make at home for about 10% of the cost at the restaurant. Maybe their ice cream is homemade? I'm not too sure...Another one checked off the list!"], ["Jackie M.", "Not authentic at all. Portions are ridiculously tinny. I asked for spicy food and they said we don't make spicy. Correct me if I am wrong but Indian food is known for spicy. I asked for nan with garlic they didn't have that they had chili cheese nan tasted like a quesadilla from Taco Bell.

The chicken tikki masala is the richest, most creamy delight I've ever had, and I grew up on rich and creamy Russian food. The mango chutney is hand made and chunky, and clearly doesn't come from a can/bottle. My only gripes with the place... 1) the takeout/delivery takes forever, especially since there is rarely anyone in the actual restaurant. It's worth it though, so whatever. 2) the parking lot is a bitch. It's on the corner of two busy streets, though, so that's to be expected. 3) the ambience. It's really pretty gross. The place is clean enough, but I wouldn't want to actually eat there. The baby yellow walls and sparse Indian decor is nauseating, the television is always playing loud Indian shows and the freezers are in the dining space, large and guady and full of God knows what. It's just not a comfortable place to eat, but that's why God invented take-out/delivery. Oh, and 4) this place is not that cheap, but the food quality and quantity is well worth it.

Note: when you pull up to this place, it looks like a hole in the wall...but don't be deterred! It's the best. I ordered the vegetable samosa for the appetizer, and vegetable masala with the added bits (I can't remember what it's called, but you can upgrade and they give you two sides, naan, and rice). The samosas were Devine. Fresh dough that was just fried filled with potato and peas with a wonderful curry and cumin spice. In addition they brought out two sauces to put on the samosas, and they both were so tasty, I just smothered them in both. One was bright green and one plum colored-- both cold, like a pickle chutney. My main course was fit for a Queen. I only could eat about half. I recommend if you upgrade, sharing. But I didn't mind because now I'll have delicious left overs :) the vegetable masala was sweet and rich and spicy. The chef put the spice on the side, and I'm glad, because the spice level was good for me without addition. It was a medley of carrot, cauliflower, and peas in a creamy tomato sauce. I couldn't stop consuming it. The sides were a spinach and chickpea mix, and a mashed chickpea sauce which I dipped the fresh naan in. It also came with a cool cucumber yogurt, which really cut the spice if I was feelin the heat. I definitely will be back here. I think it will become my go to cheap dinner.

The whole thing tasted exotic and had a good range of chicken, potatoes, and vegetables. The sauce was full of flavor, could really taste the different spices. It went really well with the rice.

I was treated to some of the leftovers which were still fresh and warm, and I was IMMEDIATELY hooked. They had some of the garlic naan, tikka masala chicken, and the vegetable dal. Each had their own distinct flavor, each was simply delicious. Although I could go on about the leftovers I had, this review is about the lunch special I just picked up. I was determined to try it again.It does look like a hole in the wall as others mention, but don't let that stop you from peeking in. When I pulled up it was pretty empty (a Friday afternoon after all) but they greeted me kindly and were just wrapping up my to-go order. They had good tunes blasting which really topped off the authenticity of the space.Although I got the lunch order it weighed a ton. I had a grin from ear to ear as I toted it back to my place. I could tell it was fresh because the entire order was literally too hot to eat, so I waited with anticipation for it to cool down a bit. I grabbed the tikka masala chicken and the regular naan. The chicken is incredibly tender and the tikka masala sauce was just as good as the last time I had it. The naan is perfectly baked to be crispy on the inside with lots of fluffy parts on the outside. I eat a lot and I could only finish half, so it's bundled nicely in my fridge for round 2 later tonight. A really good deal for the price and the food speaks for itself. It's dangerous how close this place is to my apartment, I'll be getting very familiar with the menu."], ["Raj K.", "Worst Indian restaurant \u00a0ever visited.

On given feedback the lady didn't even acknowledge the feedback saying we will check once and in fact told that this is the first time she had heard such a feedback.None of the utensils were clean and we went to pick our own water bottles \u00a0seeing the quality of water.

The vindaloo was watery and tasteless, the potatoes were so undercooked they were almost crunchy. The mixed tandoori is described as an assortment of lamb and chicken including kebab- but the kebab was one tube of brown meat with green parsley flakes sticking out of it. The entrees don't come with rice so you have to order that separately. The one nice thing I can say is the rice portion is huge. One serving served 2 people. And the naan was pretty good. My strongest complaint is the food was cold. I live 3 miles away and we ordered to go. Although there were only 2-4 people in the restaurant we waited approximately 25 minutes for the food.

Here, there were plenty of options from meat to veg to chutneys, salad, etc. The chick peas were ridiculously dry as was the filling for the samosas. However, the samosa was nice and flaky. Tandoori was kinda dry as well. The fish was cooked nicely yet some of the sauces were a tad flavorless.

I didn't try anything from the salad bar but picked up a nice green hot sauce there. I had the samosa, rice, goat curry, chicken tandoori, chicken tikka masala, and one of the vegetarian dishes - I forgot what it was. Overall, pretty good food, nothing was really spicy except for the goat curry so that was my favorite (i love my spicy food!). The chicken tandoori was really tender so that was delicious as well. I normally really like chicken tikka masala but didn't care for this one too much - probably because it didn't have enough spice to it. I don't remember the vegetarian dish at all so it was probably nothing special. Nice to know that they do have a vegetarian version for your friends who don't eat meat though! I tried the rice pudding and didn't really like it but I just don't like rice pudding in general. Loved the fresh fruit though - \u00a0it varies but they had watermelon and cantaloupe when i went!

I didn't try as many things as I should have, but what I did get was pretty yummy. I got the chicken tikka masala and dumped that all over rice! I got the eggplant, and the spinach with mushroom too. Everything was perfectly spicy and creamy and mixed so awesomely with my rice. They had a lot of cantaloupe, oranges and watermelon as well. Now, on to the service! Great! They came and refilled our waters and took away our plates at least 3-4 times. Every time someone would drop a little sauce at the buffet area, a worker would go wipe it down. I thought that was really nice of them. Also I think the manager came by our table twice asking if everything was okay.

Their egg masala was the same. Although they do give you a lot of rice . Their garlic naan is very tasty. I wouldn't say it's the best Indian food I've eaten. It's average if anything.

I was worried I would've had to pay to get the extra sauces on the side so I didn't make any note of it. When the food arrived I was shocked by the large portions. This was definitely enough for 4 people especially since the two Naans were as big as personal sized pizzas. The bag came complete with two containers of rice, a hefty portion of saag paneer (my vegetable choice), an equal sized portion of tikka masala, and a container of tandoori chicken that's about half a chicken. Not only that, all the sauces were already included!! You seriously can't beat the price. I would've paid way more for less food at a different location closer to me. The food here was equivalent to the food I've had elsewhere. My other reviews mention the slight blandness involved with the Indian food in this area. I think it's a smart marketing choice to attract curious diners, but for me, I would love to have access to an Indian restaurant that really brings that full bodied flavor that Indian food normally has.

That's what I foolishly thought before tasting the life-changing biriyani at BKH. I've been here a couple of times and ordered a couple of things. The hyderabadi kachi biriyani with lamb is a total show stopper: a mound of the most flavorful, spicy, buttery rice, piled high on top of a bone-in lamb shank so tender, you could pull it off the bone with a spoon. That lamb is some of the most tender, least gamey lamb I've ever tasted. I understand biriyani is sort of supposed to be a special occasion thing, and I can understand why. It's a rich, delicious treat. Another show stopper that I've ordered was the chicken karahi. They asked me \"Do you like spicy?\" and when I said yes, they recommended this dish. I specifically asked them to make it \"very spicy\" and they delivered. Each delicious bite of tender chicken was drenched in shimmering, seething hotness that made my eyes tear up. I have a high tolerance for spicy food. If you do too, come here and try this dish. It's rich and a little greasy, but the flavor and heat is fantastic. The last time I was here with one of my girl friends, we ordered bindi masala, a special of the day that consisted of okra cooked in a tomato based sauce. It was great! The okra was nice and crunchy, not slimy, and the flavor was great. We ate this with some basmati rice. Yum.I also get the samosas a lot, too. They're good. The green sauce in the squeeze bottle is wonderful. I hear this restaurant being talked about as some of the best Bangladeshi/Bengali restaurant in LA. As a white girl, I can't vouch for it's authenticity, I can certainly vouch for the quality of the food. If you've never had biriyani, come try it here and be spoiled, forever.

Even at fast food joints like Panda Express, they relay, \"this'll take 5-10 minutes til your order comes out.\" The cashier should've said something, just sayin'....The biryani chicken is not boneless--it's attached to the drumsticks. I don't usually expect this when eating curry chicken dishes.Albeit I did enjoy the tikka masala sauce since it was rich and creamy and I could taste the sugars amidst the spice, everything was just not expected and there are things Biriyani can improve upon.

I counted myself quite fortunate to have snatched the last available spot upon arrival.My friend and started off with an order of Beef Seekh Kabob and a pair of Mango Lassis. The kabobs were a bit on the spicy side, but otherwise quite decent. The lassis were quite refreshing (although they did little to quench the spiciness of the food, due to the viscosity of the yogurt).For our entrees, I had the \"student\" biriyani (I think it's not on the regular menu), and my friend ordered the lamb biriyani. We were both reasonably satisfied by the palatability of the plates - but no joke, the spiciness factor here was even more severe than that of the kabobs. We quickly secured a pitcher of cold water from the restaurant fridge, and drank almost all of it inbetween bites of the biriyani.For dessert, we each treated ourselves to a bowl of rice pudding. I don't think I've ever sampled bad rice pudding anywhere, and the rice pudding served here was no exception to that rule.The cashier/server (whom I suspect to be the owner of the restaurant) seemed like a pretty cool guy to deal with. Menu pricing is affordable, and portions are filling.

I was wrong because he ended up throwing up everything that night. It's the next morning he still isn't feeling well, I feel awful. All in all, don't eat there, it's not worth it.

Lastly, we ordered navaranat veggies, which was creamy and savory, \u00a0but I wished I ordered it medium heat too. The serving sizes were about 1 main dish per person, and it comes with a little serving of rice each. Garlic naan was a good size, but keep in mind they get soggy on the trip over.

Two intimate rows of booths flank the middle Isle which is set up for larger parties (good to know for the future) We were greeted promptly and welcomed warmly. The server answered all questions that we had clearly. We decided on the Anarkali dinner for two, which was more than enough for dinner and lunch the next day. I asked if we could sub the meat curry for chicken madras (a personal favorite) and the server graciously obliged. Everything was ordered at a medium spicy level. The beef samosas were HUGE, perhaps a tad overcooked, but still delicious. My boyfriend's favorite was the chicken Tikka Masala, and mine the madras. We ordered the garlic Naan for extra and I'm glad we did or else we would've run out! \u00a0But everything was amazing and perfect sized portions.

I was sad, but they gave me complimentary poppadoms which were super yummy, and the dessert I did get was tasty, so it was a wash. I got the chicken korma & chicken curry, both medium, plus meat samosas & garlic naan. The star of the order was definitely the chicken korma--great flavor, nice & creamy, and it paired nicely with the saffron rice. Medium wasn't spicy at all, but korma doesn't really need to be burn-your-face-off-spicy--I thought it was perfectly balanced. But if you really like spicy, go higher than medium on the korma. I found the chicken curry just OK--flavor on the curry wasn't super deep, but in hindsight I would probably get it with lamb, instead, and probably hot instead of medium. It was serviceable--but the korma was better. Garlic naan was good. I've gotten naan from some places and with delivery especially sometimes they arrive burnt, but it was a generous portion and arrived hot. Samosas were just OK? I think I'll try the vegetable ones next time.All-in-all, I've tried four or five other Indian restaurants that deliver in my area, and Anarkali was the best--I'd order again, especially the korma.

We felt like royalty as the owner kept coming by to see if everything was ok. At the end of our meal we received a complimentary dessert (gulab jamon) which was also very delicious and a perfect way to end our experience at this restaurant. But our experience did not end there. As we chatted with the owner for a bit after having our yummy dessert, he asked if we liked beer. Of course my fianc\u00e9 said yes, so the owner stepped away and came back with a couple of complimentary IPA's. Our experience at this restaurant simply got better by the minute!

This new place has no ambiance, it's much smaller, and the food is just okay.I used to go to the original Electric Lotus often until because I got busy with life I stopped going. That was a few years ago. Then we decided to go again and I was surprised to learn it had moved. I figured, it must have been a lease issue. But no it must have been more.Now to be fair, the food is decent, very decent and the portions are generous.

Highly reccommend!"], ["Priya G.", "SO OVERRATED!!! Eating Indian food growing up and at various restaurants in Los Angeles, I cannot imagine how some of the other yelpers have said this is the best Indian food in Los Angeles. In my humble opinion, Manohar Delhi Palace (who caters every Indian wedding in Southern California) outdoes this restaurant by a lot. The ambience here is nice, but needs work. It is dimly lit, with Moroccan lamps everywhere, and the seating layout is also good. However, when we first sat down, they did not have any music playing and you could hear everyone else's conversations. I jokingly told our waiter that they needed some good Indian tunes and he told me that they use Pandora, but the Ravi Shanker station they use starts and stops and is unpredictable, although the David Bowie station does not do the same. They ended up putting on the super American music (totally clashing with the theme), which was better than nothing.The food here was average at best. We started with the samosas, which were good. It did not go unnoticed that they brought a caddy of chutneys that were refrigerated. A lot of Indian restaurants in Los Angeles nickel and dime you for each chutney order but they didn't. We ordered the shahi paneer dinner plate which came with chole and saag paneer. It was out in less than 10 minutes and I immediately noticed that it looked very different from that shahi paneer I have had my entire life. I took a bite and it was not good at all. I asked our waiter if this was what we ordered and he said yes. I told him it does not look like the traditional dish we usually have and he was pretty confused. He offered to switch out the dish for the popular electric paneer which I thought would be a good option. It was definitely better then the shahi paneer but still just okay. We still paid for both.I ordered chai but it didn't come out till after the food and they didn't bring any sugar. :-/Overall, this restaurant definitely is not meant for Indians. The food is lacking in flavor and is not authentic. \u00a0However, I really appreciated the great service and smiling faces."], ["kendra f.", "Super yummy and comfy on a cold/rainy night!! Big portions for good prices. Oh and Todd is great!!! And James too!"], ["Miriam A.", "Food is absolutely delicious. The chicken tikka masala, the shrimp, the spinach, samosas, rice with onions and peas, and regular, cheese and garlic naan are all to die for. A little bit on the pricer side, but well worth it.

I eat everything, but I've been with friends who are vegetarian and vegan, and everyone can find something to their taste.When we go with my boyfriend, we usually get an a-la-carte entree, as well as another entree as a dinner plate (which includes two sides of the day, some rice, plus a naan bread). There's always enough left for a nice lunch for one of us the next day. Among my favorites are the aloo gohbi, the eggplant entree (can't remember the name), the saag paneer, chana masala, and the lamb mint curry. But really, I have yet to find something I don't like.

Actually, I was quite pleasantly surprised. But JSYK, I have eaten here before and did find the food to be quite flavorful and authentic. This time, I only ordered the Veggie Soup and the Vegetable Salad. (Or was it the Vegetable Soup and the Veggie Salad?) Well, anyway, the place was crowded to near-capacity, but Todd the server quickly and efficiently took my order. The soup and salad arrived simultaneously and I was really blown away. The salad, costing less than $5.00, was HUGE. All kinds of fresh veggies adorned it, such as red bell pepper, cucumber, tomato, etc., and its substrate was layers and layers of fresh dark greens. No wilting iceberg lettuce turning maroon at the edges here! It came with a large canister of a desi-esque (that means Indian subcontinent country style for you honkies out there) buttermilk ranch dressing, which I used about half of. Another nice touch (not terribly Indian but who cares?) were the crisp (not stale) tortilla strips on top!The soup was also marvelous: piping hot in generous portion, with a heady, seemingly authentic desi pungence, served in an elegant copper karahi. Chock full of fresh cauliflower mini-florets, green peas, carrot spears, savory potato chunks, etc., it redoled exotically of cinnamon and just a tinge of cumin. Perfect, really. Todd does get a bit rattled when it is busy, but don't mistake his \"way\" for rudeness or arrogance. He genuinely cares about your culinary experience and it soon shows. When things settle down later, he lets his hair down a bit, and he's really a great guy. I also observed that he practices genuine compassion in his work in a way that truly impressed me."], ["I G.", "I've walked by this place countless times. Its right in between Public House, a popular sports bar, and Sidewalk Grill, a great little mediterranean restaurant. So, there we were, dinner for 5.

I thought the food was decent, and was only disappointed by the undercooked garbanzo beans in the chana masala.

Of course when my friends asked for a good place I pulled out my phone and went straight to my ever so faithful yelp app. Found this place and so glad we did. The inside is not very big but cute and charming. The booths are quite small so we opted for the table. Especially if you plan on ordering a few varieties of dishes to share a table is a better choice. From what I observed it looked like they were getting much more take out and delivery business which makes sense due to the size of the place and the deliciousness of the food. Anyhow, I had no clue what to order so I let my friend handle the biz. She ordered garlic naan, vegetable samosas, Chana masala medium spicy, coconut chicken curry dish mild and a spinach paneer mild. The dishes came with house soup and rice. The house soup was so good. It was cold outside and we walked there from our movie and the soup hit the spot. It was perfectly seasoned and was so tasty. The samosas were tdf! Perfectly crispy on the outside and the potatoes were soft and so yummy and slightly spicy on the in together with the yogurt sauce made it a hit. Not having Indian before I had no idea what to expect but once I started to taste all of the wonderful flavors I had an idea of what each dish may taste like but each forkful was a surprise of different flavors. The Chana was my favorite! Chickpeas in a tomato based sauce that was spicy and went perfectly with the rice and naan. Every single spice went perfectly together. The spinach dish and the curry were also perfect. My friend that has had Indian many a time said that this was some of the best she has ever had.

Yelpers are fucking crazy. \u00a0That girl left a bad review about the mango lycee. Only crazy people leave bad reviews......Did you talk to the guy with halitosis?\" I ordered the dinner for the chicken tika masala. \u00a0They spilled sugar into it. \u00a0The rice was dry and clumped together. \u00a0About halfway through the meal, I bite onto something slightly hard and painful. \u00a0It turns out it was a piece of SCOURING PAD. \u00a0That warrants a highly negative yelp review or maybe i'm just \"crazy\". Right. \u00a0 Don't go to this place if you don't want to find pieces of scouring pad in your food."], ["Buzz P.", "Came here on a Thursday night with my daughter. All of the other guests dining here were Indian, so that was a very good sign. :-)We were looking for some grain-free and dairy-free Indian options and this place could accommodate us, as their curry sauces are grain/dairy free. We had the chicken madras dinner and the chicken curry dinner. Came with lentil soup and rice. Waters to drink. You can select the spiciness of the meal, and we had mild and medium.The lentil soup was good and the curry dishes were excellent. Our check was $30 and change after tax. The restaurant is very small and had typical decor of an Indian restaurant in a strip mall. Service was a little slow but not bad. Also, I noticed they had a TON of deliveries going out the whole time we were there which is also a good sign. I recommend and would repeat."], ["Veena G.", "It's ok. Nice customer service and quick but I'm Indian and I love truly authentic food. The channa masala was loved by my kid but it tasted like garbanzo beans in tomato soup. It was good just not what I was looking for to hit the spot for Indian food"], ["Vijayan S.", "I had a vegetarian lunch , \u00a0ordered 2 side dishes & naan , vegetables were not cooked fully , rice also was half boiled . it was high $$ spent for an very average indian food."], ["Fa I.", "First of all I am a big fan of Indian cuisines, so therefore I have tried many indian restaurants around LA. But this restaurant is always in my favorite list. I always get deliveries \u00a0from this restaurant, \u00a0but last week while I was driving I thought to give it a try in the dining. At the beginning I couldn't expect any amazing service but I expected only good food. When I entered into the restaurant I was really amazed and was greeted by the waiter nicely. As I was placing my order the waiter recommend many extraordinary dishes those I never had before. While I was eating the waiter came to me and asked several times how am I doing or if everything is alright. This is for sure I am going to place lot more orders in this restaurant."]]}
