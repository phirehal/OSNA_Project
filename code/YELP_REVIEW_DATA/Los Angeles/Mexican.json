As we were ordering the manager comes up to us and asked us if we wanted to be sat at the community table and he would take care of us and make sure we don't miss that train. Wow it's the little things like this that make customers feel special or at home.We ordered 2 Carne Asada plates and a papa and chorizo taco plate. The Carne Asada was cooked perfectly and had the right balance of citrus, spice and heartiness to it. The tacos were amazing, I'm not a huge fan of chorizo but this place really made each bite just as good as the first.

They have very interesting menu items and bizarre flavors. Heres what me and cousin i treated had:Shrimp tacos =very good but 2 tiny tacos for 14 bucks. Ditto the chicken ones 12 bux. Very pricey. Flavors are great but ridiculously overspiced, as are pretty much most items. If you can't handle heat best you don't come here. \u00a0As for me, my taste buds say yes but hemorrhoids say no mas por favor.Weird fried corn or potato?chips= only bargain,2 bucks gets you airy crispy air popped like chips with a bit of cayenne pepper im assuming. \u00a0Fried chicken pieces and skin.....didnt like this item. Very salty.Rice and beans=prepared very unusually. Rice was burnt and crispy on purpose. Beans were cooked with huge garlic chunks and reddish flavors tasted like garbanzos. Didn't like this either.Quality of the food is pretty good but the flavors are just too risqu\u00e9 for me to come back again. \u00a0And as mentioned spicey and pricey as fuck.

There's enough that the choices can be overwhelming or underwhelming, depending on who you talk to.Then here comes an \"upscale\" type place that sells tacos. I do like the upscale/relaxed vibe of this place, without charging their patrons the \"upscale\" pricing (to me at least).For an appetizer, I ordered the Lemon Pepper Chicken Chicharrones + Fried Clams and Shishito peppers. The Chicharrones and fried clams were nicely crisp and the lemon pepper and Shishito peppers add to the flavors and it's a nice \"wake up\" to the senses without assaulting you.I then ordered the Clam and Lardo tacos (2 tacos per order) for my main appetizer. The Clam and Lardo works and was quite surprised that the clams didn't have the typical rubber band texture to them and the lardo complements the clams perfectly and just melts with each bite. I didn't want to douse the tacos and ruin the flavors, so I left them without adding any.The watermelon agua frescha was really refreshing without being too overly sweet.The wait staff and I believe owner were always on point when they saw that we needed things and didn't leave us for too long for own devices (phones, heh).

The Chicken chicharron were amazing! Tacos of Pork & shrimp were both outstanding. The tortillas were freshly made with heirloom corn masa. Its about as good as a corn tortilla can get. \u00a0I can't wait to try more. The low star reviews here are all \"punishment\" reviews because the place is doing so well they are having a hard time keeping up, so they are rating on service alone.

I pass by this spot everyday and was slightly disappointed that Mo Chica closed down.. but after trying this place, I am so happy it took over.Let me start with the wait... it is not the business. We had reservations for 8:15 but we sat at 8:50. I was pretty haaaangry by the time we sat but the delicious food dissolved my anger and hunger. It wasn't the hosts' fault that we sat so late, it was those damn lingerers. If you are done eating your food, get the fuck out, not chill and talk over empty glasses of water. But thank you to the host for being understanding and trying to seat us as fast as possible. I guess an hour wait is a norm here so prepare to wait! Seven grand is right across the street so grab a drink while you wait. :) The service... The restaurant is too crackin to provide stellar service, in my opinion. It took about 17 minutes for our drinks to come out, water included. I don't think it takes that long for a glass of rose, a cocktail and two shots of tequila (the drinks were all really good btw)... but I know the restaurant was slammed so it's okay. Once the food came out, all our impatience went away. Our water cups were never empty and the server checked up on us many times. The food:Lemon pepper chicken chicharrones: perfectly crispy and full of flavor, highly recommend! Wish I can snack on these while I watch tv at home-----------Rice and beans: different than your usual rice and beans but delicious nonetheless! Rice is crispy-----------Chorizo and papas tacos: favorite of the night by everyone at the table, taco is bursting with flavor from the chorizo and soft potato -----------Shrimp tacos: yummy shrimp with yummy sauces on top. I love shrimp!! -----------Mushroom and garlic tacos: if you like mushrooms, you'll definitely like this! -----------Grilled Brentwood corn: so good we ordered two orders of it!! Best street corn I've had! That kewpie mayo makes a huge difference!! -----------Carne asada: cooked perfectly and tender! Wish there was more of it though-----------Campechana verde: spicy as hell!!!! Seafood is fresh and goes well with chips -----------Tres leches: they were out of churros (FML!!!) but I'm so glad we got to try this! It was delicious! Moist cake and the macadamia nuts and the brown sugar meringue topped it perfectly. The decor of this place is cute, with color splashed around the restaurant and pillows for your back at some tables. I liked the presentation of the food as well, minimalistic and cute. The appetizers come in small brown bags which I thought was not a bad idea. Candle lit ambience makes it a good place for a date. There's valet out front or a structure on Grand Ave that goes for $7 (flat fee). The restaurant can get a little pricey but I think the quality makes it worth it! Definitely a great addition to DTLA, can't wait to go back."], ["Trisha A.", "WOW! just wow! i can't stop thinking about the carne asada ($14) i requested to have the meat cooked on the rare side and it almost melted in my mouth. the flavors worked well with the sauteed spring onion, tomatillo, and roasted squash. the flavors were so rich and the meat was very tender. the only downside is the very small portions at this restaurant. i guess quality over quantity. we also got the durtios ($2) i would skip on this the next time because it lacked the lime and tapatio flavor that i am used to. the \"rice and beans\" ($6) is not what you expect. it was more of an appetizer. it was toasted rice, beans, and chiles. it would go perfect with your beer. i liked that the carnitas tacos ($9) came with a good amount of guacamole. the carnitas were moist but the tortillas weren't that soft.we had excellent service from the staff and our waters were always being refilled. we had to skip on the churros because we were going to be late for our movie. next time for sure!"], ["Julienne D.", "Never lie about what you are allergic to or what you don't like. So I did tell the waiter offhand that I was allergic to cilantro (which I'm really not.. But I really really hate it).. But GIVEN it is a taqueria, I should've known better. I ordered the Chorizo & Papas taco. It seemed harmless enough but the waiter did tell me that the pans they use and some of their mixing are all usually done with cilantro. So yes, fair warning. Finally got the plates out and so many cilantro pieces on the papas.. My friends were impressed with how hard I tried to get every piece or shred of cilantro off of it! It was like an intense game of operation. From the moment those plates touched down at our table.. Our waiter went MIA. Never revisited us. Probably because he saw me picking out the cilantro. The only time he made a reappearance was when the manager gave us the wrong check! I ate one taco. I did my best. The moment I tasted cilantro, I downed my glass of water in one drink! Lol. Never got a refill for water because I think the waiter was trying to ignore the whole cilantro ordeal. Lesson learned: This is a clear reminder why I CAN'T do Mexican food. Ever. Cilantro. Ugh.

Each order of taco is for two pieces, and they start at $8. For that price, I'd rather go a few blocks away to Guisados. The Duritos were interesting and quite spicy. I think one thing that wasn't clear on the menu was how spicy the food would be. Not good for people who don't like spicy food and get surprised by how spicy things are. Luckily, I was ok with all the spiciness, but not everyone in the party was I tried the chicken and the chorizo & papas tacos. The chicken wasn't anything special. The chorizo and papas was a bit more interesting, mainly due to the crunchiness of the potato. \u00a0The churros were probably the best part of the meal. Perfectly fried outside with a warm and soft inside. The chocolate sauce had a kick to it too. If I ever end back here, will have to try the carne asada that everyone raves about."], ["Gary I.", "In the same space as Mochica Peruvian cuisine. (Requiescat in Pace)The BAD: \u00a0 BS Taqueria is another rip off joint, but not quite as bad as Bar Ama. \u00a0They both serve, for the most part, mediocre food at highly expensive prices. \u00a0Cauliflower for $11 in which the amount of cauliflower if bought from a supermarket would amount to at most 50 cents??? \u00a0Clam & lardo tacos that aren't that delicious & have greasy fat w/ no flavor that would clog arteries for $7 bucks a piece. \u00a0Puffed rice & fried garbanzo, butter beans touched up with fried Fresno chiles & a bit of Cotija cheese which tastes OK for the first few bites, but they end up being mouth drying & boring. \u00a0The sliced Nopales cactus paddles & bean sprouts seem to be doused in sour dill pickle juice which doesn't seem to take too much skill to create. \u00a0 \u00a0 The shame of it is is that most of the above foods can be made at home by a fairly amateur cook & cost far less saving money to pay the rent or house payment or to a Roth IRA for a more comfortable retirement. \u00a0 I feel as though I have been culinarily raped. \u00a0 \u00a0The GOOD: \u00a0 The Tacos de Carnitas/pork were good being braised in a meaty broth, kind of like pot roast, but at $4.50 a piece, I would expect it to be good. \u00a0The Churros were extra light & creamy in the center w/ a milk chocolate sauce infused w/ a bit of piquant, smoky chile arbol which worked well. \u00a0However, these two dishes don't hide the fact that most of this food at BS Taqueria are super overpriced for what you get. \u00a0Our waitress was kind, friendly efficient as well as the Maitre de Restaurant who kept a watchful eye on what was going on & pitching in when there was a need. \u00a0Certainly no complaints on the service end of things. \u00a0 \u00a02+ Yelp stars for third rate food at first rate prices.

Great addition to the DTLA dining scene."], ["Vanessa M.", "3 1/2 stars.My gfs and I planned to have dinner, so it was my duty as usual to find a place to eat. I have heard about Taqueria, and that they were known for their churros. The food looked good and I loved churros so I thought this would be a great place to check out. Parking is valet $6 (validated) or street parking. A bit heard to find at first so make sure to look up on their sign. The inside is real quaint and colorful. Has that modern Spanish feel to it. The color scheme inside was great as well as the hanging decoration from the ceiling. But for the yelpers not a great place to take pictures of the food since it's pretty dark inside. It seemed like they had seating in the back as well but I did not check. Menu is tapas style, even the entree we had was pretty small. They have a happy hour menu (5:30-7 / mon-fri) of a few drinks and one food item, which is tostada for $2_Campechana Verde ($18) Squid, Scallop, Snapper, Cucumber, Shrimp, Octopus, Tomatillo, Tostadas. Great presentation. Comes in a huge margarita type of mug. The chips were served in a rolled up brown bag, and were perfectly crisp and warm. The ceviche was good. Good amount of mixed fresh seafood. Wish they added a bit more though. My one thing, I wish it said on the menu that it was spicy. I can't do spicy so when I had it, it was pretty spicy to me, and even to my friends, whom can usually do spicy food. There were small green chilies everywhere. Luckily it was not too bad but still a heads up. Out waiter was nice and gave us all a shot of some horchata drink (usally made with ride but this was made with barley). This helped to clear out the spiciness. The drink was pretty good! I've had better authentic cecviche and tostada elsewhere for half the price but this was still pretty good to share with friends as an appetizer._Chicken Tacos ($8) Comes in 2. The chicken was cooked well but pretty salty. I liked the avocado that was spread out. That was pretty much it. Not that memorable and not worth the price. It would be worth the price if it just wowed me. It was just okay._Lengua Tacos ($9) Comes in 2. This was pretty good. The lengua taco was a bit more stew like. Kind of like Guisados (if you have been there). Served with pickled onions, which helped to add some citrus and sweetness. I would get this again but it can be a bit rich and heavy._Carne Asada ($15) Spring Onion, Roasted Squash, Tomatillo. This was a lot smaller in portion than I had thought from when I saw the pictures. But it's a good portion if you had a few plates here and there as well. The asada was cooked perfectly. Very tender and smooth. However it was a bit salty. It was good throughout but my gf's and I each had a moment where it was like holy F that's salty. Must have been a few bites that had extra salt. However what really elevated this dish, aside from the asada itself was the roasted squash. I thought it was potatoes but now seeing the menu I guess it was squash. This helped for texture as well as extra tomato type of taste that paired real well with the asada. I would recommend this, my only thing would just to ease up on the seasoning/ salt._Churros ($7) Chile de Arbol-Chocolate. Okay, so after all the hype about their churros, I must say I was a tad dissapointed. Maybe my expectations were too high but this was not up to par. It was good yes, but different than your typical churros you get at disneyland or food stands. One, the churro size is short/smaller but chunky. Two, the texture is way more soft and fluffy instead of crunchy. And third, they put too much sugar on top and could have used some cinnamon. I can tell it was handmade, and that I appreciated, I liked that it was real fluffy, but when you eat it you miss that crunch you get and the more you eat it can almost taste dough like as it was real soft. The chocolate on the side, however was great. Not too strong or rich and was perfect to dip the churros. _Gordo Cup ($6) (Part of happy hour) Mezcal, Cucumber, Lime, Agave, Fleur de Sel. I usually stay away from Tequila, but this drink was pretty darn good. Not too strong or sweet. The cucumber aftertaste was very refreshing. I would come here and get this again and again.Our waiter Tim was great! very helpful, attentive, and sweet. I would come here for the drinks but not too crazy about the food."], ["Vanessa L.", "I stopped by for lunch yesterday. Order and pay first. Once we sat down the food was brought out right away.

It was just that good. Everything about this place worked. The location is in the heart of the new downtown L.A. The set-up is good; you walk in, order your food at the counter, and take your number place it on your table and wait for the good stuff to happen. It's super clean and the staff is super friendly and helpful.Now lets talk about the good stuff happening. I ordered shrimp tacos and the Brentwood corn. The two tacos you get are laying in a heavier corn tortilla than usual. This proves to be important due to the fact that there is so much going on, in and on these tacos, that this heavier tortilla holds the whole thing together without it falling apart. Good form B.S. It is very much an excellent taco (the first Wow).I have had corn prepared 1,000 different ways. Ray Garcia's Brentwood Corn-on-the-cob-on-a-stick is eons better than any corn dish I have ever eaten. Understand the gravity of what I just said. This means that the 999 other corn recipes I have eaten were inferior to this (yeah, the second Wow). This dish was unbelievable - period.I would have ordered dessert, but the meter I had just put 2 hours worth of parking on hiccuped and only gave me 45 minutes (thanks L.A. for another broken parking meter).

And sure enough once I shared this place with family and friends they started going without me -meh, oh well Good times!.Anyway they have a good variety of Mexican dishes/drinks but my personal favorites are the Delicious and refreshing natural aguas frescas, more specifically the agua de Nopal con Pi\u00f1a (cactus and pineapple) - a weird combination but totally yumm! Food-wise, I especially enjoy the steak and chilaquiles and always recommend the El Rey plate, which has a nice amount of food, steak, beans, rice and more.

We just watched the finale of Master Chef in which Claudia was announced the first Latina master chef and the dishes she presented made me excited for elevated Mexican food.I thought everything was pretty good. The only thing was that I felt everything was similar in that it was creamy and cheesy. I know this is Mexican food but my thought on elevating it includes making it less typically heavy. We ordered the esquite, goat cheese tamal, and chile relleno, and finished with the mango panna cotta. Our favorite was the dessert. It was unique and refreshingly tasty. My bf ranked the chile relleno 2nd while I thought the tamal was 2nd. I felt the chile relleno was pretty good. Cheesy (I love cheese) with kale (making it seemingly healthier) but I didn't really taste the chile. It was mainly cheesy kale. And my bf felt the tamale didn't have enough filling though I felt it was enough. But overall we liked the food and would come back and try other items (the chicharrone, enchiladas, quesadilla to name a few).

It was spot on in fact.Because it was my birthday, I indulged in an adult beverage: the Surfer Rosa (Pimm's No. 1, Ancho Reyes, Lemon, Strawberry Shrub, Basil Flower). Now, I am a fan of Pimm's so I thoroughly enjoyed this drink. It was served with the tiny crushed ice you find at Thai restaurants and Coffee Bean. As an ice snob, I found this to be a really nice touch.Pretty much entirely at our lovely server's suggestion, we ordered the Requeson, Esquites, Fava Bean Tamale, Chile Relleno, Quesadilla, and the Chicharron. For three people, this ended up being the perfect amount of food. And to be completely honest with you, there was not a weak dish in the bunch. The crunch of the snap peas paired with the black sesame and agave in the Requeson made for a very unique and surprisingly refreshing dish (not typical of plates centered around cheese). The Esquites were a delicious and spicy nod to Mexican corn on the cob. Do yourself a favor and get the fava bean tamale. As our server mentioned, you won't find anything like it anywhere else. The relleno and the quesadilla were also pretty spectacular, each bursting with flavor.While I maintain that there was no real star because it was all fabulous, the Chicharron was particularly fantastic. It is presented in the round and the entire thing is covered in perfectly crispy skin and topped with this unbelievable garlic sauce. We ordered extra heirloom corn tortillas (housemade, black corn, awesome) to soak up every bit of it.I knocked off a star because it is on the pricey side for the portion sizes, but that really shouldn't dissuade you from making the trip. It is really quite a sensory experience all around. Bravo."], ["Alex P.", "Man, my Spanish is broken.Hola, mi nombre es Alex. Aprendi espanol en la escuela secundaria. \u00a0I no lo uso mucho. Se podria decir que mi espanol es bueno. Muy bueno. Me gusta la comida mexicana. Los Angeles tiene la comida mexicana. \u00bfDonde esta la biblioteca?!Yep, I should probably stop.Elevating Mexican food is probably one of the hardest things to do, like harder than sneezing and coughing at the same time. \u00a0What? If you're a newbie like me when you think about Mexican food you think about The Corn Man, taco stands on the side of the street, the original LA food trucks, heck maybe even Chipotle and Taco Bell. Bottom line is Mexican food typically is commoner type of food. \u00a0To elevate it to this level and reinvent is something that is extremely hard to achieve, but Chef Ray Garcia and Jacob Shure have created something special.Ninja HospitalityI like feeling at home when I eat out, everything from the eclectic decor, friendly busers, folded napkins when you leave the table, and lastly an awesome motherly waitress. \u00a0Everything just short of just tucking me in at night with my teddy bear and a kiss on my forehead.See in, See OutThey transformed the old Riviera restaurant into a true LA restaurant that has massive windows and sliding doors that open out to the street so you can check out all the hot chicks and dudes walking by to LA Live. \u00a0Hollar! Can I have your number? Can I have it? Can I?Pricey but just rightDon't forget to bring your wallet. \u00a0It's definitely not casual dinner prices...unless it is for you, then I would like to hang out with you! For instance, it's hard to justify a $14 quesadilla unless it was sprinkled with gold dust and the cheese was made from extinct wooly mammoth. \u00a0But if you end up going, make it a celebration and just have a good time."], ["Josh S.", "I'll make this easy for those skimming over reviews -- I expected better from Ray Garcia. But if you'd like to learn why, I'll explain where the stars were lost. Just to set the mood, Broken Spanish is located in South Park, a few blocks from hustle and bustle of Staples/LA Live. A friend recommended it, and based on the menu (duck heart, foie, oxtail, all with Latin flair from a spectacular chef), seemed like sure slam dunk. OK, so maybe I set myself up with overly high expectations.The venue itself is slender, with a look I can only describe as mid-century modern garden chic. We got there early, and grabbed a seat at the bar while they got our table ready. We probably sat within 5 minutes of our reservation.A note on the cocktails, they're fantastic. While I'm not sure I'd return for the food, I'd drink here in a wink (is that a term?). It's a travesty the drink menu is not on the website, because I can't remember the names, but I did my due diligence in sampling a healthy share, and didn't taste a dud.OK, so not all the food was bad, but it was definitely mixed. What was great? The Pipian, an obscenely large turkey leg that easily serves four, was fantastic. Same goes for the Queso Fundido. The Camote was pretty good too. The not so good include the Salpicon, which I think was more a case of ignorant expectations. It's a cold beef salad, but you wouldn't know that based on its description. I expected something closer to ropa vieja.The whipped carnitas fat was a big disappointment. I love lard, and butter, but it was missing flavor, particularly salt. Finally, we come to the Corazon Asado. I like heart - chicken heart, beef heart, so I assumed duck heart would be something more like fattier chicken heart, but the taste ended up being far gamier. That could also be on me.But after all that, the biggest complaint was the service. They just wouldn't leave us be to sit and enjoy conversation. I understand businesses need to turn tables, but the moment we stopped eating something they wanted to clear our table, and they'd come back every few minutes to ask. We wasted a lot of food because not once did they ask if we wanted any of it boxed. And it's not like we weren't drinking our share in the meantime. I'll give the food a pass, and would be willing to try it again, and I'd definitely drink here in a heartbeat, but for the love of god, let your patrons converse.Side note, if you happen to use the men's bathroom stall, look up. Ceiling is huge, and uh, there's a colorful full sized cow climbing down the wall like Spider Man."], ["Adele F.", "Came here last Sunday for early dinner before the J Cole concert at Staples. Pros:- very friendly service from the hostess (who offered to watch our car and wait until the valet arrived so we could head on inside) to our server who was very knowledgeable and to all the busboys.- great cocktails- good food- beautiful spaceCons:- no chips!!!- some of the items were a tad too salty for me (and I generally like salty things)"], ["Kate M.", "(Updated now that I've been twice!)Love love love Broken Spanish! The esquites, relleno, pulpo (octopus), fundido, mushrooms, chicharrones, and duck are all DELICIOUS. In two visits we ordered the chicharrones both times.

Desserts were kind of misses, but the whole experience is so wonderful--the best servers in LA work here--that I don't even care. I hope it thrives. Pretty sure it will."], ["Tony H.", "What a great time! I couldn't stop eating and the ambience is incredible and alive in the heart of downtown. Our waiter, Rob, was so easy going and knowledgeable that I loved every dish that came out. The tortillas are immaculate. Order the tamale (1 of each, trust me)! The shrimp plate is amazing. We loved the oxtail quesadilla, tacos de jamaica, and the Chile Relleno was the best Relleno I've ever had. And to close out, get the Chicharron and the Pipian turkey leg, then just go to sleep happy. We dined in the \"sala\" room and got to walk out of the retractable glass walls when we were done. I'm coming back next week. This place was impressive."], ["Megyn C.", "Aye. Big fan of BS Taqueria, but the service last night at Broken Spanish was dismal. It took 15 minutes and a busboy offering (of his own volition) to put in our drink orders before a waiter came to the table. The table that was seated after us received multiple dishes before our tortillas came out, not to mention it took almost 20 mins for our table to be cleared & receive the bill. So, here's the thing. My partner is vegan, and when asking if any of the vegetarian dishes could be modified to not include dairy, the waiter looked dumbfounded and suggested the chicken to him. I totally get it, not all restaurants are accommodating to everyone's dietary restrictions (nor should they be), but the servers at BS Taqueria have always been more than willing to check with the kitchen to see if modifications are possible. Not so much at Broken Spanish. He ended up with the mashed potato-stuffed chile relleno, but I took the first bite and I'm pretty positive those potatoes were loaded with butter. It's a shame, because the food IS delicious, the drinks are fantastic, but if the menu can't be modified to accommodate certain dietary restrictions, at least be honest about it."], ["Amanda H.", "Everything about this place is fabulous. \u00a0From the super enthusiastic staff to the valet guy outside!!!First of all, the staff knows they are serving up some of the best food in DTLA -- so they are proud and ready to help you have an experience you won't forget.To be honest I am at a complete loss for words - Chef Ray Garcia has really elevated Mexican food to a new level. \u00a0Everything I had was fabulous from the first bite to the last. \u00a0And I plan on return to taste everything I didn't try on my first visit and bring my mom.I highly recommend everyone go to Broken Spanish and enjoy what I would like to think of as a High End Home cooked Mexican Meal!!!!!!!!"], ["Dylan M.", "Everything was great.

Of course you do. Who wouldn't want a chili spiced, roasted lamb's head?This was the old Rivera after John Sedlar packed up his Painted Desert Salmon and blew town. Eat at the large counter overlooking the kitchen and watch the squadron of cooks...cook. \u00a0Thankfully, there is no cacophonous rock loop to keep you from over hearing the banal chit chat of the couple at the next table or the inspired insights of the companion at your table. Although it gets noisy as the night wears on and there is a constant buzz as if all of Bill Cosby's dates showed up there at the same time to drink, share plates and tales. The vibe has lots of thigh high leather, wobbly heels, and G Q portfolios to gaze at if that adds to your night out.The Staff is truly warm, friendly, and really wants you to enjoy your evening of B. S. and their spin on Mexican/Latin food. They are efficient and unobtrusive and there is always someone dropping off and picking up from your table. It's as busy as Monday morning at Day Care. A Patron Saint: Bourbon, Ancho Reyes, Lemon, Tamarind, Egg Whites, Bitters, all in a cutesy little stemless glass. Tasty enough, but what else should you try? A Gringo: House made Coffee Liqueur, Cardamon, Cinnamon, Piloncillo, (es...Spanish for brown sugar), Barley Horchata, Spices (grated Nutmeg) on the rocks. It was a Starbucks Frappuccino in a bottle unleashed. A Yoohoo on steroids. I had four and waited to be wide awake until the next Debate, or dead by morning. Neither occurred. A tasty caffeine fuzz with no buzz. Was it yummy anyway? I'll have four more to go thank you. There is short stack of snacks to be had, shared or hogged along with some larger plates. The Molletes, traditionally a Mexican breakfast item, appeared on a sliced toasted baguette topped with smashed frijoles negros, English peas, Yerba Buena, Ground Pecans and Panela cheese. A Cafe de Olla and the NY Times Book Review Section...I'm all set for the day. It also had a kick like a nasty four year old at someone else's birthday party. The Quesadilla: These were delicious. Oxtail, Plantain, Habanero, Salsa Quemado all in a long simmered Guisado. (Stew) It too had a slow crawl of heat and the two perfectly formed Quesdillatitos were posed together like a Tortilla Factory calendar. You know, with the Aztec hunk carrying off the swooning virgin Princess to her delight or doom. The Queso Fundido: A guilty pleasure, (don't let my internist know) was fun and different. This version was made with Bacalao (Cod), Roasted Tomatoes, Garlic Chips and it's own fired up chili. (More Habanero? They must have cornered the market).The Bar Tender raved about the Heritage Blue Corn obtained from small Mexican heritage villages and grown by heritage farmers of mixed heritage. The tortillas resembled blue Injera. They were ground and made in house and would have given Sean Brock, (cookingdom's advocate for heritage anything) a woody. No matter, they easily held whatever was heaped onto them, and hot ones just kept a comin' as passing servers noticed we were running low. Now, you're ready for some great head, right? In a large fish platter (yup, a fish platter instead of a lamb platter...Bah!!!!) sat a half roasted Lamb's head sticking it's tender tongue out at you in a last gasp of defiance. It was the Stephen King Special, gouged out eyeball, creepy orthodonture, and cheeks hangin' off the bone. It looked like the main course at an American Horror Story dinner party. It's pugnacious jaw looked like something Biblical in a Kevin Sorbo film. So, believe you're gonna love it, and if you have the starch to order it, you will. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Put you ear close to the plate and you might just hear it rasp...\"Go ahead...Eat Me\", and you should. Be advised, this is not a \"first date\" dish. It was gelatinous, fatty, meaty, spicy, and juicy just like the chubby chick in Accounts Payable that winks at you on your way out and you probably should have taken here in the first place. The Head came with pickled onion and cabbage which was buried under the head, and was only revealed when the picked over noggin was flipped. The Slaw was lip burnin', tongue tinglin', throat closin' hot. It made my hair sweat. Man up, you can take it. You just have to find it as it's perfect with whatever you easily yanked off the carcass...in a heritage tortilla. And then there was the long black hair in the Slaw, as black as your ex-wives heart. (The Lamb was a blonde). Hey, its Mexican food, so don't go gettin' all squeamish. Hair happens. The manager came and inspected the extra protein and begged forgiveness and spiffed me dessert. Very classy. Dessert: Ethereal. Tres Leches Cake in a puddle of Strawberry Coulis so light it had to be tethered to the plate. Crema Ice Cream, Market Strawberries and Freeze Dried Strawberries.

I would go back to the bar any time.As to the food, the starters were good, the tamales were great, the tortillas were amazing...then it started to slip a little.

We also had octopus with chorizo and again, could not find any chorizo at all (in defense of the octopus, it was delicious).This is a place that I would happily return to for drinks and apps, but would likely not come back for dinner at the price ($49 for red snapper??!!)."], ["Rachel F.", "Broken Spanish is a once in a lifetime opportunity.Food: I do not regret a single bite. The duck hearts, lamb tamale, oxtail quesadilla, hibiscus tacos, and chile relleno were all flat out fantastic. The menu boasts creative combinations and is executed perfectly by otherworldly cooks. The portions are not shy and left me satisfied and stuffed.Drinks: Just awesome. The cocktail menu is tequila heavy but offers some bourbon and rum options as well. The creativity and flavors make each drink its own dish and worth every penny. The wine list is extensive and the wine locker is a sight to behold.Decor: They've somehow managed to strike a perfect balance between modern and rustic. The place is cozy without being cramped, warm without feeling dated, loaded with metal and glass but not lacking in soul.Staff: Simply wonderful. Our waiter, Robert, was extremely helpful with the daunting task of NOT ordering one of everything. His recommendations paid off in spades and the whole staff kept a watchful eye on our water glasses. We had the opportunity to chat with one of the cooks, Katie, who was cheerful and very informative about the dishes she was preparing. The house manager Brian even stopped by to say hello and check on our experience.

I didn't want to paint her in a bad light, so I worded it delicately and the server and manager were just so understanding.

While it was a brave endeavor, too often the food would miss the mark, and the price point was too high (IMO) for the food there (except for the Barbacoa. Julian Cox is the bomb). Broken Spanish takes a lot of the elements of Rivera, and transforms it into something that feels more traditional and authentic, but at the same time new, and \"elevated\". A lot of the dishes are classic mexican fare (pipian, requeson, tamales) but have been bestowed with some modern flair. To put this in perspective, I think that trying to create a menu of \"elevated\" Mexican food is usually a complete waste of time. Mexican food is a very \"homey\" sort of food. So every time I see a fancy restaurant with mexican food, I usually pass, because the end result is usually some cross between El Cholo and Acapulco. Well, today, I stand corrected. The food is mexican, at it's core, but there is a decidedly modern feel to every dish. And it's fantastic. The atmosphere feels more open and inviting than the sort of steakhouse/speakeasy vibe that Rivera had. Glass panels the open to the outside now surround most of the rooms, often feeling more like somewhere in new york or SF than downtown LA. Service was great, as it should be at this price point. Didn't have a cocktail but they looked great. Wine list also looked fairly comprehensive. Definitely worth a try, and then some, for anyone within Uber-ing distance. Highly recommend.

This was probably one of the best meals I've had in the last year. Although high end Mexican food sounds like an oxymoron, the meal was pretty much perfection. To start:Rebanada- sweet bread with foie butter: put that shit on everything yo! At first I was a little disappointed that the bread wasn't crispy but the minute I took a bite it all made sense. Definitely different than anything I've had and THANK GOD they allowed foie back in our little kale eating hearts. Lamb neck tamale: awesome! I would come back and just get those. 'Twas cornmeal pockets at it's a-game.Duck hearts: surprisingly the least favorite thing we had. Completely shadowed by everything else we ate. I wish I could describe it more but before I could have another taste it was gone.Chile Relleno: what all chile rellenos should aspire to be when they grow up. The filling was amazing and the chili was perfectly cooked. No weird skin problem some rellenos have. The main stuffPollo prensado: just give me a big bowl of these with the tortillas please. I would have licked the bowl of it was socially acceptable. Although I'm pretty sure I did anyways. Had mainly the squishy parts of the chicken but those were my favorite. Didn't have much meat but the flavor was amazing. Shrimp: no special name for this but it was technically a single prawn and so so good. Spicy so beware but the mango salsa that went with it balanced everything out. Chicharoons: just take me now... Perfectly crispy where it needed to be and perfectly perfect everywhere else. It was a pretty hefty piece and the garlic whatever whatever that went with it cut the grease so well. Tortillas: homemade blue corn tortillas used as a vesicle I which to eat every little bit of everything. Warm and fluffy. Dessert:Horchata ice cream: my favorite but you really can't go wrong with anything horchata. It had a bit of salt to it which was nice and cool little rice crispies. Poblano sorbet: WEIRD! My eating mates liked it but... Uh uh. Not in this mouth Strawberry gazpacho: very refreshing and nice after a pretty heavy meal. Anuelita hot chocolate: I don't really know what happened here. I can't really tell but I didn't get much before it was devoured by the others... This place is in an interesting location but it convenient if you're in the area or doing something at LA Live. It has a weird flow to the restaurant with a whole private room in the back. I'm pretty sure I watched a couple guys walk around the place looking for the entrance and never really found it.

They had 20 different flavors.Their Drinks are great and their food is even better. \u00a0My favorites are the smoked mango salsa and sweet. I am really impressed with the food in this restaurant. AMAZING!!!The chef was cordial. He took my order and the food came out quickly than I expected!!My ordered enchiladas were solid and also very filling. The plate came with a side order of rice and beans. It was amazing and solid all the way through. The Tacos pescado we ordered were also solid. It was Packed with the part of a good fish taco.

There's 4 main taco selections - carnitas, pollo, asada, and al pastor. Each at $1.75, but $1 on Tuesdays! They also offer seafood options, but I didn't try any of those. My favorites were the asada and al pastor with al pastor winning me over completely. It definitely had the most flavor to it. I also really enjoyed the tortillas that these tacos were served on! A little thicker than what you usually come across, but it was great because the taco didn't fall apart! The salsa bar: YASS. So many options! I had a hard time choosing! I went with the mango cilantro, onions w/ habanero, and unfortunately I forgot what the last one was called..but it was orange and spicy. They were all really good! Especially the onion mixture. \u00a0A combination of these on top of the tacos and spritz with lime juice made the meal delicious."], ["Yaneisy V.", "This is a cute little restaurant. Relatively clean and friendly staff. Ordered tacos de papa wich came with a small cup of chicken noodle soup. Pretty tasty. Also ordered taxos de asada and one pastor.

I've been eating here every Tuesday for the past month, Each visit i've gotten five tacos (they're only $1 each on Taco Tuesdays). I think I've tried every taco they have to offer. They're all good, but I specifically recommend the chorizo/potato option.I ordered it on a whim when I was feeling adventurous and ended up loving it. It's such a unique blend of flavors and textures that always seems to hit the spot. While the tacos are great, the most fun aspect of this restaurant is their huge selection of homemade sauces. They must have about 20 different sauces to choose from. They really have everything, from basic salsa and salsa verde to avocado/cilantro to chipotle/peach. I use about six different sauces each time I visit. \u00a0I highly recommend Casa La Dona to anyone looking for an affordable and delicious meal. Essentially, I recommend this place to everyone. Only downside is they don't have a bathroom, which can be problematic for someone like me, who uses lots of hot sauces and ends up drinking lots of water.

The salsa bar isn't anything to scoff at, as they have over a dozen different types of salsa to mix and match.

I had chicken tacos and it was seasoned and very flavorful. My new favorite mexican spot downtown."], ["Michael Z.", "I came here when it seemed to be a little bit slower. I got the three tacos platter (asada, al pastor, carnitas), which comes with chips, soup, rice and beans. The rice were decent, but I didn't really care for the beans. I found this to be a bit of an expensive plate (~$10-11) given the amount of food they ended up bringing out. Give that I've heard that the tacos are $1.75 each, I would have much rather have gotten twice as many tacos without any of the extras in retrospect.The tacos were reasonably sized for being cheaper tacos. I thought the asada was pretty great, as well as the al pastor, though the carnitas were a bit forgettable to me. Compared to a place like Guisados, I found the tacos to be just a tiny bit lacking--either a bit larger portions or quality would I think make up the difference here. I ended up scooping up every last part of the rice and beans plus what fell out of my tacos with my chips and wished I was filled up with a little more meat in the end.The salsa bar is extremely well stocked (~18 selections) and has tasting sticks for you to try, which is a huge plus. I personally was a big fan of their spicy pico de gallo and fresh green.The service was also very, very friendly and welcoming, which is sometimes not the case in similar restaurants in the area.I'd love to have a chance to come here on a Tuesday, when they open up their taco selection to other meats and sell them for $1 each, but I can't base my review off that idea without trying it. I imagine that experience would bump them up a star, so hopefully I'll get the chance to update this someday."], ["Jose A.", "The asada is bad, but hey it's bad everywhere. The carnitas is fine. The ceviche, de pescado, to be clear, about which they are not clear, is as bad as it is everywhere else. The worst part is the tatted up girl at the register. She's awful.

Good thing they close at 8 or this would be my dinner most nights coming home from work. Second time eating here and still impressed with the quantity/price ratio.

Flavor was on point. Second time around I got the volcano al pastor based on the recommendation of a friend. This did not disappoint. Thing was loaded with pork and pineapples. Reminded me of the time in Cancun when I ordered tacos from a small shack. Ladies working here are friendly and quick. Both times I got my order to go and loaded up on 2-3 salsas.

I want to dip my chip. Let me do that.The worst part: any restaurant with sit-down service, MUST have a bathroom. Casa La Dona does not.

I believe I came here over 25 years ago before Yelp was around. I didn't have a bad experience then but a lot has changed.I can't say the food was bad, it was decent but not out of this world. I ordered basic green chicken enchiladas and a watermelon drink, Agua de sandia. The drink was delicious, no complaints there..my enchiladas were a little too greasy and were loaded with melting cheese which is not how they should be served if they were truly authentic. I like cotija cheese on mine and I should have asked for it prior. The white rice was okay but not great. Chips were crispy and salsa was okay.Service was not very friendly and entrees were priced too high. I paid 25 dollars for enchiladas and a drink, tip and tax included. I work hard and refuse to pay that much for lunch again..with that said, I'll stick to smaller mom and pop places, skip the fancy decor, garnishments, \u00a0etc. I can get a decent meal for half of what I paid here.

How can they price their items so high in Boyle Heights? \u00a0They are charging $20 - $30 per main entree when there much better dining options in the same price range. \u00a0I listened to a family of six near my table talk about how they have to sacrifice so many things to be able to afford eating at this \"nice\" restaurant.

The shrimp taco was my favorite, it was lightly breaded and fried. The carnitas was good also, its chunks of pork instead of shredded pork. Asada, which is normally my favorite was my least fave of these three tacos. The asada was kinda burnt and overcooked, no bueno. The rice, beans, and chips were great.

For me, this place is almost like a second home. I know the family, I love the food, and I live down the street. I was really bummed out by a few recent visits.In my first review, I mentioned the importance of not raising prices to support expansion. Unfortunately, the prices have gone up... Not astronomically, but enough to warrant concern.I came in one day to get burritos for my co-workers. They mislabeled the burritos and everyone ended up taking a bite out of a burrito they didn't order. 0 for 1.Another day, I ordered a steak burrito for myself and they quoted me 20 minutes. I showed up after 30 minutes (10 minutes to ensure that the food was waiting for me) and they still hadn't fired my order. It took them 40 minutes after all was said and done to get me a single burrito. 0 for 2.I went again a few weeks back to score some tacos and--other than the increased price for a taco combo--the flavors were awesome and the food was ready on time. 1 for 3.If any other place did me like this, I would never return. However, I have been here a number of times before and this was a freak thing. As business has picked up, they need to be able to maintain that quality and timeliness. The entire Anaya family is awesome. All three brothers, their sons... Hard workers and the flavors are on point. They are aggressively expanding their business and while I'm rooting for them, I really hope the cost of the expansion isn't placed on the shoulders of their customers. OVERALL. Great shop, friendly family, some of the best tortilla chips on the planet, tasty food, and they cater, too! Los Anaya is a great option if you're feeling peckish and an even better option if you're downright hungry. Best Mexican food in the area, by far."], ["Linda H.", "the best mexican food and best horchata i've ever had. i am definitely coming only here anytime i want mexican food. i found this place on yelp yesterday and accidentally, i passed by it since it's by my house. so i decided to come in. i wasn't disappointed. you wouldn't be either if you were in the mood for mexican food. thee absolute best. this places good reviews accurately depict how this place is in real life. i wish they had carne asada fries though but i guess i have to go elsewhere for that."], ["Spam-Lunchbo X.", "We came here to fulfill our taco craving and because we've heard great things about this place for a while now. I don't know if we happened to catch them on an off day, but we were thoroughly underwhelmed. We'll let it slide that we came in and placed an order to go and had to wait over 30 minutes for 8 tacos, while people that ordered after us were getting served. The wait would have been justified if the food was amazing. It wasn't and our taco craving was not satisfied.We ordered 6 different types of tacos, hoping to find some gold:Pescado taco - Most reviews were saying this was one of the best fish tacos in LA. This was our favorite of the 6, but definitely not THE best fish taco in LA. The breading was heavy which took away from the flavor if the fish. If you want THE best fish taco, I suggest taking a trip to La Cevicheria. That's how you make a great fish taco.Camarones taco - Not too bad, but again not the best we've had. Same problem with the fish tacos, the breading is too heavy and you can't taste the food. Nopales taco - The nopales itself was a little waxy and lacked seasoning, but was otherwise cooked fine.Lenguas taco - The meat was cooked well enough, but we've had better. The 1 dollar lengua taco at Ruebens Taco trcuk is far superior. Al pastor taco - This one as brutally over cooked. It had similar qualities that we associate with a good piece of beef jerky. Honestly, I couldn't tell you about the seasoning, because it was too dry and flavorless. Worth waiting in line at Tacos Leo down the way.Carnitas taco - Another dry and overcooked meat. It seems very common these days, that getting good carnitas in restaurants is hard to come by. Slow cooked, incredibly juicy and flavorful pork is what we all seek. Sorry, not here.Hot sauce - More flavor and heat in Cholula.On a side note: the horchata and watermelon aguas frescas were good. Only had to be asked 4 times to recieve it, but at least that was worth the wait.To sum up this review; to say that we were unsatisfied with our meal, would be an understatement. For a place with such glowing reviews and $2 dollar tacos, we can honestly say that most roach coach $1 tacos would be better (ie. Rueben's, Tacos Leo). In a city crawling with amazing tacos, this place just doesn't cut it."], ["Hilary S.", "If I could give his place 4.5 stars I would. \u00a0The chicken taco is the absolute bomb!

Overall, the food tasted good the portions were just super tiny to me. And no chips and salsa for the table. For being pretty empty the service was slow too.

The food court was cute and kinda reminded me of Berkeley.Didn't quite know what to order but we decided to share the papadzules and the tacos de cochinita pibil. I got a jamaica and bf got the atol de coco.Papadzules: Wouldn't order again. Not sure if this was an off night but there really was nothing good about this dish. There was barely any hard boiled egg in each tortilla. The egg seemed super over cooked and really chewy or maybe it was refrigerated? not sure. The tortillas were super dry and I could barely cut them with my fork.The pumpkin seed sauce was also not very good...I love pumpkin seed salsa and was expecting it to taste somewhat similar. This sauce tasted more like the white shell of the pumpkin seed than the seed itself. Tasted like microwaved tortillas with sauce thrown on top. Didn't really want to eat anymore of it after the 1st or 2nd bite but we did pay for it so we doused it with their habanero sauce and ate most of it. Tacos de cochinita pibil: Again the tortillas were super dry like they had been microwaved. The cochinita pibil itself was good. Tasted like carnitas with some brown sugar added to it. Portion wise there was probably about 2 tablespoons of meat if that. Also one taco had maybe 4 big chunks of pure fat...so there went a 1/4 of my taco meat. Jamaica: One of the better ones I've had....not too sweet.Atol de coco: It was yummy and my bf loved it.... but just tasted like warm coconut milk like the kind you use in Thai cooking.I do want to give this place another chance and will.

Poc Chuc: 2 tacos with pork shoulder, avocado, black bean, roasted tomato and onion (gotta try)4. Pollo asada: I actually liked this dish more than the pork because the chicken was juicy (and you can smell/taste the mesquite charcoal).

We each got just a regular agave marg and it was pretty good...didn't taste too strong for my liking.

One of the servers saw us sit down and said she would be able to serve us from the table so that we wouldn't have to get in line. It was nice. The table was incredibly small for 3 people so we were pretty cramped. We ordered chips with salsa and guacamole for the table and I ordered the Abuelita's Enchiladas with mole verde. The enchiladas aren't your typical rolled enchiladas, they were stacked in one round circle. It came with a zucchini/corn side dish and Spanish rice. I found the enchiladas to be really dense (felt like I was eating a stack of 10 tortillas). It didn't really taste all that great either...I've definitely had more flavorful enchiladas in my life. I ended up only eating 1/3 of it since it was sooo filling. The service is subpar....one of the servers spilled all over the gentleman sitting next to us and barely apologized to him, which I found to be unacceptable.

There are booths that are reserved for parties 3 or more so nab one while you can.After looking over the menu, my gf and I decided to get their version of a carne asada burrito \"wet\" style and an order of their take of carne asada fries as well. The good thing about not having a server is that you can get everything yourself. Need more water? Head over and grab a big bottle yourself! Need more plates/utensils? No problem! Get as many as you desire. Need to go boxes? It's right around the corner. You see where I am going with this, everything is just so much more convenient when you can just get up and get it yourself without having to rely on someone to get it for you, which I find nice. The food is kinda pricey for what it is. I always considered Mexican food as cheap \"street food\" since pretty much it revolves around choice of meat, rice, salsa, beans. Basic foods that do not have high costs and can be purchased at large quantities for cheap, but I guess for a location like Eagle Rock they have to charge more than usual for it. Price aside, I think that this place is pretty good for what it is. The portions are pretty good, the burrito was more than enough for 2 people, and with the fries on the side it was a perfect way to fulfill my craving for Mexican food.

There is no wrath greater than from strangers w/ empty stomachs. \u00a0Once you order & pay, they give you a stainless steel rod w/ a number card so they can bring the food to where you have claimed a seat. \u00a01) \u00a0Taco Asada: \u00a0beef seemed marinated in a reddish tomato/chipotle/garlic sauce so that when the beef was grilled, it retained a moist, soft texture unlike a lot of Carne Asadas that come out being over cooked & extremely dry & hard in texture. \u00a0Diced onions, microgreens, cilantro along w/ a red salsa which also tasted of chipotle, tomato, garlic were the garnishes. \u00a02) \u00a0Taco de Confit de Carnard: \u00a0Confit in French cooking means cooked in its own juices or fat so the duck meat in this case is cooked in its own fat. \u00a0Meat is shredded, & dressed w/ pickled red onion slices reminiscent of the Yucatan style & thinly sliced smooth, unctuous aguacate/avocado. \u00a0Squeeze of green lime provided a gastrique to counter some of the oiliness. \u00a0The duck is meaty, subtle in seasonings so that the nuanced duck flavor comes through.3) \u00a0Vampiro de Taco: is of fried duck skin, guacamole, Pico de Gallo/chopped up tomato, chiles, onions, micro cilantro, Cotija/aged dry cheese, Salsa Verde/tomatillo, chile, onion, garlic. \u00a0Tortilla is closer to a pancake that is thick, moist, soft, pillowy w/ 3 cheeses infused in. \u00a0The complex flavours all marry well & swing toward a more funky, fermented, dairy flavor w/ the fried duck skin acting as the rich, fatty foil. \u00a0However, the fried duck skin retained a strong \"old oil\" smell & taste that ruined this complex taco. \u00a04) Aquachile de Camarones: \u00a0Julienned crunchy Jicama, diced red onions, cool sliced cucumbers, sliced aguacate, ultra thin rings of Serrano chiles, cilantro microgreen, about 6 whole medium shrimps slightly seared, but still raw in the style that Japanese chefs would call Tataki. There is a complex watery salsa that has a strong scent of lime juice, serrano chile infusion, possibly a touch of medicinal, bitter Epazote & Oregano that adds an herbal, oily, smoky funk. \u00a0Semi-raw shrimp was velvety, soft, moist, & since there were so few shrimps, I decided to chop up the shrimp into fine pieces & tossed them in the julienned vegetables for more equal distribution. \u00a0Lady Isobel L. & I thought the Aguachile de Camarones was the best \u00a0dish chosen. \u00a0Lime/serrano salsa w/ its complex mixture of herbs & seasonings awakened the refreshing vegetables & shrimp as well as adding citrus gastrique & earthy herbals tastes. The chile heat was toned down for us \"gringos\". Purple corn totopos/corn chips are provided. \u00a01-4a) \u00a0Ordered the wine flight where you can choose 3 wines from their selection. \u00a0However, the Chenin Blanc & Petite Syrah by LA Cetto were flabby & unbalanced in terms of sugars, tannins, acidity. \u00a0Merlot by Bodegas Santo Tomas was better, but still rather lackluster compared to a better wine like El Grenache also from Baja California del Norte in the Valle de Guadalupe as served at the incomparable Babita Mexicuisine. \u00a05) \u00a0Hot Cacao: Hot chocolate from Oaxaca w/ scalded milk, sliced almonds, powdered canela/cinnamon. \u00a0I stirred all the ingredients together to incorporate all the flavours. The mellow chocolate, & canela made the scalded milk take on a more thick, viscous quality. Nice alternative to dessert. \u00a0 \u00a0 Nino appeared to ask us if we needed any further assistance. \u00a0He's the one who made our excellent Hot Cacao. \u00a0He told us a little bit about the history of Cacao Mexicatessen. \u00a0Initially it was to be a Yogurt joint until another yogurt place was set up before Cacao did so a new concept restaurant scheme was developed. Nino's sister is also a chef at Cacao. \u00a0We also talked about the food at Cacao, & Nino also elaborated on the production of Oaxacan chocolate & pointed to a bunch of brown chocolate pods hanging from the ceiling near the order counter. \u00a0After all, the origin of chocolate is Mexico. \u00a0 Generally, the food at Cacao Mexicatessen is well executed w/ a few faux pas such as the wines & the fried duck skin, but the price & the quality of ingredients \u00a0are reasonable. \u00a0Nino was charming, helpful, & informative which upped it to the next star. \u00a04- Yelp stars for a pleasant Wednesday evening."], ["Val R.", "Micheladas were delicious!

He got a torta and I got the carne asada special from the lunch specials as our entrees, and the corn as an appetizer. We also took home some guacamole and chips and the chile apple. All I have to say is that I am extremely disappointed. The service was slow even during a time where the place was pretty empty. The food was OK, edible but not amazing. The carne asada meat was the problem. The corn on the other hand was PHENOMENAL. The guacamole, once again very WHATEVER. I expected more from the place but I guess I have to test out other menu options before I make my final decision. My tip for now, do NOT get the carne asada.

When I asked the friendly cashier if I could purchase one, he handed me the artist's business card (I now own a set of 4 mugs)I think I prefer the breakfast to their regular menu, but I am partial to their mole fries.

I like the sound of that. THE AMBIANCE: CaCao looks like a small cafe from the street but it is actually a decent size inside. Right when I walked in I noticed wood and that there were little signs and colorful writing everywhere. There are some black belts like the ones you see at the movie theaters where patrons start forming a line to order. The menus are at one (1) of the two (2) cash registers in wooden tray boxes. I really liked the decor of the place. Mexican meets cabin meets cute. There is a good amount of inside seating, seat yourself-style, in this cozy place and there are also tables and a bar top outside on their front patio. THE FOOD: I went with an \"Ensenada fish taco\" ($3.50) and a \"Pollo Asado Sope\" ($5.50). The fish taco at CaCao is the fish taco with the closest batter profile to real Ensenada fish tacos that I have tried in LA. The difference I saw, however, between the CaCao fish taco and the real Ensenada fish tacos is that the CaCao fish taco has a burnt oil after taste. It had that \"it's time to change the oil/it's starting to taste charred\" taste. The tortilla de maiz was on point and the fish taco overall is a WAY better fish taco than Ricky's fish tacos in Los Feliz/Silverlake. I am still flabbergasted as to how people write that Ricky's fish tacos are the best fish tacos in LA! Dios mio ... No way, mi amigo. If the CaCao fish taco hadn't had that burnt oil aftertaste I would think it was the most authentic/best fish taco I have tried in LA so far. The sope is not the best sope you have tried because that would be your grandmother's sope but let me be fair. The masa was really good. I was happy that it had a slight crunch and semi soft middle, as sope masa texture is supposed to be. The chicken was soft, cubed, and well-seasoned. The toppings were fresh. Also, it's pretty big and filling. I enjoyed it. I tried a watermelon agua fresca and it was good. There are other agua fresca flavors to try. THE TIPS:There is parking in the back of the restaurant but there is a mean dip when you exit back onto Colorado. I saw an older woman making handmade tortillas and it made me feel warm inside :) The menu said $3.50 for the fish taco and my bill said $3.75 ... Hmmm.. I only asked for the salsa on the side. Might it be a \"fried\" charge of 25 cents?"], ["Pauline G.", "The only downside of this place is the \"deli\" aspect.I absolutely love their food: shrimp sope, sea urchin chile guero taco, the potato taco with a generous helping of shredded cheese, mole fries, and tamarindo candy apple-- all fantastic.

In a perfect world you'd be able to seat yourself and have staff provide you a menu and take your order. They have very friendly staff walk around and check in with diners to make sure everything is enjoyable. The younger kids stationed at the cash register is what frustrates me about this place. Half of the time they are slow to take orders due to chatting with other staff- a teen that rather finish their conversation than help a guest and lacks a welcoming tone when she does ask what you want to order. Not appreciated.But when you do get your food- it's heavenly."], ["Marissa B.", "Went here this evening and I have to say, I was impressed!

And for good reason, they put a lot of work into their creations and u can tell by the amazing flavor profiles and many options. Also, handmade tortillas always get brownie points in my book. Oh! I also got a chorizo quesadilla. Chorizo and cheese are very oily on their own and together it was a greasy mess. Okay flavor but not worth the 4 cups of oil I felt I showered in after. Even though I didn't care for a couple of my tacos it's still a five star bc lets be real, it's rare you'll love absolutely everything on a menu. What I did like, I loved. Check it out!"], ["Luke F.", "Asked for no onions at least 3 times. Made it real clear I was allergic. Girl at counter said she'd make sure. Boom! Of course, onions. Took it back in, lady got rude. I asked for money back. No one ever apologized. I hate this place and I hear such good things. I should have eaten the meal, got sick, and sued them. DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU HAVE DIETARY NEEDS!!! NO ONE PAYS ATTENTION!!!"], ["Neelam P.", "3 1/2 *My husband and I LOVED the cheese quesadillas which were totally different than the ones we find back in NYC. \u00a0The cheese was perfectly grilled and salty...yum!We sampled the following tacos: mushroom (a little bland), veggie (hubbie's fav), bean and cheese (just ok), fish (a little bland). \u00a0We were big fans of the horchata.Service was friendly and seating in the back was cute."], ["Areli H.", "Guisados is amazing! For first-timers I highly recommend the platter.Also, if you don't eat spicy let them know and they can help you customize. My favorite is the fish taco, they grill the fish instead of frying. Parking can be tricky, best parking advice is look for street parking on Sunset Blvd and be sure to check the parking regulation sign. Great place to take out of town visitors to try a taste of L.A."], ["Alejandra C.", "This place is amazing I highly recommend it I literally fell in love with the tacos even though they were a little too spicy for me lol the service in there is great you guys should totally try this place"]], "Guisados DTLA": [["John T.", "I couldn't have been happier when I was more than drunker than usual. But such are the things that happen when your unranked Trojans finally win a home game against #3 Utah. Super flavor, super price, super place. I don't know whether to be surprised or not that they have 10+ locations. Surprised that the quality is not compromised after having more than 2 restaurants. Not surprised that they have 10 or more locations because the food is that DAMN GOOD. But enough, the 3PS system is here: 1. Product: super tasties. handmade tortilla -- gluten free for all you super pickies out there! Try the quesadilla con choriso and tinga de pollo (nice spice to it). Holy goodness2. Place: convenient and relaxed. Good late night spot. 3. People: typical young DTLA hipster-inspired crowd. 4. Service: friendly. This is a quick serve restaurant so order at the counter, sit down and enjoy an horchata and before you know it, your food is there, you'll finish it, forgot you ate, and go straight back to the counter."], ["Young Kyung K.", "I hate to use this phrase but yes, the overly hyped taco joint was finally my destination for dinner after a wonderful afternoon at the Broad museum. I see this place tagged, pictured and mentioned in more than enough social media outlets that I thought I tried it. But FINALLY I gave it a go! It's like chipotle but ...authentic HAAHAHA you see the lady behind the glass window prepare and cook the corn tortilla when she get the order and the few other staff prepare the fillings inside. My friend ordered the sampler which consists of 6 mini tacos for a little over 7 dollars, that's a steal! My fatness thought I'd get 3 regular tacos... (the gluttony) I ordered the two beef (spicy and bistec) and fish, to my surprise was NOT fried. The pictures and the ideas of this place definitely ruled over my head and offered me high expectations. There is nothing more disappointing than yourself not being able to taste the expected. To me the meats all basically tasted the same... the sauce on all the meats were very salty and had very little differentiation. I expected the meats to be very savory but they were not. They definitely didn't lack in flavor... which was the sauce they were cooked in. Although I have to admit the tortilla was impeccable. The mini tacos were definitely my size but since I decided to order regular taco orders I had to opt for the bigger sized ones... (the mini tacos are so cute!!!) The fish taco was good and the fish not being fried gives a plus for the population of LA residents that are watching their figure ahaaha!I'd definitely come back if I'm around the area. I'd definitely get their melon agua fresca it was over the top amazingly delicious haha!!"], ["Leona S.", "Horchata is the best here. Best horchata in LA. Creamy, cinamon-y, tasty. Get it. The taco sampler platter. Did they raise their prices? Slightly. Now, for small tiny tacos it's $7.25, not sure about the other locations. The tacos sizes, as other Yelpers have mentioned, are tiny. Like way tinier than I remember. Or maybe the Echo Park/Boyle Heights locations are different. They're literally bite size, which I guess is why it's called the sampler, but still cmon now. $1.20 each for these things, I can get a real taco. Meat of course is deliciously stewed. We always get the two beef tacos (Steak Picado and Bistek in Salsa Roja) both which are not spicy.Great location right on Main St. though a bit small. Parking is always an issue in DTLA. Very much hipster. Go to the original location in Boyle Heights for appreciation of how this all got started."], ["Mitzi E.", "It's hype season here. Sometimes you just want an old fashion quesadilla and taco. Not all this shenanigans."], ["April P.", "I happened to be in the area, so my sister and I decided to give it a try. It's located at a newer looking plaza called the Arcade. We decided to share the sampler. The food was delivered to our table, and we were given an explanation of each taco. The sampler size taco is tiny, but can be filling for one person. The tacos that stood out were both the steak tacos. They were flavored and cooked nicely. The tortillas were also so good. It tasted handmade and fresh. I will definitely be back for more!"], ["Todd N.", "Came here to meet a fellow Trojan, and he recommended this place. \u00a0I've never been here before but the good reviews comforted me.It's a pretty casual taco place and is definitely something that's quick, easy, and in and out. \u00a0They have a great 6 taco sampler! I highly recommend it as you can get a selection of everything! I don't exactly remember what I ordered, but I believe my photo shows it. \u00a0You get to select the meats you wanted and I remember I got all except for chicken. \u00a0They even hand make the tortilla, so that in itself is worth trying! The size of the tacos are quite small, so don't come here thinking you'll be too full!"], ["Ian R.", "So I'm on the fence about these guys. The tortilla they use is on point; really high quality stuff. Anything you get with the chorizo will be real good. However, I've had the sampler and the quesadilla and while the sampler was good it wasn't great. The quesadilla wasn't good so pass on that guy altogether.I can quite put my finger on what's bothering me about this place but everything (but the chorizo) tasted 6.5/10... My best guess is they're trying too hard to make it gourmet/hipstery that they sorta missed out on the basics. Idk. Also, I still don't know what half the things on the menu are which is cause I don't speak Spanish but that's probably more on me than on them."], ["Sara H.", "Guisado's tortillas are hands down one of THE best tortillas I've ever had in my life! To think that I'm such a fan of flour tortillas too, maaaan, what was I thinking?! (Don't judge me, please! Lol) The amazing part about their tortilla is that it's thick enough to hold all the toppings and absorb sauce from the said toppings but then it also has the right amount of chewiness and since it's made in-house, it's always fresh to the bite! The boyfriend went with the sampler while I chose the Tinga Pollo, Chicharonnes and Steak Picado. He had all three as well as a bunch of others but can I please take a minute to talk about the Tinga Pollo? DAT TINGA POLLO IS THE BOMB. Between the right amount of spice and the flavors you get from the chorizo and chipotle. It was seriously mind blowing. The Chicharonnes was a tad disappointing since I expected the pork bits to be too soggy. Steak Picado was good too but deep inside my heart I wish I tried the salsa roja instead. Not going to beat myself up over it though since Guisado's could expect another visit from me. Besides, they're in a prime location being that they're right beside Gelateria Uli which is pretty much the BEST gelato spot in Downtown!"], ["Clark W.", "Such a great addition to the neighborhood. \u00a0Reasonably priced and delicious food!Great job Guisados!"], ["Jen M.", "Blah, blah... not authentic, blah blah... SO WHAT!!The braised meat idea is genius and so flavorful without a bunch of toppings, hands down just great tacos no matter other comparisons. I usually go the WeHo location, but I've been to this one on some lunch breaks and it's the same vibe & taste... so works for me! I've done the sampler once, but now I know my favorites (mole poblano, tinga de pollo, bistek en salsa roja)... was not a fan of the chicharron, has a weird texture. Someone above said small appetite get 2 tacos, normal appetite get around 3... I think that's a bit much... I would say normal lunch would be 2 tacos, 3 if you're really hungry... I don't think I could manage 4, they're very dense & filling!The staff is always really friendly and the menu is easy to order from... well laid out.The only down side for me for this location is the outdoor seating... a lot of time that arcade has some pet & other smells if you catch my drift... not Guisados fault, but something to note if you're going to sit on the patio.I hope this location gets beer & wine like the WeHo location at some point!"], ["Jane L.", "We came here after our trip to the Grand Central Market. We wanted a quick snack so we thought we could try a few tacos to hold us over until dinner time. It's in a little hidden location that has an outdoor and indoor seating area. We came here on a Saturday afternoon and it was relatively empty. There were 2 people working the cash register, but they made us wait while they chatted with the customer before us. I thought it was annoying because they saw us wanting to order but they kept chatting away. The finally took our order and we decided on the taco sampler. We tried 2 chicken, 2 beef, 1 pork, and 1 veggie. The total was about $7. We took our seat and the food came out relatively quickly. The guy who dropped off our food told us which tacos were which. We started on the chicken. I have to say that the taco was not good at all. The chicken was weirdly watery, mushy, and dripping with sauce. Each of the tacos had avocado on it and it kept falling off my taco because the meat was so watery. I tried a bite of the beef, which was a little less mushy, but still too saucy. I didn't try the veggie or the pork because by this time, I did not want to try anything else. My friend ended up only eating a bite of the pork and giving up eating the rest. I did like the handmade tortillas, which was a little thicker than most tortillas, but I can taste the freshness. But, even with the fresh tortilla, I am definitely not coming back here."], ["Paul N.", "WOW. Hands down the best Mexican food I've ever had. I really really enjoy Mexican food and have come accustomed to it, however I immediately had an upset stomach as soon as I finished my pork taco with chiles. I highly suggest having pepto at hand just incase you react the same way. Otherwise, the service was PHENOMENAL. Food was as delicious and fatty as I could hope for. Super glad I walked in when I did. Very satisfied as a whole. Highly recommended!"], ["Lainy C.", "I first tried Guisados years ago in the Boyle Heights location. The Spring arcade is a much hipper and accessible location but it loses a lot of the personality and warmth of the original spot. Although I like their variety, there are definitely some that are more interesting than others. I have only ever ordered the sampler here because I can never decide what to get. Last week we shared two samples, sampling almost the whole menu. I will say that some of the vegetarian ones are pretty boring - the beans with only a sprinkle of cheese and the mushroom are lacking in the flavor department. The braised meats are more interesting. Also, their spicy options are definitely not kidding around! As fun as it is to get the sampler, I still kinda prefer my favorite taco truck when I'm craving a taco."], ["Vickie S.", "4 stars for their homemade tortillas. This location only has braised meats so it starts to taste redundant with the 6 mini taco sampler. The mini tacos are the size of the bottom of a water bottle so bite-sized. I'd skip this and order two regular sized tacos that you actually want, which comes out to be the same quantity and better price. Tortillas are amazing and actually good on its own!Beware of the habanero sauce. It's super spicy and my ears were burning when I took put a generous quantity on my taco."], ["Candace L.", "So instead of getting a 'sampler' we had the guy give us recommendations.Honestly, some of them were NOT that memorable.. BUT they were all very tasty.. I just can't remember which I liked the best.The star...COCHINITA PIBIL! Holy moly this is hot. I knew going into it, with the cashier warning us, that it was going to be spicy. But I figured I eat pretty spicy anyways so whatever, right? The default level is a 3.. you can choose between 1-10. Our first visit we got an 8... and holy moly my mouth was on fire after the first bite. You think to yourself \"this isn't bad at all..\" but this will SLOWLY CREEP UP and set you ablazeeee. But it was so tasty and so delicious. The flavor of the pork was definitely my favorite! It was really spicy though and I had to go on over to the gelato place next door to cool off.You also have to try their Quesadilla con Chorizo! So good!

My favorites were Mole, Chile verde, and chorizo. The tinga tacos I've had better elsewhere and cochinita pibil is not the style I'm used to. But overall it was good and I was satisfied. Oh!

Before leaving home I made it a quest to eat some good tacos. I trusted Yelp and found this spot. There was a small line but it was worth it. The service was exceptional, they explained everything and followed up even using my name after getting my food. Very friendly service and some delicious tacos."], ["Fran B.", "I fucking love tacos. As far as Mexican food goes, tacos are probably my fave. Of course I'm talkin about those authentic Mexican tacos, which you can find at little hole in the walls, taco trucks, or just a random street corner lol. Not dem Taco Bells crunchy tacos. But I don't mind those... lolAnyway, Guisados' tacos are a little different, and a couple of my Mexican friends say it's not really authentic, but they think it's bomb anyway. I agree. Food doesn't have to be authentic to be good. Their tacos are definitely unlike any tacos I've had before. First off, their corn tortillas are different. They're a little... bready? They're soft, fluffy, and chewy! I actually really love that texture. BUT...... and I'm probably alone in this, I still prefer regular corn tortillas for my tacos lol. I really do like their tortillas though. Not to mention they make them super fresh (I literally seent it with my own eyeballs).So they have a variety of meats and seafood and veggies to choose from, and they have a sampler plate you can order! It comes with 6 mini tacos of your choosing (meats or veggies only, seafood you can only get regular size). Personally, this was a good size for me. I was like pretty full (but still got room for dessert) off one sampler (which is probably better than food-coma-full anyway), but if I were hungrier maybe I would've ordered an extra taco or something. If it's your first time I definitely suggest this so you can try 6 different flavors.All of their meats are braised, which makes them extra juicy so you never have to worry about having dry tacos here. That's the other big difference from regz tacos vs Guisados. Check out the online menu from their website for detailed descriptions. Some of the tacos include beans so I asked the cashier to have no beans on any of mine. Just a personal pref.What I got:Steak PicadoBistek en Salsa RojaTinga de PolloChicharronChorizoCochinita PibilMY #1 FAVE WAS CHICHARRON! That doesn't surprise me one bit seeing as my fave taco in the world is the chicharron taco from El Taquito Mexicano Truck (shout out to my fave taco truck). So flavorful and so good! It was only mildly spicy, but that's ok. It had LOTS of flavor. My second fave was the tinga de pollo, which was a bit spicy also and equally flavorful.The other tacos.. hm. They were all tasty, but I didn't feel like the rest stood out too much other than the 2 I just mentioned. I think the cochinita was my least favorite. It had a sweetness to it, which is fine since it's also spicy.. but meh. Not a big fan of the sweetness.I think next time I would order the chicharron and tinga de pollo in regular size, and maybe some other ones. Honestly though, they were all good and different. So you just gotta figure out what you like!Welp... I still prefer regular tacos lol but this was definitely good. Also their melon/cantaloupe aguas frescazzzzzzzz omg so refreshing! Also your food comes out fast. Just hope that line isn't too long!"]]}
