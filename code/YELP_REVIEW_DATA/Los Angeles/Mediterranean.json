It's a lot of food for the money and you could honestly split it with someone.I returned a week ago to have breakfast here. The portions for breakfast are just as big. I believe I ordered a chicken sausage scramble. It was a normal breakfast scramble but every bit of tasty. The coffee here was really good and our server definitely kept my cup full.

Served with Basmati Rice or Bulgur Wheat Pilaf, Skewered with Grilled Vegetables and Choice of Caesar, Mediterranean Greek or Romaine Avocado Salad. I got the wheat pilaf which was good but the basmati rice is better with this dish. I also chose the Mediterranean salad. The salad was good and the balsamic dressing was simple but great.

I actually prefered this a bit more over the chicken. Although the meat could have been a bit warmer the spices and flavors were good. I recommend getting the basmati rice. Portions are pretty big so you can either share it or take the rest to go. I would try avoiding the brunch rush because it seems out meat was not as warm as it should have been. And my gf's vegetables did not really come grilled and the onions were pretty raw. Service was nice.

The fish is expertly prepared and I love the squishy grilled foccacia bread it's on. SUPER GOOD.+ Mediterranean Salad: Crunchy, fresh, and dressed perfectly. They are generous with the sprinkle of feta cheese, and a litttttlleee tooooo generous with the raw red onions. I think a little less onion would make this salad perfect. Definitely recommend this as a side salad to your entree. And also, I recommend a breath mint after. + Lentil Soup: Their lentil soup is really hearty and filling. Perfect to accompany a salad, but a little too much to go with a sandwich. I really loved the soup though. The lentils were soft and the broth tasted like home-cooking."], ["Russ C.", "We had a working lunch meeting, 6 chicken Shish Kebob and 2 beef, all with rice and Ceasar salads.

The meat was cooked right but it was a bit dry; I'm not sure if this is how they normally serve this dish but when I order the chicken kebab the meat is juicy and the consistency of the chicken is perfect. On this dish however, I felt like the meat was dry and hard to chew on; fillet mignon should never be this dry. As for the vegetables that come with the meat I felt like there was a lot less of them and they were smaller. The white basmati rice was noticeably undercooked to the point where it was unpleasant to eat and it was greasy as if it had been fried, poorly. Now this I know they messed up because normally the rice is always very nicely cooked and it's not this greasy, if I remember right normally the rice feels like it's steamed. For my side salad I got the romaine avocado and the salad was good; they used fresh vegetables and the consistency of the salad was good with all equally chopped vegetables but they were not julienne cuts this time so it was hard to eat with my fork. I also noticed they put a lot less avocado this time it was ridiculous you might as well not put any in there just call it a romaine salad and exclude the avocado. I used to like this restaurant a lot but now it just feels like there's been bad changes in the kitchen. They're taking a more \"efficient\" corporate approach and it makes you feel like they didn't put any thought into their food. I was very disappointed today the staff seemed less friendly I just don't understand. Did they change ownership? What happened? I might come back just because their chicken kebabs are still good but if they mess that up too then I won't know where to go for good Mediterranean food around the area."], ["Marisa Y.", "You are in for a treat if you try their baganooj! It is this incredible mix of eggplant, yogurt & olive oil that is a pure delight for the taste buds. I was there on a rather hot day, so I got the babaganooj cold, which was amazing with the warm pita. I've also had it warm and it's fantastic both ways. If you're in the mood for a grilled sandwich, you cannot go wrong with the chicken pesto. It is my favorite sandwich, but I've also had the turkey and gorgonzola which is very good. I've had a bite of the chicken roasted pepper as well - the peppers are on point! I don't love goat cheese, but if you do I recommend that sandwich. As far as entrees go, the charbroiled chicken shish kabob is their classic. The grilled chicken, tomatoes & onions are wonderful (and healthy!) The entrees come with a choice of rice pilaf or basmati rice. I have only ever tried their basmati, which is amazing so I cannot bring myself to change to the pilaf, although I am sure it would also be superb. The mousaka is also veryyyyy good. It will appear like ground beef, but the meat is higher quality. It comes with pita & hummus as well as wonderful Tatziki sauce. Yum! I've also had the koobideh kabob, which I highly recommend. Entrees also come with your choice of 3 salads. I've tried the Mediterranean Greek salad & the Romaine Avocado salad (the last option is Cesar). Both are very good.Also, on this particularly hot day, I had their chilled chardonnay. It was crisp and delightful, and they kept the bottle on ice to keep it cold - how nice!To sum it up, you cannot go wrong. I have not had one item that I was not absolutely crazy about.

Review based on 1 visit, but going back very soon!:: FoodStated as Mediterranean Tapas style on Yelp. Portions are bigger than traditional tapas that I have had. Server recommended 2-3 items per person. I think 2 are sufficient, unless you have a larger appetite. Mine is smaller by American standards. However, I don't peck like a bird, I do eat a decent meal.The Dips come with a homemade pita style bread. Kind of like a good Indian Naan in texture. Delivered in a paper bag to keep it warm.I had two items: 1) the Cucumber & Yoghurt dip, which had 2 thin slices of cucumber on top. I really though it would be more of a cucumber dish for me greens lol, but it was fantastic (most likely much better than I envisioned).Item 2) the Roast Lamb.. Excellent! Really really good. I was going to opt for falafel, but it was a toss up and my server recommended the lamb. Glad I trusted her.:: DrinksOrdered the Vineburry but swapped out the Absolut vodka for gin (tanq 10) - really good. Presentation was excellent. Had two \u00a0even though just a tad sweet for my taste \u00a0..too good.:: AtmosphereLoved it. Darker lighting, but not in a cave. A big modern open space, with cool decor, and lots of people enjoying their night. I was a bit jealous of the ones sitting at the high and longer wood tables.. but my part was rather small for that. Next time!For a date.. Yes, excellent. However, I noticed that part of the room had these big armchair type seats that looked a bit awkward to eat from, since you would have to perch to stay present at the table. Never a fan, but making a judgment from a distance. Also, it's better to sit next to each other than opposite, so try and get a table for 4 just for 2. It's more intimate that way. A little piece of advice ;):: Service & StaffTop notch. Hostesses (yes there were 2) were super friendly with a fun positive attitude, and professional.Server.. She was awesome, even though it was busy, and she was obviously a little stretched. Her recommendations were well received, and without her the order would have been far too much food.:: Value / CostTough call on this one. It is expensive, but not pretentiously so. I found it a good value except for the drinks that seemed a bit steep. My order of 2 cocktails and 2 items was just shy of $71.I have paid far more, and considerably less. Was it worth it? Hands down yes! Would rather a great food and experience for $$$ than a greasy big place for a bargain price.

There were 8 of us, and we waited about 30+ mins after our reservation time to be seated. In the meantime, we ordered drinks at the bar. A few of us ordered espresso martinis (which is important because it is relevant to our experience later on).Anyways, Cleo was super understaffed. Everything just took forever. Everything here is tapas style, so we ordered a bunch of things. I think we ordered about 12 items, of which we only received 8. We even got a order of something we never ordered. Trying to order & receive our drinks was crazy, because it just took forever. Our server was great, but he was just too busy. It's definitely not the server's fault that the restaurant chooses to understaff the restaurant, especially on a weekend evening.At one point, another server brought us our drinks we ordered about 40 mins earlier. She brought us a drink that she claimed was an espresso martini. We told her that it was a mocha martini, which we didn't order. She then argued with us that it was indeed an espresso. Another girl & I already had espresso martinis, so we showed her that this is what it looks like. That server continued to say it was an espresso martini. One of our other girlfriends had a mocha martini and showed her. For some reason, this server still insisted she was correct that the drink was an espresso martini. She started giving us an attitude, and she left. We were kind of shocked and laughed in disbelief (See the photo I posted of a mocha vs espresso martini at Cleo). When our original server came by, we told him what happened...and he put in orders for espresso martinis (which we all needed by this time because we had all finished our drinks).All in all, the food was pretty good. Our server was nice, and the drinks were good too. Too bad for the slow service and the weird girl server we encountered during the night. I doubt I'll be back here.

I waited almost an hour for my table on my birthday and they charged me for my birthday dessert. Here is my story:I wanted to celebrate my birthday somewhere nice this year so I made a reservation a month in advance for a 7pm dinner on Saturday, November 14. Since it was my first time dining at Cleo, the helpful person on the phone even suggested that I sit in the main dining room (mainly for the atmosphere) for an ultimate dining experience.The week of the dinner, I called to confirm the reservation to make sure that my table is inside the main dining room and NOT at Cleopatra's Table Under The Stairs. The reservation was confirmed.On November 14...7pm - All 11 people in my party had arrived and were ready to eat. We waited about 5 minutes until the host finally led us to our table. She points us to the direction of table under the stairs. I mentioned that this is not what I had requested and that I would like to be seated inside as planned. She agreed and said she will get a table ready for us.7:10 pm - 10 minutes later, the same hostess approaches me and says she's just getting the table ready now.7:30pm - It has now been 30 minutes past our reserved time and we are still waiting for our table. My friends go up to the podium to ask the hosts how much longer we have to wait for our table. All 3 hosts at the front were clueless and didn't seem to be prepping any sort of arrangement for us. One chimes in and says \"the group at your table has a show at the Pantages at 8 so they should be leaving soon.\"7:45pm - I go up to the podium and ask for the manager. I'm sure she already knew this but I reiterated how I have been waiting for 45 minutes already. She responds with \"Well, we tried to sit you in there (pointing at the table under the stairs) but you didn't like it.\" I had to explain to her that it was Cleo who suggested I don't sit there. And it was Cleo who confirmed I am not sitting there. But now I am stuck here in the lobby feeling like I never had a reservation to begin with. She replied \"It's your birthday, right? Happy birthday. We're going to get you seated as soon as possible.\" Her assurance still left me without a solid answer. Right before 8pm, a host finally took us to our table. \u00a0The meal was good and the food service was good. But I realized that not once did the manager approach us to check if everything is going well. Also, am I crazy for thinking this? But I would expect any reputable restaurant to throw in a few appetizers in there for the inconvenience of the one hour wait. But not only did we not receive anything on the house, they even charged me for the birthday dessert that they served.It was all aggravating, frustrating, and disappointing at the same time. I would give Cleo's customer service negative stars if I could."], ["Ani P.", "This is mainly a review of the awful service and not a representation of the fantastic food. It's taken me a while to write this review but after someone suggested we go there next weekend, I remembered the rage I felt the last time I was there and had to say a big \"NO\" and share this story. My friends were appalled! I've been a huge SBE fan for years; have dined at every one of their restaurants in LA and frequent their hotel bars quite often. I've had nothing but excellent service and food in every single one of them until I decided to try out Cleo. I booked a table for 3 to celebrate my mother's 70th birthday a week in advance.We showed up there on a Friday night and the place was packed (to be expected). We were there right on time as I walked up to the counter to check in and was told \"we are getting your table ready, it'll be a few minutes\". 20 minutes later, there is still no word so I approach the hostess again, she says \"well people are paying and are about to leave so it'll only be a few more minutes\". At 40 minutes of wait, I am wondering why they aren't being honest so I walk up to them again and ask and this time they have a major attitude about it as if I am inconveniencing THEM! The nerve! My 70+ years old parents have been on their feet for 40 minutes waiting for a table! at 50 minutes of wait, the hostess tells me that our table is ready. \"What a relief!\" I think but then she proceeds to take us to a dark corner of the hallway BEFORE the entrance to the main dining area and offer us a terrible seat! I politely tell her that it isn't acceptable to wait 50 minutes for a reservation made a week in advance for a BIRTHDAY celebration and be offered a walk-in table. She gets even more annoyed and says \"well then, you have to wait more\". I say we'll wait because I am not going to bring my parents to a top notch restaurant and have them seat at the entrance! At this point I walk up to the manager and tell him about the situation. His response? \"HAVE YOU EVER EATEN HERE?\" I say \"No\" his response? \"WHEN YOU EAT THE FOOD, YOU'LL GET IT!\" - umm.. WHAT? Did he just say that? Are you freakin' kidding me? Is this nobody restaurant manager suggesting that I've never experienced gourmet meals and hence have no idea what it takes? I politely respond that \"I've had many culinary experiences around town and this is not normal.\" he says \"well, there is nothing I can do about it!\" I respond by saying that \"of course you can, you can be more organized in your scheduling and be nice to your customers when you aren't able to deliver on your service in a timely manner.\" - at this point he walks away! NOT ONCE did anyone apologize for this experience. NOT ONCE did they offer to comp a drink at the bar while we waited for over an hour for a table (yes, we got a decent table after AN HOUR of waiting). Had they not lied to my face multiple times and said \"the table is almost ready\", we would have happily left and eaten elsewhere. Mr. Nazarian, I know this is not how you run your businesses but you should know that your employees at Cleo have absolutely no manners and have no problem insulting your patrons. I know for sure that I won't be back. No matter how good the food you serve is, the rude and negative energy at the front door takes away all the fun.

Not spicy really. I recommend dipping it into one of the dips that comes with the pita bread! Spicy cigars - MY favorite! 6/5 )I could order that and eat it all day long. Roasted cauliflower- 4/5 Brussels sprouts- 6/5 -this is what they are known for! Everyone loved it! Instead of preparing the entire Brussels sprouts as is, the leaves/petals(?)/layers have been peeled apart and roasted that way so it's got a bit of a crisp to itRoasted potatoes- they they were cute little baby potatoes - smaller than a ping pong ball even. They looked like hush puppies almost. :) 4/5Then I had their grilled shrimp and marinated chicken , while my nieces got the chicken ragine (it comes out in a cool looking pyramid shaped dome, and lamb and steak kabobs. I'm not a fan of lamb so when I was offered a piece to try it I thought it was a bit overwhelming. But it seemed to have had a lot of flavor to it. The steak was very good though! My chicken kabob was very well marinated as well, the shrimp was good but I was too full to finish it. For desserts we had baklava, green tea frozen yogurt , and chocolate cake. Baklava and chocolate cake was a big hit. Green tea should just stick with being a tea or ice cream. Cheers! If you're seeing a show at 8 which we were I recommend getting to the restaurant at 6.

We rarely come out to Hollywood so when we got the opportunity to come see Jerry Seinfeld at the Pantages, there was no question about coming to Cleo. Unfortunately, the hostess that assisted us this evening was one of the meanest and rudest I have come across. We arrived before 6pm for a 6:30 reservation. My sweet husband walks up to check in and ask the hostess if they were open yet. She replied \"in two minutes.\" We were not in a hurry so we sat at the nearest chairs. Not even 10 seconds later, a couple walks up asking for a table. They explained to the hostess, they did not have reservation. She takes them right in. After about 10 minutes, the hostess ask us what name the reservation was under. She couldn't find it for good few minutes. Finally, she looks again in her screen, finds us, and seat us by the bar. I asked her if there is any available table inside the restaurant and she annoyingly replied \"Everyone has requested to sit inside.\" Umm... Are you kidding me? The unnecessary tone should have told me just to leave but again, we patiently waited back at the chairs. After about five minutes, the same hostess took us in. There were plenty of seats inside! Why? Because we were here right at the beginning of the dinner time. And keep in mind, we dined from 6:25-7:45pm with plenty of seating. It's unfortunate and completely unnecessary when an unpleasant person power trips right before dinner. Not only that, as we sat down, she proceeded to talk crap and pass notes like grade school child to one of the girls that helped get our drinks. My own kid doesn't even behave like that. And I did not expect this kind of bad behavior at a nice restaurant. Other than the mean front lady, my husband and I had a delicious meal.

They gave us extra free of charge :) Branzino was super tender, not fishy at all, and the pilaf mixture with the creamy sauce was perfect. The flavor is unique and was welcome after all the meaty kabobs we inhaled prior to being served this dish. Chopped salad is okay but too salty. The eggplant lasagna type of dish was a bit took mushy and salty for my taste but super cheesy. The real MVP was the Brussel sprouts OMG whatever you do make sure you get this!! Times three orders. It's super crispy and oily in the most delicious way...I need the recipe. Ambiance is bougie causal. It's way too dark inside though.

This came as a surprise to me because it was a Tuesday night, but as we were seated I can say they definitely were busy. The restaurant is quite intimate. The tables were too close to one another for my taste. It left no room for privacy. Also, it's pretty loud in there so it was hard for my friend and I to hold a conversation without feeling like we were raising our voices or constantly repeating ourselves. The food was quite delicious. It's essentially a Mediterranean tapas restaurant. They suggest around 3 dishes per person but I have to say that that would have been way too much food for us. I say start with about 3 dishes per 2 people and go from there. Everything we had was great. My only complaint is that my lamb tagine was about 80% fat and 20% meat. Don't get me wrong, I love fatty pieces on my meat but there was way too much of it and it was not edible. Oh and be warned, the later you dine the more likely the kitchen will be out of entire dishes or ingredients \u00a0(i couldn't get tuna tartar and my friend got a flatbread without the artichokes).Although the food gets 2 thumbs up for me, I don't know how soon I'd return based on the fact that it was hard to socialize and I felt like both tables next to me were in my conversation because we were so close together."], ["Anthony V.", "Expensive but the food and cocktails are great"], ["Sandy C.", "Had an unexpected birthday dinner here, friend and i came here before our show at Pantages Theater.

The Babaghanoush and Labneh with Feta dips were tasty, and served with freshly baked bread (we asked for a good amount of extra bread).The Tuna Tartare was fresh and delicious, but the portion was so tiny. Probably not worth the price.For some reason, the Clam Flatbread did not taste good at all during dinner, but when we ate the leftovers the next day it was tasty--maybe it was the combination of dishes we ate? I had a bite of the Mushroom Flatbread and didn't taste anything spectacular.We ordered the popular Brussels Sprouts. The flavors were good, but it was way too oily for my taste. They do fry it, so it's not unexpected, but it would've been nice if they drained off the oil more before serving it.The Chicken Tagine was a decent sized portion (unlike most of the other dishes), but there was nothing special about it. It tasted pretty bland to me.Our waiter recommended the Grilled Daurade, which was an excellent dish. The fish was flaky, and the sauce was unique and paired well with the fish.The drinks were average prices for a high end restaurant. I ordered the Spiced Ginger Mojito, which was tasty, but not very strong. Service was okay. The place was busy, and sometimes we had to flag down the waiter, but he did check on us every once in awhile. We were there for almost 2 hours, and we eat fast, so some of the dishes took awhile to come out.As for ambiance, it would've been nice if it wasn't so crowded. The tables are way too close to each other. Someone sitting behind my fiance coughed, and my fiance felt something wet land on his arm--GROSS! I would've given that guy a dirty look, but it was way too dark for him to even notice me. It's not the restaurant's fault that guy couldn't cover his mouth properly, but this just shows how cramped it is in the restaurant. Definitely not an enjoyable and comfortable dinner experience.Cleo was on my list for a long time, and I'm glad I was able to finally try out the food.

But honestly, you probably can't go wrong with any of the choices.I only have two tiny complaints. When the bill came, we noticed that there was a 20% gratuity added onto our bill. We asked our server what this was and she said it was for DineLA customers. Nowhere on the menu stated this, so I wasn't too happy about that. I don't mind paying a 20% tip, it's really the principle and assumption that annoys me. Also the fact that our server wasn't that great doesn't help (she took our drink orders 20-minutes after we sat down and in that time took the food orders of parties that sat down AFTER us). The second thing was that no tables, including us, were given the DineLA menu. It was only given to us after we asked for it. In my four years of doing DineLA, I have never seen a participating restaurant \"hide\" their DineLa menu. Ever. Every restaurant up until now has always promoted it. This was very weird to me.Otherwise, our experience at Cleo was perfect.

Something about the spice was lacking to me.Beef Cigars: Adorable! Beef in puff pastry. Think of them like a mediterranean taquito. Served with a very yummy yogurt sauce.Roasted cauliflower: These were outstanding for me. Loved the cashews and pickled onion mixed with the cauliflower. So good!Course 2:cucumber chopped salad: very similar to the chopped salads at persian restaurants. Chopped onion, tomato, cucumber,etc tossed ever so lightly in lemon juice and cumin. \u00a0Really enjoyed this salad.Optional 10 dollar upgraded brussel sprout salad: An absolute must!!!! They pull the leaves from the sprouts and flash fry/saute them in something heavenly.

The chicken is atop pilaf and served with almonds and olives garnishing the top. If you like a Moroccan flair, this dish is for you!Chicken and beef skewers: very flavorful chicken, but I liked the skirt steak even more. It was marinated in brown sugar, and the skewers are served with this chili sauce on the side. I dug the sweet and hot flavors mixed together.Course 4: Dessert!!!Sticky toffee pudding: Served a la mode with a caramel crispy garnish. I'm not crazy about toffee, but this was an amazing dessert!Baklava with cinnamon ice cream: Need I say more. Some of the best baklava I have had, and the cinnamon ice cream wasn't overwhelming.

If you get it, you get it, if not, you're not missing out on much.Seasonal Mushroom Flatbread: ($14) Sadly, this was my least favorite. Mainly due to the burnt sides. I wasn't sure if the bitter taste of the flatbread was due to the burnt pieces or the veggies on it.Grilled Hanger Steak: ($15) Very juicy, chewy, delicious. This would be my number 2 favorite right after the brussels sprouts. I'd recommend this as well.Evian Water: ($9) Now this... I feel lied to. When our waiter came by, he asked us, \"Would you like house water? Evian or Sparking?\" Now... was he giving us 3 options? Or was he telling us there is only Evian house water or sparking? Well, we decided to pick the Evian not realizing it was $9. So if you don't care much for tap or bottled, I'd suggest you ask for the house water. Service: Loved how quick they were with the food. Immediately after being seated, our server made notice that we were in a rush to make it to the Pantages. She sped the food up and the service and made the night very enjoyable.Price: It is tapas style so just know that you will be eating maybe two to three plates per person, paying nearly $30 or more per person, and not being full.

The flavor of the garlic sauce combined with the chicken and rice makes me salivate just thinking about it, and I can't even begin to tell you how many times their spicy hummus & pita has served as an appropriate dinner-time appetizer or post-dinner snack late into the evening.I'm not a huge fan of the interior ambiance of this restaurant, which is somewhat intimate and bright (white walls, white tables) on the inside, which confuses my senses and isn't for me.

They have heaters outside but it gets pretty hot since they can't control the temperature on it. PARKINGStreet (meter) parking is limited. Valet is $5.50 and all they do is park it in the back alley )= But had to do it after wasting 10 minutes trying to find street parking. *Don't forget the Yelp check in for a free appetizer (="], ["Priya G.", "My hubby and I came here for a late lunch today and were totally impressed. When you walk in, you feel like you are in another country. It has a great ambiance - dim lighting, good music, beautiful exotic decor. We were seated right away and Skyler was our waitress. She was so attentive and friendly and super bubbly. We really liked her!! The food was so delicious. As a vegetarian, it's often hard to find Mediterranean/middle eastern food that has a good variety. We started with the hummus and it was so flavorful and perfect. I love that they added fresh garbanzo beans in the center with olive oil and sumac. We also had the falafel which were very good - they were moist on the inside and very crispy on the outside and you could taste all of the spices inside. The tahini was very well-made. Finally, we had the zaatar flat bread which was cooked to perfection - not too oily and not too dry. Yum!!!! The price is very affordable as well. They give you a free appetizer with checking in though we would come here without that! Amazing place, amazing service. Can't wait to come again!"], ["Sarina V.", "YUM been wanting to try this place for awhile! Good authentic food!Moroccan iced green mint tea was delicious!If you check-in you get a free appetizer, awesome!Appetizers:Got the watermelon and grilled cheese (3 stars)- I just wanted something light- this was pretty good, middle eastern cheese is def different and I like it! Would maybe try something else though next time.Spicy Hummus (5 stars)- super fresh and also got more with our entrees that was their special house made and oh so good.Entrees:Chicken Tawook (4.5 stars)- really good flavor and tender, garlic sauce that comes with it is amazing (I love sauce & garlic hahaha), rice was good, the salad was amazing with it too. The one I get near my house is still the best, but this one comes really close to it!Chicken Shwarma (5 stars)- Ok usually shwarma is really dry, not this one, this was actually the best I've tasted! They split it in half too and did this with the tawook.Lamb Chops (5 stars)- Really good, tender and simple! My brother loves this!Pita Falafel (3 stars)- My mom said this was better the first time she came too, a little inconsistent :(Tabouleh (4 stars)- It was my mom's second time, she said it was better the first time, but I enjoyed it. Dessert:Of course I really wanted dessert haha. They all looked so interesting and I wanted to try something different and crispy and flakey!K'naafeh (3 stars)- I wish I would've stuck to baklava (one of my favs), says it's a wheat pastry so I was thinking something flaky like baklava, this is more like a cake, the orange blossom with it was good, but this was just waaaaaay too sweet for me, got it with the cheese too. Interesting dessert but next time I'll stick to the baklava. :("], ["Crystal T.", "First of all, everyone was super nice. Second of all, the food was seriously amazing. Thirdly, the decor and ambiance were super cute. This was my favorite restaurant we went to in LA - granted, I was there over Thanksgiving weekend, so we didn't eat out a lot, but it was really nice. It rivals Zaytoons in Brooklyn, my other favorite Mediterranean place. MEDITERRANEAN FOREVER. I took half of my chicken shawarma panini to go since I was so full from our appetizer (Foul M'Damas - IT TASTES AS GOOD AS ITS NAME IS FUNKY), and ate it on my flight home the next morning - it was still amazing and I'm pretty sure everyone around me was like, dang, I wish I had that girl's panini. Yeah."], ["Lynda N.", "More of a 3.5 star rating. The food and ambiance was good but I don't know. Something was missing!I started off with the Yalla Baby Yalla cocktail which was sweet but kind of had a strange after taste. The fried potatoes (appetizer) were good but the bottom of the bowl had so much damn lemon juice that it just totally turned me off. Even with the garlic sauce, I couldn't get over the overwhelming acidity.I had the lamb kebab which was actually really good. The basmati rice was also really nicely made but the salad was also very acidic. Towards the end of the meal, my tongue actually felt really sensitive due to the amount of acid. It kinda felt like it was cut which is why my rating is kinda low. Cut back on the acid please!The environment is nice and the waiters are attentive. Kinda pricy but that was to be expected at a restaurant in this area haha."], ["Javier F.", "Dining Service and food is great... With an exception that the bar really sucks....

You just can't ignore a customer and keep on talking to your friends. Me and my friend were timing to see how long it will take for her to realize that two customers just arrived and leaning on the bar and perhaps want some drinks. The bar is not huge lady...!

We originally had a reservation at 8:00, but at 7:37 I realized we were going to be running late, so I called and asked to push the reservation to 8:30. They said that would be fine. When we arrived at 8:30, we ended up having to wait 30-45 minutes to be seated. They did apologize for overbooking, although if they were going to give our table away I wish they would have just said so so we could rush on over right away instead of saying they would push the reservation and not telling us.That being said, once we sat down, everything went smoothly. We started with the eggplant leaves, haloumi & watermelon, and yogurt dip, which were all delicious. I would definitely recommend trying the haloumi & watermelon, it was different and interesting. For dinner, my companions and I had the chicken shawarma, filet mignon kabob, lamb kabob, and for me a single grilled lamb chop a la carte. Everything was well-seasoned, juicy, and tender. I would definitely come back, but on a Saturday night, be prepared to wait. The wait is worth it, though!"], ["Frank G.", "This was an amazing place.

There's an outdoor seating area, when you walk up the steps to the restaurant. **THE SERVICE**My server was waiting on the whole house when I first arrived. More servers arrived a little later.

I recommend it.**THE FOOD**I'd read good things from fellow Yelpers about the lamb here. So, I knew that's what I would try for sure. -Pita bread: nice and soft, good.-Foul M Damas: (Fava and chickpeas, can be eaten as a soup) this came free with my Yelp! check-in. A nice bonus. It was very good. Subtle flavor, good serving size. It came with a vegetable plate that included: cucumbers pickles, radishes, tomatoes and onions. -Lamb Chops: I ordered them medium rare and they did not disappoint! Very good! Also, the price (for the amount and size of lamb you're served) is great. The meal came with rice and two sides and I chose hummus and salad, both good as well. -Dessert: Ashta, or Rose flavored ice cream. Yummy!! Highly recommend!

Their staff was also on point: very kind and attentive.I checked in and got a free appetizer so I tried their GRILLED HALLOUMI CHEESE & WATERMELON. This took me back to when i traveled to Greece. They always had baked cheese with some type of fruit. This was so delicious. THe Halloumi cheese had that savory taste but not too overpowering. It complemented the juicy light flavor of the watermelon!KAFTA- The meat itself wasn't dry and had just enough flavor. I am not a huge fan of lamb, but the meat didn't have that smell at all. So major props to this. CHICKEN TAWOOK- Loved the chicken. So juicy and the garlic sauce on the side was pungent at all. You bite into that chicken and all you get is a mouthwatering tasted of flavors: the bbq taste, the hint of garlic and the springy flavor from the pickles. YUM. FRENCH FRIES- How can I not mention about this? The fries tasted so fresh! It wasn't overly salted and just had the perfect balance of crunch and softness. It was a perfect addition to my baba ghannouj.

The wine list does feature a lot of Lebanese wine as well as a full bar menu including specialty cocktails. Their mezze had something to entice everyone and so for us we picked a few dishes to sample. Labne, Baba Ghanoush, Dolma, and Spanakopita. The Labne and Baba Ghanoush were as expected. Although the eggplant spread was a bit bland. The Doma was quite disappointing. The rice inside the eggplant, yes, eggplant not a grape leaf, was way overcooked. If it wasn't for the yogurt and pine nuts atop, there would not be much flavor. Albeit the flavor that was there was way too sour and overpowered the whole dish. The Spanakopitas had very nice flaky dough, but the inside had more feta than spinach, which made the whole pastry too heavy.Overall the meal was somewhat mediocre, but I would come back and sample other offerings.

My starter of tabbouleh and salmon salad entree were enough for me and I even ended up with leftovers! A very good deal in terms of quantity, but what about quality? Definitely. I made a gamble on the tabbouleh, as I normally don't like it (too much bulgur or olive oil) but their tabbouleh is bright, crisp, and refreshing.

The rest was okay. Caesar salad: this was my \"if all else fails, eat a salad or if it's great, you have leftovers\" choice. Note for the business- a Cesar salad should never have tomatoes. Ever. Or cucumbers. I didn't order a house salad, I ordered a traditional Cesar salad. How can you mess up the most simple of all salads? Chicken sandwich: definitely the best of the three.

The hummus is good, the garlic sauce is good, and it does't make me feel like fat blob after I finish the meal (relatively healthier than fast food burgers, or chinese/thai food, imo). The only knock I have about this place is that the delivery sometimes takes a while (every time i've ordered, the food arrived anywhere between an hour and an hour and fifteen minutes.)

The salad (greens, not crappy ice berg salad) deliciously tossed with a light balsamic vinaigrette sauce, it is cooled and very refreshing (especially on a hot day).

The place is tucked away in the jewelry district of downtown like a mediterranean food oasis along with four or five other restaurants and cafes.Everything on the menu looked so good that Fiancee and I wanted to try everything. The server was nice enough to let us mix and match combos (even though that wasn't an option on the menu) so we could sample a little bit of everything because we are gluttonous slobs.Before the main event, we got pita and hummus. The hummus was nice and creamy without being heavy, and the pita was thin (I don't like when the bread is too thick). When you bite into the pita, you get the usual softness, but you get a little crispiness at the end that tells you it's really fresh. The salad that came with the combo was very simple, but very light and refreshing - more so than other places that drown their salads in dressing.In all, we tried the doner, lule kebab, chicken kebab, and shish kebab. Again, a half order of each. On suggestions from other reviews, we also tried the bulgur rice with one of our combos. The doner is the best I've ever had. Some might think it's a little salty, but when it's sliced so thin the way it was, the crispy meaty crust you get combines perfectly with the savoriness. The lule reminded me of a spicy version of beef koobideh. Usually when places serve koobideh, there's so much of it, one can easily get flavor fatigue, but with the lule kebab, the spiciness adds another layer of flavor, which I really liked.The chicken was surprisingly moist and had decent flavor. The shish kebab was also nice and moist. Only the last piece at the end was a little dry, but I think that can be forgiven considering that 99% of the meat on that plate was spot on. Also, you should try the bulgur rice. I don't even think it's really rice. It looks like couscous, but it's 10 times better than the rice.The service was very friendly and helpful and the prices aren't bad. For two combos with four kinds of meat, salad, rice, hummus, and pita bread it came out to about $25 with tip. Not too bad for a belly filling excursion.

Besides, the odor from the rice made it a not very pleasant dish for me and my wife.

My salad shirazi came with 'a lot' of french dressing and had no onion in it! Customer service was OK.

Not sure I'd come back as the whole idea left a bitter taste in my mouth. To be fair, the sandwich was decent tasting and the hot sauces were on point and appreciated. But 285% over cost?!?! Pfft...I'd rather go to Ta-eem Grill on Melrose. You can get a humongous chicken shawarma wrap/burrito stuffed with generous portions of sizzling and juicy chicken shawarma and your choice of the various pickles and side dishes they are able to stuff into it. AND...it's only $7.99 too.I could come back here again but I'm not really inclined to do so. I think I'll stick to my go-to place on Melrose."], ["Alana L.", "We had the worst experience.We came for Shawarma and they ran out, we wanted hummus and they also ran out, the lamb kebab was not tasty and the salads were bland. Service was also slow."], ["Mick A.", "It had been a busy day and we looking for a healthy and quality dinner. Mediterranean styled food seemed like the perfect fit for us. As we pulled up in the Uber we did wonder as the physical appearance is one which is very understated, and on this occasion there were only a couple of others eating in.We decided to trust our decision and give it ago. We were greeted by really nice people who patiently explained the menu options. The food was a terrific experience. The chicken breast plate was outstanding and amongst the tastiest and tender breast I have had. It was stunning......and we also shared the Shawera, a mix of a nicely seasoned lamb and chicken which was succulent and tasty too. The accompaniments on both plates, including lentil rice and Israeli salad were very complimentary with the meats.A really good eating house and for good food when you are on the go this is an ideal destination."], ["Linette F.", "To tell you the truth, I am so amazed at how giving Sam, the manager is. He enjoys giving back to the LA community and somehow word on the street is that he gives away complimentary food to the homeless around the area. Out of the kindness of his heart, he wants to help these people and as a patron I really admire that. Now let's dive into the food business:grilled chicken breast plate- this is my go to order. Freshly marinated and grilled chicken breasts over a subtly minty tabbouleh (I substitute this over the rice) makes this meal so delicious. The pickled veggie bar has a great assortment from pickled cabbage, to pickled radish and to pickled onions.grilled fish plate- I love it when I can get a nice piece of grilled fish at a Mediterranean place. Lightly flavored grilled salmon but it had a nice crispy finish on the edges! It was perfect. Thank you Sam for great food and always welcoming us with a smile! Keep up the amazing work and giving back to the community!"], ["Dorothy H.", "I discovered my new favorite dish here, it is so good! The Shakshuka is excellent, I had never heard of it before, but read the description and loved the idea of eggs. It's a real comfort food, but spicy and bold. The service is also very friendly and efficient. There's also a pickled veggie and sauce bar that is very generous. Great place!"], ["Hollywood A.", "I've been meaning to try this place and finally had an opportunity yesterday. I walked in after the lunch rush and was able to order immediately. I ordered the chicken plate which came with hummus, cucumber and tomato salad, rice, and fresh pita bread. The chicken was juicy and nicely flavored, everything was fresh and made to order. My favorite was the hummus and pita bread. The only downfall was how small their water cups are, I literally had to refill my water 5-6 times during my meal. Overall great food and good customer service, I'll definitely be back."], ["Bisma M.", "This restaurant comes up under Halal food when searching on yelp, good thing I asked before placing my order because the food was not halal! Really enjoyed the food here, ended up ordering a plate of falafel which included rice, salad, hummus and falafel. The prices were a little high compared to other Mediterranean food places I have visited."], ["Maham M.", "First off thank you to the very friendly staff. Cashier was very welcoming and gave great recommendations for me and my GF.The two pitas that we got (Shawarma & Streak) were great. Especially the streak very tender and cooked to perfect."], ["Alex N.", "Small location on Fairfax, I parked on the street, not sure if they have a parking in the back.Staff is ok, service was fast.Place is decent, not new , not dirtyNot a fan of the area .I had - a Moroccan merguez pita sandwich, I really liked it, pretty tasty, but expensive ($11 for a sandwich !)- french fries were okMy friend had the shish kebab steak, I had half of it , the meat was dry and not tender, not my type of seasoning... Didn't worth the $11 at all.I would go back and try other dishes but $16 for a pitta sandwich and fries, it is way too expensive. For that price I would at least expect a nice place/area to hang out."], ["Maria M.", "Loved the food. I ordered the shish kabab and some french fries. Everything tasted great. What I didn't care for was that when I was ordering it seamed like such a hassle to the girl that took my order. It was my first time here so I asked a few questions about what was what. Over all I wouldn't let that stop be on coming back again. I personally am huge on customer service. I do recommend this place. The watermelon juice is amazing!!"], ["Izza K.", "My sister and I ordered the shawarma in pita and a chicken kebab plate. I liked the chicken shawarma more than the chicken kebab. The kebabs weren't very flavorful. I believe they are made of chicken thighs, which though juicy was a bit too chewy. The portions are on the smaller side given the price. This isn't to say the food is not good but I've had way better Mediterranean food. They do have condiments that include some wonderful sauces and pickled veggies you can pile on your plate as many times as you like."], ["Theresa E.", "Was that Shish Kabab or was that the best MF meal of my life? I don't know yet.SOLID TABOULISCHNITZEL Check!!!Raise your hands if your favorite dish is the hummus con carne. My stepbrother and his gay friend were all over the LAMB Shashush-kabab. Their sides are Huge! Kudos for the hot delivery guy!!!!!"], ["Sepehr M.", "Love this place!!!Solid food on a consistent basis with great service.... What more can you ask for?I have ordered lunch and dinner at this place and never been disappointed.I recommend the shawarma on lafah.....I can't get enough of it!"], ["Agustina K.", "I really wanted to like this place. I went here with a friend after reading the massive numbers of 5 star reviews. My friend ordered the pita sandwich with shawarma and hummus and I ordered a greek salad with shawarma added on it. It wasn't bad really. But it also wasn't great. The Greek salad was just your typical greek salad and the shawarma, although tasty, felt so fatty that I felt my arteries clogging (even after eating a healthy mediterranean salad guys). The pita bread was warmly toasted and delicious, but honestly, it's pretty hard to go wrong with bread.. One positive thing is that the hummus was really delicious. So if you're going to come here, atleast get the hummus and you'll be satisfied."], ["David Z.", "I went here for lunch with a group of about six and we had no issue saddling up a couple of tables for a great, fast and easy lunch. What I've Had: Schwarma Pita with Mint Lemonade and a sampling of all their pickles and sauces. I'll be the first to admit that I like creamier Middle Eastern sauces like tarna and tahini, and both of theirs are on point. But their harisa is an offering that I don't often get with my schwarma and that's a flavor combo I'm going to seek out again!A second try here could bump this up to a five star review, I just need to know it's as good a second time around."], ["Vanessa M.", "Been here quite for sometimes and always seem to get the same thing? because it's so good so why change it?! I love chicken so I always come here for the chicken only. Parking is street only. Inside is pretty small and outside has 2 tables. The owner is real nice and accommodating. _Chicken Breast. Marinated and Grilled. All plates are served with a side of hummus, salad, lentil rice and pita.* Pita - $9.75* Baguette or Laffa - $11.75* Plate - $13.752 Big portions of chicken breast, Always cooked perfectly tender and juicy. The hummus is good and real smooth. The salad is a mix of chopped cucumbers, tomatoes and I think onions and their dressing. Refreshing and simple. The lentil rice is different since it's usually with jasmine rice or basmati rice. The lentil is fluffy but not a huge fan. The pita is pretty thick and fluffy. Real good when it comes out warm. This is more than enough for one person, I always take some of it home since I can never finish the whole plate, They have many other options as well; Chicken Kabab, Shish Kabab (steak), Shawerma, Lamb, and other specialties. They also have a small stand with different sauces and spices, as well as some sliced onions with a dab on pepper, pickled carrots, red pickle, and some other condiments. If you are in the area and shopping around Melrose, make sure to check out Pita Bar :)"]]}
