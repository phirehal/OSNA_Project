{"Churros Calientes": [["Chris T.", "Food is amazing, get an order of regular churros and an ice cream churro. The vanilla with churro combo is worth the wait and the trip!The owner is extremely friendly and service is clearly very important to them.Heads up, it gets crowded at night!"], ["Elissa W.", "ATTENTION: THIS IS A STEP ABOVE THE BASIC COFFEE SHOP DATE. It's a more cultured version of coffee date. Perfect if you want to feel someone out, but not have the obligation of spending at least $50 and 2.5 hours out of your day. The shop itself is tiny, very close together spaces. So that may be a problem. But who knows, maybe that'll force you to lean and mhmmmm. ;) But it's not that great for groups because there's no room to be able to talk to everyone. However, the lack of space is compensated by the awesome, tight knit staff. They joked around with us and gave mad family vibes. The atmosphere in general is a big part of this place. I love the cantina-esque music they play and the jangled decor. Approve.On to the food, aka the infamous Churros. They do a few options with their basic churro. You can get it if filled (chocolate, guava, etc). They have skinnier churros that come with a small cup of hot chocolate; they have a churro with two scoops of ice cream on the side; and they have one churro filled and topped with various sauces. All are equally sexy and delicious options. Can't go wrong with any dessert option. It's not the cheapest, especially considering you can probably finish it in three bites, but not that expensive on the spectrum of food. Check this place out! At the end of the day, it has great dessert options, specifically churros. Not that dry $1 one you get from Costco. We talking about some yummy stuff here. GO. now."], ["Rachel S.", "Yesterday we got our churro on at Churros Calientes. Yesterday was a good day. It was too cold for ice cream, so I Yelp'd \"hot dessert\" and Churros Calientes was the first place to pop up in my feed. Needless to say the group was down for some churros. The tiny space was packed when we arrived and the only available seating was outdoors. It was rather chilly outside, but the staff brought over a few heat lamps and we were able to stay nice and toasty. The group ordered the churros con chocolate, mochas, mint tea, and some type of chocolate ice cream churro concoction that I can't remember the name of. I had the churros con chocolate and mint tea, both of which were delicious. One of my friends recently went to Spain and said that the churros are just like what he ate in Barcelona. All in all we had a great time! The staff was exceptionally friendly and made my friends and I feel very much at home. I've never been to Spain, but I imagine that the atmosphere in the cafes have a cozy vibe similar to that of Churros Calientes. We'll be returning soon!"], ["Tiffany G.", "What a delightful little spot! The inside is a bit tight in seating with only a handful or seats outside. They have a list of various teas to order and of course coffee. My friend and I shared the nutella churros... just perfect! They were fresh, the right amount, and fulfilled my sweet tooth for sure! Definitely will come and back again.Side note: They dont have a bathroom, but they are nice enough to give you the pass to use the bathrooms at The Landmark next door."], ["Lisa W.", "My 300th review!A dessert staple after Sawtelle and WLA shennanigans!Churros Calientes is the place you wanna go for authentic churros, not the footlong theme park variety (not that I have any qualms with those)! I love the sidewalk cafe ambiance and the selection of churro varieties is unlike anything I've ever seen. They have regular churros that are small and skinny, with the perfect dusting of sugar, the perfect crunch and moist center. They also have the stuffed variety which are SINFUL. I love the guava and cream cheese combination and I have friends that are fiends for the dulce de leche. Churros con chocolate is a must. The hot chocolate is thick, robust and creamy, and the perfect consistency for dipping and dousing.I have yet to try their dinner, but I appreciate that they have a good selection of salads and paninis.Though the storefront is small, I have never had a problem finding a table. Service is extremely efficient. Within a minute of sitting down, I am always greeted and served. Their hours of operation are odd, be sure to check Yelp to see what time they open. Tip: For those days when you're feeling lazy and blue, for a small charge you can order through EAT24!"], ["Nhung N.", "Churros with ice cream? Yes please. I randomly stopped by on a Saturday and finally got to try! After looking over the menu for so long I still couldn't decide. Who knew it'd be so hard to pick churros.My boyfriend and I got the churros grande with ice cream since we weren't too hungry. We got the churro with strawberry filling and condensed milk topping. I expected the churro to be bigger since it is called grande but it was still good. It was $10 which is an ok price. The churro was nice and crispy but difficult to eat. They should supply knifes with the forks and spoons. The ice cream was actually my favorite part of the dish.Next time I'll have to try just try churros with a topping like dulce de leche."], ["Monica J.", "We ordered late last night to pick up some churros and got stuck at every red light along the way. \u00a0I've been scoping this place out for a while now and so being in Santa Monica, I really wanted to stop. \u00a0We showed up 5 minutes after they closed and I felt so badly, yet, the man had my order for me. \u00a0Unfortunately, it turned out my order could only be paid for by cash and I didn't have cash. \u00a0I felt SO bad and he should have been super annoyed with me for being 1) Late and 2) Without cash. \u00a0Yet, when most people turn sour, the man reacted with such GRACE. \u00a0He was so kind, smiled, and said \"Take it - you drove here late. \u00a0Enjoy.\" \u00a0Thank you for your understanding and generosity...we will be back to order more churros and to pay you back soon.Fellow Yelpers, I urge you to support this business. \u00a0Not only do they serve great churros, Churros Calientes is staffed by a true gem in this world."], ["Julia T.", "Churros calientes serves delicious churros. You can try many different varieties like drizzled with guava, chocolate, and caramel. They have churros filled with chocolate and other delicious fillings as well.My favorite ones are the churros with chocolate dipping sauce. \u00a0It comes with 8 thin churros. These aren't the ones from Disneyland with the cinnamon and sugar...these are a bit lighter with just sugar. Closer to Spanish churros. The chocolate dipping sauce is delicious. There is a floral note to the chocolate I can't place...some kind of cardamom spice? Either way, the dipping sauce is delicious! I just want to drink it straight from the cup. Overall: they do one main thing and they do it exceedingly well. If anybody wants a great place for a dessert, this is a must-go!"], ["Meng O.", "My mouth is watering just reminiscing about the churros here. I had a difficult time believing that such a place as this establishment, exists outside of the awesome Disneyland Churros Cart!!! Parking:Metered parking on the street. There's also a parking lot around the corner $1/hr.Staff / Environment:Owner and co. were super friendly and attentive. Tiny place. (very few tables inside and out) - Cozy and comfortable ambiance though.Food:I had the Churros Laggos w/ Guava Cream Cheese and Condensed Milk. Undoubtedly, love at first bite! It was super fresh, creamy and delicious. Must TRY!Churros Calientes is EXCELENTE!"], ["Ian L.", "A killer European-feeling dessert/hangout joint!I've always wondered why there is a crowd gathered here on late nights. This is truly a diamonds-in-the-rough establishment on Santa Monica Blvd!We shared a Churros Con Chocolate which was six churros with a small cup of sipping chocolate. The churros were amazing; nice, warm, and crunchy with the right amount of sugary crackle. The chocolate was unexpectedly rich and creamy. Combining the two was crazy delicioso. I just wished they had brought the two out together rather than the chocolate before the churros. \u00a0I will definitely be back to get my churro on!"], ["Christine C.", "I love finding unique dessert places and this is one of them! Where else can you get fresh delicious churros and with dipping sauce?! Three words: Churros con chocolate. I don't have a big sweet tooth but these churros are SO GOOD and really aren't that sweet even coated with sugar. They're not too big so you won't feel guilty eating two, three..or maybe all of them :X. Absolutely must dip the churros in the Spanish hot chocolate. I think the hot chocolate is too rich to drink by itself but perfect for dipping.The food looks good but kind of pricey. I contemplated getting the chicken noodle soup but didn't think $9.50 was worth it..I recommend coming here for dessert...or maybe dinner AND dessert :). Can't wait to introduce my friends to this place!"], ["Cynthia P.", "I've heard so many good things about this place and I was around the area and I decided to give it a try. There's only street parking, so it can be a hassle looking for parking. Another tip this place is packed all the time, a lot of big groups tend to come and hang out so if you don't want to order to go you should be prepare to wait. I went on a Monday night and it was really busy. The good thing it was only for two people so we got to sit down right away. Too bad I was full from dinner and I just got the Big Churro with ice cream & guava filling. It was pretty amazing but not too big of a churro. After trying the churro I wanted more but I had to stop myself from over eating, I tend to do that a lot :) I will be coming back to this place. In addition to churros they do have caf\u00e9 menu (sandwiches, salads etc. ) But everyone comes for their amazing organic churros"], ["Jaime L.", "This place reminds me of Spain, without the added benefit of being able to walk there (goddammit Los Angeles) and being judged for eating these for dinner (who judges when everyone else is doing it?).They have several different kinds of churros, of which we ordered two - the filled kind, and the small, dip-in-chocolate kind. To be honest, I loved both. There really isn't much else to say - I didn't get a meal (maybe you should stick to what they do best), and what they do, they do well - be prepared to wait. It's a small place, and it's clear they've been discovered."], ["Amanda H.", "I absolutely love Churros Calientes and so when I am in LA visiting family, I always make it a point to stop by. This place is small but mighty and the service is fast and friendly. I really enjoy the many different ways you can eat a simple churro; it's fun and delicious!!! I love the cream cheese stuffed churro topped with guava and dulce de leche, and of course, a la mode!!! The owner is friendly and makes you feel at home. I love the art they do with chocolate syrup for the lattes, this place is MUY DELICIOSO!"], ["Oliver O.", "I came here the other night for dessert after having dinner at Bad Sushi. My friends have been dying to try this place and I couldn't help but get excited. I love churros, probably one of my top 3 favorite desserts. As we walked up we were kindly greeted by a waiter who asked if we would like a table, we were kind of confused/surprised because we were not expecting a sit-down restaurant for a place that serves dessert items. We sat down inside at the only table for 4 peoples available, most of the seating was located outside.We ordered the churros with ice creams which was good but not what I expected. I'm used to churros that have the cinnamon sugar all over but they put a little bit of powered sugar directly on top. It was still good when combined with the ice cream but nothing more than that."], ["Andrea V.", "These are literally the best churros you will ever try. I don't know how they do it, but they have perfected them. I had a churro dry spell for years. Well, luckily I went back to this place just recently and much to my surprise, it is still just as good as it was 5 years ago. I always just order the regular churros with the dipping sauces. I like the dulce de leche and the condensed milk. If you have not been and you have a craving for sweets, you must check it out."], ["Kasumi Y.", "My favorite dessert location in LA! This has been my go-to for churros for a few years now, even though I don't get a chance to go as often anymore. The staff is very friendly and will sometimes treat you to a hot chocolate... I always order the same dishes - churros with hot chocolate and churros with guava and cream cheese. Both are to die for! Both are very sweet, but I always end up getting a cubano as well. Since it's pretty cramped inside, I prefer sitting outside especially on summer nights."], ["Tiffany R.", "Best churro I've ever had. It was really good! The place was small but charming and the ambiance was really cool. I liked the music and the wait staff was really nice."], ["Shannon L.", "Lots of churro upselling as soon as you get inside. He was friendly but still, it was a bit too much.I tried a couple things:-churro with dipping chocolate-churros drizzled with strawberry and sweetened condensed milk-churro filled with dulce de leche and drizzled with guavaThey were all good but start to get really, toothache-inducingly sweet. \u00a0If I have to recommend one, it would be the churros with chocolate because then you can choose whether or not you want to amp it up or eat it plain. \u00a0They give you enough chocolate to drench every bite then sip some more on its own.The actual place itself is very tiny and seems like a good place to meet and catch up with one friend."], ["Julie T.", "Pricey for sure. My second trip here was a little funky. So myFriend and I waited a hour for them to open because they open at 630 pm on weekdays. This place fills up fast! Their heaters weren't working outside so every inside were literally rubbing elbows and their butts kept hitting me when they walked by. We ordered the mocha latte and latte. Both were good but nothing really special. We we received our churros, they were burnt. I mean hard on the outside and not even soft on the inside. When I was chewing the churro, my teeth getting stuck together. I knew I had to complain because I waited one hour to come here. So I told the waiter and he brought it to the back. And it seemed like the owner wasn't happy about it. Finally after a couple minutes he comes back and tells us he will make new ones. They brought us out four? LOL ARE YOU JOKING. You guys are that cheap to not cook 2 more? I mean those 2 small churros we ate were not enjoyable at all whatsoever. I don't know after that happen this place left me having a bad taste in my mouth. I'll just go to Urth for my Spanish latte and Costco for my churros."], ["Celestine A.", "I lied, I ordered the churros with hot chocolate again - this time through Yelp for pickup. It estimated a 10-20 minutes wait. I got there in under 10 minutes and it was already ready! Just as good as I remembered. The perfect amount of crunch and chew to each bite, with a decadent dipping chocolate to pair with. NEXT time, I'll get the grande churro with ice cream. My boyfriend lives five minutes away from here so I guess we can never break up because it's just too convenient to be Churros Caliente's most regular customers."], ["Jia-Wen H.", "Churro Calientes was decent. My friend ordered the churro and ice cream ($8). I ordered their stuffed churro ($5) with guava and condensed milk topping. I tried my churro and my first thought was - Jack in the Box churros are better. The churro tasted a little stale and not that fresh, although I'm sure it was fresh. I tried a bite of my friend's plain churros with ice cream and it tasted like cardboard. There's no cinnamon on the outside. But the ice cream with the chocolate syrup was delicious.I think I prefer Jack in the Box and Costco churros more than Churro Calientes."], ["Jack R.", "If you're expecting Costco churros then this place is not for you.And what's with the Blair Witch prints on the wall? LOLOnce again I wish Yelp offered 1/2 stars. I think this place is more of a 3 1/2 star place for me.Here's why. I ordered the churro with condensed milk and caramel. The thing is the churro is really tough. Like super fried. Like you need a sharp knife and some sharp teeth to crunch this down.Like I'm eating cinnamon toast crunch or something.I just wasn't a fan.Their mango juice was bitter and watery. Their hot chocolate was thick and rich, if you like that type of drinking chocolate then this is for you.Nice service though.Their churros just weren't for me. Costco here I come."], ["Yenny D.", "Had heard so much about Churros Calientes and finally got to try it one Saturday night around 10:30pm. We were afraid we would have to wait to be seated since there were people waiting outside on the sidewalk but we were seated right away indoors.FOOD:- churro grande with guava drizzle and dulce de leche filling - so they switched the order of how I wanted it, but this was still pretty good. The guava is more on the tart side and the dulce de leche isn't tooth achingly sweet.- churro with ice cream - really enjoyed the ice cream!I think we were both disappointed with Churros Calientes because our churros didnt come out hot! And the texture was harder than I had expected. Maybe I'm used to Costco churros where its crispy on the outside and nice and soft inside, but the churros here were hard and crispy throughout :(SERVICE:Friendly and fast. Smiling, ready to take your order and make suggestions.VENUE/PARKING:The inside is tiny! Tables are squeezed in around the bar counter seating. There is also outdoor seating. A lot of people wait outside for to go orders. We found a meter a block away, free since it was late but plenty of residential parking around too.Glad we tried it, but was disappointed in the food and the prices. Definitely expensive for the amount of food you get! :("], ["Bahar R.", "Service: Super friendly, authentic & helpfulFood: Guava & Dulce de Leche churro w/ melted chocolate to dip was super tasty.

LA is lucky to have this gem. If you are a churro afficionado like me (and we're not talking like the $1.50 ones at Costco - though those are tasty as well!), you will love this place! The Churros Largo with Strawberry and condensed milk topping was delicious. You can also try other toppings like Guava (supposed to be wildly popular), Dulce de Leche or Nutella. \u00a0The standard Churros con Chocolate was my fave. You only get 6 churros, so you may want to consider placing an extra order for churros, or sip that delicious chocolate up! We also ordered a couple of Shakeratos (a hit with our party) and a blended Ghirardelli chocolate drink. So good.The other star here is their young GM Michael who was so hospitable, friendly and gracious that we came in. Be sure to say hi to him if you visit!I will definitely be returning here when I'm in LA. \u00a0I only have two other places that do Spanish churros right - one is in Barcelona and the other is in the Philippines, atleast this one is on the same continent and state!"], ["Ani P.", "A bit pricy for what you get. \u00a0The Spanish style hot chocolate is tiny. \u00a0I understand this is decadence and you don't need much, but my Spanish sister-in-law is even accustomed to a larger size in Spain.The hot chocolate is my fave in LA. \u00a0Creamy, chocolatey, thick and very reminiscent of the real thing. \u00a0 The churros are made or organic flour and were light and not too sweet (apparently they can be a hit or miss).This place is tiny but was still comfie with 3 little kids. \u00a0I recommend making your own Spanish style hot chocolate at home; but if you are having a serious craving, this is your spot!"], ["Cindy P.", "Green tea latte was too bitter for my taste cause I like it sweet.

Well no need to fear because the boyf and I just held onto the box and leaned over like two hungry kids and devoured them in 15 seconds. Ordered the guava churro, but this wasn't my first time here.

DESSERT: i got the plain sugar dusted churros with the spanish hot chocolate for dipping and it was just perfect! The chocolate in the little cup is not too sweet and it also helps with the hard crunch that you get from the churro. Right when you dip the churro is soaks the chocolate up and softens the texture.

We'll...they were so undercooked it was closer to being a raw dish that was placed under the broiler for a moment to toast the tops but the inners where absolutely uncooked. Not a dish to serve raw because that particular vegetable is a difficult one to get through in an uncooked state. The flavor was uninspired, lack of carmel, no deep flavor at all and not even salt which may have made up for the lack of POV. Yellow Tail Crudo ;Bland beyond belief. Cauliflower :Again...same exact issues as the Brussels Sprouts. Extremely under cooked and then touted on top without any understanding that the previous process was not properly completed . Flavor was better than the Brussels sprouts but not exciting in any stretch. Sea Bass: It may have been a decent dish had the others had any potential. Panna Cotta: HOLY CRAP!!!!!! what a mess. First...they serve it in a mason jar assuming that they make this once a week and store it until some customer orders it and then they pull that puppy out of storage and then top it with berries so that you cannot access the body of the dish so we were forced to pull all of the berries off of the top of this small meson jar and then attempt to engage the panna cotta and go back to grabbing the removed berries to make for a proper mix. Who comes up with such foolish serving techniques. Lets got to the actual body of the dish. It was thick and a total lack of understanding what this desert needs to be. It was no more than thick sweet cow lard. It was my last attempt to locate a positive result with the food at this place that has taken a total nose dive. I used to love this place and could only get room at the counter to grab well developed farror and roared vegetable dishes. This place was well over 1/2 empty and for excellent reason. It is a poor poor excuse for a restaurant and it needs to go away. I am not sorry for this review. It displays lazy food and terrible management. We did not complain, I was too pissed to do so and did not feel the need to teach the management. It was a long difficult week and I was simply interested in going to a well proven haunt that I had enjoyed in the past. Well...that was then and this is now. NEVER to go back."], ["Linda C.", "Came here last weekend with reservations to celebrate a birthday. \u00a0We were immediately seated outside, but it was a pretty hot day so we asked if we could move to a different spot, luckily they had a nice table indoors ready. \u00a0Came here wanting to try the crab hash but they said they don't have it anymore but that the corned beef hash was its' substitute. \u00a0The corned beef hash was really good. \u00a0The beef was marinated for hours supposedly and you could really taste the great flavor in it. \u00a0My fianc\u00e9 loved that. \u00a0I got the smoked salmon benedict for myself with fries. \u00a0Loved the thin cut fries. \u00a0The smoked salmon benedict was decent overall, didn't really like how everything ate pretty mushy/soggy. \u00a0I usually get benedicts so I'm pretty used to the texture but this one wasn't one of the best for sure. \u00a0Loved the $8 bottomless mimosas, that's why Barbrix deserves the 4 stars in my opinion. \u00a0It's a pretty good deal, of course it's $8 only with the purchase of a $12 or more entree. \u00a0Usually when I find a deal on bottomless mimosas it usually comes with slow service and/or attitude. \u00a0The server was quick and attentive, always coming around to make sure our glasses were full. \u00a0The downfall of Barbrix, one restroom for the ladies and one for the gents...with bottomless mimosas, calls for frequent visits to the restroom. \u00a0For the birthday boy was a coffee like drink with ice cream in it... when the bill came, we were charged $9 for it. \u00a0We asked about it and I guess there is no complimentary anything for birthdays, would have been nice if they had told us that when we told them it was someone's birthday, we probably would have skipped it and gone elsewhere for dessert. \u00a0A lot of restaurants do a little something for birthdays, so I guess we were disappointed and letdown in that aspect. \u00a0Also, I hope they take care of their fly situation near the windows, they were going crazy during our meal since we were sitting near the curtains."], ["Everett B.", "Brunch stop #2 on our guys trip, we were drawn by the delicious looking food and the bottomless mimosas. Barbrix did not disappoint. This would be a regular place of mine if I lived in LA. The long and short of it.1. Crab Hash. My favorite out of everything everyone ordered (not my order..... Food envy ensued). They did not skimp on the crab, which was fresh and full of flavor. A close 2nd was the smoked salmon Benedict, which was absolutely delicious. Everything served tasted super fresh.2. Bottomless Mimosas. The real reason we came here. Bottomless drinks can be daunting when a large group such as ours orders them but our stellar bartender Christian always made sure our glasses were full of some pretty strong morning booze. Hats off to that man.3. Kicking Us Out. Hear me out here, as I'm actually considering this a plus. We managed to get cut off from bottomless mimosas by the owner (maybe manager? I was pretty drunk). This is the kind of hardline management of your customers you want in a popular place. In short we were far too drunk and were probably starting to annoy other customers. They made the right decision to take the drinks out of our hands and move us along to our next adventure.4. Price. Everything is a pretty standard brunch price with above average quality food. Everything in LA is a bit pricy so it was nice to find an adequately priced place.Our experience with Barbrix was brief, yet well deserving of a good rating. Stop by for some crab and mimosa brunch, just maybe take an Uber home!Overall Grade: A"], ["Mickey H.", "My review below is for brunch only: The real main reason why I decided to dine here for Brunch is because of their $8 bottomless mimosas. \u00a0I thought that was pretty awesome, as long as you order a minimum $12 entr\u00e9e, you're set! Food was mediocre but the ambience, vibe and their wonderful service/accommodation to seat our party in their outdoor patio during their busiest of times should be recognized. Our wait staff was super sweet and she attended our needs. Our glass was never empty so we definitely got our bang for the buck with this brunch deal. I ordered their frittata which is this egg pancake shape dish that contained broccoli, cherry tomatoes, burrata cheese and shishito peppers. It was good but it's definitely not something to rave about. Valet is $6 but I always end up finding parking outside along the streets. Oh, I also heard about their $1 HH oyster Monday night specials and Thursday pasta-palooza deals. \u00a0I'll have to come back again and try out their HH oysters soon!"], ["Hannah K.", "Breakfast here was okay, but the food at dinner was really good- balanced cheese plates with great variety, lots of tried and true appetizers with their own little twist on them; and the atmosphere is nice- dim candle lighting and no pretentious vibes. Even though they are a wine bar, there are plenty of other interesting drinks to try.Service felt off both times I visited Barbrix. At dinner the wait staff started off overly attentive then disappeared for longer periods of time, forgetting to bring us items we asked for, like water. I thought this was likely because of they get busy during their Monday oyster bar happy hour, but when I visited again for breakfast and we arrived about 5 minutes earlier than their opening time, the hostess was clearly annoyed that we were there early.I really wanted to like this place, but it's just okay. Overall it isn't absolutely terrible, but there are plenty of other similar options in LA with better service."], ["Louisa B.", "$5 Bottomless mimosa's for brunch!!!! I feel like that's all I need to say!Just kidding...GREAT food as well. I have been about three times now for brunch and it's definitely a must try place if you're looking for a brunch spot in Silver Lake. It's on Hyperion, easy access, valet parking lot, but you can easily find street parking. I've gotten the tomato, avocado and cilantro scramble which was good. The frittata I ordered another time and enjoyed it. My roommate always gets the dungeness crab hash and RAVES about it - but I can never seem to eat crab in the morning... But back to the bottomless mimosa's, they really are the definition of bottomless. The best part about Barbrix brunch is you don't really need to flag down the waiter, the service is great! They constantly re-fill your champagne glass and are ready to take your order at the right moment. It can get very crowded for brunch though! I'm planning on going to try their dinner menu soon - or even $1 oyster's at the bar on Monday nights."], ["Linette F.", "The ambiance and the food definitely rocked my world! A hidden gem in this neighborhood definitely!pork & ricotta meatballs- sounds simple and plain, but oh golly, these were just divine. The savoriness of the cheese complimented the ripe tomato sauce poured over the rich meatballs. The spring flavor of the fresh tomatoes just made your mouth perk up. Devils on Horseback- literally the name of this dish lives up to your expectations. I have never been a fan of goat cheese, so to try the \"whipped\" goat cheese, I was even more hesitant! HOLY COW! This dish was amazing. The saltiness of the bacon wrapped over the sweetness of the date was just the best combination. To top it off, the light whipped goat cheese was the cherry to the icing. You almost feel like a burst of flavors exploding in your mouth. hamachi crudo- Not sure why I ordered this, but don't. It's really not that great. You get two pieces of hamachi, which had a slight smell to it. The mango pieces were a unique balance to this dish. The chili oil was interesting, and I was thoroughly too impressed with this dish.....try something else I would say. Hams of the world- of course you have to get this....it's a little bit of everything. My favorite was the proscuitto and the speck. 3 Cheeses- ashlyn, pecorino marzolino rosso, brillat savarin: These were the top three cheeses that were not as pungent. The dried figs were so delicious. and there wines....Man, I love a good Italian/ Spanish Wine. I love it here. The service could have been a little bit more on par, but perhaps they were busy."], ["Byron S.", "We came here for brunch on Sunday without a reservation. You can only sit at the bar without a reservation. The bar is pretty big and serves the whole menu, but we had to wait 45 minutes for a seat. This place is packed! I HIGHLY recommend reserving.The highlight is, of course, their $8 bottomless mimosas! They're very generous on the champagne and they're constantly refilling my glass. Almost the entire restaurant ordered this!The food was good too. My gf and I shared the crispy brussel sprouts. It was deliciously crispy and the grated ricotta cheese on top wasn't overwhelming. The bits of cheese just melts in your mouth. It is really oily though so I wouldn't recommend it if you're not sharing because it gets too much after a few bites.I also had their burger. It was big and juicy, but they charged me for tomato ($2) without indicating that it would be extra on the menu. The shoestring fries were great, we ate the whole plate of them.We also got the wild boar bratwurst as a side. Very flavorful and spiced. \u00a0Comes on a small bed of arugula."], ["Marie C.", "After hiking we decided we wanted to reward ourselves.

I want it more. So Marie C. makes reservations a week in advance so that we can hit this place up after our hike. Never having been a drinker, bottomless mimosas don't do it for me. Brunch on the other hand is my favorite meal of the week. But when such an in demand hot spot like Barbrix fails on that end. Well.. for shame.I ordered the french toast with berry compote on the side. Just your average run of the mill french toast.. like a bit better than Dennys. Am I missing something here? Did Barbrix reimagine the french toast and i'm not hip enough to see/taste the difference? Maybe it was gluten free toast battered in certified organic chicken eggs and non GMO berry compote the likes of which my unsophisticated palate can't discern. Probably not. Bf got eggs and bacon which I dont think the amount of food warranted 12 bucks but lets go with it. Friends ordered sandwiches with fries. Those fries.. should just start calling them chips. Those mimosas.. should just start calling them OJ in a fancy cup. I understand some places never get generous with their cheap ass champagne but Barbrix put the S in shiesty. We sat in the patio section so I could see the line starting to build. BTW we came by after a hike, in our tanks and sneaks. Talk about being underdressed. Everyone was dressed to the 9's in their Sunday fineries in order to see and be seen. They get 2 stars for being dog friendly."], ["Kait F.", "Everything was meh.

A group of my friends came for Sunday brunch and managed to get a long table out on the patio. They have an $8 bottomless mimosa deal which we definitely got our money's worth! I got their Breakfast Sandwich ($14) which comes with fried eggs, cheddar, ham, bacon, grilled onions, and lemon aioli on a ciabatta roll. It was good, but nothing special. I took a bite of my friend's Honey Lavender Panna Cotta w/ fresh strawberries ($8)-- it was really good! Not too sweet or heavy and just the right amount of lavender flavor. Service was OK-- they took a long time to bring out my coffee to the point where I thought they forgot and we had to keep asking for hot sauce because no one seemed to understand what we were asking for, but they were good about refilling our glasses-- both water and mimosas, lol.

A glass of wine averages $13....so unless you're a big, big fan of wine, I'd skip this place (I like wine, but I don't know enough about it to really appreciate a $15 glass of wiine). Nonetheless, a friend and I were looking forward to some awesome tapas because the reviews seemed decent. I think my favorite things here were the brussel sprouts and the bacon wrapped dates. We also got the cheese plate...but this is only fun to get if you get wine. And the cheese plate is pricey too.I'd still come here again because it's really, really cute and their entrees on the menu looked delicious (and perhaps even worth the price).

I'll maybe even stop by for happy hour since it runs Sunday-Thursday and isn't too far from me.One more con: service. My friend and I walked in without a reservation and the hostess seemed annoyed that we wanted to sit outside when the place wasn't even packed.

I also forgot to mention there were 4 of us. Our waitress gave us the option to add a 4th which of course we did. I jus wish I would've known it was going to cost an extra $3! Yikes. They were good but at $13?? I'm afraid not.The [Brioche French Toast-3 Berry Compote] was also very yummy but I was so sad to see that it only came with 2 slices and no side dish for $12. Kind of steep but I guess its the going rate for a brunch entree.[Service] was good. Our waitress was attentive, friendly, and patient.

It was one of, if not the first small plates offering in the neighborhood and has been able to remain relevant since its opening in 2009I have not been in years & went on a lark half expecting an eatery in decline - only to find a lively, vibrant scene - with food to match the atmosphere. They have bar seats in the back that overlook the kitchen that are usually open, they are not particularly intimate, but for people who love food it beats any IMAX in town. There kitchen is tight (if not a bit mechanical) under the strict efficient observation of Don. The menu tends toward a mediterranean foundation - and flavors do not journey far into the unknown - but scallops were among the most tender I have ever had, and tuna carpaccio was paired with flavors that took it to great places. Be warned - you can easily double (or more) your bill on their well crafted wine list... There is a reason that Barbarix \u00a0is still packed on a saturday night. Menu: Ahi tuna carpaccio - 3.5*: The tuna could of been better but the blend of oranges/seaweed salad/ & pickles were fantastic. Ricciolina bay scallops 4.5* : Scallops were perfect, the dish was rich & favor was dominated by garlic - \u00a0but not overwhelming.

What I did really enjoy was the burratta salad w/ proscuitto. Very light and fresh.

I was surprised that each glass was to my liking. \u00a0My friend and I started off at the communal table while we waited to be seated. We shared the bacon wrapped dates, baby broccolini and burrata focaccia, and the chicken liver toast. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the broccolini focaccia. It was probably an hour before we were seated on the outside patio which is absolutely gorgeous. They have lights up and it feels like you're dining in a beautiful garden. For our entrees, we shared the Spanish fried chicken and the squid ink black rice. Both were very delicious. I didn't think I had room for dessert until the panna cotta with Meyer lemon sorbet fell on my tongue and I was secretly hoping my friend would let me eat the entire thing. I wanted to lick the plate afterwards. For brunch, I shared the chicken and waffle, corn beef hash, and brioche with gyruere and prosciutto. All were disappointing with the expedition of then chicken. The chicken is fried and the same as the Spanish fried chicken for dinner. The brioche is just an open faced sandwich with cheese and prosciutto. \u00a0The corned beef hash wasn't exciting either and came out cold. I had high expectations after my dinner experience here.

Friends ordered some drinks and a salad as well as steak/fries dish. They seemed to enjoy and we're happy. \u00a0For desert we shared a pastry filled with sorbet and covered with cream and fruit.

Good but nothing amazing. Gruy\u00e8re omelet was a little disappointing. It would have been better had there been some vegetables in the omelet. \u00a0Also, the accompanying potatoes did nothing for me. \u00a0I think they would have benefited from a sauce or something drizzled on top of them. Also, the dish came with 2 thick, delicious slices of bread. While they were good (i mean, it's bread. \u00a0When is bread NOT good, right?) they didn't feel like they went with the meal. There was no sauce on this plate to dip the bread in & they did not even serve it with butter so it felt like it didn't go. Kumquat & blood orange bellini was pretty good but not $14 good. For a cocktail I'd be more understanding of paying the premium but for a bellini it's not worth it in my opinion.Overall was it good? \u00a0Yes. \u00a0Was it great? \u00a0No.I should say that the ambiance is fantastic & I imagine it's a wonderful choice for dinner.

My friend got the corned beef hash with looked super tasty and the eggs were cooked to perfection. I had the chicken and waffle. The chicken was plentiful, super moist with the right hint of paprika flavor. It was also coated in some type of maple syrup which made it super tasty. \u00a0The waffle was soft and a bit thinner then I had expected. The only thing I would have changed is maybe providing a side of honey or syrup, because i felt like my waffle could have used some directly on it instead of just on the chicken.Overall super tasty food and good service!"], ["Jane L.", "I would give this place a 4.5.

It's a great atmosphere and the wait staff are super attentive. Lunch menu is a bit simple. Focaccia, sandwiches, a pretty awesome burger, a few ok appetizers. Pretty much a carb lovers anti-Atkins menu. \u00a0The only blunder with the meal we had was the arugula salad (check the picture). Overly salty and way too much lemon. It came out half wilted and by the time we tried it, it was pretty much pickled. The Sheep cheese was awesome (cheese plate but I ate it before we could take a postable pic. \u00a0 The medium rare burger was really rare but I like raw meat so it wasn't an issue. Everything was ok to pretty good. Make sure to get seated outside. That's what this restaurant is good for. A great patio that takes you out of the busy LA streets and into a relaxing (maybe a bit tight) space. \u00a0Not a fan of the $6 or $8 valet parking because there's pretty much no other option. The street parking is always full. \u00a0On a side note, this group has really awesome cookbooks."], ["Sage S.", "A strong showing for brunch.AOC is a beautiful wine and cheese bar that serves gourmet and not overpriced food. AOC, as explained to me by the waiter, is a professional designation in France that certifies excellent quality wine and cheese. It's not clear to me that this restaurant has earned such a distinguishment, or rather just takes its name from it. We went for Sunday brunch this last weekend, and we all thoroughly enjoyed everything about this place. We arrived at 10:00am sharp--right when it opened--so there was no wait for a table. We also got a spot seated in between the restaurant and the covered patio--the best spot in the house owing to the fact that we could enjoy both the indoor and outdoor scene of the place.But now, the food. You MUST order the grilled blueberry bread. WOW. The grilled blueberry bread made the experience for me, honestly. We got an order of the blueberry bread to share among the three of us--two pieces per person--and it was extremely delicious. Though grilling blueberry bread sounds like an eccentric way to prepare a sweet bread dish, it added just the right amount of contrasting flavor. Throw some butter on that baby, and you got yourself a winning dish.For the main meal, I ordered the Spanish fried chicken and cornmeal waffle, as one does at this place (apparently). The fried chicken had a very unique taste--it was sweet, savory, and had strong herbal undertones. I enjoyed it very much. It was also a lot of food--I couldn't finish the meal.I also had a chance to try my friend's brioche. It, too, exceeded expectations. I loved the tangy flavor of the greens matched with the [bacon? thin pork belly?] and fried egg. I would probably order this over the Spanish fried chicken and waffle, honestly.Altogether, AOC is a wonderful spot for brunch. If you can make it early enough before it gets too crowded, it makes for a very nice experience.My only quibble point is the limited brunch and breakfast menu--I'm sure they serve mimosas, but we didn't see it on the brunch menu. Just like we didn't see the coffee they served us on the brunch menu.Parking is a pain--I had to leave halfway through my fried chicken and waffle to put money in the 30 minute meter. Don't park in the neighborhood! It's permit only. A good bet is to park on Robertson, if there is street parking available."], ["Sarah S.", "Things I love about dinner at AOC:1.Intimate and beautiful patio lit by candles and fireplace, with olive trees that make you feel like you are in the Mediterranean2.Friendly and knowledgeable host and wait staff3.Declious small plates served in cast iron pans - try the farro and kale salad, all of the vegetables, the spanish fried chicken with romesco aoli and the roast chicken to share with crispy panzanellaEnjoy it all with a big red in a big glass (and a great companion).Done."], ["Jam Y.", "AOC ranks really high in my book, and I'm a super big fan of theirs for the reason that they're operating a restaurant that brings about a lot to the table, both literally and figuratively. Food, location, ambiance, and service. Those four elements. Practically perfect on all counts, down to the T. Smoooooth operator. If I were ever to start up my own restaurant, I'd imagine it to fall along the lines of this exact restaurant.... with an outcome of premature aging and panic attacks, since the restaurant biz is not for the faint-hearted, and I most certainly am not competent in coping with such chaos. Food: During my first trip, I didn't think the famed Spanish fried chicken was anything spectacular, and the romesco aioli had a curiously strange consistency where the texture was gelatinous and stubborn making it impossible to dip into as it refused to budge. To top it off, the aioli was completely flavorless and served no purpose to the dish, which definitely needed it seeing as though the chicken, despite its deep and alluring tone in color, was also flavorless and mostly banal.Didn't love the Arroz negro with squid and saffron aioli either, but I don't usually like seafood, and since this dish wasn't my choice to begin with, my opinions on it should be ruled out.The Duck confit was amazing! They cooked it soooooo well, and it must've been one of the best renditions of duck confit I've ever had! It was served with black rice, fresh and aromatic mizuna, blood orange butter and skinned blood oranges. Put together, it was incredibly tender and savory with a mild touch of sweetness and acidity that came from the juicy fruit. Delicious!We also ordered the Squash blossoms that were stuffed with, not just any old ricotta, but with brown butter ricotta (appreciating that simple, yet ingenious ka-pow), deep fried, then drizzled with honey with the finishing touches of thoughtfully sprinkled chunks of hazelnuts. UGH! Need I say more? Order it!Because 2/4 dishes were misses, I had deemed my first experience to be lukewarm.. until I went again!This is getting too long. Quickly...Second trip, ordered the:-- Vinter's plate (rillettes, cheese, cured meats, gherkins, roasted grapes and THICK slices of grilled toasts). This should be just as obligatory to order as the Squash blossoms. Great combination. Salty meats, creamy cheese, tangy accompaniments all tied together with a buttery toast... an amazing segue to your coming courses.-- Bacon-wrapped dates. Really sweet, but not bad.-- Focaccia (fig, prosciutto, taleggio, walnuts, and saba). Thinking back on it, you MUST order this one too on top of everything else I think is a must haha. Just order it, the portion is tiny, and one bite in, you're going wish it was bigger.-- Pork belly with roasted romano beans, romesco and marconas. The overall flavor of this blend of ingredients was tasty, I thought. Nutty and rich. My only gripe with it was that all both of us really got was the fat. Not that I minded the fat, but that it just lacked the balance.-- Hanger steak with Roquefort butter and shallot rings. Tender, hearty, good.Besides the food,--Location - convenient, easy to find, valet offered.--Ambiance/decor - A little on the upscale side of the spectrum by like a slight nudge, but in no way pretentious. (The patio is beautiful, and the second floor is more close-knit and colonial-ish) Ambiguous, gentle and pleasantly paced music playing in the background that accommodates conversations, so no need to shout. It easily gets diffused out. A huge plus in my book.--Service. Not snooty, nor uptight. Attention to details, naturally friendly vibes, not over-bearing and in-my face. It was as if they weren't even there, all the while meeting our needs in the suavest manner. Very easy-going, and above all, it was a peaceful dinner where the arrival of each dish was on point in terms of timing and overseeing, never feeling rushed nor delayed and..... just allocating a calm and perfect mood for dining in."], ["Jennifer R.", "Full disclosure: I am pre-prejudiced. I am a big Suzanne Goin fan! Tavern is right up the street from me, and I love to go there. Been to Lucques and had been to AOC once before...great experiences all. Now, of course these places are pricey, so they are typically more \"special occasion\" meals for me, although I really appreciate the effort made with the Larder at Tavern to be a bit more accessible price-wise. That said, I REALLY wanted to love this visit so much that I could give a 5. But, a few things fell short.Let's start with the meal. There were three of us, one ordered the \"mock goddess\" green tea beverage - she said it was amazing, refreshing and quite flavorful. For food starters, the bacon-wrapped dates were Mouth-Watering! But, they are SO GOOD, you just want MORE...not enough in that little dish. I REALIZE it's called a \"snack\" on the menu, but I could eat them ALL DAY!Next we shared the Spanish fried chicken. I really enjoyed it. There was a good bit of spice on it, and definitely the flavor of Madrid. It was a well-composed opening-round. Then we got the main affair. One of us went with the farmer's lunch. It comes cold. I think it would maybe be a bit better if the veggies were warm, but that's me. the highlight of this dish is the muhammara. I know, I didn't know what it was either. It's a dip. Just trust me. It's really good!Another went with the roast turkey sandwich. He reported it was quite good. I tried some of his fries - they were cooked perfectly. For my meal, the focaccias - house-made lamb bacon, laura chenel ch\u00e8vre & braised leeks - sounded fantastic. How could one go wrong with lamb or bacon? Well, you can go REALLY WRONG apparently with lamb bacon. It was WAY too fatty and tasted like mush. There was TOO MUCH chevre on there, and the braised leeks should have been cut into shorter bite-sized pieces, as it was, I kept getting huge slabs of it that I couldn't bit along with the crust. Sadly, though it was well-cooked - crispy - the crust wasn't even great, it had a hint of sourdough-ness to it, and that is not my style...This focaccia was a \"fail\" in my book. Sadly.Finally, the service was good, but not great. At these prices, I think you have to live up to a higher standard - best service, best food. The valet was super nice. The hostess was super nice. Our waiter was nice enough, but not super helpful. When asked \"what's torchio\" his answer was \"pasta\"...no explanation of what sort of pasta - is it short or long, more of a noodle or a twist, is it hollow, or solid, no more information was provided. When asked \"how big is the focaccia, is it like a pizza, is it big enough for one person for lunch?\" he struggled to demonstrate the size and it turned out his example was WAY smaller than the actual item. He was not as \"on it\" as I would expect here...the server we had for dinner the first time was AMAZINGLY helpful. Our server this round, not so much.So, I go with the \"4\" - I debated \"3\" - but definitely falls well short of a \"5,\" disappointingly."], ["Emily G.", "If I could give more than five stars, this would be the time to do it.

I'm proud of myself for reaching such a lofty number of reviews. \u00a0It's been great fun, and I have enjoyed every minute of sharing my findings......onward, I go.Tonight, we dined at A.O.C., which was also for my hubby's 'n my wedding anniversary.... so, that's another celebration revolving around this particular review. \u00a0However, I heave a rather heavy sigh as I state that A.O.C. let me down. \u00a0I didn't really like it, to be perfectly honest. \u00a0I expected and wanted that blissful state of moaning and groaning over the amazing flavors of the food prepared for me. \u00a0I simply did not get it. \u00a0With anything. \u00a0I expected far more from a restaurant of this caliber, fame, and popularity.While it's an attractive restaurant, especially the patio area, the chairs (at least at the indoor tables where we sat) were VERY UNcomfortable. \u00a0The kind of chair that is wood backing and bottom, without cushion, comfort or coverage. \u00a0Even their booths, which we had the option of dining in, looked stiff and unappealing. \u00a0Honestly, the patio looked to be the most comfortable (hindsight is 20/20), but it's been so disgustingly humid these days, I wasn't interested to dine al fresco, even at night with the sun gone. \u00a0Humidity is there 24/7. \u00a0Dammit.While other Yelpers have complained of the wait staff being less than decent, WE found them to be delightful. \u00a0Smiling, kind, concerned about our dining experience, we had no problems. \u00a0We waited a bit in between each dish brought, but honestly, I liked that. \u00a0I HATE when several dishes are brought at once...... it's too much, too fast, so this way, it gave us time to digest a bit, and we didn't have to feel rushed. \u00a0All that was just fine to me.So, now for the dishes. \u00a0Here's what I've found over the years. \u00a0IF the food I'm eating makes me happy, makes me blissful, makes me moan and/or groan with pleasure, I know I have hit pay dirt........ and I know that all the money I'm pouring out for this state of perfection, I'm happy to shell out. \u00a0Tonight, we shelled out our hard earned money for just okay food. \u00a0It wasn't good, it wasn't bad. \u00a0It just was. \u00a0It had flavor, but minimal flavor at that, and not necessarily flavors I enjoyed. \u00a0It had texture, but nothing making me say \"wow!\" \u00a0Last year, we dined at Jose Andres' The Bazaar, another small plates venue, and my husband and I are STILL talking about that dining experience, and we remember VIVIDLY what we ate. \u00a0It had THAT kind of impression on us. \u00a0A.O.C. does not hold a candle to that place AT ALL. \u00a0A.O.C.'s dishes SOUND good, but here's what we experienced...1. \u00a0 Focaccia - summer squash, gruy\u00e8re, pecorino & salsa verde - probably the dish with the most...and best flavor, but it was too greasy.2. \u00a0 Kampachi crudo, citrus, marcona almonds, avocado & fennel - Just items on a dish, didn't work together.3. \u00a0 Tuna meatballs, spiced tomato sauce, kumquats, mint & pea shoots - different, and probably a little too spicy for me, but meatballs had good flavor. \u00a04. \u00a0 Stuffed squash blossoms, brown butter ricotta, honey & hazelnuts - ricotta very bland. \u00a0Hazelnuts just there...... didn't add to the dish. \u00a0Squash blossoms perfectly cooked, but no real flavor.5. \u00a0 Spanish fried chicken, romesco a\u00efoli & chili-cumin butter - overly fried chicken, ultra greasy, didn't love the flavor of the chicken, aioli or butter.6. \u00a0 Hanger steak, roquefort butter & shallot rings - steak good but nothing great, could have done without the roquefort butter. We didn't even want dessert. \u00a0Between the chair issue and not feeling wow'd by our meal, we just didn't want to spend even more money. \u00a0We spent approx. $150 to be underwhelmed. \u00a0Again, it wasn't bad food, but it wasn't amazing either. \u00a0I'm sorry to have a less than raving commentary for my 1,000th review, but I pride myself on my honest approach to writing. \u00a0This was my experience, and I simply expected more. \u00a0Sorry, A.O.C."], ["Hailey C.", "This is my hoooood!

I paired the sandwich with some wonderful fries, washed it down with and iced tea and butterscotch for dessert. All of the above were absolutely fantastic and the service was on point.

The cocktails on the list are $10, as opposed to $14, and some of their options are $3-4 cheaper, which can definitely add up! If you like a variety of menu options, definitely start out at the happy hour area and move to the dining area to maximize your experience.FOODBacon-wrapped dates ($5 - HH): This was pretty raved about in the reviews below, but let me just warn you and say the serving size of this appetizer was literally laughable. The six bacon wrapped dates came in a ketchup serving container size. [Look at my picture for reference]. I've never had bacon wrapped dates that I didn't like, and this is a great way to start out your meal for $5.Spanish fried chicken ($10 - HH): Should this be called Indian fried chicken? I swear, the flavoring on this chicken tasted like Indian herbs. Anyway, the chicken was very flavorful and really didn't need aioli/butter dip on the side. The chicken was not too oily, but so flavorful that I wished there was some sort of bread to balance out the flavors.Brioche with prosciutto/gruy\u00e8re/egg ($14): This mountain is essentially a giant salad on topped with an egg sitting on a bed of perfectly crisp, but soft, brioche bread. I did like the variation of textures and flavors on this dish, but I didn't think anything about the dish was TO DIE FOR.DRINKSPistolero ($10 - HH): This cocktail was really good! I honestly cannot drink any form of tequila after college, but the honey, lemon, and ginger really made the drink taste more like a whiskey and the flavors worked really well.Green goddess ($14): This drink was really refreshing, like a summer day.SERVICEFrom Happy Hour seating at the communal table by the bar to our dining table that we had set with a reservation, we had great service with friendly bartenders and waitresses. My cocktail had a dead fly in it, and my waitress made sure I was brought a new drink right away and kept apologizing about it.

The patio is an oasis in the middle of the city. Whether it's for a bridal/ baby shower, special occasion or for no reason at all, AOC continually exceeds expectations.The service is always great. I've been here when it's packed and service never fails. It's nice to see restaurants with consistent staff that have been there for years. Weekend brunch/ lunch is one of the best. Don't skip the bacon wrapped dates. You can pinpoint the trend starting here. They're very addictive and very temperature hot. (Be aware before popping one in your mouth)Chicken and waffles in a kicked up gourmet level are so good.

The hostess led us up in their wine room and we were seated at a window seat with an awesome view overlooking the restaurant below. We were the only ones to be seated there for a good while so we felt extra special with a whole room and servers to ourselves.Our server was extremely attentive and pleasant. For the dishes he recommended that we ordered 2-3 small dishes per person, so we ordered the arugula salad, sherry garlic clams, spanish fried chicken, farro and black rice, and duck crepinette. All 5 dishes were great, I would have to say the spanish fried chicken was the winner if I had to pick. Perfectly seasoned and crispy on the outside and oh so juicy on the inside. Dip in it the accompanied sauce and mmmmm.I had stuffed my face just a couple hours earlier at Eveleigh and now here I was stuffing my face all over again, yikes! For drinks, I ordered the moonraker. It was really good, very refreshing with lots of fruit notes. For dessert, we got the chocolate torte with candied nuts and a coffee cream.

We wanted to order a side of fries and our server confidently mentioned that my Hanger Steak dish came with fries...except it says potatoes on the menu, but we trusted she knew the menu better than we did. Well, sure enough, she was wrong. No fries.We ordered the Bacon-Wrapped Dates and the Fig, Prosciutto, Taleggio, Walnuts, and Saba Focaccia to start. Both were cooked well and tasted great.We opted for the breakfast choices and although the rest of my party thought the dishes were good, I thought it was average, forgettable, and underwhelming. However, the other two in my group agreed that it wasn't a restaurant they would go out of their way to revisit. It would be more out of convenience when in the area. The dishes lacked a wow factor and left my taste buds wanting more!Spanish Fried Chicken & Cornmeal Waffle: the cornmeal waffle was a bit on the soggy side. The fried chicken actually tasted decent with the right seasoning and crunch. I definitely wouldn't be able to eat this entire dish myself as I was already sick of it after a couple of bites.House-made Corned Beef Hash: the beef was a bit on the dry side though it was seasoned well.Hanger Steak and Eggs: the hanger steak is cooked medium rare and it was my mistake that I missed the fact that it was topped with a tapenade, which I hate. I hate olives. It was supposed to come with roasted baby artichokes and I literally had two on my plate but plenty of bland potatoes to fill more than half my plate! The sunny side up eggs were cooked well with a little crisp on the outer edges, which I appreciated. The steak was good, but everything together was just okay.We asked for a side of either ketchup or aioli for my extremely bland and lackluster potatoes. A server suggested aioli and as a fellow Yelper pointed out, it had a strange consistency not reminiscent of the texture of a normal aioli. It was a bit gelatinous, tasteless, and off putting. The mouth feel was not appealing and almost plastic-y. We ended up having to ask for ketchup as well.This establishment has a lot of rave reviews, but the further I delve into it, the more it seems that everyone is generally unsatisfied with AOC's breakfast/brunch items and execution and more happy with the dinner and tapas options."], ["Peter I.", "In a word...pretentious.

Wine list is still one of the best and had some great Malbec that was smooth and well priced. The food was OK, nothing stood out. Cheese plate was good and the Spanish Fried Chicken was chicken strips. Nothing Spanish about them.

For my main dish, I had the lentil salad with shrimp. It was delicious! I got my dressing on the side, and I didn't even need it -- the salad was already so flavorful! My boss had the artic char, which he loved. It had couscous and grilled nectarine. I might have to try that next time! My 2 coworkers had the cheeseburger and the farmer's lunch plate.

A.O.C. is a tapas style restaurant and right away they asked if I had been before then explained how the menu works and suggested 2-3 plates to fill me up. I had such a great service the whole time I was there - don't think I've ever had a better service! Each time I emptied my water glass there was someone to quietly fill it up; something that was needed in this heat! Very attentive and caring staff who actually felt like they enjoy their job. I started off with their bacon wrapped dates which were a divine way to start my meal - sweet and savoury colliding in one glorious bite. I followed it up with their stuffed zucchini blossoms - something which I have never tried before. This was my 'naughty' choice of the evening, a choice I made as I have wanted to try stuffed zucchini blossoms for such a long time! They didn't disappoint; stuffed with a browned butter ricotta filling, deep fried and topped with honey and hazelnuts. I was definitely not disappointed! A great first experience - they were so tasty! The sweet zucchini flavour paired with the creamy and buttery ricotta with the hazelnut and honey meal to finish off was gorgeous. I finished off my meal with a classic favourite - pork belly! This pork belly was served with charred green beans, a curry paste and roasted almonds. The pork itself was melt in your mouth, buttery and perfectly cooked. The beans were tender and flsvoursome. I wasn't too sure on the curry but it did work - especially with the crunchy crisp almonds. Superb food, excellent service and a must visit if in LA."], ["Wendy W.", "SO many things about AOC to love.The restaurant space is absolutely beautiful, from the nice outdoor dining patio to the open air indoor space and the beautiful wood and bar. The atmosphere is also great--waiters are attentive and check up on you frequently (but not to the point at which it becomes annoying), and you can see many a couple or a group of friends chatting it up at a table.My friend and I shared the blueberry bread with lemon butter, and we were astounded by the freshness of the bread and the delicate, yet noticeable presence of the fruit aromas. She also ordered the brioche with prosciutto, and I ordered the house-made corned beef hash. Both dishes came out plated beautifully and tasted amazing as well. Again, we could not get over the bread. We were so full at the end of our brunch, but still kept wanting to eat more.I think a good way to describe AOC is that every part of the experience is actually very simple, but they do the simple things exceptionally well. From something as ubiquitous as outdoor seating to a staple carb like bread, it's very apparent that there's something special about this restaurant."], ["Farrah S.", "Celebrated my birthday here last Friday - table of 12 women.

I have yet to try other items on the menu but I always get pupusas with my side drink called ensalada. I love the fact that their pupusas are varied and you can even mix other ingredients from other set pupusa orders. Although the food is phenomenal, service is extremely quite the opposite. I think the level of popularity of this place is what makes it hard for servers to adjust. We waited more than 35 minutes on orders of pupusas. I also saw a lot of people who were growing frustrated with either their order, not getting seated, or not even getting their order taken down. Highly suggest they revamp their service because after some time, it will start to lure customers out the door.

Wow!! I had the carne asada and queso along with the traditional queso and it was tasteful!!"], ["Brian M.", "Pupusas: Unfortunately, none of the pupusas came with the ubiquitous Salvadorian herb called Loroco, except for the plain Queso con Loroco, and the Revueltas. I had to ask for it to be added to the others at an extra charge, even then, they barely had any inside them. I understand that some people might not be a fan of this herb-it's actually the buds of a plant that only grows in El Salvador-but I, for one, expect it in all of the pupusas I eat. Even though I might have a few disappointments with a couple of their pupusas, it is not all bad. For $2, you get a pupusa that is quite larger than pupusas of any other place I've tried. One alone can almost cover your whole plate, depending on how large your plate is. I got full off of three of those suckers, and if you see me, you KNOW I can eat more than three regular sized pupusas.Revueltas- Although normally Revueltas have queso con loroco, chicharron (pork belly), and beans. These didn't have the latter, but still had a great flavor to them. Out of all the ones I've tried here, these were my favorite. I was able to taste the loroco in the cheese, as well as the tomato, peppers, and cumin in chicharron. When people see the chicharron before it goes into the masa, they think it's raw, ground pork because it looks slightly pinkish. This is not the case. It takes on that color because once it is fried, it is passed through a food mill along with bell peppers, garlic, onion, tomatoes, and salt/pepper/cumin S&P&C (HIMYM joke, but true) for flavor. So, once it has all been ground together, it takes on the reddish hue due to the added ingredients.Sopa De 7 Mares- The Salvadorian version of seafood Consomm\u00e9 that contains: crab, mussels, clams, octopus, white fish, shrimp, calamari, carrots, squash, with speckles of parsley strewn around. Rich broth with its succulent flavors that are uniquely balanced due to the variety of jewels from the sea added to this dish to elevate it to another level. You can never go wrong with a squeeze of lemon to add \u00a0a little more complexity to it.Aguas Frescas- These were some juices made from Central American fruits that most places I've been to did not have. Since these fruits, are not typically found in regular stores, you can find them in the frozen aisles of Latino markets.-Arrayan- Slightly acidic and tastes kind of like a blend between guava and a pear. Very refreshing, it is in the guava family, but more on the sour end of the spectrum.-Mara\u00f1on- A very sweet drink with chunks of the fruit floating in the glass as if frozen in time. You wouldn't have thought of it, but is actually made from the fruit of the cashew nut. The fruit is a bright orange color and naturally sweet, but too thick to be sucked through their straws.Even though they had a few downfalls with a few of their pupusas not being up to par, do not hold it against them- I'm sure they will take care of it. The rest of the food and drinks on the other hand, are well worth stopping by to at least try and get hooked on to keep coming back.If you want to see the full review, you can find it at: thechonchudofiles.wordpr\u2026goo.gl/6xEdCE"], ["Pablo R.", "Some of the best Salvadorian food I've had in a long time.

Amazing place overall"]], "Casa C\u00f3rdoba": [["Eunice C.", "A rather expensive way to get a taste of Spain's rich cuisine, but altogether an excellent representation of Spanish fare and tapas. When my family of 3 visited Casa C\u00f3rdoba, we decided to pull out all the stops and order a good number of items:Boquerones (anchovies in white vinegar), the house paella (with chicken, duck and chorizo), salmorejo, and a cheesy dish overlaid with an egg and served with small, hard bready crackers. Sorry, I don't remember the name but it's a popular item - ask your server. Overall fantastic, although the pricing does tickle me just a little bit.As a huge seafood lover, I enjoyed the boquerones. The anchovies were laid, whole for the most part, on top of bread with some rich cheese and perhaps other ingredients I'm forgetting. This is a very fishy dish and probably not for everyone. One dish provides six bites. The paella was everyone's favorite: Two pieces of meaty chicken, breast and thigh, overlaid a hot platter of yellowed rice, chorizo bits, and other delicious things. We ordered the one that serves 2 people and had no problem feeling relatively satisfied split amongst 3 diners. However, that's considering my family also ordered three tapa dishes.The cheesy dish was quite rich, and flat-out comfort food in the best way. When you dig in with your cracker, the egg splits open to introduce runny egg yolk into the rest of the dish. You can request for more crackers if needed.My only complaints would be that:1. The salmorejo was not what I've tried during my five months abroad in C\u00f3rdoba, Spain. Casa C\u00f3rdoba's salmorejo was reminiscent of chilled tomato puree with crumbled hard-boiled eggs and jam\u00f3n (ham) on top. Given, salmorejo probably can have many different interpretations depending on the chef, more watery or not. However, the ones I've grown to love would be the thicker salmorejo that has tomatoes, fresh crusty bread, garlic, and olive oil blended to a creamy smoothness and served cold, same garnishes on top. I was rather disappointed to find out that Casa C\u00f3rdoba's did not mimic that creaminess I sought. Nevertheless, it was good. I was a bit thrown off that the salmorejo was served in a small glass cup rather than a bowl, though.2. When my family requested dessert, we were informed that the restaurant is out of everything minus one item. While I understand that the items must be popular, especially the churros con chocolate, exactly for that reason it would be great if desserts did not run out rather early into the evening. Finally, the atmosphere is gorgeous. We sat at a table furthest from the outside entrance, surrounded by lush greenery, a fountain, a wall almost cinematically tressed with ivy and Christmas lights, and live Spanish guitar music from a musician tucked away in a corner. It was quite romantic and beautiful. My mother, like any happy non-Spaniard, ordered some sangria and admired the scenery. Without a doubt, Casa C\u00f3rdoba offers a wonderful experience reminiscent of Spain in many accounts.

We ordered the following tapas: fried eggplant, the jamon rolled asparagus, the calamari with squid ink sauce, and the octopus. The eggplant was my favorite. It was crispy and light, salty and sweet. The calamari was also some of the best calamari I have ever tasted (and calamari is my Italian husband's favorite thing in the world - so we know our calamari). The squid ink sauce was very unique. Not too salty, well balanced, and with the delightful surprise of tiny bits of pickled cucumber chopped up in it. I never ever would have imagined squid ink and pickle going together, but it was heavenly.The only thing that I thought was less than spectacular with the paella. It was still good, but just not phenomenal. The paella lacked enough saffron, and didn't get very crispy on the bottom of the pan. For the $40 we paid for the seafood paella, I would have much preferred spending it on a few more tapas.Oh, and the Sangria was easily the best Sangria I have ever had."], ["Evelina S.", "Saw this place many times and never went in there to try it out until recently. We went there for dinner and as I walked in I felt in love with the place. Seems like you are having a dinner in your backyard. The inside was cozy and gives you the home feeling. We started with few tapas (appetizer) which were delicious and then the main course which was to die for. The waiters was so sweet, unfortunately I don't recall her name. She helped us with the menu and was so patient with us. Another waiter Artin was very sweet as well, and he made quick check on our table to make sure we got everything. This is a place I will definitely go back, mainly in summer to enjoy that beautiful outdoor space and whenever Spain in playing."], ["Liz S.", "Minus one star only because they ran out of a menu item.

Coming in on a Sunday there was plenty of seating, we ordered the White and red Sangria to start both of which were excellent, with the perfect amount of carbonation.

Also the shrimp is very tasty. Entree: we got the caesar salad with shrimp, if I could go back I would probably have gotten the chicken but only because I don't like peeling legs off my shrimp lol.

The ambience was outstanding. We sat outside in the courtyard with the relaxing sound of the fountain. Spanish music could be heard wafting throughout the restaurant.

The jamon iberico is delicious along with their Spanish cheeses. The Spanish wine and cider selection is great. Having gone there a few times now I think I have tried the menu highlights and most everything was yummy. The only thing I wish was different is the Pann con Tomate. They serve the Tomate on think focaccia style bread and I am accustomed to it being served on thin crusty sliced of bread...,perhaps that is just this family recipe. Anyway, I recommend trying Casa C\u00f3rdoba Oh! And do not skip dessert!!"], ["Anne J.", "The one thing that I was really looking forward to was disappointing the seafood paella. The rice had no seafood flavor and kind of bland and the seafood was just lightly decorated on top. The mussels were so small it barely had no meat. The shrimps were decent size and fresh but only few. The fish was bland with no flavor and tiny. For a 40 dollar dish this is definitely overrated and the portion was so tiny that it shocked both my husband and I since this was for one person's portion not two. I felt like the chef was definitely being skimpy on ingredients so for the price I think it's not worth it.

As soon as I sat down, Noreen, the sommelier, came over. What a lovely woman! We ordered two glasses of wine and then our adventure began. My friend and i were in paradise.

Of course there are some places that claim to serve Spanish food, but none of them are designed for people who likes and expects great dishes, but for those who want to play the stereotype of eating paella. I have nothing against it, but since I love eating and I don't like to be teased, I have never gone back to those places. And then I found Smoke.oil.salt, a place where not only do you find paella (really good by the way) but also the type of food you would do in my country. And there is more good news: Chef Perfecto Rocher not only cooks well, but he is one of the most extraordinary chefs in town, which makes this place both a good spot for sentimental people like me and an excellent option for anyone who wants to have a great dinner. I'm a foodie, have been to Smoke.oil.salt. four times and every time was better than the last. Everything tastes great, but here I leave some of my favourites: braves trencades, llonganisses (homemade), bunyols the bacall\u00e0, polp a la brasa (actually, the only good octopus I have found in America), carn de vaca vella and carabineros. The desserts are also out of this world. Perfecto takes some of the most traditional Spanish ones and gives them a very interesting twist. Last time I ordered all of them because I simply couldn't pick one. \u00a0And if you still want to eat paella, don't hesitate. S.O.S. makes the best Spanish rice I have ever tried.

We would have asked to move, but after 40 minutes we simply couldn't wait any longer.As we began ordering, the noise was clearly an issue as our server spoke over us trying to ask questions and/or speak to her because she simply couldn't hear us.

Service was great - they are almost too present; you never have an empty glass of water, for even a second. We arrived early, and were told that we could hang out at the two empty chairs at the bar while we waited for the other two in our party to arrive. A gentleman, who I took to be the owner, quickly stepped up to offer us wine, water, etc. He was very friendly and chatty, told us about how he had tried 800 wines while determining the final list, etc. I settled on a 2013 Grenache blend of some sort that was really great. Our server was friendly. He didn't push any particular dish - the menu apparently changes frequently, so there is no \"go to\" dish. We bounced some ideas and restrictions off of him and he helped us confirm a few of our selections as good choices based on that input.The only potential gripe is that it's a bit cramped; tables are very close together. But, it's a small space and they have to turn tables to stay in business, so the more the merrier. If elbow room is a requirement for you, you might not be thrilled with that aspect of this place.

We also ordered the grilled quail, which was good but hard to share - such a little bird!As good as the food was, the service was not great. We found the wait staff to be a bit pretentious. I briefly lived in Basque country in Spain and always get excited to find Txacolina on a wine list. The waitress poured our bottle into an aerator carafe, \"as they do in Spain.\" She then lifted the carafe above her head to pour the wine in a long, steady stream into our glasses - which were still on the table. Every time she came over to pour a little more, the wine spattered - on the table, on us, etc. I had seen this technique before, but they took your glass OFF the table when attempting this elaborate pouring technique. Our waitress also gave excessive, elaborate descriptions and her opinions on every dish on the menu without us asking any questions about a single dish. Also, seriously, what is with the high table trend?? This is a nice date spot - who wants to shimmy into a bar chair and eat at a highboy table while they're in a dress and heels? I'm not at a bar.

THE BEEF AND PORK chunks inside were cooked to perfection and the sauce was soooooo amazing. Each bite was a bite of heaven. One thing is that the baco is a little hard to eat.

The salad was light and crisp, with nice hints of dill and rosemary backed up by a healthy dollop of burrata. The bacos were both excellent, with the toron winning out slightly. If the crispy beef and pork belly on the original baco was just a little bit more moist, we would be hard pressed to decide which one was better.Service was also on point, although they were quite strict about their seating. We came early and landed a patio spot, but I'm sure it can frustrating for walk-ins who come later in the day, say past 7pm. Lastly, the after dinner coffee was some of the best I've ever had. They don't have espresso, but they brew a mean batch of Stumptown- not bitter in the slightest, with slight floral notes. Better than what I've had at Stumptown itself!The only bummer was the parking. We got a metered spot right in front, but the darn thing was $6 an hour! Should have valeted the Chinese Recreational-Vehicle."], ["Stephanie C.", "Oh my squash blossoms, how I love B\u00e4co Mercat! At first calling to Catalan roots, a quick glance over the menu shows that the restaurant's dishes draw from European, Eastern, Asian, and Latin American influences.The signature b\u00e4co was created by Chef Centeno, and is a kind of flat bread sandwich with a variety of fillings. I tried the fava fritter b\u00e4co and enjoyed every bit of it. The bread was warm, soft and chewy (reminiscent of pita), perfect to carry the fritters and salmorejo spread. Vegetarian or otherwise, the b\u00e4co is a must-try if you're dining at Mercat.Other dishes include the coca (their flat bread version of pizza) and a variety of smaller plates, including several vegetable-based dishes.They treat vegetables beautifully here; my favorite so far is the eggplant salad, which is brightly dressed and sprinkled with feta. And of course, the squash blossom appetizer - fried and stuffed for a creamy crunchy bite of eggplant, ricotta, and garbanzo.And if you're looking to end on a sweet note- the caramelized upside down cake is moist and fruity while the acidity keeps the sweetness to an suitable level. The service was excellent both times I visited - friendly, helpful, and ready to give suggestions based on your price range and the kind of meal you're looking for. I find this particularly important because some of the ingredients may be unfamiliar to diners, and it's always more pleasant to ask questions to an approachable, helpful server. It's a small establishment, so reservations are recommended - I've sat both inside and outside. I loved the hedge surrounding the outdoor seating - it helps you forget you're in the middle of busy downtown and encourages you to imagine yourself dining in the rustic Spanish countryside. I left impressed after my visit; I left impressed and appreciative upon my second. B\u00e4co Mercat contributes significantly to LA's foodscape, and will hopefully remain a jewel for years to come."], ["Katy D.", "My friend and I ate dinner here after a day spent at the new Broad museum. I will start with the outstanding: the Coca Carne Picada was amazing. I haven't tasted anything this good in quite awhile. Beef, yams, peanuts and goat cheese were such a great combination. It was an explosion of different flavors and textures. Loved it, loved it! \u00a0Our waitress was also great, very nice and efficient. Now, for the not quite as good: The Soca Corn Cake was decent, but just didn't taste as good as the Coca Carne Picada. It was lacking a little bit of flavor.I would come back to try out more food. Maybe another museum day is in order soon."], ["Andrea H.", "I've been here for dinner in the past but more recently for lunch. The menu is more limited than dinner but there are many choices to choose from. Even with the restaurant not at capacity, the noise level and aggro music can be deafening. Our server disappeared after the beverage order but we lucked out by having someone who was quite helpful in giving us some good suggestions. The original bac\u00f6 \"sandwich\" was quite good. The beef carnitas was well seasoned but the pork belly on its own had no seasoning at all. The salbitxada spread ties the meats and flavors together along with the red onion and mixed greens. A very filling sandwich.The Salty Jowl Cocoa is just that. SALTY. The cured meat is just doused in salt and add that in with the Taleggio cheese, you have a very salty flatbread pizza. The egg definitely helps level the saltiness but I may have sodium poisoning. The check was given to us before the dessert menu was even offered so will have to try dessert another time."], ["Samantha C.", "Josef Centeno has outdone himself with his creative dishes, but at the end of the night, did they blow me away?

So we ordered \"The Original\" (with pork belly and beef) and the sandwich with oxtail hash (forgot the actual name). First of all, the names already look/sound delicious. Second of all, they tasted even better! The Original was made with a red sauce mixed with probably almonds. I know pork belly sounds fatty but it's not! The sauce gave the sandwich a light, healthy feel plus the pork belly pieces were slightly crispy on the surface so you won't feel greasy at all. The oxtail one has ground oxtail in it along with arugula and white sauce, which is more delicate in a way but at the same time quite tasty. By the way, the pita bread was the key for me (a sandwich hater generally). Such good bread! We also order dessert: hazelnut chocolate cream and pineapple upside down cake. You'll like the first if you like creamy, soft dessert. Pineapple cake was simply wonderful and seems to be the most popular dessert on the menu."], ["Shilpa D.", "Went here last night and had a great meal with my friend. \u00a0We split three dishes and each had a cocktail and the bill was $40/each. \u00a0On the higher end, but worth it.We couldn't find a cocktail we loved so we told the bartender what we were looking for and he made us two delicious and creative drinks. \u00a0I always appreciate a mixologist with skills that takes pride in their work - and I love a delicious spicy tequila cocktail!We had the Caesar Brussels sprout salad which was unique and fresh and flavorful with some fresh Parmesan. \u00a0Then we had the caramelized cauliflower which was also great. \u00a0Not too spicy or seasoned but cooked just right. \u00a0And lastly, and bestly ;) , we had the El Pesco baco which is a shrimp sandwich with cabbage and sriracha and fried shrimp (I could swear there was also a thin filet of fish in there as well). \u00a0And the bread was a delicious, thin, lightly buttery naan-style wrap. \u00a0This was so good.Service was great, ambiance was great, food was great, drinks were great - this would be a great date spot too. \u00a0Oh, and get my fav chocolate chip cupcake in LA, Big Man Bakes, from across the street (open till midnight!) for dessert."], ["Jiwon S.", "Awesome spot in downtown.

So good in fact that I will occasionally day dream about these sandwiches.We had The Toron & Beef Tongue Schnitzel - both amazing."], ["Daniel M.", "This is easily one of the best restaurants that I've been to in \u00a0all of LA (and being such a food city, that's no small statement) The restaurant is in the heart of downtown & it's (deservedly) very popular, so trying to find parking will be an adventure in of itself. They do have valet, for a cost) Furthermore, it's a good idea to make a reservation if you can. The vibe if the restaurant is busy, energetic, loud, & dimly lit. It's very trendy. When it's dinner, it's especially crowded & can feel a little cramped.The food is a unique fusion with Spanish, French, & American influences. Most of the menu is food you'll be hard pressed to find anywhere else. Let me walk you through my 3 course meal: Drink: MOXIE: This cocktail was solid, but nothing special. It has a little kick too it & some citrus hints.1. RICOTTA FRITTERS: These were warm, soft, & creamy. Their savory flavor is complimented nicely with honey, in a subtle fashion. 2. THE ORIGINAL BACO SANDWICH: This was incredible. One of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The meat isn't too tender nor too tough. And the add plenty of meat. They aren't stingy. The salvitxada sauce was amazing & made the flavor pop. I'd never heard of it before, which is a shame, because it's life changing.3. PISTACHIO CHEESECAKE: This was intriguing to me because I've never come across this flavor of cheesecake. The texture was creamy, but firm. The taste is very nutty & authentic to pistachio. My friend ordered the Yogurt Panna Cotta, which I tasted, & was also great. It's light & creamy. I would definitely recommend.Overall, this restaurant is a must for everyone who comes to LA, tourists & natives alike. My friend & I had a full 3 course meal in under an hour. It was that good. I will definitely be back."], ["Briana V.", "I came here a while ago and now just getting to a review. For four us us with drinks the total wasn't too bad at around $130 after tip.

The servers were very friendly and great with suggestions, but it was a bit hard to capture their attention in the start and in the end, probably because we were sitting outside and the place started to become packed for it's dinner rush. So why 4 stars? The food was great and something a bit different. I really did enjoy every bite of my meal. BUT it's nothing I would go ahead and give 5 stars to.

Luckily I managed to snag a last minute reservation for two people at 6:30pm (Sunday) \u00a0because this place was an amazing find. The service was really attentive. The busboys (?) always had water at hand and the waitress gave us the right amount of attention. With her recommendation we ordered two entrees to share between two people: the Lamb Riblets and the Toron sandwich. Out of the two I would have to say that the lamb was my favorite. The lamb had so many complex flavors that just melted into your mouth. The outside was crisp and the inside was so soft and tender; the meat just slid right off the bone. Moreover, the lamb was paired with some cucumbers and refreshing lentils (with some grapes for a sweet touch) which allowed you to take a break from the rich flavor of the lamb. The flavors complemented each other and made for a delicious dining experienceThe Toron sandwich seemed to also be really popular based on the number of yelp reviews. Its flavor was complete different from the lamb which i found refreshing because too much of the lamb can get rich. It was like an upgraded burger but on a flour tortilla (definitely could be wrong about that). The horseradish yogurt really tied the entire experience together. Also a very memorable dish. Sadly, those were the only two dishes we could try for this visit. But it is definitely worth to try if you are in the LA area. The food is a beautiful fusion between Spanish (more emphasis really) and French. The flavors are complex, but blend really well. We were not disappointed about our experience from the moment we stepped through the door. Really well done."], ["Jeff B.", "A great tapas spot, where you order small bites of many items and share.

One of my best friends and I were looking for a good Sunday night meal in LA to share while we exchanged our Christmas gifts. Baco Mercat was perfect for such an occasion. Setting: It's small and intimate. I would recommend sitting outside if you're up for it. The outdoor seating area may look small and close-knit, but it has heaters and vines that encage it from the busy sidewalk just outside of the dining area. It's a cool experience because from atop you can still see the pretty LA street Christmas lights while not necessarily haven't to be a part of the hustle and bustle of the city.Service: Perfection. Our waitress attended to us within 5 minutes of us taking our seats. She had a very cute and witty personality and explained the menu for us with enthusiasm and contagious energy. I often felt as though we had about a handful of servers all to ourselves. Any time we finished a plate or were even halfway through with our water glasses someone walking by would notice immediately and clear our plates and refill our waters. We received food recommendations from multiple servers who each took their time to explain their favorites in detail. It was really a joint effort and we definitely appreciated it! Drinks: We ordered the eggnog and the tequila mockingbird. The drinks were pretty small but I definitely enjoyed by eggnog! It was mixed with cinnamon and bourbon. My friend described the tequila mockingbird as tasting like Fanta. Could be good if that's what you're into. Food: The menu was a bit overwhelming. We consider ourselves to be pretty knowledgeable about food but we found ourselves having to quickly google many of the items on the menu. This wasn't necessarily a bad thing. It made for a fun, new experience. This is definitely a place where you want to share plates. It's mostly tapas style. We each had an appetizer of our own, a shared appetizer, a main dish each and a dessert to share. Our waitress recommended we order a few dishes to share and this all turned out to be the perfect amount of food for us. Lace-battered squash blossoms: So good! They had a creamy filling which complemented the crunchy outer layer of batter well. Mangalitsa and apricot: You really can't go wrong with the combination of apricot and cured meat. The bread it was served over was thin and equally crispy and soft. The shredded pieces of cheese on top added to the savory flavor of the meat and paired well with the sweet apricot.Pork belly sugo ravioli: I was warned that they would be spicy and spicy they were. Perfectly so! The sauce tasted like a spicy curry and the pine nuts and golden raisins gave it a sweet kick every now and then. Really good. The fava fritter baco: The pita bread was amazing in itself. It was fluffier than most pitas I've had and the chickpea and salmorejo mix was very good. Patatas bravas: This dish stuck out to me the most. I was a bit skeptical about the combination of pickles and potatoes but it turned out to be amazing. The dish included shredded parmesan and a creamy cheesy sauce that enhanced the flavor of the earthy potatoes. The sweet pickles provided a deliciously sweet contrast to the more salty flavor of the potatoes as well. Caramel upside down cake: The cake comes with a whole slice of pineapple on top with caramel drizzle and a side of whipped cream and ice cream. Both dense and moist! \u00a0When our bill arrived we both decided that Baco Mercat is more of a special occasion/treat yourself sort of place. It's not cheap, but it's delicious and the ambience is cozy and the service is outstanding.

The meat dishes are the biggest let down, on an otherwise inventive and quirky menu.

What happened to the rest of the hen?!Luckily it was a meal that was paid for by work. So I am not complaining too much ;-) but it's best going in a group as you really can sample everything as long as you're a little adventurous. $70 per person including drinks and a tip.

This salad was small, but so refreshing. Clean, crisp, light and sweet flavors.Coca - I've tried two different ones, but can't exactly remember what they were called.

Their menu knowledge is vast and they assist you in creating a custom experience with the tapas styled menu, something I was worried about after being warned of poor service. Here is my take on the meal:The Roasted Spanish Olives were nice and briny and the Olives bursted with flavor, but the addition of heat via saute pan did not add much to the flavor of the Olives. The Caesar Brussels Sprouts were all Sprouts and no Caesar. I thought these may be inline with The Playground's rendition, but this was a relatively plain dish. All that registered for me was chopped and sauteed Spouts, Garlic and Olive Oil. Far and away the best tapas I tried was the Fried Ricotta-Stuffed Squash Blossoms. Sweet, fresh and Tempura fried, this is a killer dish and a must have if you dine at B\u00e4co. The B\u00e4co sandwiches is where the rubber really hits the concrete and sets B\u00e4co Mercat apart from the fray. After careful consideration I went with the \"Original\", B\u00e4co's celebrated sandwich boasting crisp pork belly, beef carnitas, salbitxada and seasoned with caraway. This is a fun sandwich to eat, part Burger, part Taco and all awesome. The contrast of mouth feel from the Flatbread to the Pork Belly to the Carnitas is whimsical and there is a surprisingly spicy close without the heat getting stupid. This is a gourmet food truck concept if I ever saw one. I really enjoyed B\u00e4co Mercat's Euro/Med/Spanish brand of fusion and only wish I had more stomach capacity to try more of their creations but must admit the menu can be hit or miss without a little help.

Oddly it tasted pretty good. If only we had more cheese on top! MMM-original baco (taco) ($12) - Looks like 1 big taco. The pork pieces are pieces of fat (like lechon - Filipino food). The sauce had a kick and I didn't care for the taste. I wasn't impressed. -the salty jowl (flatbread) ($16) - Definitely a MUST!!! There's an egg that you crack all over the pizza. WOW - SUPER DELICIOUS! The service was OK. What I thought was a piece of hair engrained in my pizza flatbread was allegedly \"dill\" so the server said. It looks like a piece of hair to me?!

As expensive as it is, I actually liked this place a lot. It's quiet, which is good because my friend and I came here to have a quiet drink and conversation after having a couple of libations at the slightly noisier Edison. It kinda threw me for a loop that there was baseball playing on the screens, but then again, there were only three groups of patrons there, including a group of Japanese men having their quiet drinks and chatting with the hostess in the sexy maid outfit. I really liked the velvet over-the-top walls and bathrooms. After going to Royal/T, I realize that this was the other end of the spectrum when it comes to maid cafes. The hostess was definitely a lot more flirtatious toward the men, but still very cordial and took care of everyone including the women. She definitely earned her large tips because that woman was quick and attentive, despite being the only one working.As for the food and libations, my friend had a Maiden's Blush which looked and tasted like a delicious lemon vodka martini and I had the First Love - a champagne and cherry combination. Both served in beautiful glasses though both quite expensive at around $9-$10 a pop. It could've been more but they don't have the cocktail list on their website to double check (which is kinda annoying...).It was their food that totally surprised me. We ordered the Spicy Shrimp with Cheese ($18), some sweet corn tempura and chicken karakage. The later two I totally forgot what the price was, probably around $9-$10. The spicy shrimp was, hands-down, my absolute favorite. A spicy thick tomato sauce with swiss cheese on top, garnish with yummy enoki mushrooms with large shrimp just juicy, tender and delicious. Basically, a salary man's lobster. If nothing else, go try this dish. It is amazing! So amazing I won't even dare to copy it at home. The corn tempura was pretty surprising as well. Just super, super crunchy bunches of sweet corn that vaguely reminded me of eating popcorn. Salty and crunchy from the incredibly light batter, but the sweetness of the whole corn kernels really made it a delicious snack for drinks. Totally changed my perspective on popcorn for movie nights. Compared to the other two dishes, the chicken karakage wasn't as mind blowing. However, it was still crunchy, juicy and absolutely delicious. My friend and I were actually expecting to hit another restaurant to have a \"real\" dinner after we went to this place. We were really quite surprised on how full and satisfied we were. If you have the money and a special day to celebrate quietly, I really do recommend this place. The food is fabulous.

I'm not paying 18 bucks for some semi okay wine just because it's being served to me by some chick in a french maid outfit. I got a beer. $8?

Chicken Karage...okay Potato skins with foie gras...where the hell is my foie gras because that's bacon! We called the waitress over, her name was Tina, and asked her where the foie was. She goes over to who I'm guessing was the manager or owner (chick in white suit who while talking to table full of men next to us decided it was necessary to shove her ass directly in my face for at least 5 minutes) and white suit chick comes over. She blamed Tina which pissed me off. Said Tina should have told us they were out of foie gras and she'd reduce the bill. Tina was frazzled as it was...bless her heart...and I'm willing to bet money nobody told Tina they were out of foie gras that night.Check comes and there was no \"reduction\". Um, hey White Suit why don't you stop texting people on your Blackberry and come reduce that bill will ya? Or will you only come over when you want to stick your ass in my face? ARRRRRRRRRRRGH.

Really good down to the last drop Calamari frito: fried squid served with a creamy white lemon aoli that looks like a topping to a soulfl\u00e8 only the flavor isn't desert-ish at all its a lemon cloud of heaven Empanadas de pollo: chicken, tomato and corn stuffed served with garlic and herb aoli the aoli tasted more like chipotle mayo that complimented the empanadas if you want to spread the sauce on them Muscles: served with a wedge of bread to dip into the juice. The juice from the muscles tasted like a melody of flavors about to touch my tongue...if only I had been able to try the paella shucks!!

It's located in a mini mall and is pretty unassuming except for the large signage out front. I actually had visited Honduras years ago on a short term mission trip through a church I was attending but for some reason, I don't recall having these foods there.The cuisine is based on the central American theme which consists of hand made tortillas that are fluffy and thick. So good!!I came here with a friend recently and we shared a few things like a pork, cheese and bean pupusa, a loroco and cheese pupusa, two Honduran baliadas which are made using the hand made tortillas flattened a little more and folded over with goodies stuffed inside. The two we selected were a bean and cheese baliada and the other was called a Baliada de Huevo y Aguacate which consisted of refried beans, grated white cheese, sour cream, scrambled eggs and avocado. We also shared a Bistec Encebollado (steak and grilled onions) breakfast plate consisting of grilled beef with saut\u00e9ed onions, some refried beans, rice, a salad of diced cabbages topped with sliced tomatoes, cucumbers, and radish plus a side of the hand made tortillas.The pupusas were really enjoyable (4.5/5) and typical of the ones found at a lot of El Salvadoran eateries but the baliadas, which are native to Honduras, were the BOMB!! I especially liked the one with the Huevo y Aguacate combination. It's a sure winner in my book and a must have when dining here (5/5). The beef of Bistec Encebollado wasn't the greatest quality beef as it was a little tough and chewy but was decent enough (3.5/5). I'd probably order something else in its place next time.I also had the guayaba fruit drink which tasted similar to mango juice which I love and this was really refreshing and went well with my meal. (5/5)I'm so glad I decided to try this place out because I really enjoyed my experience here. The food is authentic and you could hear the cook in the back patting our freshly made tortillas for cooking, hehe! The gentleman who served us, who was most likely the owner, was a quiet and polite man.

If you are coming here for dinner, I recommend going with a large group of friends, especially if you are planning to walk instead of drive! Even though it is small, the restaurant gave me a welcoming and homey feeling. The paintings on the wall gave a nice cultural touch to the restaurant's atmosphere. The owner was very nice and friendly. The scorching heat from outside did not stop the owner from giving each customer who entered the door a welcoming smile and a friendly greeting. I ordered a pupusa y queso con loroco to-go and was charged with a not bad price of $2.73 with tax. Even though I ordered only one pupusa to go, and there were not a lot of customers at the restaurant at the time, I still had to wait for almost fifteen minutes to get my pupusa... I suggest calling in your order ahead of time to avoid having to wait for a long time. . Despite the disappointing wait time, I was satisfied with my pupusa. It was big, cheesy, and delicious. The loroco added an interesting flavor and texture to the pupusa, but it did not overpower the overall taste. The order came with a side of slaw and tomato salsa. Both the slaw and salsa perfectly complimented the pupusa. The slaw, in particular, was crunchy and delicious, and added a little citrus kick to the overall taste. I wish the tomato salsa would be chunkier and more flavorful, because the salsa alone tasted almost like plain water. Overall, good pupusa at a decently cheap price.

LA Paella seemed to be the answer and we found ourselves here around 9:00PM on a Wednesday. Maybe because it was late and on a weekday (they close at 10:00PM), there was plenty of seating for us and we experienced excellent service. First of all, their garlic butter and olive tapenade is fantastic. They serve it up with a loaf of their house bread. I do think that their bread is a little too hard (almost crouton like for some of the pieces). But it was really quite tasty and they are generous with their bread. A little softer next time please. Now, they make their paellas to order which means you're going to be waiting about 30 minutes for your food. And if you want paella, you have to order for two which means for all you solo diners, you won't be eating paella here. Anyways, in order to carry us over, we ordered some calamari. The calamari was very average and nothing special. The portion size is rather small too and they don't serve it with any sort of dipping sauce. Pass next time. The Paella Valenciana Mixta (Rice, saffron, meat, vegetables and seafood with a touch of red peppers and rosemary) was a glorious thing that was beautiful to look at. The servers will bring it out to show you first and then serve it to you table side. One bite in and I was hooked. It was seasoned right, the rice was cooked to the right consistency and they were't too skimpy with the different meat and seafood. Because the price is a little steep, I think they could have thrown in a few more mussels and squid and such but this is definitely one of the better ones I've had in the LA area. We really enjoyed our meal here with a bottle of cider. I think for everything we ordered, the bill was around $80. It wasn't a cheap meal, but it wasn't outrageously expensive neither. The restaurant has that Old School Europe feel too so it could be considered intimate and romantic to some degree. Well worth a visit. 4/5"], ["Christy W.", "This place is a very small Spanish restaurant--maybe 5-6 tables max, although I am not sure if there are extra tables on the upper level. The atmosphere is very warm and home-y--dimmed lighting, home-y d\u00e9cor, candle light in the middle of the table, etc. I recommend coming here for a date or with family, as the environment is nice and quiet for conversations. As its name suggests, this place is known for their paella--Spanish rice dish. So we (a party of 5) decided to share 2 hot tapas and 2 paellas. Keep in mind that the minimum order for each paella is two (aka for two people), so the paellas we got are 2 orders each. This place serves a generous amount of complimentary bread--comes with vinegar, salted butter, and tapenade (olive spread). Our whole table loved the bread--I highly recommend the tapenade spread along with the butter. SO GOOD! 1) C A L A M A R I \u00a0 W/ \u00a0 G A R L I C \u00a0 & \u00a0 B U T T E RThis was my favorite dish of the night. The calamari was so chewy and it soaked in the garlic and butter sauce. Make sure to squeeze in the lemon because or else this dish may seem a bit heavy--plus, the citrus flavor really compliments seafood. Must get! 2) M U S S E L S \u00a0 I N \u00a0 W H I T E \u00a0 W I N E \u00a0 S A U C EThis was also really good. The mussels were nice and big--none of that teeny tiny business you get from some of the other restaurants--and the white wine sauce was nice and sweet. Excelente! 3) P A E L L A \u00a0 M A R I N E R A This paella is surely a showstopper because it comes with a generous amount of mussels, clams, shrimp, and lobster. The menu explains that the paella dishes take about thirty minutes to cook. So you can imagine how the flavors of the seafood really seep into the rice, making it super delicious. Recommend! 4) S Q U I D \u00a0 I N K \u00a0 P A E L L A I personally love squid ink, so I was really looking forward to this dish. Unfortunately I thought this dish was average. Unlike the Paella Marinera, this paella only comes with a few mussels and small bits and pieces of calamari mixed into the rice :( The squid ink flavor is definitely there though, so I can't really complain. I just wished there were more to this dish. Be careful when eating this though, because the squid ink will stain your lips and make it black if you don't clean up after every few bites (now we wouldn't want black lips on a date do we? XD).The service here is also wonderful, I loved our server--super polite and knowledgeable. Looking at other pictures posted by fellow Yelpers I realized it's the same old man. I wonder how long he's been working at this place for? Either way, I had a great experience here and would definitely recommend it to paella lovers."], ["Eric F.", "10 years ago this place was way more crowded and I would have given it less stars.This evening my friend and I were the only ones there for a while - and the food is much improved.For a Beverly Hills joint LA Paella offers wine and fino sherry by the glass for as low as $6. Hot and cold tapas are between $5 and $9. Major entrees are from $11 to $26.In other words - for what you get and where you get it - LA Paella is a bargain.We ordered the Serrano Jamon plate for under ten bucks - and got so much ham that we took some home.And everything was delicious.Getting here is tough though... not because it is up in the mountains or it is in New Zealand - but because it is on a part of San Vincente that is almost impossible to get to. The best way to go is to approach it from the south east - not from La Cienega.The real winners in tonight's meal, besides the Jamon, were the garlic shrimp and most especially the Spanish tortilla. I will come here again and again."], ["Jon R.", "IF YOU'VE BEEN TO SPAIN AND LOVE AUTHENTIC SPANISH FOOD, DON'T COME HERE BECAUSE YOU'LL BE DISAPPOINTED.I love Spain. I went there a few years back and the food literally changed my life, so when I heard there was a \"good\" paella restaurant here on the westside and it had four stars on yelp I was excited! Unfortunately, that excitement quickly dissipated. Bread & Aioli & Tempenade-Bread was old and hard like croutons-aioli was very bland not enough garlic flavorChampi\u00f1ones con Chorizo (Potatoes with Chorizo)-Potatoes were cooked but way underseasoned-chorizo was not like Spain at all more like really bland Portuguese sausageMejillones Costa Brava (Mussels with White Wine)-These were actually good but again, very underseasoned-Tender, juicy, succulent musselsPulpo a la Gallega (Slow Cooked Octopus)-bland bland bland-no flavor aside from a subtle paprika-not as tender as I would've likedCaracoles al Ajillo (Garlic Snails)-bland-mushy-overall not very good at all and I LOVE escargotPaella Marinera -pretty good but again, obviously not even close to the quality of Spain-seafood was a bit overcooked especially the shrimp and lobsterYelp is rarely so wrong but in the case of La Paella they were. It's been a very long while since I've eaten such an unsatisfying meal. And it wasn't just me. Even the friends I took here that have never been exposed to Spanish food didn't care for it. No taste, no flavorful, just blah. The service was very good but the food sadly, was not."], ["Janice L.", "The service was great and the food was excellent! We really enjoyed the paella mixta. Thanks to David!!"], ["Elvin C.", "3.5 stars. I wanted to give 4 stars because the owner is such a delightful and welcoming person, but I found the food to be rather unimpressive despite how great the menu alone made me drool. I came with my family to celebrate my birthday just to try it out. This is in fact, my first time at a Spanish restaurant, and I had very high expectations for Spanish food in general from what I've seen and heard. I expected my eyes to roll back, I expected something refreshing considering it was my first time eating Spanish food, and I expected to be interested in coming back regardless of the price. In those regards, I was somewhat disappointed.I wanna start off on a positive note by saying that the complimentary bread here is toasted and comes with both garlic butter and olive paste. I could've eaten baskets of the bread with those awesome condiments if it weren't for me trying to stay hungry in anticipation of the paella. Great job on that bread. I was pretty excited to try the tapas because they all sounded great.Champinones con Chorizo: I thought it tasted fine, but there was nothing particularly impressive about it. Not sure how great I expected it to be, but I don't see myself itching for more. 3.75/5.Tortilla Espanola (requested warm): I've been wanting to try this dish for a long time and finally did. Who doesn't love potatoes and onions cooked with eggs? Well personally I was underwhelmed and it wasn't even as delicious as the potato omelettes I make at home. Bummer, 2.5/5. Patatas Bravas: I sautee potatoes all the time with ketchup and chili sauce for breakfast, so I was looking forward to see what they could've offered. I didn't think the dish overall was that great, but I did really like the spicy kick of the sauce. 3.75/5.Vieiras al Ajillo (Scallops sauteed with garlic and chili): This was probably the most anticipated \u00a0of all the tapas we ordered and it was solid. You couldn't mess up something so simple unless the scallops weren't fresh, but they were good. 4/5.Croquetas de Pollo: One of the more anticipated tapas also, it ended up being not bad at all. I just wish it was more... memorable. I couldn't say any one thing about it stood out or wowed me, but it was alright. Could be cheesier, could have more chicken, and could've been a bit hotter coming out. 3.75/5. We had the Paella Marinera and the Paella Valenciana Mixta. They're really not too different from each other, maybe I should've went with the Squid Ink option for variety's sake. The Paella Marinera was full of seafood and it was all pretty good especially the prawn. However, the overall verdict of the paella was that there was a tiny bit too much stock still around which made the rice more watery with the rice still being on the al dente side of the spectrum. Maybe a bit more cooking time would've fixed that, or maybe that's just how it's made here... 3.5/5. My first time trying paella was actually at a French bistro in South Pasadena, and that was much more to my liking. The rice was cooked perfectly, there was the ever so coveted crunchy rice packed full of the flavors from the cooking juices, and the dish as a whole was so \u00a0cohesive and delicious. It felt like Christmas eating that particular dish.Dessert wasn't bad at all.Flan de Naranja: Supposedly they won the best flan in Los Angeles award in 2009. Not sure who passes out these awards, but regardless, it wasn't close to the best flan I've had. It's not very sweet (and many like it this way) with a strong orange presence so keep that in mind if you're thinking about getting it. 3.25/5.Crema Catalan: If you like creme brulee with a cinnamon kick, this has your name on it. It's a good stab at creme brulee and I have absolutely no gripes with this, 4.25/5.Although I very much appreciate the cute little decor in here, along with the friendly and welcoming service, I can't say that the food was good enough to justify the $$$. If you're desperately looking for your Spanish fix, this should do the trick, but don't expect anything transcendent.P.S. The owner has been looking for a busboy or a waiter for 2 years now, COME IN AND APPLY. Does no one need a job anymore?"], ["Maureen S.", "My husband and I have no complains about this place. The owner was so friendly and welcoming. We ordered the snails, grilled squid with chile, and the seafood paella. I've never been to Spain but whether or not it tastes different, it was flat out delicious! The squid says a hint of chile but it definitely brought some heat. The paella takes a while so definitely have some of their bread and enjoy a couple glasses of wine. Slow down. Take your time! The restaurant itself is simple, small, and quiet (but you don't feel like you have to whisper either). Perfect for great company and good conversation. Just a homie, relaxing atmosphere for a date or small group of friends. We're already looking forward to our next meal there!"], ["James W.", "Stopped by this place on the way home from another restaurant that had a one-hour wait. Glad I did! We weren't very hungry, so decided to share some tapas. And yes, although the name of this place has \"paella\" in it, we did not opt for it given the fact that you have to order at least two portions of it in order to have it. Shame. Because the table next to us got them, and they looked amazing!Instead, we got some hot tapas to share:1. Spanish tortilla: potatoes, egg, onions. Done really well. Quite large too. Light.2. Potatoes: Pretty standard, although there is a little kick with the spicy sauce.3. Mushroom and chorizo: Awesome. I kept dipping the bread in the sauce because it was so good.4. Calamari: Well fried, fresh.5. Special croquettes: Crispy outside, mashed potatoes with some meat on the inside. Enjoyed this very much too.6. Spinach with pine nuts and raisins: Our only veggie dish of the night, and it was well done. The raisins add a really good flavor to an otherwise normal spinach dish.Wines were cheap ($5-7 a glass). Service was excellent.

The artichokes were average.We ordered a squid ink paella (came with shrimps and squid) and a sausage paella paella (with shrimps, sausage, and edamame (?)). \u00a0I was not impressed by the sausage paella. \u00a0The Squid ink paella was good in comparison to the other one but nothing to write home about.I really wanted to love LA Paella, but I just didn't think much of it, unfortunately. \u00a0Street parking, however, was pretty easy to find on a Friday night around 9."], ["Jonathan K.", "I'm no paella expert, but I was pretty underwhelmed by LA Paella.The restaurant itself is nice, but nothing to write home about. From reading some other reviews, I expected something a little more unique with the decor and atmosphere, but I thought it was nice, but not special.The service wasn't bad, but our waiter was completely unhelpful, in that every time we asked him for certain recommendations, he would just say \"everything's good.\" Or even when deciding between the chicken and ham croquettes, he was just like \"they're both good\" without elaborating, giving us any more information, or even asking us what kinds of food we liked, or what portions we were looking for, etc.The sangria was average but the appetizers weren't bad.

Beware, though, that it stains your teeth way more than I've ever seen with any squid ink dish.Overall, I had a mediocre experience here, and for the price, it definitely wasn't worth it for me, so I probably won't be coming back.

I had upgraded our paella with the spanish rice, and asked to have the paella \"more crispy\" so that the bottom of the pan got a little burnt, making the rice crispy and crunchy. \u00a0The serving for 2 was plenty, and with the appetizers, had just enough room for dessert and coffee.For dessert we shared the rice pudding, served cold. \u00a0It was a dense rice pudding, not mushy or creamy , and paired very well with coffee.Overall, the meal wasn't that bad. \u00a0For 2 appetizers, sangria, paella, dessert and coffee, it came to $100 before tip.Reservations highly suggested on the weekends. \u00a0DIning at 8:00 was nice, as it was not crowded, and the noise level was low. \u00a0Service was spot on, and the owner stopped by to make sure we were having a good meal. \u00a0He even tried to photobomb us.. that rascal!Meter parking on the street, and its free after 8:00 pm. \u00a0Otherwise, bring coins or use your credit card to pay for parking.If you've never been to LA Paella, it can be tricky to find. \u00a0Rely on your GPS, and keep an eye out for a tiny street inlet. \u00a0Its not on the main drag of San Vicente."], ["Barbara L.", "LA Paella is as close to an authentic Spanish restaurant as you can get in Los Angeles.
