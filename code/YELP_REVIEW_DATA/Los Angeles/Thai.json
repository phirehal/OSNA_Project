We ordered the coconut soup, pad Thai and the pad see ew.We were most excited for the pad Thai which ended up coming out last.I started digging in to my pad Thai until my boyfriend \u00a0showed me a strand of hair he found in his share of it. It was evidently cooked with the food and not just a piece of hair that happened to fall into our dish because my boyfriend held the strand up high and dangling on the other end of it was a piece of egg.

Our friends frequent this place often, so we came here under their advise. If you choose to park your car inside the parking lot, you have no choice but to do valet. It wasn't too busy when we came and we were seated right away. I like how they have outdoor seating as well (perfect for a summer's night out). I would've chosen to eat outside except it was raining (I know!) at the time. The restaurant was buzzing away with orders and people coming in and out. It seems that they have a pretty quick turnover of customers, so I don't think waiting is an issue. We ordered their chicken pad thai, pork pad see ew, boat noodles, and shrimp cakes. I really enjoyed all the food we ordered except for the soup. There was an aftertaste I didn't like, but I can't quite figure out what."], ["Courtney W.", "Not a fan.

Their cheap prices were the main reason I used to like it but as far as the food goes it's average, at best.

We decided to go to nearby Thai Town and get some lunch. Arriving around lunch time we were seated immediately. We ordered the Chicken satae, fried shrimp cake, spicy beef noodle soup, sanamluang noodles, and my gf had some dish which I am failing to recall the name but it was item #39. I will first start off with the appetizers, their chicken satae is a bit bland. It is definitely drenched in this sticky yellow sauce, I am pretty sure it is peanut sauce. The satae comes with a cucumber and onion dip to eat with which I found a bit odd. I feel like it didn't accompany the satae well. I would say I have had better satae else where so skip it at this establishment. Their fried shrimp cake was also disappointing, it was very greasy and to me I couldn't even taste the shrimp. Now for the main entrees I am not very good at handling spicy food so I asked them to tone down my spicy beef noodle soup and I am sure they did. Upon tasting the broth, it wasn't too bad a bit of a spicy and sour taste. However as you kept on eating it, the spice built up quick. I am not blaming the restaurant for this issue, I should have just ordered something that was not spicy. Even though it was spicy it was really good and I ate every bite of it. I was not a huge fan of the liver (didn't like the texture), so I just didn't eat that. The other two noodle soups I had a sip of the broth and it tasted pretty similar. My gf and her uncle seemed to enjoy the food. Comparing between all the food we ate, I am pretty sure the other two noodle soups came with more noodles than my spicy beef noodle soup. So keep that in mind if you come hungry. Would I return to this establishment? I wouldn't rule them out but I would \u00a0want to try the other restaurants Thai Town has to offer. They have a private lot, but it seems to get filled quickly. Many Yelpers have complained about the customer service, however it seems like that might just be a hit or a miss.

They're not located in Thai Town anymore, that was their first location before they moved to this location. They just pretty much used their old menu and didn't change the location information on the front cover. Their menu includes a variety of Thai dishes including appetizers, soups, salad, noodle soups, stir fried noodles, rice dishes, a la carte, curry dishes, and side orders. They also have a vegetarian menu. Their noodle soups include small size and large size. For noodle soups, there are different types of noodles you can choose from which include flat rice noodles, small rice noodles, egg noodles, glass noodles, or Thai vermicelli.I've had the Boat Noodle Soup with Beef large size. I requested mild spicy, no bean sprouts, and my choice of noodles was small rice noodles. This noodle soup consists of pork liver, tripe, and meatballs. Generous portions of everything. The broth was seriously heavy and rich but it was really good. The noodles had the perfect texture. It was soft, chewy, and thoroughly absorbed the flavor of the broth. The noodle portion seemed to be never ending. My mom had the Hoy Ka Noodle Soup with Pork large size. She enjoyed it very much. I also tried a bit and it was pretty good. It was awfully crowded the first time we went. It was pretty chaotic. The second visit we came right when the restaurant opened so we were one of the first ones. We arrived at 11am and within 10 minutes came three other tables. Service has been good. The servers are really nice, accommodating, and very soft spoken. Sometimes, we did have to flag them down when they were busy. The owner recognized us from our first visit and welcomed us. For our first visit, it took us forever to get our to-go orders. Keep in mind we ordered to-go at the same time we ordered food for dine-in. We waited pretty much another hour after we were done eating. When we finally got the orders, we received numerous apologies from the owner (who was also our server that day) and we got a discount from $52 to $45 which was nice. For our second visit, our to-go orders arrived promptly after we were done eating. But then again, it was far less hectic that day. The restaurant it itself is very spacious. There's a lot of seating available in including regular tables and high top tables. The interior is a bit interesting. There's photos of patrons in the form of a heart shape, artwork consisting of paintings, and several TVs. On a random note, servers here all wear plaid shirts.Parking is awful. Couldn't find any in the back on the first visit. Even if we were to find parking in the back of the restaurant, all the spots are incredibly narrow. For both visits, we were lucky to find a spot on the curb in the front of the restaurant. Overall, their Thai noodle soups are pretty awesome.

What stood out the most to me were the Papaya Salad and Hoy Ka Noodle Soup. I've had Papaya Salad at a number of different restaurants - both Lao and Thai - and this was the best I've had. We ordered it Thai Style with Braised Pork and the flavors were just perfect. Just as unique and bursting with flavor was the Hoy Ka Noodle Soup. This soup comes with a choice between a few different types of noodles and meats and I ordered mine with chicken and rice noodles. This has to be one of the best Asian Soups I've tried. I eat a lot of pho but the Hoy Ka is in a league of it's own in terms of flavor profile and depth. It was an extraordinary bowl of Thai Chicken Soup to say the least. Everything we tried was extremely good and received the approval of my inlaws who just arrived from Thailand the same day. The service was outstanding. Our servers were very attentive and the speed was good from the time we were seated to the time we paid our bill and left. The owner came and conversed with my in-laws before we left.

The meat was seasoned well, the veggies were crisp and fresh, and the noodles made all the flavors talk to one another.And of course what venture into Thai cuisine would be complete without one of my absolute favorites, Thai tea, accompanied with a hearty amount of tapioca boba doo-dads which make not inhaling them into your wind pipe a sort of delicious exhilarating high-risk sport.

The perfect flavor combination and the texture was very pleasing to my senses. typically I have found Pad See Ew to be very soft with almost mushy noodles.

Being the only Thai place in Grand Central Market, I find that Sticky Rice is a great representation of not only Thai town but what a greater part of LA loves as well. If you look at Westwood and parts of Hollywood, they're littered with some of the best Thai eats around. I suppose it was just a matter of time before a nice place threw down for a stall in the market. I took all my bias and forgot to set it aside when I ordered the curry soup dish called the Khao Soi. Why? I wanted to see what kind of curry they threw in the hodgepodge. It was also important to note whether or not it would permeate through the noodles to give the food itself some flavor. As many have said, be prepared to wait, as the food appears to be made to order. After ten minutes, and going through a short line, I received a large cup about the height of three baseballs stacked up. The noodles were fresh, and flavored with curry quite well. While the Thai have several types of noodles, these resembled the classic fettuccine shape. Along with chicken cutlets, green onion, and undesired parts of chicken skin, I began my descent into bliss. I tossed aside the skin pieces and found that every bite was very flavorful not just of an Indian-style Madras curry, but of a thin coconut milk. For those unfamiliar with coconut milk, I recommend you try it at least once. The dish did not come with rice, and didn't need it. It was so much to consume in itself. It may even feed two moderately hungry folks. Located right across from their old spot and next to Olio Pizzeria (originally from Santa Barbara just like McConnell's), the stall is open late some nights when Grand Central is open late. I recommend coming after 1:00 p.m. and being prepared to wait 10-15 minutes for your food. Consider street parking if you're coming here from far away, but walking here is your best option. Many patrons were backed against the old unused stall waiting for their names to be called, all the while gazing into their phones. The things that you own, as Palaniuk would say, end up owning you in the end. So try the Khao Soi, especially if you've never tried Thai food, or if it's a cold day, or want a quick warm meal with a kick. Don't use the hot sauces unless you can handle a swift judo-chop to the throat and digestive system. Bring folks who are like minded, and not those you're truly looking to impress. It's a simple place, a simple stall, and a simple menu much like the rest of Grand Central Market's other shops. Remember to know what you want and keep the line moving as if you're there to see the Soup Nazi. There's more to discover outside of the Khao Soi and this lovely joint, so go make like Levar Burton and don't take my word for it."], ["Brian M.", "I was feeling slow and wanted to find a hearty soup to pick me up. I really enjoy the market and always like discovering new things. I had a wonderful meal at Sticky Rice and the staff couldn't have been nicer. I tried the Khao soi which was displayed on a cool looking menu over the booth. I later learned more about this great Thai dish, something I had never tried. I read khao soy is a Burmese-influenced dish served widely in northern Laos and northern Thailand. The ingredients and flavors in this curry are fantastic. I added Shrimp and next time will try chicken. If you are looking for a complex delicious curry look no further!Skip the Fanta and try something else. I also recommend the Lemon Watermelon refreshment to go with it as a drink."], ["S D.", "It was okay.You get an okay amount of food for a decent price for the name of Grand Central Market. \u00a0But you really can get Thai food somewhere else for a much better price and better quality. \u00a0I got Pad Thai which didn't have much flavor and was subpar Thai food."], ["Jessica F.", "Moved down the street and decided to give this place a try.

It's that serious.The pad thai and BBQ chicken were also very yummy, everything cooked perfectly but then again, you shouldn't be in business if you're a Thai establishment that can't get these two dishes right.

For a large portion of food between 10-15 dollars, it's well worth it. The flavors are intense but balanced and follow the southeast Asian cooking standards of sour, sweet, savory all in one dish.

The flavors of the rice are very good. Not so much a sweet flavor, but more of a curried, earthy flavor that goes well with the chicken and pineapple. The texture of the rice is good as well as it has a certain bit of firmness to it that is not usually found in other dishes.I also had the opportunity to sample the almond boba tea which was very tasty and refreshing as well.Overall, the pineapple fried rice is worth trying here and could easily be split with a friend.

Hard to mess this up as it's a staple appetizer in Thai cuisine but the chicken was just okay. It could have been a tad more moist. The peanut sauce was good, thicker in texture than most I've had._Coconut Chicken Soup (Tom Gha Kai) ($9.95) Chicken, mushroom, lemon grass, lime leaves, galangal and lime juice in coconut soup. I usually always get this soup when I want Thai food. It's almost a tradition with my dad since we would always get this together. It's served in a bit hot pot, good for 2-4 people to share. Right amount of coconut flavor, not too spicy, and has a sour flavor from the lemongrass. I love the button mushrooms and the chicken is moist. _Glass Noodle Salad ($8.95) Glassy noodle mixed with red onion, ground pork, shrimp, chili and lime juice. I saw this on yelp images and it looked pretty good so wanted to try it out. I'm glad I did, the flavors are simple and light. The glass noodles, I'm told are supposed to be less carbs than others, so that's a plus. The shrimp was good, I wish they added more. Good amount of ground pork that is spread throughout. It was a bit sour and refreshing. _Chicken over Rice ($8.95) Special steamed rice topped with chicken served with homemade sauce and chicken broth soup, This is always a classic and can't go wrong. The rice is steamed and fluffy, has some flavor from the broth. The chicken is very moist and the dish itself, minus all the rice feels light.

There were so many choices but this place satisfied our Thai craving. After roaming in LA looking for a place to eat, we settled on this highly reviewed Thai restaurant. The place is CASH only so make sure you have some before coming in. If not, they do have an ATM inside. The place isn't huge but does utilize it's space to have as many tables as possible. We were seated right away during lunch time on a Thursday. The menu is extensive including your typical Thai dishes as well as more authentic dishes. My partner always get the same thing though, pad Thai and pad kee mao. Spice level goes as follows: mild, medium, spicy and very spicy. The pad kee mao with tofu has the option of fried tofu or soft tofu. I went with the soft tofu and loved it. The pieces were big chunks of tofu and they were soft, but still had some firmness to it to keep it from falling apart. I really appreciated that this kee mao did not leak a bunch of oil like other places. It didn't have that greasy, oily feel to it. Furthermore, every noodle was separated and absorbed the sauce. I don't like seeing pieces of noodles stuck to each other and having a pure white side that never touched the sauce. I got mine at spice level medium and found it to have just enough kick. There were plenty of veggies and it was not overly salty. My partner likes his pad Thai spicy but apparently they don't alter the spice level of pad Thai here. They said it messes with the authentic flavor of it. However, they said they would bring out the mini spice rack for him if that would be okay. The pad Thai was well coated in sauce and had a very authentic flavor to it. It wasn't ketchup-y, and not flavorless either. It was a flavor of pad Thai that I've never tasted before, but I liked it. It was more on the subtle side, but adding the spice seasoning helped to amp up the flavor. If you're looking for more flavorful pad Thai, then I'm not sure if you should get it here. The chicken is very tender though!Service was perfect. We were given water and checked up on. I saw the waiter glance over at us here and there to make sure we were doing fine. Once a plate was cleared of food, someone came over to clear it. You can pay up at the register. Once again, cash only. It was roughly $20 without tip so pretty standard for a Thai place.

I guess I was under the impression it was more like pork, and less like fried pork fat...but the dish still was delicious and seasoned perfectly. We also ordered fried rice with pork belly (I really thought I liked pork belly). The rice was amazing, same problem with the pork belly though. And lastly, we ordered shrimp Pad Thai; and that was amazing (I like shrimp a lot).

Don't think of it as a bad thing because it definitely isn't but, how can I not go to Pa-ord? They're consistent, cheap and they never let me down. I've tried a few things off their menu but seem to keep coming back for their Tom Yum noodle bowl with #4 noodle which is a flat rice noodle. Tom Yum's broth is on the lighter side yet still flavorful. I have such high tolerance for spice but, I don't dare order Pa-Ord's medium level of spice. Trust me, you don't want to learn the hard way like me. The beauty of ordering mild with Pa-Ord is that if you're still looking to build up the heat, then you have an array of spices and condiments on your table so, fear not my friend and go ahead and order mild then, customize! The boyfriend loves their boat noodle as well as their other noodle bowl that has pig offal. Broth tastes much richer and the pig offal noodles have a thick consistency to it which is perfect for windy/cold nights. Both taste amazing as well. Another must try here at Pa-Ord is their holy basil with crispy pork with a fried egg on top. I don't know what it is with fried egg and a runny center but you could put that on anything and it will instantly make the dish perfect. Plus, their crispy pork is just beyond amazing - crunchy yet still tender from the fat that's in it. Ugggghhh so good!

One of them recommended this place because of their Tom Yum Soup, so I was like hey, let me search them on Yelp and see some pictures. At first, I didn't think it looked so appetizing. It looked way too oily, but I still gave it a try when they ordered it. It was pretty bomb. I think they should put more noodles in the soup, the bean sprouts overtook the noodles. The soup was really sweet, which I am not too fond of but weirdly, I liked it. By the way, it isn't the red soup with flaming fire pot Tom Yum Soup, it's something different and I recommend that everyone should at least give it a try.I also ordered the Pad See Ew and Spicy Chicken Fried Rice. Damn, does the chef really have high tolerance of spice level or what. I ordered spice level medium and I pretty much was sweating and couldn't talk throughout my whole meal cause it was spicy, and I like hot and spicy food.I will be coming back to try more food here, cause I enjoyed it.

Let me tell u the broth is really rich due to the blood infused into the broth(sound simple and grotesque but there is actually a certain way to do this properly, like art)- also a little sweet, spicy, earthy, a little sour from the noodles and I'm in heaven..

I was game for anything, I told them. They even spoke Thai so the ease of ordering and the customer service we received was so great!! By the time I got there, the restaurant was packed at 10ish at night. Parking lot was ok, but luckily I drove \u00a0the smaller car and we found a spot right away. I could see how parking can be a bit iffy depending on the hour/traffic. Didn't even look at the menu, I gravitate to my usual Thai favorites i.e. pad Thai, panang curry, fried rice, pad woon sen, but this restaurant does not serve curry. Nonetheless I didn't even miss it! \u00a0The girls ordered for me basically. \u00a0I tried: crispy pork with Chinese broccoli (YUMMM, No spice but I see red pepper flakes and it was perfect for my taste buds) sausage (light and tasty)fish cake (light, slightly sweet and also tasty) pad see ewe (Soooo good and DEEEELICOUS also THE BEST I've had!!!) pad woon sen (BEST I'VE EVER HAD)papaya salad (my first time tasting and LOVED it, again no spice, but it was a medium spicy level and pepper flakes are very visible)Beef salad (YUMMM!!...tender beef is the BEST)2 different boat noodle soups (that was my first time trying it and it was good but I definitely preferred a few of the other dishes)A first for me as well, I didn't even eat a single grain of rice!!... Surprising as rice is my staple for any Asian dining. I never missed it though. Looking back now I could really see enjoying sticky rice with that papaya salad. At the end of our meal, one of the girls ordered a dessert. I have no idea what it was called but it was coconut milk and some jelly squares and red jelly-like fruit with a chestnut texture crunch. It was also delicious. It calmed the spicy sweat for me. Everything I tasted was really delicious, I can't say that enough. I absolutely will have to add this to my dining destinations whenever I'm in the area, even if I drop in for takeout so I can enjoy it at home. I told my friends I'm ruined...

Well, probably both. Pa Ord comes essentially as a best of both worlds, in that you get burn-your-tongue-off-spicy street Thai food at extremely affordable prices, coupled with the comforting hygienic standards of the good ol' USA. (They've got an A for their Food Facility rating, and I'm fine with not prying any deeper than that.)I always come assuming there'll be a wait, but mysteriously I've never had to. The biggest obstacle standing between me and my food (besides finding a parking spot) is deciding what to order. With all meat dishes you can choose your meat, and with all noodle dishes you can choose your noodle type (see the choices on the menu or in the cute little noodle display cases).Ga Pao is my favorite Thai dish, and theirs is incredible. With generous amounts of succulent meat, exquisitely balanced flavorings, a perfectly crispy-yet-runny fried egg, and enough peppers to incinerate your tongue, this dish is just as delicious as the Ga Pao I had off the streets of Bangkok--(except with no flies!)Equally impressive is their Pad See Ew. It pairs well with the Ga Pao because it is sweet instead of spicy, and has noodles instead of rice.And then there's my favorite dish of theirs: the Pork Spare Rib Tom Yum Noodles. (The #5, that is.) Whether it's your main dish, or if you're going to be sharing it, I definitely recommend not missing out on this, or alternatively on one of their other soup noodles. With both large ($6) and small ($4) prices, you pretty much have no excuse not to order one. I don't really know how to describe this, except that it is so comfortably fragrant and unbelievably full-bodied. The many types of meat (assuming you went with the #5) make every bite/sip unique, and the occasional crunch of peanut seals the flavor deal. This is why they are called Pa Ord NOODLE, rather than Pa Ord Somethingorother. I could drink a bowl of this every day.With most Thai places, I've found the greatest shortcoming to be meat quality. I don't know what they do to their meats here to prevent them from having that pre-frozen, out-of-a-bag feel to it while still keeping these prices, nor do I care to know. The vegetables are incredibly fresh as well, and it's not uncommon to see a dude hauling a fresh batch of them to the kitchen during your meal.I'm not sure if, ok so what maybe they use some MSG, but this is what I like to refer to as Blind Eye MSG, as it's fine to turn a blind eye because it's just so darn good, and the food would seriously be lacking without it.Your other option is of course going to Jitlada a few blocks down, and paying for exorbitantly overpriced Thai food (and admittedly better ambiance), but I'd choose Pa Order any day of the week. Plus, here you have the awesome 80s pictures of a Thai pop idol scattered around the walls. (I was told that this lady is related to the owner? Or is the owner?)Remember that the food is hellishly spicy, but they will reduce it if you want. I find \"Medium\" to be burningly delicious."], ["Viola W.", "Its just too good that makes me posting my first review on yelp.

Be prepared, this place is CASH ONLY, but no worries, they have an ATM machine inside their restaurant.

If you're not that hungry, you can order a small bowl but if you came with an appetite, go for the large.You can choose from 4 different type of noodles which they have in pictures (along with the some of the entrees) on the menu (egg noodles, rice noodles, thin/thick noodles). You will also be asked what level of spice you prefer (keep in mind, Thai food can be really spicy so be prepared).If you don't want the #1 or soup, have no fear, there are other items on the menu that you can choose from. It's also nice that they have a small, private lot, since parking in Thai Town can get tricky at times.

It has a coconut milk base and it's sour and savory. It's really good with a side of rice, to balance the strong tarty flavor of the soup and the soup is huge so you can share.

There are also different prices for different sizes ranging from $4.50 for small to $8.50 for large (depends on what dish you get for price). I personally thought the large was enough for one portion (I can't imagine how small the small portion must be!). You get to pick from 4 different types of noodles, egg noodles, rice noodles, thin/thick noodles.I personally loved the broth and the noodles and they had a good portion of squid (yum!) but their spice was pink which made the broth and noodles and ingredients pink haha. I still finished it though. Also, they do have some special side dishes listed on the wall. Make sure to ask how much it costs because we thought they cost $3 because they had a little sticker on it with Thai writing (our fault for not asking) and we thought the side dish (we ordered calamari which was really good) only cost $3 but it was actually $10.

Found a ton of gristle though. Every other piece of chicken had cartilage. Over all, still not all that bad. Chili basil chicken was just that over mushy rice. Lots of sauce. Very flavorful, but again, tons of gristle and cartilage. The eggrolls were underwhelming. Especially the watered-down S&S dipping sauce. The Thai Iced Teas (without boba) were very good. I noticed that they water down the sriracha sauce and they also water down the chili paste sauce. Fail. Overall still ok food. At least I thought. \u00a0We get about 4 or 5 blocks away and that's when my MSG allergy kicks in. Totally sucked. Never again. What did I learn???? The rice is way over-cooked and comes out mushy. They water down all their sauces. They use MSG.  This place is a locals spot who like the big portions and enjoy the boba drinks.

Initially it was great food and great service. However the past 2 orders of my were pretty dreadful. Especially the last one. One disclaimer is that there was a new girl there and it was her first day. That usually isn't a problem for me, but what seemed like a simple order turned into a disaster.I called ahead to put in a to go order. There seemed to be something wrong with their phones so I hung up and decided to walk there to put in the order. They called back while I was on my way. I put in an order for ramen pad Thai with chicken but as I proceeded to order the larb buns the lady didn't know what that was. I said it's not a problem I'm almost there I'll place the order in person. So I order the larb buns, pad Thai with chicken, and the fried chicken curry. I said I'll come back in an hour to pick it up after my massage so make it closer to then. She said no problem and so I did. I came back to pick up the food after my massage and the girl had to manually enter each price onto a calculator. I put my phone # down for my 5 stars and the girl didn't know what that was about. I said no problem, and she said the guy in the back will take care of it. I walk back to the apartment and I'm starving. I open my food to find the fried chicken in the curry was soggy because they didn't separate the sauce and the chicken. The buns in the larb bun plate was soggy as well. And lastly the ramen pad Thai with chicken (which I saw her write down chicken, and she asked me several times that it was chicken) was actually tofu and it was extremely spicy. I called back to tell them they gave me tofu instead of chicken and they thought I was calling in to order to go. After a few mins the confusion cleared. The girl was talking to the person in the kitchen and she said she would have to call me back. At this point I was so frustrated with them that I said forget it and just hung up. I feel bad for the girl but damn where was the guy in the back the whole time? There was no one in the restaurant and he didn't even help.

It's spicy, tasty, and very satisfying. \u00a0The red curry with chicken, bamboo, and Thai eggplant is also a winner, less spicy but still hot and delicious. \u00a0I get all my curries with brown rice, and it's decent brown rice that takes well to spoonfuls of curry.I've learned not to stray from the steak banh mi and the curries. \u00a0I was very sorry after the satay sandwich, and I really disliked the pad Thai pasta salad. \u00a0This came with a seal of approval from Serious Eats, but it was kind of awful. \u00a0The spaghetti was bland with an out-of-the-box texture, and the most flavorful element of the salad was probably the unpleasant mass of raw bean sprouts. \u00a0Otherwise there was peanut, cabbage, cilantro, carrots, and a tangy but weak dressing. \u00a0I got the salad with tofu, which was another mistake. \u00a0Esaan's tofu is that rubbery strip kind that crumbles in a weird way while you chew.Now that I've learned all my lessons, I do well whenever I go to Esaan. \u00a0I stick to my favorites and never get tempted to stray. \u00a0You can't go wrong with the curries or steak banh mi, but don't say I didn't warn you if you get curious about the rest."], ["Tammy T.", "I'm a huge fan of pad thai and pad thai in salad form sounded like a refreshing alternative perfect for lunch! (And sadly Esaan is only open for lunch). I came maybe thirty minutes before closing so it was not crowded. They're located right by the U.S. Bank building. I ordered the pad thai salad with beef to go. It came stuffed in a clear plastic container with lots of veggies and meat! Most ingredients were the same as those found in pad thai except for the noodles. Instead of the semi-translucent flat rice noodles they use something more akin to al dente spaghetti noodles. To be honest I was a bit sad at first, but that type of noodle holds dressing better. Service was okay and I didn't have to wait too long for my food."], ["P P.", "This is a pretend-to-be-Asian restaurant catering to yuppies that do not know what real good Asian food is like. Their food is bland, weird tasting and very disappointing. If you are looking for authentic Thai or Asian food, STAY AWAY. I had a chicken sandwich, it was nothing like the authentic Vietnamese sandwich I expected. It was huge with a ton of tasteless chicken. My colleague had a special salad of the day and it was aweful. We usually love Vietnamese and Thai food but this place was a big disappointment. The lack of seating space is a huge turn-off too.Will not be going back, it's a big shame as there are very few Asian restaurants (admittedly most of them are pretty bad) in the close proximity."], ["Tiffany D.", "Great lunch option for dtla. Food is consistently pretty good! Not blow your mind, but definitely good enough to spend your hard earned cash on.I really liked the steak banh mi (sandwich). Delicious! The tom yum is supposed to also be mind blowing. Thai iced tea was respectable too.Nice little patio in the sun to enjoy a little R&R before heading back to the office."], ["Katherine W.", "My my, all these 5 stars. \u00a0Lemongrass grill chicken with garlic rice. \u00a0The brown rice is fine, the lemongrass sauce that you pour over is very good. \u00a0The chicken, however, is another story. \u00a0It's so dried out, it's as if they used the chicken to make soup stock and then took it out once it's devoid of all moisture and flavor, and cut it up for this dish.It does come with a side of cucumber salad, which is nice.Prices are a little high for what you get. \u00a0But I'm pretty sure I'll be back because it's so convenient."]], "Palm's Thai Restaurant": [["Matthew T.", "One of the better lunch specials for Thai. From 11am until 5pm you can order lunch and get pad thai or pad see ew at $6.25 each. $15 is the minimum for lunch deliveries and also the minimum to use credit card according to the delivery guy.I was very satisfied with their service. I called around 4:40pm and they delivered quickly. As far as the food, I really thought the pad see ew stood out more than the pad thai. I think it is one of the better cheap pad see ews I've had. That goes for Thai in Hollywood too and considering Hollywood is pretty much the scene for Thai food.Their Thai Iced Tea was good but wasn't memorable. I'd put this place over Nat's Thai nearby and under Hoy Ka so far."], ["David C.", "I had a wonderful experience at the Palms Thai Restaurant, and their food is too die for! First thing we ordered was Thai ice coffee. The best coffee ever! So much flavor! For food we ordered calamari, pad see ew, green and red curry dishes. The calamari was good but we preferred having it serve with lemons. Maybe a little more crispy would've been better also.The pads see ew was so good. I would've been fine with just this dish. The beef was cooked with perfection and the noodles were cooked well. The green curry was very sweet! I prefer my food salty and spicy! The red curry was the way to go. Both curries had a good variety of vegetables, and you can tell they've been cooking with the sauce boy! #0to100 lol.The service was good, but a little confusing since we had two different servers."], ["Chris M.", "Very busy and popular spot. Been coming here for a couple years now and tried over a dozen different items, all have been good. Good prices on great tasting food, though they do seem to be cutting back on the proteins a little bit. Service is a little odd, ordered 5 dishes and all came out about 5 minutes apart from each other, kind of a bummer when dining in a group. Service is always fantastic, very attentive even on a busy Friday night, Aloha"], ["Irena A.", "It's my must eat place whenever I visit LA. My parents took me to this place when it was just a small restaurant in Thai Town and it's been a joy to see this restaurant grow! Chinese Broccoli and crispy pork is my favorite dish along with the seafood soup! It's truly a Hollywood gem!"], ["Alex K.", "I came here for a late dinner a few weeks ago with a friend. \u00a0We were hungry from working on a project, and since we were in Hollywood, you might as well get Thai.I ordered a papaya salad with salty crabs. The papaya salad was ok, but the salted crabs were just overpowering. They also had a brininess that was borderline fermented. I'm sure it's the way it supposed to be made, but not balanced.I also ordered the spicy wild boar. Crazy hot and spicy, Szechuan influence with large strands of peppercorns and dripping in oil.I didn't see the Thai Elvis; is he still a thing?"], ["Tryphena D.", "*5 stars* I haven't had a meal this good in quite a while!!! After a very nice first-time massage at Sparadise, I was ready to eat. I saw Palm's Thai when I pulled up for my massage and decided that's where I would eat when I was done. I quickly proceeded across the street and was in for a surprise in a couple of ways. The ambience: The space is MUCH bigger than it appears to be from the outside. I expected it to be tiny, considering the other establishments nearby, but that was a misconception. Bamboo tables help keep the decor consistent with the food served. That's important. A lot of restaurants miss that. Don't be a sushi restaurant without a stick of Japanese inspired decor. It doesn't make sense. I noticed a large Elvis Presley statue and what looked to be a Karaoke stage. There were CD's behind it, so that's my assumption. The service: Our server was on top of it! Our drink orders were taken almost as soon as we sat down. We were impressed by the menu. It's almost overwhelming. I did appreciate the way it was sectioned off; soups , salads, fish, noodles, etc. They have lunch specials from 11-3pm. I'm not sure if that includes weekends, but it does include holidays since I dined here on Presidents' Day. After a few times of our server coming back and forth, we decided. We ordered sweet and sour chicken (a mainstay with me whenever I eat Thai--I just love it), Pad Thai, Seafood Combo and a soup that resembled Tom Yum. Our order came out no longer than 7 or 8 minutes after we gave it to our server. Fast! \u00a0Pad Thai- I'm not always a big fan of this dish. However, this was excellent!!! It had hints of smoky and almond-y flavors in there and the chicken was tender and moist! Yum!Tom Yum- Very good! Crisp and extremely fresh! Other restaurants' Tom Yum is so heavily spiced, it makes you want to choke! This was very smooth. The tomatoes didn't come with it and I like tomatoes, so for $1, I added them in there. Seafood Combo- An unexpected order. I saw this dish once I was done placing my order and threw it in there. It was chocked full of squid, clams, scallops, shrimp and imitation crab! I didn't feel cheated; there were no carrot and zucchini fillers thrown in there. Sweet & Sour- They accomplished something that other restaurants cannot master: not making the \"sweet\" taste like table syrup or Agave. It didn't give me a super sweet or sugary sweet taste. It truly was sweet and sour. I loved it.Parking: there's a parking structure located in the same building as the restaurant. The valet fee was low, $1.50; I don't know if that changes with busier times though.You have to buy rice, it doesn't come with the meals. I thought that was odd. Other than that, this was a great, affordable, Thai meal! I didn't even Yelp! this place. I just knew I was going to eat here since it was across the street from my original destination. I see it is a fan favorite for many and now it's a favorite of mine, too. I was pleasantly surprised!"], ["Regina O.", "Came in last night after Create with some friends and all our dishes were only $7-$7.50! \u00a0Score! \u00a0The food was good, decent in size and all came out pretty quickly after ordering. \u00a0 The only thing I question is that when I ordered my beef pad see ew, I asked the waitress to make mine spicy and she said that they are unable to do that? \u00a0What kind of Thai restaurant cant make their noodle dishes spicy? -__- She brought out the spicy sauce on the side for me but it's just not the same!! I've worked in a Thai restaurant before so that just seems unheard of, but oh well. \u00a0Not thaaat big of a deal, I suppose :P"], ["Tuyet H.", "Their positions are huge. That being said, I'm glad I can bring home Togo for a later consumption because it's pretty good. & the fact that they're open pretty late, definitely a plus. Pineapple fried rice with shrimp: 5/5 they don't skimp out on the shrimp and the flavor is pretty strong. I wouldn't mind getting this againTom Yum soup with shrimp: 5/5 I can consume this entire soup as a meal itself because this is definitely my favorite thing to order at Thai places. The portions huge and it doesn't taste watered down like other places. Again, they're really generous with the amount of shrimp they give you. Tom yum kha? (the coconut milk soup base one): 3~4/5 hmm.... \u00a0I'm not fond of milky and zesty soups so it's kinda a no go for me. \u00a0My taste bud was kind of confused as to what I was consuming lol. \u00a0It's not that it was disgusting, \u00a0it's just a strange soup for my liking. It's basically the Tom yum soup with coconut milk added to it. Between the two \u00a0I'd stick with the one without the coconut milk. Parking: 4/5 \u00a0validation in their parking structure for $2 I believe which isn't bad considering you're in LA. Service: 5/5 they were friendly and thorough with questions I had. Even gave me honest opinions with things on the menu I was curious about."], ["Lynda N.", "I love this place! Really affordable Thai food with a great atmosphere and entertainment! The waiters and waitresses are really attentive and the food is always really good.Their pad Thai isn't as soft as others and I love the sauce! Slightly tangy but not overbearing. The pineapple fried rice is also a must. The cashews add a really nice texture and the raisins aren't sweet to make an aversive taste difference. The green curry is my favorite because I love basil but the roasted duck curry is delicious as well! It's basically red curry with duck haha. Everything was so filling but the best part is how cheap it is! Almost every dish except the seafood items are under 10 dollars and the portions are big. I have yet to try their desserts because I am always too full by the end of dinner but I will try to next time!

They are most famous for having a Thai Elvis perform in the evenings. The restaurant is huge and filled with all sorts of decorations (carved wooden cats, even a giant Elvis made of mechanical parts). Our party of six ordered Thai iced tea. Each glass was a little inconsistent with the amount of milk/cream we got (each glass was a different color). Each dish (lunch special) or regular was a pretty small portion. Even a small eater like me didn't get filled up by my own dish. I got the \"Boat Noodles,\" which they call Thai beef noodle soup. It had more ingredients than actual noodles. Would have been nice to trade some of the liver for noodles!I tried a bite of some of the other dishes my party ordered:- Garlic Chicken - it was served with rice and a tad sweet - forgot the dish's name, but it was minced chicken - it was just meat, no rice or lettuce to wrap with it. The meat was seasoned a little salty, but the spicy element was good. - Green Chicken Curry - it was just chicken and some slivers of bamboo shoot. The curry itself was on the sweet side. Overall the food and service was just average. Maybe you get a better experience from the dinner crowd when Thai Elvis performs? There are so many places in Thai town to try. I might skip this one next time. Yelp 100 Challenge - 27 of 100"], ["Tiffany H.", "I used to come to Palms all the time with my family. This place was our go-to spot for Thai food. Our last visit here was a little disappointing though. We ordered the shrimp cake, fish ball noodle soup , coconut soup, pad Thai, shrimp fried rice, pad see ew, and the Thai tea smoothie. The shrimp cake is fried in Panko crumbs and is usually a crowd favorite. However, when we ordered it this time around, we found the shrimp cake to be lacking the correct consistency. It was too soft. Not crispy. The coconut soup was very sour. Didn't really get the rich coconut flavor. The pad see ew was overly sweet and the pad Thai as well. We were quite disappointed with the way our food came out and everyone left quite thirsty. Way too much salt and sugar put into our food. We never experienced that before coming in the past! Such a surprise because I know they pride themselves on being no msg and no trans fat. I really do hope it was just an off day because I love coming here to listen to music and enjoy Thai food."], ["Lam S.", "A great place to eat just down the street from the TCL Chinese Theater & Hollywood Walk of Fame (corner of Hollywood Blvd & Bronson Ave). We've been here twice now and Palm's Thai restaurant hit the spot for a delicious Thai cuisine both visits. We were impressed by the size and decor of the place.Parking - valet for $3. Service - this place was packed! There was a 30 minute wait just to get a table! So that was a good sign, they are obviously doing something right if people are willing to wait just to get Thai food, when there are so many other restaurants to choose from. The service was a little slow but then again, they were so busy! We'll take slow service any day as long as we know we're getting delicious food. Just make sure to make a reservation!We ordered:- Thai tea - served it with the crushed iced, so creamy and perfectly sweet.- Thai papaya salad - a wonderful blend of the Thai triad of flavors: spicy, sour, and sweet! \u00a0It was worth every spicy bite.-Angel wing & fish cake - delicious & tasty.-Crispy battered fish fillets (trout) served with mango sauce. The mango sauce provided a wonderful and beautiful counterpoint to the deep-fried trout, mildly sweet and tangy without overwhelming the wild flavors of the trout. It ended up being a perfect pairing. The only downside to the trout was picking out the bones. \u00a0-Pad see ew - satisfying and tasty. Nice portions, fresh vegetables, chewy noodles, and good amount of meat.-BBQ beef and Pork jerky were also delicious. We can never get enough of them.They also had live music playing. There was an in house entertainer singing popular love songs. It was nice and entertaining to listen while we ate. The only downside is that this place gets PACKED!! Long waits are typical. Nevertheless, it's worth the wait!"], ["Christina P.", "This place is great. The only reason why it isn't receiving five stars is because of the rude valets. They didn't even park our car and they charged the fee. When we were already in the restaurant, they came in to bother us and to tell us to move our car even though we parked in the spots that said Palms Restaurant only. So you have been warned. It would probably be best if you find street parking and don't get pissed off before you even walk into the restaurant and sit down.Anyways, onto the food and drink; we ordered a Thai tea which was pretty good. We Also ordered fish cakes, pad Thai with chicken, pad se ew, trout with mango sauce, pineapple fried rice with pork, frog with basil, stir fried vegetables.Everything was amazing, but the frog legs, we could have done without, and the spicy beef salad was really tangy.
