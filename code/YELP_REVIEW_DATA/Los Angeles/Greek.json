Each order comes with rice, 2 pita breads, and a large dollop of hummus. What my friend ordered: beef kabob with a side of Greek salad and potatoes. The sides look small when they arrive, but I can assure you they're more than enough. My favorite sides were the babaganoush and tzatziki. We enjoyed everything from the hummus, to the rice and the kabobs. There wasn't a single item we did not like. The kabobs were juicy and tender and the rice was perfectly cooked (not dry or wet). \u00a0 All in all, a delicious meal that I would definitely come back for!!"], ["Christopher A.", "One of my favorite places in Los Feliz right now.

Combo #2's portion size was good, not too big or small. Their hummus has a bit of garlic taste to it, which i liked a lot. Chicken was juicy and flavored very well. For the side dish, I got the house salad and that was nothing special. It was drenched in dressing so it was hard to taste the veggies inside. The chicken wrap was packed with meat, veggies, and all the other seasonings inside. It tasted fresh and good. The worst thing about the meal was probably the pita wrap that came with the combo.

Weird thing is, the three of us ordered together (two of us getting the same exact thing), but our food came out 5 minutes apart. Also, I had ordered fries, but they gave me rice (maybe because I'm Asian... jk haha!). I debated whether or not I should even say anything, but because Melanie C. said the fries were good, I told the food runner. Instead of just bringing me a side of fries, she takes the plate back...

She didn't want to deal with them and wait so she just ate the outside of her kabob... something you should not have to do, especially when you're paying $17.Lastly, a guy came over to pick up our plates as we were getting up.

I couldn't tell what the cut was, mebe skirt steak? really good quality beef, i'd get that or the lamb next time. mixed review of the sides. really fresh and soft pita was startling, the 'better' places have bad pita. the rice and salad was so plain jane. where my pickles at?? hummus was good but no olive oil. insulting little tablespoon of tabouleh? timeout for you, mister. amazing heat on those grilled chilis, I cried while I ate. next time, i'd ask to get no rice no salad, ALL TABOULEH! the pita is enough carb to satisfy me anyway."], ["Jose G.", "They are As* holes!!!!

We've been quite busy lately so the boss decided to buy us all lunch on the condition that we eat in. After perusing our cabinet full of menus, we decided to go Greek and unfortunately we opted for the Falafel Corner. In hindsight, we should have just ordered pizza. One of the main gripes we had was that it took over an hour for our food to arrive. Let's just say that we had a lot of irked employees who kept looking at the door whenever someone walked in. I swear, USPS, UPS, and Fedex probably never felt so unwelcome. In fact, I had to hold my coffee pee in until after the food arrived so that I wouldn't be glared at for giving false hope. When the food finally arrived, it flat out sucked. Normally when you are hungry everything tastes fucking good. Unfortunately, my gray-colored chicken shawarma was dry and not marinated well, the rice was whatever, and the salad was some lame iceberg lettuce tossed with Italian dressing. Also, as part of our office order, we ordered extra pita and tabouleh. First of all, the pita tasted store bought and is actually manufactured by International Bread (See Photo Below). As for the tabouleh, it wasn't fresh and the portion was unjustifiably small despite Falafel Corner charging over $4 for it.Other coworkers ordered beef shawarma and chicken plates, but uniformly we were unhappy. Let's just say that the food looked nothing like the photos in the menu. At the end of the day, the menu for Falafel \"Corner\" will be doing just that, it will stay in the dark recessed \"corner\" of our food menu cabinet. *BTW the grilled pepper is really spicy and made my lips numb **If you don't believe me, coworker JK.

It was \"dry-ish\" with some pieces better than others, but did not have the flavor nor juiciness of...well...this place for instance...yelp.com/biz/boustan-mon\u2026 (one of the best in North America - at least 10 years ago)Side salad was ok. Humus was way too...um...sort of overly thick/sticky...if that's the right word...not smooth enough, and again lacking in flavor. If you wanted someone to shut up - like me for instance - this might be a useful glue to shove in their mouths...I find that many Israeli-style Shawarma spots in LA have a similar flavor...almost \"after taste\"...to their food, which does not come close to what I had in Israel nor on the East Coast. Perhaps they get their goods from a similar distributor.All in all though, I always try and hit Lebanese spots for this type of food since in my experience, they have a much more refined culinary tradition, and are not as hampered by religious rules as some Kosher spots are. (this place is NOT kosher though)Price was about 16 something for the plate and a water. Kind of expensive to be frank, for what you get. Any food served on a plastic plate, with plastic forks/knives for over 10 bucks better be damn good. This wasn't.Nice sauces...that seems to be the big draw here.

You can bring in quite a few people and only have to make sure that everyone spends at least $10 for them to be ok with the alcohol. In my experience, they have not been extremely strict but that is the policy. One caveat is that they do not allow hard alcohol, just wine and beer, but they do provide glasses. On another note, they used to allow hookah to be served in the dining area but this is no longer permitted.

Gaby's is the best value for lunch in all of Culver City.

For $8.73 with tax you get a succulent half chicken, ample hummus, dollop of garlic sauce (think Zankou here), 1 cup of delicious rice pilaf, 3 whole pita breads and a side of dipping sauce. Another pro tip, don't eat the pita right away. That sauce they serve with the pita when you sit down is not nearly as good as the pita, hummus, garlic sauce and savory chicken combo that is to come.

The second time (today) the order took exactly 1 hour and 48 minutes to arrive to my house from the time I ordered. I had requested an extra side of tzaziki sauce, and none were given. My fries were soggy and cold, and 1 of the 2 sandwiches I ordered was cold as well. And barely had any chicken in it. The Dr. Pepper was flat. After Eat24 contacted the restaurant about these issues, the manager, Gary, flat out told the Eat24 representative that 1. the order was not late, 2. the food was not cold and 3. the tzaziki sauce costs extra so instead of calling and asking if that was okay they just didn't include it. And that 4. he had spoken to me about the order on the phone. That last one was a complete lie, I had never called them (as you can contact Eat24 if there's an issue with your order). And the order was 100% late, two out of two orders placed there both took almost 2 hours to arrive. So yes, late and cold. The delivery guy (who was very nice) told me it took him 20 minutes to get to my house, so you tell me why it takes them 1.5 hours to make a gyro sandwich.

The food is very good, the people are nice enough, but the portions are tiny and the food is very overpriced. The first time I came here I got the beef sandwich. I paid around $13 and got the side of potatoes. The potatoes were very good and the sandwich was perfect! The beef was well seasoned and it had just the right amount of sauce. It was very, very tiny. I was actually still hungry after eating and was kind of mad that I paid so much for that sandwich. If I would have paid $6-$7 I would have been happy. But since I was pleased with my tiny sandwich I decided to try this place one more time. The second time I got the chicken gyro plate. I paid $15.20 for that plate and just like before the food was good but not enough. The salad was good but that was the only thing that was generously portioned \u00a0 \u00a0The chicken came pressed and it was very thin. It tasted good but it simply wasn't enough. I was pretty disappointed because I paid so much and received so little. Taste is important but so is value.

I'm speaking of the restaurant, and the man himself. After filling our bellies too full with the most flavorful meats on the combo grill plate, along with the vegetarian plate which had a bit of everything, tasty and fresh. We had the fortune of actually running into Joe himself. My friend was on the way out the door, after going back into purchase some lafa bread to go ( even though, as I said we were completely stuffed- lol- had to have some. Thanks yelpers ) Joe was coming in with fresh ingredients for the next day. In the door way he asked if we enjoyed our meal. YES!! So much. I could see that this means everything to him, To have happy customers. Although it was late, and he had told us he started his day around 5am, he chatted with us for about 20 minutes. Surrounded by corporations and huge chains, chugging out the same monotonous glop, I cheer for the small business owner, working hard, caring about quality and loving what they do, even in the face of the momentous workload. I would give this establishment 5 stars on food alone. But having met the man, 10 stars would be more appropriate.

I bookmarked this place a while back and kept meaning to stop by, but we never seemed to make it. Nice to know what we have been missing out on all this time.We both ordered the same thing, chicken shwarma with baba ganoush and double salad since we didn't get rice. I was sad to see that they only have pepsi on tap but then looked over and saw a beautiful display of coke products in a refrigerated case. Crisis averted! We took a seat at one of the nice and clean tables and our food arrived shortly. The server recommended a spicy sauce and brought it over quickly. Everything was fantastic. The shwarma was juicy with crisp edges. The baba ganoush was wonderfully smokey and was perfect to dip the chicken in since we cannot have pita. They also served us a generous portion of salad. The spicy chili sauce paired well with the chicken as well. All in all a great dinner experience that didn't break the bank and left us more than full."], ["Christian B.", "This is my favorite Mediterranean restaurant in the Valley (when I'm in Hollywood I like Ta'eem grill FYI).

I know - I'm only 900+ people late, but we have to give these guys their proper accolades. the Falafel Wrap was ridiculous, each falafel was crispy on the outside and there were ample pieces wrapped inside the lafa (perfect).

Quality is fresh and delicious! \u00a0The pita bread came out hot. Baba ghanoush is my favorite as I am a sucker for eggplant. Don't make me choose between the baba ghanoush and hummus, just give me both! All the meats were well-seasoned and tasty. The salad that came with the grill combo was a refreshing mix of tomatoes and greens. Portions are large! We could not finish everything and especially the meat combo is a great value for your money.

I'll have to come back and try the lafa, which according to the other reviewers is better than the pita!"], ["Ian M.", "This place really is the best. \u00a0The food is great, the prices are reasonable for LA standards. \u00a0The service is good and it never takes too long. \u00a0Did I mention the food?

This plate does not disappoint. We also ordered the lafa bread, I can see why people would love this bread. It was soft to tear and rip apart with ease. I can wrap anything with this I feel like.

Very garlicky which we loved. Delicious!"], ["Skyla B.", "This is about my to-go order. It must have been a terrible off night for the food. The Staff was great, but food wasn't. They gave me an under cooked lafa bread - literally the dough was oozing - luckily, I couldn't wait to try it, so I ripped a piece off as I got in the car and was able to go back in to get it replaced. I ordered a plate with a half & half of swarma & falafel. The falafel was literally the only thing that was good & worth going back for. The lafa, once cooked correctly, was actually really good. The swarma, rice, & salad were so bland it was pointless to eat. On top of the swarma being extremely dry...This place has amazing yelp reviews, which is why I came, so my assumption is that I was the unlucky one & got the terrible ends of what was left over?

Several times, the restaurant is super busy, and the wait a little long, so one of the workers will come out and give everyone a falafel to tide you over. They will give you extra hummus if you ask, and sometimes a little dessert when you're done eating. Also, order the laffa bread.

It was also within walking distance to Little Tokyo, so we decided to eat dinner ahead of the debauchery.Because I'm not super familiar with what's good, I had asked a couple of local friends for some suggestions. Luckily, Spitz was seriously the closest option from where we parked. Down the stairs and it was right there!Walking in, the bar is to your right and you order straight ahead. It's a seat yourself kind of place, so if it's crowded you're kinda out of luck. We had to stalk a couple tables for a seat, but we managed to snag one before our food came out.Street Cart Doner. I had split this with my friend Alex along with the street cart fries for the table. It reminds me of the Greek gyro but in a wrap. Half was filling for me, so a full is definitely worth a meal.Street Cart Fries. Noms! You can't go wrong with fries topped with garlic aioli, feta, onion, green pepper, tomato, olives, sliced pepperoncinis and chili sauce.Fried Garbanzo Beans. I was hoping these would be better, but they were just fried to a crisp atop a very small salad beneath. However, I found that pairing them with the street cart doner or the street cart fries for that added crunch was really good. Aside from that, they were relatively bland. The few fried olives in the basket though, delicious!It's a cool spot to come through for food and drinks. I didn't get a chance to try any of their cocktails, but would love to come back for a second spin.

That's what I have to say about the food here. After an adventure at Universal Studios my girlfriend and I were hungry. She recommended Spitz in Little Tokyo. Getting here shouldn't have been to far from where we were except traffic was b*tch and it still took us an hour instead of 20 minutes. Whatever. I should be use to it. She didn't feel like parking in the structure so I did have to drive around a bit to find street parking. Eventually we parked but it was kind of a far walk but it's all good. They close at 10pm so we were lucky and still able to order food. She mentioned we should order the street cart fries, the pita chips with hummus and the street cart doner in a wrap. I got the beef and lamb and she got the chicken. Food arrived promptly and we both dug in ASAP! I can't say it enough but the food was awesome. My favorite was the pita chip with hummus. Spectacular! It's definitely a must if you're in Little Tokyo. It's a new favorite of mine so I'll be coming back soon. I already love this area so having another type of food beside Japanese is great. Tips- you do order first and then sit down. Since we went late, the place was quiet so noise level was fine. No shouting required. Like I said, street parking or structure.

It essentially is a bowl of crudit\u00e9s with three pieces of falafel. That might upset some people but I used to be raw vegan so I can handle eating a bowl of raw veggies bit.ly/1p04fc0.

I'm not one of those super-strict vegans but for those of you who are or for anybody that has severe allergies, I suspect there's lots of cross contamination here.

I enjoy their feta stuffed doquitos (a fun riff on the taquito with a Mediterranean tang to it) and have enjoyed their doner pita offerings. Their fries are good but are for my tastes over-seasoned. My main issue with this location (as opposed to the 4-star Los Feliz location) is that the pub vibe of this downtown location makes for a less enjoyable dine-in experience. The best pub tables are right in the way of where you order at the bar with the cashier and it can be very loud during peak hours. The best quiet seats are outside but are sparse when it's busy. There's just less room to move around and the Los Feliz location is a better mix of a gastropub/dine-in feel, farm more casual of a place than this location."], ["Martin G.", "Decent food and the service is really helpful and friendly.

PARKING:It's Downtown, what do you expect? Street or lot parkings which you have to pay for.FOOD:Really yummy and reasonably priced. I came in with a friend and we split the street cart fries ($8.25 but $5 during happy hour) and the beef/lamb doner wrap. The street cart fries were HUGE 5/5. The fries were piled with a glorious amount of garlic aioli, feta cheese, onions, green peppers, tomatoes, olives, and pepperoni. The fries were still crisp yet they were doused in sauce (but not too much aioli). The vegetables had a firm texture and gave the fries that freshness it needed. These fries are unlike any other fries that I have had and they are so addicting. The beef/lamb wrap was great as well. I am not a huge fan of lamb due to its gamy taste but this was not gamy at all. The meat was still very tender and sliced to thin pieces. I think it was the beef that complimented the lamb very well. The wrap was reasonably sized too and I was able to take home the other half to eat later. 4/5I have never been here for happy hour, but I hear great things about it.

It had a bunch of cabbage, beef and land, and some feta cheese in this nicely bundled wrap. There's even some kalamata olives in it! Love olives!!!! The streetcar wrap was very similar to the Mediterranean \u00a0except it didn't have the olives and feta cheese. The fries were pretty good. Not too thin nor thick.

My friend got this so I just tried some. I like the presentation, feels like you are getting more food and I like that they put in in different small bowls that way you can eat some sauce separate, instead of having it all in one plate. The dark chicken was okay. I'm not into dark chicken because it's a bit too fatty for me but the flavor was good and simple. _Ground Sirloin ($11) White rice, grilled tomato, and tzatziki sauce. 2 choices of sides and comes with white pita bread. It says basmati but it tasted like broken white rice that I've had at many Asian restaurants. It was warm and fluffy. The tzatziki sauce was more of a thick white garlic sauce.

What a deal! I've tried the hummus, baba ghanoush, veggie rice, cugurt and tabbouleh, but I've never found any of those to be particularly flavorful, so I usually stick with the fries.There is an entire section of the menu devoted to spicy feta -- for good reason. The \"med fries\" ($6) are spicy feta and chopped parsley over fresh-cut french fries. The fries are thick and crispy, and the feta is the perfect hot topping. Delicious. And the portion sizes are very generous.The \"med nachose\" ($7) are weird and amazing. They start with fresh, crisp, tasty pita chips, and then top them with tomatoes, green onions, avocado, feta and tzatziki sauce with either lamb & beef gyros or ground sirloin. Oh my god! This is the most delicious reinterpretation of nachos. It's phenomenal. Nicely done, Cugurt.You can finish up your meal with a large portion of fantastic, sticky sugar. The baklava ($3) is super, super sweet and delicious.They also deliverrrrr, as if this restaurant could get any better. Love it to pieces."], ["Marc H.", "** Food** Price* DeliveryGreat gyros, both chicken and the beef+lamb are great. Dolma is on point. French fries are really good. I haven't switched it up too much here, but I have tried pretty much everything. I usually stick to my norm- a chicken gyro with a side of dolma. Their tzatziki sauce is awesome. Their pizza is delicious too! I was surprised, since it's not a pizza joint. It's a really good size and great ingredients for the price. Pita and hummus is great. Chicken wings are good too!!Definitely a good place to order from. The location has a parking lot and lots of seating. I get delivery since it's in the area, they come VERY quickly.

Got the beef kabob plate. The beef had good flavor but could have been more tender. The hummus was flavorful but could have been creamier. The grilled tomato should have been grilled more; it was still kind of hard on the inside. I will say, however, that the rice was very fluffy and the cugurt was pretty tasty. Bonus points for having a super clean interior, friendly staff, and parking lot out front."], ["Stephanie S.", "I ordered pick up from here this week in a moment of starvation. I got the white meat chicken plate and I finished the meat in about a second. The chicken was juicy and well marinated. Everything after that was NOT GOOD. The meal came with two sides - I didn't realize this was in addition to the meat and basmati rice. So I mistakenly ordered another side of veggie rice. My bad cuz then I just had too much rice but it didn't really matter because I took two bites of the veggie rice and wasn't at all interested in the rest. I thought for sure the dolma would be good, but nope they were also very unappealing. The leaves were tough and veiny and there was barely any filling in each one. The whole thing had a weird taste to it- I've had far better. Despite this, I'm still interested in trying the spicy feta fries cuz it just sounds too good to not try. And I did like my chicken and rice which is what matters but I'd pass on the sides next time, or order differently. The workers were very friendly and helpful.

Another big mark on the plus side is their pita which is standout good. The kebab was ground as mentioned, but much a bigger problem was the lack of any character to speak of. The result was more a slider plate, and not terrible sliders, but not what I expected.Staff is to be complimented for the speedy service and frequent check ins. To be sure, nothing was bad, but nothing was that remarkable, save for the pita and babaganoush.

I guess you can make it up by choosing certain sauces and side items but I wasn't familiar with the sides and what I ordered didn't help much.

Ta-eem Grill has a relatively similar menu to any Mediterranean restaurant but their array of sides makes them much more unique.LOCATION:Right on Melrose. You are surrounded by all those hipster shops. Sadly, there is only street parking but I did not find any issues in finding a spot on a Tuesday night. AMBIANCE:Very casual restaurant. You take your order at the front, take your number, and the food is presented to your table. All of the meats and pitas are cooked in front of you. Once you walk in through the door, you get a strong big whiff of all the delicious meats made in house. FOOD:So much delicious food is presented to your table. I ordered the chicken shawarma plate and my boyfriend got the rib eye on a pita. The chicken shawarma was super tender and served with skin on so you still get that little chew and crunch. 5/5 The chicken was very flavorful and it is served with a side salad and delicious hummus. I literally mixed everything all together and ate it with a piece of their rustic pita bread. The plate was a little over $14 but the plate itself is huge. I was surprised that I killed it myself. By the way, they use A LOT of garlic on this dish. I can still taste the garlic lingering in my mouth....My boyfriend got the rib eye pita which was tasty as well. The rib eye is cut into huge chunks that are still tender. The pita is served with grilled onions and you get to add whatever you want with the sides. The pita was also huge. It was difficult to take a bite of the whole thing. 4/5We also got a basket of fries to share which were not seasoned at first. We went back to the counter and asked for some seasoning and they just threw some cumin on it. 2/5 The fries weren't crisp and kinda oily. I don't even like ketchup, but I doused the fries in it because it lacked flavor.The sides were outrageous (in a good way). You get so many at your table including: pickles, beets, carrots, several different kinds of slaws, more pitas, and other items. The ones I really liked were the pickles and the beets. The pickles were tangy and crunchy. The beets gave off a nice sweetness to compliment the meal because my entree was definitely on the saltier side.SERVICE:I was impressed with how quickly they were able to bring the food out to the table. The guy who took our orders at the front was kinda rude.

The gyro was tender and the pita was pillowy, while the tzatziki sauce was a refreshing touch on the otherwise heavy wrap. The saut\u00e9ed calamari was tender, but the flavor became very repetitive after a while. While these two dishes were good, they were not mind-blowing and not item I would crave or get again.

Hummus was your standard hummus and bread.Overall, it was just the same as any other restaurant ): Nothing to rave about."], ["Alre H.", "Eat It OR Beat It?**EAT IT!!**Food was delicious but I wasn't WOW-ed or blown away.

EAT IT!"], ["Julian A.", "Now, for the famed 450th review comes Papa Cristo's. What is it about this place that has me raving so much about it? Well, come and see for yourself!!Located in the Pico Union area of Los Angeles, Papa Cristo's is a very well known Greek restaurant/grocery store that has been here since the late 1940's. One side of the business has Greek products, food, drinks, etc. The other side is their famed restaurant. I used to live less than 2 miles away from here many years ago. I can't believe it took me so long to discover this place. It wasn't until a few fellow Yelpers had eaten here that I decided to embark on a journey to try this place for myself. Plus. I had never had Greek food, so I figured this was my one chance to do so.I had the Oktopodakia plate, which consisted of grilled baby octopus with a side salad and potatoes. I had no problem finding a seat, as their restaurant seats about a good 80-95 people. Papa Cristo himself rang up my order. What a nice, sweet man. They have a variety of Greek delicacies. I was so tempted to order more than what I had, but the Oktopodakia was what caught my eye. The wait time for my food to arrive was 5 minutes. Amazing! I left here wanting much more. And more is what I'll get because I'll be back definitely! They do have outdoor seating as well as parking located right in the back. And yes, they also do have valet parking! I believe they are closed Monday. What made this experience even more amazing was the background Greek music they had playing. A serene place environment is what I'll describe it as. It does get packed during lunch hours. I can see why. If you haven't tried Papa Cristo's, believe me, this is a gem within Los Angeles that you'll sure appreciate. I sure did!"], ["Brian C.", "Probably the best Greek food in the area. Lots of history here too. It's basically like walking into an old time Greek hole in the wall with attached grocery store, it harkens to a Greektown past. There's a parking lot as well! Score!I always get the gyro, a generous portion of gyro meat, perfectly seasoned, veggies, and delicious tzatziki sauce in a pillowy pita. The saganaki is good as well, salty and savory. Definitely a go to for a down home delicious Greek meal."], ["Brittany F.", "I wish I was blown away with this place the way everyone else seems to be. I found it pretty mediocre. I was in Greece in August and this was a far cry from the fresh ingredients I had on the islands.We arrived at noon on a Wednesday and there was already a line. We waited about 10 minutes and deliberated over what to order. We decided on the kebab plate with lamb and chicken. It comes with Greek salad, fried potatoes, pita bread and tatziki. The food was unfortunately not that flavorful. I really didn't care for the lamb, which was tough and dry. The quality of the ingredients, particularly the protein and the salad were average at best. The beauty of a Greek salad is the tomatoes and cucumbers and their tomatoes were flavorless. Their pita was a little too thick for me. We ordered a couple small sides of hummus and it was lumpy and too thick. The baklava was the best thing we tasted but even it had too much cardamom once you got into it. I'm giving three stars because overall the experience is cool and they offer undoubtedly the best selection of Greek grocery goods in LA.I wouldn't come back here... I'll stick to Tony's in Malibu for my Greek fix!"], ["Marg K.", "We only experienced the lamb gyros and the beef kabob. This was more than enough to feed 2 people. The pita was very warm and chewy. The meat was moist. Enough lettuce and tomatoes inside the gyro to keep me satisfied. The tzatziki sauce had a very clean taste to it. The total was around $40, which included 2 drinks, 1 kebob, and 2 gyros. Could have done without the kebob though since we were already full after the gyros. Next time, we want to try the plates! The inside where patrons sit and enjoy their food is a bit antiquated. However, it goes well with the old atmosphere that the owner is probably trying to convey."], ["Brenda L.", "3.7 stars! The only thing I had here was the gyro which was delicious! However, the meat was just a little bit too salty for me, and it would have been nice if there was a bit more lettuce. That being said, it was very tasty! Also, the seating area is wide and expansive, good for groups!"], ["Felicia G.", "Family favorite right here ! Been going to Papa Cristo's for a long time now. Have never been disappointed and enjoy the service and the food. Many choices for meat eaters and vegetarians alike. Bonus .... the price is also right."], ["Jen E.", "Palatable gyro sandwhich! Beef and lamb gyros with just enough saltiness (at least for me) and savor. So rich in flavor, dressing the meat and vegetables with sauces is unnecessary. This is why I like Mediterranean food. You can party with it without feeling excessively gross afterwards. It's like Las Vegas City minus the sinful. P.S. They also have a mini market."], ["Kim H.", "After wanting to try this place for over a year I finally went in today. The service was okay. The food was over priced $17.99 for the Gyro plate!! The salad tasted like a dirty wet rag. The gyro was way too overcooked and the potatoes were flavorless. Won't be coming back, that's for sure."], ["Jaime L.", "I've never really been a HUGE fan of Greek food - in that to say, I don't like, crave it as I do soup dumplings, ramen, or now, Nepalese lamb makhani or chicken momo. Except, Papa Cristo's may have changed that, seeing as how I'm absolutely convinced that their gyros are sent by Zeus himself. Legitimately, I was amazed by the food. Amazed by the pita it came on, the freshness of the tomatoes and lettuce, the slovekani, the potatoes that come with the slovekani plate, the gyro meat, all the way down to the tzatziki sauce. Every bite. Every dip. Each, and every part of that meal - delicious.So of course I got turkish delight and some baklava (the finger baklava, shaped like...well..a finger). No surprise there, they were fantastic, too. This place caters, it seats a large amount of people, they do a Greek family-style dinner on Thursdays ($24/pp), and it's wonderfully traditional.We can now add \"Papa Cristo's gyros\" to the list of things I crave on a nightly basis, I just wish it were closer to the Westside because I am super lazy."], ["Kim J.", "We stopped by on a Saturday afternoon for a quick lunch and were pleasantly surprised.

The staff are kind, friendly and attentive.

I agree with most 4 to 5 star reviewers here so I don't really have much to add other than the fact that I really enjoyed the vegetarian options they offered.

I was really impressed. Review based on 1 visit, but going back very soon!:: FoodStated as Mediterranean Tapas style on Yelp. Portions are bigger than traditional tapas that I have had. Server recommended 2-3 items per person. I think 2 are sufficient, unless you have a larger appetite. Mine is smaller by American standards. However, I don't peck like a bird, I do eat a decent meal.The Dips come with a homemade pita style bread. Kind of like a good Indian Naan in texture. Delivered in a paper bag to keep it warm.I had two items: 1) the Cucumber & Yoghurt dip, which had 2 thin slices of cucumber on top. I really though it would be more of a cucumber dish for me greens lol, but it was fantastic (most likely much better than I envisioned).Item 2) the Roast Lamb.. Excellent! Really really good. I was going to opt for falafel, but it was a toss up and my server recommended the lamb. Glad I trusted her.:: DrinksOrdered the Vineburry but swapped out the Absolut vodka for gin (tanq 10) - really good. Presentation was excellent. Had two \u00a0even though just a tad sweet for my taste \u00a0..too good.:: AtmosphereLoved it. Darker lighting, but not in a cave. A big modern open space, with cool decor, and lots of people enjoying their night. I was a bit jealous of the ones sitting at the high and longer wood tables.. but my part was rather small for that. Next time!For a date.. Yes, excellent. However, I noticed that part of the room had these big armchair type seats that looked a bit awkward to eat from, since you would have to perch to stay present at the table. Never a fan, but making a judgment from a distance. Also, it's better to sit next to each other than opposite, so try and get a table for 4 just for 2. It's more intimate that way. A little piece of advice ;):: Service & StaffTop notch. Hostesses (yes there were 2) were super friendly with a fun positive attitude, and professional.Server.. She was awesome, even though it was busy, and she was obviously a little stretched. Her recommendations were well received, and without her the order would have been far too much food.:: Value / CostTough call on this one. It is expensive, but not pretentiously so. I found it a good value except for the drinks that seemed a bit steep. My order of 2 cocktails and 2 items was just shy of $71.I have paid far more, and considerably less. Was it worth it? Hands down yes! Would rather a great food and experience for $$$ than a greasy big place for a bargain price. This is my preference.Long review because I really enjoyed this place more than possibly most of the last 1000 dining experiences.Oh yes.. If you got this far YMMV, and KCCO!"], ["Charm L.", "This is a late review, as we came here for a birthday dinner last month (10/3/15). There were 8 of us, and we waited about 30+ mins after our reservation time to be seated. In the meantime, we ordered drinks at the bar. A few of us ordered espresso martinis (which is important because it is relevant to our experience later on).Anyways, Cleo was super understaffed. Everything just took forever. Everything here is tapas style, so we ordered a bunch of things. I think we ordered about 12 items, of which we only received 8. We even got a order of something we never ordered. Trying to order & receive our drinks was crazy, because it just took forever. Our server was great, but he was just too busy. It's definitely not the server's fault that the restaurant chooses to understaff the restaurant, especially on a weekend evening.At one point, another server brought us our drinks we ordered about 40 mins earlier. She brought us a drink that she claimed was an espresso martini. We told her that it was a mocha martini, which we didn't order. She then argued with us that it was indeed an espresso. Another girl & I already had espresso martinis, so we showed her that this is what it looks like. That server continued to say it was an espresso martini. One of our other girlfriends had a mocha martini and showed her. For some reason, this server still insisted she was correct that the drink was an espresso martini. She started giving us an attitude, and she left. We were kind of shocked and laughed in disbelief (See the photo I posted of a mocha vs espresso martini at Cleo). When our original server came by, we told him what happened...and he put in orders for espresso martinis (which we all needed by this time because we had all finished our drinks).All in all, the food was pretty good. Our server was nice, and the drinks were good too. Too bad for the slow service and the weird girl server we encountered during the night. I doubt I'll be back here. There are so many restaurants to try in LA!"], ["Mary M.", "This review only covers the customer service I received (or lack there of) from the front end of the restaurant. I waited almost an hour for my table on my birthday and they charged me for my birthday dessert. Here is my story:I wanted to celebrate my birthday somewhere nice this year so I made a reservation a month in advance for a 7pm dinner on Saturday, November 14. Since it was my first time dining at Cleo, the helpful person on the phone even suggested that I sit in the main dining room (mainly for the atmosphere) for an ultimate dining experience.The week of the dinner, I called to confirm the reservation to make sure that my table is inside the main dining room and NOT at Cleopatra's Table Under The Stairs. The reservation was confirmed.On November 14...7pm - All 11 people in my party had arrived and were ready to eat. We waited about 5 minutes until the host finally led us to our table. She points us to the direction of table under the stairs. I mentioned that this is not what I had requested and that I would like to be seated inside as planned. She agreed and said she will get a table ready for us.7:10 pm - 10 minutes later, the same hostess approaches me and says she's just getting the table ready now.7:30pm - It has now been 30 minutes past our reserved time and we are still waiting for our table. My friends go up to the podium to ask the hosts how much longer we have to wait for our table. All 3 hosts at the front were clueless and didn't seem to be prepping any sort of arrangement for us. One chimes in and says \"the group at your table has a show at the Pantages at 8 so they should be leaving soon.\"7:45pm - I go up to the podium and ask for the manager. I'm sure she already knew this but I reiterated how I have been waiting for 45 minutes already. She responds with \"Well, we tried to sit you in there (pointing at the table under the stairs) but you didn't like it.\" I had to explain to her that it was Cleo who suggested I don't sit there. And it was Cleo who confirmed I am not sitting there. But now I am stuck here in the lobby feeling like I never had a reservation to begin with. She replied \"It's your birthday, right? Happy birthday. We're going to get you seated as soon as possible.\" Her assurance still left me without a solid answer. Right before 8pm, a host finally took us to our table. \u00a0The meal was good and the food service was good. But I realized that not once did the manager approach us to check if everything is going well. Also, am I crazy for thinking this? But I would expect any reputable restaurant to throw in a few appetizers in there for the inconvenience of the one hour wait. But not only did we not receive anything on the house, they even charged me for the birthday dessert that they served.It was all aggravating, frustrating, and disappointing at the same time. I would give Cleo's customer service negative stars if I could."], ["Ani P.", "This is mainly a review of the awful service and not a representation of the fantastic food. It's taken me a while to write this review but after someone suggested we go there next weekend, I remembered the rage I felt the last time I was there and had to say a big \"NO\" and share this story. My friends were appalled! I've been a huge SBE fan for years; have dined at every one of their restaurants in LA and frequent their hotel bars quite often. I've had nothing but excellent service and food in every single one of them until I decided to try out Cleo. I booked a table for 3 to celebrate my mother's 70th birthday a week in advance.We showed up there on a Friday night and the place was packed (to be expected). We were there right on time as I walked up to the counter to check in and was told \"we are getting your table ready, it'll be a few minutes\". 20 minutes later, there is still no word so I approach the hostess again, she says \"well people are paying and are about to leave so it'll only be a few more minutes\". At 40 minutes of wait, I am wondering why they aren't being honest so I walk up to them again and ask and this time they have a major attitude about it as if I am inconveniencing THEM! The nerve! My 70+ years old parents have been on their feet for 40 minutes waiting for a table! at 50 minutes of wait, the hostess tells me that our table is ready. \"What a relief!\" I think but then she proceeds to take us to a dark corner of the hallway BEFORE the entrance to the main dining area and offer us a terrible seat! I politely tell her that it isn't acceptable to wait 50 minutes for a reservation made a week in advance for a BIRTHDAY celebration and be offered a walk-in table. She gets even more annoyed and says \"well then, you have to wait more\". I say we'll wait because I am not going to bring my parents to a top notch restaurant and have them seat at the entrance! At this point I walk up to the manager and tell him about the situation. His response? \"HAVE YOU EVER EATEN HERE?\" I say \"No\" his response? \"WHEN YOU EAT THE FOOD, YOU'LL GET IT!\" - umm.. WHAT? Did he just say that? Are you freakin' kidding me? Is this nobody restaurant manager suggesting that I've never experienced gourmet meals and hence have no idea what it takes? I politely respond that \"I've had many culinary experiences around town and this is not normal.\" he says \"well, there is nothing I can do about it!\" I respond by saying that \"of course you can, you can be more organized in your scheduling and be nice to your customers when you aren't able to deliver on your service in a timely manner.\" - at this point he walks away! NOT ONCE did anyone apologize for this experience. NOT ONCE did they offer to comp a drink at the bar while we waited for over an hour for a table (yes, we got a decent table after AN HOUR of waiting). Had they not lied to my face multiple times and said \"the table is almost ready\", we would have happily left and eaten elsewhere. Mr. Nazarian, I know this is not how you run your businesses but you should know that your employees at Cleo have absolutely no manners and have no problem insulting your patrons. I know for sure that I won't be back. No matter how good the food you serve is, the rude and negative energy at the front door takes away all the fun.

Not spicy really. I recommend dipping it into one of the dips that comes with the pita bread! Spicy cigars - MY favorite! 6/5 )I could order that and eat it all day long. Roasted cauliflower- 4/5 Brussels sprouts- 6/5 -this is what they are known for! Everyone loved it! Instead of preparing the entire Brussels sprouts as is, the leaves/petals(?)/layers have been peeled apart and roasted that way so it's got a bit of a crisp to itRoasted potatoes- they they were cute little baby potatoes - smaller than a ping pong ball even. They looked like hush puppies almost. :) 4/5Then I had their grilled shrimp and marinated chicken , while my nieces got the chicken ragine (it comes out in a cool looking pyramid shaped dome, and lamb and steak kabobs. I'm not a fan of lamb so when I was offered a piece to try it I thought it was a bit overwhelming. But it seemed to have had a lot of flavor to it. The steak was very good though! My chicken kabob was very well marinated as well, the shrimp was good but I was too full to finish it. For desserts we had baklava, green tea frozen yogurt , and chocolate cake. Baklava and chocolate cake was a big hit. Green tea should just stick with being a tea or ice cream. Cheers! If you're seeing a show at 8 which we were I recommend getting to the restaurant at 6.

We rarely come out to Hollywood so when we got the opportunity to come see Jerry Seinfeld at the Pantages, there was no question about coming to Cleo.

My sweet husband walks up to check in and ask the hostess if they were open yet. She replied \"in two minutes.\" We were not in a hurry so we sat at the nearest chairs. Not even 10 seconds later, a couple walks up asking for a table. They explained to the hostess, they did not have reservation. She takes them right in. After about 10 minutes, the hostess ask us what name the reservation was under. She couldn't find it for good few minutes. Finally, she looks again in her screen, finds us, and seat us by the bar. I asked her if there is any available table inside the restaurant and she annoyingly replied \"Everyone has requested to sit inside.\" Umm... Are you kidding me? The unnecessary tone should have told me just to leave but again, we patiently waited back at the chairs. After about five minutes, the same hostess took us in. There were plenty of seats inside! Why? Because we were here right at the beginning of the dinner time. And keep in mind, we dined from 6:25-7:45pm with plenty of seating. It's unfortunate and completely unnecessary when an unpleasant person power trips right before dinner. Not only that, as we sat down, she proceeded to talk crap and pass notes like grade school child to one of the girls that helped get our drinks. My own kid doesn't even behave like that. And I did not expect this kind of bad behavior at a nice restaurant. Other than the mean front lady, my husband and I had a delicious meal.

They gave us extra free of charge :) Branzino was super tender, not fishy at all, and the pilaf mixture with the creamy sauce was perfect. The flavor is unique and was welcome after all the meaty kabobs we inhaled prior to being served this dish. Chopped salad is okay but too salty. The eggplant lasagna type of dish was a bit took mushy and salty for my taste but super cheesy. The real MVP was the Brussel sprouts OMG whatever you do make sure you get this!! Times three orders.

This came as a surprise to me because it was a Tuesday night, but as we were seated I can say they definitely were busy. The restaurant is quite intimate. The tables were too close to one another for my taste. It left no room for privacy. Also, it's pretty loud in there so it was hard for my friend and I to hold a conversation without feeling like we were raising our voices or constantly repeating ourselves. The food was quite delicious. It's essentially a Mediterranean tapas restaurant. They suggest around 3 dishes per person but I have to say that that would have been way too much food for us. I say start with about 3 dishes per 2 people and go from there. Everything we had was great. My only complaint is that my lamb tagine was about 80% fat and 20% meat.

The Babaghanoush and Labneh with Feta dips were tasty, and served with freshly baked bread (we asked for a good amount of extra bread).The Tuna Tartare was fresh and delicious, but the portion was so tiny. Probably not worth the price.For some reason, the Clam Flatbread did not taste good at all during dinner, but when we ate the leftovers the next day it was tasty--maybe it was the combination of dishes we ate? I had a bite of the Mushroom Flatbread and didn't taste anything spectacular.We ordered the popular Brussels Sprouts. The flavors were good, but it was way too oily for my taste. They do fry it, so it's not unexpected, but it would've been nice if they drained off the oil more before serving it.The Chicken Tagine was a decent sized portion (unlike most of the other dishes), but there was nothing special about it. It tasted pretty bland to me.Our waiter recommended the Grilled Daurade, which was an excellent dish. The fish was flaky, and the sauce was unique and paired well with the fish.The drinks were average prices for a high end restaurant. I ordered the Spiced Ginger Mojito, which was tasty, but not very strong. Service was okay. The place was busy, and sometimes we had to flag down the waiter, but he did check on us every once in awhile. We were there for almost 2 hours, and we eat fast, so some of the dishes took awhile to come out.As for ambiance, it would've been nice if it wasn't so crowded. The tables are way too close to each other. Someone sitting behind my fiance coughed, and my fiance felt something wet land on his arm--GROSS! I would've given that guy a dirty look, but it was way too dark for him to even notice me. It's not the restaurant's fault that guy couldn't cover his mouth properly, but this just shows how cramped it is in the restaurant.

We asked our server what this was and she said it was for DineLA customers. Nowhere on the menu stated this, so I wasn't too happy about that. I don't mind paying a 20% tip, it's really the principle and assumption that annoys me. Also the fact that our server wasn't that great doesn't help (she took our drink orders 20-minutes after we sat down and in that time took the food orders of parties that sat down AFTER us). The second thing was that no tables, including us, were given the DineLA menu. It was only given to us after we asked for it. In my four years of doing DineLA, I have never seen a participating restaurant \"hide\" their DineLa menu. Ever. Every restaurant up until now has always promoted it. This was very weird to me.Otherwise, our experience at Cleo was perfect.

Something about the spice was lacking to me.Beef Cigars: Adorable! Beef in puff pastry. Think of them like a mediterranean taquito. Served with a very yummy yogurt sauce.Roasted cauliflower: These were outstanding for me. Loved the cashews and pickled onion mixed with the cauliflower. So good!Course 2:cucumber chopped salad: very similar to the chopped salads at persian restaurants. Chopped onion, tomato, cucumber,etc tossed ever so lightly in lemon juice and cumin. \u00a0Really enjoyed this salad.Optional 10 dollar upgraded brussel sprout salad: An absolute must!!!! They pull the leaves from the sprouts and flash fry/saute them in something heavenly. OMG one of the best dishes on our table, and that is really saying something!Course 3:Chicken Tagine:Very flavorful and moist chicken. Didn't even need a knife. Served in a cute little dutch oven. The chicken is atop pilaf and served with almonds and olives garnishing the top. If you like a Moroccan flair, this dish is for you!Chicken and beef skewers: very flavorful chicken, but I liked the skirt steak even more. It was marinated in brown sugar, and the skewers are served with this chili sauce on the side. I dug the sweet and hot flavors mixed together.Course 4: Dessert!!!Sticky toffee pudding: Served a la mode with a caramel crispy garnish. I'm not crazy about toffee, but this was an amazing dessert!Baklava with cinnamon ice cream: Need I say more. Some of the best baklava I have had, and the cinnamon ice cream wasn't overwhelming.

Chicken and shrimp kebabs were juicy and so flavorful, enjoyed every single bite of it! We did not like the Pork belly at all! Sent the whole dish back.

However, I can probably eat this for a week straight and not get sick of it. The brussels sprouts are coated with a nice acidic vinaigrette and sliced almonds. \u00a0Tuna Tartare: ($13) This didn't wow my tastebuds, but it was still enjoyable. If you get it, you get it, if not, you're not missing out on much.Seasonal Mushroom Flatbread: ($14) Sadly, this was my least favorite. Mainly due to the burnt sides. I wasn't sure if the bitter taste of the flatbread was due to the burnt pieces or the veggies on it.Grilled Hanger Steak: ($15) Very juicy, chewy, delicious. This would be my number 2 favorite right after the brussels sprouts. I'd recommend this as well.Evian Water: ($9) Now this... I feel lied to. When our waiter came by, he asked us, \"Would you like house water? Evian or Sparking?\" Now... was he giving us 3 options? Or was he telling us there is only Evian house water or sparking? Well, we decided to pick the Evian not realizing it was $9. So if you don't care much for tap or bottled, I'd suggest you ask for the house water. Service: Loved how quick they were with the food. Immediately after being seated, our server made notice that we were in a rush to make it to the Pantages. She sped the food up and the service and made the night very enjoyable.Price: It is tapas style so just know that you will be eating maybe two to three plates per person, paying nearly $30 or more per person, and not being full.

The reason for the 2 stars is the service, should be 1 but I bumped it for the food. Came here for a birthday with a party of 10 since I heard great things about the food. Right from the beginning when we greeted the waiter I could tell he wasn't going to make the night better for us.FOOD:Borek (4): The cheese inside was creamy, really good. In a puff pastry which is different than traditional borek but I liked it.Spicy Potatoes & Cilantro Aioli (3 stars): nothing special.Hummus (5 stars): Creamy and delicious.Babaganoush (5 stars) Lamb tagine (5 stars): melt in your mouth lamb. Chicken tagine (5 stars): melt in your mouth chicken.Brussel sprouts (4 stars)Chicken kabob (4 stars): moist but I liked the tagine better Mushroom Flatbread (3.5 stars): wasn't as good as everything else Merguez Flatbread (3.5 stars) : wasn't crazy about the lamb sausage DRINKVineburry (5 stars): if you love cucumber and a little spice in your drink definitely get this. Really good. SERVICE (1 star) Patrick our server wasn't great from the start. And then things got worse despite us still being nice and polite to try and keep the dinner going well. Yeah, a big group can get hectic but we were not a group of inconsiderate drunks.Offense 1: Spilled some alcohol drink on me when bringing it to the table. Didn't even apologize. After about 2 minutes and me grabbing a napkin to wipe my sweater and pants he made some smart comment about vodka on me....yeah, thanks.Offense 2: No smile at all. I'm trying to think if I can even remember 1 smile from him and I can't. Everything about him just gave off a vibe that he didn't want to serve our table. \u00a0I was even getting offended and embarrassed that I chose this restaurant for my boyfriend's birthday and his friends were getting service like this. Offense 3: Was no wear to be found multiple times and barely checked on us. Mostly it was us looking for him to try and order more food. Offense 4: I brought my own cake in for the birthday and he brought it out for the birthday song. He then took it back to cut it up (which took WAY too long). Anyways we thought he cut up the whole cake and divided it evenly. We paid the check, and got back the credit card receipt, he finally said his ending Happy Birthday to the birthday boy. \u00a0We got up to leave when I realize my cake pan was still with them so I wait for Patrick but he doesn't come out for a while so I ask someone to go get him for me. When he sees me he asks what I needed and when I tell him I need the pan he then tells me by the way there's still cake left and we will bring it out to you....so basically if I didn't wait to ask for my pan back they would have kept 1/4 of my cake. Shady!! He even said bye to our table and everything and did not mention the cake!I asked to get the cake cutting fee waived ($3/person) and he said he'd have to ask the manager. He didn't bring the manager over but he did waive it, so that was 1 positive, otherwise I probably would have gone beast mode on him. My table ordered probably over 18 double shots of high end liquor and tons of food. Unfortunately, because of the gratuity charge he got about $100 tip. Ridiculous!! Servers really make or break your night and he broke ours. Moral of the story: If you already feel a bad vibe from your waiter when you first meet him, ask to be moved ASAP.I spoke to the director of operations and he said Patrick is one of their top servers....Really?? Maybe he was having an off night. So much just went wrong and piled one after the other. I'll be back and update my review then.

Cleo's was recommended to us by a friend who lives in Hollywood and it ended up being a great recommendation. So why 4 stars instead of 5? Here's why: 1: place is super, super busy and our server had (at least what felt like it to us) a huge area to serve. While they offset this by having additional runners and busboys coming to and from...it made it difficult to order drinks. Our server was very friendly, but I feel like she was spread too thin. 2: Upselling. Okay, maybe it's just me, but I have never NOT been offered regular tap water at a restaurant. Cleo's was smooth at upselling us a $9 bottle of Evian. Yes, $9. We were rationing our $9 bottle of H2O until we saw the table next to us ask and receive a bottle of \"regular\" water. Well played Cleo....well played. 3: Ya better like your neighbors. This place is cute, but man, oh man are the tables packed in tight. So tight that any chance of an intimate conversation goes right out the window. A little more elbow room would be much appreciated. With that said.....none of this would stop us from returning to Cleo. Here's why: 1: the food. oh. my. goodness. the food. every single dish we ordered was delicious. Cleo's recommends 2-3 dishes per person. Each dish is meant to be shared and I would say this is spot on. We ordered 5 dishes....the Greek Salad, the Spanikopita, Duck Bastilla, mushroom flatbread, and the tuna tartar. I would trade one of my kidney's for one of Cleo's Duck Bastilla. One of the best bites of food I have ever had. The Tuna Tartar was awesome....and these two dishes alone I would NOT share when we go back. I want one of each...for myself. The salad...meh. Good...but not worth getting again. The Spanikopita was tasty as was the flatbread...but I would branch out next time. 2: the drinks. oh. my. goodness. the drinks. Hands down some of the best cocktails we have ever had while dining out. The Clementina was just the right amount of orange and spice and my husband will forever love Cleo for making a legit Old Fashioned.....or as it is known at Cleo's the Old Hollywood. Pretty pricey at $15 a pop....but hey, I would rather pay a little more and know that the drinks taste great. So, the pros far outweigh the cons here at Cleo. It is a short walk to Pantages from the restaurant and I would go there again the next time we are in Hollywood. The place is very popular, so I would recommend a reservation.

My only complaint is that I don't think they actually list everything on their menus for what they put into the food. I am allergic to pine nuts and intolerant to mint. An hour after eating my intolerance to mint definitely kicked in even though I had told them I was allergic to both items. Mint was definitely somewhere in my meal even though it wasn't on the menu.But even with that, the food was delicious. The flatbread is super thin and very flavorful.

Parking is lot and the inside is casual and cozy. Great selections from the menu and a little bar for your choices of sides. _Chicken Lule Kabob (ground chicken) Generous portion of kabob. The chicken was very moist and very juicy. Not dry at all which happens with a lot of chicken. Comes with your choice of 2 sides, rice or salad, and pita bread. The pita bread was also good but I ate most of the rice. Had to pick one carb and the rice was pretty good and soft. _Lule Kabob (ground beef) This was also great. Very tender and moist. The beef was very juicy and the flavors were very mild yet bold. Also comes with the same choices as above. Hard to decide which one to get between the 2 meat, the owner (whom I believe) was very nice and gave me both for the price of one since I just could not decide. Very sweet! Although I must say I did prefer the beef a bit more. _Chicken Shawarma. My friend got this and it's different from your usual Shawarma. The chicken was cut differentlly. Instead of thin slices like most it was more chopped. \u00a0It also had some spices like curry and maybe cumin. This was just okay. A little to salty for me.

I do wish the chicken had a bit more spice or flavor to it, the steak kabob on the other hand is well seasoned.Sometimes the side dishes are hit or miss, for example the other night their rice was clearly made with too much water and was soggy; the cucumber yogurt was watery instead of creamy like a thick Greek yogurt, how it should be. They used to have excellent ikra (eggplant in red sauce) but changed the recipe and now it tastes nothing like before.They do have a nice variety hummus, but their failure to cover them in the counter display causes that unappetizing layer that quickly forms on top of these types of dips and makes me never want to order them.I fundamentally disagree with their charging 50 cents for garlic sauce, this is a staple condiment for this cuisine; the worst is when you simply forget to ask for it and get home with NO garlic sauce which practically ruins the whole experience. I also think they should throw in a lemon wedge for just such an occasion.The girl who works at the counter is a snoot and I practically stopped going here \u00a0because of her alone. This scenario has happened repeatedly: I've called in an order, arrived 20 minutes later per their request, then the counter gal has made me wait an additional 20 minutes without apology.

When ever I try something new, especially ethnic, I try to get a dish that is distinct to that nation's homeland. So here is what I got:- Saganaki ($10) = All this is is fired up cheese with lemon juice. They bring it to you and fire it up to give you a show. How did it taste? Exactly how it sounds. Fried cheese with a squeeze of lemon on top. Not worth it, plus I had this almost exact dish at Olive Garden and it was better there than here. So I guess this is the Greek version of fired up cheese. 2/5- Gyro w/ lamb & chicken ($13) - I didn't want to leave the place without having a gyro which of course is very Greek. It was a nice, fresh lunch food that is an alternative to a sub sandwich. How did it taste? Think of a chicken/lamb sub sandwich wrapped in a pita bread \u00a0with a feta cheese kind of flavor to it. That's really it! Nothing too special and not worth $13! 2/5- Sparkling water ($6) - little bit pricy but OK.

We ordered medium cook for the steak but it was over cooked, something like well done. but I could handle that.As soon as the seafood salad arrived, I was like what is that smell? the seafood was fire cooked but the old fishy smell was very unpleasant. I thought I was just sensitive so I tried the shrip and \u00a0scalop which were ok. then I had a bite of the salmon, and it was GONE BAD. Actually almost rotten. I had it in my mouth and I had to spit it out. sigh! My bf said he tried the salmon and it was ok. then I handed mine and he smelled and he was like Oh shoot!! We took a careful look, and actually the chunck of salmon was from different fish. It was leftover from different salmons that they used, so some of them was fine, but my chunk was rotten.He called the waiter and we explained and he took it back. the rotten salmon had so intense taste and smell that I had to go to the restroom to wash my mouth. I almost threw up!I didn't wanted to ruin our date dinner.... and we were so hungry since it was 9pm already. The waiter came back and said the smell is from charcoal. Come on! I'm bbq maniac so I know how charcoal smells like. We were like, the restaurant doesn't want to admit since they could get in trouble if they admit they served a rotten fish. I can understand that. But they didn't do anything to make our dinner pleasant neither.The waiter suggested another fish dish but I was like no more seafood from here. so we ordered meat sauce pasta($18). It was ok, the pasta was little uncooked. I still could feel the rotten fish in my mouth... it was awful. When we asked for the bill, the waiter apologied for what happened. but nothing was on the house or something to make the customer little happy. Maybe because there was no manager? The service was below our expectation.We still gave decent amount of tip, and we left since we are never going back there again.So basically, we went there to get some healthy food and spent about $80, and we ended up having over cooked steak, uncooked pasta, and rotten fish!if I had swallowed that rotten chunk of salmon, I could have gotten a food poison or something... sighit was the worst dinner I have ever experienced :("], ["Nicki Z.", "Food was dry and tasteless I have been to Greece many times and was hoping to experience something similar ,well it did not happen !Brought my parents ,and ordered beef the beef was so hard they could not even chew on it .they decided to take a chance with exchanging the dish and order chicken ,easy enough but not here .they forgot to put the order through and did not bother to inform us about it .half an hour later we just canceled and left hungry \u00a0and angry.Not recommended at all!"], ["Alex B.", "Best lamb gyros I've ever had. \u00a0Super tender, not tough or chewy at all. \u00a0Flavour was great. \u00a0The restaurant itself was pleasant and roomy. \u00a0The staff were very polite and attentive.I will definitely go back here if I'm ever in the area."], ["J S.", "The menu has been updated and is much more affordable now.

We ordered the chicken kabobs, the spicy sausage and other great plates. The cons were the length of time to get refills and some more bread to finish off our our appetizers. We had to ask for more ice during refills. We had to ask for bread several times before it arrived and the food took longer than expected.Aside from the minor cons, this place is good and I will go back as a regular customer because I like Greek food and the pricing was a bit pricy but survivable."], ["Ilya R.", "Microwave food.

A year ago when I ate here, I didn't want to write a review because it was an amazing place that I didn't want people to flock to. I guess I should have praised how well they used to do things because they lost that dynamic. First off we start with the only good tables in the restaurant being empty with a reserved sign on them through our entire dinner service. Mind you, there were plenty other tables open they could have blocked off, but they choose the ones in the veranda doors overlooking the outside. For 45 mins they sat empty and remained so when we left. What a bad way to irk your customers that are actually there. Then you get to the food, apparently this place doesn't believe in free bread. Every basked you ask for is charged, ok. Then the water is charged for. Ok, is it sparkling water or something special? No it is 1/4 wanna-be sparkling water and the rest their tap water. Ok, at least the utensils and plates you eat in are free. The food is bland at best, the chicken plate was lacking the spices of greece. Their sad excuse for a greek salad makes me cringe. The tiny pieces of cheese crumbles are a sad way to present a salad. I would expect crappy tasteless meals like this at Burgerking not at a place at the grove. If they can't deliver in taste and customer service they should close up shack and make room for a decent place, avoid this dump."], ["Terri B.", "We stumbled across this place after enduring a 14 hour flight. \u00a0Sydney has a huge Greek community, so we are saturated with Greek restaurants. \u00a0Sydney-siders know what good Greek is just like LA residents know good Mexican.

Well this place is amazing. \u00a0The Greek salad was generous in portion and generous in taste. \u00a0It was as authentic as any Greek salad I've ever tasted and made the Greek salads back in Sydney taste like your everyday puny green salad. \u00a0 The calamari was spectacular - lightly battered, fresh, nice. The lamb gyros was to die for. \u00a0It comes with chips. \u00a0The chips, well I have to give it to the Greeks, they make good chips. \u00a0They really know their chips.

The sorbet melted and tasted like medicine, but the martinis are delicious!All were flavorful, fresh, and scrumptious. I would highly exon need the eggplant & caviar hummuses and the gyro.

A group of 4 should fit fine.The free bread appetizer was nice and buttery. A pleasant crust.Appetizers were in the $10's and many entrees were around $20 (I was there for dinner and the dinner menu was more expensive, it seems).I ordered the Lamb Shank ($25) as it was recommended among lamb dishes. \u00a0Pretty overrated for the price. \u00a0There was a lot of it, a bit salty for my taste and it reminded me of pot roast. Perhaps it was just not my style. The Greek Plate, however, was pretty tasty with a good variety of cheeses, vegetables, herbs, and meat. The portions were quite big, which was a plus. The service was friendly. \u00a0Overall, though, a bit too pricey for what I had. \u00a0Admittedly, I'd rather go to the Farmer's Market for a comparable and/or better variety of (and more organic) flavors with better prices.The restaurant validates for two hours of free parking in the Fairfax lots.

The service is always top notch also...I accidentally knocked over my wine glass (which was almost empty) last time I went there, and the server came back with a new glass of wine, filled to the brim!For food, I have ordered the gyros plate which was quite good, but such a huge portion. All portions are very large, you may want to consider sharing dishes. They have an appetizer where you can select different dips, which is always delicious, and fun to mix & match. The flaming cheese appetizer is a lot of fun as they light it on fire at your table! The last two times I have been I ordered the special, which they clearly take a lot of care into because they were delicious both times. Last time, I had a phyllo wrapped salmon filet with tapanade inside (really yummy).

I've come here for years and years and have never once had less than a superior experience. I've probably dined here 6 times in as many months and I'm really surprised at the 1 and 2 star reviews posted here.To begin, Ulysses Voyage is *within the Original Farmers Market*, it is not at The Grove. \u00a0As a regular at the Original Farmers Market, I enjoy Ulysses when I need a seriously relaxing experience alone, and/or I am dining with someone very special. Gratefully, I usually have the same server from Greece, Paras, who even remembers my favorite wine and what foods I've enjoyed there on previous visits.Last night, a busy Friday, was such an extraordinary experience, it inspired me to finally write this review. At a cozy warm inside table, my cousin and I were treated as if we were royal subjects. Between the bus servers and our main server, every single detail was tended to, and we were both made to feel entirely special.Our plates were perfectly prepared, each more delicious than the next. I highly recommend the flaming cheese, this was the first time I've had it at Ulysses and it was superb! With more than enough warm pita, we were in heaven. The dolmades with meat and rice, surely excellent; the chicken gyro plate, perfect in every way- we especially loved the roasted potatoes and only wished there'd been maybe 100 more of those. We also loved the Greek red and white wine, per Paras' recommendations.When my cousin suggested we go maybe go somewhere different for dessert, it took very little to convince him that we ought to explore their dessert menu first, and I was loving the quiet atmosphere so we could really enjoy our conversation. Paras actually recited the desserts to us and we were smart enough to order the \"Greek festival\" offering - little fried dough balls in a honey-cinnamon syrup, with vanilla ice cream on the side. It was positively exquisite and I will be forever grateful for this recommendation. I promised Paras i would be back a million times, if only for that dessert.I am sorry for those who have not yet experienced this treasure quite this same way, and I wish they would consider ... being open to having a new experience if they tried dining here again. On that note, I will tell you that my first and only trip to Athens, Greece, many years ago, did not equal my favorite travel experience. And, I am entirely open to returning to this amazing city again soon, with that very inspiration in mind - to have a new experience. \u00a0Meanwhile, I will dine at Ulysses Voyage over and again.

Well, I finally did and it's nothing special. We live right up the street and decided to have breakfast here w our little one on a Sunday morning. Oh and for those of you w kids, there are high chairs. There were a good amount of people here but not packed so no need to call ahead to make reservations. They have free parking in the lot next door. It's somewhat attached to the motel next door so you tend to see people walking passed w luggage here and there if you sit outside. I read the reviews before giving it a try and everyone made it sound so amazing and to die for. Eh. I cannot quite speak on whether it's amazing or not because I only tried their breakfast. But I will say, pancakes are tasty- then again, hard to mess those up. Their servings are big, so definitely leaves you full or w leftovers to take home. Everyone on yelp seemed to rave about their eggs and to be honest, I wasn't a fan of their eggs. They were a bit too soggy for my liking. I ordered my little one a side of eggs and since she's too little to eat w a fork, she eats w her hands and they kept falling apart. Soggy and greasy. \u00a0Oh, and I wasn't a fan of their coffee. I will say though, their customer service was on point!!! Our waiter was awesome and attentive. He had a great bubbly personality. I am all about the customer service and in this case they had it together. But again, it's nothing to write home about. So, all in all, they get 3 stars for both the great customer service and the free parking! Will I be back? Maybe to try their dinner. Maybe.. But I am in absolutely NO rush."], ["Sylvia R.", "I came here for lunch. I was nearby and based on the reviews popped over. There was plenty of parking, which is precious in this area. I was able to sit, order and eat quite quickly. Given how hungry I was, I really appreciated this. I ordered a lentil soup and spinach salad. I had eyed they hummus, but I'm glad I didn't order it because they bring you hummus and pita bread anyway. Simple yet scrumptious. I'll be back for the kebabs later. The only reason I have it a 4 stars was the construction next door which made it confusing to figure if it was in fact open or not. That and the bathroom situation. It was decent enough, just a tight squeeze if you're waiting."], ["Wendy G.", "I haven't actually been to this place but I got take out from here. I have to say the food is pretty great here. The sausage is good. The Huevos Baja is really good its scrambled eggs with cheese guac beans salsa on a corn tortilla. I ordered fresh orange juice to go and they were very good at packaging everything making sure it wouldn't spill. I have to say the potatoes weren't my favorite though so I would maybe skip on those. The take out service was super quick so definitely come here if you just want to beat the brunch lines and just have good breakfast at home. When I went to pick up myorder the place looked pretty big too so I'm sure this is a great place to come dine in as well."], ["Betty S.", "A must stop for breakfast / brunch every time I am in LA.

In the shadow of Farmers Market to the West, and all the glorious places on Beverly -- I am so happy to return here.I've discovered (or realized) that I like their pancakes more than DuPars. They are thinner, which helps them stay moist even before you put syrup and/or butter on. I'm sure there's plenty of butter in the batter. Bottom line, I really like these pancakes!When you get the Big Deal or Big Combo (can't recall what they call it), it comes with your choice of meat and eggs. At a table where everyone ordered different eggs, we were all very happy. I went for poached, which were great. For some reason, some places don't quite get it when they do poached. I didn't have to ask about a particular temp or runniness for the kitchen to simply deliver Perfection.Go for the Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice. A small is huge. Sounds crazy, no?

I sat on the back patio and ordered a coffee, eggs, sausage, and potatoes. The eggs and sausage were tasty. The potatoes were good once you added salt. The coffee was very watery, I tried adding some Irish cream syrup to it, but that didn't help. Maybe skip the coffee and try a cappuccino? The service was great! To be able to walk in and get seated for breakfast right away on a Sunday scores points with me.

I love that it sits right in the city, but feels like I am at a place far from LA. They give amazing portion sizes and everything is delicious! They have had the same cooks for 40 years~!

They could use some decor updates,, but it is also part of their charm. The staff is super sweet as well!"], ["Caitlin C.", "This place is by far my favorite spot for brunch or a casual meal.

This place is seriously our \"Regal Beagle.\" At this point, I've sampled most of the menu, and the folks at Fiddler's never fail to disappoint. On the breakfast/brunch front, I'm a huge fan of the chorizo scramble, corned beef hash, pancakes and the croissant French toast. For lunch and dinner, you can't go wrong with the stuffed chicken breast, meatloaf. If a self-induced food coma isn't your thing, they also have a good variety of salads and sandwiches to fit wherever you're currently sitting on the healthy/gluttonous spectrum. Perhaps betterr than the food is the staff. Great service is par for the course. Even when the place is packed, say, for Sunday Brunch, I've never felt that we've had to wait for too long or, on the flip side, felt rushed. They strike a good balance. Moreover, everyone is super-friendly (in a good way). In sum, great food, great service; truly a breath of fresh air here in LA."], ["Patty J.", "Great food, no wait and a full bar! I rediscover this place each time my friends and I discuss where to go for brunch. Anywhere decent in town requires \u00a0either a long wait or a reservation.... When I can't handle those options, I remember Fiddler's. Pass on the coffee, it's very standard diner brew but everything else is surprising. Free and ample street parking. Great egg white scrambles... Try the El Greco, that's my fave. Sun dried tomatoes, spinach, feta cheese and your choice of fruit of potatoes... And oh yeah, don't forget the full bar! If you know the recipe they'll make it your way. Now that's service!"], ["Yana C.", "This place boasts a large and confusing menu comprised of greek, mexican, italian, and American food, not to mention random extras like lox and calamari. Speaking of calamari, stay away from it here. I actually peeled off the thick bready batter to confirm that there was indeed a calamari ring in there. And there was, but barely. The Mediterranean platter was simply average with the best part being the spanakopita which gushed melted feta knotted with ropes of spinach. The worst was the dolma which were weirdly and unappetizingly sweet. The olives, far too bitter, the hummus and babaganoush, unmemorable. I did love the pepper dip provided with the bread and could have eaten a bowlful of it with a spoon. They also serve excellent OJ, definitely fresh squeezed and full of pulp and occasional seeds.

She would constantly come check on us for such like refills, more orders, extra utensils etc. Now, since I was not craving much of a breakfast entree I went with the lamb burger, which was surprisingly very tasty!

I remember light music in the air as well. Service can be a bit slow, but the dishes are worth the wait.I started with the gigantes, a large lima bean stewed in tomato and dill. It was so rich and luscious that it could have been a meal on its own. I proceeded with the chicken souvlaki, which was very well seasoned and came with salad, rice and veggies. I really can't emphasize how good the food is here, I remember the most wonderful lamb shank in a thick tomato sauce that knocked my socks off with yum. Good portion sizes as well.

One of them was also whipped caviar which was good until I realized what it was haha. I had the vegetarian plate which I think was delicious but could have been a bigger portion for how much it was (14 bucks). My friends all got gyros which they loved.

The hummus is divine, so is the Taramosalata (whipped caviar spread). The little spinach-filo pies called \"Spanakopita\" are excellent. The grilled calamari salad is the best I've ever had. It's not too chewy and really well seasoned. All these little dishes are on the left side of the menu, and even when we go in a large group we order these instead of entrees and share. It's really a fun way to dine, especially with chilled Greek wine! I don't usually order any of the main dishes. First of all the portions are HUGE. You could easily split a plate with a friend. I've tried a number of items on the menu but I always go back to the appetizers because they're so good. Deserts are good too. The balklava is really tasty. Be sure to ask about the ice cream. Last night we had the cinnamon and it was perfect. Service is alway friendly and warm. We used to take my daughter here when she was a toddler because the waiters were always so nice with her.

We were overwhelmed and intimidated by the menu, but the maitre'd was so courteous and polite in assisting us with our choices. We started with the most delicious hummus and tzatziki sauce I've ever had, with warm, soft, fresh pita bread. The tzatziki sauce was fresh, crisp and light. We ordered two appetizers to split, the lamb meatballs and the prawns (unfortunately I do not remember the Greek names). The lamb meatballs were soft, moist, and complemented by a marinara sauce. The prawns were marinated in a rich, savory sauce with the creamiest feta cheese you've ever had. We finished our extravaganza with a dessert sampler. I'm not even sure what the dessert were because we couldn't pronounce anything (one part was baklava), but they were all the perfect portion of absolute heaven.

Simply put it is not worth it. I'm not against paying for expensive food when it is really, really great but you better believe I can't stand expensive food that is not amazing. The souvlaki here was charred and slightly flavorless. The souvlaki came with their lemon potato which is supposedly famous. I can't see why. The Greek salad was not that great either. The grilled octopus was charred as well. The only thing I enjoyed here was the spanakopita. It was pretty good but this is hardly the place you would come to just for a spanakopita since it's an expensive sit down restaurant. One of my Yelp friends gave this place 5 stars! Wow! Most of my friends were as unimpressed as I was.The service here is OK and the place looks really nice. I did see that the main waiter hugs some of the guests as they leave and he even teaches some people phrases in Greek.They have got outside seating.

Well prepared food and good service. If you can't provide both, your restaurant should be closed. The food was decent. Nothing spectacular. Fancied up lean cuisine. The service was just horrid!

Bountiful seafood: shrimp, calamari, fish. \u00a0It has so much seafood!\" The dish came out with fish and a shrimp. When I asked why it was so different, he admitted that they ran out and proceeded to school me that fish is seafood. Jerk. We also had asked for more pita three times before we got it.

(If anyone knows the recipe hand it over) .The pita is amazing, comes hot with a nice char. Another favorite are the lemony potatoes.

Either way, get there!I walked in to have a nice lunch alone before work and I was greeted warmly by a woman with long, flowy hair. She sat me near the window and I asked to see their wine list. I ended up opting for a Mythos (I love to try new beers) and was very happy with my choice. A man brought out warm, fluffy, almost pancake-like, pita bread with some olive oil for dipping. The pita alone was so good, I didn't feel the need to use the oil!My server recommended I try the Elliniko Piato Greek Plate which had a little bit of everything. It came with a Greek salad topped with mounds of feta cheese (mmmmm). ****It's true, the lemon roasted potatoes are freaking AMAZING!The tzatziki was also creamy and bomb!

Please do yourself a favor, when in Larchmont, and eat at Le Petite Greek!The one thing I will say, is that it is on the higher of the \"$$\" level. The entrees hover around 30 bucks each!

Still wondering about the restaurant name - are they trying to play off of \"Le P'tit Grecque\" in Quebec or \"Au P'tit Grec\" in France...or perhaps they confuse their own language with French. Anyway - I checked the menu for the first sign of a faux-Greek spot in LA...HUMUS. Yes...if you see Humus, it's usually a sign that the owners or chefs are Armenian/Persian/Turkish/Israeli but not...Greek! And guess what? Greek food tastes good in Greece because...Greeks who know their own culinary traditions make it. Now anyone can make amazing Greek food with the right know-how. But I still see a correlation between Greek people and Greek food. And the Armenians and Persians in LA ain't changing that perception anytime soon.So - I missed the Humus. It was on there. But I missed it. And sat down. We ordered a test dish of Tzaziki. I figured if they f-d up their national appetizer - well then they weren't worth the Ilyad they were printed on...(by the way - host claims owner/chefs are greek...if this is true...for shame...)Anyway - it was watery, flavorless - much like the Trader Joes tzaziki...but not quite as good (or maybe it was from Trader Joes and it's just been out for a while.). We ordered some olive oil and lemons to try and \"enhance\" the flavor/texture...something...but luckily were eyed by the host and one of the waiters who snickered, and made some all-too-obvious condescending comments about what I was doing. I should have just sent it back. House wine was bitter...much like the experience. We stayed long enough to check out other people's dishes which all looked like some sort of odd Southwest version of Mediterranean food with Greek names. Another let-down on a pretentious, showy little b-I-t-c-h of a street with patrons that match...all of which reminds me of Crescent/De La Montagne or Green Avenue in Montreal without any of the class, food or amazing spots to dine/drink in. Like a Little Beverly Hills with lots of east coast people that must have burned their tastebuds off in the LA sun."], ["Richard K.", "Le Petit Greek, just the name in itself is bizarre. Is it French or is it Greek? That's like calling a Chinese Restaurant Peque\u00f1o Chinos. Moreover, contrary to their name, their prices are definitely not petit... after all, they probably have to pay a high rent to stay in the Larchmont area or else they will end up out of business like the former KooKooRoo (soon to be Chipotle) down the street. No wonder the ma\u00eetre d' kept trying to upsell everything! For lunch prices expect $14+ even for a gyro and for dinner expect $20+. Our office ended up eating here for a birthday lunch and so we ordered individual entrees, shared appetizers, and lots of drinks. For the appetizers we had plates of methezes (Greek for tapas-style appetizers) that included beets, hummus, tzatziki, and taramosalata (caviar spread). We also ordered two plates of calamari because out of all the appetizers, the grilled calamari ($12) with lemon and herbs tasted the best... too bad the portion was small...errr petit. For the entr\u00e9e I ended up ordering the solomos psitos, which is organic salmon grilled with olive oil and lemons served with lemon potatoes and a feta salad. This dish was the most expensive lunch dish at $18, yet it was very unimpressive. Aside from being overpriced and overcooked the dish looked like something I could make at home in 25 minutes with ingredients from Trader Joe's. I also got to try my coworker's turkey meatball dish which was a daily special. It tasted alright but even after two bottles of Chimay Blue, I knew it was dry and bland and did not have me saying \"opa\", which is a Greek expression for \"yee-haw\" or \"whoo-hoo\".With so many Greek restaurants in Los Angeles, Le Petit Greek is not a place that I would want to return to, especially on my own dime. Then again, it wasn't my birthday and the boss picked up the check. Opa? Sorry, this place isn't Gangnam-style enough for this \"oppa\".

Their Sokolata Parthenon dessert is a crossbreed between a souffle and filo dough pastry. The chef makes it especially for this restaurant and you won't find it anywhere else.

I often order the Pastitsio if they have it made that day, since it's not on the menu they don't make it all the time. It's the best Pastitsio I've had here in the US. Definitely one of the best Greek restaurants in LA!"], ["Cis S.", "This place gets packed for brunch but totally worth it. We doubled up on certain menu items because they were delicious. Just wished they would turn in the AC on-time instead of waiting for it to get warm in there b/c it does."], ["E L.", "busy wednesday night!we ate--halloumi cheese, lentil soup, greek salad. the cheeses were phenomenal, and the service was so on point. the second we were done with any plate, a server was there to clear it. (this was so helpful since we sat outside along with everyone else in creation).a great time!"]]}
