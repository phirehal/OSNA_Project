The Pizza Lisa is another one of my favorites. Their lunch Steak sandwich and fries is so SO YUMMY. Oh... And their SOUPS...

I also had half orders of pasta- love you can get half size so you can try more things!!! Pesto pasta is perfect flavor! I would add chicken.

He hardly ever finishes his meal, but again, he goes to town on this, so do I and I've witnessed him ordering a second \"to go order\" (which is completely out of character for him). Very often, we will split the Chicken Parmigiana. I thought I made a pretty darn good version of this dish. After eating here, I will not even attempt.

A roman variety with potatoes (no tomato sauce) is again one I saw on the streets of Italy in many a pizza place. \u00a0One is next on our list to try for sure.Wine list is short but prices are very good. \u00a0Noticed lots of folks bringing their own wine so maybe they dont charge a corkage fee.My only gripe? \u00a0They have a t.v. in the dining room. \u00a0I \u00a0know, lots of places do this now, even in Italy. \u00a0There they always watch soccer. \u00a0Here, football or whatever sport is on. \u00a0 I'm just wanting great food, company and some cool music.

Yes, the place is still in its infancy (just a bit over 3 months old) but that being said the food is worth it! Breakdown of the meal:Fresh bread is brought to the table: Olive and plain. Chewy and light, a nice start.Fresh burrata w tomato and basil: made in-house, perfectly creamy and slightly sticky, just dense enough for good mouth feel. There was the slightest sprinkling of finishing salt and a welcome addition of freshly cracked pepper that made what could have been a bland beginning into a tasty treat. The balance of cheese to tomato was slightly off, in my opinion, and I would have liked a few more wedges to complete my bites, however, smearing the fresh bread with the fresh cheese was also quite enjoyable.Osso bucco: PHENOMENAL! In a word. Knife not included as the flavorful meat was more than fork tender. The carrot and celery ragu brought a juicy, deep depth of flavor to the meat and soft polenta...and adding the unctuous bone marrow took it over the top. This is truly comfort food at its best! Spaghetti and meatballs: Delish! Freshly made spaghetti (all pasta is made fresh, daily) along with a perfectly simple red sauce and two tender meatballs. The pasta has just the right amount of chew and was such a surprising treat given that most places that make fresh pasta do not tend to take the time to make regular spaghetti.Semolina waffle w a pear and pink peppercorn compote: waffle is light (could be crisper) and the compote sweet and surprising when you bite into the peppercorn. Definitely perfect for those who don't like too sweet desserts.Tiramisu: Yummy! Individually portioned in cute little ramekins. Lovely coffee flavor as you scoop down to the bottom and dig into the espresso-soaked cake.Coffee: made to order and strong.Water and iced tea served in adorable decanters.The staff is friendly and attentive. Likewise, Chef/owner Steve is personable, full of energy, and passionate about his food and new family business. While certain aspects of service need a bit of tweaking, overall, this place should be five stars in a few months.

I've been here for brunch and dinner, and enjoyed both.BYOB-Dinner: Osso buco, seafood linguine, spinach gnocchi, and charcuterie. ALL delicious. The gnocchi, especially, was excellent. Delicate, buttery and oh-so flavorful. Really, really liked the sage. I thought the osso buco was good, too. Incredibly tender beef shank and silky smooth polenta swimming in a pond of juicy......osso buco juice. Also, that portion of bone marrow! Mmm, so fatty and delicious. Loved the charcuterie! All of the meats were very decent in quality, and definitely looking to re-order that.-Brunch: Semolina waffle with berries and maple syrup with a side of sausage links. Waffles are waffles, but that's not to say it wasn't tasty. The blueberries were super fresh and ripe :). And sooo glad I added the cinnamon roll as an afterthought. Thin and flakey outside while soft, warm and gooey inside. And yes, they bake their own pastries. I must try the orange rosemary cake next time.Overall, nothing super spectacular to go out of your way for, but like I said, a really pleasant addition to Larchmont Village.

The tuna was dry, the beans were undercooked, and it basically had no flavor. My son had spaghetti with meatballs and the flavor was actually decent but the meatballs were almost cold. And for dessert we had panna cotta which one of my all time fave. I even like panna cotta even if it's not that great. Well this was not great. It was not rich and lacked flavor but as I said I like even mediocre panna cotta so I ate it. \u00a0The biggest problem I had was with the service. They clearly saw I wasn't eating my salad. I had decided at that point I was going to take it home and try to fix it cause I hate to waste food but they tried to ignore it. The man I assume was the manager asked every other table how was the food but conveniently skipped mine. And when the waiter came he saw that my son had finished his pasta so asked him how his food was and didn't bother asking me how mine was... This is my first review and I eat out a lot but the way that this restaurant handled the service made me want to write my first review. It's too bad it had to be a negative one.

My girlfriend and I have been wanting to try this place since it opened last month, and it didn't disappoint. The decor is beautiful. As for the noise, it is not as bad as other reviewers make it seem. The staff is very friendly, attentive, and accommodating. There wasn't an open table on the weeknight we went, so it's best to call ahead for a reservation. We were seated in less than 30 seconds. Remember to bring your own wine, the restaurant is going through their permitting process so there's no corkage fee yet. \u00a0First things first, the bread. They have the most delicious black olive bread I have ever tasted, so good that I ordered seconds! \u00a0The portion sizes were just right. For starters we shared their mushroom soup and burrata. The burrata was love at first bite and paired well with heirloom tomatoes. Our main plates were the pork chop and osso bucco, both which were so tender. The pork chop was paired with caramelized apples which \u00a0added a level of sweetness that really brought out the taste. The osso bucco was served on a bed of creamy polenta. \u00a0For dessert we had the panna cotta which was not too rich but very smooth and topped with with fresh strawberries.

Spend your hard earned money elsewhere.

Italians actually don't eat breakfast: they only have a cup of espresso and maybe a cornetto (croissant type pastry).Service is horrible: why are we getting a second bottle of water when the first one isn't even halfway done yet?!

We will probably be back in the future; I know that this restaurant is newer, so we will probably circle back in a year and see if they have found their rhythm."], ["Matt L.", "Authentic B.Y.O.B. Italian restaurant in the heart of Larchmont Village. \u00a0 Service was attentive and the food first rate. \u00a0Two dishes that stood out were the baked ricotta and then the buratta."], ["Robert M.", "Perfect local Italian escape. Warm and friendly environment but omg the food. From the first bite of the fresh crusty olive bread, to the last bite of my pasta dish...it was perfect. Oh and the sage polenta! I have to find a way to save room for dessert next time. BTW they don't have wine or liquor yet."], ["Adam C.", "i'll be honest, my expectations were low. I don't associate Larchmont blvd with high-end cuisine. It's usually \"fine\" and hits the spot. And it feels like more lunch type food. But Vernetti is a game changer. The place is a cool hip look but... can be a little loud. Not at all bad with sound. It was the right vibe. And the FOOD! i had the bone marrow. It's my first... delicious. I used to be scared to try it but now i'm a convert. For a main my wife ordered the cacio e pepe. I thought i'd have food envy. It's a pasta with with cracked pepper and cheese. fugetaboutit! I ate like a third of her plate. I got the branzino. I was expecting, as i usually get, a more \"flat\" flavor. This one was really moist. The subtle butter and lemon kept it simple and combined with a fresh fish the dish KILLED IT. Problem... where the wine at!? People... i need me some wine. I hear they are working on their liquor thing so i came prepared. What's great about this place is that you can hang out on Larchmont after dinner. Many restaurants are tucked into locations that are destinations. With Larchmont you can walk around and hang out. Reminds me more of Europe."], ["Jayk J.", "This place is the best place for lunch and dinner both I swear!!! If you never been here, you are guilty already. Check this place out today!! Action!!!"], ["Emily K.", "Fantastico! Great bread, delicious pasta. Must try the buratta and heirloom tomatoes. To top it off the service was friendly and knowledgeable. Overall a wonderful experience and a welcome addition to the neighborhood."], ["David M.", "Lets start with something good. The ambiance and feel is nice and simple. I can appreciate this as it is a clean welcoming environment that lets you focus on your meal and not the razzle dazzle of a venue. Unfortunately, when the meal is ill prepared then you may tend to focus on it a bit more. Live by the sword, die by the sword.... (feel free to scroll to the end for the brass tax of this review). Our overall service and experience was lacking. Lets do a play-by-play on the evening, shall we? We shall. To get an idea of our table, we were two couples eating family style...and go:Apps:Beet Cristoni's - Simple, but good. Good quality beets. Fresh and with a nice earthy finish. Burrata - Fresh, tasty and lite. I'd recommend it. Bone Marrow - Well it is what it is. Ours came out under cooked. The top layer cooked right, then you scoop right into blood pudding. I eat red meat medium rare and steak tartar when in a nice place, but something about under cooked bloody marrow is a huge turn off for me. It came back out in less than 2 minutes. I told the waiter that it was literally impossible to have been cooked that fast. Sure enough...still raw. Sent back again. Finally came back the third time cooked. Entrees: Rigatoni Spuntature - I portioned out the pasta on some share plates only for us to all realize the dish came out cold. Pasta cold, short rib cold, cherry tomatoes room temp. So I sent this back. Came back to me with the same size portion it was sent back and the waiter says \"well you already ate the difference of the meal\". I explained when we portion to share and we don't actually eat the meal because we need to send it back that he should just have the dish remade. Why should I be expected to pay for a meal but only be allowed to enjoy 1/3 of it? We received a lot of static from our server as he defended his kitchen. He also informed us that they served over 100 tables that evening yet we were the only one that complained. Either he was insinuating that we were at fault for complaining or that his kitchen was tired and ready to go home after a long evening of cooking. Either or it was an unnecessary comment. Roast Chicken - Came out pink. Under cooked again. Salmon - Came out beautiful, until you cut into it. Under cooked again. *Both were sent back. The Fish came back still under cooked. **SIDES: The Polenta cake came out perfect! Good texture, crisp edged, and hot temp! At this point I said to the waiter that we would like to leave. Simply walk out. The kitchen manager came to talk to us in a kind and calm manner. He apologized and asked if he could do anything to make the situation better. All I asked is that he understand where we were coming from. We came to enjoy a nice meal yet there were a dozen of unacceptable service and meal prep issues. As I go on to take my time to explain it to him I hear from the back of the room,\"Incorrect, you are incorrect!!\". I turn around and its the chef and based on his arm-crossed stature, obvious over entitlement and ego he likely may be the owner as well. I welcomed him to eat ill-prepared food all he wants, but as patrons that we won't take the risk of getting sick for the sake of his ego.The chef came out, not to talk to us or reason with us but to badger his customers and criticize our complaints. \u00a0Really? \u00a0We got into a small verbal back and forth where I reminded him of what it means to be a restaurateur and to take pride in what he does, but unfortunately his pride sits with his ego and not with his passion for food prep and customer service. Genuinely, if the food prep and management of the situation was better, I would expect this to be great go-to restaurant in Larchmont, but I can only express what I have experienced. In a last attempt to not further ruin my evening I excused myself & group from the restaurant and as we made our way out we were gifted by hearing the pompous chef yell,\" people like you are never happy and are not needed here\". Thanks for dismissing me after I already volunteered myself to leave your restaurant. Class act you are, sir. A true embarrassment to the culinary world, culture, and scene. If you want to be mistreated and badgered by a pompous chef in hopes of ruining your evening, then I highly suggest dining here. I caution you to dine at your own risk and I hope that your experience isn't as terrible or as embarrassing as mine was. Even as I write this, I hesitate to post my review. My parents have owned restaurants, been head chefs, and because of this the culinary culture strongly resonates with me. I am not posting this out of ill-will or in hopes of the restaurant doing bad, but my experience was so offensive and embarrassing that it has to be shared."], ["teddy z.", "Finally, we have a pretty solid culinary addition to Larchmont Village.

Everything we ordered was delicious from the prosciutto and melon, the Polenta cakes starters and the excellent moist half a chicken with creamy mushroom polenta. I ordered the spicy Italian sausage pasta with sweet peppers and Gluten free pasta (an excellent choice) and every ingredient was fresh and wonderful!

I will definitely be back!"], ["Cris D.", "Miserable experience all around. Service was extremely slow, one of our dinner meals was never ordered and the woman sitting next to us had her dog - not a small lap dog, a larger Shepard mix - that was eating off the floor, her table and regurgitating the food and rolling in it. Yes, this woman was completely obstinate about it and simply inconsiderate, but it's really up to an employee to say something. Now I could forgive and overlook some of this if the food was good. It was not. Smallish portions are fine, but bland, unimaginative food is not acceptable. Sorry, if you think this food is good, you're a tourist and you do not know Italian cooking."], ["Kim C.", "Vernetti is a welcome new addition to Larchmont. \u00a0It's exciting to have a stylish, date night worthy restaurant right in the Village. \u00a0The decor is so lovely, you automatically have a little glow. \u00a0We started with the burrata, which you really can't go wrong with. \u00a0The others partook of the charcuterie, but being a non land lover, I passed. \u00a0I did insist on the octopus, because it's tough to cook (and sometimes literally to eat), but over the doubts of my tablemates, it was a hit. \u00a0Tender and the right kind of chewy with a good char. \u00a0I passed on the meaty rigatoni that the others dove into, because I was focused on the branzino. \u00a0The fish was amazing, tender and gently cooked. \u00a0I know it's hard to bypass the pasta for the secondi at an Italian place, but this is one dish not to be missed. \u00a0Fun to share as well.My hubby loves cannoli, which he was happy to get the last one. \u00a0I hoarded the tiramisu, so we had to get two. \u00a0We BYOB, and with Larchmont Wine and Cheese just steps away, we were happy to support another local business on Larchmont!"], ["Ben P.", "My first Yelp review!As someone who lives in the neighborhood, my fianc\u00e9e and I had been looking forward to the opening of Vernetti for the past few months while it's been under construction. Last night we checked it out with my future in-laws and had a somewhat disappointing first experience.While the restaurant is beautiful (if not a bit noisy), it seems like the team in place needs a few more weeks to iron out the kinks and settle in. As my future father-in-law is a vegetarian, we asked if the soups were vegetarian. Our waiter said that they both were, but after we specifically asked about the broths, he realized that one of the soups had a meat-based broth. There was an extraordinarily long wait between our salad and main courses. After we had been waiting for a while a waiter came to our table to inform us that our roast chicken took a long time to prepare, but that it would be ready in two minutes. It took several more minutes before our dinner was finally served. We had to ask several employees several times before our water was refilled. Our salads were good. While the pastas were flavorful, the portions were on the small side. We had the whole roast branzino, which was delicious, but served without any accompaniments. The roast chicken was delicious and well-cooked, but the accompanying polenta was lumpy.Overall, I'm excited about the potential of a great new neighborhood spot, but will wait a few months to try it again with the hopes that the place will improve as the staff gains experience."], ["k m.", "Amazing experience, amazing service. \u00a0Was very sad when Girasole closed but so happy Vernetti opened. \u00a0It is killer."], ["Dorothy A.", "Great & friendly service!

Unfortunately Vernetti seems not to be an exception for this new trend of restaurants around LA which care more about the looks than the food, and that's very sad.The menu seems right nothing fancy there, not too big just proper but nothing to die for. The service was ok, our waitress wasn't familiar with mostly any of the Italian dishes listed in the menu, but in this case I will blame my accent, just not to go so hard on her. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, the portion was on the small side, \u00a0the meatballs, were heavy on the salt and lacking the taste of wonderfull italian herbs to compliment the beef and achieve the flavor profile authentic Italian meatballs are all about, same thing with the tomato sauce, but the spaghetti was perfect and I wish there was more! My husband ordered the octopus, the side dish was so salty he could not continue eating, to top it all the octopus was chewy and flavorless, not sauce to bring out the flavor of this beautiful ocean creature which was screaming for some love. They were very nice to cook a brand new order of the same but unfortunately, the flavor didn't improve the second time around. At this point we were really looking to reconcile with the place, cause seriously we really wanted to like it, but the panna cotta also fell short compared to Italian standards OVER ALL not a familiar flavor to recall any of my Italian roots. The bread was fantastic and they take the octopus out of our bill, so not complains at all about that. THANK YOU! \u00a0I know this review is on the down side and I apologize but with the very well versed chef you have in your kitchen and with the great location you acquire on Larchmont, you have everything on your side to be a winner.

The Modena, a butter lettuce dish, was delicious and the pairings of the candied walnuts with the goat cheese and balsamic vinaigrette really brought out the flavos in each. The caprese had an overwhelming portion of tomato to mozzarella, which I personally enjoyed, and the fried zuchinni are also delicious especially with the green aioli sauce. For mains, ordered three pizzas, the margherita, the sausage, and the burrata. Personally, the pizzas didn't really stand out to me but I \u00a0am more of a flatbread person than full on pizza so I appreciated the thinness of the slices as well as how fresh the marinara sauce was on the pizzas.

The chocolate souffl\u00e9 was a winner, as it was moist and not too sweet, dark chocolate cake on the outside, and a light (this was very sweet on its own) creamy syrup drizzled in.The service for food was very good as well, with the servers all being well-dressed, well-mannered, and good looking. The food itself was up in the air:Ceviche: Very small portion for $14. I didn't even fit in my hand...and honestly, taste was good, but I've had just as good at mom n' pop ceviche joints for much less.Frutte di mare: A wonderful chilled soup made with very fresh ingredients, though the liquid could've been spiced up a tad more. Once again, not worth the $12 for a few mouthfuls of peppers and shrimp.Lamb chop: My poor cousin came from Texas to try the restaurant, only to find her lamb chops burnt and dry :( She ate it anyway because she felt bad sending it back, even though we asked her to.Pasta (starts with a T...): Totally forgot the name, but it was pan saut\u00e9ed, making the penne pasta crispy, which was interesting. Taste was pretty decent, and the meat was soft enough to eat. Probably one of our better entrees.Overall, the desserts are what you want to come here for when you have money to spend. Forget the food and dine elsewhere."], ["Javier J.", "Because of the review traffic this is the review that's going to get passed on like Tom Brady in the draft but here it goes...Parking: 7$ all day lot across the street is a bargain for DTLA. +The exterior of the building matches the inside decor which not so many places always do +Even though the bakery/cafe area is connected to the restaurant, they do a good job at making it a distinguishable separation +Drinks: \u00a0Bellini- Wasn't my order but the tasting of it was nice. Well mixed with a smooth aftertaste. 4/5\"Green\" Juice- Happy with it. It's all veggies aside from the green apple but the apple diffused the all veggie taste perfectly and gave it a playful tartery fruit twist to it, making it enjoyable 4/5Food:Lobster hash- Everything above average except for the potatoes, season them maybe? Considering it's the base of the plate (literally), it did affect it. They weren't bad but didn't live up with the price of the plate. Eggs and lobster, sauce and all were great though. 3.5/5Waffles- Made the mistake of having these brought to me with my main dish, they would of been to die for if I would of had them warm. The batter used turned these into delicious waffles, the whipped cream was quality, syrup topped it nicely. Recommended by our waitress, good pick over the french toast or beignets. 4/5American Breakfast: No judgement, who comes here to order this?Desserts: Tiramisu- Very rich and sweet. It was good but not worth the price tag. 3/5La Vanille- White chocolate and vanilla bean dessert. Overly sweet. 2/5Macaroons- Delightful. 4/5As for the desserts, aside from the macaroons, there are way better ones out there in LA, for the 12$ price tag for each, you can probably get 2 better pastry desserts elsewhere for a mediocre one here.

Hallelujah! When it's so hot outside, that outright is welcoming. Then, you realize you're at a restaurant that specializes in pastries, so you probably won't be going hungry again any time soon. I believe it was around 96 degrees Fahrenheit that day in downtown, so to be chilled felt fantastic.Onto our order! I had the following:-Duck Prosciutto Crostini (shared)-Clam Linguine -Green Tea Arnold Palmer-Beignets with Raspberry CompoteMy absolute unhealthy favorite (which only makes sense when you walk in and see them displayed) were the Beignets -- any dessert pastries could have been great. Texture was soft and spot on. Plenty of sugar, but it's dessert... I got to taste a few of their macarons from my other half as well, also delish.I did enjoy the Duck Prosciutto more than I expected to. I'm already a fan of \"more typical\" prosciutto, and this version seemed to work pretty well. The Clam Linguine was good and fully devoured, although I think the clams were a tad chewy. Did like the freshly ground pepper.Friendly service.

Ciao!"], ["Jason L.", "I'm a big fan of Bottega, not only for the macarons, but for the delicious food. Everything about this place screams class, from the ambiance to the decor to the bright gift boxes. There is a mini cafe seating area in front of the bar where you can grab a drink while you wait for your table in the main restaurant area. The menu is the same for both places so if you're in a rush and don't feel like waiting, you could definitely sit in the small dining area. The lighting is dim and definitely sets the mood for a nice evening dinner.While we waited for the rest of our party to arrive, it was nice to be able to sit at the bar and order the same items from the menu inside. We got an order of the mac-n-cheese bacon to start and it was fantastic! One takeaway from this dish: the macaroni noodles weren't soggy, like you typically find which makes for a great taste! Yet at the same time, it was nice and creamy and you can definitely taste the bacon infused inside the dish. Pretty good if you ask me! We ordered a tartufo pizza for the table. I'm a huge fan of eggs and if you love eggs, you'll love this pizza. The best way to describe this pizza is a nice overeasy egg with truffle on top of a pizza. Delicious!!!!! Makes my mouth water just thinking about it.... For my entree, I got the trenne, which is unique in that the trenne pasta is pan sauteed which makes for a nice crunch. There are nice portions of the braised prime rib eye which is tender and packed with flavor. I'm personally not entirely big on the pan sauteed trenne so I'd be cautious about ordering that if you don't love crunchy, hard pasta.My complaints about this place are the noise and lack of reservations. The way the restaurant is set up with high ceilings and all, noise echoes throughout the place. It's tough to hear your counterpart across the table so you kind of have to speak louder than normal. Also, this place gets so crowded that they should take reservations!! During peak hours, you can be waiting a while. Luckily, they have the cafe type seating outside so you can relax and grab a drink/pastry before you get your table. Service was impeccable. Our server was friendly and got us everything we asked for immediately. Just a little tip...if you are wearing black slacks and don't want the white lint from the napkins all over your pants, you can ask for black napkins!!"], ["Lydia N.", "Kinda ridiculous and over the top glamorous.. but I guess this is LA. Loved the Earl Grey macarons the most! It was tasty but mostly intriguing with its pretty flecks of gold."], ["Alex L.", "Ahhhhh, Bottega Louie. I mean what's not to love about a French-Italian tapas inspired restaurant? This place is my go-to in DTLA when I'm with a group of friends or family, and here's why:For starters, it's fancy yet casual. You'll see patrons dressed to the nine, as well as Kings fans in cargo shorts and hockey jerseys sitting steps away from one another. The interesting atmosphere is created by the cafeteria-like setup that's decorated as elegantly as any five star establishment. The high ceilings create a loud atmosphere, which is great for pre-game drinks with friends. But the low lighting and classy ambiance creates a relaxed enough setting that I also feel comfortable bringing my family along for a nice dinner.Speaking of dinner, the food here is outstanding. As I mentioned before, this place is great for sharing. Treat your table to a delicious pizza, portobello fries, or (my favorite) asparagus with poached egg. You really can't go wrong with the small plates. The entrees are great too. I recently enjoyed the Tenne Pasta, which is crunchy noodles over prime rib and a delicious light pasta sauce. Outstanding.Next up, the service. Everyone here is a professional. They're courteous, well dressed, and quick to help you. The restaurant is also very well staffed, which is always helpful. The wait can sometimes be a little long to get a table, but the bar is always equipped with lightning fast bartenders who are ready to keep you occupied until your table is ready. After dinner, don't forget to grab their signature lava cake (which you should order before dinner, as it takes twenty minutes to prepare!), and grab a bag of their famous macarons on your way out the door. This unique dining experience will have you coming back again and again."], ["Michelle L.", "Finally got to try the most reviewed spot in Yelp History! Whoa!Seating/Service: 3 StarsOur party of 13 came to celebrate a birthday, wait was around an hour on a Sunday evening, which isn't too bad.We were initially seated at a round table, and the hostess must have been high or something because looking over at the other round table, there was a party of 6-7 seated comfortably. How in F's sake do they expect us to squish 13 people in that round table? Good thing someone in our party took charge and noticed there were 2 tables along side the booths that would be good for us, so we moved.Service was great, our waiter was very nice, and welcoming. Please note, this place gets LOUD, due to the very high ceilings, and of course, the crowd, you pretty much have to yell at each other.Food/Drinks: 4 StarsI loved their drinks! Black and blue (blackberry mojito) was my weapon of choice for the night, and it did not disappoint. It was both tasty and strong.My friend had the Green Tea mojito which was really tasty, too, it comes virgin, so I would probably ask the waiter to throw in some fun juice, because personally for me, that would just be a total waste of calories.Had a sip of my friend's bloody mary, and that thing is so delicious. I felt like I was drinking a shrimp cocktail. It was super flavorful, and spicy. It definitely had a nice kick to it.We shared a chicken, avocado, and lemon salad, that was soooooo sad. You could easily whip something like that up at home, and it was just too sour and tasted whatever. Would not recommend.Everything else after that, was superb though.Their pork chops were the star of the night, because it was so juicy and tender, all while being perfectly charred and flavorful. If you are a pork lover, you will LOVE this dish. The short ribs were very rich and decadent. It was served over some mashed potatoes. This dish was definitely hearty and should be shared. It was very flavorful and tender as well.Lasagna was really good, although I could have used some chili pepper flakes, but it's a winner too.The Portobello fries thoughhhhhhhh, mmmmmmmm. I love mushrooms, I love fried stuff. I love fried mushrooms! It's a happy marriage, and a party in my mouth. Get it. You won't regret it.Beignets tasted how they should, super fluffy and steamy hot, dunked in some raspberry sauce or nutella.

The pizza was looking nice, especially the four cheese one, will try next time.I saw them making really fancy cocktails so I guess you can try these with the sweets :)But its too noisy indeed, inside there is even kind of an echo, it was very disturbing, definitely not a place to relax over tea and sweets."], ["Silvia G.", "More than just macaroons!During my first time here, the wait for the dining room was so long that we just grabbed one of the small tables on the bakery side and shared some appetizers and desserts. I was not impressed.Recently I came back with some out of towners and had a very enjoyable dinner! We shared:*Pizza with half burrata, half artichoke. \u00a0It was good but the thin crust tasted a bit burnt.*Truffle mash was good but didnt taste the truffle*Lobster soup was nice and light, more of a broth*Portabella fries: people rave about them but I personally prefer them sauteed and soft and not crunchy and wrapped in batter*Grilled octopus: also tasted a bit burnt and portion was super small with roe*My entree was the star of the night, Ceppo Gamber: Pasta with shrimp, it was super garlicky with a light olive oil sauce and broccolini. The pasta were little rolls, like scrolls, and very delicious*Hubby got the Trenne: Rib eye pasta with kale and wasnt crazy about it. It was on the heavier side with red sauce. The Trenne pasta is fried on one side which makes it crunchy and a bit hard*Le grand macaron is a nice looking big macaroon with berries but flavor was just ok.

Finally I got to visit the infamous bottega louie. After perusing the bakery case, I decided to get a box of 13 macarons, blood orange panna cotta, pistachio \u00e9clair, and a mixed berry mini tart.The presentation at this location is very high scale, classy, and \"cute.\" Every pastry I received, it was placed in it's own cute square box (you're basically paying for the packaging).The macarons here were okay - the flavors weren't distinct as their individual sign was more tasty than the actually macron. You pay and then get a piece of paper to tally which macaron you want. The girl ended up giving me the wrong ones which is frustrating cause how can you mistake a tally next to the name?! Argh!! Pricey suckers, I'd stay away from these.Blood Orange Panna Cotta- was pretty good, slight hint of blood orange, the fruit/mint on top elevated the flavors. Good creamy consistency and feel in the mouth. This was my favorite goody out from my purchase.Mixed Berry Mini Tart- You can eat this in 2-3 bites. Side note - it isn't filled with custard, but rather it is a vanilla bean cream. So that was a bit disappointing. Had I want a fruit and cream, I would have gotten their cream puff.Pistachio \u00c9clair- Unfortunately, they ended up packaging the wrong pastry and gave me a raspberry pistachio tart! Cool that I paid less, but if I wanted a raspberry pistachio tart, I would of ordered one. The tart had a raspberry filling that oozes out, which made for a pretty presentation, but I'm not a huge fan of raspberry filling and the pistachio/raspberry combination was weird for me.I'd check your goodies before you take off, because they seriously messed up 2 out of 4 for me and there's nothing more frustrating than to drive 45 minutes back home and noticing that they gave you the wrong things!"], ["Albert H.", "Bottega Louie has now over 11,000 yelp reviews. I suppose this is another one for a drop in the bucket. I came to Bottega for lunch on a Friday, and sat on the cafe tables instead of inside, but the wait was pretty short. First walking in, you notice the bakery and the very high ceilings and the pillars on the side. The interior of Bottega reminds me of something a high end place in Paris or New York City. FOOD: I got the Ceppo Gamber (jumbo shrimp with cherry tomatoes with ceppo pasta), which I thought for $20, the portion size did not equate equally. It was not bad at all, but was somewhat expecting a larger portion size. Onto dessert though and this aspect of Bottega justififes its four star rating for me. I got a pistachio macaron ($2.50), although priceier, the quality is very good. I found the cookie to be the right give and tasted very much like pistachio. I see people buying it by the boxes here, and there's a reason why! \u00a0At the end of the day, I find Bottega Louie to be a nice date place and really, their pastries are where it is at. Next time I'm in DTLA, I will pass on the meals and skip straight to dessert.Note: There is a parking garage around the corner of Bottega Louie. It is pretty full, at least on a Friday afternoon, but there is parking there and flat rate is $10."], ["Mel L.", "Super cute place and plenty of space. Amazing selection of really nice macarons!

After noticing the 11k+ reviews, I figured that this place must have gotten something right. We came here at 8PM on a Thursday night, and it was still bustling. It is a pretty loud and exciting place to eat at, so if you want a more intimate, quiet, Lady in the Tramp type setting, this may not be the optimal place for you.Our server was good and did everything like he was supposed to. My boyfriend had the chicken parmesan. It was good, but it wasn't worth 4 Yelp stars. I ordered the scallops dish, and they were alarmingly salty. Usually I don't like to bother my waiter with subpar food and just stomach my meal, but I couldn't take a bite and wash it down with a gallon of water and not pucker my cheeks. My boyfriend tried it as well, and he refuesed to let me get hypertension secondary to the extreme salt intake. We spoke with our server and asked if we could just remove the dish from our bill, which he gladly did.We ended the night with their chocolate souffle, which was to die for. I hadn't had such good souffle since going to a fancy French restaurant in Toronto. Oh boy was it worth the $16 price tag and 20 minute wait (it is made to order).The pastries/desserts are chic and impressive in display and in taste. It reminds me of an LA version of Laduree.

I had to rave about DTLA's Italian restaurant reputable for its foods and pastries. Bottega Louie embodies an ideas than the sophistication and lure of days past are not intangible. Louie is well thoughtout with 3 kitchens which consist of one main kitchen, one with an in wall Woodfield burning pizza oven, and the another where bread, sweets and macarons are made. Every inches of the restaurant and gourmet market emits class and thoughtfulness. \u00a0I ventured out to Bottega Louie located at 7th/Metro Center Red, Purple, Expo and Blue Line Station three months ago cause everybody keeps mentioning this place all the time...There is an elegance and attention to every detail in this restaurant that I adore from marble flooring and delicate ceiling \u00a0designs to beautiful pink salt crystals in the shakers on the tables. If you are going to come here for dinner you SHOULD know that they DO NOT take reservations. Basically, it's strictly first come and first served. As others said, it's always extremely busy during dinner time, so I would suggest getting there at least half an hr before you plan to eat. The menus at Bottega Louie is quite extensive and features mostly Italian fare with few French dished combined with in. It offers options including $10 (Salads), $12-15 (Pastas), $20 (Entries). The food itself was a worthy of a repeat visit, although the margheritta pizza to start was a bit uninspired, I've had better on many occasions, and the portobello mushroom fritters were edible but was not fully packed up with full of flavors as we had expected. The mains, however were oustanding. Chicken with artichoke came to grilled perfection, the artichoke melting in one's mouth and the gamberi pasta featured a host of giant shrimp. (4/5)The sausage and bean stew was equally generous in portion sizes and was packed full of taste with good quality meat and NOT the track of gristle or herb stalks (take that Bocca Di Beppo). (4/5)For the Clam Casino aka clams with parsley, breading, bell petter and salt. This dish was truly tastefully done because clams were moist and juicy, slid with the shell with total perfection. The surprising thrill of bacon infused into the topping makes this place a hit. As breading can be bit on heavy side, blend of ingredients are quite interesting enough to keep your attention without overpowering it's intention.(5/5)For the roasted beet terrine which is roasted beet, buffalo mozzarella, watercress, chive, tomato, radiccio, light vinaigrette with salt and pepper, such a bright salad. Beets were prepared to perfection and each notes reveled in the culmination of flavors happening on the plate. From visual presentation of color to wonderfully lighted dressing, welcomed success. (5/5)Brussels Sprouts with Pistachio, As Brussels Sprouts are not the majority of the people's favorite vegetables, they are nature's unsung Victor ONLY if it's prepared correctly. This place has found a rather understated approach that feeds the need for a baby Brussels Sprouts by adding very simple element called Pistachio.(4/5)The real star was the dessert which is Chocolate Souffle which needs to be ordered at the beginning of the meal because it requires beating the eggs white for 20 minutes until it becomes firm peaks form. \u00a0Perfectly risen and perforated by the waiter by vanila custard sauce, it truly made the evening complete. (5/5)My only few complaints are that the restaurant is very open so it is a louder establishment and plus the portion sizes of some dishes didn't really satisfy my hunger. So far, I had pleasant experience dining there with my buddies and hope your dining experience is great as well. Great downtown eatery by the way!!"], ["Maya W.", "Yes this place is loud, and probably crowded all the time (except when kitchen opens on Sundays).But every time I've been here I had a great experience, whether it was drinking at the bar, getting a pastry, sitting down for coffee or getting a meal.

I made 530p reservations and luckily we were led to a table promptly. The tables are close together and your neighbors are super close to you. Kinda awkward if you're going on a date. There are lots of groups that come here. I think what brings people here is that you can BYOB and BYOD (booze and dessert). NO CHARGE! We noticed people bringing in their own bottles and people seated go out and buy bottles from neighboring stores and bring them back! WHAT?! That's awesome!!!We were provided waters, comp bread and hummus. OMG, the hummus is delicious! The warm bread was yum too.We orders came from the specials of the day menu. We split the Insalata Cavolo ($10) which is baby kale, baby arugula, avocado, red onions with park dressing; Tagliolini mare monte ($19) which is homemade pasta with mushrooms and tiger shrimp and tomato sauce; and Chicken Risotto.The salad was amazing. I didn't think I would like it honestly. Simple yet tasty! I really liked the risotto better than my pasta. The risotto was flavorful and buttery. MMMM!!!Service was good. It was super busy the night we came and we had to ask the various servers for water, bread, and hummus. Despite that disappointment, the establishment and food were good! I would definitely come back and grub on more Italian."], ["Sandra S.", "Used yelp to make reservations on a Saturday nite.

One of my favorite Italian restaurants in LA (the other is C&O), but the pasta is so much better here, hands down! And I lov e that its so affordable and BYOB. BYOB- I've brought 2 bottles here between 3-4 people and it's been fine, so I'm not sure what the cap is on how many you can bring?Calamari Appetizer- Must get! Definitely unique and a nice change from the deep fried calamari you get at most Italian placesTagliatelle Bolognese- Hearty, meaty, and oh so goodI had alot of other pasta dishes on the menu and none of them have really disappointed."], ["Christina T.", "This place won me at homemade pasta and no corkage fee! If you're looking for a good Italian restaurant without the fancy-schmancy, then this is definitely the place to go. From the exterior, you would probably never imagine this gem of a place..honestly you would probably walk right past it without thinking twice. The inside on the other hand, is very inviting and comforting; from the open kitchen layout to the brick walls covered in art paintings. It is a small restaurant, so they do advise you to make a reservation. We made a reservation but it didn't seem too crowded. I'm sure on the weekends it's a different story. We got seated fairly quickly and the waiter came to open our wine bottle. NO CORKAGE FEE for first bottle! He was very friendly and told us about all the specials.. we ended up ordering everything from the specials menu. Trancio di calamari: This was their grilled calamari steak appetizer. Cooked perfectly.. not chewy at all. It was very light and refreshing, the perfect appetizer before our heavy meal. The garlic sauce on top was amazing. Lasagna della nonna: The flavors were really good, but lasagna is lasagna. What I did like was that every bite had a perfect amount of pasta, cheese, and meat. Tagliolini mare monte: This was my favorite! Homemade tagliolini pasta with mushrooms and tiger shrimp in tomato sauce. \u00a0They cooked the pasta to a perfect al dente and they weren't stingy with the shrimp either....it was super delicious. I definitely would order it again. There's street parking or parking lots. I parked in the lot on Hill between 8th and 7th and it was $4 after 4 on Thursday.

Served with a side of leafy green salad with vinaigrette. This dish I would definitely come back for!- Spinach and Ricotta Ravioli with Red Sauce, where the pasta was perfectly Al dente with just the right amount of bite to it. The filling was so fresh and not overly cheesy which I loved. The pasta sauce was also light and tangy with a nice texture from the Parmesan cheese. Love love loved this dish!Three stars for:- Parchment Paper Wrapped Cod with Assorted Seafood, as everything tasted a bit too seafoody and the cod was cooked quite tough. The flavor of the burnt parchment also seeped into the food which left a bad aftertaste on your tongue while eating this dish. Perhaps we should have tried the other cod dish our server kept trying to push us to order. Either way, I think there were plenty of other delicious items on the menu I will just forego this one :)"], ["Isobel L.", "There aren't many great restaurants within walking distance of my office in south downtown L.A..

Having eaten here several times, I can vouch for the consistency and deliciousness of the pasta. Last night, I had the ravioli ricotta e spinaci \u00a0which was fantastic and also happens to be vegetarian. Prices are on the high end but I was able to take home enough leftovers for lunch the next day. Interesting that a generous portion of fresh, warm bread and garbanzo bean dip are served free when you arrive; but tap water is $.50 per glass! Odd, indeed, but the waiter informed me that this was due to the drought and fees imposed by the city of L.A.Colori now has a frequent diner's program: visit five times, earn an entree up to $13 free.

The service was great and the specials thoroughly explained and my water always full. However the food was subpar. The mozzarella on my Caprese tasted like it was on sale at sprouts, and there was little to no vinegar on it. The meatballs came in a Marinara that tasted like sweetened tomato paste and the meatballs themselves were very basic and left a lot to be desired.

I've never been to Italy, but hope to one day visit and eat my way through every city, but for now Colori Kitchen will do. First off, you MUST make a reservation, especially if you are going to show up with a gang of people (6 or more). They get really busy and the place is pretty small. So call ahead and make a reservation!Appetizers I recommend: 1. Calamari- It's a pan-seared calamari steak drizzled with a lemon sauce and served with baby arugula and cherry tomatoes. So delicious!2. Eggplant Parmesan- It's baked in the oven and the cheese that melts on top is delicious.Entrees:1. Spaghetti al pesto- the pesto is homemade and absolutely delicious!2. Cappellini puttanesca- delicious angel hair spaghetti with cherry tomatoes, olives, capers, and olive oil. (I HATED olives until I ate here)3. Pollo funghi al vino marsala- you get two thick chicken breasts topped with marsala sauce, broccoli, and potatoes. So freaking good!You have to get dessert!! Order their house cheesecake which is made from ricotta cheese (thank me later).Another great perk about this place is the fact that you can bring your own bottle of wine or beer. There is no corkage fee! They do not sell alcohol there!Honestly, everything is delicious. Their specials change daily and are worth trying.***Greg is an awesome server who is enthusiastic about everything and quite the comedian.

I ordered the spaghetti combination. It's only $1 more than the regular entree, comes with a drink and soup. I got the tomato soup and iced tea. When the delivery guy arrived at my work location -- AND HE GOT IT RIGHT ON THE FIRST TRY, unlike most other delivery people -- he was probably the best delivery person in life. In fact, he delivered the best customer service ever: showed me all the food items, got all the utensils, didn't spill, AND he asked if there was any more he could do. He was even more amazing than the food.However, the food was pretty amazing. It was well worth the $20 (including tip) I spent that afternoon.

Surprisingly not packed, but busy. Since it wasn't too packed, we had the option to chose were we sat. Restaurant is pretty small. It is very cozy and intimate with nice decor. Staff was super friendly and attentive.Bread and Hummus? - Not sure if it was hummus, but it was a hummus like spread. It was super flavorful and delicious. The bread was warm and the crust was nice and crispy. Definitely one of the best complimentary breads I've had! It made me hungrier!Calamari Steak: Every body raves about this. I wasn't sure what to expect since the pictures looked pretty plain and boring. The calamari steak is lightly pan fried and sliced perfectly. It is topped with some lemon aioli with a side salad. The calamari was simply amazing. Super sweet and tender - almost has this sashimi taste and texture to it!Tagliatelle Alla Bolognese: I loved the meat sauce and the pasta. I definitely recommend this for meat eaters... it will satisfy your meat cravings temporarily.Pesto Spaghetti: Rich and delicious pasta over perfectly cooked spaghetti. Added shrimp as the meat for $6... not worth it since we only got about 5 shrimps. Very tasty though!Overall, one of the best traditional pasta/Italian food I've had in LA. Parking is a hassle.

What?! That, in it of itself, was a selling point. But, the menu options really solidified our choice. So, we got to try all four of their cheese choices, along with salami, figs, almonds, and a side of delicious honey. This is the perfect way to start a meal, FYI. For the entrees, we shared the crab crostini, mac & cheese (with added bacon for an additional $1), bacaro burger, and seared scallops (for an additional $6). Everything was amazing. The seared scallops...scrumptious! Mouth watering, orgasmic deliciousness. The crab crostini was so good. It's a bit of the mayonnaise-y side, but even the hubby, who hates mayonnaise loved the crostini. The mac & cheese was cheesy and on point! And, it paired really well with the burger. The burger itself was... interesting. It was served in a deconstructed format with an egg on top. It wasn't bad, but it didn't wow as much as the other plates. We each got to try \u00a0their dessert items. The bread pudding was heaven-sent. Paired with the vanilla ice cream...yuuum! The malabi was surprisingly good. I don't think I've ever tried anything with rosewater, but it just went very well with the custard, habiscus, & pistachios. The drinks were flowing the entire time we were there. I got their sangria and the hubby went with a white wine.

I came with my boyfriend and we had a livingsocial coupon. The bad side is that we can't use the livingsocial coupon for happy hour so for two people, we spent the $40 of livingsocial coupon + $25. For $65 dollars total, we did not have a great experience.We ordered the grilled pork belly skewers, bone marrow and bacaro burger with an egg. Everything was actually really disappointing. Everyone says the bacaro burger is to die for, but honestly I would rather have an In-N-Out burger for 1/3 the price. The bread was really hard and dry, the meat was not cooked to medium, and overall, it just wasn't that good. The bone marrow came with pieces of burnt bread and we asked for new pieces in which the server was happy to provide. The pork belly skewers were probably the best out of the three but a little too thick and fatty for our taste. We also got a cheese and salumi plate with delice de cremiers, cana de cabra, and the salumi calabrese. The cana de cabra was a little too strong for my taste, but I really liked the delice de cremiers as it reminded me of brie. The salumi calabrese was pretty good and kind of covered the cheese taste so it was good. The bread came out warm. We also got a liter of sangria to share between us two. Because we could not get the happy hour price, $15 for a liter of sangria is kind of expensive. I did get a good buzz from it but I doubt the boyfriend felt anything. Overall, I was disappointed given I had really high expectations for this place. One thing is that I felt like the service was really good because we wanted to watch football and they don't usually play football on Mondays but they played it for us anyway.

It gets very loud and noisy even with a few tables seated, though I might add it's probably because everyone has been drinking. Hearing was quite difficult in our group of 6. There is a tight, small parking lot in the back or you'll have to battle the LA streets for some parking.This visit/review was for Saturday brunch.I love their variety for brunch cocktails. We went with the bottomless option for 1 hour - yes, they do time you & they don't give you a last call. They bring out your drinks in half-liter or liter carafes. I was happy with my sangria throughout the meal. The rest of my party started with strawberry bellinis - they mostly tasted like straight champagne, and ended up having the sangria.For the tapas, we went with 12 tapas for 6 girls which was a bit too much food. The menu could basically be described with two words: Egg & Carbs. French toast was my favorite dish. Soo good, not too sweet, & crisp to perfection. The tofu scramble was also surprisingly very good. Full of flavor and the warm kale complements the tofu scramble. The bacaro fries includes a fried egg atop a bed of fries with boring gravy - nothing special. The one bite of their croque madame I had was good, but I wasn't clamoring for more- partly due to cutting carb intake in my diet. Crab cake benedict had a nice crisp and was full of crab. Shakshouka: most of my party really enjoyed this dish, but it was much too salty for me. I'd skip the potato hash and goat cheese polenta next time.

Our friends had been wanting to try this place out. And since we hadn't hung out in a while, this seemed like a good opportunity. We had made reservations ahead of time, to avoid having to deal with the dinner rush. And I'm glad we did because even though when we got there it was almost empty, by the time we left, it was almost full. They have a good enough selection of wines, and the beer selection was good, which is always an indication as to how the night goes. Food:My fiance and I started with the crab cakes. He and I are super picky about them, because even though restaurants claim they are made-to-order, some are not. After being reassured that they were not frozen, we order and await. Long story short, it was just \"all right\" but nothing to write home about. We've had amazing crab cakes before (Nikka Fish & Grill - review coming soon; Ruth's Chris - OH. MY. GOD. GOOD.) and these were not \"mmmmmmmmmmmmmm\" worthy. The aioli that they use at the bottom of the cake was delicious, though. We then ordered a Margherite pizza and the braised short ribs to share as our entree. Now, the Margherite pizza is one of my favorites because of the freshness of the basil and the mozzarella cheese. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The pizza was thin/crispy, so it resembled a \"pizza on a cracker.\" The mozzarella was not at all fresh. It looked like it had melted into the pizza, when it was supposed to be big chunks of cheese slightly melted to the top. Also, the basil was wilted and just mixed in with the marinara. All in all - it was not good at all. We finished it, because we do not believe in wasting food and we figured that was just the way they made it. I had to cover the pizza with grated Parmesan cheese to give it some flavor. \u00a0As for the short ribs, they were actually decent. Thank god we chose another entree, because the pizza would have led me to cross the street and order a small at Pizza Hut. The meat was soft and full of flavor. The mushroom risotto was really good. I would have that on its own. And I wish they would have served more brussel sprouts because they were seasoned really well. Finally, we opted for the \u00a0\"dessert special\" which was a blueberry tart with a vanilla bean scoop of ice cream. It was good, but really sweet. The ice cream helped cut the sweetness. But for a dessert, it was all right. I just remember why I never order desserts to begin with. They're always hit or miss. If I were to come back, I would order either the pork chop or the mushroom risotto as an entree. But definitely NOT the pizza. Ambiance/Decor/Etc.The service was good. Like I mentioned, the wine/beer selection is satisfactory. The boys LOVE their beer and they seemed happy with their selections. They are good at making sure that we have water and our plates are cleared quickly. Our server was a bit chatty, but it wasn't annoying or obnoxious. I'd come back for the wine and appetizers but not for an entree."], ["Margot S.", "This place has horrific costumer service. The only good thing about this place was the helpful hostess once we got there . It took 10 minutes of calling for them to answer the phone so we could make a reservation.

The hostess seemed annoyed with us, the waiter seemed annoyed with us, and any tiny change to a dish we requested required approval from the chef. \u00a0Our conclusion is that they don't like kids and I don't think this is a place we would take young kids for dinner anyway but for a brunch on a quiet weekend day we thought it would be alright.

The mushrooms were delicious. Pasta: first of all, they make their own. This always makes a huge difference. I make my own, but I never bother with the little shapes so thank god I've got this place. The orecchiette was definitely my favorite. Those flavors just love each other! Tagliatelle: simple and delicious. Dessert: hands down the lemon ice cream cake thing. Best thing we had.

It wasn't over salted, has cheese burnt, or stale crust.The key that makes Italian food so well adored is the fact that each ingredient stands out. And one can easily ruin that by adding the ingredients in the wrong order, or cooking too long. I'm a train chef you can trust me on that analogy. I love tomato as much as the next guy but went they did tomatoes like they way they did it...mmmm another plate please. I enjoy the pasta more than the pizza. For me I like more yeast in my pizza dough.So the one star off was because it was pricey for its location and ambiance. I mean its not poor by any mean but I don't remember the last time I'd paid $70 for a pizza, pasta, and two wines. Inflation? It's definitely a date spot outdoor is heated and well lit. We ordered Pinot Noir from Garnet Monterey 2012. It was one of the best Pinot I had in a while.

Also, the Burrata Pizza was very good. The olives add a nice kick, and it's even better if you let it cool off a bit. Then came the Grilled Calamari, my favorite, which was FANTASTIC. Very tender, grilled and smokey, with the bitterness of the endive -- you must try it. The whole table agreed it was 1st or 2nd place. The Roasted Bone Marrow was very good, hearty, oily, salty, and matched nicely with the pasta. The Farro Salad was also good, with mint and a nice tangy kick to balance out the avocado, but it's a salad so....The pastas we ate were: Spaghetti Rustichella which had a nice seafood flavor without being too fishy. First time trying sea urchin. The plate was good, but I probably wouldn't get it again because I liked the other dishes more. The Quadretti Alla Carota was actually better, even though it's vegetarian. It had a very smooth texture and mellow flavor. Now, the Cavatelli Alla Norcina was the best pasta dish, and 3rd or 4th place overall. Lots of delicious sausage, with truffle in a nice sauce, and not spicy.Drinks: The Company Man was good, but very strong flavor, pungent, and not for delicate palates. The Cops And Robbers was sweet and tasty, but too small and too much ice. The Duke Silver was sweet and cool, with a nice green color -- probably the best of the 3. Another friend got a pink colored grapefruit cocktail that was good, not too acidic. The white wine suggested by the waiter was also very good, crisp with citrus note.Overall, it was a great meal, with very attentive and friendly service -- we asked a lot of questions about the restaurant and area. We didn't try desert because we were stuffed, but heard it is very good, too. The bill was nearly $400 before tip for 5 hungry people.P.S. -- all my pictures are of partially attacked dishes."], ["Craig R.", "Things started off on the wrong foot with the ridiculous LA Story-esque \"service\" when we arrived. \u00a0We had a very large party and since the reservations were changed at some point they refused to seat us together - and they could have. \u00a0They were just \"punishing\" us for the confusion. \u00a0The food? \u00a0It's pretty good, I can't lie. \u00a0But that said, it's pasta folks. \u00a0The prices they charge are insane for pasta. \u00a0For what they're charging the portions should be huge and they're actually quite small. \u00a0I didn't leave full.Atmosphere. \u00a0It's in a pretty crap part of town, but they've turned their little corner of it into a hipster paradise. \u00a0It's pretty cool."], ["Kayla M.", "You can never go wrong with this place.

I love their cocktails especially \"I am Sky\" is my favorite!!! Must order the \"Spaghetti Rustichella\". It tastes amazing."], ["Kathy H.", "(Best)ia in town! I definitely recommend this place. Unless you want to wait 2+ hours, I highly recommend making a reservation. I went for my gf's bday with a group of friends and I loved the vibes and music here (90s hip hop and rap - lotta Tupac and Biggie). COCKTAILS:Beam Me Up Scotty $13 / The Doctor's Orders $14 -we definitely felt like drinking dark for the night. I didn't try any of their vodka, gin, or rum so I wouldn't know if they are good or not. ANTIPASTI:1. Grilled Octopus & Calamari salad $17 - very surprised at how much flavor was packed in this dish. That chili lemon vinaigrette made it taste amazing. 2. Grilled Beef Meatballs $14 - mouthwatering!3. Mussels & Clams $18 - good but nothing special. 4. Chicken Gizzards - maybe it was the beets, I don't know. It's just not something I would order again. My other friends loved this dish though!PASTA:1. Cavatelli Alla Norcina $29 - I would of had a double order of this if I knew how good this was going to be. The ricotta dumplings and sausage were made to perfection. 2. Spaghetti Rustichella with Sea Urchin $25 - Sea urchin is usually a hit or miss with me. This was lacking some flavor but I would order it again to give it another try. 3. Bucatini with 'Nduja Sausage $21 - it had an interesting mix of flavors. I like this dish because it was a bit spicy but the group I went with said it was their least favorite. DESSERT:1. Maple Ricotta Fritters with huckleberry jam ice cream $12 - MUST TRY! 2. Chocolate Budino Tart $12 - it was alright. The salted caramel made it tasty for me. Can't wait to go back, I want to try some of the new items as well as my favorite Cavatelli Alla Norcina pasta!!"], ["Brittany H.", "definitely by far one of the BEST and tastiest restaurants in LA.... so far! \u00a0i like that it's not that trendy and over the top, but the atmosphere is lively and cool.get any vegetable dish. \u00a0We tried the grape and tomato salad and it was out of this world. roasted bone marrow with the spinach gnochetti was my favorite dish of the night. \u00a0salty, creamy, just the perfect balance of saltiness and fattiness but in a seriously stellar way.creamy polenta - so creamy, with bits of sweet corn heaven... i couldn't stop eating this.. this is the dish to get and that i still dream of. \u00a0super simple, but i'm sure they put some butter crack in here. \u00a0spaghetti rustichella - dish was well crafted with crab and just the right levels of saltinesswhole grilled branzino - i was SO STUFFED at this point, that it was hard to say whether i enjoyed it or not. \u00a0 \u00a0last but not least, we tried the dessert, which composed of mint ice cream wedged between two delicate, thin dark chocolate cookie. It was SO GOOD. \u00a0my friend isn't a fan of mint, but this was a hit!Waiting for over an hour without a reservation was well worth it. the dining experience was fun, vibrant and overall ... i'd do it all over again. \u00a0Well, I'd try to secure ressies in advance!"], ["Fran B.", "Bestia so tastia!This had been on my bookmark list for everrrr. I made a reservation approximately 1.5 months earlier and that was probably the only time I've ever made a reservation so far ahead for NO OCCASION AT ALL. Haha I had to do it, it was the only way..... So yeah, do yourself a favor and reserve ASAP! It was so tough to even score a Friday-Sunday rez so I settled for a Thursday night..... geezzzz lol.Alright so THE FOOD! I think the best way is to do family style or tapas it up and share with your party. I went with my bf so we couldn't try tooooo many dishes, but we sure did try. I would liken this to Animal, which is also another amazing LA eatery, but I would say Bestia's dishes are slightly bigger (even the smallest ones) and the prices definitely reflect that. We ordered 6 dishes, although we had to cancel the last one (skirt steak :( next time) because we were so full before it even came out.Chicken liver crostino - BOMB! My bf fell in love with this one and so did I. What an amazing starter. It was a little chunkier than pate-ish so you get a bit more chew on this one. Flavor was FANTASTIC! Seriously so flavorful and delicious. It was kinda big though, so shared between the 2 of us was good.. but probably woulda been better to share between 3.Mussels and clams - The pics looks too good so I ordered this one anyway knowing the bf will not help me eat it (seafood hater)... but it was so good that he tried the clams and did not stop. LOL he said the mussels were too oceany but the clams were super bomb. It was that good! It actually reminded me of Boiling Crab's whole shabang sauce, but more refined lol. The seafood were cooked perfectly, so clean and soft and tender. The broth was amaaaaaazing, especially to dip in toast. Garlicky and spicy.Grilled lamb meatballs - This was hot and cool all at the same time. The yogurt and mint was a nice contrast to the grilled balls heh, and altogether made for a delicious dish. Texture was off the charts, so tender!Cavatelli alla Norcina - Probably the best pasta I've had........ maybe...... I dunno but that shit was fucking delicious. The pasta itself was springy and al dente, soaked in the best creamy smooth sauce EVER. It kinda reminded me of like a chicken noodle soup flavor, but just elevated and included these fantastic pork sausage pieces. In love. No wonder it's their most popular dish.Roasted bone marrow - This was different because it came with spinach gnochetti (some type of pasta) instead of the usual bread or toast. Omg! The pasta was slightly crisped or toasted or something, and that really really made this dish so much more delicious. With the bone marrow scooped out and mixed in, that crisp was definitely necessary. The flavor was amazing, but I gotta say it was rather oily. Very interesting (and new) way to eat bone marrow. MMM.The food came out in the order above, and the pasta and bone marrow came out around the same time. I would suggest ordering one or the other if you only have a party of 2, because those dishes are mass carboz, which I love of course, but fills you up. They were both basically pasta dishes.Between the 2 of us, the above dishes REALLY filled us up. We couldn't even eat dessert so if you plan on getting some, order a little less? lol and me and the bf are pretty big eaters.... so you know, don't underestimate em.Total was about $100 (almost) even, and with tip like $120. I prepared myself for it soooo it didn't hurt too bad lol. If we had gotten that skirt steak though, mmmm lol.So the other aspects - service was amazing. Our server was nice and quick, which is all I ever ask for. They also have valet for like $7 so you don't have to worry about parking. I hear there's also street parking available sometimes. The location is very very modern, industrial, and pleasing to the eye.

Spaghetti Rustichella - honestly I don't know what the hypes about. It was only okay. Got the peppermint ice cream - very good and the maple fritters which were also nice.

STRAIGHT DOWNHILL FROM THERE. Garbage overall experience... One word to describe this place from top to bottom: pretentious. DO NOT GO TO THIS OVERRATED SHACK. It insists upon itself...unwarranted We all ordered our drinks, were served something completely different...called the waitress out on it and she said they'd tried sneaking an alternate past us...terrible... All you have to do is tell me that you don't have what I ordered. Common sense. I can't believe that they would actually try to sneak something else past their customer. I've honestly never even come across that before. Then we tried ordering a couple different drinks, they didn't have either of them. How does a place not have a common whiskey on a Friday night? The clientele is less-than-classy...hipsters/flamers/try-too-harders..purple-colored-hair everywhere Suuuuuper slow service.. Food is 1/2 way decent.. Very small portions... Brought the polenta porrage out with no spoons..weird Several quiet lulls with no food, no drink, no check-in... Painfully ready to leave, we ask for our check - it takes 15 minutes to come out - we pile on 4 cards and ask to have the check split evenly....the waiter brings back one of our cards and says: \"there is no money on your card\" This insane fool ACTUALLY tried to sneak in this underhanded, disgusting comment - I don't let nonsense like that go..I call him on it and ask him what he said, like a coward, he changes it, knowing we all heard him and now he's at a loss for words, stammering, feeling stupid....I ask him three more times and he continues trying to act like he said something else, making a bigger fool of himself, so I had to slap him around...We rectify the issue with cash and he then brings our check with no concession for their mistakes, shocked, I tell him to correct it...this clown argues, I set him straight like a petulant child, he feels stupid, sends out some manager, who tries to give me double-talk, actually has the audacity to argue with and speak over me...I set him straight and dismiss him to make the necessary changes...he tucks tail, does as he is educated to do, makes the correction, we leave. THIS WAS A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE FROM START TO FINISH.Tip to the restaurant....do not put the utensils on the tables, they are dirty, the fact that you don't know that shows massive, inexcusable ignorance.

Made a reservation for an anniversary dinner in late April on a weekday evening....almost 4 months in advance (booked in January @_@)!So the place is in a very industrial looking part of downtown LA. Bestia is at the end of a dead end street, so don't feel confused when you're driving down the street looking for a bougie restaurant and all you see is large warehouses. Parking is valet on that dead-end 7th Place street, so look for nearby street parking if you must. Keep in mind how late you may be walking around at night, but know that it's likely the other parked cars have owners dining at Bestia.Once we were inside, it looks very much like a hip and happening place. Loud music. Tons of people. Both the music and crowd noise level made it very hard for me to talk to my bf and hear anything he is saying. Not to mention hard to hear the server as well.Now, let's talk about food! Our server mentioned plates at Bestia are meant for sharing. You do need a lot of plates to be full though! Portions are TINY for the price. Dishes on the menu come and go, so some good recommendations from other Yelp reviews (like the coffee and donuts and the uni spaghetti) would and may not be available during future visits. Chicken liver crostino $10 - rich with a slight sweetness. Very rich. I would either order this or the bone marrow, but not both together -- it may be too much!Grilled octopus and calamari $17 - a good balance to the other dishes that were very rich. Came on a bed of greens.Roasted marrow bone $16 for half size. Like the chicken liver, it was also very rich. It's super small for the half size. Absolutely mixed it in well with the spinach gnocchetti -- you won't regret it!Cavatelli alla norcina $29 - tastes better than it looks. Served in a deceptively shallow plate so I thought I had more left of the entree than I actually did. Bucatini alla'nduja affumicata $21 - a bit spicy. Cheesy. Has pork sausage. It was our back-up entree since the uni spaghetti was off the menu when we went. Strawberries and cream $12 - the substitute dessert since their menu did not offer the coffee and donuts. Came with a walnut macaron (size is in between the small and large at Lemonade) with the cream in the center and strawberries surrounding it on the plate. They added a candle since it was our anniversary. (No, the dessert was not comped.)Food did take a little while to come, but during the time we waited, our waters never went empty. Like seriously. If we drank a 1/5 of our glass, one of their bus boys would swoop by and refill the glass with the container of water we had on our table. Towards the end of the night, I got scared of drinking too much water because I worried any dip below a full glass would be refilled almost immediately. Definitely the only place I've seen so much water refill.When you get your bill, they also include a slip of paper notifying you that there is a separate mandatory 3% kitchen charge, in addition to tipping your server. I have mixed opinions on this (both from a political and tax perspective), but just wanted to share the presence of the charge in my review.Oh yea. You will smell afterwards too. Felt like I had just dined at a hot pot place or Korean BBQ joint. Overall, we left feeling hungry still but full from all the richness in the food we ate. It's not that we couldn't order more. It's just that given what we ate, we felt everything was super rich (too rich for our arteries kind of rich) and we needed to do a major workout or detox afterwards instead of ordering more heart-stopping food.I don't regret choosing Bestia for an anniversary dinner, but it's one of those places where once is enough for the experience."], ["Michelle H.", "I finally had the chance to dine at Bestia last weekend - I can honestly say I've never had so much trouble getting a dinner reservation! Here's the rundown...We were seated on the outside patio and from the get go the service left a lot to be desired. I mean, it's Bestia, obviously we were super excited to be there, but our server was giving us zero enthusiasm and was pretty inattentive. We ordered a couple of cocktails to get started - the Ambassador's Tea and the Slot Machine - both absolutely delicious, though we received food before our drinks. We went with the chicken liver crostino and the bone marrow for apps. The chicken liver was very overwhelming for me, but the bone marrow was divine. Easily the most unique and memorable bone marrow I've ever had. I loved that it was served atop gnocchetti to be mixed into as a sauce. After a lengthy debate we settled on the casarecce al pomodoro and the cavatelli alla norcina for our pastas. Both were utterly perfect and contrasted each other so well. I would highly recommend ordering both, but I can say for certain I'll be ordering that cavetelli next time I'm there!For dessert, we chose the maple ricotta fritters and the chocolate budino, and both were some of the best desserts in recent memory. The fritters are so unique; they're served with a maple butter and a berry sour cream ice cream that absolutely sang in an ultimate bite. The budino was the perfect level of chocolatey; the filling was so creamy and bordering on dark, but the crust was light and crumbly. Both are musts! If we can manage to get a reservation again, we'll definitely be back.*My overall MUST ORDER dishes are: cavatelli alla norcina, roasted bone marrow, maple ricotta fritters, and the budino."], ["Anthony H.", "A wait until springSoft marrow on toasted breadHer gentle smile"], ["Lillian C.", "Did not have the best experience here.

The spaghetti rustichella was delicious! It is the pasta with sea urchin and squid ink! It came in a rather big portion as well. Some of their dishes are on the smaller side. The margherita pizza, however, was burned and rather unimpressive. They also charge for water ($1) per person by the way. Overall, was not impressed. I have had better experiences at Italian restaurants in San Diego."], ["Diana B.", "I've been wanting to try Bestia during my last LA trip after seeing photos of the octopus and the zabaglione al moscato dessert, but forgot to book online in advance. I called the week before my visit, and after waiting in the queue for 10 minutes, I scored a counter reservation for two over the phone. The staff was very friendly and even accommodated my change in time the same day via email. I arrived two hours earlier than my 11pm reservation, and the nice hostess got us seated at the counter in 40 minutes. The space is beautiful although very loud. \u00a0Every staff person that we encountered was very nice except for our dedicated server who ruined the experience for us. Our server took our order, and then other staff members served our food. My boyfriend got a beer while I wanted something non alcoholic. Our server said for the soda they had coke and lemon soda, or they can make a soda for me with ingredients they had on hand, and left to give me time to think. I wanted to see if they can make a fig leaf soda but didn't see our server which wasn't an issue until later on during the meal.They have a changing seasonal menu so we started with the oxtail in cacao pasta parcels which was delicious although a small portion for $20. I was excited to dip our pizza crust in the pasta sauce. However, when the neopolitan pizza arrived, it was very burned to the point of being acidic and bitter. Our server later walked by but never asked us how the food was. We saw him standing and talking with another server so we flagged him down when he walked by again (nope, he wasn't going to even check in with us). We showed him our burnt pizza and he said Bestia's pizza is supposed to be \"charred\" like that and walked away!Finally he comes by again after our plates have been cleared to ask if we wanted dessert. I got the maple ricotta fritters with maple butter and huckleberry ice cream. It was good, especially the ice cream. I was curious to try the fig leaf ice cream, but then our server brought us our bill. We didn't even ask for it yet! After waiting 40 minutes, we only dined in for 40 minutes, and four seats were unoccupied next to us. The bill came with a quote by Alice Waters of Berkeley's Chez Panisse and a note that they charge a 3% gratuity for kitchen staff so we can adjust our tip accordingly. It was ironic that I came all the way from Berkeley to LA just to have mediocre Alice Waters'-inspired food (I love Chez Panisse and have never had a neapolitan pizza this burnt). The 3% fee didn't bother me since in SF we're used to paying a health fee for the staff, but that fee is typically printed on the menu too. Bestia's menu didn't mention that and only noted the $1 charge per person for water. We paid, tipped, and mentioned the experience to the manager on the way out, and he apologized that we were rushed."]], "The Factory Kitchen": [], "Speranza": [["Britt W.", "I've been to Speranza many times and they always get it right.

They changed that and now you can't. i made a special trip to LOU wines on Hillhurst and Franklin to buy biodynamic wine I have allergies to pesticides. I have yet to drink it. Couldn't drink it that night. The pros are the food is pretty good. Although I ordered the Branzino while good it doesn't come with a side so then it's an order of something else.

Yes, the $9 yellow beet salad, served carpaccio style, is good. But they lost me at the Ziti. \u00a0It was served lukewarm, with unevenly cooked chunks of eggplant with skin. Chewy, not smoky, and the ricotta salata was nearly imperceptible. A bit overly garlicky to boot and wayyyy too salty. Not my cup of tea to say the least. \u00a0And they were sold out of the lasagna at 630pm so trying that was not even an option. Hmmmm.

When our waiter disappeared for more than 30 minutes and we ran out of water, we really started to wonder about this place. \u00a0Her explanation when she finally returned (after being summoned by us and at least one other quizzitive table) was simply that they all help each other out. \u00a0So we should just know to flag any old person down?? On further discussion, she did say they had a shift change at 7 and she was moved to another section. Really? A shift change at 7 on a Saturday night?And to top off this frosty review, we knew to preorder the berries with cream and almond meringue cookies. So we ordered them at 630. When dessert time came, they were out of berries. What? \u00a0Out of the main ingredient for one of your THREE desserts? \u00a0 Are you kidding me? \u00a0The manager's explanation was that they had a lotta kids show up \"through the night\" who had eaten all the berries.

It went above and beyond our expectations - homemade pasta dishes (perfectly cooked pasta dishes + exquisite, flavorful sauce), appetizers (a sort of caprese dish with some of the best mozzarella I've ever eaten), and solid service. My husband is a picky Italian (a contradiction, I know) and he ate my leftovers very enthusiastically the next day. Prices are great and portions are huge. I'm not an expert in Italian food but the essence of it tasted very authentic. The only thing mildly lacking is ambience, as it sits right on Hyperion. However, it is obvious that they put a lot of effort into taking care of the property; there are plants and vines and small trees to spruce up the place and make sitting outside enjoyable."], ["C.C.

The shrimp and fish is fresh and it's a perfect dish to start. Light and citrus y. Some like their ceviche more with lemon/lime and some like it a but on the sweet side. It was definitely a combo of both. And the chips were great too._Foccacia Vinoteca, I'm not a big pizza eater just because It's very carb heavy and I try to stay on the light side, but their pizza comes so thin crusted, it's more like on a huge tortilla wrap rather than a dough crust. Very thin and crisp, after we finished I did not feel as full or stuffed. Salty from the prosciutto and the arugula adds the prefect amount of greens. I wish it was less salty but its to be expected when you get prosciutto. A definite must try._Kale Salad, I don't remember the name but it had kale, avocado, quinoa, tomatoes and cucumber with olive oil dressing. Light and great to share, another great dish to start off with. The service is great! friendly and accommodating. Overall great experience. Would definitely come here again with friends for their happy hour menu."], ["Carol M.", "Someone needs some wine 101. \u00a0I think they store their wines in a sauna.Had the house red, which tasted like it came from the Applebee's menu, followed by a $13 nebbiolo, which tasted like a $7 glass of wine because of the temperature. \u00a0 Both were served at about 75 degrees. I dunno, it may be just me, but I think any restaurant advertising itself on wine should respect the wine it serves. \u00a0Proper serving and storing temperature is critical to enjoying wine."]], "Monarca Pasta & Grill": [["Turner R.", "WOAH. \u00a0Surprisingly good. Classic Italian. Amazing food. Would highly recommend to anyone!!!!!!"], ["Simonne K.", "The chicken fettucini was really good.

A nice little place to eat if you're hungry don't want to spend too much."], ["Chai N.", "Had the pasta fettucine in red sauce. Was pretty good. Although they mixed up my order. I'd asked for the pasta fettucine in white sauce. Small place but seats small groups properly. Their fries were good too."], ["Nathaly P.", "My boyfriend and I had dinner here and the food is delicious. I had the camarones negros and he had the pasta primavera. Amazing flavors!! Good people and very chill environment. You don't find quality food like this in the hood!!!"], ["Jaime D.", "Love this place had never seen it before it looks new. Had it for the first time its kind of hidden. Had the shrimp pizza let me tell you best pizza i've had in a very long time the flavor its amazing it simply melts in your mouth. The shrimp pasta was awesome better than the one at Olive garden for half the price."], ["Julissa M.", "This is my new fave restaurant. I got recommended to this place from a friend and ever since then I come here almost every weekend. My fav dish is the pasta primavera, I mixed it up with both chicken and shrimp. I've tried almost everything on the menu from pastas to pizza to burgers and even burrito. They never disappoint. Hands down the best restaurant. When you come here its a nice friendly family vive to it, plus the employees are really nice."], ["James K.", "excellent food at a very reasonable price. assume the chef must have cooked for a upscale italian restaurant before opening up this spot. for me, the location is a bit out of the way but the food makes the trek worth while."]]}
