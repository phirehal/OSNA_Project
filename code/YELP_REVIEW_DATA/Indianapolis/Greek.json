There are many buffet in the city starting at 7$ to 10$ with great customer service and clean people. I will never be back to this place. My advice, take some course in customer services, clean the tables as soon as the customer leave. Don't leave the people with tiny dishes alone for long time AND try to reduce the price 15 $ is a crazy price. This is the highest buffet price in all the whole nation......"], ["Nic J.", "I really enjoyed my lunch here.

The buffet is great, especially the veg options. I would have expected them to have better non-veg dishes but the okra stew, falafel and hummus blew me over. The coup de grace was definitely the Coconut Cake. That just blew my mind. You must visit this place if your in town and looking for a nice lunch."], ["Heather B.", "We LOVE this place. There are days that I dream of their hummus and have to make the stop. The falafel is downright perfection in my mouth. Often they have to make more as soon as they see me coming through the door.

We were not disappointed.The restaurant is tucked into a strip mall behind Castleton Square Mall. It's about $13 for the buffet, which includes drink. It sounds a little expensive until you see what you get for that amount of money. The buffet includes plenty of options to please vegetarians and carnivores alike. There were a variety of salad choices, hummus, pita, tziki, beans, rice, falafel, gyro, \u00a0kabobs, and more. We tried a bit of everything. \u00a0The only thing we disagreed on was the spinach/artichoke side dish - I really liked it; my husband wasn't crazy about it (but loved the kabobs).We will definitely be back!"], ["Anna L.", "First timers? Yep. The owner greeted us, explained the process of paying at the counter before we grabbed a plate, gave us a thorough lunch buffet tour of their offering. Then he let us 2 ravenous beasts loose! Good first impressions so far.The buffet is divided into 1/2 vegetarian & 1/2 meat so it's a nice mix for the herbi-, carni-, omni-VORES. So we started off with a mixed salad w/ crunchy cucumber chips, diced tomatoes, & loads of feta cheese. Got a side of lentil beans to mix in as well. While I'm at it, I got a scoop of tangy lentil soup. Not being completely overstuffed on chowing down plate #1, I managed to get plate #2 - creamy artichoke (a lady's favorite said he), grape leaves stuffed w/ herbed rice, chicken kabob, gyro meat, apricot chicken, falafels, cracked wheat, & a pita bread sliver. Need I name more? Oh, don't forget a small bowl of hummus & yogurt to dunk your food in! Being ravenous beasts as we are, snuck in some coconut cake drenched in rice pudding for dessert at the end. Make sure to shake some cinnamon - Voila!Well...that was an effing good lunch. I like the fact that you pay before you eat - especially if you're on the run. Careful that you don't over-eat and fall asleep in your office chair back at work though. Weekday buffet is $11 and weekend is $13 (probably more specialties). Quite wallet-friendly for the freshness and variety they have.

Well, today, with an extra hour to kill and already in the area, Mediterrano Cafe was the perfect solution.Somewhat expensive for a lunch buffet, we felt it was well worth the price. Hummus was surprisingly smooth, and the tzatziki was cool and full of flavor. The warm pita was a perfect medium for slathering the good stuff onto! The pita is not pocket pita, rather a thicker, softer bread, sometimes called laffa or taboon. We happen to prefer this to the pocket pita as it holds up better and seems to have more flavor. We also enjoyed the tabouli, and my wife particularly liked the onion salad which were complimentary side dishes. The star of the meal for me was the chicken kabobs and the falafel. Kabobs were juicy and well seasoned, and served with onion. A pita with kabob, tzatziki, and the spinach artichoke dish made for a great mouth experience! We also very much appreciated the handmade, but perfectly formed falafal. Not so much ball, more dome shaped, these tasty morsel were large but light. A shmear of hummus on pita with a dome of falafel and you have a heckuva lunch.We dont typically visit buffets, but this would be a regular exception. If only it were closer to home!

First the place was bright (well lit) and clean, a definite plus.Keep in mind our exposure to Greek / Mediterranean food is limited to 1-2 different restaurants with similar menus. This was not where we would normally go for Greek food. \u00a0I had the falafel dinner which came with a Greek salad, plus I ordered a side of Feta and Olives. My dinner had 4 falafel fritters on a bed of lettuce, 2 different hummis, some pickles and olives. One of the hummis was quite good but the other had a strange texture and sweet taste not to my liking. The pickles also had a very strange taste to them. The falafels them selves had a lot of cilantro in them, to the point the were green on the inside. Cilantro was also garnished over everything on the plate. The issue with this is that I do not like cilantro.The side salad was good it actually looked amazing. Taste wise however was good, not as fantastic as it looked. The Feta and Olives was just that plus more of those strange tasting pickles. this was good, I love Feta and black olives.My wife had the Spicy Gyros. She said the meat was quite dry but tasted good and said it was not \"Spicy\". It came with rice which was so dry she would not eat it, and again with cilantro. The stewed beans she said was great, she was amazed as to how well they tasted.

Tzatziki sauce drizzled over stewed gyro meat and saffron rice helped to balance the various flavors. \u00a0 The place was busy for the weekday late lunch period, although the non-functioning AC made the dining room a little humid and uncomfortable; hopefully, this will be remedied as the weather warms up. I'd like to go back for dinner to sample a few dishes off the menu, beyond the buffet offerings...especially the mezza platter referenced by other reviewers. It would have been cool to see some falafel on the buffet, but since it tends to dry up quickly, I can understand the exclusion....and I may have just visited on non-falafel day. I agree that some type of dessert or fresh fruit is needed on the buffet.

Well, that's a buffet for you!We went for a weekend lunch. Everything was delicious. On the mezza platter, the hummus was really, really good, as were the falafel and grape leaves. The pita bread tasted good to us. The kafta was excellent, and the fries were kind of addictive, althoug oddly a crispy fry seemed to alternate with a limp one. I prefer crispy.Service was prompt and friendly if confused -- portions of orders were forgotten, checks were a little mixed up -- but I'd definitely do back and recommend the place to friends."], ["Muhammad M.", "Great place ...

The chicken sandwich and fries were both cold and tasted like cardboard. \u00a0Our take-out order was incomplete, and they wanted us to drive 30 minutes to pick up what they had left off. \u00a0I feel this restaurant would be better served just offering gyros and NOTHING else, because their Gyros -spicy and plain - were absolutely amazing!"], ["Christine B.", "Dined here this weekend on a restaurant.com gift card. The prices here are so reasonable that we had a hard time getting to our minimum purchase in order to receive our discount! But that's a good problem for a customer to have. Saganaki was very tasty, although it does not arrive en flambe as it would a regular greek place. Nevertheless, the pita was fresh and soft, salad was fresh, and the gyro meat was the best I've ever had. Other places the meat is dry, overcooked, or overly greasy. This place it was perfect. Service was impeccable and very friendly. This place is family owned and operated. Baklava was heaven! The owner's son even came over to say, \"the baklava is easier ate with your hands instead of a fork, go ahead, dive right in\" It wasn't too terribly busy on a Friday night, I assume, because they don't serve alcohol, but sometimes you don't need booze to enjoy a good meal. Next time I go, I'll have to try the turkish coffee. The presentation alone is worth it. They also deliver within a certain radius. I really appreciated this place. Also, there were quite a few middle eastern families dining in here, which is always a good sign that if the families here are from that culture, this is as authentic and as real as it gets!"], ["Adrienne C.", "Just went to the Parthenon for the first time. I had heard this place had good authentic greek food. I was impressed. We had Saganaki and it was excellent. I also had Koshary for the first time. He said it was an authentic Egyptian dish that they serve there. I really liked the sauces on it a little spicy but not too hot and it came with greek salad. I was really impressed with the number of vegitairan and vegan options. My boyfriend got the gyro plate and the greek fries and was impressed with the flavor and the huge portion. \u00a0The service was also excellent.

I guess my expectations was warm and pleasing decor with softer lighting. My trip to to the restroom found it dirty with at least 3\" of dirt along the baseboards and entire restroom was needed a thorough cleaning. The overall restaurant needed a fresh coat of paint and a good scrubbing. The duct work above my head was thick with dust and the black ceiling fans were gray with dust. I think I''ve made my point and I didn't even see the kitchen.Service was friendly and fast. I ordered the SPICY gyro and subbed salad for the French fries. The gyro was a decent size for lunch with tender meat and a hint of spice. Rather bland for again what I expected.

The salad was fresh, crisp iceberg lettuce with a slice of tomatoes, 1 blks olive and a few sprinkles of cheese. Good but over dressed in oil.

I ran into trouble when I asked the server to confirm that the tahini sauce was dairy free. Obviously no tzatziki for me, but she eventually told me the tahini was okay. I had a reaction later, so I'm not really sure she asked the cook. I'm pretty sure she didn't get what constitutes dairy since she told me later she could offer a dairy free dessert. Cheesecake. Yeahhhh. If you don't have any allergies or questions, the food is tasty and cheap. I'd grab a spicy gyro here again sans sauce."], ["Krista R.", "Ate here recently with family. Two of us had gyro plates -- highly recommended. Another had chicken shawarma -- he loved it! We all started with the lentil soup and hummus/pita. Everything was good. Side Greek salads were tangy and fresh. Great sauces with the entrees, too.Only thing we didn't care for: the lights are BRIGHT. I would have loved a more intimate, romantic feel to the place. But the walls are bold and the lights harsh. I guess it IS in a strip mall...In summary, Parthenon has a simple menu. The food tasted fresh and delicious, and everything was a reasonable price. Atmosphere not the best -- will consider takeout next time."]], "Ali Baba Cafe & Hookah Bar": [["Dylan E.", "Not a bad place, but I think with the abundance of other restaurants around town to go get a gyro at, this one didn't really offer anything to compensate for prices that I found to be higher than most others.The location is conveniently close to the circle, and has large windows in the main seating are to offer a good people-watching experience. There is a back room that is much more decorated and looks like a fun place to go sit, but we weren't offered the option to go there and didn't notice it until we were leaving. It looks like it was probably where their hookah area was but now is just for eating, but don't quote me on that. They had some sort of fun Middle Eastern music on in the background to set some ambiance, but also had a big TV with football games on, so you get a little bit of two different cultures. The service wasn't quite on par for a place with only a handful of customers during my visit for lunch on a Saturday. The same person, who did not at all look happy to be there, was wearing many hats and was working as the hostess, waitress, bus boy, and cashier for the entire place. We got our orders in pretty quickly, but that was about the extent of it as far as service goes. I think a lot of it had to do with a decently steady stream of to-go orders getting placed at the hostess counter and taking up her time, but attention to our table was noticeably lacking.The food was ok. I went with the \"full\" gyro instead of the \"half\", which turned out to just be two smaller gyros and leads me to believe the half gyro is just one. Because of the two sandwiches, you end up with a lot less meat and a lot more bread than other places that make one big gyro. The pita was tasty and warm, and the meat tasted like what you get off of any of those large rotating spits, without being too dry or overcooked. The tatziki sauce left a lot to be desired, and was basically just chopped up cucumbers in a very watery base. It was definitely not yogurt based and whatever the runny sauce the cucumbers were in was, it just immediately dripped all over the place when you tried to eat. It came with a couple pieces of lettuce and one small bite of tomato. Overall, a place I'd probably go back to if I was craving Mediterranean style food and it was conveniently close to where I was at the time, but not somewhere I would go out of my way to visit again."], ["Corrine P.", "For lunch I ordered the spicy gyro and greek salad.

I was not going to argue because I do in fact love gyros, so I eagerly accepted the idea. The restaurant is also a hookah lounge, but since we were in there around lunch time, between 11am and 12pm, there was no one smoking inside. The lounge is separated from the area of the restaurant where you consume your food without inhaling smoke. The music was very loud for a sit-down eating experience, especially for that time of the day, so that wasn't great, but the food tends to make up for it. I ordered the full spicy gyro sandwich with tzatziki sauce and my dad did a half sandwich of the same dish. The gyro was delicious. Spicy, but not overwhelming, and I was able to easily eat the entire thing. We also ordered a lamb appetizer pizza. It was also delicious, but somewhat small. Since we both got gyros, it wasn't a big deal and were probably somewhat happy it was so small, but for a party of more than two people, I would consider getting something else. Our pizza consisted of four tiny pieces of pizza. But all very delicious pizza. The feta cheese is strong, and the spices are plentiful, so be prepared for what you are ordering--it's a very strong dish. I was beyond pleased with the food. The service was good also, but mind you, we were the only two people in the restaurant. The server was foreign, so that could potentially be hard to understand for some, but it was fine for us. The food came within about 15 minutes; a perfect amount of time for light conversation. Something I thought was neat was that there were small tables outside, so on a nice spring/summer day, you could enjoy your meal outside on the sidewalks of downtown Indianapolis."], ["April S.", "It was so good, we went back the next day and took two friends.

The taziki was a little thinner than I was used to, but after a couple of bites I was definitely sold.At $9.27, it was a bit steep to make it a super common meal, but I think the half size would be plenty for most people.

We also ordered the avgolemono (lemon orzo soup). Dinner also included a toasted soft white bread.Everything was delicious and disappeared before we remembered to take pictures. The salad was not overly vinegary, the meats were tender and well seasoned, and the pastichio had a nice creaminess to the sauce. The hummus came with soft warm pita that had been toasted on the bottom - delicious!We will definitely be back to try new items, including the grouper special."], ["Kelsey S.", "I love this place!

We asked for a second pita - $1.59. We both ordered the dolmades, one with rice and the other with potato. Both came with small Greek salads (at least smaller than a year ago). The four EXTREMELY SMALL (size of my pinky finger) dolmades were very lightly topped with what appeared to be curdled, not-very-appetizing-looking avgolameno sauce. We decided to try it before sending it back and it tasted fine, so we carried on. The portions of potato and rice had shrunk considerably since last year, and the price of the dish had increased ($17.99). The only portion that was pretty close to what we had been used to was the green beans. Our total bill (including two iced teas) without tip was $55.00. The server was good (although our iced teas were not refilled) so we tipped her 20%, bringing our total to $66.00. Bottom line, our meal was tasty but for $66 we shouldn't have been hungry at the end."], ["Robert W.", "First visit.

The lamb burger was on special, so we definitely ordered that! And we also split the Gyro Piato and the Mousaka plate... all three were complete authenic bliss! SOOOO GOOOD. All came with a side Greek salad, a mix of rice pilaf, greek potatoes, and green beans as well. Needless to say we took some home and left more than fully satisfied, and it was all worth it!

We noticed everyone received some bread with their salad course (toasted garlic bread type) and not many people were eating it so when we ordered we requested pita bread instead - I recommend you try this as well, the pita is excellent. The greek salad was one of the best I've ever had, perfect amount of dressing, herbs and feta, it's a must have when you visit.I was in the mood for gyros so I got the platter (not the sandwich) which was perfectly prepared - the meat was hot with the edged slightly charred just how I like it, the green beans were tender and seasoned nicely, their potatoes were slightly bland but I ate them with a little of the Tzatziki sauce and that fixed them up to my liking.Portions are generous the decor was authentic (what I could tell in the dim light), our server was attentive and friendly.

( or lack there of ). If you read my reviews, then you know I always throw in the fact that I was in the \"industry\" for almost 20 long years, and my girlfriend was also in it for well over 10 years. We are not overly harsh and unrealistic about service, but when we get bad service we call it for what it is.The reviews about the food people have gave are pretty much spot on. Food is indeed good, and ample. Good beer and wine selection also. I have been going to Hellas here and there for many years. And the food has never disappointed me. Saganaki is wonderful, mezza plate is great. All the meats are fantastic. There really is something for everyone here. Great place to take kids, as well as a great place to have a nice night alone for adults. You won't go home hungry.Now, on to what ruined our night, and could ruin any night for anyone. I've seen as of late \"yelpers\" calling out their server by name, and even describing the server. I have not, nor would I ever do that. If you're a conscious GM, or even a owner, you know exactly who your bad and good servers are. You don't need me to give you their name. At any rate, we got there and the place was hoppin. People were still eating and drinking, the piano man (who's there on Fridays only) was still playin', looked like a good time. We were sat promptly, and our server came by and said they'd be right back to take our order. OK, we're drinkers, we like to have some cocktails and thumb over a menu. Once they returned they ask if we were ready to order our meals. I asked if we could throw in a drink order first, and their response was \"yeah, sure\". This wasn't a yeah sure happy kind of way. I didn't hear a sigh, but we expected to hear one kind of yeah sure. Drinks came back, we ordered the obligatory Saganaki, it was great. Server did not return to the table for about 20 minutes. Unacceptable. There's a fine line of overly checking up on a table, and just flat out ejecting from one as well. Naturally we were dry, and thirsting for more libations. They finally returned just after the 20 minute mark and we gave our dinner order. They started to bolt from the table and I said \"I'm sorry can we get some more drinks\"? AGAIN, the response was \"yeah\". This was with their BACK to us with the response. What if I wanted something different? or my GF wanted something different? They caught themselves and turned back around to say \"I mean you want the same things..orrrrrrrr\".....I just said, \"yeah, sure\". Drinks came back, then they brought my plate....just mine. Not my GF's. That came after I sat there starring at my dish. Then they finally brought her dish. Listen, I've been to Europe many many times. Still have family that live there. I GET that's how service is over there. But were in INDIANA. There were no more offerings of post dinner drinks from the server, no offerings of desert ( we don't eat it generally anyways, but it's nice ), nothing. We weren't the last table in there, so don't even try that. And still, we have been the last table in plenty of places before, but we're always our servers favorite table because we generally tip almost 50%. Not that night. In closing, I'm not bashing Hellas directly. It's a great place. I'm just saying to you use caution. In other words, if you get bad service, I told you so. If you get great service, let me know who they were. We'll ask to sit in their section next time."], ["Sam L.", "Stopped in for a to-go order of just the gyro sandwich. Was almost $9, which I felt was a bit overpriced for only a sandwich, no side. The sandwich had no lettuce or onion, as is the norm with other gyro sandwiches I've had elsewhere.

The same goes for the traditional tasty tzatziki--another downright delectable dip. If you know Greek soup, your highest standards will be met with the house Egglemon soup.

Really, the outside of the building looks like this, and although our table was crooked as all get out, the decor looked nice and charming. There was sort of this thick, wood trim that almost reminded you of being in a reception room of some sort of church. But the living room was also pretty narrow. I don't know, it was kinda strange. A bottle of Skol vodka sat on the counter in the kitchen. I figured it was probably for cooking then thought very little of it. The food was very mediocre. The green beans were completely flavorles, and the moussaka didn't have much flavor, either. The potatoes tasted pretty good, though. My boyfriend had the veggie platter and it was $20! Mine was $15.

The Fatoosh was cut in very small cubes, including the pita bread, and had too much dressing. Still, it tasted good and fresh. We also liked the humus, but found the tzatziki a bit tasteless.

Whoa - the entrees are at $18. However, sandwiches are $9-$10, and that's reasonable enough so we went for it. Had to laugh when the host seated us far away from other folks - it's not a dressy establishment, but we were really underdressed compared to other folks' classy casual wear. The decor is very nice with living room type chairs and a ceiling painted as the sky. It was nice to sit by the window and view the canal.The water is fancy - comes in a name brand glass water bottle that they set at your table. Ordered the hummus. It's got texture and is light on the lemon and garlic. It's good! But I prefer the creamy Lebanese version we got back in the Dearborn area, with lots of lemon and garlic. However I loved the fact that the pita bread is served warmed!! We also got oil and spiced for the pita bread as well. For $7, it's way overpriced (hummus costs little to make when done so in large quantities). The amount, however, was more than enough for my roommate and I. I just miss living in a densely Arabic populated area where you get a quart of hummus for $5. Alas! Regardless, within Indy restaurants this prices was about reasonable. My friend got the Kibe as a meal, even though it is an appetizer. Sirloin with ground beef, onions, barley, etc - it's very good. The tzaitiki was loved by my friend, but very different from the heavily cucumber taste that I'm used to. I got the Kafta Kabob (Lamb) and it was served in a pita. Quite good! Sadly I was already full from the appetizer so I only ate a bit. The meat was very good and I'd recommend the sandwich.The server got the job done, but not especially friendly. That's fine, however, because as long as I have what I need, I don't care if they're bubbly.Why only four stars and not five? There is no need to have Mediterranean entrees at $18.

The only really disappointing item was the pita bread. It's just so doughy - not like any authentic pita bread I've had at other Greek restaurants. I'm not sure how to describe it other than Americanized pita bread!The rest is very, very good, authentic Greek food. I'd highly recommend the lamb kabobs, as they're seasoned and cooked to perfection. I had the lamb kafta and it was good, but nowhere near as good as the lamb kabobs. The accompaniments with the meal (feta, olives, pickles, lettuce) are fresh, and the rice is prepared wonderfully (not too overwhelmingly flavored). We also loved their standard side salad that comes with entrees - it's just fresh lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers with a vinaigrette, however, the vegetables are juicy and taste like they were picked that day, and the vinaigrette is so light that you don't mind it's not served on the side.I'd recommend the mango juice if you're looking for a refreshing, not-too-sweet non-alcoholic beverage. We finished our meal with some ouzo, and it was wonderful, too.The atmosphere is very nice, but if you're going to sit outside, don't bother going for the side with the canal - there's not really much of a view other than some screaming ducks, a dirty canal and the occasional homeless person walking by.

Now, I'm not saying it's a \"healthy\" salad, but there are vegetables so...that counts for something, right? The delicious, deep fried falafel patties are where I start getting in trouble. But they are so, so good and not your typical falafels either. These ones are made with leeks, and in place of the more common garbanzo beans, they use fava beans instead. Perfectly spiced, perfectly crispy fava bean patties atop crisp lettuce, fresh tomatoes and cucumbers, and pickled red onions, you really can't go wrong. I personally like to customize the salad a bit by swapping the dressing for their spicy tahini instead.

As it got dark outside, the lights would turn on, giving it a nice dim lighting inside the restaurant.

The dishes was huge, especially the salad, it looked like a green mountain with plenty of calamari. The second dish rice and ground beef \u00a0placed the dish almost like a thin steak with salad on the side.

The wrap was divine. \u00a0The pita is thinner than traditional, lending itself to letting the contents take the spotlight. \u00a0As they should. \u00a0And they will. \u00a0The beef was tender, juicy and seasoned perfectly. The subtle hints of cinnamon (sounds weird, I know. \u00a0It's a Greek staple in savory food.) compliment the parsley, pickles, onions, garlic sauce, tahini - and who cares what else, PERFECTLY. \u00a0The taste took me back to my days living in Flint - and ironic as it may seem - made me long for them. \u00a0Well, at least for the food. \u00a0The liquor stores, hookers and broken dreams - not so much.

He had a great sense of humor and made sure we all had a great time. He also gave us a deal to get 4 enormous plates of appetizers, so that we could try them all, and only charged us for the special lunch price apiece. This allowed everyone to try four different appetizers instead of just one. Five of six diners ordered Doner (gyro meat) while I had the chicken kebab. The chicken was seasoned perfectly - not too spicy but with flavor. Everyone loved the buttery veggies and gobbled down the bread.

The dining area is a comfortable size and inviting, as it is clear that you're in a converted house, which preserves a good deal of the cultural authenticity one may expect from such a place.- FOOD/DRINKS: This place unexpectedly shines. \u00a0The menu, while a bit expensive for some, falls within the $$-$$$ range for entre\u00e9s and presents Turkish cuisine that will blow you away. \u00a0My beliefs were that food from this region would not be a flavorful or spiced as others around the world; boy was I wrong. \u00a0THIS FOOD IS DELICIOUS. \u00a0Their lamb chops were extraordinarily tender and cooked and seasoned to perfection. \u00a0I would position these higher than some of the best steaks I've ever had. \u00a0Though they bring out a basket of warmed pita bread prior to your meal, I wasn't quite sure how to eat it since it didn't come with any dipping sauces or oils. \u00a0Color me confused. \u00a0The other dish I tried was made with chicken and spinach topped with a spiced yogurt. \u00a0It was heavenly. \u00a0The only complaint I would have is that I wish the serving sizes were bigger (but that's the American in me talking).- SERVICE: This is the area that could improve, thus 4 stars and not 5. \u00a0Admittedly, part of the slight issue I found here was a small language barrier, which is largely uncontrollable. \u00a0The other half of this issue is controllable and they could be much more attentive to tables during a diner's experience. \u00a0- OVERALL: Bosphorus is an outstanding place to eat if or even if not you're craving something out of the norm. \u00a0It's just very good and should become an international food spot added to your mental list of places to eat. \u00a0Do it."], ["Jessica B.", "Stopped by for some appetizers.

My dish was good overall but some bites were moist and others dry. I sampled some of hers and thought it was flavorful. She remarked it was a bit on the greasy side but it didn't stop her from finishing her dish. Pleased there were at least four or so vegetarian entrees for her to choose from.

Effes is one of my faves, but the Turkish red wine REALLY won us over. Just fantastic.We then ordered some apps, which were the stand by for me in Borek, and also the Feta cheese plate. Both were delicious. The Borek has kind of gotten a bit smaller thru the years, but that's US economy for ya. Still, very tasty.After we were done chillin' and appin, we ordered dinner.I had the Adana kabob, and she had the Lamb Mediterranean. Both were freaking phenomenal. The spices they use in the kabob, combined with the beef and the lamb just are amazing. The Lamb dish combined with the vegetables was perfect as well. No desert, but we opted for the obligatory Turkish coffee. Who woulda thought a Turkish joint has good coffee??? Sarcasm at it's finest, trust me this Turkish is second only to mine. Just perfect!

The Spanakotiropita Were Outstanding. \u00a0It was also a huge portion, and I ended up having 2 pieces to bring back home. \u00a0They reheated in the oven perfectly, and were outstanding served with the brunch I made us the next day. \u00a0I had also requested a side of feta to eat with my dinner, but it never came. That was a bummer, but I was stuffed, so it wasn't a huge deal (we did notify the server & had it scrubbed from our bill though). \u00a0The food was served with a hot, crusty loaf of bread...which was good, but TOTALLY unnecessary. Next time, and there WILL be a next time, my goal would be to not overly stuff myself like I did on our first visit. \u00a0I really wanted to try the Baklava.The only downside is that while I think the \"belly dancing\" aspect is a fun touch...it was TOO MUCH on the night we were there. \u00a0They pump up the music really loudly during the dance. \u00a0But if it goes on for more than one song...it's just too much. \u00a0It's impossible to have a conversation during the dances. Fine for one song, awkward for more than 1 song. \u00a0It was really bad on the night we were there, because the dancer knew a big family that was sitting at a table by us. \u00a0After her 2-song dance, she brought out extra castanets to the plethora of kids sitting at the table (who had been done with their meal for more than 20 minutes, but the parents were visiting with staff), so they could try using them. That's a cute idea in theory, for a couple of minutes...but over 10 minutes of children banging tiny cymbals without rhyme, reason, or rhythm...it brings out my angry side. \u00a0That would be a great activity for OUTSIDE the restaurant...not inside to the detriment of other diners' ears. \u00a0But, if you don't mind Club-Music-sound-levels & cacophonous mayhem...then indoor dining will be right up your alley. \u00a0I left with a pleasantly full belly...but a rip-roaring headache from the castanets. If visiting on a weekend again, we would gladly choose outdoor dining instead of indoor if weather was agreeable...simply because it seemed quiet outside."], ["Joanna B.", "I am ebarassed to see that I have not written a review for this wonderful restaurant.

I'd give the food 4 stars but overall 3 stars. \u00a0We started with the 4 dip appetizer cuz we love Middle Eastern style hummus and baba ghanoush, but their hummus and eggplant dip were Greek takes on them and they were not what we expected. Both were very garlicky but somehow a bit bland. \u00a0I ended up liking the taramosalata best (caviar paste dip which the server described as a \"fish dip\"). \u00a0Husband and kid ordered gyros, which they both liked--entree portion was huge. \u00a0I ended up ordering the Souvlaki, since i figured i'd get some some bites of gyros from the rest of the table. \u00a0My entree was also huge and the pork was tender. The problem was the service. We felt nearly ignored by our very slow server. \u00a0Empty drink glasses and extra plates were crowding our tabletop and I was never able to catch her attention in the small dining room. Request for extra pita bread took a looong time. It did get more crowded as we sat but the dining room was pretty empty when we first go there. The decor was definitely dated and it didn't feel very \"clean\" anywhere. There was a belly dancer that night and her music was WAY too loud. \u00a0We probably won't be back. Although a friend suggested this place over Santorini's, I have to disagree."], ["Anastasia C.", "Was in Indy for nascar and stopped here for dinner. We ordered the saganaki that was amazing!

But it's clean and those dark, \"trendy\" restaurants start to all look the same. Anyway, this place has a homey, mom & pop feel. I had already scoped out the menu on Yelp and knew what I wanted: EVERYTHING! So of course I ordered the Greek islands special and my husband had the Korinthians dinner.So much food! I ate as much as I could but still left half my food behind. Everything was delicious but special mention goes to the Gyros meat which was so savory and well seasoned and the moussaka was the best I have ever had! My husband enjoyed his lamb chops. This was his first real Greek experience and he is now a fan. I am subtracting half a star because his chops were slightly over done, but he wasn't asked how he'd like them. \u00a0They were still juicy and delicious! \u00a0I wish we had room for dessert but the belly dancer would qualify for a good after dinner \u00a0treat.

We have been going to Greek Islands for years and just recently visited Santorini. It blew Greek Islands out of the water in every regard. The Saganaki was better and over double the portion size. The salad and bread and significantly better. \u00a0The gyros at Santorini were served in a pita (as expected) and the meat was much juicer and less dry than at Greek Islands. The green beans and potatoes were also more succulent and flavorful. And oh my god, the baklava. It's much more juicy and flavorful at Santorini. It was no contest. Santorini slayed Greek Islands with each food item we ordered. I love, love, love the service and people at Greek Islands. I will still go there if I need to get Greek closer to downtown. But otherwise I'm making the extra drive to Santorini from now on. At the end of the day, the food itself is number one when choosing a restaurant. I hope that Greek Islands can covertly take a field trip to Santorini and spy to see what I mean. I would love to see them improve their food to be on par with Santorini because I do think Greek Islands has a better atmosphere."], ["Michael C.", "We found this place from 4square while on a trip to Indy. Very close to downtown. Huge portions, and very friendly staff. They do a little fire show when you order one of the cheese appetizers and that inevitably grabs the attention of all patrons.

Plus, it provided a mini show. \u00a0The Chicken Souvlaki was good. It was almost two much food. The Gyros and the lamb chops looked excellent. I only wish that they didn't have flour and I could enjoy the taste of the dishes.I would recommend making reservations on Saturday night.

On the Southside of the Circle in Indy, you'll find the loud and crazy yet simultaneously warm, cozy and comfortably cramped Greek Islands.

Family-style seating, with a group of 15-20 other folks, including cousins, employees, miscellaneous relatives and some foodie-types, this dinner was quite the experience. \u00a0We left in an amazing mood, smiling and not worried in the slightest about the possibility of a hangover on a Tuesday morning. And because there was so much food tasted with the wine, that outcome was practically impossible. From bubbly to bubbly, from soup to salad to shish kabob, I felt perfectly at home.Each course was paired precisely with Greek Islands' food offerings, woody Chardonnay with lemony soup, South American reds with grilled chicken and meat pies.The chef wrapped up the meal with a trio of petite phyllo sweets, filled with mint, cherry and chocolate. \u00a0You can't just get up and walk out the door, either.

Let me start by saying that I have had all of these dishes before, the flaming cheese, the Greek soup, the hummus, etc but at the Greek Islands they were all just Meh. Best flaming cheese is Pegasus in Chicago, best Greek soup is Pegasus Taverna in Greektown Detriot, and best hummus is Burning Bush Grille in Louisville. Now don't get me wrong, I was not expecting this place to beat them all out but I was seriously thinking I would get a good mix! The soup was not edible. Both of us tried spoonfulls and left it alone - that bad. The hummus - a mediteranian staple, tasted like ground chickpeas. Exactly like ground chickpeas. I didn't get the flavor of garlic, lemon, tahini, cumin, etc. The tzatziki was ok but very plain yogurty - not much cucumber. Hubby had the gyro plate and said it was fine. The one thing we both thought was really good and saved this review along with the great service \u00a0was the Taramosalata.

You can definitely tell that everyone works very hard and enjoys what they do. The food was absolutely fantastic. We ordered the saganaki as an appetizer. The saganaki was tangy and delicious. For dinner I had the chicken souvlaki and my fiancee had the pork souvlaki. Both dishes were excellent. My chicken really was out of this world. The seasoning was spot on and the chicken was very tender. Both entrees came with a Greek salad, green beans, rice, tzatziki sauce, and potatoes. There was more than enough and we were able to take some home to enjoy later. I would absolutely recommend this restaurant!

I asked her for a better table - there were 2-3 empty tables by the front window so I asked for one of those. She informed us that those tables were for party's of 4 and there might be some party's of 4 coming in. (So was the table wrapped around the support column ??) \u00a0Seriously ?? Told her we were \u00a02 for sure customers ready to spend our money here! After her refusal to give us one of those tables (or any others) we left and went down the street to another restaurant. After eating we walked by Greek Island again and there were those tables at the front window; only one table was occupied and guess what --- By a party of 2 !!!Never Again !!!"], ["Stephanie W.", "We went to Greek Islands for their monthly Wine Dinner and it was superb! We really had a chance to get to know our table because there was such a large turnout, we were elbow to elbow. Our table was great, though. We all shared food and stories. The wines were wonderful, for the most part. There was only 1 I didn't care for at the end of our meal. We will definitely do this again. I love the Stergiopoulos family is wonderful and Angela is incredibly welcoming!"], ["Bada B.", "Great food and family dining experience. This is the only place in Indy that will make you feel like family. From the time you arrive til you leave, it is a Greek Experience and I am Italian. The belly dancing is very interactive and family friendly with a very knowledgable staff. Sunday for Colts game is a great time as well and a good place to park for colts game. They have some deal where you pay for parking and get some discount if you eat inside. Also you can get beer to go for waliking to the game and it is not overpriced.OPA"], ["Julie M.", "Been eating here for years and still my favorite Greek restaurant. \u00a0My husband and I always order the huge sampler platter, and they even substitute some of the items that we don't like."]], "Adel's Gyros": [["Mike M.", "When you approach the door, you're about 20 feet and $8 away from the best gyro you've had this year. Probably your life.I'm making sure to give them 5-stars to counteract my fellow Yelpers' smoothness that this place is a dump or a dive.It's no frills but very well maintained.The crinkle fries were really good too. Cooked to crispier than average perfection, just like I like them!I'll be back to try their falafel!"], ["Dan M.", "Adel's Gyros is a place most might drive by when you see the outside. Or you may turn around and leave when you walk in. It may not be much to look at but it does serve good gyros and hummus. I had the spicy hummus with pita. The hummus is somewhat runny but has good flavor especially with the chili paste on top. Not really middle eastern but still tasty. The gyros are huge and easily make two meals. Spit roasted, not cooked on a flat top. The tatziki has large chunks of cucumber and is very good. Could use more garlic though. Give it a shot, maybe Adel will use the extra income to renovate the restaurant."], ["Deirdre G.", "Whoa.I decided to come here because it was on the 2015 Yelp Top 50 Indiana Restaurants list and I figured I'd put another notch in my belt for trying to eat at every restaurant on the list. The fact that it was closer to my new office helped out a bit, too. Adel's Gyros is in one of those hybrid strip centers/medical buildings that are designed to look like houses with pillars out front and windows on the roof that don't seem to lead anywhere. I knew once I pulled into the center that the place was going to be a dive, and I was right. You could almost call it a dump, but I feel really mean for saying that. Regardless, the tiles haven't been replaced in eons, the walls are marred with nicks from the chairs, and Greek Orthodox iconography are awkwardly placed throughout.I just looked at the list, and this place is #17. Naturally, the second thing that ran through my head was, \"Then, this food better be a life-changing experience for me.\"Only one man was working; I went in after the lunch rush, maybe 1:30p or so. Two parties were sitting outside and another were inside. I had a difficult time trying to choose what I wanted to eat because everything sounded so good. Remind me the next time I go to try their spanakopita, dolamities, baklava-- oh, screw it, I'm going to make it a point to try everything on their menu!I ultimately decided to go with the falafel and it was really amazing, served on a bed of pita bread, tomatos, onions, and cukes with hummus and tzatsiki on the side. I'm pretty sure it was supposed to be eaten as a sandwich, but no matter how hard I try, I can never keep all of my fillings in my tacos, so I ate them all individually.The falafel itself was piping hot, so I managed to get through one of them before deciding to eat my veggies. In that time, they were still warm, but bearable to the touch. The falafel were crispy on the outside, but not super crunchy like some are, and the pita, hummus, and tzatsiki were clearly homemade.So the four stars is attributed to its shoddy decor and ambience, but honestly I think their food more than makes up for it. I most certainly will be going back and will more than likely try everything on their menu."], ["Huong T.", "Huge portions and the owner is so charming.

It is by far the best gyros one can get in the Indianapolis-Carmel metro area. Highly recommended. On my first trip about a year ago, I had the falafel and hummus, also spicy, which were both delicious, though not the best I've had (coming from a Jewish family, our homemade is hard to beat!). I would definitely say that the ambience and overall look of the restaurant is run down, but I think this might benefit it due to the low prices, quick and friendly service and traditional look of a Greek dive restaurant (there are Greek flags and Greek heritage photos throughout the store). My only problem is that I felt the store might not be clean due to the fact that it is indeed run down. 4 stars."], ["Katy K.", "This tiny little hole in the wall is my new favorite. \u00a0Service goes a long way, and Adel is the sweetest little Greek man you'll ever meet. \u00a0He was kind enough to let us sample the lamb meat and later treated us to baklava (holla!). \u00a0I can confidently recommend both of them. \u00a0You won't be coming for the decor, but you'll be staying for the food and the service."], ["Christina T.", "I have traveled all around the US eating Gyros every now and again,ADEL'S has the best Gyro sandwich....Can't wait to try their other dishes."], ["Saher H.", "This place is delicious.

Oh well...I get to write another one. I was upset my first visit here because they were closed at least an hour before they were supposed to be.

Seriously, nearly the entire tray was meat. And the meat was gooooooood. Pretty tasty stuff. And their tzatziki is good stuff, too. Don't expect a nicely decorated location, because you won't find that here. It actually sort of looks like they're in the middle or remodeling...but they're not. It's just really like that.

While I knew I wouldn't be considered one of the \"regulars\" as I don't live in a small town and don't often find my general neighborhood in search of a meal, there's just something about a laid back small-town diner that makes me smile. I'd wanted to try this place since the days when I drove by it on my way out to seminary in Richmond, Indiana. As I pulled into the parking lot, I noticed that they had one defined accessible spot. It had the wheelchair symbol on the concrete, but not the actual sign (Which, in Indiana, means it's not legally enforceable). There's a ramp that leads up to the front door, though you should be aware it's not completely ADA compliant in terms of its grade. I didn't have any problems with it, but someone with strength issues might struggle a bit. The cashier/hostess area is right inside the front door and I was greeted promptly. To your right, there's a main dining area and there's a secondary dining area with a television further to the back. I was seated at the very first table, though it was a spot that made sense. The restaurant wasn't crowded yet as it was early in the dinner hour. Those who were present appeared to be largely an older group of folks that included both singles and couples. They appeared, for the most part, to be regulars and were obviously being treated as such. While I wasn't quite in the clique, I was still treated well and I enjoyed watching the relationships that staff had with the diners. I wrestled quite a bit with what to eat, but found myself inspired by good friend Rick Garrett, also known as the Tenderloin Connoisseur, a blogger who specializes in that great Hoosier delicacy. So, I ordered what was billed as the \"Giant Breaded Tenderloin.\" It came with either fries, chips, cole slaw or something else I've completely spaced. I added fries to it along with an unsweet iced tea. I have a feeling that The Tenderloin Connoisseur would find this to be a disappointing tenderloin. While it certainly is sizable, that's not exactly rare among tenderloins and I've definitely experienced bigger sandwiches. The sandwich was meaty, but there was just something about the taste that was a little off. I looked at the meat and it just didn't seem right. It wasn't a bad sandwich, but by the end of it I was more than happy to be done with it. The bun was slightly toasted, but it tasted like your generic bun and was a bit too crumbly. The french fries were standard American fries that, once again, were neither good nor bad. The sandwich and fries costs $9.99, which seems a tad high for this kind of place. That said, I did see a number of other sandwiches available from $5.99 - $8.99 or even full meals for decent prices. My server was attentive, but while she offered me dessert she never offered me a refill. As an iced tea addict, I found this a bit disappointing as at least one refill seems fairly standard. If I could, I'd probably rate Sero's smack dab in the middle with a 2.5 star rating. It was practically the definition of an average meal. That said, even with my disappointment with the tenderloin, I found myself feeling like this was a decent yet disappointing meal with friendly people as staff. That said, I live not far from another similarly themed local chain, Lincoln Square, and my experience at Sero's was certainly not good enough to become a destination spot. If I happen to be driving by it and am hungry, I'd definitely stop but I'd also definitely not order the tenderloin again."], ["Lee S.", "Very busy yet prompt service. Hostess was seating others so waitress jumped in and showed me to a table. \u00a0Wide range of menu options. \u00a0Lumberjack B'fast: eggs cooked perfectly as ordered; grits (substituted for potatoes) thick & creamy - also a nice portion; large portion of biscuits & gravy was nicely flavored & creamy with ample sausage pieces. 2 split biscuits were soft and toothsome. All in all a nice meal with no hiccups."], ["J.c. W.", "Stopped by for dinner as I was driving by, and I was not disappointed. I was surprised that they had so many daily specials. I chose the Sero's Fried Chicken with mashed potatoes and corn. This was exactly the comfort food I was looking for. The service was friendly, and I expect that if I lived closer, I'd visit often. It seems like most of the guests were locals that the staff knew by name. This is the kind of restaurant I like to hit. A local place that keeps America going. Only minor negative was that the glass of water didn't taste exceptionally good. Thank you for a great experience."], ["David B.", "Breakfast is on par. Prices are a little tall but the selections and portions are legit. \u00a0Good enough that we wanted to try dinner. We probably wouldn't do another dinner. Authentic Greek feel down to the bad eyeliner, QVC on the TV hocking gaudy jewelry, and guy in the first booth jabbering away on his phone. I had the Greek combo. A pile of onions tomatoes and a few cucumbers with some pita, feta, meat, and an overcooked chicken portion. For a starter I asked for a salad and soup. Salad dressing was so separated all I got was oil and the soup was supposed to be beef and cabbage. \u00a0With no beef in sight it was all cabbage and tomato skins. Our entree was about 30 seconds behind my soup and salad, and my kids' chicken tenders were served straight from the fryer at an unsafe temp. The server was nice but the food quality was on par with a school cafeteria. The prices leave more than enough margin to have some quality, but it wasn't there. Shop Greek at GFS or Sam's and save your money. On a positive note, the spanakopita was probably great when they made it Monday, but they served it to us on Friday and it was hardly suitable as a coaster for my drink."], ["Andrew M.", "My family and I went to Sero's for breakfast one Saturday morning, and it was packed, so we thought it must be good. All I could figure was that the crowd is mostly made up of regulars who just go to the same place all the time. The price was too high as compared to Lincoln Square Pancake House. The pancakes were chewy and tasted like they had dish soap in them. I couldn't finish mine. My kids liked their chocolate chip pancakes, though. The eggs and bacon were very greasy. Coffee was also oily / acidic. Service was below average, but they were very busy at the time. As Kevin said, the decor is way outdated, and the place felt dirty to me, like there is a coating of dust and fingerprint smudges over everything. I definitely do not recommend Sero's. Drive farther to the East and eat at Lincoln Square Pancake House. You won't be disappointed."], ["Audrey K.", "I used to work a couple doors down from here. I like to eat local and the girls in the office all raved about it, so I figured I'd give it a go. My roommate and I went in for breakfast. They had cartoons on the TV's going too loud and the service was terrible. The server messes up our drink orders and when the food came out of the kitchen it wasn't what we ordered. I don't mean like we got another table's food. I mean it was almost what we wanted, but not close enough to eat it anyway. The food was fairly lackluster.A few weeks went by and the boss decided to take us there for lunch. I couldn't even tell you what I ordered because it was so wrong. So very wrong.
