They visit the Statehouse Market on Thursdays in the spring/summer, and I nearly always get the pig and fig sandwich. Delicious, fresh ingredients grilled to perfection! I also highly recommend the zucchini fritti. Hot and tasty, and the sauce they serve it with adds a nice pop of flavor. You might have to wait a little while for a meal at the Twisted Sicilian, but it's worth it. Everything is made fresh to order and delivered with a smile."], ["Brittany L.", "Owner (guy taking orders) was super friendly and knowledgeable about the items. We received our order in 3-5 minutes...timely! The Italian Beef was FANTASTIC. Soft bread, perfectly seasoned and a bit spicy, tender sliced beef, and just wet enough that you could still eat it standing up without looking like a total pig.The other food items sounded good too: fried ravioli, pig and fig, penne a la vodka, cannoli. This makes it into my top 2 Italian Beefs in the city of Indy. Price was very reasonable too...$7-8 and our huge sandwich (we shared) came with pita crisps! As a bonus, the plasticware and packaging (other than the aluminum foil) are made of plant-based materials, not petroleum based! I know these cost a bit more for them to purchase and I appreciate them doing a little extra for the environment."], ["michael g.", "I tried the Italian Beef tonight at the First Friday Food Truck Festival and it was amazing! They have hot, medium, and mild as options and I had the medium. It was very large and more than enough for 2 to share. Give this place a try."], ["DeAnna P.", "I got the Sunday special -- a 6 inch meatball sub, fried cheese ravioli, and a drink for $12. \u00a0The fried ravioli were FABULOUS -- great flavor, just enough breading, and nearly exploding with cheese. \u00a0They were served with a side of vodka sauce. \u00a0The sauce was a little thin and nothing special. \u00a0I don't know that it would impress me if I had it with just plain pasta. I withhold judgement of the meatball sub. \u00a0There is some spice that I have a serious aversion to -- I think it makes food taste like dirty water. \u00a0Unfortunately, I can't figure out what the spice is, and my husband thinks I'm crazy. \u00a0Long story short, the sub had this spice in it, so I didn't like it, but that doesn't mean you might not love it. \u00a0Hubbers said he would give it 3 out of 5 stars. \u00a0Hubby wrongly assumed the meatballs were GFS -- not true! \u00a0The owner just let me know they are handmade, so +1 star. \u00a0He also just told me that apparently my aversion spice is thyme. \u00a0Good to know!I did appreciate though that there were 8 smaller meatballs instead of 3 giant ones. \u00a0It definitely makes for easier street eating."], ["Valerie S.", "Food Tried:- Penne a la Vodka (tomatoes simmered with garlic, basil, vodka & cream then tossed with penne) ($6)- Sicilian Chicken Salad (roasted rosemary chicken with walnuts, gala apples, sun dried cranberries & parmesean cheese mixed in an Italian basil infused aioli, served on a fresh baked croissant) ($7)*ding ding ding* Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner! In the contest of which food truck has the best recyclable materials in their packaging, Little Eataly is hands-down the winner. Cardboard container, tin foil, plastic cutlery and paper napkings are all recyclable! And, if I had ordered a San Pelligrino, I could have recycled that too!Little Eataly has been elusive for me. They've been around since the Super Bowl (I mean, who wasn't around for the Super Bowl), but their schedule has been tough to pin down on the days during the week when I am available to have food truck meals. But, after seeing weeks of raving Twitter reviews of their penne al vodka, I finally messaged them and requested a day that I knew I would be available to have a midday meal in the downtown area, and they obliged in setting their schedule to accomodate.The easiest thing to do would be to not write the review myself. I'll just let their Twitter followers do the talking: \u00a0 \u00a0@BSMBlog: DELICIOUS. Totally makes up for being ditched for lunch. \u00a0 \u00a0@HollyEssex: I just had the best #pennevodka ever with the cutest #cannolis ever. \u00a0 \u00a0@MyIndyTV: We loved the penne, ravi fritti & cuc salad.I mean, see? I don't even have to do work on this review. People have been raving about Little Eataly since they hit the streets. I had their Penne a la Vodka with a breadstick, and had a tasting of Sicilian Chicken Salad, because it looked so darn tasty. The chicken salad was crunchy, between the apples, walnuts and cranberries, but still very smooth, which I'm going to attribute to the aioli.Back in college, they used to make a vodka sauce in the dining hall that was aggressive and spicy. The vodka sauce from Little Eataly is NOT this way, so if you too have had traumatic vodka sauce experiences, never fear. With Little Eataly, you can enjoy a creamy, cheesy vodka sauce seasoned with a variety of tasty herbs and offered copiously on perfectly cooked penne. The fact that the penne comes with a breadstick is vital: it will be so tasty that you want to eat the whole thing right up front, but you must save some for when you finish the pasta, as a way to enjoy all the vodka sauce left over. But, here's another important point: you're going to have to do this in two servings, because Little Eataly offers a generous size for the price, and then you get to enjoy it twice as much!Speaking of, the prices offered by Little Eataly are really quite reasonable: dishes range from $6 to $8, and are generous in portions. I should probably cut this paragraph out considering that I haven't really had anything to comment on about prices in, uh, ever.Let's see... Is there anything else I'd like to suggest or add? Well, since you're paying still reading...1. I was wandering through your website and noticed that your menu link leads to your facebook page. While we all know how much I laud facebook, it would be easy to have it on its own page that matches the rest of the website, for continuity and appearances... but that's just a thought.2. The hand-written menu nor the truck had the price of drinks listed. I'm really nitpicking here because frankly I had a great experience and it seems like a lot of the issues I've commented on in the past with other trucks aren't concerns here.Which is to say, great job. Thanks for making me proud of my Italian heritage."], ["Connie C.", "Amazing is how I would describe the food at Little Eataly! I've been a food groupie since the Super Bowl. I follow them on Twitter to visit regularly! I've not tasted anything that I didn't like. My favorites are: Zupa Tuscana, Fried Zucchini, Fried Ravioli, Penne a la Vodka, and the Sicilian Chicken Salad. Everything is delicious! Today I had the chick pea salad and the fried zucchini. Who knows what tomorrow might bring! To my amazement, they have added Fruit Sorbets and Gelato. I've tried the Blood Orange Sorbet and the Cannoli and they were both awesome! I can't wait to try other desserts! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If you are looking for a food truck that is way above the rest, please visit Little Eataly. Rob & Chea should open their own high-end restaurant. It's that good. The beautiful food presentation and fresh ingredients are executive chef quality. My palate, my eyes, and my tummy thank you Little Eataly! \u00a0 Did I mention how affordable the food is?"], ["Katy W.", "WoW! If you see this food truck, stop and get a Sicilian chicken salad sandwich. I don't like chicken salad. I'm afraid of mayo. This is SOOOO good. I can't wait to try the rest of the menu items.

Frankly, we were worried about being \"those customers\", that kept the staff around on a holiday when they would rather be at home with their families. As it turned out, the staff at Buca's was wonderful. They genuinely wanted to make our Thanksgiving dinner nice. Jerry, our waiter, was particularly gracious. He was so hospitable that we felt like being in his home."], ["Vin R.", "Came here as a group of 8 (4 adults and 4 kids) with reservations for 6:45. \u00a0Entering the restaurant was a little odd as the main entrance takes you through a long tiled hallway and past the kitchen to the maitre'd stand. \u00a0I actually walked halfway down the hall with kids in tow and then turned around and went back out to the street because I thought we came in through the service entrance. \u00a0I've only been to one other Buca Di Beppos before and the rest of the restaurant was pretty similar. \u00a0Low ceilings, dark walls and tons of stuff on the wall, most notably a high number of Sophia Lauren pics.Anyway, we were seated right away and our server took our orders for drinks. \u00a0We went ahead and put food orders in for the kids with our drinks to avoid a potential hungry, cranky kid problem.The drinks were fine, though it was odd that my wife's first two choices were already sold out (at 7pm?) but she's not too choosey about that stuff. \u00a0The kids' food was fine and ended up being enjoyed by both the adults and the kids as our food order was significantly delayed... To the point where the kids were finished with their food and were ready to leave. \u00a0So we ended up canceling the grown ups' orders and getting our check. \u00a0Kind of a bummer, but the serving sizes are so big, the kids' food ended up being enough for everyone.Our server and the manager apologized profusely, saying the kitchen was inundated with a large volume of orders all at the same time. \u00a0Indeed, the kitchen did look very busy as we navigated our way out of the restaurant..."], ["Richard A.", "Visited today with my familyThe waiters were friendly and the decor funky and unusual as always.Most of the meal was good.My only issue was with the Penne Alfredo.Most Italian restaurants list their various pasta with the type of meat or sea food or offer you a choice.Not here.It was just plain pasta with very little Alfredo sauce, making it feel dry .Overall it was a pleasant experience"], ["Connor M.", "Great Italian restaurant downtown. The family style of eating allows everyone to pick and choose to taste multiple dishes. It's a very large restaurant and has a great atmosphere.

Come on, when a few pieces of garlic bread is $13, and fettuccine Alfredo (plain) is $16??? Decorations inside, while 'Italian-themed', are too many, too busy and over-whelming. Looks cluttered and dirty. Waiter very nice though."], ["Rachael H.", "I have determined Buca isn't worth my time or money. After a second rather disappointing visit to this \"authentic Italian\" restaurant for dinner, I think I would rather just go to Olive Garden if I'm going to pick a chain Italian for my dining choice (if that tells you anything).The first was just with my husband for a nice dinner out. I will hand it to them that the decor, while it is kitschy and a little over done, does make Buca seem cozy and friendly. Their cuisine however is lacking in what I would consider real Italian flair. I am a big seafood fan, especially mussels prepared with linguine, and was looking forward to trying their version. The mussels came with very little marinara and they were quite chewy (as if someone had left them under the lamp too long in the window.) Now, I will say that our server was kind enough to not charge us for this and offered to get me something else to compensate. This made me feel like giving them at least one more try.Last night was round 2 dining with the Buca crew at their downtown location. I was with a much larger group in town for a convention, but we did have reservations. We were seated promptly and our servers seemed attentive. Unfortunately the bar and kitchen staff just didn't have it together. We waited a whole hour for our drinks to come to the table, and the bar-tending crew couldn't just admit they didn't have the ingredients to create the frozen drinks we had asked for. When our food finally arrived (AFTER two other tables who were sat after us got their food first!), the entrees were just okay. The fettuccine alfredo needed some serious pepper to spice it up and the calamari was so overcooked, I couldn't tell if the tentacles were actually squid or dead spiders. Very \u00a0disappointing indeed.To be fair, our waiter seemed like he was trying his best while under pressure...apologizing for the delays and trying to check on our orders as often as he could. But, the rest of the kitchen staff needs to seriously pull it together if they're ever going to want me to visit this establishment again. In addition, they could have given us some kind of discount for waiting so long for our food AND drinks.My suggestion....if you want family style Italian, it's worth shelling out just a little more for Maggiano's up by the Fashion Mall. The ambiance is better, the food is ALWAYS stellar, and the drinks keep coming....ON TIME!!!"], ["Naser A.", "I have tried this place in Pittsburgh over nine years. So I can say this is my \"first\" experience.The place looks unique, and very authentic Italian resturant. The waitresses are very welcoming and the place is large.Most of their dishes like any italian resturant are sharing plates, and a Small size is good for two people. And Large usually for four people and more.We got their signature salad, the Apple something. It tasted good. It has blue cheese, cinnamon pecan and lettuce.We got breaded chicken with marinated sauce.Overall, the food tastes good, but I feel like it is missing something.I would go again, and probably reserve the place for a big party next time since they have many seating and rooms."], ["Charity P.", "We absolutely LOVE this place!

The meatball was huge, and it's not dry. The only thing I didn't like was that the sauce was too liquidy. It's NOT waterdown, just liquidy.

Both glasses had stains on them which is not acceptable for the price.We ordered the Baked Ziti. Instead of a hearty baked dish, it was essentially just pasta with very little sauce.

Because we were feeling pretty peckish we decided to sit at the table in the kitchen. This experience was a bit unpleasant as we smells as if we had been cooking in the kitchen all day when we left. To add insult to smell, about 15 tables were available from the time we arrived to the time we departed. On a positive note, the food was absolutely amazing! The portion size was enough to satisfy the largest of appetites for several days.

It's strange to be able to see the kitchen while you wait for a table, but it adds to the character. Speaking of character, the walls are completely covered with an array of black and white pictures of \"Old Italy\" and what appears to be Italian family portraits. These pictures and memorabilia help create the Italian atmosphere.When my parents and I arrived, there was a huge line out the door due to a high school band competition in town. However, we were able to bypass the group and were seated in a room with its ceiling covered in wine bottles. Our waitress was friendly and graciously welcomed us and explained how Bucca's dinner offerings were family-style, meaning you order a few dishes to share with your table.We started off by ordering the mozzarella garlic bread and marinara sauce for an appetizer. My dad loved the chunks of fresh tomatoes, and the generous serving of bread allowed us to enjoy it as an appetizer and with our entrees. We ordered a small order (which serves two - three people) of the fettuccine Alfredo with grilled chicken and small order of the shrimp Florentine with garlic shrimp, roma tomatoes and spinach with linguine in a garlic butter sauce.Our food arrived fairly quickly and was absolutely delicious. As for the serving size, the three of us shared both entrees and still had plenty of leftovers. The fettuccine Alfredo need a little more chicken, especially for the $4 charge to add it.If you're looking for Italian food and/or an Italian vibe, definitely check out Buca di Peppo.

We ended up using Buca di Beppo for my rehearsal dinner at the suggestion of my sister-in-law, it was a place we could all agree upon that allowed for planned ahead reservations for a larger number. Let me start by saying the sales/booking process was great! They really have that down and take the group dining seriously. We first worked with a general sales person and then were eventually given a local sales contact for all other necessary questions and details. Stephanie at the local level was fantastic! She answered a lot of e-mails when my family brought up questions and helped us feel prepared going into it.My husband and I had to pick the menu since no one else would, haha, and it was tough as we had not been to any Buca's in some time. We tried to get ones that sounded like many different people would like.The day arrives and it is true that the entrance is strange and you will likely have to pay for parking (it is in the heart of downtown...) but we didn't care because we just wanted to relax and eat after the rehearsal.We get there and they won't let anyone sit until I show up since I booked it (whoops, some of my party had to wait a bit since I was the last to leave the wedding venue). But once we were there, everything went so smoothly. They took us to our area that was reserved, plenty of servers started taking drink orders (our head server was AWESOME, I wish I remembered his name) and bread and salads came quickly.I was very impressed with the flow of the meal, it was all fast but not too fast and they accommodated me wanting to surprise my brother-in-law with a small birthday cake since that day was his actual birthday and he had to spend it with me for my wedding. They made a big deal of it and let us serve cake, it was great.The food choices we had, from what I remember, were very good, sadly, I was suffering from the typical bridal nerves and didn't eat a ton but everything I did try was delicious. I actually got a lot of compliments from the guests. Especially the pesto chicken pasta and chocolate chip cannoli, mmmm. I also enjoyed a few glasses of sangria thanks to my man of honor, hehe.

A regular serving of ravioli barely fed my 7 and 12 year old and the meat sauce had huge chunks of \"crumbled\" ground beef. All the pasta dishes were bland - even the one we got when we ordered something else.

To top it off; now I'm a former waitress so I know a thing or two about serving and the culture if it but I was annoyed by the fact that my waitress received a $30 tip by default (our party was more than 6) and I feel like because she knew she was getting that automatically she didn't \u00a0take care of business.

There were 5 of us dining, and so we opted for a small salad and three small pasta dishes. One (the penne a la vodka) \u00a0was wrong, so we had to send that back. Once it came back, the seafood smell was overwhelming in the worst way possible. The Penne San Remo looked fantastic in the picture but had no flavor at all, despite the artichoke, chicken, and peas that you would think would do the trick. The lasagna was ok, but the end of it was clearly overcooked as evidenced by my rubbery noodle. On the bright side, they listened to our request to not have the birthday song sung for my mom, but by then we were very much over the bland food we had eaten. Plus, our quiet corner was infiltrated by a group of 12 teenagers who were really excited to yell at one another across the table. Yay.

We just got home from here Christmas Day 12-25-2014 we made a reservation through open table and when we got here we were seated immediately.

So we ordered drinks, and for some reason due to state laws or something they could not serve alcohol so thank god they had pepsi products or it would have been water for me. Anyway, they did offer a traditional ham or turkey meal with the traditional fixings for about $28 per person but we decided it was probably better to stick with the cuisine they normally prepare and we were not disappointed at all. We started out with the Mozzarella Bread which was very good. Then for entrees since they serve everything family style we ordered two things and I can assure you that we only needed one because we brought most of our food home with us. But we ordered the Fettuccine Supremo minus the red peppers and then we got a Biancaa white pizza with ricotta, fresh mozzarella, provolone, Parmesan, garlic, oregano and garlic-infused olive oil and we added chicken to it. that was probably the best pizza i have ever eaten. And then for dessert it took me a while to decided but I finally decided on the homemade cheesecake and it did not disappoint. We were only able to eat about half of it and I did not dare box the rest so we left it there. Service was decent. The manager did come by the table to see how our meal was. So two people set us back $80 well $100 with the gratuity.

My husband and I ate here last week for our company's holiday party, and we were incredibly disappointed. I had always heard about the plentiful food at Buca, and what we got was the complete opposite. Our table received our first round of drinks promptly, and I did get one refill on my soda. After that, our server completely forgot about drinks. I'd say we were probably all out of drinks by the time the salad course was done, and none of us got refills. So that was a a point against Buca already.The bread was delicious and thankfully it was plentiful, because that's pretty much what we had to fill ourselves up on. The two salads we received (it was \"family style\") were just ok. The lettuce was inexpensive iceberg that seemed a bit wet, which was disappointing, but there were some decent toppings on each. The real issue, though, were the \"main courses\". Our table had 6 people and they brought us (I kid you not) 1 plate with 8 ravioli on it and 1 plate with 6 small pieces of chicken. That's it. So each person was literally allotted 1 1/3 ravioli and the equivalent of about 1/2 of a chicken breast. And the ravioli wasn't even very good. We all agreed that it tasted about the same as Chef Boyardee (which, don't get me wrong, is yummy, but it's not what you expect at a restaurant). We begged our server for more food and we were able to get 1 more plate of ravioli, but we were told that we could only have more chicken if we waited half an hour or more, because \"management only prepares enough for each person\". So apparently, half a chicken breast is what Buca considers to be a serving size. None of us were close to full, so we were hoping that some of the famous Buca cheesecake would help to top us off. No luck there, either. The slices of cheesecake were (and again, I am not kidding here) about 3/4 of an inch wide at the top and equated to maybe 4-5 regular bites. And they were plain, with no garnish of any sort.Considering how much this meal cost per person, the amount of food provided was laughable. Well, it would have been laughable if we hadn't all been starving by that time. I would never, ever consider hosting an event here, given the poor attention paid to drinks and the pitifully small amount of food provided.

The large would feed a family of 4-5 people especially if you are ordering any sides like garlic bread which we did...yum!As we looked over the menu, the barback jokingly told us that there's only three bad things on the menu so we had pretty good odds of picking something good. He was correct as we ordered the Chicken Carbonara and it was excellent! We also ordered the garlic bread with cheese. Again, this was very tasty. The food came out fast and the service was prompt and friendly.

My father and I stopped in here on our first night in Indy because the place was very busy. When we sat down we decided to share the Chicken Glorioso which, according to the menu, is chicken with white wine, Alfredo sauce, artichoke hearts, and sun dried tomatoes. We also got an order of broccoli and an order of spaghetti with marinara sauce. After we placed our order we waited well over 30 minutes before we even saw our server again. To start, EVERYTHING is expensive, family style or not. There's no way I'm paying four bucks for a bread basket. the chicken was BLAND BLAND BLAND with one exception. It was COVERED in hot red pepper flakes (the kind you put on your pizza). It was so bad that it turned the sauce red and left the chicken so spicy that it was all we could taste. The broccoli was no better. It was covered in cheese and was still somehow completely lacking in any flavor at all. The spaghetti was ok, but their \"famous\" marinara sauce tasted no better than the Ragu they serve in my campus dining hall. All this, with slow service and Bennigans style crap covering the walls. It was clear to me that this place is just a glorified Olive Garden.

So I stood around for close to 10 minutes before I was helped.Then it was just some guy who came up behind me - mumbling to me that my food was in the bar.

It just felt a bit... dirty and felt like I was eating in a place that had not been updated since the 1970s. Food: 3/5 I thought the pricing was a tad expensive for what you got. I got the penne with Bolognese sauce dinner, which came with choice of soup or salad. The salad was essentially iceberg lettuce with a few measly cucumbers. House Italian dressing was just ok. And the pasta, although good, was not $15 worth of goodness. I did enjoy the choice of Italian sausage and meatballs - our waitress suggested getting one of each - the meat was the saving grace of the meal. Spicy and good. Overall, it was way too much food. I had leftovers for two meals. So, that was nice, but again, the food was just ok. Nothing special enough to write home about. Dessert: 5/5 Definitely was one of the better tiramisus I have had anywhere. Highly recommend that. I feel bad, but I question why this is one of the more loved Italian restaurants in Indianapolis.

Old world Italian hidden in a dive bar on College...those were my hopes. Instead I got weird cheese bread and watery spaghetti and meatballs.My coworker and I arrived at 5 o'clock on a Tuesday. We stepped into the establishment and walked toward the family dining area. There were some cool pictures on the wall in the dark hallway to the family dining. Once we reached the counter there was no one there to set us down and we waited a couple minutes. Once the hostess came out we were promptly seeded and asked for drink orders. We decided to get the garlic bread and the cheese bread for an appetizer. The bread comes in Texas toast style. The cheese bread was just a slice of cheese barely melted on top of the bread. It was not very tasty . For dinner I decided on the spaghetti and meatballs and my coworker decided on The fettuccine Alfredo and chicken. Dinner comes with a cup of minestrone soup and a salad. The minestrone soup was okay but had too many beans for my taste and the salad was simply average. When our dinner came it was beautifully plated. There were two huge meatballs in top of a mound of spaghetti (thin spaghetti, yay!) covered in a gorgeous red sauce. I thought this was it! This is why people love Iaria's so much. I was wrong. \u00a0To start off, the sauce isn't very flavorful at all and its very thin almost like a gravy. Then again \u00a0it could have been the puddle of spaghetti water at the bottom of the bowl mixing with the sauce that made it then, I just couldn't tell.

The summary for non-readers: In reading some of the reviews below, I don't think the negative reviewers really have a clue what real Italian is. I know true Italian. As in, I'm originally from Chicago with family mob ties and Italian blood. Iaria's is the only place in Indy to get that kind of authenticity. There is just no equal to Iaria's.So, the long version. The place has an old-world feel. Like a family diner right out of the 70's. In fact, knowing my family history, my GF kinda busted me when we sat down. They gave us the corner seat all the way in the back of the restaurant, so we were at a 45\u00b0 angle to each other, looking out w/ a full view of the place. I smiled a bit, and my girlfriend instantly smirked at me and said, \"You feel like the Don, don't you?\" Yep. I was in the Don's seat, able to see any rival wise-guys coming from a mile away. She knew what I was thinking right off the bat. ;-)Our server was great. I wish I could remember her name, because she was really attentive and helpful. We first ordered a half-decanter of Chianti (have to keep it authentic, right?) and the Calamari. I'm picky about Calamari, and there are few places to get good squid in Indy. This was one of the best. Very tender, just the right amount of breading and the breading stuck, unlike most places where it crumbles off and you're left with bare Calamari that won't hold the marinara. And the marinara: Oh my goodness, is it rich. Perfecto. Next came the bread and olive oil, also above average and very good. By the time we each got halfway through our gigantic appetizer salads, we could have stopped right there. But it kept getting better, and you don't eat Italian if you don't want to have to loosen your belt. Heck, I wanted to take mine off and throw it away once our main entree came. We asked to split the Bolognese, which comes with braised short-rib which is sooooo tender. Combined with the sweet, rich marinara. Mmmmmnnn. I've already used Perfecto, but there just isn't another descriptor that fits. When the server brought two huge bowls of it, I reminded her that we were splitting one order, and she just scoffed, knowingly stating, \"Yeah. That IS one order, split.\" I had the spicy sausage in mine and my GF had the meatballs. Both were also excellent. And there was so much, we each took home a \"small\" box, from which I personally ate from twice for lunch. There is just something about the Italian's and how much they expect you to eat. Mangia! Mangia!Lastly, as if we could really fit anything else, I just couldn't leave this place without trying their Canoli. It was worth the added pain to my belt-line. Wow, was this realy good. I've had some of the best, authentic Canoli there is, and this rivaled any of it. In fact, the entire meal from start to finish was as good Italian as I've ever had. I simply can't recommend this place enough. Loved every bite of it and can't wait to get back. But don't tell anyone else about it.

I was here with co-workers. \u00a0The good: it's local. Not a chain. \u00a0Has some history. The deserts were good. The bad: fried calamari was awful. \u00a0It was breaded like onion rings and complete mush. The red sauce was very very sweet. Good pasta sauce made with good tomatoes shouldn't need tons of sugar in it. \u00a0In fact, it shouldn't need any. I had the Veal Marsala. \u00a0The Veal was actually fine, and the sauce was also okay, but it was make with a sweet Marsala. \u00a0The downside was it was smothered with canned mushrooms. \u00a0The decor inside the bar area has neon lighting that was clearly added in the 80s and really the whole place desperately needs a complete update. \u00a0If this was a NJ rest I would give 1 star, but given where this place is, I give it an \"Meh\" rating."], ["Aja B.", "How have I lived in Indy for 15 years and have not eaten at Iaria's?!

We sat at a table in the bar and were quickly greeted by our server, Julie. \u00a0She was amazing! She was very knowledgeable on the wine list and made excellent suggestions for dinner. We ordered fried ravioli, but next time will get the mozzarella appetizer. I had the chicken marsala, my boyfriend has the tortellini, and my mom had the spaghetti and meatballs (all recommendations from our server). Wow! Everything was amazing. The creamy tomatoe sauce on the tortellini was delicious and I look forward to trying the spicy vodka sauce next time.

I always seem to gravitate to the chicken Marsala, last night was no different. Be sure to request the Marsala sauce on your pasta side. Two chicken cutlets, covered in a hearty Marsala sauce and tons of mushrooms, and a bowl of pasta were delicious. You can order just the entree or get the meal which includes minestrone soup and a salad. I always ordered their homemade Roquefort dressing, if you like blue cheese dressing, order it it's worth the extra $1. We ordered a tiramisu to go and split it at home. That's the only way I could have dessert, as I was stuffed! \u00a0 I'm only going to review what we ate last night, but everything I've ordered in the past has been yummy. \u00a0This place reminds me of the old neighborhood Italian restaurants back east.

Great place conveniently located near downtown with a retro Italian ambiance."], ["Andrea F.", "This place was well recommended to us by some locals so surprised - it really didn't live up the hype. It was decent and I liked the tacky decor but didn't think it was anything special and didn't get it.(1) Atmosphere felt really old - painted cinder block walls? ugly cheap drop ceiling? yeah, there's quaint and there's just old. (2) Sugary marinara. Just calling them out, it tasted like they added regular sugar to the recipe, much too sweet! It needs some acid stat. But I will give them that the minestrone, salad, and bread were terrific.(2) Wine was old. The chianti carafe was warmer than room temperature and tasted vinegary - like it had been exposed to air too long. (3) Service poor. The waitress never asked us how the wine or any of the food was, so we had no opportunity to let her try to fix it. Also the high school kids wandering around picking up plates after you finished were really aggressive, I felt pressured to guard my plate as they would come up and ask, interrupting your conversation, while still holding the fork in my hand. lolThis probably has a lot of nostalgia for locals, but for being from out of town I really didn't get the hype. Not sure if just an off night, but disappointed as we love Italian but are maybe used to NYC and Chicago style for good Italian food but my Italian grandmother would never forgive serving wine that had turned and sugary marinara sauce. But if you want a cheap Italian place it probably fits the bill and definitely more original than Olive Garden."], ["Jessica P.", "The food is pretty good but the overall experience wasn't the best.

Arrived to find a very crowded place on a Saturday night and was concerned about how things would go. No worries. Fortunately, we had a reservation and were seated immediately and quickly greeted by our server. Wine and cocktails were on the table in minutes. The menu is broad and traditional but everything we were served was great. The Grouper Piccata was outstanding. Perfectly prepared and very tasty - get the capers with it if you order it. At so many restaurants, if you order a side of vegetables instead of a starch, you get bland or boring. Here, the veggie side was very good - a nice variety well seasoned. That is not to say starch was not involved in this meal. I could not resist trying some pasta with red sauce to check out the sauce. The pasta was nicely done al dente and I really like the red sauce. It tends toward a traditional Italian \"gravy\" prepared at home by many - not a light type, but good. A tip if you would like a quiet adult evening - eat in the bar. The only downside to the evening involved parents of several children who don't know how to behave in a restaurant. Allowing children to run around freely, jumping into and out of empty booths, screaming, etc. is doing them no favors. Overall, a great evening despite the distractions."], ["Rex S.", "I only eat here about once every 10 years and last nights service was horrible. The food was good and for the price was fair. The issue was the horrible service and the mandated 20% gratuity which should have been no more than 10%. I arrived 10 minutes late and my group still had not had their orders taken (so worked out for me there). My table was kind of full I stood at the head if the table and bus and wait staff looked at me like an alien. No one ever welcomed me or asked asked if I needed a chair and in 10 minutes I finally grabbed one on my own from another table. That is finally when I got some attention and got the what the hell do you think your doing here stare from some of the staff. \u00a0By this time while my table had drinks, still no server to take an order. By about 30 minutes our server made an appearance. \u00a0We got our order in ok. However, I was not offered a beverage. \u00a0I had to ask a bus to get me a beverage. \u00a0The busser should have been the server. Throughout the process we had to ask several times for water refills. 3 of us got our salads that were forgotten LONG after our meals. They could have sold about 8 more beers than they did if our server would have just showed up from to check in on us. No plates offered for the pizza. Some used napkins. Some used their old dirty appetizer plates. After the pizza was half gone and we grabbed a busser we got plates for the pizza. \u00a0We joked at one point that we were part of a reality show. \u00a0I could go on and on about this experience. Anyhow, the food was decent. I appreciate this place has been in business so long and family operated. I really wish the service was better. \u00a0What really burned me and being in the service industry myself a tip should always be left and amount relative to the service but a 20% mandated tip for that service was unacceptable. \u00a0It kind of made sense after we noticed that, the poor service and I don't care attitude of the server. \u00a0We might have complained if there was a manager presence.Iarea's I will try again soon. I hope the service is better next time. I'd really like to see your 100+ year old business go a 100+ more."], ["Simon M.", "An Indianapolis institution. A great Italian restaurant with an ambiance that makes it fun. There is a dinning room and a separate bar area. We ate in the bar. Our server was efficient and very knowledgeable about the menu but she did not have time for any chitchat, although friendly enough. One thing I love here is the marinara sauce. It is very flavorful, with a slightly sweet taste. We had the Margherita pizza and really liked it. A real pizza! Also a carafe of the house Cabernet Sauvignon at $24. A good price and decent taste. One funny thing. When we asked about the side salad we were told \"lettuce, two cherry tomatoes and two cucumber slices\", no croutons, no cheese. Only $3 but pretty basic. It's pretty noisy, with the bar area being less so. It's that type of restaurant. Family owned with lots of history and lots of regulars. We love it!.

For example, the menu touts their shrimp cocktail as having five large shrimp for $9.99. I was game -- and ended up completely disappointed. The shrimp were not large. Not at all - one bite and done. At $2 a shrimp, it was more than disappointing - it seemed downright misleading. My Jr. Antipasto was good. My wife was disappointed with her chicken fettuccine. At $16.99, we expected a larger portion and more flavor. There wasn't that much chicken, and my wife said the pasta and sauce tasted bland. She also ordered garlic cheese bread - clearly ordered for herself - and the waitress didn't ask if she wanted the 4-piece or 8-piece bread, instead just bringing the 8-piece. At the very least, wait staff should ask rather than just bringing out the more expensive option. The bread itself has so much butter on it that the cheese fell off - the bread seemed like it had been under a warmer - the cheese wasn't gooey at all, just a semi-solid rectangle that pulled off when bitten into. \u00a0In the end, we had two soft drinks, one cocktail drink, an order of garlic cheese bread, a shrimp cocktail, a salad, and an order of fettuccine with chicken at a cost of $59 and some change.

The minestrone soup was bland but the house dressing on the salad was pretty good. I had the meat ravioli with Bolognese sauce. The sauce was incredible.

Not the best Italian I'd ever had, but a notch above chain Italian joints around town. The most noteworthy part of the meal was the Roquefort dressing for me. The fried ravioli was also very good, and I enjoyed my chicken parm.My wife, however, hated the place for the same reason she hates most Italian in Indiana: the sauce. The sauce has either nutmeg or cinnamon in it, which to my wife is tantamount to coming over to our house and kicking our dog. She kept referring to her lasagna as \"pumpkin pie\", and it was definitely an overly sweet sauce.The funny thing is that the fried ravioli came with a completely different sauce, and while still on the sweet side, was light years better than the regular sauce served on the chicken parm or lasagna.I pointed out to my wife that they were fourth-generation Italian, so maybe the cuisine was just from a different part of Italy, to which she replied \"they've been in America too long.\"In the end, I'll never get my wife back into the place unless they hang a big banner outside saying \"New Sauce! No Nutmeg!\" I might go back for lunch or something with other folks, and not tell her about it, though.(But, again, I come from a state that thinks Pizza King pizza is actually *good*.)"], ["Bill J.", "Exactly what everyone needs....ANOTHER review of Iaria's.I'm going to write one, just because I care. \u00a0I'm that kind of guy. \u00a0Really.Major bonus points for the history of Iaria's...makes you feel like you're dining someplace sorta special. \u00a0More bonus points for being locally owned and family owned.But the real reason I am writing this is to say that I really enjoy their pizza.

Everything here is so damn good. Which led to one downside...we couldn't get a table until 7:30 and I was starving. I mean, chew my arm off hungry. But rest assured none of us left here hungry. Actually, I thought Maggiano's was a local restaurant in Cincinnati. Guess it's a chain. But what a chain it is if you love Italian food. Prices are reasonable, and they have the same deal...buy one pasta, get one to go for free. Why am I always traveling so carryout does me no good? One of these days I'll head to Cincinnati and take a cooler.Anyhoo...I had lobster marina and it was divine with great big hunks of lobster. And large. Hungry as I was I couldn't finish it.

One of the chefs even came out to greet us with a delicious little appetizer and asked us if we had any questions about the menu. The meal was an indulgence of scrumptious Italian food. I am so happy we chose to come here and we will definitely be returning. I felt so spoiled the whole time and the memories it gave my boyfriend and I are forever cherished.

We noted this to the waiter and my fiance did not eat any of her pasta dish after the first bite. The server took it back and took it off the bill very nice of them but she didn't eat so still sad.

We reviewed the family menu ahead of time so that the process would be more efficient. We arrived about 5 min early and the hostess informed me our table was being prepared. 25 min later we were seated. We informed the waiter that we were ordering family style and that the men were each paying for 2 people and I was paying for 3. We told him we wanted to order drinks and 1 member offered to buy the pre dinner drinks. I summoned the waiter and gave him our written order of 3 appetizer/ salad, 4 Entries, and 2 deserts. Waiter disappears,then comes back to take drink orders. Now several servers appear with 6 platters of food and salad to which they proceed to jam on our tight close seating arrangement. \u00a0We proceed to eat, still no drinks, food by now 3/4 consumed,some of the wine arrives. Waiter informs me that my drink and 2 others are coming right out. He appears with the cocktails accompanied by servers with 12 platters of entries. The table is now loaded with dirty appetizer dishes, partially empty platters and the servers trying to dump additional platters on the table. Our party picked up and held dirty dishes so room was made for the entries. I complained to the waiter and a \"Manager \" appeared. \u00a0He said \" I was told you wanted to see me\". I informed him that the pace, speed, and confusion has totally destroyed the dining experience supposed to be ( a Italian family style ) not a slopping of the \"HOGS\". He replied that he was sorry( not very convincing) and blamed it on a new computer system in the kitchen. Then he said he would be back to check on us. HE NEVER CAME BACK We come to Indy yearly for a cousins reunion and although I am a loyal supporter for the Nashville Maggiano , we probably will not be back. Our aggregate tab was over $500. \u00a0 In conclusion my opinion is starting with superficial management and a untrained waiter what could have been a great dining experience was a disaster salvaged only by good food. \u00a0CAVEAT EMPTOR !!!"], ["Ashley P.", "This place goes above and beyond.

Their family style meals are a steal price wise and portion wise. They also do refills on the items, this is AWESOME for families and parties. They have a full bar and are not stingy with the liquor at all as the drinks are pretty stiff. Their portions will really make you sit and think for a while before you can begin to attempt to make a move to your car to drive to your next destination, you may even have to take a nap at the table. The service is fast even on a busy night and they are very friendly. In regards to catering they are excellent in that aspect as well. The food is top knotch, they provide nice containers and serving utensils and provide enough sauces and things to make sure that you do not run out. I would recommend them for a corporate luncheon, \u00a0dinner, or a wedding rehearsal dinner."], ["Colin R.", "First the good news. \u00a0The food was exceptionally good. \u00a0We went on a Monday evening at 630pm and there was only a five minute wait. \u00a0I had been to Maggiano's many times but not in the past two-three years and the other two people with me had never been there. \u00a0We were celebrating a birthday so I suggested Maggiano's because the food was so good.Now the not so good news. \u00a0Our waiter was really inexperienced and it would be classified as poor service even at a Denny's. \u00a0I don't blame him so much as I blame management for putting him out there on his own too soon (I'm assuming he is new).He took our order fine or so we thought. \u00a0We had the Tomato Caprese appetizer, two Maggiano salads, two Mushroom Ravioli al Fornos, one baked ziti with gluten free pasta. \u00a0The waiter was cafeful to ask if it was a preference or an allergy. \u00a0He explained something to the effect that if it were just a preference he could take the order like that but if it were an allergy the chef would come out to make sure it would be perfect. \u00a0This was a nice touch and in keeping with the level of service one expects from this restaurant. \u00a0The Caprese was brought out soon enough and was delicious. \u00a0The bread was served a bit after that and was very good. \u00a0While we were waiting for our salads, we noticed there was a dark flake in the parmesan cheese at the table. \u00a0It kinda looked like a small dead bug but on closer inspection it looked like a burnt crumb of some sort. I gave it to the waiter and asked for it to be replaced. \u00a0About 15 minutes had transpired since we placed our order when the waiter came to tell us that the ziti could not be made gluten free and asked if we wanted something else that could be made gluten free. \u00a0We asked about the gnocchi since it was a potato base and he didn't realize what we were talking about. \u00a0So we said gnocchi and even pronounced it like \"no-chee\" and he still didn't understand what we were talking about. \u00a0He brought the chef out and he was able to answer any questions we had. \u00a0We were pretty disappointed that it took 15 minutes to figure out that ziti couldn't be made gluten free but thankfully they brought out the replacement very quickly along with the Mushroom Raviolis we ordered. \u00a0We told him to cancel the salads since they hadn't arrived prior to the entrees. \u00a0There was an assistant manager with him when the food was dropped off and she apologized and assured us that the salads would be removed from the bill and to make up for it they would comp us a dessert of our choice. \u00a0While my fiancee was drinking wine, I ordered a coke which I finished just as the entrees arrived. \u00a0Not once was I asked if I wanted a refill or, like most places, I was just brought one. \u00a0About halfway through our entrees we finally got a replacement parmesan cheese container. \u00a0We asked for more bread and the waiter told us \"We don't have any. \u00a0I'm not lying\". \u00a0Five minutes later he brought out bread and said, \"Be careful, it's REALLY hot and just from the oven\". \u00a0It was just warm. \u00a0The assistant manager came by and asked if everything was \"wonderful\" and we begrudgingly said yes because I didn't want to make a scene. \u00a0He asked if we wanted any dessert and didn't see to be in the loop about the comped dessert so we ordered tiramisu. \u00a0When he brought out the bill he pointed out they had comped the \"gluten free\" ziti's replacement as well as took 25% off the bill and we weren't charged for the dessert. \u00a0He apologized for the problems and the last thing he said was \"the kitchen has some problems tonight\". \u00a0That was the icing on the cake. \u00a0The kitchen doesn't refill cokes, replace parmesan cheeses, not know the menu, or forget to follow up on salads. \u00a0As good as the food was, the poor service (even despite the discount) really soured the evening. \u00a0Again, I don't blame the waiter. \u00a0He clearly had to be new and was in over his head. He seems like a charming guy who could grow into being a really good waiter. \u00a0I gave him a $15 tip despite the urging from the others in my party to stiff him because I used to be a waiter too. \u00a0I know the management reads these and I hope they address this issues as there are many. \u00a0If I ever get the urge to eat Maggiano's food it will have to be carryout. \u00a0 If anything, this experience makes me not question my eating at mom and pop restaurants in lieu of the big chains over the past few years. \u00a0I can't remember ever having sub-standard service in a similarly priced mom and pop restaurant."], ["Tom B.", "As soon as we arrived at our table, there was a huge spider crawling around. \u00a0We trapped it inside a water glass and handed it over to our server. \u00a0I'm not counting that against the restaurant - I'm surprised it doesn't happen more often. \u00a0Then, she forgot my salad completely, but it made its way to the final bill. \u00a0Fortunately, the quality of the food saved the day. \u00a0Note to Management: \u00a0Your restaurant is extremely large, with enough space to comfortably seat a small army. \u00a0Why, then, do you feel the need to cram all of your patrons into the same tiny area of the restaurant? \u00a0I didn't order sardines, but I felt like one. \u00a0Just sayin' ..."], ["Gyamfua G.", "It's a wonderful thing family style. .and today with my girlfriends this was the perfect spot.

The restaurant itself is large. The main dining room is very bright and there is a mixture of free standing tables with chairs and booths. The noise level can get extremely loud at times, so if you are looking for a quite dinner, this might not be your best optionI would highly recommend getting a reservation, especially during the weekend, as you could expect to wait awhile. One alternative is to sit in the bar and eat if available, but that can be hit and miss, especially during busy times. \u00a0Parking can be a hassle here as well. The restaurant lot can get full and you may have to park across in the mall parking lot, which is just a few feet away from the actual parking lot . Another parking option is their valet service, which happens to be free, as always tips not expected but appreciated. The prices on the menu may seem like a sticker shock to some, especially the specialties, but it is on par with other restaurants in the area. If your looking to save some money, they do have a 2 for $40 meal that includes an appetizer or 2 soups or 2 salads; 2 entree pastas, and one desert option. There is also an option to order one of the basic pasta and take home another basic pasta for $15 after taxes (tip not included). I like Magginao's because it is a great option for gluten free pasta, which is penne. I do like that Maggiano's has one of its chefs come out to the table to take your order and discuss the menu with you if it is needed. This is done with any food allergies. Just make sure you make your server aware.The amount of food, especially pasta, is enough for two meals, thus left overs might normally accompany you home. One of my go to dishes is the Chef KB's Lobster Carbonara. You do get a lot of lobster with this dish. Is it the best lobster that you can every have, no, but it accompanies the pasta well. Overall, Maggiano's consistantly provides good service and a filling meal and is a good option for dinner."], ["Rebecca E.", "One of the restaurants that I know I can count on to be of good quality with great service. I eat here way more often then I should, but it's just that good. I usually get the Mushroom Ravioli al Forno and Creme Brulee and I have never been disappointed in my meal. The Creme Brulee is up there with some of the best I have ever had."], ["Laura O.", "They did great with a big group of us! \u00a0Friendly service and they even threw in an extra dessert for us! \u00a0Favorite dishes were the spinach and artichoke dip, shrimp diablo, white clam sauce with linguine, and the warm apple crostada!"], ["Yebin M.", "Pretty solid lunch yesterday and the candy bacon bruchetta was awesome. \u00a0Great server who was very personable. \u00a0The wood railing was pretty gross as it hadn't been dusted or cleaned in some time.

We were meeting with multiple family members that were unable to attend the earlier gathering in South Bend, so we had a large party of eight adults and two children. We made a reservation for this Sunday evening dinner and they seated us once the whole party was there. It was fairly busy when we first arrived, but the restaurant cleared out over the course of our meal. Of course, we ended up being there for two hours, so that makes sense. It really should not have taken as long as it did, but it seems we had a newer waiter, but I will talk about that a little more later.The restaurant itself is large and very nicely decorated. Like very a homey Italian restaurant but more high-end than usual, if that makes any sense. They have a special deal where everyone pays one price per person for a meal and it is served family-style. They were even nice enough to allow a couple of people from our party to order seperately from the family-style meal. The family style meals come in different price points offering more options. The meal that the majority of our table went with included two or three appetizers, three entrees and two desserts. It ended up being way more food than any of us could finish and my sister-in-law and her boyfriend ended up with leftovers for days since we were flying home the next day. Our server was nice enough, but like I said before, we waited a very long time for each of our courses. One of my husband's family members is pretty assertive and after nearly two hours and we still did not have our desserts, she went and raised a ruckus. To be honest, I usually have a lighter touch when I complain about things, but I have to hand it to the management at Maggiano's, they handled it very affably and were very apologetic. Things speeded up considerably after that and I believe they took some things off the bill. Most importantly, all of the food was delicious. We tried to do mostly vegetarian dishes, since my sister-in-law doesn't eat meat. The standout for me was the fried zuchinni, which was thin sliced lengthwise and fried crisp with a tasty dipping sauce. My kids loved the spaghetti and meatballs. Everything was Italian American comfort food, but with a slightly upscale twist. The slow service probably rates this as more of a three and a half star, but I will grant the extra half star for the very friendly and responsive management follow-up to the issues."], ["LaLa T.", "I've heard rave reviews about Maggiano's food but I wasn't impressed. I started off with the calamari that had a very thick breading and tasted like it had been cooked in chicken grease. I opted for the fettuccine alfredo for my main course and it was okay, it lacked seasoning. We also got the chocolate cake which looks are deceiving, the cake looked rich, moist and flavorful and to my disappointed it lacked flavor. Our server was attentive and I enjoyed the white sangria. I will probably not be back to Maggiano's for the food but will go during happy hour."], ["Derrick M.", "I really adore Maggiano's. \u00a0I have gone multiple times and do one of two things. \u00a0The most frequent outing option is to go with a party of four or more and we get the family style italian dinners (choose starters, entrees, deserts, etc.). \u00a0These are the best. \u00a0It is pricey but absolutely delicious and we leave miserably happy....yes - so full that we are uncomfortable and yet so thrilled that everything was so delicious and service was so good. \u00a0That's right - service and food are both excellent every time! \u00a0This option is totally a birthday or other celebration must.The other outing option we do is less than four people and we order the buy one-take one home pastas. \u00a0A good value and decent food. \u00a0A much better choice if you are budget spending! \u00a0Ask the server about which pastas are better when you are deciding (no matter which of the above options you go with), they are usually very helpful and we are always happy with our choices when we do this. \u00a0Wine and cocktails can add some significant punch to the check so discuss with your server your best options if you are on a budget. \u00a0This is the only complaint I have about the place but it's a pretty standard restaurant markup generally - maybe a little above average.I can never wait to go back and if the family style option was available for two and was also less pricey (I say that only because my budget holds me back - not because it's not worth it) I would be getting it all the time :)."], ["Rita G.", "We took a party of eight on September 11th 2015 with friends and family from out of state the waiter was not experienced enough to handle a party of eight the food orders were mixed up we ordered our desserts and waited 30 minutes to receive it we spoke with the manager twice and got it I'm sorry we spent nearly $300 our experience was not a good one thank you"], ["Faryal K.", "I was unfortunately disappointed with my visit.

Maggiano's fits the bill though, and it's the place I've picked for my luncheon for three years running now.First, let's talk about the private dining room. Fantastic! 6 tables of 10 easily fit in two of the rooms to hold my group, and being separate from the rest of the place, people are free to walk around and chat with one another throughout the meal. We do a gift exchange, and there's plenty of room inside to eat, walk around, have a table for a fairly large gift exchange, and also a bar area.Second, the food. We plan ahead and vote on the menu beforehand (3 appetizers/salads, 3 main entrees, 2 desserts) and it's always freshly prepared and ready to go when we get there. Even better: it's family style, so everyone always gets plenty to eat, and anyone wanting leftovers always gets some. This year, we chose the stuffed mushrooms, spinach and artichoke dip and Maggiano's Salad for our first course. Second course was tilapia, lasagna and spinach and chicken manicotti. Dessert was Tiramisu and New York style cheesecake. Yeah, we ate a lot, and it was fantastic!Finally, the staff that took care of our event was phenomenal. As the host, my job was made extremely easy because of the A+ team that we had taking care of us. When I asked for something, it was immediately taken care of. I asked that they move some of the tables around before the event started, and it was done immediately. Wireless microphone? No problem. Off-the-menu bottle of wine?

We had reservations for 3:15, and arrived a little early but we were seated by 3:20 which was great.We ordered the two for $39.95 special. This includes two entrees from a special selection and a salad of your choosing and one dessert to share. The plus side is you get to select an entree to take home. I had the Mom's Lasagna and my son had the Alfredo and added chicken. Both were very good. We both had Caesar salads, the lettuce was kinda of wilted and not very flavorful, but when speaking with our server she was gracious enough joy allow is to switch the salad out for an appetizer which we ended up getting mozzarella sticks which were huge and flavorful.With the dessert we were only allowed one to share which was fine. We selected the New York Style Cheesecake. We took it to go because we were stuffed. But the piece that are server gave us was gigantic. We were able to cut it down the middle and had two regular size portions.The overall service was great on a day that was really busy. Our server was very attentive. The atmosphere is lively. Because of the set up in the restaurant it can get pretty loud so if you are looking for an intimate setting this is not the place.I have been here several times before and have never had a bad experience.

I will be back again in the near future."], ["Sarah F.", "Came here with a work group and they accommodated our large group fairly well. We ordered from the family style menu (which large parties over 10 are asked to do) for the group, which is a pretty good deal. For the salad/appetizer course, we went with Ceasar Salad, calamari, and bruschetta. The calamari and bruschetta were both OK, nothing memorable (didn't get to try the salad). For the main course, the table ordered eggplant parm, lasagna, chicken & spinach manicotti, and fettuccine alfredo. All of those are massively heavy and after a few bites of the manicotti and eggplant parm, I was finished. The manicotti is in a super-rich, gloopy cream sauce and the tomato sauce on the parm was so overcooked, it actually lost all tomato flavor. For dessert, cheesecake and tiramisu. The tiramisu was forgettable, but the cheesecake was surprisingly good--rich, but fluffy, not heavy. Can't recommend this place, but if you find yourself there, maybe try to fill up on appetizers and dessert and skip the entrees."], ["Sharyl S.", "Had a family birthday dinner for 32 - tons of food, good service, nice staff. \u00a0Great event staff, very accommodating to special dietary requests. \u00a0Planning an event, give them a try."], ["Andrew G.", "Really awesome atmosphere.

The valet should be using a far away remote lot. Please change how your valet system works, it's outrageous that we can't park close to the front door without using the valet."], ["Michael K.", "Some of the best Italian food in Indy.

The lasagna is always absolutely delicious and the deal of eating an entree there and taking one home is a complete steal.

The food was amazing and although the host guy was a bit rude, the servers made up for it. The cool thing was they offer not only a full on traditional version of their dishes, but right under it on most of them they have a lite version. So you can still enjoy the dishes you love, but feel less guilty. Also they have a menu that allows you to order a meal and then get s meal to go with it. So you have built in left overs. It's pretty nice for covering the next day's lunch. I recommend the Chicken Picatta, the Chicken Marsala, and the stuffed mushrooms. Also for dessert there tiramisu is very delicious."], ["Chowdry P.", "Just had an awesome Thanksgiving dinners at Maggianos, beats 12 hours of cooking, have enough left overs for 3 days, nice juicy turkey, decent hame, apple crostada, and tiramisu to die for"], ["Linda M.", "I tried their stuffed mushrooms with spinach, garlic, and seasoned breadcrumbs. \u00a0Delicious and healthy. \u00a0Complimentary bread was good too! \u00a0Spacious bar and lounge area with TVs. \u00a0Mint was chocolaty!Awesome and free (with coupon)!"], ["Sarah P.", "I've eaten approximately a million times here. Service heavily depends on which server you get. Good and bad. Beware of Friday and Saturday nights - wait times for tables and food go up. For an appetizer I'd recommend the spinach and artichoke al forno. If you're there for lunch, get a sandwich. They are all wonderful. Standouts are the salmon sandwich and the grilled steak. Very filling and delicious. Best pasta dish is the rigatoni D by far. Enough for two. Of the chicken - the lighter take chicken parm is even better than the original. Get the chicken francese. The lighter take version comes with wide, handcut pappardelle pasta. The salmon with lemon and herbs over orzo pasta is the best fish dish. The beef tenderloin medallions are very good. When in doubt, ask your server what their favorite meal is."], ["Alison Y.", "Always love Maggiano's for their ambinace, food, and the fact that it's a large enough chain to escape too much of a wait.I made reservation through opentable for Saturday night and we had no problem getting a table for 6 during prime dinner time at 6:30pm. Our server was gracious, attentive without being too much like a hawk, and our family \u00a0had a wonderful meal.Firstly, their bread is always so delicious! Nice and crisp on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. We all shared the chopped salad, shrimp scampi, lobster carbonara, and chicken francese. Chopped salad was light with a slightly sweet vinagrette. Shrimp scampi came with a very generous serving of shrimp and a delicious lemon garlic butter sauce. Lobster carbonara was a favorite of ours with a nice creamy parmesan sauce and huge chunks of crab. The chicken francese was probably the most plain of our dishes - 2 large chicken fillets with lemon butter sauce and crisp potatoes. Always a great place to go with large groups where you want to share entrees with a nice ambiance. Much better family style restaurant chain than Buca Di \u00a0Beppos."], ["Mike L.", "Maggiano's little Italy serves pretty good Italian food, but unfortunately it is not to my taste. I ordered the linguine de mare, which is a huge bowl of mussels, scallops, shrimp, lobster and pasta. However, the whole thing is too salty that I had to keep drinking water, which filled me in even quicker. However, I've had some other entr\u00e9es another time and they were pretty good.

We ordered an appetizer and then our meals. My salad came out first, after we asked about getting some bread to the table, which I would think was an automatic. Before I finished my salad, the entrees came out. Once the server came back to the table, I asked her about the appetizer. She apologized and ran and got it. She did comp it, but it was an odd experience for this type of restaurant. While eating, we never saw her. My wife's diet coke was never refilled and my water was the same way. After we finished, our dirty dishes sat on the table for at least 15 minutes before another server noticed and she apologized for them sitting there. We then waited to ask about a dessert menu and a person cleaning up a table behind us noticed and asked if we were waiting on our server. Finally, the server showed up and to our surprise she gave us the check!! \u00a0Nothing else was needing to be said. I paid with cash and we left. The food was awesome. We really enjoyed it.

Then the manager came over and said that they would comp our entire check AND told us to order a dessert. The second time we were there it wasn't busy and yet we were sat at a table crammed into a small space on a main walkway. We asked to be moved, which wasn't a problem and had a pleasant dinner.

Second thing is the food. $4.95 for a bowl of Caesar salad? Uh it was not a huge salad for that price. Then the meal. Sure it was decent but $16 for 4 ravioli's is a bit steep. You get to take home a small portion of \"something else\" but I was still kind of hungry right then. \u00a0 \u00a0 So IMO it's really over priced for what you get.

Great surroundings. Above-average service. Tasty recipes. A few negatives to expect: 1) Seating is not their strong suit, even with a reservation. 2) You will pay top dollar for the nice decor, ample staffing and quality food. 3) Not all Maggiano's servers are created equal, so identify one who gives good service and request them. $50 w/o tip ($60 total) for two chicken picatta dinners (no soup or salad... just chicken breasts and a small bowl of angel-hair pasta), one drink and one Diet Coke is a bit salty even for the Keystone @ the Crossing area.

It was a Monday night, so I'm sure it wasn't near as busy as usual however it was fairly full. We were seated right away, although the seating was a bit odd to me as we were seated in a booth seat with a couple only about a foot and a half away from us. I had to squeeze between the tables and felt oddly close to the man next to me. Thankfully, they were done with there meal and were about to leave. That was the only negative thing about our experience! Our waitress (I think her name was Kelly) was great! She answered every question we had and explained what different meals were and gave us her recommendations. Our bread and drinks were brought to us very quickly. Kelly made her appearances to our table throughout our meal to make sure we were alright and give us refills on out water and to get us more drinks, but she wasn't overly attentive like some waiters can be when they pop up every few minutes. Every worker we came into contact with was very personable, nice, and helpful. We loved the food but I left and kept thinking about how GREAT the people were! My fianc\u00e9 was drinking Bud Light and the man that brought his second drink cracked a joke and stood at our table for a few minutes talking to us. Another waiter that was walking by was smiling and singing to himself, to others that might have been a turn-off or unprofessional, but I loved it! He was happy and enjoying himself and I'd much rather like to see that than unhappy, frustrated workers!

Greeted with a, \"HI guys\"-insert eye roll and sigh from my subconscious. I state my first and last name very clearly and he responds by saying \"we will seat you here in a second Trevor.\" Who the heck is Trevor? Okay minor faux pas, I can overlook this, making phone reservations can sometimes be difficult. Another couple behind us checks in.Mr. Hot Shot Big Man on Campus Manger guy after about 5 minutes says he is ready to seat us-or so I think he is kind of staring off into space. There is confusion between us and the other couple and we ask who are you ready seat. \"Who ever wants to follow me.\" Hopefully this lack of leadership is not an insight into how you manage your restaurant...but fearfully I can only assume so as he seats the other couple first. We follow the hostess and she shows us to a table right on the other side of a server side stand at a table that my wife gives me a knowing look that can only say, \"Really, the restaurant is empty and you decide to seat us here.\" I couldn't agree more. We are greeted by our server who mumbles a greeting and asks my wife, \"Uh, could I see your glass.\" As he fills it up with water. Agreed there are some tables in restaurants that make in darn near impossible to fill a water glass but c'mon! Everything that Maggiano's ambiance is supposed to be has already been broken. Server Dude lacks enthusiasm about his presentation of any of the house specialties and really does anything but inspiring confidence in your guests.A server from another section interrupts our appetizers with a, \"Are you all, going to be using this chair\" indicating the one next to my wife (the sat us at a 4 top). We shake our heads and she takes it to the table across from us--keep in mind the section we are sitting in has plenty of other available seats.And around the corner comes clueless hostess how has the bright idea of seating a fussy baby right next to the married couple that is very clearly on a date....BRILLIANT! Goodness what does it take to use a little common sense when seating?Later that same server from the other section is heard in the background making negative comments about the people she works with...thank you to the close proximity of the hostess stand...wonderful! Later we witness her wandering around like a bored puppy staring out the window making comments about the weather. The food was rather uninspiring. Tomato Caprese-tomatoes were flavorless, balsamic has a good smoky flavor and the basil not so good. The pastas were okay. The Pomegranate Martini was sugary and too sweet.Our Server dude did sell us on the Berry Tiramisu, sealing the deal with the, \"Everyone who has ever tried this has loved it, I have not met anyone who didn't\" We took it home because by now the ambiance was shattered and beyond repair. \u00a0Once home we thought that the Tiramisu was uninspiring, a boring vanilla. I see where they thought that the coffee might clash with the sweet ripeness of berries so they took it completely out leaving the Tiramisu a soggy vanilla cake.It's just sad because this used to be my wife's favorite Italian date night spot, and not even because the food was breath taking but because the service and ambiance was rustic romantic and cozy.

Vito's big salad bowl is delicious and tasty on par with anything else that I've had with the exception that they don't have olives in the salad. The garlic bread is in little loaves. The only reason it's not a five star is that the place has been around forever and kind of shows it's age in places but this has no impact on the quality of the food or the service but it could probably use a deep deep cleaning from top to bottom.

It is a very small place, with a nice ambiance. I ordered the Seafood Alfredo with a salad and he ordered the Spinach Tortellini with bacon potato soup. He also requested that the chef add some ham to his tortellini. He loved the soup, it was gone in seconds. He really liked the tortellini a lot as well, and it was nice of whoever was in the kitchen to allow his request. I thought the Seafood Alfredo was okay. I think it was a little salty, and kind of boring- it was noodles with a few shrimp and some imitation crab. It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't recommend it personally. The salad was great. For dessert i had a slice of tiramisu and he had something I can't remember the name of- ice cream rolled in hazelnut powder. I liked mine, but I would have preferred it without the overwhelming chocolate sauce. I thought his ice cream was good, but he thought it was boring \"it just tasted like ice cream\"A couple at the table next to us complained about their meals as soon as the waitress was gone they said they hated the pizza and she made better Marsala at home. I can't say whether this is true or not because I didn't taste either. OVERALL:Overall the food is mediocre and a little overpriced. Don't go with high end expectations.

Yes, the strip mall is a little run-down, but this is the original location [per their website there used to be another one]. I've been here with a large group reservation, as well as walk-in with just 3 of us. Both times we've not had any issues. Service has been great, the food has been even better. Almost every meal comes with a soup or salad - I'd recommend a salad with one of their house dressings - creamy Italian, ranch, or honey mustard poppyseed. It's not a big salad, but it's a good start. Also gotta give props to the homemade garlic bread. If you're really hungry, they'll continue giving you refills [good enough for dipping into the dressing, and take home]. I die for their homemade alfredo sauce. It's super rich and cheesy.

This friendly cafe offers passers-by some light fare, a lovely view of the canal and passes for the canal gondola rides!The main reason I can't get enough of this adorable caf\u00e9 comes down to two words: Italian ice. When ice cream is too heavy, Italian ice is the perfectly light sweet retreat! Lemon or lime. One scoop or two. This tart treat will tickle your taste buds and leave you wishing there was more. Along with my dessert, I'll also opt for one of their healthier options. With a variety of salad options, there really is no wrong choice. They're all good. Even if you don't like something in them, you probably won't notice it anyway. Yeah, THAT good. They stock their salads with some lovely, fresh ingredients and some homemade salad dressings.Grabbing a bit here is a breeze because you can walk here from anywhere near the canal or the cultural trail in the downtown area. And if you have a few minutes to spare, pop a squat in the petite outdoor seating and enjoy a beautiful day on the canal!"], ["Scott M.", "Roasted red pepper and feta dip was so addictive, we actually ordered a 2nd one mid-meal. Very strong feta, almost olive-y taste that perfectly complemented the cheese sprinkled pita sticks.Margherita flatbread was super simple but top-notch as well. Portion size was a little smaller than I had hoped, but to be fair, I have a big appetite.We will absolutely return to Fresco. The only reason why it doesn't get 5 stars is that for the somewhat high prices, you get somewhat smaller portions. I'd say that most of us \"big appetite folks\" would need to get an appetizer AND an entree in order to squash hunger. And that, that would be a bit spendy.Toddler factor: No high chairs or booster seats that I saw. May have some available if you ask, but I don't know. Also, it is pretty tight quarters inside so it would be difficult to have a high chair at the end of a table anyway.

Also got a glass of wine, which seemed a little small portion-wise, but was a good pairing with my pizza.They also have tableside s'mores on the menu, which we got. Very cool.Great spot for lunch or a first date type of experience.

Carbs for days.Enjoy the patio while the weather is still nice, the view is great and the music adds some fun to the atmosphere. I've tried some of lime Italian ice with tequila and definitely recommend, but I also would opt for a glass of wine.

This is seriously the cutest place ever! In the nicer months I love sitting outside and being by the water is a huge plus. I loved how cute it all was. I got the Italian Beef which is their specialty. I had the half sandwich and it was filling. I added the cheese and it came with chips. I got it wet so it was perfect and not messy. I added the Lemon Italian ice with Skyy Vodka and it was quiet refreshing! For dessert we got the s'more's. It was fun that we could make them right at our table. I love using the Pizzelle as the base to my s'more. I actually liked it better than graham crackers. It was soft and not crumbly. We also had some nice quality chocolate bars. It was a nice treat!

The website at the time (not sure about it now) was so inaccurate about the hours - I went to the actual restaurant at least 3 times before I just started calling instead, and it was still probably another two weeks of trying before I caught them at a time they were actually open. \u00a0From my understanding, the hours become more reliable as the summer continues so maybe this was only a problem in the spring (which is still kind of inexcusable to me). I ordered the chicken Parmesan sandwich and it was just bad...no way around it. The chicken tasted like cheap frozen chicken strips with unidentifiable pieces of chicken insides and way too much breading. \u00a0The sauce did not taste good to me either...it was oddly sweet almost like ketchup. And it's probably my fault for getting it to go, but the whole thing was just a soggy mess, although I'm pretty positive it wouldn't have tasted much better if I had eaten in the restaurant. The chips were good...but they're from the Amazing Chip Company so they don't improve my review of this place.

I never would have thought about fresh tuna in Indianapolis. I had the specialty Italian beef sandwich.

Place your order at the counter and a server will deliver your order. The Stromboli was good with a touch of spice and the Margherita Flatbread had a nice balance of oil, fresh tomatoes and fresh mozzarella. The outdoor patio is amazing on this warm and sunny day. Perfect for people watching and chatting with friends while enjoying a quick coffee and Lemontree baked goods. Cold beer along with an Italian skewer of antipasti was my companions' choice. For the finale' a scoop of homemade lemon Italian ice made from real fruit and no preservations. Fresco carries illy coffee, lattes, or cappuccinos along with homemade baked goods from Lemontree (great baker).

Have a romantic evening with skewers of antipasti or fruit, glasses of wine and end with your own tableside s'mores. \u00a0Kids can get into the action here as well.

He told me that the man a few feet away was actually the owner also named Brad. I didn't talk to the bartender or wait staff but I assume they were also named Brad. :)We had martinis, spinach & artichoke dip, a burger, and tortellini. We were more needy than usual and asked for a fried egg on the burger and half and half on the pasta sauces. Though neither was available on the menu, they were happy to accommodate- our server actually fried the egg (perfectly) himself! The owner ended up coming to say hello and was very nice.

However, after a long day at work I was in the mood for a relaxed meal and not in the mood to drive far from my home to get it. So, I ventured into Marco's at 54th & Keystone, a restaurant I used to visit a little more frequently when I worked down the street. If you've never been to Marco's, it has a pretty solid retro vibe going that always makes me think of an old school steakhouse or, perhaps more intentionally, a New York-styled family Italian joint with an intimate interior, dimmer lighting, a simple yet beautiful bar, and low overhead music that serves as a quiet companion to dinner and conversation. With a tag line of \"Meet me at Marco's,\" it shouldn't be surprising that Marco's is definitely considered a gathering place. It's a possible stop for lunches and dinners, from family gatherings to business meetings to everything else. I'd never actually been there for dinner before, but I arrived a little early in the dinner hour and despite the fact they do take reservations I was able to get a spot right away. By the end of my meal, it was pretty close to full. I will start with a word of advice to those with mobility impairments. You should use the side entrance - there's also a front entrance, but it goes in through the bar and I learned the hard way that it's not even remotely wheelchair friendly. The employees and folks in there were quite friendly, but it was awkward and disruptive. The side entrance is actually where the host area is and is definitely wheelchair friendly. I was actually seated at a four-top right inside the dining area. The bar and dining areas are in two different rooms, but they are in close proximity. I think the fact that I came in through the bar threw everyone off a bit, because they seemed unclear what to do with me initially. However, they quickly got it together and my server, Nisa, came over after a couple minutes. She also brought me the menu that hadn't been left with me. Prices at Marco's are moderate and for a meal are likely to start in the low teens with the potential to go considerably higher. They have specials throughout the night, including what I hear is a terrific steak dinner deal on Tuesday nights. The restaurant seemed a bit more \"formal\" than the last time I was in, but I still felt comfortable dressed casually. I was definitely not treated any differently, though I did see some men wearing ties. I kept it simple tonight - a cheeseburger (medium well, American cheese) that comes with steak fries for $9.95 plus an unsweetened iced tea ($1.80). The burger came as I ordered. It's a good burger, but definitely not what I'd call gourmet. It's very consistent with what you'd expect from a place that serves quality steaks. The french fries are definitely the same way - terrific steak fries. The iced tea was definitely great and I was offered multiple refills. Marco's has extra staff beyond the servers to ensure those little touches are offered. I was definitely impressed. Nisa was attentive without hovering and was always friendly and helpful. Despite the fact that the restaurant was getting crowded and I was at a four-top, I never felt rushed to leave (though this may have also been because I was at the first table in the restaurant - not exactly a desirable spot). If you're looking for a true gathering place, a place where you can enjoy a quality and leisurely meal while having conversation, Marco's is definitely the place. The overhead music is low enough that it doesn't distract and there are no other distractions. While the lighting was dim enough that reading my magazines was a bit challenging, the truth is I felt comfortable and really enjoyed the down time. Marco's, for me, was just about the definition of a four-star experience. The food quality, service, and atmosphere were all quite good and I wouldn't hesitate to go back. While I've definitely had a better burger, I enjoyed the meal immensely and felt welcomed throughout my meal. Between the accessibility concerns and the burger being good but not great, I can't quite go with a five-star but this was definitely a place that left me already looking forward to my next visit."], ["Suzie T.", "We had a great time here last Friday w/a packed out bar, people laughing & sharing, and feasting on their Italian favorites. \u00a0This was our first time and we were meeting up with my son, his fianc\u00e9e, and her parents.We tried to make reservations with Mama's but they don't take them on the week-ends. \u00a0Also when we found out that all had to be present to be seated, we knew that was a deal breaker with one of our guests always being fashionably late. \u00a0I contacted Marco's and they were very welcoming and accommodating.Our waitress was very good and especially with how busy the place was! \u00a0She let us set our own pace and was always available. \u00a0I agree with most reviews that the food isn't over the top but the feel of the place, great service, & sharing our evening with great friends and family probably gave this night a 4 instead of a 3.We ordered 3 app's to share:The stuffed mushrooms were lacking in favor with the cream sauce being very plain. \u00a0My hubster and I didn't find any crab either, maybe a few little shrimpThe pesto ravioli had predominately basil taste which was too strong with the spinach filling. \u00a0It should have had more flavor of sharper cheese, nuts, garlic & etc The calamari was very good with 2 sauces served for dipping.Our entr\u00e9es:My husband had the veal Parmigiana \u00a0which he enjoyed very much. \u00a0It was a huge portion,My 8oz fillet was grilled perfectly with lots of flavor, but when I asked for it to be topped with a little b\u00e9arnaise sauce and a few mushrooms, I was given a bowl of mushrooms and a bowl of sauce along with 2 hefty upcharges. \u00a0The b\u00e9arnaise greatly lacked flavor. -and they were way to much for my little steak so they were wasted. \u00a0My Caesar salad was very good but also had an upcharge. \u00a0I had brussel sprouts as my veg which also had an upcharge. \u00a0They were cooked well but I didn't care for the addition of oregano. \u00a0It wasn't a good marriage.Don't get me wrong, I was aware of the salad upcharge but don't see why. \u00a0The upcharge for Caesar would be OK if made authentically tableside (I used to do in the old school days). \u00a0A drizzle of b\u00e9arnaise & a few mushrooms on top would have warranted one upcharge. \u00a0Maybe a smaller portion of brussel sprouts with no upcharge would work. \u00a0-but 4 upcharges equaled a sandwich, just threw me. \u00a0 All in all it was a great evening and I'm looking forward to going back for one of their sandwiches, some of their other specials, and another chance to find my favorites affordably!"], ["Vanessa E.", "I always enjoy Marcos.

The staff are always nice and quick. The ambience is reminiscent of a classic italian restaurant, not too stuffy or anything like that, and if you like sports they always have a couple of games playing on the tv's. My honest opinion of this place is, you can't beat the food for the price. Make sure and check it out on Tuesdays when they have the 6 oz. filet for $11.95"], ["Kurt B.", "This was the WORST experience that I have ever had in my entire Life! \u00a012 of us went to Marcos to celebrate a birthday and a group of old asses had the nerve to come to the table to tell us to shut up and the waits were chiming in with them.

Located near the corner of 54th and Keystone, it sits with few other establishments for good eating in the area. The Tuesday night deal is basically a $10 steak, which is an filet migon, cooked to your order, served up with salad and potato. I can't even imagine how many of these steaks they've slanged over the years, as this place can be very crowded on Tuesday nights because of its famous cheap meat night. The bar here is great, so don't be afraid to order a martini, or a manhattan, served 'up' to go with your steak.

W.", "If you're looking for a locally owned restaurant (not easy in Indy) that offers good food for a good price, you've found it. Marco's does a great job combining quality and value, but you have to know what to order. The soup is outstanding, I prefer the minestrone, but the chowder is good too. When it comes to entrees, my wife and I have tried many of the items on the menu and when we stray from steaks, we're often disappointed. The long and short of it is, if you're interested in a full meal that includes red meat, try Marco's.

Entrees are served as a three-course meal, with a choice of minestrone or NE clam chowder, a choice of salads, and of course, your entree. I went for the minestrone and it was definitely one of the best minestrones I've had. The salad was excellent, and as I said before, the chicken piccata was to die for. Juicy, tender chicken and for a side I ordered wild rice, which was okay (I didn't want to overdo it by ordering a large baked or mashed potato!), but the chicken was more than enough (especially after the soup, salad, and bread!). My husband ordered the veal parmesan and nearly inhaled it. My son had a child's order of spaghetti with one meatball and couldn't finish it.

I have been here multiple times and I cannot say better things about this place. First discovered this gem when a friend and I wanted to try a restaurant we'd never been to that was featured on Devour Downtown. My oh my did we pick a goodie! To start, it's a little off the beaten path as you wouldn't normally just stumble upon this place. But the inside is a quaint typical Italian place. Really nice bar area and an adorable patio out back. Service has always been great, very friendly and fast. Have gone back several times since, and unfortunately I cannot speak to much of the menu because the first time I went, I had the most amazing meal, and have refused to try anything else. The lobster ravioli is probably one of the best meals I have ever had. The ravioli itself is so delicious but the sauce that it comes in is so flavorful. And there's SHRIMP! By the time I've eaten the ravioli, I use the bread to wipe the entire plate clean to get every ounce of sauce. I just recently went in because I saw they had a fall menu, which featured butternut squash ravioli. Again, I am blown away at how well prepared the meal was. As expected, the sauce again was so phenomenal that the guest I was with asked to have some extra sauce in a to-go container. Angry I didn't do the same! I love love love this place and can definitely say it's a big time favorite."], ["Suzanne W.", "This is fast becoming my favorite Italian joint in Indianapolis.

Everything my boyfriend and I had was absolutely delicious. The scallops and goat cheese appetizer, the salads, the wine, and the entrees. My boyfriend got the mushroom risotto with shrimp and I got the lasagna with Italian sausage. Delicious.The reason I'm giving a mediocre review is because while our waiter gave us good ordering suggestions, he failed to mention how much the upcharges were for each item even though we specifically asked. For example, we went on Tuesday so it was 25% off bottles of wine. He told us the bottle was cheaper than it was. We asked about the upcharge on getting a Caesar and caprese salad instead of the house that came with the entrees, and he said it would be a few dollars at most. We were celebrating, but we did not want to have a $150 dinner that night. Moral of the story, make sure you check the prices yourself whenever you add something on.

The scallops had a wonderful flavor and texture. My boyfriend had the chicken diavolo, which I didn't think was quite as good as mine, but was also delicious. The diavolo sauce is very thick and very spicy. He said the chicken was very tender and juicy. We also spilt the dessert special, chocolate creme brul\u00e9.

It robbed my husband and I of our rare date night.This was also our first Devour Downtown dinner of 2015, and their menu looked so lovely! We made a reservation, but called to tell them we'd be late. They said no problem. We arrived to a very lovely dining room, intimate lighting, linen-lined tables, exposed brick walls, romantic 40s music. Just perfect. We started with drinks. A lemon martini for moi, and some OJ for Rob. He asked if it was fresh squeezed or not - the picky customer he is - and gave the server an alternative drink order if it wasn't fresh. She brought him the juice, which tasted a bit off, like the oranges were old. He just set it aside. I liked the martini, a nice balance of sweet and tart. The vodka kinda crept up on me, and I was already feeling light-headed. That's just fine by me. \u00a0The starters were a couple Italian wedding soups. Rob said his was lukewarm, almost cold. Tried it, and it was. Mine too. We politely asked the server to warm up our soups. As we waited, a manager can by a dropped off a basket of warm bread. The bread tasted cheap, squishy and flaccid. Definitely microwaved. A staple of an Italian restaurant is the bread, and this stuff was flat-out embarrassing. For the entrees, I orders the filet and Rob has the lamb. I ordered it medium, and it came really rare. Again, Rob's lamb was not hot at all. When we told the manager about my steak not cooked all the way, she didn't apologize or anything. When my husband explained that his lamb wasn't anywhere near hot, the manager said that it was steaming when she got it from the window. I'm usually very forgiving because I know what it means to be in customer service. So I shrugged it off.We finished our meal work some yummy desserts! I dearly enjoyed my tirimisu in a flute. Very rich, fluffy, and a delicious coffee liqueur at the end. Rob liked the three, little canolli because they were light and properly portioned. When we received our check, Rob asked about the OJ tasting bad. The server said, \"Well, we made it for you. That's what you ordered.\" Whoa. Ok, now I'm not happy. I'm a pretty understanding customer, but there's two things I can't handle: condescension and rudeness. She didn't apologize or explain anything, just blamed my husband for ordering it.

Only complaint was the table next to us. I think they had indulged in a bit too much to drink and were screaming, yelling, and spilling drinks left and right. While I know that's not the restaurant's fault, it seems as though management could have tactfully said something? Either way, we managed to have a good meal, starting off with Italian Donkeys (Moscow Mules) and fried ravioli. Both were very tasty.. esp the ravioli. Want a surefire way to my heart? Fried Cheese. Yup. I got the Garlic Shrimp Pasta which was pretty good, but is actually much better cold as leftovers. Who woulda thought? We also indulged in their gigantic brownie a la mode for dessert. \u00a0While dessert is the best part of any meal, I was actually disappointed with the brownie. I mean, it was good.... but if I'm going to consume hundreds of meaningless calories, I think it could have had a richer and more fudgey texture.

The restaurant was a big success but, an \"incident\" caused the original restaurant to be shut down in 1940 (their words). Which leads me to wonder what kind of incident was it? A fire? Mass shooting? Carbon monoxide poisoning? Generalized anti-Italian sentiment that was growing around that time? Regardless, I was really confused. I'll have to check the old Indy newspapers to see if there's anything regarding this hella vague \"incident.\"While waiting, they were kind enough to offer us appetizers at the bar.

That just happens from time to time and something telling me maybe I don't need all that bourbon. There were family members of the owners at the bar who were great and bought us all a shot of tequila. \u00a0You don't get that everyday. He even sang for us and his wife told us a great joke. \u00a0I felt really at home here. I had the scallops entree and they were spot on and prepared perfectly. \u00a0The spinach salad was good too. Dessert was great. \u00a0As opposed to getting my favorite tiramisu, I opted for the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e spicy hot chocolate. This was great with 3 blue berry's perfectly placed on the whip cream. \u00a0Oh my, it was good. We felt so welcomed that we left feeling like we were close friends of the family. \u00a0I won't write about it here but there's a great back story of how this place came to be years ago that could be a scene out of a movie. \u00a0Oh. By the way. This is a place where a lot of care and time goes into your meal and things are not rushed for a good reason. \u00a0See the beauty in this."], ["Brian M.", "This was my first time here so the review will reflect that. I enjoyed walking in to the rustic looking building inside and out. We had reservations so we were able sit immediately but would guess there would be a wait as seating is minimal. Plan accordingly!Service was good, drinks were kept full and dishes were cleaned off once we were done with each course. Our server from time to time made some snippy comments, not sure if it was a bad night or her form of humor. The food was average at best with a couple things that turned us away from returning. For starters, I was surprised an Italian restaurant didn't offer any type of breadstick as an appetizer. The other issue was with my main course. I chose the baked penne pasta with chicken. The flavor of the dish was great. The sliced chicken was moist & flavorful. While attempting to get some chicken and pasta on my fork, I stabbed a bone the size of my thumb. Disgusting!! \u00a0I stopped eating at that point as I lost my appetite. Unsure how a bone this size made its way to my dish as my chicken was sliced into strips prior to serving.At this point I won't comment on anything else that happened the remainder of the night as my viewpoint was skewed from the bone in my dish. The only suggestion is to be careful with your food if you choose to visit this establishment."], ["Amber E.", "I was excited about this place. I wanted to like it it really is nothing special. The Ambiance is really nice. However, the food is nothing to write home about. For the price, this place stinks. The service was good."], ["J P.", "I was not impressed at this place at all. Its too pricey for what they offer. For the price, you'd expect more a better dining experience.I don't get a good date night with the wife often, so I was really looking to take her somewhere nice. We dressed up and stopped on in. Like most Indy places, dress was casual, although we didn't feel too out of place. They seated us outside initially without asking our preference. I imagine this would have been nice in the later evening, I was sweating in my suit. So we requested to be moved back inside, which was obliged. The atmosphere outside was much more casual. Inside the look of the place was nicer with good background music.The waitress was just ok. She wasn't particularly friendly, but not rude. I was pleased she knew a few details about the wines. But she seemed didn't seem to know other menu items and specials as thoroughly. The biggest letdown of the night was the bread. Most Italian places serve this right away. We started to think maybe we'd have to order some. It didn't come until right before our entrees were served. They gave us 3 small pieces of bread, and one was a bit soggy. What was really sad was a plate of tomato (bruschetta?) that was a mess. It look like my 1 year old hacked at it with a knife and was a big mangled blob in watery tomato juice. Very unappealing, I didn't feel like chopping it up further for use on the bread. No olive oil or butter was offered. The salads were decent. We switched from the house to the cranberry/walnut The change cost $3 per salad. The cranberry/craisins were extremely chintzy. I think my salad had maybe 3 of them.We both had lasagna, and that was the highlight of the evening food-wise. It was half white sauce (bechamel?) half red. My wife said she liked it better than what they used to serve at Sangiovese, but I wouldn't go that far. It was a very generous portion and we had to take some home with us. We probably could have split it. Another disappointment was the bill. When we ordered the lasagna, we were asked if we wanted sausage, meatballs, or both. We said both. When we got the bill this was an additional $4 per order. There was no mention in the menu or from the waitress this would cost more. This combined with a slightly higher upcharge on the salad than we expected, gave us a bill that was bigger than we expected. Our bill was around $85 or so in the end with two glasses of cheaper wine, salad, and entrees. It really didn't feel like it was worth it. I have had much better experiences at Macaroni Grill or Carrabbas, which would have probably been $50-$60 for the same and not so sparing on the salad and bread. Perhaps my expectations were set a little too high, but we won't be back."], ["Katherine L.", "Iozzo's was absolutely delicious. I came here on a recommendation and was not disappointed. My lady and I came here on a Friday night and we ate our dinner at the bar because it was absolutely packed. The ambience of the restaurant was romantic, upscale, and very friendly. Our bartender was Sarah and she was helpful and informative even when she was running back and forth getting everyone's drinks.At the time, the restaurant's special menu was based on cuisine from Tuscany. We decided to go all out, and we ordered as our appetizer the Fritto Misto (forgive my spelling), a mixture of fried calamari, rock shrimp and scallops. Next we both had the Italian Wedding Soup with a Bread basket that came with a freshly crushed quarter of a tomato and I believed it was drizzled in olive oil, fresh ground black pepper, and some salt? For my entree I had the Pork Osso Buco, cooked to perfection with the meat so tender and falling right off of the bone. Oh yes, and the mashed yukon potatoes were full of buttery goodness. My partner had the Grilled Lamb Chops which were cooked right at medium and just right, and the gnocchi was fresh and delicious as well. The portions were just right, and we were absolutely stuffed after our entrees, but we had to order dessert! For dessert we both ordered cappuccinos and shared a Rice Crispie Creme Brulee. \u00a0Seriously, who would ever have thought of putting rice crispies in a creme brulee? \u00a0This was amazing! the rice crispies were in the top layer, just under the sugar crunch. The size of the creme brulee was also perfect for two, and we cleaned that serving, just like we did with all of our other dishes.I am definitely coming back here. My \u00a0next order is going to be the lasagna bolognese. I had spied a women a few seats down from us who had ordered it and it looked absolutely amazing!"], ["Gilda C.", "My sons took me here for Mothers Day. I was pleasantly surprised. This small restaurant is a gem, tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the busy central downtown location just south of Shapiros, I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs with extra italian sausage. Very flavorful with a wonderful sauce....not so overpowering with tomato-based sauce. Italian sausage had just the right amount of spice and flavor hotness that made the taste like nothing Ive had before. Crisp salads....warm and delicious bread. My son ordered a meatball martini which he said was very good. Will I go back.....YES. Never knew this place existed."], ["Kent I.", "Iozzos has a good mix of classic ambiance and great food. It is that classic nice old Italian feel. Iarias has decent (although inferior food) but it just isn't the same caliber of atmosphere. As for our food, we got chicken Marsala and it was excellent. My wife had risotto with the scallops. The quality of food was excellent but the amount of scallops she got for the price seemed a touch steep. All in all I would say this is the best Italian restaurant in downtown Indianapolis."], ["Tim O.", "Off the charts delish.Where do I start. Homemade everything. I think. Wonderfully friendly, comfortable, unpretentious italian restaurant with fantastic food.Fresh bread, crushed heirloom tomato to accompany, oysters on the half shell, fresh made Caesar salad, perfectly seared scallops, pasta, creme brulee, espresso...Now for the constructive criticism. Our daughter ordered spaghetti and meatballs. I found the meatballs to have too much bread crumbs for my taste as mine at home are meat bombs. The espresso? I've had better. The creme brulee was flame crusted to perfection.Given that we had so much including wine it wasn't a cheap date. For three the bill was $144, $28 in wine.Summary: Can't wait to return to my new favorite restaurant in Indianapolis."], ["Jillian B.", "I decided to try this place after getting a Groupon. the atmosphere was very nice. the food was absolutely delicious. the scallop appetizer and the red snapper were very fresh and cooked perfectly. service was on point - my water was never less than half full.

I know my wife had heard some good things since then & wanted to try it again so I made reservations for Saturday night. First the good. We were seated pretty quickly & had great service all night from a lady who has been there from the beginning.the cheese bread was very tasty & the Caesar salads crisp with a good dressing. We ordered the Taste of Iozzo's for 2 to give us a taste of several things. This is where it went downhill. I liked the lasagna while my wife (a GREAT cook) thought it was too cheesy & didn't have enough meat.Conversely she looks thought the fettuccine alfredo was decent while I thought it was bland. We both agreed the meatball was tender & had good flavor. We also agreed the spaghetti was blah, the veal marsala tough & the chicken piccata was dry & chewy. Overall we really were disappointed in the meat dishes & agreed while it was okay it really wasn't worth a trip downtown when there are so many other options."], ["A P.", "Fantastic meal! \u00a0Great service and even better food! \u00a0If the weather is nice, sit on the back patio. \u00a0Adding to my list of spots for Indianapolis."], ["Gary E.", "My wife and I went here on my birthday. The restaurant is very quaint and the brick walls just add to the old time feeling. She had the fettuccine with chicken and broccoli. She thought it was very good as was her salad.

Originally, my husband and I had a reservation for two at 8 PM. At the last minute, three friends wanted to join our party, and we realized we are going to be there a bit early. I called the restaurant and ask them if they could change our reservation from 2 to 5 people, and move it up by half an hour. They were very accommodating and amended our reservation as requested. When we got there, our table rows ready and we were seated immediately. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated, with exposed brick walls and rustic hardwood floors. They also have an outdoor courtyard, with cobblestone and hanging lights. \u00a0The restaurant was busy, so it took a little while for our waitress to come over and get our drink orders. When she came to the table, three of us knew what we wanted to drink, and two people were still deciding and had some questions. When one of our friends asked how the Porter was, our waitress simply replied that it was a dark beer. I think my friend was looking for A response with a bit more depth. Another friend had some questions about the wine. Instead of answering her questions, the waitress simply left the table and said she would be back when we were ready.When she finally came back to actually take our drink orders, she also explained the specials and the various salad options. Due to the noise in the restaurant, it was difficult for some of us to hear what she was saying. When it came time to order our entr\u00e9es, several people asked her about the salad choices. Her response was, \"as I said earlier, you can get...\". We felt like we are being talked down to and this was overall just rude. \u00a0We never received any bread, although every other table seemed too. Our Andres came out relatively quickly, and were okay. It was nothing fabulous. To me The food is more authentic tasting at Iria's or Napoli Villa."], ["Anand G.", "I would totally recommend this place and quite possibly the best Italian food in Indianapolis ..

Thanks for accommodating our requests and making out night special :-)"], ["Tim L.", "The four of us regularly try new (to us) places so my friend had really wanted to try Iozzos. He was really looking forward to it. Sadly it wasn't nearly as good as he had hoped.  \u00a0My wife had read about the place and told me it was a \"fine dining\" place so I had to change my pants from jeans to cordoroys. I was a bit skeptical of the veracity of her claim but you fellas know it's best to just make your wife happy! \u00a0So I \u00a0changed. For your advise, in a word, don't. No need. Jeans are perfectly fine.  \u00a0The location on South Meridian, near Shapiro's should have clued her but the building is pretty neat. Good ambiance. Well sort of. It's a bit noisy when crowded as the sound just bounces off the brick walls and painted acoustic ceiling.  \u00a0The food looks really good. Looks. The flavor is rather bland across the board. Even the spaghetti needs something...like salt maybe? \u00a0I had the chicken parm. It was overcooked and even hard and chewy on the edges. The center was good though. My friend had a chicken marsala which he gave the same verdict as mine...no flavor. His wife had the chicken Alfredo. Same verdict. My wife had the 8 oz sirloin...ok but not nearly like Harry and Izzy's or the like. But this isn't a steak place.  \u00a0The dinner salads were good. The new waiter Anthony was very nice and attentive but not overbearing.  \u00a0So all in all, I'd rather eat the chicken parm at Bravo or Maggianos and save the hassle of driving downtown."], ["Linda L.", "Went here a few times for work lunch.

The temperature in this place was inexcusable for 2015. It was 100 degrees in the bar and 85 in the dining room. All we heard was excuses about the 200 year old building. Water couldn't be filled fast enough and since it's so hot it was Luke warm at delivery. Piece of advice: when you can't cool down your guest keep the drinks cold and full. Had to ask for our food Togo so we could enjoy it and it took 10 min for it to be boxed. The server obviously saw how upset we were and offered us free ice cream- it would've been soup by the time it was delivered.

I have tried so many delicious meals there and the appetizers, so good. The toasted ravioli is out of this world. The Caprese is nothing to write home about but still great.

No complaints on any of the food, only compliments. I had the entree scallops. Our table ordered the oysters, calamari, antipasto and scallop appetizers. OK, I will admit that the calamari was on the greasy side. Also, not a huge fan of their signature Manhattan but had to try it.

My side pasta was a little bland; I should have asked for red pepper to liven it up.I don't know, I guess I could try out more Iozzo dishes. In my limited opinion, most local Italian restaurants are always \"just okay\", not very creative, with interchangeable menus. \u00a0Or, I'm just used to going crazy at home, adding anchovy paste, a fistful of cracked red pepper, fennel seeds, a head of garlic, etc. into my own sauce, so everything else pales in comparison. \u00a0Iozzo's atmosphere and presentation is well-conceived, so I'd rate them higher than most Italian places.

I'm usually more of an angel hair kind of girl, but the tasty sauce made up for the thicker noodles big time. And the meatballs - oh! the meatballs! I should have asked if there was turkey or something else mixed in. They were very lean and had a really nice texture. The meal also came with a salad and nice hunk of fresh bread.

I hate to give a bad review on a local restaurant and since I've had good lunch experience I will chalk it up to a bad night. Will give it another try over lunch but probably not for devour downtown.

If you're cold-blooded, keep it in mind, or order an extra glass of vino to warm you up!-There was an up-charge for soup instead of salad, which I don't recall being mentioned on the menu or by the server. But, the soup was tasty, so it was worth it!Tips:-Call ahead for a table or make an Open Table reservation. The place was busy!"], ["Sarah F.", "Fabulous service and wonderful food in a date-perfect atmosphere. I went here with my hubby on date night and although they were busy and our waiter was probably meeting himself coming and going, everyone was on the ball. Our orders came out accurately and in perfect sequence and we had just enough time to really enjoy all of our courses, including the first, liquid course (a 2009 pinot that's not easy to find anymore!). I really, truly cannot wait to go back. I had the popular lobster and shrimp raviolis. I tend to want to try new things and specials at new places but the lobster ravioli was so hyped up that I had to give it a whirl. Boy-oh-boy is that some rich, flavorful goodness! I recommend it. By the way, I don't hand out 5-stars all the time. You can check my stats if you want :) The places that get a five-star salute from me are very special places that provide the \"whole package\" experience. Iozzos Garden of Italy is one such gem."], ["James W.", "I love Iozzos' atmosphere. We had great service.

Definitely worth checking out for a meal out none too expensive."], ["Nanon E.", "I asked the hostess if the pasta was freshly made; she affirmed it was.

A factory is a place where things are made in house. This is misleading."], ["Robert G.", "I usually love their simple whole wheat pasta with meat sauce. Add some extra garlic and it's even better.

I then asked for extra dressing, that took quite a long time as well. \u00a0If the waiter had put extra dressing on my salad in the first place, he would not of had to bring the dressing back. We also ordered a refill on a root beer and that almost took a year to get!! \u00a0Unfortunately, the salad was lacking. \u00a0It needed more croutons, \u00a0carrots and needed some baby greens. \u00a0It was just iceberg lettuce. We also had ordered two Italian sodas and for $4.75 you get a free glass. \u00a0We had to ask for clean glasses to take home. \u00a0Wow! \u00a0So that is the last negative thing that I have to say. \u00a0Now to end on a positive note. \u00a0The broccoli with the Mizithra and butter was absolutely scrumptious. \u00a0I ordered the manager's special, half meat sauce half Mizithra butter and it was absolutely yummy. \u00a0It was definitely better than the Spaghetti Factory in Denver. \u00a0 My mom ordered the managers special have clam sauce and half Mizithra butter and she said the clam sauce was way better than Denver. \u00a0My cousin ordered the spinach tortellini and she says that it was quite yummy, too and \u00a0my other cousin ordered the half spaghetti/half ravioli and he was quite pleased. \u00a0Also, the Italian sodas, and \u00a0those were really good.

We went about 5:30 on a Saturday to try and beat some of the dinner rush and were very successful. It was a lucky thing too as there were apparently a number of high school proms that day. About 6 to 6:30, the place was packed with many people waiting for a table. The restaurant is really unique on the inside with how it is set up and it adds a level of character to the dining experience. There is an old trolley car inside the building with tables that you can be set at, which we all thought was pretty cool.The menu isn't huge in terms of choices as it boasts your typical Italian cuisine. The big draw is their 3-course meal that you can get for as little as $10.50. This includes unlimited bread, soup or salad, your entree, and ice-cream. I picked the Chicken Parmigiana and was somewhat satisfied. The portions were somewhat small, in my opinion, as the salad only took a few bites to finish. Everything tasted very good, however. My wife had the fettuccine alfredo which she said was also very good. I hate to compare The Old Spaghetti Factory to Olive Garden, but it definitely reminded me of it based on the menu choices. OG is just a tad more expensive, but you do receive larger portions. The wait staff was very friendly and kept our drinks filled regularly. Unfortunately I can't recall our waitresses name, but she was fun to talk to and had a great attitude. Everything was brought out quickly and piping hot. I should also note that there was a gentleman walking around creating balloon animals for kids, or anyone who wanted one. I would stop in again if I'm in the area and craving something Italian. Give it a shot!"], ["Sam R.", "Overall, disappointingly mediocre.You would think the Old Spaghetti Factory would be a gem...it has a perfect location, and seems like an institution...which, admittedly, it is, whether good or not. I expect spaghetti at a place that sells itself as a \"spaghetti factory\" to be super delicious, but the OST's spaghetti is anything but. Bland, boring, not enough sauce, not good enough sauce...just ew.The fettuccine is mildly better than the spaghetti, but nothing to cry home about. This is a place of tradition that families go to as a reunion. This is a place that Comic Con goers and other passersby in the area at various conventions go to. But this isn't a place that you should go to if you're looking for really good food...sadly."], ["Michelle Q.", "This is the perfect location for a family evening. It has the fun booths, balloon animals, and a gorgeous view of the Circle of Lights on the monument. They can be a bit crowded so plan to sign in and walk around downtown enjoying the sights for about half hour. Love the text when table is ready! The spaghetti and meatballs was a family favorite. There was nothing gourmet or spectacular about the menu but it did offer safe, comfortable favorites which is what we wanted for our group. The cheese garlic bread was a big hit with our table and was extremely convenient for a bustling group of toddlers with the precut slices."], ["Kim K.", "Family friendly. Fairly priced. Fun atmosphere.When I am faced with choosing a place that can seat a larger group quickly; when the whole family is dining with us from grandmas to grandkids; and cost is a factor, Old Spaghetti Factory is one of my top suggestions.They do not take reservations, but if theres is a wait, it is usually not long, even for groups. Their food is not something I would write home about, but it's enjoyable and there are a wide variety of options that are a great value. For a set cost (around $10-12) you get a 3 course meal: soup or salad (I crave their house dressing, a creamy pesto dressing), fresh baked bread with garlic butter, entree of your choosing (try out their famous Mizithra and brown butter- or be adventurous and try out the Manager's Favorite: get half of the Mizithra and Brown Butter and another sauce of your choosing on the other half!) and dessert (the spumoni is always delicious)!It is also fun when you are lucky enough to get seated in the old-fashioned trolley car that doubles as a dining hall!"], ["Jnana S.", "Dinner was great! I got the chicken Marsala and Lasagna! \u00a0The Lasagna had a classic taste and the chicken Marsala wine sauce was very favorable. The best part was the Italian ice cream you get at the end. Yummy! I will definitely go back"], ["Amanda B.", "they pack people in like sardines, so it can be loud, but the food is good and the atmosphere is nice. In all the times I've been here, I've never heard them sing happy birthday less then 3 times, so be prepared for that all night.*bonus points if you get to sit under any of the light fixtures that look straight out of a bordello."], ["Tom B.", "This place is an old favorite, going back to the mid 80's as a student at DePauw. We sat in the train car, and were promptly acknowledged and served. I'm sure the pasta here isn't the same caliber that you might find at high-end Italian restaurants, but that's not really what this restaurant is all about. It's about getting a satisfying meal at a reasonable price, in a very cool setting. I had the standard spaghetti and meat sauce - nothing special, but I really loved it. Their sauces are just the right amount of sugar and Italian spices. The pasta is nice and firm, with great flavor. Another great meal from a downtown Indy classic."], ["Chad E.", "While in Indy we stopped here for lunch. I tried the lasagna and the chicken marsala. The meal overall was very average and bland. The most enjoyable part of the meal was the orange Italian soda, the fresh bread, and the ice cream. The service was good, but the meal was overpriced. Will not be returning, but at least I have a souvenir glass from the Italian soda."], ["Sarah C.", "Affordable and delicious. I have only been to The Old Spaghetti Factory twice, but I have been pleased each time. For under $15, I could have a salad, bread, huge serving of pasta and a dessert to top it off. I recently learned that they don't take reservations, which could be a blessing or a curse. In my most recent case, a friend and I wanted to go to dinner on Valentine's Day and we knew - for a fact - that most restaurants would be packed. Thankfully we were able to get into the Spaghetti Factory immediately. We chose to sit in the bar area upstairs, which turned out to be equally as nice as the regular seating below. I actually told me family today that this would be a great place for us to go - considering we're a family of six and no matter what, going out to eat is pricey. This way, we can have a good meal downtown and not feel like we broke the bank. My only downfall was the service. Everyone was super nice - so that's great. The issue was that they really didn't seem on top of their game. Some forgetfulness was observed, but hey - everyone's human. All in all, I really enjoy this place and let's be honest - who doesn't love pasta?"], ["Leslie H.", "Definitely a family friendly restaurant. Plus the value of your money with the food that you get goes a long way. I love the fact that they have a complete meal. For one flat price, you get some bread, a drink, salad/soup, entree, and dessert. They probably have my most fave pasta of all time: spaghetti in brown butter with mizithra cheese. It's so good! Way too delish! They get the cheese all the way from Greece and you can buy a half pound for you to take home."], ["Seth S.", "Classic place to visit in downtown Indy! \u00a0Relaxed atmosphere, affordable with a rustic retro feel inside. \u00a0Walking distance, just blocks from LOS or the convention center. \u00a0 Lasagna is perfect and save room because ice cream is complimentary following your meal! \u00a0If you're lucky you may even get seated in the trolley!"], ["Melissa H.", "We came to Indianapolis to visit the children's museum (which rocked). \u00a0We are staying nearby at the JW Marriott but had to get out of the hotel because the cheerleader convention is not conducive to relaxation.With the convention in town, all of the restaurants are slammed. \u00a0We were (understandably) advised our wait would be about 35 minutes. \u00a0They took our cell # and said we would get a text when our table was ready, which I love way more than the typical buzzing coaster notification. \u00a0We were seated much earlier and the hostess, despite them being shorthanded and inundated with cheerleaders, was awesome.Our order was taken promptly and our food arrived quickly. \u00a0There is a guy walking around making some amazing balloon animals, although he didn't visit our table.I got the baked lasagna and it was wonderful! \u00a0The only criticism I have is just based on personal taste because their sauce has chunks of tomato in it and that's just not something I'm crazy about, but it was easy to eat around them."], ["Roger S.", "The Old Spaghetti Factory has always been one of our favorite family friendly places to eat in Indianapolis. This visit had some noteworthy pros and cons. The cons: the salad had a strange plastic taste. I couldn't figure out if it was the salad dressing or the salad itself. My wife's Caesar salad was fine. Our kids had apple sauce, which they wouldn't eat. I tried it and found it to be warm and had a very odd taste. \u00a0We were also seated near the kitchen. I think they stick groups with kids in this undesirable location. Through most of our meal, we could hear the staff talking and laughing loudly. That made it difficult to enjoy our meal. The pros: Our server was fantastic. Not only was she very attentive, but she also took the time to engage us in appropriate and enjoyable conversation making us feel very welcome. Our orders all arrived as expected and the pasta was perfect. The bread was delicious. Overall, it was a good experience, but I would not want to sit near the kitchen again."], ["Richard B.", "The food is great but they could give a bit per order.

Sat inside the train car - even better. Prices are very reasonable to cheap for the amount of food you get between entrees, soup or salad, bread and dessert. Food is not a disaster by any means (high praise)! but anyone that previously referenced cafeteria food / Fazoli's is pretty spot on.The Bad: Service is well-intentioned but slow. Better options in downtown area unless you need space for a big group or have lots of kids.

I do have to give the server props for noticing that there was a blue cheese crumble in my salad and got me a new one prior to serving it. One of the downsides to this restaurant is the location of the bathroom.

Full of flavor and absolutely delicious. Everything was great, but my timballo (a five-layer lasagna) and the tortellini in brodo also really stood out.

Better to avoid temptation, right? ;)The server did a great job, even readjusting an outdoor umbrella to block a nearby light that was disturbing my mother inside the restaurant. He was very knowledgable and friendly as well. The only complaint is that there was a lengthy delay between the soup course and the main course (close to an hour) without an update or explanation. My assumption is that they were slammed (it was the night before the mini, after all). I see that someone else left a review from that same night, with a lengthy delay.

The lasagna seemed fair and the chicken piccata was fair to good, but definitely had way too \u00a0much lemon. Round out this unappealing meal came the same lack of flavor desserts.

Right when you enter the restaurant there is a sitting area that consists of all high tables with stools. A small group of people were sitting in the corner chatting with a waitress who was preparing silverware. No one was eating food and no one greeted us. This was our first time here and we didn't know what the eating style was and honestly felt like leaving because I felt so out of place and uncomfortable. But my husband insisted on staying and grabbed a menu from a table close to the entry.We sat looking at the menu for some time waiting to be acknowledged. We finally decided to walk towards the a counter that revealed a bit of the kitchen because we thought maybe we were supposed to order there. \u00a0As we slowly made our way to the counter the host, who hadn't been present or seen until we walked up, was passing through from the kitchen to what appeared to be an adjoining room. He asked us how many people would be dining in our party and then lead us to the dining room and we were seating. *phew* We were very hungry and decided to order a pizza right away. We got the \"Classic\" house specialty pizza which has mushrooms, sausage, pepperoni and extra cheese. It was good, the crust was thin and crunchier than I'm used to but it had good flavor. I can't believe I'm saying this, but the extra cheese was just too much (I love a good cheesy pizza). My husband liked the pizza better than I did, so that's why I'm keeping this rating at 4 stars. I hope to return and try some of the appetizers they have and maybe a pasta dish-we saw a lot coming out and they looked awesome.I'm docking a star for the awkward and uncomfortable arrival experience we had.

Some Guys Pizza Pasta Grill was the scene of one of my absolute worst customer service experiences, an experience so profoundly negative that I swore I'd never return. It has, in fact, been years since that experience and despite the fact that I live in the neighborhood I had never returned before this evening. My decision to return to Some Guys was inspired by a couple of things - 1) I have multiple friends who've sworn to me that my experience had to be an exception as they know the owner personally and it would have been unacceptable and 2) Said owner's recent actions during the RFRA controversy here in Indianapolis made me more inclined to support his business. The \"incident,\" as I call it, involved my arriving for dinner with a friend and being rudely refused, for several minutes, the opportunity to sit in one of their booths because, in their words, my wheelchair would be blocking their aisle and that would make it a fire hazard. Beyond the fact that they were incorrect, they were also stereotyping that I didn't plan to actually get out of my wheelchair. It wasn't so much that it happened, but it was the overwhelmingly negative tone with which everything was communicated. I still vividly remember that night and commonly use it as an example of how not to treat someone with a disability. So, you can probably imagine my surprise when I was escorted to my table after 15 minutes of a planned 25-minute wait to find that they were, in fact, seating me at one of their booths. In fact, they even apparently planned for me to stay in my chair (but I didn't). Isn't life weird?So, almost instantly, Some Guys went from a \"never again\" kind of place to a place where I was thinking \"Maybe this will work out.\" The truth is I had my doubts heading in. Some Guys is located in an older strip center at 62nd & Allisonville Road. While the other side of the strip center has better accessible parking (in front of Big Lots), the building is divided in two with a step separating the two. Some Guys has a couple of non-ADA accessible spots, including one right at its curb that offers the only step-free option onto its sidewalk. If you use that spot, you may very well block the access. It's a weird, poorly designed area. The restaurant has two sets of doors going in - one of which I had such a hard time opening that I actually left thinking maybe it wasn't the entrance. Once you go in, you're in a waiting area that is separated by wall from the modestly sized dining area. The decor is warm and inviting, though the dining room's acoustics are such that it does get fairly noisy. The menu consists of the expected pizzas, pastas, appetizers, salads, and desserts. The pizzas include traditional and wood-fired. I opted for pizza, which is skewing slightly away from my current dietary regimen but I was in the mood for a splurge. I went traditional, a small 8\" pizza with sausage. I ordered a side of garlic bread and my usual unsweetened iced tea - The entire meal came in at just over $11. So, while I'd have previously given Some Guys a 1-star rating based upon a truly horrible experience I'm balancing that experience with tonight. The accessibility issues automatically do knock off one star. Parking, getting into the building, and the actual dining area are all not truly wheelchair friendly. It can be done, but it's challenging. The pizza was good and it's refreshing to have a quality pizza option for someone dining alone. I have a feeling the wood-fired pizzas are better, but this was good. The toppings tended to slide off the pizza, but overall I enjoyed it. The garlic bread was fairly disappointing - very crusty and rather light on the garlic. I'd consider it all slightly above average and 3-stars feels right. The truth is that WB Pizza is less than a block away and serves up better pizza. That said, Some Guys offers up a better dining atmosphere. My server, whose name I never caught, was also in that 3-star range. She was attentive and I got my refill, but she seemed hurried even after the dining room had started to empty out as I was dining later than usual. She did everything I needed, but she didn't really make me want to go back. While 3-stars may not feel like a great rating for a pizza joint regarded as one of Indy's better ones, it's a sure sign for me that my prior negative experience may truly have been a horrid fluke. While this isn't likely to be a destination spot for me, it was a nice change of pace and I actually ran into 3 people I knew while there! Some Guys also has a Carmel location and is currently celebrating its 25th year in Indy."], ["Gary E.", "NOT GONNA BE RANKED AS ONE OF INDY'S BEST ANYMOREThe pizza has really gone down.

The crust doesn't have much flavor. Usually when I don't like something after the first few bites I try to see if it will grow on me but this just honestly isnt.

Instead of going out for a 3 course gourmet meal all at one restaurant, we pieced together our perfect evening from a plethora of local options. On tap for the main course: some guys. While enjoying our cheese trap appetizer (see my wildwood market review) we reviewed the menu for some guys. I quickly settled on pizza, my wife on pasta. She enjoyed her wood fired penne pasta, which lived up to every previous review that led her to that choice. I, also following the recommendations of my fellow yelpers, went with the house sausage pie (Italian sausage, sweet red peppers, caramelized onions and goat cheese. NO SAUCE.). I got it as an 8\", which is perfect for one person (assuming you had a huge cheese tray, several sun king beers, and have cake bake shop on tap for dessert). I was very hesitant to order it because it didn't come with sauce, but it is a nonissue once you take your first bite. If they didn't tell me it was sauceless I may have eaten the whole thing without figuring out what was different about it. The ingredients are so fresh and flavorful, the pizza isn't dry without the sauce. The wife's pasta came with bread plus a side salad, which we split. All was delicious, and a ton of food for the small price tag we paid. So, why 4 stars? We live about \u00a01 mile away and delivery was going to be 2.5 hours!

Great beer on tap and a relaxed atmosphere."], ["Bobby Y.", "Sheesh. Ordered two large pizzas after reading all of the stellar reviews and man, the crust was terrible. Neither crispy nor chewy. Just dry, thickish, bready and tasteless. The sauce was characterless and the toppings were average. There is no art in this pie.Clearly the Indy locals have a different standard of what constitutes *great* pizza. To my surprise, my sister and brother-in-law love this place as well as the WB pizza place on the same block. I don't understand it. Proximity, maybe? They live 3 blocks away.(I also tried the WB pizza place and was even more disappointed. A dry, thickish, very bready and tasteless crust as well.)The pictures say it all."], ["Theresa G.", "When I think of fresh dough and wood fired pizza, I think of the bubbly pizza with the actual wood fired look (you know what I'm talking about!). But sadly, this is not that. Honestly, there would be no difference between this pizza and one that came straight from the oven. It was bland and tasted like a Tombstone pizza with slightly better toppings. I would have only given it two stars if it wasn't for the house pepperoni pizza, which was pretty good but could be made better with a real gourmet/wood fired crust. I got the margarita pizza which was bland. Again, I think all this had to do with the crust which just looked processed and what you could expect a frozen pizza crust to look like. Sorry, Indy! I love me some pizza but this was not my favorite."], ["K B.", "I went on my lunch break. Service and ambience were great. Salad was very good, but pizza was nothing special.

First, they aren't open on Monday, which, thanks to Yelp, saved me a trip across town for nothing.Some Guys is in a strip mall next to a Big Lots. It's a rather plain looking place, and had I not heard about it, I wouldn't have given it a second thought just driving by and never would have tried it. Walking in even, you don't quite know what to expect. There are several small round bar tables that were empty and a counter at the opposite end. I again wondered what this place was, and if it was just carryout. Finally, after walking to the very back I saw the sign \"please wait for hostess to seat\" and knew I had to be missing something.After checking in with the polite and friendly host, i was led back to a dining room that was almost full with people. It isn't a very big place, maybe 10 booths along the walls and 10 or so tables in the middle. The decor was a little outdated, reminding me of a cheesy Italian restaurant with fake ivy to try and make it look authentic (I guess, I don't know). I disagree with the reviews that say the place as a romantic ambience.. to me, it looked like any cheesy Italian restaurant you would see on TV.A quick glace at the menu and I knew that my first opinion of Some Guys Pizza was completely wrong. I couldn't decide what to try; everything sounded absolutely amazing! From the reflection in the window I could see flames coming from the wood fired oven, which made the smells of fresh baked pasta and pizza permeate the entire place. It was suggested by a friend who frequents Some Guys Pizza that I try either the House Sausage pizza or the Wood Fired penne pasta. Both sounded great, so I asked our server for a suggestion. She suggested the lasagna, a specialty served only on the first Friday-Sunday of the month guaranteed, and then every once in awhile as a special. It sounded great, but I stuck to my friends suggestion and went with the House sausage pizza. I also liked that I could order a small (8 inch) pizza and spend less than $10.When the pizza arrived, I couldn't get into it fast enough. The flavors were amazing, and for a pizza without sauce, it couldn't have gotten any better. The crust was perfect; not too thick and not too thin and lightly sweetened by honey. It complimented the toppings on the pizza perfectly.Before I knew it, I had completely devoured my pizza. I intended on saving half of it and taking it home for leftovers, but it almost seemed like a crime not to eat every bite right away. The place may be in a strange location, and it might look a little cheesy inside, but the only thing that matters is the food, and Some Guys has hands down nailed it. There are several good pizza places in Indy, and this one just got added to my list. I'll be back very soon, and can't wait to work my way through the menu."], ["Nikol P.", "The spinach ravioli with pesto sauce is the bomb diggity. I do not care for their caesar dressing here and that is one of my favorite salads. The biggest surprise to me was the Fettuccine Alfredo. I tried some that I had ordered for the kids. I have always thought it was a bland dish especially for the amount of calories consumed. But, this Fettuccine made me realize why it's a popular dish. So flavorful!! There small pizzas are good for two kiddos to share. The restaurant is a bit noisy and cramped. I prefer to get my food as carry out from there."], ["Jennifer M.", "I LOVE this place! I feel like it is a little, hidden gem right outside of Broad Ripple. They have wood-oven pizzas (large variety and create-your-own), pastas (specialty featured pastas- my fav is the North Atlantic Lobster Ravioli when it is featured & I love their vodka sauce), delicious salads and appetizers. In addition, their features are not run-of-the-mill things. They also serve beer and wine!One of my favorite appetizers is a baked shrimp dish, in marinara sauce. I asked that they make it spicy and it is awesome! They also have a great goat cheese appetizer. Their Roma bread is unique- pizza dough and filled with garlic, topped with spices (great for dipping in the shrimp app).The small side salad is like $4 and it's almost a meal in itself: tomatoes, green peppers, olives, red onions, lots of cheese, & breadcrumbs. Definitely get the Italian Gorgonzola dressing which is house made.Desserts are yummy too!"], ["Misty M.", "Holy moly! We were just visiting and was looking for a good pizza place for dinner. With the help of Yelp, we decided on Some Guys based on reviews.Judging it solely on the outside, we probably wouldn't have stopped. It looked like a boring strip mall pizza joint.Stepping inside, there is an area you can order a drink while waiting (our wait was 20 minutes on a Friday evening). The dining room is kinda small. We ordered a pepperoni pizza, and Roma bread for an appetizer. The bread was very flavorful. No marinara, but it was good on it's own.Service was great. Waitress checked back often, prompt with refills and check.The pizza was delicious! We have some pretty great pizza places at home, but our pizza here was freaking wonderful!

I think Some Guys is a little better value, so it probably wins out overall. The barbecue chicken and five meat pizzas are delicious and they are very good about special requests (when we asked for light cheese we actually got light cheese, unlike most other pizza places). The servers here are very friendly and the food comes out pretty quickly. It definitely feels like a family establishment. They also serve some local brews at an affordable price, so I would recommend dining in and enjoying a pint or two. :)"], ["Jason W.", "Some Guys does not have the location of Three Wise Men or the flair of Napolese, but at the moment it is my favorite pizza joint in Indianapolis. \u00a0I try to ignore that it is located in a strip mall and the layout is very awkward.

The pizza is always good, no matter what variety I have, and Italian dressing with gorgonzola cheese is delicious. There can be quite a wait, however, as seating is limited. If you are going with a group, be warned that they don't split checks -- only one per table. We went to the other night and had the Cajun pizza. For four people, the large left us with only a fraction of the pie to take home. The Thai wood fired pizza is another favorite of mine. The Cajun comes with locally made sausage. It's hot but not too hot, if that makes sense.The dining area is a bit on the dark side and the booths have wrought iron around them. It's a great place for a date! I saw a sign that they were serving Lick ice cream, but I never have room for dessert. They serve beer and wine but don't have a full bar. You can also get a partially baked pizza to take home.I've heard their lasagna is delightful but they only serve it once a month.Also, 62nd and Allisonville may seem like it's far from downtown but it only takes 15-20 minutes to get there."], ["Nezbit T.", "Power was out on Allisonville Road earlier this evening, but despite the lack of electricity, the staff of Some Guys still managed to rustle up a small chicken caesar for me under these adverse conditions.

We went with half house pepperoni half BBQ chicken. It was splendid. Wonderfully made in-house pepperoni that is to die for. Their BBQ chicken is the perfect balance of zest and savory. \u00a0I highly recommend their raspberry dressing for salad as well. Definitely go with the half and half.

OK fine I am known to be a little klutzy at times!) Apparently they messed up my order but they realized before they brought the food out so I had to wait a few minutes more...but I did not care. I really like that they noticed before bringing the food out!! Kudos!Food:Bread - garlic bread and Roma bread was OK not the best I have had.Salad - pretty decent house salad with tomatoes, onions (ugh i hate chunky raw onions and this place sliced them real thin so i actually didn't pick them out of the salad), black olives, green peppers and lettuce. They also asked if I would like some freshly ground pepper on it (yes please!)Pasta - tried the tomato basil sauce (the best i have ever had!!!)... it was sooo flavorful! I wonder if they sell just that by the bottle... (?) Also tried the vodka sauce extra spicy.... oh my! was freaking awesome ... like a cajun sauce.

Big thick noodles with a light amount of red sauce. The onions were slightly sweet and so was the roasted garlic. There was a hint of heat and the beef was deliciously tender.

Just that alone is a big YAY for Indianapolis. The food is just wonderful. The wine selection is great. The servers are professional and very friendly. The food is priced right. Plating is like a work of art..similar to how beautiful the main dining room is. There are private rooms available. It is easy to make reservations. Coat service is on par. Bathrooms are aesthetically pleasing. It is just overall a nice and great place for a hotel restaurant."], ["Jeremy M.", "I've only been here for breakfast and lunch, so don't count on my review for dinner.The wive and I stayed at the JW awhile ago and had breakfast included with the room. They offered a good selection of breakfast items, both hot and cold. There were the usual eggs and bacon type things, plus the omelet station and waffle maker. They also offered a variety of pastries, fruit, and even smoked salmon. My only complaint would be that the restaurant isn't arranged the best for a buffet. It was awkward getting around to the different stations and there wasn't a lot of room for lines to form. It was a good buffet, but not perfect. If I weren't staying here I don't know that I'd make a special trip just for breakfast when there are many other good options in the area.More recently, I came here with a group for lunch during work. We were there at 11:30, right when they opened, so we were seated immediately and were the only ones in the place until around noon. I ordered pasta and the rest of the group ordered a variety of pasta and sandwiches, all of which looked quite good. My food was great - hearty and filling, just like good pasta should be. We enjoyed our lunch, but the service was pretty bad. After taking our drink orders and returning with our selections, our waitress said she'd give us a few more minutes to look over the menu as it was some people's first time there. After about ten minutes we had to flag her down to come take our order. And we were still the only people in the restaurant! After that she did pretty well keeping drinks filled and whatnot, but again had to be flagged down to get the check and again to take the payment. What should have been an hour long workday lunch turned into an hour and a half or more. I like a bit of pacing and appreciate when waiters don't try to get you in and out as quickly as possible, but I'd also like someone to be at least a little aware of timing in the other direction.So, in summary, I like Osteria Pronto for their good food and snazzy restaurant, but have a hard time loving them because of their slow service. I enjoyed both of my visits here, but don't plan on making it a regular stop."], ["Jon C.", "I stayed at the JW overnight recently and breakfast was included in my room rate. I had heard from others that the lines can get somewhat long on Sunday mornings, so I met some friends just before 8 am. Our party of 5 was seated immediately, although there were quite a few people waiting as we left.Breakfast had a decent selection, including a waffle and omelet station as well as your everyday breakfast items. I especially liked the salmon and fresh mozzarella cheese with a nice tangy mustard. Delicious.Our server was very attentive. Coffee, juice and water were refilled time and time again, and the dirty plates disappeared quickly. I doubt I'd wait in a long line for this breakfast, and I wouldn't visit specifically for it, but if I'm here on a Sunday morning again, I'll definitely check it out."], ["Lauren S.", "Quick service, delicious food! Starter bread is yummy, Salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus was great. Tiramisu for desert got two thumbs up! Came for devour downtown 2 people for $45 but will probably come back again! Can't wait to try the pizza."], ["Vicki E.", "Came here for breakfast. While there is a full menu, your best value is their buffet, which includes made to order omelets, muffins, fruit, scrambled eggs, bacon, etcetera - and includes juices and coffee.

I must return for dinner and breakfast before I leave this week."], ["David D.", "Food - 4 starAmbience - 3 starService - 3 starThe 3.5 average they have currently is accurate. If I were staying at the JW, this would be a great place to go. The place is nice looking and conveniently located. First thing I noticed, it was kinda loud. I was 20-30 feet away from the kitchen and could hear everything going on in there. Now my reason for going here is I live in Indy and was wanting to take my wife to a new restaurant near the canal that we'd never been to before. So we picked Osteria Pronto. We were seated promptly. Waiter came quickly. But that was the joke of the evening for my wife and I. He didn't stay at the table longer than an average \u00a05 seconds. It was like he was leaving as he confirmed the order. Not much of a relationship. Drinks show up. Perroni for me (can't screw that up), wine for the wife and before she can take the customary taste test the waiter pours the entire glass. Guess he had confidence in the glass of wine that she'd like it. Food was decent but confusing. Ordered what I thought was a side salad with my entree. Ended up being a dinner salad. Waiter didn't bother to tell me. Ended up after two drinks, two salads, and two entrees at $100. A bit higher than I was expecting, but given I had two dinners technically, I understand why it was so high. To be honest, unless Im staying at the JW anytime soon, we won't be back."], ["Mahrukh K.", "It was just okay. I expected fancier since it's in the JW Marriott. It was my husband's birthday and they seated our party by the kitchen which is open and in the middle. So it was pretty loud and our pictures at the table didn't have a good background. The pizza was soggy. The eggplant Parmesan was good. The service was slow. Nothing memorable."], ["Leo B.", "We came to Osteria Pronto for the Devour Downtown menu and were not disappointed. The portions were very large and we ended up taking home have of the Pollo and Pasta dishes. \u00a0The meatball starter was just the rights size to share for two. \u00a0The JW was 100% occupied and very busy, as the parking garage we were told was full and we needed to go across the street to park and then walk back over the skywalk to the restaurant. \u00a0We decided to try our luck in the Marriott garage and found a spot to park. \u00a0This is one of the downsides of the restaurant as it's at the mercy of the hotel when it comes to parking. \u00a0Despite a very full house, we were seated within 15 minutes of our reservation and escorted to a nice booth in the center of the restaurant. I give 5 stars to our waiter Joe-one of the best experiences we have had-just the right about of attentiveness and suggestions about the menu. Very pleasant demeanor. Proactively offered the parking voucher to compliment the parking costs."], ["Anthony G.", "Excellent service to start with. I had gotten in late from my flight and I was hungry and tired. The front desk whisked me to OP and they sat me down even though they were about to close. A Brit waiter was so sweet and brought me a Porcini Pizza with some orange peppers and it was divine (So was he). I had a glass of Pinot and a wonderful salad. Lunch was amazing! You must come here for a romantic night or a business lunch! Who knew Indiana had such a gem. The hotel also is exquisite! Such Grand Hotel service, I felt like Garbo!"], ["Joe U.", "Every part of the meal wes excellent from the sourdough bread with her bed olive oil thru the house salad, seafood carbonara.

Desmond and Brittany are the best bartenders. \u00a0Go see them first before eating...Sarah was my waitress and was very attentive. She helped me pick out a different veggie due to my dietary needs. \u00a0I can't say enough about how please I was with the service. The Lasagna was excellent!! It was different, light but on point. \u00a0Sea bass was also excellent. Love this place!"], ["Lucas W.", "Overall, the restaurant was ok. Nothing great or inspired but nothing bad either.Started with an interesting cocktail I hadn't seen before - the Godfather (amaretto di sarono and scotch) - but It was a strange combination and the two flavors mixed well but formed a rather strange tasting drink. I would not recommend this and would not get it again but I admit it was interesting to try the first time around.We started with the octopus salad. I've had octopus a number of times but this octopus just seemed rather soggy. I think it was a result of adding faaaaar to much lemon juice and slices of lemon. It had an strong lemon flavor while the octopus itself lacked the flavor it normally retains.For my entree I had the pappardelle. I would say the experience was somewhat similar to the octopus, it was ok, but not great. The lamb was the best part of dish. The pasta was pretty good, but the bolognese was pretty poor. It was salty and rather runny; it was especially poor sauce in comparison to the bolognese I had at Meridian Restaurant & Bar the other week which was superb.A friend got the ossubuco which came over risotto. He said the meat was great and I tried the risotto which was full of flavor so there are some good dishes on offer by the sounds of it."], ["Tia Noelle P.", "During a recent trip, I ate at Osteria Pronto twice and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.On my first visit, I had the breakfast buffet. \u00a0The comprehensive selection included an omelet station and waffle station. \u00a0The menu pricing seems designed to direct guests to the buffet rather than the a la carte menu. \u00a0For example, a glass of orange juice would be a whopping $5 if ordered from the a la carte menu. \u00a0Yet, it is included with the $19 price of the buffet. \u00a0I had an omelet with breakfast potatoes from the buffet line. \u00a0The freshly made omelet was hot, the eggs were cooked perfectly, and the cheese was perfectly melted.On my second visit, I had the Garganelli for dinner. \u00a0The pasta was perfectly al dente while the dish's other components: \u00a0sausage, tomatoes, shallots, and mushrooms were delicious thus making the dish wonderfully balanced and full of flavor.On both occasions, the service friendly and attentive. \u00a0If I'm in town, I would definitely go back to Osteria Pronto."], ["Charlotte S.", "Really nice hotel restaurant. If you are staying at the JW, this far surpasses most hotel options. Sea Bass was good and service was great. Not a standout, but definitely a solid choice!"], ["Ken B.", "Had the breakfast buffet here one morning. I'm a big fan of breakfast buffets and this one was just okay. To be fair, I didn't try the omelette bar, which others told me was pretty good.The service was a little slow but they were busy. The server charged me twice by mistake and luckily I caught it. \u00a0She was very apologetic and I appreciated her sincerity.I'll give it another try in the future."], ["Stefan M.", "Uhhhh....I was so hoping this place would be SO much better than it was, in both food and service...No such luck :(I went to Osterio Pronto on a Sunday evening with a party of 10. We had reservations and the table iteslf was great (FYI if you have a party of this size or larger, try to get the private dining room in the back). We all decided to meet here after a Colts game but before a concert over at the lawn at White River. We had 2 hours planned for dinner and without us \"coaxing\" the staff we would of never been able to get out of here on time.For the food, I decided to try the Osterio mixed greens salad. It was OK...JUST OK. For $7.99 this should of been a more robust salad in either quality or size but it was little with mixed greens, some shaved parm and some uber crunchy croutons. maybe worth $3.99. I also ordered the chicken and carmelied onion pizza. Being that their wood burning pizza oven is so prominent right when you walk in I was definiley excited to try their piza. Their pizza selection on the menu was pretty scarce but covered the basics. Then the pizza arrived it was a littled charred (which I dont mind) so I was expecting to have a nice wood fire pizza that I could pick up...No luck. Every piece was soggy and limp and the chicken looked like it came from a can, so much so that I thought that there wasnt any chicken on my pizza. I only ended up munching on the crust and that was just because I was hungry.Others in my party had the Lemon Butter Veal (which was described as decent food for a nursing home by the person who ended up eating it), the Osso Bucco (which was a little greasy but the best thing at the table), the Mezze Penne with sausage (which was accompinied by a pool of grease at the bottom of the bowl) and the sea bass which none of the 3 people that ordered it finished. In fact the only plate that was cleaned at our table was the spaghetti and meatballs that the person who ordered commented that the pasta was good but the meatballs had no taste.Other notes:It is my feeling that since we had a larger party, our server felt that he had already earned his tip just by us showing up since they automatically add gratuity for larger parties. We had multiple bottles of wine and beers ordered initially but when it came time check in on us for refills and such our server was no where to be found, so much that one of our party went and tracked our server down to get a round of refills.This is physically, a beautiful and comfortable resturant in an amazing hotel but super sub par food and service.PLEASE NOTE: We did have drinks in the bar in front of the resturant prior to our reservation and the bartenders, servers and staff were SUPER friendly and helpful. I would definitley return just to get drinks.My ending thought:When walking out of Osterio Pronto on our way to the lawn at White River I just remeber thinking a staement I have never thought in my life and it was echoed by multiple people in our party, that comment, \u00a0\"We should of just gone to TGIFridays!\""], ["David Y.", "I'm torn as to how I should rate this restaurant. \u00a0The atmosphere and service was excellent. \u00a0I had the best chicken soup I've ever had at a restaurant here followed by some of the best spaghetti I've ever eaten in a restaurant. \u00a0Even the after dinner coffee was to die for. \u00a0However...Afterwards, I got violently ill and spent the night vomiting. \u00a0Not what I wanted to do all night before a major trade show. \u00a0I rated this restaurant a 4 instead of 5 because of the vomiting, which might have been just a fluke, but barring the food poisoning, this place is a 5."], ["Lane C.", "Food was great, service was amazing, and the atmosphere was beyond inviting. \u00a0My fiance and I stopped here for dinner and it was a surprisingly fantastic restaurant."], ["Carlos H.", "Excellent service and food.

Food was okay, though we were there close-ish to closing time, so that could've explained the so-so experience. The arancini di risk were flavorful, though sort of room temperature--as was the pizza giardino. Could definitely taste the truffle oil but tasted sort of like a pre-frozen pizza. The cocktails were just okay, but the wine selection was nice. The prosecco--from California at the time--was interesting--different than other proseccos I've tried. If you're in the area and want a decent bite, this would be a fine place to go."], ["David H.", "Located in the JW Marriott hotel, this is a very good venue for Italian and American cuisine. My colleagues and some business partners visited for lunch. I had an eggplant sandwich while the others had either salads or chicken parm. All done very well. We opted for the house made sparkling water as well which was a good choice. Only issue we had was with the bill. We were charged the dinner price for the lunch branzino which I caught and it was quickly corrected."], ["Kavitha D.", "*DEVOUR DOWNTOWN REVIEW*Came here last night with a friend for their devour downtown experience. My friend and I are not Italian restaurant fans (Olive Garden and Buca Di Beppo should die), but we looked at their menu and it wasn't filled with disgusting Chicken Alfredo and Breadsticks, so we thought we'd try it.We were pleasantly surprised!! We had the meatball appetizer, my friend had the chicken entre, and I had the salmon entre. For dessert we shared a tiramisu (one of my FAVORITE desserts).All of the food was very good, the mashed potatoes were really buttery, but whatever, it's mashed potatoes. I really enjoyed the tiramisu as well.Based on my devour downtown experience here, I'd definitely go back and try other things on their menu, and would recommend it to others!(Also had their devour downtown cocktail which was a bourbon drink, super yummy!)"], ["Vijay V.", "Well, unless you like to wait, don't bother to go in to this restaurant. I waited 10 minutes to order my drink and I never got to the point where I can order the food. It took the waitress forever to come to me as she was making drinks for other customers. I left the place after one drink. And guess what!!!! When I wanted to check out, I had to wait for another 5 minutes. Really bad customer service."], ["Kila O.", "The calamari is the best I have ever had! \u00a0Seriously how do you improve on this starter? \u00a0But they did.

If I were booked in any hotel with Osteria Pronto off the lobby, I would be very pleasantly surprised.Caveat: I was here for Devour Downtown, but the rest of the menu is not particularly adventuresome. The bread with the electric green pesto was yummy, and the green salad with the out-of-season strawberries was a fine salad. The roasted chicken was delicious, the garganelli rich and cheesy, the tiramisu perfectly delightful. All in all a very typical and perfectly serviceable American-Italian restaurant. I loved sitting by the big, open kitchen and would return again. (By the way, the lobby bar at the J. W. Marriott -- where you can also order from Osteria Pronto -- is super cool.)"], ["Kevin B.", "Hard to make a dining experience much better...

Give it a try for a nice meal if you're in town."], ["Robert G.", "Blah pizza, and not very authentic."], ["Deborah B.", "My first experience at Osteria Pronto was at an Elite event quite a while back. \u00a0I was highly impressed with the food and always meant to return for dinner. \u00a0For some weird reason, it took me this long to return, and a few weeks ago, we took advantage of Devour Downtown. \u00a0First off:Our server was excellent, attentive, gracious, friendly and informative. \u00a0You could tell she had been at it a while, and actually liked her job and, and likes people. First criteria for anyone in the service industry should be that they love people, or at least do an excellent job of convincing you they do.My dining companions and I ordered off the devour Downtown Menu, which was such an amazing value here!I had:Insalata di Pomodori e Mozarella-which is basically a caprese saladPollo Limone-Really good, mouth-watering good!!And finished with the Tiramisu for desert.There were four of us and we shared a couple of bottles of wine. \u00a0The only thing that I found underwhelming was the tiramisu. \u00a0I could probably do as well at home with some graham crackers, whipped cream, and a little sugar free pudding. \u00a0Ok well, maybe it wasn't that bad but was probably the worst approximation of a tiramisu I've had in a good long while.I love the ambiance, food, and again, our dining experience and server were well above average, despite having ordered off the DD menu. \u00a0Will return for sure."], ["Cindy M.", "The breAkfast Buffett is Amazing.

The waiter was very friendly and made sure my drinks were filled. I had chicken parmesan and it was filling and satisfying, with a nice touch of spice and garlic. The lunch portion was too big for me! So, they packaged it neatly up. Nice for a working lunch, free wifi for the public in the lobby, too!"], ["Tennyson M.", "I guess I hit this restaurant at the right time. I thought the food was imaginative and flavorful.

This restaurant clicked for me. I recommend highly."], ["Laura R.", "My significant other and I wanted Italian food, but we didn't want \u00a0Americanized Italian. After some research we decided \u00a0to try Osteria Pronto; it looked promising. I was impressed with the layout of the restaurant, even though it was located in a hotel. The atmosphere made you feel like you were in a fancy, upscale restaurant. The service was tremendous. The waiter was very informative, easygoing, and charming (he even played along when we joked about ordering an absurdly expensive Cognac). I was pleased with the food that we had ordered and the portions of the meals. They even served you bread with olive oil to eat while waiting on your food. \u00a0I recommend the gnocchi! The only concern I had was that we ordered the calamari for an appetizer thinking there would be a filling amount; but instead they served what seemed like a seafood platter. It only had two calamari and the rest was scallops and shrimp.Over all I recommend Osteria Pronto if you are in the mood for real Italian food. It is worth the price!"], ["Aaron P.", "I didn't visit the restaurant, but I did find use of the bar during my stay in Indianapolis since it was in the hotel where the event I was attending was being held. In general, it's pricey and nothing too special. The hotel is fairly fancy, and so is the atmosphere in this bar, which is an extension of the hotel's lobby.I tried two cocktails here. One was a vodka soda, which for some reason was too sweet for my tastes. I actually had the bartender check to make sure she didn't make me a vodka tonic instead, but she insisted it was club soda, not tonic.The other cocktail I had was a \"Ginger Crush,\" which had cucumber vodka, lemon juice, cucumber, finer, strawberries, and simple syrup. For the life of me I couldn't' taste the ginger. It tasted like a strawberry daiquiri. When asked how I was doing, I told the server this, and she seemed concerned and came back with another one, which was nice. However, the next one tasted exactly the same. Not bad, just not gingery at all. Again, the server was very cordial about this, and overall the interaction was pleasant.If this place wasn't so pricey, and if the drinks fit the descriptions, I could see giving it four stars, but the only reason to go to this bar instead of one of the myriad other options in the area is if you're staying at, or attending an event at, the hotel, or if you just really dig the vibe of the place."], ["Aaron W.", "We came here for the first time during Devour Downtown and the meal was really quite lovely, as well as the service. The chef's take on tiramisu was the standout.Other than that one dinner, it is all about the daily breakfast buffet.I like to consider myself a Master of Breakfast Buffets. I have actually almost (almost!) grown tired of them from my trips to Hawaii. Lately, it has been a nice breakfast of Kona coffee and manapua or poi donuts. \u00a0However, this buffet is actually just as good if not better than ANY buffet at the resorts of Hawaii and has rejuvenated my dwindling passion for the Art. This includes Four Seasons Hualalai, Royal Hawaiian, Grand Wailea, Sheraton Waikiki, Fairmont Orchid, Turtle Bay, Kauai Marriot, Moana Surfrider, Ritz Carlton Kapalua or even the JW Marriott Ihilani.Here is why: The scrambled eggs at this buffet just get me. They are creamy and fluffy at each of the many times I have visited. No Hawaiian buffet has matched this. The waffle/omellette station has always churned out the most perfect waffles. The breakfast meats are well cooked and everything is held/replenished perfectly.Oh, grab one of those great Nutella packets near the toast station to spread over your fruited and buttered waffles. Also, top your luxurious scrambled eggs with some diced onion, tomato and capers from the smoked salmon/cold meats section."], ["Ashley R.", "I had dinner here and everything was good. The red wine from Chianti is amazing. I had the roasted chicken dinner the meat was juicey and flavorful it came with asparagus, potatoes and artichokes. It was very good!!

Ah well..."], ["Binnan O.", "Ambiance: The new Marriot is a beautiful building with tons of glass letting in lots of light. The ceilings are high and gradiose with clean edges and tasteful pairing of metals and woods. The restaurant is equally modern with an open-kitchen you can see from your comfy booth. Service here is very friendly although our server sometimes lacked a little common sense. When we asked for extra bread, she obliged but brought only one plate of olive oil for dipping for the whole table. When we ordered dessert to celebrate a graduation, they spoke with the chef and he made a custom-made platter with ice-cream, berries, a mini molten-lava cake plated with the word 'congratulations' on it but the server only brought 2 spoons, again, for the 4 of us. The staff was overall great and obliging, however.Food: I got the crab cake thinking to share it with someone but was surprised to see it was only a single crab cake. It was one of the most delicious crab cakes I've had served on a succulent portabello and bed of lettuce lightly touched by the tangy sauces adorning the plate. My fiance's grandparents had the caprese salad which was consisted of 4 large slices of tomato covered in thick slices of fresh mozarella and basil. I had the lamb shank with lamb sausage, potatoes, and grilled vegetables. The dish was excellent, the shank was cooked perfectly medium rare and served with a savory pan sauce. The sausage moist and tender as well. The issue for some might be that you basically get 2 lamb ribs, half a sausage, and perhaps a cup of veges all in all.Osteria pronto is flat out delicious, the dishes are extremely well-executed and cooked to perfection.

Fresh tomatoes and crostinis that weren't overly difficult to chomp down on. \u00a0Official Round Due:Cornish hen with polenta cakes, pearl onions, carrot spears and green beans. Smart portion size - I especially enjoyed the polenta cakes, the fact that I'm a sucker for all things cornmeal might factor into this. Official Round Tre:Strawberry tart with foamed sugar (fancy code language for whipped cream). Very light and refreshing - the tart's shell was even all sorts of flaky deliciousness. I am sure they were very busy with the Devour Downtown crowd, but the service was a bit on the slow side. Which, I might add, added to the feel of the Italian theme. So, I'm not complaining too much:) I spent 6 months living a few miles from where Chef Rino Baglio was working (Lago di Como in northern Italy).

No wine suggestions given. \u00a0Appetizer comes, bread basket remains on the table. \u00a0Salad and entrees arrive, basket and now appetizer items are still on the table. \u00a0Kaitlyn has not returned. \u00a0Not to ask how we are, refresh our drinks, ask how the appetizer was, nothing. \u00a0Now I need another cocktail, thank goodness i'm not shy so when she was walking by I asked for a drink. \u00a0I get my drink. \u00a0Still no removing of any dishes at all, its all still on our table. \u00a0I go outside my friends get their dessert, still all the plates, seeing a theme here? \u00a0When the dessert arrived one friend asks her name, because of course I have already commented that YELP here I come...lol \u00a0She looks at him like a deer in headlights, since let's face it she knows she has done messed up with this table, and reluctantly gives her name. \u00a0Bills are brought by drive by, whoosh now you see her now you don't whoosh. \u00a0Thank God my friends and I can enjoy anything as long as the company is good, and it was. \u00a0And the service was so bad it became comical by the end of the night. \u00a0But Kaitlyn, oh dear Kaitlyn, you did ruin my first trip to the JW and I will never return to Osteria Pronto."], ["Ingrid W.", "never thought we would find such great Italian food in Indianapolis!! mark, our waiter, was very good as well.

We ordered the calamari , it was a large portion of thinly sliced zucchini and sweet potatoes and a small amount of calamari. The calamari was cooked and seasoned perfectly but the veggies were overly salted. We also ordered the risotto balls. They were $9 for three tiny balls. They were good, but come on rice is cheap! Make them a little larger or add a few! The bread and pesto dip was really good. Now for our main courses, the girls ordered the gnocchi and was it ever good! The chunks of mozzarella floating in the sauce were it for me! The guys had lasagna and Penne- they said they were just so so. Nothing they would order again.

Seriously....if you don't want to participate in DD then don't. And if you do participate, instruct the servers to minimize the sighs when you ask for the menu. 2) \u00a0The server was just downright awful. He took 2 stars away just for his lack of attention, enthusiasm, and manners. He completely ignored my 10-year old son, who goes to restaurants weekly and is not only capable of ordering his own meals but is also quite opinionated about how he would like his food to be prepared. My husband and I received dessert as part of the DD deal, but my son was never asked if he would like dessert so when the \"adult\" dessert showed up at the table it was a bit awkward to have to ask for a menu and then wait to eat (or eat in front of him). Also, his extra food was cleared with no chance for us to ask for the leftovers to be boxed. This is not only rude but wasteful. 3) The bread and pesto dipping sauce was fantastic. The meatball ap was also very good, but a spoon for the sauce would have been nice. My chicken was good, it was perfectly cooked and the sauce was nice. However, it just wasn't memorable. My husband's lasagne was ok, but there was a very heavy hand with the bachemel, almost as if someone was trying to make the dish look more substantial but instead the whole thing ended up a bit bland. The tiramisu was very nice, not too liquidy. The doughnuts that my son was finally able to order were fantastic. Overall, I would be willing to try the food again but the service makes me want to run away screaming."], ["Guy R.", "We had an enjoyable dinner.

I had an almost immediate response to my post here from the hotel manager and the food service manager. They spent time and energy to address my thoughts on my experience and to rectify my experience. They were attentive, and listened to every detail of my experience here and worked to understand details. I do believe, based on their attention to my concerns, that they will learn from my experience and place adequate processes to mitigate the issues that I experienced. I was not planning on returning to either the hotel or restaurant, but I will now due to their willingness to listen to my concerns and their genuine dedication to make things excellent. Based on my experience, I did not expect this result. In fact, I was convinced that the management was not \u00a0concerned based on my initial experience.

Considering the concern from the management, I have changed that to 3, and look forward to making it more based on my next stay!What follows is my initial experience.Food-below average. I tried the salmon which was a bit overcooked and had a tomato based topping that was dry and took away from the dish. The asparagus were discolored between a pale green and white, and the fingerling potatoes were grainy and drenched with oil which considering this could have been a healthy dish, missed the mark.The minestrone soup was about as good as you can get from a can. Nothing to write home about, and certainly nothing to reorder. Finally, I ate at the bar ordering from the restaurant menu. The bar tenders were horrible at customer service. There were five of us in our group. Only 3 orders came out correct, one never came at all, and one was completely wrong.

First things first, the food: I loved the bread basket. YUM.I had the calamari as an appetizer and I just didn't think it was very special. It was rubbery (eww!) and just not that good. My main was the gnocchi. And I have to say, it was delicious. Many might find it salty, but I loved it. I finished it all. It was lovely. I was too full for dessert, but if I ever go back I'll skip the appetizer so I can have dessert. And now, the service. If you've read my reviews you know I'm big on service. It matters. And at OP, it was just overbearing, a little snooty, not well-timed, and overall, not what I expected. What was even crazier was that the waiter wanted to treat my table as if we were at some fine-dining, chic chic establishment, when at the table next to me, there was a baby literally wailing for about 2 hours. It was the oddest thing. Funnily enough, the person I assume was the manager came over to see how they were doing (the couple with the baby) but never stopped to see how we were.

Breakfast- well priced and has decent food. I was especially pleased to see bagels, lox and creem cheese. An omelet station as well as eggs to order and scrambled eggs on the buffett. Not a terrible selection. The bacon is thick sliced and tender- not crunchy as I typically find in warming trays. Dinner- The Cabrice salad was good- I'd get it over the salads I saw at the table. HUGE portion, more than enough for 2 people. The Osso Bucco was tender and very tasty, but I've never had that dish before, so I can't speak to the overall quality. I can tell you- Gordan Ramsey would throw a FIT over their risotto- it was bland, overly gummy and cold. I love risotto and typically seek it out on menues (it was the reason I picked this dish), so I know what it's supposed to be like- this fell way short.

I didn't touch it, I drank my OJ and never got around to the DC. The next time I asked for ice- but still drank the OJ only. Not uncommon for me to do at breakfast places. The third time, I was told \"we don't have Coke- we have Pepsi\".

It all paired perfectly with the plum-y Chianti I ordered, which was advertised as having notes of \"chocolate dusted cherry\" and \"steep espresso\". \u00a0Very specific flavor observations? Yes, but who cares...order the quartino size and enjoy.The best part about Napolese is its lovely, unique seasonal salads. The selection changes with the season, barring a few permanent offerings (chopped, Caesar, etc). \u00a0For autumn, it was almost impossible to choose between salads offering roasted brussel sprouts, squash, kale, and pear, but I \"settled\" on a beautifully tasting salad composed of roasted beets, rosemary-pecan brittle, apple, arugula, and goat cheese. The rosemary brittle was out of this world, and I would have ordered a bag of it separately if I could.We visited early on a weekday night, so this smaller location did not feel as cramped as more busy nights and we got to comfortably spread out over a 4-top.

I had been to the Napolese at Keystone at the Crossing but had yet to venture to this one nestled on 49th St. Well by golly, this place is just splendid. I am a lover of pizza. Honestly - give me pizza and I'm a happy gal. But as I've gotten older and have tried many pizzas, I'm starting to truly be drawn to the thin crust selections. I mean come on - that's how Italy does it and now we all know why. It's just delicious that way. But before I get to the pizza, I'd like to spend some time on the salad - the vegetable chopped salad. It's big enough to split, so keep that in mind. I'm all about a good salad and this option was quite good. A bit salty for my taste, but still good enough that I ate my portion. ;) The pizza - the margherita pizza. Oh yes, the one that never fails to disappoint. In a \"Hot Box/Papa Johns\" scenario, I always, always, always go with the pepperoni. I just can't help myself. But when I spend a bit more on my pizza, I can't help but try a beautiful, well made margerhita. And this place has it. Service? Spot on! No complaints this time around, so I'll definitely be back. :)"], ["Katie U.", "My previous review just doesn't do Napolese justice. Their food is simply divine!Fave appetizer: baked goat cheese in tomato sauce with warm bread for dipping/spreading (foccacia?) The salads: the bomb. The vegetarian chop is a fave, but this visit my obsession was the salad with arugula, artichokes, strawberries, smoked mozzarella, toasted pecans, drizzled w/ a strawberry vinaigrette. Perfection. The pizza: even better than the salads. Go for the classic margherita and and Meridian Kessler (sausage + provolone + mushrooms). Most pizzas are thin crust FYI!Don't forget dessert! The Nutella pizza is FAB and a crowd favorite, but it is definitely big enough to split w/ 3-4 people.

If I could give zero stars for ambience I would. \u00a0My advice: \u00a0order out. \u00a0Pick up the B.L.T or Meridian Kessler pizza, try the salad of the day, and grab a bottle of Raymond Cabernet on the way. \u00a0Then watch Homeland and eat."], ["Caroline L.", "I'm impressed. The food and the customer service were both great. I was that girl to walk in with three small needy children, and they definitely made our dining experience go as smoothly as possible. They even gave the kids a couple pieces of pizza dough to play with while we waited for our food. As for the food, the portions were pretty large, but delicious. We had plenty of leftover pizza to bring back home. I ordered the peach salad which was enough to serve 2 hungry adults, but I was happy to bring that home as well. Overall, good experience. I will be back!"], ["Ronak S.", "How did I manage to eat pizza in Indianapolis before Napolese opened? It's hard to get one anywhere else anymore. If they had a totally lame bumper-sticker, it would be \"high end taste with a family price!\" Considering the inspired cuisine, variegated menu, and local sourcing, the place is affordable without sacrificing quality. This place is a cozy living room compared to the high-ceiling urban style of the downtown location -- especially if you snag a seat in the wine bar. While the low-seating is a bit cumbersome for a short guy like me, it's still real cushy. Although the menus are constantly shifting in accordance with what's in season and the whims of the chef, the salads and appetizers are always fantastic, and there's always at least one pie I wish I'd ordered two of. I don't care much for the complimentary olives as starters, and I never order the sandwiches, but the menu is definitely designed to cater to multiple pallets. including folks who many not otherwise be as excited by the more eclectic options available.Last tidbit: I highly recommend getting quail eggs and greens on just about any of their pies. Because why not?"], ["Samantha P.", "I am kinda obsessed with the concept that is Napolese. Gourmet pizza with a variety of interesting toppings cooked in front of guests in a big oven. And the best part is, the food is just as good as the concept!My husband and I have been to Napolese twice now, once at the downtown location and once at this location. I would definitely consider myself a fan. The first time we actually went during Devour Downtown and had a great experience. The baked goat cheese appetizer was amazing and we enjoyed our drinks and pizzas. On our second visit, we didn't have time for an appetizer and promptly ordered beer and pizza. The place was packed and we had to sit at the bar top, which was fine since we were in a bit of a hurry. Our server was able to pick up on this and was great in accommodating us. He even refilled our olives while we waited, which by the way are super addicting! And this is coming from someone who doesn't really love olives. The pizzas took longer than we expected this time, to no fault of our server, I could tell he was trying to keep an eye on all his tables and the pizzas coming out. We got them and they were great. I love having eggs on pizza [both regular and quail are available, I have had both, both are very good] \u00a0and the bacon on the BLT pizza was drool-worthy. We asked our server to bring our checks and a box when he had a chance and he quickly helped us get checked out so we could leave whenever. This was helpful and I was impressed by the service. There are two things I am not in love with when it comes to Napolese. One, they don't allow you to change out any of their pre-made options, which is fine. However, if you were to go and build your own pizza with more than one topping, it gets super pricey fast, which is a bummer. Because of this, I tend to stick to their pre-made ideas. Second, why are the two locations I have visited so for SO SMALL? Especially the downtown location. I am guessing they want to keep it intimate feeling but it is such a bummer when you have crowded tables and very limited seating options. It discourages me from visiting because you have no idea how long you may have to wait. They could have so much more business!"], ["Zenobia W.", "Can someone take me here right now for dinner? Napolese is as good as it gets and I hope that statement doesn't sound generic. Simply put: fresh produce, quality meats (judging by appearance as I don't consume meat), ever rotating pizzas/salads so you can always get something new, and honestly as cheesy at it sounds, this one has a very sensuous aura about it. Dim lighting and eclectic beer/wine choices? Date night anyone? I never order the same thing! And they have affogato on their dessert menuuu. I could cry. For those that are unaware of the term, it's a scoop of gelato with a bitter espresso shot poured over the top. Yes and yes. Also just thinking about the sun-dried tomatoes on their Buffalo Margherita makes my mouth water.

This restaurant has a very unique and cozy atmosphere. Not only that but a very unique pizza style with very unique toppings. The pizza that I chose had leeks, bacon from goose the markets and goat cheese on it. It's not something that you want every day but it's nice for a different occasion. The service wasn't very fast at all. \u00a0I think we waited for 45 minutes for pizza.

The salads, however, are my absolute favorite. They are in deep bowls with lots of interesting toppings that work well together.

If you're not from Indy you might not stumble upon it. Nestled next to it's sibling restaurant, Cafe Patachou, in the Martha Hoover empire it makes for a corner of deliciousness at 49th and Pennsylvania. There is a plethora of great food options, and gelato (after all, Gelo is now next door). There is also a back room now, they offered as the \"adult\" room (read: bar space I assume. So you likely have to be 21?) where we ate last time in comfortable stuffed arm chairs. Yes, please. Okay, so for the food? Delicious. Capriole Goat Cheese appetizer? Yes. A multitude of pizzas which are all great. From the simple and delicious broken yolk (I prefer the one with quail eggs) and the classic (with Smoking Goose pepperoni), to slightly more out there and seasonal options like pizzas with salsa verde and chicken or the sticky icky bbq... they've got it all. With ingredients sourced locally. Oh, and they do a dessert pizza with Nutella drizzle and you can get gelato with it. So, you're going to need to try that. They have italian sodas made with or without cream, and the chocolate or cherry are particularly delicious and made with Monin syrup. I've never been disappointed here, and I'll continue to come back. Oh, and if you're gluten free, they have a crust that can accommodate that too and are sure to ask for food allergies when serving you."], ["Desmond W.", "Regarding this restaurant, one word comes to my mind: spectacular!Now go and enjoy one of Indy's finest gems.

I love the chop salad as well, and you're crazy if you don't end with a gelato affogato. They have a wide variety of flavors, and even more gelato options in their next door shop.The wine options are fantastic, and the staff is generally quite knowledgable. My preference is to sit in the wine bar area. It's much more quiet and chilled out. The other section tends to get very noisy, not necessarily because the patrons are loud, but it's something about the design of the room. If you have kids, that's your area, and it's perfectly fine.

It gets the lighting just right and I love the wood tables. It feels sexy but rustic. It's cramped though, so if you go on a busy night, you're going to stand awkwardly in the doorway... and because the interior is so intimate (cramped), expect it to be loud on a busy night. However, in the summer months, you can relax at a sidewalk table and not struggle to hear your dinnermates.The food here is tops. Everything I've had has been delicious. Of particular note - the pepperoni tastes amazing, but it's cut into long, chunky pieces, so don't expect to see thin circles like everywhere else. It's definitely something you'll have to chew through. The goat cheese appetizer is also amazing. It arrives as one hot, delicious mess of gooey cheese covered in bubbling marinara... served alongside is a basket of bread for dipping. One the bread basket is empty, save your crock of cheesy, tomato sauce leftovers for dipping your pizza crusts.Also, ask your server about ingredients that might not be on the menu. When I asked, I found out that they had an appetizer that included a spicy sliced sausage from Smoking Goose Meatery. I substituted that for pepperoni on my pizza and it was a fabulous decision."], ["Patrick H.", "Saturday night we went with friends. I love the food at Napolese, but had stopped going because of the noise. (YOU CAN'T HEAR THE PERSON ACROSS THE TABLE FROM YOU!, she shouts. ESPECIALLY WHEN SEATED NEXT TO THE WINDOW!) We would've enjoyed the quieter atmosphere at the wine bar, but one of the party was under 21 so that was not possible. We walked over, expecting to show a nice neighborhood restaurant and hoping to eat outside to avoid the noise, but we were forced to duck in and take (sigh) a window table when it began raining. I gave up trying to hear the guest across from me and had her talk to my husband, who was next to her, then he would shout over to me. Often he couldn't hear her after asking her to repeat a couple of times, so we just shrugged and smiled.MARTHA HOOVER: HAVE YOU SAT IN YOUR OWN RESTAURANT (PARTICULARLY NEXT TO THE WINDOW) AND TRIED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION? TURN DOWN THE MUSIC. TURN IT DOWN!!!!!!!!!We started with the table's provision of olives: pitted kalamata and green olives in a \"Mediterranean\" marinade. We were a bit disappointed. They used to serve a nice variety of olives, some with pits, some hard green olives, some really salty oil-cured wrinkly black olives, and others. This assortment was boring, it was a bowl of Offend-No-One olives. Not the surprising mix of a couple of years ago. For the first time we did not finish our olives.We followed with the goat cheese with tomato sauce appetizer and the creamed corn appetizer (both served with strips of the same bread used for pizzas). Both were good, though in mid September, the corn was starchy and did not taste like just-picked summer corn. The roasted beet salad was good but didn't wow me as it has in the past; the walnuts tasted a bit old, having taken on a slightly rancid flavor. But maybe that was a reflection of the oil they were toasted in. Regardless, if this had been my first time eating the roasted beet salad, which has been one of my favorite dishes since I first tried it, I wouldn't try it again. We enjoyed the tomato-artichoke soup very much.My favorite pizza is the smoked salmon, and it didn't disappoint. The Casanova's Delight with prosciutto and taleggio cheese was good but too salty for Casanova to accomplish anything after eating this but drink most of the night away.Food was good.

My husband absolutely hated his dinner. The chopped salad wasn't really chopped and had strange ingredients that he didn't appreciate. I thought it was fine, but I could see why he thought it needed to be chopped more. I really liked the buffalo mozarella pizza and the smoked salmon was ok. He thought the smoked salmon pizza was disgusting, but I think he just doesn't like the idea of smoked salmon on pizza. In any case, the pizza is thin crust and tastes almost like flat bread rather than pizza crust. The absolute worst was the peach cobbler. Maybe they were working with a terrible peach.. but I have never had a peach dessert that lacked so much flavor before. I didn't think it was possible to make a peach dessert that bad.

I'm not sure how artisanal pizza means you can have large topping chucks clustered all over the pizza and call it good. The crust has an excellent chew-to-crunch ratio, in my judgment. \u00a0The sausage chunks are too big and all to often two pieces of pizza have no toppings and two are absolutely covered with toppings and the rest in between. The ham pieces are like large sheets of ham, often not cut correctly and only included on some slices. Every pizza I've had here we end up cutting and sharing toppings among each other so we all get to try the toppings. It makes it more difficult that when toppings are clustered the cheese is clustered too. Think about how fun it is to cut up and redistribute cheese and toppings. GagMushrooms and tomatoes are too large as toppings and the create a wet pizza that makes me want to gag. The large toppings and sauce don't even come close to the edge, I'd guess roughly 60% toppings and 40% crust. I think the large toppings prevent the crush/dough from cooking evenly; this compounds the problem with oversized wet toppings that never cook then just leech out the water and soak the pizza, as previously mentioned. I do find it hard to complain about pizza. On one hand it is pizza so it is good--right?!?!. My experience here, though, has been frustration every time."], ["K G.", "I'm visiting from out of town so I've only eaten here once (and it was takeout). I thought the pizza was a bit overrated.

It would have been a little better if the music was more instrumental and less of today's pop hits that you get so sick of hearing on the radio everyday.As far as service went, it wasn't bad but it didn't blow me away. Our server never told us her name, and didn't seem to really try to make us comfortable or connect with us as her customers. She didn't really become attentive until after we got our food, but she gave me a wine sample that she thought I'd enjoy with the pie I got (which I did!) Without my asking so that was really nice and thoughtful.The food: most important part for me of course. I would say it was better than average, but nothing mindblowingly delicious. As an app we got the garlic artichokes with pistachios and parmesan which came with cheesy bread. It was just so-so. The artichokes weren't very warm. For main course I got the BLT (smoking goose jowel bacon, caramelized leeks and taleggio) the best part of everything was the jowl bacon. Holy heaven I'm definitely hitting up Smoking goose to buy a few pounds of this thick chewey bacony perfection to make for myself. I tried some of my friend's pie, the hamaker's corner, which was good but I liked mine more (that jowl bacon was seriously to die for guys) And being the bacon loving freak that I am, I got the Gewurztraminer wine to drink -very sweet, like a moscato, but had a smoky bacony flavor. It was excellent.It is a bit pricey if you split an app, get your own pie and a glass of wine (well over $20 a person) but the ingredients were all very unique and fun to try. I'd probably go back on a date or something, but next time I get a pizza craving this probably wont be the first place that comes to mind.

The high ceilings and gorgeous hardwood floors made for a loud space, but it was worth it for the yummy, high-quality food (expected and delivered!).The only thing that I could even possibly complain about is the overly attentive staff.

My favorite creation so far has been the pesto, goat cheese, spinach. I crave this like a pregnant lady craves pickles!

I hadn't eaten a pizza like that in a while and was so excited for the opportunity. I ended up ordering the Buffalo Margherita \"Rachael\" style. Holy cow was this a work of art. The crust was beautifully crispy on the bottom and soft on the top. The sauce was perfect and the warm mozzarella cheese made from buffalo milk was perfetto! There were tomato pieces on top that had gotten roasted while baking in the oven, and they turned out wonderfully tart and sweet at the same time. The fresh basil on top just set the tone perfectly. And then I went and brought it up another notch by adding the dressed arugula on top. Many pizzas in Italy are served this way, and it was one of my most favorite things. I was so happy to be able to revisit that wonderfully zesty topping.My boyfriend ended up getting the Broken Yolk pizza with Quail eggs, and that looked equally as delicious and something that is in the queue for me next time.I cannot wait to come back and try some foccacia and also some more pizza!

Recently, I visited the downtown location and the waiter was rude to me because I wasn't familiar with Italian wines. I was especially disappointed because I was hoping to learn more, but felt that I was treated like I was stupid. The pizza itself has good toppings but felt soggy in the center.

Create your own pasta bar is so fresh and amazing. About 20 items to choose from and it is cooked right in front of you. The salad, soup and dessert bar which is included is great. Awesome meal for about $10. I eat here several times a month. Service is really good too. Yelp lists the pricing at $$$$. I disagree. I would list it at $$.

During the event, I had a second try at the Fresco Italian Cafe. I like the frozen Italian Ice here on a hot day. However, it was great to taste their sandwiches and flatbread. I did like the Italian Beef sandwich and Meatball sandwich (eaten it prior to the event) I had. The gondola ride from Old World Gondoliers was the highlight of the event for me. I was able to learn more about the gondolas we all see and pass on the canal, such as the story on how each boat came to Indy, or general parts of the gondola. For instance, do you know its tradition for the gondola to be painted black, for for weddings, it an be painted white but painted back to back as soon as the wedding is over? Plus, our guide sang to us! I also learned the this Indy business is the #1 spot for marriage prospals (guess my love missed the memo - just kidding). They have a dinner boat which is smaller as well. The seasons start Mothers Day weekend, have a ride during the 4th of July fireworks, and last ride for the season is Halloween. Overall, this event was able to highlight some great features of the canal. I think everyone to take a gondola ride as an Indy bucket list item :) Afterwards, grab a cold or hot treat from the Fresco Italian Cafe."], ["Ntianu S.", "My review is a bit skewed because I was in the process of detoxing during this event, so I could not fully enjoy the delightful lunch provided by Fresco Italian Cafe.

They truly rolled out a magnificent and unique menu for Yelpers. Flatbreads, spiked Italian Ice, and a magnificent DIY S'mores. Such a unique spread! What I can properly comment on is the incredible Gondola ride around the canal provided by Old World Gondoliers. What a treat! I've wanted to go on a gondola ride for the longest. Fortunately, the rain subsided and we were off. It was truly a relaxing experience chatting it up with other Yelpers, enjoying the beauty of the canal, and even getting a bit of a history lesson from our gondola guide. Not to mention, some sweet tunes provided by our awesome guide as well. I seriously could not have asked for a better day.

I liked the flatbread as an appetizer, but the chicken parmesan sandwich was delicious! You know what was even bette than the sandwich? The Italian smores with pizzelle cookies and milk chocolate with almonds. You know what was even better than that (barely)? The spiked Italian lemon ice!

I love the downtown canal. I used to work downtown and loved walking there and also spending my lunch breaks just sitting by the water. It was totally worth taking the day off so we could have lunch and get the chance to ride on a Gondola! We did stress a little about parking. We ended up in a $5 lot, which worked out and was just across the street from the staircase down to the canal. I thought we would use street parking, but we weren't sure if the machine took credit card and only had .85. The lot we parked in needed exact change as well since it was un-manned. We definitely should have planned ahead. But it all worked out and were immediately welcomed by the staff of Fresco Italian Cafe on the Canal. This is seriously the cutest place ever! In the nicer months I love sitting outside and being by the water is a huge plus. I loved how cute it all was. It's so nice to enjoy your lunch and people watch at the canal. We went inside to order and it was a tough choice, but I went the Italian Beef which is their specialty. I honestly hadn't heard of this place, but I really think the sandwich was really good. I had half and it was filling. I added the cheese and it came with chips. I got it wet so it was perfect and not messy. I had the Lemon Italian ice with Skyy Vodka and it was quiet refreshing! And after lunch we had the s'more's. It was super cool that we could make them right at our table. I love using the Pizzelle as the base to my s'more. I actually liked it better than graham crackers. It was soft and not crumbly. We also had some nice quality chocolate bars. It was a nice treat! Next up was our Gondola ride! \u00a0I have always wanted to do the gondola rides since they first came to Indy. I am so glad we got the chance. I think it was such a nice and relaxing ride. Our gondolier told us the history of the canal and was very knowledgeable about the canal. He also sang Italian songs! \u00a0It was picture perfect. I really think actually being in the canal and being guided down the canal is very close to being in Venice, but in our own backyard. Save on airfare and take a gondola ride in downtown Indy!"], ["Amy C.", "What a fun lunch! I brought my daughter with me for her first elite event. Fresco staff were so nice and the food was awesome. They started us off with flatbreads which were very good. I liked the veggie one. \u00a0Next we had our choice if a half sandwich we had \u00a0a capresi \u00a0one and an Italian sub. They were made on good Italian bread with just the right amount of ingredients. I had a fresh lemonade And my daughter, \u00a0a tequila slushy drink. No complaints there!!

Not so much. I got the Italian beef (a recommendation from the cashier) thinking I was in for a treat. The meat came from a soupy container. The bread was store bought. I had to buy peppers a la carte for $0.65 in a plastic container. The sandwich was fine, but for $8+ it just didn't add up. I've nothing against simplicity--but with only three ingredients each needs to be well thought out. This was simplicity for the sake of ease and cost savings. Overall, not a terrible experience but I won't be going back anytime soon."], ["Clare L.", "Fresco is out of this world good. Seriously, they make some of the better sandwiches I've ever had.

The man behind the counter was very friendly. He offered me a sample of their Italian beef after I ordered my sandwich. It. Is. Amazing.

For one if any of the ingredients are not good and fresh tasting it won't work. No meat to overwhelm the wilted veggies (\"cough subway). The basil was perfect. I could smell it and taste it and the pesto was just right too. No skimping on the mozzarella or tomato either. There was so much it was falling out of my sandwich. Two things to get five stars. One is the bread. It's actually pretty good but if it was just a little easier to bite off instead of having to jerk your neck or the sandwich ya know.

You look like my dad?\" I contemplated taking the time to teach her \"doppelganger\" and enjoy a child's attempt to say it but she was pulled away by an embarrassed grandma. Once we got a table, it was smooth sailing. The waiter was very attentive and kept it casual (it's definitely not an uppity establishment). We ordered some garlic cheese bread and I think I flat out moaned. Simple but amazing. My boyfriend got the special---spinach and goat cheese stuffed ravioli in a vodka cream sauce. It was a little rich for my taste but it's supposed to be so that's no complaint. It tasted really fresh (I've had not-fresh tasting pasta at the Old Spaghetti Factory and Milano Inn). My dish, however, was utter perfection in my eyes. I had the eggplant puttanesca (which came on a massive plate---I had maybe 3 meals worth). It was flavorful with just the right amount of spice. I think I've dreamed of it since, no joke.This is a perfect place for a romantic but not stuffy outting.

I just bought my parents a gift card to try it out for their 29th wedding anniversary so it goes without saying I highly recommend."], ["Vam K.", "One of my favorite parts of summer, without a doubt, had to be taking a stroll down the monon trail, and ending up on mama carolla's patio to enjoy an appetizer and a stinger (a simple classic cocktail, but believe me when I say, they do it the best). It's so easy to find myself with a second cocktail in hand, this time the espresso martini, (again a standard drink that they nail on the head) as I enjoy the nice private feel of their cortyard-like patio. Seriously, the patio would make you believe your Italian friend's pushy mother insisted you stay for Sunday dinner with the family in their beautiful backyard, not that you were sitting in an area surrounded by a parking lot and running/biking trail. But even when the weather cools off, the inside is a wonderful place to enjoy a drink or a meal. With the friendly bartenders, dim lights, and rat pack music, it has a way to make you feel it is almost christmastime, no matter what time of the year."], ["Sean W.", "Always great! I have been here a few times and Mama's never disappoints. Great tasting Italian food that will not break the bank. I have had a number of their menu items and I can only say I was less than thrilled with one. The shrimp scampi is not my favorite. It is still flavorful, but just not what I want in a shrimp scampi. If you want to try a variety of their foods, they normally participate in Devour Downtown and you can get a taste of several menu items that way for a cheap, set price. One of the best restaurants in Indy and it's house in a cozy, warm building. Great date spot!"], ["Felicia D.", "I once loved you so, so much!I still do, but... Hard times? What's going on?I'll start with the good stuff. Everything is still delicious... except maybe the fried ravioli. It could be great if it had more flavor. I think ours was also a bit overcooked. That's never good. The calamari is some of the best I've ever had in Indy. Don't skip that if you love seafood. The bruschetta... *sigh* it's perfect in every way. The goodies are piled on... so many tomatoes! So much cheese! It's what dreams are made of. So basically, go and get appetizers and wine. When your food comes, you'll be ready for a box. Now, the entrees. Between the three of us, we had one of the daily specials (I don't remember what it was), the chicken lasagna and shrimp and chicken Alfredo. None of us were very happy. It was just \"okay\" for all of us. I had never felt that way about an entree from Mama Carolla's before. I'm usually very happy. What a disappointment. I even placed a to-go order because my mom loves the shrimp scampi pasta. She told me a day later that they were very stingy with the shrimp this time and also that the portion size was quite a bit smaller than before. Otherwise, the service has always been good. No complaints there. They're usually pretty attentive."], ["Amber E.", "It's like stepping into a Tuscan cottage. The atmosphere at Mama Carolla's is unmatched. From the time you walk through the back garden to the small intimate table with dark lighting. It's a romantic experience. Definitely a great first date spot.  Tonight I visited Mama Carolla's for the first time and was not disappointed. The ambience of the restaurant will transport you to Tuscany, Italy. When my date and I arrived we were greeted by the sweetest white-haired man who open the door for us and guided us to the hostess stand right infront of a beautiful wood-burning fireplace. On a Saturday night there was only a 15 minute wait. My date and I decided to grab sangria in the bar area while admiring paintings, flowers, and ivy on the walls.We were seated about 10 minutes later in a tiny two seat table in an intimate little nook of the restaurant. Although the table didn't have much room and there were only two seats I believe anything bigger would have taken away from the intimacy. Our waiter Tristan promptly came over to check and see if we needed drinks and point out tonight specials. (While looking at the menu I found that the supersweet white-haired man who directed us to the hostess table was actually the owner. I've forgotten his name but his picture is on the back of the menu with some history about the restaurant)After looking over the menu I decided on spaghetti and meatballs (I always go the safe route at any new restaurant.) and my date got the fettuccine Alfredo and chicken. We both opted for the salad. Just a few minutes later our salads came with a warm half loaf of bread. The salad is simple with some lettuce a few mixed greens, cheese and a slice of tomato. I got the balsamic vinaigrette and the creamy Italian on the side. The balsamic was delicious and tangy and the creamy Italian was okay. I like dressing to be super flavorful and it was just a little tone down for me but my date really liked it. The bread is crusty and warm. I dipped the warm bread into the creamy Italian dressing that I had. My date decided to utilize the olive oil on the table.When our food came out it was picture perfect and piping hot. The spaghetti and meatballs are exquisite. You can really taste in the sauce that it had been made that day. It was a beautiful color of red and tasted like someone had just roasted the tomatoes and chopped the basil minutes ago. The meatballs were done well also. You can really taste the pork in them. The fettuccine Alfredo is a perfectly executed sauce with balanced flavors of cheese butter and garlic. The chicken in the fettuccine Alfredo dish was moist and tender.After dinner we could not pass up the tiramisu for dessert. When the tiramisu came to the table it was beautifully plated with chocolate sauce swirling around it. It had a really good taste that wasn't overpowered by rum. Very yummy! After paying our bill and getting ready to leave the same smiling white haired man was waiting at the back door to let us out. I couldn't help but feel like the whole experience was just visiting family. He smiled and said good bye and to be careful and to come back soon. Such a wonderful experience! It's no wonder why this beautiful welcoming restaurant has been a fixture in SoBro for so many years, and many more to come I hope.I will definitely go back to Mama Corollas and be more adventurous with my dinner choices. I know I won't be disappointed. Every dish that I tasted this evening was perfection!"], ["Lauren L.", "I've been waiting a loooooong time to be able to write this review! I have been drooling over the Mama Carolla's menu ever since I first heard about it a couple of years ago. It finally took this year's Chow Down Midtown for my husband and I to dig in. Through the Chow Down menu we shared an appetizer of Fried Ravioli.... crispy, crunchy, and creamy.... and I slurped down the Italian Wedding soup while he ordered the house salad. The broth was very tasty but there was an extra amount of spinach in there that I could have done without. Moving onto the main course I had to pace myself through the Spaghetti Carbonara because of it's amazing thick creaminess. It was a destination carbonara hands down. And bonus points for an equally as delicious leftover lunch the next day! The fresh bread and oil on the table were yummy and sitting out on the patio was a peaceful setting. Can't wait for my next meal at MC's!"], ["Rick B.", "Mama's earned one of her stars back. Tried this restaurant again and had a wonderful time...I think our waiter Keith led to the fine dining experience. We started with the mozzarella sticks for grown-ups (delicious lump of cheese lightly breaded and fried, placed over a little balsamic with bruschetta topping)...and added the melon/prosciutto appetizer (wonderful sweet/salty contrasting tastes)...I have to remember to just order a half-carafe of wine and more appetizers for a delightful meal all by itself. But this time we did it the old fashioned way.For entrees we had spaghetti pomodora (nicely done spaghetti and a basket full of fresh sliced plum tomatoes on top)...chicken parmesan (all around nice dish with tender chicken cutlets)...and the pork chop (perfectly done and juicy pork chop over a smear of garlicky mashed potatoes...yum). Dessert was chocolate cheesecake and tiramisu...neither of which survived as we licked the plates clean. All in all a very nice evening. Keith made the difference this trip as he was spot on. This restaurant still packs people in like sardines and is very noisy...but what's not to like. The food is very good and the ambiance is wonderful. Since it was winter and they could not do real al fresco dining...they had a large - maybe 12 feet across - tent set up over the backyard from the parking lot to the entrance...they put dining tables along one side and chairs for people waiting for a table along the other...and when we left both sides were full of people. I hate to wait as much as the next guy, but the wait here is for a good reason...give it a try."], ["Elizabeth P.", "AYE MAMA!My ginger companion and I were looking for a date that we hadn't tried out before, and Mama Carolla's came straight to mind since I pass it all the time and keep saying I want to go in! I'm so glad we did because it was seriously awesome. For starters, it's in an old house which just makes it that much cooler, and the servers/staff are all so so so friendly. Now, when you're waiting in line for the restroom and the woman in front of you starts bragging on the owners and the food, you know you're in the right place! (Also, the plants in the tub of the bathroom had me lovin' the place and I knew it was going to be hard not to fall in love with it!) Mi amor ordered the lasagna and I had a seafood concoction (the name has left me) but both were lovely, very filling, and gave you that warm and fuzzy feeling. As far as prices, the bar AND food was very affordable...and you get enough for lunch the next day which this little money saving fool is all about soooo...GO TRY IT! You won't be dismayed :)"], ["Ashley S.", "This is hands down my favorite Italian restaurant in Indy! The setting is awesome, tucked away in Broadripple beside the Monon and inside a gorgeous 1920s home. The service has always been top notch in regards to courtesy, professionalism, and an overall knowledge of the menu. But the food is what to write home about!! Personally I LOVE the veal medallions, the Gorgonzola cream sauce has a perfect flavor and the veal is always tender. The chicken Parmesan is great as well and the pork chop is huge and soooo juicy! I drive over 40 minutes just to get my fix about once a month. Great for a romantic evening or for a family event. It is higher end dining so put thoughts into bringing kids that are too young for the experience."], ["Aaron G.", "Mama's is one of our favorites in Indy and while the food was again outstanding the service was a little off for our Friday dinner. \u00a0We arrived around 7p on Saturday and were seated at a nice two-top in one of the downstairs. \u00a0The www were given water then sat four about five minutes without being acknowledged, a sever hesitated by our table and asked if we had been greeted, when we said know he said he would find out who our server was... He returned a few moments later and said someone would be with us soon and then he headed off. \u00a0Our server arrived a could minutes later and with prompting took our drink order. \u00a0Our drinks arrived and we ordered the mussels started (we decided not to place our entire order since we had no faith in our server properly pacing the meal). \u00a0The mussels arrived and we ordered our mains, I ordered the beef lasagne while my SO ordered a pasta dish and requested \"no chicken\". \u00a0We dug into our started which was excellent, the sauce with the mussels is great and sopping it up with the warm bread is a must. \u00a0As we finished our starter our salads arrived and we enjoyed the salad course. \u00a0As we finished our salads our mains arrived, unfortunately my SO's dish had chicken in it (she had requested without), our server hesitated and then acknowledged it was incorrect. \u00a0We asked him to have it remade and to hold my dish while it was done. \u00a0Now in all honesty I did not mind the pause in getting our mains because we were not in a rush and the food was coming a little fast. \u00a0It took about ten minutes for the new dish to come out and my lasagne held up just fine. \u00a0After dropping our meals our server only returned to clear (he did get us to go containers) and made a token dessert suggestion which we declined. \u00a0The food was again excellent at Mama's but last nights service was well below our past visits."], ["Tammy H.", "What can I say - this place is top notch! Excellent service, even as we battled a cranky 4 year old and a one year old. Our server was helpful and efficient. The food was so good. The cheese bread is a must! We both had the special that night and got dessert to go. Can't wait to visit again. Get there early as its a popular place."], ["Mike S.", "Fantastic! i could eat there every week."], ["Mike S.", "Mama Carolla's was an oddly satisfying and pleasant surprise on my last trek to Indy... honestly I wasn't expecting much in thr way of Italian and I'm glad I was wrong. The restaurant is rustic in style--really out of place when you think about it--but it gives at least a pseudo-old world charm. \u00a0 We came through with a large party (for a PhD graduation) , so of course it was packed...we parted a ways down the street and had to trek back towards the patio through a neighborhood. \u00a0Adds to the charm, right? \u00a0Anyway, we sat upstairs and seemed to take up entire nook, but the waitstaff managed to move around us without so much as a drop of water on our summer Sunday best. The menu didn't have anything earth-throbbing at a glance and the wine menu is about what I expected for the region. \u00a0BUT... before I get all Snooty McSnobsolete... let me say that there were a few things that, I think, make the entire joint worth a bit of praise. First, there's the calamari. \u00a0Now I brought sweet home Alabama with me, and many in my entourage don't consider mollusks part of any food group. \u00a0But the calamari was as perfect as any I can remember...scouts honor. \u00a0It made a believer of a few who, due to an obvious omission, didn't know what it was until after the fact. \u00a0 We ordered a few more rounds before the night was over. Also, my main was a no brainer for me... Linguini (misty?) di mare. \u00a0I mean it's like my American Italian answer to shrimp and grits... A standard by which all others are measured. \u00a0And... Mama's measured up with the freshly adorned seafood and noodles. Around the table there were the classics: bolognese, meatballs, and a steak or two. \u00a0 All smiles after a long day of pomp and unnecessary circumstances."], ["Scott W.", "Visited for dinner on Tuesday evening for our wedding anniversary and was quite happy with the experience. \u00a0The look and feel of the restaurant, both inside and outside, was great. \u00a0I had Veal Marsala and it was EXCELLENT. \u00a0The veal was perfectly cooked, I really enjoyed the pasta side and they weren't at all stingy with the sauce. \u00a0It was a lot of food, it was delicious, and I left nothing on the plate. \u00a0My wife had chicken parmesan and as far as that dish goes, I'd say it was in the upper echelon (personally I don't love it). \u00a0It was a ton of food, I ate all the leftovers of hers for lunch and enjoyed it; the red sauce was more bitter than sweet which I greatly prefer.We finished the meal with tiramisu and it was wonderful as well. \u00a0In all, food wise, a wonderful meal.Small downsides; we ordered cappuccino with dessert and they didn't have any. \u00a0I found that a bit strange. \u00a0Lastly, we were seated right outside the kitchen in the entry way of a room at the bottom of the staircase in the building. \u00a0The restaurant was not very busy and we noticed there were open tables all over the place and in general, the restaurant has a lot of charm. \u00a0Sitting in the entry way of this room where there were other tables, with servers running up and down the stairs and people walking right past my back in and out of the kitchen the whole meal, I would venture to guess this was the worst table in the entire restaurant and can't figure out why we'd get seated there. \u00a0However, we'll definitely be back."], ["Sarah H.", "Amazing service!

From the terrific atmosphere to the delicious Italian food what's not to love. This restaurant is close to home and when family visits we love to eat at Mama Corolla's. A typical meal includes bread, salad and an entree. The appetizers are also good. I've had the toasted ravioli. The nightly specials are also tempting and every meal is made to order which is nice if you have any picky eaters in the family.

Mama Carolla's is everything an italian restaurant needs to be. Cute ambiance, complimentary bread, good wine list and amazing food. Just the right size portions. The service tends to be a little slow - so be sure you have a decent amount of time set aside when visiting."], ["David F.", "We went here for my Daughter's birthday. My other Daughter made the reservation and paid for it, so you would think having someone else pay for it would make me have a different opinion. I wasn't a fan of the place. It is in an old house that has been converted into a restaurant. You actually have to walk through the kitchen to get to one of the dining rooms. The atmosphere inside is very noisy. You can barley hear the person next to you as the sound bounces off the old walls. They also cram far too many tables into the room so you have to maneuver around other people to get to your table and then out. The food wasn't too bad. Noodles are cheap so you have to wonder why the give you such a limited amount. We ordered spaghetti with meatballs.....You think you might get 3 or 4 but they only had two. Not big meatballs, but they were good. We also ordered garlic bread and it came on a whole load of french bread and the cheese and garlic were melted to the outside of the bun, not the inside. The melted cheese mixture feel off while we are attempting to cut it with the not too sharp knives. The prices and the quantity of food don't match in my opinion. Overall, this is a much younger crowd so my opinion is more in line with what an old world Italian restaurant would be. A lot of good food at a good price and a wonderful atmosphere. This place didn't deliver that in my book. I doubt I will go back and there seems to be plenty of other people who do like this place so I am sure absence won't be a loss. Finally, the parking sucked. The parking lot in the back was shared with a little strip mall and wasn't convenient to the actual restaurant. They need another parking lot!"], ["Matthew G.", "What an excellent surprise! \u00a0My fianc\u00e9 decided to take us out for a date night tonight, but didn't tell me where we were going. \u00a0Mama Carolla's is in what used to be a house, renovated and remodeled into a beautiful, dim-lit, romantic Italian restaurant. \u00a0I'm a sucker for places like that, small and personable. \u00a0It has a real mom and pop feel to it.We spoke with the hostess and were told the wait would be 45 minutes, possibly less. \u00a0I'm impatient, not much of a waiter(no pun intended) so I was skeptical. \u00a0We wandered towards the bar and two people got up to leave as we arrived. \u00a0We snagged their seats and were greeted promptly by the bartender. \u00a0Naturally he first asked what we'd like to drink, and got us a wine list. \u00a0We looked it over and made a decision, then he began to explain the night's specials. \u00a0Seared sea scallops with a pan cream sauce tossed with pasta, or veal meatballs. \u00a0Scallops are one of my favorite things to eat, I couldn't resist. \u00a0While waiting for our food we engaged in conversation with the couples to either of our sides, the bartender, and ourselves. \u00a0It was such a warm, welcoming atmosphere. \u00a0We both loved that everyone was friendly enough to share separate experiences together. \u00a0The bartender told us what Mama Carolla's is all about, and how well they take care of their employees. \u00a0After a short wait dinner arrived. \u00a0Really fast service for a busy Friday night. \u00a0The scallops were cooked to perfection. \u00a0A nice hard sear on either side, melt in your mouth tender in the middle. \u00a0They paired nicely with the cream sauce and pasta, which was also accompanied by peppers, onions, and what appeared to be shitake mushrooms. \u00a0For dessert we decided to indulge in their creme brulee. \u00a0Hard to pass up, such a simple dessert that requires skillfull preparation. \u00a0It was very good, a hard candy crust on top, gooey vanilla custard in the middle with extra tart berries to battle the sweetness. \u00a0Our experience was wonderful, something that should never be taken for granted as I can be a hard person to please when it comes to food. \u00a0We will definitely be back, perhaps with a few friends to enjoy the service even more."], ["Kelsey A.", "This is definitely a place you want to go to when you have time on your hands. A great date night place with great dishes. It's essentially an Olive Garden on steroids. Same price, better quality and a much more authentic Italian feel. It gets pretty crowded and you sometimes feel like you're close enough to the table next to you that your date becomes a double date.

(Keep in mind I am a Ceasar Salad snob) \u00a0The soup of the day was this vegetable soup with Parmesan and it was amazing. \u00a0I really wish I would have gotten that instead of the salad.For entrees, I got to try 3 different things. \u00a0I ordered the Chicken Involntini which was perfectly good chicken stuffed with Prochiutto and covered in a red sauce that resembled a vodka sauce. \u00a0This dish was simply ok, and honestly if I did not try my buddy's dish, I think I would have given Mama Corolla's only 3 stars. \u00a0My buddy's dish was the special of the day. \u00a0Blackened Mahi done Oscar Style (Lump crab meat, Asparagus and Hollandaise sauce). \u00a0This was AMAZING. \u00a0Again, I kicked myself for order the wrong thing. \u00a0My girlfriend got the salmon that was drenched in this dill cream sauce and after a few bites of thinking it was amazing, it quickly turned into overwhelming. \u00a0I think much less sauce on the fish would go a long way there.All in all we had a great time between the ambiance and the food, I just wish I made better choices for food as I enjoyed the dishes of those around me more than I did my own.I'd come back here again to see if I'll move to a 3 star or 5 star rating for Mama Corolla's."], ["Mariam H.", "The ambiance of this place is beyond compare in the city of Indianapolis. Dim lighting from gold sconces, white linen table clothes, old paintings, roaring fire make this a romantic spot in the Winter, but in the Summer the side patio and the back garden make Mama Carolla's a thing of true ooey-gooey, lovey dovey-ness. Most Italian food is not my favorite as I do not eat much dairy, so I usually end up with a seafood dish. I've had some killer scallops on special here before. Other times the food I order is just ok. My last visit was the day before Valentine's Day and I had the walnut and herb crusted tilapia with blackberry basil sauce. Honestly I was expecting more flavor from the 'crust'.... and it was a little mushy. The dish is normally served with asparagus, but I asked for roasted vegetables as a substitute. The veggies were so, so good!!! However, upon receiving my bill they charged me an extra $2.50 for the substitute! WHAT????? The server should have pointed out the up-charge to me when I ordered. Very annoying. After waiting an hour to be seating, having a long dinner with my newly married friend... \u00a0I didn't really have the willpower or the urge to ruin a lovely night by bring this annoyance up with our server. Overall I don't love Mama Carolla's, but for the aesthetics.My tips are to come for an early dinner before 7pm if you want to avoid a long wait, order something with dairy (I've heard great things about the rosemary chicken lasagna), and most certainly sip on some wine while seated outdoors."], ["maria p.", "We had dinner at Mama Carolla's this past Saturday October 17- with the highest expectations of a delicious meal based on the Yelp reviews. Almost all the appetizers & entrees were so very disappointing. The salads were not freshly prepared; cold, just like out of the cooler. The bruschetta , while abundant, was topped with very cold shredded mozzarella. The toasted bread was sliced too thinly to support the weight of the tomatoes. A bit bland also. The mussels were good. The day's special of crusted red snapper was very good. The pork chop entree was unremarkable . The veal medallions in Gorgonzola sauce were overcooked , the sauce was so thick that it was clumpy. The fourth entree was also a day special of pasta with various meats - also just average .Not a satisfying meal at all. The service was very good however , and the restaurant itself has a certain type of vintage charm. ."], ["Brady R.", "I always have a great time here. The food is great, the service is awesome, and the atmosphere is even better. It's perfect for a date night.

The pasta and their sauces were not impressive. This time everything was great. We started with the calamari which was excellent and I loved their dipping sauce for it. For our entree we had their special for the evening which was a veal meatball dish with a creamy tomato sauce over I believe a linguine pasta. It was excellent. Their bread, olive oil and balsamic as a starter was great as well and I couldn't stop eating it. Definitely check out Mama Corrolla's when you get a chance. This is probably the best Italian I've found in Indy so far."], ["Nicole L.", "4 1/2 stars- giving it 5 to get it where it should be.First of all, the building itself is really neat. Like you really are stepping out of downtown Indy and into little Italy.The seating is super close together, which was awkward for the very first give minutes, but after I helped myself to a little of their Tuscan blend wine I didn't even notice anyone was in the room besides my wife.Ps, this place is classy and romantical. Feel free to make it your date night location.We got the caprese salad for an appetizer- we both agreed this was their only shortcoming, tomato slices were rather thinThe balsamic house salad was delicious. Fresh mozzarella and crisp veggies.The chicken rigatoni and the chef special (beef tips, italian sausage, peppers and spicy sauce) were both amazing. Our server was very attentive without being the slightest bit invasive.I would definitely recommend if you're looking for an authentic italian experience!"], ["Alison Y.", "This place has such a nice rustic and intimate feel! I can't believe I haven't been here more often! Their outdoor seating areas are most under tents so you can enjoy the nice weather without getting too hot or wet. The inside dining area has a more romantic feel with its dim lighting and decor. I much prefer sitting outside since I feel like inside can get a little loud and crowded for my liking.The menu has a mix of simple classic items like the typical red and white sauce pastas and then a little more adventurous items such as rosemary chicken lasagna. I came with some friends and we tried a good variety of dishes - calamari appetizer, Chicken Involtine, Chicken Rigatoni, and herb crusted tilapia, and the ricotta cake. Everyone in the group loved the calamari. We were so excited I forgot to take a picture but it looks like pics other people have uploaded. The calamari was fried perfectly leaving the meat nice and tender with a nice crunchy and seasoned batter. Diners should note that the calamari appetizer only has rings and no tentacles - in case some people are preferential to one or the other, lol. It came with a delicious pesto aioli that paired perfectly with the dish!Oh and to cherry on top is the fact that it was only $6.99!All of our entree's came with either a salad or soup an we all chose the dinner salad. Wasn't an out of the world salad but it was nice and refreshing way to transition from our appetizer into our entrees. We also received our complimentary bread when the salads came and not at the very beginning of the meal like I'm accustomed to at most other places. The entree's were the highlight of our beautiful meal! The top favorites were the chicken involtine and the chicken rigatoni! The Chicken Involtine's creamy tomato butter sauce was heavenly and super flavorful! I was mixing my angel hair pasta in it and it made my night! The Chicken Rigatoni also had a very flavorful butter herb sauce and was cooked perfectly! The herbed crusted tilapia had a really beautiful presentation and while I didn't try it, my friend enjoyed it! We were all stuffed on good food and good company :)We topped off our meal by sharing a ricotta cake. This cake was a little dense but moist. For some reason I was expecting it to be lighter and fluffier but it was by no means not delicious. It had a nice light flavor that paired incredibly well with the blackberry sauce that was as delicious as the cake! I'll definitely be trying the tiramisu next time - I think that's where my craving for a light, fluffy, and delicate dessert craving may be satiated!"], ["Emily H.", "Oh, mama! You sure do know how to make a mouth watering pasta dish that keeps noodles dancing around in my head.I have visited this cute and cozy place three times and have been nothing but impressed and satisfied with the atmosphere, service, and food, of course. I'll first start with the atmosphere. Being in an old house definitely gives it the \"villa\" feel. It's so quaint and romantic! Especially with that fireplace. LOVE IT. The back patio is an ideal date spot, especially right as the sun has set. Dim lighting, Italian music, and candle lit tables.On to service. Every waiter or waitress I have interacted with has been very helpful when trying to decide on a wine, an appetizer, or an entree. They are well informed of specials and seem to be genuine when giving their opinion on a dish.Now, on to the most important part. THE FOOD. Holy pasta. I'm not sure you can go wrong with any decision you make here. I have enjoyed the Ravioli, Chicken Rigatoni, and the Traditional Beef Lasagna. The Ravioli was your classic fresh pasta square filled with a spinach cheese mixture, covered in a creamy pesto sauce. The Chicken Rigatoni had me at saut\u00e9ed chicken strips with spinach, pancetta, garlic, crushed red pepper and Romano cheese in a spicy white wine sauce. (That description is actually directly from the menu. BUT, now do you understand why I'm saying, \"Oh, mama!?\" Here, let me help you with that drool rolling down your lip.) And finally, the Traditional Beef Lasagna. Let me repeat. The Traditional Beef Lasagna. Sorry mom, but THIS is the best Lasagna that I have ever eaten. I don't know how I'm ever going to be able to try anything new after devouring that delicious, beefy, cheesy, GIANT piece of lasagna.Mama, I'm looking forward reuniting soon. Smooches."], ["Chris P.", "Service was fast and friendly. The food was good but not the best Italian I've ever had like a friend raved about. It was still above average. We will return and try something different next time. The first round of drinks we ordered were horrible: the sangria. Something just didn't taste right (rotten fruit or a bad mixture but tasted watered down and wasn't sweet) and it was the worst sangria I have ever tasted. They brought us new drinks no problem and took the sangria off the bill. The new drinks were awesome. I had the watermelon martini. Yum!"], ["Leah M.", "There was a loud woman ranting about gypsies across the room and we could hear her entire offensive conversation, but still everything was delicious despite her best efforts. We both got different dinner specials and they were great. One was Parmesan crusted scallops over linguine in a lemon caper sauce and the other was goat cheese ravioli in tomato vodka sauce. We'll be back again for a special occasion."], ["Maria L.", "I think a \"staple\" place to visit in Indianapolis if you're an Italian food fan. The building itself is a huge old house and has a lot of character, makes you think of going home to visit family. I took my parents here and we all had good food. They don't take reservations and the wait can be long, particularly for a large party. Our waitress was very nice and had good recommendations. In terms of food I've had the following:1. Fried Buffalo Mozzarella - recommend2. Veal Saltimbocca - recommend3. Beef Lasagna - recommend4. Eggplant Puttanesca - very salty, I think between the capers and olives it was too briney and I couldn't eat it"], ["Katherine L.", "Mama Carolla's is a very good Italian restaurant. It has that old world charm and conservative feel. The lighting is dim inside and easily lends itself to a very romantic and cozy atmosphere. I have yet to sit outside, but I bet it's just as good. For my visit, I had the chicken marsala and my wife and the lasagna, both were excellent. We also ordered the tiramisu for dessert. Tiramisu is my favorite dessert, and pretty much the only dessert that I can make. \u00a0The food was delicious and decadent. I could definitely feel some arteries filling up, but was it worth it? Yes! \u00a0Why didn't I get it 5 stars? \u00a0Well I need to try out more food to really gauge it. \u00a0From what I had, the chicken marsala and tiramisu tasted and was made almost exactly the same style and taste that I make mine. \u00a0That either speaks to me having nailed the dishes, as a non-Italian, or the dishes were okay, but still very good.If you're ever looking for a place to bring someone for a date, or need a place with an intimate atmosphere, I would definitely recommend Mama Carolla's. \u00a0It is also conveniently located on the Monon Trail and there is plenty of parking to be had."], ["Kelli M.", "Came to visit family here who recommended this Italian restaurant. Such a great place with a wide variety of food items. We came on a Saturday night. We're told we would wait an hour so we got drinks by the bar and were seated within forty five minutes.Our waiter Julio was so friendly and gave us great recommendations. He always checked on us and gave us plenty of refills on drinks, bread, etc. We ordered fried ravioli, chicken piccata, rosemary chicken lasagna, chicken rigatoni, and tiramisu. All amazing! We were with someone that has been here multiple times and said everything was great that he ever ordered. Loved it!Everything was fresh. Pancetta was perfectly crisp with every single bite. Each meal comes with soup or salad. Delicious."], ["Y C.", "I really want to like this place but in the two times I have been here, it just did not live up to the hype. This is your typical family run Italian restaurant so it does have its charm but the food was just average at best to me. We tried the mussels, which lost its natural seafood sweetness/taste since it was completely drowned out by the lemon juice. As for the pastas, some of them such as misto mare are ok with its al dente pasta mixed in with just the right amount of sauce but others like the chicken piccata with angel hair is a dish that I would like to forget.I will probably give this place another try, but at this point, if I'm craving pasta, I would rather go downtown to iozzo."], ["Apurva C.", "Mama Carolla's is a very interesting Italian restaurant, amongst a curious lack of quality Italian cuisine in Indianapolis. I went there not expecting much in terms of Italian, my previous standard being Lorenzo's that has been taken over by some blah steakhouse chain. I was accompanied by my fiancee and her parents who are regulars there. We ordered martinis, which were just perfectly balanced between the potentness of the alcohol and the accompanying flavor - \u00a0I tried an expresso martini, and my fiance had a german chocolate martini, both of us were impressed. I ordered the chicken marsala, which was very fresh, light and fluffy, which is a refreshing change from the chicken marsala at italian chains. My fiancee and her parents ordered chicken piccata and the ravioli. We will definitely be coming back, next time hopefully keeping room for some dessert!"], ["Carie W.", "Hello, Heart-Devoted-To-All-Things-Carb-and-Tasty, meet Mama Carolla's, the mother of all things Italian and good in Indy. It really has everything. Incredible food. Charming venue. Charismatic staff. Maybe even magic air? My only issue with Mama Carolla's is the inside seating. The patio works well for me. The inside makes me feel a little claustrophobic. It's incredibly charming, just not for muah. The fix for that is easy - sit on the patio, or grab carry-out. Both have distinct advantages. All of the appetizers are great. Yes, I literally mean all of them. The calamari has never been chewy and has a light, crispy breading. The garlic cheese bread is bursting with the perfect balance of butter and cheese. The artichoke fritters with that lemon aoili...oi! \u00a0Any pick on the appetizer portion of the menu will result in happy taste buds.I am ashamed to say that it has been years since I ordered an entree other than the Traditional Beef Lasagna. Ashamed, maybe, but I have no regret whatsoever. It's a work of art. A perfectly sculpted mountain of delicate layers that delivers big flavor in each bite. I've tried other menu items and they have been lovely. I'm just married to the lasagna at this point. No other suitors have appeal anymore.If you can make it to dessert, of course the tiramisu is wonderful. I rarely make it to dessert at Mama's. I'm too in love with the appetizers and the lasagna is such a large portion, I rarely leave room for more. And I always leave happy.One last comment on the carryout. Hands down, no contest, Mama Carolla's provides the most consistent and best carry-out experience you could ever wish for. Efficient, courteous, accurate - they never miss. And they never skimp on the smiles either."], ["Amy R.", "Mama Carolla's had been a family favorite ever since I introduced it to my family a couple of years ago. On my most recent visit for my dad's birthday, per his request, we had a chance to enjoy the outdoor seating area. With a little Dean crooning in the background plus a mild summer evening and a good bottle of wine, we couldn't ask for a better night.I am hooked on their rosemary chicken lasagna, so I had my usual. This dish never seems to disappoint. My dad had a dish I believe was called pasta to good. He said it was delicious. I really haven't had much on their menu that I didn't enjoy.The service was good especially since it was a busy Friday night. We were seated much quicker than the quoted time and our server was quick to attend to our needs. Our water glasses were continually filled and our food came out in a timely manner.I am glad my dad reminded me of this place. It obviously had made a good impression on him over the years if he requested to go here for his birthday dinner. It is a great place to gather with friends and family or that romantic dinner with your significant other."], ["Katrina D.", "It was the first warm Saturday in 2014 and my mom was visiting. \u00a0I had a grand plan of parking by the Indianapolis Arts Center, walking down the Monon to Mama Carolla's, eating dinner, and hitting up Brics on our walk back. \u00a0The evening didn't go quite as planned but we did end up at Mama Carolla's.Their backyard patio is the perfect spot on a summer evening to enjoy a delicious Italian meal (each entree comes with soup or salad), a glass or wine, or their amazing tiramisu.I branched out of my Italian comfort zone (I'm a carbaholic-pasta-eating kind of girl) and tried the chicken involtine. \u00a0Yum! \u00a0The chicken breasts were a great size. \u00a0Big enough for one to fill you, but not huge and ridiculous. \u00a0You could tell they made the dish at the restaurant and it didn't come preassembled. \u00a0My mom went with the classic tortellini carbonara and I got to enjoy eating her leftovers.We took a tiramisu to go since we were both so full from dinner. \u00a0Instead of cocoa powder on top, they also have chocolate shavings and it's amazing how it kicks it up to make it a great dessert instead of just a good one.Our service was excellent. \u00a0Our waiter was very thorough and helpful. \u00a0He was always checking in on us to see if we needed anything, but not to the point where it was obnoxious. \u00a0We will definitely be returning."], ["A. P.", "Went for dessert & coffee. The waiter was friendly and attentive. Desserts came out very quickly...I'd be curious to come back and see how fast entrees appear.

We apparently entered through the back door but it wasn't clear where to go from there to get to the front; it could use some signage.

Whether inside or out, the ambiance can't be beat and neither can the food.My favorite dish, funny enough, is the salmon fillet with the creamy dill sauce. It is simply perfection, plus I can always add a side of pasta, for a more \"traditional\" Italian dish. Their traditional Alfredo, bruschetta, and seasonal selections are also favorites of mine. Wine options are always a must, and your waiter will be more than happy to suggest a good pairing with whatever meal you decide on.The only downside to this place is the limited seating and popularity do make getting seated a challenge at times. My friends and I usually try to avoid the longer wait times by showing up when they open to get prompt seating. Even if you do have to wait, it is worth it to enjoy some of the best Italian food in the city."], ["Ryan L.", "I've only tried a handful of the dishes at Mama Carolla's: chicken parmesan, fried ravioli, and ravioli with pesto. The pesto ravioli is so good, I now exclusively eat it when I come here (which makes sense since I come here when I want pesto). I've had a few issues with the pasta itself where it's a bit undercooked, but the pesto is so rich and smooth that it doesn't matter that much. The restaurant itself is an old house that's been converted into a restaurant and the layout shows it. There's not one main dining area but a bunch of separate rooms each with only a few tables. This is nice because it keeps things quieter (unless you end up in a room with a particularly loud and rude family). They also have two nice outdoor eating areas, one is the main courtyard around back near the parking, the other lines the side of the building along the Monon bike trail. The service here is fantastic. They're all very friendly and attentive. I've never had to actually ask for a refill on a drink (they just appear) and food/bill arrival is always very prompt. Most recently they went above and beyond my expectations. Over a year ago they had a special, goat cheese filled ravioli with pesto, and every now and then I'll call to see what their specials are hoping for a reappearance. My wife called a couple weeks ago without me knowing to discuss bringing this meal back for a night for my birthday meal. They were happy to do it, coordinated with her on timing and actually ended up making it the special every night this weekend. We went last night and it was fantastic. Good food, great pesto, great atmosphere, and great service."], ["Niki K.", "The most beautiful atmosphere you will dine in.

Indianapolis does not have the most inspiring italian, and I will say, this is probably the best that Indy has to offer. However, it doesn't compare to italian you can find in other cities. What I do like:The mussels. The sauce is really what makes this dish. The past year or so, I think the quality of the mussels themselves have gone down a bit, but the sauce is probably the best I've ever had.The Salmon Filet. Always been a favorite of mine here and I'm not even a huge fan of salmon. I think it's the creamy dill sauce that really makes it.The Bolognese Pasta. It's the little touch of cream that really makes this great.The Chicken Rosemary Lasagna. What I don't like:The salads are almost always over dressedI don't always get the fresh homemade pasta taste that I expect from a true italian restaurant. A lot of the other dishes I've had on the menu tend to just be okay. Their wine. I expect good wine with my italian. They do not carry good wine options by the glass and they do not store their wine at the proper temperature. Therefore, if I order a glass of red wine, it's \"warm\". Not the nice \"cool\" temp that it should be. Because of this, I typically skip completely and drink water, which is disappointing when eating italian.However, the atmosphere in their courtyard is great in the summer time and a perfect, casual and not overly pricey."], ["Antoinette C.", "As a New Yorker and Italian American I think that this is as good as it gets in Indy. \u00a0The mussel appetizer was very good, with a sauce that calls out for dipping with crusty bread. Rather than have the salad, I opt for the \u00a0soup. \u00a0In Italy they do not call it \"the wedding soup\" as they do in this country, and it was one that my grandmother made at least once a month. \u00a0It was good, but not as good as Nonna. For the entr\u00e9e, I had Misto Mare, a variant of the east coast Frutta di Mare. \u00a0This too had a very pleasing sauce, although the sea food/fish was chopped quite small. I prefer the fish/seafood to be a bit chunkier. \u00a0However, it was still a very satisfying dish and a generous size as well.

Surprising for a weekend, Mama Carolla does not take reservations, which means you will wait for hours to have a mediocre meal, all the while people waiting are staring at you in the hopes that you will finish quickly.

After food-stalking the pictures on Yelp, my wife and I stopped by for dinner. We started off with the fried buffalo mozzarella and the steamed mussels. The cheese was a unique take on normal cheese sticks, with a nice bread crumb crust and ham inside. It was good, but was completely overshadowed by the steamed mussels. These tender little morsels were sitting in a bath of the most delicious broth. Dipping the bread in the broth was wonderful. \u00a0For our meals, we ordered the chicken rigatoni (rizzo style, which means it comes with sliced sausage) and the misto mare. The rigatoni was well done, with generous amounts of meats. And pancetta. Yum. However, I'm not a huge fan of thicker pastas. The misto mare was spicy and packed with seafood. It was awesome.

It was truly the cherry on top for this cozy SoBro restaurant. I've been to Mama Carolla's a handful of times and often find myself lured by not only the cozy atmosphere but their appetizers, particularly the fried ravioli (which I now make at home) and artichoke fritters. I know, how healthy, Brittany! Two fried favorites. Upon this visit I was craving to mix it up with a pasta dish - fingers crossed that it'd be risotto. Unfortunately, risotto was accompanying their pork chop special and was unavailable on its own due to limited quantities. So, I opted for quite possibly the least healthy pasta option on the menu - pasta carbonara. The peas were delightfully crisp and refreshing! It was heavy and delicious and plenty for two. The meal came with a delicious mixed green salad and fresh bread for the table.

Boo!Now that I've got that off my chest, I have to say that everybody's food tasted better than it looked. Unfortunately the service was curt/impatient, our glasses were close to empty the entire meal, and I expected a more pleasant dining experience for $25/plate++. We rarely eat Italian out unless it is exceptional. And sadly, Mama Carolla's is not exceptional. It IS cute and homey in a Bed & Breakfast kinda way - I guess it would make a pretty good date spot as long as you don't get seated next to a family of 9 with two 2-year olds throwing meatballs against the wall. (Saw a few of these while we were there.)As far as presentation goes, the food was halfway there with decent flavor profiles, but none of the eight dishes that showed up would be worthy of a food magazine or even a local food column pictorial. Just put on the blindfolds and chow down. Now that's not very romantic, is it?All due respect, if you've got a Groupon or a BOGO coupon I can see going back, otherwise I think you could do better at home with a recipe and a couple candlesticks!"], ["Adam W.", "Love this place. I must confess I have a hard time ordering an entree besides clams linguine. The absolute best.

Only open Tuesday-Saturday 5pm till 11pm. The sauce is so delicious, you want to dive into it forever. I normally would give this place 5 stars based on just how perfect the lasagna is, but last night I ordered bruschetta and although it looked great, each bite was like being bitten back. The vinegar flavor was so strong. And must say the waiter (whom my friend and I have had before) worked at his own pace, as if to please himself. So with these two flaws, loses a star. But the lasagna was just Classic. My personal rule is if you can go to any Italian place and get lasagna, it should be a stand out. My daughter ordered the carbonara, which is outstanding as well.

The spumoni tasted like it was store bought as well. The only thing I like about the place is the location and the building's history. There was ample parking in the back of the building and service was good. Our server was friendly and so was the hostess.

The prices seemed a little high but it was a locally owned place so it seemed tolerable. The woman on the phone, clearly Italian, took my order and then asked me when I would be by the pick it up. I guessed at how long it would take to prepare calamari and the Pennetta Boscaiola and said 15 minutes. She didn't ask for my name or any more information. The exterior was quaint and the sign had an old fashioned charm. It was hidden behind a shopping center. The interior was beautiful, from the tables to the light fixtures to the grand fireplace. The diners were all well dressed and I was directed to pick up my food at the bar. It was brought out quickly, again by someone who seemed Italian (as did much of the staff.) They also threw in a bag of bread. I was staying less than 5 minutes away, and the calamari was cold when I ate it. It was also unbelievably bland, and the batter wasn't crispy. It was barely hanging onto the meat. The marinara dipping sauce was thin and rather plain. The pasta was also not thoroughly warm. The penne itself seemed like it might have been purchased at the Walmart across the parking lot. The sauce was nothing special. The mushrooms were good, but there wasn't a lot of it.  The rolls were certainly the frozen variety. They were hard as rocks on the outside and full of air. We watched the dog try to figure out how to eat one for a while. That was the highlight of this meal.

I've been here a few times, but the last time I was here we went all-out for dinner. This is a great place to celebrate with a loved one for things like anniversaries or birthdays. If you can afford it, I suggest buying a bottle of wine, doing the appetizers, a dinner, and after-dinner drinks or dessert. (That ran us around $170 with tip for 2 people, although we did purchase a more expensive bottle of wine.) If you don't feel like dropping a bunch of cash, don't fear!

My pondering are whether this large copper dream machine still produces the espresso from the old country?!

But who should I see sitting there--no not guests-- it more looked like a penalty box of servers dressed in white with hands on knees as if to say, \"Put me in coach!\".

Poor Scoto was unfamiliar with Bellini's and was very careful to ask the spelling so he could inquire of the bar whether or not they could make. 20 minutes later he comes back to tell us that they could not find their peach schnapps but perhaps my wife would like a glass of wine instead. She declined and ordered a Italian Margarita. He also mentioned that he made a mistake and told us yesterday's specials am not sure if Scotto was new or if he had ever really waited on a table before. His menu knowledge was sub par and were left to only hope the food was going to be out of this world.The UGLY: I am of the opinion that I do not mind the wait so long as the food is excellent. I will be happy to wait an hour for an entree that borders on modern art in form and taste. However, my Yelping Cohorts, I am sorry to have left you on the edge of your seat during this Shakespearean Tragedy but I am afraid that the final nail in the coffin was that the food when it arrived to the table was cold...not luke warm--cold. Does it even matter what entree we ordered? I don't think it does...food cold are you serious? I asked for the check....and we left. I didn't even bother to tell the owner because nobody bothered to ask how our meal was including our server. And I am sad to say the owner didn't seem to concerned about us when he sat us our table in the first place....I am sorry to disappoint all of you who hold this restaurant near and dear to your heart as a staple to north side Indy.

We opted for the Calamari Fritti, which proved to be stale and tasteless, accompanied by a bland sauce that tasted like it had just come out of a Hunt's can.My wife ordered one special - a lamb and noodles entree - that was very good. I ordered another special, chicken lasagna, and was not pleased. The lasagna was bland and mushy, with no particular flavor. Even the rolls brought to the table had no distinction.

Off one of the main roads and nestled in between construction behind a Junior Achievement building and a Math + Science teaching center. But it's worth the weaving. There's a cute outdoor seating area for nice nights. But the treasure is inside. The tables and bar area are fancy and upscale without feeling too stick-up-your-ass. The service was amazing. Nothing was ever empty and nothing sat on our table when we were finished.Oh ~ and there is cake. Yes, there is. Save room for dessert. Trust me, suckers."], ["Christy B.", "The best Italian place in Indy. The rolls are delicious, the pasta freshly made. I love the atmosphere of the bar area. Very swanky. I feel like Sinatra could walk in any moment. The staff isn't always super friendly, but I feel like they treat me like someone in Rome would treat me...I love the Ravioli Aurora. The tomato creme sauce is out of this world. I also recommend the sea bass special and my hubby always gets Penneta Boscaiola and then adds shrimp to the dish. Delicious!"], ["Dan L.", "Never had a bad meal..."], ["Ashley S.", "Thank you, Arturo!!! \u00a0After being snubbed by some other Indy restaurants when trying to make a reservation, my stepfather advised me of this place Indy should be incredibly thankful for. \u00a0From the decor to the food to the staff, everything was PERFECTION.We initially had a reservation for 6 that turned into 9, and we had no issue; they were incredibly accommodating to our every need. \u00a0We started with a few bottles of presecco, this was a bachelorette party after all! \u00a0For starters, while sipping on the presecco and decorating the bachelorette in her tiara for the evening, we had the calamari and artichoke. \u00a0The calamari was lightly breaded with a marinara, very basic and simple but well done. \u00a0The calamari wasn't drenched in batter so as to lose its taste but more of a light pan fry. \u00a0The artichoke was the only average part of the meal--anywhere else it may have been a highlight.The orders for the table of 9 were a variety of main dishes, all of which received superb reviews--even from my younger sister who never finishes a meal ate every morsel of her penne pasta. \u00a0I had the spaghetti and meatballs because I couldn't resist the description of homemade veal meatballs AND homemade pasta. \u00a0I try to avoid ordering pasta at a restaurant but it was well worth it. \u00a0The table also shared a couple of great, moderately priced wines. \u00a0They had a nice selection.Before ordering our desserts, our waiter--who was one of the best serves I've ever had--leaned in to me and asked if we wanted a little time after the table cleared so the bride to be could finish opening her gifts. \u00a0He knew when to come and refill glasses and be around when something was needed and disappear without notice when the table had everything it needed. \u00a0Perfection. \u00a0BRAVO!"], ["J T.", "Shocking really - and in a great way!Capri is among the best dining experiences in Indianapolis or anywhere else for that matter. Further, \u00a0it is authentic Italian dining (yes yes, I've eaten many meals in Italy).The food is always very good. \u00a0I love Prosciutto and Mozzarella and they prepare this dish to perfection: Warm roles on the side with butter. Very fresh lean prosciutto, fresh and moist mozzarella, drizzle of olive oil and garnished with artichoke and olives - perfect.When serving soup for one, they bring two spoons for sharing without being asked. These little touches and attention to details do not go unnoticed. Cream of potato and leak soup - fantastic.Much of the staff speaks Italian. \u00a0All of the wait staff dresses in black and white with a vest and tie - very professional and cool.Outstanding dining value and attention to detail in a world rife one size fits all and places like 5 Guys, Olive Garden and Outback Steakhouse."], ["Phil B.", "We went to Capri with some friends on Sunday afternoon. We were the only ones there. The place was beautiful. The colors were very comforting. The waitress was very friendly and knew the menu. One of us has a nut and chive allergy. She knew what to avoid. We got calamari and a antipasti Secca alla Calabrese Homemade Dry Salami & Aged Provolone Cheese to start. The calamari was good, but have had much better. The cheese on the antipasti was alright, the meat was right down rubbery. Two of us ordered Petto di Pollo Valdostano the others got Tagliatelle del Contadino. The Pollo or chicken dish made us both think of a very bad wedding reception dish. The chicken was pale, looked like when you boil chicken in just water, the sauce had no flavor. The menu said cream sauce with sage. No sage was tasted. This came with a side of green beans and carrots. The green beans were the best part. The others with the pasta dish said they like it. My God Son ordered the spaghetti and pomodoro sauce. I thought his tasted very good. All in all we spent something like 130 + $ on Sunday lunch. No alcohol either for that price. \u00a0We will not be going back. Much better food at Iaria's, Mama Carolla's or even Fazoli's."], ["Cathy D.", "It is difficult to imagine that one could find a better Italian dining experience than Capri - and I don't mean just in Indy. \u00a0The dining area is cozy. \u00a0The patio is charming with its white lights and vines (even if it does overlook a parking lot); \u00a0The wait staff is knowledgeable and friendly.

The ambiance was nice and the prices where a little high. On a good side. \u00a0We sat outside on a beautiful night and their patio was great. \u00a0The food is what earned the one star. The food was not good nor did the menu offer anything interesting. \u00a0I ordered a penne with basil and light red sauce. \u00a0The noodles were a little overcooked, the red sauce was too cream,y and there was no hint of spice anywhere near my food. \u00a0I had to ask for parmesan and could not get salt or pepper. My husband's chicken, sun dried tomato and fettucini dish was no better. Completely lacking in flavor. \u00a0The rolls however were the BEST part (which you gotta admit is pretty sad).The service was horrible. \u00a0The waiter looked like he had far too many tables and just could not get his act together. \u00a0It took forever to get anything and he ran through the specials so fast I couldn't understand any of them. \u00a0One of my first experiences where the yelp reviews just did not seem to match.

Perfectly cooked and saused, with just the right spices.The \"Grana Podanno con Prosciutto e olive\" and the \"Carciofi Marinati\" appetizers were also completely consumed with abandon by the group.I chose the Veal Pizziola as my entree, and was not dissapointed. \u00a0The veal was tender and flavorful and the pizziola sauce was perfect. \u00a0The dish was accompanied on the plate with a portion of potatoes au-gratin with a very creamy goodness and a serving of green beans with just the right \"crunch\".Some of the other entree choices by my dinner companions included: spaghetti with veal meatballs, Ravioli Aurora, Pollo con Salsiccia, Picata di vitello a limone, \u00a0and Filleto dell' Alpino.By the end of the meal, no \"doggie bags\" were required, because every thing had been happily consumed.My dinner companions were sophisticated world travelers, with \"educated\" palates, and we have all been to Italy many times, and some of us are actually Italian, or want to be.And we all agree that Capri is a true gem in Indianapolis.This is a great restaurant."], ["Joe P.", "The food and atmosphere at this Italian restaurant was excellent. Service was really good as well. I am used to really good Italian food being from Chicago but I have to admit that this did not disappoint. The wine selection was extensive although many of the wines were quite high in price.I had the special which was a veal stuffed cannelloni dish and it was very well prepared. I also ordered a bottle of the Chianti for around $35 and that complemented the food very well.I would suggest this restaurant for anyone looking for a good meal with friends, significant other, or even a first date."], ["James S.", "Best Veal in the city.

W.", "I really enjoy the Capri when eating out in Indy. It's locally owned, it employees professional servers, it has a very nice atmosphere, and they often have entertainment. While I've been here 10+ times, my most recent dinner met my high expectations. I enjoyed homemade spaghetti with veal meatballs, it was delicious. We had the cold eggplant appetizer, along with calamari, both were good. Everything was complimented by a nice bottle of Steele Merlot. The only thing missing was the live jazz guitar that I'd come to expect on Saturdays. I'm hoping that the absence was temporary. If you're planning on eating there for the first time, I'd recommend reservations on Fridays and Saturdays. They have a very nice lounge/bar and outdoor dining. Also, the sign on the door reminds you to leave children 8 and under at home."], ["Taylor L.", "This was the best meal I had on our trip to Indianapolis. First off, the dining room is beautiful. We went in on Labor Day so there weren't many people there, just a few tables. We split the Caprese-- perfect. Great tomatoes, fresh moz, and served with olive oil. They brought the balsamic on the side-- which definitely earns points in my book, since I don't like it. I had the ravioli aurora. It was great, although a little al dente, even for me. I was surprised when I cut in and it was green filling; I suppose I expected a traditional ricotta filling with spinach bits throughout, but this was spinach purreed with ricotta. It definitely made for an intense spinach flavor, but I really liked it. \u00a0My husband had the gnocchi and it was just the texture we like-- chewy and maybe a little dense, I don't like my gnocchi light as air. The sauce on both were a similar tomato cream sauce and were very fresh and flavorful. The only reason this place doesn't get a fifth star from me was the extremely off putting sign off front. Under the hours of operation it says, \"children over 8 welcome.\" I don't know if this is normal in the area, but I have never seen it before and it was a little pretentious. We had (LUCKILY!) left our 1.5 year old at home with family, as we had intended to take her but she fell asleep. What a disappointment it would have been to have to turn around and leave had we had her. I can understand where the managment is coming from, but I also take responsibilty for my child when in a dining institution and will jump up and take her out in a moment if she were being disruptive."], ["Cortland F.", "In going to stand behind any restaurant that makes their own noodles. \u00a0Done."], ["Susie J.", "Wonderful atmosphere, service, and food.

Doing what I know best, I hit yelp looking for a good Italian restaurant. Capri was awesome! We sat out on the patio and were very well taken care of. We split a bottle of Chianti which went very well with our dinners. We had the gnocchi and the spinach ravioli, both of which were cooked perfectly and offered in great sized portions. The only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars was that the sauce was a little bit heavy tasting.

This has to be the best Italian food I've eaten in a long time. Maggiano's had an 1.75 hour wait so we decided to bring up Yelp and venture out. Glad we did.

This last experience was finally too much to take. Our waitress described a wonderful ravioli special that came with a \"white wine cream sauce\", so when it came out with a red sausage sauce I asked to return it. Being a vegetarian I am very attentive to dish descriptions. First the waitress told me I was wrong about what (we all) heard her describe, she then returned with a plate of ravioli with no sauce at all! An obvious go @$%# yourself from the chef. To top it all off a major source of contention for me has been that in all the times we have been there the owner has never once said anything to us as we left, no thank you, no have a nice evening, no nothing that you would expect from a business owner who actually cared about his customers. So after getting this oh so familiar treatment I decided to share with him how overwhelmingly disappointing our experience was his response and I quote- was \"good\". That pretty much says it all don't you think..."]]}
