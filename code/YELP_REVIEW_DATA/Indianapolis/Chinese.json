But honestly that's how I feel about their pho, that first sip is all that you need. It's one of the best soups I've had in the city and possibly the best pho broths I've ever had.I usually order the Pho tai (Rare beef, rice noodles, fresh herbs). The taste is almost undescribable (it's not the MSG, I'm allergic I would know), it's beefy, fresh, and warms you up inside. I always ask for an extra side of cilantro just to add that extra herby touch. Also, the soft shell crab platter is the bomb (I think it's #121)! If I feel like I want to spend a little more, I always get it along with the pho!

The shrimp spring rolls seemed like they had been sitting for awhile. The rice paper was a tad bit chewy from getting dried out and the parts where there were multiple layers of rice paper was extremely chewy.The #100, the Pho Dat Biet I believe, was decent.

Flavor-wise it was also just decent. Not something I would order again from this particular restaurant.As for the prices and serving size, I would consider King Wok pretty average.I should mention that this is only the 2nd place in Indy that I've gone to for pho.

That means I've got to check it out.Arriving around 7pm on a Friday evening, the place only had three or four groups dining, so the service was super fast. I went vegetarian for the night and ordered the spring rolls and vegetable and tofu pho for dinner.Spring rolls: instead of a peanut sauce you get it most Vietnamese places, I got a soy-based sauce that was salty, but very tasty. It complimented the vegetables in the spring roll perfectly. Mushrooms and carrots inside the roll was a nice touch too.The pho: I found myself adding more and more siricha to it as I ate. When I was done, I realized how hot and sweaty my face was; a sign that it was good! I can now confirm my friends comment about the broth, and agree completely. King Wok put a massive amount of vegetables in their pho, something others sometimes skimp on (or just plain don't add.)Service: Super fast. Before I sat down, the server was there to get my drink order. The table next to me left as I was elbows up into a bowl of pho, and within seconds they were there to bus the table.

The waiter looked really unhappy, took our drink orders, neglecting the friend in the bathroom, whose drink order he didn't bother to get even after she came back.

Not the best, definitely not anything compared to what Mom makes. I had the caramelized catfish, which is one of my most favorite Vietnamese dishes ever. They do catfish filets, which is normal with the bones and everything, but they were really small, so it was more bone than it was meat.Honestly, I'm giving them an \"okay\" review due to the service. The waiter never came back to check up on us or even to give refills, never checked up on us to see how the food was, if we needed anything else--he gave us the check and sent us on our way.

There were a few Asian families in there, which I took as a good sign. The place is small and cute with a little bit of an Eighties vibe in the wall decor. Service was attentive until we ordered and then unobtrusive. When we were through eating we paid at the counter but I'm not sure if that's always the case...?We were really hungry when we went in so we ordered two appetizers + two entr\u00e9es, which is unusual for us. All of it was good.-- Tofu steak (#6, deep fried tofu saut\u00e9ed in special King Wok's sauce, $3.99) was our favorite appetizer. It was two \u00a01/2\" slices of tofu with a golden, crispy shell served on, and coated in, a thick brown sauce. I think the sauce may have been a soy reduction with the teeniest bit of hot pepper + a few sesame seeds for garnish.-- Goi Cuon (#10, Vietnamese summer rolls with shrimp and pork, $2.99) were what you'd expect for a summer roll. They were a good size and tasted fresh. I always think I like summer rolls more than I actually do, and The Huz didn't dig the mint inside, but it's not the restaurant's fault we chose poorly for our own tastes.-- Com Dac Biet (#88, grilled marinated pork chop, chopped stir-fried shrimp, and egg pie, $7.25) was The Huz's main course. I didn't notice any (recognizable) chopped shrimp on the plate but it did come with a mound of steamed rice with something orange on top, a small salad dressed in a vinegar sauce, some fresh cucumber slices, a sauce for dipping, and a side of soup broth.

I asked the waitress how spicy it was and she said a \"regular\" level that could be made more or less spicy as I desired. I forgot about this when I ordered so when it came to the table she said she had it prepared \"medium\" level, which was about as spicy as I care to eat. (I am a wimp, though.) It had a good flavor but the aroma was not appetizing to me. There weren't too many shrimp for a main course, fewer than the amount of bacon, which was actually thinly sliced pork that was kind of fatty.

They taste OK, but they just look a little terrifying with chunks of red somethings in them...I'm always pleased with my experience there, and you get a ton of food for very little money. But, I have to admit, that I always feel like absolute crap after eating it and end up regretting my choice. So, not the best Chinese takeout, but it satisfies my monthly craving for extremely unhealthy/greasy food."], ["Mae M.", "Note: I can't say anything about delivery, since we only pick up takeout or dine in. This is definitely the best hole in the wall Chinese place downtown. They're open late AND deliver. The prices are good and the food is always fresh. If you spend $20, they'll throw in a free order of crab rangoon. It's nothing fancy, but that's not why you would go to a Chinese takeout place anyway. The spicy orange sauce they put on chicken, beef, and tofu dishes is amazing and has real orange peel in it, I really recommend trying it. They also have a really wide selection of vegetarian and vegan options and you can request 1 cup of vegetables for $1 or 2 cups of vegetables for $2 to any dish."], ["K B.", "Despite the name, it's not a buffet.

The room was filthy & they should be glad I didn't eat there. Fool me once."], ["Luisanna R.", "If you are going to order Chinese delivery in downtown do so from this place. By far the best chinese delivery you are going to find in downtown indianapolis. Couple of tips. If you place an order over $20 they will throw in a free order of Crab Rangoon. Grab an order of dumplings. I always get the fried ones but I'm sure the steamed are good as well. I recommend the Mu Shu as well so tasty but maybe you should order some extra pancakes b/c 4 really isn't enough.

It's kinda funny they don't change the sign. Building is pretty dirty and old and you can tell 90% of their business is carry out as there is like no atmosphere in the restaurant but this part of town you're very limited to where to eat.

Worth a shot if you're in the area."], ["Tim S.", "After a not-so-great experience with China King, I decided to try a new Chinese place. I was super impressed by the customer service at Hong Kong China Buffet. The woman who took my call was incredibly friendly, patient, and helpful. She walked me through several options for dishes with tofu and was very nice when I realized I didn't have my credit card on me (she remembered my order when I called back a few minutes later). The General Tsao's Chicken wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was decent. I did, however, really like the Hot and Sour Soup here. Plus, my delivery order included a free crab rangoon! Not sure if that's standard, but I thought it was a nice touch. Toss in the fact that delivery was super quick, and I was a happy customer!"], ["Catherine K.", "I ain't proud. Sometimes I just want Chinese food and I want it delivered. Hong Kong fits the bill. It's not the best but it certainly isn't the worst in Indy.

I had no idea what it was at first but it was spicy and I wanted what I ordered, so I called back. After waiting for 10 minutes on hold, they finally picked back up and I again told them my issue. She asked for my address to look up my info and then asks me again what the problem is. I repeat my issue again and she tells me that's what I ordered. So I go back to say no, I ordered Chicken with Broccoli not Spicy Garlic Broccoli or whatever this is. She then proceeds to argue with me about how that is what I ordered.She keeps repeating it over and over like it was going to make me back down and change my mind. Why would I order something that I don't like? \u00a0After about 2 minutes of this back and forth, I again tell her what I ordered and that my roommate had been sitting there during the call and had heard the whole thing. After this she finally compiled and agreed to replace my meal and that I had to give them back the other food.Last I checked telling a customer they are wrong is not the way to go about getting business. Arguing with them about it is even worse. Because of them I will never order from them again, I'd rather drive and go get better food or order from the other mediocre place anyways. Besides, they probably turned around and gave my food to someone else anyways.We used to order from them about once a week but as of today we never will again."], ["Karl A.", "Great chinese, near downtown.

We were going to do family style but after smelling and tasting a bite my husband said nevermind. It was mainly thick flavorless noodles with a very small sprinkling of thin carrots, tiny chicken chunks, and possibly small strips of cabbage (although I am honestly not sure what it was). Made me sad as I was really craving good lo mein. My husband had the sweet and sour chicken which was soooo overcooked it was like eating fried rubber bands (or fried bits of plastic, as per my husbands description).

Like...we used to go there twice a month when we lived in Broad Ripple, but since we've moved...waitresses ask \"Where have you been?\" when we stop in. I think I've tried all of the appetizers and at least a dozen entrees. Love the egg drop soup. It's very tasty, and it is NOT that viscous bright yellow stuff many places serve. My partner says they have the best egg rolls in the city and he pines for them. I think their crab rangoon are the best because the flavor is good (not just straight cream cheese) and there is a sliced piece of crab (okay...Krab) in each one. They're freshly fried in thin skins which arrive crisp and bubbly. Yum! We both love the roasted pork appetizer. The combo app is a good choice because you'll get to try everything. I'm addicted to \"General's Fried Tofu\". Its sauce is spicy and fresh and is NOT the spicy neon red syrup most places use on their chicken. Several of our friends claim the best General's Chicken in the WORLD can be found here. Another favorite is the Pan-fried Noodles with Pork. One night our waitress told us \"This is what we eat--Chinese people like noodles this way!\" Service is generally very quick and we've never had our entrees arrive while we're still eating our apps or soup. Most of the servers are friendly and all of them are quick. The interior brings me back to the old Chinese restaurants in Cleveland where my parents took me as a child. Lots of decorations...dragons, phoenix(es?), an aquarium, fancy lights with red thread and jade, and little souvenirs for sale. The main dining room has booths around the edges and tables for 4 to 8 in the center. There's also a more private room where we had a birthday dinner once (no extra charge) for 12 people. In the years that I've been coming here, I've never had a bad experience.

Happy to say we both loved this establishment!The hot tea service is $3.50 each but delicious! We got the oolong and it was quite tasty and served in a very nice pot. Loose-leaf tea is always a plus, and we were also able to take the rest 'to go' in styrofoam cups.For appetizer we got the pork dumplings. OMG. Just...I can't describe them well enough to even hint at their perfectness. The sauce was a perfect touch. My entree was the tangerine chicken for $12 + $1 upcharge for white meat - that is annoying but whatever. It's spicy and sweet but I asked for it mild and the result was much sweeter than spicy. My friend got a tofu dish that was rice and quite spicy! We discovered that combining both of our dishes was a smart move and a tasty result! On their own, both dishes were good as well.The waitress (Irish name, I forget) was exemplary. Very dignified, calm, gave detailed information, and had a soothing voice.

So..I'll have to give it another chance when I'm on a date or with just a few friends. The food: slightly above average. I was only wowed by one appetizer, and that was the veggie dumpling plate. Super yummy! And also bright green! Loved those. But another plate of dumplings that had chicken and carrots in them seemed a little bland. Same goes for my wonton soup. If you like your soup low on flavor (read: salt), then you will probably love it. I just wasn't impressed with the broth, but someone else in my group loved it, so I think it's a matter of preference. For my main course I got the honey sesame chicken. It tasted a bit like a honey BBQ glaze. Also, it's dark meat. You have to pay extra if you want white meat. Just an FYI. While the soup was bland, I felt the honey sesame chicken was a little too in your face with flavor. And it was saturated in the sauce. Perhaps I didn't order the right combo.

I did the tangerine orange sauce with my rice and veggies, and it was delicious. The food was great, but the service left a little bit to be desired. Don't get me wrong.. Our server was very polite and very knowledgable about the menu.. But she kept forgetting things. I ordered the green tea with a side of ginger honey. She forgot the honey until I asked for it. I asked for extra napkins three times before they arrived. Our water glasses were empty most of the time while we were eating, and to get them filled, we had to ask.

The heat in both the hot and sour soup and the garlic chile chicken is much like the bite of horseradish. At first it's just a bit of heat. Then about the fifth or sixth bite it kicks in.

I had the veggie spring rolls which were much larger than I've seen, comparable size to a typical egg roll. They were quite delightful, fresh flavors and crispy exterior that wasn't greasy. I also had the veggie dumplings, steamed as recommended by our waiter. The dumplings were authentic and not an Americanized version. They come 6 to an order which is the perfect size for sharing or if you're looking for a light dinner option. After eating all of that if you can believe I then had the tangerine chicken, shoutout to Naisa for letting you adjust the spice level if you're a wimp such as myself and can't handle the spicy life. Also, you can upgrade to white meat chicken as opposed to dark meat for I believe $2 extra? The chicken was moist and the tangerine sauce was flavorful without being overly thick or having a strong rice wine vinegar taste. Mixed in with the sauce were sugar snap peas and broccoli because you've got to feel a little less guilty stuffing you're face when there is some green on the plate, right?

With the soup (and for the others at the table) they served crispy wonton strips with duck sauce and hot mustard. I could have eaten about 1000 of them. So tasty.We also go an appetizer of steamed pork dumplings which were pretty good. I really liked the dumpling dough and if I went again, I would give them a chance fried as well.For our entrees I got tangerine chicken. It came with vegetables in the sauce and steamed rice in a bowl on the side. It was decent and you could definitely tell that real oranges were used in the sauce but it just wasn't my favorite. One friend got the shrimp in lobster sauce (also served with rice on the side) and seemed to enjoy it.When it came time to get the check, it was pretty hard to track down our waiter. The place isn't that big and there were maybe 5 other groups there, but there were only 2 people working, and only one seemed to be a dedicated waiter, so he was pretty busy.Overall, not a terrible experience. It was a little more expensive than I would like for Asian food. Until I have tried a few more places in Indy, I don't know that I will be coming back. It is close to me so if nothing else is better, I may come back and try a different dish."], ["Dave M.", "Checked this place out after reading the many yelp reviews. \u00a0I had the hot and sour soup which was tasty and had the right amount of kick in the taste of the soup. \u00a0I highly recommend to order one for yourself. \u00a0My main dinner I selected the coconut beef. It came out with vegetables mixed in that were really fresh. Also they cooked it just right where the vegetables were not over or under cooked. It was just perfect. Inside you can tell many local customers come to eat here. I came from Chicago for business here and will now and will now make this place I would come back when I am here in town. \u00a0The service was also great. You need to come and try them out!"], ["Raven H.", "A friend of mine from work kept telling me how delicious the basil rice is at this cafe.

When I was in the area one day, leaving my boyfriends apartment, I decided to stop in and lord behold; this was the most delicious basil fried rice I've ever had. The basil wasn't too overbearing and the spice was perfect. I'm glad I made the choice and I highly recommend you to try it out as well!! Although it's been over 1 month since I've had this delicious rice, I'm certain nothing has changed!"], ["Holly H.", "A good friend of mine has been telling me about Naisa for a while now, saying they are the best Chinese take-out in the city. I've been resisting her glowing reviews because I was always of the mind that Chinese take-out is all basically the same. Wow, was I wrong.Naisa brings a level of freshness and thoughtfulness to their food that you don't always find in take-out. Their tangerine chicken is incredible, with serious citrus flavor infused in every bite. The pork dumplings and seafood hot and spicy soup are both also excellent. However, what really sets Naisa's food apart from other similar businesses is their sauces. Each one has an interesting flavor profile (wow, that sounded pretentious), completed with fresh herbs or spices. I haven't eaten in their restaurant yet, but I look forward to doing so in the near future. In the meantime, when you're craving Chinese take-out, look no further than this little Fountain Square gem."], ["Heather H.", "Since my original review here was from more than two years ago, I really feel it needs to be updated. \u00a0For the past four months or so, we've been getting food from Naisa probably three or four times a month. \u00a0Jason B and I have been crazy busy this year, and Naisa consistently makes delicious vegetarian food that has fresh veggies and is not overly heavy. \u00a0I can eat here regularly and not get fat from eating restaurant food, which is pretty awesome. \u00a0They also have some great seasonal dishes, so be sure to ask what they currently have that isn't listed on the menu when ordering. \u00a0We love dining in and trying new things, but our take out staples are the home style tofu, mapo tofu, basil curry fried rice with tofu, and the stir fried rice noodles with veggies and tofu. \u00a0The veggie dumplings, hot and sour soup, egg drop soup (what's up, vegetarian soup bases!), and pretty much all the other vegetarian options here are also really good. \u00a0I also have to give a shout out for their hot tea service as well. \u00a0They use whole flowers in their chrysanthemum tea, and are on it with hot water refills in the tea pot. \u00a0 This is one of our favorite places to take people to dinner who are in from out of town, as we know the meal will always be excellent."], ["Abby C.", "I have been to Nasia once before and some good Asian food sounded wonderful. I dragged the boyfriend in, and we started our dining experience. We ordered the Hot and Sour Soup (which was very good), followed by the veggie spring rolls (also very good), and we both ordered our entrees. The entrees were very good as well. The food was great. The issue was the service. While pleasant, there was only one person running the dining room. The restaurant was basically empty. Over all, there were four tables seated the entire time, and the service was S.L.O.W. It was so slow it was painful to watch. The one person they had running the dining room was not a trained waiter and did thing out of logical order. This included not waiting on tables in seating order. The couple seated behind us made the statement that it was the first time they'd come into the restaurant because they usually placed a take out order. I think if I ever (when I do) get hungry for Nasia's food, I will order out. Save yourselves the frustration. Take out."], ["Jason B.", "I just keep coming back here. It's cheap, it's good, it's convenient. Great for vegetarians. Great for meat eaters. The staff is great and if you ask for a recommendation, you can tell the answer is sincere.

I am a very picky foodie though, so I'm sure they thought I was rather annoying.Still...non-spicy Ma Po tofu with cilantro? The definition of \"ma po\" should be spicy and saucy, my friends. However, the vermicelli noodles with chicken was really good and prepared quickly. The vegetables in it tasted fresh and cooked to non-soggy perfection. Not to mention, the food came out decently quick. I say bring your non-Asian friends, because my parents would really not be that impressed by the cooking."], ["Kate D.", "So I have been here twice in two weeks I like it so much. This place is now my go to for Chinese food. I will admit the dishes seem a few bucks over priced, but in their defense they make a lot of stuff from scratch here. Which is hard to find in Asian cuisine land locked in the middle of the country here, so don't let the price be something to gripe about. This is the first place I have had Asian food that I don't think is to salty! That alone is amazing. You can also let them know how spicy you like something. Ordering the tangerine beef a little more spicy than it normally comes is totally the way to go. It's sweet yes, but refreshing and with that heat! Hot damn! The real hidden gem here is their dumplings. Both the pork dumplings and the sauce they serve them with are made there! I am sorry but that is impressive and it tastes like it too. Light delicate and and a flavorful sauce to boot! I could eat them every few days if I lived in that neighborhood. I also tried the garlic beef, it to was good, could have used a little more beef perhaps but the vegetables were as stellar as the flavor, well cooked, done but lightly crispy to the bite. Pleas give this place a try. Their tea, dumplings, food, and service has been amazing here. The lady seems to work her butt off here. I know the entry way is odd and they have no sign up front, but does esthetics really matter all that much! Cause the place is clean inside and the food is ever so delightful!"], ["Jerry W.", "I ordered the shrimp chow mein and seafood soup. I was a bit disappointed in the chow mein. It was bland. A few dashes of soy sauce helped but it could have used a little spice. Also the shrimp were over cooked and tasteless. The soup was very good. They bring a large bowl and a dipper that you can use to refill your soup bowl about three times. It was peppery and nice but could have used a bit more seafood in it. I also liked their wonton chips. They were lightly crispy and well seasoned and the dipping sauce was yummy. I enjoyed the quiet, relaxed atmosphere and the staff were pleasant."], ["Lukus T.", "really great find. \u00a0yelped chinese food in Indianapolis and this place popped up first. kind of awkward because we walked into an empty restaurant (it was about 3 pm) and the server was MIA for a minute, but once she came out was super friendly and attentive. \u00a0had the seafood hot and sour soup, general tsos shrimp (nice idea) and garlic chili chicken. \u00a0I would honestly just go with the regular hot and sour next time as it's available by the cup, while the seafood soup was only available by a large bowl, and at $8 wasn't worth the up charge given the only addition was imitation crab sticks. \u00a0both entrees were very tasty, and reasonably priced. \u00a0the fried rice was good but the steamed rice was mysteriously overcooked and very wet.these are all pretty minor things though. \u00a0overall the place was excellent, just not ~quite~ five-star. \u00a0if you get the jasmine tea (really cool presentation on this) make sure to ask for the ginger honey. \u00a0it's yum.highly recommended and will certainly return when passing through Indy."], ["Ronee B.", "I've had this bookmarked forever due to the great reviews.

There was only three other tables with people in the place.

We weren't in a hurry, but it was annoying (especially when refills were hard to come by). \u00a0My mom's tea went cold and she had to ask for added hot water due to the wait.Food sizes are huge - so I suggest sharing. The rice was nice and sticky, the way I like it. \u00a0My Kong Pao had several huge peppers in the mix I had to pick out (medium huh?), so that was a bummer. \u00a0The food was good, but nothing mind blowing. The carrots and celery were still a tad too crunchy, as if they weren't cooked enough. \u00a0As left-overs they were great since they had time to soften up.In the end, we were too full to try the ginger doughnuts they have, but I had overheard another table order them and they were waiting still when we left, so I'm not too sad we missed out on that wait.Overall, Naisa needs some wait staff and cooks in the kitchen. \u00a0I don't know if the quality has just declined or what, but I'm not seeing 4 or 5 stars out of this place. \u00a0I wanted to really love it, but sorry Naisa not happening."], ["Elizabeth W.", "A solid choice for dine-in or carry-out asian food in Indy.

A standard complaint that I have with fried Asian food (General Tso's, tangerine chicken) is that it always ends up soggy in the sauce. I've had crispy fried stuff in sauce elsewhere, so I know it's possible. The food is spicy enough for me with huge portions. It might be slightly more expensive than your average Asian food, but it is a very pretty restaurant with above average service, so I'm OK with it.

It was 2:30pm and there were 8 people in the restaurant - okay, so that's their policy. But it wasn't. 10 minutes later the hostess seated a single diner in a booth. I ordered the Hot and Sour Soup, Edamame, and Pork Dumplings. The soup was very good. The Edamame was as expected. The dumplings were cold.

Chang's located in the Center City Mall in downtown Indianapolis, Indiana. This was our first visit, so we opted for the Four-Course Prix-Fixe option which includes one appetizer, two soups, two entrees, and one dessert. For our appetizer, we chose their popular Chicken Lettuce Wrap, wok-seared chicken, mushrooms, green onions, and water chestnuts served over crispy rice sticks with lettuce cups for wrapping and a spicy sauce. This dish had deep flavors, was cooked to perfection, and carried a little bite from the sauce. (Dora here. I wouldn't have minded making a whole meal out of these little goodies!) We both chose the Wonton Soup, which didn't just have an abundant amount of delicious pork wontons, but also chicken, shrimp, mushrooms, spinach and water chestnuts. For our main course, I chose the Mongolian Beef, thinly cut pieces of soy-glazed flank steak, wok-seared with scallions and garlic. The steak was very good, flavorful and tender, but I would've enjoyed it more without the abundance of large scallions. My wife ordered the Crispy Honey Chicken, battered chicken in a sweet and tangy honey sauce over a bed of crispy rice sticks. Dora here. Something about the honey sauce clashed with my tongue. Not my favorite part of the meal, but there was so much more to enjoy!For dessert, we went with the Sweet Vanilla Cream Wontons, warm and crispy shells filled with delicious vanilla cream, petite and not too heavy, the perfect way to end the meal.I would rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 forks for a family friendly restaurant that is serving great food.Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies blog"], ["Takashi S.", "All too sweet...

The place was dirty, tables were not cleaned, the bar was sticky, dirty plates and glasses were not removed. Food was mediocre, some over cooked and poor tasting. I have eaten at other P.F.

Birthday's... anniversaries... welcome-home-from-Manila trips... you name it. P.F. Chang's has always been there for me. This is why writing this review is a little sad for me. As much as P.F. Chang's has been a part of my life, I feel the chapter might be ending and I might be moving on to something better. If Yelp let me give partial credit, this review would probably be about a 1.25. Two stars just doesn't look right for this one. Picture it. Dinner. Downtown Indianapolis. 2013. A group of friends decide they want to meet for dinner on a Friday evening somewhere downtown. One of the people lives out west and loves P.F. Chang's. You want to make her happy so she comes back. You suggest P.F. Chang's. Everyone happily agrees, and then you remember this random Friday night is the SAME night they light the \"tree\" at Monument Circle, and downtown Indianapolis will be absolutely packed.When you arrive at the restaurant (after battling 4 blocks of traffic for nearly 45 minutes,) ignore the comments your friends make about how many people are waiting for a table. See, this is where P.F. Chang's saves the night. Since you thought of this ahead of time, you gave them a ring on the 'ole telephone and made a reservation. You walk past all of the people who are waiting for a table and give them your name, and you're whisked away to your table before your friends have a chance to say \"let's go someplace else.\" Seriously... make a reservation, even if you don't think you need it. With so many conventions and groups coming to downtown Indianapolis, even a random Tuesday night can be busy. I ordered the Salt and Pepper Calamari ($8) as an appetizer and the Kung Pao Scallops ($18) for my entree. Both items are different than I remember, and not in a good way. Calamari.... I struggle to find something to say positive about it. The portion was smaller, the size and shape was different (I remember nice big calamari rings... this looked like rubber bands) and the color was so pale it almost blended into the noodle-filler they sat on. After looking forward to a nice big plate of calamari, I was very much disappointed, and won't be getting this again. The Sake flight ($10) was needed to get past the pain and disappointment.My dinner entree was equally disappointing. The scallops didn't look like scallops; it looks like ground up chicken. Someone at the table even asked, \"Didn't you get scallops?\" when they saw my dish. Picking through what I call filler \"onions, peanuts, peppers\", there was actually very little on my plate that was worth the price I paid. The dish was flavorful, but scooping up food, I got more peanuts on my fork than anything else on my plate every time. I'm afraid my love affair with P.F. Chang's has come to an end. It's been a good run, but when you start messing with the quality of food and charging me $40 for what I ate last night, I'll find a place that wants my money that will reward me with fresh, high quality food... or I'll go to the cheap Chinese place and get something equal to what I had last night and pay $10."], ["Madhulika S.", "The place has good ambience. We ordered chicken and veggie lettuce wrap, some dumplings and veg fried rice. Everything was good except for the fact that the rice was undercooked. I asked the server to see if they can do anything about it. Even though he brought me a new plate it was still not very well done. He would've gotten it again had I asked.

Both couples had the meal for two - two soups, one shared appetizer, two entr\u00e9es and a shared dessert for $40. We ordered the Tropical Tea (hot) which was a very good, mild, light tea with a slight fruity taste to it. The lettuce wraps are probably the most popular appetizer, and our favorite. We also stuck with the conservative egg drop soup. For entr\u00e9es I had the Honey Shrimp which was very sweet and slightly tangy - very large helping. My wife had the ginger chicken and broccoli, which she said turned out to be pleasantly mild. For dessert we shared the chocolate dome, which cost a $4.25 up charge, and was much smaller than what the price warranted. Overall our food was very good, and the portions were quite large. The wait staff is always upbeat and fun when I have been there. The soup and appetizers came back to back, almost too quickly, but then we had to wait a very long time for our entrees to arrive. Our food came hot and fresh. The noise level has always been very high when I have eaten here - the music is turned up loud (alt. rock or EDM), and the acoustics are poor. We had to talk intentionally loud in order to hear each other. Overall, a fun place to cap off a night out on the town!"], ["Chris P.", "Great service and incredible food!!!!

Over the course of the years that I've been here, the food just doesn't seem to come out the same. Yes, P.F.

For whatever reason one time the food will taste excellent and then the next time the same exact dish will just taste off, the meat isn't cooked right, there isn't enough sauce, etc.This is generally my go to gluten friendly restaurant when I'm downtown and with people who think that this is one of the most awesome restaurants ever. I do appreciate that they label the plates, rounded with a black line and says PF Chang's, and sauces, red, from the regular food. There is a nice GF selection.

We have our favorite downtown Indianapolis restaurants and rarely branch out. But, after a wonderful performance of A Christmas Carol at the IRT, we decided to finally use this darn gift card and try out P.F.

Chang's is \"known for.\" We ordered the Chang's spare ribs as an appetizer, and they were absolutely delicious.We chose the Chang's spicy chicken and Dali chicken as our main courses and were impressed with both dishes. My husband literally did not talk, as he was too busy cleaning his plate.As we were finishing up our meal, the manager came over. She said our waitress had mentioned that it was our first time at P.F. Chang's, and then she gave us both a $10 gift card. We were shocked and wondered aloud to each other, \"Is this something they do for every new diner? They can't possibly do that, right?\"Just as we started our discussion of the economic and financial ramifications of handing out $10 gift cards to every person who claimed to be a new patron of P.F.

I told her that I wasn't finished and also wanted an order of the chicken with black bean sauce which she told us they didn't have but then said that they did have and she, again, cut me off but this time said \"45 minutes\". I, again, said that I wasnt finished with my order because I wanted to add on a roast pork egg roll. I also told her what room we were in and I told her that my order was complete and wanted her to read it back to me so I know it was correct but she said, again, \"45 minutes\" and hung up.So my sister and I decided to wait for our food hoping they would come to the right room. About 40 minutes later I get a call from a New York number and it was the delivery woman. She told me the total for my order and I told her I wanted to pay with a card. She got really rude at this point and told me to call the restaurant because she can only take cash. I asked her why I had to call the restaurant back when they hung up on me and she replied that she was in the lobby of the hotel and that it wasn't her fault. So my sister went down to pay, with cash, and there wasn't even a woman down there she had to search around for this teenage guy and when she paid he didn't have any change and our total was wrong.

It's Chinese delivery, so I won't say that I expect amazing; it definitely hits the spot, though! I have yet to wait longer than 45 minutes too, which seems pretty decent, especially considering I've ordered during some busy times. The food comes in plastic containers that are perfect for storing and re-heating leftovers, as well. I have tried the General Tsos chicken (delicious) and \u00a0the Hunan Tofu (yum) as main dishes. The hot and sour soup was not very good, but the egg drop soup was very tasty (though a bit on the salty side). Overall, this place is good, but ordering over the phone can be a bit of a challenge. Last time, the lady was fairly rude. I asked some pretty basic questions (\"What's the difference between the Szechuan and the Hunan sauces?\") to which I got some pretty bad answers (\"It's hard to explain... they're different sauces.\"). She seemed annoyed and pretty unhelpful before finally letting on that one was a ketchup-based sauce and the other was not. Otherwise, it's pretty good as far as delivery Chinese goes!"], ["Jon A.", "Now take this three star A-OK with a grain of salt, or an ounce of MSG.

They were pre-fried then pan-fried. They were huge, juicy and better than many of the gas station-attached chicken shacks. I crave pork lo mein once a month, and now I've finally decided to fulfill it here. It's $4 and it's my crack. I'm not kidding. I can't eat MSG but a few times a year because I get slack jawed and numb after eating it. But I feel on top of the world.

For example, the garlic sliced pork appetizer. There were 9 thinly sliced pieces with more cucumber than meat. The meat was sliced so thin they probably used a razor to make the cuts. This is not standard.A couple of other dishes had the same issue. The spicy fish soup had a lot more vegetables than fish. The shrimp dish had probably 10 pieces of shrimp.Fortunately for us, there was lots of rice, or we might have gone home hungry. Szechwan Garden is far superior, but it's too far away."], ["Brittany L.", "Sushi is expensive...we all know it. Thus, my sushi intake has been well under what it should be. No more, thanks to Tian Fu's happy hour from 4-6pm. With $10 in my pocket, I can treat myself to an afternoon snack or an early dinner. Both times I arrived between 4-4:30 and was quickly seated. The first time service and food prep was a bit slower, but not outrageous. The second time I had my food within about 7-10 minutes! It was even brought out by the sushi chef and he told me what everything was, smiled, and said \"enjoy your food.\" I've had the same waitress each time, she isn't what I would call friendly but she didn't mess up my order either. My first order was an eel roll, ika (squid) slices, and a salmon roll I believe. All were fresh, tasty, and properly sized. The eel arrived at the table still warm, a big plus in my book. Total was around $10 plus tip. My second order was a tuna roll, a philly roll, and an eel roll. A bit less rice this time, which was great, and everything was just as yummy as before. I'm not someone who covers my sushi in wasabi to drown out the flavor or drowns it in soy sauce either. The flavor of the fish came through without tasting \"fishy\" and the rolls were neatly made. Total? $8.50 plus tip. Even without the half-price deal, their sushi is cheaper than the Broad Ripple sushi spots and of equal if not better quality. If you have non-sushi eaters in your party, this is a good choice because there are LOTS of non-sushi dishes. There's a nice selection of Japanese and Chinese items and I think even a few Thai things? Decor is pretty and the music is nice too. Definitely not what I expected from a strip mall restaurant!"], ["Bruce B.", "This is one of our favorite go to places for a leisurely meal. We usually sit at the bar, so we can watch our sushi being made as well as look through the window at the cooks in action. They serve a very good selection of sushi and their pineapple Saki is a delicious compliment to that. We were luck enough to be invited to share a family meal one late afternoon with the proprietors/workers of the restaurant. A heaping platter of food was brought out and we enquired what it was and got invited to share in their pre dinner meal with them.If memory serves me correctly, it was a combination of a cut of pork, potatoes and whole cooked eggs. Very simple but very, very good. Such hospitality from them only solidifies why we return as we can to enjoy the food, the atmosphere and the friendly service."], ["Amy C.", "Another update, I was here for lunch today and it was probably the worst meal and service I've had anywhere.

The silverware is placed directly on the table and glasses are set out upside down with the part that touches my lips also touching the table. Maybe I'm a little bit of a germ-a-phobe but I've worked in the restaurant industry and I know how clean those towels are that wipe down the tables and lets just say I don't want my glass or utensils displayed that way! There is also a huge language barrier between the servers and clientele. I always have to point to what I want and struggle getting any special requests to come out as ordered. The head of house is an elderly gentleman and he does a great job communicating. Also the service is slow... I've never had any complaints with getting food to go, it's always ready in 10-15 min, it's hot and delicious. A great unique place for some extraordinary Chinese food."], ["Bryce A.", "Like most Chinese institutions, the food is good and the service is efficient but without personality. Have been here several times. About a year ago I went with a large group of Chinese people and the waitress tried to convince us (in Chinese, of course) to pay cash instead of with a credit card. Wonder why...More recently, I was one half of a party of two and she gave us a check with pre-calculated 17% tip. Didn't leave the itemized bill, just the total plus tip. Not sure if they just do this because it's NCAA season and want to cash in or what, but it was odd and off-putting. Won't be back. \"On Time\" near Saraga was better than this restaurant, but \"Lucky Lou Seafood Restaurant\" or any number of other Chinese restaurants in the city are probably superior options."], ["Nicole L.", "This place is straight outside of the Chinese place they go to for dinner in A Christmas Story.Very cool, very classic.

I was a huge fan of the Hong Kong Inn here on the east side and don't think I'll ever find another place that matches their food. Ever since they have closed, my desire has been to find some place that could duplicate their egg rolls (it's 8 am and I'm drooling just thinking about them). No place has even come close, until I ate at Yen Ching. Now they are not a duplication, but they are far better than the egg rolls you'll get at ANY other Chinese food place. The food here is fresh and very delicious. It is definitely my \"go-to\" for Chinese food from now on. It's no Hong Kong Inn, but it is a far better substitute than any other place I've tried!We ordered the Princess Chicken because of the previous reviews I've read. My wife favored it and I thought it was very tasty. We also order our default General Tso's chicken (known as General Zoal's chicken here). I preferred this dish. I would also never eat fried rice anywhere else!

I had to literally request a Styrofoam or plastic cup. Either way their drinks were mostly ice. So by the time you are ready to drink anything it's watered down. Honestly the place is somewhat cheap in the way that they serve their food items. The waitress forgot the rice and wanted to be even cheaper by early deliverance of the check and hand writing that she added a white rice as another charge to the tab. This establishment listed on the Indianapolis Indiana newspaper article as a best of Indianapolis restaurant... \u00a0 yea right... I cannot see how when they are truly not spectacular as you are led to believe by some of their reviews. That's the local lie I suppose.

Not great, but definitely clear of the deep pit of suckitude so common in this type of food. The woman serving us - potentially the owner's wife - was really unfriendly and we joked it was like being at the Soup Nazi's stand as she angrily shoved plates on our table as she charged by it, with nothing coming at the same time (one bowl of soup; later a second bowl of soup; later rice; later the rice and entree of the other person; last the entree to go with the cold rice delivered before).

It is a sizeable helping that comes with steamed white rice, soup, wontons, egg roll, and crab rangoon. This time I opted for a mixture of Hot and Sour & Egg Drop Soups. \u00a0Spices were right on, served piping hot, and an aroma that would make baby angles cry. \u00a0My girlfriend got the same special, but decided on Human Chicken. \u00a0With drinks and tip, we're looking at $30th total and a drive back to Carmel with stuffed bellies.On a Friday night the dining room is half full and is awaiting your arrival.

I found myself wanting to add even more to the tip my boyfriend left him, just because the whole experience was that good. The menu was a large book and a bit intimidating at first but on the first page were dinner specials. I ordered Hunan Chicken and for the price of $11.50, it came full of vegetables, with a large portion of steamed rice (or choice of fried rice), an eggroll, fried wonton, two crab rangoon, and a bowl of your choice of soup. I selected the Hot and Sour soup and it was AMAZING. As in, if I lived closer, I'd be eating this soup often.. My boyfriend ordered the General Tso's Chicken and I had a few bites of it. It was delicious as well and his order came with all of the above but for only $10.50.Our server brought us our check with fortune cookies but also brought out two slices of complimentary watermelon for dessert.

Service was very warm and friendly and my food was ready rather quickly."], ["Jon C.", "The first time I heard about this place I was a little skeptical about it because it was clear out on the east side, but after I read through some of the reviews, I decided to give it a try. My group stopped in on a Friday evening about 6:45, and the place only had a couple of parties, and we felt like we had the place to ourselves.This place is really neat looking, both inside and out. The outside looks unlike any other restaurant in town, and the inside was decorated simply yet authentic. I like that they covered the windows so you could still in light in, but you didn't have to look at Arlington Ave as you dined.Large selection of items on the menu, almost to the point of being overwhelming. I went with a Kung Pao chicken with Hot and Sour soup to start. Both items seemed to be missing the heat that I was expecting and were somewhat bland to me, but were still very good. It made me question whether or not the problem was the food I had eaten that evening, or if all of the other places I've eaten were just ruining the dish with too much heat. Either way, I'll go with something hotter the next time I come and see if it makes a difference.In addition to the outstanding service that we got from our server (which was a solid A+), I liked that rice came out for the table with our meals, and a second thing came out as soon as we all had our first few bites so we didn't run out.

The only soup available that could be made vegetarian was the Vegetable Soup, which I ordered a large order of for around $4.25. The waiter told me that they usually prepare it with chicken broth, but that they didn't use it when they prepared my soup. I think they may have just used hot water as the replacement broth instead. The soup tasted very bland and only contained soft tofu, cabbage, and maybe a few green onions. Really not that great.I'm guessing that the four star reviews are based on the low price of the food and non-vegetarian options.

The hot and sour soup is also amazing.Not to mention the service is always friendly and prompt. Lunch dishes, even with an appetizer and soup, are served literally in under 7 minutes like clockwork.

Fancy lanterns, carved chairs, oriental screens. There are booths as well as several large long tables for big groups. Food has been freshly prepared and very good each time we've gone. (This is the closest sit-down, non-buffet Chinese to our home.) The Po-Po Platter brings back childhood memories of grilling the skewered meat at the table and the items are thoughtfully arranged. This restaurant has very good food presentation. There is lots of fresh fruit used as garnishes and as dessert too...usually oranges but if it's summer sometimes melons. My favorites are the curry dishes...so tasty! The egg drop soup actually has some veggies in it as well as tofu cubes. Portions are HUGE! Last time we went he had Veg. Lo Mien and I had Sesame Chicken. We eat got 3 full meals out of our entrees. This past time we noticed \"early bird\" specials from 3-5 which were quite a bit cheaper from the regular entrees. There were also combo entrees for dinner which came with soup, egg roll, rice, and 2 crab rangoon for only $1-2 more than the menu entree price. A good deal. The owner and the servers are very friendly and make a special effort to keep little kids happy. Service is quick and you're not left wanting for anything as the servers frequently check back for drink refills and anything else you might need. But the shark fins! The image of a shark, his fins and tail sliced off, slowly drifting down to the floor of the ocean...I can't get it out of my head!

Crab rangoon, black mushroom and veggies, and Kung Pao pork. Everything was fresh tasting and the portions were very generous. The mushroom dish was my favorite, but I'm a mushroom kind of guy. There were at least 4 types of mushrooms and they were glad to make it spicy for me. These two entrees were more than enough to feed 4 people. \u00a0I found it to be very affordable and the staff were all very friendly.

Alex K -- leader of the brigade -- helped put together a family style dinner featuring the owners favorite dishes. The owners... a husband wife duo, one Korean, one Chinese, but I can't remember which is which and they serve up Korean-Chinese food. The way Korean food is featured in China? Or Chinese food is featured in Korea? I simply can't remember the order of things because -- 'tis the season -- we were given gift after gift of a course. The owners ability to be so affable and pleasant *and* funny while serving up course after course to 25 people was inspiring. I mean... imagine 6 courses having to be cooked, explaining each of them, and then doing laps personally serving up each person. The highlight for me? The spicy tofu / bean curd. Think palak paneer missing the weird cheese, the weird spinach, then add a lot of spice and awesome. The other high light: the noodles and the noodle soup. Noodles in black mushroom sauce was more comforting than American comfort food. They served 25 people 25 personal bowls of spicy noodle soup and if everyone left I would have at least attempted to eat all of it. What puts them over the hump to five stars?

Then, I moved to Irvington last year and encountered some wonderful longstanding neighborhood favorites, such as Foon Ying and the grand Oriental Inn. While it's true that Oriental Inn's Arlington Avenue surroundings aren't the most inspiring, the inside of the restaurant is very clean and has the classic decor of the Chinese restaurants I remember from my childhood--places where you went for a sit down meal, not a mere dine and dash. On my first visit there, I was intrigued that they offered kim chee fried rice. Salivating at the thought of these two things cooked together, a rare sight around here, I ordered that and an equally enticing plate of rumaki. I immensely enjoyed both dishes, but what really stood out to me was the friendly customer service and how the servers and the owners genuinely seemed to care what you think of their food and readily make suggestions on how best to enjoy it. For example, one of the owners saw me dipping my rumaki in hot mustard sauce and insisted I try their house hoisin sauce with it. He then compromised, saying \"Okay, I can tell you like your sauces spicy, so let's mix the two.\" He mixed a little hot mustard in with the hoisin, and it was delicious. I appreciated the guidance. Later, I complimented my waitress on the rumaki, and she told me exactly how to make it at home, sharing some tips I never would have thought of. So, I was thrilled with my dining experience. Recently, I brought my wife back with me, reluctantly agreeing to get a carryout order. I quickly learned that they give their carryout customers the same hospitality as those who dine in. I was told it would be about a 10-minute wait and that I should have a seat at a nearby table. A waitress brought us a pot of hot tea to drink while we waited. Later, the hostess brought us wonton chips, kim chee and pickled celery to snack on while we waited. It wasn't a long wait, but we were hungry and it was nice to snack a bit. That was most assuredly the first time I ever left a 20 percent tip for a a carryout order! Now my wife is sold on the place, too, thank God.The food is great at Oriental Inn, and there's a better variety of dishes than you'd get at the average local Chinese place. But, what I believe will really keep me coming back is the friendliness of the staff and their efforts to expose you to new foods and preparation methods you may not have considered before. So many times I've been met by grouchy hosts and hostesses and unexciting food at Chinese restaurants. These, in my mind, have been lumped into an alphabet soup of random Chinese names. Friendly places like Oriental Inn are the ones you remember -- for a long time."], ["Sloth Master C.", "Great restaurant run by a great family.

It makes sense in retrospect- like we have American Chinese and Italian, other countries have their versions of various cusines, and we were privledged to try some at the Oriental Inn.

The dishes themselves were so good- a happy melange of spices and meat and veggies that I couldn't help but stuff myself.

I began to lose my patience. All this time, there were no other orders, I questioned how busy he actually was, as he stated on the phone.I took my daughter to the restroom, which definitely could use a good thorough cleaning and then back. I wanted to show her some of the decorations around the place and it caught my eye as he dropped a piece of chicken or crab rangoon (uncooked) on the floor.

Alas, it was approaching 10PM on a weeknight - not exactly the best time to find decent grub. Imperial Palace (better called \"Bobby's\") was one of the few places open 'till 10, and we got there literally 5 'til.

After ringing us up -- but before charging my card -- Bobby said \"This will be about 20 minutes - is that okay?\" \u00a0This floored me, not only was the guy willing to let us in almost at close, he was actually concerned about making us wait! \u00a0At this point there was no question we were willing to, but our throats were a bit parched and a drink seemed in order. \u00a0He suggested we walk next door to some sort of hybrid bar/restaurant, then swing by whenever we were finished with the drink. \u00a0Unfortunately, the place was closed, so we returned to SG.Bobby asked what brought us back so quickly, we mentioned the closing and asked if it was okay for us to sit & chat. What happened next ranks among the best customer service I have ever received (and most certainly for anything under $$$$): while my friend & I were chatting, Bobby brought us two empty cups then set a bottle of \"grape juice\" next to us. \u00a0\"Please,\" he said, \"Enjoy.\" \u00a0The three of us toasted, chatted for a few minutes, then Bobby went back to making the food.It was done almost exactly 20 minutes after the time printed on my receipt. \u00a0It took about as long to get back to my house, and the food was still piping hot. \u00a0Everything was quite good, and a special shout-out for the spring rolls - absolutely awesome!For the service alone, this is easily my favorite Chinese place in Indianapolis. \u00a0That the food is also among the best is icing on the cake."], ["Howard B.", "This ranks as some of the best Chinese food I've ever eaten...and that's saying a mouthful!

It was outstanding, No, REALLY outstanding. I also ordered an egg roll, which was one of the worst egg rolls, outside of a Chinese buffet that I have ever had. Too much cabbage, and no peanut butter.

Bobby is a natural host, and his food is delicious."], ["Beth B.", "Yup, Yup!I may change my review to five stars after I've had a chance to visit again. \u00a0I ordered carryout on new years day (night). \u00a0We ordered the double cooked pork, beef lo mein and spring rolls. \u00a0All were delicious. I had to wait a while for my order when I got there as (others have mentioned) there is only one gentleman working. \u00a0Worth the wait though. He was very kind to both me and my young son...offering him a fortune cookie while we waited.

The high quality ingredients make the food taste fresh and fantastic, but Bobby is the real selling point here. he runs the place alone with his daughter. I walked in, and it was just him, puttering around in the kitchen like it was his home, singing along to Frank Sinatra. He greeted me by name (I'd ordered over the phone) and took the time to really talk to me. He knew it was my first time in, and asked what I thought. He was incredibly friendly, his food was delicious, and it was very reasonably priced. Don't waste your time going anywhere else. I'll be going back to check his more signature dishes, but his General Tsos and Vegetable LoMein were fantastic, with all the vegetables retaining their individual flavors and not being boiled away into oblivion. I've never had better."], ["David N.", "This is definitely a place worth checking out if you're in Indy and are sick of fast food and/or meals over 2000 calories. I come from the east coast, and the food won't be revolutionary compared to what you might find in New York or Chicago. You won't find dishes drastically different from what you might be familiar with. But the service and quality are both excellent and almost guarantee a great eating experience.The place is run by the owner and his daughter, but only he was there when my group of five ate there. The restaurant is in a strip mall (as I've found much of the best Chinese food is), and has 6 four-tops and pictures of Marilyn Monroe on the walls. \u00a0We walked in at 5:30 and it was empty, with one couple dining and two people waiting for carry out when we left. \u00a0When we arrived the owner/chef/maitre-d/waiter came out to greet us and was very friendly. \u00a0Its good the place doesn't seem to get incredibly busy, because the owner took our order very personally, asking us about spice level on a scale of 1-10 (with advice) and even engineering our meal a little bit, taking one of our dishes and recommending it as an appetizer, which turned out to be the exact right amount of food. \u00a0He also made all the food fresh, most of which could be witnessed fairly easily from the dining room to the kitchen.As an appetizer we order the Yum-Yum chicken (I don't think there's a proper translation from Mandarin) which was \"their specialty\" (and not on the menu), a very good crispy chicken dish with what tasted like a light hoisin sauce, similar to what's put on Peking duck but not as thick. \u00a0One of the people in my group ordered a wonton soup, which was also surprisingly good (as in, better than that which I get from my local take out place that I love). \u00a0For dinner, we had Spicy Tofu with Vegetables (one of two vegetarian options on the menu, although I'm sure the owner could work with vegetarians to come up with more options), Singapore style Meefun noodles, Singapore style Beef, and General Tso's chicken (for one of my less adventurous friends). \u00a0All the food was very high quality. \u00a0A review on the wall explained that the owner can order especially good meat and maintain low prices because of the non-existant labor costs. \u00a0The Meefun was definitely the best dish of the night, having a more mild but very flavorful taste and full of chicken and shrimp. \u00a0The Singapore chicken was also great, which was slightly sweet. \u00a0The tofu was the spiciest thing we ordered (we told him an 8 out of ten for that) and didn't disappoint. \u00a0I didn't get a chance to try the General Tao's chicken, but it was finished very quickly.All in all, we had a great eating experience, leaving a big tip. \u00a0If you're looking for any food in Indianapolis that isn't thoroughly unhealthy or thoroughly North American in origin, I would definitely come here for a change of pace."], ["Rick S.", "As you can see from the reviews, this is a one-man show.

I was pleasantly surprised a restaruant with \"Szechwan\" in the name which are doing wonderful job with Cantanese food. Not only the food, the staff were a group of happy people who seemeed like working there. We ordered a bunch of usual dimsum dishes which all tasted pretty good. My favarite was the ribs and stuffed eggplants. Also tried the spicy noodle soup and the stir fired rice noodles. Spicy noodle soup was exellent. The stir fried rice noodle was too wet which was not exactly what I expected. The green leafy veggie with garlic was fresh and delicious. The wait stuff took care of us. They do it as the typical Cataones dim sum place :pushing the cart with dim sum dishes then you just pick whichever looks good to try. They came pretty often and gave us some nice suggestions. They kept our tea going and checked with us very often. I would say I really liked the services here. Looked they have the live seafood in the tank and a huge banquet place in the back. Would be a nice place for events. Will definitely come back when in the area."], ["Tony C.", "I'm from LA and I LOVE DIM SUM. It is one of my favorite weekend items. I know I can't compare the food here to LA but I was surprised because it was actually really really good. Not to mention, the service was WAYYYY better than LA. The restaurant is big and clean. The host and servers are attentive and nice! They push around carts for you to choose the food. They have an \"ok\" variety. It isn't overwhelming but they do have the essential items you will find at dim sum. The carts being pushed did have an issue with keeping the \u00a0food hot. Everything was just luke warm. We got the buns and those were on a tray and those were at room temperature. BBQ Pork buns and \u5976\u9ec3\u5305 yellow custard bun weren't too hot. But since this is one of the only places, I was overall impressed by them. Definitely recommend to check them out!"], ["Brittany S.", "The food was amazing! We had the Mao pau tofu, Kung pow tofu, garlic eggplant, green beans, and general tso's chicken. Everything was fantastic. The Mao pau tofu wasn't really my thing, it is very soft tofu.

The service was amazing and the portions are very, very large."], ["Bodie S.", "SPOILER ALERT: Dim sum is only served during lunch hours, which is a complete travesty in my opinion. I went here on a date with someone craving dim sum, and to much disappointment, we couldn't get it. Oh well, maybe one day I'll be able to make it during lunch hours.We ordered the pot sticker appetizers and sifted through their massive menu. I ended up selecting the sesame chicken, broccoli, and white rice. The portion was huge and I didn't even get close to finishing the whole plate. Good leftovers!

First comment was 'There's dim sum in Indiana?!?' Yes parents, even though you guys coming here probably increased the Asian population of Indy by 1%, there are some restaurants with dim sum. First comment when they actually saw the place was 'A szechuan restaurant has dim sum...?' We came on a Tuesday and there were a decent amount of people. However, it still took them a few minutes for anyone to even acknowledge us and almost another 5 minutes before we got our menus.Because they didn't have the dim sum carts, everything was ordered from the menu and came out nice & piping hot.The cheurng fun (or crepes as the menu calls it) was decent. My mom commented that they used regular soy sauce instead of the sweet cheurng fun soy sauce. Highlights//Lo mai gai \u00a0(lotus leaf wrap) - had a strong lotus leaf smell when you opened it. I thought the rice to filling ratio was perfect. My dad was a fan, which is saying a lot.Custard Roll - was soft and fluffy. We ordered them twice, two days apart. The second day was disappointing because they weren't as smooth.Egg Tarts - highly recommend. The crust was nice and flakey and the filling was very smooth. My dad used to help these make them for his dad's street cart and even he said that these were good.Coconut Pudding - my mom and I thought it was too sweet. But other than that, it had a good coconut flavor and a nice, smooth texture.Definitely don't recommend the beef chow fun. It was bland and wayyyyyy too oily even though we asked for less oil. The chef also didn't cook it well because the noodles were broken into really small pieces.Everything else we got was decent but nothing really noteworthy. My dad commented that the food tastes like what he was eating as a kid in the 70's. Not sure if that's a good or bad thing.We came again for Thanksgiving lunch and got acknowledged much more quickly. Service when we actually sat down was still very lacking.Final verdict: food was pretty good but the service was not that attentive again."], ["Kelli B.", "We started with the dumplings and the dan Dan noodles. The dumplings ans the sauce were amaZing- if I could buy a bottle of the sauce I would!! It was almost like a peanut-chili sauce. The noodles were spicy and the sauce excellent too!We also had ma po tofu and ordered the beef tips but something pork came out instead. The pork looked to be prepared similar to the photo of the beef tips on the menu- but we're mostly bone and gristle- (not my personal favorite) but the seasoning ans flavor was good anyway. The tofu is massive and we will be taking most of it home! Good for sharing. I'll definitely be back for the dumplings and noodles- and next time I'll try the whole fish!"], ["Ntianu S.", "I am a die hard Eastsider, so a trip to the Westside of town better be worth the 30 plus minute drive. Oddly enough, Szechwan Garden ended up being worth the trip and possibly more trips in the future. A friend selected this place for dinner one night. I was all for it based upon the solid Yelp reviews. While driving, I almost passed the place because it's near a part of 38th & Lafayette that I basically ignore. I was pleasantly surprised by the interior. MAN, this place was HUGE! Lots of tables and the place was simply and tastefully decorated. It wasn't crowded, so my friend and I were immediately seated.We were given a menu that was massive. Oh my stars! Where do I start? They had some truly unique items on the menu including an entire section dedicated to dishes featuring intestines and tripe. I am not that adventurous, so that was an immediate no thank you. We decided to share a pot of green tea. I mean at $1.50 a pot, why not?! Then we each chose an appetizer. I couldn't resist trying the dumplings. The dumplings were pretty tasty. Nothing spectacular although the plum sauce did add a unique flavor. Ok, now to decide on dinner. OH MY GOODNESS! You would have thought I was taking my SAT again or trying to solve world peace. I was panicking. I just could not figure out what to order. There was sooo much to choose from. Pork dishes. Chicken dishes. Oh my! \u00a0I pulled out my cell phone to check out pictures and reviewing reviews. Still couldn't decide. My waiter, a nice guy, was just not very helpful with providing me with recommendations. After what felt like an eternity, I finally decided on the Wonton Noodle Soup with shrimp. Yep, of all the marvelous things, this is what I ordered. Smh...My friends order came fairly quickly, but it took forever and a day for my order to come out. My friend was a quarter of the way through her soup, which was a looonnnnggg time considering how much we talked in between. My waiter did apologize, which was appreciated. When my soup finally arrived, my initial reaction was, \"um, this is it?\" It was basically wonton soup with a large clump of noodles. Seriously? Oddly enough it was actually pretty tasty especially if you are a fan of wonton soup, which I am. The portion size was insanely large, so I took plenty home. It was a simple dish that was light and perfect for this craptastic winter weather. The menu definitely piqued my curiosity as well as my friends. For some odd reason, we want to go back and check out some of their specialty dishes and their lunch specials. \u00a0My meal was less than $15, so that didn't hurt either. \u00a0Call me crazy, but despite my odd first visit I think this place is worth a visit especially if you want something authentic, unique,"], ["Naser A.", "This is by far one of the best places for chinese food in Indy.Their lunch special is amazinh.

With a menu so big it requires page numbers, everyone can find something to eat here with little problem. Feeling adventurous? Try the frog dry pot or one of the dishes with intestine in them. Not feeling that? No worries... they have more of the typical Chinese food fare like Kung Pao Chicken, Fried Rice, Lo Mein, etc. too. There's something for everyone on the menu here.I've been here several times and have experimented a little bit with the menu, but I always get the crispy green beans and fried pot stickers. For my main dishes, I rotate between the Spicy Popcorn Chicken (which is addicting) and I've really started to get into the dry pots - a pan of food over hat that continues to bubble away at the table while you eat. I've had both the tofu and the chicken dry pots and both are delicious with lemongrass and ginger mixed into the broth.If you haven't been here before, I offer some \"newbie\" tips to keep in mind:-If you're a wine snob and only drink specific varieties, stick with water here. They have two kinds of wine: Red and White. That's right.. it's a $9 glass of wine called \"Red\" or \"White\" and my guess is that's it's of the boxed variety.-Everything that I've gotten here has been big enough to share. Most of the tables have a lazy susan built into the middle of it to assist in the family style atmosphere. Just don't forget and place your water on it unless you plan on sharing that too! -Because things are meant to be shared, the food comes out when the dish is ready, not when everything is ready. -When it's time to start loading up leftovers (which there will almost always be), ask for the plastic containers if you have something soupy or full of liquid."], ["Patrick T.", "This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Indy.

Offer the regular menu to those who may want to add to their dining.We have been seated and waiting more than 15 minutes for a cart to come and when we ask for particular items that I have seen being put in the warmer near the kitchen door, it takes an additional 15.

I have been to Dim Sum across the nation and I think Szechwan Garden is the holy grail of Dim Sum restaurants. Every dumpling, egg roll, plate of sticky rice was well cooked, well seasoned and a burst of Cantonese flavors in my mouth. For anyone that is new to Dim Sum the cart comes around and you order per plate to share with your table, picking dishes from the cart that peak your interest. At Szechwan Garden no time was wasted and the cart came the minute we sat down, so this is a great place to go if you're ready to eat now. The staff is great at explaining new dishes that you might not be familiar with and are very friendly. The restaurant is large and roomy so getting a seat is fairly easy, but they do take reservations.

We have been here a couple times now; once for just dinner ordering off the menu and a couple times for dim sum. My verdict is come for dim sum, choose something else for ordering off the menu. The dim sum is pretty solid. They have a good selection and it all will satisfy your dim sum craving. The place is huge inside and not a beautiful restaurant or anything but gets the job done. The only thing I wish they would add to the dim sum offering is Beijing Duck with the wraps, sauce and green onion."], ["David M.", "Though it's called Szechwan, this is a classic wide open Honk Kong-Guangdong restaurant. The dim sum was excellent and the menu is peppered with interesting dishes not often found in Americanized Chinese restaurants. The service is terrific.

However, the other dishes were superb, it's get 5 stars for the effort, the flavors AND for being in Indy!"], ["Robert R.", "Went once for dinner and enjoyed it very much. \u00a0I recommended it to several people. \u00a0Unfortunately, we just left after a Sunday lunch and it was very disappointing. \u00a0The food wasn't as good as last time and the service was atrocious. \u00a0We went for the dim sum and actually felt like we were being ignored. \u00a0As well, the amount of food we received was over priced. \u00a0We actually went home to finish our lunch. \u00a0We might try it again, but this last visit wasnt good at all."], ["Lynette A.", "We used to frequent Shanghi Lils before it burnt down because it was one of the best places in indy to get delicious Chinese food without the mountains of sugar that typically come with Chinese food. My spouse introduced me to this place on a whim and I could not believe the variety! Normally when you go to places, like Cheesecake Factory, with 10 pages of items to choose from its a little overwhelming. However, this place is meant for you to order several plates and share with people - the best way to do it. Dim sum for lunch, go with a crowd for dinner. And sometimes they have dim some from lunch left over so make sure to ask. Crispy duck is delicious. I'll post photos the next time we go. I know that the waitress is pretty honest - which I liked. Some might be turned off by it, but I appreciate the honesty. Don't take my word for it, though - just try it."], ["Brandon S.", "Still great food. My girlfriend and I felt very uncomfortable when we were the only ones left and the waitress was just staring waiting for us to need something or to pay for the check. I understand this is usually for speedy service at this restaurant but it can be a little overbearing and we felt they just wanted us to leave. When we were being walked to our table the host asked us what we wanted to drink before we sat down. Again,speedy service but a little too much. Our waitress did not speak English well which was okay but if she did not understand she should have asked a manager. She was very nice and we felt bad and did not want to get her in trouble. We ordered fried wontons which are great. Also got the Szechuan spicy beef soup, general chicken, and we wanted to sub broccoli for the pan friend green beans if possible. However, we ended up with the wrong soup and a giant plate of broccoli with no green beans and no chicken. We explained the problems and she asked if it was okay to keep the wrong items and just eat them. At least that's what I think she was implying. We couldn't help but to chuckle and said okay and just wanted to get the chicken. She had the kitchen cook the general chicken and brought it out but still no green beans. Everything was good but to no surprise our bill was high and still included the giant plate of broccoli for $9.95 and the wrong soup. This happens at a lot at foreign restaurants. I don't understand. It feels very uncomfortable when someone wants to charge you for their own mistakes. The manager took care of the problem and removed the items however the entire situation was uncomfortable. Also pan fried green beans are only offered at $9.95 for a family portion. I love them but if I come here alone or with one more person this is a very large and expensive side dish. I would recommend a smaller option. I'll still come back to this place for great food but the atmosphere is starting to take its toll."], ["Julianna Y.", "If you want fresh authentic Chinese food, this is the place to come. You can get fresh dim sum during lunch hours and on weekends. I love the Sui Mai, shrimp dumplings, shrimp balls, pork ribs and many more.

The floor was very sticky and didn't seem clean. We ordered lots of different dishes, and except for the pork belly dish I ordered (which was very bland at best) the food was delicious! Things went downhill from there- the karaoke system was difficult to use and seemed quite outdated. We did have some fun, though, despite the issues. Then 2 separate times guests opened the door to go out of the room and saw 'something' running across the floor of the large empty room.

The menus have pictures of some dishes in them to help people out.One point of warning is that some of the spicy dishes are slightly numbing (in Chinese called \"ma-la\").

Their lunch specials are very reasonably priced and their dinner portions are HUGE.Why the 4 stars instead of 5? Three things: 1) sometimes the service is slow at dinner - always friendly but slow - this is not an issue at lunch 2) the fact you can't get just a cup of soup at dinner time - the small hot and sour soup is gigantic and it would be nice to have just a regular size bowl/cup as an option and 3) their crab Rangoon (one of my favorite Asian items) is gross - I've tried it a few times and it's just not goodBOTTOM LINE: if you like authentic Asian food, get here now.

The inside is soft and chewy.... Yum! And the pork is perfectly flavored! Sweet and savory is my thing!!! And this hits the spot every time!Spicy beef tendon- not sure if it's suppose to be a cold or hot dish, but it was warm or hot. However, it's packed full of flavors. Spicy and a bit on the saltier side. The tendon is like a gelatin texture... Which I love... Worth a try and I would probably order it again. Beef chow fun- this tastes like any other need chow fun I have had so its tasty but doesn't blow my mind. Usually a dish I love to order. Noodles were thick rice noodles... And the beef was soft!

We had all our favorites, including shrimp har gao, shu mai, shrimp with noodles, sticky rice wrapped in banana leaves, tiny egg custards, steamed pork buns, chicken feet, taro root cakes, red bean and sesame deep fried buns, and much more.

The recent renovations also have helped, especially in regards to the former restroom.I've also tried the eggplant w. basil, dan dan noodles, scallion pancakes, and cold tofu w. 1000-yr egg; all were tasty (although you definitely experience cognitive dissonance when pondering the tastiness of a black, fermented egg).I recently tried their dim sum menu for the first time, after weeks of waiting for an opportune time to visit. \u00a0We split: the steamed BBQ pork bun (bao), fried sesame balls w. taro filling, rolled rice noodles stuffed w. mushrooms, chive dumplings, spring rolls, steamed pork dumplings w. peanuts, pork potstickers, honey-glazed short ribs, steamed sticky rice and other goodies stuffed in a lotus leaf, etc. \u00a0The BBQ pork buns/bao are the best!

In my opinion the complexity of the menu makes this a difficult detail to see. \u00a0Like a drop of water in an ocean of items. \u00a0Also my opinion - this has happened to others and they should remind people of the 4 liter capacity when they order the soup.All that said, what a meal! \u00a0The gen Tso's chicken - best ever. \u00a0Hot and sour chicken, crispy with a tasty sauce. \u00a0The chicken lo mien was better than most.

The beans had a great flavor & texture and the best little crunchy pork bits mixed in. The spring roll was crunchy and OK; had a bit of an odd taste for me, like maybe there was Chinese five spice in it, which is fine but not what I expected. I also shared some dim sum with my friends, chive cakes and sesame balls, which were also good. One friend ordered a smaller portion of eggplant in basil sauce (from the dinner menu) with chicken added. The other friend ordered shrimp lo mein. I think they liked their meals but, honestly, I was too into my own to ask.For our couple's dinner we ordered potstickers (but I think received fried dumplings?), Kung Pao chicken, and salt pepper tofu. Everything was good; my preference, in order, was chicken, dumplings, tofu. The server brought us each a bowl of steamed rice, too. The portions were HUGE and we took enough home to have a small lunch portion each the next day.For our family dinner I asked for suggestions from another friend who loves this place. She said they loved the scallion pancake and egg fried rice, so we ordered those. We thought we would only get two dishes total, plus maybe a starter, but everything seemed appealing and we were hungry, so we over-ordered. In addition to the first two things we also got the pan-fried green beans and Kung Pao chicken. Again, SO MUCH FOOD. We ate as much as we could and took home enough for two lunches the next day (although, I will admit, I ate mine for breakfast). Again, everything was delicious.All three times the service was great.

Still seems kind of like a strange place to host an event...'Walking inside, I couldn't have been more wrong. This place is decorated wonderfully and there's a HUGE area in back specifically for private parties and events.

But I'm a big girl with big girl pants, and I know what I like. Duck. Duck sounded amazing. And pig ears in chili oil also... sounded... amazing? At this point, I really was just thinking 'Why not?' So, as it turns out, other than an interesting cartilage texture, pig ears are pretty darn tasty. Especially in chili oil. Especially in chili oil with peanuts and fresh cilantro.I also want to make mention of the fact that the owner was more than happy to help me select a tasty poultry option that was soy/wheat free due to my allergies. He recommended the Cantonese Roasted Duck.Look, I don't know what kind of crack you people are roasting your duck in, but I ate it. I ATE ALL OF IT. IT MADE ME HATE MYSELF. I seriously got half way through this guy, staring longingly, wanting to save the other half for lunch the next day. But the realization that the meat would never crisp up as nicely, never taste as good, stopped me. I had no regrets, other than it physically hurt to move afterward.Szechwan Garden, I've been thinking about your roasted duck ever since. You are lucky you are more than ten minutes away.

The pork dumplings were out of this world and were the perfect start to the rest of the authentic Chinese dishes we were served following.I can't remember all of the names of the food I consumed (I was too busy stuffing my face) but just trust that whatever you get here, you're in for a treat.

The first time was for dinner, and the second time was for dim sum (Chinese brunch). If you're new to authentic Chinese food, your first experience should be Dim Sum!Their Dim Sum menu is really easy for Americans to navigate - each item has a photo on the menu, and you can try out and share several items since they are small and inexpensive. The only problem that we ran into was ordering more than we could handle! I recommend ordering 5 or 6 dishes per two people and you can always order more if you are still hungry. You can't go wrong with steamed BBQ pork buns (cha sha bao) or shrimp dumplings (xia long bao). The dim sum here is much more authentic than the dim sum buffet at Mandarin House, although Mandarin House is just $10 for the Sunday brunch buffet."], ["Sip S.", "I wouldn't know how good this place is since they were closed when we got there.

Through the lens of that experience I had a new appreciation for the quality and authenticity this restaurant as to offer (of course, among the few sweet and sour / general tso's traps for those who doggedly stick to what they know). I look forward to going back and will definitely order the cold tofu noodle appetizer.

It is far away from home, but definitely worth a stop when we are in the area.The restaurant itself went through a renovation recently, and is now a pretty large sized divided diningroom. \u00a0 They have a large fish tank (for consumption) with some creepy looking creatures. I know you guys taste good, but damn you ugly! I am glad these tanks are tucked away because they are definitely nothing like some decorative Koi. Good to know the seafood is uber fresh, though! \u00a0 Due to its location (4.5 hours away) we do not frequently dine here, and when we do we stick to the same dishes. Sorry if that bores you. I can however report that their green bean dish is awesome, it is well-seasoned, garlicky and spicy and the fresh green beans have a good snap to them. \u00a0 Also, \u00a0the ma pa tofu is very good but the dish is inherently oily. The tofu is silken tofu, of which I can only handle so much before the texture puts me off. It is not overly hot, rather it has a nice, well-balanced heat and flavor. We also like to order the mixed vegetable stirfry, which is extremely simple yet so satisfying. The vegetables are fresh, crisp and well seasoned. It is refreshing to be able to order something like this and not have to add soy sauce or other seasonings to make it appealing. \u00a0 Service is always prompt and friendly, \u00a0with the occasional small language barrier 'problems'. Just point at the menu item you'd like, it is not that big of a deal.Lastly, some insanely amazing smelling (pork?) ribs went by last time we dined in.

I got the Indonesian rice and the shredded pork and garlic sauce. The Indonesian rice is amazing, the spices and shrimp work so well together and the fried egg on top was amazing. The service was rather quick if not rushed but was still pretty quick. Our drinks were never empty and our servers were more than attentive.

However, this place is incredible. If they aren't making everything from scratch, then I'm not sure how they're doing it. The spicy wonton appetizer is as delicious as it is unique. I've eaten at \"The best Chinese Restaurant in Indy\", according to a local publication, and China Bistro is much, much better. \u00a0The only negative is the location and that's more a negative for them than for me. I've seen a lot of people waddle in expecting to pull a chair up to a buffet only to turn around and walk out when they discover its a really nice sit down restaurant. This is by far the best Chinese food in the city. You can pay twice as much for food half as good. After eating here over the past year, I've started to feel bad about not telling more people. Now they are the only reason I created this Yelp! account as well as my favorite indulgence."], ["Ava L.", "Love this restaurant! I think the locals are snooty about it because it's in the same parking lot as a Walmart and a Dollar Tree, but this is one of the best Chinese restaurants in all Indy. I'd say it's #2 when it comes to food, but definitely #1 when it comes to the whole package of food, price, service, and ambiance. First, it's beautiful on the inside. Definitely worthy of a date night. There's a waterfall and koi fish inside when you first enter. The lighting is romantic and the atmosphere is VERY quiet. Kind of makes you feel self-conscious if you're dining alone. This is obviously meant as a sit-down, take-your-time restaurant, not the kind of place where you hurry in, smash some food in your mouth, and go.Secondly, the service is \u00a0just so-so, but consider that there are very few staff and you might not mind the timing so much. They do get more courteous the more that you visit! I've been there about 6-7 times now and the service immediately went from ok to stellar from the 3rd visit up.Next, the food choices are wide-ranging and there is always a special. I brought my vegan friends here and they really liked it, as well, but to be honest I've had better vegan food. Just keep in mind that fish by-products and broth go a LONG way to changing the flavors of the food, so meat-lovers and pescatarians, you will enjoy the food the way it was meant to be eaten! The hot and sour soup was DELICIOUS, just the proper amount of sour and a lot of well-developed flavor in the broth. The spring rolls, penang curried shrimp, and bak kut teh are authentic and delicious. The pad thai is amazing, as well. My unadventurous friend had the chicken with broccoli and really liked it. Dishes are $8-14 on average for dinner. The green tea ice cream was a good finisher. \u00a0If you order from here for takeout, they tend to be very fast and the portions are huge! Hope this place attracts more people because there's not many amazing Asian restaurants like this around Greenwood or even Indy. Like so many other reviewers, what first brought me here was the Groupon. I love a great deal, but trust me when I say it's worth every penny full price (mostly because it's not that expensive to begin with)."], ["Deb R.", "A hidden gem. \u00a0Above average food. \u00a0I haven't had above decent and savory Chinese food like that in a very long time. \u00a0The service was very scarce, \u00a0lazy and haphazard though. \u00a0I am giving this restaurant 5 stars based on primarily the food and the decor quality - not the service. \u00a0We waited and wondered for awhile when someone was going to seat us when we first came in. \u00a0We also waited an unusually long time before a server showed up at our table. \u00a0We kept looking toward the front of the restaurant and saw a few employees socializing, but not paying attention to the patrons. \u00a0When she finally showed up and and took our drink order, we made sure to order our meals at that time for fear of not seeing her again for awhile. \u00a0Call me funny, and more so psychic, but I just had a feeling after our initial experience at the front door, and waiting in her to initially to show up at our table, that we would be waiting on her as a general rule during our entire dining experience. \u00a0Our server ended up giving us our appetizers before we ever saw our drinks. \u00a0I was just about ready to get up and try to find her. \u00a0So,.....we finished the appetizers, and we still had no drinks. \u00a0In a split second just before our meal came out, she gave us our drinks and then half apologized for forgetting. \u00a0The decor was very nice, clean and calming. \u00a0The lighting was very low and mellow, so the ambience was on the intimate side. \u00a0The booths were very comfortable. \u00a0And appropriately soared apart for privacy. The price was nice, as the deal of the day was all chicken dishes were 7.95 each. \u00a0 For being a Saturday night, I was impressed. That shaved off roughly about 3.00 from each meal. I had the ginger chicken, and my fianc\u00e9 \u00a0had General Tso chicken. \u00a0Both dishes were awesome and highly flavorful. \u00a0The appetizers were great too : regular/standard pork/cabbage egg rolls and shrimp tempura. \u00a0The shrimp was breaded, and I was expecting it to be batter fried instead. \u00a0Regardless, it was OK. \u00a0It very well could have even been pre-frozen shrimp. \u00a0 The creamy dipping sauce was a nice and tasty touch. \u00a0 The egg rolls were a little on the small side. \u00a0They looked like a spring roll. \u00a0They did on the other hand, taste house/home made. \u00a0They were served with a light sweet and sour sauce. \u00a0I would have preferred a hot mustard condiment dipping sauce with it, but once again, \u00a0the waitress was no where to be found, I was very hungry and they were getting cold. The food was served hot which is always a plus. **** Finally, I will note the place was dead with barely anyone in there. \u00a0It was very surprising. \u00a0I am not sure what the problem is. \u00a0It's location is perplexing, as it is obscure. \u00a0 Maybe the good word hasn't gotten out about them ? \u00a0I just don't know at this point. \u00a0I am not exactly sure how long this restaurant has been open. \u00a0I know there used to be a big Mexican buffet there before them, and then a huge Chinese buffet. \u00a0My suggestion to this restaurant, would be to have more attentive service, \u00a0otherwise it's a perfectly great place to dine. \u00a0It would be a damn pitiful shame if this place shuts down, because no one has a clue about them. \u00a0I absolutely plan on going back soon.****************Update: We went again recently. \u00a0We made the mistake of going off the beaten path and ordering something else. \u00a0 We didn't care for what we ordered as much as what we ordered initially in my first review. I ordered the chicken pad Thai and my date ordered a spicy hot chicken red curry dish. \u00a0His dish definitely did not have enough curry in it, and fell very flat on overall flavor. \u00a0My pad Thai was OK, but don't think I will order it again. \u00a0The appetizers were acceptable again.**************Third time visit : And we are back on track! \u00a0;o) My ginger chicken was excellent. \u00a0My date's general tso's chicken was great too. Appetizers were spot on - regular egg rolls and shrimp tempura. \u00a0The service was great. \u00a0We had a sweet/friendly and attentive server. \u00a0They work with a skeleton crew; as it's never busy, so I really hope this place stays in business! It is seriously really one of better Chinese restaurants on the southside of Indy.****************4th visit : spicy/hot garlic chicken - it is a winner winner chicken dinner. \u00a0The pan fried potstickers/pork dumplings are awesome too. \u00a0;o) The next time I am trying the spicy hot chicken with the sherry sauce."], ["Pam B.", "Delicious.

It does seem kind of out of place in this plaza, I dont think anyone would of guessed it. The decor is quite fancy. Very elegant and plenty of seating. And it felt comfortable to not be all dressy in quite an elegant seeting. It seems when we came in only a quarter of the restaurant was filled on a Monday night. We came here because we had a groupon deal. My grouponing and yelping always goes hand in hand lol. They had a extensive menu and it was hard to decide to what to get. We decided to the dinner for 2 just because it seem easier. it was 2 for $38 and was worth it on top of the groupon we used because it was a lot of food. The ginger salad seem kind of like frozen dressing, maybe it was just thick, but once I mixed it it was well blended and was very good. After salads we did once of each kind soup. Most amazingly good and came out super hot. Adding the wontons gave the soup crispness. The food always kept coming, we never had to sat and wait for anything to come when we were done. Service was wonderful. We got our calamari and it was good. It was tender in the inside and crispy on the out and that dipping sauce was sooo yummy! I even added lemon i got from my water to the calamari and it gave it a kick. Finally we got our entree and I did the sweet and sour chicken and my bf did pork du. Its normally something we never order, but being a chinese restaurant where stuff is made to order why not. By getting to the entree I was too full, I literally couldnt take another bite and the food was quite good. Good thing my boyfriend being the garbage disposal he is is always there to lend his stomach to help me eat my food lol The sweet and sour chicken was good. I love fried food so cant go wrong with that, although I was expecting something a little different without the fried batter. It had bell peppers and pineapple for sweetness. My bf did the pork du and even though the name was kind of funny this was good. I usually would ask foe some kind of hot sauce with my food that everything was good that it didnt need any. To end our dinner we got 2 dessert and the Coconut Jelly was amazing! This is refreshing and it almost taste like almond. It seem like such a simple dessert but trust me its good. As for the green tea ice cream, it was ok. I think I would of happier with a green tea mochi. Overall this place is great and I hope they continue to thrive and bring in more customers.

Not marketing.I had a custom order and it was executed perfectly and without a hint of complaint. The Pad Thai was flavorful and decently spicy. Salt and pepper calamari was perfect. The only complaint is that they don't have brown rice.Other observations: Coke products, quiet but not dead, comfy seating with no arm rests, very wheelchair friendly, attentive but not intrusive service.Some people have mentioned coupons.

I say this because the decor is beautifully appointed and it makes it a pleasure to eat in here. Please patronize this establishment. This is by far the best Chinese food on the south side, if not in the entire metro area. We have been for lunch and dinner, each time the servers were great and the food was super. They have great lunch specials. For less than $6 you receive a chicken entree, fried rice, soup and an egg roll. My wife and I both enjoyed the General Tso's Chicken lunch combo. Plenty of sauce with a great flavor, not too sweet, not too spicy and all white meat chicken, fried to perfection. I had the wonton soup for $1 extra, 3 huge wontons in broth. My wife partook in the egg drop soup. Both were very good. The egg rolls are on the smaller side, but worth it. They are not overstuffed or overfried, like you find at most of the other places. Plus they come with a delectable dipping sauce. The time we went for dinner, it was a Saturday night and we had the the dinner special, which was any full sized chicken entree for $7.95 which comes with steamed white rice. We upgraded to fried rice this evening. My wife had the General Tso's (see review above) and I had the pineapple chicken. The pineapple chicken, again all white meat chicken with pineapple chunks and bell peppers. The sauce was sweet but was quite tasty. We also shared the beef lomein that evening. My wife said that it was the best beef lomein that she's had in the area. I have to agree with her. The noodles were cooked to perfection, the beef tender and juicy and the sauce was again very flavorful.

The entrance is nondescript, and I was expecting a standard \"cheap takeout Chinese\" joint -- y'all know what I'm talking about -- but I was blown away by the HUGE space and lovely decor of this restaurant. Yes, this is a legit restaurant that reminded me of a fancy Asian steakhouse. Even the restroom was sparkling clean and smelled delightful, which is noteworthy in itself.I ordered carryout soup and pork dumplings, so I can't really speak to the service, but the two ladies that helped me were charming. After seeing the gorgeous decor, I was expecting to be wowed by the food...... but I like the soup at my normal \"cheapie\" joint better. And this was a few bucks more expensive. I definitely wouldn't rule out a future visit to try more on the menu, but this will not replace my normal place when I have a soup craving. :-)"], ["Aimee B.", "Came for lunch. Very good!

Located at 54th & Keystone in the area known as SoBro, though I'd personally consider this restaurant to be just East of actual SoBro, JS Garden specializes in Teriyaki and Asian cuisine. It's a fairly casual Chinese restaurant, though I have to be honest and say it's warmer and cleaner than I expected. It's in a small strip center storefront in the same parking lot as Rally's. It's set far back enough from the street that you can truly relax in the restaurant despite being so close to Keystone Avenue. It's comprised entirely of tables. The strip center itself is easily accessible with a couple different curb cuts and parking spaces. There's a glass front door into the building, but the restaurant's small enough that they'll likely see anyone who might be struggling to get in. As you enter, you see a sort of ordering/cooking area to the right and the dining area to the left. The walls are decorated in a warm green - there's a definite Asian flavor to the decor, but not in the usual kitschy way. There's one television at the back of the dining area. However, it's rather quiet. I arrived early in the evening dinner hour and was the only customer at that point, though three other singles had come in by the time I was done. They asked if I wanted to take-out or dine-in. Since I was dining in, I was offered my choice of tables with the appropriate chair removed and my drink order of iced tea taken. As I'm not a huge regular on the Asian/Chinese scene, I browsed the menu a bit. They offer daily lunch specials in the $5-6 range (plus drink). During the evening hours, it seems that those lunch specials become the \"small\" with a large option also available for dinners. The menu is a fairly standard Asian/Chinese menu, though I'll admit I was hoping for and did not see garlic chicken. Instead, I opted for a small teriyaki chicken special with no sides. They have all the usual sides that can certain cause the price to go up (spring rolls, egg rolls, crab rangoon, etc.). That said, my entire meal came in at least than $8.00 - So, for a price slightly higher than fast food I had a much better and much healthier meal. I went in fully expecting JS Garden to be somewhere in the 3-star range. I mean, c'mon. It's a rather dumpy little area and I figured everything would be alright but nothing to write home about. I was just hoping for a few minutes of peace after a long work day. As I entered the restaurant, I instantly felt comfortable and welcome. The interior just sort of calmed down my spirit. My server was attentive and friendly, but not hovering in any way. The woman who was cooking came out at one point to check on my experience, while she also made sure to explain the various sauces available. In short, the service was definitely a 4-star experience. I would easily go back for it. The food? Okay, sure. It wasn't the best Chinese I've ever had, but for just a wee bit more than the Super China Buffet up by Wal-Mart I actually had a peaceful meal in a clean restaurant with food that was tasty, decently sized (especially for a \"small,\" and a solid value. White rice came with the teriyaki chicken and veggies - it was a decent sized meal for less than $6 (plus $1.49 for the drink). I ate it all, sure, but I was full without having the usual Chinese food hangover. The food was obviously fresh and I found their advice about the spices was spot-on. As I recall, the large size was right around $8.29. I have a feeling that may have been more than I could have eaten. However, I was definitely happy with the meal and would easily order it again. JS Garden was a pleasant surprise. The staff was super friendly, the restaurant itself comfortable and inviting, and the food was well prepared and a definite value in serving size and price."], ["Nikol P.", "They are never that busy so I hope they stay around.

Sure, Broad Ripple isn't far, but this place is definitely blazing a new trail for this part of Keystone Avenue.

I ordered some small orders of different dishes, like the house special lo mein and general tso's chicken, and I also ordered some crab rangoon. \u00a0Surprisingly, at other places, when I order the small/half orders, I tend to have a lot of leftovers. Not this time. It's not actually a big problem though. The lady who I picked up my order from was also very nice.Why two stars? Well the price of the food for small size, and regular apps is pretty equivalent to many of the other chinese/american restaurants in town. However, the actual food quality, I found to be a little below average. My general tso's was mainly sweet and there was no spiciness to it. \u00a0Also, there were some meager tiny sliced pieces of carrots and broccoli. The crab rangoon was composed of a thick and chewy dough, and a tiny bit of cheese and artificial crab. It was warm. The chow mein was really greasy and the noodles over-cooked and kind of mushy.I'm sorry, but I don't think I'll be making my way over here in the future. There's just other choices around that are slightly better."], ["Jason T.", "The next thing yelp needs to do is put in half stars for ratings, this isn't really a four-star place but it's not a three-star place either.

They have fried dumplings but you'll do better to go to the freezer at saraga and fry them yourself.If you are willing to eat anything other than that you're going to have a good time at JS Garden. Try the samosa rolls as an appetizer then choose any entree they do have. So far I have had the orange chicken, general tso chicken and Kung pao chicken and have been quite pleased. They use big meaty chunks of chicken and don't bury them under a ton of breading.

What impressed me was their designation of being an Asian restaurant. They had everything from samosas and curry dishes to pad thai and General Tso's chicken. We started off with crab rangoon. It's probably the same rangoon every other place in town has but it was served hot and crispy. I chose a coconut milk chicken as my entree. I expected more of a runny sauce or broth with it. The sauce was thicker and delicious. My dining companion had the pad thai. They asked how much spice she liked. She was kind of vague when ordering, \"A little, but not too much.\" They got the order down perfect. It was a delicious meal. I would definitely recommend this place.

It was ground up ice with a little taro flavoring (i suspect they use a powder mix) And some tough, half-frozen bubbles. It made me sad to drink. It might be the worst bubble tea I have had in my life.The beef spring rolls were bland and poorly constructed; they were falling apart when I got home. The sauce with them was watery and bland as well. The pancake was about 80% bean sprouts. There was one or two shrimp pieces, a few bits of veggies, and i think something like a few slices of beef or pork it was honestly hard to tell.

The tabiyocur didn't taste fresh and she put such a little amount of it that it barely filled the bottom.

Spring rolls were nicely rolled, filled with fresh bean sprouts, and were served with a nice spicy plum peanut sauce. Pho was excellent. I've had some Pho which was obviously laced with a ton of MSG which I am very sensitive to. This Pho was laced with lovely spices, plenty of noodles and beef. Served with the obligatory \"salad\" which I added throughout the bowl. Overall this place rocks. After going there 2 or 3 times, the waitress already new my order by heart. I'd walk in, she'd come over and recite my order and I would nod enthusiastically, and minutes later I'd be downing spring rolls and slurping pho.Needless to say, my order hasn't changed much since the first time I went there.

Firstly, the food I tried was not worth the price. Not comparing prices to other restaurants, but based on this experience. AND there were only about 5-6 options :(. Having lived in San Francisco, and having delectable Dim Sum available nearly at all times, this did not measure up to my expectations. I did not expect it to be as tasty as (anything) in San Fran, but it was more expensive than some the amazing dim sum places out there. The shrimp was goood. Great texture and taste. The BBQ pork buns were flavorful, but fatty, and the meat was sparse. The egg buns were--interesting. When I was in Taiwan, I at egg tarts that has this same flavor, but the texture was different--much smoother. The texture of these egg buns was gritty. It seemed like the eggs weren't mixed all the way, and I was biting into bits of flour the entire time. Whether or not they're made with flour..is a different matter. Texture doesn't bother me all that much, but someone else may have been turned off by this. They were VERY sweet, to my surprise, as the waiter told me they were a bit salty and just kinda sweet. Oh well. I wouldn't try this restaurant again for dim sum, even if all other dim sum places were closed for the week.

Definitely comparable to what you'd find in Chicago and San Francisco, or as close as you can get in Indy.

So good! Next time, we're getting two or five! Drizzled the sauce over some white rice. YUM!-Shrimp Crepe (Cheung Fun): Not enough shrimp and needed a little green onion or something to pep it up.I think that's it, we asked for some custard tarts (Don tot) but they were baking and wouldn't be ready for 30 minutes which was a bit of a disappointment.

Wanted to see what the \"buzz by mouth\" was all about in the Asian community.

Picture menus don't do dim sum dishes justice, but for weekdays it's recommended since the turnover rate would be low especially in Indy. As soon as we were seated, we opted for hot tea as our beverage. They serve you chrysanthemum tea (better than the dark oolong at most places). It's a very pale yellow color, but refreshing. When you lift open the teapot lid - you'll see flowers that look like daisies. I know in Western culture our tea leaves are always strained, so don't be surprised to see petal floaties in your tea cup. I think of them as a veggie and eat them anyways.I like to see the carts being pushed across and randomly point to things that look appealing. You know you've got the best seat in the house if you're on the straightaway from the kitchen. The carts roll by you first, so you get first dibs on selection. The cart service was quite speedy as the waitress wheeled it directly to our table to get us started. Keep in mind, the staff may not speak English very well so it's hard for them to explain what it is. Our \"conch\" dumplings turned out to be \"corn\" dumplings, but nevertheless, still good.We got:-ha gao (shrimp dumplings) - nice chewy tapioca wrapping and flavorful shrimp filling-shui mai (pork and shrimp dumplings) - well seasoned, dense filling-phoenix claws (aka chicken feet) - so tender & gelatinous, melt-in-your-mouth - hint of star anise -peppered beef short ribs - peppery, more fatter cut of beef and a little bit of chewing needed -pork and thousand year old egg congee/rice porridge - thin and lacks any flavor. Perhaps I like mine thicker like oatmeal with the use of ground pork rather than cubed pork. Needs deep fried yuta bread for dunking!-corn dumplings - neatly wrapped & has canned corn & diced carrots along with some sort of meat filling-pork and chive dumplings - crispy outer layer with steaming hot filling of chopped chives and bits of meat mixed in-curried baby cuttlefish - like little green grapes that burst with yellow curry; cleaned really well so no seafoody smell-steamed mini BBQ buns - really white and fluffy; BBQ pork a little hard, but nice savory sauce \u00a0All were pretty delicious, except I wish the carts kept the food temperature a bit higher since they were only lukewarm. One thing I'd like to see is more variety - I didn't see any \"ham sui gok\" (fried crescent dumplings), pan-fried daikon cake, steamed rice noodle rolls, or desserts such as almond jello with fruit cocktail, mango pudding, or coconut taro tapioca which are pretty standard fare.

And the budget-friendly prices allow diners to dabble in a little bit of this and a little bit of that. I'd venture to say Egg Roll Number 1 is one of the tidiest Chinese restaurants I've been in - not that this factor has ever stopped me from stuffing my face. I highly recommend the pho tai piled high with bean sprouts, jalapeno slices and basil. It's a bit greasier than Saigon's version, but equally delicious. The spring rolls were a-okay, I'm thinking it might have been an extra-spicy batch of basil that through it off a bit for me.

Vietnamese egg rolls are wonderful, much better than the usual Chinese fare. They're smaller in diameter and they're tasty. The fried dumplings from the chinese menu are what they usually call pot stickers, but these are different - they're chicken! Usually pot stickers are ground pork, so it's different and interesting.

Even in Vietnamese, when it's not even her primary language. Impressive.

Perhaps one of the better, but I still like Long Thanh's pho a tad bit more and it's less of a drive for me. Egg Roll #1's pho wins by a margin with it's very clear and flavorful broth. I would just drink the broth alone. It only lacked in the meat quality and herbs to go with it. I'd like to see a combination of sliced beef, beef balls, tendons, and the tripe if that was a customizable option.Overall, great place if you want a very casual, affordable, and satisfying meal.

The owner is a gentleman from Tianjin, the northern part of China, and this place has some great northern Chinese dishes.There's a set menu and there's also an ad hoc menu. In addition, you can buy pretty much anything from Saraga, bring it here, and he'll cook it however you like. That is cool.The owner used to own Szechwan Garden just down the road from what he said. This place is very authentic - there's no sign out front (there is a small sign inside Saraga) and his clientele is essentially those who shop at Saraga, so he doesn't need (and is unable) to appeal to the PF Chang crowd. If we lived near here, we would essentially outsource all of our cooking to this guy.There are only 2-3 tables so a lot of people take out. The prices are lower than comparable Chinese restaurants. This is a must go if you are into authentic Chinese food. Avoid if you are the PF Chang kind of Chinese food eater because there is no decor, atmosphere, or presentation."], ["Jessica R.", "We tried an array of dishes and were very impressed! I'm not a fan of the goat soup but I have nothing to compare it to. I'm definitely getting food from here again."], ["Vijetha Y.", "Best Chinese I have tasted in Indianapolis. Though it's \u00a0authentic, it appeals to everyone. I love the fried rice and noodles here"]], "Fei Da": [["Cierra M.", "I work downtown and this is BY FAR one of the best chinese food delivery places around! Ive been impressed with about everything I've tried from here. The general tso chicken is really great, really meaty peices with a light batter. I hate when you get all breading and a little piece of chicken inside. \u00a0This place got it right!! The shrimp with broccoli was delicious! Very generous sized shrimp and fresh broccoli! The chicken lo mein was pretty standard to most chinese restraunts, but had meatier peices if chicken. \u00a0The sesame chicken was decent. \u00a0The crab Rangoon was a little bland but pretty standard. \u00a0But most of all the teriyaki chicken was amazing! The marinade they use is so tasty and unlike any I've ever had. The meat was so tender too! I would go back for those alone! Delivery is prompt and they are very friendly! Portions are VERY generous, and prices are pretty darn reasonable!"], ["Danielle N.", "I was pretty grossed out by this chinese food. I ordered the beef & broccoli and an order of chicken fried rice. I have never see food look like this in my life! The beef was a very light slimy color, and the sauce that the veggies and meat were in smelled horrible! The taste was even worse. I was so hungry and could only eat 2 bites before throwing everything away. The chicken fried rice was a weird yellow color and also smelled like baby powder or something. I don't understand what all of these people with good reviews are talking about. PUKE!"], ["V W.", "Went here for the first time as grub hub gave me a valuable coupon. I ordered the general tso, steamed dumpling and chicken mei fun (thin noodles). I figured it would have been like any other chinese take out restaurant but I was wrong. Food appeared freshly made almost. The General Tsos was lightly battered/not soggy, steamed dumplings had no frozen taste to it (wanted to be healthy over the fried ones), and the thin noodles were light as well. All this was a bit over 20$ without no coupon and all had large portions. They do have healthy options if you wanted. I would say this is as good as it gets in terms of take out (they also have roasted duck as well which is not usual). Can't compare them to the dim sum spots on Lafayette but thats a different market altogether. Better than Best Taste on campus but not too far a drive. It's worth it."], ["Luisanna R.", "We just moved to a new area and I am always hesitant to order chinese delivery. The only way to find out if it will be good is by checking it out. I had ordered over Grubhub and I'm not sure if that slowed down the delivery however I'm sure next time I will call on the phone. The food arrived in about the time that Grubhub said it would and it was very great! I had ordered something called Noodles Peking style. I know that I like Peking duck so I thought I'd give it a try for just over $5 it was a HUGE bowl of noodles. They were very tasty too. I also loved that my combination plate was good too. There wasn't so much sauce on my chicken that it completely obliterated the rice. I think the fried dumplings could have been fried just a tiny bit more but overall the food was good and the driver was super friendly so I was very happy with my order and I will be ordering again."], ["Jennifer T.", "Had Teriyaki Chicken Skewers and Sweet & Sour Chicken again last week and they are great! Rice is always cooked perfectly!"], ["Tiffany G.", "This is like buffet food and I've had way better buffet food than this...we ordered sweet-and-sour chicken shrimp fried rice vegetable fried rice beef and broccoli and crab Rangoon....The chicken was a very hard the egg rolls were so greasy when you bit into greased dripped everywhere The rice wasn't bad but had a lot of onions in it crab Rangoon it was horrible the beef and broccoli was about the only thing I could eat"], ["Abhishek B.", "Very friendly service and they are very particular about taking care of all order details. The delivery was pretty prompt and reasonably priced. A very good alternative to pizza delivery."], ["Trent H.", "I called about 30 minutes before close on a Friday night for a carry-out order. The gentleman who answered the phone was extremely friendly and made sure to tell me that there was an additional charge for fried rice with my meal. I got the General Tso's Tofu, which was absolutely delicious. The gentleman on the phone confirmed that I knew where their location was and told me it would be ready in 10-12 minutes. The order was done right on time, and I'll definitely be going back here in the future. If you want well priced Chinese food for carry-out you'll be tough pressed to find a better value in the area."]]}
