{"The Capital Grille": [["Clyde W.", "First of all, excellent place to grab some dinner with a loved one. Just expect to pay quite a bit more than your average restaurant. I went last Thursday with my girlfriend, this being the first time either of us have eaten here. The interior is very clean, well decorated, and elegant. Classy is the first word that came to my mind when walking in. Our waiter seated us immediately since we made reservations ahead of time. The table was beautifully set out for us. I ordered us a bottle of Merlot to start. I'm not much of a wine guy so I couldn't tell if it was any good, but my girlfriend loved it. For the life of me I can;t remember the name of the steak dish I ordered, but yah it was steak with a side of garlic mashed potatoes. It came with some kind of sweet vinaigrette sauce on top, seriously one of the best steaks I've ever had. Cooked to perfection too. All I can say is you get what you pay for here. I usually find it hard to justify a $20+ meal, but I totally think The Capital Grille is worth every penny."], ["Whitnie E.", "I recently came here on my second visit for my anniversary with my husband, and it was his first experience. My parents had called ahead of time to alert the restaurant that it was our anniversary, and they did such a nice job to make the experience special. They greeted us upon check in, and showed us to a nice, private table which was sprinkled with rose petals and had a \"Happy Anniversary\" card signed by the staff on the table. I thought that was very sweet. My parents also sent us a bottle of champs to celebrate, and that was there waiting for us and we were immediately served two flutes of bubbly. The meal itself was superb. We started with oysters on the half shell (my fave!) and were not disappointed - they were so good and so cold. We both followed up with a steak. I chose the bone-in filet, Oscar style. I mean, first the steak itself was so delicious and tender. Then topped off with yummy crab meat, rich b\u00e9arnaise, and light, refreshing asparagus. It was cooked to perfection, and there was not much leftover (no regrets on that). For our sides, we chose the Parmesan Truffle Fries and the Roasted Brussel Sprouts with bacon. My mom would be proud - those brussel sprouts were so good, we barely touched the fries (they were good too- but the rich, and salty sprouts won out!). We ended the night with a glass of port and cr\u00e8me br\u00fble\u00e9, both of which did not disappoint.All in all, the service was spectacular and our food matched the service. We will definitely be back!"], ["Amber C.", "I was very excited to eat at The Capital Grille for the first time. \u00a0I am a big sucker for a well cooked steak. \u00a0However, our experience was a mix of good and more 'not so good'.To start off, I need to say that we had $100 gift card from when my fianc\u00e9 purchased my engagement ring. \u00a0We were told to mention this when making our reservations. \u00a0I was able to get 7:30 dinner reservations when I called, even though open table was busy. \u00a0To my surprise, there were many tables open when we arrived.We sat down and got our menus. \u00a0This was our first not so great experience. \u00a0We were never given devour downtown menus-or told that they had a devour menu- which would have saved us some money and allowed us to try a larger variety of foods. \u00a0I actually said to my fianc\u00e9- oh I guess Devour Downtown is over now. \u00a0I didn't realize that devour menus were being passed out until after we placed our order when new tables were being seated. Every other table had a devour menu and was told about it when presented with their regular menu. \u00a0I prolly took it too personal- but felt that because we had the gift card- we weren't given the Devour menu as an option.We ordered the pork belly as an appetizer as well as 2 manhattans. \u00a0Both manhattans were made with makers mark- and the ratio to vermouth, bitters, and whiskey were different in both. \u00a0My fianc\u00e9 actually has another one later in the night, which was still different. \u00a0Not bad- but for $15 a drink I would expect a much higher quality cocktail.The pork belly was the best thing we had all night. \u00a0It was very tender, served as a whole pork belly steak, and toped with fried green onions and a delicious sweet chutney. \u00a0I would recommend this appetizer- even though it took a very long time to come out. \u00a0We were told that they were getting a used to making it since it's a brand new item on their fall menu.We both ordered the filet medium rare. \u00a0My fianc\u00e9s was perfect. \u00a0Mine was blue. \u00a0Nothing but a seer. \u00a0The woman who dropped off the steaks didn't stay at the table to check if they were cooked properly- so I had to wait for our server to check on is before I could send it back. \u00a0It then came back a solid medium- with very little seasoning. \u00a0There was a tremendous difference in taste between the two should-be-identical steaks. They did offer to cook me a new one when the manager came by, but by this time my steak partner in crime had completely completed his meal and I was famished.Since the $47 steaks do not come with sides (which we anticipated at a higher end steak house), we ordered a side of brussels sprouts. \u00a0I am notorious about ordering brussels sprouts and getting undercooked ones. \u00a0I actually joked about it when we ordered and asked my sprout addicted man if he was sure that was a good choice. \u00a0They arrived at the table and guess what.... Under cooked. \u00a0Edible- but still under. \u00a0The bacon in the sprouts was cubed and smoked. \u00a0Good caramelization, but the smoke overpowered any other flavors.As part of the apology for the steaks- we were given a complimentary dessert. \u00a0Flour less chocolate espresso cake. \u00a0It was good. \u00a0Not the best flour less cake I have ever had, but a solid 7/10. Our bill, after our $100 off, was $80. \u00a0That's $180 for an app, 3 manhattans, 2 filets (no add ons to the steaks) and Brussels sprouts. \u00a0Way overpriced for the quality of the dishes that we received. We will not be revisiting at this time, as there are many other places in the city where you can get quite a great steak meal for the same price."], ["Jason W.", "From the moment that you walk in you know that you're somewhere upscale. If you have a problem paying over $15 for hamburger or paying for similar upscale prices don't even bother walking in the door. But if you enjoy good food and good service this is the place to be. The service and the food were impeccable. The atmosphere was first class all the way. Everything downtown is walking distance and the Capital Grille is in the center of downtown Indianapolis. I had a burger with an egg on it, fries, and clam chowder. They have truffle fries but I got the regular fries. The clam chowder was ok... just ok... but the burger was wonderful."], ["S J P.", "Some good, some bad, but nothing ugly. Went for dinner on a Saturday evening with 7:30 reservation. Seated promptly, polite staff so far. Water appeared with menus. At least 15 minutes passed before our server H. arrived with over-the-top apologies. Ok, a little goes a long way. So she proceeded to recite the evening's specials, in way-too-much detail, i.e. how the beef was raised, where the lobster was caught, the chef's favorite color, etc. Finally, we placed our wine/cocktail order and the drinks arrived quickly. H. reappeared with more information about the menu and we finally had to interrupt to tell her we were ready to order.The butternut squash bisque was so cold, my bride thought perhaps it was intended to be a cold soup; not so. But my clam chowder was almost at the boiling point. Anyhow the bisque was sent back and quickly replaced with a piping hot version. Five minutes later, the man across the way sent back his bisque for the same reason.Our seared salmon, with al dente green beans and chestnuts was superb, melt-in-your-mouth with a nice crusty edge and citrus glaze. Of course the lobster mac-n-cheese was incomparable. But the disappointment of the eveing was the creamed spinach - should have been named \"creamed garlic with a hint of spinach\" - wow, I like a little garlic, but this was overpowering - took two bites and that was it.Our server stopped by several times, each time her voice was louder and louder, mostly due to the increasing noise level in the room - she was shouting at us, and we had difficulty hearing ourselves as well. \u00a0We were seated away from the bar, but the rowdiness of the crowd could not be diminished. The cheesecake was so-so, and the flourless chocolate cake just average. The next morning, we returned for breakfast, which again was a mixed bag. Amazing server, promt, courteous, efficient. Delicious coffee, breakfast tea. The cheese omelette was fluffy but had an abundance of oil or butter. The cheese/mushroom omelette was a disappointment - it was more like cheese and mushrooms with a little egg. \u00a0And garlic mushrooms, for breakfast? Swimming in oil? The bright side was the wheat toast (wrapped in linen) and whipped butter. The Lyonnaise potatoes were crisp - her portion was onion-less, mine were heaped. Oh well.So dinner and breakfast made my Amex card groan. We'll give it another shot, maybe."], ["Chris P.", "Service was fast, friendly and professional. Rick was the best! The food was spectacular from start to finish. We enjoyed the lobster crab cakes and lobster bisque soup. The bread was amazing as well. Our entrees were to die for; we had the filet with mushrooms and onions and the tenderloin with lobster tails! We enjoyed the bohemian and mojito for drinks and tried the cream br\u00fbl\u00e9e with fresh fruit. This was by far the best meal and dining experience we have ever had in Indy and perhaps the USA. We highly recommend the Capital Grill without reservation!"], ["Aldwin C.", "Always a great place for steak. I usually get one of their aged steaksThey have a 'generous pour' promotion which has 9 wines to taste - 4 whites and 5 reds. I focused on the reds. Their description is spot on. It makes you appreciate wines moreStaff are friendly and helpful. Although for me it is odd for them to hand me their business cards. I've been at many locations including Chicago, Lombard, Rosemont and Kansas City. And I've never had the need to call ahead to make sure that Bob or Jane is working at my table"], ["Sam C.", "We had a lovely experience here last week. The Hemingway Daquiri was delicious. We also started with the shrimp cocktail and the lobster bisque. For the main course, we both ordered the sea bass, which was amazing. I would also recommend the roasted brusell sprouts as a side. Definitely a wonderful dining experience!"], ["Christin J.", "Here's what I love: lunchtime at Capital Grill. Yes, my lunch salad is $20. But the salmon! Avocado perfectly paired with mango and tomatoes! Delish! Service is good, but unless you're seated at a booth it can feel a little noisy and overwhelming at dinner (especially when you get stuck next to a table full of businessmen on the company dime). Steaks are good, comparable to other steakhouses downtown. Not a huge fan of the potatoes but love the asparagus. All-in-all, I'm always a fan of non-steak options and Capital Grille really hits its stride for me midday. I also heard mumblings about breakfast so I plan to update this review soon!"], ["Jason A.", "So I set up reservations for 8:30 after striking out on a few other joints, let them know it's a 10 yr anniversary dinner we get there at 8:15, head to the bar to wait. I've been fasting for 24 hrs now, so after 2 drinks I'm pretty buzzed, by 9 pm no table I go to the hostess, it's obvious from her reaction she's forgotten. Nice. They get on the stick and hustle up a booth for us, the hostess asks \"How were your drinks?\" (?)So we get to the booth, rose petals, Happy Anniversary card on the table, nice touch, we order soup so we can get something in the stomach for now. I get the French onion, she gets the clam chowder, both are good, French onion better. Salads follow, I get the wedge, lots of bacon, bleu cheese, can't really mess that up, main dish I get the Delmonico 22 oz, wife gets the lamb, sides are asparagus, lobster mac n cheese.Steak is cooked perfectly all the way through, not a wasted bite, butterknife smooth, very little fat, outstanding. Wife's lamb chops are moist, nice char, a raspberry chutney spread along with it compliments nicely. \u00a0Asparagus is forgettable lobster mac n cheese is delicious but has 2 huge pieces of lobster meat instead of being dispersed evenly throughout the dish. I nitpick.End of the night we get complimentary dessert, flourless choc cake, and cheesecake with cr\u00e8me brulee style topping. Both are excellent. Two glasses of champagne to cap off the night.What started off clunky finished up extremely smooth, service impeccable our waiter Scott had just the right touch and knew when to pop in and out timing each dish perfectly. They are slightly pushy on getting you to buy a bottle but other than that very few flaws. Dumped slightly over $250 with tip, this was my second trip to Capital Grille overall no regrets."], ["James L.", "You can't complain about the service here. \u00a0It's classy, fundamental, and matches the traditional charm of the food to the tee. \u00a0My waitress was Courtney, a very polite and just-attentive-enough slender black-haired Caucasian lady. \u00a0Compliments to her, she was most nice and helpful. \u00a0Her recommendations did not fail to amaze. \u00a0Maybe it was just a good day for her, but if that was it, then I believe she was having an amazing day.I ordered a Rioja Tempranillo that did not disappoint, and they even poured me more.I ordered the salmon salad, followed by the bone-in ribeye.The bread that came included a plain flatbread and two poppyseed buns, warmed. I understand the latter choice, but not the first: it was so dry and plain.Their homemade grapefruit soda is good.The salmon salad is generous. A large well seared salmon and a side of avocado, mango, cherry tomatoes, lettuce, and a light champagne vinaigrette.The bone-in ribeye is well-cooked. I ordered medium, and it was evenly cooked. \u00a0The dry-aged meat is dry on the first outside half-inch though, so the shallot cream sauce is a very necessary pairing. \u00a0The meat becomes juicier and much more independently enjoyable as you cut in. I ordered creamed corn and spinach that also paired excellently with the meat and cream sauce.The dessert I asked for the flourless chocolate cake for some bitterness, paired with vanilla ice cream and mixed berries for an acidic and sweet finish. \u00a0An excellent meal."], ["Josie A.", "Everything was great until dessert. I went with friends during Devour Downtown and I understand that everything is pretty much mass-produced in order to accomodate the crowds. But how about you pick a dessert that you're able to produce vast quantities of while maintaining the integrity? The creme brulee was RUNNY (I'm not sure how many creme brulee fans there are out there but it should neverrr be runny). And the waitress just said sorry it's cause we're so busy. I don't see why that's an excuse, but I guess it is to them"], ["Rod R.", "The C.G. is exemplary. \u00a0Food, service, ambiance, restrooms ( my favorite) everything. Their crab/lobster cakes are beyond superb. \u00a0We often split the cakes, a steak, a side, and a dessert. \u00a0All outstanding. \u00a0You may drop some bucks, but the experience is well worth it. \u00a0A couple drinks, dinner as described may total $150. \u00a0Don't worry about it. \u00a0Or, just go to Bucco de Puko and enjoy wads of bland pasta with lots of noisy fatties."], ["Greg M.", "Enjoying The New Spring Menu Today.Calamari to get started.

Thanks Again CG."], ["Steph G.", "This is the restaurant that is attached to the Conrad. The CapitalGrille is known in almost every major city and like usual doesn't tend to disappoint.I try to stay away from big chains when in a new city but this is a good option if you want something reliable and staying nearby.I still believe they are overpriced but it's the Capitol Grill- you know what to expect."], ["Brandon M.", "Great food can't say that enough gonna spend some money but the quality of everything was amazing. Service was on top of it also never an empty glass and it was fairly full. Stop in here for a very delicious meal"], ["Kasey L.", "It feels a little sacrilegious to give the Capital Grille a 3 (maybe a 3.5?), but my expectations are high. I've been to this particular location three times, but I'm familiar with it from other cities as well.If you're considering the Capital Grille, you already know what kind of food to expect. It is a chain after all, albeit a fancy one! The steaks are just phenomenal--probably the best steak meal of my life was at the Capital Grille. I've enjoyed the kona-crusted filet in the past and would definitely get it again. The sides (fries, potatoes, green beans) are all pretty tasty and serve at least two people. The French onion soup is a little thin (and overpriced) for my liking, but that's OK. On my very first visit here, they were trying out a new mushroom soup and brought each of us a free cup to try--yum! And, Capital Grille was the first place I ever had creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, and I keep coming back for more, so that should tell you something! Today, we unfortunately had some inconsistencies with our food--my steak was a little on the dry side with some burnt edges, and the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, while creamy in taste, was kind of chunky in texture. The Indianapolis location, though, really leaves something to be desired in the service department. On one occasion (dinner), we felt so incredibly rushed. The server actually took my plate before I was done, and it was already in her hand before she bothered to ask if I was finished. The guy refilling our water glasses did this weird/dramatic routine every time he visited the table. Today, when I asked the waitress to repeat one of the specials (because I couldn't remember it), she talked down to me and explained all the ingredients as if I didn't know what they were. I have now gotten the impression multiple times that I might not be worthy of good service because I am either young or pass on wine/cocktails, but hey, I can't change the year I was born or the fact that I really just don't care for alcohol. They serve Coke products in little bottles, but they practically fall over themselves to pour them into your glass of ice...which leads to a watered down drink that you feel compelled to chug. I think the Indy Capital Grille may be resting on its laurels at this point. The food is usually fantastic, but you can now get fantastic food (including great steak) as well as impeccable service at many restaurants in this city. It is worth visiting, perhaps during Devour Downtown (though beware potentially bad service), but I probably would skip it at full price. Overall, this is kind of a harsh review, but for the prices and reputation, I have the highest expectations."], ["Lizzie B.", "Every cent spent is absolutely worth it! We ordered the calamari for an appetizer, it was a fairly large portion for two people and appropriate with the price. I ordered the special for the night, it was a South African lobster tail, it melted in my mouth. I have never had a better lobster. My husband ordered the aged New York strip with the most amazing sauce. I've said amazing once, but it's the best word to describe the food. For a side we ordered the mashed potatoes, which were perfectly creamy. To top off the beautiful evening, we ordered crem\u00e8 br\u00fbl\u00e9e, which was the best my husband has had he is a big fan of crem\u00e8 br\u00fbl\u00e9e! To accompany our meal we had a reasonably priced Cabernet Sauvignon, which paired delightfully with our dining experience. Our waiter was the perfect amount of entertaining as well as knowledgable. He did not hover to much, but made us feel comfortable and helped us enjoy our dining experience. The ambience is a low lit, formal dining. Defiantly worth a splurge for a special occasion or in our case, a gift card!"], ["Cindy C.", "Have never had a bad meal here. Totally on par with Ruth's Chris or Mortons. The atmosphere is upscale steakhouse chic, as is the impeccable service. Food is perfect every time. I especially enjoy the Kona Crusted Sirloin and brussel sprouts side dish. No hint of being in a chain restaurant here."], ["Randy C.", "Very very good service. They give you your privacy but are also very attentive to when you need something. Water is always filled if you drink at least 1/4th of it. Always new plates & forks. Classy, upscale, totally worth it for the price. And this is coming from a graduate student with tons of loans. This was definitely worth it, experience, food, & everything. My 1st experience here & glad I gave it a try. Meiomi Pinot Noir 2013 vintage was totally worth it for the price.

SO incredibly tasty. We went for Valentine's Day/ my birthday. We were treated like a King and Queen.

Everyone should try The Capital Grille at least once whether they live or are visiting Indianapolis."], ["Kendall M.", "I love the Capital Grille. If I could go there every week, I definitely would. The only downside is that I'm a college student with a small weekly budget. I have dined at the Capital Grille twice. The first time with my boyfriend and some of his family members and the second time with my family and my boyfriend. The atmosphere is friendly, but classy and refined. It's location just off of the beautiful lobby of the Conrad Indianapolis, is on point! It's right across from Circle Center Mall and the Indianapolis Arts Garden in the heart of downtown. In my opinion, the food is to die for. Bread baskets contain a huge variety and are replenished whenever you desire (even as a take home item). I ordered a filet, which was awesome. I also ordered a fabulous spinach salad with a warm bacon dressing and a sharable side of lobster mac and cheese. The lobster mac and cheese is my favorite thing on the menu, the consistency and flavor are absolutely perfect. When I first got my steak, it was a little too rare for my liking. The staff happily took it back and cooked it more. Two of my sisters and my mother's steaks were also a little too rare and were graciously cooked more as well. We were shocked at the staff's response to their error. Not only were we provided with an additional order of lobster mac and cheese, but each steak that had to be returned was removed from our bill. As you can imagine, that reduced the total significantly. We insisted that we didn't expect to be comped for anything, but the manager and our waitress continuously reassured us that perfection is their policy and that they won't settle for anything less. I would highly recommend the Capital Grille to anyone. The atmosphere, staff, and food are all top-notch."], ["Zachary R.", "Indianapolis knows its steak. \u00a0Heck, it's the main thing Indianapolis is known for. \u00a0And this was one of the most mediocre steak house dinners I've had in a long time -- and much worse than any of the other steak houses I've been to in Indy. \u00a0Service was \"fine\", but rushed and inattentive -- with one big exception, below, where they shined. \u00a0The drinks were also \"fine\" but watered down and used mediocre quality hard alcohol, despite being quite pricy. \u00a0At $11 a cocktail at a steakhouse, I expect better quality alcohol and less watered down, and some creativity in your cocktail program. \u00a0Atmosphere was a bit too much \"bar\" and not enough \"high end restaurant\" for me. \u00a0Appetizers: Crab cakes were very solid; lots of good quality crab meat. \u00a0The bacon / prosciutto wrapped cheese was not good -- the cheese was dried out and had the wrong texture. \u00a0We didn't finish our order; the wait staff didn't seem to notice. \u00a0The lobster mac & cheese didn't use enough lobster, by a large margin, and was watery, and needed a textural element, like bread crumbs or something. \u00a0The grilled asparagus side was wilted / tasted out of season.The steak: I sent back my first steak. \u00a0I ordered it medium-rare, as I order all steaks. \u00a0I cut into it as the waitress was dropping off the other steaks, it was cooked completely through. \u00a0After the waitress placed the other steaks, I asked her to look at it, and asked \"is this how your restaurant cooks medium-rare?\" \u00a0She, to her credit, said \"oh, I'm sorry -- that's cooked medium-well; I assume you want me to take that back\", and did so. \u00a0They bought a new steak out extremely quickly -- clearly took one to me that was on the grill for someone else. \u00a0Sure, they handled it really well, but they're a steakhouse, serving a $45 piece of cow. \u00a0Cooking it correctly is THEIR MAIN JOB. \u00a0What would have happened if I was too embarrassed in a work dinner to speak up? \u00a0Poking at a, to me, inedible piece of ruined meat? \u00a0I ordered a steak with a pepper butter cream sauce on top, or something like that (I forget what they called it -- it was a \"chef's suggestion\"), and the sauce was solid, but the pepper was way too assertive and in way big of chunks -- and it wasn't crusted, it was in the sauce. \u00a0To their credit, the quality of the meat in the second steak was impeccable. \u00a0Overall, I struggled with what my rating should be -- my second steak was good. \u00a0The crab cakes were great. \u00a0But simply too many mistakes were made, and there was too much mediocrity, and the price point was too high, and the competition for a steakhouse in Indy is too high, to score them above a two star. \u00a0I'll point out there are five steak houses in downtown Indy. \u00a0And I recommend Harry & Izzy's or their original / sister restaurant St. Elmo's, myself."], ["Eugene K.", "We came here while we were on a short road trip from Chicago and the dinner menu really hit the spot. \u00a0The restaurant had a nice ambiance with excellent service. \u00a0The staff was knowledgeable and courteous. \u00a0The entrees were absolutely terrific. \u00a0We had the lobster/tenderloin and salmon, they were both grilled to perfection. \u00a0It was a very pleasant dining experience and would do it again."], ["C.

They are owned by the same Darden's chain so they transfer. I was apprehensive about going due to some of the reviewers listing snobby service when they asked for the Devour menu, but we did not receive any apprehension.We made reservations for 6pm and were promptly seated. The server gave us a devour menu without us asking and explained that it was a much better deal and she highly recommended it. I ordered a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon and my wife ordered the Chateau St. Michelle Merlot, which our server, Andrea Little, recommended, and I would highly recommend it. The devour menu lets you choose a Caesar salad or cup of clam chowder as an appetizer, entr\u00e9e, and dessert of chocolate espresso cake or cheesecake. \u00a0Neither of the appetizers were life changing the soup was a little watery for my liking but appreciated the chunks of clams. The salad was a salad.... Nothing really stuck out. For our main course I upgraded to the Bone- in Kona crusted dry aged sirloin and my wife ordered the Filet Mignon with jumbo shrimp. The waitress was extremely helpful and explained the dry age process and how they butchered and did the dry aging in house. I ordered my steak medium rare. The cut of the meat was not consistent so the end without the bone was well done while the section next to the bone was medium rare. The waitress noticed the mistake and kept apologizing and offering to make another, but I did not want to wait and the rest was cooked perfectly except for maybe 4 bites. My wife's filet was cooked perfect and cut effortlessly. The shrimp which were add... nothing special just frozen jumbo shrimp thrown on an open fire for a few minutes. The desserts were worth the meal alone. I am a perfectionist when it comes to cheesecakes. I despise over commercialized places that even include it in their name... it's not even that good. The Capital Grill makes little individual rounded cheesecakes. The top is caramelized sugar with berry compote and mixed berries. The cheesecake had a little more lemon which gave a great extra tart element. The chocolate espresso cake was decadent as well. I wish I would have ordered a gallon of milk to wash down the dessert because it was extremely rich, but still full of flavor. The service was impeccable and even though my steak was cooked improperly she did not charge me for the upcharge and the rest of the evening went off without a hitch. Thank you Andrea Little for great service. I would recommend this and will go back in the future just maybe wait for Devour pricing."], ["Hunter U.", "Somehow I've managed to not eat here for the last several years despite it being recommended to me numerous times. I must say that all the rumors were true and Capital Grille was impressive both in taste and service. We went for lunch and our server was always attentive as available despite being very busy. I had the steak frites for lunch and my friend had the scallops with corn risotto. The steak was well cut and cooked; overall very impressive for a flank steak and the cheap price. The scallops were even better and were huge. I would also highly recommend the grapefruit soda or mint lemonade. I had looked over the dinner menu and was impressed by the options. I will definitely be going back!"], ["Tim L.", "What an excellent dining experience. Period.

My favorites so far are the Smoked Salmon Bagel, the Lobster Eggs Benedict, the Filet (of course!), and the Cheese Cake. I am not a Whisky Drinker, but the bartenders have been great with great salesmanship to try new things so I have drank quite a bit here too."], ["Scot C.", "Came here for Devour to get a taste of what I had been missing out on Washington. \u00a0The ambiance here is what you would expect from the facade: classy, semi-formal, and a face full of opulence. \u00a0Glad I wore a tie, laughed at the guy with a Peyton jersey on. \u00a0Meatball.Our server was extremely nice and professional - until we requested the unsolicited Devour Downtown menu. \u00a0Then things got a bit icy... \u00a0It was a Saturday night, so perhaps this was partially understandable when she realized her tip-potential just got slashed, though I still don't like being treated as a second-class citizen for wanting a product that your restaurant is advertising. \u00a0That's the whole point of Devour - to get people at your tables. \u00a0Hospitality appreciated.My main entree was the Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry-Aged Sirloin with shallot butter; it was awesome. \u00a0The 'Kona' crust has a kick to it, it's of flame-broiled flavor and texture - while cutting into a very juicy medium-rare center section. \u00a0Great sized cut, too.Strawberries Capital Grille for dessert, and just the appropriate portion, given I demolished the entire Kona sirloin. \u00a0Next time, I'm opting for either the coconut cream cake or the flourless double chocolate espresso cake...oh yeah. \u00a0 Overall a great experience, aside from the cold service. \u00a0Wouldn't mind coming back here for a special occasion."], ["Mary Kate G.", "The husband and I decided that the Devour Downtown menu looked great so we decided to come here for the first time for a date night. First, I have to give a shout out to our awesome server, Andrea Little! She was attentive without hovering, and knew the (somewhat daunting) wine list like the back of her hand. She made excellent suggestions that pointed me toward a merlot I absolutely never would have considered (Chateau Ste. Michele - Washington State). She was also very helpful in articulately explaining some of the in-house processes regarding their desserts and dry aging their meat. If I could give her five stars, I would.The atmosphere was comfortable and lively. I am sure you got the full range of people out because of the Devour specials, personally we were looking for an excuse to dress up. The layout of the restaurant cut down on all the chatter and background noise making normal conversation pleasant, and it was clear that all of the staff were well versed in dining hospitality.Food wise, we were pleasantly surprised with some things and 'meh' on others. Upgrading to the $10 bonus selection on the Devour menu, I got the clam chowder, filet with grilled jumbo shrimp, and flourless espresso cake. Overall, I don't believe that the $10 upgrade was worth it. The filet was positively spectacular at medium rare, but the jumbo shrimp were a little tough and had no real flavor impact to the meal. The chowder would fall into the 'meh' category, while the flavors were there it was just a touch watery. The sides of green beans and mashed potatoes were perfect complements. The espresso cake was wonderful, but very rich. I got through about half of it before I had to trade desserts with my husband (who got the cheesecake) and he loved it too.My suggestions: Stick with just the filet, and splurge on the wine! And you can't go wrong with dessert."], ["Cherry J.", "This is another place that we have been going back frequently on special occasions. Their food never fails and has always been good. Classy place. Haven't been back there yet cause we've been trying different places now. Definitely will go back here. Good choices on their menu and for wine drinkers but I'm a beer person."], ["Roberta R.", "I can't believe I'm saying this, but the customer service today is sub par. We had to ask for silverware and app plates. Bread that was offered never came. I'm sitting here with an empty cocktail glass and have been for a few minutes. This is far different from past visits when the service outperformed the food. Now both are not worthy of a repeat visit. The calamari is tasty, but a huge pile of deep fried commonplace fare. We'll be asking for the bill and getting dinner elsewhere."], ["Maya H.", "I was EXTREMELY impressed. My boyfriend and I went for my 21st birthday last night, and they even left a little card at the table wishing me a happy birthday!I had some oysters, whih were great. They are a little expensive for oysters, even more than at the Oceanaire, but they are good. They worked with my spice allergy, and I was informed that everything is house made, so the steaks are house seasoned and they made a special blend just for me with no black pepper. I actually got the most expensive thing on the menu, the filet and butter lobster, and it was completely delicious. It looked small, but totally filled me up. I almost got potatoes with it but I dont think I could have even eaten them if I had. I tried the flourless espresso cake, and the fruit cheesecake. they were heaven in my mouth, I am craving more right now writing this and thinking about it. My boyfriend ordered the lobster mac and cheese, which was only 15 dollars and a HUGE portion which was very filling, even for him and he looooves food. It was great. if you are worried about the prices here, I really suggest the lobster mac and cheese, 15 dollars is a very reasonable price and it was delish. He also ordered the hazelnut chocolate cake. It was the biggest slice of cake I have ever seen, and he wolfed it down in like a minute. On top of the great food, the service was incredible. The staff were extremely friendly and talkative, which is something I really value in a restaurant experience. They were very knowledgeable about the menu as well. Overall this might be my new favourite restaurant in Indianapolis! I will say that there was a very small amount of people, so the experience might be a little different for you if you go on a crowded night?"], ["The Most Interesting Man In The W.", "Even though Red Lobster is owned by the same company and isn't as expensive, Red Lobster is leagues better. For some reason the food we got here was cold. The steak slider tasted like it was already made and simply reheated. The Chilean sea bass was undercooked and after eating it I couldn't get rid of the taste and texture from my throat. The presentation was boring and the flavors did not go together at all. I lost my appetite for the rest of the day. We complained because it was Valentine's Day and they took care of it for us. We will be going to Red Lobster from now on."], ["Gelone B.", "Dined with a group after work on a busy Friday night during Devour Downtown and the service was still top notch! The attention to small details were very impressive. \u00a0The food from the appetizer to dessert was soo delicious. The Capitol Grille never disappoints."], ["Anna L.", "Just went here for the Devour Downtown lunch special on Friday. It's been awhile since I've been to a fancier restaurant, but I went in with a nice blouse and casual shorts since it was blazing hot outside. So don't worry if you're dressed down, they don't care what you wear - as long as you don't look like a slob. My boyfriend had black dress pants on, and they asked if he wanted a black vs. white napkin to match his pants. That's the first time I've heard of colored napkin options.Before our starter, they brought out a basket of 2 fresh mini baguette rolls and a large sesame cracker with a triangle of butter. I didn't really care for it since the rolls were a little chewy and the sesame cracker was tasteless like a saltine cracker. As a starter, he had the seasonal soup (wonderful clam chowder w/ oyster crackers) and I had the field greens, seasonal vegetables with shallot champagne vinaigrette. The salad was fresh, but it was the dressing that made it unique. If I had to choose between the 2 starters, I'd go for the clam chowder. For entree, we both had the dry aged sirloin with arugula salad. The sirloin was cooked to medium perfection and sliced into wide meaty strips. It was a lovely pairing with the vinaigrette from the arugula salad. The only thing that needs improvement is the plating. His salad only had greens and I had plenty of mozzarella, roasted peppers, and shallots. I assume I got the bottom half of the mix where all the good stuff sinks down to.We finished with the flourless chocolate espresso cake. It was a very generous slice garnished with sour raspberries and a dollop of whip cream topped with a mint leaf on the side. Good thing the raspberries were there when I needed something to clear the chocolaty goodness. I'm whimpy when it comes to too much chocolate, but it's definitely an excellent choice for the chocoholics out there! In the end, I was so full that I had to get the rest of it boxed up. I should have eaten the mint leaf to rid of the shallot breath. Great service and food. Consider taking your date here for a romantic lunch or dinner."], ["Simon M.", "This is a great place for that special meal. It has that old world ambiance with lots of dark wood and also has seating for that romantic evening. Sort of that New York City feel.I am vegetarian, and the menu was not kind to me, however, the chef was.He prepared a fantastic pasta dish with vegetables and a red sauce. I could have had Alfredo if I wished. In addition, I had a wonderful house chopped salad. My wife had the breast of chicken confit and loved it. The bread selection is varied, with enough butter (unlike some other places.) They advertise 30 bottles of wine under $30 and our $29 selection was very good. Of course, they have a wide selection of higher priced wines.The service was impeccable and you would not have known that Michael had other customers to serve. Price wise, you can spend a lot or a moderate amount. Our meal was $87 before tax and tip. Good price for a fine time. We will return."], ["Stephanie G.", "Capital Grille's deal during Devour Downtown cannot be beat - $35 / person including several entree options from their regular menu, sides, a salad / soup, and dessert . . . when their normal filet is $42.

I ordered the filet oscar this time with the lump crab meat on top. I wish I would have just ordered the regular filet. The crab was good but it overpowered the filet (see photo). I also wonder if that was why the filet seemed to have less taste even when I pushed the crab aside. The lobster Mac never disappoints and that's a must order item. Love the tomato mozzarella salad with aged balsamic...yummy.

The service here is excellent and they really make everyone feel special. This has become our go to spot for birthdays and anniversaries.

When a dinner for 4 people is over $300 I expect perfection and our experience was far from it. \u00a0We were staying next door at the Conrad so getting there was easy. \u00a0We had made reservations and stated that we were celebrating a big birthday. \u00a0Things started out well--we were seated/greeted promptly but everything went downhill once the food started coming. We were a party of 4 and only one entree came out right, 2 of the 3 were sent back. Of course when items are sent back it impacts the entire meal/experience because people are no longer \"eating\" together. \u00a0The person without their food feels awkward watching others eat and those that have their food feel awkward eating in front of those that don't!My mom ordered her Salmon plain and very well done (some would call it Salmon Jerky but whatever...that is how she likes it) and she was specific in her instructions on how she wanted it cooked. \u00a0She was served a piece of seasoned fish that was glossy because it was significantly under cooked. \u00a0My dad ordered Filet Oscar but asked for a 10oz \u00a0filet rather than the typical 6-7oz filet that is standard with that dish. \u00a0They got it wrong and they brought out the smaller sized filet. \u00a0I ordered my filet medium rare and what I got was medium. We ordered 3 sides but only two were delivered and we had to ask about the third one. \u00a0I just decided to deal with my over cooked steak but the Salmon and Filet Oscar went back to the kitchen for a do-over. \u00a0So now my parents sat and watched us eat while they waited for their dishes to come out right. Grrrr.... \u00a0Of course, we finished before they did, so then we got sit and watch them eat. \u00a0Grrr...Alright, I get that sometimes things can go wrong but when nearly EVERYTHING goes wrong they should do something to make it right. \u00a0They did nothing but bring out 10 new asparagus that were hot since the ones on the table got cold while waiting--big whoop! Seriously!? You are a high end establishment with high end pricing, you know it's a special occasion and THREE out of Four main courses are screwed up and the best you can do is have the manager bring out 10 hot asparagus! \u00a0Wow! ok, we're done here."], ["Amit K.", "Okay.

Forget any stereotype linked to the bar - the grease drenched burger and soggy fries with a beer to wash it down. At the elegant Capital Grille, this \"bar\" fare is a gourmet burger made from Wagyu steak with a side of parmesan truffle fries. It sounds weird to pair it with wine, but you can't eat a gourmet burger with a Bud. Defeats the whole purpose.I took a bite of my medium rare burger with an over-easy egg topped with onion straws and it has this rich flavor and smooth texture. It's definitely a burger where ketchup is considered a crime in masking its beefy taste. If you take a whiff of the fries, they sure were generous on the truffle oil. The earthy flavors blend wonderfully with the suggested Belle Glos pinot noir.

I'm Asian - you're not gonna find me at PF unless I am desperate.The waitress mislead me on the size for a crock of French Onion soup. This was MUCH larger than I expected and there was no way I could finish it. This could definitely feed 2 people. The soup was delicious with the melted cheese - quite possibly my favorite part of the soup especially with the soup-soaked bread pieces.I ordered the cedar plank salmon with tomato fennel salsa. The salmon was cooked to be moist but I honestly didn't taste the difference with the cedar wood. Also, there really wasn't much of the tomato fennel salad as I would've liked since I like having something with each bite of fish.Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. I wasn't completely wowed and for the whopping $60 I paid including tip, this just didn't seem worth it. Perhaps I should've gotten a steak but I'm not much of a steak person.

So it's all very fancy and high-class. Our evening started with an open bar and little appetizers -- smoked salmon on toast points, stacked caprese bruchetta, seared ahi tuna on cucumbers. All delicious. Our dinner menu involved bread service, our choice of two salads, four entrees, family-style sides and a pre-selected dessert. I started with the spring greens, a perfectly dressed melange of lettuce and herbs. For an entree I had Kona-crusted filet mignon with shallot butter. HOLY DELICIOUS. I don't eat a lot of steak but this was a perfect medium, so tender and flavorful. Our sides were truffle fries (yum), sauteed haricot verts (yum) and .... lobster mac 'n' cheese. Which is every bit as decadent as it sounds. Excuse me, I'm drooling again.Dessert was a trio of peach, chocolate and vanilla ice cream served with our choice of warm chocolate and/or caramel sauce.

But if you like fine cuts and aged meats with a sauce or style that highlights the steak then this place is for you! I loved my steak and my husbands. I had the Kona crusted one, it was good, toasty and rich tasting. My husband had the Porcini rub with the balsamic sauce. It was one of the most mouth watering meals I have ever tasted.

The waiters were extremely attentive and friendly. The food was also good. For appetizers, my boyfriend and I shared the oysters on the half shell. They were pretty fresh for Indiana standards, but it didn't beat any oyster place on the East or West coast. For entrees, I got the Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin. It was really good and cooked almost perfectly (medium-rare). We shared the parmesan truffle fries, which I definitely recommend. However, I got some serious food poisoning the next day, which probably came from the oysters or the steak.

He even made it a point to recognize the VIP in my party by name. \u00a0I ordered the scallops off of the plates menu and they were perfect. \u00a0I will definitely bring my clients back and from looking at the other reviews it looks like I am missing out on the lobster mac and cheese."], ["N S.", "Oh my this meal was simply perfect! Our party of 4 adults and 1 child started with three orders of shrimp cocktail and a fantastically smoked salmon plate served with cream cheese, capers and diced onions. The salmon was very high quality and out of this world flavorful. The shrimp were plump and fresh served over a bed of crushed ice and I really like that it arrives with horseradish on the side so you can keep it mild or really turn the heat up. Somewhere along the way I ordered a glass (or two) of the 2012 Catena Malbec which paired very well with my perfectly cooked dry aged steak au poivre. I thoroughly enjoyed my steak au poivre, but I will say that if you are thinking to order it be advised that it is HEAVILY crusted in peppercorns and was just a tad shy of the amount I would have liked of the lovely cognac cream. The other adults in our party of 5 all raved about their choice of filet Oscar which was being served with Alaskan King crab instead of the traditional blue crab. My 7 year old also thoroughly enjoyed his kid size filet mignon - Capital Grille is child friendly fine dining at its best! Now for the sides - OMG I think I I need a moment alone..yes they were THAT good. Brussels Sprouts in browned butter and bacon, perfectly grilled asparagus in lemony butter, creamy oh so creamy \u00a0mashed and seasoned \"Sam's\" \u00a0skin on mashed potatoes and creamed spinach sporting the perfect amount of nutmeg.

We were the only ones in the place, which is a bit disconcerting, but it quickly got busier. Thank goodness for the valet parking connected to the Conrad because that made it a lot easier bringing a client. We were taken to our table and quickly greeted by our server. She was very friendly and was able to make recommendations to my coworker when he couldn't decide what to order. I ordered the tomato, mozzarella, and basil salad and it was filling and tasted light and fresh. My coworker and client both ordered salads and the lobster bisque, both of which they enjoyed. This place is perfect for a business lunch and walking through the lobby of the Conrad is an added bonus to pay for your valet at the front desk."]], "Bangkok Restaurant & Jazz Bar": [["Jake D.", "So with complete transparency: yes, i'm rating 5 stars. Yes, i've only ever ordered the Massaman curry. That dish is SO good. It's hard for me to branch out here when I know something like that is readily available.

I've never had the lunch buffet, but after reading reviews here, I think I need too. The environment is romantic and unique - light jazz music will play in the background, or you'll be treated to a live musician on weekends.I've been to another Thai restaurant near Bangkok and it just lacked the level of professional service.

There is seating by the window so you can enjoy your meal while looking outside.Four stars for the service, the waiter was pleasant. However got the level of spice wrong for one of us, hot is extremely hot! I felt she was kind of hovering around trying to rush us to make up our minds about what to get. Otherwise was quick to get our orders and serve.Food deserves four stars as well. I think it was really nice, I got the tiger sauce chicken. Serving size is really generous. My friends got the red curry and a pad thai with tofu. They appeared satisfied however when I tasted the tofu is was nothing special. I'll definitely come back for the beautiful environment and the well priced food! I want to try new things I'm sure I'll find a favorite, rest assured I will become a regular here!"], ["Kristie S.", "We live 1 block from here and just walked by one day.It is soooo lovely!!!

Also got the dumpling appetizer and papaya salad. Everything was perfect and as expected.Glad this place is downtown.

I went here with a coworker for the lunch buffet and think it was definitely right for the price - around $10. Now, the buffet is smaller than some you might be thinking of - India Garden, Shalimar, etc. but I think the offerings are good. Decent sized salad bar to start off - wish they would have had a spinach option, however. Several curry options - wish there would have been a chicken one, I only noticed beef and tofu offerings on the day I was there. Also wish there was more than one type of rice to choose from. The highlight is without a doubt the crab ran goons. I'm not proud of how many I ate - let's just say you need more than 2 hands to get that amount right. The food on the buffet seemed hot and fresh and though they were running low on several items when we first arrived (a bit later at 12:45) they did replenish everything we wanted by the end of our meal. I will say I thought the service could have been a bit better. We hardly got any offers for refills on water, which at a Thai place, I definitely need more of. A pitcher on the table would have been helpful in this instance.Overall, I don't think Bangkok is a buffet that you can absolutely gouge yourself on. I left feeling comfortably full after two plates and don't think I could have eaten a lot more. A great place to go every now and again when you're craving Thai food, but for whatever reason, I don't think this is a place I would go to very frequently.I am definitely intrigued by the \"jazz bar\" concept of the place. Anyone got that figured out?"], ["Crystal R.", "The lunch buffet was so fresh and tasty. I had a salad, chicken fried rice, a beef and eggplant dish, orange chicken, a noodle dish, crab rangoon, spring rolls, and fried bananas.

All in all, I'd say this is a great alternative to hitting the small and intimate establishments on Mass Ave for lunch or dinner, especially if you have a big group with you."], ["Laurie L.", "Jazz music at a Thai restaurant? I know, right? But the atmosphere was calming and the music made it more so. Oh yeah, and the pumpkin curry special was soooo good!

Our waiter was attentive and kept our plates clear and drinks full (which is really all you need when you have a buffet). I made several trips up to get refills.

While I'm typically not into buffet style anything, I make an exception for ethnic food because it helps me get out of my comfort zone.

It's clearly a better deal to go for the buffet. The food was great, however, I'm not so sure that $9.99 is actually that much of a \"deal\". I do think it was worth that much, but I'm not sure it was a bargain in a city full of lunch specials. The service was average. It was packed on a Friday afternoon!The buffet had some fresh fruit and salad (that I basically skipped...I was there for the noodle-y carbs and fried stuff). I had:-Veggie spring rolls: a favorite! Lots of sauce choices available for dipping, too.-Tofu Pad Thai: above average for sure-Pork Pad See Ew: the only thing I didn't particularly care for-Spicy Basil Fried Rice with Chicken: definitely spicy! But I went back for seconds ;)-Green Curry: the first time for me, and I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was since I'm typically not a big curry fan-Orange Chicken: really crunchy (yum) and not overly orange-y, just the way I like it-Fried Banana with Coconut and Honey: just as delicious as it sounds."], ["J K.", "I stopped here for a quick dinner one evening. \u00a0It looked like a nice place from the outside, and the inside was an inviting wood interior but definitely not your standard Thai decor in a good way. \u00a0The service here was excellent and the staff were very friendly and helpful. \u00a0Their thai basil with minced chicken was well prepared with a nice colourful mix of fresh vegetables, but it was a bit late and the flavours could have used a little more attention. \u00a0I definitely need to come back to try their Thai lunch buffet which I understand offers a wide array of fresh dishes and flavours. \u00a0The musical atmosphere was not Thai, but it was a pleasant mellow background."], ["Shaamora H.", "When I first heard about the concept of this new restaurant, I was definitely intrigued. I visited Bangkok and Jazz this past Saturday for lunch and was very pleased. This was an early Father's Day outing so I typically like to try a restaurant before introducing it on a special day. Again, I'm glad I took the chance. I had the Pottery Shrimp which was very good but I kept eyeballing my Mom's Volcano Chicken and my Dad's beef tiger plates. The wonton wrapper apetizer was excellent as well. You could really taste the ginger which wonderfully paired with the sweet/spicy dipping sauce.

It was worth it though."], ["Dylan E.", "This place has been on my to-do list for a long time, but I finally made it here a couple times in the past couple weeks. The most surprising thing about both visits was how empty it was. Maybe it was I came on days that were just exceptions, but this restaurant is definitely deserving of a much larger crowd that I have seen here.I came both on a Saturday night and a Monday night, and chose to sit in the bar area on both occasions which was open seating and contained both a bar and a handful of tables. I think the service in this area was taken care of by the bartender, and service was only so-so. This could definitely be improved on, but we had the same person both nights. The bar selection wasn't very great, and priced a little high, but it seems like a nice place to come get a drink if you were looking for some music and a more laid back atmosphere. Their menu had quite a few specialty mixed drinks, and it looked like they even had sake on tap. On Saturday, they had some great live jazz/funk type music, and it paired with the nicer restaurant to really give it a great ambiance. It's definitely a more upscale atmosphere than a lot of the ethnic cuisine around town, and it would make a good choice for a nicer night out. I've been to my fair share of Thai places in Indy, and I think I have the put this one on the top of my list food wise. It is easily ahead of its popular competition less than a couple miles down the road. Aside from the atmosphere just being exceptionally better, the food was also on a different level. It was much more flavorful than Thai places I have been to before, and the Pad Thai that I ordered tasted fresh and was full of ingredients. Another big plus was that if you order a dish \"hot\", it was actually spicy, which seems to be an issue with the places I have been before when the hot seems to taste the same as the mild. I think my Pad Thai was $13 and I ended up taking enough home with me for another meal. There were quite a few people who called in and got carry out orders when I was there, and this will be on my radar the next time I am looking for something to-go. It's also been brought to my attention that they have a lunch buffet, so I will need to make it in to give that a shot one of these days.This is probably a 4.5 star place for me, but I think I need to round up based on the precedent I have set with other Thai place reviews. This is my definitely new favorite Thai place in Indy."], ["Sarah C.", "All I could think of when I walked in the door was, \"wow, this place is a lot nicer than I thought it would be.\" For some reason I had envisioned this new Thai/jazz joint to be a little less formal.

I ended up having pad thai (without peanuts.) Loved it! I'm not a big spicy food fan, so this entree was the perfect choice. And luckily I have leftovers for lunch tomorrow! ;) A friend of mine let us try the apple sake -- wowee, wow, wow, wow! Delicious.

The setting:I'll call this casual sexy Thai. Low lighting, table-side candles, soft jazz playing overhead and an extensive list of sake, Thai-themed cocktails and more. I opted for the sweet apple sake which was surprisingly delicious despite my standard distaste for overly sweet bebidas.Next time:Rumor has it the lunch buffet is pretty tasty so I still need to give it a whirl.

Dinner was green curry. I ordered it medium, but it wasn't that hot to me. I'm by no means someone who likes hot food, but I would have ranked this under mild.

That's how I feel about the tiger garlic and pepper here, and how my girlfriend feels about the eggplant. It's difficult for me to break away from these, because both are so delicious. It's hard to find a place that can cook eggplant to that perfect texture such even the most ardent eggplant-haters can't resist it, and the tiger garlic is the perfect dish to increase your spice tolerance -- no matter how hot you order it, it is so delicious that you'll keep eating. That which doesn't kill you...That won't stop me from trying a few other things, though, and the papaya salad, the Thai iced tea, and the standard entrees like Pad Thai and the curry dishes are fantastic as well. You can find many of these at the daily lunch buffet, too. Yes, there is a lunch buffet. Go as often as you can. Be careful on the spice levels -- I find Bangkok to be one level higher than most Midwestern Thai restaurants I've been to.Of course, Jazz Bar is part of the name, and smooth jazz goes surprisingly well with Thai food on a Friday and Saturday night. There's no cover, so it's a great way to get a sampling of the restaurant.

The d\u00e9cor is very modern and upscale, with touches of Thailand throughout. The dim lighting and smooth Jazz, sets the mood for an intimate diner.The menu provides a nice selection and includes the traditional Thai favorites. The Tom Kha Goong was delicious. The consistency of the soup was good and the spiciness of it was just right and not overbearing. The only thing that I really wasn't a fan of was that the tails were left on the shrimp. In terms of Gluten Free options, one could order the Pad Thai; however, you would want to make sure to not have them but the Thai sauce on in as they use soy sauce. Other gluten free options include any of the curries on the menu.Wanting to try something new, I opted for the Beef Mussaman Curry (coconut milk, potatoes, pineapple, carrots, and onions), and boy I wasn't disappointed.

It is a little expensive, especially after you tack on a few drinks, but not outrageous and certainly not more than I was willing to pay for the quality of the meal and the atmosphere - just don't go into this place thinking it's a cheap Asian takeout restaurant.

I have been to Siam square, Sawasdee and this one in Indy all of which are Thai. In my opinion this is the best. Each food has very distinct taste and for the ones who favor mild levels of spices I would strongly recommend the Thai spicy basil, just ask for mild heat. The lunch buffet portion size and the side offerings are similar to the other two. However a salad is an extra and especially useful if a sudden surge of Thai spice is almost killing you :)Service - very much lacking. We were sitting on sitting where the wooden frames are ie where you have the two seater tables. The waitress served us across the wooden railing instead of coming over to our table side. The coke glasses were never refilled which is sad especially if you are serving coke in a wine glass! We were two on a business lunch and were never asked if we wanted to split the check. So basically lots of scope for improvement. Parking - well it's downtown. The cheapest are the hourly parking On the roadside for $2.5! Need I say more :)"], ["Griffin S.", "Great atmosphere with live music. \u00a0The cocktails are delicious and the food portions are huge.Thai hot didn't phase me a bit, but the flavors make up for that.

Again a 3 star place with a 4th-yelp-star-plastic-surgery..."], ["Alex W.", "Cute place! My friend and I came for a Saturday dinner and were surprised with the nice live jazz coming from the bar. It definitely set the mood & ambiance. We felt it was fah-ncy, but at a good cost. DEFINITELY try the dumplings & spring rolls for appetizers, both are good for 2-3 to share. My standard Thai fare is Pad Thai [how I judge a Thai place upon 1st visit]. WHOA. Blew my socks off. Next time I will go up a level in spiciness. If I wasn't so famished, I would've taken more home. Service is excellent, our waiter had perfect timing for meet & greet, water refills, taking our order and checking on us. He's done his homework!"], ["Tiffany B.", "The lunch buffet is pretty awesome and draws the nearby crowd of lawyers and city county building peeps. Always a great variety, with enough options for a vegetarian as well. Seems always stocked with spring rolls (my fave). After work, it's been pretty quiet the times I've gone for a cocktail and appetizer, so if you want to hear yourself think rather than fight a bumping beat, this could be the place for you."], ["Kara P.", "Went to Bangkok with a friend for dinner. The food? It's pretty fantastic. The service?Well, the service wasn't so great. There was some miscommunication with our waitress, and she ended up bringing me out salad rolls and spring rolls. I only wanted salad rolls. She brought out everyone else's entrees at that time. I waited for her to come back so I could explain the mix up, but after 10 minutes I figured maybe she didn't get my entree order (pottery noodles) and I was hungry so I figured I would just make dinner out of the two orders of Thai rolls.And then 15/20 minutes later my entree came out. By that point I had stuffed myself on the Thai rolls so I ate less than half of it. It reheated decently a few days later.So the food is great. But the service wasn't great and our waitress was pretty inattentive, even though it wasn't busy by any means. I'm willing to give them another shot since the food was so good. Maybe I'll give that $9.99 lunch buffet a go next time."], ["Ntianu S.", "Based upon Yelp reviews and my undying love for Thai food, I was stoked to visit Bangkok and Jazz. My first, and definitely not my last, visit to this establishment was not a disappointment. The restaurant itself is a quite lovely. I love the plush red carpet, wood, and Asian decor. We went around 4:30, so it was not packed. Please be warned that metered parking is available for $1.50 per hour.We were seated immediately. The waiter was really nice, attentive, and not to mention a cutie :-) They had a nice selection of wine and limited cocktail selection. I am a tea fanatic so I was excited about their hot tea selection. The menu was extensive and covers all of the basics. I ordered the lemongrass soup with shrimp as an appetizer and pad thai with shrimp for the entree. It didn't take too long for the soup to come out. The soup was not what I expected. Yes it was full of fresh veggies, herbs, and the shrimp was generous, but it was heavy, too spicy, and oily. I ate the shrimp and moved the soup to the side. Our entrees came out shortly thereafter. Nice presentation for dishes and outstanding portion size. My friend ordered the chicken fried rice and loved it. My pad thai was everything I was hoping for and then some. I don't think I made it through half of my meal before become stuffed. I am so happy about my leftovers. I DEFINITELY will visit this establishment again soon. I would live to visit when they had live jazz. Good service, delicious food, and wonderful ambience. A great addition to downtown! They had a sign for a lunch buffet a 11-3 for $9.99. I definitely want to check this out."], ["Amber E.", "The inside of this place is beautiful! I cannot believe how sophisticated it was for the price. I got the chicken curry with medium spice and it was a little too hot for me and there was very little chicken. The dumpling appetizer was amazing! Even though I wasn't fond of the chicken curry dish I would definitely go back to try something else."], ["Liz S.", "This place is bizarre.. I mean.. Thai.. and Jazz bar?THAI LUNCH BUFFET IS GENIUS. I mean, you have your Chinese, Indian, and what-have-you buffets.. but how common is a Thai Lunch Buffet.. in downtown Indianapolis? I really think they hit the jackpot there. Haven't you ever gone to a Thai restaurant and just wanted one more bite of something? But not pay an arm and a leg for the extra serving? They have tofu/veggie pad thai, soups, curries and some Chinese-inspired chicken there. I mean... for about $10, you're already covered, since that's how much you'd pay, if not more, for a small portion of Thai anyway.The service is what lacks here. They only have about 1-2 people working the floor.. during lunch hour.. in downtown Indy... that's a joke right? I know you don't have to have a lot of servers for a buffet.. but you actually do? Clean plates, refill drinks, refill the buffet, check on guests, checks, payment.. I mean there's so much more than letting people have at it! It's cramp space, so you can't just do endless no-check up on your guests.Also, the Jazz is ridiculous. Don't get me wrong, I can get down on some jazz.... but for a Thai restaurant.. I just couldn't stop laughing.. that's just me. :)"], ["Deborah B.", "There are places so great or bad, that when dining I am actually thinking-wow I cannot wait to write a review to tell about this amazing/awful experience. \u00a0In this case of Bangkok Restaurant and Jazz Bar. \u00a0It is the fact that this was such a wonderful experience. We had a long day of wondering around downtown Indy during Big10 tournament and were finally ready to pick a spot for dinner. \u00a0Many of the restaurants near our place had hour to hour and a half waits. \u00a0We remembered that Bangkok was on our list of places to try. \u00a0We walked in and the host was not there a server sat us at a comfortable table. \u00a0The first thing I noticed is how great the food smelled. \u00a0Nothing like the smell of curry in the air! We explored the menu. Some great options for sake and wines by the glass. \u00a0The overall ambiance (dimly lit and romantic)and decor was really well done and tasteful.Our appetizers we went with the spring rolls in rice paper. \u00a0For our entrees we both chose the red curry. \u00a0I had mine with chicken and my companion beef. \u00a0The spring rolls were large and stuffed o the brim with the freshest veggies and chicken, and accompanied with ample portions dipping sauces. So good I wanted to lick the plate.Next for our entrees, the red curry. \u00a0The portions were very generous. \u00a0Neither of us spoke for a few minutes as we tucked into our meal.Suddenly, instead of the recorded \u00a0jazz we had been hearing a live band began to play from the bar area. \u00a0It was then that I actually had a moment. \u00a0I realized that I now have an amazing thai place walking distance from my place. \u00a0This reminds me a lot of restaurants in Nola on Frenchman st thatbhave live jazz and serve amazing meals in an upscale setting. This is hands down the best Thai restaurant that downtown Indy(and yes better than Siam Square by far) and can rival any I've had in my 15 years of living in Chicago. Better atmosphere, better food, portions service. Go here for a date night, go with friends, or bring your kids. This is now one of my favorite places in downtown Indy and will be back for sure!"], ["Sara C.", "My first time at Bangkok Restaurant was for lunch today. The $9.99 buffet was appealing so my friend Natalie and I decided to give it a shot.One thing I really appreciated was that the buffet was labeled. I have visited Spice Nation before and while the food was great, nothing on the bar was labeled so I really didn't know what I was eating. Spicy tofu, fried rice with pork, hot and sour soup, white rice, vegetarian spring rolls, crab rangoon and shrimp pad thai were all available along with a few more dishes I did not try. What can I say, buffets fill me up!The buffet also included a small tossed salad option and a dessert, which was fried banana pieces. I didn't try them but they looked really good.I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. It was filling and, being a buffet, I could have eaten as much as I wanted to. Our server was attentive and kept refilling our waters in the busy restaurant that had every seat full. The atmosphere is comforting and inviting, with large windows that overlook Ohio street and really brighten up the wood and maroon color scheme that is throughout the restaurant. An extensive wine list and bar really emphasizes the \"jazz bar\" part of their name."], ["Vanessa S.", "I like going to their lunch buffet. First let me say I am not a fan of ALL their food. My technique is to go and get a bitesize (or less) portion out of all their dishes in the buffet and then come back for more of the ones I like.I agree with Mi Sook that some of their dishes are not good. Their eggroll/springroll is hit and miss. there are days when it's okay and days when it's awesome. I like their crab rangoon when it's fresh out of the kitchen and their pad thai. I always love their dessert, banana fritters. I like that they rotate their dishes, I have seen variety every time I go. Service is good, my water is always topped off, and you don't wait long to get your check.The noise level here is way better than the other Thai place in Fountain Square where you have to scream every time you talk. So overall I like this place and would go back for their buffet."], ["Maulik S.", "New, beautiful and well established Thai restaurant. Loved the food. Owner of place is personally greets everyone. Totally loved the place. Will come again."], ["Hannah R.", "Just got done eating here - we tried crab rangoon, basil fried rice with beef, and drunken noodles with tofu. Everything was delicious! We ordered both entrees hot, and man were they hot! The dishes were huge, loaded with basil and crunchy veggies. And did I mention hot?! (Both in flavor and temperature). I almost took this down a star bc I felt like the tofu and beef could be of better quality, but took it back up to 5 bc they don't use msg and the flavor is amazing."], ["Swarna R.", "This place is a must-try in downtown Indy ! The food is exceptional and the service was great as well. We asked for a table near the bar area where the live music happens. Great music and food always makes up for a wonderful evening !"], ["Mi Sook K.", "Thai food + downtown + buffet! Sounds like a winning combination, right? Well, that's what I thought at least up until my first visit here. I really had high hopes for this spot especially with the good Yelp reviews and since it was fairly packed with the weekday lunch crowd. Now, the buffet options didn't look particularly appetizing to me, but sometimes food tastes better than it looks. I was hoping this was the case. After sampling from my plate loaded with chicken pad thai, red curry, vegetable spring roll, fried rice, stir fried mushroom, and king pao chicken, I thought to myself 'there is nothing on this plate I'd want to go back for more of...' The pad thai was plain and awful. Overcooked, mushy noodles with barely any chicken or flavor for that matter. Perhaps I should have spooned some chopped peanuts on top for some texture. Red curry had an off-flavor to it which I couldn't pinpoint what about it was wrong. So called stir fried mushrooms were raw. Coulda used a lot more time on the stove top. After tasting what seemed like a mess on a plate, I did go back for a cup of the sweet and sour soup hoping that would redeem the meal. Yikes, that wasn't any better. It was about the worst version of this soup I've tasted. The flavor was off and the vinegar taste was overpowering. I stopped after the second spoonful. I had my fill of this unlimited buffet.While I disliked everything I tried, it wasn't all bad. My server was very attentive, professional, and friendly. She asked if I enjoyed the meal, and I confess I told a white lie. It wasn't her fault I didn't like it. The interior and soft jazz were also nice. However, all that can't make up for the shortcomings in the food. While it may just be the buffet that is a complete miss, I cannot bring myself to give this spot a second chance to check out the menu selections knowing what they served on the buffet."], ["Julianna Y.", "Wasn't too impress with this place. Not sure if they were just off their game with cooking or not. My group all thought our food was too salty. What really saved them was their spring roll appetizer. The sweet n sour sauce and the crisp of the spring roll was amazing! I really want to give this a 2, but the appetizers really saved it."], ["Lisa R.", "We used to be regulars but it's been severely disappointing the last year. There is little eggplant in the eggplant entree but it's loaded with baby corn. They add a surcharge for pick up and have left out the rice in the last two pick up orders. Done. Won't return."], ["Elizabeth P.", "As I walked in to this very classy establishment, I was completely in awe of how nice the inside was! The wine wall was simply fantastic, and such an eye catcher as you walk through the door, along with the very cute, sleek bar as you enter. I choose the Fuji Apple Sake after many of my fellow dinner dates convinced me it was the best drink on the menu and low and behold it was definitely worth it! Above and beyond any sake I have had before my visit to Bangkok Restaurant.During my dinner with fellow Yelpers, we tried a lil of each appetizer and if I wasn't already won over at this point, hello tastiest crab rangoon to ever touch my lips. I'm telling you, I would literally go back just for the sake and crab rangoon if I had the option.I ordered the Tiger Garlic and Peppers as my entree and got crazy and ordered it hot, which was a good choice because it was just the right amount of spicy...enough to make the nose run, but not blow me out of my seat.LOVED it, and will most certainly return :)"], ["Sheila P.", "Glad to see they are still open.

They have an impressive \"wine wall\" and it seems very cozy inside. We opted to sit in the bar where the live jazz was playing. That added a lovely touch. I made the decision to order spring rolls to start out with. I was a bit disappointed with these. They tasted as if they had just shoved some iceberg lettuce in a wrap and sent it out. Our table ordered Green Curry and Red Curry, vegetarian. Both were very good. The rice to curry ratio is a bit off, you will most likely need to order more rice.

Bangkok Restaurant fills a niche between standard buffet and sit-down lunch (which is slower), and does it quite well.Quick tip: Try to do an early lunch if you can be before the crowd gets there. Our group of 10 arrived between 11:15 and 11:30, and there were ample sitting and we were able to start right away. The crowd started to arrive around noon and you might have to wait a little.For the buffet selection, there were several entrees, a couple of curries, noodles (Pad Thai, Drunken Noodle), and soup & salad. Most of food was surprisingly mild, with the exception of green beans and the Tom Yum Soup (which was definitely hot). If you like spicy, you might be somewhat disappointed but you can always order entrees from the menu.Most of the food was quite good, with fresh ingredients and taste. Some of the entrees were also vegetarian-friendly. The only items that didn't work was Pad Thai (texture of the noodles didn't seem right and it wasn't tangy enough), and the curries (they pour ingredients into the curry rather than replacing the whole pot). But hey those are minor details for a lunch buffet. I know I had a good lunch and my co-workers did too.I hope to make it back for dinner to see if there is a difference. For now, I will definitely be back for lunch and it's worth the small price premium over fast food/other buffets."], ["Nic J.", "Good but not great. Atmosphere was dark, with a nice little jazz duo playing. I ordered red curry, which was available in 5 levels if heat. I went with hot, which was level 3, and probably should have went with medium. The beef in it was really good, and the portions here are huge. My wife ordered drunken noodles, which she loved. Prices were reasonable, but I couldn't stop comparing the food to Siam Square, and they lost the comparison."], ["Victoria R.", "I love Thai food and this restaurant blew Siam Square out of the water. My go to dish is always Pad Thai... had it my first time at a Thai place and I have found it very hard to stray from. I ordered mine at a 4 out of 5 spicy since other Yelpers had said that the spice level here was pretty weak and also convinced my dad to do the same (I think he got Pad See Ew). Mine was really well spiced but his was a little on the spicy side (also let me preface, we are from TX and can handle spicy food). It may have been a different chef than on other days. So if you like spicy, my advice would be get a 3 and add chili oil/paste to it if you need spicier.I am definitely going back and want to try the lunch buffet."], ["Ashley P.", "Looking for a place to satisfy your taste for Thai in a comfortable setting? Look no further than this new addition downtown Indy that seamlessly pairs Thai food with jazz.

When we walked in, nearly all of the tables were dirty, which was kinda gross BUT it was nearly 1pm so their lunch rush had probably just left. We were seated quickly by the host and told if we wanted the buffet we could go ahead. The tables were all cleaned up during the time we were eating. I counted 3 servers, a bartender, and the host and they all seemed pretty on the ball. Our waters were refilled several times and the servers checked in at least 2-3 times to make sure everything was alright. Buffet was $9.99 (lunch specials are the same price) and had a large amount of vegetarian items with tofu, as well as chicken, pork, and beef dishes. There were about 10 entrees (including pad thai, basil fried rice, and thai spaghetti), 2 appetizers (calamari, veg/potato wontons, spring rolls), soup, salad, fruit, and a couple desserts. Temps were good for all the entrees, nothing was dried up, but most of them had been kind of picked over by the time we arrived. Like...the curry chicken was onions and peppers in sauce with not a bite of chicken to be found. Everything tasted good, if just slightly on the bland side, but that's to be expected with buffets. There are multiple hot sauce options to add if you like heat. I kinda liked the dessert I tried: Coconut Jelly. It's a 2-layered Jello-y dessert with shreds of coconut in it. My main complaint is that the spoons, small plates, and soup bowls really weren't clean (dinner plates were fine). I picked up 5 dessert plates and they all felt sticky/greasy, and 2 of 3 soup bowls had some sort of fuzz in the bottom. The spoons had \"bits of crust\" on them...those little dots that you can pick off with your fingernail. Hopefully these are \"just opened issues\" and the dish machine will get its kinks worked out fairly soon. The other odd thing is that there aren't chopsticks wrapped up with the silverware. REALLY nice decor too! Great ambiance. I will definitely return for dinner sometime soon."], ["Neda F.", "The crab Rangoon was amazing. Fast service. Great atmosphere. Fairly cheap.

There are a few girls I work with who are very picky eaters but we all had the lunch buffet and everyone was very satisfied with their food.

The other Thai place in the area had already closed so we decided to walk to this place. At first we were a bit confused since it was completely empty... so we decided to sit at the bar area. Paula was the bartender for the night and she was awesome! We really enjoyed ourselves. I had a great lychee martini! The papaya salad was delicious. I also had the seafood red curry, again really good especially since I'm very picky with my veggies and they were great about substitutions. When we finished, I got the tab and put in the tip and signed it. Was not given the itemized receipt so I asked since those are always recommended for business expenses. The total didn't seem to be off so I didn't think anything of it until I just did my expense report. The total is off by an extra 73 cents (I've triple checked the math and asked another to verify). I'm not sure if computers can make this mistake but anything is possible. If I'm in the area I'll def visit this place again and see if this happens a second time. But for a first experience this did leave a bad feeling for me especially after such a great in restaurant experience. Also, no jazz, at least not on the Wednesday night we were there. Sum it up!The service at the bar was awesome (thank you Paula)! The place is a little dead since it seems to be just a little far from the main hustle and bustle of the city center but the food was def good. However, keep an eye on your tab, and do the math yourself before you sign the paper. 73 cents may not be a whole lot but in my opinion it's not ethical either. Hope this was a one time thing."], ["Jason O.", "New addition to the lunch rotation and I have to say that it was a great addition. \u00a0For 10 dollars you can order a lunch entree from the menu or choose the buffet. \u00a0Our group all went for the lunch buffet. \u00a0Starting off they have a very nice salad bar. \u00a0Not totally comprehensive but quite a few choices and very fresh. For the main dishes I believe there were 6-8 entrees, spring rolls, and soup on the buffet. \u00a0I will say that you will give up some attributes in the food by choosing the buffet as compared to ordering off the menu at say Siam Square for example mostly in the area of texture. \u00a0The flavors were very good but the food on the buffet seemed a little mushy perhaps a little over cooked comparatively. We were the first group in the restaurant for lunch so the food couldn't have been sitting for that long. \u00a0This could be expected when the food is being cooked on a much larger scale. \u00a0What you do give up in texture you gain in spades in quantity. \u00a0One of my lunch mates was elated to be able to bring a stack of spring rolls back to the table.All in all a great Thai buffet."], ["Linda L.", "Perfect for a quick lunch, or long dinner.

I was shocked that at noon on a Tuesday, it was PACKED for lunch. By the time we left, every table was taken and people had to wait or sit at the bar area. What is this madness?It makes sense, though, because there really aren't many other options on the street. Speedway is trying hard to revitalize (and it looks great with the new streetscape) but the businesses just aren't hoppin' quite like Broad Ripple or downtown.I indulged in a double cheeseburger with fries and it was good! A word of warning: you get bang for your buck here. All of the dishes are huge, including the salads! Maybe share your food if you're not that hungry?"], ["Stacie F.", "The food at Dawson's is fantastic!

That is very bad customer service.3. \u00a0One time we were given the wrong pasta dish. The waitress just said sorry. \u00a0We were hungry so we didn't want to switch it out so we just ate it. \u00a0The meal was not discounted or comped. \u00a0Any other restaurant that I have ever been to would have apologized and comped the meal.

When you decide to check out Dawson's after reading this review, please tell me later that I'm right. The breaded tenderloin on the menu, the brick walls on the interior, no-nonsense waitresses and comfortable feeling that reminds you of your one stoplight hometown. I need to spend more time exploring Speedway. Dawson's on Main is a perfect example of this. I recently hopped in for a snack (loaded potato soup, to be exact - don't kid yourselves and call this \"healthy soup\" - we're talking shredded cheese and bacon bits). The sidewalk seating is fun for a glass of wine and watch pedestrians pass on Main Street. The breaded tenderloin is tasty, by the way."], ["Amy C.", "I love the calamari at Dawson's! It's the steak fries cut kind. They come with three sauces. It's prob. the best calamari I've ever had, for real. I've never had a bad meal here. Pot roast, meatloaf, ruben sandwich,it's all good.

We had made a reservation, but it wasn't necessary. We were eating around 2 on a Saturday. They accommodated our group of 8 very easily. I got the California BLT. It was supposed to come with spicy aioli, and it didn't, which was actually fine with me - I'm not a big spice fan. Another person ordered something that was supposed to come with zesty ketchup and didn't. Those were my only complaints! My sandwich was really good. It came with 6 or 7 large pieces of bacon, which is unusual. I feel like places usually skimp on the bacon, and that was not the case here. It was just the way that I liked it, crispy but not overly so. I tried someone else's salad, and that was very good too. I tried my boyfriend's potato salad which was good. Our waitress was attentive. The restaurant itself looked nice - I liked the glasswork throughout, the waterfall in the back. We found that there was a lot across the street with free 2 hour parking. I would definitely come back if we were in the area again."], ["Ashley P.", "A speedway staple! Cannot go wrong going to Dawson's. I love the exposed brick on the interior and the fact that if you work in the auto racing industry like I do you're bound to see someone you know during lunch. The service today was great.

We sat in the bar cause that's where we normally sit. The bartender was one of our servers and he was super friendly. I opted for the prime rib with garlic mashed potatoes and mixed veggies. And it was great. It was a 12 ounce cut for $21. There was also a 14 ounce cut for $25, but the small one was big enough. It was a tender cut of meat with little fat on it.Kyle got the meatloaf with garlic mashed potatoes with brown gravy and potato salad (he is not a mixed veg fan) He got 2 pieces of meatloaf that had been seared on a flat top. He really enjoyed it and I tasted it and it was good.

The staff was friendly and greeted me as soon as I came into the door to kick off the small town feel for the visit. It was close to Fat Tuesday so servers wore Mardi Gras beads to be festive (ta-tas stayed in). We had a great server. She greeted us promptly and was able to accurately take our orders without writing anything down, a method which I view as something you can do with experience. She was friendly and seemed happy to be at work. Let's get to the main attraction, food. I chose to get the black and bleu sandwich on this visit. It was really good. Instead of a traditional hamburger patty, it was shaved prime rib. There was a creamy sauce on the sandwich that had horseradish on it and it was delicious. I caught myself licking my fingers like I was at a bbq eating contest. The fries were good too, they weren't anything super special but they were good enough that I made sure I finished them all. Atmosphere: Dawson's gives a classic American restaurant vibe. Most dishes are classic American cuisine and some might have a little bit of a flare. Space in the restaurant is comfortable and amble to accomidate larger groups. Street parking is free (with the exception of race weeks)."], ["Melissa E.", "Great service. Huge portions.

From their salmon to their nachos, they get it all right! On top of that, they have a super friendly and accommodating wait staff. On one occasion we arrived at 8:55 and they were closing at 9pm. Instead of turning us away the gal who greeted us sat us at an outdoor table in her section, stating that she would be there awhile tending to other customer's anyhow. What great service! On another occasion I was undergoing some allergy testing and had very strict requirements. The young man who served us inside was incredibly patient and considerate. He checked with the kitchen on several things and helped me create a fantastic meal that met my dietary needs!

We sat at a table in the bar and had EXCELLENT service the whole time.The problem here was the food which ranged from average to the lower end of mediocre.For appetizers, we got the pretzel sticks with hot mustard sauce. There was no salt on the sticks which wasn't too big of a deal but the alleged hot mustard sauce was really just yellow mustard which was kind of lame. One person got the French Onion soup which he said was tasty except the weird crouton that was more like a hard English biscuit. Another person got the potato soup which had WAY too much flour in it to the point it was actually gritty.I got the Sticks and Stones pasta for an entree and the pepperoni and sausage in it was delicious but the pasta was severely undercooked....as in still crunchy. On the other hand, the chicken in it was so overcooked it was inedible - I had to eat around it.One tablemate ordered a burger with coleslaw and said they were good but nothing special. The other got a tenderloin that was also overcooked and the onion rings which might have been good except they had been fried in really old grease.

The chicken was over-cooked and under-seasoned. I'm a little wimpy when it comes to blackening spices, so I was a little concerned it would be too spicy when I ordered it. There was no kick to this whatsoever. The salad was huge but only had half a chicken breast on it and grocery store quality Parmesan. Finally the salad dressing was subpar.

I have to say, everything was delicious. The fish was cooked perfectly, there were no bones, and the blackening spice was sufficient (I love blackening, so I could've used a bit more, but that's just because I love it in large amounts). The rice was good and the green beans were delicious, cooked with a bit of salt and garlic. On top of the fish was a tequila-pineapple mixture which was kinda like a chunky salsa but fortunately the pineapple did not overpower because it's a strong flavor and one I dislike.My friend had the steak susan which he said was also quite good. It definitely looked good.The only reason I hold back from giving it 5 stars is that everything was just a bit oversalted.

The Black & Bleu prime rib sandwich was my choice on this trip and as usual good. The prime rib was a bit tough but the caramelized onions, grilled mushrooms, blue cheese crumbles and tiger sauce (Horsey sauce) helps you overlook that tiny detail. \u00a0Onion rings are large and yummy. \u00a0Chicken Salad and BLT were popular today as well.

I seriously have to think about coming back here again."], ["Denise R.", "Although a westsider growing up near Speedway and a Speedway resident for a couple of years as an adult, I hadn't seen the downtown Speedway area in approximately 15 years. I was blown away with the renovation. To top off our visit, we opted to try Dawson's on Main for lunch. Let me start by stating that I prefer independent restaurants to chains, so I jumped at the chance to sample Dawson's. We had a choice of inside or outside, and today would have been a perfect day to sit outside, especially since we noticed a couple of race cars (or the same race car twice) make their way down Main. The clientele was a mixture of people enjoying summer leisure time and professionals in suits. The Speedway area had gotten pretty sketchy 15 years ago, but this little area, at least, felt safe and was quite beautiful. The menu provided for an assortment of appetizers, salads, and sandwiches with a few entrees listed. We all opted for sandwiches -- my daughter ordering the tenderloin, my mother ordering the chicken cordon bleu wrap, and me ordering the Dawson's black & bleu. My daughter also ordered their French onion soup. Since my husband runs a restaurant, I'm a food snob and hoped everything would taste as wonderful as the menu descriptions.I was not disappointed. My daughter's tenderloin was huge and accompanied by a wonderful special sauce. She also raved about the French onion soup, which she said rivaled what her chef father makes. My mother's chicken cordon bleu wrap was fantastic, and my black & blue sandwich which consisted of shaved prime rib, carmelized onions, and special sauce on a wonderfully-fresh bun was incredible. This sandwich was a bit spicy for me, but the fact that I kept eating even when the sides of my mouth stung a little should tell you something. I was stuffed after the first half but just kept on eating until I finished every savory bite. Our meal for three people, including drinks and extra soup, came to about $13 per person.

I highly recommend the loaded potato cakes, and the smoked blue cheese dressing was to die for!Dawson's is a great addition to the Speedway neighborhood and the west side in general, but I feel they need to tweek a few things to get that 5th star. 1. They need a signature bread. A hearty loaf of 7 grain would be an awesome compliment to their steaks, in stead of the puny little frozen rolls that accompany them now. 2.They need to get rid of the formica table tops! Bring in some wooden tables or better yet, copper topped tables would go a long way to warming up and giving character to a young establishment.3 A signature dessert wouldn't hurt either.

Here's a slightly funky, independent bar and grill plunked among the chain-saturated streets of the Westside of Indianapolis. Whatever Dawson's is, it's not Applebee's or Chili's or Union Jack's. The food is hearty and savory. We tried the Black & Bleu, a sirloin topped with saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, caramelized onions and a Bleu cheese and bacon crust. Formidable and filling. We also tried the horseradish crusted sirloin and the signature soup, an onion soup topped with cheese and mushrooms. What surprised us was the quality of the steamed vegetable medley that accompanied. What you miss from the chains are the ferns and the brass rails. What you gain is the commitment of independent owners who want their place to be something special."], ["Brian F.", "Cute little restaurant on Main Street, Speedway.

It is just a bar/restaurant that doesn't even deserve consideration as being a place to get great liquor options in Indy. That being said, it is still worth a stop in if you are looking for some good food in a divey type atmosphere. The entirety of my visits here have come for lunch or the occasional dinner. They are a nice stop for lunch during the work week because the kitchen is always quick to get your food out so it is possible to eat here and still make it back on time. Fortunately, it is now smoke free, although I don't think anything else has changed in the last at least 6 years that I have been in town. Their menu is slightly more unique than the most typical pub grub, and everything I have had here has been great. I am particularly impressed with their BBQ offerings. The best part is the prices make this place a very affordable stop. The service has always been pretty good here, and the ladies working are always really nice.The atmosphere is definitely more of a dive bar than a sports place, and it definitely isn't upscale. They have a neat old building, but I am not too sure what the history is. I imagine it has a story behind it that is worth hearing about. There is both an upstairs and a downstairs with seating on each level, along with a patio along the sidewalk and a balcony the hangs over the front of the building. The upstairs patio is the best place to sit, in my opinion. It isn't the nicest views from the outside seating, but it still gets you some fresh air. Their beer selection is only ok, with a lot of it coming in bottles, but they do carry a lot of specials on different nights of the week. I'm not really sure this is a place I would go out of my way to stop in for a night when I wanted to go out, but it is a great place to get a good lunch or dinner downtown for around $10. This would be a 4 star review from me if they got more stuff on tap, and if they stopped using Styrofoam cups for every single person that sits down."], ["Frank S.", "Love this spot. Perfect industry place with daily drink specials, great late night food and an elevated downtown patio.

For example, the salad is like banquet food with a little dinner roll and foil wrapped butter on the side. The entrees had a little piece of greenery with a tomato on top to \"decorate the plate.\" VERY dated.Also, who EVER thought it was a good idea to add cheese to a grilled fish salad?The food was okay. I guess it was a little better than average pub food, but not good enough to bother spending money here in the future.What was truly atrocious was how unfriendly the staff was. She stopped in the middle of our order to answer another colleagues question. She then came back and we had to start all over again. She then stopped by a third time and said she forgot what we ordered. Just a small example of bad service during the visit, but I could point out many examples of bad service directed at us and also other patrons at the bar.Just not good enough to bother!

The chips were WAY over-salted, to the point where I was actually wiping the salt off of each chip before dipping it. The wings were average. Nothing special. **Side Note: My boyfriend (who was with me) just looked over my shoulder and said he thought two stars was too harsh. He would give 2.5 if it was his decision.** My sandwich (definitely not even close to a traditional po boy) was below average and the french fries were almost inedible because of the really, really, really salty seasoning. Like, I honestly don't know if they forgot they had seasoned them and then salted them again. The boyfriend's fries were equally over-salty (though we were both so hungry we slathered them in ranch and wolfed them down) and his brisket sandwich was \"like tough little squares of meat. Like bits of leather.\" But then again, Indiana isn't known for its BBQ OR its seafood, so maybe it's our fault for ordering those items.The drinks were fine, the service was good (it was PACKED and the servers did a really good job of making sure we had refills, etc...), and I think maybe it's just more of a bar than a restaurant.

It's like she wanted to speak to us as little as possible. She did an adequate job making sure we had everything we need, but I would be happy to get a different waitress next time.

I made it myself.\" Very cool to see someone take pride in his work like that. \u00a0 \u00a0The food on the other hand, is Bourbon Street's saving grace. We got the Macho Nachos to start. They have cheese piled high and chili with sour cream, black olives, and jalape\u00f1os. They've got macho flavor!

Indiana only recently changed its laws to allow small-scale distilleries to operate at all, but this is not the first such business. It's just a restaurant and bar.But mostly bar. It's really a bar that serves food. I come here quite often for lunch because of its proximity to my office (big plus in the winter) and its reasonably-priced lunch specials. Those usually run $7-10, depending on what, exactly, it is. But I've gotten a half rack ribs for $9 before, and that included fries and slaw.And that's generally the case here: everything is very reasonable. You won't find $12 burgers or $35 steaks like some places in town. There are a lot of sandwiches, all running under $10. Granted, I have not been here for dinner, and they do have a different dinner menu, so they may go up in price quite a bit then.For the actual food, it's really run the gauntlet. The first time I was here, I had something with a side of red beans and rice. Since I grew up on that sort of stuff, I'll hold off on talking about it, but I will say that you should not go out of your way for it. Despite the name, they don't seem to have many \"cajun\" options, at least when I've gone. On their web site, they say \"best ribs in Indianapolis\"... Not sure about that, but it may be true. The ribs are not that good, but I actually have not had any other ribs in Indy, so, in spite of that, they may actually be the best. The pulled pork sandwich is decent enough.The atmosphere can get weird. It's a bar, but it gets busy with office workers at lunch, and that's an odd combination. The last time I was in here, I sat at the bar, and there was a drunk guy who sounded exactly like the bear from The Cleveland Show (and kinda looked like him too). He swilled his swill and tried to talk to me about his problems. But trying to BS with a guy who has less than an hour to spare on his lunch like you would with a guy alone at a bar is not going to work.I see a lot of complaints about the service here, and that's valid enough. It's not usually very friendly. Don't expect Hooters or Macaroni Grill. The servers are few and they're typically pretty busy.

The sides were what was already on the plate and when were confused the waitress acted like we should know better. So we paid extra for the Jambalaya. Everything was HORRIBLE!!!!! The catfish was so gross sitting in a pile of grease, but with an outershell of a crust so hard you could barley eat it. I have never seen a fish be able to separate from its batter and slide out leaving the batter shell on the plate.\u00a0 The jambalaya tasted like lipton microwave rice and the etouffee was uneatable. When we asked for the bill, the waitress asked if we wanted a box since we had each only taken a bite of each of our sampler items. When we said no she told us we could not waste all that food. I told her the food was not to our liking and we would not eat eat it so no reason to take it. She didn't ask if we wanted something different or offer to take it off the bill. She just huffed away and brought us our check. I felt bad that the groupon was kinda of a waste but at least we didn't get stuck with a $45 bill for such BADBAD food!

You get huge servings, so be prepared to take some home or eat too much. Drinks are spot on, with a variety on tap. My main reason to love this place is the location. It sits in the corner, and they have an upstairs and downstairs patio space, so you can sit outside and watch the world around you. It is also just far enough out I'd the heart of downtown so parking is easy (street - meters) and not stressful. Check it out!

Generous portion of vegetables and chicken.All around great restaurant!"], ["Selma G.", "Great place, with a wide variety of drinks and food.

We originally ordered a different pasta, but did not like it. We asked to replace with something else, and the manager came over, apologized (did not really have to), and said we would get our different order out shortly. Before we got our bill, we found out that the manager took the amount for our entrees off the bill. This was extremely generous!!! Although it is a chain (we try local as much as possible), we would definitely go back, and recommend it to others!"], ["Adrienne G.", "2 stars is described as \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" and that is exactly how our group of five felt about The Yard House. We've experienced better service. We've experienced better food. We've experienced better ambiance. My sister had a gift card so we thought we would give it a try after the Colts game. Yelp reviews looked good and we were excited to try something new. There was no wait and we were seated immediately. Our server was quick to greet us and take our drink order. Their menu is quite large and it took us a while to make a decision. We ordered the onion tower for our app, 2 bowls of soup (chicken noodle and french onion), and a Caesar salad. Entrees included the chicken cobb salad, fish and chips, roast beef dip, pepper jack burger and the grilled cheese with tomato bisque. After we place our order, our server kind of disappears and we are left with empty glasses. We don't see her again until she brings out the soups and salad. Why our appetizer was not brought out before this, I don't know. Nobody was blown away with the soups or salad. The onion rings were eventually brought out and they were OK. I would probably order them again.Our dinners were brought out and we dove in. I had the fish and chips and while their shoestring fries were great, the fish left a lot to be desired. Not much flavor in the beer batter and they were quite greasy. I tried the hubby's grilled cheese and thought the gorgonzola cheese was not necessary. Looking through the menu, I thought that about a lot of items. Like, they were adding ingredients just to add ingredients without thinking about how it will taste. Not a single person in our party finished their meal. We thought that maybe ordering desert would save the meal. Meh! First, when you put creme brulee on your menu, you might want to mention that it is covered in bananas. (note: the printed menu does not list this but the online version does.) Good thing we were not allergic. We also ordered the fresh baked brownie with vanilla ice cream. The brownie is served in the pan that it is baked in. Cute idea but the pan continued to bake the brownie and by the time we were half way through, the edges were rock hard. Ugghhh. Disappointed again!During our meal we had to constantly ask for refills, our server disappeared multiple times. I wasn't sure what style they were trying to go for. Romantic vibe with low lighting? Sports bar with multiple TV's? Family friendly? Not real sure.Not impressed. Won't go back."], ["Matt R.", "My experience was one of the 4 star kind... if they would have gotten my steak right the first time. It was just me and I sat up at the bar. There was a big screen TV with the Cubs game, 156 beers on tap, and pleasant, non-imposing, bar tenders. All was good... I ordered a Hoegarden draft and \u00a0a filet, medium rare. The filet came out and was well done... not an ounce of pink in the center... very far away from medium rare. I hesitated to send it back, but after all, it is filet... for $30, it needs to be right. After informing the bartender, and sending it back to the kitchen, the manager quickly came out and apologized. She agreed that is was overcooked and offered me a free brew while I waited for the new cut. The correctly cooked steak was fantastic. Cooked pefectly and atop a delicious peppercorn cream sauce. I greatly enjoyed it. BOTTOM LINE: Fantastic steak at a good value... but make sure it's cooked right!"], ["Ro T.", "I don't know.If that could be my entire review and everyone understand my feelings, I'd stop right there.The atmosphere was confusing: modern/romantic decor but big screen tv's and sports playing... and soft, dim lighting.After seeing the menu online, we were kind of excited to try this place for Devour Downtown. A group of five of us went. We were sorely neglected by our waiter, Drew. He faithfully attended to the group of college kids next to us even though I can almost guarantee that they wouldn't have tipped as much as we, but I digress. The neglect was so real that one of my friends had to fill her glass up with a bottle of water from her purse. Management saved the day. I'll talk more about that in a bit. We need to discuss food.I ordered a chicken dish that came with sweet potato pancakes. The chicken was ok. It was lacking salt, but maybe it was just me.The pancakes were super yummy. Totally made up for the chicken. For dessert I had their crem\u00e9 brulee. There wasn't much of that crunch that you look for in a crem\u00e9 brulee because they added bananas on top of the custard, then sugar, then torched it which made it a bit weird. One of the managers was super attentive. She refilled our drinks, took care of the rest of our orders, tended to my friend's entre\u00e9 that had some issues and had a GREAT personality to boot. She, alongside the greeting manager, saved our whole experience.The drinks were awesome. The decor/atmosphere was confusing. The appetizer and dessert were ok. The entree was half and half.

It was right across from our hotel and we heard it was good, so we gave it a try. The interior is really cool and trending. They have a TON of beers on tap, so it was cool to sit next to the bar. We got to half-yards, just for the experience . We also tried their weekend special bourbon drink and the citrus cocktail as well. All were very well prepared and tasted great. The food was so-so. Both meals were a little less exciting than I feel like they should have been. I got the chicken bowl, which was nothing special but still good. And my boyfriend got to bbq chicken pizza. We also tried the coconut shrimp, which was the best thing we got. The reason for only 4 stars was because the food just wasn't as good as we were hoping for! But with such a large menu, there are definitely more options to try next time!"], ["Brittney M.", "I went to Yard House for lunch 2 days in a row this week.

(I had to add even more condiments than what come on it!)Each time I was in, the place was almost unbearably cold. I'm the kind of gal who keeps her house set on 66 degrees. And I was shivering in there at lunch time.I wanted to love it here! I had high hopes from the first try, and then the second time around was a miss."], ["Joel F.", "I want to give them more stars...I really do. But I simply cannot.I worked down at Circle Centre so I have talked to a lot of people about Yard House. See, I am not a beer drinker...so to go to a brewery is just not the norm for me. But everyone I talked to said that the food was great so I decided to give it a try.We went in on a Saturday late in the afternoon around 4pm. I first could not believe how big they made this place. I also couldn't get over the fact that I was eating in what used to be Nordstrom. We were quickly seated and told that our server would be right over. We began to look through the drink and regular menu and began to discuss what we were going to ordered. Everything pretty much sounded good so it was tough to narrow it down.While we looked a guy came up and told us that he would get us our drinks while we waited for our server. I thought that was nice and ordered a diet coke and strawberry fields martini (it sounded good). While he was away our actual server came over and introduced himself. We started off with an appetizer just because we still didn't know what we wanted to eat yet. While we waited for that we narrowed down what we wanted and ordered the rest. This is the last time we see our server until much, much later.Every time that something was brought to our table it was done by a different person. When our main course came out no one cleared the plates off the table from the appetizer. Our server seriously never came back. My diet coke was refilled by one of the managers. It was so annoying...to the point where I do not know who actually got the tip.As far as the food goes: we started with the onion rings. They were amazing. They had a great batter on them that was full of flavor. It also came with a regular ranch and a southwest ranch to dip them in. For the main meal I went with a burger. It had a great grilled flavor to it and was cooked the way that I wanted it to be cooked. The fries had good flavor for being fries. All around the food was great!! My martini was not what I was expecting though. I have had flavored ones before that taste good but this was like drinking straight vodka. OMG it was a struggle to finish it...but I did as it was $11. If their drinks are based on that then they are worth the money because wow it was strong.When our server finally decided to return to the table and we told him that we did not want any dessert I would assume that a normal server would drop off the check. Nope, not this guy. We had to sit there and wait quite awhile for him to come back around to ask him for it. With how much this guy was not around I could have walked out without paying and they would probably not have known for quite some time. But I am not like that...so I obviously did not walk out without paying.I really wish that the service would have matched the price that we paid for the meal. If that had happened I would have given probably 5 stars...but they barely get 3 because they left me feeling abandoned and not important enough to receive great service."], ["Scott M.", "Korean tacos, totally amazing 5 star food. Can't recommend them enough and am salivating just thinking about them. Best (and most expensive) Korean tacos I've ever had.Why 4 stars then?

Please!"], ["Januarie Y.", "Hmmmmmmmmmmm. How do I review you Yard House? That is the question I've been asking myself repeatedly since I left this place. I have yet to find a good answer so I've decided to just wing it. I won't make it long (seriously, I won't). Atmosphere: It was cool. A mix of sporty intimacy, which seems odd. The bar had hundreds of beer on tap and that was pretty cool, but the booths had that unspoken romantic vibe about them and so did the dark lighting. The kitchen area looked great, such so that both my sister and I laughed about how we could see Chef Ramsey coming out of there slinging cusswords and plates. It's also very huge in there. I can see them being a hot spot for game nights, but I can also see people on dates in there. It should make for an interesting dynamic in the future. Food: The food was great. I ordered Louisiana Hot Chicken which was paired with Sweet Potato Pancakes (A first for me), which was really good! The food was piping hot when it arrived. We were there for Devour Downtown, so we also had a dessert and appetizer (not in that order). I got the Truffle Fries, which was a solid dance of thin french fries. The dessert I ordered was the peach and apple cobbler. I liked the mixture of fruit but not so much the topping. It was a bit too hard for a cobbler IMO. Service: Drew. Our server was Drew and upon his arrival at our table we knew he wasn't going to be great. He seemed so blase. Is that how you spell that word? Well, he seemed like he didn't want to be there, didn't want to serve us or just was all in his head about his recent life decisions (whatever they may be), but we gave him the chance to be great. He wasn't. Once our full party of five arrived, it became a cat and mouse game of getting Drew to our table. He wasn't there. He was every where but our table although he passed by us quite a bit. He waited on the table of college kids that sat perpendicular to our table quite often. Drew gave so few dambs about our table that my sister refilled her own glass of water w/bottled water from her purse. I on the other hand, discovered pieces of hair in my pancakes, which was a huge disappointment for some really good food. Drew didn't know this because he wasn't around. But the manager stopped by just to do a friendly round about check and I explained to her what was happening. She had me a new plate made and comp'd my food. She also refilled our water. Drew made a few guest appearances at our table, especially after taking notice of the manager (managers are in white shirts, servers in black). Too little, too late. But for the fact that we are a great group of people to dine out with, Drew could have ruined our experience a bit. But our laughter coupled with the caring concern of the manager worked it all out. Overall - Well, I dish those three stars out with my head up. I don't know if I will return. The food was great (without the hair) and the chicken was really juicy (fried). It's actually sad because I would like to try them again. Maybe some other time after I forget about Drew. The managers worked to save our experience and I give them all the points for being friendly, attentive, fixing and concerned. But Drew made us wonder why we were there when there are double digits worth of other places we could have chose from to eat for DD. Next time, I will skip Yard House. Maybe it's the mixture of sports and intimacy that throws everybody off a little bit. Hashtag SPLAT."], ["Samantha K.", "Just meh for me, nothing to right home about!

It was juicy and tasty and as satisfying as any other burger. As a gimmicky play on their name they serve beer in a half yard tall glass. It's equal to two pint glasses so if you're a light weight you might skip it. I, however, could not resist. When the thing came it was as tall as I was.

So when I tasted the first cocktail I knew the rest of the night would be delicious!!!Early in the year, I wandered up in here when it was slightly still a construction site and told to come back for the good food. I had no idea they would come up with such a sleek modern environment when done. Thank goodness this place looks more fetching then a lot of wood and brass restaurants popping up. The entrance has a club feel to it, and they have a neatly displayed wine wall as well as brewery, and monster size bar of 120 taps. So on to the food!! I had the Baja Fish, Korean Street Taco and Cobb Salad and Captain Royce had the Ribeye and Grilled Shrimp. I will say I wasn't a fan of the Korean taco...there just wasn't enough flavor, spice, sauce to it. I've had authentic (cuz I'm all cultured and stuff) and when I say sauce I don't mean dripping. I mean that grease and grill fullness that reminds you heart burn is the third largest killer of joy in America. \u00a0I also want a little less crisp and more ferment in the cabbage, but that is JUST my annoying opinion. The shrimp, OMG bless their little souls for landing in Indianapolis. They were succulent, firm not rubbery or overcooked, they were salted, and grilled perfectly. I would hope the chef decides to add a few more to the side order instead of three. \u00a0The salad was delicious, the corn really added a crunchy sweetness to balance the flavor of the bacon and cilantro. The ribeye was amazing EVEN though Captain had it well done lol. \u00a0The mash had corn and just enough garlic to slay a vampire.

It was a little overwhelming and as many others have noted, often a red flag. Here's what I can say about our experience:-Truffle fries: shoestring, a little greasy, not skimpy on the truffle-y/herb-y/cheesy topping, worth the $4.95 price-(Mac and cheese)^2: not sure why it's called this, overall pretty good, white meat chicken was of good quality, big pieces of legit real crispy bacon, plenty of mushrooms, wish that it had a more traditional macaroni-type noodle-Service: attentive if not strange, waiter who was super prompt on refills but lingered way too much and took small talk to the next level, a little rushed (including delivering the entrees when we were only halfway through the appetizer)-Decor/Ambience: OK, cool views in beer keg and wine areas, huge layout, classy appearing but generic art on the walls, lots of TVs playing sports, ultimately I'm not sure what kind of vibe they're trying to create?This experience was surely A-OK.

I went on a Saturday night to watch a Cubs game and even though we were in Indy, the liveliness from the crowd made it seem as though we were in Chicago. The menu was really big (and going as hungry as I was) it was hard to narrow down the choices quickly. I asked the waitress what she would recommend and she couldn't say a clear answer, which in my opinion is a turnoff because the staff should be experts of the menu.

Indy's finally got a top notch bar to be proud of. While Indy has its fair share of cool bars, the presence of Yard House has made me feel at home. The original was founded in Long Beach back in the day when I was doing recon in that area. I've scored so many, umm, top notch brews, that that I feel totally at home. I'm proud to finally have a new place to hang in Indy. The location feels a little bit \"secret\", yet it is right there near the mall. \u00a0You'll have to seek it out, but you'll be glad you did. I think they have a 10:00 PM happy hour too with both food and beer specials, which historically has been worthwhile. They have great food with the expected bar fare (burgers and pizza) plus a few healthy options. While the food is great, you'll be shocked to see the number of brews on tap. I think they have well over a thousand (don't quote me, as I'm currently about 10 in)."], ["Danielle W.", "One word, OVERPRICED. Yes, they have a really large beer selection and decent (as best) food. I had the Mac n Cheese with Truffle oil, which was gross and I would not recommend it to anyone.

My fianc\u00e9 and I had been looking forward to giving it a try since he had been to a location in California. We went on a Wednesday night and they were not busy at all. The place is huge, neatly designed. The beer menu is extensive, without a doubt and even their food menu has diverse offerings. Looking at the food menu after ordering a beer each and truffle fries, it became apparent that their food is overpriced compared to what you can get at other restaurants in walking distance. While they offer $15 gourmet burgers or $30+ steaks, that is way more than what similar items cost at nearby Rock Bottom or Granite City brewery restaurants. Harry & Izzy's and Palomino, both more upscale restaurants nearby, have superior atmospheres and food at similar price points. I ordered a Dogfishhead Punkin Ale pint and he ordered a local craft beer. Both were priced approximately \u00a0$2 per pint than what you pay at other restaurants downtown. The service was okay and the truffle fries were good, but not mind-blowing. It was $20 for fries and 2 beers, not a good value for Indianapolis. We left and ate dinner at Rock Bottom instead. Basically, they have a lot of overhead for that huge space and the prices reflect that, but we won't go back because there are local and chain restaurants (this too is a chain) nearby that are a much better value for your dollar."], ["Amy W.", "This place has an amazing menu!

But with that everything is really pricey - pretty noticeably so compared to a similar place downtown like Scotty's.

We each ordered three tacos. I had the swordfish, the pork belly, and the vegetarian. They were all delicious, but my favourite was the vegetarian surprisingly. It was a great mix of grilled onion, mushroom, and I think goat or feta cheese. I had it with Mac and cheese, which was pretty basic Mac and cheese. It wasn't bad but I'm not a Big Mac and cheese fan. My friend ordered the carnitas, the baja, and Korean short rib.

The short rib taco included spicy papaya, sriracha aioli, and chili threads and the pork belly taco had radish kimchi, black & white sesame seeds and chili threads. Both tacos were excellent! The short rib was a little spicy with deep favor, and the pork belly was a little fatty with equally great flavor. Shoestring fries are always a favorite of mine and these lived up to my expectations.My wife chose the BBQ Bacon Cheddar burger. Besides the obvious, it also came slathered with BBQ sauce and garlic aioli. Dora here. This burger was giant and juicy and full of flavor! Yum! Just wish the iced tea was normal, not fruity, and the service, speedier. We arrived around 12:30 and were seated immediately in the packed large restaurant, but our food seemed to take forever to come out.

I heard a lot about poor service, mediocre food, and worst of all, lackluster beer lists.Not so here. I'm often skeptical of this genre of \"too-many-to-count\" draft lists at bars. The list at Yard House is the best I've seen, though. I went with a diverse beer palate -- some like fruity beers, others like Belgian-style, others like roasty stouts and porters. Yard House had local, quality, innovative selections in all of those categories and more. This was accented by a fantastic food selection, spanning many different regions and themes beyond pub grub, and all high quality. Best of all for a vegetarian, there was an entire gardein menu featuring meatless versions of popular appetizers and entrees. Our favorites were the lettuce wraps, the eggplant flatbread, and the a la carte tacos. The service was great, though it was pretty empty at the early hour we were there. Still, our server knew his beer and was responsive and reliable at all times. I hope they're able to keep this up immediately before and after games, too.

We also tried the Bahn mi with pork belly sandwich. It was tough and under seasoned. The appetizer, ahi poke stack, was good but not amazing. Beer prices were much higher than the average local market price. Food prices were above average as well. All in all a decent experience but too pricey for the quality offered.UPDATE: I decided to give it another try. I ordered a Surf and Turf burger with lobster and Swiss. I also got the clam chowder again and truffle fries. The fries came out cold but they brought me another order of hot ones. They were good, as was the soup. The burger cost $14 but was quite mediocre. It lacked flavor in the meat itself. I ordered it medium rare but I'm sure it was almost well done. It could have benefitted from some salt. BRU or a Punch has much better burgers. Rating stays a 3 because the service was great with a friendly staff."], ["Brittany C.", "Very cool place, lots of space and a huge beer selection.

I live close and stop in here frequently because I really like the Beer sculpture. They have a really cool keg room with windows so you can geek at all the kegs. Ok, not for everyone but this Beer geek loves it. And then there is this decoration on the ceiling that looks like huge pipes running from the keg room to the bar of over 100 taps. I am sure at least one of the pipes may be used to run the beer. But it is really dramatic to see all the pipes run to the bar. The bar is big, attractive and comfortable.They have a big beer list and conveniently sorted by styles. But, there is also a digital chalkboard with limited release selections. These are worth taking a look at before you decide which beer you want. This is where I lose a star....too much money for a beer.Food too! \u00a0The menu is huge. The first time I looked at it I had to think....no way can the kitchen do all of these styles and dishes well. After eating here four times I am convinced I am correct. The food and the service is hit or miss. Some of the food is really good. For example, the Jambalaya is really good....although a small portion. For a beer place, the servers do not know much about beer. So, I am not calling this a beer place but a trendy place where they have a lot of beer.

My 1/2 yard took almost 25 minutes to get to the table - my friend's pints were almost gone by the time I got my large drink.And the fact that they only allow 3 samples - when they have over 200 taps - is more than slightly ridiculous.

Hey, sometimes a flagship is all you're after and there isn't anything wrong with that. These are totally legit beers but if you want something different this isn't the place.

The second time, our server seemed to not truly care and was just trying to get through his shift. Food - truffle fries are a must! So delicious. I can't remember the food I got the first time, but tonight we split crab cakes and truffles fries. The crab cakes were disappointing because there were only 2 about the size of a fast food burger compared to the nacho dip appetizer for the same price that has about 4x the food. With 130 beer taps, drinks are always excellent. One of my favorite beers of all time is the Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale and they seems to have it all the time. Tonight, one that stuck out was the Dogfish Head 120 Minute (18% alcohol!!!). Yard House and Hopcat (in Broad Ripple) are tied for the most craft taps in Indiana. Environment is super dim. Plenty of TVs with sports on around the bar. Classic music. Millennial service staff. I would definitely recommend mostly because of the beer options.

I went there for lunch with a friend the other day and I was not disappointed! The restaurant is gigantic and they seem very well staffed. I love how it is set up with a colossal bar in the middle. One of the main things I noticed is that there is quite a bit a space in the general bar area. There are huge tvs at every angle. I plan to watch some Stanley Cup Playoffs there in the near future. I think it would be the perfect place for that.Their beer selection is unbelievable. My favorite part about their beer selection is that they have a very organized list of all their drafts. It is separated into beer class and indicates the IBU of each beer that they carry. There is an option to get a pint, a 23 oz I believe and if you are daring, the yard. I ended up choosing a pint of Hoegaarden and it was delightful. The menu is very good as well. It is not just the basic bar food, the menu is unique and quite impressive. I was there during lunch time and they offer various lunch specials that are fairly reasonably priced. I was starving when I came in, so I split the lobster/crab artichoke with my friend and it was quite filling. I ordered half of a hot pastrami sandwich and a bowl of chicken tortilla soup which were fabulous. The only thing to be wary of is that there is only one entrance. There is not an entrance that is on the inside of the Circle Center Mall, like the other restaurants. There is only an entrance that sits on Maryland St."], ["Cody S.", "I felt underdressed waking in, but this place is like a fancy steakhouse and bw3's \u00a0had a baby. You might think that sucks , but I thought it was great. Over 100 beers on tap and really good food. Good place but leans more towards the steakhouse than the sports bar on the check....kinda pricy."], ["Emily U.", "I love that this place caters to vegetarian eaters with \"Gardein\" (pronounced \"gar-DEEN\"), a fake meat or beef substitute. It's nice to see a chain, especially in downtown Indy, that actually cares about diners who don't base their diets around meat. That said, it's kind of scary how few of their menu items clock in at under 600 calories. I think I counted two among non-meat options. Vegetarian does not necessarily equal healthy. Vibe-wise, I could barely tell the difference between this place and Kilroy's or Champps or the like. They were going a little overboard on the AC and a lot overboard on the amount of TVs. They have tons of beer options and a good selection of craft brews, but you'll pay almost $7 for a pint you could get elsewhere for $5. I guess this is the tourist premium."], ["Jb M.", "My first experience was not what I had expected, but I decided to give them another try and found the service to be much better than the first time, in fact, I've been back at least 3 times. They have a very extensive menu which is great if you have people in your party who are vegetarians, vegans, and gluten intolerant. The one time our waitstaff said, tell us what you want we will try and do it for you. The last time we were there was during a Colts game. Again, the service was attentive, but they allowed us to watch the game without a lot of interruptions. I've had the vegan pizza several times and I would recommend it. Also the Kung Pao Calamari is a favorite. The people at the host desk are always friendly and helpful. I'm glad I tried it again."], ["A S.", "Great ambiance, great food! Beer selection was great. We got the margarita pizza and truffle fries. I would definitely come back again!"], ["Joseph O.", "Why does this place put jalape\u00f1o on everything? I was asking the server about what items have jalape\u00f1os on the lunch menu. I went with the Turkey Melt because according to him there were no jalape\u00f1os. He even went as far as to have put the garlic sauce on the side. Sandwich come out there are jalape\u00f1os. Sent it back and second sandwich comes out with just meat and cheese. Manager did come over and apologize, before that I would have given this place one star, she saved the day. Prices are too high to allow a snafu like this. Had great experience at their location in Florida so surprised about this experience."], ["John S.", "Deviled eggs are on point. Chicken lettuce wraps are the best in town. The gigantic beer selection is amazing too. All of that happened before the entree. The spicy jambalaya and the orange chicken is what made this 5 stars.

All the descriptions sounded awesome, but the taste was a 2 or a 3. \u00a0Our server was not knowledgable (couldn't answer any of our menu questions) and he put in our appetizer & entree orders at the same time, so everything came out together....which means all of it ended up cold before we could eat it. We both ate about 2/3 of things & called it quits. Not worth it cold.They do have a great beer selection, which is what pushed this review from a 2 to a 3.

Despite this, the service was excellent for a SLOW night for a well-established joint, let alone one that was absolutely slammed and opened less than two weeks ago!Our table was repeatedly bused, checked on by multiple different servers (including our primary one), we were once given a wrong beer and it was promptly pulled off the tab and the correct one brought in its stead. Some idiot who wasn't paying close enough attention while over-gesticulating during a story (i.e. me) bumped a glass of water off the table; within ~30 seconds there was someone with a yellow sign cleaning it up and advising passing patrons to watch their step.This place is a BIG step up from somewhere like Kilroy's or Scotty's, hopefully this serves to spur them from their dogmatic slumber.

When our waitress returned we placed our order. There are some different pictures scattered around on the wall of castles that I assume are in Ireland and or Scotland. CNN was on the TV (I think) but there was no sound. Our food came out pretty quickly. Everything had good flavor and worked well together. I had their version of a shepherds pie and was surprised that everything was separated out...so I mixed everything together. It was tasty and I am happy that I went with it.At the end of the meal we did have to wait a little longer than I felt I needed to because she was standing at the bar area with several other employees having a chat. I am not sure about what as I assume most of them had just arrived.Overall it was a great meal and the service matched the price paid for the meal.

The service, (Julie!!) was also excellent, like really excellent. She was funny and had patience with all our questions.

It was just ok. The fries are the biggest reason I didn't do 4 stars. My friend and I both agreed they were fairly tasteless and would be better if they were a bit softer. Just our opinion.

Normally I would suggest saving room... but I think even if you were stuffed... once you taste this, it will not matter.So great vegan and vegetarian options. \u00a0Great selection of beers and scotches. \u00a0Great service. \u00a0Good ambiance. \u00a0Three thumbs up from me."], ["Jimmy M.", "My wife and I stopped in on a Sunday afternoon before a concert downtown.

My wife had a veggie club that she said was \"nothing to write home about\" but she finished it and was satisfied enough to get her by.The real highlight of the meal was the bread pudding. This stuff was delicious.

But the awkward thing was I saw that he delivered drinks to another table that came in after us and was talking to them before ever taking our drink order, they might have been regulars or something but whatever, was just a bit awkward. He must have known I saw this because he then apologized like 100 times for our wait. Everything else from there was smooth so it was easy to get over. We decided to just get a couple of appetizers and share. We got the scotch eggs and potato skins. The food came very fast, yay! The scotch eggs are amazing and I love the sauce that comes with it! Highly recommend! Potato skins were pretty good, I liked that the edges were crispy but some parts the potato was really thick and I am never a fan of that [this is not uncommon with potato skins].

I like that they offer a rotating variety of \"visiting\" draughts from other local establishments. I love the giant open garage door style windows. Any drinking establishment that allows you to \"feel\" outside without the pain and horror of actually trying to cultivate your buzz outdoors, in the open, vulnerable to birds and friendly dogs and other wandering riff raff, \u00a0is top notch in my book. Just post up on the bar facing outwards, and it's all the glory of fresh air while still in the protected confines of the dark pub. You can even yell out to passers by, if you're that guy.

It's a nice variety of fitting in with the Scottish pub theme while still supporting all the great local breweries around, all priced about how you'd expect.I've also always experienced really great service here - consistently very friendly and checking in the right amount.

The haggis sampler is OK - it was kind of just a cup of salty tasting ground beef with some bread and mashed potatoes, I wouldn't recommend, but I've not had haggis before. The scotch eggs - how can you go wrong!? Eggs surrounded in yummy meat? Good stuff! Finally, the angus burger is delicious. You'll not have another burger like it anywhere - they pound it into a huge thin patty - it has a great taste. You have to try it! If you like beer - they also have insane variety! Go on a weeknight when it's not so busy and sit at the open window seats out front, really enjoyable to people watch!"], ["Kate D.", "Come here for the beer! The \u00a0beer and food here are fabulous. I can't believe I lived in Indy for 8 months and no one told us to come here! One of the best if not the best beer list on Mass Ave. Not a huge selection but a solid variety of types and styles. Which to me is more important. The food may not be fancy but its darn good pub food. Which honestly I like a little greasy when I go out for pub food an beer with friends. Their scotch eggs are great. And their specials have been pretty good when we get them. We have had good service here when we have been. But I can see what people mean, we have had problems with the hostesses actually. Although many places we go in town we don't expect good service, it rare to find personally. I think it's important I busy areas like mass ave to treat it like Europe and be there to relax and enjoy your time with others."], ["Tom C.", "Nice downtown pub and restaurant. \u00a0Solid variety of beer on draught and great menu. \u00a0 Long waits for tables on weekends, but great service once you're in.

The vegetarian haggis (they have the traditional Scottish version too for all you meat lovers out there) is aaaaa-mazing! Like wow. My friend and I popped in after doing Mass Ave's Scavnge the Ave and I was really stoked to finally try this joint out. The atmosphere is good, I loved the window seats. The food and beer selection is heavenly, the downside, the service was only so so. It wasn't awful but it wasn't great. A little more attention from our waiter would have gone a long way. That wouldn't deter me from going back though. I want to try their vegetarian chili next!"], ["Todd B.", "Been eyeing this place for a while, but I don't get to Downtown often and it's hard not to go to the Rathskeller when I do. But alas, I was finally able to give MacNiven's a go.Beer list was pretty good to start. But nearly everything available was an American IPA, and they seemed to have just as many German beers as Scottish. Nonetheless, the beer was good, and they do have some good Scottish selections. The prices weren't good, but hey, welcome to Mass Ave.Regarding the food, my party and I ordered and shared the following:Scotch eggBeef MacHattanSausage roll w/ beans and chipsBeer battered chicken breast sandwich w/ aioliHaggis, neeps, and tattiesThe Scotch egg was fantastic - none of that crumbly, dry sausage crust you see at a lot of places, but thick, meaty sausage. The aioli dip wasn't my favorite (good, but too much mayonnaise), and I'd sure like to get more than a single egg for $7.50, but it was still quite good.Beef MacHattan and sausage roll were above average, but nothing to jump up and down about.The chicken sandwich (or at least the chicken on it) was good, with some pretty swanky \u00a0breading, and paired with the aioli better than the Scotch egg did.The haggis, etc.? Excellent. It's not stuffed in a sheep's bladder/stomach nor is it in sausage casing, and it's nothing fancy, but it is hearty (get it?) and delicious. The tatties weren't up to snuff to an Irishman like me, but they weren't bad; the neeps were a notch better. The whole dish was VERY filling, too. Only real gripe is that they don't incorporate kidneys or lungs, and the heart and liver meat is cut with pork.Overall, I enjoyed myself and came away sleepy with an overcrowded gut full of ale, starch, and sheep's organs (just the way a person should walk away from a Scottish pub). So in short, MacNiven's is a great stop for some hearty grub and a beer or two."], ["Petie D.", "No wait to be seated. \u00a0The perfect amount of guests. \u00a0Great drinks, great service, great fish and chips and chicken tenders. Best potato skins we've ever had, TVs on the baseball and us open. \u00a0 Excellent!"], ["Alex W.", "One of my best friends & I strolled in for a random early Friday happy hour of our own. We were quickly helped with choosing drinks for the first round & Scotch Eggs to nosh on (so delish!!!) I honestly can't say anything negative about our visit since I found good conversation with my friend and the bartender Max and a new-found appreciation for Imperial Stout beers. Max let us sample a few brews to get a feel for what we liked & made great suggestions. Can't go wrong with a local bar that highly encourages one to drink local!"], ["Brittany S.", "Love this place. Interesting Scottish American food. Always has a great beer list with constantly rotating taps and specials. Very decent scotch whiskey menu as well."], ["Karen G.", "I was staying in the Mass Ave district last Sunday night and popped into MacNivan's after a 5 pm show. Scottish food isn't my favorite, and we weren't all that hungry, so we ordered dessert instead of dinner. We split the bread pudding with ice cream. The bread pudding was good, not great (since it is based in a mini loaf pan it was all edges...not as moist as a center piece). But the ice cream that came with it was great. It had these crispy nuggets that tasted like toffee that just made everything wonderful.We got great service...granted the place was pretty empty on a Sunday night so service might not be quite so fast on a busy night. I love the decor too. If I lived in Indy, I'm sure I would spend more time here."], ["Leslie G.", "Bread pudding is masssssive! Share with a group of 4. Love it.

I also loved that their were so many vegetarian options! \u00a0I had the cheesy beans on toast and they were more amazing then I expected! \u00a0I also had a delicious and huge onion ring and a taste of the veggie haggis. The veggies haggis was good and tasted a bit like Chinese five spice or curry. I loved that you could buy a taste for $.50! \u00a0My husband had the roast beef and said it was also very good! \u00a0 We plan on returning! Our server was nice but maybe too busy. We got our food and drinks in a timely manner but one out of the three tables we sat buy seemed to have a slightly longer wait."], ["Kirby M.", "Not a fan. Not a fan of the service. Not a fan of the food. The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is due to the large beer selection. The food was bland and tasteless.

Definitely a great atmosphere and nice staff. I had the french dip and it was decent. The burgers are a little crazy looking, but good!"], ["Trista R.", "Amazing staff. Great beer. Interesting food.

A+ experience overall!"], ["John N.", "I am full on allergic to wheat and this place carried Udi's rolls for their awesome burgers along with having a gluten free menu. Great staff who were happy to help along with super fast service and a range of ciders.. Been using yelp for 7 years and this is the first place I felt the need to write a review for. Great job guys- you rock!!!"], ["Dylan E.", "Mass Ave provides quite a few places for beer lovers to go grab a great microbrew on draft. While MacNiven's certainly puts itself towards the top of the list in that category, I don't think it has much competition when it comes to a combination of craft beer and food. The menu is focused on Scottish style food, and offers all of the usual items you'd expect to find on a Scottish themed menu. If you're feeling good about the previous month's workout routine, I'd suggest rewarding yourself with an order of the scotch eggs. They may cut a few years off the back end of your lifespan, but it'll be worth it. The beef stew is a great dish to order in the winter to really warm you up, and you can never go wrong with the fish and chips. If you want to try something a little different, the haggis is surprisingly good relative to how its ingredients sound, and I would order neeps as a side over potatoes any day of the week. I'd guess they have about 15 or so beers on their always changing draft list, and they keep plenty of local selections on tap. Their bottled beer list is where you can really find some interesting selections in a broad range of styles of beer, and it is certainly worth a look to find something new every time you visit. While I can't say I frequent it, their scotch menu boasts an extensive list as well, and I've heard plenty of praise from friends who know much more about it than me.As far as the atmosphere goes, it's definitely a place that is more of a sit down restaurant than a bar. Until pretty late in the evening, it's easy to find a table and enjoy some food and beer in a quieter setting than most of the places around it. Even late on a weekend night when the bar is getting kind of full, it's still possible to grab a table and it remains a quieter place where you can have an actual conversation. The service is above average, and the bartenders work hard to take care of everybody quickly while still managing to be friendly and have a conversation with their patrons.When is Yelp going to get it together and start offering 1/2 star ratings so I can give this place 4.5?"], ["Kenneth S.", "For a great beer (one of the best selections in Indy) and a spot to sit, it's one of the best. Food-wise, it's okay. I'm definitely a fan of the roast beef MacHattan."], ["Toby B.", "I really like this place. \u00a0The atmosphere is cool especially when they have the front windows open. \u00a0Great beer selection and I have had good service every time I've gone in.It's hard for me to complain when they try to have a decent vegetarian and vegan choices. \u00a0I like the veggie chili, my girlfriend LOVES it. \u00a0I like the vegetarian haggis quite a lot too. \u00a0However, 4-stars, because haggis and is like the only thing I get there and it's $14. \u00a0A huge! meal. \u00a0Unless I get some chili which is another nice option. \u00a0I'm sorta used to being able to only 1 or 2 things on a menu. \u00a0It feels like when I visit MacNiven's, it's either a huge meal, or a light snack, not much in-between and not much variety for vegetarians. \u00a0 Such a great start to having some vegetarian (not vegan) friendly dishes but I wish there was more of a selection. \u00a0I would go here way more often. \u00a0Every time I'm in, I mention they should have a vegetarian version of Roast Beef Manhattan. \u00a0It wouldn't be that hard and would be amazing. \u00a0A vegan version of their mashed potatoes would be a nice touch too, if they were really trying to cater to the Vegetarian/Vegan community."], ["T B.", "Lots of vegetarian options which was a pleasant surprise esp for a Scottish restaurant. Food was solid but not memorable. Onion rings were the highlight only got two in an order but they giant and awesome. Great beer selection and service."], ["Laura M.", "I've never gotten the Scotch Eggs but I still give MacNiven's a solid 4 stars. It's a Mass Ave favorite with food on par with Chatham Tap or Bazbeaux's. The french dip is my go-to but the burger and anything with neeps (parsnips?) are both excellent as well. Onion soup and a high top table for people watching make for a perfect winter evening.A review of MacNiven's wouldn't be complete without mentioning the beers selection, which is consistently impressive. They do a great job of showcasing Indy's local talent, which I really appreciate. They also have Irn Bru, which combines the taste of orange soda with the caffeine content of Mountain Dew. Woo hoo!Also included on their drinks menu is the aptly named Fun in a Can, champagne that does exactly what it says on the label. Awesome."], ["Richard H.", "Popular place on Mass Ave, pretty nice beer list, decent if unexceptional food. Frankly, I forget it's there most of the time."], ["Danny B.", "I agree with Kate D, great beer selection. Great atmosphere as well and I was impressed that they actually had vegetarian and vegan options. Neither of the haggis (haggi?) are made in-house, but I guess the person who makes it is local. That makes it a bit more appealing than if it were a mass-produced store-bought product."], ["Nate M.", "All things considered, Macniven's is one of the best local watering holes on Mass Ave. \u00a0If you're into great beer and/or Whiskey this is the place for you. \u00a0They always have a great selection of beer, with several rotating taps to keep you coming back. \u00a0Their tried and true's are nothing to scoff at either.In reality though, part of what keeps me coming back is the people. \u00a0The bar staff is the best in the city. \u00a0Patrick and Max hold it down behind the bar and always greet you with a smile and usually a friendly jab. \u00a0Keep up the great work guys.The friendly service compliments the only true pub-feel bar on Mass ave (that you can fit into - no offense chatham, I love you too). \u00a0If you're looking for a place to enjoy good beer and a good conversation, stop off for a pint on your walk down Mass Ave.Only room for improvement in my book is the food. \u00a0Some good options, nothing bad, just doesn't wow me like other places in the area which is why I usually stop by Macniven's for the suds and conversation. \u00a0A couple more healthy options would be greatly appreciated and probably cause me to make it a dinner destination more often."], ["Tara F.", "This place is cozy and by all means Scottish...as in they serve the traditional haggis, as well as a vegetarian option.

I know portions are going to be smaller than normal and they're likely to be more busy than they're used to. I've had very positive experiences in the past that have led to discovering a few of my favorite restaurants. That being said, most of my complaints are about the service, and the restaurant was only at most 2/3 full when we went. We were seated immediately, and were given water. After that is where my service complaints begin. The waitress took our order, but had to come back and retake it after appetizers. There were 3 different times during the meal when staff tried to bring incorrect food to either our table or the table next to us. I'm not sure if someone was putting in incorrect table numbers or if the staff simply don't know the seating system. We received our entrees, which were pretty good. I must say that the mussels and fries were delicious. We ran out of water about half way through our entrees. We finished our entrees (still no water) and sat for about 15 minutes before anyone came to check on us and give us refills. I noticed that several other tables around us also had empty glasses. I will add that I finished my glass of wine during the appetizer and would have ordered another if I had ever been asked. So after sitting about 15 minutes after our entrees, be had to sit for another 10-15 before our desserts came out. We did get our check quickly, which was nice.Overall, the food was really pretty good, which made me sad that service was annoying. We will probably try again later, just because we both love crepes, and we want to try some of theirs.

Much to my chagrin, it only contained one measly piece of sausage in the center, as opposed to being throughout the sandwich.Overall, I would like to give this one-star operation, a fitting score, but they get two because of the the fries. \u00a0The entire first experience was rife with annoyances and was not one to remember."], ["Brittany S.", "Crow-pee-shawn \u00a0(Come on, Indy, don't \"play dumb\" on this one)The boyfriend and I decided to get crafty with our date plans and planned a progressive dinner to experience three new-to-us businesses in one evening.

Holy cow, you guys, you must try the custardy dessert topped with caramel (I would add the name here but they don't have a website/online menu?) - our waitress described it as cr\u00e8me brulee with a Werther's Original-like caramel topping. I'm having dreams about this dessert - it was that good. Must return soon...

The restaurant is a quaint little place right on the edge of Mass Ave with a classic red and black theme that probably caters more to what Americans think of France, but is 100% adorable. There is a small bar to get wine, beer, cocktails, or coffee, and several small tables with a tiny lounge area next to a fireplace. And, true to French restaurant life, you get a fleeting glimpse of what's going on in the kitchen. They have an excellent wine selection as well as some cider and champagne. Highly recommend the \"Mimi\" with your galettes! About those galettes...mon dieu. Perfection. They are buckwheat crepes with savory ingredients inside. So, they are naturally gluten-free, and they have a few vegetarian options. I had the galette complete--a classic with ham, Gruyere, and egg. It tasted just like I remember when I lived in Nantes. My friend got the mushroom and cheese galette that has an amazing buttery texture. Couldn't ask for more. As for dessert, how could I not go for the classic buerre sucre crepe? Just butter and sugar, and it was perfect. No exaggerating. We also had a raspberry and lemon crepe at the table with a great balance of flavors. The lemon wasn't overpowering or too sweet. It was just right. And what can I say about the service? Everyone, and I mean everyone, was so nice and helpful. Shout out to Matt, our server, who was just as excited as we were about the food. The manager, Nicola, came by to tell us a bit about the restaurant and the food and seasonal menus that are coming up and took the time to let us know the hours. Obviously she could tell we will be regulars. And I even got to meet the owner and spout off some French with her. It was an enchanting dining experience, and I can't wait to go back for more.

So I wasn't too impressed with the food, but it was pretty good and I wouldn't mind trying a different crepe flavor another time.However, our waiter was terrible. He was very standoffish and acted like he really didn't want to be there or take our order. The place wasn't even busy (there were two other tables besides mine). He got two of our orders wrong (I ordered a triple crepe and my friend a double). When we asked him about it, he said we never said anything about wanting a double or triple.

My end of the table had to send ours back because items were added/omitted from our final checks. This is why I'm knocking off one star.Anyway, on to the food. I ordered a kir royal, which is champagne with raspberry syrup and often found in bars in France. Let me be clear: French syrups and American syrups are very different. This isn't like Hershey's or something. They're more like Sage's Simple Syrups if you're a local familiar with them. Mine had a wee raspberry in it. Cute.For my dinner, I ordered the Gallette au magret du canard (duck filet crepe) with ratatouille and greens, and it was absolutely phenomenal, the duck was tender, and it really did remind me of something from France.Of course, we all had to indulge in a nice dessert while there. I originally wanted their Cafe Gourmand, which is their dessert sampler with your choice of tea, coffee, or hot chocolate, which was the only dessert they didn't have that evening. I decided to go for the Tarte Bourdaloue, which is a pear tart, and of course it was great as well.I will most certainly be coming back, but probably not with a huge group like this last time. I'll probably end up bumping this up to five stars after more visits."], ["Tiffany B.", "Lovely staff, owner, decor, food and experience. Ran in late on a Sunday night for a quick bite and very much enjoyed the savory crepe (they have another name for it, but I forget), and the side of super thick bacon. The sweet crepe w/ chocolate and raspberry disappeared in a flash--beautifully made. How wonderful to have this sweet place adding to the color and flavor of Mass Ave. Looking forward to going back for lunch sometime."], ["Joanna S.", "Soooooo cute. And really tasty. Loved the cheese board with crostini. Also got a hazelnut crepe and it was simple percection. I was feeling the Parisian vibe and ordered sparkling pear wine as well - Delish!Went with a gluten free friend and her food looked awesome as well, although they don't offer gluten free dessert foods, only savory ones. Felt bad for her, but personally I can't wait to go back!"], ["Sunah K.", "I've been waiting months for this place to open and I can't wait to try more on the menu. \u00a0So far just a quick lunch during opening week. I didn't even know they had dinner entrees! Will definitely be back. And I can bring the kids.The savory Galette Forestiere with mushrooms and creme fraiche was wonderful. \u00a0The buckwheat crepe was lightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. \u00a0The warm side salad had a nice vinaigrette. The desserts and French cocktails sound amazing! Prices are not badThe space is bigger than I thought it would be. \u00a0I'd never been to the Complexions Salon it used to be. \u00a0The black, white and red decor is kinda stereotypical generic French but it keeps the place from seeming snooty or too formal. The servers are definitely not French, but again, keeps things feeling more casual. Everyone was super nice. \u00a0And I'll even forgive the misspellings on the menu since it looks like it's been corrected..."], ["Stacy P.", "Cropichon et Bidibule is just the latest restaurant to hit the Indy scene that thankfully offers a true gluten free option that not only takes the ingredients, but the cooking ware into consideration.From the decor to the menu, this French restaurant tries to bring a little bit of Paris to the Midwest. The menu offers a nice selection of what one might expect to find when entering a street cafe.It is nice to see a naturally gluten free option on the menu in the form of the galettes, which is made of buckwheat flour. Through the use of a separate crepe billig to cook the galette on, the food remains GF. While there are only more savory options listed under the Galett heading on the menu, they were able to make sweet options as well.If your looking for a sweet and savory dining option, the la palette complete and a Nutella galette are the way to go."], ["Valencia W.", "I'm not one to give 5 stars, but when my boyfriend and I discovered that we'd gotten the time of a comedy show wrong, we found this beautiful little place to pass the time. We only had a half hour, which we informed the staff, and they promptly seated us and took our order. While we waited for the food, I fell in love with the decor of the place. It's lovely, with mirrors and little things that just make the place unique. I loved the wine glass chandeliers and simple but eclectic design. The food arrived quickly and both my boyfriend and I dug in. Now my boyfriend is about the pickiest eater I've ever met, but he loved his food and I loved mine. We finished and made it to the show. We've been back some times since and the owner always comes to greet us. I love that they check in! They seem to actually care about their customers. Of course it's still a fairly new business so there's some bugs that need to be sorted, but I've had a marvelous time every time I've gone. I highly recommend. I do advise that you're patient, as you never know what's going on in the background. I went today and was a little displeased with our waiter only to discover he was brand new and therefor still learning the ropes. Makes a big difference knowing that piece of information."], ["Matt B.", "Great addition to the Mass Ave \u00a0district. Had French onion soup and chicken with Boursin. Food was outstanding. Wait staff great."], ["Jim B.", "Finally made it to this new restaurant early last week (assuming it's crowded on weekends) and impressed by the staff in helping decide what menu options would work for me. \u00a0Food was delicious and surprisingly filling for a main course dinner entry. \u00a0Dessert was obviously terrific since can't beat a crepe and chocolate for dessert! Believe the menu has been updated from their original opening so if you haven't been back since opening date would highly recommend checking it out again. Definitely another great option added to Mass Avenue since serves something a bit different from any other restaurant in the area. Side note: The evening was there two separate groups of doctors at the restaurant."], ["Jessica P.", "This is a very charming restaurant with very tasty food. The owner even stopped by our table to welcome us. We visited during Devour and were treated to a wonderful menu. The prix fixe even included wine. Everything was delicious. I enjoyed the stuffed quail as my main course. yum. Such a delicious dish with risotto and . The dessert options of chocolate mousse and vanilla creme were both outstanding, go with someone so you can try each!! The outdoor bar looks like some excellent evening people watching space, too."], ["Jasmine N.", "We were greeted right away. Ordered dessert and had great recommendations my the host and server. Order the dessert sampler called Dessert Gormand.The food and service were both very enjoyable. Will return."], ["Tommy R.", "OMG - AMAZING! I just recently noticed this new restaurant on Mass Ave and went there with my daughter. We had the half & half cheese plate and each ordered the salmon crepe. The flavors were terrific. The cheese board was the best I've had in Indy. \u00a0The buckwheat savory crepes had a mild flavor that developed more with each bite. The owner, Stephan, makes a point to visit every table. His French accent is fun, and his passion for the restaurant is beautiful.We liked the meal so much, we went again the next night, this time with my wife. Again, beautiful food, great service, great conversation with Stephan, and this time- DESSERT! The dessert crepes are well balanced, and not too sweet. You just can't go wrong here. We'll be back and hope this place is here to stay!!"], ["Mike F.", "I was so excited to try this place and it turned out to be a huge let down: I had a friend in town, she wanted to try \"the new French place\" and I was excited because I had received a business card w a personal message in the mail and heard the ownership had ties to France somehow (can't recall the specifics). Awesome! More culture in Indy. Walked in to a sign that said \"please wait to be seated\" - waited for a solid 2 minutes at the host stand with no one walking by and then walked around the corner to see a member of the staff texting behind the bar. Ordered wine and an app to start, waited what felt like 10 minutes for the waitress to come back telling me she couldn't find the bottle we ordered, and then didn't have a recommendation when we asked for alternatives (let alone an apology). The wine wasn't great. Oh well. After receiving the food and trying several different items we ordered to share, I knew this was a mistake. Whoever the chef was clearly didn't care about the product they were putting out. We felt so bad for having the experience we had, we felt compelled to tell the owner who we found out wasn't there. After getting the bill and paying, the waitress spilled hot sauce on my friends tan top. She brought over club soda which was helpful, but I honestly felt like 9 out of 10 places on Mass Ave would have comped something or offered a free dessert - something! This was the 10th place. We couldn't get out fast enough. It honestly gave me anxiety. I hope others have a better experience and ALSO hope the ownership knows their staff is seriously underwhelming."], ["Sigrid F.", "Came across this gem purely by accident and decided to check it out. Great decision.The interior is modern functional and what a French bistro should look like.We worked our way through the menu, slowly but surely. we started of with Sparkling Mineral water, the Parisian cocktail and the baguette with butter. That alone was delicious... I think I could have eaten a whole loaf of this bread.Then we indulged in the onion soup, I mean how could you not go for it, since this is a French place. The soup was delicately flavored, the croutons crunchy and buttery. It was a bit more dry than the inon soups you can generally find in this country and also not drowned in gobs of melted cheese, more like a hint of quite flavorful cheese. We tried both the meat and the cheese plate and were amazed by both.I went on to try the crepes with sugar and butter while my friend enjoyed the duck medalions. We were impressed by both dishes.We topped off the evening with the chocolate ganache cake, which was seved still warm out the oven and filled with ganache which spilled out once the cake was pierced. We also had the chocolate mouse with fresh berries and Chantilly cream... OMG... served in a glass container with lid... so rich, so chocolatey, so decadent one simply has to lick the dish to get every last trace of this....I am not French, but I am from Europe and I deem the food served here quite authentic and a definite 'must try' for all...I wanted to add, that while their menu seems rather limited, it does have choices for all tastes and budgets available. And our waitress Camille was a gem, friendly and attentive."], ["Sabrina S.", "I ate at Cropichon et Bidibule during their opening weekend. They weren't very busy, and it seemed like more of a soft opening. It's really cute inside. I love the way it is decorated.We arrived a little late, and some of the people in our party had already started off with cheese plates. I really like funky cheese, but many of the cheeses presented were just too ripe. I'd tasted many of the cheeses, and know what they should taste like, and these were just too far past their prime.The entrees were taking a very long time, so the waitress brought out more meat and cheese plates. This was a nice gesture. The service is very friendly, and the slowness for the entrees didn't bother me.My husband and I weren't crazy about the galettes. I had the mushroom and cream galette with bacon, and my husband had a galette that had duck and mirepoix vegetables. My dish was bland, but the side of potatoes did help it a little. My husband's dish was not well incorporated. Nothing seemed to really go together, and it was dry. It probably could have benefited from some sort of sauce. Pricing for beer was high ($7-$8 per beer for just local varieties). I wouldn't mind trying it again, and if I do I will try a traditional dish that is not a crepe or galette, and will skip on beer."], ["Amanda D.", "I was really impressed with Cropichon et Bidibule (or CB). The food was delicious, the vibe was unique and the staff was incredibly kind and on their game. This restaurant (or bistro as they like to say) makes French food accessible. It's not stuffy and the prices are reasonable (many meals in the $8-$15 range). I actually felt completely transported when I was dining there - like I wasn't even in Indianapolis on Mass Ave!Perhaps my two favorite things about CB: 1. They take reservations!!! (triple exclamation points for this). Many of our top local restaurants do not take reservations, which makes it very difficult when trying to plan a function with friends or family. 2.They offer vegetarian and gluten-free options. I love that the galettes are made with buckwheat flour (gluten-free) that's imported from France! I had the La Galette Saumon - a galette topped with smoked salmon and leeks. So tasty and very filling.The owners are the real deal! They recently moved here from France. They worked with the chefs for several months training them on official crepe making. Love to be able to try authentic France food right in Indy! Check out my blog on this new restaurant: blog.downtownindy.org/ma\u2026"], ["Lara P.", "My visit was one week after opening. My experience was fine, but not impressive. The decor is a bit tacky, think \"A Night in Paris\" prom theme. The bistro chairs are also uncomfortable and despite the restaurant being new, our table was wobbly! Our server was kind and attentive- no complaints there. I ordered the onion soup and the galette with ham, gruyere, & sunny egg. The food was all tasty, just a bit plain/ simple. The parts of my galette that the egg yolk didn't cover were a bit dry (with only ham and cheese) and I found myself longing for some type of sauce to make it more palatable. \u00a0I prefer the ambiance and crepes at Brugge in Broad Ripple. We didn't save room for a dessert crepe, so I'll probably pay another visit to try one of those. Overall, the restaurant bar is set pretty high downtown and on Mass Ave...and I don't think Cropichon et Bidibule impresses like other eateries in the area."], ["Susan S.", "The restaurant has potential. Potential is not enough in some cases. Having visited Paris a few times this bistrot is not far off from the experience. Customer service that is not so hot. A server who sat down and took our order then neglected to even ask what we wanted to drink. We were the only patrons in the restaurant. It took 10 minutes to get a glass of wine to which I had to ask for the wine menu back after the server had taken our order. The server was a nice person but could not be bothered to take care of our table. It would be great if they marketed themselves as the french Ed Debevics. But they are not. Having been to Paris as many times over the years go to Three Days in Paris to have crepes. They are at the City Market. Oh yeah...I forgot. The menu states we can have a crepe either folded or open face. We were told they would be served open farce and we would not have a choice. One visit and I am over this place."], ["Cheryl C.", "Another place for crepes in downtown Indianapolis? \u00a0Yes, please! \u00a0My daughter and I were excited to try C et B, and visited on a recent Saturday evening. \u00a0We found the ambiance to be a little contrived, so we were wondering if the food would be a disappointment. \u00a0Not at all! \u00a0We each enjoyed a gallette (savory crepe), served with a side of nicely dressed salad greens, and I washed it down with a glass of white wine. \u00a0Hers was filled with mushrooms and creme fraiche, and she enjoyed the earthiness of the mushrooms with the creaminess of the melted sauce. \u00a0Mine was filled with leeks, which had been cooked until they sweetened and a generous portion of smoked salmon. \u00a0We were delighted! \u00a0We are looking forward to sampling the steak frites, and the desserts on a return trip."], ["Amy S.", "Honestly just a big disappointment service wise. \u00a0Didn't even refill water or offer the basic condiments like salt and pepper during lunch time when only six tables were occupied. \u00a0Would have loved to have iced tea with my lunch but server never returned once galettes were served. \u00a0Food was good, but based on service doubtful I will return."], ["Joe L.", "Brand new. \u00a0 The dessert (chocolate cake with a ganache instde) was heavenly :) \u00a0Warm out of the oven, the ganache pored out in a rich chocoloate flood.One page menu, with a focus on crepes and galettes. \u00a0I had the duck which was cooked and seasoned perfectly. \u00a0 The cheese and meat sampler plates had a great variety of tastes.Recommended"], ["Jerry W.", "This is quickly becoming one of my favorite new restaurants. I've only eaten here twice, but so far the staff have been some of the friendliest and most helpful servers and hostesses I've ever met. And the food is fantastic.On my first visit I had the gruyere onion soup. It was an elevated version of French onion, featuring gruyere instead the mozzarella. I really don't like melted mozzarella. It's thick and gummy and hard to swallow. It's also flavorless. If cheeses were retail stores, mozzarella would be Kmart. Gruyere would be more like Saks Fifth Avenue. Next I had the smoked salmon galette. It was made with creme fraiche. The crepe pastry was airy and awesome. I finished with a Nutella crepe for dessert. I love Nutella crepes and have had them at three different locations in Indy. Cropichon's was very similar to those at Brugge or Three Days in Paris.On my second visit I had the 3-cheese Friand. It looks similar to a square toaster pastry - the kind with a flaky crust, not Pop Tarts - but it was filled with soft cheeses. It was luscious and tasty. It didn't look like it would fill me up but it almost did. I finished with an apple and caramel crepe that was quite delicious.My servers were Camille the first time and Eva the second time. They were awesome! Thank you ladies for making my visit very pleasant! I will be back - 5 stars!"], ["Tracy A.", "I am aghast! \u00a0I have been anxious to try Cropichon since the moment it opened. \u00a0The reviews and pictures have been great! \u00a0Between my wait to finally go and seeing the good reviews, my hope has been floating in and around me like an over-inflated balloon. \u00a0By the time we finished, I was completely deflated. \u00a0The positives:1. \u00a0The decor is adorable. \u00a0Paris in the Springtime was playing in my head radio the whole time I was there.2. \u00a0The bread was good.3. \u00a0The Mixed Slate with 3 meats and 3 cheese was very well presented and delicious.The negatives:1. \u00a0When we came in (a Sunday evening) there was one waiter. \u00a0He was courteous to us, but he seemed in the weeds. \u00a0It came through in the service which was very stressed, rushed, and at times, resulted in him walking away as I was asking for something and him not hearing me. \u00a0He informed us up front in almost a tirade that although the restaurant is French, he didn't speak it, so don't ask him about anything in French. \u00a0Ok! 2. \u00a0Some of us ordered Coke. \u00a0When we tasted it, we all agreed it was flat, didn't have any carbonation, and something was off. \u00a0When I told him, we were informed it was two-liter poured over ice because their system was down. \u00a0Would have appreciated being warned about that because it was nasty. \u00a0He did remove it from our check.3. \u00a0As we entered, on the sidewalk outside, there was a grease board with some specials on it. \u00a0When we inquired about those, our server informed us those were lunch specials and not available. \u00a0Why was the board still out there at 6:00 p.m.?4. \u00a0Some of the desserts mentioned in the other Yelp reviews were not available. \u00a0We ordered the lemon cream with raspberry coulis which had a nice flavor, but the crepe was very spongy.5. \u00a0I listed the Mixed Slate as a positive, but I also feel that I've had better boards at better places. \u00a0Also, even though you get 3 meats and 3 cheese, what you get is Chef's choice. \u00a0I can live with that but would prefer to have an option to choose my own.We have already stated that we will go back and try the larger entree menu at some time. \u00a0With all of the good reviews, I am hoping our experience was just an off day for Cropichon."], ["Emily M.", "Thought this was a very cute restaurant with wonderful food! The cheese and meat plate was excellent and the duck galette was fantastic. The owner came to our table to check on our experience, which was a nice touch. My criticisms would be that our server was slow and though we were there for a long time, rarely checked on us - we'd have had several more (alcoholic) drinks if he had."], ["Rob S.", "Excellent place to have a crepe. Bar area was nice and cozy. Very European cafe like. Great selection of wine and a variety of tap beers. \u00a0Can't wait to come back and have the banana and Nutella crepe."], ["Damie A.", "I want to love this place more than I do. The decor is very fun, and reminiscent of Paris. The galettes I will say are awesome. I was a bit underwhelmed by the charcuterie platter, and the dessert sampler was not bad, but for some reason I expected more... And have had much better french bistro cuisine (although not here in Indy). With that said my husband raved about everything we had there, so I have not 4 stars instead of 3. The service is OK. They try, but there were a few misunderstandings."], ["Vanessa E.", "Just stopped in for a late birthday lunch. I would come back just for the amazing service from Ayla!

She claims she will eat this every time she comes back! It was lovely!"], ["Tony F.", "Disappointing \u00a0to say the least. Pluses were the bread and the cheese plate. Worst French onion soup i have ever had (hot water with cheese and bread) two orders made (one for a beer and one for an entree) that after a delay were reported out. We ordered everything up front and were not informed of the no luck entree until after the cheese plate was cleared.

Merci beaucoup!"], ["Kristin H.", "Let me start by saying that I am very open to this two star rating changing. In fact, I want it to change! I am hoping in 3-6 months the owners will listen to feedback and consider making some changes. I feel, right now, as if it's run by people who found a niche in a small market, not people who understand the restaurant business and can consistently serve delicious food. My first experience was attempting to visit at 1pm on a Sunday. The door was open and there were a group of people at the front desk, but upon opening the door, one woman rather stiffly let us know they were not open until 2. This feels like a rookie mistake on Mass Ave. This is where the brunch crowd goes! We walked down to Mesh and even though it was packed, we were seated right away and had, as always, an amazing meal. \u00a0My second visit was lunch during the week with a friend. We like to take long lunches about once a month and linger and catch up. This seemed like a great place to do it. For the most part, it was fine. In a nutshell: \u00a0the server was over attentive and talkative and the food was just ok - nothing special with a few spectacular failures. Nothing was fatal, necessarily, just wasn't what I expected. I love French food. I went to Paris for ten days with a well plotted out schedule of where to get \"the best of...\" and ate my way through ten days of deliciousness. I lived in NYC for ten years and five of our top ten favs there are French restaurants. I was very excited for this place to open since we've only been here 1.5 years and I've been missing great French food. To start, we ordered the cheese plate. The tomato jam was amazing. Really stellar. We were informed it is made in house. The goat cheese was a great pairing with it. The gruyere and brie felt like what I have in my fridge at home and picked up at Trader Joe's. The roquefort was good but then there was the munster. Our server warned us it was \"strong\". My friend (an adventurous eater) was barely able to swallow it he found it so off putting. Our server then let us know that she also hates it and thinks it tastes terrible. \u00a0My suggestion is the restaurant let the patrons choose the cheeses they want on a plate. A cheese that is such an acquired taste might be better left to choice. I ordered the onion soup with no crouton (wheat allergy). I order onion soup everywhere I go. It is one of my very favorite things in the world. The flavor to this broth was nice but it desperately DESPERATELY needed salt. \u00a0The broth was a tish oily (but that felt rustic, so I don't knock them for that) and I quite enjoyed it after I added enough salt to allow the other flavors to pop. Once it had enough salt I was able to get the richness, the nice sweetness of the onions, and the pepper.We both ordered galettes for our main. This was a huge disappointment to me. I remember so clearly ordering crepes in Paris that were bursting full of flavorful ham and gruyere. This \"complete\" galette was thin on ingredients and again tasted like nothing had salt and pepper. The egg was cooked perfectly but no salt at all. The cheese and ham were very sparse. I was disappointed. I also ordered a side of bacon (our server made it sound as if the bacon was special somehow) and mine came to the table literally burnt. Not really brown. BLACK. As night. Inedible. First I can't believe anyone let that leave the kitchen, second I can't believe the server didn't say \"no\" to the kitchen when they tried to give it to her. It's not like it was even a question: no one would eat this black as night bacon. At that point I began to wonder about the kitchen and how it was being run and who was paying attention and expediting/handling food quality. \u00a0A good expediter would be able to catch burnt bacon and a lack of salt. Is no one tasting the food before it leaves? Or looking at it? \u00a0Finally, we got dessert. \u00a0My chocolate mousse was delicious (grainy, but again that felt rustic and on purpose instead of like a flaw) but it was the tiniest portion imaginable and cost more than my main dish. It was literally about two tablespoons of mousse with fruit on it for $10. Our server was a very nice woman but she checked on us way too often. I should not have to say \"I'm still working on this\" that often. One thing I love about French restaurants and visiting France is that there is a coolness along with professionalism. I have never seen this as rude, but rather giving me space to take my time and talk. I missed that feeling. But that may be my preference and not the preference of a majority of people. \u00a0I would suggest to the management they might also consider finding decent gluten free bread for their cheese plate and croque monsieur/madame options. There is a huge GF community in Indy and we really will go out of our way to eat where great options are served.I really am rooting for this place. I plan to try it again in about 3 months and hope they've worked out the kinks"], ["Karine J.", "I have been there 4 times so far and every galette that I've tried has been phenomenal. I must say that I am a hug fan of the Confit de Canard; it is cooked perfectly and just melts in your mouth, by far my favorite there. Another cool thing is the fact that they have \"real\" Cider on draught, which is an absolute French pairing with cr\u00eapes, (and delicious). In all honesty, the dessert \u00a0cr\u00eapes have been hit or miss during my visits which is the only reason I cannot give it five star yet. I am sure that as they grow and keep training their staff they will undoubtedly get there! Go try it if you haven't yet!"], ["Leah P.", "My husband and I live a few blocks from this restaurant and dine out often, we were excited to try a new place. \u00a0We walked into CB around 6:30 on a Saturday. \u00a0The restaurant was at about 75% capacity and we didn't have a reservation. \u00a0Although there were about 5-6 tables open the hostess looked displeased and just looked down until another girl came up and whispered \"No reservations?\" \u00a0(We saw them turn away people later) \u00a0We suggested that we could sit at the bar, which was completely empty. \u00a0If we had not suggested this, I think they would have turned us away, even though some of those open tables were never seated while we were there. \u00a0We were the only people that were sitting at the bar, but the bartender made us feel uncomfortable. \u00a0She was nice, but seemed like she was in the weeds with two customers. \u00a0We had to ask for water, appetizer plates (coffee saucers?), napkins and silverware. \u00a0My $10 glass of ros\u00e9 was a very small pour. \u00a0I usually order two glasses of wine with dinner, but I did not feel this was a good value. \u00a0The cheese plate was great. \u00a0There was a nice variety of cheese, but only 4 pieces of bread for the cheese. \u00a0We ordered a galette which was a twist on the croquet madame: cheese, ham and an egg on top. \u00a0There were not a lot of fillings and the crepe was soggy. \u00a0After ten years of eating at La Creperie in Chicago, this place fell flat for me. The decor of the restaurant did not remind me of Paris, but yet a themed party or a Paris themed homecoming dance."], ["Joe L.", "What a great new spot on Mass Ave. I came here with some friends and we had a pretty good sampling of their menu. We started with the Fromage board and the Charcuterie board. Both were excellent besides the Muenster cheese but that's to be expected if you don't like cheese with that heavy of a flavor. We also had the bone marrow to share which I HIGHLY recommend. This was one of my favorite dishes. My tip is to spread some of the garlic aioli on the bread, put the bone marrow on it and then top it with the shallot confit. This was awesome. My friend ordered the quiche which I had a bite of and really liked as well. For my entree I had the duck breast. I also LOVED this dish. The duck was perfect. It was very tender and actually didn't taste like duck, although it was great. The salad that came with it had a great light dressing and the potatoes they paired with the duck were perfect. Lastly for dessert we had the chocolate tart. You get the point that this was great as well (I don't think they have a bad dish here). I loved the crust on this tart and also the chocolate tasted like it had a little bit of sea salt on it which gives chocolate desserts a hell of a great flavor. Overall I loved this restaurant. Service was great too and the food came out quick. I can't wait to come back and try other things here."], ["Marisa L.", "Atmosphere was really nice, loved the decor. It would have been nice to have been greeted in French and have French music. Waiter was ok. Food was ok."], ["Boris C.", "When we saw the interior through window, we were disappointed: no dimmed light, a lot of free space, white ceramic floor, almost like a fast food joint. But when we saw and tasted the food, we were really impressed. It was authentic and delicious real French cuisine.

I have lived in France and was hoping this place would take me back. \u00a0I went there for lunch and had their lunch specials a Quiche Lorraine and a salad, the quiche left a lot to be desired and so did the salad, the fries and crepes were good. I thought it was a little pricey for what you got. I would probably go back and try it again since I love anything French and try the other items on the menu."], ["Jeanluc C.", "Excellent food, wine and ambiance. Love this place.

Weird dialect of Southern Country-French-Cantonese... I don't get it. But good apple crepes."], ["Madeleine S.", "Lovely meal and experience. Even on a Saturday night our server was so warm and friendly, and the owner stopped by to check on every table. We had a glass of cider, two galettes, and shared a pear tart. All was excellent and every bit as good as what we've had in France. Frankly, the service was much better and more welcoming than anything you'd find in Paris. On top of that, prices are totally reasonable and the setting is unpretentious. We will be back soon."], ["Simon M.", "We loved it! A French inspired restaurant in a perfect location. The decor is eclectic, with hints of contemporary and of classic French. A baby grand piano was prominent, along with a lighted replica of the Eiffel Tower. It was fairly noisy, even though only about one third full, but gave you the feeling of a chatty neighborhood bistro. I had the house salad, which came with a great, light vinaigrette. Very good. I also had the caramel crepe. Delicious! My wife had the rouille complete, a rust-colored wrap with ham, egg and cheese, accompanied by fries. She gave the wrap a 10 out of 10. The fries, however were lukewarm. Our server, Camille, was pleasant and attentive, as was all of the staff. The restrooms had the unique touch of pictures of people displayed on the floor, and were clean. Always a good sign.A small matter: when asked about the fires, our server checked with the kitchen and they responded that \"they knew there was a problem.\" Could have been handled better by the kitchen staff. We will definitely return and plan to try lots of items from the menu."], ["Nicholas G.", "After two visits, I can say with some confidence that this brasserie has delicious French food, but is still a work in progress. \u00a0The atmosphere is bright and cheery, with quite a bit of seating as well as a bar with stools. \u00a0Murals of Paris are featured on some of the walls. \u00a0Our first visit, during the dinner hour for hazelnut and caramel crepes, featured delicious crepes (buttery, with a delightful juxtaposition of the soft crepes and the crunchy hazelnuts) and plenty of attention by servers. \u00a0However, there was much gnashing of teeth over the function of the espresso machine, and the cappuccinos (which were delicious) took 25 min and ended up being compliments of the house as a result. \u00a0During this time we witnessed a glass being broken and overheard a dish being sent back as it had sat too long before being served.On our second visit 2 weeks later, for lunch, we had just amazing French onion soup and the delightful galettes complet, which feature ham and eggs. \u00a0These heavier crepes were great for lunch, and the soup warmed on a \u00a0cold day. \u00a0But honestly, the quiche Lorraine we also ordered was inedible, with much too much salt and nutmeg, perhaps indicating some chef error. \u00a0There was so much nutmeg, I worried that if I ate the quiche, the little-known hallucinatory effects of the spice would make themselves known during the afternoon. \u00a0I sent it back and they were gracious again, offering a free dessert crepe. \u00a0We again had the hazelnut and caramel crepes which were just as we remembered, and a deliciously light and flavorful raspberry lemon crepe. \u00a0All in all, I think that this place will do well, and fills a niche that otherwise goes empty in Indy. \u00a0The food, atmosphere and service are all very nice, but I think that the team here needs a little more seasoning before they're ready for prime time."], ["Ashley P.", "Just this weekend was on the way to Mesh for Brunch and was pleasantly surprised to see a new restaurant menu on Mass by name of Cropichon et Bidibule. It didn't open until 2pm (my only real complaint), but hanging out on \u00a0the Ave for almost 3 hours was most definitely worth the wait!From pictures of Paris to decidedly French d\u00e9cor in the brightly lit caf\u00e9, it has quite the ambience. I got a bit of a giggle that they asked if we had been there before (as they had been open only a week), but appreciated the waitress taking the time to go through a rundown of the restaurant. Apparently all recipes derive from the chef's family, and pains had been taken to not \"Americanize\" anything. The specialty \"Complete\" crepe was the perfect blend of gruyere, ham, and organic egg. The street style Nutella and caramel crepe was delish, although the menu is a bit confusing on one point. Should you desire 2 or more of the same type of crepes, it is a small upcharge. However, if you plan on getting more than one variety you will pay the full price for each type. Our waitress was quick to point this out though, so there was no room for misunderstanding in ordering.In addition to crepes and the gluten free option of galletes, there is a healthy dessert menu that I anticipate going back to work my way through. Began with the baked peach tarte and was not disappointed. All in all this is a wonderful addition to Mass Ave and worthwhile for a late afternoon weekend brunch!"], ["Rusty J.", "Run, don't walk, to get here. I had the duck galette, which is very reasonably priced at $11. Very delicious, and they prepare it with a buckwheat flour that they import from France. I also sampled the gruyere, ham, etc., friand from the small-plate entree menu. You can't miss with that either, and it's even more of a steal at $9. Those two items comfortably fed the two of us. We shared three glasses of French wine (the selection and prices were very nice) and capped off the evening with two of the savory crepes. I also enjoy Brugge (in Broad Ripple) for crepes, but these are authentic French style and a step above in many ways. The owner is very friendly and came out to chat with me, as we share a musical background. He's an accomplished French musician, and apparently he and his wife (also musically talented) sometimes perform in the restaurant. He is a well-credentialed violinist, so I hope to hear him one night. Our server was also quite knowledgable and friendly.The atmosphere is very nice, quiet, and I love the chandeliers with wine glasses hanging (you'll see what I mean). A very welcome addition to Mass Ave. Welcome to Indy. I hope all of you will give them a shot!"], ["Hannah M.", "I can't get enough of this restaurant! I have been here about 6 times now and the food amazes me more and more. French onion soup, the CB baguette sandwich, the apple and goat cheese galette, whatever salad they have with goat cheese (huge fan of goat cheese obviously) -- all so amazing. Honestly the best baguettes I've ever tasted. Service could be better at times, but every time I've gone, the owner comes up and talks with us about how we are enjoying ourselves. So happy this little cafe came to the neighborhood!!"], ["Iva H.", "Thought we would try this place for devour downtown. \u00a0So glad we did. The service and speed of service was great and we enjoyed our meals. It was a good value. We had the beet salad and French onion soup to start. Main entrees were beef bourguignon and steak frites. Both were quite tasty. Sampled both the chocolate mousse and creme caramel for dessert. You could not make a wrong choice on either."], ["Chris W.", "We stopped in again for a bite after a Fringe show and enjoyed a sweet and another savory crepe. The ham and guarye with egg was knock out and the apple and caramel crepe were so good. $20 for a late night bite was spot on. Give this place a try with an open mind and exploratory palate."], ["Dakota H.", "Food was fabulous. Wine took ages to get to the table. Our server was okay at his job. Not spectacular, but not a doofus. The manager on duty was odd. We would have ordered more food if she stopped vocalizing her stream of consciousness at us. None of the employees I interacted with could pronounce bourguignon. It's a new enough restaurant that I feel like they'll rotate through their front of house staff to find some people who fit better."], ["Mellisa E.", "Stopped in the other day for a baguette sandwich. It had ham, egg, tomato, salad, and house made mayo and came with fries. It was absolutely delicious and came out within minutes of my ordering it! I would definitely recommend for a fast lunch either eat in or to carry out."], ["Sandra L.", "YES! This place is a great new addition to the Indy restaurant scene. There is no other place quite like it. My friend and I chanced upon it while walking down Mass Ave and decided to give it a try. We were very surprised by the very reasonable prices for a place serving French food. I had a steak dish with a peppercorn sauce that was nothing less than outstanding. Only order it if you like your beef medium rare. My friend had a sausage crepe that was equally as delicious. My friend ended with an almond and pear tart while I had the chocolate mousse which were both excellent. The service was great and very friendly while the environment was clean, bright and classy. I think the owner is French. He stopped by the table to say hello and see how we liked the food. \u00a0We will definitely be back with more friends!"], ["John L.", "Was walking down Mass Ave and decided to give it a try. Ordered the Salmon Gallete and got my food surprisingly fast (like within 5 minutes !). The combination of the potatoes, salmon, lettuce, and toppings (some sort of mayo) were fantastic. I paired it with a glass of Merlot and had a delicious lemon crepe for dessert. Came in expecting an average lunch and left full and very happy. Will definitely be coming back."], ["Ryan H.", "Amazing. Truly authentic menu, friendly staff, wonderful owners. Husband had a baguette sandwich that he loved, and i had the croque madame which was done perfectly. Great ambience, too- very French but not overly clich\u00e9. Wine selection fabulous (actual French wine choices!) priced reasonably too. Why aren't you there eating already?!? We will be back and will save room for dessert next time."], ["Valerie T.", "Had lunch here today and enjoyed it very much! Service was attentive and knowledgable without being obtrusive. The baguette served before the meal was crusty on the outside and soft in the middle, and served warm. I had the croque Monsieur combination, and chose fries and a house salad for my sides. The fries were tasty and the salad was perfectly dressed. The sandwich was also very good, with shaved ham which I prefer to a slab. The half sandwich that came with the combo was plenty, as it is a quite rich dish. My friend ordered a mushroom crepe (galette) and said it was also very good. We split the chocolate mousse for dessert, which was also very good if you like dark chocolate. Very rich and more of a terrine texture (denser than most mousse). The atmosphere is nice, although parts are a little gaudy (big fake red roses around a lit up Eiffel Tower sculpture). The dining area has nice divisions rather than one big open space. We sat by the fire whichvwas cozy on a snowy March day. The acoustic tiles on the ceiling also probably keep the dining room from getting too loud on crowded nights. Overall, a welcome addition to Mass Ave. Looking forward to going back when I don't have to go back to work and can enjoy a glass of wine!"], ["Jenny S.", "I was excited for this place to join the restaurant offerings on Mass Ave. \u00a0Plus I'm a fan of Petit Chou in Broad Ripple and a closer crepe outlet seemed like a good thing. \u00a0But I did not like the food, nor did I like the atmosphere. \u00a0Much work to do here. \u00a0Based on more recent good reviews though, I'll give it another try."], ["Sam L.", "My experience here was fantastic! I started with the charcuterie which was a great blend of meats you typically don't see (the rabbit was great). I then had the duck for my main course. The duck was pleasantly tender, perfectly seasoned, and still moist. The salad that accompanied the duck had a great dressing. Simple yet still very complimentary to the greens. Over all I will certainly be back again. I can't wait to try other items on their menu."], ["Harishankar U.", "Great food in an amazing decor. So many crepe options for vegetarians.

Again, i do not recommend!"], ["Graham C.", "After having lived in France and eating at La Creperie in Chicago for years, I can tell you without hesitation that this place really gets it right! The food is authentic and delicious and the service is amazing! They also accommodated a group of high school students that I brought in with very little notice. The owner was so nice, he spoke with all of them in French to give them experience speaking to a native speaker before their upcoming AP Exam. They also gave each student a Eiffel Tower bottle opener to help them remember their trip to the restaurant!

Upon arrival I remembered this was Dodd's Townhouse many years ago. They had to retain the tasteful log cabin interior, but it works. We were seated right away even though we were 20 minutes early for our reservations. Everything just got better from there. Our cocktails were quick to the table and well prepared. \u00a0Our Fried Oyster appetizer was equally quick and amazing. Just watch out for the Sriracha, which was presented on the side. It's American fare, but exquisite. Great dishes. Steak, chicken, pork chop, etc. But also serving venison, boar, and duck. Everything sounded delicious on the menu, so it was hard to choose. Thankfully, it's a concise menu. I am a big fan of short and amazing menus. After the typical debate over what to share, we decided on a wonderful duck trio dish and venison osso buco. It only took us a few bites to realize we made excellent choices. We were overwhelmed with the flavor, but also a power outage. That's where it gets interesting. The service became calm, cool and amazing. The servers quickly addressed the the situation and then went back to work. Don't get me wrong. It was dark. Pretty soon the chef came out, stood on a chair and gave us an update. We all applauded. We finished our amazing meal via the fake candlelight at the table, signed away our credit card on a post card, and left satiated with some amazing American cuisine, in a beautiful setting, with a staff that knows service. Go there."], ["Cliff H.", "Food we tried: burger, steak frites, risotto, barley soup. The best item was the burger, which is about par for this part of the country. Unfortunately the chefs (cook?) don't seem to know how to execute on the other items we tried and we were not satisfied with our meals. \u00a0On top of that, service was on the rude side possibly because we were eating with our kids. In fact we were greeted after our OpenTable reservation with the comment \"we don't have kids menus\". We didn't ask for kids menus thank you. The ambience of the restaurant could be nice but the staff kept dragging chairs around the floor and rearranging tables. I would suggest lifting the chairs when moving or adding felt bottoms to your chairs. It would create a lot less noise. We won't be back. Good luck."], ["Sanchez H.", "Heads up: this review is a LOVE Fest because our evening at The Meridian was OFF THE HOOK!

Mac-n-cheese, such cheesy goodness. Bone-in Ribeye was fantastic and Crystal Valley Chicken was really good too- these were popular dishes at our table. \u00a0If you have a hankering for pasta our table also enjoyed the Wild Boar Bolognese.

The lunch menu is great and at the right price (around $10-15 a plate). On my most recent trip, I came with a group of girlfriends. They took a reservation for us and had a nice table set up in the corner. The atmosphere is really cozy--lots of dark hardwood and an upscale cabiny feel. I got the quiche lorraine, which was delicious and just the right size. One friend got the enchiladas and LOVED them. Some others got the steak frites and fall risotto and thought those were very good, too. The staff is attentive but not overbearing.

Maybe because of its location or maybe of its subtlety - for whatever reason this restaurant was not on my radar. And that is completely my mistake. To say I was shocked by this historic gem is an understatement. The ambiance is fantastic - one friend commented that he would love to see it around the Christmas holidays. Its rough-hewn log walls are endearing. The service was friendly and knowledgeable. And the food was delicious in its simplicity.

I don't even usually like oysters and they were outstanding. All of our entr\u00e9es were perfectly cooked and tastefully seasoned. 3 chicken, and 1 beef burger. Lastly we ordered 2 types of dessert and it was delicious. We ate every bit of the donuts which we highly recommend!! The dipping sauce provided was impeccably done to compliment the baked donut.

I was visiting the second time and had brought along a friend to celebrate her new job. We tried their fois gras (new item) and the corn pur\u00e9e soup for appetizers. For entree I had the crusted flounder and my friend had the duck confit. Service - 5 star+ :)Ambience - 5 starFood - 4 stars. Here's why - the fois gras was not the best I have had. Far from it. I would rather they serve it over real caramelized onion instead of what felt like a paste of caramelized onion. And they added not so crisp biscuits to the dish which quite spoiled it. It's certainly not worth the $20. Of course my expectations were set high since I've been to Paris where I was introduced to this dish. The corn soup was par excellent and has won the best soup in Indy for a reason. My founder was mediocre and nothing to write home about. The duck confit which I tasted a bit was also good but didn't have the wow factor.Lastly we had the doughnuts which is a must try at this place. They make them fresh bring it in a brown bag with cane sugar and shake it beside your table. Then they pour it on a plate and serve it with a mix of expresso and mustard sauce and whipped cream. Esoteric!! But for the flounder and fois gras they would have got a 5 star. I will be back here again since I have promised myself to try all their meals.

I made reservations and let them know it was date night so they would hopefully sit is somewhere secluded(they didn't). When we arrived (around 6pm) I asked if we could be seated by the fireplace. The waitress told me no because people reserve those spots which I understood. That was until we left at 730pm and there was still no one seated there. That really annoyed me. Besides that one thing, the rest of the experience was awesome. We had a great waiter who made us feel welcome and helped with our selections.

For dinner I had the beef and my fianc\u00e9 had the salmon. We also got the mac n cheese to share which I have to say is as amazing as everyone else (on yelp) said it would be. My fianc\u00e9 could not stop raving about the salmon and I thuerally enjoyed my meal as well. One thing I would like to change is that the entrees are a little expensive seeing as how you have to buy the sides at an extra charge but I will still be going back regardless.

I took a few customers here to show them the glorious options outside of downtown Indy. We visited on a weeknight, so there weren't too many covers. Service was spot on and perfect in every way. We ordered a wide range of food and drinks. Local beers, bottles of wine, seafood, pierogis, steaks, appetizers, and desserts. Everything was presented beautifully and tasted amazing. If the story stopped there, 5 stars for sure. The problem is the price. Yes, I know it's local. Yes, it was delicious. But paying $20+ for a few pierogis is hard to swallow if you're personally picking up the check. This is definitely a \"special occasion\" establishment. They have a great romantic environment, especially if it's \u00a0chilly and you can grab a spot by the fireplace. As a result of its romantic adult vibe and high price point, it's not a great place for children."], ["Heather T.", "Came here for my birthday on the 27th (a Tuesday night) and overall I was unimpressed. The food was good, nothing special. The best part of the night was the bottle of Chateau de Sancerre pinot noir. The rest of my party was 30 minutes late so I was already slightly sour but still the food wasn't spectacular. Had the crab cakes, a brussels sprout salad and the boar pasta. The pasta was the best part. Service was good. Attentive but not overbearing.

No corn chunks which is fine with me but a couple mini croutons to break up the viscous soup. I would order again in a heartbeat.I had the wild boar bolognese. It was great, the boar really came through and there was a ton of meat. It was bolognese the way bolognese should be - not runny or chunky tomatoes at all. Highly recommend. I'd say I'd get it again, but the rest of the menu looked so good, I'd probably try something else.It seems a waste to order steak at Meridian, but if you do it comes topped with this incredible bacon jam. My friends around the table had similarly delicious dishes and were all very pleased.Unfortunately, I was very full and skipped out on dessert - big mistake. Get the apple pie.

It's cozy inside, the staff is good, and the food is always interesting. The smoked corn puree and roasted beets are both tasty appetizers. It's just my preference, but I would get something aside from a relatively common meal (e.g. steak). Not because the steak is bad, it's really good. But you can get a good steak lots of places, or at home. It's harder to find a place with boar or duck that you can try something unusual with confidence that it's still going to be good.

At first, I am one who does believe it is quite a charming restaurant offering a bit of the old ( Dodd's Townhouse) with a completely renovated upscale lodge feel.My lunch faire was the smoked corn puree to start and seared Verlasso salmon.

For dessert we had the PB&J Parfait. The food was well-prepared and tasty, but not \"wow! This is really great!\" In general, the flavors were a bit timid.The restaurant is quiet so it was easy to talk with others at the table without shouting.

I usually get the filet, which is infinitely better than any of the 'famous steak house' filets. \u00a0The Meridian's chef is very particular about the quality of ingredients and it shows. \u00a0The beef is succulent, flavorful and simply the best I've ever had anywhere, including Texas. Of course, his preparation is flawless every time. And for dessert? \u00a0How about some wonderfully pretentious donuts? They fry the small homemade confections in single batches when ordered, then your waiter shakes them in a brown paper lunch bag with cinnamon and sugar tableside. \u00a0In one smooth motion, he dumps the hot donuts onto a fine china plate that has been smeared with a perfectly simple vanilla donut glaze. \u00a0It's a truly great and unusual dessert presentation.

OMG you guys, I pretty much cannot fathom better macaroni and cheese. Other than that, here's a rundown of all the items the four of us made our way through:- Applewood Smoked Martini: enjoyable and smoky \u00a0 - Fresh Basil Gimlet: refreshing.

Do NOT skip- Macaroni and Cheese: as I mentioned, absolutely incredible, and I'm kind of a mac n' cheese nut. It's a smooth, perfect, white cheese macaroni and cheese. A generous portion, too- Roasted Summer Vegetables: a smaller portion of tasty zucchini and squash- Shrimp and Pork Belly: an incredible, innovative dish bursting with flavors. I enjoyed it very much!- Venison Rack special: This is what my boyfriend ordered. He liked it okay but kind of wished he had gotten the Braised Lamb Roast instead- Duck Two-Ways: this is what my mom got. She seemed to like it through I don't remember anything about the bite I tried- Dewig Farms Filet of Beef: what dad got. He loved it and had to guard it from the rest of us! \u00a0- Fudge Brownie S'mores: crazy good!- Old Fashioned Carrot Cake: moist and delicious!

Also had the smoked corn puree topped with bacon bits which was very tasty and comfort food like. Both dishes are highly recommended. After those 2 starters, the rest of the meal was so so. I had the glazed lamb loin chop for my entree which had good flavor but had more bone than meat. The fried crispy chickpea that came with the chops gave a very nice touch to the dish. The wife did not enjoy her pasta dish at all. The flavor just had no depth to it and on the bland side. Then for dessert, I thought the selection was quite boring, we ended up with a chocho cake/ganache and though it tasted ok, just had no zing to it (flourless choco cake at tastings downtown is way better). Place is nice, white table cloth, dim lighting, and dark wood everywhere. Service was prompt and nice, they keep refilling our water glasses and would give us clean set of utensils after every dish.

We decided on Meridian because I could actually understand their menu and they had a nice selection of entrees that were reasonably priced for fine dining. I had also heard good things from a chef friend of mine. My mango tango martini was delicious. It tasted how Mr. Bubbles smells, honestly, that is the best way to describe it, and it is a compliment. It didn't taste soapy, just fruity and delicious but not overly sweet. We had the bacon and eggs appetizer which was a piece of pork belly with a fried egg, cheese grits, Brussels sprouts and sweet chili sauce. This unexpected combination of flavors was awesome and for once my husband actually ate a Brussels sprout! My husband had the ribeye special which I tried and it was melt in your mouth fabulous. It was made from Waygu beef which is America's version of Kobe beef, minus the $50 price tag. I had the chilean sea bass. It was very good on top of a bed of mushroom risotto with drops of basil pesto. Our dessert, the butterscotch brulee combined three things I love so much, butterscotch, creme brulee, and bacon. This dish had cornbread on the bottom, what tasted like the best butterscotch pudding I've ever had, carmelized sugar on top, then a sprinkling of bacon bits. What I loved most about this place was their unorthodox way of combining flavors a normal person wouldn't normally put together. Each and every dish was an unexpected delight.

Think Panera's setup. It's a little cumbersome since it's right by the door but seems to works.Food. For a starter we got a small Duck Fat Pommes Frites ($4.95 fries fried in duck fat.) This is a French restaurant so you might have to Google a few things to see what they are. hey were surprisingly just okay. I had potato chips fried in duck fat in Wooster, Ohio and they. were. amazing. These just tasted like french fries-good but meh.

If you like mushrooms you'll love this rich, well done duxelle.The seasonal Caprese salad ($9.95) was perfectly stacked fresh mozzerella, tomatoes and basil, drizzled with olive oil and basalmic. Very nice and fresh. Small, but I was still able to share it.The Benedict Crep\u00e9 ($13.50 ham, gruy\u00e8re cheese, sunny side up egg and bernaise sauce) was VERY good.

I usually stick to the original Cafe Patachou, but every time I go to Petite Chou, I wish I would come here more than I do. It's pretty close to perfect. \u00a0I don't know how they do it - but they manage to combine Patachou favorites like the Broken Yolk sandwiches and some of their popular salads with a menu filled with crepes, croques and tartines - and make me feel like I'm dining at a Paris cafe, all without leaving Broad Ripple. I've only been here during the day, so I can only speak for the lunch menu, but I'm sure the dinner menu is just as good. How could it not be? Let's start with salads: you can't go wrong with the Farmstand, Fried Feta or Quinoa, though I think the Farmstand may be my favorite. However, I think my favorite thing on the menu is the egg salad tartine. It's not too crazy or out there, but it's SO GOOD!!!!! The egg salad is delicious, and the combination of that and the wheat bread and the dressed greens on the side is just good eating. And, obviously, the frites are to die for and are perfect for sharing. I may take a little flack for this, but I think Taste's and Brugge's are better. However, Petite Chou's are still amazing and worth getting. My one qualm - parking here is a bear. There is a shared lot with several other businesses. I'm talking like, 8 spaces to start out with, good luck finding one. Street parking, depending on the time of day can be a little iffy too, so be prepared to park and walk.

This review isn't one of them.I'm really glad everyone likes it. It is a nice place... A while back I had a great brunch at Patachou on the Park and figured since both places are part of the same restaurant family this brunch would be just as great. My experience wasn't not great. It was just ok... the food was ok and the service was ok. The d\u00e9cor is nice. Hosts are pleasant.The space is very cramped. It's a bit of a pain to navigate through the people waiting to be seated to get to where the self-serve coffee is. I'm a klutz. I concentrated REALLY hard to get my coffee back to my table without bumping into someone. \u00a0I dined with two other people and we each got different entrees and each felt the same sense of so-so-ness about our foods. One of my dining companions tried two different cocktails and wasn't wowed by those either. For the price, I'm just not sure Petite Chou is a place to get too excited about."], ["Paula O.", "My friend and I were very excited about trying Petite Chou, knowing how we feel about Cafe Patachou - we both find it amazing. This place, however, was a serious disappointment. I am alright with a small, cramped and even loud restaurant, IF the food is good. Not in this case.First, we ordered an appetizer of crab cakes. Not plural - there was only one warm crab cake on top of a bed of cold mediocre potatoes. AND, it was a whopping $11. I then ordered the rotisserie chicken crepe, which tasted akin to a previously frozen chicken pot pie. It was bland, the mushrooms were hard, the sauce tasted like a can of Campbell's gravy sauce and the chicken was dry, chewy and I had three bites of cartilage in the half of it that I actually bothered consuming. The side \"salad\" was three whole leaves of bibb lettuce with a gross vinaigrette. My friend had the chicken salad. \u00a0It was so nasty that she couldn't eat more than three bites. I tried it as well and can say with confidence it was the worst chicken salad I've ever tasted. Her side was also mostly old, browning pieces of fruit and a nasty little lemon pastry thing. To top it off this whole experience took nearly two hours. Our waitress was not amicable whatsoever and pretty rude. Never once did she ask us how our meal was. Seeing that we still had full plates she asked if we needed a to go box. Umm, no. It seems like a waitress should be aware of when people are disappointed with the food and at least attempt to make it right. She obviously didn't care to do that. Also, not only did we have to get our own coffee (located at the busy front entrance), it was also $3 a cup. The crowded little space makes it hard to navigate, so we didn't bother refilling our cups. What a ripoff. $27 later, and still hungry, we finally got out of there and went somewhere else. Don't waste your time going here, no matter what the other reviewers are saying. \u00a0Some people need to learn what \"good\" food actually is."], ["Stacy A.", "Consistently good. They use Fresh ingredients focusing on local farmers and companies. My husband's favorite dish is the the stuffed French toast. I'm partial to their bottomless cup of coffee of which they have several brews to choose from. Also their prosecco cocktails are tasty and being they have fruit they dont quite count as alcohol in the am, right?"], ["Cassie B.", "We came here on a Wednesday night for my 30th birthday, we had the cheese plate (which was nice), the crab crepe and pork entree. I was dissapointed with the service and also the quality of the food. The atmosphere was nice and I would come back to try the brunch (which I have heard good things about), but we would not return for dinner."], ["Christine Z.", "One of my all-time favorite breakfast spots, Petite Chou is one of Indy's best caf\u00e9s/bistros with an outdoor patio.You can't go wrong with any of their broken yolk sandwiches or omelets (the overachiever is my favorite). Highly recommend their cinnamon toast -- it's incredible.After your meal, don't forget it get take a cup of coffee to-go. They have a self-serve coffee bar, complete with to-go cups."], ["Polly S.", "We were here for brunch over Thanksgiving weekend. Super cute and delicious!They have a heated patio area where we were able to bring our dog. It was unseasonably warm so it was nice to be able to take advantage of the semi outdoor area.Coffee is serve yourself style and really good. I'm a huge fan of their Great Harvest sourdough bread via the Broken Yolk sandwich. We were actually able to buy a loaf to bring home. My husband had the quinoa squash salad which was really good but more of a starter and not really filling as a main meal. It's worth noting that the atmosphere is unquestionably hip. You won't get your Arby's crowd here, instead you'll find your older cool art teacher or someone with an Instagram account."], ["Nicole K.", "Came here for brunch with my boyfriend. I ordered the Harrison Cr\u00eape with a peach banana smoothie and a side of fruit. Boyfriend got the Benedict Cr\u00eape with a side of bacon. Both were very delicious and the staff were very friendly and it was quiet and enjoyable. I will definitely be returning soon."], ["Alexandra L.", "This has just made the list as one of my favorite places to eat! I loved all of the menu options that they had available (which is probably why it took me nearly 20 min to make a decision). I immediately asked for a coffee and really like how they give you a cup and allow you to go to the coffee bar area to choose from a few different options or mix them however you want.Main dish choice: I went with the 'build your own omelet and added mushrooms, spinach, tomatoes, goat cheese. Everything was so fresh and it came with a bowl of fruit and cinnamon sugar toast - amazing. I plan on trying the broken yolk sandwich next time and can't wait!I ate here about 2 weeks ago when it was gorgeous outside and was able to sit at a table inside the fully screened patio which was very enjoyable. I assume that they allow dogs as well... a family was seated near me with their beautiful siberian husky that behaved well, the waitress even offered them a bowl of fresh water for the dog. How sweet. There's not a lot of parking here but that didn't bother me because everything seems to be centrally located in Broad Ripple and does't take long to walk to from a different parking lot."], ["Haley B.", "Loved the atmosphere of this little restaurant. The unique french caf\u00e9 vibe and scenery was a nice change to other restaurants. Although my overall experience was positive, I did have some things that I wasn't thrilled about during my brunch here. Firstly would be the coffee situation. When going to fill up my mug from the various coffee selections they had, only one type of coffee was actually available. This was a little bit of a disappointing start. The menu had some interesting choices but if you're not looking to spend much money you probably should go elsewhere. I enjoyed my chicken crepe but probably wouldn't pay that much for one again. Overall I did enjoy this restaurant but I think it's more of a good place to enjoy a drink than a real meal."], ["Melissa V.", "We had breakfast here this AM (Monday, at 8:30) and we were the only ones in the place. \u00a0We went here on a recommendation from a friend who lived in town and our sandwiches were great!I had the croque madame, and my husband had the broken yolk crab cake sandwich - both were awesome. \u00a0Hard to rate it a 5 on service as we were the only people there, so... can't really say what it would have been if it was busy!The only disappointing thing was the fruit cup that came with my husbands sandwich - it definitely wasn't fresh fruit. \u00a0It looked like yesterdays leftovers (or frozen then thawed) and not even something I would serve someone at my house? Really weird. \u00a0But the sandwiches were great!"], ["Mayme W.", "After living in Indy for over 17 years, I have yet to understand the adoration that people have for the local Patachou chain of restaurants. When I first moved here, a friend and I went for brunch at the Patachou south of Broad Ripple, based on glowing reviews in Indianapolis Monthly. Since it was early on Sunday, there were few customers. We sat and waited for service for about 20 minutes, but no one acknowledged our presence, so we left. \u00a0This first experience (1-star) has clouded my opinion of the Patachou chain forever more.Throughout the years. I have eaten at other Patachou locations, based on the insistence of friends who absolutely love this restaurant. The service at the Indianapolis airport and the downtown locations was better than my initial experience. I usually order the Hippie with a Benz omelette, which was OK, like something you can make at home, as was the endless supply of weak self-serve coffee. \u00a0Average food and service (3-stars).The final straw was this past Thursday at the Petite Chou in Broad Ripple. The place was packed, with customers standing outside, since it was a pleasant summer evening. Luckily, my friends were able to snag a table at the back for the 4 of us. When my friend asked to be moved to a different table because the setting sun was in her eyes, the hostess seemed reluctant to change our table, so we let it go. Another friend ordered the quail, and was told 10 minutes later that it had sold out, so he ordered the duck. \u00a0Ten minutes later, he was told that duck was sold out too. So he settled for the chicken pailliard, as did my other 2 companions. \u00a0I ordered the mussels and frites. By this time (about 30 minutes after we sat down), many of the other tables had left and the dinner rush was over. \u00a0Yet.... we waited another 30 minutes before we got our food. My mussels and frites were tepid. Over half of the mussels were just empty shells, and the fries, despite being cooked in duck fat, were quite ordinary and soggy. When we complained about the poor service (by this time, we were the last table inside the restaurant), the hostess took 10% off our meals. Overall, a 2-star experience. \u00a0Fortunately, there are now many other excellent restaurants in Indy at the same price point as the Patachou chain, but with more innovative food and better service"], ["Beth H.", "I used to love this place, but am hugely disappointed about the new menu. They have eliminated their most distinctive and delicious breakfast item. The loaded toast with fresh housemade ricotta! Gone!! It was vegetables, \u00a0crispy cucumber, greens, red onion, and tomato on their wonderful whole wheat bread and ricotta cheese, and a light dressing. I did register my disappointment, \u00a0but it's likely no good.

She had the Chicken Salad Tartine for her entree - both entrees were outstanding! The Pomme frites were good but a little underdone for my taste.The only reason for the 3 stars was the service. Our server was slow and did not offer or bring drink refills the whole meal. However, the most upsetting thing was the server was putting the condiments in the little ramekins with the pomme frites on the counter in the dining room - and she spilled some on the side and LICKED HER FINGER TO WIPE IT OFF....then slopped some more and did it again. This is gross. Just gross.I worked in food service for many years so I know stuff like this happens in the kitchen but come on - if this is happening in the dining room in full view of patrons, what is going on out of sight in the kitchen?I will probably give it another shot because the food was tasty but it'll be awhile...I have to get past a total stranger licking my lunch first."], ["Karen D.", "A hot Sunday afternoon found the fam looking for a shady brunch spot.

We started with the cheeses. They were delicious. For entrees, 3 out of 6 of us got the chicken paillard with lemon sauce (myself included). It was literally the best chicken dish I've ever eaten at a restaurant. Two others got the salmon, which they really enjoyed. All of the cocktails were tried were delicious. I finished off my meal with a berry dessert crepe. It was delicious and the berries were so fresh.The only drawback to this place is that there is really only one sturdy vegetarian option for dinner. My boyfriend is a vegetarian, and we have been unable to come here because he's not interested in the vegetarian crepe and a salad certainly isn't enough food for him."], ["Becky G.", "I had brunch today at Petite Chou. They sat our party outside which was lovely because the weather was nice. I ordered a broken yolk sandwich, which I have had before at Patachou and loved. Unfortunately the yolks were overcooked on my sandwich and we're not runny at all...kind of defeats the purpose of a broken yolk sandwich. I thought this may have just been an accident on my sandwich but my friend ordered the same meal and her eggs were cooked even more than mine. Additionally, my sister ordered her omelet without bacon but it came with bacon in it. The service was also a bit slow. Another friend did get a fruit crepe which was very good and the iced coffee is always enjoyable. We also tried the cinnamon toast which was great.

Best. Breakfast. Stop.

Now, when I got the menu for this little slice of heaven, I knew that choosing just ONE entree would be hard enough, but then once I had decided to go with the omelette, there were so many options oozing with deliciousness. I opted for the omelette of the day which featured ham, white cheddar, and tomatoes: My lips have never tasted an omelette so wonderfully crafted. I mean, really. I about blew out of my seat...but wait...there's more! I asked for some jam for my toast and out comes my waitress with HOMEMADE BLACKBERRY JAM. And let me tell you, this jam is the best damn jam I have ever had.

Mac n' cheese: I've become a bit of a mac n' cheese snob over the last few years and can't help but internally poo poo at Velveeta mac n' cheese when other quesos like goat, gouda and gruyere are calling my name. Cavattapi noodles with plentiful cheese in Petit Chou's version. I did add a dash of salt and pepper, but I'd rather it be me adding than them using too much.

As the full name indicates, Petite Chou is a Bistro and Champagne Bar with a strong French orientation.

It was an odd combination of ingredients (butternut squash, brussel sprouts, etc - see menu pic), but the combination was simply out of this world!

If you're in Broadripple and are hungry you should eat at Petite Chou by Patachou."], ["Jason F.", "I stopped by here yesterday with my fianc\u00e9 and my parents for brunch. \u00a0We ended up arriving at the restaurant around 9:45 or so and as soon as we stepped into the outdoor patio area my fianc\u00e9 was impressed with the atmosphere. We then proceeded inside to the hostess who asked us if we wanted either indoor or outdoor seating. \u00a0It was a beautiful day outside and so we decided to do the outdoor seating even though it meant a small wait instead of being seated immediately. \u00a0Since it was our first time here we really didn't know where to stand and ended up hanging out near the hostess station which meant that we go in the way of a ton of people. \u00a0We would later see that most of the people waiting for a table waited outside on the sidewalk and I sort of wish that the hostess would have told us as much. \u00a0Oh well, it did nothing to hurt my thoughts about this place. \u00a0What I did love about waiting here is that they have a serve yourself coffee area. \u00a0That means that I didn't have to wait to get to the table to drink what ended up being a nice Sumatra coffee. It was delicious as it was rich and strong without being very bitter at all. \u00a0Finally after about a 10 minute wait, our table was ready.For brunch I decided to start off the table with a large order of the pommes frites while ordering myself the Broken Yolk with bacon and avocado for my entr\u00e9e and finishing off by splitting the sweet ricotta cheese crepe with the table for dessert. \u00a0The frites were out only a short time after ordering and tasted pretty good, especially when dipped in the dijonnaise sauce. \u00a0They were crispy and well seasoned but sadly I could not tell that they were fried in the duck fat that the menu said they were. \u00a0Next up was my entr\u00e9e which had 2 strips of bacon and a half an avocado on it. \u00a0I really enjoyed breaking both eggs over the bread and having the bread sop up all of the good flavoring. \u00a0While it was a little bit messy to eat (yeah I realize it was called a Broken Yolk and I was good with it being messy) I loved the flavors of it and quickly ate it all up. \u00a0My entr\u00e9e also ended up coming with a cup of fruit which looked really nice. \u00a0It had strawberries, grapes, pineapple and more and while I did not end up eating any of it, I was impressed that they didn't have any different melons in it which I normally consider filler fruit. \u00a0After I had finished my entr\u00e9e my mother asked me if I would like to eat the other half of her savory spinach, mushrooms and goat cheese crepe which I readily agreed to. \u00a0The crepe was nice and light and contained a surprising amount of mushrooms which I really enjoyed. \u00a0Then my fianc\u00e9 offered me the sourdough toast and strawberry jam that came with her meal. \u00a0Even though I was already full and we had a dessert coming up next I couldn't pass it up. \u00a0The toast and jam ended up being really good and I loved every bite of it. \u00a0Last but not least was our dessert. \u00a0At this point I was about ready to burst but I still managed to eat more than my fair share of it. \u00a0This crepe was also nice and covered in blueberries which I really enjoyed. \u00a0The only thing that I couldn't really taste in it was the lemon rind which I think would have been nice as the acidity would have cut down on the overall sweetness. \u00a0Still, it was a pretty good sweet crepe.The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future. \u00a0I loved everything about this place from the food to the atmosphere and I am sad that we do not have a comparable place in Pittsburgh."], ["Grant R.", "Hands down our favorite restaurant in Broad Ripple, possibly in all of Indy.

The broken yolk sandwiches are top notch, as is the Cobb salad. Thirsty or nursing a hangover? Try any of the mimosas that petite Chou has to offer. In the mood to rage? I recommend the Death in the Afternoon mimosa, which features absinthe.

We sat outside out front which was nice because we weren't stuck in the tiny indoors or the narrow beside the building passageway they have the nerve to call a dining area. The table came with a carafe of outside temperature tap water with no ice and no lemon, no offer of either, and old fashioned glasses to pour into. The froo-froo menu had raw red onion listed on almost every item. I opted for the Le Club which turned out to have the crusts and more of the bread cut off so I had about 2/3 of a very thin not very club like sandwich and some limp overdressed lettuce on the side for $12. My friend had the chicken salad tartine, which is snooty for open faced toast. If there was half a cup of chicken salad smeared on the toast I'd be shocked and add another side of limp lettuce and ring up another $12. Steer clear of this overpriced, mediocre food, average service, okay atmosphere mess. Maybe then it will close and something good can move into its prime location. I need to go pay again somewhere else to eat a second lunch because that expensive snack didn't last me 30 minutes."], ["Fred J.", "The service is kind of hit or miss, but overall the staff is generally friendly.

I went healthy with the awesome oatmeal...but the broken yolk sandwich is a definite must get (mine, I do veggie style).Their bread is amazing, and I love to get it toasted with butter.

It took 15 minutes for anyone to come over and ask for drinks another 25 before we ordered food and then almost 45 minutes to get the food.

The only saving grace was that the food was actually good."], ["Krista A.", "This is the most convenient of the Patachou places for me, and is actually the only one I've been to! We had fantastic service. We sat outside, and the table had an issue with the leg being wobbly. Our server actually grabbed another table and moved it to where we were sitting, because we were in a nice spot and didn't really want to move. Super nice of him!

I enjoyed my smoked salmon tartine, though I do wish I had chosen something less simple, something that would've really showcased what Petite Chou can create. Mais, c'est la vie. I tried my sister's Tomato and Artichoke soup, which was delicious, but the little minx wolfed down the chicken salad tartine she got with the combo before I could try it! The Pomme Frites were tasty too, but I think the brunch cocktails really stole the show for us boozers.

Recently, we went back specifically for the delicious crepes, only to find that they no longer serve them. \u00a0So they went from a Creperie to a douchbaggerie. \u00a0For what food was left on the menu - it was overpriced and just ok. \u00a0The restaurant itself is on the small / cramped side. \u00a0I wish them luck on their new menu, but will take a pass."], ["Nezbit T.", "My go-to place for an intimate dinner, but I tried the brunch selection today.

The service was impeccable. You know how a server will ask you all of the questions from the server handbook but not really show any interest in you as a customer? They don't do that here.

First off, our waitress was PHENOMENAL! She gave such great suggestions, and was lively in conversation with us. We started with an order of the duck fat fries and they were delish. They are served with a great dipping sauce and I would say we polished them off in about two seconds. For my main, I ordered the Salad Nicoise and it was very good. I thought I could have been given a bit more tuna, but it was cooked perfectly and the greens, tomatoes, olives and potatoes were great. My sister had the Smoked Salmon Tartine and I snuck a bite and it was very fresh and tasty. My other sister had the Ratatouille Crepe and it was much heartier than I thought it would be, but had tons of veggies in a red sauce. It was very good. Lastly, my mom had the Croque Madame and you just cant go wrong there. Two thick pieces of bread with ham and smothered in cheese with a sunny side up egg on top...does it get much better?!We all ordered a fun cocktail to start. I had the Bellini, my sister ordered the blackberry, but quickly decided she didnt like it and got something else. Our wonderful waitress didnt charge us for the drink and let us each share it since it was going to waste anyway. My mom ordered the mimosa and my other sister the lavender.

The hand cut fries were super tasty, the sweet potato fries were delightful, and the best for last ... THE PICKLE FRIES WERE FREAKING AWESOME!!!

Unfortunately, you lack the coolness of your sister restaurant Usual Suspects. This is the second time I have visited this spot since they opened. My first trip was not very memorable. This one was slightly better, but still didn't make me a fan. I made a reservation for 3 at 6:30 on a Thursday evening. I arrived on time and was given an option of outdoor or indoor seating. The place wasn't packed, so I told the hostess I would wait until my friend arrived to decide. A mere few minutes later my friend arrived and opted for outdoor seating, but we were told we had to sit in the bar because the patio was getting packed. Huh? Seriously?! We didn't make a big deal out of it and followed the guy to the bar area. He abruptly led us to our table, then quickly disappeared. Um, well ok. Initially, we came for the Chow Down Midtown menu, which consisted of 3 courses for $16. Not too shabby, but on Thursday's all burgers are $7. Even BETTER deal. So my friends and I decided to order some appetizers and burgers. My friends ordered the fried pickle fries, The Speedway (burger with pulled pork) and The BBQ Bacon Burgers. I am not a fan of pickles, so I ordered the egg roll appetizer and the Jerk Turkey Burger. My friends enjoyed the pickle fries. The egg rolls were okay. Kind of an odd concoction of sauerkraut, corned beef, and swiss cheese. It wasn't bad, but again, not memorable. Our appetizers came out a short while later. Oddly enough the guy who brought out our entree's didn't bother to pick up our empty appetizer trays, so our table was a bit cluttered I thought that was so odd. Anyhoo, my turkey burger was pretty good. I enjoyed the pineapple mango salsa. The jerk sauce was good, but they used way too much. It was a tad bit overwhelming. My friends enjoyed their burgers. They were big and messy, as a burger should be. The fries were also piping hot and delish. The food is just ok. The customer service is seriously lacking. Also, I know the employees must prep the bar, but the guy was so loud as he put away the wine bottles plus he kept dropping stuff. They could use a Service 101 lesson from Carson over at Usual Suspects. He always makes my experience there so great.

The melted Swiss cheese, the grilled sweet pineapple, the BBQ sauce. Don't let me forget the toasted bun. The tater tots were hot and crispy. The outside gloden brown and crispy. The burgers are a good size...I should have cut it in half. But I was being greedy thinking I would eat it all. \u00a0I couldn't...I didn't even eat all my tots.

Had to try them. Jumped at the opportunity.Four of my colleagues and I struck out to have the 317 experience early-ish one fine work day. We may have actually been the first in the building for lunch. Promptly seated, we were handed abbreviated menus. Huh? What happened to the menu options online? The duck fat fries were still an option, but several of the selections made by my colleagues the previous day were not. We queried our server to find out that the abbreviated menu was rolled out that morning. Ok. That kind of stuff happens. We decided to just roll with it. There were still quite a few appealing options available.Imagine our surprise and delight when our server returned to inform us that the kitchen would be happy to provide us anything off the full menu! Wowsers! We hadn't even asked and yet here we were showered in accommodation. Serious thumbs up on this one!!We started with the Reuben Egg Rolls. Delightful. Actually, the egg rolls themselves were just good. The obviously homemade 1000 Island sauce was outstanding. This settles this item smack in the middle with delightful. We also shared an order of the duck fat fries. They were...good fries. Nothing spectacular, nor that different from just your run of the mill good fries. They weren't all that different from their regular fries, to be honest.But the burgers. Oh. The. Burgers. I ordered The Monon, a burger topped with hot bacon glaze, grilled apples, and provolone. I love all of those things, yet never thought of combining them into a burger topping. Only one word can describe the gymnastics performed on my tastebuds at first bite. Stellar. Just an out of this world experience from first bite to last. I was fortunate to be able to also try a bite or two of the Strawberry Hill. So sweet and spicy! I've not always had good experiences with ghost pepper cheese, but this was a real winner! All seemed to enjoy their selections. I was too full to try a bite of my colleague's mac-n-cheese, but I am regretting that now. It looked so creamy and delicious. He still talks about how good it was when we chat about that meal. Definitely will be trying that next time around.The only slight mishap was the service. A bit slow for a work day meal. We received our apps before our drinks, which was a tad weird for as empty as the place was at that time. The gentleman also repeatedly let us know he does not typically work for this establishment. He said he doesn't eat the burgers, but was a big fan of the reuben bites, which was a bit concerning at first. All of that aside, the food was great and I can't wait to go back.

We were quickly seated and given a back area patio seat so people wouldn't walk by the dog frequently. We order poutine as an appetizer, drinks, burgers. I got the speedway with bison, medium rare, and my wife got a regular beef burger, medium well. That combo is usually a death sentence for my bison, but not this time. Both were. Both were cooks perfectly, the poutine was delicious (oh the gravy), and the drinks were local and kept fresh. Overall, my only wish is that they had a slightly lower price point. Maybe it's a fair price, but I feel like they are 5% too high high just rubs me the wrong way when the check comes.

I'm not saying it wasn't good, it was. But it was not the best burger in the 317 area code as the name would suggest. The fries were better than the burger.

No. But, if I were out with a group of people and we happened to find ourselves there, I wouldn't complain."], ["Eddie C.", "First of all that was fast.

I guess if burgers are mostly what you do and you have a fairly concise menu, you can get the food out pretty quickly.Thursdays seem to be a good night to check out 317. $6 burgers and pint night ($3.50/pint). There are enough variations so it will take a minute to decide, and the different toppings keep the burgers interesting. I went with the BBQ Bacon which netted a couple extra onion rings in addition to the side of fries. The patty was a little dry, but that's a product of me wanting a more well-done burger.The beer selection is fine for what you would call a taproom. During my visit, there were 16 taps of mostly pale ales and hoppy beers. I did find a wheat beer I haven't had before, and went with that since I wasn't into heavy beers that evening.I think 317 Burger strikes a pretty good medium between the college bars and the fine dining scene in Broad Ripple. It has chill atmosphere that's not too loud but still close enough to the action."], ["Megan L.", "My coworkers and I had dinner here as a part of our ladies night. Omega, our waitress, was very nice and super accommodating with our 50,000 questions. We started with the app sampler, the Fried Mac n' Cheese is delish! Definitely my fav. Two of us had the 317 burger, the other three had the Cantina burger. They actually know how to cook a medium burger, much to my delight. Most places just grill the heck out of the beef, but mine arrived nicely pink, yay! The fries were so, so good. Hand cut, super thick, not that shoestring crap. My only tiny complaint is their lack of desserts, other than that, I'll definitely be back."], ["Rob S.", "Pountines and Country fried bacon are both heart stoppers and great appetizers. All of the burgers we ordered were very tasty. \u00a0The breakfast burger was an awesome combination of half bacon and half ground beef but came on a croissant with an egg. Great selection of draft beers and each were $5."], ["Claire H.", "Super good food, super good service, and all the beers are only $5. They have a good beer selection, too - they always have something that I'm surprised to see on tap. It's quickly becoming our Sunday afternoon go-to."], ["Bill D.", "Great burgers, better than Bru burger IMHO. Be sure you go Thursday like I did for the $7 burgers, you can't beat it."], ["Tony J.", "We may go back perhaps for the poutine (brown gravy on side was pretty nice) and choice of al fresco dining and people watching. But as for the burgers, not so much. The bbq bacon and veggie burgers we had last time just didn't quite make a mark."], ["Jelly R.", "I had the \"Barbecue Bacon Burger\" ($12) as a bison burger (add $2), and added extra barbecue sauce (which was pretty spicy, and left me teary-eyed). The burger was good, but in hindsight I'm not sure it was worth $14 (though that is the going rate of bison burgers at comparable places like Scotty's, so it's not like they're out of line with the competition. . . I guess I just miss the cheaper and equally artery-clogging Boogie Burger ever since it moved away from the heart of Broad Ripple). The fries that came with the burger were also very good, and I kicked myself for not trying the poutine. . .Some of the other reviews stated service was bad, but we actually received really great service: The two waiters working the patio area seemed to be working as a team and helping each other out with their customers. Overall a good experience."], ["Brandon R.", "Great food but questionable management. 317 is 1 of my favorite burger spots in the city. The only restaurant w/ the 50/50 bacon & ground beef patties. Duck fat fries & poutine are literally gifts from God. Fried mac & cheese balls, chicken fried bacon, funnel cake fries... the list goes on. My favorite is the breakfast burger. Originally the gravy was served on the burger but now it comes on the side. They've switched to these small trays which barely has enough room for your food. They seem under staffed & none of the employees show any sense of urgency when serving customers... But it's all worth it for a great burger"], ["Richard P.", "\"That one is yours.\" The words struck me as odd. They were almost funny in the flippant sort of way in which they were delivered. They were the words spoken by a male server to Laura, the young woman who would become my server, and they were clearly directed toward me as a determination of who would be serving me during my late afternoon stop at 317 Burger in Broad Ripple this afternoon. Now then, I understand that no real insult was intended by this casual, flippant comment. I get it. I understand that it was considered merely as a sort of \"direction\" toward another in determining table responsibilities. Again, I get it. Here's the thing. It was tacky. VERY tacky. It was also offensive. In fact, I don't know a single human being who likes to be referred to as \"that one\" and that is, without question, a direct quote as I almost immediately wrote it down. It was a rough way to start my first visit to 317 Burger, a gourmet burger joint I'd wanted to visit for quite some time but had always avoided because I abhor the Broad Ripple scene. Okay, it's not Broad Ripple I abhor. It's excessive paid parking, crass commercialization, and predatory towing. Then again, these days that is Broad Ripple. 317 Burger is a burger joint on Westfield Boulevard with its companion None the Wiser Tap Room Bar right next door. Weekends tend to be a little more relaxed with the parking situation, particularly on a day like today when the Broad Ripple Art Fair was nearby and quite active. There's a notice in 317 that they now offer parking, though I didn't explore that any further and can't tell you much about it. As you should probably guess, 317 Burger emphasizes burgers but you can stay healthy by trading out turkey or a veggie option at no charge. For a $2 upcharge, you can try the Red Frazier Bison - I was tempted but opted to keep things pretty simple this first time around. They offer a variety of specialty burgers ranging from $10-13 and all including an order of hand-cut fries. You can also get a gluten free bun upon request. They also serve appetizers, poutine, tenderloin, B.L.T., and a pulled pork sandwich. They have a variety of extras for sandwiches and there are other sides you can choose for a $2 upcharge. Most of this building, the old Ambrosia building, has been pretty decently renovated. The sidewalks have curb cuts and the front entrance is wide enough for a wheelchair, though the door itself is fairly heavy. As I went in, there was a sign saying to \"seat yourself.\" I looked around and opted for a seemingly comfortable room with lots of warm woods, a television showing sports, and a variety of tables and booths. I noticed that the room had an elevated section up one step and all the booths were too high for wheelchair use. There were a handful of tables that worked and nobody flinched when I took a four-top toward the window. They also offer outdoor dining. I decided to splurge a bit and allow myself a hamburger, though I've been avoiding red meat. I figured a non-processed burger was the way to go. I ordered the \"American,\" which amounted to a cheeseburger along with the fries for $10. I, of course, ordered my iced tea. My meal was interrupted for at least 20-25 minutes by the constant shrieking of a nearby child whose parents obviously hadn't learned it was acceptable to address your child's behavior in public. It made my desired quiet meal and Sunday paper reading more challenging, though this was certainly not much fault of the restaurant. I had to chuckle when another father entered with yet another crying child - fortunately this parent understood it was acceptable to parent and the behavior was addressed effectively. My server, Laura, was friendly and helpful. In fact, I believe she tossed in the iced tea on a complimentary basis and that was certainly appreciated. I did get my refill and she didn't seem to be rushing me out the door. While the timing lagged a bit at times, she was friendly and helpful and never referred to me as \"that one.\" The burger was good, definitely fresh and tasty and delivered as ordered. The fries are lightly browned and served in a decent order size. I have no problem calling this a gourmet burger, though it wasn't an upper echelon one for me. That said, I enjoyed it and would easily order it again. The fries were fairly standard fries, though they complemented the sandwich well. If I had my way, the rating would be a 3.5. This was a good meal for a good price with good service and a good atmosphere. It wasn't stellar, but it also wasn't average despite the rough start. That said, I can't get myself to push the rating up to a 4-star review as 4-star signifies \"very good\" for me and this was simply \"good.\" So, I have to curve downward this time yet acknowledge that it's on the high end of the 3-star rating. 317 isn't a destination spot, but it's worth a spot if you're in the neighborhood."], ["Tavia B.", "Their long patio is a perfect spot to plop down and enjoy some Broad Ripple people watching. Their 317 burger was very tasty - it's been a month or so since I had it and I recall being impressed with how juicy and flavorful it was. I quite enjoyed their seasoned fries - the fiance felt they were too much, but for me there can never be too much seasoning on fries, chips, and the like. Service was friendly and they had a good selection of tasty beers. Our server didn't mind offering suggestions and samples."], ["Karhma D.", "Every time, dry burgers. This latest time, our server had one other table. ONE. She dropped off our food & we didn't see her until our food was already eaten. My grilled onions were still crunchy. Apparently, the mac n cheese is really good, according to my husband and baby daughter. Dairy intolerant, so I can't vouch for it. Their garlic aioli was basically garlic paste, no mayo-esque quality to it. For a $13 lunch, there's way better options. Recap: dry burger, non existent service. Oh yeah, a weird trivial thing, but annoying. Their to-go containers are too small for their sandwiches! A half a grilled cheese won't even fit in it. Our server made no offer to help, so we wrapped it in the greasy basket liner."], ["Kim K.", "I'm always in search of the best burger, and love exploring different burger joints. After leaving a crowded, loud restaurant deck, 317 Burger was just what we we're looking for. They have a pretty spectacular beer selection. We kicked our evening off with the fried Mac n Cheese: HOLY MACARONI. Crunchy outside, gooey inside, and gently resting in even more melted cheese. These were awesome dipped in the sauce that accompanied them. Don't be fooled, they may be small, but goodness are they filling!And then our burgers came, and BOY, does 317 deliver. I got the Strawberry Hill burger: it was a sweet, spicy love affair from the first bite. The strawberry compote, the peanut butter, the Goose the Market jowl bacon; all tucked under a slice of ghost pepper cheese: DYNAMITE! Loved this killer combination! The hand cut french fries that accompanied it we're the perfect pairing. The best part? Thursdays, all burgers are $5 off!"], ["Alexandrea P.", "Dined in on a slow Saturday late afternoon. The 317 poutine is great. The location and decor inside is ok.. The music and vibe could use a little more flavor-kind of boring. The burgers we chose were black bean and Bison, good but did not notice anything amazing about it. Overall a nice joint mainly because of the poutine! and available seating/as this place doesn't seem to get too crowded, which is a nice change in ripple. Owner seems like he's really trying to have a nice neighborhood establishment so kudos to the hard work. The rest of the staff was not impressive. Slow and seemingly uninterested in giving good service."], ["Sigrid F.", "Took a group 12 here and was very happy with food and service here. However, parking in this area on a Friday night is simply atrocious. We had some of the fried mac n t balls, which were delicious. \u00a0Crunchy outside, cheesy mac inside, all of it floating in a dish of melty cheese, yummiest. .. but there was some sweet red stuff on it that tasted like jelly. .. that just didn't go well with it.Tried the Ruben egg rolls, interesting concept and not bad. \u00a0They come with Thousand Island dressing and are worth trying. The deep fried bacon was disappointing. .. ikr... how can this be? \u00a0Bacon and deep fried has heaven written all over it, but it wasn't so. Whatever breading was on there just overpowered the bacon taste, so not a fan. The 317burger was simply what a burger should be. Big juicy cheesy bacony ... and that garlic aeoli gave this concoction a nice umph .The waiter was sporting the recently popular again lumberjack look and was on it with refills and such. \u00a0He also managed to get all these separate bills taken care of without any errors. Altogether a wonderful evening with great food."], ["N H.", "So happy!First, we stopped by on a Thursday where all burgers are $7 (a steal when the burgers are $11-$13!). I got the 317 burger, which has 4 kinds of cheese and garlic aioli.Mmmmmm! Plus, I asked for pickles on the side and got a whole bunch. Note to pickle fans: These are delicious and like none other. Simply put: the burger was so delicious. Perfect.Even better? The hand-cut fries. I mean, sometimes fries are fries...but these? WOW. Amazing. I was so sad when my meal was ended :)They do 3 oz (or so) beer samples for $1.75 since there is an attached brewery. The one wheat from Beligium that I tried was tasty.Service was a bit slow, but they were training someone new and the waiter seemed busy rather than lazy, so I'm not too bothered by it. However, the waiter was SO nice and energetic, and both he and the trainee did a great job with refills."], ["Julianna Y.", "If you load burgers this is a cool place to check out. I had their 50-50 burger and it was amazing.

We appreciate too that the outdoor patio is dog friendly. The burgers are outstanding as is the service. I had never eaten fried mac and cheese until I tried it here - delicious. This place is worth your time and money."], ["Kyle R.", "317 Burger is the best burger in Indianapolis, and any blind taste test would agree. The juiciness of the Angus beef accompanied by multiple different burger options make a delectable meal. This is one of the few burger places that when you ask for the burger \"Medium Rare\" it comes out MR. Also, if you never had Poutine, TRY IT! This Poutine reminds me of Old Montreal. Poutine is a Canadian delicacy but 317 is making it a Midwest/Indianapolis staple."], ["Krista R.", "Alright, so we gave this place another go.Issues: my medium burger was well done. Bummer. The waitress never came back to check on us, so I didn't have the option of sending it back.The menu describes the onions as caramelized. They were steamed and slimy. Again, I would have spoken to the waitress had she returned. Goose the Market bacon now available, pretty happy about that.Sides of onion rings and fries are now at a lower price point (sweet), but the onion rings were obviously frozen/not homemade. I wouldn't get them again. Fries were solid.The outdoor seating is nice, they have a cocktail menu now (all around $10).All in all this place is too $$ for the quality, and the service was a miss. It's a shame, \u00a0but the kitchen simply needs to churn out better, more consistent food. We won't be back."], ["Jason T.", "Let me start off by saying that the Decour is absolutely amazing. Whoever decorated this place has great taste. The food on the other hand is not quite as tasteful, french fries both times I've been where overdone and not the best. and what kind of burger joint does not have milkshakes on the menu? Well this one... Sad ! Every time I've been the place has been pretty much empty, I don't see this place staying in business for a long time. Service is good although ! The food is pretty much mediocre and kind of overpriced. I think they could do better"], ["Stanley A.", "What's in a dining experience? location, service, food... right? Am I missing something. I drive by 317 4-5 times a week, and have meant to stop in and try it. And, based on all the gushing reviews... REALLY wanted to stop in and try it. Well, today was the day. I must confess full houses at both my other go-to burger joints was the motivating factor. That said, today was 317 inauguration. I took my daughter and she had, as is her custom, a plain hamburger. This is good because it is pure and unadulterated; therefor, you taste the burger for the burger--more on that in a minute. I went for the namesake burger, the \"317 Burger,\" which has bacon, a laundry list of different cheeses and their signature garlic aioli on a brioche bun. Okay to the quick and dirty... location = 5. service = 3.5. food = 3.5. That averages out to 3.8 with a infinite carrying 3. That's probably about right. My rule is everybody gets three shots before making a case for or against unless it is superbly spectacular or dismally terrible the first trip. The burger itself was okay, not great... okay. I took a small bite of my daughters just to get the burger taste. Again, good, okay, but not spectacular. The brioche bun was a little dryish, which definitely took away from the overall burger experience. The fries were delish! We both agreed on that. Apparently the duck fat produces a crispy outer layer with a velvety texture on the inside. So, to get the 3.5 for food: burger 3, fries 4.The service wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. It just... was. I seem to have a knack for going places at the \"between shifts\" time. The waitress was pleasant enough, but not very attentive. Since it was my inaugural visit, I would have appreciated a little song and dance explanation. I wouldn't have know about the duck fat and aioli and were it not for other reviewers. It is definitely good enough to come back for a sophomore season."], ["Megan O.", "All you need to know is that the poutine fries are addictive, and the cheese on the 317 burger itself is amazing! You can either order an app of poutine fries, or you can actually get them as a side to your burger for a small up charge. Regular fries come with the burger for free. The interior is clean, TVs show whatever game is on, and 317 Burger has has a great summer patio. We went to this place after checking out the Pint Room in Carmel, and I definitely prefer 317 Burger to The Pint Room. 317's burgers are about $3 cheaper, and the great beer selection costs less too. I also prefer this place over Bru Burger on Mass Ave, because Bru's burgers don't come with fries."], ["Kacy G.", "The burgers on the menu all sound amazing and creative. \u00a0We were disappointed as all of ours at the table were overcooked and the awesomeness on the page didn't seem to translate to the plate. \u00a0For us, the highlight of the meal was the Dirty Wings. \u00a0Seriously delicious. \u00a0They will bring us back there and hope we have a better burger experience. \u00a0Pros:-good apps-large beer selection -spacious, good atmosphere Cons:-burgers overcooked and nothing spectacular for a place where burgers are their main menu item"], ["Joe G.", "The wife and I visited this fine establishment last night and were very pleased.

Yeah! We started with the poutine. I'd heard of this gravy, cheese curd & French fry concoction before, but was always a bit too wary to try. If that's you, run, don't walk, to 317! A delightfully rich gravy with salty fries and mild cheese curds...yummy! I got the 317 burger - American, Gouda, provolone, Swiss, peppered bacon & garlic aioli. My only complaint is that I would have liked the bacon to be a bit more well done. Also, a little lettuce, tomato & onion would have offset the richness of the cheeses. Overall though it was a great burger! I didn't eat the fries that came with it after the poutine, but that's ok, I was stuffed! The hubs got the breakfast burger with a 50/50 beef & bacon blend, a fried egg, gravy & cheese on a croissant bun. He said it was the best version of this burger he'd ever had - and that's a lot from a guy whose highest form of praise is generally \"not bad.\" He chose the chili as his side and liked it, but it wasn't my style.

First off, if you like a good burger, this is the place. Hands down. I say that for several reasons.First, is a combo reason. If you have kids, you can take them here, and enjoy good food and a brew. If you don't have kids, you can sit in a bar area that is kid free, and still enjoy good food and a brew(s).Second punch, is the burgers. Fantastic. There are reviews of \"bland\", or \"overcooked\". I don't get it. We sat on the bar side, had a great bartender who offered up a fantastic beer/wine list. We enjoyed our tasty beverages, then she ordered the 317 burger medium, and ordered the American, but \"upgrade\" to bison. Ordered mine medium as well, and we were both beyond pleased. The 317, as you've proly read in other reviews has a buncha different cheeses, garlic aioli sauce, and it was just perfect. My bison was beyond stellar. Cooked perfectly, moist, slightly gamey, and very very tender. Just fantastic.Now the third, and knockout punch. POUTINE......and I mean GOOOOOOOD poutine! As of the past some odd years, poutine has made it's way to American cuisine, and has become a popular menu item in Indy. I've been spoiled having authentic poutine for a long, long time, and that makes me a bit of a snob/connoisseur...of sorts. That being said, I've had this dish in many places around town. And it's ALWAYS the same thing....\"here's OUR version of poutine\"....blah blah blah...just friggin make it already! The hardest thing about making good poutine is using good curds. Well, this place has nailed it! OUTSTANDING! After we started in on our order, we both said \"we could just eat this and call it a meal\". Well done 317!I've read reviews about how the menu used to be more extensive, etc., but I really don't understand why you want 50 ways to eat a burger...they have plenty of options, IMO. And moreover, if you need a ton of stuff on your burger to hide the taste of a burger, what the hell are ya doin' eating a burger to begin with? Beers, great poutine, and great burgers.

The serving size of the fries is huge and we split it between 3 people no problem. \u00a0 I might go back to 317 Burger to give it another try but there are enough burger places around town that I think they need to step up their game."], ["Sara P.", "We visited on a busy weekend night, but only had about a 10-minute wait, which went by quickly after killing time in the bar and ordering a Left Hand milk stout. The beer list was not huge, but had a nice mix of craft beers to choose from. \u00a0I liked the cow-minimalism d\u00e9cor on the restaurant side. Service was congenial, but not super-memorable. Ignoring previous reviewers' warnings, I ordered the lamb burger, lured by the \"fennel jam\". \u00a0The burger was under-seasoned and cooked a few shades beyond the requested medium rare, but I was able to finish it with help from the fennel slaw (not too jam-like) and goat cheese topping. My dining partner enjoyed his create-your-own option, with a beef burger, blue cheese, caramelized onions, and garlic aioli. \u00a0This may be one of those gourmet-lite burger places where it is safer to stay \"inside the box\" and go for that beef patty. \u00a0I usually love trying unique, wacky-type flavor combinations, but none of the remaining \"Signature\" items really appealed to me. Might I suggest something with kimchi on it? Drool.We also ordered the duck fat fries, at my insistence (life goal=consume duck fat \"something\"). \u00a0Don't be thrown by these fries' darker brown color and slightly different taste; we easily finished the whole order, but skipped over the too-sweet, cinnamon-tinged marinara sauce that accompanied the fries. It stinks that the sides are $4 extra, but the portions are large enough that you could realistically split a side or appetizer between 2-3 persons. \u00a0We'd visit again to try the poutine (!), fried spinach, and more create-your-own experiments, hopefully finding something more extraordinary to bump up the experience to 4 stars."], ["Brooklynn B.", "Didn't catch the servers name but he did fantastic with all of the tables he had.

Both were excellent and flavorful. We also we in a rush and the server was super kind and accommodating. Would definitely come back here."], ["Bodie S.", "I want to start this review off by saying one thing: country fried bacon. In all honesty, it might be one of the greatest things I've ever put in my mouth. You'd be a fool to come here and not order it. Order it as an appetizer! A meal! A snack! Order it will country gravy and dip until your heart's content. If I didn't like her so much, I may have fought my girlfriend for the whole stack of fried meat.Definitely sit outside if it's a nice day. We sat outside and watched the world go by as we stuffed delicious burgers into our mouths. They have a pretty decent beer selection, and they're fairly priced, and are on a rotating menu. We split an order of the duck fat fries and I was extremely pleased with them. If there's \"fat\" in the title, then it must taste good. I ordered one of their signature burgers, the None the Wiser, which was made of ground steak topped with pineapple, jalapenos, Swiss, bacon, and BBQ sauce. I loved it. The sweetness of the pineapple really complimented the jalapenos. My girlfriend ordered the Parthenon burger. It was made of a gyro blended meat topped with feta cheese, casba sauce, gyro bacon, in a pita bun. She was a happy girl! They also have the option to make your own burger, which I thought was a neat idea for a signature burger place. If you get fries, definitely pick a few sauces to dip; the garlic aioli, sweet chili, and chipotle mayo were my favorites."], ["Sarah F.", "Another new burger place? I was skeptical but I couldn't ignore the hype that seemed to flow toward me from all avenues. Within 48 hours of their doors opening to the public I was receiving the simple, straightforward, unconditional (read: bordering obnoxious) message from all my friends: You've gotta try this place! Go now to 317, they said. Order a steak burger, they said. You must experience the delicious food coma, they said. I did as I was told and, as I write to you from the comfort of elastic-waistband pajama pants, I can say that I have no regrets!! First off, the beer selection did not disappoint. My partner and I each had a pint of the Pride and Joy mild ale. Next, we ordered the duck fat fries. At first bite I was a little taken aback...then I settled into the flavor and really enjoyed them. It was my next discovery that made the entire trip worthwhile, however. You see, 317 makes their own ketchup in house. It's slightly sweet and almost reminds me of a vodka marinara pasta sauce (can't exactly explain why). But it's ketchup. When I went all-out British on my fries by putting mayo on them, I was pleased! I decided to try mayo and house-made ketchup together and let me tell you that the combination made me want to LIVE FOREVER! Duck fat fry + mayo + 317 ketchup = winning flavor combination!!A friend said he had tried the double burger but it was so big he couldn't eat anything else with it (as in no sides). My dining partner was a champion because he had the double steak burger with ch\u00e8vre, applewood smoked bacon, and grilled onion and still managed to eat fries and half a beer. Way to do it! That double burger was huge. Really huge! And delicious! He thought the burger patty was a little more dry than he had anticipated, but I felt like it was a matter of leanness and the fact that the burger wasn't greasy. Different strokes maybe? You will have to be the judge of that on your own. I had the single steak burger with avocado, chipotle mayo, and bacon. I ate exactly half of it. This made me remember a mantra I once heard: You can't call it a gourmet burger unless you have to cut it in half to eat it. I think it's safe to say that all of the burgers at 317 pass that test. I would like to return for several reasons. They are, in no particular order, the wonderful atmosphere inside the dining area, the fantastic service, and my need to try the Mac n cheese as well as the non-steak burgers! There are fish options, chicken options, and veggie options for those that aren't keen on red meat. A fun new place in Broad Ripple! I recommend giving it a try!"], ["Deirdre G.", "Some friends and \u00a0I went here last night, braving the winter weather. What's really cool is how they let you sample beers before you settle on one to order; I asked to sample Pride & Joy and Golden Monkey, settling on the former. For my meal, I ordered the 317 burger and an order of poutine, which I had never tried before. I liked both (probably because I was starving), but a lot of my friends were none too impressed by the place, so my two-star rating is based on the fact that you'll either really like this place or hate it (and it also appears to be that way on Yelp, too). As far as service is concerned, our server was a little scatterbrained, but then again, we were a group of ten, so it's understandable."], ["Fabian R.", "I invited some new friends who have recently moved to Indy for dinner this past weekend, as they have not visited Broad Ripple and were in the mood for some good food and beer. Having had my bachelor party dinner there I knew the food and drink selection would be good. We ordered some drinks and an appetizer, and eventually ordered our burgers. The appetizer never came but was later brought with the entrees. While this could have been upsetting, our server Chad was very apologetic and even comped the wings we ordered as an app!!! His service and courtesy for our situation was amazing and he turned a potential bad situation into a good one and we didn't even have to ask him to do it.

I had a Cobb salad which came, inexplicably, with a burger on it. Great salad. Husband had a 317 burger which he inhaled. The three kids with us each had a burger and fries.

You have to. You must. Why only the three stars, you ask? \u00a0The service. Inattentive, slow and devoid of personality. Questions were met with a blank stare followed by what was usually a non-answer. No drink suggestions, no dessert suggestions and the server committed my pet peeve of ALL pet peeves when he brought the bill without asking, and there was still food on the table. We'll return. But we'll avoid the first server.

The staff was very friendly but the food took forever to come out which was frustrating because there were not many people there. \u00a0My favorite part of the dinner were actually the cocktails which was a surprise considering I think this place was associated with a brewery or something.

It's spring in Indy and all of a sudden I was craving a burger! This place hit the spot. I don't eat red meat, and they nailed it with their veggie burger (which is often hard to find in Indy). It was served just how I like it - loaded with tons of veggies including huge chunks of fresh avocado, roasted red pepper and the traditional - cheese, onions, tomato, lettuce. Love that they offer gluten free options too. Actually options all around (can customize your own burger), which is always a good thing in my book.

Sometimes it feels cool and hip, but sometimes it seems so stuffy. The crowd is pretty weird sometimes, too.. difficult to describe.Service is hit or miss. I've had one really great waitress outside on the patio, but that's where the greatness ends. The drinks are pretty tasty - I've had a champagne cocktail that was lovely, a frozen Moscow mule, and their spiked cider. Prices are pretty steep ($10-12), so this is the kind of place you probably don't want to stay drinking at all night. They did recently have a burrata cheese and fig dish that was pretty on point; I haven't tried any of their other food. I'll definitely give it another chance because of the quality of the drinks, but I still think I'd pick other cocktail bars in the city over this one."], ["Januarie Y.", "So I start this with the fact that I may or may not have been trolling the B&B cocktail menu for a few weeks now. I've long heard about them and wanted to go and randomly a few nights ago, me and my sister went! Atmosphere: It was a Friday night and considering it's summer and Mass Ave, the small inside was packed tight with people. There was literally no where to sit except outside, which was fine by me. Their open patio section and snooty drinks intrigued my inner-snoot and I embraced the experience of the wrap around wood bench. There were a few other patrons outside having their individual conversations with each other and me and my sister sat close to the sidewalk (aka Mass Ave Foot Traffic). It was a light rainy night, so door attendant rolled down the decorative 'shutters' (idk what to formally call those). We used them as a cool backdrop and I loved the design of bookcases and fine bottles combined with the ability to still see a little bit straight thru them. Another guest offered to take a picture of me and my sister. Points for cool people !!!! #CoolKidsClub Drinks: I ordered the Sidecar and my sister ordered the Rooftop (?). I was going with something fluffier and fruitier but I figured for sake of where I was (Snoot levels - 8 on scale 1-10), I'd venture out and try something different. The Sidecar is Cognac infused with \"other stuff\", but whatever it all was turned out AMAZING!!! Did I say great? Yes GREAT !!!!! OMG?? Yes, all the OMGs allotted for a bar drink go here. Yes. So the drinks are a little pricey. Yes. But worth it. This is the kind of drink I don't mind paying for. Nevermind that artistically cool drink menu that they have. I wish I were richer for these simple delights right here. I wanted more but we were both balling on a diva budget of hopeful dollars and glitter quarters, so we limited ourselves appropriately. I sipped slowly. I was pleased. Alcohol perfection pleased. It's quite possibly the best drink I've had in Indy. Yeah I said that. Highly effective Snooty Fox levels!!!!! Food: We also indulged in some bacon. How could we pass up Siracha Bacon and Honey Maple Bourbon Bacon on a stick ? We couldn't, that's how !!! So we indulged and guess what???**Snoot levels rise to elevated status. High alert. People should beware of extended pinky fingers and exposed cheese and croissant-like crackers!! ** Ok that was dramatic. But the bacon was dramatic. And the water was served in tall glass Vases. Overall, I mean what else can I say here? I gave it five stars. I expected a great time and a good drink here and have been repeatedly talking about it over the last few weeks (and couple of years). Finally I go and it didn't disappoint. THAT is what you call an Elite experience, with High Levels of Snoot !!!"], ["Zenobia W.", "I really enjoy The Ball & Biscuit's cocktails. Definitely a great date spot as the facility is very dimly lit and intimate if you dig that kinda vibe. Most of my favorite drinks are no longer on the menu, but that's okay! I've never been dissatisfied by the new flavor combos they create. I think my only issue is that it can be suuuper yuppie, which who cares really, but I just tend to feel out of place in that setting. Barely worth mentioning though, drinks are superb!

Kinda lost our mojo so we only stayed for 1 drink!"], ["Steve D.", "This happened several months ago, but the more I think about the experience, the more ridiculous it seems.My wife and I planned to start a weekend getaway with cocktails here. We arrived at opening time to find the bar closed for a private bourbon tasting--disappointing, because I'm a bourbon fan and would have enjoyed taking part--but we decided to pass the time at the nearby Irish pub.So we returned an hour later, bellied up to the handsome bar, decided upon two cocktails, placed our order and...were asked to show our IDs.Now I must pause to say that no one with the gift of eyesight who is not taking Thorazine would question that we are of legal age. We have a daughter who can drink anywhere in the country when she chooses, and we were in our 30s when we she was born. I can show Facebook photos establishing that we were married 25 years ago. Even if my wife had been a zygote then (and thankfully she wasn't, because finding a wedding dress for a zygote must be pretty difficult), she would still be well past the legal drinking age now. But she didn't happen to have her ID, and the server refused to place our order.We were later told that Indiana law penalizes liquor servers for selling to anyone who does not show valid ID, regardless of their age, and that agents frequently run sting operations. Seems like an asinine waste of time and money in pursuit of persons who have committed no crime, and not a civic failure I can blame on our server. But I can blame her for treating us like a couple of pariahs. After refusing to serve us, she just physically turned her back. We were the only people in the bar besides the Four Roses sales reps, who were still packing up after the bourbon tasting. After several minutes in which we were discussing what to do next, trying to convince ourselves we hadn't stumbled into an episode of The Twilight Zone, she turned around, looking annoyed, saying \"So are you guys going to order something?\" Like what?

My favourite drink was made with a rose liquor and had an edible flower in it which was sweet and delicious. My boyfriends favourite is called \"The Maya\". It comes in a skull mug. Looking around at the other tables I realized a lot of the orders use the mug as presentation, which is really cool. I feel like it sort of adds to the experience.We did not try any bar food since we had just had dinner, but we will come back to try it some time, since it looked very tempting.I feel like the service was great, the bartender was very helpful and very friendly."], ["Amber C.", "Dark corners, leather furniture, and candlelight? \u00a0I'm IN!I happened across The Ball & Biscuit quite by accident. \u00a0A friend and I were heading to one of our favorite spots, but it was unusually crowded on this particular evening. \u00a0(Side note: \u00a0don't you hate when people finally discover your secret hideaways?). \u00a0I was pleasantly surprised by The Ball & Biscuit.The decor was exactly what you'd expect in a classed-up tavern. \u00a0Think mood music, leather arm chairs that you can get lost in, minimal lighting, and a perfectly retro bar. \u00a0This seems like the place that you might meet a clandestine lover or make super-secret power deals that may or may not be under the table. \u00a0That's not negative at all, it's a great feel and perfectly fits the prohibition history of Indy.I had the pleasure to enjoy a seasonal cheese plate and was duly satisfied. \u00a0My cheeses were very fresh and my crostini was perfectly crisp and served warm. \u00a0My friend ordered a moscow mule type drink and was satisfied, if not overwhelmed or particularly impressed.I suspect I happened across The Ball & Biscuit on an unusually quiet night. \u00a0I'd be interested to see how it looks/feels during one of it's more characteristic busy spells. \u00a0Next time, perhaps!"], ["Sarah N.", "Great little bar. \u00a0I'm not a local to Indy, but can enjoy cool, little bars that are not about sports and have a true urban feel. \u00a0Ambiance and decor are comfortable and cool, industrial lighting, dark leathers, mixologist inspired drinks and a good selection of tap beers. \u00a0Weather you gather with friends around one of their low top tables with big chairs or belly up to the bar, this bar is a great intimate, hip spot in the downtown landscape. \u00a0 It is not a gigantic bar, but would be good for a group or a date.There appeared to be a small dining room off to the side too that you could sit down at a normal table and eat something too."], ["Mary T.", "Asking someone if they want to meet you for a drink at Ball & Biscuit makes you appear to have a refined palate with a heir of maturity that could only come from sipping handcrafted cocktails on Mass Ave in a dimmed lighting setting that not only flows with the theme of the lounge but also is extremely flattering. B&B is a relaxed environment reflected in their seating choice will includes traditional uptight tables, ample seating at the bar but also spacious and sleek couches that invite you to stay snd sip a few drinks amongst good company. The selection is vast and is broken down by the type of spirit featured in the drink. My recommendation includes the cucumber caipiroska - refreshing and light that is subtly sweet. For those who enjoy munching on snacks whilst among the company of friends and vodka - they have a light menu with finger foods perfect for sharing. A staple on Mass Ave that helps round out the other bars, Ball & Biscuit is a winner in my book."], ["Anthony J.", "Great looking place. Kind of limited seating though. Around 6 and already encountered \u00a0some rowdy middle aged people. \u00a0They food. Overpriced and ehh nothing special Beer and cocktails are limited but it is a lounge. They should change their menu around. Less opulence more simple and good. Good to talk for a bit but other than that I would try my lock elsewhere. Doesn't help that the bartender was already straining from just a dozen customers."], ["Cindy G.", "The Ball & Biscuit was probably one of my favorite places on our recent trip to Indy. It felt very much like OTR. Trendy, dim lit, beautiful atmosphere, and damn good cocktails. We came in pretty early around 6:30 and snagged a table near the bar. There are two sides to this place, one more causal and the other feels more intimate and lounge-y. The great thing is you can come dressed up or down. I saw some regulars in shorts and a t shirt while others were in dresses. They do have some food the menu is small but still packs a punch. Known for their signature hot dogs & charcuterie this place was right up our alley. I love small bites to share so we ordered up the artichoke dip and their mac and cheese dog. The artichoke dip came out pipping hot with LOADS of bread (see pic) and was a great bar snack especially for the price point. We then moved onto the mac dog. The hot dog was good quality and the mac and cheese was great, but together I don't know. The mac was a bit overcooked for my taste but had great flavor. It had ham and herbs in it making it very hearty and yummy. I probably would order it again as a side.Now for the cocktails. There is a decent list to choose from and they can probably make you anything you'd like. I opted for a gin drink with cilantro and cucumber, I cannot remember the name but it was very unique. It was really well balanced and the hawaiian red rock salt on the rim of the glass was DIVINE. I would order again in a heartbeat. The bf got a dirty martini and asked for it extra dirty. The first one she brought out was not good, but they happily exchanged it and made a fresh one which was so nice and much appreciated. This place will for sure take care of you! For my second drink I opted for a blackberry champagne cocktail, and although the flavor of the blackberry was super fresh I think there may have been too much simple or some kind of sweetness for my taste. Loved the idea though. The service was phenomenal. Very friendly and knowledgeable, and to be honest, I was surprised given this places reputation of being pretentious, I felt the complete opposite! If you're in Indy, this should be on your list of must-visit spots! I'm a fan."], ["Jon C.", "It really makes me sad to write this review, but tonight was kind of the tipping point for me with Ball & Biscuit. I've been here several times in the past and have had average service with outstanding drinks. Tonight though I wasn't able to even able to get a drink and walked out after 20 minutes of being ignored.I arrived Sunday over Labor Day with two friends around 8:30 in the evening. There were a couple of tables sitting outside as well as three or so tables sitting in the bar. We sat down right away in the bar and waited. About 10 minutes after walking in, someone came by and literally threw a bottle of water on the table; coming back a minute later and throwing glasses at us without a word. Our server? Never came over. 15 minutes or so after we sat down, we saw her. She checked on the tables around us and then went to the bar and had a lengthy conversation with the bartender with her back to us, and then walked off. Unhappy about the entire situation, when she walked out, we did too. Ball & Biscuit is a great place and I really admire their efforts on bringing the craft cocktail back to Indianapolis.. but if the service doesn't get any better, I'm afraid people will turn to the restaurants next door, leaving Ball & Biscuit as empty as a bar during Prohibition that followed the rules."], ["Carol T.", "Overall: Came in search of a high-quality cocktail bar. Turned out to be like every other modern bar that has a limited liquor selection, blasts loud music, and attracts the kind of obnoxious people that order red bulls and Jack Daniels Manhattans. Not all of the bartenders knew how to make traditional, classic cocktails. \u00a0The only reason this place gets 2 stars instead of 1 is because the decor and lighting were nice.Liquor: With respect to gin/genever, I was surprised that they did not have any Genever, Plymouth, or Beefeater's. My particular bartender did not know how to make a Ramos Gin Fizz, Bee's Knees, or French 75, which are all classic gin cocktails that should be in every cocktail bartender's repertoire. \u00a0They had to be made by another bartender (even though the Bee's Knees and French 75 are listed on the online menu). The bartender that ended up making my Ramos Gin Fizz omitted the heavy cream. My companions decided to stick to the published menu. I was not impressed with any of their selections.Tonics: I expected them to have a selection of tonic waters, including Fever Tree."], ["Joanna S.", "Yep. This is as good as it gets. Classy atmosphere, imaginative mixologists and kick ass open air seating. I'll be heading back just as soon as physically possible."], ["Chris P.", "Drinks were ok, but pricey for what you get.

Nice location but better other options in the area."], ["Monnica L.", "I used to love this place and have been a regular over the last couple of years but, sadly, the experience I had last night has soured me. It was a new bartender, at least I hadn't seen him before. I wanted to try the new pineapple martini and was disappointed in what I received and offended by their handling of the situation. First, the glass was only about 1/3 full. If a drink is a smaller portion, use a smaller glass. Then I tasted it and it tasted like watered down pineapple juice. The server took it away and put in my request for another drink. The next thing I knew, the bartender was standing over my friend and I asking for specifics of what was wrong. I told him and he countered, very defensively, that it was \"perfectly made\" and had 2 ounce of vodka (could have fooled me) and said that I would still have to pay for it because he couldn't sell it to someone else.Really?We went back and forth until my friend stepped in. In the end, I was not charged for it, but this experience has definitely soured me. If I am going to pay $11+ for a cocktail it needs to be top notch, or at least better than something I can get at home. Such a disappointment. I hope they can turn things around."], ["Riccardo S.", "With its dark exposed-brick interior, muted lighting reflecting off the lustrous copper bar, and intimate seating in the small dining area, you would be forgiven if you thought you'd walked off Massachusetts Avenue into Paris' Le Tr\u00e8s Particulier or NY's PDT. \u00a0Thankfully, there is no need for reservations to approach the bar or secret entrances through a hotdog shop's phone booth, because you'll be welcomed warmly with no pretension.The Ball and Biscuit was first on a list of spots a friend sent me as \"must visit\" destinations in Indianapolis, and I dropped in looking for a well-made cocktail and something small to nibble on. \u00a0Cory was behind the bar, and after seeing me get lost in the embarrassment of riches to be found in the cocktail menu, asked me what kind of mood I was in (vodka, rum, bourbon, etc). \u00a0We finally settled on a Sazerac, expertly-made and worthy of a return trip on its own merits. \u00a0The food menu was no less a treat. \u00a0I'll never turn down an interesting Mac & Cheese, and this was fantastic. \u00a0With a baked breadcrumb crust on top, garnished with leeks and pasta toeing the line of al dente while covered with rich and gooey cheese, it had everything I wanted. \u00a0I'd paired it with an extraordinary artichoke dip which, while I'd have preferred it to not be chopped so finely, came with more than enough toast points and baguette to be a meal on its own.As the night wound down, Kendall came out and introduced herself as the operating partner of the lounge, and wanted to hear how everything was for me. \u00a0This level of engagement from a proprietor explains why food, drink, and service are all top-notch here. \u00a0I am looking forward to coming back and letting myself be guided through the rest of their menu."], ["Sabrina S.", "This is my favorite spot in Indy to grab a cocktail.

The ambiance is my favorite part. However, this place does get very crowded. The water is severed in old liquor bottle, which I think is supper cool! Our waitress was fantastic.  So, why is this place not my thing? Well, honestly I'm pretty simple in the beverage department. I love craft beer and good bourbon. I typically like my bourbon on the rocks or with coke or sprite depending on what it is. This place is putting pickle juice and all kind of strange things in the drinks. I tried a couple of the whiskey drinks and there were good, not my favorite though. I don't do vodka, EVER! So many of the drinks here were out for me. \u00a0So with that said, their craft cocktails are interesting and worth a try but for now, I'll stick with my plain jane bourbon.

It's hard for me to stray from my usual, narrow list of drinks I get, but I've never regretted my choice here.They have a small choice of plates to snack on that are seriously on point. Their meat and cheese plate was basically the greatest thing I've ever had. The worst part of it was that I had to share it with six other people.

Tip well."], ["Elle A.", "This place was super cool! Very low lighting and exposed brick interior definitely gave this place a little more sophisticated but approachable atmosphere. BUT be prepared for paying for such a neat environment. The cocktails start at $10 and only go up from there and the beers start around $8.

What's my motivation here? How does this seat work?\" This all to say, after a couple of cocktails I knew exactly how to sit/lean.The unfortunate part of this visit was that our waitress didn't know how to make a few drinks - which I would find is OK generally, but don't lie about knowing what a Burnt Martini is if you don't know. Just ask, and they'll usually tell you exactly how to make it.

The crowd was a bit frustrating at first, but it provided a great opportunity to make new friends... which is exactly what we did!Now, let's get to the important part... the famous craft cocktails. I was told to order their Champagne Cocktail, and I'm always one to listen to recommendations. It was far more pricey than what I typically am willing to spend on drinks ($11), and I was even more disappointed when they brought it out because it was served in a rather small glass. I figured I would give it a try, and then switch to my usual gin and tonic. Well, needless to say I didn't have a gin and tonic the entire evening.

I might give the Ball & Biscuit another chance again someday."], ["Richard C.", "If you are a cocktail enthusiast, this is your bar. The old fashioned I ordered was made better than any I have had in Indianapolis.

She kept my drinks filled and educated me on the cocktails she thought would suit my likings. I had the artichoke and Spinach dip and it was amazing. The bread that was served on the side was fantastic and offered many different flavors. The drink I had was called \"On The Rooftops.\" It was well made, had a generous amount of alcohol in it, and tasted amazing! Bravo to the staff at Ball and Biscuit. Even with a full house on a Thursday night the ladies were still smiling and laughing, clearly enjoying their jobs and guests. AND the chef came out and worked the bar to help the bartender since the crowd was abnormally large that night. I am very impressed with this place. I will be back, with new faces, next time around. I can't keep this place a secret anymore! :D"], ["Olivia M.", "Ball & Biscuit is a classy establishment. I love the decor - mostly wood, dimmer lighting, some lower tables with cushion seats. It feels fancy enough to warrant dressing up, but you could also wear jeans and not be judged. The staff are friendly without being overbearing. The cocktails look pricey, but are worth the money for their strength and creativity. I recommend the spiked cider in the winter!"], ["Dawn B.", "A friend of mine brought me here after a Heat - Pacers ECF game. \u00a0It looked like it might have been the only place still open downtown on a Sunday night.

The mac and cheese was really good, though overpriced given the portion size. . . likewise with the cheese and meat platter. I'm sure I'll go back for drinks, but I probably wouldn't come here if I was really hungry.

Soon, I had several visits in which I was treated by the staff as if I were lucky enough to be able to pay them for their drinks. On multiple occasions I have been ignored by staff and treated as if I was in the way. \u00a0After a few experiences I decided to vote with my dollars at the many other fine options on Mass Ave.If you are looking for a nice whiskey drink, it's a Tuesday night and you happen to be wearing a three piece suit, it's not a bad place to stop by."], ["Dylan E.", "I've been here a few times after work during the week, and earlier in the evening on some weekend nights. All those were pleasant experiences where we got a place to sit down, enjoy the nice ambiance and quiet setting, and sip of on delicious cocktails. While the drinks are overpriced, they are delicious and you are paying for the atmosphere as much as the alcohol. Service was fantastic, and their meat and cheese boards are delicious. The drink menu is extensive and has something to offer for every taste. There isn't a lot of seating for larger groups, but they have plenty of space for tables of 2-4 people. Based on that experience, I'd probably rate this a 4 star place, but I made the mistake of going in here late on a weekend night. All of that nice ambiance, quiet atmosphere, and space to sit down and enjoy your $12 cocktail goes completely out the window. Instead, it was packed, which meant ordering your expensive drink by yelling in between people sitting at the bar once you finally get the bartenders attention, reaching over people to get those drinks, and finally bumping your way through the crowd to find a space with enough room to stand with your friends. Essentially, this place turned into any other crowded and loud bar along Mass Ave, with the exception that drinks were still 3x more expensive and it was filled with the kind of people who looked like they probably have always gotten everything they wanted without having to do much work for it. All that being said, the area by the door in the separate section did seem to get spared from at least the crowds of people, so if you are lucky enough to get one of the 6-8 tables over there, you should still be able to enjoy your drinks and have a conversation. It was busy, but I've been in lots of places where the bartenders could run around nonstop all night and not appear bothered when you ordered a drink. That was not the case here.Overall, I'd say this is a great place to go after work or early in the evening to splurge on a good cocktail or two in a quiet and upscale place. However, unless you just have money to spend or don't come to a place like this looking for a nicer experience than any other bar, I'd avoid it late at night when it gets crowded.4 stars after work or before a show on the weekend2 stars late at night when it's packed and loud"]], "Tinker Street": [["Michelle Q.", "Hosting a national conference in Indy was a great time to spotlight our culinary treasures and beautiful city with visitors. Tinker Street with a 5 star Yelp review highlights everything I love in our city. The staff were extremely positive, helpful, knowledgeable, and unbearably delightfully hip. The decor is edgy and laid out so well the space feels open and airy even when a full house. The Prosecco at the beginning instantly charmed my guests. If this review had a title it would be, BEST ASH in INDY. Such an enchanting ingredient that added depth to the dishes. It is certainly a taste that the instant it hit my tastebuds I thought, 'Why have I never tried this? I can't believe I've been missing this!' It reminded me of the first time tasting Blue Cheese. A distinct flavor that if you love it you suddenly start thinking of ways to marry it to other dishes. The small plates are unique dishes beautifully plated and excellently described on the menu to the tiniest detail. The servers are knowledgable and willing to engage in conversation regarding any questions over an ingredient. The wine list was extensive and paired well with the dishes. We ordered two bottles and they graciously corked the remainder for a return to the hotel. The dishes were excellent. The menu featured seasonal items so take advantage of the chef's culinary skill and try a few featured items. \u00a0Save room for dessert and coffee. The coffee service is as charming as the Prosecco. This is one of the places in Indy you must plan to spend a few hours enjoying yourself. Do not rush the dining experience.

And speaking of, we are still craving the sugar snap peas with garlic rice krispies (who comes up this this stuff)? \u00a0The chevre cheesecake, as well, was sublime with a great creaminess and perfect amount of sweetness.Best of all the staff there were beyond charming; their friendliness just made the whole visit a fantastic experience. \u00a0We certainly hope to get there again next year when we are in town."], ["Desmond W.", "Tinker Street is truly a lovely quaint place within the beautiful, historic Herron-Morton neighborhood.

The Salmon was cooked just the way I like: medium/rare and juicy and full of much flavor atop a bed of an array of artistically arranged veggies nicely seasoned. Their menu is Chef driven, and the food is not only beautiful to behold but irresistible to eat. We met up on the patio and I immediately noticed that everyone was smiling, laughing and enjoying the dimly lit interior and exterior. Both the patio and indoor bar and table settings offer a nice ambience for a date outing or \"chill\" evening with a few friends. Their motto is certainly quality over quantity and this is regarding their excellent culinary creations and overall size of the restaurant.

You could even order two to share making it an appetizer like we did. Ok, while we're being honest here, my dining counterpart isn't a huge dessert guy so I ate both of them myself. I may have gained a few extra pounds after this meal but I have no regrets. Dessert: Still thinking about the Chevre Cheesecake, a creamy heavenly scoop (looked like ice cream) of rich goat cheese cheesecake balanced with perfect hints of fresh basil (very refreshing), served on a crumbly cocoa nib cookie and topped with blueberry compote. All these elements provided a delicious contrast in texture and flavors. Sweet, savory, and so well balanced. Don't skip this dish, start with it! We..I mean \"I\"...also had the Banana Cream Pie. It was good but the Chevre Cheesecake stole the show. Entrees: This was the part of the meal that I was least impressed with. I ordered the Spring Lamb. While the lamb was perfectly tender what I really enjoyed was the garlic white beans married in the arugula jus. This dish was good, presentation was beautiful but it was missing something that I just couldn't pinpoint. We also ordered the Sirloin, again it was cooked well but the \"Awe\" factor was missing. Appetizer: Mushroom Bruschetta, crisp bread, generous amounts of mushrooms, beautifully nestled on a spread of goat cheese...man I love cheese! Perfect for sharing between two people ready to indulge in a 4 course meal. I am not even a huge mushroom fan and this was a great dish! Notes: The owner & host Peter is ridiculously friendly. I chatted with him twice that evening, so down to earth, you can tell he and the co-owner are very passionate about their business. Love the local neighborhood homey vibe here. Appreciated the Prosecco welcome (lovely detail) to cleanse the palate. Great outdoor patio space but tables are sat very tight, so get to know your neighbor and watch out for the water mist. Next time I am bringing a poncho just in case they haven't fixed this small detail. Think water park mister at Kings Island. Negatives: I was terribly disappointed with our server. After reading so many great reviews about the wait staff here I was overly excited to share this joy with my fellow Yelp community. Our server provided no direction with the menu and when asked for recommendations at each course his response \"it's all good\". I asked him what his favorite dishes were, answer \"all of them.\" It was like pulling teeth to get him to interact with us. I know we all have bad days but come on!

The employees are all high-quality, motivated, kind individuals who know a lot about food and drink and want you to have a great time. Really, the only drawback for me is that Tinker Street is really small and doesn't take reservations, so there's often quite a wait. It's worth the wait, though, and it speaks to how popular this spot is.On both visits I've coincidentally gotten a steak-ish dish, and both times it has been absolutely excellent. Perfectly cooked both times, not even a tiny piece of fat on the serving. Tinker Street clearly excels at sauces, too (tonight's was a sweet corn sauce...amazing). I also had the famed Brussels sprouts when they were still on the menu--also excellent. I wish they would bring these back! Even simple appetizers like bread and butter are done really well. The French fries are pretty good but not great, although they are seasoned really nicely and come with some fun sauces.

The chocolate mousse is whipped perfection and the ash is better than how your brain pictures it. Actually the ash is what makes this dessert a stand out. Get a nice spoon full of mousse, marshmallow and ash and the combo is unreal. Childhood favorite just grew up to adult.A few weeks ago I was convinced to stray from my usual dessert. This new dessert is EVEN BETTER THAN THE SMORE! The sweet corn sundae..... oh, lordy, lordy. Take me to church after eating this, for I know I have sinned! It's that good! Rich ice cream, but not too sugary. The fruits really stand out against the corn flavor.

I will start from the beginning on this one for you, but I will let you know right up front that this was a large group, so if you have a large group, PLEASE take my warning and make reservations elsewhere.First of all, they didn't take reservations, which is interesting, but we understand. They don't want to save a big section and make other people wait, especially since it's such a tiny place. We figured we would have a few people get there early to get a table ready and situated, but they would not seat our party of 15 until EVERYONE was there. So we were finally seated after awkwardly standing around the bar/entrance after everyone got there and the waitress said she would transfer drinks to our table- this is immediately where things got messy.I understand that dealing with large groups can be difficult, but our group did not move around or switch seats until everyone was done eating. We weren't overly complicated, just a bit chatty. Our waitress seemed to not have any patience and was a bit snippy with people (for lack of better words.)When it came to the end of dinner (around 7:30) we were all ready for our checks and to go outside to take photos before dark. (We are a group of fashion bloggers, so of course photos were important!)Checks started slowly coming back to us (wrong) and the wait staff kept telling us it was a computer error, which is probable, but the way they handled it was so rude and poorly, that we were all upset and VERY ready to leave. As everyone paid their bills, they began to leave, but the last check wasn't delivered until right around 9pm. (1.5 hours after dinner was over.) My friend was stuck with the last check which had accounted for someone leaving and \"not paying\" even though we know she got her check, was complaining about how long it too, and that the waitress took her card with her on multiple occasions.No one was looking for a hand out, no one made a scene, and the restaurant actually made us feel like it was somehow our fault that they couldn't get things together enough to deliver our checks correctly or in a timely manner. No one apologized, no one offered a discount for errors or the long wait, and quite frankly, I think they didn't care one bit that they ruined what was supposed to be a great meeting of creatives.I do not recommend Tinker.

I would visit for wine and the cheese board alone.Our visit continued with carrots paired with lavender yogurt and a spinach/Thai basil salad (the pairing of the cold basil/spinach didn't do it for me but I did appreciate the marcona almonds).

I'm glad that another friend wanted to try it a few weeks later. Back I went, this time with a different server. I ordered the same pork belly main course and the same dessert and had an experience that was 100 times better. The food was consistently the same.. delicious and well presented.

They had my adoration upon arrival as guests are treated to a shot glass of prosecco. Who wouldnt love that?!?The dishes are creative plays on traditional American cuisine. Yet the flavors are no way standard nor boring. We had the kimchi sweet and sour soup, shrimp and grits, blistered asparagus, sorbet trio, and banana creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Each dish was a foodie taste bud delight. The grits were hands down the best grits I'll ever have and I generally don't like grits but they've changed my mind. The sweet and sour soup I could have consumed bowl after bowl as the flavors were balanced to perfection. Then dessert... Where to start. The sorbet flavors were so creative and delightful. I recommend trying each! The wait staff were so attentive and friendly. The atmosphere reminds me of a Brooklyn hip yet friendly neigh horrid restaurant.

My entire party wasn't there so we were seated in the bar area to wait. We were provided with food and drink menus. Not only was our server insanely adorable, he was friendly and provided us with great wine suggestions. Once my entire party arrived, we were seated. This is where the fun began. The menu may seem limited, but includes a wide variety of items. I love how it is divided by small plates, land/water, botanical, and confections. I was insanely hungry, so I wasn't as adventurous with my food selection. Although I was torn between the trout and the halibut, I opted for the Tinker Street Burger. I mean bacon onion jam, cheddar, and a side of shoe string fries sounded like a winner to me. The burger was delish! Seasoned nicely and the bacon onion jam was a nice touch. Loved the thin cut fries. Now, the real treat was dessert. It was so tough to decide. I wanted to try the \"Twinkie\" but based upon the recommendation of our adorable waiter I decided to try the S'More Pot de Cr\u00e8me. Holy smokes (pun intended)! This dessert was \u00a0a tantalizing treat that I enjoyed to the very last bite. I loved the whimsy of the dessert as well. The ash used was basically charred vegetable scraps that added the perfect amount of smokiness to the marshmallow. At first I wouldn't each it, but once I tried it the taste was almost mind blowing.

I was gently guided by the staff to enter on the side of the building where the patio is located. I was promptly greeted with a handshake and an introduction by one of the owners, Peter. While I waited for my friend to arrive, he sat me at one of the long communal tables on the patio. The patio is heated, which was deliciously wonderful on a cold evening. The server was very prompt in taking my drink order, I will say that they have a great selection of wines. After my friend arrived, Peter showed us to our table. Our server for dinner was very prompt, attentive and knowledgeable. We started with the Indiana cheese plate, which had an assortment of cheeses, pineapple jam, cherry cabernet paste, and an assortment of breads. If you order the cheese plate, I would recommend that you request an order of bread since the only a small amount is included with the cheese plate. The entire cheese plate assortment was wonderful and it was great to try different combinations with the jam and paste. For dinner, I had the Sirloin with Sweet Potato, Vincotto and Winter Greens. \u00a0The Sirloin was so tinder that you could cut it with your fork and the combination of the sides with the meat was delish!To end the night, I tried the S'More Pot de Creme. It was a great combination of marshmallow and chocolate. I will certainly be back to try out additional dishes at Tinker Street. The entire experience was one of the best that I have experienced in Indianapolis. Everyone was very personable and attentive. The food was amazing and for me the location is prime. I look forward to when they are open for lunch, which I hope will be soon!"], ["Lesley S.", "My new favorite restaurant! Greeted warmly & presented with prosecco. (Don't mind if I do!) Inviting yet casual outdoor seating area, stellar dishes perfect for sharing tapas style, really good wine, and magnificent desert! We went as a random night out minus kids but I felt like it was my birthday or a special occasion. The food and atmosphere was just *that* incredible. The vegetarian options were on point and we left feeling so very happy. I can't wait to eat here again!"], ["Faith B.", "Since everyone spoke so highly about this place, I decided to have a business meet-up there. Let me say that the staff is especially friendly and accommodating. They won't seat you until your party is there. I got offered water 4 times before I broke down and accepted. We skipped the appetizers and went straight for main course. I got the prawns and grits. When you get this do t expect southern style shrimp and grits. Not to say that these weren't good but portion size is smaller than what I'm used to needless to say, I was hungry. For dessert I got the highly recommended s'mores. It's served with a hickory ash which is just that...ash. It was good minus the ash. Would definitely recommend to try for yourself. It's a cool casual atmosphere. Oh and I forgot, we started with complimentary prosecco. Can't go wrong with that!"], ["Whitney D.", "Hands down the best customer service I've ever experienced in my life. A couple friends and I showed up on a Thursday evening around 6:45pm, greeted by the smiling owners, Peter and Tom. There are two parts to the restaurant - a small, classy interior which appears to seat about 40 people and an exterior portion that's somewhat reminiscent of an upscale trendy greenhouse which seats around 30. Unfortunately, the interior was completely full, so we were seated in the external portion - which would have been 100% okay, IF we hadn't decided to come on pretty much the coldest day of the year. Poor timing on our part. We could tell Peter and team were super conscious of our comfort though, and didn't want the cold to ruin our experience - he ensured the overhead heaters were on full blast and moved the floor-based heaters nearer our feet to keep us toasty. TIP: Wear two pairs of socks, just in case!Our dining experience started with a visit from the wine steward who helped us navigate Tinker's extensive wine list. Our server appeared next and was fantastically attentive and knowledgeable, providing in-depth descriptions of every menu item we had questions on. Appetizers: To start, we had the brussels sprouts which were every bit as delicious as previous Yelpers described. We also had the cheese plate, with three different types of cheese, two types of jams, a honey butter, and two types of breads from Amelia's. All was delicious, minus one of the cheeses which tasted like it was straight from the cow - probably a personal preference on that front, though! Entrees: Because no Yelper had reviewed it yet, I got the Celeriac \"steak\" with quinoa, mustard greens, and wine jus. If you're not familiar with celeriac, it's a root vegetable, with a celery-like flavor. The dish was surprisingly good - a unique vegetarian dish, nicely flavored and light, in a perfect portion size. Because my friends are sharers, I also got to sample their curried rice noodles and the pork belly. \u00a0The rice noodles were tasty, not overly spicy/hot by any means, but portion size was a little on the small side. Pork belly was absolutely delicious, uber flavorful and the best portioned of all entrees. If you're a guy, you should probably order this one. Dessert: Peter and team offered us free dessert and espressos to make up for having to seat us outside. Such a nice gesture, and we fully took him up on it. Espressos were great (don't worry, they have decaf!), and the crepe cake and pot de creme \u00a0were phenomenal. \u00a0Though it appears small, the pot de creme packs a punch - super rich and absolutely filing enough for two people. But hey, because I'm a fatty, I ate the entire thing. No way was I letting that caramelly, chocolaty goodness go to waste. And don't let the \"hickory and ash\" description throw you - it doesn't really taste like campfire.Overall, a great experience - a bit on the pricier side (my bill was around $30, pre-tip, and would've been around $40 had we paid for dessert/espresso), BUT the customer service was out of this world! Peter made us feel like family, and in my opinion, that's worth a bit of a mark-up."], ["Ron R.", "Move over (insert \"literally everywhere else\" here), Tinker Street is here!I can't say enough good things about this place. \u00a0Wowza! \u00a0This is a foodie's dream. \u00a0Chef Braedon and his team are really putting the flavor smack down in the kitchen. \u00a0everything was so good. \u00a0My girlfriend and I came here for Valentines to check out the new hot spot and it did not disappoint.The menu is setup in 3 sections. \u00a0Small Plates, Salads/Pastas, and Entrees. \u00a0I'd say everything is pretty much shareable as a small plate and you are going to want to get several things here. \u00a0Just keep this in mind as you see the menu prices are 5-19$, you'll be getting about 5-6 items most likely if you are trying this place out for the first time.We started with the fried brussels sprouts and they were seasoned with a Dukka spice that I had to ask about. \u00a0It was very Mediterranean in flavor with hints of coriander, cumin and paprika. \u00a0It had caramelized shallots and a delicious vinaigrette of some sorts. \u00a0This is a must try!!We also got the cheese plate and an order of the bread. \u00a0The bread ($4 or $5) was simply toasted (semolina I think) with a garlic butter. \u00a0Not really worth it on its own, but good with the cheese plate as you'll need more bread than it comes with. \u00a0The cheese plate was fantastic. \u00a0Had a goat cheese covered in ashe, and triple or double cream brie, and one I couldn't really put my finger on. Jarlsberg maybe, not sure. \u00a0It also comes with a whipped honey ball (delicious), and 2 jams which were fantastic. \u00a0One was a cherry jam, and the other a pineapple vanilla! \u00a0They are both great in combination with the cheeses.For entrees, my girlfriend got perfectly seared diver scallops! \u00a0I mean perfect, melt in your mouth scallops. ($19 for 3 scallops) \u00a0I had the seared Pork Belly on a bed of Kimchi and grains. \u00a0I must say, the rub they put on this pork belly, was phenomenal. \u00a0I couldn't get enough....really...it was perfectly seared and still retained the amazing flavor of Pork Belly. (About 5oz for $16)We did not end up trying desert here this day as we knew we would go out for drinks, but for a romantic night out with amazing food and 2 beers we escaped for right under $100. \u00a0For the type of atmosphere, and the super high quality food, I would consider this place a good value and would come back again for sure.The only minor complaint I have (and this might be different on non-valentine's day) is the tables are so close together, you can basically eat off your next table neighbors table. \u00a0If you sit on the edge of a row, your elbow is constantly being nudged by passer bys. \u00a0This got a little annoying but I dealt with it."], ["Erika K.", "Amazing meal and atmosphere! Enjoyed the cozy outdoor seating with beautiful heated lamps and a glass of wine with the giant prawns entree (delicious)! The brussel sprouts were perfection. I will definitely be making more trips here! The smores cr\u00e8me de pot was rich and decadent!"], ["Ian B.", "Wow!! this place was great!So i came here with my parents for my birthday dinner. My parents were dressed up but i didn't know we were coming here so i was just wearing khaki shorts and a t-shirt but i did not feel out of place. We got there when they opened at 5:30 and by 6:30 the place was full.The staff here is top notch A++. They are extremely attentive to you and will make sure you have everything you need while eating, will check on you all the time making sure your happy. The waiting staff knows the menu front to back, the wine list extensively and are very professional. We set outside which was gorgeous. It was a little warm so they had on misters to keep us cool. The patio is a decent size with umbrellas and a covered area. I dint get to see the inside but I've heard it is nice. THE FOOD IS OUTSTANDING! We shared a plate of cheese and jam. The waitress suggested a wine for us that paired perfectly wit this. The cheese was the best blue cheese i have ever eaten and with the cherry jam it was out of this world.I ordered the salmon which can be ordered done or because its super fresh and local you can get it a little rare (which i did). The flavor was out of this world and cooked perfectly. The beans and garnishment was delicious also. My step-mother ordered the chicken with curry sauce. She has always said that she does not like curry but she loved this dish. The chicken was moist and delicious and the curry was not over powering with just a little heat on the back end. My father got the burger which i didn't try but he said it was delicious. The french fry's were very crunchy so if you like crispy over cooked (purposely) french fry's (like i do) you'll love these. My step mother ordered the s'mores desert. I don't eat deserts but this had the most amazing flavors and they used left over vegetable scraps to make a smoked char to dip it in that was incredible. This restaurant is wonderful and i can't wait to come back. I will put one disclaimer in that later in the evening the clientele can get a little \"high class\". this obviously has no effect on the service for everyone else but sometimes people feel out of place in situations such as that. That didn't bother me though, i felt like i was being treated just like everyone else with top notch service."], ["Tonya S.", "I highly recommend visiting the newly opened Tinker Street and soon! \u00a0I just don't see how you could possibly leave disappointed.I have been excited for Tinker Street to open for a very long time. \u00a0Located at 16th and New Jersey, I live 6 blocks away. \u00a0It was almost a year ago that announcements were made about this wonderful establishment opening in the near future.INTERIOR: \u00a0First of all, space is limited. \u00a0It is a small restaurant, but they made great use of the smaller space. \u00a0We dined inside. \u00a0The interior is intimate, inviting and very urban. The enclosed patio looked just as inviting (and warm on a frigid January night). \u00a0LOCATION: \u00a0This area really needed some new restaurants, so Tinker Street is a very welcomed addition!PARKING: \u00a0They have their own parking lot! \u00a0Major bonus. \u00a0Tons of free street parking nearby as well. SERVICE: \u00a0Impeccable. \u00a0These folks know what they are doing! \u00a0DRINK MENU: \u00a0Excellent wine offerings. \u00a0A wine specialist visited our table right away, poured us a miniature glass of Prosecco (as a \"thank you\" for coming in) and then proceeded to answer our questions about the wine list, make suggestions, etc. \u00a0Very impressed. \u00a0The rotating beer selection is mostly local and great. DINNER MENU: \u00a0There is certainly something for every appetite and diet here. \u00a0Plates are smaller and very \"foodie\" like, so it is great to go with others and share. \u00a0We had the following:Hummus Lemon Oil, Dried Olive and Pita ($6) - Not the best hummus I have had in town, but it was good. We ran out of pita chips and it was nice to know that we could request extra.Fried Brussels Sprouts, Dukhah Spice and Dijon Vinaigrette ($6). - Very tasty with amazing flavor, but maybe not the best option if you are trying to dine healthy. \u00a0They are fried, but well worth it on a cheat day or a splurge!Fresh Pappardelle Tomato Ragu with House Made Herb Ricotta ($13) - Excellent vegetarian dish. \u00a0Yet, I would have loved some meat on it and will ask if this is an option next visit. \u00a0 Still very delish!Albacore Tuna Celeriac, Kale and Pomegranate Molasses Vinaigrarette ($18)- OUTSTANDING!!! OTHER NOTES: The staff at Tinker Street is extremely friendly. \u00a0Again, these folks know what they are doing. \u00a0Top notch service. \u00a0This is a 21 and over establishment for those of you that may want to bring children. \u00a0Further, I hear they will not be allowing pets on the patio when weather permits and they open the patio. Just some \"good to know\" info!I can't wait to go back or to hear about these happy hour specials they will be sharing soon!"], ["Craig M.", "My date and I had a great experience at Tinker Street. We waited for a table on the heated patio, which is a nice way to capture bar space. Informed that the wait was an hour, we waited about 30 minutes at 8pm on a Saturday. This patio will be great in warm weather. As a host, Peter's attentiveness and personality were matched only by really exceptional service from the waitstaff. I was not expecting such a level of service in a restaurant open for less than two weeks. The professionalism and small dining room reminded me of many charming restaurants in New York City.A small toast of complimentary bubbly moscato (or prosecco maybe?) was a nice touch when seated. We tried the roasted fennel, which was simple but good. The squash soup was very good, just the right amount of spicy flavor balanced by homemade basil marshmallows. And finally the sirloin was perfect, on a bed of sweet potato custard with a bit of kale salad.The food was very good, the service exceptional and nothing on the food menu was priced over $19, with most items in the $10-15 range. The value was high for the quality of the experience. I look forward to returning soon."], ["Joe P.", "I'm very much a fan of Tinker Street. The owner gave us complimentary prosecco even before we ordered, which is the makings of a great first impression. The food selection is clearly based on local, fresh ingredients and I couldn't be more happy with my choice of the sirloin with creamed kale and roasted new potatoes.The portions are decent-sized but not overbearing. Our waiter offered great suggestions throughout the dinner, all of which we took him up on.Make sure to try out the sorbet - a small, refreshing dessert and a great ending to a wonderful experience. Cheers Tinker Street!"], ["Kevin M.", "Nice variety, innovation. Friendly staff. \u00a0A little noisy."], ["Jonathan S.", "This restaurant was absolutely fabulous. Went to dinner with 7 others on Friday after Thanksgiving. \u00a0We arrived at the restaurant on the early side, as they don't take reservations, to insure our larger party could be accommodated. We ordered every appetizer on the menu and everything was on point, the brussels were outstanding. I had the shrimp and grits and tried bites of everyone's dishes and to my delight all were exceptional. Thanks Peter George for another great restaurant."], ["Sigrid F.", "Well, I'm not going to make any friends with this review, but here it goes. Maybe I should just stay away from the overly trendy spots, because I seem to not follow in the admiration. I guess I just have a problem with snooty staff. It started out with not being able to be seated until everybody in the party is there... well, I understand this to a point... however, when the restaurant is quite empty and 5 out of 6 people are there, you are going to need that size of table anyways, whether that last person shows or not. So is it really such an advantage to have us clog up your entryway? You're already holding the table for us... Granted our last person did not make it, however, we still were seated at the same table that we had been told would be ours if we had 6 people... go figure, just now we hung around 1/2 hour looking at it before actually having the pleasure of being seated there. I'm not going to mention our waiter's name because I don't think that would be nice (but would be happy to tell the mgmt. if they would like to know) and he did warm up to us later and his service improved drastically, but personally I was close to walking out of the place thanks to the attitude we were greeted with. I could have sworn he sighed... Anyways, one of us asked him if there were any sweet reds on the wine card, since we didn't see anything familiar on the wine menu. The answer was a rather \u00a0brisk \"NO\" and he walked away... hmmm... my friend ended up going inside and asking for the Sommelier who was very nice and helpful, but unfortunately no suitable wine was found.But the absolute kicker was that some kind of insect flew into one of the wine glasses, it happens when you sit outside, no problem. We alerted our waiter, expecting a replacement maybe... instead we got: 'well it's gonna happen if you're outside' ... long pause... 'you want me to bring you a straw or something so you can fish it out? '.... Excuse me? What? That was the point where I almost left. After a bit of a discussion he brought another glass of wine with the same amount of the other... and we asked almost in unison if this was fresh wine or did he just remove the offending critter. Somehow along the way our waiter turned into a completely different person and by the end of the meal was delightful and attentive... The food though, is high quality and absolutely delicious. Every single dish was an adventure for your taste buds. Kudos on the food. The food is worth going there, but the service is sketchy, very sketchy... Personally I probably won't be back unless I have some friends insist on going there."], ["Kris L.", "Tinker Street was a recommendation from a local buddy of mine with great taste. He steered me true. It just reaffirms the revelation I've been having about the high quality of the Indy food scene.TS focuses on very local ingredients and the staff take obvious pride in that point without being total tools about it. It was a lot of fun to talk to them while I ate solo. I'm not a dessert person unless we're talking about roasted bone marrow or blueberry pie, so when I say theirs are not to be missed, yeah, I'm kinda serious about it. Give them a shot. The food is fresh and delicious, the atmosphere is light and friendly and the prices are very mild. Enjoy."], ["Anna Z.", "This may sound cheesy but I'm really excited to write this review.Tinker Street was such a great experience. The food, the service, the wine. When walking in, we were immediately greeted by the owner. A 35 minute wait at 8 o'clock for two people. We got a $22 bottle of wine and sat at the bar table. It was only 15 until our table was ready. We sat down and were poured little shots of champagne and were given a thank you for joining us. I thought this was an awesomely unique touch. The food was excellent. The service was excellent. All was excellent. I love that this new business is only two blocks away from my apartment too! It will be wonderful to use the patio when the weather is warmer. I highly recommend Tinker Street."], ["Megan N.", "We had dinner last night at Tinker Street and loved it! Great ambiance, super attentive waitstaff and owner. There were a few hiccups, but the owner or manager did an awesome job making up for it.We started with the mushroom bruschetta and the roasted vegetables. Our table took a VERY long time to get our orders in \u00a0(catching up with friends and not looking at the menu!) but our waiter couldn't have been nicer and returned to check on us several times before we were ready. We placed our appetizer order then placed our dinner order several minutes later. \u00a0The entrees ended up coming out before the appetizers, but the staff was so apologetic and comped the appetizers -- even though it was not necessary! I had the squash noodle pad thai which was amazing! I was skeptical when I was told it was served chilled but it was truly delicious. Others at the table had the prawns and grits, and the halibut - all of which were thoroughly enjoyed.Dessert was the pot de creme, cheesecake, and banana cream pie. You can't go wrong with any of them but I am biased and thing the banana cream pie is the way to go! The ambiance is amazing, the staff is sensation, and the food is delicious. We're already talking about when we can go back."], ["M C.", "This is our new favorite restaurant!!!! The food is SO amazing. My husband is a vegan & tonight we got every vegan dish on the menu (currently there are 5). This is a foodies paradise, and we are lucky to have it.

Not that the food was bad, in fact its quite good and properly portioned, but just didnt find anything special about it. Saving grace is that price is not that bad. The wife though, swears its one of the best pappardelle she had."], ["Amy N.", "Tinker Street= happy, happy vegan ; )I was fortunate enough to find Tinker Street (with a vegan/vegetarian food Yelp search) within walking distance of where we were staying in Indy recently. \u00a0After taking a quick peek at the menu, we headed on over. \u00a0Luckily, we arrived at the beginning of the peak dining period, as this little gem gets pretty crowded. \u00a0There is a large patio as well, but we opted to dine indoors.How delightful it is to sit down and be presented with a menu that has more than one vegan option on the list! \u00a0My husband was impressed with the minimal yet quality local craft beer choices. \u00a0We chose the Tempura Oyster Mushrooms with Black Garlic-Tahini Aioli for a starter, and we were both really pleased. \u00a0This is a hearty serving of these tasty 'shrooms. \u00a0We also shared a fresh salad of Strawberries, Arugula, Endive,Thai Basil, & Marcona Almonds. \u00a0Fresh & delicious.I chose the Blistered Asparagus, with Preserved Lemon, Quinoa, & Parsley as my entree, and my husband selected the Gulf Prawns and Grits Bisque, with Green Tomato Chow-Chow. \u00a0We spend a good deal of time in the South, so gulf prawns with a good chow-chow are a favorite of his, and he was extremely pleased with the dish. \u00a0My asparagus dish was a perfect serving, with complex flavors that I enjoyed. I opted for the light entree so that I could order the trio of sorbet flavors for dessert, which hit the spot. \u00a0As far as the service, I don't think you can go wrong here...there are so many waiters and staff in this small space. Our waiter was Elijah, who was personable and attentive. \u00a0I was so impressed with just observing the bar staff rinsing and polishing the wine glasses. \u00a0I know it seems trivial to some, but the use of high end bar towels and linens is something that I appreciate. \u00a0I might add that the prices here are surprisingly reasonable. \u00a0I would love to return and try more of the delights that this sweet restaurant has to offer. \u00a0See you soon, Tinker Street!"], ["Kinsey C.", "Buckle up ladies and gents, this is going to be a long review.I came to Tinker Street last week with high expectations based on all the wonderful reviews. \u00a0I have driven by this place nearly every day for the last six months and always wanted to try it, so when I was invited to a 15 person dinner here I was beyond excited to try it out.The experience started out quite well. \u00a0Our entire party was not there at exactly 6 at the dot, so we were asked to wait and have a drink until our entire party arrived. \u00a0I completely understand this practice and was not upset with it at all. \u00a0It gave me a chance to peruse their excellent wine list and relax with a drink. \u00a0When we were all seated, all of us were welcomed with a complimentary glass of prosecco. \u00a0Stop. \u00a0You had me at \"complimentary\". \u00a0I loved it, and felt so welcomed.That is probably the end of my brief love affair with Tinker Street. \u00a0It quickly turned sour like a horrible relationship with a bad boyfriend who is annoyed at everything you do and say. \u00a0I understand that our waitress must have been overwhelmed at working a 15 person party, so I do appreciate all of the work that she had to put in to managing our visit. \u00a0That hard work did not go unnoticed.While I did not believe that our waitress was rude or annoyed with our group, others I was dining with left that evening with that impression. \u00a0I found her helpful! \u00a0However, once we asked for our separate checks (as requested when we sat down) the trouble began. \u00a0My check was delivered to me and was incorrect. \u00a0I handed the waitress my credit card and my bill, asked her to make the corrections and run the card. \u00a0About 30 minutes later (you did not misread that- 30 minutes) another waiter brought back my card and a new bill. \u00a0He reported that their computer system was freezing up due to splitting the checks. \u00a0My card had not been run, so I simply looked over the new bill and handed my card right back to him. \u00a0Nearly 45 minutes later I am handed the black binder with my card peeking out. \u00a0At this point I, and my fellow diners, was so frustrated that I grabbed my card from the binder, said my goodbyes to my lovely dining companions and left. \u00a0Almost 90 minutes after initially asking for my bill and handing my credit card to the waitress I left feeling irritated and vowing never to return despite how much I enjoyed the food, drink and atmosphere.If only that would have been the end. \u00a0Apparently, after giving my card to not one but two separate servers, they never ran my card. \u00a0I had already left when they discovered this. \u00a0What I was told was that the waitress implied I dined and dashed and asked another person in my party to cover my bill. \u00a0I was FURIOUS. \u00a0To imply I didn't pay my bill after they had my card for nearly 90 minutes? \u00a0To force someone else to pay for me because of their mistake? \u00a0FURIOUS does not even cover it. \u00a0Instead of taking to Yelp and writing a one star review bashing this place, I recognize that accidents happen. \u00a0People become overwhelmed and make mistakes. \u00a0Large parties are super difficult to handle alone. \u00a0I contacted the manager the next day to explain that I had indeed attempted to pay my bill twice so that no one thought I had tried to steal my meal. \u00a0Lindsay, the acting manager on call, was very helpful and apologetic. \u00a0She offered to refund the credit card my friend used to pay or to send her a gift card for the difference to make it right. \u00a0I was very appreciative of this offer and her apologies for our experience. \u00a0That is why this review is not a one star. \u00a0Lindsay even went above and beyond to call me back the following week to see what else she could do to \"make it right\". \u00a0That shows me that Tinker Street really does value their customers and wants everyone to leave with a smile on their face.So there you have it. \u00a0A very lengthy review about what I consider to be the worst restaurant experience I've had in a while, and the efforts the manager went to make it right. \u00a0I would recommend you check out Tinker Street, just take your large party somewhere else!"], ["Arnold S.", "We happened on this wonderful restaurant on a visit to Indy two weeks ago.

Arrive early because they are a small restaurant. From the moment we were greeted we had an exceptional experience. Peter, the owner, shook our hand and asked for both of our names as we were directed to the sidewalk where we had to wait for our table. \u00a0It's a small gesture, but it made us feel welcome and it was a personable experience in a restaurant filled with strangers. \u00a0As we waited, there was a kind waitress who took our beverage order and started a tab for us and everyone else who was waiting. Forty minutes and a glass of wine later we were seated to our table that was inside. Again, making us feel taken care of, Peter made sure to extend the warm personable experience by making sure our slight wobbly table was perfect by adjusting it. \u00a0Our waitress was very kind and answered all our questions that we had about the menu. We started out with an appetizer of Amelia's bakery bread with bay leaf butter. A little charred, but nevertheless delicious. For our entrees we shared the sirloin with potatoes and creamed kale. Which I could eat just a side of the creamed kale. It was fantastic. \u00a0We also shared the tinker burger with shoestring fries. Another great choice, and if your on the hungry side I would greatly recommend because it was a larger entree than the others. Finally the best part of the dining experience, dessert. We shared the s'more pot de creme and the ch\u00e8vre cheesecake with cocoa nibs and blueberry compote. \u00a0 The s'more was delicious but the star is the cheesecake. A lighter cheesecake and not too sweet. Overall we had a lovely dining experience and will definitely be back. Only earlier so we won't have to wait as long."], ["Gilia C.", "Awesome place!

Waiters and owners are extremely friendly and it's always a pleasure to come in."], ["Lara P.", "I had read many five-star reviews for this place, and my high expectations were met on my first visit. \u00a0The only reason I'd dock Tinker Street is because I wish it were bigger! \u00a0Our group of four waited an hour for a table on a Wednesday night. \u00a0(There isn't much space to wait, so we actually walked a few blocks down the street for a beer at Thirsty Scholar.) Tinker Street offers a foodie experience that's still approachable and affordable. My friends felt adventurous but also didn't have to google every ingredient on the menu. :) \u00a0 Portions aren't huge, which allows you to try more than one item or, in our case, three courses. I started with the fried rainbow carrots and had the sirloin for my meal. \u00a0For dessert, the S'more pot de creme was perfect. I'd recommend all these items and would order them again myself. \u00a0We all agreed we're looking forward to visiting Tinker Street again soon!"], ["Jill M.", "Definitely one of if not the favorite restaurant of mine in Indy. \u00a0I had a group of five people and we had multiple appetizers, entrees and desserts and all were delicious, very delicious. \u00a0The design of the place is cool and makes an enjoyable setting for eating outside on a nice evening. \u00a0The staff all were friendly and owners made their way around to tables greeting and checking on guests, something I can't remember experiencing at any other restaurant. \u00a0Pricey for my budget, but completely worth it."], ["Judy D.", "What a gem. The service made an amazing meal all the more enjoyable. The brussels sprouts appetizer are awesome and alone make the visit worth while. Love the creativity of the dishes and the fact the vast majority of the food is locally sourced. It was a treat to be greeted by one of the owners...made the evening more special. Indy has become an outstanding dining city."], ["Sarine J.", "I really, really wish I could give this place a 3.5 but Yelp doesn't allow halfsies. There were a TON of positives about this place but I was not impressed by the food. I feel really bad saying it because it has such great reviews and I was so excited to try it but it didn't meet my expectations.Positives: Beautiful restaurant, excellent atmosphere, nice ambience, attentive staff, decent food.Negatives: Almost 2 hour wait, no cocktails, only 3-4 beers on tap, INCREDIBLY expensive, decent food.Now about the food. I tried the crab salad, mushroom bruschetta, and the shoestring fries as appetizers. The crab salad was tasty (fresh crab with some lemon maybe?) I did not think the bruschetta's flavors blended well. Something was a bit odd there. The shoestring fries were fantastic, and with the hemp seed dipping sauce, YUMMY! For dinner I got the burger. Oh so disappointing!!! It was a large portion and cooked very well but I only tasted the bread and meat. The meat was of very good quality but I did not taste any jam in there. I took two bites and gave my very large and expensive dish to my fiance. Since I didn't eat my meal and had a ton of room for dessert, I ordered the grasshopper sundae. I can confidently say that the mint ice cream is the best mint ice cream I've ever had. It's made in house and its clear that it's made with fresh mint. The brownie was fine (not excellent) but the fudge was pretty phenomenal. Overall, I had a good experience. The restaurant itself was very nice and the staff was on top of it. With how expensive the food was, my expectations on the taste were not met. The quality was great, but the flavors were underwhelming."], ["Rebecca Z.", "I was so pleasantly surprised by the great food scene in Indianapolis, and this restaurant was a standout among many gems. (I live in Manhattan. Believe me that I know good food.) My friend and I received complimentary samples of prosecco on arrival. She had a juicy burger, and I had a stellar piece of halibut in a butter sauce with peas and gnocchi. We shared the s'mores for dessert. This place has high-end food that is beautifully plated and with a very friendly and well orchestrated staff, all for about $25 an entree. If you're a local, you are lucky to be able to enjoy this wonderful restaurant on a regular basis. They change their menu weekly based on the produce available from local farmers. Truly a foodie's dream restaurant."], ["Michael B.", "The hype is real - this place is a great experience.Following good advice our group went early (around 5:30) on a weekend. It's not a big space, but there's a big outdoor area that's prime location now that the weather is good. We started with the mushroom bruschetta and cheese plate, which were both phenomenal. I'm usually pretty decisive, but even with a smaller menu picking an entree was a challenge - pork belly, a huge and amazing looking burger, and sirloin? I ended up going with the sirloin and was really impressed - very tender and served with some oil and seasonings that blended perfectly. I usually take a hard pass on a lot of vegetables but the spinach was even outstanding combined with the potatoes and other herbs/seasoning. No \u00a0idea what all else was on the plate but man did it work.Others at our table went for the burger, salmon, and chicken and across the board were impressed. For dessert I tried to the Smore's cup of creme - it was ridiculously cool and good. There's ash on your plate (not for eating) and the top of the whipped cream was slightly toasted, so you not only get the marshmallow/chocolate/graham cracker goodness, but also the smell/taste of a campfire. The great thing here is also the menu set-up - you could easily go big with a small plate to start, entree and dessert, or you could grab just a great burger or an app and drink for a pretty reasonable price. No one thing on the menu is very pricey, so that flexibility is really nice. The ambience and service were great - if anything they had so many people around that at times it was almost a little awkward - may be due to our early dining time. Good to see this area of town building up and Tinker Street would be a fantastic destination wherever it was in Indy."], ["Vam K.", "Yum yum yum! Out group began our visit by being greeted with a sparkling white wine from our waitress. We moved to an array of appetizers including their potato and leek soup, fried Brussels sprouts, and tofu (which was the only thing I would suggest passing on). From there we ordered a bottle of wine (they have an amazing selection, but we settled on Shattered), and our entrees. Everyone gobbled their food up, including the tuna, the celeriac, a salad, and curry noodles, without complaints. We were feeling quite hungry so we also ordered an order of their shoestring fries, which was also great. To finish up the meal, we had their trio of sorbets which were just delightful. I highly recommend going here! It was superb!"], ["Jenn B.", "We don't go out to eat often as my wife is a great cook. But we heard so many great things about Tinker Street that we had to give it a try. We were both wearing flip-flops or the whole experience would've knocked our socks off! We were greeted by Peter who shook our hands and genuinely welcomed us. That's never happened to me at any restaurant. Then a lovely woman greeted us at our table and gave us a complimentary glass of prosecco. Who does that?! Tinker Street does! Our server Allison was fantastic from start to finish and then there's the food. OMG! We ordered a total of 6 items and each one was so amazing. The combo of flavors, textures and portion size were all perfect. We cannot wait to go back and plan to eventually try everything on the menu. Oh, I almost forgot to mention the wine selection! One word, awesome! Do your tastebuds a favor and go to Tinker Street!"], ["Daniel D.", "The service here rivals the best restaurants I've experienced, and the food is even better.The reason my wife and I decided to come here were the reviews. Specifically there was one review that said \"we came with high expectations, and we weren't disappointed.\" I would add to that: we came with high expectations and they were exceeded.I enjoyed the pork belly and my wife had the amazing sirloin. But apparently they change up the menu seasonally, so don't rely solely on reviews to choose your dish. Rest assured that everything on the menu is fresh and satisfying. If I was forced to say anything negative, it would be that the place is a small and a bit crowded. But in a way it adds to the experience. Even with a large crowd, the wait time wasn't bad, about a half hour. And during the wait, they take and serve drink orders. Bonus points! I can't wait to go again."], ["James C.", "So, my new favorite place, is Tinker Street!!! \u00a0Going to bring all my bros, crews and ppl to enjoy this place. \u00a0The service and atmosphere was warm and welcoming, the ONLY thing missing from our initial welcome in the door was a big hug! \u00a0Really though, respect, genuine appreciation and friendliness goes a long way!After this wonderful welcome we were told we would have a short wait and to utilize the common area seating as we waited. \u00a0A server asked if he could get drinks for us while we waited (awesome service). \u00a0Our wait went by quickly due to the amount of people-watching you can do here and, the warmth of a lot of people talking and enjoying themselves is relaxing and easy to take in. The food is a bold mix of fresh ingredients you might not expect but will no doubt find delight in. \u00a0The cheese tray, salmon, natural chicken and scallops are all great! \u00a0Along with local beers on tap this place is doing so much right I'm excited to have them part of the Indy scene. \u00a0I will be back and I'm bring all my foodie friends!"], ["Joseph O.", "I want to just take a half star away. Near perfection, except for a few service missteps that I am sure will be corrected. A little too relaxed attitude by some of the staff. They are young, and it shows. The food makes this place worthy of the Peter's legacy. Every bite was a symphony of flavor. Delicate flavors are built upon, and bold flavors are harmonized. Stopped in for a quick bite, looking forward to many return trips to explore an exciting menu."], ["Evan S.", "My wife and I moved away from Indy three years ago, and we've been watching the Indy food scene from afar ever since.One of the places our friends were always talking about is Tinker Street, and boy are we glad we listened.Great food, wine and atmosphere at great price point.And the squash noodle pad Thai was the absolute perfect summer dish.Can't wait to come back when we visit again!"], ["Bobbi B.", "What an absolute gem!

What an amazing experience at Tinker Street. An intimate spot off 16th street, this new eatery has the perfect atmosphere for a couple or small group. Their menu is large enough to have some selection but small enough that everything we've ordered is a unique experience in and of itself. So far we've tried: cheese plate (so delightful), brussel spouts (absolutely phenomenal), pan fried chicken, sirloin, and the grapefruit salad. All the entrees were just excellent, small but enough to really enjoy and not over stuff yourself. The grapefruit salad was my entree. It was actually pretty large and the black rice was a really nice touch. Service was wonderful, the small setting means you get lots of attention and there's a specific person to help you with wines (all pretty accessible and she's a great help!) We also tried the red velvet twinkies for dessert, this is the only thing I wouldn't order again... and no decaf coffee which is a bummer. Small complaints though for a meal that was absolutely phenomenal!"], ["Susan F.", "I was not prepared for how cute this restaurant is! The patio/seating area is just lovely! This is not in the best neighborhood (from my seat on the patio I turned my head north to see a boarded up house), but this is definitely a diamond in the rough! Dinner was delicious, too. I had the Heirloom tomatoes as my salad (aka 'botanical'). Delicious! The blue cheese dressing was divine and complimented the fresh tomatoes perfectly! My entree was the gulf prawns and grits. I was not sure what I would think about the green tomato chow-chow, but it was good. The grits were perfectly cooked. Seriously best grits I have ever had. My friend had the lamb, which she said was good (I don't eat lamb).For dessert I had the cheesecake-soooo good. Perfect end to my meal! My friend had the smores dessert, which she said was not as good as my cheesecake.The prosecco upon seating is so cool. It was a hot day, and this was the best. It was a perfect welcome. My only detractor of the whole thing was that they do not have take home boxes. We didn't finish the tomatoes, and I thought it would be so good to have with my lunch the next day. I was told that it was \"the chef's choice not to have boxes.\" IDK what exactly that means, but I love eating leftovers for lunch at work the next day. Reminds me of my what fun I had while I am shackled in my job. :)Overall, great place. Everything was sooooooo good."], ["Jessie S.", "Yes! Finally somewhere great to eat within walking distance of Old North Side. I was already bias given the location and revitalization of the space, but was completely wowed by the food, service and ambiance. I heard the pork belly entree was worth trying - amazing! The portion is just right so that you have room to split a small plate, dessert, or just make it a light meal. (Not saying portions are small, just not the mammoth-sized meals you may be used to.)Wine list was awesome, but the draft beer selection was minimal. Know that there may be a wait since this place is new, amazing and pretty small. They do take good care of guests while you wait (drink service while waiting)."], ["Ronak S.", "Given the immense hype surrounding Tinker Street, I walked in ready to start composing my five-star review. Maybe my expectations were too high, or maybe I popped in too early, but I'm going to settle on three this time around.Let's start with the positives -- I love the midwestern chic. The floor staff wear clean white tops over jeans, and the decor is class, but also basically the interior of a house. It's dressy but unpretentious, upscale with a Hoosier hospitality to soften the hard edges. At the same time, the staff is serious about their enterprise. No salt and pepper on the table -- the chef knows what he's doing, after all -- and when I suggested that I keep my plate and tableware between dishes, my server playfully asserted, \"I won't allow it.\" I admire that kind of unapologetic spunk. I don't want to always be right as a customer. Sometimes, I just want to sit back, trust, and leave it to the house. To that end, I'm not much of a wine drinker, but being able to meet the sommelier right at the start of the meal was a nice touch. I hope that's a practice that sticks around past opening week.Unfortunately, the food was a little more hit or miss than I thought. As usual, my vegetarianism limits me, so if the meat is delicious, you should definitely check it out. We tried six plates in all, so I can only speak to those. The fried brussels sprouts were fantastic, easily our favorite, with the tinker tofu and hummus vying for second place. On the other hand, the botanicals were a bit more underwhelming. The celeriac \"steak\" was dense and bland and kind of a chore to eat, as were the rice noodles in red curry. We finished with the \"crepes,\" which we were looking forward to as a light confection at the end of the meal. In actuality, it was cake made of layered crepes, with the chocolate, orange, and almond as a hint of an accent. The cake itself just tasted of eggy dough. It's an interesting experiment, but I'm not quite sold on it.I'm looking forward to trying some of the dishes I missed on the menu on a second go -- the pomegranate kale looks exciting, as does the ruby grapefruit. And I do admire the creativity of the food on the menu. But I'm hoping to see a few botanicals on the spring menu that are going to keep me coming back."], ["Casey B.", "Amazing food and the owner was very friendly. I liked the idea of a waiting area you are shown to until your whole party arrives. This area has one dedicated server, which is brilliant."], ["Marc M.", "Wow! \u00a0Class out all around, a real neighborhood gem. \u00a0From the moment you walk in your experience starts with a simple prosecco, appetizers were small plates with great flavors and temperatures... Go for the sriracha peppers! \u00a0Mains were just delightful. \u00a0Wine list offers great selections at quite the reasonable price."], ["Kaela V.", "Had a WONDERFUL meal at Tinker Street. \u00a0The prices are fairly reasonable for the quality of the food and the portions. The outdoor eating space doubles the size of the restaurant and is pleasant. \u00a0They do not take reservations though, so it is best to avoid peak hours as there is not a lot of space for waiting. \u00a0The desserts were excellent!"], ["Cortney H.", "The food is great, the wine list was great, but the draught beer options could have been much better.We ordered several small plates for the table which were delicious. Unfortunately, the wait staff was extremely condescending. We were the only group in the outside seating area under the age of 50 and apparently that was their cue to assume we were poor. While finishing our last drinks, a dessert option was presented. It did not sound appetizing at all and we declined. The waitress then told us to \"just get it, you'll only have to pay $2 each if you share\", assuming that price was the only reason we didn't want it. This experience will make it difficult to want to return even though the food was so good. But, perhaps that's what they had hoped. They may be trying to target an older, retiree crowd."], ["Ann L.", "When I am still thinking about a meal I had the next day, and am planning what I want to order on a return visit, I know I've hit on a new favorite place! \u00a0I had dinner here with a friend last night before heading to a show at IRT, so we arrived promptly at 5 when they opened to make sure we wouldn't be late for the 7PM show. \u00a0 We were glad we arrived that early; tables filled quickly!We were greeted by the owner, who was very friendly and welcoming and our server was eager and able to talk about the menu and wines. \u00a0 As others have mentioned, the complimentary prosecco, served while customers peruse the menus, is a really nice touch. \u00a0 We started with the Brussels sprouts everyone is talking about, and they are truly delicious! \u00a0 They were crispy and nicely seasoned; one order was good to share since we knew we were ordering a few more courses, but I could easily eat a vat of these if I weren't trying to save \u00a0room for other things! \u00a0 We then both had the butternut squash bisque. \u00a0Oh, this was good! \u00a0It has a slightly spicy kick, and is topped with what we think was basil oil and basil marshmallows. \u00a0I absolutely loved the combination of flavors! \u00a0 We both had the steelhead trout for our entrees. \u00a0 The fish was flavorful, fresh, and prepared perfectly! \u00a0Crispy skin and moist, tender fish seems so hard to find, but they are doing it here! \u00a0 The sunchokes and pomegranate with grapefruit sauce was amazing! \u00a0 For dessert, we both had the pot de creme s'mores marshmallow and absolutely loved that as well! \u00a0The chocolate was rich and creamy with an excellent chocolate flavor, and the marshmallow topping, along with the dusting of ash, really conjures up the image of a campfire. \u00a0 I know the ash \u00a0may sound odd, but it really does work! \u00a0 \u00a0The wine list is quite nice, and there are a decent number of bottles under $30, and glasses as low as $5 which is really unique and appreciated! \u00a0 Speaking of cost, my entire bill, including tax and tip, for half an appetizer, a glass of wine, soup, an entree and dessert was $49. \u00a0I am used to payingmuch more for that many courses of this quality of food!Service was excellent. \u00a0Courses were timed nicely with food coming out promptly, but without rushing. \u00a0 Our server was attentive and truly seemed to be \u00a0enjoying her job. \u00a0 Parking was not a problem; they do have a small lot, but there is a great deal of street parking nearby. \u00a0 We made it to the 7PM show at IRT without any trouble, so we will likely be back before future shows! \u00a0I'm truly looking forward to my next visit!"], ["Kaitlyn H.", "I met some friends here last night and we had a wonderful experience!

We called ahead and arrived just in time to drink a quick glass of wine before sitting down. Let me break down our experience a little more:Ambiance: The restaurant, while small, has fully utilized their space. With the covered deck and ample amount of windows it creates a truly magical ambiance that literally glows from within. It's casual enough to go wearing jeans but dressy enough for a special occasion. It's intimate size makes it feel that much more special!Service: Everyone we encountered at Tinker Street was friendly, knowledgable, and clearly excited to be working there! \u00a0Service was professional without being pretentious. Warm without being intrusive. The food recommendations were spot on. \u00a0But our favorite part? \u00a0They treated us like we were already regulars (which we will be!!)Food: Last but certainly not least - the food! \u00a0I went with a group of four and top to bottom everything we ate was perfection. \u00a0We started with a cheese plate (perfect for sharing) and the BEST brussels sprouts I have ever eaten. Then it was the trout, scallops, and fresh pappardelle. \u00a0Finally it was the crepe cake and s'mores pot de creme. \u00a0The food was simply fantastic, prices were very reasonable, and we loved that there were so many healthy and vegetarian options. \u00a0All in all it was the BEST meal we have had in ages! We live four blocks away and feel so lucky to have had such an amazing restaurant open up down the street. \u00a0Thank you for choosing Herron Morton Place, we will be back (and often!!)"], ["Lesley M.", "Tinker Street blew us away on first visit. Its a very quaint neighborhood restaurant with excellent curb appeal. We were greeted immediately and although it was very crowded the wait was not bad. They don't take reservations and everyone in your party needs to be present to be seated, FYI! They started our meal with a shot of Prosecco! I'm not sure if this is a regular thing but it made us feel special. The waiter goes through the menu, gave us great descriptions for the items we had questions about and helped us pair our wine. Its all hands on deck...when I say service was excellent I mean EXCELLENT! My water glass didn't get below half full. I am a huge proponent of customer service and they nailed it! I'll be back for service alone. Now to the food! I don't think they have anything bad but the fries with hemp seed dip were just the right starter. Very sharable. Then my husband and I split the Morell Bisque! Absolutely phenomenal! I hate its only seasonal. Hubby got the Sirloin and I got the Lamb (we were feeling red meat) and both were cooked to perfection! We ended with the S'more dessert and it paired great with the Malbec!!! Great experience and I can't wait to go back!"], ["Luigi M.", "A shout out first to Kelly and Peter (staff and owner) for their exemplary graciousness and warmth.Staff passionate, menu and wine list well curated, service thoughtful, timely and achieves the difficult balance of attentiveness and restraint, the menu offerings I enjoyed deftly done, hugely satisfying and their preparation, well, inspired.My personal two rules of gustatory excellence:-The material has to do the talking; ingredients must be superlative, they are the show--the prep is there to accentuate, compliment and unlock their potential but not compete with them for attention. Spot on.- I can taste when there is real heart in the cooking--you can see the kitchen from the level of attention being given and you can taste when someone with a vibrant palate is actually involved, tasting and is passionate about it arriving on you plate singing. The selections I sampled (shishito peppers, roasted beets, salmon, sweet corn soup) possessed these qualities in full voice."], ["Morgan G.", "So glad to welcome Tinker Street to the neighborhood. Definitely one of Indy's best restaurants. Peter George, owner, was so delightful when we were there. So hands on and friendly. Great service. Great intimate ambiance. And the food was awesome - loved my scallops. Also, it was packed, but we called ahead to reserve a table. They gave us an hour wait so by the time we showed up, only had to wait ten more minutes.The patio will be so awesome in the summer."], ["Dawn Z.", "What a lovely evening! \u00a0The restaurant is an eye-pleasing addition to the neighborhood. The parking lot is small but there was plenty of street parking. We came at 5:45 on a Friday and it was already hopping. Luckily there were tables available (they do not take reservations). Our waiter was friendly and checked on us regularly. The complimentary prosecco was a nice touch and delicious. They have a great wine list, no beer. We started with the chilled squash \"noodle\" pad Thai and like everyone else has said, it was fresh and delicious. I had the shrimp & grits - nice plump large prawns and perfectly-cooked grits with a flavorful bisque-like sauce. Hubby had the burger. This night it came with mushrooms & Swiss (I'm assuming toppings change with the seasons) and he said it was among the best burgers in the city - juicy and flavorful and unctuous, even if he did hold the mushrooms. We didn't have dessert but will definitely get some next time. Neighboring tables had some and they looked awesome!!"], ["Maggie S.", "For our first visit, we made a reservation on Open Table and were quickly seated at our two-top. We thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere and complimentary prosecco \"shot\". The sommelier was knowledgable and candid about the wine selections. Our server was friendly, chatty and attentive, and listened when we had concerns about a couple of dishes. As others have mentioned, the owner was friendly, gracious and appreciative of our patronage as we left.To start, I ordered a salad that had pickled onion and other good bits, but it was unfortunately drowning in overly tangy dressing. Literally, it was dripping off the greens. The follow-up appetizer was just okay: whole roasted carrots with a peppercorn yoghurt sauce. Beautiful presentation, but (here's the theme for the night) a bit bland. My husband ordered a crab salad with gelee presented in a small mason jar that came with bread. Again, lovely presentation, but lacking in flavor. We started to wonder if we were the only ones in the restaurant missing salt.... For the entree I had the shrimp and grits with chow-chow. The grilled shrimp were tasty, but again the dish lacked salt and a depth of flavor (and I have eaten a lot of shrimp and grits dishes in my day). My husband had the same underwhelming experience with his lamb dish, which was a little *too* rare and tepid (had to be sent back to reheat). When we expressed concern about lack of salt to our server, she indicated that because the owner was a cyclist and health conscious, the dishes were purposely made more \"healthy,\" i.e., light on the salt, to showcase the \"natural\" flavors of the food. (Hmm, I am pretty sure that salt helps pull out the flavor in food, rather than making it unhealthy for the majority of diners.) The server was happy to bring us a salt grinder. However, we felt that salt/pepper should already be out on the table so food can be seasoned as desired. This is one of my pet peeves at restaurants; never assume your salt/pepper levels are appropriate for all tastes and don't maker diners feel awkward by having to ask for it.For dessert, I ordered the mint chocolate chip grasshopper bar sundae. The mint is all-natural (i.e., not green), which was refreshing. However, it seemed like the chocolate brownie itself was missing something to make it decadent; it was a bit \"crunchy\" rather than smooth and soft. The portion was a good size for ending a meal.Tinker Street is a little gem in an up-and-coming neighborhood and deserving of support. There are many vegetarian and vegan options on the menu, with exciting combinations of seasonal ingredients. That said, I would be willing to go back and try some other options to see how they have refined their process. The outdoor seating looks like a great spot for a glass of wine and conversation, too. Maybe next time we'll go for that kind of experience rather than spending the $$ on a full-course meal."], ["Ranay B.", "Peter!!!!Loved talking to you...love what your doing over there at Tinker Street! \u00a0Food-5 starService- 5 starPeter-5 starWaitstaff menu, recipe knowledge-5 starGo...don't hesitate...Prices excellent too!The designer in me wants to decorate this place...the name screams steampunk decor!I have to drive 1.5 hour on my only day off...but I do it because I love this place!!!"], ["Jill G.", "Definitely a new fave of ours in Indy! Great service, great food, great venue! We went on a beautiful, cool Fall Saturday night and by 6:15 the place was already hopping! Peter, who is a wonderful host, invited us to have a drink while we waited for an indoor table (our preference) and very quickly a server was already greeting us. Our bottle of wine (of which they have a wide choice and realistic prices) came quickly and it was fun sitting at a large, common table sipping our wine and chatting with others - it made the 20-30 minute wait on a table enjoyable...very \"neighborhoodish\" even among strangers.They have some seating outdoors (heated by lamps) which really brings an open European feel to the place...if it's cool enough, you're offered a blanket for your legs or shoulders-outdoor seating was packed on this 50 degree evening!We opted to share small plates and soup-great choice as we got to try a variety of flavors. We had the Brussels sprouts, Chicken Terrine w/ jalape\u00f1os, Smoked Wild Salmon, Pumpkin Gnocchi and Tomato Basil soup. A great blend of tastes, coupling the more bold (sprouts, salmon, jalape\u00f1os) with the more neutral (chicken, gnocchi). \u00a0Our table neighbors had the Walleye and the sirloin burger, which they raved about.We were so full we didn't have room for dessert, so we might actually start with that next time! Soon!"], ["Emma C.", "Excellent from start to finish. If you're looking for a romantic date spot this might be it. Portions aren't large so order many plates, but expect for the food quality and flavors to blow you away. Service is excellent, and dessert was wonderful. We will be back!"]], "Aristocrat Pub & Restaurant": [["Rachael H.", "As far as authentic pubs go, Aristocrat definitely has the dark and cozy feel that you would expect from an English-style watering hole. I plopped down at the bar area on a cold, rainy evening. My gal pal and I had just attended a Yelp event in the upstairs room. We were a little inebriated and wanted to grab a bite and let the booze wear off. \u00a0I loved the decor in the upstairs room.... Almost like an old library meets a speakeasy. It had an elegance to it that made you feel elite in a way. There was a small bar off to one side and then a larger room with tables and chairs in the other room. The staff upstairs were very polite and helpful.The bar staff downstairs in the pub were also very friendly, but not overly attentive. Sometimes you want this and sometimes you don't depending on the mood. We were happy to sit back, chat for a bit, and have a little something to eat without being bothered.Aristocrat offers the typical pub fare...soups, salads, sammiches, and various English entr\u00e9es. We weren't looking for anything too filling, so I ordered the chicken pot pie soup and my mate ordered the quesadilla. It did take a little time for the kitchen to bring out our food, and normally this would be offputting if I wasn't trying to sober up.My soup was piping hot -- perfect for a cold rainy evening! It had a really nice cream base with veggies and shredded chicken and was topped with a delicate and fluffy puff pastry. I don't normally order creamy soups, but this was definitely a good choice for the moment. My friend indulged in her quesadilla and said it was reasonable but nothing special for a quesadilla.I really appreciated that there weren't too many TVs visible in the bar area. I absolutely can't stand the distraction of a telly screeching in the background when you were trying to enjoy a nice conversation and meal with a friend.Aristocrat is definitely worth a visit if you want a quick bite of comfort food and it looks like they had a nice selection of beer too."], ["Tom J.", "What i like about this place? The atmosphere, the music, the people. What I don't like? The food and the horrible service. Food at Aristocrat is alright. I did enjoy some of the salads, particularly the Greek salad and the fish and chips were okay, but not worth $12+ price tag. That's about it. The bangers and mash I tried were just kind of bland and boring and it put me off from trying the other foods. Service was terrible unfortunately. I had to ask three time for a soda before I got one. No apology for the wait or anything. Our food took a while to get to us as well, but I was in a deep conversation with a friend so it didn't bother me too much. I do like the atmosphere of this place a lot. I'm a suck for the old school pub theme, especially around the bar area they have. I'm sure some people will find some value in this place, but it's not worth the price in my opinion."], ["D P.", "The mission: Try the crab cakes and a cocktail at a friend's suggestion. Succeeded in both plus a separate sampler for tasting purposes. \u00a0Drink (basil bulleit) was good enough but the food was super basic. \u00a0Like, cafeteria basic. \u00a0Good ambience and the staff was nice, but man.....that food was edible and that's about it. \u00a0Probably wouldn't go back save for maybe a Ripple sip. \u00a0Turning in my Aristocard....sorry!"], ["Katie U.", "After returning to Aristocrat, I feel I must update my review and downgrade it to two stars. I think they have a great location and I like the old English pub ambiance, but that's where the positives stop for me.Both times, my food has just been \"meh.\" Not utterly inedible, just not that great. If you're going to go out to eat, don't you want it to be a great (or fantastic) experience? I do! My black bean soup was literally just black beans with some onion added...no flavor at all. My entree was a nice sized piece of salmon, but was dull. I love my salmon, but this was pretty lackluster. Tasted dry and was almost a brownish hue, instead of pink. The dill sauce came drizzled over the top (I prefer it on the side) and the vegetables tasted buttery.I really want to like Aristocrat more, but I just haven't been wow-ed with either of my experiences."], ["Robin L.", "Such a great neighborhood establishment. I like coming here for quick work lunches and with kiddo on the weekend. Their menu is HUGE and offers everything from taco salads to enormous burgers to a killer veggie pita. Kids menu is pretty typical. The staff are always incredibly friendly and welcoming. I really like the fact that this is a place that is ejoyed by adults and kids, which is surprisingly hard to find. So, big thumbs up for happy parents and happy kids."], ["Dennis R.", "This was my first trip to Aristocrat Pub & Restaurant. \u00a0It was a wonderful Saturday evening and the place was very busy. \u00a0We didn't have to wait long for a table (for 4) and we scored by getting seated in the \"performance\" room! \u00a0Live entertainment from a local group singing the songs of my heritage, celtic songs, drifting through the room.Apparently this place was the victim of a fire but the facility was wonderfully redone. \u00a0We started with soft drinks and an order of Aristocrat Beer-Cheese Dip and wings. \u00a0The Beer-Cheese Dip lived up to the Yelp reviews, tasty, awesome bread and the dip was wonderful. \u00a0My daughter fancies herself a real wing connosier. \u00a0She gave the wings a B.We ordered two Hoosier Tenderloin Sandwiches, Fish and Chips and Chicken Tenders.

I don't think I've ever ordered a pina colada. \u00a0If I have, it was definitely in a beach-type situation and never in the middle of Indiana. It was definitely outside of the box, but it was strong and tasty. \u00a0Perfect for me at that moment. \u00a0Husband had a variety of stronger bourbon-based beverages, but also tried the 1933 Side Car and was very pleased.The food was kind of eh. \u00a0With the exception of the Baked Brie appetizer, the food was so-so at best. \u00a0We probably wouldn't bother with having dinner here again, but we'll certainly be by for a drink and the brie again. \u00a0Especially if we're treated to the same kind of fun atmosphere Smitty and Violet provided!"], ["DeAnna P.", "I can't believe it took me so long to come back here! \u00a0We came ages ago and the experience was just \"meh.\" \u00a0This time blew me away. \u00a0Every single thing that came to our table was delicious. \u00a0Fish and chips? \u00a0Perfect. \u00a0Tenderloin? \u00a0As big as my head, cooked and seasoned to perfection, and even reheated in the microwave the next day, it was still tasty. \u00a0Pasta with blackened chicken? Perfect blend of richness and heat. \u00a0They also have a great selection of beers and a rocking French onion soup. \u00a0Service could be a wee bit more friendly and faster. \u00a0It was hard to tell if our server had too many tables or what, but refills and taking our order took a bit longer than we liked. \u00a0If you can, sit on the patio. \u00a0It is shaded and smoke free, so it is very comfortable. \u00a0I cannot wait to get back.

Amazing! The beer cheese dip with the apples and pretzel bread is one of the best appetizers in Indy.

Sit at the bar & mingle with the regulars for great conversation & beer, or be seated at a table for a cozy dinner date. Baked brie with slices of apple & French bread is meltingly marvelous, & so is the beer cheese. There's many different salads to choose from to suit your preferences. The hummus plate is my current fave; house made, with plenty of crisp veggies & warm, soft pita bread for dipping. The veggie burger or the Napa Valley wrap is great if you're wanting more of a meal, just substitute onion rings or fries for your chips.

Flavor though? None. The cut was stringy and tough. I brought it home and used my tenderizer & seasoning on it.

They also have an excellent liquor selection and the prices on drinks are very reasonable. The atmosphere is warm and inviting thanks to the wood trim and Olde English accents.

Service was a little slow from one of the bar servers, and my water wasn't refilled once since I had run out out early on. I ordered the Italian Harvest Pasta, but I was really disappointed by the flavor. I compared the taste to eating ramen noodles. Server had not asked us once if we liked our food.

The restaurant experienced some kind of server snafu which wouldn't allow them to process credit cards, \u00a0so while we waited for them to get the computer straightened out Kaitlyn regaled us with stories. She was simply fantastic and helped make what could have been a tense time absolutely enjoyable. Ask for this woman when you dine there...your life will be enriched by the experience."], ["Bob S.", "One of the main reasons the Aristocrat is getting a 5 star rating from me, is because of the variety of dining experiences that can be had. I go there often just to get to-go orders. If you want to have a quick bite and maybe some conversation in a cozy environment, you can hit the bar. If you'd like a more formal dinner, then the indoor seating is nice. If you want to enjoy a nice night in good weather, then the patio is very nice. Overall, I've been enjoying their food for nearly 8 years now. Some of my favorite items on the menu are nearly all of the appetizers, the pub salad, club sandwich, fish and chips, tenderloin, and their pastas. In the years before Yelp was around, I nearly gave up on this place due to terribly slow and inconsistent service in the dining area, so I stuck to the bar. I'm happy to report that I haven't had any issues the past 5 or so years."], ["Chris R.", "If you want to enjoy brunch and not wait an hour on Sunday at 9:30 AM, check this place out."], ["Bethany S.", "I will say that the food at the 'Crat doesn't really excite me, but I am still a fan. This is because the two times I've been here have been on Saturday nights to see Hogeye Navvy, a fantastic Irish/folk band, which I highly recommend doing. They play almost every week; they have regulars who know all the words to every song, but even if you don't, some of the choruses are repetitive and simple enough that you can quickly catch on and sing along merrily with the rest of the dining room. It's really a blast.The drinks are good too - they have a fantastic selection of cocktails, beers, wines, and more types of scotch than I've ever seen. And the service is good. But you should go on a Saturday night and see Hogeye Navvy, and request the song about the pirate losing body parts (it's my favorite)."], ["K G.", "I was visiting from out of town, was tired from a long drive, and my host recommended the Aristocrat for an easy meal. It did not disappoint. The service in the bar was fast and friendly. I had a garden salad and black bean soup, which were both hearty and tasty.

The food is great (especially the salads....Granny Smith Apple and Strawberry Blues....amazing), tons of different beers on tap, great service and a really nice atmosphere. I didn't live in the area before they had a fire and had to rebuild, but if you haven't been for a couple years, do yourself a favor and try it again. It was redone really nicely and has such a cozy, old English pub feel. They also have a really nice outdoor area for when the weather is warm."], ["Kara G.", "I've only been here twice and only in the past few months. I'm sad I missed out on such a great place for so long! It's beautiful inside and out, with awesome food (maybe the best fish n' chips in town), a fantastic beer selection, and friendly service. But the thing that really impressed me was the host/owner when 5 friends and I dined recently. Not only was he stylish and funny, he took a personal interest in getting us a fantastic table outside. When the group at the one he was eyeing lingered for a long time after paying, he pulled strings to get us a different table outside. It didn't have as nice of a view, but we were hungry and very happy to be seated. He even checked up on us to make sure we were satisfied. That kind of attention really sets a place apart."], ["Beth R.", "I want to express how angry and disappointed I am with the customer service I received when trying to plan my husband's surprise birthday party in the Oxford Room. \u00a0I had to call 5 different times (I even went in person once) to get any kind of information. \u00a0During one phone call, I was put on hold mid-sentence while I was talking. \u00a0I didn't know I had been put on hold until a different employee picked up the phone. \u00a0When I finally got to talk to the GM, she was unfriendly and short with me. \u00a0I have worked in the service industry for almost 15 years and if I had a customer who was as upset as I was, any of the companies I have worked for would have done everything they could to make sure I was a happy customer. \u00a0Needless to say, I did not have my party here and I will not be returning to The Aristocrat any time soon. \u00a0I also made sure all of my family members, friends, and co-workers knew about my experience."], ["Chris S.", "Aristocrat is a traditional pub that happens to be walking distance from my abode. \u00a0If you like old wood covered pubs this is a must stop.

BEER! Aristocrat brings it with a huge selection on tap. Midwest Locals, West Coast, European, all present and constantly rotating. \u00a0Why the four stars? Service and a lack of drink specials. I find myself at the competition way more often because of good drink specials. Paying $5+ for a \u00a0pint really limits my drinking. The service isn't really bad, just not ever that friendly. It really is a great place, the food and beer are first class."], ["J. C.", "Nice atmosphere, food was mediocre. It's kind of annoying that fries are an upcharge. I had the cherry chicken salad sandwich which was served on a croissant, but without any additional toppings (no lettuce, tomato, etc.). The kettle chips were crunchy, but had too much pepper/seasoning for my taste. Kids menu was ok, but fruit was not offered as a side dish option among the usual fries, chips and veggie choices. It had to be ordered a la carte. It seems like a much better place to go for a beer than to take the family for dinner."], ["John Z.", "Okay, so, I had only been here twice before the fire for late night drinks -- one last beer or two before calling it a night. I'll admit, I didn't find it the most comfortable bar... it just wasn't my style. However, the staff was friendly. I had never eaten here before, and other than it not being 'my favorite place', I didn't really have an opinion on this place. I felt bad that this place practically burned to the ground. While it's been closed, I've heard so many people talk about how much they had missed this placed and they practically salivated waiting for it to reopen. So, a week or two after this place reopened, the girlfriend and I decided to give it a shot. We walked into a reception area where we found two women serving as hostesses. This is where first impressions are important. Be friendly and welcoming to your customers. We informed them that there were two of us for dinner and the older hostess who sported some ridiculously large white rimmed 'owl glasses' grabbed two menus and walked into the dining room. Since this typically means that she is going to seat you, we followed her, but were quickly admonished as she turned around and held up a hand, snapping 'No, don't follow me!'. WTF? So we sat tight in the adjoining waiting area (which is a nice well-thought-out addition). The owlish hostess walked back and forth in the dining room before finally setting two menus down at an open booth. She then looked over at us - waiting where we had been first admonished - and then simply pointed at the table. Such warmth.We sat down and started perusing the beer menu. We heard they had a ginormous draft list and were indeed impressed. My girlfriend eyed a seasonal pumpkin ale and I had my eye on a Flat 12 Joe Brahma porter. Our waiter arrived and asked for our drink order. She requested a taste of the pumpkin ale before committing to a pint that might be exceedingly pumpkiny or sickeningly sweet and was told 'No, we don't do samples.' This was the first time ever that I've ever been told such a thing at a bar that serves something other Bud, Miller, and Coors. She asks if he has ever tried this beer and if he liked it. The reply: 'No, I'm not much of a drinker.' She wasn't going to gamble on a pumpkin beer so decided to continue looking at the list but told me to go ahead and order. Before I could get my order past my lips, the waiter simply turned away and said 'I'll be back.' WTF again'?The waiter returns again and we are able to successfully place beer orders... While he fetches the beers, I suggest that we get our dinner selections decided because this perpetual game of 'tag' we are playing with our waiter is getting frustrated. The beers arrive and we order the beer cheese with bread and apples for an appetizer. Plus, she gets the turkey burger served plain - no lettuce, tomatoes, etc. I get the pork tenderloin sandwich, also plain, with a side of fries, honey mustard on the side.Ten minutes later, the waiter returns with the beer cheese, sets it down, and walks away. I tear off a slice of bread, dip it in cheese, and raise it to my lips. I can immediate sense this cheese sauce is tepid at best. It takes a couple minutes to hail down our waiter and have him take it back to reheat. When it was returned only 2 minutes later, the bread was freshened and a new pot of cheese has been provided (it's new because the rim of the pot is clean and the cheesy film that settled on the top is gone). The crock of cheese is warm on the outside, so we're hopeful, but the cheese is still cold. WTF? When someone sends something back for being cold, you send it back in two minutes, and don't think to check temperature before sending it out again? Three or four more minutes, waiter hailed, cheese returned to kitchen. Five minutes later, it is returned, finally hot.The entrees arrive as we finish our appetizer. Everything looks good upon initial inspection. However, after the waiter leaves, we discover her turkey burger has been slathered in wet lettuce shreds on the bottom of the sandwich... Unwilling to send something back to the kitchen yet again, she scrapes away the offending iceberg lettuce. I'm about to dig into my food and notice that my honey mustard has been forgotten. Luckily, the pork tenderloin was well-seasoned and didn't need it. The pork tenderloin was actually really good. I was pleased with that. The french fries were dry and simply not very good. I think they were simply food service fries that were not well prepared.We finished dinner otherwise uneventfully, got the check, and although we were never promised this, we were surprised that we were still charged for the appetizer. You'd think when they have to serve it to you three times, they'd try to ameliorate your frustration somehow.I know this place is 'new' and they're still working out the kinks - especially with a bunch of new staff. So, I'll give it another shot, but Aristocrat, you've got work to do in the meantime."], ["David F.", "Ahhh, the Aristocrat. \u00a0I was very upset when I heard about the fire. \u00a0I was concerned that it may not come back, or that it would be different in a bad way, when it came back.Turns out I was worried for nothing.

It used to be a nice, local family place to go have good, simple food and nicely poured drinks, but has turned into something trying to be what it's not. The ownership is lacking of anything resembling community and tries to legally fight to prevent any new competitors from coming into the neighborhood. It's bad for the community and bad for business in general.While the new environment, after a curious fire destroyed the old space, is adequately done, it's nothing spectacular and lost much of the former charm of the old space.

Twenty Below Coffee Porter actually is really similar, but there was something a little extra in the pumpkin that made it special. I tried the Punkin Chunkin too - it was good, but it smelled better than it tasted (and to be fair, it smelled delicious). We also got the black bean burger and the veggie mac and cheese (which was their special of the day). Both had a bit of a kick to them and were really good.

In addition to offering many excellent microbrew brands, they make their own beers.Their Oktoberfest was a sweet, cidery, clean brew, which went well with the hamburger.The coffee stout was deep, flavorful, smooth, creamy and firm, easily better than a certain corporate brand.Bonus!

GET THE CHEESE CURDS. \u00a0OMG. \u00a0I made our server bring a to-go box just so I would not devour them all in one sitting. \u00a0We also got the Hot Pretzels as an app so the hubs would have some pre-lunch noms. \u00a0They were decent, the cheese was thin - so I stuck with the mustard for dipping.For lunch the hubs opted for the Tex Burger (no cheese) -- and he was very happy. \u00a0I narrowed down all of the options I really wanted to the Shrimp and Grits -- mostly based on the recommendation from our attentive and amazing server Ryan. \u00a0Thank you, Ryan! \u00a0The Shrimp and Grits was the most savory S&G dish I have ever had. \u00a0The grits were *just* cheesy enough to make an impact but not so overwhelming that they overpowered the dish. \u00a0So well balanced and delicious. \u00a0So much so that I kept eating despite being obscenely full causing me to have to roll out of there. \u00a0Seriously -- so good.Another highlight for me was the beer selection. \u00a0I often have trouble filling a flight of beers with all 'dark' beers... not here. \u00a0I found enough to fill TWO flights. \u00a0Smile. \u00a0The selection was amazing and again, Ryan's suggestions were spot on. \u00a0Flights are reasonable and priced per beer ($2-$3 per) and so worth it. Just a heads up -- trying multiple apps and beers adds up for 2 people. \u00a0I don't think we planned on having a $70 lunch, but it happened....and I cannot wait to do it all over again."], ["Sarah B.", "Overall I would definitely suggest trying out twenty tap. And if you go be sure to get the cheese curds with the chimichiri aoli for an appetizer. I have driven from Avon just for those suckers! Twenty taps food is always on point. I had the tomato bisque with what the waiter described as having an Asian fusion taste to it and it was amazing. It brought what I love about tomato bisque and spicy food together in a beautiful marriage of flavor. My burger tasted great as usual although it was slightly undercooked this visit. Usually they cook it well to specifications. My bf and son both had Cubans and sucked them down. Although I feel like the Cuban is a much smaller option than one of their burgers so if you're starving I'd suggest a burger. The only down side is sometimes the wait time during peak hours due to twenty tap having a limited space so go during off hours or during the week. Also the wait time to get the food from the time you order seems a bit slow but oh so worth the wait in my opinion. Wait staff is always very friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about both the food and beer menu's. I'll be back for sure."], ["Anna B.", "In town for the weekend and stopped in here for dinner last night! I am a craft beer lover so I was excited to try some local taps. The bartender was fantastic in letting us try many options before selecting.

I'm all about new twists on old favorites, and this one was fantastic! My normally traditional wing-loving dad couldn't get enough of them! We sat outside and all ordered different burgers. All were great! I had a turkey burger, it hit the spot, and also sampled a bite of the basic burger and the wake-up. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu!The only down-side is the food was a little slow coming out. But the service was great and the atmosphere was relaxed and fun.

(Except Mondays, no lunch. Wah.) The beer selection is on point and the food is pretty darn good. Always consistent and comforting. I love the vegan bahn mi, lettuce wraps, roasted veg salad, fries, and black bean burger. They have a nice selection of vegetarian options and often a tasty soup I can eat as well.

They make this place unique and you'll be hooked once you try them. \u00a0You get two dipping sauces with your order. I recommend the chimichurri and the chipotle! Easily shared with 4 people. \u00a0Hint: hold onto the left over sauces when you're done and dip your fries in when your entree comes! As far as drinks, it's pretty strictly a beer joint, but they do it oh so well! Affordable and a great, ever-changing variety. \u00a0A couple things to be aware of: \u00a01) no reservations and it can be pretty busy weekend nights. \u00a0Put your name in and get a beer at the bar while you wait, or take a walk and they'll text you when your table is ready. 2) not a great place to watch a big game. \u00a0No TVs. \u00a03) no parking lot. \u00a0Hit up the street parking.

Truly top notch beer selections skewing heavily toward local ( a big plus in my book) and an extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic staff to help with the hard what-to-order decisions. Very important with a tap list like this one. Very happy with the food as well. I had the Mac & cheese bayou style, which was very tasty and filling. It's on the apps menu but a large is a substantial entree. The bar staff is superb, which really makes a beer bar these days. Great recommendations and quick to hook you up with a sample so you can make the hard decisions. Last but not least, super cool, diverse clientele, who I've really enjoyed hanging out with tonight!!"], ["Meredith S.", "Wahoo, I love Twenty Tap! This is probably my favorite (or at least top 3) in the SoBro area. \u00a0It's within walking distance of my house and their beer selection is top notch. We stopped by yesterday on one of the first nice day's of the year and somehow were lucky enough to snag a patio seat. I love Twenty Tap's patio.... my only complaint is that the restaurant is not big enough to accommodate all of the people who want to enjoy the food and drink. Anyway. I highly recommend the cheese curds (YUM) as well as the the pressed turkey sandwich which, in my opinion, tastes just like Thanksgiving. \u00a0I also love their simple salad as a side to the sandwiches. \u00a0It is simple as the name states, but it's very light and refreshing with grated cheese, fennel and some sort of vinaigrette dressing. Not to be missed! Boyfriend got the black bean burger which was also excellent. Love the quality of food and that they use a lot of local vendors and ingredients. Everything's fresh and the beer is great too."], ["Jennifer N.", "After we checked into our hotel in Indianapolis, we wanted to hit a place with good food and good beer. I came across Twenty Tap on yelp and decided to check it out. No regrets.Great beer selection with the majority of them costing only $5. They also offer the pint of the day for only $3.50! What a steal. I was pretty overwhelmed by the beer list, but for a beer lover like myself..that's not a bad thing. I love being able to try new beers especially if they're local.Friendly service- our waiter was extremely attentive and helpful. The d\u00e9cor is meh..looks like a regular bar/restaurant. But it was pretty clean, so that's a plus.Now for the food...Beer cheese curds - good flavor but tad salty - chipotle & chimichurri sauce not too memorable. Chipotle tastes good but no kick to it like you would expect from a chipotle sauce.Smoked brisket sandwich - definitely had a kick to it when I ate it alone without the bread. Taste (not texture) for some reason reminded me of beef jerky. Maybe the sweetness of the sauce? Not too sure, but it was tasty nonetheless. Oh and the portion size was HUGE. I tried a bite of my friend's Cuban sandwich and it was good as well. Nice crunch from the toasted bread. The fries were amazinggg. Perfectly seasoned and nice and crunchy. Overall - I really liked my visit to Twenty Tap and if I were a local I would be regular. I come to Indy at least once a year for a game, so I'll be sure to come back here!"], ["Joe S.", "Service was fast and friendly and I was impressed by the staff but the food was very mediocre. \u00a0The beer selection was excellent but 1 of the 3 beers I had must have been a bad poor and was served warm. \u00a0So it was average."], ["Elaine S.", "Good is ok for bar food.

I look forward to reading your 5 star review\" I assured him I had already reviewed Twenty Tap and given it 5 stars\". Imagine my surprise when I discovered I had yet to review them. I can't say much more than what has already been said, so I'm going to sum it up plain and simple. Plan to wait. They don't do call ahead or reservations. They have an awesome patio and a fun bar with tons of local beer. Enjoy your wait and have a drink. Unlike some other nearby places that have hundreds of beers on tap, they have about 30 beers and the bartenders can actually tell you things about what they have. They also have their own brewery downstairs (20 below)If you are vegetarian or vegan, enjoy that section of the menu because they do it right. If you're not, get a burger. They are fantastic. Any of them will do because they do them all perfectly. Also order cheese curds with the horseradish sauce. If you've only ever had frozen cheese curds (think Culver's) then you are in for a real treat with these freshly beer battered heavenly morsels. Service can be hit or miss, but its usually because they are incredibly busy all the time. The servers know their shit, it just takes a while sometimes because they get backed up. Overall, a clear 5 star place."], ["Brooke K.", "Ten Tips For Twenty Tap!1.) Always order the cheese curds! Whatever you do, always order the curds. 2.) They offer a well crafted rotating list of local & Midwestern beers on draft. 3.) Beer menu changes daily and is readily available to view on their website. 4.) They serve their own beer (Twenty Below) brewed in their basement. 5.) Those cheese curds are amazing!6.) French Breakfast Burger (Bacon jam) do I need to say more? 7.) Space is small be prepared to wait a while for a table. 8.) They source locally: Fischer Farms beef & Smoking Goose meats. 9.) Not in the mood for a burger? Order the delicious spicy pressed Cuban. 10.) Did I mention the cheese curds are extremely Curdalicious? Even better dipped in Sriracha & roasted garlic aioli."], ["Vam K.", "I love that they have so many vegan options! The buffalo cauliflower is incredible (though I don't like that they use the term \"wings\"), especially dipped in their vegan ranch. I even like the way they cut their celery into thin strips! Whenever I go with my non vegan friends, they always start with poutine, and from the way they rave about it, I'm sure it great. I tend to stick with the vegan bahn mi for my entree, though sometimes they add too much sauce and it ends up tasting sweet. Luckily the o e time I tried to venture off and try the black bean burger, I had a knowledgable bartender who let me know that even with modifications, the black bean patty is not vegan. Service is hit or miss, but from my experience the bartenders always provide great service-it's the servers I've had difficulties with."], ["Aaron B.", "Twenty Tap has great food. My wife and I have tried several things off the menu and almost everything is great. Their fries might even beat out Hopcat's \"crack fries\"!The beers don't beat other Broad Ripple options, though. Hopcat has more on-tap variety. And the Brew Pub and Brugge offer a lot more brewed in-house. I was also really dissapointed in my last visit because I ordered what was advertised as a \"nitro\" stout (i.e., Guinness clone) and got a flat, completely headless glass of beer. When I asked what happened to the head the waiter came up with all kinds of inventive answers before just switching it out for me. Inventive as in \"That's the way nitros are,\" \"We wanted you to have a full pint and not just foam,\" \"I can get a spoon to stir it with, that will release the bubbles,\" and \"The protein in the beer prevents the nitro from cascading and creating a head.\" All that was total silliness.

We split the cheese curds, which are awesome, then split the spicy Cuban sandwich (a regular Cuban but with pepperjack subbed for swiss and sriracha added), also awesome, with awesome fries. We had a bottle of Sriracha on the side for dipping the curds in along with the garlic and chimichurri aiolis. Yum, yum, yum. Portions here are good-sized, so unless you have a monstrous appetite splitting an entree and an app between 2 people will likely be plenty of food.

With a Pint of the Day for $3.50, plus a plethora (hint: more than twenty taps) of drafts from the Midwest and beyond, there's something for every palate. -Fried. Cheese. Curds. How have I lived my whole southern life without knowing these exist? It's like mozzarella sticks taken to a whole new chewy level. Amazing. Things that could improve:-Banh mi. Speaking frankly, here, banh mi should be on a French baguette so crispy and crunchy it hurts your teeth to bite it. This bread was more hot dog bun than baguette, and too soft to support the juicy pulled pork it encased. -Sauces. I really support what 20T is doing here with their variety of sauce options, but the ones I tried did not live up to the hype. The horseradish was underwhelming, to say the least--pretty much just a plain-jane aioli with zero kick. When I order horseradish, I want it to be a sinus bomb of flavor and heat; don't hold back. The sriracha sauce was great in theory, but when the bartender brings over a bottle of actual sriracha to accompany it, you know it won't be hot enough. The rosemary was by far the best, but even it could've been more herb-y. Sauces should be strong and flavor-filled and bold in small amounts to balance out their dipped counterparts. These just don't get there. Would still come back to try the other beers and the poutine, as well as for the cheese curds.

Aside from that, it was an enjoyable meal. My co-workers enjoyed their meals as well. Plenty of food per portion but not too much which is nice. Fair pricing and a heart establishment. The service was a little slow and it took a while to get our lunch out which was pretty inconvenient considering we were on our break from work.

The pressed turkey sandwich sounded good in theory, but in practice it just had too much going on. The cole slaw was not \"creamy,\" as the menu describes, but it wasn't bad, either. . . it was just kind of bland. Don't get me wrong: the food was decent, just not anything I'd go out of my way to go back for. The building is old and the inside was kind of generic, and for some reason reminded me of MacNivens. The tables were way too close together, similar to Cheesecake Factory, so you're right on top of the people to your right and left, which makes having anything other than a superficial conversation uncomfortable.

You betcha!After a wondrous dinner at Saigon restaurant in Lafayette Square, Indianapolis, a smaller group of friends and I decided to hit up Twenty Tap, which was a local watering hole in Indianapolis. The place was already crazy as it is, but we wanted to go drinking, so off we went. The ambiance was loud, as bars tend to be, but the ambiance atmosphere tends to mitigate any concerns about anything you may have about the world at the time. While I stopped myself at 4 beers that night, it didn't stop my friends from going into town. By the end of the night, we ended up calling a friend for a friend to pick her up, whereas a fiend and I decided to use his lyft app and organized a ride for us stupid drunks.There were local beers on tap, which I wanted to try out. Most of them came from Indiana area breweries, but there were regional imports as well. Twenty Taps is located at 5406 N College Avenue in the SoBro district in Indianapolis. We had to find street parking, since there was signage that said we could not park in the lot across from the business, which was a bummer. Like most bars and watering holes, Twenty Tap accepts credit cards, so that's a great thing. The beers were pretty good and it was a nice way to cap off Friday night, after a day of traveling, seeing the Indy Mini marathon expo, and having Pho at Saigon restaurant. I did taste test them cheese curds and it was decently good. There were no seating available, so we just stood around to the side and hang out talking while drinking beers and enjoying Friday night, knowing that the weekend is coming! Yay!The prices here are decent and comparable to other Gastropubs in the area. They have an extensive beer list, so it was impossible to pick just one. I had to pick just a few to savor some of the flavors of each beer that was offered. Service here is always spot on and happy that I came here with friends to drink and eat more.

I hope they don't get wiped out by HopCat, so I will be supporting them as much as I can. The cheese curds are totes amazeballs! Get em with the chimichurri sauce.

The mustard is so spicy and thick that Stefon from SNL might call it \"Indianapolis' Hottest Mustard.\" This appetizer comes with pickled vegetables that I could eat like candy for the rest of my life. I usually stick with one of the seasonal salad offerings, which change all of the time. The vegan Bahn Mi is out of this world, which matches the double fried fries that you can add to it.

I have only had a couple things off the menu, and what I got didn't stray much from just standard sausages, sauerkraut, and potato salad, but they were all delicious. They also have a large bar area inside with tons of seating that gets a lot more natural light and is covered in cool decorations. The rest of the inside space is a large events area that has a stage and seating for what looks like quite a few people. It is also the area that they use to host bands when it is too cold to be outside.The area that brings me back here consistently is their huge outdoor biergarten. It is a big space, that has a couple different bars and tons of seating at picnic tables scattered through the whole area. There is always a dance area in front of their really neat stage, and they have it separated into a couple different sections, one being more of a stage area and one being more of a socializing space. You can almost always guarantee during the summer that you will find great live music on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights. There is usually a $5 cover to get into the biergarten, and it gets full on most nights that they have music, so coming early is the best way to guarantee getting a table. The bars that are outside have a good selection of German beers that you can either purchase in a small or large size. I think that the large beer is pushing a liter in size and cost $9.50 when I was there last, which is a pretty good deal for a tasty German beer, although you better be thirsty if you order one because it is a lot of beer to drink before it gets warm. There is also food available outside, including some easy items like a pretzel and mustard or pizza by the slice. They have bathrooms behind the stage so you don't need to go inside and they are usually in decent shape, but can develop some long lines. The tables are usually bussed pretty well, but there is no waiter service.They get a little bit of everything in here as far as music goes, from country, to rock, to the always popular polka. The crowd ranges from college to retiree, and everybody always looks to be having a fun time with a crowd usually gathered in front of the stage for some dancing. The big open atmosphere makes it ideal for a large group, and the $5 cover is a cheap way to get a full night of live entertainment. The shows usually start around 7 PM, so you don't have to wait until late at night to find a fun place to hang out.This is the best place to spend a summer evening in Indy, so make sure you get check it out for yourself."], ["Bobby N.", "Rathskeller Biergarten! This Biergarten with the restored bandshell is fantastic. Always packed with people having fun. The place is big enough that you can find a picnic table to sit down enjoy some sausages, beer and conversation. Closer to the band shell there is a large dance floor and lots of beer and dancing. Two bars support the venue on the outside and another great bar on the inside so you will not find the lines tedious. Besides the beer choices are decent with great German and local brews. Heh, and the beer is available in these huge 32oz cups. Of course, steins and boots would be more fun but the plastic is much more reasonable considering the rugged nature of the walking surface. Great place for a late afternoon and early evening of fun."], ["Denny C.", "Just off Indianapolis' Mass Ave entertainment strip, the Rathskeller is a cavernous restaurant, bar and music club. \u00a0I went to the Rathskeller to hear a Celtic Rock band in their beer garden. \u00a0The venue was comfortable, fun, with a mini music festival atmosphere. \u00a0It was great. \u00a0Every city should have something like this Rathskeller when folks are in the mood for just casually hanging out. \u00a0It reminded me of taverns all over the city of Milwaukee. \u00a0However, the Rath was a surprise for Indianapolis, a city that's a heck of a lot more fun then its reputation."], ["Joie L.", "Absolutely delicious. Went here with a group of 11 for prom and reservations to service was courteous. There were a ton of people on a Saturday night but it wasn't as slow as you'd expect from that. The food portions were huge, especially for dinner. They were delicious, especially the pretzel. Definitely eat it with the mustard but only sparingly. Salad was so so. Dessert is a must. Everything I tried was delicious. Plus the interior is beautifully historic."], ["Brady R.", "I've only been here for the outdoor shows and beverages; I have not eaten here. That being said, this is an amazing venue! They showcase all sorts of different talent and genres. They have amazing beer (get the big one, it's a better deal!). It's a perfect venue for those spring/summer/fall evenings with friends. It does get a bit loud so be prepared to scream if you want to converse. Only downfall in my opinion are the outdoor restrooms. Not accessible and can get a bit gross at times after people have had a few drinks haha"], ["Jesse J.", "We visited for the devour downtown special and I wouldn't say anything was super special about the place except the decor was extremely impressive. The service could have been a lot better. I didn't eat one of my sides and my wife didn't like an item on her plate either but the lady seemed to not notice to comment on if we enjoyed it. The apps were the best part. The mushrooms were great and the bread pudding was great. Everything else was good for the $75 we spent. Undecided if we will give it another try because we have always heard other people saying how great it is."], ["Colleen D.", "This place is great. Sat at the bar had a pretzel with the hottest mustard I've ever had - it was amazing! Also had the ahi tuna sandwich - it was just ok. Great beer - awesome bar manager - and a very cool outdoor with live music. Will definitely be back."], ["Clare L.", "I adore the Rathskeller. Not only does the building its housed in have amazing architecture and history, but also the atmosphere cannot be beaten.I love hanging out outside in the Biergarten during the summer. It's PACKED on weekends! Sitting inside during the winter is cozy too. They have an amazing selection of both German and European beers and the food, especially the appetizers, is top notch. Be wary of the spicy mustard they serve with the pretzels. Can you say spicy?"], ["Samantha O.", "Excellent German food and beer. Lots of events in the Biergarten especially Oktoberfest. Good casual atmosphere in the bar area, but very nice formal dining in the actual restaurant."], ["Scott N.", "Man, The Rathskeller is a fun place to go to! Living in Indianapolis, it is hard not to hear about the Rathskeller when talking about good places to hangout, have dinner, and/or grab a beer downtown. I can now safely say that it was not overhyped.I haven't been in the restaurant, and I haven't been to the (reportedly) amazing biergarten. I will therefore constrain my review to the bar, which is glorious. I have often wondered what it was like to be a minor lord in renaissance Germany, but now I just imagine my time at The Rathskeller instead. A large portion of the bar is actually a long stone great hall with heraldic banners lining the ceiling and taxidermy animals on the walls. I had the luck to sit on the stage at the end of the hall, making it seem even more like I was presiding over peasant petitioners as a drank my 32 oz beer.Let's talk about the beer; It's good. There is something for all beer drinkers there (assuming you're a fan of German imports). I highly recommend trying them all, just on multiple visits.The food is all good. I can't speak to their German authenticity, but my American palate enjoyed it all the same. I stuck to the bar menu, where all of the sandwiches looked amazing. I had the Frikadelle (a german hamburger on kaiser roll) and it was great. It tasted a lot like a bratwurst in hamburger form and that was absolutely what I wanted. My potato cakes sounded better than they actually were; they ended up being soggy and bland.I will be back and I will recommend it to everyone who come into town to visit us."], ["Jessica G.", "I would listen closely if you're planning on visiting for Devour Downtown. Let me set the mood for you. Today was one of the longest days of my life. Ever. \u00a0But I had something wonderful to look forward to this evening, which was a dinner date with my wonderful husband at what I thought to be an authentic German gem of Indianapolis. We showed up fifteen minutes early, our bodies ready for the three course Devour Downtown menu that was just moments away. The hostess informed us that three quarters of the establishment were to be blocked off to the public this evening, though the pink stage lights and DJ soundcheck feedback in their main event space left little to the imagination. \"It'll be fine,\" my husband says. \"I haven't been here since high school, let's just have a nice dinner.\" \"Yeah, it'll be fine,\" I say. Then enters the waitress. We came prepared with menu choices in mind, and upon our water glass greeting we placed our order with the waitress. Within five minutes another staff member presented us with our appetizers, Brat and Kraut Balls. The spicy mustard and creamy beer dipping sauces are definitely delicious crutches in this dry and meaty equation. It took longer for the waitress to acknowledge our existence than it did for our appetizers to arrive. Right about now I don't know whether to be concerned or extremely impressed. Next, the entrees. Again, five minutes after the Balls rolled up to our table, aforementioned staff member rounded the corner dawning two schnitzels and some sides. I ended up taking half of mine home for the dog. On the walk to the car I decided even my dog wouldn't like it and tossed it into a garbage can. The decor of this place is amazing, but when you close your eyes to take a bite of your room temperature schnitzel, all you'll be seeing is a jerky dog treat smothered in mushrooms and regret. Top the evening off with a cheesecake that looks and tastes almost as appetizing as Kroger's take out and you've got yourself a long night of worshipping the porcelain throne, which is where I've been for the last hour and a half. I paid $75 to have someone defile two pieces of perfectly good pork and then cover it with unpleasant lunch lady squirt bottle sour cream frescos.  I can still vouch for the quality of beer though I didn't even order one. We were lucky enough to be seated next to a bar servicing the dining area; I would like to take a moment to recommend only sitting next to this bar if you bring the proper equipment: poncho, rainboots, and umbrella. As a Hoosier and a young person who has lived in Germany, graduated with a minor in German, and considers herself somewhat of an amateur foodie, I'm hugging my dirndl tonight and praying for forgiveness. I'm sorry pig who died for me.I'm sorry husband.I'm sorry toilet."], ["Anthony J.", "The portions are great.The music is \u00a0a room away. and the Classic feel is keyTop place to go for a visit. Fresh German food a breath away. Filling that desire right away. Place still has some of the old bars and wooden interior. They do utilize different rooms but all have that classic feel. Beer choices... Are rivaling that of a supplier. When they say it's a top place to go see they do truly mean it. Oh and a bar garden. Who can say no to that."], ["Andy G.", "Well, this place is fantastic! I first have to comment on the overall ambiance--it's a wonderful place to go and just enjoy the decor. Once you step inside, you will forget about everything that's going on in the outside world for at least an hour. You'll feel like you are on a German vacation. The Rathskeller took our large party without hesitation and were very nice to us the entire evening. I wish I could remember our server's name--but she was a real firecracker and friendly/helpful all night.The food and drinks were incredible. I don't get to have German food very often, so it's a real treat just to get it. On top of that, it was deliciously prepared. You will want to stuff yourself silly. Try to get lots of different types of dishes at your table so you can try as much as possible. The beer selection is really great as well. As with some other major German establishments in the midwest, they have an immense selection of German bears, almost none of which you will ever have heard of unless you are a real aficionado. Ask for recommendations--the servers are great!"], ["Nina G.", "I came to Rathskellers with great expectations. I've been told it's a great restaurant, but I was disappointed. The atmosphere was reminiscent of an old traditional cellar bar (Keller = cellar) in Germany. Knick knacks on the walls and stained glass windows in the ballroom. \u00a0We sat in the bar part of the restaurant, the other part was more formal with tablecloths and fancy decor. Although, I think the menu was the same. There were moose heads on the wall looking down on you, which was kinda fun. The beer selection was pretty extensive. From domestic beers yo German imports. Drafts and bottled beers were available. But the food was just not up to par. My bf had a spinach salad, which was actually quite tasty. I had a J\u00e4ger Schnitzel with Sp\u00e4tzle and red cabbage. The schnitzel had maybe 3 mushrooms on top, the sauce was thick and gooey and they had drizzled sour cream all over it. (Not traditional at all). The red cabbage was bland, had no tangy flavor and the Spatzle were thick and overly yellow. (Food coloring over load). Over all: go there to drink, not eat!!"], ["Anthony C.", "We had dinner here on a Friday night recently while staying in downtown Indy for the night. The wife and I are big fans of Teutonic food and drink so we have been wanting to try the Rathskeller for quite awhile.5 stars for the historic 19th century building and the history that has played out within these walls. The place has been preserved extremely well and it's truly a landmark. We sat on the enclosed porch between the dining room and outside biergarden and the atmosphere was wonderful. The only complaint was that a concert was going on outside and the music was also playing inside so we had to listen to both which was a little weird.4 stars for service and the beer selection on tap. It was very good but it didn't blow me away. The beer was served in either pint glasses or liter steins so my Warsteiner pilsner did not come in the proper glass (see other reviews for my strange aversion regarding glassware).Our waiter was friendly and attentive throughout the night.3 stars for the food because nothing was outstanding. We started with an order of the Brat n' Kraut balls which were good but nothing special - and a bowl of the oshsenshwanz (ox tail) soup which was very tasty. My wife had the Jaegerschnitzel and I had the Hot Wurtz Plate appetizer. Both were fine but nothing that was memorable. Also the prices seemed a little on the high side for all the entrees.However, we had a great time and would definitely visit again if we're in the area."], ["Olive D.", "The Biergarten is by far the best time in Indy in the summer! The picnic tables, huge beers, and wonderful music is the perfect combination I need for summer. The food at the Rathskeller is amazing and really addicting. I will keep coming back weekend after weekend."], ["Jessica O.", "I am a pretty picky eater so take this with a grain of salt! But my oh my their potato salad was full of flavor and simply is the best! It was lightly sour yet subtly sweet ... Very addicting, I wish I ordered more of it! They have nice and warm bread too. Can't go wrong with their red cabbage and sauerkraut either :) can't give too much advice on main entree but the shrimp scampi looked good - the copious butter deterred me though since I'm on a bridesmaid diet. The steak was huge. Giant portions!!! Good space and atmosphere either casual or can play it up nicely. Right off Mass Ave so good location. Parking: street and machine operated but if you guys have the parkmobile app it's so much more convenient. I do not work for park mobile."], ["Shelby J.", "I came to the Rathskeller for a meet and greet event for PASA. Great space! Large, and the outdoor biergarten area is beautiful. I ended up ordering dinner, from the Kellerbar area of the Rathskeller (which is like the inside bar in the back, not the dining room). I got the Frikadelle, which they liken to a German hamburger. It was a mixture of beef, pork and German wurst in a patty on a kaiser roll with the trimmings. It was great! For my side, I picked the potato pancake... because, yum. Though I was really tempted to get some spaetzle noodles on the side, because I love me some spaetzle. So, long story short? SO good! And a great place for mingling."], ["Cary C.", "This is the cats meow. Excellent service. Your glass is never empty. Very personable waitress. Attentive staff. The best all around.

The pretzel and roll basket kicked off the meal with a shock to our senses - the mustard is delightfully HOT! \u00a0I also really liked the Hofbrau Hefeweizen for my beer. The beer was served with both the bottles and pint glasses, and we had fun comparing labels.The entree tasted fine, but it ultimately was not very memorable. For my entree, I chose a schnitzel with a potato pancake and creamed spinach as sides. A slightly less spicy less version of the mustard was available for the schnitzel, but I stuck with the nasal opening one! The boyfriend felt the same way about his steak - good, but not fantastic.I don't think I will spend money again on the full menu, but I can't wait for the beer and pretzel happy hours this summer!

This is NOT how Americans do potato salad so don't freak out over the lack of eggs and mayo. Beer selection was all right. Expected a bit more for an imported German selection. The atmosphere was very charming, easily one of the best I've experienced. Server was a nice guy and very helpful when offering suggestions as it was my party's first time visiting. The food all-around was great, confirmed by my boyfriend who has stayed in Germany for a year. Especially with the sauerkraut, an item that he normally hates, but this place made it great.The major downside is price. This place is EXPENSIVE (20-25 per entree). I would say it's worth it, but DEFINITELY something to consider before going.

The pork cutlet was thick without an ounce of fat. \u00a0The breading was heavy (in a good way) and stayed crunchy even under the thick sauce. \u00a0The sauce itself was laden with big meaty slices of mushroom. \u00a0It really was heavenly. \u00a0The rest was meh. \u00a0My father had the German potato salad, which he said was too sour. \u00a0Funny enough, I had the sauerkraut and though it was not sour enough. \u00a0I also had the spatzel noodles, which were heavy and gummy and flavorless. \u00a0Dad also had a Reuben, which didn't look great.

We decided to get just appetizers and try each others. We got the Hot Wurst Platte, Chicken Cordon Bleu Fingers and the Spinach Artichoke Dip. This was so much food that we ended up taking two boxes of food home, though we did get desserts; I got the Snicker's Ice Cream Pie and my roommate got the Black Forest Cake. When we got to the restaurant there was not many people here, this could be because we arrived at 4:30pm for an early dinner. We were served pretty quickly, our food came out pretty quickly. The service was very good to beginning with, then after more people arrived the service was a little slower, though this is expected. We love, loved the food here, the appetizers were bigger than expected which is awesome! The more food I get to bring home and snack on later. Our favorite was definitely the Chicken Cordon Bleu Fingers, they were heavenly and perfectly made and cooked. We got a large amount of Spinach Artichoke Dip, which surprised us though we were very happy with it.

I had the baked brie and the Sex with a Sailor cocktail.However, our server Anna was a complete scatterbrain. We were a party of close to 10 (with all of us showing up at various intervals). As more of us arrived, we tried to see if there was a way to switch to the round table right next to our long 6-seater that seated maybe 8 to 10 people. Anna said that it was another server's table and that she couldn't serve us if we were seated there. Why is that such an issue? Just tell your coworker that you're taking over that table until we leave. Anyway, another large group in her section left and she cleared that table for us. What happened when we finished was sort of my fault, but how she reacted (or in her case, didn't react) really left me not liking this place as much as I should have. I gave her my card and signed, only to find that she had charged me for two drinks-- I had only had one. I tried to flag her down to get her attention and ask her if there was any way that I could have the check redone because I was such a damn numnut. You can't blame me for trying anyway.

My wife's Rouladen wasn't what she expected either. Beef, bacon, and onions all sounded great, but chewy sliced beef, and hot mustard inside didn't compliment a thing. Long story short, it's an average German restaurant. Fairly authentic decor and menu, but the kitchen definitely has some work to do. If in Chicagoland, try the Bavarian Lodge...P.S.

But i got my usual hand breaded Pork Tenderloin and it was more than double the size of what it was and when i asked the server she said they started making them a lot bigger. it is huge and for $9.49 that is just unbelievable. there are a lot of places in town that say they have the best pork tenderloin but i am telling you that Union Jack's hands down has the best one. Again i am not sure if they got a new cook or what but the one that I got Saturday night was huge and lots of flavor and you could taste the garlic which i loved.

Nacho Pie is setup like old school nachos where each triangle piece is covered like a pizza which is very good. Nachos were missing black bean salsa like described in menu and had some brown beans thrown on. Nachos were still good. Fish and chips had a crispier breadcrumb coating and wasn't as greasy and thick battered like most places. This was a little unique and pretty good. Coleslaw was good. Waitress told us pub chips weren't like chips and had a little thickness to them. They were chips so we asked for some fries instead. Fries were pretty lame and also took waitress forever to bring any thing she forgot first round. I think she was a little overwhelmed with a small rush of business no biggie. Another waitress stepped in to help out and apologized for the wait when we left. The pizza that takes 40 minutes has some pretty pungent sauce and pretty basic ingredients. Not sure why it coast $18.00 or takes 40 minutes to cook considering the extremely bready crust was still a little doughy. The bottom crust is soggy. I recommend south side chicago downtown fountain square or just some good ole Noble Romans deep dish if you want some thick pizza.

Here's why:I was very impressed with the wine selection and our waiter was extremely knowledgeable when it came to talking about the wines available. They were out of the rose I wanted but he was quick to bring me a sample of a substitute. The only thing that disappointed me about that was the price point on the substitute. I'll admit it - I like cheap wine. I hesitate to pay $11 for a glass of wine out when I could get 2 bottles of a cheap wine at the grocery store for the same price. I know, I know, it's all about the experience.... I ended up going with a glass of Pinot Grigio. It looks like $7 a glass is the lowest price point on wine that I could find on the menu. Something to keep in mind for those who are like myself and like cheap wine.The food - I struggled to find any sort of consistency on the menu. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing, but it seemed like a lot of random dishes thrown together on a piece of paper with an attempt at being trendy. We got the deviled eggs and 4 Cheese Shrimp BBQ flatbread to share. The deviled eggs were AMAZING - the BLT theme was a unique twist I've not seen before. I was iffy on the flatbread - the BBQ was sweeter rather than tangier, and it almost tasted syrupy. Too sweet for my taste but not an overall bad dish. I freaked out a little when I saw the Emily's Apple Harvest salad because it had goat cheese, apples, cranberries, candied nuts, among other things that I love on salads. The salad was delicious and filling. I will definitely be back to Louie's - the atmosphere was great and there are more things on the menu that intrigue me - crab poutine, shrimp & peach salad, pork gnocchi, and shrimp diablo among others.

Sunday's though are a different story.. Totally packed from what I've heard. Breakfast started with a carafe of cranberry mimosas. Heavy on the cranberry and light on the bubbles, this probably wasn't my best mimosa I've had, but certainly not the worst. I'm a huge Eggs Benedict fan, and it was a tough decision to go with the classic (with ham), the harvest (roasted veggies) or the Crab Cake (with crab cakes). I decided to go the traditional route with the classic, which was served with a side of breakfast potatoes. Being one of the only ones in the restaurant, my food came out lickety split. My first thought was that my portion side was too small.. Then I realized that it was huge, but the plates were bigger than they appeared. There's a lot of food on the plate, and I was stuffed after finished half of my brunch. The eggs were great.. Perfectly poached, and the sauce has just the right amount of acidity.

The flights are a great concept too, as I'm always wanting to sample bits of things before committing to anything. All in all, an innovative, appealing addition to the Mass Ave scene."], ["Carrie B.", "One word, amazing! I asked the chef if he could make something vegan & he did not disappoint! He had me at coconut cream base! He made a veggie flatbread with other fresh veggies. It was unbelievably delicious! We also had a few mimosa carafes which were great as well!"], ["Danielle W.", "Let me start off by saying, I've only had the brunch here but I plan to go back VERY SOON for the dinner. The first time I went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon, I had the Breakfast Flatbread A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. I would totally recommend it again and their mimosas are very affordable. The second time I went for a Yelp Elite Brunch and we got to taste so many delectable foods/drinks! I was dying to try their Biscuits and Gravy and I can confirm you are MISSING OUT if you don't get them. Additionally, I had the Mac Daddy Omelette (could have used more seasoning), corned pork hash (highly recommend), Drunken French Toast, and the White Chocolate Bread Pudding. I usually am not a fan of French Toast or Bread Pudding, but MAN it was good! The drinks-Breakfast Sangria- It was pretty good but I would prefer a mimosaLouie Latte-HOLY TASTEBUDS- I LOVE THIS DRINK! Recommendations- Adding chocolate drizzle on top with a cookie straw and you have a wonderful desert. Friendly and welcoming staff. The environment and d\u00e9cor of this place fits very well on Mass Ave. I would recommend you check out this new establishment!"], ["Casey C.", "My boyfriend and I had a reservation through Open Table at Louie's for a celebration dinner on a Saturday night. The food was ok-to-good, not the best we've ever had. My blackened salmon salad was good but it didn't really stand out and my boyfriend's fish and chips had very heavy breading on the fish. But the wine was excellent, I got a Pinot Grigio and my boyfriend got a Malbec. Our server was very knowledgable about the menu and offered good tips and quick service. It does have a different ambiance than I was expecting: it's fairly lit up and there are actually two TVs in the bar. I didn't mind it, it was just unexpected for a wine bar. It seemed to be one of those in-between restaurants where you basically can make it more casual or fancy based on your preference.I think I would be willing to try it again, especially with a group of friends!"], ["Mary T.", "After months of passing by Louie's as I habitually make my way across the street to Bakersfield reminding myself that I need to check it out, I finally did! To my surprise we were offered a table on a Saturday night without a wait but not for their lack of business but in part due to their large space with ample seating without feeling tightly packed or tables in such close proximity that you can clearly follow along with your neighbors conversation. We ended up sitting at the bar for a more casual feel and immediately were greeted by Zak, one of the bartenders who happens to know his wines, are you surprised? Not knowing what goodies I wanted to try on the menu, I asked for a red wine of his choosing and had the Chapoutier Ciboise Syrah - a French Syrah that had a bold full body flavor that only comes from French wines. It was such a smooth wine that I had a second glass! As far as the food goes - I highly recommend the brussel sprouts in a red wine reduction with a subtle hint of sweetness that are a perfect fall food. I also tried the quinoa salad with a strawberry vinaigrette that made me realize quinoa with spinach is not only a super food combination but also when prepared correctly will make you sad that you finished your greens. Don't be embarrassed to order a second salad at $5, why not? Overall I must say I am impressed with the wine selection and the staff who knows how to accommodate guests with refined American cuisine that is relatable and suitable for all palates alike! p.s. rumor has it that the white chocolate brioche bread pudding will make you do a happy dance"], ["Drew T.", "I love this place. The Windee appetizers and the atmosphere I would recommend it to anyone."], ["Ashley P.", "Absolutely adorned this new spot on Mass Ave! Met some girl friends for dinner. I had a glass of the Malbec but was so tempted to try many more on the menu. A \"dive\" is not at all what this place is. We started with the cheese plate and the squeaky cheese. I would have preferred the squeaky cheese warmed but they were both delicious. A+ homemade horseradish sauce on the cheese plate. I had the shrimp Diablo for for main dish. It was absolutely delicious. Just the right amount of spice. And the perfect amount to have some to take home for lunch the next day! We finished the meal with the chocolate torte. It was extremely rich. I recommend splitting this. And a glass of ros\u00e9! Overall quality experience here. Will be returning with more friends in the future!"], ["Matthew P.", "I expected a lot more out of this place based on the reviews and the location. \u00a0My girl and I ordered two glasses of wine and an appetizer. \u00a0The wine selection was nothing to write home about and was overpriced. \u00a0The appetizer was overly salty and overpriced. \u00a0Come to find out, Louie's is a chain as well. \u00a0Skip this place and support local when your on Mass Ave."], ["Tonya S.", "What's not to love about this fun new place on Mass Ave?! \u00a0I have visited a few times since Louie's opened and here are a few things I loved: \u00a0The daily drink specialsThe sangriaThe service They will open any bottle of wine for you as long as you commit to 2 glassesThe variety of bloody mary optionsThe interiorThe brunch menu - loved the crab cake eggs benedict, side potatoes and SB&G - delish! \u00a0(only complaint here was not enough gravy for the generous portion of biscuits)I highly recommend checking this place out. \u00a0They are advertising a happy hour menu on Monday evenings, but each time I have visited on a Monday, they have said it isn't available yet. \u00a0Can't wait until it is!"], ["Dylan E.", "I've only made it in here for a couple of visits, but I have been disappointed each time. I'll start off by putting out the disclaimer that I have not actually made it in here just on a random night out to get some dinner or drinks, so maybe that's their bread and butter, but what I have made it here for I will not try again.The first time I was here was for a wine tasting event, which you bought a ticket for and then got to sample a variety of different wines from a number of different distributors. The event was fun, and we got to try some good wines and have some of their great food, but it was insanely unorganized. I think it was the first one they had, so it might operate a lot more smoothly now, but it's kept me from even thinking about trying it again. The number of wines that we were supposed to get to try varied wildly from week to week for the month or so leading up to it. The ticket process was a mess, and seemed extremely redundant and unnecessary. Nobody from the hostess to the distributors knew what anybody was supposed to be doing, and they were still getting it setup at the time that they said it would be starting. There was also not really anywhere for us to sit, and no tables to set our glasses down on in the area where this event was. When we eventually went to their seating area they asked us to move so they could seat other customers. Again, I think this was the first time they did this so maybe take it with a grain of salt, but they lost my confidence.I also recently made it in here for brunch, and was once again disappointed. Our server was not very good, but I always forgive that as long as it isn't a trend. They can't control it if one person happens to be having a bad day, and I haven't been here enough to know if it is consistently like that. The brunch menu wasn't very big, which is fine, but it also wasn't very interesting at all. For the $9-$10 price range that most things seemed to be at, I would much rather go to a large number of the other brunch places around Indy that offer a much more inventive selection for the same price. The music that they had playing was all classic rock, which seemed odd for a Sunday morning brunch but that may just be their thing.They were supposed to open for brunch at 9, and when we got there at a little after 10:30 the waitress said she wasn't sure if their quiche of the day was actually ready yet. I ended up going with the biscuits and gravy and it was not good. The biscuits were good, but the gravy tasted like they used ground beef instead of sausage. It tasted much more like a stroganoff than what I am used to for biscuits and gravy. The person I was eating with ordered their \"Blue Plate\" which is a typical breakfast platter that comes with eggs, potatoes, bacon, and a choice of a biscuit or toast. She is a vegetarian and the waitress said that she was not allowed to substitute anything else for the bacon, saying that she could only substitute \"a protein for a protein, a starch for a starch, etc\" which is really dumb. All she wanted was a little extra of something else, and since every single one of those items is listed as $3 on the a la carte part of their menu, they ought to be interchangeable. It was also surprising that their breakfast potatoes are deep fried and tasted like french fries rather than typical breakfast potatoes.I will still eventually make it in here for just a normal night of dinner and drinking, but until then, they are 0 for 2 in my book."], ["Kavitha D.", "I've been here for brunch and dinner, and both were good meals:BRUNCH= I ordered the crab cake benedict which came with a side of potatoes (although the menu didn't say it did). I did think the dish needed a little kick to it (a little bland for my taste), but still yummy! My friend ordered the breakfast burger. On the menu it clearly says it comes with fries, however when they brought him his meal it came with a biscuit and gravy.If you're menu says it should/shouldn't come with something, please follow it. And when we asked the waitress why it didn't come with fries, she simply stated we were wrong and it doesn't come with that. We didn't bother making a fuss out of something so small, but just something to improve on.--------------------------------------------------------DINNER= I ordered the malbec flight (all from Mendoza, Argentina!) and then a glass of a red blend. All were delicious! And the waiter was very knowledgeable, which is always a plus.Had the salmon chutney as my meal. It was ok. I think it has potential, but there are way too many flavors in this one dish and I think some of them clash. However, just my opinion, and still was a yummy dish! My friend ordered the mass ave meltdown and he was in pure heaven! Totally recommend this place!! Can't wait to visit again :)Also this place is decorated straight out of pinterest, love it haha!"], ["Holly H.", "Yes to Louie's. This place is amazing. I love the wine options - there are so many! If you can't decide, you can also do a flight, which is a great way to work your way through the wine list. The food is excellent and goes with what you would expect from a wine place. And, if you're not in the mood for wine, their cocktail list is insane as well. So glad Louie's came to Mass Ave!"], ["Molly S.", "We started with the wine (obviously). There are wines for every taste and budget. For those who can't decide, Louie's offers flights of Malbec or Sauvignon Blanc- three small pours for $10. This was a nice option, though I wish they allowed for mix and match of wine styles, rather than three of the same types of wine. If you're dining with the wine-averse, fear not. Louie's offers a rotation of local brews, as well as a cocktail menu and some rather delicious sangria, both red and white.The real winner of Louie's in my opinion is dessert. They say life is short, so eat dessert first, and I'd actually say just skip dinner altogether and just order wine and the divine white chocolate bread pudding. Four people easily shared a HUGE piece of bread pudding that came out with bourbon creme anglaise. At first bite, more than a few expletives were dropped at the table. It was just SO. GOOD. Creamy, flavorful, sweet but not overwhelmingly so...just go order some...you'll get it."], ["Erin S.", "I must've walked by Louie's Wine Dive 20+ times since I moved to Indy and always assumed it was just a wine bar (nothing wrong with that) with a cute wine glass strung lights in the window... BOY was I mistaken!!!

Daniel was great, informative about our wine, food choices, and asked if there were any food allergies without us having to bring it up!Food: I ordered the 4 Pork Gnocchi and it is to DIE FOR, very filling!!! If I could eat that for the rest of my life, I would. Ryan ordered the Coconut Street Noodle with added shrimp and he ate every last bit of food on his plate. I was able to steal a bite without losing a limb & it was scrumptious!Cost: For the quality of food I definitely would have expected the prices to be higher and was grateful how reasonable they were. I will definitely be returning next time with a reservation, can't wait to go back!!!"], ["Sam C.", "This was a 5 star experience. The food is to die for and all at a reasonable price. All of the ingredients are fresh and delicious. We ate the pork gnocchi and the fish and chips. Both dishes were spectacular! We also ordered a side of the roasted brussel sprouts and the loaded potatoes. A definite must! I especially liked the homemade coleslaw with the fish and chips. We will definitely be back and will have to try the brunch next time! Thanks for a wonderful dining experience."], ["Danny K.", "We met friends here on a whim. We arrived 30 minutes early and they kindly sat us anyway. It is a somewhat busy atmosphere with that trendy modern theme. The 4 pork gnocchi was amazing. Someone else at our table had the crabcakes. They looked very ample as a meal. It is a loud atmosphere, but we could easily hear each other across the table. This Mass Avenue destination is above average in all ways."], ["Valerie B.", "Our waiter really knew the menu- both food and bar. The charcuterie board was perfect and the deviled eggs were good. The shrimp diavolo looked boring but tasted amazing! The huge double pork chop was perfectly cooked and topped with awesome caramelized onions. The corn cakes served with it were nothing special and over browned. The fish sandwich, touted by so many reviewers was good but not spectacular. Wine list is extensive and in my opinion very pricey. Lots of cordials- a gem of a place!"], ["Kelsey A.", "Loved the appetizers and half priced bottles when we stopped in on a handlebar tour. Will surely be back with more time to explore the full menu and wine list. Super friendly staff!"], ["Jenna L.", "This place is top notch! Stepped in on a busy evening and was amazed by the level of service, the prices, the offerings, and how delicious everything was.My husband and I started with the hummus plate- which may sound bland (let's be honest usually hummus sucks!), but this was delicious, they make it in-house and soak the beans etc. Very yummy. Then we ordered a bottle of the Four Graces Pinot Noir - top notch and a reasonable price for such a yummy bottle of vino. Then I ordered the burger and my husband had the steak. We loved everything! And cleaned our plates. We then finished with their take on tiramisu. I cannot wait to go back and try the deviled eggs and the other offerings... everything looked really yummy and their non-pretentious wine style was awesome. The decor is on point and fits right in to Mass Ave. I'm going to have to call this my new fav place."], ["Robyn B.", "So excited to see this place open! \u00a0A city with many beer places needs a place with a wine focus like this. \u00a0(Not to worry beer & cocktail enthusiasts, they have respectable selections in these areas as well!)My 4 stars is for drinks and service ...

I thought it had a very nice atmosphere - sort of hip chic (not hipster, just hip). Nice spacious place - I think you could easily bring a group of 20 or more here on a given day. The service was friendly and knowledgeable about the wine. I had a wonderful glass of Mountain Cuvee from Sonoma, CA that was recommended by the bartender. I ordered the pesto chicken flatbread, which was good but nothing special. I'll come back, but mostly for the nice loungy atmosphere and great wine selection."], ["Jessie S.", "There's already a fancy wine bar on Mass Ave., so I was confused why another was going in. Riddle solved - it's not a snooty wine bar! This place serves fresh, hand-crafted cocktails, craft beer and of course, wine. We tried three of their cocktails and loved them - fresh mint, house-infused liquors and no syrups or fake flavors. So fresh and light.The prices were really reasonable, and in fact cheaper than many area competitors ($8 for nice cocktail). The space is open, rustic chic with plenty of tables. It had just opened when we went, so bartenders were still learning the menu, but I can only assume this place will get even better!"], ["Kristy K.", "We stopped into Louie's on their opening weekend for a glass of vino and to check out the place.First, it wasn't that busy, which we great, we got a table right away and the service was spot on for our entire visit.We each had a glass from the chalkboard (that's their thing -- they put bottles that they are service by the glass that day on the chalk board, in addition to a large menu of vino by the glass or bottle. \u00a0Also, if you commit to 2 glasses, they'll pour anything...which means you get to try a glass of interesting wine that wouldn't normally be available outside of a bottle purchase).The menu is interesting, with salads, sammies, some pasta entrees and more. We settled on the deviled eggs and lobster poutine. \u00a0We didn't have time for a full meal, but those apps were great! \u00a0The lobster poutine has a thin seafood gravy -- I might ask for that on the side next time as it seemed to make my fries a bit soggy. \u00a0Otherwise, it was a good sized portion and very tasty.The interior is exposed brick and edison bulbs, so nothing out of the ordinary -- there are some booths, but mostly tables.We will definitely be back to drink more vino!"], ["Christin J.", "Update: I just had to update this review and remove a star. I went in with my husband and we got two entrees: steak and a pork chop. The chop was SO salty I couldn't even eat it and the steak was ok but definitely not cooked medium rare like we ordered. Disappointed, but will stick to sandwiches from now on.This may be one of my favorite new places! I've had two dinners here, the mass ave meltdown and the salmon salad with a humus plate to start. Both meals were so delicious! The meltdown is an eat-with -a-fork cod sandwich on naan bread and it's really decadent. The quinoa salad is an amazing side! With arugula and strawberries it was far more interesting than I imagined, made me glad I resisted the fries. The salmon salad is nice and pretty big for the price point. We'll cooked, nice and spicy, with a greens base. I've been impressed with the staff. While I can tell some of them are still learning, they really do their best to help you learn about the different wines and were so helpful when I brought in my brother (new to the wine scene), recommending things, bringing samples etc. We've already tried some really great wines here.

It's opening weekend, so obviously there are going to be issues. That's understandable.I loved my drinks. I had a Spanish wine (Can't remember the name, let's assume the cheapest one.) and it was incredible. Someone in my party had a pinot noir that was equally impressive.I also had a old fashioned. Cocktails all looked great and had a surprisingly low price tag. We wanted to try the deviled eggs, but they were out. Instead we had the hummus which was tasty, but not really shareable. For an appetizer that seemed strange. I would say that the food needs some work. I had the Mass Ave Meltdown, but it wasn't as full (or melty) as I expected. The \"crispy fries\" weren't crispy. They were pretty soggy. That was disappointing. Our party also had the Gooey Louie and we decided it was pretty bland and not particularly exciting or memorable.Like I said, immediate and major issues were resolved by management.

Both times was waiting at least an hour from ordering main dish, plus like 20 min wait for drinks and 45 mins for apps 45 mins for dessert. Had to put more money in meter.

I am not a wine connoisseur but there seemed to be plenty of options to choose from. They didn't have the ros\u00e9 my friend ordered so they gave her a more expensive glass but charged her the original price, which I thought was courteous.We had the hummus appetizer to start out with, it was delicious! They put some pesto on top of the hummus and provide not only pita and bread but vegetables as well. I would definitely recommend this appetizer. I had the gooey louie burger with apples and brie cheese and a side of quinoa. Unfortunately they gave me salad instead of quinoa (I was having two glasses of wine, salad was not going to save me at this point). But I didn't say anything because I was hungry and figured it was the gods telling me to be healthier...so I really can't fault them much for it. My friend had the salmon which she enjoyed as well. There are plenty of other dishes that I would love to try, especially some of the pastas.Overall the service was decent and the food was good. It would be a fun place to go before a night out on mass ave."], ["Bill J.", "I liked the old menu better than the current one, but the new one is still pretty damn good. \u00a0Lots of food and wine choices, relaxed atmosphere in the heart of Mass \u00a0Ave and the service has been consistently good.Looking forward to returning here again."], ["Elaine S.", "Love this place. Went here on a date and food was amazing, as I got the \"Hen over Brick\" but went back recently and they took it off the menu which was upsetting. I tried the new Tuscan chicken dish and wasn't impressed at all, also Got a cheese bout which i thought was just ok. But had great service every time and wine selection was great! Definitely recommend and like how the menu keeps changing!"], ["Julia C.", "Amazing food, beer, and bourbon! \u00a0The 1792 is outta this world! Not your typical wine bar. Great staff and atmosphere.

My 3 friends & I decided to try this new spot last Friday night since our friend lives above it. Incredible. We all felt that it was one of the best meals of our lives. Our server was so sweet - and I've totally forgotten his name. Shame on me. Shawn maybe? Sweet. The pasta dishes were heavenly. The wine incredible. I didn't partake in the dessert but my friends said it was awesome. Can't wait to come back to Indy to eat here again!"], ["Laura L.", "The wine was good, the food was a big disappointment. We wanted to try appetizers, but they never arrived. So many better places to go on Mass Ave."], ["Jamie Y.", "We sat at the bar on a Friday night and thoroughly enjoyed the wine and appetizers. Great environment!"], ["Hannah L.", "I just visited Louie's for the first time yesterday for brunch and I already cannot wait to venture back for dinner. I started out with a traditional Bloody Mary which was served with a pickle and an olive. It was very enjoyable, a bit spicy, but that's the best kind in my opinion! I ordered a breakfast pizza. So. Good. Eggs, veggies, sausage and more all on a flatbread gave me everything I wanted. My mother ordered the biscuits and gravy which was also amazing. Looks a bit different from traditional gravy but it definitely hit the spot and is of good size. My boyfriend ordered an omelette, which was delectably creamy. His Cranberry Mimosa was also very tasty, if that's the sort of thing that you're into. The atmosphere was also very pleasing. Modern yet rustic vibes inside with exposed brick and wire with thoughtfully placed unique lighting. The service was great and everyone in the restaurant seemed to have high spirits. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a relaxed brunch spot with many options to choose from!"], ["Stephanie G.", "I went to Louie's for the first time tonight and had an excellent experience.The service was outstanding - my friend had an unfortunate interaction with a rude customer at the table next to us, and our waitress Maggie and the manager Ed handled it professionally and immediately. Not only that, the staff at Louie's did a great job of making sure we still enjoyed our time and recommended several delicious wines, all of which were reasonably priced. We had the hummus platter as an appetizer, and the Louie Gooey burger and 4 Pork Gnocchi for entrees. Both were well-prepared and flavorful - we especially loved the hummus & rich 4 Pork Gnocchi. I highly recommend Louie's on Mass Ave, especially for the wine selection and friendly staff. I will definitely return!"], ["Rene F.", "We came here for a wine tasting, the Dive's first, and we loved it. \u00a0I hope this is something they do continue. \u00a0The atmosphere is relaxing and chic. \u00a0This night the samples were brought in from Napa Valley by Dean WIlson. \u00a0Louie's prepared some small bites to accompany the wine tasting and it was all fantastic. \u00a0We had already decided to stay for dinner after the tasting. \u00a0My friend had been here before and is a real fan. \u00a0This was my first visit. \u00a0I will be back. \u00a0I had the burger as my meal and it was super tender and juicy. \u00a0We had split the cheese curd appetizer and we both loved the aioloi sauce that was served with the dish. \u00a0Service was wonderful and all the staff was very friendly. \u00a0Louie's is doing brunch on Saturdays and Sundays this summer so I want to come back just for that one morning."], ["R M.", "Meh.The two of us went to a pre-theater dinner, so it was a bit on the early side. \u00a0The wine list is not too overwhelming, however too much is written on a chalk board that is very difficult to see from some tables. \u00a0We are wine novices, so we were excited for an accessible wine experience... Asking for suggestions didn't really get us to any wines that we liked... we ended up drinking beer (we felt like party poopers). \u00a0For a wine-focused restaurant, the servers did not seem that knowledgeable about the wine they were suggesting.The food was very salty, and was not very memorable. (skip the squeaky cheese... you couldn't even tell they were curds, and the sauce was TGI-Fridays style marinara) \u00a0It is still kinda-new, so we may give it another chance... but, there are so many good restaurants out there, Louie's Wine Dive needs to step it up."], ["Michelle K.", "Delicious! Was so impressed and pleasantly surprised. \u00a0I expected typical bar food.... But their menu, and the execution of the dishes was right on. \u00a0For a land locked city, the seafood mac n cheese was especially impressive. The bread pudding was sooo good. \u00a0I wish I could have it nightly! \u00a0The food here was waaay way better than what I had the next night at a fancy-ish restaurant, Oakleys, the next night... and half the price! It's a little loud, but appropriate for the setting.Id definitely return here."], ["Lisa B.", "Love this restaurant! We went on opening night and everything was excellent! \u00a0We ordered the deviled eggs for an appetizer and they are incredible. Not your average deviled eggs. The chef shared with us that it is his mom's recipe. So sweet! \u00a0For dinner we had the Mass Ave. Meltdown, the Tandoori Salmon, and the Bone In Pork Loin Chop. They were all exceptional and so reasonably priced. Our server was named Jessy and she was extremely attentive. Couldn't ask for more. We also had a bottle of the Laguna Ranch Chardonnay which is an excellent buttery wine, and the Malbec wine flight. We settled on the Leo Premium Malbec which was rich, with hints of oak, and spicy. The ambience is casually comfortable. Very nicely decorated and a great place to kick back and enjoy your company."], ["Andrew S.", "Ordered the enormous bone-in tomahawk steak the first time I went. It was delicious and cooked decently. Some parts were uneven, but that's understandable for such an unwieldy piece of meat.We started with the crab cakes were okay, but a little too bland and had a burnt flavor to them. Probably cooked a little too hot.Good selection of wine and a few decent wine specials. Service wasn't as helpful as I would hope, but it might just be because it's a new restaurant.I'll definitely try to return again on a weekend when they have dinner specials.The open dining room makes it get pretty loud. Also, this place is pricey and the quality doesn't quite match."], ["Jen M.", "We came to Louie's Wine Dive for our anniversary and it was a great experience. \u00a0We both ordered the seasonal prix fixe with the wine pairing. \u00a0The standout part of the meal for me was the calimari. \u00a0Seriously. \u00a0The best calimari I have ever had. \u00a0We were thrilled with everything they chose for us and most definitely will be returning!"], ["Angela T.", "This restaurant is still working out the kinks; as it is still new to Mass Ave. The food has always been delicious and I would recommend their brunch menu. When we did have a bad experience with food time all was forgiven because the server took care of our appetizer and we didn't even say anything to her. I would still go back because food, service and atmosphere is usually spoton."], ["Valerie G.", "Great first-time experience here! This is just what Indy needs. The design is great, the cocktails were unique, solid wine and beer selection and the food was fantastic. Had the lobster poutine, calamari, Tiki drink, Grandma's Garden, and the Italian Bootlegger between the two of us. All were excellent. They also have a great beer selection - 2 Flat12 beers to choose from. And they carry my favorite local beer Flat12 Walkabout Pale.Will edit to 5 stars if they can get some Petite Syrahs in and maybe a sparkling Shiraz for the Tandoori Salmon? Can't wait to come back for the Sunday brunch! Menu looks amazing.Great job Louie's!"], ["Amber S.", "I'll split this review into three parts because I like lists: Service, Ambiance, Food/DrinkService: We were told there was a 15-20 minute wait, despite two open tables front and center. In that time, two parties that came in well after we did were seated. When we complained to the hostess, she told us a server had seated her dad out of turn, and the other party being seated was a mistake. She was apologetic, but getting overlooked not once, but twice is unacceptable. Once seated, the server was very sweet but about a B- in attentiveness. Ambiance: The lighting is very cool -- Edison-style and recycled wine bottles. And the use of reclaimed wood is done well. But there seems to be a disconnect between these fixtures and the art/design. The wallpaper, the porch plant hangers (inside)... Just doesn't jive. Food/drink: Good selection of beer, and the infused booze/cocktails are done well and at a solid price point. (I didn't have any wine.) The menu needs work. Not enough veg options that aren't pasta. Speaking of pasta, the ravioli was too chewy. The squeaky cheese tasted like GFS mozzarella sticks. The Mass Ave Meltdown was supposed to be a sandwich but was way too soggy to pick up.Bottom line: I hate to leave negative reviews, but I felt this one was necessary because of the multiple disappointments. Go for after-work drinks at the bar. Skip dinner."], ["Tracy A.", "I've been to Louie's twice now. \u00a0I had dinner on one visit and brunch on another. \u00a0The lyrics to Billy Idol's Rebel Yell just keep coming to my head. \u00a0'With a rebel yell she cried- \"more, more, more\"'. More, more, more. \u00a0On both occasions, the staff was fantastic! \u00a0For dinner, we had an eight top, and Paige was great with us. \u00a0We tried the Prix Fixe menu with the wine pairing. \u00a0It is a great way to try things. \u00a0It started with a cold cucumber pineapple soup, the entree was halibut, and the dessert was a chocolate torte with white chocolate topping. \u00a0The halibut was prepared perfectly, and all was delicious. \u00a0Through the rest of our party, we were able to try the fish and chips, the Cuban, the Sinatra, lobster poutine, calamari, and the lobster and shrimp mac. \u00a0Everyone in our group loved everything. \u00a0The fact that everyone out of eight people loved everything we had is the heart of the review. \u00a0The only reason for the missing 5th star is the noise level of a full house and I would like to see even more signature cocktails that what they already have!"], ["Dan C.", "Solid brunch.

Nothing to call home about, though. Despite it having \"wine\" in the name, they have some decent liquor behind the bar. I ordered an old fashioned off of their cocktail menu. It was somewhat passable. They garnished with sage, which isn't terribly radical, but wasn't very complimentary. The ice the bartender used was chipped/crushed ice and didn't seem appropriate to use in an old fashioned."], ["Pam A.", "My wife and I had date night at Louie's this past Saturday.

And I would have sorely missed out.I love that this place is categorized as a dive bar. The decor, playfully insulting service, and adjacency to a raging highway definitely follow this prescription. But how many dive bars do you know that make their salad dressings in house? That decorate for holidays? That bring out fresh paper placemats with a handsome greek motif which makes you wish you had crayons to make them a masterpiece like the one they served you. My chicken cordon bleu sandwich was obviously crafted with care - cleanly cut and beautifully laid out in it's basket. And the soup!

As a side I had the pasta salad which was pretty standard, no complaintsAtmosphere: The wall is covered from top to bottom with tchotchkes of all types. Very cozy place to be to enjoy a good hot meal & a beer on a cold day. Definitely a dive, but what can I say, it's my kind of dive.Staff: Very friendly, helpful, and rough around the edges with some playful humor.

It's been many years, but the menu has pretty much stayed the same, and I think I've ordered the same thing every time I've come here. The Bourbon Baked Ham Sandwich is simply amazing.

Feel free to accompany your steak with wine, beer, or a cocktail--they've got it all here. Now let's talk about the reason I came here in the first place: PIE. Being that it's Pi Day, I was looking for a place that had pies and was still open after 5. RDG was the only one who fit the bill, and dessert did not disappoint.

My breakdown of the restaurant is as follows:Service: 2/5Food: 2/5Entertainment: 6/5Their food is okay. The first time I came I had a sandwich which was made on grocery store bread and served with Ruffles potato chips. The second time I came I ordered their most popular combo, the T&A. This included 6oz skewered Beef Tenderloin Tips (tender but not really seasoned) and a cup of their Hot Pot Aug (not sure what the hype is about). Everything was a little bland.My drink was never refilled and the waitress questioned what someone in my party ordered and tried to upsell them. They are very nice though, just a little aloof.The entertainment is great though. The main dining area has a piano and David shows up to play at 7:00pm sharp. If it hadn't been for his musical talent I would not have come back here a second time (and realistically I'm sure I'll be back again). He's friendly, approachable and takes requests. He greets his guests as they come and go and engages his audience from time to time (but it's not invasive). He really elevates an otherwise unremarkable restaurant.

The atmosphere is one of those little restaurants with generations of history. The main dining area quickly filled up with regulars at dinner and the staff was terrific. The bar is comfortable for drinks, appetizers or even dinner. We had the pleasure of Sean Baker entertaining us on the piano and several regulars taking center stage throughout the evening. \u00a0When the pianist asked for request I prompted my husband to ask for his all time favorite Charlie Brown music. Most don't take the request seriously or don't know the songs but Sean did. He played several to the pleasure of my husband and the crowd. Perfect birthday treat for him and icing on the cake. The bacon horseradish dip was tasty with the horseradish not overpowering the bacon flavor. Served with a large basket of ripple potato chips and re-heats well for leftovers. My Hot Pot was excellent and I'll be ordering again in the future. One of the dinner specials was a Beef Manhattan with soup and dessert. Again, one of birthday boys favorite being an old fashion meat and potato guy. Plenty of tender beef accompanied by an extra large serving of mashed potatoes.

From the outside, it does not look like much, and even gives the appearance of being in a rough neighborhood (it is near east side, after all, and is a windowless building with a metal security door in front of the entrance door). The inside tells a different story. This is a sit-down restaurant as you enter, and what appears to be a bar area in divided-off section to the left. The atmosphere is cozy and welcoming. It was apparent that most of the other customers were regulars, and I can see why: The staff is great, and they make you feel right at home. They have a piano in the dining area, and live music certain nights. We were lucky we wandered in on one such night, when David Meek (???) was playing piano.They have a somewhat limited menu, and are best known for the hot pot aug (a scalloped potato soup) and the hot pot pig (a potato-cheddar soup with bacon and jalapeno cheese) \u00a0and their various pies made in-house. The entrees are mainly club sandwich or other sandwich-type offerings, though I noticed they also have alfredo and marinara pastas. The entrees come with a side, but for a couple dollars more, you can substitute a cup of the hot pot aug or hot pot pig. . . and it's totally worth it. As far as pies, we've tried the popular coconut pie, and the English toffee pie, and both were made with a whipped frosting that wasn't overly sweet or heavy. They have several other kinds of pies, but availability is limited to whatever they've made and still have on hand."], ["Bill K.", "Killer Reuben, great service from Stefani at super reasonable prices.

Yippee!I came here with a large group on a Saturday night. We called in advance for a reservation, which turned out to be very important because the place was packed.

The gentleman playing piano was fantastic, playing a variety of music and singing occasionally. I'd go back just for him.My personal food choices were DELICIOUS. I got the tips and aug on the recommendation of other reviewers, and it did not disappoint. Curiously, I almost felt like the soup had too much bacon (is that really a thing?), but that can't honestly be a real complaint. The steak was cooked really well and was super tender. The coconut cream pie was pretty tasty. As for the food of my other seven dining companions, some were disappointed and some were really pleased. There were several eventually clean plates that started out with pasta and sandwiches. However, my husband wasn't crazy about his BLT. All the ingredients were there, but none of them were great (think Wonder bread, boring/thin cut bacon, etc.). We also noticed that the potato chips they served were straight out of a bag of Ruffles, so that's kind of a bummer.Our waitress was very friendly and funny, and she did a great job managing such a large group. However, the service was generally slow. She mentioned that they were in the midst of training a new cook, and that things were moving more slowly than usual. I appreciated her explanation. I thought the pricing was fair.I think a more honest review might be a 3.5, but I'm willing to round up for this local joint. It's totally unassuming on the outside (one of our friends actually thought it was a liquor store when he drove up), but just embrace that it's part of the charm.

I was able to chat with David and his sister as I enjoyed my soup. They are so welcoming and treat ya just like family.I cannot wait for my next visit!

Loved the piano playing a huge range of classics and newer songs to accompany a great heart-clogging meal. Shared a few entrees and combinations with a group - all were delicious. As mentioned in every other review the Hot Pot Pig is a must. Also tried the grilled bbq chicken and beef tenderloin skewers. Looking at the menu the prices were a little higher than I expected, then you realize how much food you get with each entree (mine included two sides and dessert). All in all, a great spot to try for anyone that hasn't - I don't think there's any way you'd go for a first time and not come back. Family-owned with a great vibe and service with excellent homestyle food like your mom or grandma made at their best."], ["Amy H.", "This place is phenomenal. Period. The only downside is that it's not close enough to my house so that I could easily become a regular.Dive bar exterior (literally, no windows), local low key neighborhood bar interior. Think a mix of Nascar signs and nick-nacks, a few strategically placed tv's (muted), hand-written specials over the bar and then, a surprisingly nice menu and a piano player! We started with the jalapeno pretzel (awesome!) and then shared the \"pick 2\" option. We had a crab cake and beef tips with the rosemary potatoes. The crab cake was tender, flaky and very well done and the beef tips actually came out perfectly pink in the middle, a feat I have to admit surprised me. We also had 2 dinner salads which were exceptionally well done for \"bar\" food - large, pretty and with more than your standard fare of bagged lettuce and carrot shavings. This was fluffy, fresh greens with red onions, olives, tomatoes, cheese, egg and a side of garlic bread. Already stuffed, we still managed to devour the included dessert, the coconut cream pie. It rivaled my mothers (which is saying A LOT), except without the over the top sweetness that some may associate with CCP. Service was fantastic - attentive, informed and friendly.

Fortunately, my friend chose it for it her birthday rendezvous. As soon as the five of us walked in the door I was thrown back to Randolph County, Indiana (my hometown) - Ralph's couldn't be more comfortable, laid back and decorated like home. As all of the previous reviews composed by brilliant Yelpers noted, I was sure to have the Hot Pot Pig soup (potato on steroids - bacon, loaded cheese). I was hoping for a little more bacon action. But I suppose I'm always hoping for a little bacon action in general. We also shared the horseradish bacon dip (see the bacon theme at work here?) with potato chips. By this point, I was probably hitting 1500 calories+, so I thought - what the hell? and ordered a Sun King Wee Mac. Next time I'll have to try the highly-acclaimed coconut cream pie.Oh! and how could I forget the cherry on the top? The experience was complete with a charming Ben Folds-esque piano player clad in plaid and thick frames. Yep, we were sold."], ["Austin G.", "Ralph's is the best. The food is top notch as i have yet to have a bad meal there and have been there many times. The service is what we go back for.

Until last night (after hearing so many times how great a place it is!). Chips and salsa - The BEST I've ever had. The chips were really warm - I mean so tasty warm and also just the right crispiness. \u00a0This is the first time I think I've ever done a Yelp review that mentions the chips that are served - but this place had the best. Ordered the shrimp entree that included a much larger salad than I expected (along with one other side option) that was very good.

Highly recommended - will become a regular no doubt."], ["Bill B.", "Finally made it to this place. Took my Valentine's date as we tend to prefer this type of place.

For me. Five stars, really? For a dive? Yes, because I LOVE dives. And Ralph's is the best kind. Friendly, warm, cozy, fun, you get me, right?Drive up along New York Street and I already know what you're thinking. Run down, rickety old shack with steel bars on the door and front windows. Great. \u00a0DON'T BE FOOLED, FOOL!Atmosphere: Think your buddy's dad's basement bar. Not your buddy's bar, your buddy's DAD'S basement bar. Old neon, framed B&W pictures, historic Indy memorabilia, US military chachkies, etc. Think TGI Friday's, but all 'garage sale' and no Target.Food: Outstanding. Actually, its a pretty big menu. You can't go wrong anywhere, but my habit is to stay in the middle of the menu (the entrees). That section gets you two sides (soup is an up-charge; its worth it) AND dessert. I usually opt for the Beef Tenderloin Skewers. My wife prefers the \"T&A\" (that's Tips and Aug for you gutter dwellers) and then she 'shares' my dessert (of which I get NO say in). My (read: our) favorite finisher is the Cobbler of the Day served hot with a scoop of ice cream. \u00a0Sometimes blackberry, sometimes peach, sometimes cherry, always delicious. My father-in-law ALWAYS goes for the coconut cream pie and my mother-in-law can't pass on the multi-layer chocolate cake.Drinks: Sodas, great iced tea, lots of beers, both bottle and tap, including our favorite local, Sun King, and a full bar. My only suggestion is to add a single barrel bourbon to the shelf, or Indiana's own W.H. Harrison, Governor's Reserve, to keep it local. :-)Clearly, we love Ralph's. We go a couple times a month and sometimes I make it for lunch if I'm downtown. Call it good for any occasion, i.e., out-of-town guests, client lunch (if your client is cool), before a Colts game or after a Pacers game. If I was leaving, I'd want my going-away-party at Ralph's.

But we barely got inside the door and one of the workers asked if we had a baby in the carrier. Yep. Well, you can't have him in here, no kids under 14. I was so embarrassed!! I never saw a sign, and didn't see anything about it here... Well, apparently it's on their website. How nice. Not going back, though, even if I can get a sitter.

If you need a unique place to go downtown and want to say you've been to this little landmark... check it out."], ["Mia M.", "We went to Ralph's on a Thursday afternoon based solely on Yelp reviews. Thank you, fellow Yelpers - you were right on the money. Ralph's is delicious, affordable and 100% pretense-free. It looks like a total dive bar, complete with a ceiling that may or may not be caving in. We were greeted by a man whose demeanor and haircut led me to believe he is responsible for all the USMC memorabilia on the walls. He brought us our bottled/canned drinks (IBC root beer for me, Sun King Wee Mac for Kyle) wrapped in Ralph's coozies - a nice touch. He also quickly brought our order of horseradish-bacon dip, a dish I expected to be served warm. Rather, it's a cold, picnic-style dip, served with real-deal Ruffles. It's just as addictive as everyone's said.After realizing I was going to fill up on the dip, I ordered just a bowl of chili (with cheese and onions) and a side of pea salad. Kyle got the filet tips and cup of Hot Pot Pig (the potato au gratin soup). Someone else had mentioned here that the chili was bland and devoid of meat; I didn't really pick up on either of those faults. It definitely had a lot of beans, which is how I like my chili anyway, and the cheese and onion helped to kick it up a notch, but it was far from tasteless.The pea salad, however, was a bit disappointing. I think that's a matter of me being unfairly biased on pea salad thanks to my mom's one-of-a-kind recipe, though. I didn't try the filet tips, but Kyle was very impressed. The Hot Pot Pig... wow. The topping itself, crunchy and cheesy and potato-y, is worth its weight in gold.Our server, a very efficient and nice guy who called me \"dear\" a lot, recommended the mandarin orange cake that Debbie raved about. I couldn't resist... and it was just heavenly. Kind of a weird dessert to serve at a place that is primarily known for gourmet bar food, but I'm not complaining. I had to take quite a bit of my piece home due to being stuffed from everything else. Truly, my only complaint (or perhaps regret) is that I wish we'd come here in the fall or winter. I can just imagine how amazing that food would taste after coming in from the chilly weather."], ["Scott H.", "Cool working class dive. I went there for lunch on a Monday and it was crowded. The servers were nice, but they were a little bit slow. Lots of regulars. It seems like most of the people there knew each other. I ordered their specialty: T&A - tips and aug, which means beef tenderloin tips and cheesy potato soup. It cost $12.00. The tenderloin tips were DELICIOUS! They seriously tasted about as good as a St. Elmo steak. I was pleasantly surprised. If Ralph's is that good at cooking meat, I'll have to go back to give their hamburger a try."], ["D A.", "Tips and Aug is amazing! The Aug soup, is potato and cheese and croutons, and is one of the most delicious meals I ever tasted. \u00a0The Tips are so tender. \u00a0The shrimp and corn chowder was delicious as well. \u00a0It's also close to Sun King Brewery, so make a guys day of it. \u00a0They know what they are doing here!!"], ["Jon A.", "Ralph 3. Your Grandma 0. Your Grandma, or Mother teetering into the AARP Arena, just lost an upper hand in the market place. Ralph's coconut cream pie evokes the wholeness of a soothing Easter Sunday on an 18th green of Hilton Head, South Carolina. Whispy Atlantic breezes. Cool, calm & collected, that coconut cream makes me feel completely at peace. This is my new last supper -- stacks of 'em. After eating this pie, I now feel I could defeat Hemingway in a pie-eating - slash - syntactical battle in the thick of the Spanish-American War. Your Grandma just lost another point to that 1960s picnic-style horseradish-bacon dip (yes, served with Ruffles). This dip harks back to times where a future of above-ground pools was possible, where Schlitz what's for dinner, where people were proud of hood ornaments, and empowered by them, too. In fact, that's what Ralph's Great Divide stirs up entirely. A time where a rich alchemy of historic pride and, 'if we stick together at our small-town community establishments, a bright, prosperous future lies ahead.' When I walk into this place, I'm not surprised when my heart feels it's JFK sitting at that piano in Wayfarers; and I'll keep JFK in mind when Sean Baker hosts his Monday night Pianoke (that's Piano Sing-Alongs). If New York has dimly lit red-vinyl Italian eateries with the ghosts of Sinatra & the Rat Pack, then you can look at Ralph's Great Divide as Indy's more-humble version. (Yes, the review is over and you're asking, \"where'd that 3rd point come from?\" Ralph had the gumption grandma didn't when he said \"No!\" to allowing children in his establishment.)"], ["Jonathon M.", "My dear Indianapolis dwellers, what more can I say regarding the cultural landmark we call Ralphs Great Divide? It's cramped, old, the menu is interesting to say the least, there is a piano crammed in there straight from 1945, and in a building that is so in descript that one can drive by it 100 times and still not find it....it is also one of the greatest places in the city for a comforting meal. Ralphs is the kind of place you take people from out of town to give them a true taste of Hoosier hospitality and the quirky spirit that is part of Indianapolis heritage.The menu consists of mostly Ham and Bacon based products, but you will also find things like crab cakes. The ham is amazing and will most likely be the best you have ever eaten. I know families that put in orders with The Great Divide for whole hams to take home for holiday dinners. The ham sandwiches are with no doubt the star of the show at Ralphs. The co-star of the performance would have to be a bowl of the famous Big Pot Pig. It is a hearty soup consisting of bacon, potatoes, cheese, and ham. It is absolutely the perfect soup for the slight chill of a late fall Hoosier day.The homemade desserts are also a reason people love The Great Divide. Most enjoy the Coconut Cream Pie, but I have also had a carrot cake there that is the absolute best carrot cake I've had.Bottom Line: If you live here in the Circle City then you must have eaten at Ralphs Great Divide or make immediate plans to do so. The place is a landmark and the food is good enough to take home to family for holidays, and that should say it all. Next time you have an out of town visitor looking to experience some local flavor you can say \"I've got just the place. \""], ["Wayne M.", "We found this restaurant on Yelp while travelling from Baltimore, MD onthrough to Wichita Falls, Texas. We walked in and asked our friendly waiter what he recommended. After kindly informing us that \"everything is good\" he suggested two stellar dishes. I would continue on to describe them, but its more important to know that they have amazing homemade blue cheese and their meat is cooked as requested. Ask for medium rare and thats what you're gonna get!The decor leaves nothing wanting and is one of those places that leaves you scanning the walls from one object to another. Also, request the Coconut Cream Pie! If in the area, stop into the Sun King Brewery as well. It's only 3 minutes from Ralphs!"], ["Mark S.", "The food is good and the atmosphere is a nice dive restaurant. The issue is that the female owner with short hair is one of the nastiest people I have ever met in the service industry. \u00a0We actually got up and left after interacting with her. \u00a0Our server apologized for the owners behavior but her hands were obviously tied about doing anything to stop her. \u00a0 We will not be back until a \"under new management\" sign is hung on the front door. \u00a0I recommend Tick Tock Lounge as an alternative."], ["Brittany L.", "Great environment, wonderful food, and excellent service. I've been here plenty of times and have never been disappointed either with the service or the food. I've even eaten out on their little patio twice. The twinkle lights add charm and the fountain drowns out the sound of the interstate. There are even smoking and non-smoking areas on the patio! What follows is my original review from the first time I visited. Ralph's remains one of my favorite spots in Indy. Both members of the wait staff were very friendly to us, answered questions knowledgeably, and promptly bussed our dirty dishes. We were also warmly greeted when we entered. As a bonus, even though we were sitting near the door on one of the coldest days of the year, we weren't cold. On to the food! We each started out with a bowl of Hot Pot Aug (potato soup with melted cheese on top. Heavenly and absolute perfection on that cold February night. I had a grilled ham and cheese sandwich, which was grilled to a lovely golden brown, and the ham was evenly placed, rather than being piled up all in one place. Our waiter asked me what kind of cheese, bread, toppings, and even asked about preparation. I was shocked! It was awesome to get exACTly what I wanted. My partner ate the ribs. A half rack with 2 sides and dessert was $19.99. They were the best ribs I've had in YEARS. Fell right off the bone, full of flavor, not fatty but also super moist. We wished the sauce had been just a tad spicier or smokier, but the sauce wasn't even really necessary because the meat was SO wonderful. Moving on to the coconut cream pie: you MUST save room for this dessert! Even the crust is worth eating, and we usually leave that behind. Lots of coconut, not too much topping, velvety in texture and buttery in flavor. It's rich without being too sweet. This is now my favorite dessert in the city of Indianapolis. Hands-down. Full bar, no draft beers, but a great selection of local brews in bottles and cans. Also, the alcohol prices are kind of high, but once you see the location (right on the near east side) it'll make sense. For the 2 of us, 2 soups, sandwich, entree, 3 drinks, dessert, and good tip was just under $60. Ribs aren't available every day, so if you're set on those you might call ahead. Ralph's Great Divide is on New York Street, a one-way east-bound street that runs out of downtown. It's just off the Michigan/New York exit off I-65. The exit ramp turns into Davidson St (one way south)....so it's on the corner of Davidson and New York. Parking lot access is off Davidson. This bar is totally worth your while to seek out. Also, no children allowed...it's a bar! Ralph's used to not be open on weekends but is now and they close fairly early by bar standards through the week. Also, last time I tried to go on a Tuesday, I was sad and angry to learn that they'd traded out being open on Saturday for being closed on Tuesday. Weird, weird, weird choice."], ["Patrick R.", "Good food.. But not great. Went with the filet. Was cook semi-well. A little dry. A little chewy. Nothing to write home about. Sides were good.

My beef skewer and shrimp was very good however the vegetable medley, the broccolli could have been cooked a little longer.

Everything we ate and drank was unbelievable, even the side salad was ridiculously good with the homemade blue cheese dressing, fresh veggies and hard-boiled egg (a meal of it's own.) Both steaks were cooked perfectly at medium rare, the hot pot pig was UNBELIEVABLE, my husband took one bite and continued to pound the entire cup. It didn't matter though, because there was no way you could leave hungry with all of the food that we got. Nothing was even mediocre, from the hot rolls served before dinner to the angle hair pasta to the steaks EVERYTHING was superb. Now onto the desserts... RIDICULOUSLY good.

On the down side (the reason for not making 5 stars) it was a hot summer night in July, and the A/C just wasn't up to the job, so we were uncomfortably warm. My shirt was soaking wet by the time we left. But the food is out of this world good. When I say this place is tiny, I mean, in the non-smoking area where we were sitting, there couldn't have been room for more than 25 people.

A full-service bar, if you want mixed drinks, with different specials nightly. A variety of wines, if that's your thing. I ordered grilled grouper with mac n cheese, and they kindly let me sub grilled veggies for the house salad. The veggies were perfectly done, just slightly al dente--for me it could not have been better. The fish was fantastic, great flavor, I could have used tartar sauce, but the fish had enough flavor that t.s. was not necessary. The mac n cheese very creamy, and again perfect flavoring. Cuz-in-law went for the ham sandwich, said it was wonderful. The ladies all had meat w salad combos: one w steak skewer, two with grilled tuna steak. All gave high praise to their plates, and I also got to sample both the tuna and steak; very savory!Save room for dessert! The coconut cream pie is everything other reviewers have said. I had a butterscotch cream pie: absolutely to DIE for. We get back to Indy to visit fam every summer. We will definitely go back to Ralphs, probably a Monday night for the pianoke.

I went with the Provencal broth/seasoning option and that was delicious, especially when I dunked the nice fresh bread in it. The frites were delicious as well, the seasoning on them was just right and although they could have been a little crisper they hit all the right spots.

We actually wanted to do a youtube series of nothing but French Fry reviews. We found ourselves here one night after discovering Pommes Frites on their menu. The thing about the fancy snooty term of Pommes Frites (which to ME, I translate to french fries) is that they always come w/some type of dipping sauce. Pommes Frites are treated like some derivative of the french fry that yearns for dipping sauces and extended pinky fingers. I've been here several times, with the same friend and we've even pulled in other friends. Here's why: Pommes. Frites. Duh right? Well let me tell you, they serve their Pommes Frites in this huge canister (that's not really what it is but for the amount of fries, I have no better word right now). The cone shaped canister comes to your \u00a0table with dipping sauces holding hands in a circle around it and hundreds of fries. There are enough fries for a whole table of people to eat some and possibly still have leftovers. There are 12 dipping sauces I think, including homemade ketchup, aioli, mustard and pesto to name a few. They are all made in house. The pommes are freshly cut, long and pleasing to the palette. They have a great relationship between a hard fry and soft interior with a slightly brown exterior. My sisterfriend and I came here one night and left having added BB to our list of places to visit when Pommes Frites are in order. Service & Atmosphere: It's relatively small inside although I think they have outdoor seating available during the spring/summer months. There are two rooms, each small but usually full of people. Folks seem to love it here. I've never ordered anything but the fries and water, but from what it looks like, people enjoy the other food offerings as well. We've usually had friendly, prompt waiters so I have no complaints there. Overall, it's been a good experience so far. It's probably overdue time to take another trip for a canister cone of french fries...i mean, Pommes Frites."], ["Danny K.", "Excellent mussels and frites! The food was great.

His go-to order is the Hanger steak with eggs and pommes frites (pick from 8 - 12 different dipping sauces like vinegar and sea salt, homemade mayo, garlic aioli and curry). Knowing Brugge's frequent use of duck (from Maple Leaf Farms in northern Indiana), I opted for the duck confit sandwich with onions and tart cherries. Delicious! Although, I think this sammie would make a great open face option (Step aside bread, I like to keep my duck center stage). If you're looking to have the authentic Brugge experience, your order must include two things: beer and frites (beer is their own). Unfortunately, I wasn't feeling in a beer mood last night, so I opted for the budget-friendly glass of wine.

Their aiolis and sauces that accompany an imperative order of their fries are all amazing as well. I usually order the Provencal or Citron Moules Frites, which you could technically share with someone, but I devour every last drop. Not sorry.

The dogs barked and ran amock the whole time and at one point there was a dog licking another guest's leg while the owner sat and chatted with her friends. (The licked party looked so dejected.) There were lots of cringes and frowns from the guests on the patio but the dog owners were oblivious.

To be honest, I've never been excited about most northern European food. Crepes are not that exciting to me, and while Brugge has good ones, I feel like crepes are almost always a high price for what is essentially a thin pancake with meager filling. However, everything brewed by Brugge and Outliers is fantastic, and both are hard to find anywhere. There's always something unique in stock, and it's always a little more thoughtful and creative than most of what you could find elsewhere in Broad Ripple. Brugge is also one of the rare places where you can easily get a honkin' heap of fries and twelve different fries, ripe for sharing. While it's a bit difficult to pass in their fancy containers, and they're tall enough to interrupt conversations, they're delicious and exciting and make it all the more motivating to come with a large group of friends.Unfortunately, the strange geography of Brugge makes that a bit confusing. The downstairs is best suited to small tables, while the upstairs seems better for large groups or bar-sitters. Strangely, they seem to be managed almost separately, with different rules about who can sit where, how, and when in both locations. But at other times this doesn't seem to be the case. I never know where to enter or who to talk to and I often end up making some kind of mistake. It would almost be easier if both floors were either wholly together or wholly separate, like La Mulita and Delicia.

I had family visiting from out of town and I wanted to impress them... So we went to Brugge. Our experience began with being greeted by the most lackadaisical seating staff I've ever met who didn't know and didn't care if they had seating available on the patio. That experience was followed up by being brusquely advised that the kitchen was closing at 9 by our waitress (by the time we left, we were reminded of this about 3 or 4 times). That unfortunately set the tone for our visit.One of my visiting family is gluten and dairy intolerant (hint, do not go here if you are) and our waitress was almost angered by this news and seemed offended that she was required to answer questions about ingredients used in various dishes. With a wholly unnecessary attitude, she stated that she wasn't a dietician and wouldn't guarantee the contents of anything. After that, my sister felt like a burden to the waitress and stopped asking any more questions.Finally we settled on the mussels as this seemed our only safe option with the stipulation that the bread be served on the side rather than atop the mussels in the pot as per usual. When the mussels came out, our waitress removed the lid and revealed the bread, right on top. This prompted a very suspiciously sarcastic \"oh oops...\" and I do not recall an offer being made to take it back and serve us a new pot that wasn't potentially contaminated. My sister is extremely sensitive, but given the hostile undertones of the wait staff and our general experience, she chose to just risk it.You know what? The mussels, beer, and fries WERE great, they really were, but never in my life have I been more embarrassed in my selection of a restaurant as host to visitors. Never in my life have I or someone in my party been made to feel like more of a burden as a paying customer.Sorry Brugge, I enjoyed your food, but you lost my business forever last night."], ["Ashley P.", "One resounding word for Brugge: frittes!!!

Order the garlic aioli (not roasted) for the dip for fritesThen, shovel everything into your mouth as soon as it arrives, this food is best piping hot!

I had flagged Brugge when I first started looking into Indy-area restaurants (we just moved here in August.) because they brew their own beer, make their own fries, and serve two classic dishes that I love: steak frites and mussels in white wine sauce (you can choose other sauces). They have some GREAT beers, like the \"black\" (a Brugge beer) and the dark Czech lager (an Outliers beer). Strangely enough, they have some beers that I straight up do NOT like (the tripel and the white). Maybe I just don't like those styles, though. Anyway, the food was great, especially the fries. The dipping sauces along are worth the visit. I am docking them a star because the hangar steak, while great, had an earthiness that may be off-putting to those used to a more typical, beefy tasty. Again, maybe it's just me and I've had too many rib eyes! We went at a weird time, 3pm on a Sunday, and there was still quite a crowd. My guess is that this place gets packed at peak times.

There were no seats in the dining room so we decided to go upstairs and sit in the bar area. As before, I had no problem with the service and was waited on in a timely manner. I ordered the L'enorme pomme frites, which comes with all 12 dipping sauces. It was delicious, and transported me back to the time I spent traveling in Belgium. My daughter had the Grilled Chicken Crepe and a glass of Riesling and was pleased with that, as well. She was so pleased that she stated she would bring her fianc\u00e9 back to experience it. I plan to visit again with my husband in the near future."], ["Tony C.", "This place is great! \u00a0I ordered the muoles frites (mussels and fries) and it was delicious. \u00a0I love the fact you have choices of different flavors you can order prepare the mussels in. \u00a0I ordered the citron flavor which consisted of lime juice, cilantro, onions, and jalapenos. \u00a0It was nice and acidic from the lime juice with a bit of heat from the peppers. \u00a0The waiter recommended the Jamaican jalapeno flavor (if you like the heat) which I will try next time I'm in town."], ["Katelin N.", "My favorite restaurant in Broad Ripple and possibly all of Indy!

It's a sight to be seen, and I've had many people seated around me ask if they could take a picture of it. Yup.. they'll be getting that the next time they come!If you're in the mood for prince edward island mussel, I highly suggest them with red curry. They've got a great heat to them, and as far as I'm concerned.. it raises your metabolism and allows you to have a nutella crepe afterwards without having to count the calories.

We were hoping for another great stop on our self-guided beer tour of the North side, and maybe some nibbles to go with.The food is fine - we got the mussels, bread, and fries. The beer is ok, not a standout but drinkable. The service is a bummer. Brugge has a very \"too cool for school\" vibe, and the service is an extension of that.

Three amigos = l'enorme frittes is perfect. We got all the sauces [most are delicious] and had more than enough fries. Divided by 3 is a wonderful deal. All of us got crepes of different types [sausage, duck breast & artichoke hearts]. All were tasty! The greens salad side + vinagrette was splendid too. The only thing that was lacking [pulling this down to a 4] was service.

These are the reason you'll want to invite your friends (because only weirdos go to a restaurant alone to eat frites and drink beer). Don't mull over the sizes. Just go for l'Enorme! Not only adequate for 5-6 patrons but also HUGE!

You can't find better mussels in the city and the frites are top notch. LOVE the sea salt vinegar and house made mayo dipping sauces. Top it all off with a dessert crepe!? Be still my heart. There has been a wait the past few times we've visited (even in the middle of the week). I feel like this speaks well to their food and beer.

There are times that I eat something that I know is terrible for me and then regret it later, but not with these. Whatever negative health outcomes I may face for having a fistful of these frites is well worth it to me. I also had their duck crepe, which was equally delicious. I'm a sucker for well-cooked duck, and delicious duck in a lovely crepe is what I got. My wife got a sandwich and she seemed to enjoy it, but I don't remember much of what she said - I was too busy filling up on fries and crepe. Oh, and be sure it wash it all down with a glass of one of their beers. I had the Tripel de Ripple and loved it, but I hear the sours are pretty wonderful as well.

About two minutes after our order was put in, another couple tried to order the same thing and was told that the kitchen was out of mussels! Which was too bad because those mussels were pretty darn delicious. The sauce was slightly creamy and very garlicky. I only wish there was a touch more salt in the broth to bring out the flavors even further. The frites sauces were standard, probably won't get the pesto again.

We heard about Brugge Braserie during the Yelp Elite Paleo party from the awesome guys at Outliers Brewing. This seems like a really cool place when it's warm out. There were limited tables available for dining so if you are in a large group I would not recommend this place. There is a bar upstairs as well. They have a good selection of beer on tap. I tried the Bloomington persimmon. I thought it was really good. We were told it was a 45 min wait for a table but we were seated in 25 mins! There were a few, albeit good & tasty options for vegetarians. We ordered the Portobello sandwich it comes with frites and two dipping sauces. The frites were really good ... I would not recommend the sweet chili sauce though; It's just sweet... no chili. The French bread was a bit too chewy but I liked the grilled vegetables. We also ordered a crepe with scrambled eggs, roasted tomato, beer glazed onions and cheese. This crepe was ridiculous. The flavors just work! We were pretty full but the dessert crepe was calling my name. It was peanut butter stuffed, drizzled with chocolate and honey and topped with chopped roasted peanuts. The warm crepe melted the peanut butter so when you cut into it ... it oozed out and mated with the chocolate and honey. Yummy!!"], ["Maria L.", "Very conveniently located along the Monon Bike Trail, this spot is great for a beer and crepes! The frites a great to share with many options for dipping sauces. I've had the duck crepe (good but slightly oily), the shaved brussels crepe (good veggie option, the chili oil adds quite a bit), and pork tenderloin crepe (pork/mustard/leek - great combo!). I tried the duck confit mitraillette once and did not every try another again simply because it was too much food and messy. The oysters seem like a hit with all my friends (I can't eat seafood, sadly). The ambience is very lively and packed. The wait can be long on the weekends but it's worth it!"], ["Robin L.", "Really awesome mussels. You must must must get the mussels when you're here. The mussel options are plentiful and really run the gamut from good 'ol Proven\u00e7al to really out there \u00a0flavor combinations.

So good!"], ["Joel F.", "The upstairs is 21+ so it's great to be able to get away from families and younger kids.The staff is nice and friendly. The food and environment is unique to say the least.

Not really my idea of a meal. The second time I had a chicken plate and that was better. Though it was better, it wasn't enough to make me want to go back just because I can. I feel in my opinion this is more of a special occasion kind of place.If you are in the mood for something different then by all means try this place out....it definitely is worth a shot."], ["Kasey L.", "We are not mussel eaters, but I really like the chicken pesto sammie. My husband has tried the meatball (eh) and duck confit (yum!). My father-in-law cleaned his plate after eating the sausage sammie. I wish they didn't serve the fries on top of the sandwiches, but that must be a thing I just don't understand.The fries are the stars for us. Plentiful, well seasoned, hot, and crispy. I like that there are about 12 different sauce options, but I would LOVE if there were more sauces that were non-mayo based. The pesto and house made ketchup are great. We're kind of eh on the honey mustard equivalent and andalouse sauce. It would be great to see some other options that are cream or olive oil based!The vibe and flow of the restaurant are a little weird. You have to walk outside to get to the second floor, which isn't ideal when it's thunderstorming. I think the service is pretty average, but no specific incidents to complain about.Brugge is definitely a solid four stars.

It gets pretty crowded on the weekends, but for 2 dinners and 2 large beers, you can still have a tab under $30."], ["Steve W.", "I visited Brugge with the wife on Saturday for date night. This was my second visit and her first. She isn't a meat or seafood eater, but she was craving fries, and I knew just the place. We arrive around 8pm and were told there was a 40 minute wait. It was raining so the outdoor seating wasn't an option. Understandable wait time. We sat near the entrance for about 5 minutes and discussed whether to stay or walk down to Corner Wine Bar. We decided to stay, and ventured over to the bar for a drink while we waited. On our walk, the hostess told us she had a table ready for us. So our 40 minute wait actually took less than 10 minutes. We were seated at a 4 top in the middle of the downstairs room. A loud area, but we were happy to get a seat so quickly. Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable in all aspects of the menu. He told me about each of the Brugge beers, and brought me a sample of the one that sounded the best (the Stout). I had a pint and my wife had a couple glasses of wine. As previously stated, my wife is more of an herbavore, and went with the mushroom sandwich (glazed sweet onion, french dijon, cr\u00e8me fraiche, roasted red pepper) with fries. She didn't enjoy the way it was presented with the fries covering the sandwich, nor did she enjoy the mustard based sauce on the sandwich, but she did enjoy the fries. Again, the reason we came to Brugge was because she wanted good fries, so mission accomplished. I ordered the Mussels, which is clearly the best choice at Brugge. I orderd the Noir (brugge black beer, cheddar, bacon, walnuts). The combo was fantastic. As my wife didn't like the mustard sauce on her sandwich, she only ate the mushrooms and not the bread...so I happily used her bread to soak up more of my broth after my mussels were gone. My only complaint about the dish was that it was extremely salty. After discussing that with our waiter, he told me it varies night-to-night based on who is cooking. Either way it was tasty, I just couldn't drink the broth in the end. My only dislike was the sweet chili sauce, which was actually recommended by the waiter. It was very oily and didn't have a strong flavor. Not to worry, because when the waiter recommended it he promissed to switch it out for something else if I didn't like it. He followed through with the promise and and brought me the house made ketchup. The ketchup wasn't very complex, but when I mixed in a bit of the roasted garlic aoli it was a delicious combo. I also had the horseradish dipping sauce, which is good, but not as good as Twenty Tap's horesradish sauce. Back to the fries. After our meal, I asked how they cook the fries. The watier provided extreme detail into the process. He told me the type of oil, the cooking temperatures, and how many times and at what temperature the blanch the fries. I'm not going to write it here, because he basically told me the secrets to their amazing fries...which was probably more than he needed to share. All you really need to know is: The fries are amazing, but they are cooked in Peanut Oil, so beware if you have an allergy. Overall, it was a good expereince and a fun date night. Brugge is not a cheap dinner, but it is an enjoyable one. Go for the beer, mussels, and frites or maybe the duck sandwich if seafood isn't your thing."], ["David A.", "Food was 5 stars. Service was 3. Our server was friendly but overwhelmed. The food took a very long time to come out. We waited for 30 minutes for steamed Mussels app. Then another 30 minutes for our mains which were sandwiches. The atmosphere is cool, the fries/frites are on point. All the dipping sauces that I tried were very good. \u00a0I highly recommend, but be prepared to wait."], ["Michael B.", "Had heard great reviews and was super excited to try the frites and sauces, but came away a little let down. Really like the location and atmosphere, and the tables made so the frites can hang out in the middle are great. The frites themselves were really good, but the sauces were a big disappointment. We tried all of them, and it definitely felt like quantity over quality. There were maybe 2-3 out of 12 that I wanted to try more than a couple of times, and maybe narrowing it down to a 5-6 better options would be helpful. Service was also pretty spotty, as we waited a long time between visits back to check on drinks and to order food.Overall love the idea, but the execution wasn't great when I went, and I'd rather just hit somewhere I know will be on point with a good meal with fries and good ole Heinz or bbq sauce."], ["Matt D.", "Great selection of mussels. \u00a0It is in a cool park of town. \u00a0The service was really good. \u00a0My wife really liked their fries."], ["Annissa M.", "Finally crossed Brugge off of my Indy foodie bucket list, and I'm thinking I'll probably return before I move off into the sunset.

You can't really go wrong with any of the crepes or sandwiches.

L'enorme is a wonderful and massive cone of french fires with awesome, house-made dipping sauces, the crepes are nice, and the mussels are great, but the service in recent years has gone way downhill.The last time I was there I saw my waiter maybe once, and he also stole my wife's water glass before we were ready to leave and acted like they were closing down even though the sign on the door said they were still open for another 45 minutes. The time before that the waiters were condescending and tried to talk myself, my wife, and my mom out of everything we tried to order, and the time before that we were forgotten about after we were seated for about 20 minutes.Management is clearly setting the wrong atmosphere in the restaurant, and the annoying service is starting to outweigh the good food."], ["Jennie T.", "I'm not supposed to drink while I'm on my medication, so I'll admit: I cheated a little bit.

We'd have wanted to bring some home to share with our friends. This was the only restaurant in Indianapolis that we visited more than once. We came here two days in a row. The second day, we only had mussels and frites. We chose the creamy lemon broth for the mussels, and it was delicious. A pot of mussels plus a cone of frites was enough to satisfy the both of us.

I'm not much a fan of Belgian beer, and unfortunately this place's signature offerings were no exception.

I used this as my meal and could only eat a little over half of the plate. I also ordered a small frites and chose the hot curry and roasted garlic aoili as my dipping sauces.

It might be because of the accompanying sauces tyou can choose from but whatever it is I definitley crave them.Now, I am not the biggest (cooked) seafood fan (i know, i know...) but their mussells are super tasty! I love picking the seasoning/sauce/broth they come in and look forward to trying all of them. In this instance we went with the red curry whcih had a good amount of spice. Perfect for sharing.The duck crepes is my old standby and was better than I remeber on this visit.I was kinda shocked to see that more of thier in house beers werent available and in speaking to a friend we were dining with found out that recently they are only featuring one or two at a time of thein own brews. Not too sure why but I hope this changes.great outdoor seating and I love the large round table in the back for groups (plus their is a hole in the table to put your cone of frites!!!)"], ["Emily V.", "The beer was incredibly disappointing. the only one worth mentioning was the milk stout. We also noticed they had more guest taps then their own beer - definite red flag. Staff was really nice and attentive, and the physical ambiance was lovely. \u00a0I liked the copper tables and wood walls. We didn't eat, so I can't remark on the food. But as a craft beer enthusiast, I would not return or recommend to anyone."], ["Michael C.", "Five stars is maybe a slight stretch, but only slight. It's the only Belgian place in Indy, the food and beer are very good, and now that I think about it, it's probably the best \u00a0Belgian restaurant I've eaten at outside of Belgium. It says here on Yelp it's not good for kids but it is. They even have a kids menu, and my oldest enjoys the PB&J cr\u00eape.As a general rule, you can't go wrong with the mussels, but last time I got a sandwich and it was quite tasty. Also the charcuterie is top notch. \u00a0All the beers are good, but the Triple de Ripple is the obvious choice for those who want something different and intoxicating."], ["Benjamin M.", "Great food and great drink are always a wonderful combination and Brugge Brasserie delivered both during my recent visit. I took Misti Y's great advice and focused on three things: mussels, frites and beer.Of course this was after fighting to find a parking spot outside (limited and busy) and then lucking into a seat at the small bar. I gazed at the dozen of mouthwatering mussel options while my stomach attempted to beat my brain into a decision. I eventually asked the bartender his recommendation and luckily he mentioned one of the versions I was eying up: Classic Blue. While waiting for my meal, I sipped on a His Excellency \u00a0Dubbel, one of their own smooth, semi-strong dark ales. I also looked over their other drink options and was shocked, yet impressed, to see Victory's Golden Monkey (PA) in bottles. Well done.Eventually the bartender delivered a massive pot, filled with two pounds of mussels topped with blue cheese and bacon, as well as a cone of frites and a slice of French Bread. I wasn't sure if I could finish the whole thing and came pretty darn close, only leaving a few drowning stragglers behind. Naturally, the bread continually begged to be dipped into the sauce and I happily obliged, leaving no trace it ever existed.Brugge was an excellent place to partake in such a heavenly, Belgian trinity. I'd definitely return again. 4.5 Stars. #600"]]}
