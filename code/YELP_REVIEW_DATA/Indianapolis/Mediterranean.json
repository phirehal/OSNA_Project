{"Saffron Cafe": [["Lynn J.", "I loved this place at first sight but then the food came and I wanted to move next door.We began preparing our palates for lunch with honeyed lemonade. (Can I make this at home?!)Then we all shared an antipasto plate, a Couscous Royal and a Tajine Lamb with honey.I loved every bite and just want to go back to try to enjoy other and heavier dishes for dinner.Ben was attentive and helpful but never hovered. Timing was good and we got through lunch without anxiety to go to the airport. This is definitely on my list for a revisit."], ["Taffanee K.", "The service was excellent. Ben,my waiter, was extremely helpful in aiding me with choices. The smell of the food dishes was so tantalizing that I dug in and forgot to take photos prior to eating. Trust the presentation was beautiful. But note, the smell does not do the food justice. The food was truly extraordinary. Every morsel was a delight to my taste buds and I must say they are still amazed. Saffron is off the beaten path but you must find this path!"], ["John B.", "Awesome place, great food, interesting and nice interior. I had the shwarma plate with chicken and vegetable soup. It was quite good.I will be returning!"], ["Melanie C.", "I absolutely adore this place. Very romantic setting and wonderful decor. The food is fantastic! I had a three course meal deal off groupon and everything I tried was superb. The service was also fantastic. This would make a perfect date night!"], ["Anna R.", "Ate here for lunch today - delicious! I had the honey chicken tajine, and it came with hot bread right out of the oven. The bread was wonderful when dipped into the tajine sauce/broth. My friends' food was reportedly excellent as well; it looked great. The waiter gave such helpful suggestions and descriptions, and was so very gracious and friendly (without being overbearing or over-present)."], ["Kyle W.", "I have been to the Saffron Cafe twice since moving to Indianapolis, and I have to say, I felt like I was back in Morocco. From the decor to the smells, you will feel like you just left Indiana. The restaurant is very quaint and probably only seats 30 to 40 people indoors. They do have an enclosed outdoor patio area. However, I've only ever been during the winter so I don't know if it is able to be opened up. If you are planning to attend with a larger group (5+) i would definitely call ahead and and make a reservation.The inside of the restaurant is adorned with paintings, chandeliers, teapots, and tajines that seem to have come straight from Morocco. Having spent a couple of weeks in Morocco, this is the closest I've come to experiencing the same type of food here in Indiana. I've had the Ginger Chicken Tajine and the Couscous Royale. I would definitely recommend any of the tajines for the experience of having an authentic Moroccan meal. The portions are large and one meal could be split between two people. My wife and I split the Couscous Royale; it consists of slow-stewed vegetables with Moroccan herbs and spices served atop saffron couscous. We added grilled chicken for an additional charge and made it a meal.A special recommendation on the tea and dessert. I'm told the mint tea is very unique to Morocco. Having drank a cup of it a day (some times more than once) during my trip, I grew to love it. They serve hot mint tea at Saffron Cafe that is as authentic as it gets. When I say hot, I do mean HOT. Don't accidentally grab the tea pot without the mitt or you might be biting your tongue to hold back the swears like I recently did. They offer the mint tea in three different serving sizes. If it is your first time trying it, opt for the single serving, there is enough for 2 or 3 cups. The dessert we had was amazing, although be sure to share as the piece of cake we had was very large. We chose the lemon with raspberry sauce layer cake.A note on the parking for the restaurant: There is a side lot to the left of the restaurant if you are facing it. DO NOT PARK HERE. This is for residence only and your vehicle will be ticketed or towed. Now there is a large parking lot right behind the restaurant that seems to be a paid lot for workers downtown. However, both times I have visited has been in the evenings and the lot was completely empty. I parked here for over an hour both times and had no issues. The Saffron Cafe is one of my favorite restaurants I have found so far in Indy. It makes me feel like I am back in Morocco and that is a great feeling. Can't wait to take my wife to the restaurant again!"], ["Leann P.", "I am now officially in love with the Saffron Cafe--food, decor, dessert, owners--all of it is perfect!The night we went the dinner special was \u00a0mahi mahi with a sun dried tomato/olive tapenade. It was probably one of the best meals I've ever had! Even my husband who doesn't like fish enjoyed it. The owners would be crazy not to make this an item on their everyday menu! I did have a bit of food regret that I ordered the potatoes as my side instead of the couscous, but I'll switch it up next time.I ordered the lemon mascarpone cake for dessert. It was huge! My suggestion would be to try to eat it all there. The half I took home was not nearly as good the next day.One of my favorite things is that the owner comes around to all the tables, introduces himself and talks to each person about his/her dish. He told me about the olives from the tapenade and how they are prepared, but asked other people about how specific parts of their dish were prepared (over or under done). He showed a true interest in quality control and customer satisfaction.I'll definitely be going back in the future! Check Groupon for deals before you go!"], ["Greg P.", "A friend of mine purchased a Groupon gift for my retirement for the cooking class. It was a very informative presentation about whole food cooking and the associated health benefits. The food prepared during the four hour session was delicious and the chef's explanation was very enlightening. I'd recommend this class very much if you want to change to a healthier lifestyle."], ["John S.", "Saffron is a great place to get Moroccan food. \u00a0Good service and well presented. \u00a0 This is a must. \u00a0Next time I watch the cooking channel as Rick Staves enjoys a cup of Moroccan coffee, I will know what he is tasting. \u00a0Yum oh gee"], ["Hannah T.", "AMAZING! I will defiantly be back. Great atmosphere and wonderful food. The service was relaxed yet my drink was never empty. I will tell all my friends if the great food and service. Thank you!"], ["Lane P.", "We had driven by Saffron Cafe a few times and it always caught our attention, but we were always too lazy to do any research. But, one night, we had budgeted for a decent meal and we thought of this spot.Saffron cafe didn't disappoint one bit. We walked in and the staff promptly seated us and brought us a delicious basket of bread and a couple menus. The server was extremely knowledgable about the food. Having never eaten Moroccan food, we had a lot of questions.In the end, we ordered mussels to start. They were super well-seasoned and cooked to perfection.For dinner, I ordered a couscous dish with chicken, and my partner had a tajin.I ordered mine as spicy as they could make it and my partner a bit milder. It was absolutely delicious. Portions were enormous and quality was spectacular. They didn't lie when they asked me to rate my heat preference on a scale from 1 to 5. 5 didn't disappoint.We also had a great French ros\u00e8 with dinner. All in all, it was a bit pricy but worth every penny."], ["Ryan D.", "Tired of the same old places? \u00a0So were we! \u00a0Thanks to a number of great reviews on Yelp we decided to swing in and taste Saffron Cafe.First off - parking - just find street parking and walk over to the restaurant. \u00a0It will be a lot easier than having to move your car if you parked in the private lot and avoid it from being towed!When you walk into Saffron Cafe the decor jumps out at you. A busy tile work transports you to Morocco. \u00a0The dining room is low lit which helps create a warm and welcoming environment. \u00a0Hints of spice are in the air - you know you are in for a treat.The seating area is cozy and offers plenty of space for conversation or a romantic dinner. \u00a0The staff is friendly and quick to seat you.Water and bread are offered right way. The menu has quite the selection. \u00a0On this night we selected the mussels as our appetizer. \u00a0To drink, a bottle of Rose. \u00a0If you haven't had a Rose wine - give it a try. \u00a0A playful dry wine with a hint of fruit. \u00a0The mussels arrived and the first thing I did was drunk bread into the broth. \u00a0The broth was a rich and creamy saffron delight. \u00a0The mussels were the perfect beginning.The hard part is deciding what to have for dinner. \u00a0The entrees all looked wonderful. \u00a0I settled for a tagine mixed with meat and potatoes. \u00a0I should have gone with the more authentic flavor and had lamb, but I went with beef. \u00a0When it arrived and the top is lifted off the aroma is amazing. \u00a0Spices punch your palate and you want to dive right in! \u00a0The beef was awesomely tender, the potatoes cooked nicely, and the gravy - oh so good!!If you can save room for dessert, do it! \u00a0The mascarpone cake looked amazing. At the least have a cup of coffee. \u00a0Hints of cinnamon and a dark roast - very, very good.if you haven't stopped in - please do!!! \u00a0It's amzaing."], ["Elizabeth S.", "The outside is gorgeous. It's colorful and gets your attention. You walk in and are greeted by a warm server. When you are seated you will notice that it's a very traditional American sit down place surrounded by a Moroccan coating. That is the best way I can describe it.The first thing I ordered was the traditional tea (it's a honey mint green tea). Now you have to understand that I am a snob about my tea. It is good... one of the closest things to Morocco in there. (Best part of the meal was the tea). The only problem I had with it was it didn't get to seep long enough and the type of water they were using with the tea.The main course was ok. Nothing to rave about. It was traditionally presented but very rushed. Everything was cooked but not allowed to absorb the flavor. The broth was unbelievable though.We then got dessert. I got the tiramisu. I have never had such a disappointing tiramisu. My boyfriend had almost all of it because I took a bite and hated it."], ["Christopher M.", "What a gem! The whole setup is great, except their patio seating is...kinda odd. I like the idea of it, but, the implementation was off somehow. The rest of the place is very well done and decorated. Traditional looking middle-eastern decor, etc.The food was very good and very interesting. Fruit? In a stew? When have you ever had _that_ before? I got an actual prune in my Tajini Lamb Honey.These flavors, if you grew up in Indy, are not going to be very familiar, so, keep an open mind. First of all, Saffron? I'm just not mad about it. But it was good, and an experience. Not sure I'd eat stuff with it in it every day. With the sesame, honey, apricots, side of lamb, and all the juices, it worked really well.My one complaint is that they brought on bread basket out for myself and my co-worker who both ordered food that was supposed to come with its own bread. This made us do the awkward dance of \"am I eating all this guy's bread?\". At the end they asked if we wanted more (oh, now they tell me that's an option...).The tea was good, but nothing to write home about. Definitely try it if you haven't had it and want the full experience, but, it wasn't earth shattering or anything."], ["Brie W.", "This place is my all time favorite restaurant. Not only is the food delicious and authentic, but the atmosphere i wow."], ["Kimberly V.", "We sat in the covered outdoor area and had a lovely meal. Great service by the chef's wife! Highly recommend the Moroccan red wines. Entrees were fish and lamb with cilantro pesto and were delicious. It's on the pricier side, but a real gem."], ["Ronak S.", "Sometimes, a city gets its first restaurant representing a nationality, and it preoccupies itself with pandering to American palates and expectations, becoming a bland and monotonous cuisine that pours a new sauce on the same fried meats. Saffron Cafe is not that kind of place. It manages to introduce Indianapolis to an entirely new style of eats while still being absolutely delicious. I generally only have water with dinner, but I get the Kahwa tea or honeyed lemonade with every meal I have at Saffron. They're irresistable. If you're with a group, start off with an antipasto plate to split. The hummus is good -- although there is better hummus in Indianapolis -- but the zaalouk and bakoula are amazing, and with the platter everyone gets to try all three. There are plenty of good entrees, but for a first experience, your best bet is a tajine. I love the deliciously sweet and spiced Couscous Tfaya as well. After eating here, you'll put cinnamon in just about everything you make.You'll never find a restaurant that's prouder of its cuisine, nor more devoted to educating its customers about it. Chef Sentissi teaches Moroccan cooking classes, and the website provides plenty of resources about the techniques and health benefits of Moroccan cooking and spices. Saffron Cafe is an absolutely gem of Indianapolis. Get there."], ["Shiran P.", "Horrible Moroccan food... And I'm real morocan !!I eat the cuscus with \"lame\" ( it was beef)Was not good... The server very slow, but helpful.I'm not gonna go back there never agin!!"], ["Michelle P.", "Went tonight for the first time with my husband and the experience was even better than we expected!First - make sure to find street parking. The lot next door looks like it's for the restaurant but it's not and you will get towed if you park there. Once you get inside it is really cute - beautiful tile walls and ornate tajines displayed make the restaurant feel very authentic and less like you're in the middle of Indiana.Everything we tasted was delicious and so much food! Each meal could easily serve two people, three if you get one of the paellas. Over the course of the meal we had:- Bastilla: a chicken pastry almost, warm with a flaky top, a little sweet and with a hint of cinnamon. Delicious!- Mussels: probably our favorite dish of the night, make sure you soak up the extra broth with the housemade bread- Seafood paella: not quite as good as tradition spanish paella (IMO) but still great flavor and packed with seafood. It was a ridiculous amount of food, we easily could have split it and still had food leftover- Honeyed Cornish game hen: really unique dish, the broth is sweet and well spiced and game hen was cooked perfectly, not too dryOverall the atmosphere was great, service was quick and pretty friendly, and the food was amazing. We will definitely be back!"], ["Aslam Q.", "The plus: We had an older gentleman as our waiter, and he was great! The service was indeed excellent. The food: Average. We ordered a hummus as an appetizer - it was average, not great. The food was okay. I had more expectations from the food given that it priced a little on the high end. I have had a lot of middle eastern/Moroccan food. I think the food is a little pricey for what it's worth. The bread that they served was awesome though. I would recommend this place though."], ["Allison P.", "First time visit. \u00a0Food was great. Service was good. \u00a0A couple of plates and a napkin not so clean. \u00a0We will definitely try again."], ["Christina C.", "Saffron has incredible food. The couscous was a bit disappointing though. I really enjoyed the rest of the food. \u00a0Good environment and the staff is excellent. The only complaint I can say is the last time I was there, the plates they had given my husband and I were still dirty. We're stained and still had bits of food on them which was pretty gross. They also had just mopped the floor when I came in so I had a strong smell of cleaner while I was trying to eat which was unpleasant. They should prep sooner before opening to avoid that problem. The waiter was absolutely amazing. I would go again for the food."], ["Jay A.", "A decent restaurant, but I felt that the flavors were toned down compared to other Moroccan food that I've had. Where we're the preserved lemons and green olives? The sharp, pungent spices that I find so intoxicating in Moroccan dishes \u00a0were mostly missing from our selections. Instead, there was an emphasis on sweet sauces, and gentle flavors.So, the tagines were tasty, but a little polite for my taste. Perhaps the chef is trying to appeal to a broader, less adventuresome clientele. That might be you, and perhaps you'll love it. It's worth a try. Good service, and a decent selection of dishes. Next time I'll see if they can pump it up a bit. 3.5 \u00a0- rounded up for good service."], ["Jeremy H.", "Took my wife here for our anniversary.We don't usually use groupon but I found a attractive dinner package for $70. The wait staff was great, and they suggested a good wine. Other than that the food was gross (microwaved), served on cafeteria style plates, and was just plain nasty. I ordered the most expensive thing on the menu (seafood) and what a disappointment. Legs still on the shrimp, mud vain partially removed, old microwaved fish at the bottom under the couscous, muscles that were over a day old, and absolutely no saffron or seasoning to be found. My wife ordered the lamb and it was just lamb in a bowl. It tasted ok but then again so does most roasted meats so I can't imagine that was hard to prepare. Over all I had high expectations of this restaurant. However after our experience I would find it hard for them to stay in business. Lesson learned. Don't buy the groupon for this place, you'll get treated poorly."], ["Cheyenne E.", "My boyfriend and I first tried Saffron Cafe with a groupon. We've been back at least twice now. The food here isn't just delicious, it's an experience. From the decor and atmosphere to the food, it's amazing. The first time we came I believe I ordered the cumin chicken tanjine and my boyfriend one of the lamb ones. Mine was delicious. The chicken was tender, juicy, and it fell right off the bone. While I won't eat lamb, my boyfriend throughly enjoyed his as well. I had tried to like hummus, but I find store bought ones to be gross, Saffron Cafe changed that for me. Only here will I eat hummus. I highly recommend the honeyed lemonade. It's very sweet and not overbearing. Lastly, the desserts are worth it. It's hard to order them because the meal portions are so large, but you can always take it home. I love this place and I can't wait until we get a chance to go back!"], ["Kelly Y.", "Moroccan food, how I missed you!Ever since I was introduced to homemade Moroccan food in D.C., I have been craving it and looking for it around here. \u00a0I have finally found a Moroccan restaurant that features not \"Mediterranean\" or \"Middle Eastern\", but Moroccan food! \u00a0There is only one of these within at least 200miles of Louisville! Perhaps even 300 miles.True to its name, the Saffron Cafe is more casual than formal like some other Moroccan dining destinations can be. \u00a0Their food is every bit like I remembered: exotic, yet familiar and comfort tasting. \u00a0I devoured the eggplant app. while hubby dug into the bastilla. \u00a0Their version of the bastilla is filled with chicken, apricot and scrambled eggs. \u00a0(I have had other versions that has ground beef instead). \u00a0The toasted almonds on top really livened up this \"pie\". \u00a0The requisite ground cinnamon and powdered sugar are sprinkled on the sides of the dish so the diner can choose the amount. \u00a0It is definitely a savory/sweet dish; kinda odd at first bite, but even hubby want to keep going back to it over and over.I ordered the Cous Cous Royale for my entr\u00e9e, adding slow roasted lamb cuz it is just wrong to come to a Moroccan place and not get lamb! \u00a0 It was presented to me in a tagine. \u00a0Once that cover was removed, I was in heaven! \u00a0This is just what I have been craving! \u00a0Moist lamb, tender, soft vegetables over a pile of cous cous. \u00a0This is a dish that would please an adventurous eater as well as the most boring/picky of palates. \u00a0Hubby had one of their kabob plates. \u00a0And they also serve Italian classics in case you simply can't convince someone in your party to try something new and exciting.For dessert, I only had enough room left for a serving of their mint tea. \u00a0It was a perfect end to this meal.One extra star for the attentive, friendly and un-intrusive service. \u00a0One last note, if you parked anywhere that is not on the street, you will be towed. \u00a0Your server will kindly remind you of that upon entering the restaurant."], ["Ramya C.", "I really wanted to like this place. I read many many good reviews and I've been wanting to check this place out for a long time.I finally went there today to celebrate a friend's birthday. The food was below average in my opinion. We ordered Bakoula, chicken kabbab and the lamb tajine. Bakoula was decent. The pita bread was warm and soft. The chicken kabbab was okay. Some parts of it were undercooked. I've had better kabobs in less popular places in Indy. The lamb tajine was bad. It was flavorless and bland. We really expected something better for a $24 entree. The bread served with the entree was cold and hard.It was a bad experience for us overall and I wish we chose a different place to celebrate my friend's birthday."], ["Harrison P.", "Went here for lunch and it was pretty good! I had never had morrocan food before, so I was going in not exactly knowing what to expect. I guess I anticipated really spicy food, but it was surprisingly much more mild/Mediterranean.Had the kafta (ground beef) kabab with couscous, and like i said, it was very mild. However there was a little side of sauce that was very spicy!...so I guess I was both right and wrong in my assumptions.I give it the 3 star rating because I don't have any other morrocan food experiences to compare it too. I also think it was slightly overpriced. And, lastly, I brought the rating down a little b/c the server did not seem friendly to us amateurs.But overall...pretty solid! Great place to try your first North African cuisine."], ["Ryan B.", "Came here tonight for dinner.Service from the waiter was okay at first, but when we declined to order appetizers and drinks the server started to have a bad attitude. \u00a0I ate the honey lamb tajin and it tasted bland and I didn't enjoy it.

Saffron Cafe is the real deal.Only two months after getting back from Morocco, my friend and I visited Saffron Cafe. The authenticity of this quaint restaurant nearly brought tears to my eyes. Even the bathroom reflects the culture with traditional Moroccan babouche shoes covering the walls.Let's talk food. Being the soup and legume-obsessed goonie that I am - I had a hayday with the Harrira soup filled with chickpeas, cilantro, tomatoes and saffron rice. I also had some sort of side that included avocados and oranges - couldn't seem to find the name of this item on the online menu but it reminded me of the sliced oranges with cinnamon that we had at our riad in Marrakech. Again, real deal. Tajine! This is as close to Morocco as it gets. The Almond Chicken Tajine was amazing. That's what is so great about tajines, they have this mysterious way of achieving sweet and savory harmony in the best of ways...not to mention the adorable pot that they are cooked in. Last but not least. Dessert. I can't recall the specific name for it but don't let my lack of memory be a reflection of how glorious this sweet mascarpone cheesecake is. \u00a0 Good news fellow Indianapolitans! The next best thing to enjoying a meal in a riad in Morocco is located on Ft.Wayne Avenue in Downtown Indianapolis."], ["Stacy P.", "Wanting to try something different and new, I found myself walking into the Saffron Cafe. The restaurant itself is very small and tiny, think old house turned into restaurant, but there were additional tables outside the enterance that were enclosed.While there was no gluten free menu per say, I could order almost everything on the menu, with the exception of lamb because they cook it in flour. With so many options available it was hard to choose. I opted for the Kafta tajine. It was good. Normally you would enjoy the meal with bread, but since that is a no no for me, I just ate the kafta.I will definitely be returning to try other kaftas, but with a side of rice."], ["Deborah B.", "After finally trying this place out, I have one question..Do Kafta Kabobs in Morocco look (and taste) like dog turds too?? So we have lived in downtown Indy for about a year and half. We attempted to come here on a Friday night last summer without reservations, and were told it would be an hour wait. \u00a0We wound up finding somewhere else to eat. Looking back, I think that was divine intervention.  Well, last Friday, we finally (along with a couple of friends who also hadn't been here yet, decided to give it a try). \u00a0We walked in around 6:30 PM. \u00a0A tall, dark man emerged and looked at us as if we were bothering him, practically snarling at us asked \"Do you have a reservation? \"Why Yes, we do!!\" (Learning my lesson from last summer.) So the host/owner /manager is not the friendliest guy in the world, no biggie. \u00a0The food is really why we're here, as we heard and read so much about how great it was. We sit at a table and order a bottle of wine from a small but decent wine list. \u00a0We ordered \u00a0appetizers, The antipasto Plate, which is a sample of hummus, balakoula, cucumber and feta cheese. \u00a0I admit this was good. \u00a0They definitely have the hummus down. \u00a0But for 11 bucks I feel the portions were really tiny, especially for four adults. \u00a0So for main entrees my three dining companions ordered from the Tajines, and I decided to go with The Kafta Kabob. \u00a0I used to get these all the time in Chicago at a place called Reza's and they are delish! The meal is very slowly paced, but that was fine because we were all having a nice time and enjoying the relaxed environment. \u00a0So the Tajines come out in these pretty pots, (Not getting too excited yet, as the vessel is not as important as what it carries). \u00a0Then last, but not least-The Kafta Kabob is placed in front of me. I look down and see what looks like 4 pieces of dog turds laying on a bed of rice, and some oily vegetables. The kabobs were black, and burned! \u00a0Well, I thought, maybe they taste better than they look. \u00a0Not so much. \u00a0I bit into one and despite being dark and crunchy on the outside, the the inside was blood red, and nearly raw. How does a guy that teaches people how to cook do this to ground beef, how do you actually mess that up? I tried the Tajine and it was not bad but nothing to get too excited about, especially at $20 a pop. I was really excited to finally be trying this place and came away really disappointed. Anyone that had that kafta kabob and thinks doesn't know what a real kefta kabob should taste like. Also, what is up with the parking? Make it a little more clear as to whether we can park in that lot, as right when you pull in there are signs that say tow and no parking, but then the waiter said it was fine. \u00a0Huh?? \u00a0Our friends also said they had the same problem.Sorry to all those that rave about it but I am being honest!!! If you must go, just make sure to avoid the kafta kabobs. This is to be filed under crimes against meat. A dark atmosphere (perhaps so you cannot actually see how unappetizing the food is) and the smoke and mirrors of a pretty pot masking mediocre and surprisingly bland food from a place that is supposed to be known for it's spices. I don't have any need to revisit Saffron Cafe and pay good money for pieces of ground beef that manage to be both burnt, crunchy and raw at the same time.. No reason to return."], ["Jerry W.", "I had the couscous with cinnamon and raisin and added honey chicken. It was pretty good but I couldn't finish it as it started to get rather monotonous. My daughter ordered the saffron fetuccini Alfredo which was very bland. The sauce was tasteless. The problem was it had no Parmesan cheese in it, only around the edge of the plate. When she asked the waiter to bring some on the side, plus the addition of some salt, it perked the flavor up substantially. The cheese brought out the saffron flavor.

Wayne Street, greatly overshadowed by the monstrosity of the Soviet-style Minton-Capehart Federal Building, sits the tiny Saffron Cafe. \u00a0The ornately decorated, seemingly out-of-place, little building, elicits curiosity from every worldly passerby. \u00a0When one steps into the restaurant, he would almost feel as if he had been magically transported to the streets of Casa Blanca. \u00a0While the Saffron Cafe diner will not actually visit a Moroccan bazaar on his after-dinner stroll, he will be both gastronomically and culturally fulfilled.During my visit to Saffron Cafe, I was lucky enough to try three different dishes plus a homemade hummus appetizer. \u00a0I suggest that if you dine as a group, you order multiple menu items and share accordingly. \u00a0This way, you can sample many of the diverse dishes Saffron Cafe has to offer.For our main courses, my party shared the Cumin Chicken Tajine, the Lamb Tajine, and the Shawarma (aka \"gyros\"). \u00a0The Shawarma was slightly different than a traditional gyros served in a Greek restaurant. \u00a0The lamb was thickly cut and very well flavored. \u00a0It came with a very spicy chili sauce, which was a nice addition. \u00a0The tajines, which are Moroccan stews, were both excellent. \u00a0They came in large portions, and for the size, were reasonably priced. \u00a0The stewed vegetables that accompanied the meats were flavorful and prepared to perfection.The dishes also came with fresh bread, which was perfect for dipping into the tajines. \u00a0The tajines do not come with saffron rice, and I highly suggest adding a side or two; it is essential.Saffron Cafe is a small restaurant, but in the warmer months, has outdoor seating. \u00a0With this in mind, be sure to make a reservation."], ["Susan F.", "First visit this weekend and can't wait to go back. \u00a0A little pricey but the food is wonderful, especially if you like lamb dishes. \u00a0Skip the baklava (it's not the honeyed Greek version most of us are used to). \u00a0Want to go back again and try some appetizers."], ["Susan F.", "I bought a groupon for the Saffron Cafe.

The decor is what first draws you in, the walls lined with intricate colorful tiles, shelves of tiny Tea pots and every available surface covered in tajines. So what's a tajine? The tajine is the terra cotta hand-glazed dish that many Moroccan recipes are cooked in, with a large deep dish bottom and cone shaped lid. The lid has a small opening at the top, sort of like a chimney, if you will, \u00a0to,release steam during the cooking.It's uber-cool, and each one is different.The food is excellent. Chef Sentissi has meticulously created a menu to that explores the diversity of the Moroccan culture, yet still allows some American comforts - especially if you have a picky child.If you are looking to ease into this menu, then I suggest the Shwarma - juicy meats with plenty of fresh pita served open face, with sides of creamy cucumber yogurt sauce and Harissa. For something more adventurous, then definitely go for the tajine. Lamb, dried apricots and Harissa create a magical flavor explosion and tilapia roasts with a roasted Moroccan pesto is to-die-for. All of the tajines are quite amazing, the flavors multiplying and becoming more intense through their time spent in the tajine.Service is top-notch. Our waiter was eager to please, yet not a stalker. He was knowledgeable about the wine list and which ones worked well with different menu items. A++ for that. Overall, it's a fun experience and the small but packed restaurant was filled with laughter and the ands of people eating well and having a good time. Tip: Make sure to only park where there are meters. Almost everywhere else is private and you will get towed.

If prices would have been less expensive, I would rate 4 stars. We had a Groupon which cost $45, and we paid an additional $30 before tip with tax and upgrades. So bottom line we paid about $75 for dinner. The full price would have been just over $130 before tip {which I would say is very high}. The tab included 2 glasses of wine and 2 beers. Wine is in the $8-10 range per glass and beer is $6.95. I think there are only two beer choices, both at $6.95. \u00a0I ordered the special, which was lamb shank with $36.95 full price. There was an additional $7 charge as an upgrade for the lamb shank. It was very good, but overpriced.

The appetizers were very small portions. The Pilpil appetizer was 3 medium size shrimp and maybe 5 small scallops. Not the large sea scallops but the small bay scallops. The sauce was great, good for dipping with the very good bread.... but the small portion size overpriced at $11.95. The Antipasta appetizer {$10.95} included a sampling of Hummus, Zaalouk, & Bakoula. It was to include feta cheese, olives, tomato, cucumber and artichoke, but I found only one olive and one small piece of cheese along with one small piece of tomato, cucumber and artichoke.

It's not the same as the lounge and eat style, but it's damn good. My bestie and I had gone as a lark around 8pm on a Saturday night not really knowing what to expect. The place was booked. It's a small establishment, beautiful to behold on the outside, and extremely intimate and cozy on the inside. There aren't many tables there, and I was informed by the host that they typically book up completely for Friday and Saturday by Thursday at noon! Obviously, there must be something drawing such a crowd to this place. We had to wait an hour and change, but we killed time effectively and returned at 9:15pm. This is the epitome of a family restaurant. The host was the mother-in-law of the chef. The intimate setting, and friendly atmosphere is reminiscent of being a guest in someones home. Hospitality is the watchword of this restaurant. The lamb kebab was to die for (especially with a bit of harissa (the Sriracha of North Africa)). The lamb tagine was fantastic. Even the falafel were superior to those found elsewhere. The b'stilla was delicious and just as I remember it from my other Moroccan experiences in Los Angeles. When I asked the waiter what was in something, he would call out to the Chef who would rattle off all the ingredients. No secret ingredients here! He seems all too happy to explain and teach about the foods he creates. Let me also state the following... as a baklava aficionado, I'd like to think I've had quite a few varieties and know which country's I prefer. The baklava at Saffron Cafe was hands down, the best I've had in my life. They weren't dense bricks, but light and airy. They weren't drowned in syrup. They were served *piping hot* and what really tied it all together were the sesame seeds inside. Oh, my God. The look on my friend's face when she bit into that baklava was priceless, and I'm sure my own mirrored the same. Transcendent, religious experiences can be found at your neighborhood Saffron Cafe.

I'm sure I'll give this one more try next year, but tonight was concerning."], ["Lisa M.", "A large group of us ate at Saffron this week; they were able to accommodate our reservation, even though the pretty little caf\u00e9 is small (12 or so tables), and we ate without being rushed. \u00a0The best thing about Saffron is the service. \u00a0Our female server was outstanding: \u00a0knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. \u00a0Kudos to her.I'd rate the experience a B- because the food was, as others have said, a bit on the tame side as for spiciness. \u00a0Did not care for the very bland hummus (Athens on 86th St has much better hummus-very garlicky). \u00a0Pita bread was soft and warm. \u00a0But no olive oil or lemon wedges served on the hummus, so I was disappointed. \u00a0The salad and meal plates are HUGE which can be challenging when you have 4 people at such little tables. \u00a0Salad plates were as big as dinner plates. \u00a0But I digress. \u00a0Greek salad was good - too much parsley!!!! \u00a0Needed more feta and black olives.I had the beef/lamb kabob - which was missing the promised onions. I was expecting skewered meat with tomato, green pepper and onion chunks - what I've experienced as a \"kabob\". \u00a0Now to the meat kabob - ground beef & lamb BUT - very unappealing as reviewer Deborah said \"looks like 5 little dog turds on the plate\" \u00a0Ugh. \u00a0Overcooked and dry. \u00a0No sauce. Spices were a bit strong so I couldn't finish. \u00a0Plus it looked really gross.Saffron rice was nice and yellow-y, but no real saffron or spice flavor. \u00a0Broccoli and carrot medley was cooked perfectly crisp tender with nice added flavors.Caution on the harrisa condiment: \u00a0it is HOT! \u00a0made with spices and chipotle peppers. \u00a0Ask for extra yogurt (raita?) to cool spices).They also have soups, which my companions enjoyed - the vegetable (the 1 w/o the cilantro). \u00a0One had a gyro which was just the lamb dumped on a huge open pita and unable to be folded to be a typical gyro as we've had at Athens on 86th.Another had a tagine with some kind of meat kabob, and also egg dumplings. \u00a0They forgot to include the roasted potatoes but quickly brought a large serving. \u00a0They were delicious.Moroccan coffee was outstanding. \u00a0Baklava was a disappointment - not like the gooey, yummy, dripping in honey Greek baklava. \u00a0Dry and crumbly. \u00a0Tiramisu was $8 and skimpy - looked like it was missing a few typical layers - covered heavily in cinnamon.Prices for lunch were reasonable for the experience; dinner prices would have been too high for the food quality.For a first time it was ok - because the caf\u00e9 is very pretty with the colors and d\u00e9cor and the service was outstanding. \u00a0Nice to try Moroccan food but I'll stick with true Greek at either Athens or Parthenon (86th & Ditch), or...India Palace on Lafayette Rd. for my Indian fix."], ["Theresa R.", "We eat and prepare traditional dishes from a lot of various countries, Moroccan no exception. The food was a disappointment. The tajine should have tasted bright with lemons, capers and ginger that our server noted and our experience with tajine's are accustomed to. It was bland however as an American Mid-western Sunday stew. The cooks need a different recipe and technique \u00a0for preparing falafels- worst falafel I've ever had, too salty and dried out, inedible. The orange, avocado olive salad was a success. Drizzled in a nice sauce that complimented each component. The kebobs were a disaster, the driest and chewiest \u00a0I have ever encountered. Our food choices were a rather expensive disappointment for the evening. I would hope the main chef was out of the kitchen that evening as we clearly did not experience the work of finest chefs. The dining experience was lovely- the staff friendly and knowledgeable, helpful and attentive. The interior is vibrant and playful with Moroccan tile work and served from berber's, many of them displayed about the restaurant.

My husband had the lamb kebab, which wasn't quite as wonderful. \u00a0It was tough and overcooked, and the rice was cold. \u00a0But he did say that it was still \"not bad, and not bad enough to complain about it.\" \u00a0He's said as many times as we've been there, that's the closest he's come to a bad meal and it really wasn't bad. \u00a0We didn't order dessert, but the server brought out an enormous piece of chocolate layer cake with mascarpone cheese filling for the table. \u00a0The cake was really awesome, moist and creamy, and we killed it without complaint. \u00a0Last night we finally got to use the Groupon. \u00a0We ordered the antipasto app, which was more than enough for our party of six, and the Bastilla, the phyllo-crusted chicken and nuts appetizer. \u00a0Think sweet and savory. \u00a0For dinner, we both had the Chicken Marsala, half a chicken in an amazing Marsala, onion, and prune sauce, served over saffron rice with broccoli. \u00a0The chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender. Another in our party had the paella, which is a dangerous bet to order in Central Indiana. \u00a0Everyone who tried it agreed it was perfect, and I'll probably order it on my next visit. \u00a0Dessert saw a return of the decadent chocolate cake, a terrific baklava (made in-house, of course), and a lemon version of the cake that also had the mascarpone filling. \u00a0The chef came out to talk to us and explained that all their desserts are made there, by scratch. \u00a0He talked to each of us about what we had, and asked how everything was. \u00a0This is typical from my experiences here (although I didn't see him do it on Friday and am not sure he was there). \u00a0Long story short, this is a great addition to Indy's international food scene. \u00a0It's not big, so make a reservation (especially if you're trying to drop a Groupon on them on a weekend--seriously, don't walk in on a weekend night expecting to be seated right away and then complain about it in a review)."], ["Scot C.", "The place has a really authentic vibe, very Mediterranean and classic. \u00a0 Quick wait staff; even asked if I prefer vegetarian (which I can appreciate, but I did take the Tanjiya...). \u00a0The hummus was okay, the lamb was really good, but for the price you can't go wrong. \u00a0I'm looking forward to getting back soon to try some more!"]], "Mediterrano Cafe": [["Sarah C.", "Dang - why is today the first time I've heard of this place?!

Yep. The owner greeted us, explained the process of paying at the counter before we grabbed a plate, gave us a thorough lunch buffet tour of their offering. Then he let us 2 ravenous beasts loose!

So we started off with a mixed salad w/ crunchy cucumber chips, diced tomatoes, & loads of feta cheese. Got a side of lentil beans to mix in as well. While I'm at it, I got a scoop of tangy lentil soup. Not being completely overstuffed on chowing down plate #1, I managed to get plate #2 - creamy artichoke (a lady's favorite said he), grape leaves stuffed w/ herbed rice, chicken kabob, gyro meat, apricot chicken, falafels, cracked wheat, & a pita bread sliver. Need I name more? Oh, don't forget a small bowl of hummus & yogurt to dunk your food in! Being ravenous beasts as we are, snuck in some coconut cake drenched in rice pudding for dessert at the end. Make sure to shake some cinnamon - Voila!Well...that was an effing good lunch. I like the fact that you pay before you eat - especially if you're on the run. Careful that you don't over-eat and fall asleep in your office chair back at work though. Weekday buffet is $11 and weekend is $13 (probably more specialties).

Well, today, with an extra hour to kill and already in the area, Mediterrano Cafe was the perfect solution.Somewhat expensive for a lunch buffet, we felt it was well worth the price. Hummus was surprisingly smooth, and the tzatziki was cool and full of flavor. The warm pita was a perfect medium for slathering the good stuff onto! The pita is not pocket pita, rather a thicker, softer bread, sometimes called laffa or taboon. We happen to prefer this to the pocket pita as it holds up better and seems to have more flavor. We also enjoyed the tabouli, and my wife particularly liked the onion salad which were complimentary side dishes. The star of the meal for me was the chicken kabobs and the falafel. Kabobs were juicy and well seasoned, and served with onion. A pita with kabob, tzatziki, and the spinach artichoke dish made for a great mouth experience! We also very much appreciated the handmade, but perfectly formed falafal. Not so much ball, more dome shaped, these tasty morsel were large but light. A shmear of hummus on pita with a dome of falafel and you have a heckuva lunch.We dont typically visit buffets, but this would be a regular exception. If only it were closer to home!

Food that was once juicy, tantalizing, flavorful are now watered down, recycled too often/long in the buffet slots and lacks the flavors that once lured me there and had me sending tons of people their way. They used to have the best, creamiest hummus in town--no longer. \u00a0They used to have an eggplant dish that would convert non-eggplant eaters into advocates--that's gone, too. They even replaced the awesome exotic iced tea with one of those crap Lipton machines.

It's a very unique buffet style restaurant that serves Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food. I normally steer clear of buffets, but this one is different. It is the perfect place to go if you've never had this type of food before and you want to try a little bit of everything. I liked almost everything I tried. There were several vegetarian and vegan dishes, and overall, it seemed like you could pick healthier options (if you're into that kind of thing). As for me, I liked the Greek salad and building my own gyros. The pita bread was delicious! A few other Yelpers mentioned the no-frills atmosphere and the non-existent service. I found both of these things to be true, but neither of them bothered me. The inside of the restaurant was very simple, but not an eye-sore or anything.

The salad was fresh and delicious, the babba ganoush, hummus and various hot and cold vegetables were delicious. The gyro meat, schwarma, and the other 2 chicken dishes were lovely. The pita was also good and I did take advantage of the Sirachia sauce to spice things up a bit. My only complaints were the veggie rice (it was terrible minute rice w/underdone frozen veggies) and the fact that the tzaziki sauce could have used more cucumber for my taste.

How can this restaurant have been here for over a decade and we literally just stumbled on it last Saturday on our way to another joint?!? Well, let me just say Indyelpers, if you haven't discovered Mediterrano, you don't know what you're missing! This place has what I think is THE best mediterranean food in town. I know there are several good Greek spots - Santorini, Athens on 86th and such. What sets MC apart, though is that it offers Turkish and Persian morsels as well. We encountered a dinner buffet that *sadly* will no longer be offered beyond this next week. The cafe, like most of us poor souls, is experiencing a decline in business and will only be open for lunch going forward. Hopefully, when the economy turns around - notice I say \"when\" ...ever the optimist! - the owner will re-open for dinner. It would be such a shame to lose Mediterrano's from the evening grazing landscape forever. From gyros and Greek salad to spicy chicken stew, lentils, various kabobs and braised lamb shanks, MC is a true diner's delight. If you're into veggie, you'e in luck as there's plenty of non-meat options. Dishes to try: Eggplant Bademjan, baba ghannouj, cauliflower and pea stew (though not like a stew, more like a saute), spicy chicken stew, the lentils, falafel and what must be the most amazing coconut cake in three states! One of our party kept saying \"I really can't even stand coconut.\" as she plowed through a bowl of this part-cake/part-pudding delicacy. Decor is streamlined and neutral - nothing fancy - but it's the food the makes the real impression here.

Bosphorus seemed like the other option, but this one was nearer to where we were at lunchtime. Upon walking in, we quickly discovered that this is a dinner restaurant. Just from the decor, the (almost annoyingly) low lighting, and the fact that no one else was in there for lunch. The menu had a lot of options on it, and tons of appetizers. When we walked in, we had planned on ordering one or more of these...but upon looking at the prices on the menu, we quickly discovered that appetizers were not going to be an option.The food was good. I had the chicken adana kabob. It was good, but not great...it basically just tasted like chicken. Nothing super special. My mom had kabobs with yogurt...same deal, good but not outstanding. My dad had an eggplant dish with beef on it. Once again, good, but not great. That was the main problem here...everything was good, but nothing was great. (They do have a kick-butt basmati rice. I'd eat that like every day.) We feel like it might have partially been the prices that made us feel the food wasn't great. For what we payed (almost $70 for lunch.. we're \u00a0$30 kinda people) the food just wasn't good enough, and upon further thought, we concluded that the food was a little overpriced for the ingredients, especially in my mom's dish.

Our menu consisted of Tarhana, Lahmacun, Kokorec, Cig Kofte, Patl\u0131can Dolma andImam Bayildi. (say what?) We sampled everything from lamb intestine and grape leaf rolls to tomato-based soup. I was surprised to find that my favorite dish was the Patlican Dolma given that I typically am not a big fan of grape leaves. Tucked inside the mild leaves was a mixture of vegetables and meat with parsley. I was very impressed by Istanbul Cafe's service throughout the evening. A group of 32-35 can be quite difficult to handle, but our drinks were constantly filled and the food kept flowing.

I was assured that this would not have happened if the owner had been on the premises. Cold comfort.Always sad when I have to pan a place with good food for human factors.

I started with the small hummus place. \u00a0Not only was it delicious, but the presentation was impeccably done. \u00a0Without hesitation, it was the loveliest plate of hummus I have ever seen. \u00a0The small plate was large enough for three people, and our server offered to refill the accompanying basket of pita. \u00a0Next time, I'll try the stuffed grape leaves (in Greek, Dolmades). \u00a0For my main course, I had the spicy gyros. \u00a0The meat was well seasoned, tender, and moderately spicy. \u00a0The meat was well complemented by tomatoes, onions, and grilled peppers. \u00a0It was served with paprika-spiced French fries. \u00a0They were a fine Mediterranean twist on an American favorite.The staff at Al-Basha was excellent. They were exceptionally friendly, provided prompt service, and were knowledgable about their offerings. \u00a0Our server, who identified as an American-born Palestinian, was eager to share details of his culture with my brother and me. \u00a0I appreciated that very much. \u00a0The best thing about eating ethnic food is gaining an understanding of the culture from which it comes.I will certainly return to Al-Basha. \u00a0I did make a recommendation to their manager: open the buffet for dinner on a weekend night. \u00a0Other restaurants (particularly Indian) have found this to be a crowd pleaser."], ["Steven M.", "This was the first time at this restaurant so all I wanted was a gyro and fries which I got to go. The gyro and fries platter was $8.50 which, I thought was a little on the high side, but once I got in the car I could smell the fries and I new it was on. \u00a0The restaurant appeared to be very clean, and well put together. I got home and quickly opened the box. Much to my surprise was a box full of fries and a very heavy gyro. I went to devouring the well seasoned fries which were still warm and very good. So for the grand finale I unwrapped the gyro and was very pleased to find a pita FULL of meat. Ate the whole thing in about 1 minute with some Arnold Palmer and now I'm in meat heaven. I would recommend this place based on portion size alone, but the meat was delicious and the fries were top notch.

The salad was dang near bottomless (not in the Olive Garden way--ew, mon dieu), but in an \"I think I just ate an entire garden's worth of Romaine sort of way. The dressing was an oil and lemon juice sort of thing- a smidgy too salty for me, since I hardly use salt, but still, I was dang near licking the plate clean.

Look forward to going back to trying their falafel, baba ganoush and more. Service was a little lackluster, but I think because we were in the transitioning hour between lunch and dinner, and he must have served us as a courtesy, so I'm giving them a pass on that.

This was not where we would normally go for Greek food. \u00a0I had the falafel dinner which came with a Greek salad, plus I ordered a side of Feta and Olives. My dinner had 4 falafel fritters on a bed of lettuce, 2 different hummis, some pickles and olives. One of the hummis was quite good but the other had a strange texture and sweet taste not to my liking. The pickles also had a very strange taste to them. The falafels them selves had a lot of cilantro in them, to the point the were green on the inside. Cilantro was also garnished over everything on the plate. The issue with this is that I do not like cilantro.The side salad was good it actually looked amazing. Taste wise however was good, not as fantastic as it looked. The Feta and Olives was just that plus more of those strange tasting pickles. this was good, I love Feta and black olives.My wife had the Spicy Gyros. She said the meat was quite dry but tasted good and said it was not \"Spicy\". It came with rice which was so dry she would not eat it, and again with cilantro.

Tzatziki sauce drizzled over stewed gyro meat and saffron rice helped to balance the various flavors. \u00a0 The place was busy for the weekday late lunch period, although the non-functioning AC made the dining room a little humid and uncomfortable; hopefully, this will be remedied as the weather warms up. I'd like to go back for dinner to sample a few dishes off the menu, beyond the buffet offerings...especially the mezza platter referenced by other reviewers. It would have been cool to see some falafel on the buffet, but since it tends to dry up quickly, I can understand the exclusion....and I may have just visited on non-falafel day.

Long story short, it's delicious. I absolutely love the spices they put on the chicken. I'm assuming it's Greek seasoning because of the bold flavor and the strong taste of oregano. All of the veggie toppings are really fresh tasting. The tomatoes aren't mushy and the lettuce has a nice crunch to it. Let's not forget the tzatziki sauce. After all what's a gyro without tzatziki sauce? There isn't much to the sauce, but it's a nice compliment to balance out the rest of the flavors. Plenty of feta on top too, finally found a Greek place that doesn't skimp out on that. One thing I don't like about Santorini (and this is just a personal preference) is the interior. It seems to me that they are trying to be elegant and modern, but it just feels like the whole restaurant was set up for a quick catering event or something. Not to mention that the bright white walls and blue lighting sort of gave me a headache. I will say they keep this place pretty much spotless though and the service is beyond excellent.I'll have to try some of the other food items next time, but I have no doubt they will be just as good as the chicken gyro."], ["Laura P.", "Maybe I'm not as a huge of fan of Greek food as I thought but this restaurant was just OK to me.

Considering most of the tables were for large parties, I understood why they wanted to sit us at a small table but right next to the kitchen?Portions are HUGE here. I mean HUGE. I would recommend splitting the meal. I had the fish kebabs and we shared one of there appetizers that had their hummus. Both were just OK.

Next time I want to try the other desserts. The table behind us had some really good looking ones.

Started with the Mezadaki plate and every bit of Greek goodness you can imagine is piled on - feta, olives, hummus, pita, tzaziki, etc.Decided on the chicken gyro for my dinner. I was shocked to find all dinners came with a Greek salad, along with green beans, potatoes, rice and MORE PITA. How could anyone eat all of that? Leftovers for days.In retrospect, probably would either go just for appetizers and dessert or get an entree on its own. Appetizer plus main course was too much for us, and we are big eaters. There is no possible way you could leave Santorini hungry.The falafel was tempting, as was the spanokopita pie - that will be for next time. Obviously, the restaurant was filled with smoke and delicious smells from the Saganaki appetizers everyone but us seemed to be ordering.

It was really good too and so fun to see them light the cheese right at the table. I had the gyro and it came with rice, potatoes and green beans. My husband got the Chef's combo. We took a lot of both home. But I wanted to try some other foods and he shared some of his. I was sad we only got half of a dolmades. Everything else there was plenty of so I almost think it was a mistake. I don't know why you would even cut one in half since they are small to begin with.

I also had a small side salad- again, appropriately dressed with a mild vinegar dressing and piled high with feta and other toppings. They have a nice selection of Greek wine and beer. I had a Keo, which is a pale lager- very light and palatable by any level of beer drinker. My dining partner had a Greek wine, which was also quite delicious.

I loved the fact that the menu noted which items contained wheat and weren't considered gluten free. There was a pretty decent number of items listed on the menu to chose from, but I would caution that the kitchen is shared. Thus, there is a risk for Cross Contamination, which I did happen to experience and sadly quickly realizing after eating my meal, but it is a risk that I knowingly take when I go out to eat.Even though I explained my issue with gluten, there still seemed to be a miss understanding. If you happen to order the hummus gf make sure to ask for cucumbers, and make it clear to not include the Pita bread. Although, this wasn't were the CC occurred. The portions of the food is relatively large. It appeared most people had leftovers that they took with them, and I could only finish a small portion of my meal.

My favorite entree is the gyro with green beans and rice.The lamb mix is always cooked to perfection with a wonderful mix of seasonings on warm pita bread. A warning though, the portion size of any meal is going to be large, so you might want to order a carryout box as well. Desserts are probably the only thing that I would say doesn't stand out for me here, but honestly there is hardly ever room for dessert!On weekends there is usually some form of entertainment, usually belly dancers or live music of some sorts. The owners seem to always be on sight, either tending to the bar or helping staff around the restaurant. They make sure that every guest is having a good time and that the service is good.There is a parking lot next to the building, but it is small and can fill up fast.

Our server Eric was phenomenal - he offered detailed suggestions but was never too invasive and made the overall experience something we'll always remember. First off, order the flaming cheese - the presentation is unique and the creamy consistency is delicious! I also recommend sharing the chef's platter - you get 5 entree samplings and three sides for $21! We split this entree and still had an almost full to go box.

I was greeted by one of the owners, the wife which I didn't realize until later. I understand her husband still works the kitchen in the back. I arrived early and sat at the bar and watched the place completely fill up. My bartenders were fun and I ordered the fish kabob which was really outstanding. A ton of food too but understand that it's not fish served on a kabob. It's more like a fish plate where they cut up huge chunks of fish and throw on a plate with rice and potatoes and vegetables. Really outstanding, would absolutely recommend it. Their potatoes are also really, really amazing. Some of the best lemon potatoes I've ever had. When leaving I talked a bit more to the owner-wife and she's so friendly. Next time I come to GenCon I'll come back here."], ["Regina W.", "The people who run the show over here are smart. How can you not give this place 5 stars when they offer a unique and delicious $8 appetizer that they set on fire in front of you...for FREE as the Yelp Check-In Offer? This flaming appetizer is the saganaki and comes with delicious pita bread. In fact, I think the pita bread is the best I've ever had. Absolutely incredible.For my main lunch dish, I ordered the falafel sandwich which came with a side of your choice. I chose a side salad which came out before my falafel sandwich and was very, very good. My falafel sandwich came out with a beautiful presentation with four falafel patties laid flat on top of a whole pita bread. The falafel was crispy on the outside and moist and flavorful on the inside...really perfect.This place lives up to the high reviews."], ["Bruce E.", "Excellent food, huge portions, nice atmosphere, tasty desserts and after dinner coffees.

You won't be disappointed."], ["Tara F.", "Best Greek food in Circle City/NapTown!I always get the Falafel...it's crunchy, yet wholesome in flavor and texture. With fresh tomatoes, feta cheese and tzaziki sauce, I'm in Athenian heaven, and haven't even touched the main course yet. My sister had her go-to of the Gyros, and I had the Spanokopita, and both made us feel like we left Earth and found food of the Greek Gods! The gyro meat was tender, melt in your mouth goodness, and warm pita bread to match made it one of the best Gyros I've had in a while. My Spanokopita was a warm, flaky pastry that had spinach and feta and 100% goodness in it. Did I mention that dinners also came with lemon potatoes, rice pilaf and green beans that each stood their own ground and were just as delectable as the main entree?? I've also had the Souvlaki in the past and it's fantastic as well!Prices were average for this meal. Don't plan to come here and try to be cheap because the food is well worth it. It's also an extra $1 for more tzaziki sauce, but it was the oh so sweet nectar that I needed to complete the experience. The staff is very friendly, and you can see the owners mingling about with their guests, much like it's a family gathering. There was even a dancer in a beaded outfit and cymbals dancing throughout the restaurant, so that added to the atmosphere.One of the must stop places in Fountain Square!!"], ["Kurt M.", "Stopped here randomly (for lunch) while passing through the city. \u00a0We almost didn't bother, as the dinner menu seemed ridiculously expensive-- but we were happy to find the lunch menu was far more reasonable. \u00a0Price aside however, the food itself was incredibly awesome-- some of the best Greek food I've ever had. \u00a0The staff were friendly and the venue was decent, but this place is all about the food. \u00a0So good."], ["Lois K.", "Did you say fried eggplant? \u00a0Santorini's is awesome! \u00a0Moussaka amazing too. 1st time at this restaurant while visiting Indy.

We have pretty simple tastes, and everything is always cooked perfectly and seasoned just right. The service is what sets Santorini apart. We visited the restaurant early on a Saturday night. It wasn't packed, but it was filling in quickly. We had a large group, and we were served very quickly. Our server was constantly smiling, he had excellent recommendations, and he was extremely accommodating. We had a small child with us who was having a tough time keeping his excitement in check. We were becoming concerned that we were bothering the other patrons, and that's when the owner, Jeanette, popped around the corner. I really thought she was going to ask us to quiet down or leave. Instead, she encouraged us to stick around for the belly dancer, because she thought he would really enjoy it. She absolutely could not have been nicer. I can't say enough good things about Santorini. I wish there were 7 stars."], ["Matt H.", "This was an excellent place to eat! The food is very tasty, great service and the atmosphere was very relaxing, they even had a belly dancer for entertainment!

Everyone seemed enthusiastic about the food, and no one was rushing anyone through courses or out the door. \u00a0 The place was hopping on a Wednesday night; we didn't have trouble getting a table without a reservation, but if you have a big party a reservation might not be a bad idea even on a weeknight!"], ["Leslie H.", "One of the best Greek restaurants in the city!

From the ambience created by the decor and waitstaff to the flavors delivered in the food, this place has it all. Try the grape leaves for an app any day.

I'm glad to say I've been back many times, and that one of our workplace's welcome dinners has been held here several times. It's a testament to Santorini's delicious food, great service, and friendly atmosphere that we have held that dinner there for three years in a row now. We've had their hummus, baba ganoush, dolmades, spanokopita, olive plates, falafel, lentil soup, lamb, fried eggplant, gyro...you name it, we've tried it.

Absolutely. Santorini's is Greek done right. Authentic, delicious, huge plates, casual atmosphere- this is a new favorite of mine. A little off the beaten path, but well worth the exploration.

For the quantity and quality of food, it was well worth the price.The meat quality was high grade and perfectly cooked to order - \u00a0juicy and almost melted in your mouth. Their tzatziki sauce was rich, thick and creamy. It was so thick that I had trouble spooning it out of the container. That was a bit annoying, but it was very tasty.The service was quick and attentive. The restaurant itself is clean with a decent patio for warmer days.

I don't know about you, but I'd rather not waste my calories/money on that kind of dining. Beyond the calories it was just salt and \u00a0lemon overload! that was pretty much all I tasted with my entree. The Greek salad came soggy and wilted, it was made in advance and sat. The potatoes had so much lemon they should just serve a lemon wedge in place of those potato wedges! I ate 3 bites. The green beans mush and complete gush! I ate 4 or 5..I was done.. the rice dry and flavorless with a black olive popped on top. The main feature on my gyroskopio wasn't great. \u00a0It's served on a plate with the juice from the bean so it was soggy pita. The tomatoes were old and dry. The tzatziki was good. We had a variety of food at out table.The spanokopita \u00a0was dry and nothing but phyllo no filling. The souvlaki my friends ordered contained chicken.. we share and taste and it was dry.  Now the finale.. my friends did dessert I did not. But I had some! The baklava was okay my friend had hers heated with ice cream but they went to far with the cinnamon. The baklava heated turned into a gooey paste. The other friend did the limoncello with mascarpone. It would have been good but then they added raspberry white chocolate shavings on top and if that wasn't enough a dusting of powdered sugar! We sat from 6 to 9 chatting and sipping wine, the seating is very uncomfortable for that. \u00a0I ask for a box a couple times, he wouldn't bring it but insisted he would box it for me. I don't particularly like to send my food back by the host to be boxed. I like to box my own! So he boxed it \u00a0I brought it home but I wont eat it. I should have sent it all back to the kitchen so they could see I barely touched it. It cost me 50.00 with the tip and I didn't have dessert. One bathroom one stall for everyone right in the dining area. I peeked in the kitchen it's was tight space, old and dirty.

Like I've said before, baba ganoush is not only Vince Vaughn's nickname in Wedding Crashers, it is a must have starter! Pat got the vegetarian combo, which had about 6 or 7 different items on it. Billy was awesome enough to take him on a tour of the plate. Seriously, what server does that? It was awesome that he cared so much! I got the lamb chops cooked medium rare, and it was baa-baa-beautiful.

You're going to enjoy yourselves.\" She was right! (Side note: this Egyptian family purchased this restaurant from the old owners about a month ago, so in March 2014.)Our food was a special Egyptian menu, and although some of the dishes are available on the regular Greek menu, they may have a slightly different preparation.

Everything else was amazing. I'm not head-over-heels for chicken because it's kinda boring, and usually eggplant grosses me out. I found myself taking second helpings of both the baba ghanoush and the moussaka because the flavors were just amazing! The bone in chicken was so savory and spiced perfectly, and I even took leftovers home (which I had for lunch today) of the boneless chicken. The owner's mother prepared this special meal for us and we were served by the owner, his wife, and a couple other staff members. They were friendly, informative, quick, and eager to answer questions and show off their dishes. Truly one of my most favorite group dinners because it was great all-around. I will definitely be back and I'll probably bring some friends. Oh, and they do deliver with a $2.50 charge, within a certain radius of the restaurant.

I was really impressed with the number of vegitairan and vegan options. My boyfriend got the gyro plate and the greek fries and was impressed with the flavor and the huge portion. \u00a0The service was also excellent. He even brought out a sample of the dolmathes and the Moussaka to try. Wish we would have saved room for baklava. The prices were also very reasonable.

I guess my expectations was warm and pleasing decor with softer lighting. My trip to to the restroom found it dirty with at least 3\" of dirt along the baseboards and entire restroom was needed a thorough cleaning. The overall restaurant needed a fresh coat of paint and a good scrubbing. The duct work above my head was thick with dust and the black ceiling fans were gray with dust. I think I''ve made my point and I didn't even see the kitchen.Service was friendly and fast. I ordered the SPICY gyro and subbed salad for the French fries. The gyro was a decent size for lunch with tender meat and a hint of spice. Rather bland for again what I expected. Waitress offered hot sauce but then I'm just tasting a bottle of hot sauce...not seasonings. The salad was fresh, crisp iceberg lettuce with a slice of tomatoes, 1 blks olive and a few sprinkles of cheese. Good but over dressed in oil.

All had great flavor and it was a terrific amount of food for the price. I ended up taking home the rest of my koshari and rice pudding, \u00a0and some baklava for later.

I ran into trouble when I asked the server to confirm that the tahini sauce was dairy free. Obviously no tzatziki for me, but she eventually told me the tahini was okay. I had a reaction later, so I'm not really sure she asked the cook. I'm pretty sure she didn't get what constitutes dairy since she told me later she could offer a dairy free dessert. Cheesecake. Yeahhhh. If you don't have any allergies or questions, the food is tasty and cheap. I'd grab a spicy gyro here again sans sauce."], ["Krista R.", "Ate here recently with family. Two of us had gyro plates -- highly recommended. Another had chicken shawarma -- he loved it! We all started with the lentil soup and hummus/pita. Everything was good. Side Greek salads were tangy and fresh. Great sauces with the entrees, too.Only thing we didn't care for: the lights are BRIGHT. I would have loved a more intimate, romantic feel to the place. But the walls are bold and the lights harsh. I guess it IS in a strip mall...In summary, Parthenon has a simple menu. The food tasted fresh and delicious, and everything was a reasonable price.

I also had a chicken dish that was tasty (but sparse on veggies, aside from the side of green beans that came with it), and it was enjoyable. My husband had a kebab, which he thought was strange didnt come with rice, but liked nonetheless. The entrees came with tasty Greek salads, \u00a0but if you dont like a lot of dressing ask for it on the side because they really drown it. It was clean, plenty of seating and a nice atmosphere.

That is not to say Santorini is terrible, it just falls short. I've had all of the appetizers, the lamb, tilapia, and two kinds of gyro. For me, I think the food here lacks the robust flavor of the Mediterranean. The interior doesn't give the open airy feel of summer overlooking an ocean, or an intimate setting gazing in the eyes of an exotic fisherman...it's cramped darkened space doesn't allow you to dive into your imagination of Greece. It may be borderline cozy on a good day, and just sardine packed on any other. I will give it to them, through some hard times they have held on.

Shockingly, it was not. \u00a0We opted for indoor seating, but their patio looked like a pleasant place to have a meal as well.Service was great. We started with an appetizer of saganaki...because you can't go wrong with oozy cheese on fire. Opa! The pita that was served with the saganaki was delicious & fresh with the perfect level of chew.My husband had the gyros dinner and it was more food than he could eat. \u00a0I tried a piece of the gyro meat, and it was great. \u00a0It wasn't dried out & it had great flavor. \u00a0I had an appetizer of the Spanakotiropita & the Avgolemono soup as my dinner (I didn't want all the sides that came with the dinner option, plus I have a pesky bell pepper & tomato allergy). The Avgolemono soup was some of the best I have ever had. \u00a0The orzo was a bit too mushy for my taste, but the flavor profile was perfection. The Spanakotiropita Were Outstanding. \u00a0It was also a huge portion, and I ended up having 2 pieces to bring back home. \u00a0They reheated in the oven perfectly, and were outstanding served with the brunch I made us the next day. \u00a0I had also requested a side of feta to eat with my dinner, but it never came. That was a bummer, but I was stuffed, so it wasn't a huge deal (we did notify the server & had it scrubbed from our bill though). \u00a0The food was served with a hot, crusty loaf of bread...which was good, but TOTALLY unnecessary. Next time, and there WILL be a next time, my goal would be to not overly stuff myself like I did on our first visit. \u00a0I really wanted to try the Baklava.The only downside is that while I think the \"belly dancing\" aspect is a fun touch...it was TOO MUCH on the night we were there. \u00a0They pump up the music really loudly during the dance. \u00a0But if it goes on for more than one song...it's just too much. \u00a0It's impossible to have a conversation during the dances. Fine for one song, awkward for more than 1 song. \u00a0It was really bad on the night we were there, because the dancer knew a big family that was sitting at a table by us. \u00a0After her 2-song dance, she brought out extra castanets to the plethora of kids sitting at the table (who had been done with their meal for more than 20 minutes, but the parents were visiting with staff), so they could try using them. That's a cute idea in theory, for a couple of minutes...but over 10 minutes of children banging tiny cymbals without rhyme, reason, or rhythm...it brings out my angry side. \u00a0That would be a great activity for OUTSIDE the restaurant...not inside to the detriment of other diners' ears. \u00a0But, if you don't mind Club-Music-sound-levels & cacophonous mayhem...then indoor dining will be right up your alley. \u00a0I left with a pleasantly full belly...but a rip-roaring headache from the castanets.

The Merlot was nice and light, not overpowering.Throughout each course, the owners came over and visited with us, providing a very welcoming and personal atmosphere. \u00a0Service was excellent, and I noticed that it wasn't just our table, but an overall attentiveness to all patrons. \u00a0My kabobs arrived, packing every inch of my skewer with perfectly grilled and marinated chicken, onions, and peppers and were served on a bed of rice with Greek potatoes, green beans Olympian and a side of Tzaziki. \u00a0Two kabobs were more than enough, and my feelings weren't hurt having to enjoy more of it later. \u00a0Jon shared a bite of his cod, a juicy flavorful dish, the size of his forearm...but I had to save room for dessert. \u00a0Whatever you do, DO NOT pass on dessert! The baklava was good, and yes, the Galactobouriko (phyllo pastry with homemade custard and smothered in light syrup) was even better, but you have to try the Homemade Rizogalo, mama fofos rice pudding. \u00a0Don't be fooled, this custard like dessert with an innocent dash of cinnamon will make you wanna kiss the cook. \u00a0I'm looking forward to visiting again soon, perhaps even before the wine event next month."], ["B K.", "Super legit Greek food.

The restaurant is small and cute. I enjoy the intimacy of the space. I love that this is a family run business. You can definitely feel the love in that place. The servers are also excellent!The food on its own, without comparison is good. But it (overall) just does not hold up to Santorini. We have been going to Greek Islands for years and just recently visited Santorini. It blew Greek Islands out of the water in every regard. The Saganaki was better and over double the portion size. The salad and bread and significantly better. \u00a0The gyros at Santorini were served in a pita (as expected) and the meat was much juicer and less dry than at Greek Islands. The green beans and potatoes were also more succulent and flavorful. And oh my god, the baklava. It's much more juicy and flavorful at Santorini. It was no contest. Santorini slayed Greek Islands with each food item we ordered. I love, love, love the service and people at Greek Islands. I will still go there if I need to get Greek closer to downtown. But otherwise I'm making the extra drive to Santorini from now on. At the end of the day, the food itself is number one when choosing a restaurant. I hope that Greek Islands can covertly take a field trip to Santorini and spy to see what I mean. I would love to see them improve their food to be on par with Santorini because I do think Greek Islands has a better atmosphere."], ["Michael C.", "We found this place from 4square while on a trip to Indy. Very close to downtown. Huge portions, and very friendly staff. They do a little fire show when you order one of the cheese appetizers and that inevitably grabs the attention of all patrons. The kids menu is typical greek and the main menu is extensive. One bit of advice. Don't order a greek salad as an entree. Get the a main dish instead, as the side greek salad that comes on the sides of the platters are GIANT.If I was a local I'd eat here often.

The servers had a couple of large groups in since it was a Sunday afternoon. But they tag teamed us to be certain we had everything we wanted. We had an appetizer plate and I enjoyed every bit of it.

I am not sure I have ever had melitzanosalata but I defintely prefer it over baba ghanoush and I really like baba ghanoush.

Once an old butcher shop, Greek Islands, has been transformed into a cozy locally owned and operated authentic Greek restaurant. \u00a0One of the biggest pluses is that they have a separate Gluten Free menu and the staff went to extra lengths to make sure there was as little chance of cross contamination as possible.As with any restaurants, you have to have one of their popular dishes, and the Saganaki was it. Plus, it provided a mini show. \u00a0The Chicken Souvlaki was good. It was almost two much food. The Gyros and the lamb chops looked excellent. I only wish that they didn't have flour and I could enjoy the taste of the dishes.I would recommend making reservations on Saturday night. This isn't your large chain restaurant, so they don't have as many tables as say a Bob Even's.

Crispy and tart with lemon and ouzo. Cut a piece and wrap in pita. Don't forget to schmear in the drippings on the plate. Avgolemono? Yep.

On the Southside of the Circle in Indy, you'll find the loud and crazy yet simultaneously warm, cozy and comfortably cramped Greek Islands. Once you step over the threshold and into the restaurant, you become part of the family.Although we'd been to Greek Islands before - and loved it - the atmosphere of the wine dinner was fitting for us. Family-style seating, with a group of 15-20 other folks, including cousins, employees, miscellaneous relatives and some foodie-types, this dinner was quite the experience. \u00a0We left in an amazing mood, smiling and not worried in the slightest about the possibility of a hangover on a Tuesday morning. And because there was so much food tasted with the wine, that outcome was practically impossible. From bubbly to bubbly, from soup to salad to shish kabob, I felt perfectly at home.Each course was paired precisely with Greek Islands' food offerings, woody Chardonnay with lemony soup, South American reds with grilled chicken and meat pies.The chef wrapped up the meal with a trio of petite phyllo sweets, filled with mint, cherry and chocolate. \u00a0You can't just get up and walk out the door, either. A tight, full-bodied hug from Angela S. seals the deal, making sure you know you aren't some stranger, and you are welcome in their \"home\" anytime.

I was so expecting to be wowed with Greek food and I was just not. All the great reviews that I made my husband drive across town for...disappointed and underwhelmed. \u00a0I will say that the service was very good by our waiter and I loved that the owner was sitting out front on the patio. Let me start by saying that I have had all of these dishes before, the flaming cheese, the Greek soup, the hummus, etc but at the Greek Islands they were all just Meh. Best flaming cheese is Pegasus in Chicago, best Greek soup is Pegasus Taverna in Greektown Detriot, and best hummus is Burning Bush Grille in Louisville. Now don't get me wrong, I was not expecting this place to beat them all out but I was seriously thinking I would get a good mix! The soup was not edible. Both of us tried spoonfulls and left it alone - that bad. The hummus - a mediteranian staple, tasted like ground chickpeas. Exactly like ground chickpeas. I didn't get the flavor of garlic, lemon, tahini, cumin, etc. The tzatziki was ok but very plain yogurty - not much cucumber. Hubby had the gyro plate and said it was fine. The one thing we both thought was really good and saved this review along with the great service \u00a0was the Taramosalata. So I don't know what happened the night we went but it was definitely not 5 star food by any stretch. (And I am not taking off for the women's restroom being out of order and having to use the men's and then having to take the top off to flush the (dirty from the employee who just walked out prior to my going in!) toilet because of the broken chain.

It's really awesome to see people's reactions to it!2) Whatever the salmon dish is called, get it. So flavorful!3) If the belly dancer asks you to dance with her, do it and take photos. 4) Don't forget dessert, a little piece of baklava is the literal \"cherry on top\" for the big awesome meal you've just devoured.

Surprisingly, though skeptical to order it at first, I enjoyed their chicken orzo soup with just a hint of lemon quite a bit. That I can probably eat regularly.

You can definitely tell that everyone works very hard and enjoys what they do. The food was absolutely fantastic. We ordered the saganaki as an appetizer. The saganaki was tangy and delicious. For dinner I had the chicken souvlaki and my fiancee had the pork souvlaki. Both dishes were excellent. My chicken really was out of this world. The seasoning was spot on and the chicken was very tender. Both entrees came with a Greek salad, green beans, rice, tzatziki sauce, and potatoes. There was more than enough and we were able to take some home to enjoy later. I would absolutely recommend this restaurant!

This is pure comfort food. No counting calories here. You're dining with the Greeks now. You're too skinny! Eat!My attempt to broaden the husband's limited food spectrum landed us here for our date night. All I had to say was \"they have lamb\", and he was in. He made reservations, and we arrived to a lovely, low-lit dining room with murals of Athens on the walls. Festive theme with a comfortable atmosphere. Suitable for a romantic meal or a group of friends. Service was great, everything ran quite smooth. Our waitress was very polite and answered all of our questions about the menu.The seating is well organized, with the group tables in the middle with the intimate ones on the walls. This is helpful when you don't want to be in the middle of someone else's party. There is also a full bar, complete with ouzo. (Hint, hint) Rob started with some calamari and fakes soup, and I started with some spanakopita and avgolemeno soup. We couldn't stop saying how much we loved our starters - fresh calamari (not rubbery at all), and the spanakopita was fluffy, flaky goodness. We loved the soups! Rob ordered the rack of lamb for his entree, and I decided on some dolmades. The lamb was juicy, tender, and had quite a bit of meat. My dolmades were good, but maybe a bit too much olive oil on the vegetables. I'm more of a steamed veggie person, so I wasn't crazy about the green beans and potatoes being drenched in oil and butter. I finished my dinner with a sweet Greek coffee. A perfect end to a fulfilling meal. Happy tummies all around!I would agree with other reviews that the prices are way too high. I understand that it's a small business and all, but it's difficult for us commoners to drop a Benjamin on a meal for two. *cough, cough* Other than that, our experience was lovely.

The four EXTREMELY SMALL (size of my pinky finger) dolmades were very lightly topped with what appeared to be curdled, not-very-appetizing-looking avgolameno sauce. We decided to try it before sending it back and it tasted fine, so we carried on. The portions of potato and rice had shrunk considerably since last year, and the price of the dish had increased ($17.99). The only portion that was pretty close to what we had been used to was the green beans. Our total bill (including two iced teas) without tip was $55.00.

The lamb burger was on special, so we definitely ordered that! And we also split the Gyro Piato and the Mousaka plate... all three were complete authenic bliss! SOOOO GOOOD. All came with a side Greek salad, a mix of rice pilaf, greek potatoes, and green beans as well. Needless to say we took some home and left more than fully satisfied, and it was all worth it!

The greek salad was one of the best I've ever had, perfect amount of dressing, herbs and feta, it's a must have when you visit.I was in the mood for gyros so I got the platter (not the sandwich) which was perfectly prepared - the meat was hot with the edged slightly charred just how I like it, the green beans were tender and seasoned nicely, their potatoes were slightly bland but I ate them with a little of the Tzatziki sauce and that fixed them up to my liking.Portions are generous the decor was authentic (what I could tell in the dim light), our server was attentive and friendly.

The wedge had several different types of lettuce, chicken, blue cheese.. all baked on the crunchy flatbread. I didn't know what to think of warm lettuce at first, but it grew on me so much that I ate all three of my generous sized pieces.My entree was killer. In fact, I'm eating the leftover of it right now. I rarely order pasta at a restaurant, and even more rarely do I order pasta with meat sauce, but it just sounded good last night. And I'm definitely glad I did. It honestly tastes just like the Spaghetti Bolognese I ate while in Bologna, Italy. Very fresh. Not too heavy. Not too much sauce.. honestly, just great!The service did leave something to be desired. \u00a0Not to be mean, but our waitress seemed to lack some professionalism that I would expect in a restaurant like Mediterra. \u00a0Also, for most of our dinner, we were the only ones in the restaurant.

There's metered street parking right in front, so if you head there during a slightly off hours time, you can get a great parking spot :)There were children playing inside, which off the bat tells me this is a family-owned restaurant. Good. Seating consists of booth seats across the back wall with tables and chairs on the other side. We sat at the raised platform, next to the tv with salsa videos running constantly. The music is dope. \u00a0You'll have fun. Our server was friendly and we got the hummus as an appetizer. Since this place is billed as Dominican/Middle Eastern, we thought that was interesting. The ME aspects consist of hummus, tabouli, and a gyro (so it is rather minimum). The hummus: grade B. It's solid, with a thick consistency. But it's not exceedingly special. For a gal who grew up near Dearborn, I have yet to find great hummus in Indy. The pita bread was warned (yay!) but just one circular piece of regular pita you purchase at the supermarket. And it was not enough for the hummus; unbeknown to us the extra pita we requested was $.75. For $6 this is a rip-off, given the quantity and quality. I know I'm perhaps spoiled by great hummus and pita from where I'm from but...Luckily the main dishes - both Dominican - are hella good. Stick with this part of the menu.Me: Mofongo with chicken and a side salad. Every entree gets a salad and side but not Mofongo (cause it's a lot). I still got an order of the fried plantains. This? AMAZING. A PARTY IN MY MOUTH. I had Mofongo in the PR and loved it. This was great. Amazing. Scrumptious. The chicken in the side dish is cooked on the bones in a succulent (seriously) sauce. The salad is meh - lettuce, onions, and 3 cucumbers, but who cares about that. MOFONGOALL THE WAY. \u00a0Him: goat in a sauce that he says tastes better than my chicken and Mofongo. Side of beans and rice, which were awesome. The side of fried plantains were great. If you've never had them before, think of potato chips. They come with what seems like a mayo-based sauce.

It's located just east of the Central Library in downtown Indy, just a few blocks from where I work. It is a somewhat unique combination of Dominican and Greek food. The ambiance inside is nice with soft merengue music playing in the background. The favorite dish of most of my coworkers is the Yaroa, otherwise known as loaded Caribbean fries. I honestly don't know what is on these, but they are SO GOOD and incredibly addicting. My best guess is chicken, fries, and some delicious mystery sauce. You can order a small order and share it with many people. The only sad thing is that they can't come as a side. However, many of my coworkers will simply get an order of the small loaded fries as the entire lunch meal. I love the Gyros and the Falafel for the main entrees. The fries that come as a side are still delicious, though not to the degree of the loaded fries. The service has always been good and friendly, though there are usually not many other people in there when we come in. We are usually in and out within 45 minutes, which works well for a lunch break. It seems like there are some regulars that come in pretty frequently. The last thing that helps everything out is that the food is actually very reasonably priced. Most of the dishes are less than $8, which is great for the quality of food.All this to say, it's one of our favorite lunch spots at work and a great little place with a lot of culture and flavor!

I asked what was the closest thing to that and she recommended the pollo y sal (sorry for butchering the Spanish). After about 15 minutes the food came out as I was enjoying the sun. Wow! \u00a0What a lot of food! \u00a0Basically it was almost a whole chicken in a red sauce that looked spicy. I got this and a mountain of white rice and red beans all for $10. My mouth was watering, my blood pressure was rising to dig in. Unfortunately it stopped there, for all the great looks it really didn't deliver, the chicken was tender but not flavorful, and didn't taste like it had any salt. The red beans and rice were good, and the rice was well cooked and seasoned. But the chicken--oh for as good as it looked it just wasn't there for me. After the meal the owner came out to ask how I liked it, which was a nice touch. Maybe I just got the wrong thing.

Having traveled to the Dominican Republic, I have been searching for a place that serves authentic Dominican food and this is it! I ordered the tamarind juice, shared sides of cheese empanadas and fried plantains, and had the gyro for my main course (not Dominican, but I'm a sucker for a good gyro). Everything I tried was delicious and authentic. I would definitely return for a snack of guava juice and fried plantains. My friends ordered the chicken dishes and enjoyed them although as the Dominicans do, they had to eat around the bones. My review is only 4 stars because the service was a little slow (which I feel bad saying because our waitress was really sweet) and the interior leaves something to be desired."], ["Arnaldo R.", "As a transplanted Puerto Rican residing in Indianapolis, I was extemely excited when I found this place. \u00a0Their mofongo is better than many I've had in the island. \u00a0They have just the right amount of garlic and pork rind to give the mofongo its traditional flavor and texture. \u00a0I used to have to wait until I traveled to PR to have authentic mofongo, but now I can drive a few minutes to downtown Indy and have some that will rival the best I've ever had.

We were both adventurous and were curious what \"Dominican/Middle Eastern\" entails...Unfortunately, it took FOREVER to figure that out. Was worried after the reviews that service would be slow, and it was. Food was amazing-- get the stewed Dominican chicken or goat with fried plantains or red beans/rice.But it seemed like both servers working outside forgot about both tables [ours included]. Almost 10 minutes until someone said hi/came out to get our drink order;10 minutes to come back with drinks/take our food order; 20 minutes for food;15 minutes to get our check; 10 minutes to receive our cards & checks back. I'll come back, but it has to be once their service improves."], ["Brittany L.", "The empanadas were SOOOO amazing! I tried both the chicken and the cheese ones and they were fresh, crispy, delicious. The stewed chicken was ok. Tender, decent flavor, but I'm not a big fan of gnawing chicken off the bone. The rice & peas were very dry and lacked flavor. The salad (which I do not ever eat) was very fresh with lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber and a simple but tasty dressing on the side. I drizzled a little dressing on the rice side so it wasn't so dry. However, the lunch special of stewed chicken, rice & peas, and salad was under $5 so I can't fault it too much for it not being perfect. The menu has both Greek (shwarma, gyros, baklava) and Dominican (empanadas, stewed goat and chicken, flan) choices. The server was really nice and apologetic about my wait but she was also very slow. I found out later it was like her 2nd-3rd day. The patio is well-shaded in the middle of the day and with the breeze I really enjoyed sitting out there. It took 15 minutes to get a glass of water. My food took 47 minutes. That's completely unacceptable. There were 6-7 tables, when I first sat down there were only 4 (2 couples outside, 4 guys together inside plus one other 2-top). The story from the server was \"the kitchen got backed up\". The restaurant was well under capacity and no one else seemed to have trouble getting their food. A hispanic couple sat down about 45 minutes after I did and got their drinks within 3-4 minutes of sitting down and their food came out about 5-10 minutes after mine did. Why is all of this down-to-the-minute? I had to feed the meter! I was very aware of time because I'd set the timer on my phone so I wouldn't get a ticket. The part that really ruined the experience for me was the people who seemed to have ownership of the place: a younger latino man and woman. The man came around, delivered food, refilled drinks, and checked on all the other tables on the patio TWICE but didn't talk to me a single time. The woman had walked in around 12:30-12:45 wearing a little backpack and had stopped to chat (in Spanish) with the couple who came in 45 minutes after I did. When I went inside to ask for a box, then went inside AGAIN to ask for a check, this woman was apologizing to a man, saying \"Sorry to keep you waiting...this is my brand new server.\" If you have a brand new server, why would you roll into your restaurant that late in the day? Leaving her to fend for herself for at least an hour? She never apologized to me for my wait, and didn't say a single word to me. Didn't ask how the food was or anything else. I left glad that I'd experienced the fantastic empanadas but really wishing I had gone to Datsa Pizza instead...I think I would've eaten in half the time and saved myself at least $1.50 in meter charges."], ["Brittany S.", "The upside:-Some of the best darn falafel I've ever had - to boot, the sandwich was only $5.95.

Panorama has been open for a while but last night was the first time I had stopped by. The decor is nice, and the chairs at the low tables over by the wall are a dream. So comfy!They recently started serving Domenican food as well as the traditional Gyros and falafel, and they really knock it out of the park. We got the appetizer platter (falafel, baba ganoush, hummus, dolmades, and pita) and everything was delicious. We shared the goat stew, which was ample portions of spicy and flavorful goat with your choice of side (rice and peas, rice and beans, or plantains). From the time that we ordered to food hitting the table was under 10 minutes, so no complaints on service.I don't know if this has always been the case, but they also serve beer and have an outdoor patio for when the weather warms up. The owner came and chatted with us about how they make their food, which was a really nice addition to the whole experience.They have sandwiches for around 5 bucks and big entrees for 10-15 dollars, so I would say that this is way better value and more interesting cuisine than what Saffron offers.Oh! And to celebrate rolling out their expanded menu they're offering 25% off all their menu items next week (April 29-May 4).

Not a very good experience overall."], ["Catherine K.", "Not wanting to fight the long lines to get into the Pride Festival right after the parade ended, we decided to head home. On the way, we saw that the Panorama Grill was open. Located in the former location of Urban Element, I was excited to see a restaurant in our area actually open for lunch on the weekend! Bonus that I love Middle Eastern food.The menu is small but covers the basics; I ordered a chicken shwarama with garlic sauce. I was pretty much on the edge of my seat to get the food because I have a long-standing love affair with garlic sauce. I can eat it by the truckload. Problem is, I haven't been able to find a good version of it here, at least not what I am used to having from growing up in Metro Detroit. I was a bit disappointed when my shwarama arrived -- the pita didn't look or taste housemade and I couldn't see any garlic sauce. Sad Panda.But, my fiance saved the day! Having ordered the shwarma entree, he got a side of garlic sauce. And -- get this -- HE HATES GARLIC! \u00a0I dipped a piece of chicken into the sauce and MMMMMM. Yes! Finally! Success!When the waitress came out, I told her how excited I was over the garlic sauce. When I told her of the restaurant I used to go to in Dearborn, Michigan, my street cred instantly increased. She knew I knew my sauces. :) She brought me extra and even told the owner how excited I was, lol. A few quibbles: Service was enthusiastic yet scattered. The restaurant has only been open for 3 weeks but the servers were all at least in their 30s, so I don't think inexperience was the issue. Fries were extra with my shwarma -- had I known they were $1.95, I would have passed. As I said, the pita, although not stale, definitely didn't taste fresh. The restaurant I'm used to makes them on site and serves them as soon as you sit down. The restaurant was pretty busy, which was nice to see, I'm sure partly due to the number of people downtown. They are open for lunch and dinner 7 days and a week and have a small deck with 3 tables for outdoor seating. I'm guessing a shwarma or gyro from here will become part of my weekly routine -- along with a soup bowl full of garlic sauce!"], ["Michael S.", "Restaurant is under new ownership.

When we walked in, it felt like we were walking into one of those weird dreams you have after you drink too much and nothing makes sense. Our waitress was super super nice and super sweet but it seemed like she may have been new to the service industry. The TV's were on there was no music. They also didn't have any high chairs or booster seats. I can understand if you have only one, but none is kind of outrageous. Luckily the chairs they do have are big so we could both hold our babies and eat.We both ordered Falafel and it was fine. Nothing striking but it tasted fine and was warm. The menu has dichotomy but 'm sure that will eventually work itself out.While we were there a few other people came in & one table of 2 gentlemen ordered a pot of tea. They mentioned to the waitress at her second table visit that they had a meeting to go so they would just have the tea. She came back a 3 rd time without the tea asking if they wanted any coffee cake or any other menu item and they did not. After about 10 minutes had gone by without the tea, they had to leave. I think the place has potential, after all people want to eat lunch and that area is dying for more food options. They could use a highchair or two, some nice ambient music and a service trainer.

First of all, let me say that I have been wanting to do Spanish karaoke for some time, but the only places I've been able to find so far have only Mexican music, which I'm not familiar with so I can't sing. This place had a good mix of baladas, merengue, bachata, salsa, even reggaeton! The husband-wife team that runs the karaoke really know how to get the party started and are wonderful singers. As for the food, they have a Dominican menu and a Mediterranean menu. I haven't seen Dominican food in Indianapolis before, so I was very excited about having a Caribbean Hispanic option for food finally! My boyfriend and I shared the Yaroa, which is french fries with ketchup, mayo, shredded chicken, and cheese. The waitress said it's a new dish that was invented in the DR within the past 5 years or so. We also shared the Stewed Chicken, which was very flavorful. I got it with a small salad and mangu (you pick sides). Mangu is basically boiled green plantains topped with red pickled onions. I was curious about how to make it and the waitress actually told me step by step how to make it! The waitress was extremely friendly, funny, and helpful--such a sweetheart! Honestly I have never had a better waitress in Indianapolis. We tried the moriso\u00f1ando (Spanish for \"to die dreaming\") to drink per the waitress' recommendation and it was basically like a liquid creamsicle. Very good! Also, the interior is very nice. There are chandeliers and pictures from around the world on the walls as well as some Moroccan-looking decorations. All in all, food and service were above and beyond. And the prices can't be beat! We went back a couple of weekends ago when I saw that they have dancing on Saturdays. We really enjoyed the mixture of merengue and bachata since a lot of the Latin dance places in Indy don't play enough merengue for our taste. We ordered some beers and the waiter was helpful and informative this time as well. He told us about a special event (happened last Saturday) for Dominican Mother's Day with a special menu and music, but unfortunately we weren't able to make it.

Flash forward to a few weeks ago, and I was roaming during the day, trying to eat somewhere I hadn't been in a while and stopped in here. I walk in and there's a group of guys at the hookah, staring at me. I stopped at the hostess station, stood there for a while, and went to go sit on the couch while waiting. I sat for around 15 minutes, while the guys kept looking, and when one of the guys went into the kitchen and came back out (and still, no one spoke to me) I finally got up and left. I dunno if it was because it was the 'special' hookah, or maybe I looked nutty, always a possibility, but it was unnerving. I don't foresee myself going back anytime soon, and that's too bad, because I truly liked their food here."], ["Alex K.", "I feel I should like this place more. I love Mediterranean food. The place is in the proper spot for great food. They have a lunch buffet. All the stars are aligned but the quality of the food didn't do it for me.

I've only been once so it could've just been an off day but, with my list of favorite spots to go and other spots to try, a bad first impression can kill a place for me.

If you go at lunch, you can try the fresh, amply stocked buffet, with everything from baba ghanouge (roasted eggplant puree with tahini), to lentil soup, to various rice dishes with nuts and meat. And a lot more. The gyro meat is flavored to perfection, thought it's not always on the buffet. Call ahead. And the pita is properly moist, not dry like at many places.

Jeannie-aficianados may well remember feeling at home in the erstwhile El Morocco on 86th street, but since that has gone away a very lovely stand-in is the Cairo Cafe. About a year ago, the back room was actually a mini grocery store selling Turkish Delight, hummus, olives and such, but the owners had a more lavish plan in mind. What smart folks. Replete with white lights and floor pillows the color of persimmons and pomegranates, the place couldn't be more welcoming.I really go there for the buffet, though, whose selection is almost overwhelming. The green beans lubi - green beans languishing in a bath of fiery tomato sauce - couldn't be more perfect for a palate in need of a pick me up, and the hummus is heavy on the tahini, making it much more nutty than most I've tried. The salad is simplistic, though gorgeous, with lots of onions, tomatoes, parsley, garlic and lemon juice punctuated by the tiniest bit of olive oil. The kofte kabobs are small, fat and crunchy, just how I like 'em, and they deliver with a rich, smoky flavor.Every time I'm in Indy, I make a wish to eat here.

Oh well, I thought, and proceeded to plow through a few plates of Middle Eastern/ Mediterranean grub. First of all, turn up the heat under those buffet trays, please! Most of the dishes were lukewarm. Regardless, the food was decent. I liked pretty much everything on the buffet especially the chicken dish, the green beans, and the meatballs. It just sucked that it seemed like these were likely leftovers from the day prior. I bet this stuff is amazing straight out of the kitchen. The hummus and baba ganoush were really good. I could eat that stuff all day. The buffet comes with a soft drink, but it comes in a can. That fine, its just a bit weird drinking a soda out of a can in a restaurant. The service was fine. The place is a bit dark and dingy. It kind of feels like an old basement with the stained ceiling tiles and old looking couches.

But she repeated the same thing again and told us that it takes about 15 mins to make the kabob and that they were to busy. They were literally serving 3 people between two tables and she claimed that they were busy! They had a full hour left before closing time! She offered the veggie platter instead.

This is terrible infinity. Don't insult your tastebuds or intelligence by going here and believing this is Middle Eastern food because you're being lied to. I grew up with great Persian food because my (crazy) friend was originally from Iran. She cooked the best food and brought me to some great places in Indy. I moved away and found some amazing places in the east coast that were as authentic as her Iranian/Persian cooking. My goodness----this doesn't even keep up to par with what it's truly all about in the Iranian culture regarding the masterpiece of Middle Eastern food. Your first guess something is wrong here is that you walk into this place and see covered silver buffet containers from lunch. Um....that's what Indians do isn't it? Um, okay...I decided to keep going and maybe it won't be that bad. After all, it had an ad out front saying it was the best. Now I know that ad must have been fake. Simply, this was Indian food disguised as Persian food. I've never had a ground beef kebob with no flavor other than hot chilis dumped on rice like a huge glob of salsa. Bizarre...AND wrong!! True Persian food doesn't spice up their food in a manner that makes your mouth burn. On the drive home I could smell the Indian hot spices and knew this would probably annoy me enough to write this review, so here I am. In the store though, after I ordered I started to wonder if this was a fake Middle Eastern place when I looked around and saw lots of decorations saying 'Himalayan' this and that, Nepal, cheap Indian prints on the wall, Tibetan decor, as well as.....Indian decorations!!! Ganesh isn't really big in Iran since it's a Muslim country. Hence, these were northern Indians lying to customers they were serving Middle Eastern food. This is NOT authentic Middle Eastern food, not by a longshot! And essentially, they're doing it ALL wrong. Only in Indiana where people are incredibly geographically moronic would a place like this not immediately go out of business. Where's the sumac spice which tastes like lemon that you sprinkle on the rice? Where were the roasted tomatoes that were supposed to be alongside the rice? The bread was garbage (room temperature), nothing more than pita bread you pick up at the grocery store versus something that should be made there, in the store by hand. Terrible! There was no option to choose salad instead of all of the carbs on carbs (rice with grocery store pita bread!). What about diabetics for godsakes?! The rice was a joke. I think it was just regular white rice, not Basmati, and definitely not Jasmine rice. Where was the Saffron on the Jasmine rice? NOWHERE! \u00a0On top of that, the cucumber yogurt sauce was terrible---even my cat wouldn't eat it and he loves dairy products. That makes me think this wasn't fresh (obviously) and it probably was right out of a bottle full of preservatives. Never ever ever will I go back here again. \u00a0I'm still going to keep looking because this place was a joke. I don't like being lied to, nor do I like being conned.

Their bakhlava is the cherry on the cake, perfect is the word for it! I really look forward to return soon. The owners are very kind and sweet. This is the place where if you are a regular, you will be appreciated! Way to go kabab corner!!"], ["Amanda C.", "Great little find outside the castleton mall.

We tried the lamb and ground beef kabobs and they were great! Definitely want to come back and try more!"], ["Sabbir O.", "Afghani, Turkish, Desi food you name it I ate it. This place was one of the worst \"Halal\" restaurant I ate at. All the food was microwaved also saw the waiter bring the food from the microwave whom I questioned immediately if the food was microwaved but got a response \"all our food is fresh.\" If you're from the Middle East or South Asia and expect this place to give you quality halal food please be prepared to be disappointed."], ["Amy S.", "Yuuuuuuummmmm! So glad I was at a training down the street with some adventurous foodie friends! This place is friendly, affordable, and authentic. Everyone really liked their dishes. There were beef kabobs, chicken kabobs, a veggie n paneer kabob, momos \u00a0(veggie dumplings) and I had something I couldn't pronounce but involved lamb in a tomato based sauce over rice. I'm a suckere for basmati rice and lamb anything! Mine was flavorful no heat do I added the hot sauce/chili paste stuff, I loved it. I also had a chance to try the paneer n veggie kabob. Awesome seasoning along with a great grill flavor. Not too much and I'm talking about lighter fluid flavor.I was told the chicken n beef kabobs were moist with great seasoning as well. The momos were good looking with brightly colored stuffing, meaning the veggies weren't mutilated:) I will definately go back. The place is in a strip mall across the parking lot from the AMC theater and simply decorated. I love low overhead! I get leary if a place looks all razzle dazzle, like what are you trying hide or compensate for??? You should definately try it!!!"], ["Ryan B.", "I will be back for dinner tomorrow.

I want to have it at my wedding, my kids birthdays, my dogs funerals, my family reunions and anything else that requires really awesome food.The interior is a little shabby but clean.Like I've said before, I recommend sitting down and and waiting for the food to be fresh over the buffet.They have bottles of pop that are kind of overpriced- maybe bring your own bottle. I highly recommend trying the lamb kabob and baklava. Soooooooo good."], ["Ed S.", "Himalaya Kabob Korner is located in a small shopping center on the south edge of Castleton Square Mall. While it might not look like much from the outside, it was well worth the trip.After reading their reviews here on Yelp yesterday evening, I decided on the spur of the moment to check the place out. As usual, I went the carryout route and brought home the Lamb Kabobs (which came with basmati rice, pita bread, and yogurt sauce). They aren't the kind of kabobs that are served on a stick, but instead were presented as a half dozen good-sized chunks of very tasty meat.I also had a side salad, which came with what appeared to be Italian dressing (no choice was offered). and a small Manto appetizer (steamed dumplings stuffed with ground turkey and onion). As the name implies, the menu consists of Himalayan/Nepalese cuisine, but there are also items that you would find in any Indian restaurant.Overall, the service was friendly and prompt and I enjoyed my dinner from HKK. I would definitely like to return to try some of their other menu items."], ["Mustafa A.", "I have experienced better, the portions and food presentation could use some attention."], ["Robert M.", "I am always on the lookout for new dining experiences and love trying food from around the world. \u00a0Kabob Corner stays true to the Himalayan cuisine and does a good job explaining the food and spices. \u00a0A good experience overall."], ["AJ A.", "This is a great small restaurant with excellent food.

We went for dinner and had the chicken kabob plate, the turkey manto and a delicious Nepali bean soup, but will come back to try the buffet as well."], ["Nikhil P.", "Wow.. Amazing.. No second doubts for ones who know the taste of Momos in India and are dying to get that taste.. Best part, It's right in front of AMC Castleton!!"], ["Graham T.", "Nice lil place with pretty authentic Indian / Nepali cuisine. I know cause I'm Indian. Definitely great value for money and pretty decent variety. The lady also gave us a complimentary piece of Baklava after the meal."], ["Chelsea P.", "What a find! This place is a fantastic, little hole in the wall place. The dining area inside is much smaller than what I would expected, but the food was amazing.We came on a Friday afternoon and they had a buffet going on. This was some of the best food I've ever had. I had never had Nepalese or Himalayan food before, but because of this place, I'll go looking for it. Everything I tried on the buffet was delicious. I especially loved the eggplant, the thinly cut chicken, and the *warm and fresh* baklava was a great ending to the meal.(Also, even though the restaurant used disposable plates and cups for buffet serving, they recycle everything!)I'm from Indiana originally and live out of state now, but there is no way I'll be making a trip to Indy without a visit to this restaurant ever again!"], ["Katherine P.", "Went for buffet (mon, wed, fri) and had a delicious lunch. Lots of options including grilled and stewed meats, several veggies, warm pita and delicious sauces. Will definitely be back.

It is the real deal and very authentic."], ["Sarah S.", "My first time trying Nepalese food! I decided to go with the Tibetan style Chicken Mono. I received a plate full of dumplings accompanied by a delicious tomato chutney. I liked the chutney so much I needed seconds! They have a nice big water dispenser, and I drink a lot of water so that was nice. The owners were sweet and conversational. The decor is simple and I loved the Tibetan prayer flags and masks on the wall. Minus one star because of the styrofoam plates which cheapen the look of their delicious food, and are not good for the environment!"], ["Aditya B.", "Lovely authentic Kebabs. The chicken kebabs were very good. The chicken momos were delicious. The best dish is an Indian rice dish called Biryani (the chicken biryani is one of the best in town). The yogurt that they serve with the dishes is yummy.Baklava actually is better than most middle-eastern restaurants. The owners are very courteous people.This small family owned restaurant is overall outstanding!"], ["Natalia C.", "Casual and unassuming store front and environment. My expectations weren't too high, but the food definitely exceed any expectations I had. Good prices, friendly people and yummy food! Definitely recommend the steak kabob!! Juicy and delicious."], ["Sara H.", "We have been here many times and the food has always been fantastic. We have been here twice now since it's been under the new owners (Russian lady and gentleman) and they are so rude. The white-haired Russian man who is always dressed like he rolled out of bed does the cooking, and he did the cooking under the old management, so the food has remained very good. The first time we came, the Russian lady was pleasant enough except she started complaining about customers who come in a half hour before closing, and how people who did that would \"only get take out\". She said, \"We close at 9pm, we shouldn't have to stay.\" She just volunteered this information. We thought that was pretty rude and unprofessional. We came back today for the lunch buffet (which by the way, they increased from $9.99/person to $11.99/person) at about 11:30am. We pulled up and all the lights were off, except the open sign. We walked in to a dark business with no one at the counter, no one in the restaurant, and covered containers on the buffet. Finally the Russian gentleman walked out and stared at us, so we asked if they were indeed open. He rudely said,\"Is the open sign on?\" Yes....\"Well then we are open. If the signs on, we're open!\" Like we were the biggest morons on the planet. My boyfriend said well all your lights are off and no one's in here soooo..... And he just stared at us. We almost walked out and we should have. The food was indeed good, but we were so offended that we won't go back. These people act like they don't want customers to come in! Must be why they are always dead now. Its really too bad, the previous owners were lovely and the food is great, unique to Indy, and these people will run this place into the ground. Also, who wants to pay $13 (thats after tax) for a tiny selection of food on styrofoam plates, where you serve yourself for everything?"], ["Rebeck B.", "We are so glad we tried this little jewel. We will definitely come back. I had the chicken kabob. The chicken was juicy and spiced just right. The rice with tomato sauce was delicious. Such a simple meal, very filling, very yummy.

The eggplant, baklava and the customer service make this place a 4-star! Very nice."], ["Joey G.", "This is the best place to eat in Castleton. I always have friendly service and great food. They use super high quality meats and the food is always great tasting and fresh. If you have not tried this place check it out and get the Lamb Kabobs."], ["Leora H.", "Delicious food. Started with mo mo for appetizer and had lamb kebabs with basmati rice. We all liked our meals. Fresh, tender meat, and very friendly owners. The only downfall is the place needs better decor. The atmosphere was a bit lacking."], ["Chris H.", "I wanted to try something different in Indy. \u00a0 The reviews were accurate. \u00a0The food was freshly prepared and very flavorful. \u00a0We went during mid-afternoon so it took a while to make our orders but it was worth the wait."], ["Stacy P.", "After visiting Castleton over the years, I was amazed to find that this place actually existed. \u00a0Located in the small strip mall behind Long John Silver's, you'll find Himalya Kabob Korner. The simple, yet purposeful d\u00e9cor somehow suits this location. I mean when it really comes down to it who really cares what the inside of the restaurant looks like, as long you get a good meal.The menu is really simple, but at the same time they have a lot of options to choose from, especially for those who have never tried this type of food before. Hey, there are even pictures on the wall and they are very friendly and will help you if you have any questions. \u00a0Like most restaurants, there is no gluten free menu; however, you can pretty much get most items on the menu, with the exception of the lamb, bread, and baklava. I opted for the top sirloin kabob which came with basmati rice, pita bread, and yogurt sauce, but sadly sans pita bread. \u00a0The meal was filling and light at the same time. The kabob was well cooked and not dry. \u00a0The one thing to possibly wary about if you have a Gluten allergy is cross contamination. Like many restaurants, it is a share cooking area, thus there is a possibility of CC."], ["Anna L.", "I saw the round red Yelpy sticker on the door of Kabob Korner, so it's Yelp-approved! Stopped in at an off-peak hour (4:15ish pm) on Saturday. Glanced in and a couple was finishing up their meal. We made our way up to the counter and looked at the picture descriptions & menu board. The friendly owner suggested some popular dishes such as manto, quabili pallow, & kabob platters. This is good that he actually enunciated everything out because I'd probably make a fool of myself mispronouncing.We got hummus as a starter. He had the lamb kabob and I got the manto (steamed dumplings w/ seasoned rice). Food arrived promptly - hummus was creamy w/ a dash of EVOO & lemon juice. Served with warm, quartered pita bread. The manto was pretty good (bf said it was like ravioli w/ tomato sauce). You'll definitely get the turmeric after-taste if you burp though. (Sorry for not being lady-like.) I tried a chunk of the lamb kabob and it was cooked to medium perfection - still pinkish in the middle, juicy, and tender. There's also this awesome homemade chili sauce in a tupperware by the self-serve utensil/ice water table.Honestly I could care less about the dining atmosphere as long as it's good and I've got a place to seat myself to eat. They do play background music to make it more inviting vs. awkward silence. I'd like to see them be a tad-bit more environmentally friendly - out with the styrofoam! Other than that, I'd be happy to return to try out the lunch buffet and order something new on the menu."], ["Tamara Q.", "Amazing blend of Nepalese flavors that is an amalgamation of northern Indian, Tibetan, and Chinese. Try the Momos-- they are like little dumplings. Will definitely be back!"], ["Avani D.", "Been there for the first time last week. We really liked their paneer kabob, sambosas and veggie momo. One of the rare places around with authentic taste. Would definitely visit again."], ["Kirstin P.", "Good, solid food for the price. The decor and atmosphere are more diner-esque than romantic dinner but it's in a strip mall type-area so one really can't complain. Unfortunately, the chef who cooks the Nepalese dishes was out, but we got kabobs and they were fantastic. \u00a0The lamb was definitely better than the beef, though, and I'll learn my lesson for next time. All in all, solid, well seasoned and filling food for a quick bite or casual meal."], ["Kevin K.", "Very fun experience! \u00a0Got to experience something I've never had before, which is Himalayan food...as geography majors could imagine it's similar to Indian but not quite. \u00a0It is, however, delicious!I had the manto, which are steamed dumplings filled with spiced turkey. \u00a0Not incredibly spicy but very tasty. \u00a0Served with yellow rice that had a nice red sauce.Simple location and decor but incredibly clean and friendly and prompt service. \u00a0I'm glad I went and look forward to coming back!"], ["Cory M.", "Excellent food.. Very easy and fast and filling.. Very tasty experience, will return."], ["Shannon Q.", "I trusted the other reviewers and stopped off here on our way to Chicago. We were immediately greeted by a very nice lady. She gave us some suggestions and we ended up getting the chicken kabob with our free baklava after checking in on yelp. I felt like we were in someone's home or on a real Himalayan picnic when we were served on plastic plates with plastic utensils. It was an intimate dining experience and really felt more authentic than if we had been served on ceramic plates or something. The food was simple but had great flavor and the baklava was sweet and satisfying. If we are in the area again we'd definitely stop in and enjoy another authentic picnic."], ["Tiffany M.", "This is my favorite restaurant! You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but my favorites are the ground beef kabobs, spinach and the manto. The cardamom iced tea is wonderful and the baklava is the best I've ever had. Ask for the cumin rice instead of white rice with your meal. Also, don't miss the lunch buffet on Monday, Wednesday & Friday. Great way to try everything and get the chicken gyro which is only available for lunch! The tzaziki sauce is also incredible!"], ["Anastasia W.", "Great food. Wonderful flavors.

This was #2, although after eating here I can say it must be very close to #1. The food was excellent. I got the lunch buffet and ate a little bit of everything. Some of the items had so much flavor it was unbelievable. The owners were also very friendly- constantly bringing out fresh food. I highly recommend eating here."], ["Andrea Y.", "I was completely underwhelmed. Had lamb kabobs & truly, no interesting flavor and tough.

Wanted to love it, but will not return."], ["Dianne T.", "The owners are very nice. I've even seen them start a large order at closing time. The food is amazing. I've ordered the kabobs only but it's always so good and filling that I don't have room to order anything else"], ["Pam-Boom C.", "The place might look like some random restaurant you just drive by, but don't let that fool you. Don't hesitate to give Kabob Korner a try. Their food don't disappoint. I tried the Lamb Kabob, Manto (dumpling) and Baklava (dessert). The lamb was cooked very well. It was cooked just right so the meat is tender and juicy. The Manto has a unique taste to it. I especially like the Baklava. I don't know what Baklavas are made of, but I sure know it's a must-order dessert."], ["Praneet L.", "Kabobs, Manto, Chicken and vegetarian momos here are awesome! I went to Nepal 6 months ago and appreciate this place even more because of how their food tastes exactly like the food from their home country. It is a family run place and everyone there cares about what you think of their food and often come by your table asking for your feedback. Definitely check it out."], ["Jelly R.", "We went here for dinner on a weeknight, after reading all of the positive Yelp reviews. \u00a0We walked in, and were greeted immediately, and the woman who worked there (possibly the owner?) was happy to answer questions about the menu and make recommendations. I ordered the Quabili Pallow with lamb, my husband got the top Sirloin Kabob, and we shared the Sambosa Veggie. The food arrived relatively quickly. The veggie samosas were very flavorful, with potatoes and delicious spices dominating the inside of soft, flaky phyllo dough, served with some sort of chutney-type sauce on the side. The Quabili Pallow was also good: it was a heaping plate of flavored basmati rice, tender chunks of boneless lamb, almonds slices, raisins, and a tangy tomato sauce. My husband, a picky eater, enjoyed the sirloin kabob (which came with white basmati rice, two pita pockets, and a side of sauce).One recommendation for the owners would be to do a little bit more decorating. In all honesty, prior to reading the favorable Yelp reviews, I'd driven by this place many times but hesitated to go in because it seemed too sparse and fly-by-night, and I was afraid the food would be much of the same. I think that even just adding some table cloths (you could even put a piece of glass over them so they wouldn't constantly be getting dirty), painting the walls a darker color, and having less fluorescent-type lighting would make a huge difference and would make the place seem more cozy and inviting. Either way, I highly recommend this place, and we plan to come back sometime for the lunch buffet."], ["Kate D.", "So we almost didn't go in... Boy would that have been a mistake. It was around 7 on \u00a0a Friday and the place was empty. I even double checked to make sure I we pulled up to the right place. After double checking, we figured to follow the other good reviews and just go in. It was AMAZING! We ordered the Kwati soup. Full of earthy beans and spices, it really was an authentic soup taste that I have never even tasted before. I had the sirloin kabob. The spice marinade was spot on, and \u00a0it was tender. I even saved a chunk my dogs in the car, and they acted as if it was one of the best things I'd ever held in my hand. The basmati rice rice was cooked perfectly and the red sauce was a nice flavor, not to tomato-y. My husband had the lamb kabob. Perfectly cooked, tender and well seasoned. When we have guests in town that want good lamb, this is where I would take them.I also took the baklava to go. It has that very buttery and flakey home made taste. Which really makes stand out from traditional store bought stuff you might normally find.I can't wait to go back, I wish I didn't live 45 min away, because I would hit this place up for lunch all the time if I only lived closer!"], ["Krista R.", "Afghani foods, Nepali foods. Both delicious. Both, I believe, geographically and culturally unique from each other. Why this restaurant serves both is not for me to understand, but rather for me to eat and enjoy. (Apparently a Nepali family recently bought \"Kabob Korner\" from the same restauranteur who previously owned another Afghan restaurant in NW Indy). The food: we sampled manto and beef kabob. The manto was FABULOUS. Steamed dumplings of turkey and spices coated with delicious sauces sat on a plate with some excellently flavored basmati rice. So, so good. The beef kabob was flavorful, the pita bread was acceptable if a little uninspired, and again the dish featured some great rice.Next time I'll get momos -- I had my share of some fabulous momos in Darjeeling, India as many of the restaurants and hotels are owened by Nepali people. Fingers crossed that HKK's momos taste as good as they looked.$8.99 lunch buffet also available."], ["Ryan C.", "First time visit and would highly recommend. \u00a0We had the chicken and lab kabobs with the special bean soup. \u00a0Everything was cooked perfectly and the seasoning was just right. \u00a0If you are looking for a change from the norm give this a try."], ["Jennifer M.", "This was nice find in a mass sea of north westside eateries. Had lamb kabobs, hummus, chix momo, paneer - it was a family sharing event. Very good food. The decor isn't anything fancy and it's in a strip mall but looks are deceiving. The lamb was cooked perfectly and my daughter loved the dumplings. We will go back!"], ["Jemmie W.", "The food was just ok for me.I found the meat dry. I think part of the problem is that kabobs, by their very nature of being cut up pieces, have a higher surface area to volume ratio, which means they necessarily are not as juicy as larger pieces when *grilled*. Imagine if you grilled, say, ground beef - you would have pretty dried beef. The ground beef can be juicy when cooked in its own juices (e.g., taco beef) but will be very dry if just grilled.That's part of the reason I have never really liked kabobs. But I was \"forced\" to go by some co-workers for lunch.The owner is very friendly and engaging with the customers, which is a positive. If you like kabobs, this place is for you."], ["Hannah C.", "Kind people and undeniably delicious food. So glad we found this little hole in the wall!

The food here is what's important. There are many choices from Kabobs to Sambosas to a vegetarian platter. All of it is delicious. They also have a lunch buffet on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. I guess the only disappointment is they only sell soda by the bottle and outrageous prices. Just try water, it's better for you anyway."], ["Rohit A.", "Food is ok but service is terrible and they lack ethics, if you order 5 items, you get only 4 and if you ask the missing item ,they will charge you again.Update: I visit different restaurants all over US very often.I won't make a review just to malign the business.

We pretty much always get their gyro sandwich, doesn't come with a side but you don't need one! It is huge and tasty and their tzatziki sauce is delicious!

They were huge and moist and very tasty. Had enough for lunch the next day. Only sour note, our wines were $8 each and we had two apiece. That was half our bill.

However, the wait time was an hour. No problem - there were other choices of restaurants like Red Lobster. But the the wait times were just as bad there and a couple other places we tried. Then we noticed the Mediterranean Grill across the street in a strip mall, and it didn't appear to be so crazy busy like the chain restaurants. Indeed, we were able to walk in and be seated immediately.The inside of the restaurant was definitely not long on atmosphere. There really wasn't much of an atmosphere other than it was a room with tables in it. The servers were attired in blue jeans and whatever; charitably I would call the atmosphere casual.The menu offers a number of mostly Greek choices priced at around $15. It was a bit of a struggle for my vegetarian daughter to find something, but she eventually settled on their vegetarian plate (duh!), which consisted of some felafel, hummus and on some some spanokopita. It was all okay, nothing special. I settled on Hoosa upon the recommendation of our server. I am quite sure that if I simmered some cut up chicken breast in a can of tomatoes and added some spice I could make something very close to Hoosa. When eating out, I like to find something that makes me wonder how in the world to make something so good. So while the Hoosa tasted okay, it was nothing special. To get real nitpicky, the kalamata olive in my accompanying salad was not as plump and nice as those found in a jar of olives in a supermarket. Come on, a Greek restaurant ought to have good olives!Overall, average food in a somewhat dreary setting accounts for why this restaurant was not busy while nearby restaurants were crammed."], ["Kristin S.", "My son had a school project and we choose to go to the Mediterranean Grill, the waitress was awesome with helping him gather what he needed for his project.

Whoa - the entrees are at $18. However, sandwiches are $9-$10, and that's reasonable enough so we went for it. Had to laugh when the host seated us far away from other folks - it's not a dressy establishment, but we were really underdressed compared to other folks' classy casual wear. The decor is very nice with living room type chairs and a ceiling painted as the sky. It was nice to sit by the window and view the canal.The water is fancy - comes in a name brand glass water bottle that they set at your table. Ordered the hummus. It's got texture and is light on the lemon and garlic. It's good! But I prefer the creamy Lebanese version we got back in the Dearborn area, with lots of lemon and garlic. However I loved the fact that the pita bread is served warmed!! We also got oil and spiced for the pita bread as well. For $7, it's way overpriced (hummus costs little to make when done so in large quantities). The amount, however, was more than enough for my roommate and I. I just miss living in a densely Arabic populated area where you get a quart of hummus for $5. Alas! Regardless, within Indy restaurants this prices was about reasonable. My friend got the Kibe as a meal, even though it is an appetizer. Sirloin with ground beef, onions, barley, etc - it's very good. The tzaitiki was loved by my friend, but very different from the heavily cucumber taste that I'm used to. I got the Kafta Kabob (Lamb) and it was served in a pita. Quite good! Sadly I was already full from the appetizer so I only ate a bit. The meat was very good and I'd recommend the sandwich.The server got the job done, but not especially friendly. That's fine, however, because as long as I have what I need, I don't care if they're bubbly.Why only four stars and not five? There is no need to have Mediterranean entrees at $18.

I'd highly recommend the lamb kabobs, as they're seasoned and cooked to perfection. I had the lamb kafta and it was good, but nowhere near as good as the lamb kabobs. The accompaniments with the meal (feta, olives, pickles, lettuce) are fresh, and the rice is prepared wonderfully (not too overwhelmingly flavored). We also loved their standard side salad that comes with entrees - it's just fresh lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers with a vinaigrette, however, the vegetables are juicy and taste like they were picked that day, and the vinaigrette is so light that you don't mind it's not served on the side.I'd recommend the mango juice if you're looking for a refreshing, not-too-sweet non-alcoholic beverage. We finished our meal with some ouzo, and it was wonderful, too.The atmosphere is very nice, but if you're going to sit outside, don't bother going for the side with the canal - there's not really much of a view other than some screaming ducks, a dirty canal and the occasional homeless person walking by.

Now, I'm not saying it's a \"healthy\" salad, but there are vegetables so...that counts for something, right? The delicious, deep fried falafel patties are where I start getting in trouble. But they are so, so good and not your typical falafels either. These ones are made with leeks, and in place of the more common garbanzo beans, they use fava beans instead. Perfectly spiced, perfectly crispy fava bean patties atop crisp lettuce, fresh tomatoes and cucumbers, and pickled red onions, you really can't go wrong. I personally like to customize the salad a bit by swapping the dressing for their spicy tahini instead. Prices are reasonable and the ambiance is great-especially in the warmer months when you can sit out their patio which overlooks the canal-but service can be a bit slow at times, especially at lunchtime when they seem to have only one server working."], ["Jane S.", "Went for the first time and was not very impressed.

I took a little sneak peak into the main dining area inside and it was also very well decorated and is a very comfortable place to sit, eat, and chat. The ambiance was a winner for me all the way!I was really excited about the food but sadly everything I ordered fell short for me. The highlight of my entire meal was the fresh grilled pita bread and oil and dip that they provide for everyone at the beginning of the meal. Next favorite would be the side salad that came with my entree, lol. I ordered the mussels appetizer and the lamb shank entree. The mussels were way overcooked. The tomato sauce it was in helped me knock those babies down but otherwise, I was almost considering sending it back but again, I was enjoying the ambiance of the patio seating which made me happy. My main entree was a nicely cooked lamb shank but it had absolutely no flavor other than lamb. I love ordering lamb at restaurants because it had such great natural flavor that can hold its own against other strong flavorful seasonings and sauces. Sadly, this place made the lamb shank taste mild. I ended up using the sauce from my overcooked mussels on my lamb to give it more flavor :(My other friends got the Gyro sandwich which looked really good and the fries were super crispy and amazing. My other friend ordered the sampler appetizer and loved it. I'm thinking I need to give this place another shot and this time order one of the sandwiches."], ["Phi C.", "Decided to go out for a late dinner and a friend of mine suggested we come to canal. First off... The only Greek dish that I enjoy is the gyro sandwich/plate. So usually I avoid eating out at Greek restaurants since I limit myself only to he gyro. I of course order the gyro sandwich with the garlic and feta fries and that was amazing. The meat was very flavorful and the cucumber sauce was perfect. The fries were pretty good as well. We started our meal off with hummus and calamari. And both were good, not the best I've had.. But decent enough to come back. Service was friendly, however our food took some time to come out.

I'm glad we did because we both loved our meal here. We started with a couple appetizers: the goat cheese bruschetta and the opah dish which is a tableside flaming cheese plate. We didn't really care for the goat cheese bruschetta but we loved the opah. I also loved the spiced oil they gave you to dip the pita bread in. For my entree I ordered the lamb and beef gyro. It was pretty good and a large portion. The fries it came with were great. It seems every Mediterranean place has great fries. My wife had the lamb burger and said it was also pretty solid. For her fries she got them with the goat cheese on top. I could hardly keep my hands off of them. This meal hit the spot but as most Mediterranean places are, this definitely isn't a low carb/light meal. Lot of pita and cheese.

Of course they bring out pita bread and oil with herbs which is great but don't have too much or you'll get full. ;-)My entree is normally the Shawarma sandwich and with the fries with garlic and feta (which is an extra price).

The plate was huge and he was very happy that there were a lot of mushrooms, which is his favorite veggie. I always end up getting the calamari salad as an entree. One day I will try something else, but the salad is so yummy I always end up ordering it! There are a ton of calamari on the salad and the salad has cucumbers in it, which I love. I also like to get a side of red potatoes with my salad. So good. They have decent daily drink specials, and their cocktail list is pretty good. My drinks have always been made strong and tasty.

As it got dark outside, the lights would turn on, giving it a nice dim lighting inside the restaurant.

He also gave us a deal to get 4 enormous plates of appetizers, so that we could try them all, and only charged us for the special lunch price apiece. This allowed everyone to try four different appetizers instead of just one. Five of six diners ordered Doner (gyro meat) while I had the chicken kebab.

The dining area is a comfortable size and inviting, as it is clear that you're in a converted house, which preserves a good deal of the cultural authenticity one may expect from such a place.- FOOD/DRINKS: This place unexpectedly shines. \u00a0The menu, while a bit expensive for some, falls within the $$-$$$ range for entre\u00e9s and presents Turkish cuisine that will blow you away. \u00a0My beliefs were that food from this region would not be a flavorful or spiced as others around the world; boy was I wrong. \u00a0THIS FOOD IS DELICIOUS. \u00a0Their lamb chops were extraordinarily tender and cooked and seasoned to perfection. \u00a0I would position these higher than some of the best steaks I've ever had. \u00a0Though they bring out a basket of warmed pita bread prior to your meal, I wasn't quite sure how to eat it since it didn't come with any dipping sauces or oils. \u00a0Color me confused. \u00a0The other dish I tried was made with chicken and spinach topped with a spiced yogurt. \u00a0It was heavenly. \u00a0The only complaint I would have is that I wish the serving sizes were bigger (but that's the American in me talking).- SERVICE: This is the area that could improve, thus 4 stars and not 5. \u00a0Admittedly, part of the slight issue I found here was a small language barrier, which is largely uncontrollable. \u00a0The other half of this issue is controllable and they could be much more attentive to tables during a diner's experience. \u00a0- OVERALL: Bosphorus is an outstanding place to eat if or even if not you're craving something out of the norm. \u00a0It's just very good and should become an international food spot added to your mental list of places to eat. \u00a0Do it."], ["Jessica B.", "Stopped by for some appetizers.

We ordered some type of larger sampler dish to share that way we could try a few different things. It came with a few different meats, veggies, and rice. Everything was fine, but not great. Some of the meats were dry, the rice was boring, and the veggies were pretty good.I didn't really care for the ambiance. It was really quiet, with Turkish music in the background. There weren't too many tables around, and I felt like the wait staff hovered so close that it was hard to have good conversation.I think this would be a good restaurant for someone that is not terribly adventurous with food, but still wants to try something different.

Quite the contrast from our waitress who was a woman of very few words. Well, onto the food. I had the chicken kebab and my sister had the vegetarian guvec. My dish was good overall but some bites were moist and others dry. I sampled some of hers and thought it was flavorful. She remarked it was a bit on the greasy side but it didn't stop her from finishing her dish. Pleased there were at least four or so vegetarian entrees for her to choose from.

Effes is one of my faves, but the Turkish red wine REALLY won us over. Just fantastic.We then ordered some apps, which were the stand by for me in Borek, and also the Feta cheese plate. Both were delicious. The Borek has kind of gotten a bit smaller thru the years, but that's US economy for ya. Still, very tasty.After we were done chillin' and appin, we ordered dinner.I had the Adana kabob, and she had the Lamb Mediterranean. Both were freaking phenomenal. The spices they use in the kabob, combined with the beef and the lamb just are amazing. The Lamb dish combined with the vegetables was perfect as well. No desert, but we opted for the obligatory Turkish coffee. Who woulda thought a Turkish joint has good coffee??? Sarcasm at it's finest, trust me this Turkish is second only to mine. Just perfect!

The appetizer combo comes with the wonderful hummus, baba ghanoush, stuffed grape leaves, yogurt sauce, pita, and more, and you can supplement it with an order of calamari, falafel or house salad. \u00a0If ordering an entr\u00e9e, I recommend the adana kebab, which is grilled patties made from ground lamb and beef. The adana patties are typically moist, well-seasoned (a tad spicy), and come with a small salad & rice pilaf. \u00a0I'd like to try out some of the vegetarian entrees, but cannot seem to stop chasing the hummus dragon.I especially advise visiting during lunch hours, where the prices are fantastic and your meal includes one (1) choice of appetizer along with the entr\u00e9e. \u00a0You can experiment, mixing and matching menu items, until you find your ideal duo.Service each visit has been adequate so far. \u00a0The restaurant is beautifully painted inside and outside. \u00a0I prefer eating on the flower-covered patio if the weather is nice. \u00a0The only odd thing is that this beautiful building is plunked right in the middle of not-so-beautiful surroundings, and the traffic on East St. can distract from the overall experience when sitting outside."], ["John Z.", "The first think I thought when I walked through the door: \"Why is it so g*******d hot in here?\" I mean, it was about 70 outside, but around 80 inside.

The pita that was served with the hummus and babaganoush was addicting - I probably could have eaten the whole basket on my own.I got the chicken kebab which came with a good amount of chicken (kind of like the Turkish version of fajitas), rice, a side salad with a vinaigrette and cooked vegetables (green beans, carrots, squash/zucchini). I loved every bit - definitely cleaned my plate! My friends got the doner (gyro meat) plate which came with the same sides and the beef Mediterranean (very much like the chicken kebab but covered in a tomato-y sauce with vegetables in the sauce, thus no vegetables on the side). Both of them liked their dishes a lot as well!By the time we finished (around 12:45), the place had cleared out. Seems like people eat there a little bit earlier, or they definitely did that day! By that time, we were the only table and the owner came and talked to us. I was given a \"prize\" of an almond for finishing my meal first, although my companions were also given almonds later. I finished the meal with the baklava (two pieces, warm, with whipped cream) which was incredibly delicious. I am going to have to resist the urge to stop by and get some on the way home from work now!Overall, loved the food, loved the owners. They were so friendly and the food was incredibly delicious.

Tucked away in the corner of a strip mall, you wouldn't expect the clean, simple and modern decor. The space almost feels a little too big.. Maybe a few more wall decorations would help? The tables are elevated and huge, decorated with symbols and surrounded by padded benches. Very cool space, just needs a bit of lighting adjustment.. Fluorescent lights don't do the place justice. Anyway, when you first look at the menu, it seems a bit overwhelming. The guy at the counter was happy to explain everything, as he asked if we had ever been there. There are three sections of the menu. First, various dishes with varying spices and meats. They had things like biryani, eggplant masala, and nihari (a deliciously tender piece of beef in curry sauce). You can choose between different combos, some with rice and chapati, just rice, choose two, etc. The next part of the menu is all skewers of meat. They had lamb, chicken (tikka masala), beef, and goat. We didn't opt for any of these, but next time i'll definitely give it a try. The last section was various Chaats (described as Pakistani street food). They had tangy, spicy and a few others (all were vegetarian!).We opted for the Aloo Chaat. This was one of the best things I have ever eaten. It was almost like a thin yogurt soup, served not quite chilled. It contained spices, seasoned potatoes, chickpeas, onion, cilantro and topped with crackers. It was the PERFECT combination of spiced, creamy, crunchy, salty and tangy. I could eat this everyday. We also decided to try two things from the first menu with some rice and chapati, and ordered an extra side of naan, because naan. We had the nihari and the eggplant masala. Both were spectacular! The nihari was perfectly tender, swimming in a rich, fatty curry sauce with some chilis sprinkled on top. The eggplant were small, cooked in a very flavorful masala sauce.. Amazing vegetarian option. Oh, halfway through our meal I also noticed everyone drinking bright yellow beverages, what I could only assume was mango lassi (a yogurt drink). So I excitedly sauntered up to the counter and asked for one. Please try one.. It sweetly calms the heat of the curry and made my meal leaps and bounds more enjoyable. Overall, this place is one of the best (if not one of the only) Pakistani restaurants (with some Indian too) in Indy. Prices aren't dirt cheap but you're paying for quality. I can't wait to come back for more."], ["Mirch X.", "The place is clean with a good amount of seating areas. I ordered Chicken biryani, Beef nehari and chappatis to- go. \u00a0It was ready to be picked up \u00a0in about 15 minutes. What I was disappointed was the quantity. The biryani was of reasonable quantity- tasted good. The nehari had 1 piece of \u00a0beef and the gravy was of limited quantity. I was surprised that I paid $10 for that. \u00a0Maybe it would be of better quantity if ordered in house to eat? \u00a0I am used to getting a healthy portion of food when I order the same in Chicago...maybe it is because of limited Pakistani restaurants in Indy? \u00a0The person at the counter said that the place had been up and running for about 8 months. They don't have a printed menu..he said that if ordering to go, best to look up online. \u00a0 .... And since he did say that they look up online reviews..my advice... please make the first impression a good one, sot that the customers would want to return ...and that includes good food in reasonable quantity.:)"], ["Arvind W.", "While the prices seem to be a little over the edge for what you get, I think the taste of the food makes up for it. The Biriyani is especially good, and you can make it a combo meal with some entree and chapatis (you saw this coming, didn't you? :)).The ambiance is different with a unique table set layout, and you can even play carrom (East/South asian board game similar to Pool) to pass time while you battle hunger!"], ["John C.", "Awesome local ethnic restaurant!

They offer several vegetarian dishes as well."], ["Amanda C.", "What a wonderful place for Pakistani cuisine! Not busy on a Sunday night, so we got extra special treatment from the cook's son who explained the menu carefully to us. My friend and I decided we'd get one of the four yogurt chaats as an appetizer. We opted for the aloo chaat with potato cakes and chickpeas. A great choice...the mixture of hot and cold and crunchy and soft was great! For the entree, we got beef behari (spiced halal beef kabobs) which was so tender it literally (and I'm a wordsmith, so I'm NOT exaggerating) melts in your mouth. Per my request, it was made pretty spicy, and went well with the green sauces served with it. This was my favorite of all the items. I highly recommend it. The other entree was a \"combo\" where we selected two of the \"gourmet dishes\"--buttered chicken (which actually contained no butter--excellently done) and goat beets. The beets were a gamble item that I ordered and I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome! Also rather spicy, but I like that. Finally, the chapati (bread without yeast) was incredible. The owner brought us a sample of the Arabian smoothie with acai berries and strawberries and if we weren't stuffed, we definitely would have gotten one as it was one of the best smoothies I've ever tasted! Quality ingredients, great service and staff, huge portions. A+"], ["Ronak S.", "One of the significant bummers about Indian food in Indianapolis is that virtually every restaurant takes on a similar brand identity. Each one tries to be fancy and upscale in its ambience and service. Most of the food is virtually identical, giving most non-Indians a myopic view of the cuisine, and in actuality the food would hardly be considered fancy or upscale in India. It's exciting to see that Chapati, the new kid on the block, is not only branding itself as fast casual, but is also offering something new, chaat, in a manner clearly marketed to both Indians and non-Indians.If you've never had chaat before, it's a category of South Asian street food characterized by a dynamic flavor mix of chutneys, with sweet, spicy, salty, and tangy all blended together. Ginger, tamarind, onions, coriander, and yogurt play a big role, often on top of toasted puris, fried potatoes, chickpeas, or lentils. This definitely isn't diet food, but it's beyond delicious, even if you don't typically like Indian food. I've heard individual dishes compared to nachos, sloppy joes, and egg rolls, but the flavor is unlike any other cuisine I know.At this writing, it's hard to comment on service, as when I was there the place was empty. I imagine kinks are still being worked out, but the food we ordered came quickly and the place itself was trendy and attractive inside. For those who look into this, the owners report the meat is 100% halal and organic. As a vegetarian, the choices are a bit more limited than other Indian restaurants, with two vegetarian entrees (daal and eggplant) and a selection from the chaat menu, but everything we tried was so delicious that I could order it every time. I couldn't be more excited that Chapati's in town. No matter what kind of food you like, definitely give it a taste."], ["Arnold S.", "Outstanding. \u00a0Not your typical Indian/desi food place. \u00a0In fact I expected a typical Indian restaurant and when I walked into Chapati -- brightly lit, counter service, booths, a carrom board -- I was surprised. \u00a0This is a family-owned and run joint, and one of the pleasant and enthusiastic sons walked me through the menu. \u00a0I lift weights and try to eat accordingly, so I ended up ordering the beef boti & the chicken boti. \u00a0I kid you not these ended up being the best botis I've ever had in my life, and that's saying a lot considering that I travel for work all over the country and have probably eaten those at 50 other Indian restaurants in half as many states. \u00a0I don't know what their secret is but this boti was so soft and decadent that it almost melted in my mouth. \u00a0And it was not oily or greasy or gluttonous either! \u00a0Anybody can make desi food tasty by loading it with ghee, butter, etc., but to make it healthy and delicious at the same time is quite an achievement, and Chapati nails it. \u00a0Highly recommended."], ["Ellen J.", "My husband and I have driven by Chapati a few times, but it was always after having eaten elsewhere.

He could tell us in detail how things were prepared...very cool. My husband and I each opted to order gourmet dish combos which means we each got to pick 2 gourmet dishes to have with basmati rice and chapati (a thin, grilled wheat bread...explained to us as a thinner, healthier alternative to naan). I got the butter chicken and chili chicken. They were both very flavorful, but my favorite was the butter chicken! So tasty! I highly recommend it! The hubs got yellow daal and eggplant masala. He enjoyed both, but his favorite was the eggplant. He said next time he'd request the daal be made spicier (which is an option).We both agree that the chapati was very nice and the rice cooked perfectly.

Chapati excites me. Several months ago, a Pakistani friend of mine highly recommended this restaurant, and said that the food was very authentic - reminding him of his home country. \u00a0He further told me that with my appreciation of food from this region of the world, I would love it, too. \u00a0After a period of unfounded procrastination, I am proudly able to attest that my friend was correct!First impressions are lasting impressions. \u00a0This old clich\u00e9 certainly proved true during my visit to Chapati. \u00a0From the moment we entered, we were warmly greeted and asked if we were familiar with how their interesting menu worked. \u00a0Since we were not, it was explained that the menu was broken into three categories: gourmet dishes, spiced meats, and chaats. \u00a0It was further explained that we were able to get combinations of the gourmet dishes, or order them, as well as the spiced meats and chaats, as standalone items. The spiced meats are able to be ordered as wraps using the chapati. \u00a0Each menu item about which I inquired was thoroughly explained - and explained well enough to make my mouth water. \u00a0 With each sumptuous description the man gave, he was sure to describe the impeccable quality of the organic meats used in each of the restaurant's dishes. \u00a0Chapati is a family owned and operated establishment. \u00a0The owners, who are Pakistani, incorporate family recipes from their homeland, as well as India. \u00a0If that wasn't enough, they even even incorporate some Mediterranean fusion! \u00a0After much deliberation, I ordered a combination of Nihari and Chili Chicken with basmati rice. \u00a0To my pleasure, the restaurant has different spice levels--and since their food is made to order, they are able to satisfy the pallets of the most sensitive suburbanite to the most unyielding urbanite. \u00a0Initially, I chose the \"ridiculously hot\" option, but upon chef's advice, I went with \"very hot\" (in order to avoid interfering with other important flavors). \u00a0It was the right decision, for I ate an exquisite meal. \u00a0The Nihari, which is made from beef shank, was so tender (after being slow cooked for more than 24 hours), that it was eaten with a spoon and a piece of chapati. \u00a0The Chili Chicken was a larger portion than the Nihari, and of course, completely different. \u00a0It featured well-rounded flavors, and was nicely complemented by the bed of basmati rice beneath it. I found ordering additional chapatis to be quite necessary. \u00a0The extras (ordered mid-meal) were (of course) also made to order, served piping hot, and even came with two small samples of house chutney. \u00a0Unlike other local restaurants of the region, the presentation of the food at Chapati is outstanding. \u00a0It arrives at the table nearly as pretty as it tastes.There is no doubt in my mind that I will return to Chapati many, many times in the future. \u00a0This is a restaurant with diversity, class, style, and extraordinary taste. \u00a0Well done, Chapati. \u00a0Well done!-------*The Oxford American College Dictionary, through Google.com"], ["Laquinti H.", "Authentic Pakistan cuisine but with a fast food twist!!

I happened to start on the non-meat end and kept wondering if they had left out the meat or if I got the wrong order. I think it would have sucked if I started on the meat end..The meat itself was very good and flavorful. However, because it's already so flavorful, I felt that the pickles that came inside the wrap did not complement it.

I typically get half eggplant masala and half daal, along with a mango juice. I'm never disappointed. And I'm all about supporting small, local biz. Mom's in the kitchen cooking while her son works the front of the house. The menu is explained clearly and the customer service is always excellent. I even chose this as my most recent birthday dinner. Hands down, you have to go. GO!"], ["Maaz B.", "Great food, great atmosphere. Excellent blend of Pakistani, organic and vegan dishes!"], ["Michelle B.", "My husband and I were passing through Indianapolis on our cross-country move, and the reviews for this place were good, so we stopped in for dinner. The cashier went helpfully went over all our options. We went for the split entrees. We both ordered Goat Beets. He had Chili Chicken, and I had Nihari. We also got rice and Chapati to go with them.The Goat Beets were tender, flavorful, and well-spiced. The Chili Chicken and Nihari were pretty good, but nothing special. The rice and bread were pleasant. We also got the Sweet Yogurt Chaat, which was very odd. The yogurt was sweet, tangy, and good, but I wasn't fond of the fluffy puffs or crackers, and the spice on the fluffy puffs (chili powder?) didn't mix well with the sweet yogurt. I would definitely order the Goat Beets again, but not the others. The restaurant was very modern looking, which wasn't what I expected, but it was nice. We were there late, so once the only other diners left, it was just us seated directly across from the cashier, which was a little awkward, since he didn't have much to do. All in all, I was happy with our dinner, and the opportunity to try new kinds of food."], ["Beena J.", "We dropped in for the first time for a lighter \u00a0lunch than an full indian buffet. We were pleasantly surprised, got goat with beets, a huge chapathi, aloo chaat and Falooda...which was great. Everything was mildly spiced. Will definitely return"], ["Katharine A.", "All I can say is this is authentic and amazingly delicious. They don't hold back on spice or dilute the flavor with creams. A MUST try!"], ["John R.", "One of the best Indian food places in Indianapolis. The menu has expanded, and the place is growing. Excellent food, with a large open atmosphere!"], ["Mustafa A.", "Great food, great customer service. It's perfect for lunch and dinner.

Food was delicious and I would definitely recommend it to everyone. Will definitely be coming back soon!"], ["Andrea C.", "I want to really, really like this place. Fast casual Indian/Pakistani food? Yes, please! Interior looks great, staff was super personable and you can tell this is probably a family effort. I love the idea behind them and hope to visit again once they get the details ironed out!! I never got my change (only a few cents, no bigs) and my food was way more oily than I anticipated. They should do well!"], ["Mike S.", "This hidden gem is someplace that everyone should try. We were greeted by the owner who also explained the menu to us. We ordered the Butter Chicken and Nihari, which is a beef dish. We also ordered a chaat, which is a street food that had a lot of textures and flavor going on. We thought that everything was absolutely delicious. The prices were very reasonable. At first the portions didn't seem very big but we were full when we left. You should really go check this place out."], ["Jake M.", "I really enjoyed this restaurant, for a few reasons in particular. First of which, this restaurant is unlike any other Indian place in Indy. Most Indian places are buffet lunch, serve the same menus, are decorated the same way, etc. Chapati is made to order all of the time with a small but yet diverse menu and modern decor. The chaats here are extremely flavorful, best I have had in Indy. The entrees were good as well. My wife and I had the chili chicken (high quality meat, good flavor but make sure you order spicy or else it is very mild), chicken boti (marinated grilled boneless chicken pieces, my least favorite of all the dishes we ordered, juicy meat but flavor less overall flavor), beef nahari (like a roast beef stew, very tender beef roast in a thick brownish gravy, spiced with many fresh Indian spices to make it pack a nice punch), and yellow dal (mashed lentils in yellow sauce, ordered spicy and was absolutely killer. Have not had dal this mouth watering since moving to Indy). Lastly, the bread is very soft and fluffy which I like personally as opposed to burnt and crispy. Also, the mango lassi was fantastic. Food is good portioned for the price in my opinion as well.10-11 bucks for two entrees, rice, and bread."], ["Maulik S.", "Omg !!! Home food paradise. Caters as per individual tastes. \u00a0I wish If increase vegetarian dishes. Need samosa, Dosa and stuff. Mashib does great job."], ["Rod C.", "If you like Indian food, check this place out. They cook every meal fresh to order, and when I asked about the quality of the meats I was told it was 100 percent organic. Very similar to Indian food, but even better in my opinion. Def a hidden gem."], ["Toan N.", "I went there today to try it out. Never had this type of food before and was kind of hesitant at first. I'm so glad I went! The place itself is super nice, very modern, very warm feeling as soon as you walk in. The service is great, the people are nice and informative. They took their time explaining to me the different items they have on their menu. The food came out really quickly, and it was amazing! I had some of their chicken. It was so flavorful and rich. You can tell they use high quality ingredients in their dishes. Do yourself a favor and check this place out, you won't regret it"], ["Nadeem A.", "Excellent eatery!. The deco is simple and tasteful . The food is excellent, fresh and delectable. Five stars!."], ["Haris M.", "Very different place from all the other desi restaurants! Lots of space, very clean, and they even have a carton table for you to enjoy while you wait for your food! The food is made fresh and tastes delicious! Very authentic!

All the food is Zabihah halal. We went in for their Ramadan Buffet. We left out impressed. They opened up 5 months ago and for start doing really well. In the buffet they had dates, fruit chaat, Chana chaat, dahi chaat, papri, watermelon, cantaloupe, alu samosa, pakorays, daal, bhindi, naan, chicken karayi, chai, and rooh afza. All the buffet items are their special and on their fb page they post what special will be coming next. Everything was very tasty and we will def try them out again."], ["Prajod K.", "Excellent fresh food, authentic taste of Indian dishes, a totally different ambience from a typical indo-pak reataurant.

Their hummus and spicy gyros are good. The location is great! It's right down the street from the monument. I remember having dinner there before the Circle of Lights ceremony and that was perfect since we just walked down the street afterwards to the music and festivities. It's a casual place so it's better for lunch than dinner. Their decor is minimal but still exotic. Service has always been great and friendly when we've gone. And their meat is halal yay."], ["Anthony T.", "Found this place On my usual and almost daily haunt for a quick bite to eat with my sister downtown. \u00a0This place cropped up on our search and we decided a little walk sounded like a great way to enjoy one of the last warm days of fall. \u00a0I'm so glad we expanded our search radius because this place is such a hidden little gem. \u00a0I had the chicken falafel and it was delightful! \u00a0Great portion size, enough to fill you up but not too much to send you back to your office in a wheel barrow. \u00a0The staff was very friendly and quick at fulfilling our orders. \u00a0It's pretty intimate in size and feels pretty casual. \u00a0There's enough on the menu of you want to stop by for a full course meal or stop in for a cupper and catch up on some emails. \u00a0I'd have given 5 stars, but as great as it was I wasn't quite \"wowed.\" \u00a0Perhaps I will be next time, I'm definitely going back!"], ["Clare L.", "Great place for lunch at reasonable prices. Love the Express Lunch specials. I had the 1/2 falafel and Greek salad (you can get fries instead of the salad) which included a drink, for $7.50. What a deal!Falafel was good, not the best I've had but certainly worth trying. I almost liked the pita and tzatziki sauce more though. Greek salad was excellent - loved the dressing. Just wish there would have been more black olives! I didn't think the service was too great - might have been a little understaffed because we never saw our server after waiting a while to place our order. I had to flag him down to get a drink refill. The deliciousness of the food outweighs the service in my opinion. It wasn't awful, but definitely could have been better. Overall, delicious and unique lunch option downtown. I like that they have delivery, take out and now, a food truck. I'll definitely be a loyal Ali Baba patron from here forward. For next time: the spicy gyro."], ["Amy S.", "Biking around downtown, the smell of this place caught my nose. My friend talked me out of eating the PB&J I packed for lunch and to eat here. I like it. I don't love it. The lunch special prices are really good, the gyros meat is soft, flavorful and too greasy. The tatziki sauce was not over powering garlicky or cucumbery \u00a0(trademark pending on that word). I would prefer regular fries with a squeeze of lemon ad greek seasoning as opposed to the coated fries they serve. I really liked the baba gnoush (sp?) even though it was on the smoker side. Falafel are fried crispy almost burnt but good flavor. The hummus wax smooth but maybe a bit too much lemon.Service was good, seated right away, plenty of attention and refills, she just wasn't super friendly, but I'm fine if your good at your job and not rude."], ["TOMMY o.", "Up from the Canal i came, a litlle cold, & a tired, i thought Turkish coffee, a little pick me up & warm up.I've NEVER taken a bathroom pic, but grab your own roll, and what is that Plactic relic?

As expected, the shawarma were oversized - American shawarma's. And they are not even close to back home's ones - I'm guessing since they are not hang and cooked on the shawarma machine.The other side orders were decent. The staff were friendly.I'd go there, but probably try something else unless if they do change the way they cook shawarma."], ["Brian H.", "I like falafel, and I like the way Ali Baba does falafel. They also have good baba ghanouj (spelling?). It's not the best, but it is good. I went with a buddy who ordered \"hot tea\" so I am not sure what it is actually listed as on the menu. When he tasted it his initial reaction was simply that the tea was interesting but by the time he finished the cup he was in love and ordered more. They also have the flaming cheese on the menu. I forget what it is called now but it's fried cheese that they light on fire in front of you. You cannot go wrong.They also have a hookah bar. That's not really my scene so I can't offer too much insight, but it's there."], ["Ellie I.", "The food here is delicious. I am a spanakopita fan and theirs is the best in Indy, truly tastes homemade. The problem with this restaurant is the ambiance. It almost feels like a hall, somewhere you don't hang out for long. The huge tv is a little out of place. However, all that said the food is worth it. Better yet, just get your order to go and eat at the circle."], ["Ali M.", "If you're expecting authentic middle eastern food from this restaurant, then please look elsewhere or better yet check out my reviews and see where are the authentic middle eastern places are at in the Indy area, I tried the shawarma and falafel, it was just ok but definitely not something I would go back again to buy. Ali Baba obviously main advantage is its location, being the only middle eastern restaurant downtown, it is acceptable when you don't have a car and short on time, otherwise there are MUCH better places to eat at around the city."], ["Bob C.", "Great gyro!

I've always had a good experience here. I couldn't help but notice some people critiquing the customer service aspect, and I assure you, they are fantastic. I think the people saying this just want an excuse to complain and/or have never experienced working in a restaurant. \u00a0If anyone seems \"unfriendly,\" which I've never once witnessed, perhaps it's a simple matter of being busy! The staff and facility is small, but everyone working here is considerate/attentive to all patrons no matter what. What do you expect during lunch rush? Especially downtown? Mamduh (hope I'm spelling that correctly) and his beautiful mother and sister are reason enough to come. Such friendly, warm people. Always.  \u00a0 I constantly recommend this place to people, especially since it's one of the few non-chain, non-American, local places to eat in central downtown. Why is all the good foreign food in the middle of nowhere in Indiana?! Order the baba ghanouj and fattoush salad. So fresh and definitely homemade. Only thing I'd like to see is some more foods native to Jordan, which is where much of the staff is from!  I love it here. 10/10"], ["Brittany S.", "Meh just about sums it up. Maybe meh.5 as in 3.5? Corrine P's quote sums it up: \"I will definitely go again, but I wasn't completely in love.\" I've been to Ali Baba multiple times, most of these visits were from my time of working on the Circle out of convenience and urgent falafel cravings. So, why a three star experience and not a four or five?-baba ganoush = oddly smoky in flavor - too smoky-falafel leans on the hard/burnt side, oddly enough I think the pita has this one more down pat-it's a much inviting restaurant during the week at lunch time. There's something comforting about a restaurant not being dead empty-service is meh - our drinks were never refilled during our 45 minute visit-prices fall between $8-$10 for a lunch meal-Turkish coffee is available-hookah can be smoked on the sidewalk out front"], ["Franklin D.", "So tasty I had a gyro here for lunch and went back and had kebabs for dinner. Everything I tried, I liked. We came in with a party that filled up the back room and overflowed into the front room. They didn't even bat an eye, just started asking people to raise hands (who wants chx kebabs, who wants lamb, etc.) Totally handled all 60-70ish people like pros."], ["Marvi B.", "This restaurant is located a block from the circle. It offers a decent variety of Mediterranean foods which are well made and affordable. I usually get the chicken shwarma however I have tried pretty much everything else. Their kebobs, spanakopita also Greek hamburger are very well made. Sometimes when they are busy the service gets lousy but I guess it's ok given the food is cheap and delicious."], ["David P.", "We went here for dinner while we were in town for a convention.The food was okay.The main problem was how incredibly rude the staff was. We also didn't even get some of the food that we ordered and then they acted like they were doing us a favor when they took it off the bill.My girlfriend ordered a recommended dish and then a few minutes later her friend ordered the same. Her friend got the dish, which turned out to be quite good. However, when the rest of our food came out, they simply made my gf a different dish because they ran out and they didn't bother to even ask or say anything until after it came out and we'd already waited almost an hour."], ["Nick J.", "Alright. \u00a0Portion sizes and prizes are ok. \u00a0Food in standard Mediterranean/Arabic in more of a luncheon rather than sit-down setting. \u00a0Only comparably priced food downtown, so worth it when looking for a budget option."], ["Adam S.", "Stopped in for a Thursday lunch. Even at noon we were able to be seated right away, which was nice. I enjoyed one of the lunch specials, a spicy gyro with fries. It included a drink and with tax the total bill still only came to $8! Quite a deal. The food was delicious. The service was sub par. Our food was delivered without drinks and I had to get up from the table and ask for those after several minutes of munching on my fries. Getting the bill and paying took longer than it should have as well. Overall, the value was great. I'll probably return for lunch again."], ["K B.", "I think this place is very good. My fellow diner wasn't particularly impressed, but I enjoyed the food. Nice, clean atmosphere."], ["Ramsha B.", "Honestly the only reason why we decided to give this place a shot was because A) it was close to our hotelB) it was halalC) we like middle Eastern food.But I was actually impressed! I really liked their chicken shawarma plate. My husband had their spicy gyro meat. I'm not really a gyro fan so can't judge that. But the shawarma was some good stuff. Sheesha was okayish. We're actually not used to the coals they use but they had good flavors."], ["Dylan E.", "Not a bad place, but I think with the abundance of other restaurants around town to go get a gyro at, this one didn't really offer anything to compensate for prices that I found to be higher than most others.The location is conveniently close to the circle, and has large windows in the main seating are to offer a good people-watching experience. There is a back room that is much more decorated and looks like a fun place to go sit, but we weren't offered the option to go there and didn't notice it until we were leaving. It looks like it was probably where their hookah area was but now is just for eating, but don't quote me on that. They had some sort of fun Middle Eastern music on in the background to set some ambiance, but also had a big TV with football games on, so you get a little bit of two different cultures. The service wasn't quite on par for a place with only a handful of customers during my visit for lunch on a Saturday. The same person, who did not at all look happy to be there, was wearing many hats and was working as the hostess, waitress, bus boy, and cashier for the entire place. We got our orders in pretty quickly, but that was about the extent of it as far as service goes. I think a lot of it had to do with a decently steady stream of to-go orders getting placed at the hostess counter and taking up her time, but attention to our table was noticeably lacking.The food was ok. I went with the \"full\" gyro instead of the \"half\", which turned out to just be two smaller gyros and leads me to believe the half gyro is just one. Because of the two sandwiches, you end up with a lot less meat and a lot more bread than other places that make one big gyro. The pita was tasty and warm, and the meat tasted like what you get off of any of those large rotating spits, without being too dry or overcooked. The tatziki sauce left a lot to be desired, and was basically just chopped up cucumbers in a very watery base. It was definitely not yogurt based and whatever the runny sauce the cucumbers were in was, it just immediately dripped all over the place when you tried to eat. It came with a couple pieces of lettuce and one small bite of tomato. Overall, a place I'd probably go back to if I was craving Mediterranean style food and it was conveniently close to where I was at the time, but not somewhere I would go out of my way to visit again."], ["Corrine P.", "For lunch I ordered the spicy gyro and greek salad. The food was pretty good. \u00a0 I will definitely go again, but I wasn't completely in love. Also, the service was not awesome. We had to find another waitress to refill our drinks and chase her down for the check."], ["Sonya A.", "We went in with rather low expectations, not expecting much at it was 8:30p and just wanted a quick bite. We were SUPER pleasantly surprised. We had the baba ganoush app, the half order falafel, full order spicy gyro and a side of fries. Every little bit of it was delicious! Good quality, good flavor!

The restaurant is also a hookah lounge, but since we were in there around lunch time, between 11am and 12pm, there was no one smoking inside. The lounge is separated from the area of the restaurant where you consume your food without inhaling smoke. The music was very loud for a sit-down eating experience, especially for that time of the day, so that wasn't great, but the food tends to make up for it. I ordered the full spicy gyro sandwich with tzatziki sauce and my dad did a half sandwich of the same dish. The gyro was delicious. Spicy, but not overwhelming, and I was able to easily eat the entire thing. We also ordered a lamb appetizer pizza. It was also delicious, but somewhat small. Since we both got gyros, it wasn't a big deal and were probably somewhat happy it was so small, but for a party of more than two people, I would consider getting something else. Our pizza consisted of four tiny pieces of pizza. But all very delicious pizza. The feta cheese is strong, and the spices are plentiful, so be prepared for what you are ordering--it's a very strong dish. I was beyond pleased with the food. The service was good also, but mind you, we were the only two people in the restaurant. The server was foreign, so that could potentially be hard to understand for some, but it was fine for us.

The butter chicken is amazing or split the appetizer sampler or just a plate of hummus. I usually get the sangria but they just put in a bar (I'm not a fan but whatever). Be prepared, it gets packed quickly on weekends and they don't take reservations. They also charge for water so it's not the best stop for after-party hydration although they are open super late. Get the Egyptian tea if you're looking for non-alcoholic. The only negatives----it can get really smokey when it's busy (ventilation isn't always perfect) and it's a little divey (the bathroom in particular makes me make my \"ick\" face, not that it's unclean, just needs an update).

I always get a bit of a buzz that's pretty unique and fun. I like the mint hookah because it has a cooling effect, but i'm not sure I would recommend this to everyone. Free WIFI is a plus, but I haven't really used it. I see some people with their computers just hanging out.My strongest recommendation is to PLEASE not mix too much alcohol with hookah. You will throw up. Friends don't let friends do this.My biggest complaint is that they sometimes charge for water. I've been know to fight this... and you should to. Ask for the manager.

Other than that, everyone I've encountered has been very friendly, even when the place is packed.  \u00a0 \u00a0 My biggest pet peeve is that they don't serve water. You have to buy it by the bottle, which can be a bit of a hassle. You're better off spending the money on a cappuccino. \u00a0 \u00a0 The only food I've tried at The Egyptian is their seasoned fries with fetta cheese. Definitely goes well with smoking."], ["Amanda B.", "I love this place. We are there several times during the week...everyone is polite and the service is great. Its a welcoming environment where the servers make your feel relaxed and comfortable."], ["Troy B.", "Great service, good people and a wonderful atmosphere. If you want to smoke hooks inside and hate the smell of cigarette smoke this is the place to go."], ["Brian L.", "Great place to go to relax and have a good time! They have a large selection of different flavors of hookah. Then the food and the different types of specialty teas just top off the great night you can have at this place with friends!"], ["Ryan D.", "Great place to relax and unwind from a day of work or a night out. I live the atmosphere in this place, it is like you are transported to another world. The food is excellent and the service is superb. It is not just for smokers, I speak from experience. I enjoy hookah a lot and very few places have a joint like this. I suggest there blue mist if you get a chance or ask a server what they recommend."], ["Cliff H.", "Sent the first two glasses of wine back because they tasted \"off\" but the waiter opened a new bottle at our table after admitting that nobody drinks wine at the restaurant and the first bottle was two weeks old.The service was very good. I was not impressed with the hummus or the salad that came with the entree, but the chicken kabob was decent... and both my dining partner and I agreed that the rice was quite good.Having said that, I don't know if I'll come back just for the food... overall 3 stars."], ["Ashleigh A.", "If you love hookah and Bhangra music, this is the place for you! They also have decent food and drinks. Been going here for years, since before I could get into bars, and there is a hint of nostalgia every time I go in. Don't go as much because I have my own hookah, but it's a nice, dimly lit place to relax."], ["Tahaira S.", "I like to make sure my that my magic carpet flies through The Egyptian whenever possible! \u00a0There is so much to love about this hooka bar from start to finish!Upon entering The Egyptian you are pleasantly greeted by a ton of atmosphere and charisma to get you geared up to get your hooka on! Everything from the art on the walls, the music in your ear, the decor at your grasp and the flavors in the air draw you in immediately. \u00a0Even if you have never enjoyed the art of hooka, you will leave The Egyptian feeling like a pro. \u00a0At The Egyptian you will find people on the nightlife stroll, lounging after a rough day, hanging out with friends, or even putting in some work on the laptop. \u00a0Whatever your mood, you'll have a great time here.A huge bonus here is the staff! \u00a0Everyone is so knowledgeable of the products offered. \u00a0Whether you need help choosing a hooka flavor, ( or 2, or 3) one of their cultural and delicious entrees or drink selections, the staff is happy to help. \u00a0In no way will you be making any blind selections at The Egyptian. \u00a0Everyone is extremely helpful and well informed. \u00a0You can ask as many questions as you like to make your choice exactly what you want. \u00a0While attending with quite the picky and indecisive bunch, our waitress offered to make us a special blend of flavors that was her personal favorite. \u00a0We agreed and we were not disappointed! \u00a0What a sweetheart, right!?Speaking of the menu, there are SO many awesome and intriguing hooka flavors to choose from. \u00a0Whatever the pallet craves, there's something for everyone. \u00a0You can choose a single flavor, create your own mixtures, choose from a selection of mixtures on the menu and even add a huge hunk of fruit to your hooka! \u00a0Outside of the hooka... whatever you do, if you do nothing else, HAVE THE FRENCH FRIES! \u00a0Oh Mylanta the fries will make you get down on one knee! \u00a0Another one of my fav's is the Bubble Tea! \u00a0It's by far the cutest beverage I have ever drank in my life! Just make sure you aren't lactose intolerant!All in all, The Egyptian Cafe and Hooka Bar is a great place to lounge before or after going bar hopping, it's a great bar to hop, you can't be over nor under dressed, there's no cover (whoo hoo!) and the free Wi-Fi is definitely something to write home about! Go! Now!"], ["Allie S.", "They've gotten their act together since Lava opened. Good music again, revamped their falafel sandwich, staff is much friendlier and more attentive, and hookahs and shisha are better quality than Lava. The one thing that I really, really do not like are the awkwardly low tables. I can't get my knees under them so I spend the entire time slouching to reach my table. But hey, everything else is good."], ["M H.", "I adore this place during the day & highly recommend it.Pros:Nice ambiance. \u00a0In a sea of cookie-cutter in Nap, it is so refreshing to actually feel like you've walked into a cafe in the middle east. \u00a0The music and cushions strewn across hand-carved wooden furniture shipped directly from Egypt are fantastic.Tasty food. \u00a0While I'm veg (highly recommend the falafel, hummus, and homemade baklava) I'm consistently told that the butter chicken is to die for.Encourages lingering. \u00a0The hookah and the free wi-fi are nice touches.The owner. \u00a0Very friendly, thoughtful, and gregarious - seems like he knows everyone.Tip: if you're a tea fan - ask for green tea with mint & sugar. \u00a0my first sip took me careening back to n. africa like the food critic was taken back to his sunny childhood in Ratatouille. \u00a0now whenever i'm in town, you'll find me there getting my fix.Cons:Smoke. \u00a0The place is equipped with some pretty good air purifiers, but you're still going to come out smelling like hookah. \u00a0If you go during the day, make sure you don't have an important meeting afterward. a client asked me afterward why i smelled like a smoky grapefruit.The evening crowd. \u00a0I think this may be the only gathering place in Broad Ripple Village which allows customers under the age of 21 (must be at least 18 however). \u00a0The banter and intoxication from pre-gaming back at the dorms may be a little off-putting for the more mature crowd.The service is very friendly but chances are good your college-age server is not going to preempt keeping your water glass full. \u00a0Flag 'em down and you'll be fine. \u00a0They do get quite busy in the evenings so don't anticipate having a quick in-&-out meal.Overall: one of the great distinctive secrets of this city where you might be hard-pressed to find a locally-owned establishment with lots of character. \u00a0Go!"], ["Adam L.", "The Egyptian is a nice little place tucked off the main drag in Broad Ripple that my friends and I refer to as \"the hookah bar\", because, well, that's what it is.However! That is not all it is. Along with being a pretty decent hookah bar, the food is pretty good too. I've had the butter chicken and the kafta, and they're both amazing.Basically, if you're stumbling around Brip and you want to smoke and eat some good food, this is your spot."], ["Mike F.", "This place is mediocre at best. \u00a0I thought the food was overpriced and lacked flavor. \u00a0The owners cater to patrons between the ages of 18-20 and most of their business comes from the Hookah bar. \u00a0This place is loud, obnoxious, and the service is wretched. \u00a0I really can't figure out why I'm not giving this place one star."], ["Sarah S.", "Having been first for both The Egyptian and Khoury's, I now humbly declare myself Crown Princess of Hookah, Kingdom of Indianapolis. Yes! Check that off the Lifetime Goals List. I knew all that fawning in front of the mirror in tutu and tiara as a child would pay off someday. Oh, hell, who am I kidding--I still do that. No, really.Anyway, for daytime hookah adventures, this place definitely bests Khoury's. Their hookahs are cheaper and, arguably, more flavorful. They tend to employ young, cute and artsy waitresses, if you're into that. The ambiance is perhaps my favorite of any restaurant in town. It takes me right back to Istanbul--the dark wood furniture with intricate inlays, the star lamps, the willowy potted plants and the multitude of mirrors. I love it. The music could stand to be turned down a notch, but perhaps even saying that betrays my age. I'm old enough to appreciate a venue where I can actually hear my companions.Which brings me to my least favorite aspect of The Egyptian. If you are old enough to drink in public, do NOT venture into this place on a Friday or Saturday night. You will be knee-deep in underage college students looking for a place to show as much skin as possible and get mildly high (hookah does give you a slight tobacco buzz, after all). Even amongst that demographic, I would have guessed it'd draw a goth/pretentious/art victim kind of crowd. But no, it somehow functions as a vortex for bottle-blonde girls wearing those brightly colored, sweatshirt-fabric mini-skirts and jockish guys in ball caps rakishly turned to the side. If I wanted to go back to high school, I'd...well, I'd actually kill myself first. Any other time of the week, though, it's wonderful. I recommend a pot of tea and a large order of hummus with your hookah."], ["Scot C.", "Really good Mediterranean food for a price that's dece. \u00a0Good hookah on the high-end (I recommend the Pharaoh). \u00a0Cool hangout, has a definite Persian feel and atmosphere. \u00a0Casual, cool, laid back, smoky sweet shop. \u00a0Worth a try."], ["Lyn C.", "Note: This review is only for the food, not the hookah. \u00a0Ate the chicken kabob for dinner. \u00a0It was dry. \u00a0Egyptian tea: gross!

My first trip there was at 2am on a Friday night. We went with a group of people and split two hookahs between the six of us. I tried their mozzarella sticks and the Egyptian fries (without the feta cheese) and they were delicious. I also tried the fresh lemonade, and it was *okay*. Husband was in love with the hummus and his Egyptian iced tea. Our server was totally rude to us after we ordered more food, like he was exasperated that we were giving the restaurant more money. We got charged for a water we didn't order, but it was taken off. The second time we came back and had the same server. He was a lot nicer then. It would have been an okay visit if it weren't for the huge table of high schoolers (18+ though) behind us, talking loudly and being generally rude to those sitting around them. In general, if you want a smoke and some decent food, go at a time there's not going to be any high school kids there to ruin your experience. Also, it's not really an eat and run kinda place. You need to experience the ambiance first."], ["Cheryl H.", "I traditionally have gone there for their hookah (which is ok - I'm from Metro Detroit, and Dearborn [outside of the D] has the largest Middle Eastern population outside the Middle East) is ok. I'm just picky. Their prices for hookah are pretty reasonable and they have a wide range of flavors. However - to my delight their food is pretty good too! Their hummus was good as well as their falafals! My friends have had their pita wraps and their fries are actually excellent haha. I'm not sure if its because I've always had a good time with friends here but this place is A-OK in my books."], ["r. m.", "Where can I begin?Went there on a date in which my date arrived early and was hit on by our waiter several times until I arrived. But wait, he continues to do so while I was there. Strike one.Don't get me wrong, however, he didn't do so often while he was there because he only came to our table a total of three times over a two hour period and never with what we asked in addition to what we ordered (i.e. another glass of water, a fork, the bill, etc.). Strike two.Speaking of the clearly poor customer service, I ordered lemonade which took me 30 minutes to get because it was \"coming.\" I expected to be blown away by the taste of freshly crushed lemons in some honey-based liquid. Alas, it tasted like something a step above warm Minute Maid lemonade. Strike three.With three strikes most people are out of the game, right. Not really, you ever play something baseball related game (softball, \"piggy,\" \u00a0strike out, etc.) with somebody who refuses to leave the batting position. Well that's this spot.We (remember I was on a date) were now late for two movies that started because we thought we could just pick up some grub and drive down the street to Glendale Mall. We were finally smart enough to ask for the bill when he arrived to our table with our main meals (of course winking at my date). The bill came and it totaled nearly $60 which I was floored over because all we ordered were hummus, two entrees, one late lemonade, one sprite, and a hookah. A small order of food + not so good (but not terrible) = high bill. Strike four.Lastly, I began to feel extremely bloated while eating my meal prior to us leaving for the flick. During the movie I had no appetite for anything such as popcorn, etc. Because it was rumbling like a Tums or some other ant-acid commercial. I have been nursing clearly food poisoning symptoms since eating at this (insert expletive) place such as vomiting, diarrhea, the runs (and I mean the sprinting), and headaches. This is not good especially when I have to give lectures at work on a stage. I now appear to my students as a person in need for Flomax. Strike five-ten.If this were that baseball-like game with that person who refuses to get off the batters box but is striking out, then at this point me and the other kids are whooping that (insert expletive) and taking the bat away. I had high hopes for this place being a vegetarian, a muslim, a traveller, and a foodie. We went on a Monday so I didn't experience the mad rush of drunken Broad Ripple-ites, it was only four other tables with people in the whole place. Minor positives: location and parking are great, ambiance is fabulous, and hookahs are cool.Sadly, that was the last date with the person I went to but more importantly this will be the last time I care to venture into this place.One"], ["Jennifer L.", "I like the atmosphere of this tiny place off the main strip in Broad Ripple as much, if not more, than the food. The Egyptian claims to be modeled off Egypt's illustrious El Fishawy, a playground for local artists and bohemians (if you can be a bohemian Egyptian, I dunno). The hookahs are imported from Egypt, and these antique, rusty smoke kettles sure look that way.I've spent hours playing cards here against the ambiance of foreign dialects, enjoying my falafel (it's pretty good and pungent here) and hummus. My boyfriend thought his gyro sandwich of beef and lamb was just \"okay\" ... but he doesn't like ethnic food much. \u00a0Try it out if you like Middle Eastern food."], ["Theodore B.", "Because when I think of hookah, I think of not being able to talk to anyone over shitty club music.
