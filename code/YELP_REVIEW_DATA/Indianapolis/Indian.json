We were immediately seated in the front, and about one minute later another couple was seated next to us. \u00a0We put in our full order after about five minutes, which was pretty basic - Tandoori Chicken, Vindaloo Curry, and some Naan. \u00a0The other couple put their order in about the same time. Over the next hour, we watched the other couple receive their food, eat their food, eat dessert, get their check, pay, and happily leave the restaurant and drive away BEFORE WE GOT OUR FOOD. \u00a0Keep in mind we have the same waiter and he walked by our table 15 times during this process (we didn't get drink refills during this time either). \u00a0He finally came by to ask us how things were going...um, not well.His excuse was that our order was made \"to-go\" instead of for dine-in, but either way he should have been checking on us and realized something was wrong after 5-10 minutes, not a full hour later when we we're both pretty pissed and hungry. I will say they adjusted our check (one free dish) and most of the other patrons seemed to be getting good service, but our service was unacceptable and I cannot recommend this place based on our experience."], ["Krista R.", "Meh.Still eating our first plate from the lunch buffet, we were informed to hurry and get our second and last plate before they closed.

We will be back!Service 5/5We went on a Monday evening at 5:30 PM so the restaurant was nearly empty (there were a lot of take out orders going out though). Our server was very friendly and attentive. I'm not sure if this was because there wasn't much else to do since there was only one other couple dining there. We'll see how it is if it's busy next time we go.Atmosphere/Ambiance 3/5Clean and pleasant but nothing special.Food 4/5They started us off with a basket of tasty papadum. I then ordered a cup of their coconut soup which was good. I was expecting a slightly stronger coconut flavor but I still enjoyed it. The coconut was chopped very fine so it had a really nice texture. For dinner I ordered the Chicken Makhani and my husband ordered the Paneer Masala. The waiter asked if we wanted the spiciness level to be mild, medium, hot or very hot and we both chose medium. Everything came out piping hot and were very generous portions. We both liked our entrees, my husband liked mine a little bit more than his though. I would say mine was a bit more bold in flavor than his. The entrees were served with a spicy pepper chutney, although we are wondering if that was supposed to have come out with the chips at the beginning. In any case the chutney was amazing! The level of spiciness of the Makhani was good too, if I was in the mood for spicy food I could have gone for the hot.Overall 4/5 We also got a stamp card...1 stamp for lunch and 2 stamps for dinner.

I'll make it that simple. My first choice is India Garden, but Shalimar is good, too, and with India Garden so close, I don't too often. We were going to go to India Garden, but after struggling to find a parking spot there, I suggested we just go to Shalimar. We were in the mood for some Indian, and we would for sure find a parking space in front of Shalimar on a week night. We did- right in front of the door. And there were maybe three tables occupied. I noticed after sitting there for awhile, they probably get just as much, if not more, carryout business than table service. At least that night, they did. It was a bit awkward because while there were only three tables occupied, the server was rushing around like mad, knocking things around in the backroom/kitchen area when he went back there. While he didn't talk a whole lot, he was seemingly friendly.I ordered the Chicken Korma, and when asked about my preferred spice level, I said hot. I don't know that I've had Chicken Korma. I really enjoy Tikka Masala (along with probably every other American, I assume) and the Chicken Vindaloo. I decided to go with the Korma. I had a couple pieces of chicken that were fairly gristly. The bigger chunks were much better. The spice; however, I can't say was even medium- It was more on the mild side. Shalimar does give a frequent diner card- Pretty cool."], ["Michayla S.", "Awesome Indian food. Their garlic naan (and regular naan,too) is so good. My favorite entree is their lamb curry. It's the perfect amount of spice. I would also recommend the mango lahssi. It's a really great non-alcoholic drink. The lunch buffet is a great value. It has all the entrees that I really like and tons of veggie sides, too. As long as you like Indian food in general, you'll find things you like there. They have milk balls for dessert that are incredibly good. Service is very good, and this place is great for carry out. We do it a lot, and the food holds up at home."], ["Kyle B.", "Food is great, price is fair, and staff is friendly. If you are in the broad ripple area for lunch, this place is worth checking out. Shalimar offers a stamp card that can be used at all 4 of its locations, which can be redeemed for a free lunch buffet after you have purchased nine. This goes by fast if you are dining with another!"], ["Kevin M.", "Awesome Indian food! Great vegetarian options. We ordered the nr. korma and the B. masala. Both were delicious.

Now I have not had the chance to try the buffet, which is supposed to be dazzling, but I did have dinner. Did I expect it to be better than India Diner on the Southside or India Sizzling on the Northside? No, I expected it to be on-par... but it was not :(First off - Garlic Naan... I love this stuff... but it was full of cilantro. What? Cilantro on naan? Yeah. Second - the Chicken Tikka Masala contained mostly mediocre but tender chicken with a taste bearing an extreme resemblance to chicken nugget... minus the breading. Third - biryani... my favorite Indian dish spiced HOT. There was just too much going on with the biryani. Green beans, corn, potatoes, various meats, lots of onions, oh and cilantro... it was good but not on par with the other biryani... hard to explain what exactly was wrong about it.

The standard Butter Chicken, Chicken Biryani, Chicken Vendaloo are all on point. I think my current favorite is the mango chicken. Slightly spicy with a sweet twang. Their samosas are really good too. Ask for mango chutney to go with them. You won't be disappointed. They make a tasty mango lassi and also serve Indian beers and wine. We've had the merlot a couple times and have really enjoyed it. I don't even like Merlot, but the one they serve is hard to pass up. The little sugar syrup donuts are soooo good. The rice pudding is also worth trying. Oh, and some of the best garlic naan we've ever had.We have not had a bad experience. This food actually has flavor and they will provide you with the right level of spice. So many places tone spice down for American pallets. Not here. You get what you ask for and I love that. The owners are always on-site and very personable. They only offer a buffet for lunch - no menu ordering. We tend to lean toward menu ordering so have only had the buffet once.

We stood by a hostess stand for several minutes with no one speaking to us, then finally just wondered up to a woman and asked if we just seat ourselves. She gestured towards a table and walked away. We finally just went up to the buffet and after bringing our plates back had to ask for water, napkins, and naan.

I was missing an item from my order (not the end of the world, but given we were the only customers at the time, disappointing they overlooked it).

Very disappointing for $35.However, that was only the beginning. The next morning my boyfriend and I both woke up extremely sick to our stomachs. That having been the only meal we shared together all day (and a rather suspicious one at that), it was undoubtedly the culprit.

I also pointed out to the waiter that two buffet items were over and needed refill - tandoori chicken and chicken tikka masala. I waited for 15 minutes and was not served any tandoori roti. I also checked but neither the tandoori chicken or the chicken tikka masala were refilled. I also noticed that another item rasmalai was empty. When I pointed this to the manager, he said that they cannot do anything. At 2:25, after 25 minutes of wait I still did not have any tandoori roti to eat. As a result I told the manager that I am not able to eat any food since indian food needs to eaten with the roti. The manager started arguing rudely and said they cannot serve anything after 2 PM. He also used derogatory words saying that this is your bad mentality. When I said I would not like to pay for the buffet since I did not get to eat most of the items, he refused.

He asked me how I heard about Chapati and encouraged me to leave a review even if I didn't like the food.I was told that the Beef Behari is the most difficult dish/meat that they have here. I opted for the wrap version when I came here for lunch. It was good but I wasn't that impressed. All the meat was on one end of the wrap instead of being spread throughout. I happened to start on the non-meat end and kept wondering if they had left out the meat or if I got the wrong order. I think it would have sucked if I started on the meat end..The meat itself was very good and flavorful. However, because it's already so flavorful, I felt that the pickles that came inside the wrap did not complement it. I was also a bit disappointed that I got onions even when I specifically asked for no onions.Overall, it was decent. I would definitely want to come back and try their other dishes.

As soon as I moved to Indianapolis, I looked for the restaurants in the evening and this was the only place which offer dinner buffet. I dropped in this place for dinner with my friend and needless to say, the restaurant was smelling all curry and I loved the aroma. They were still setting up the dishes for the dinner buffet but they told us to grab the plates and hog on! We were like Hell Yeah !! Let's do it !The items on the buffet were great. I think it was a huge spread but it's quite common if you drop into an Indian restaurant for buffet. There was two kinds of soup - chicken soup and tomato soup which I didn't try. I always recommend people to stay away from soups at Indian restaurants. Moving on.. There was my favorite South Indian food - Vada [ pro tip: they look like small donuts but they are not sweet] , and they were awesome, I had almost 10 of them. There were four kinds of chutneys, every chutney was perfect. They had delicious sambar too. \u00a0[pro tip : you generally have Vada's with chutney and sambar. Especially coconut chutney] They had Potato fry [aloo fry], egg plant curry, panner makhani [paneer butter masala], veg Manchurian and couple more vegetarian dishes. They all were fantastic.Coming to the non- vegetarian section, they have chicken makhani [chicken butter masala], lamb curry, tandoori chicken, chicken dum biryani. I didn't try the lamb curry but the chicken dum biryani was great. [pro tip: add some chicken makhani to your chicken biryani rice and have it, it's so yummy]. The tandoori chicken was not so great. I don't understand why several Indian restaurants get this dish wrong. They add plenty of food color which spoils the taste of the dish and make it look red and dark pink in color. It's ridiculous. Please get this right!! They had carrot halwa, couple of ice creams and fresh cut fruits in the desserts section. They serve any kind of naan and roti and Dosa's at your table if you tell the server. [pro tip: Dosa is a South Indian dish and they look little like pan cakes and some people even refer them as Indian pan cakes. And again they are not sweet like pan cakes.

My daughter asked for a mango lassi (they were out ), pop (they were out).They were out of samosas as well. The chaat that they brag about was a too sweet-too salty over cooked fruit chaat, totally inedible. Finally, after a below average meal, I went up to pay. It cost above $50. I had an online coupon for $5 off $30 fare. The bored manager said that they needed a paper coupon, so they refused it. Not coming back. Ever. This was Sunday lunch at around 12 noon.

The food of Pakistan is not all that different from the food of India, but with the addition of beef.

Lamb or goat biryani (seasoned rice with meat), tender delicious beef in spicy sauce, goat in sauce, lamb in sauce, and very spicy chili chicken for carnivores. Naan flat bread was available as well as gulab jamun (pastry-cheese balls in honey syrup) for dessert, and raita (yogurt sauce) along with tamarind or mint chutney. My favorites were the beef dish and the palak paneer. The mint chutney was especially good. Everything was hot, fresh, and yummy. I had to talk myself out of going back to get a 2nd heaping plate of food. There are also kebabs on the menu, which I would like to return to try.

There used to be an ice-cream shop I adored in this plaza (moment of silence for Strawberry Hill!) so I zoomed back here for nostalgia for my 80's childhood, when Lafayette Square was still a mall that people shopped at. I noticed the restaurant and saw lots of cars in the lot and (I thought) it was the only business open, and the sign outside advertised a Sunday buffet that seemed reasonably priced, so I got happy and jumped out my car. The door was open, but there wasn't a soul to be seen once I got inside. Two men wandered in from the back, and seemed annoyed that I was there. The promised buffet wasn't opened, but looked to be one steam table of maybe 4 selections. Once I asked about eating, one of the guys finally gestured for me to take a seat and handed me a photocopied menu. I'm not a menu snob, because some of the best food I've eaten has come from the strangest places ever, but it seemed like he skipped over an actual menu. I thumbed through it, looking for some Pakistani food, but it seemed to be standard Indian fare. I settled on veggie samosas, chicken tikka masala and a mango lassi, and after the man finally took my order, told me he didn't have samosas or any lassi. I started to get up and he said, \"I can fix the tikka masala!\" Understandable, but everyone knows that samosas cure all ailments. I bid them farewell and went back to my car, and noticed that the daycare at the end of the strip mall was open 24/7, and that most of the cars probably belonged to their staff. Hey, the food could've been rocking here, but I guess I'll have to come back to find out.

Our last time ordering dinner takeout, we went to pick up our food and went along our way. Halfway home, we received a call that they'd given us the wrong order and asked us to come back.

That was from our first buffet visit. This time, we actually stopped in to grab an order of goat biryani for a night in. I didn't feel like chicken or lamb, since we were having lamb the next day.

It was quite filling, so much so that we did not try any of the desserts.

Hope to come back here whenever we are in town!"], ["Mike F.", "Indianapolis is beginning to stand out as a city that has wonderful Indian restaurants. \u00a0Spice Nation, one of the city's newer additions, certainly serves that reputation well. \u00a0I first heard of the restaurant when they hosted a Yelp Elite event that I was not able to attend. \u00a0While I eat at Spice Nation's neighboring Indian restaurants several times per month, I simply seemed to ignore it. \u00a0Ignorance isn't always bliss.I may have subconsciously avoided Spice Nation because they do not serve meat. \u00a0I'm the quintessential omnivore. \u00a0I like meat; I like vegetables, and I especially like a mixture of the two. \u00a0Spice Nation is a vegetarian establishment with a large selection of vegan options. \u00a0I thought that I would be dissatisfied with a meatless meal; I was worried that I would be craving protein, and I figured that I would still be hungry once I finished eating. \u00a0Wrong, wrong, and wrong. \u00a0The buffet at Spice Nation is plentiful, and there was certainly no shortage of food. \u00a0My worries about not being full? \u00a0Nixed. \u00a0Sure, there isn't any meat, but there are plenty of protein-packed lentils, chickpeas, and paneer. \u00a0Another worry abrogated. \u00a0At the end of my meal, I was sinfully stuffed.Spice Nation is a buffet with an interesting twist: they change their daily offerings based on different Indian themes. \u00a0On my visit, I sampled Southern Indian dishes. \u00a0However, the night previous to my visit, the restaurant featured Indochinese cuisine. \u00a0The night following my visit was an Indian street-food theme. \u00a0With this kind of variety, one could eat at this restaurant daily--and their wallets wouldn't suffer. \u00a0Spice Nation is very reasonably priced.I adored nearly everything I tasted at Spice Nation. \u00a0However, although simple, the cabbage and mixed vegetable poriyal was my favorite. \u00a0It was light, full of taste, and quite healthy. \u00a0The channa saag was excellent and was properly spiced. \u00a0Once of my other favorite dishes was the pongal, which is a mixture of lentils and rice. \u00a0It looks like mashed potatoes, but tastes even better. \u00a0The garlic naan and the dosa that arrive freshly prepared on your table were phenomenal! \u00a0Don't be a wuss. \u00a0Order the dosa Indian hot. \u00a0When dining at Spice Nation, be sure to save room for dessert; there is plenty of it. \u00a0My personal favorites were the mohantaag and the rice kheer. \u00a0As a big fan of these desserts, I declare that Spice Nation's versions are the best that I have yet to try.The service at Spice Nation was fantastic. \u00a0We were seated immediately, and had two waiters who catered to our every need. \u00a0I was also pleased that the staff was enthusiastic about explaining the menu and the methods their chefs use in preparing the food.Well done, Spice Nation. \u00a0Very, very, very well done."], ["Prashanth R.", "Excellent food and service. Been there twice. Once for lunch and other time for dinner. Highly recommend this place for some yummy authentic indian vegetarian food. I am in Bloomington and will definitely visit the next time I go to the city."], ["Ayla W.", "I like the restaurant. It's not the best I've ever had... However it's ok. When trying to find it, it seems strange because it's a little strip mall inside."], ["Rebekah P.", "Great price for great food. \u00a0I lived in South India for a year, so eating here brought back good memories.Pros-good dosas, chat bar, and good entrees in the buffet..Cons-Idyls were a little dense and the tea was weak. \u00a0I expected sweet milky coffee from a South Indian place."], ["Brittany S.", "As I sit here thinking about the Spice Nation lunch I am about to eat in the next hour, I felt I must remind you how much I adore this place.5 Reasons that stand out today regarding my SN adoration:-coconut rice: be it on the buffet or not - order it.-unlimited chai-friendly staff-hot and fresh galub jamon-little corn fried and spiced as an appetizer (must try!)"], ["Fakke N.", "This place is the best. I had been curious about Spice Nation for a while, but had not tried it until a couple months ago because my husband thinks he can't survive without eating meat every day. My brothers vegan girlfriend came to visit, so I figured I finally had my chance. The guy asked if we were vegan and immediately brought out every vegan thing they had for my brothers lady. She was so impressed she wanted to go back before she left. The guy remembered us and brought out all the vegan food for her again. Spice Nation is now my husbands favorite restaurant!!"], ["Johnny L.", "Thanks for the directions. Its straight forward as they are at the end of the hallway on the rightOnce i got over the language issue as the waitress doesn't seem to speak much english the rest was easyA Thali platter which came with rice, 3 curries, potatoes, chana masala, and a litlle Gulab Jalum ball for dessert and your choice of naan, roti r chapata bread \u00a0$10I also had the spicy cauliflower appetizer $4A Mango lassi is a must to tame the heat $3It was a delicious meal. I would have expected the potatoes to have been more crispierService was a bit odd, as those who came after me got their Thali's before I did. After the third table got served, I was like WTF , have I been forgotten?So great food but they need to be more attentive to service.The Chef Hintin has been cooking Indian food in restaurants for over 15 years so he knows how to run a restaurant.I would look to come back to try the buffet.From what I understand this may be the only Indian vegetarian restaurant in INDY"], ["Brittany L.", "I used to go to this restaurant for lunch once a week or once every 2 weeks as it's pretty close to my office. The food was always amazing and the service was just as good. However, something has changed. I went for carryout back in...mid-October, I believe. Whenever I get Indian carry-out I order the Palak Paneer or Saag Paneer...creamy spicy spinach with cubes of cheese in it. The staff was being weird. I ordered and he said \"Palak paneer is chickpeas...are you sure that's what you want?\" Well, palak paneer is NOT chickpeas. Chickpeas are channa. He made me order my food in English \"Spinach with cheese cubes\" and then said, \"Ooooooh. I didn't think you really wanted chickpeas. Do you want naan?\" I said I didn't. \"Are you sure? Naan is bread. Everyone wants bread.\" No...I do not want bread. So weird! I brought the food back to the house, it smelled fantastic, and opened the container. What I had was unlike ANY palak/saag paneer I've ever seen:Thin dark green sauce, about the consistency of water, with about a dozen clear squares of onion floating on top. When I stirred it, the cheese cubes came up from the bottom. There was no spinach! I've eaten this dish, from this restaurant, probably close to 2 dozen times. It has never, ever looked like this. Usually I can eat it from the box, with a fork, and skip the rice if I want to. This was seriously like spicy spinach-flavored water. I was so hungry and was like SAD that I was going to be eating rice and cheese cubes without any creamy yummy spinach...and that I'd paid $10 for this! I went back to the buffet one more time after the carry-out fiasco and found the options lacking and the food not quite where it should have been temperature-wise. The chutneys were also thin and watery on this visit, the tea was out the entire time, and I never received my dosa. Hopefully these 2 experiences were anomalies and they get back on the ball soon."], ["Angie L.", "The food is great, not extraordinary but definitely great Indian. \u00a0What puts this place over the top for me? \u00a0Hands down, the best customer service I've experienced at any restaurant in Indianapolis!"], ["Andy S.", "This place is awesome. I LOVE meat and i did not miss it during this lunch. \u00a0Unlike other Indian lunch buffets I've been to, the dishes aren't \"dumbed down\" for mass consumption. \u00a0Plenty of spice, which was great. \u00a0Naan is made to order and was really good. \u00a0There's nothing better on a cold day \u00a0than sipping on some chai regretting how much I just ate :)"], ["Krista R.", "Definitely a refreshing take on Indian food for Indy, and lunch buffet with unlimited chai is a steal at $6.99. Temperature of buffet items should have been a bit hotter, spice levels for many foods could have been increased, and amount of fried items seemed exorbitant... But nonetheless we enjoyed our lunch a lot!Spice Nation specializes in South Indian vegetarian foods, mostly featuring Tamilian foods. (The cooks are from the Indian state of Tamil Nadu). Foods we sampled in the lunch buffet and also brought to table upon request included oothappam, chapatti, idly, dosa, rice, dal tadka, rasam, sambhar, eggplant curry, kidney bean and chickpea curry, vada, pickles, various chutneys, curd, mushroom manchurian, vegetable korma, bitter gourd curry, vegetable fried rice, and naan. The server said the lunch buffet changes daily. Some vegetarian items I would have loved to see included on the buffet: papads, more dosas, samosas, parotas, poori, a paneer dish or 2, a bhindi/okra curry, mango lassi. Also, I'd love to see some Indian foods from other southern regions!! Keralan vegetarian options, Goan vegetarian foods and some Chettinad vegetarian choices \u00a0would be tasty. Spice Nation you can do it!!The server told us that the Friday night dinner buffet has more South Indian foods, Saturday night they do Indo-Chinese foods (gobi and mushroom manchurian, etc), and Sunday they feature chaats (snacks) like bhel puri, panni puri, etc.Service was great - we asked if we could skip naan and get chapati instead and the server went to check. Recommend SN for those who seek vegetarian and vegan Indian food not generally found in Indy's India Garden/Shalimar type restaurants."], ["Shoshana K.", "The music selection is particularly over bearing this evening....the restaurant was 98% empty of dining in customers (some people were stopping by for carry out). \u00a0However for those of us choosing to indulge in our dinners in-house, the music was too loud and annoying. \u00a0If no one is in the restaurant, blast whatever the heck you want! \u00a0Otherwise, it would be prudent to be more sensitive to your diverse customer's ear drums and tastes in music and play something less bollywood club-o-phonic decibel pumping tunes.....The food took FOR EVER to get to our table. \u00a0There were only two other tables in the restaurant w/customers dining in while we were there so I don't know what they were doing back there in the kitchen! \u00a0Once the food came out it was delicious, freshly made, and perfect. \u00a0It seemed the items we chose had been prepared when we ordered them and not fished out of a vat of previously made food for a large buffet crowd. \u00a0Don't get me wrong - the first time we tried this place out we had their buffet (on \"indian street food night; Sunday) and it was fabulous! \u00a0So, it was comforting to taste that the dishes we picked this evening seemed to be made when we picked them and not prior....The mango lassi is great.Prices are reasonable; for two (and one of the two of us is a bottomless pit...) we ordered stuffed naan (onion), paneer tikka, and aloo gobi. \u00a0We cleaned the platters and were stuffed. \u00a0Had we ordered anything else we would have taken a doggy bag with us (not such a bad thing, but just pointing out that three items fed us plenty). \u00a0It was less than $30 w/tip - score!"], ["Lisal F.", "Oh Spice Nation, how I adore you. \u00a0This entirely vegetarian Indian restaurant is hidden away near Lafayette Square and has the BEST buffet I've ever experienced. \u00a0Indian food in general is quite vegetarian-friendly, but Spice Nation takes amazing vegetarian cuisine to a whole new level. \u00a0There is always something new and delicious and their Chai tea (which is included in the buffet price, along with unlimited naan and dosas) is to die for. \u00a0I've never felt the need to order off the menu simply because the buffet is so bountiful and delicious.Other perks: \u00a0plenty of parking, great service, and there is a lovely Indian market in the same building that sells basmati rice in bulk, spices, and a mix of other eclectic items."], ["Nessie V.", "Excellent buffet in a little cluster of subcontinental businesses in Indian-apolis. \u00a0All veg, and the vegan items are labeled as such. \u00a0I also appreciated the abundance of nonstandard dishes available, though they did have a few favorites up there. \u00a0Will go again."], ["Trena T.", "Favorite favorite favorite.This is far and away our favorite spot to grab lunch during the week. \u00a0It's tucked away in a strip mall and can easily be confused with the Indian restaurant next door. \u00a0They both have signs sitting out on the sidewalk. \u00a0It can also be confusing because you don't walk directly into the restaurant. \u00a0You go in the front door, down a hallway, past a salon (??? I've never really paid attention, but I'm pretty sure that's what is there), and almost into a small grocery store before you get to Spice Nation's entrance.The price is great (for lunch OR dinner) and the food is awesome. \u00a0It's all vegetarian, with some vegan options. \u00a0There are always a variety of spice levels, which is nice. \u00a0Different days feature different regional cuisines. \u00a0Neither my husband nor I are vegetarian, but we both LOVE this place and never walk away feeling dissatisfied. \u00a0The service here is excellent, friendly and prompt. \u00a0Make sure you get the tea while you're there."], ["David P.", "Amazing amazing. All the naan (3kinds) and dosa (like 6 kinds) you can eat with buffet. And they make fresh for your table. They ask if your vegan when you sit down. Buffet was great about 15 entrees. 4 desserts all great. Liked better than Devon street."], ["Chad B.", "As a lover of Indian food I thought I had the local go to best in Indy location until I tried Spice Nation. They have completely ruined not just other Indian restaurants but basically all dining experiences I have ever enjoyed. From the menu options to the buffet choices, you can't go wrong. They have the best samosas I have ever put in my mouth, and there have been quite a number of them in my past but from here on out I don't see any being able to compare. Even with everything being vegetarian and myself being a proud eater of animals of all types, I truly don't miss the meat at all. The staff are amazing and by far the best service I have ever had while dining out in Indy or any place for that matter. I have never had a place offer to make me something that was not being offered on the menu let alone not even take the money for such item because they just wanted to make sure they made my meal the best experience they could. Truly the creme DE LA creme of dinning experiences in the indy area."], ["Lacey U.", "Come for the lunch buffet. \u00a0It's worth it!This is probably the best Indian Food I've found in Indiana. \u00a0It's completely vegetarian which is what I usually prefer when eating Indian food. \u00a0The dishes were spiced perfectly! \u00a0I like a little bit of heat and the few of them were spiced as such but it wasn't too much that I couldn't enjoy the spices. \u00a0There were several dishes and each one was completely different than the next. \u00a0The service was great, they were prompt and kept my water glass full and the table clear of dishes.I usually shy away from buffets because the food is always sitting and gets that weird shine on the top - NOT HERE. \u00a0They were very attentive to the dishes and were kept fresh. \u00a0This is definitely worth every penny and I can't wait to go back!Check out the grocery next door as well!"], ["Little R.", "Went to this place based on the highly positive reviews-- big mistake! My husband and I love Indian food but this is the worst we have had. First of all, we asked for the menu instead of having the buffet, the owner insisted that we have the buffet--weird. We stayed despite the uncomfortable feeling. The food in the buffet is NOT FRESH at all, almost like they were about to go bad and then were made into deep dried stuff and curry. Two dishes we had (deep fried potatoes and cauliflowers) were COLD. We decided to leave immediately and go to another place. Although we barely ate anything, not to mention having any service at all, the manager charged us the full fare and automatically added a high percentage of tip. If it is an option, I would give NO STAR based on the very poor food quality, unreasonable price for this kind of food, and bad service."]]}
