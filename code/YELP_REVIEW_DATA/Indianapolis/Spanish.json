{"Taste of Havana Cuban Sandwiches": [["Sabrina S.", "I just wanted to write a quick review and boost my 4 star rating to 5. This place is such a fabulous spot for a quick, inexpensive bite. I love the family vibe I get when I'm in here.My go-to order is the cubano especial to share with my husband, a guava cream cheese pastry, and a cafecito to top everything off. I have got to come back and try some of their daily specials, but I just cannot manage to say anything other than \"CUBANO SANDWICH\" when I am at the register. It's like my stomach takes over all power of the brain when I order. This, my friends, is Cuban witchcraft!"], ["Bill J.", "Great food, fast and friendly service. \u00a0I'm looking forward to trying other items on the menu, first time around I went with the standard Cuban and it was excellent. \u00a0Minus one star because when I went back the the 2nd time I discovered that they are closed on Monday.Seems a little strange for a restaurant on the Broad Ripple strip to be closed on Monday, but oh well."], ["Ryan T.", "They call me Cuban Pete. I'm the king of the rhumba beat.When I play the maracas I go chick-chicky-boom, chick-chicky boom. Holy moly was this place good! \u00a0I just moved to an office in the Broad Ripple area and having this place so close to the office could be dangerous. \u00a0I went with the good ol fashion Cuban sandwich. \u00a0They come in 3 sizes. \u00a0At first I thought $10 was a little steep... But once I unwrapped this magical piece of Heaven I realized how big it was and PACKED with meat! \u00a0Well worth the $10. I will be back often! \u00a0The owner was also a pretty cool guy and you could tell that he really had passion and love for his food and customers!"], ["Kaela V.", "I have had Taste of Havana on my radar for a while after hearing rave reviews from friends. \u00a0I finally paid a visit today and loved it! \u00a0I had a regular cuban sandwich and it was delicious. \u00a0Besides the high quality sandwich, I loved the friendly atmosphere in the shop and enjoyed getting to know the owner, George. \u00a0It was clear that he strives to create a positive experience for every customer. \u00a0There was a lot of foot traffic when I was there, and although they were out today, there were a lot of requests for the coconut flan---So, next time I am in I am definitely ordering that local favorite!"], ["Pete F.", "Let's start off by saying right when you walk in the door you feel like you are on vacation. \u00a0The owner and employees are some of the nicest people on earth. \u00a0We got the Cuban sandwich and the Cuban with turkey. \u00a0We got the medium sandwiches and they were huge. \u00a0My wife and I each only eat half. \u00a0They were both good sandwiches and every person in the restaurant seamed very pleased with there meal. \u00a0The best part of our meal was the small shot glass of Cuban coffee at the end. \u00a0They have a sign in there saying they have the best Cuban coffee in town, well I think the sign is wrong they probably have the best coffee in town period."], ["Derek S.", "My wife and I had been wanting to check this place out for a long time and finally got in for lunch today. We wish we would've tried it sooner.We both went with the regular-sized Cuban (when in Rome, right?). The sandwich was big enough for two portions, and that's not even the largest size they offer. \u00a0They were fantastic. \u00a0The pork and ham were juicy and the bread was fresh.She had the black bean soup and I had the yellow rice as sides. Both stellar, but I preferred the soup. As most have stated in here, it's a must-get.We're going back soon for the coffee and pastries!"], ["Chelsea R.", "GO HERE NOW. Right from my walk in the door, Taste of Havana had me. The friendliness of the staff, the smell of the amazing food, and the vacation-y feel had me planning my next trip here before I even tasted my food. I had the Pan Con Lechon and was not disappointed. The pork was so well marinated and cooked it melted in my mouth. I live in the area and will be a regular of this establishment!"], ["Beth W.", "Wow! The sandwich was so full of pork!!! Delicious authentic Cuban food. We ordered the Pan Con Lechon sandwich to share. It is an 8\" sandwich loaded with marinated roasted pork with cable mixed onions and mayo. Knowing what I know now, I would have ordered one of my own instead of sharing. The combo came with a side and a drink. Our side was sweet plantains, they cook the plantains in the oven instead of frying them.Very small inside dining area, some outside seating too. The food is amazing. I have several more dishes to try out. Take out was fast and easy to order."], ["Scot C.", "So after I watched the movie Chef, my foodie within was demanding that I seek out an authentic Cuban sandwich, immediately. \u00a0Much to my surprise - and dismay that I hadn't noticed it there before - I found Taste of Havana, in little old Broad Ripple. \u00a0Let's just say, Jon Favreau would be very pleased...Taste of Havana exudes authenticity; it has the look, feel, and vibe of a traditional Cuban sandwich shop that you would find (or otherwise imagine to be) in Cuba or southern Florida. \u00a0Family owned and operated, you know this place is making them right - from the meat to the mustard. \u00a0I will go out on a limb to proclaim this the best Cuban place in Indianapolis.The Cuban: beautiful cuts of ham and roast pork, melted Swiss and pickles, slathered with yellow mustard, all pressed on a Cuban bun to melted perfection. \u00a0Sides include sweet-fried plantains (my personal choice), black beans, or yellow rice. \u00a0The plantains are phenomenal. \u00a0They have plenty of other delicious-sounding offerings, but I cannot help but to order the Cuban every time.To cap off the authentic bit, Taste of Havana also has excellent espresso service and pastries. \u00a0Though I have not tried any of the sweet treats, I can say that the coffee is amazing, and goes quite well with your meal.This place has instantaneously turned into my new favorite Broad Ripple lunch spot, and for that I say: muchas gracias! \u00a0Hasta pronto!!"], ["Rob S.", "Best tasting Cuban sandwich you will find in Indiana. So get off your duff and go there already! Spicy bean soup, although not that spicy, is also delicious. The regular Cuban for $9.95 is a generous portion."], ["Steven M.", "So Tuesday after a long hard day at work, I decided to deprive myself of a snack after work and biked up to broad ripple, as I've had this place bookmarked since I came to Indy. So getting there around 7 and sweat drenched I was ready for a feast.The first thing I noticed is that this restaurant is quite small, only a few tables and a counter by the window. I noticed the couple in front of me added the special, which they were out of. They tried to order another meal which they were out of, I heard the owner mention that they have been so busy as of late that he has had trouble keeping everything in stock. That's a good problem to have, I thought to myself. I did hear the owner mention that the price of chorizo was down and they could have it on their Cuban that they ordered free of charge. Well of course I immediately picked up on that and ordered a medium Cuban with chorizo for $8.50 and mentioned to the owner that I like that sound when the cash register rings, he said he did too and we had a good laugh. I had a seat at the counter near the window and quietly waited while taking it all in. The owner, yet quite very busy, was moving around the siding room asking the patrons how there meal was. One guy said he got the wrong order, and the owner immediately comped it and brought the right thing. He even came over to me and asked me if I wanted coffee since I had been waiting for a while/that was a nice touch. \u00a0When I got my sandwich I quickly manhandled it into my already salivating mouth, I noticed that the pork loin was a bit dry, and I'm used to eating Cubans with no drink on the go. This was not the case with this one, and I went for the water. The chorizo was almost undetectable in the flavor. Maybe my expectations were too high because I recently came back from south beach, but the sandwich was just okay, and I was still hungry when I left.The owner was very nice and always did the right thing, and it sounded like there were a lot of variables that could have come into play here. So here's the breakdown. Customer service, 5. Wait, 3, food just a 3, and the fact that they were out of a lot of items brings this to a solid 3 overall. I'll go back and give it another shot on a different day of the week and possibly revise. I really want a place to get a good Cuban, could this be it? \u00a0Only time will tell."], ["Shaun L.", "Holy Jesus. \u00a0prob the best experience in my restaurant life. I walk in and get a serious gem of a 2 min history lesson on Cuban Cigars. This place become my favorite place for miles around before I even bit into this amazing pastalito de pollo.  Tastes like it just popped out of the oven. Perfectly flaky pastry. The chicken is deliciously flavored to cater to this mouth watering $3 piece of Cuban culture. The black bean soup pulls no punches. It's simple, wonderfully made and exactly what I didn't know I was looking for.Ask for the smoked jalape\u00f1o salsa. It complements the food on another level. You'll get it if you are a hot sauce person. This just become my 4/5 day a week coffee place. Thank you Jorge!"], ["Rick W.", "George and his staff not only make sure you are well fed, but also let you know how happy they are to have you as a guest. \u00a0The Cuban sandwich is one of the best I have ever had and I always think I should stop at half, but keep on eating until it is all gone!!! Black bean soup is love in a bowl. \u00a0Today I had the coconut and cream cheese pastry, lets just say, I could eat more than one of those."], ["Nolan H.", "Cool little spot right on Broad Ripple Ave. Sandwiches are great but it's really the staff that makes this place. The owner is super friendly and kept bringing us samples to taste and shots of espresso. Could use some more seating though, can get a bit tight."], ["S. T.", "Let me just say... I am not a fan of sandwiches. I figure I can make them at home and make them better. Taste of Havana sandwiches are hot and delicious, and their sandwiches are not run of the mill. They do not skimp on anything and the staff is super friendly. Would go back for the service alone.You get a shot of Cuban coffee when you are done with your sandwich, and you can tell the owner loves to make them for you.Will be back for sure!"], ["Loren P.", "This has become my Friday go to for lunch. I usually stick with the lechon con asado lunch bowl. It's amazing! Like comfort food in the middle of the day. It comes with black beans, rice, fried plantain, and this AMAZING bread. Once you've finished your meal, the owner brings you a cafecito (Cuban espresso shot). This is, by far, my favorite part of the meal. The location is tiny, so getting a seat can be tough, but it's definitely worth a try."], ["Susan B.", "This place is so cute! I loved the cuban sandwich, the black bean soup, and the service. I went with a friend for a late night bite, my first time there. It's not fancy, it's not trying to be... it's just good. In a world of chain restaurants trying to out-bland each other, it's nice to see a place take some paces out-of-step from the herd. Plantains!!!"], ["Nate B.", "Aye! Been waiting to try Taste of Havana forever and finally made good on it. I had to work late so I popped in for lunch; cute little Cuban Cafe vibe. On the recommendations of others I ordered El Regular with Black Beans... \u00a1Dios Mio! So freaking good.I'm a die hard Cuban sandwich fan, and this puppy met all my expectations. Tender pork, plenty of ham and cheese, and enough pickles, mustard and mayo to make it all meld together on a nice crunchy roll. I wish I could have taken a picture of the beans, but I dug in and there was no coming up for air once I was into them. Well cooked, well seasoned, truly they needed nothing. I can't wait to return and try more of the menu! Glad to have such a great place close in Broad Ripple."], ["Aaron B.", "Bring your appetite because the sandwiches are big and the flavor even bigger. \u00a0The Cuban coffee is strong the way I like it with a really good taste. You can't go wrong with any of the sandwiches. I really like that there are plantains hot and fresh for a little sweetness too. No wifi so you can enjoy talking to everyone."], ["Ron R.", "Thank you Yelp for getting this one right! \u00a0I've been seeing such great reviews for this little place in Broadripple and told myself that I have to try it \"one of these days\" \u00a0I finally had the opportunity to try it and took it.Boy....I'm glad I did! \u00a0Now I've only had 4 Cuban Sandwiches in my life, I typically try to only go for them when I know they are legit or made well because lets face it, a Cuban isn't THAT exciting right? \u00a0Taste of Havana made me change my tune on that one. \u00a0After ordering I wondered why it was taking so long. \u00a0I had one at the supposed original place in Miami and it was quick and tasted as expected, but here it was taking a while and I was the only person there at 1pm.When it came out, I was ravenous and also full of high expectations since the sandwich is $10.50. (big enough to share, but you wont want to)The flavors were big! \u00a0Something I was not used to in a Cuban. \u00a0The ham was delicious full carved ham that tastes as if it was marinated in something. The bread was perfect for the sandwich although I think a contract setup between this place and Amelia's might elevate this sandwich to the next level. \u00a0The pickles were perfectly long to fill the sandwich up. \u00a0I was a very happy camper taking bite after bite.They have other variations of the Cuban sandwich that I will try next time, but I wanted to try the original as my baseline for this place.I will be back!"], ["Pamela R.", "The restaurant is vibrant and staff is welcoming. We ordered the Picadillo with rice, Cuban sandwich and the guava cream cheese turnover for dessert. While we waited for our food, we were treated to a delicious brew of Cuban coffee-what a delicious sweet and robust shot of coffee!The food was fresh and authentic! I loved the sweetness from the raisins and brininess from the green olives in the Picadillo and richness of the meaty sauce with ground beef. The sandwich was good too with tender ham, pork and crispy bread. This place is a MUST visit in Indianapolis!"], ["Melody W.", "Taste of Havana is the best thing to happen to Broad \u00a0Ripple. The only negative thing I can say about this place is that it's sometimes hard to find parking. Other than that, the experience is really wonderful. The staff of Taste of Havana are incredibly nice, warm, welcoming people. They are helpful if you're new to their menu, and make great suggestions. The sandwiches are delicious. Fresh bread, delicious yellow rice, and homemade pastries. Every experience has left me feeling full, and oh so happy. While you wait for your food, which is made fresh to order, the staff will offer you a free shot of espresso. Cuban coffee is very rich and full of flavor. Take them up on the free shot. You will not regret it. If you enjoy delicious and flavorful ham and pork sandwiches, this is the place for you. So happy to have an authentic Cuban sandwich in Indy!"], ["Edward C.", "Another very good restaurant in Indy. I ordered \"The Cuban\" in mini size ($6.50). Perfect for me, as I don't like eating heavy. Bread was nicely toasted with a good, light crunch to it. Ham and pork were lean. Swiss cheese nicely melted between the meat. Definitely worth it. You have to try it! The small town feel and ambience is beautiful. Come here, put the phone down, and enjoy life!"], ["Sean W.", "First time visit and I will be back for more! I really did not know what to expect when I entered the tiny shop, but I was surprised in a good way when the owner immediately greeted us and asked if we were first timers. Our big eyes must have been the giveaway. My girlfriend and I went with his recommendations of the Roasted Pork Cubano (add tomatoes) and the Steak Cubano. We got sides of the yellow rice and spicy beans. The sandwiches were large and well worth the money. We could have probably just split one sandwich and the sides and been full. The owner saw me grab a bottle of sriracha and came over to tell us that he makes his own hot sauce that is similar to sriracha. I love hot sauce and was excited to try it. The hot sauce was smoky and had a similar heat to sriracha, but I liked his better. That may have been my favorite part.The sandwiches were both succulent, juicy, and filling. Both sandwiches were very tasty. They were exactly what we had been looking for. At the end we were given a complimentary shot of espresso that he had created himself. The atmosphere inside the restaurant was welcoming and warm. We will definitely be back!"], ["Stacy A.", "Being my husband and I travel to Central America (and hopefully one day to Cuba) we love authentic Latin cuisine. Our first visit we ordered the Cuban sandwich, black bean soup, platains, and cafe cubano. Each was delicious. We've gone back multiple times and have had consistent, delicious meals. The cost is an added bonus as you get decent portions. The interior is colorful, fun, and reminded us of a small cuban style restaurant we've been to in Guatemala.Kudos to you on keeping everything authentic. Broad Ripple -- please take note of this jem as we need more like it!"], ["Katrina D.", "When the boss is away, the kids will take a little bit longer lunch hour and venture to Broad Ripple to eat somewhere they've wanted to try for a long time! \u00a0I can't believe I didn't make it here sooner.I don't know which I liked better, the owner or the ham croqueta sandwich. \u00a0He was super friendly, making sure to talk to everyone and was happy he didn't have to deport anyone for not liking his food, which I don't think is possible.The sandwich was bigger than I expected and loaded. \u00a0There was more ham on it than I normally eat at Christmas dinner, yet at the end, I was somehow wanting more. \u00a0The black bean soup was the perfect side dish. \u00a0Pro tip: check out coupons4indy.com before you go!Can't wait til next time!"], ["Mike L.", "Don't know why it took me so long to try this place. \u00a0Best lunch I've had in B-ripp...probably Indy for that matter. \u00a0Cuban sandwich is just ridiculously good. \u00a0The coffee is fantastic. \u00a0Very small hole in the wall...but they produce magic here! \u00a0Appears to be family running the place...great vibe."], ["Tiffin S.", "Beware: having a guava and cream cheese pastelito (turnover) and cortadito (Cuban espresso and milk) will make a caffeine free person jittery all day, but it will be so worth it. (While I asked if they had decaffeinated coffee options, the answer was sadly no.) For the vegetarians, there are enough options. My niece had the vegetable sandwich while I had a veggie platter (select 3 items) with black bean soup and fried plantains (a double order is so worth it). And when you can't anymore, definitely buy some pastries to go (4 - 5 in a box make a unique gift for your foodie friend too).I liked the bright decor too. And the staff likes to laugh, which always makes for a great atmosphere!"], ["Alfonso D.", "Why not Cuban food in Indianapolis, when the most population are in Miami and Kentucky, I tried a steak sandwich, and was really good a little bit spicy for me but really good. The service is really good, I appreciate that from the staff, that made me happy. In the restaurant is no just the food is also the service and this place is perfect for that. Btw thanks to the owner for the recommendation and for explained to me about the menu."], ["Chris B.", "I was having dinner with friends in the food industry. They mentioned this amazing little place in Broadripple call Taste of Havana Cuban Sandwiches. My friend who is a chef said that it was the best Cuban sandwich he ever had, better than any he sampled in Miami. I had the opportunity to go there the next day and try it out. I was there when they opened (luckily as they started to get busy quite quickly). I ordered the Cuban sandwich with black bean soup. I was not disappointed, by far the best Cuban sandwich I have ever tried and one of the best sandwiches I can ever recall having. The owner, Jorge I believe, was incredibly friendly. He poured me several shots of complimentary Cuban coffee (which I will say had ruined me for any other coffee except possibly Ethiopian coffee). He also brought me guava and cream cheese pastry that words cannot describe. I have a new favorite place in Broadripple!"], ["Kim M.", "Perfect. Just perfect. Loved every bite, so full and satisfied. Sweet plantains are excellent, loved the pan con bistec and pan con lechon. Fast, friendly, tasty and all around good!!!"], ["Sonya A.", "Nom nom nom - que delicioso! The Cuban sandwich is best in town. The cortadito is perfection and the service is warm and friendly as I imagine Havana to be. And please try el pastelito de guava and cream cheese, God' gift to humans.Food - 5/5 Service - 5/5Location - 5/5"], ["Karen F.", "Wanted to try somewhere new and because of the favorable reports decided to try The Taste of Havana. There were four of us and we were so glad we did. It was GREAT! Would we go back? \u00a0In a heartbeat!!! \u00a0The owner was like a friend you had known for years and made our experience not just delicious but fun."], ["Matthew A.", "This place is great. The ambiance is a family run establishment with excellent and attentive service. The plantains, roasted vegetables, and black bean soup were all superb. The meat in the Cuban sandwich was tender and well seasoned. The mustard had a complementary to taste. The only negative I found about the sandwich was bread sogginess when tomatoes and lettuce are added. I think the tomato juice plus the sauce causes the bread to fall apart in pieces. I would omit the tomato from the sandwich (it's a non-traditional toppings anyway). The dining room is very small with only 2 four person tables and 2 counters with chairs. We had to eat outside on little tables with chairs facing the street. It can become quite crowded inside with hardly any room to move. Overall, I had one of the best and most satisfying Cuban sandwiches."], ["Dessa E.", "The owner was very nice. My husband and I shared a regular Cuban sandwich for lunch. We had told the owner that we got hooked on Cuban sandwiches on our honeymoon in Miami. He said this would be better than one from Miami. He was right. \u00a0It was so good. \u00a0The bread was just the right thickness, cheese was gooey, mustard wasn't overpowering and the ham and pork were very flavorful. Our sandwich was very filling. The sweet plantains were delicious. We will be back, for sure."], ["Mark D.", "It normally takes a lot for me to take the time to write a review, but this place is incredible. The food is off the charts good. \u00a0 We had some of the pastries and were impressed but the sandwiches were some of the best I've ever had. \u00a0I had the Pan con Lechon and my wife had the Pan con Bistec. \u00a0Both were full of flavor, tender, and large enough to satisfy. \u00a0 The meal was topped \u00a0off with a very unique espresso shot that made our trip to Broad ripple memorable. \u00a0 We can't wait to go back!"], ["Raquel S.", "I have been around since this place opened, and I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT! The owners: Awesome. They always have a smile on their face, and Jorge has some funny stories up his sleeve. \u00a0Food: Delicious and authentic! The vibe of this place makes you feel like family. I have literally had every.single.sandwich on the menu. Their classic cubano is great, but when I'm feeling starved I go for the havana yacht club. The portions are more than enough and I love trying their lunch bowls. Plus, I have never loved black beans and rice so much before (seasoned to perfection)The only downside is that the place can get a little crowded, but hey, that's what you get when you go to a place with great food. Did I mention they have cuban coffee? Not your traditional cafe' with sub par/watered down crap. This stuff is the real deal with a punch.Ok, stop reading and just stop in for yourself!"], ["Kristina P.", "Never would have thought that I would have the BEST Cuban sandwich ever in Indiana! Simple menu but the food is gonna take you directly to the streets of Havana! Owner and his daughter make a great team. They are both friendly and make you feel like you came to their house to eat dinner. Suggest the plantains to go along with the Cuban sandwich."], ["Ashley W.", "I have to admit we were a bit nervous about going here, not knowing much about Cuban cuisine. However, the owner immediately welcomed us and made some great suggestions. He even served us free coffees and offered to let a sample some of the desserts!! \u00a0The only downside is that the restaurant is rather small, with limited seating."], ["Krista R.", "Delicious food with great service. The owner is hoping to start serving breakfast soon.We were offered samples of the daily special (beef stew) and the black bean soup -- both were packed with flavor and obviously made with care.We split between us two sandwiches - Pan con Bistec (steak) and the Chorizo. Both were solid but the Chorizo had more flavor, for sure. The owner offered us two homemade sauces, one spicy chipotle and one milder cilantro. Both were excellent.High prices keep me from awarding that 5th star. I'm excited to see what the lunch specials will be on my next visit."], ["Michael D.", "The Cubans here are awesome. The price is not cheap but the food's quality fits the price. The owner is incredibly friendly. If he is not too busy he will make you some free coffee for after your meal. It gets busy around lunch and there is limited seating to be prepared to take it to-go. Also when available, ask for the Chipotle hot sauce it has an incredible taste with a solid kick."], ["John-Mark O.", "Incredibly friendly service! Free cuban espresso while you wait. Food here is extraordinary! I especially love the cafe Cubano and the sandwich de chorizo. The black bean soup and pastelitos."], ["Joseph O.", "Having lived in South Florida I have had amazing Cubano food and Taste of Havana is there with the best of them. It is a family run business and they welcome you into their family when you dine with them. I fell in love with Media Niche when I lived in Florida and I am more than satisfied every time I get one here. This is also the only place in Indianapolis that I enjoy coffee."], ["Allison F.", "I came in one weeknight and was sad to see that I was the only person inside.

You'll thank me later!"], ["Seth K.", "Love love love. \u00a0 \u00a0 This place us a great vibe with an authentic feel!! \u00a0 The free coffee is a major plus! \u00a0 \u00a0Definitely need to come back!"], ["Brian H.", "I went to Taste Of Havana on a whim because I was driving down Broad Ripple Ave hungry and there was a parking spot right in front of it. I was hoping to get a good sandwich and Taste Of Havana delivered in a real way. I went with a sandwich called El Cubano. I got $8.50 worth of roast pork, ham, swiss cheese, mustard and pickles. I liked it but if that doesn't sound like your thing they have 6-7 other sandwiches on the menu along with some soup. A beautiful thing happened to some fellow patrons while I was sitting at the bar in the window eating. One of them ordered something requiring baked vegetables but the veggies had just been put in the oven and were going to take a long time to cook so they ordered something else and everyone went on with their day, except the owner. When the veggies finished cooking he made them whatever it was they originally ordered and gave it to them for free along with a coupon for a free one when they visit again. Friends, they don't make customer service like that anymore."], ["Andy M.", "Taste of Havana is wonderful. And do you know what makes it that way....The family who owns it. The food was awesome. Some of the best Cuban food you'll find north of Miami. But the staff at Taste of Havana is what makes it a first class dining experience.  The decor is simple but pleasing to the eye. The Young Lady who served us made us feel welcome and told us about her family and the restaurant's history. She also let us try their homemade hot sauce that was as good as any I've tried. It was so good, my Wife took some of it home.  Taste of Havana's specialty is their Cuban Sandwich. Its as good as any I've tried. The ham and pork were both fresh and delicious. And I can't say enough about the homemade hot sauce. It accompanied the Sandwich perfectly. My only regret is we didn't get a chance to try the Maduros. They were out of them when we stopped in. No worries. I guarantee we'll be back. This place was so good that I will hit it up every time I'm in Indianapolis. Yes folks...It was that good."], ["John W.", "So we went here this afternoon Saturday July 25th for the first time. I wasn't sure what to expect but there were quite a few good reviews on here so we decided to give it a try. I have to say I was a bit worried as I am from Tampa Florida and anyone who knows much about that area knows that there a whole lot of Cubans living there and a lot of Cuban style restaurants there. So we get here and the first thing you should know is this neighborhood has no public parking so you will pay at the meter or get ticketed, we saw a half a dozen cars get a ticket in the hour we were there. They are not playing about feeding the meter, so you have been warned. I don't think that I would call this a restaurant, more like a shop. It is very small and can be very crowded. You order at the counter and they will bring the food out to you. They have like two tables to sit at and about 6 stools to sit in the window and people watch and then they have two outdoor tables. If you sit in the window you will have a line behind you as there is a line to order and a line where people are trying to use the fountain drink machine. PEPSI products, major bonus points!! So we both got the Turkey Swiss Cuban which comes with one side. I got the roasted veggies and the other person got the yellow rice. Both were pretty good. \u00a0The sandwich was large and cut in half and that was all I could eat was half of it. It was very tasty. I will say that while this was a damn good sandwich and we will most definitely be back. We then for dessert ordered the Plantains and a Strawberry Cream Cheese pastry and both were so amazing!! My only complaint about the pastry is they heated it on aluminum foil and the bottom of the pastry stuck to the foil so you could not eat that part as it would not come off. Bummer. Certainly was not for a lack of me trying. The staff was super friendly and welcoming. Next time we will go for the traditional Cuban Sandwich. What was funny is they had a sign by the register that said what they charge for people who complain etc, but the very last one which was the funniest was they charged $12,000 for non-cubans who came in and told them how to make a Cuban Sandwich. So while I will not presume to tell them how to make one as they made very tasty one, they are not even close to be as good at it as the Cuban Shops down in Tampa. The Cuban bread (one of my very favorite breads is much better in Florida)So why not 5 stars? No free parkingPlace is way too small for the masses they serveSo if you find yourself hungry and craving a really good Cuban sandwich this is the place to go. But if you are looking for the best Cuban sandwich in the world you will need to book you a flight to a place a little closer to Cuba and head on down to Tampa Florida and get you one there!!! \u00a0;-)"], ["KC S.", "Who knew you could find good Miami Cuban food in the Midwest? But the fact that this is a mom-and-pop restaurant working on the philosophy of good quality and gradients prepared with love individually for each customer.

I had the Cuban sandwich and wife had the Elena Ruth, both sandwiches were excellent and so were the borracho beans. Definitely give this place a try!"], ["Jennifer S.", "Sick of the same ole thing, I jumped on Yelp to find a lunch locale to meet a friend. \u00a0The 5 stars this new sandwich shop received in a few short months made up my mind, and what a great call it was! \u00a0 We both opted for the El Cubano, which comes in three sizes. \u00a0She choose a small, while I ordered a medium and the black bean soup. \u00a0They also had complimentary yucca chips that we both enjoyed. \u00a0My sandwich was nothing short of perfection, from the crispy bread to just the right amount of ingredients. \u00a0The soup was homemade and flavorful, with hot sauce available for those who prefer a little spice. \u00a0Other sides include plantains and rice, if you so desire.The owners made a point to check to make sure everyone in the restaurant enjoyed their lunch, even offering samples of their fresh Cuban coffee and pastries to those who declined the espresso. \u00a0I'd be short changing him if I didn't say it was the absolute best coffee I've ever tasted. \u00a0Truly delicious. \u00a0Cuban coffee is already sweetened, he shared. \u00a0The entire family was welcoming and hospitable, making for a relaxing spot to catch up with a friend over lunch. \u00a0There are several small tables and counter space, but this isn't a spot for a large group. \u00a0On the up side, they do have large sandwiches that can be carried out and they do cater!"], ["Stephane L.", "This is great food! Especially for the price. Had the pork roast and Havana yacht club. The roast is tender, juicy, and best of all, flavorful! The sandwich was good until I added some sriracha. That brought it to a new level. Of the two, though the roast wins the contest!"], ["Brad B.", "I'm from Miami and this place is legit! Best pan con bistec I've ever had and free cafecito's!"], ["David M.", "Went here today for the first time. I was curious how could they possibly make a sandwich that would be anything but ordinary. I found out after ordering the Cuban sandwich today. This sandwich was incredible all because of the bread. It wasn't thick and doughy, nor was it rip and tear material. It was more like the best thin crust pizza, both hot and crisp. It almost resembled a wrap, but it was definitely bread. Crisp thin bread! By far the best bread I've ever had on a sandwich. The cheese complimented it very well too. They also cut it diagonally so to begin eating one half you would have a pointed shape that was very appealing to start biting into. It was also very neat and held together very well. My only change I would make the next visit is to try the veggie sandwich on this awesome bread. For most meat lovers, the meat on this sandwich was generous. But for me with bread this good, I seemed to desire a little less meat, keep the cheese the same, and add more jalape\u00f1os, mushrooms, pickles, and mustard. The Cuban did have mustard and pickles, but just for me, not everybody, a bit too much meat. I still ate it all and left full. Next trip, I'm trying the veggie sandwich, because to me the bread is the most important reason for me to return. So I'm wanting what I believe will be the best compliment to the bread added inside that won't overstuff me. I also tried and loved the coffee here. A free shot came with the sandwich already sweetened of espresso. I also ordered a deluxe coffee drink cappuccino. It was made with a lot of love. I'll close by saying I very much loved the people serving me today. I'm a little partial to the mom and pop places and what a treat to be served by an authentic international eatery without having to go to any further than Broad Ripple."], ["Jon C.", "I wrote my first review here only a few weeks after A Taste of Havana opened. I'm very pleased to say that, 5 months after being open, the place is busy every time I stop in. Even better: they might be busy, but they still treat everyone like they're the only customer in the place. I love coming here!I stopped in for lunch this afternoon and was lucky to get a table (They only have 4 plus bar seats.) My sandwich came out nice and fast and tasted delicious. Dessert: complimentary Cuban coffee - it'll give me the energy to keep running errands today!I've been here several times since they opened and everything is consistently delicious. Great to have such a place in Broadripple. I wonder how I can convince George to open a larger, sit-down Cuban restaurant in the Circle City?"], ["Larry D.", "A family owned business that gets customer service. They understand the concept of under promising and to over deliver.

I'll definitely be back. They both had really great recommendations and I ended up getting dessert in the end as well which was very tasteful."], ["Connie B.", "By far my favorite place to eat!! As soon as you step through the door, you are met with bright colors and a laid back atmosphere. \u00a0The food is simply GREAT! \u00a0I enjoy Cuban food when in South Florida and this place beats every place in Miami I have been to. The plantains good to perfection, \u00a0the black bean soup full of flavor and The Cuban well it was so yummy. We got the Coconut Flan to go and it was beyond great. Great people, great coffee, great food!! Support this local eatery. The only thing I can hope is a bigger space but then again this little Havana is perfect!!"], ["Elisa K.", "Great service. A little packed but the lovely atmosphere of the owner makes it worth it. Free coffee for all also drives a big star on here!! And we haven't even got to the food yet. The pork bowl just melted in my mouth. The flavor was enchanting and rich. I would come back here everyday if I could!"], ["Erika P.", "I don't eat pork or beef, so when Zac wanted to try this Cuban place, I didn't think I would have any options. Let me tell you, El Veggio is a flavorful bundle of goodness you have to try! For a little extra kick of savory surprises try the pinto beans. They are cooked in beer. The location is small, so best to go in the middle of the week or plan to take it to go. The owner is super friendly, so I think we'll be back."], ["Captain R.", "I had the Cubano sandwich and to be completely honest i was very disappointed. I would say that it was slightly better than a gas station ham and cheese sandwich. The bread was very tough and chewy, which is completely opposite of true Cuban bread. The roasted pork was flavorless and bland. I was hoping for a delicious treat instead i was completely let down."], ["Mike S.", "Taste of Havana is my favorite restaurant in Broad Ripple. The food is always cooked perfectly, fresh, and served with good conversation from two really friendly and inviting people. If you can't make to Broad Ripple to try all of their delicious foods, consider them to cater your next event. When we decided to throw a 40th birthday party we immediately knew Taste of Havana was the place we wanted to cater. Dayana and Jorge were very helpful and professional throughout the entire process. From planning the menu to delivery and setup of the food. Both were very detailed and easy to work with.A week before the party they even came to the house, on their only day off to review set-up options and backup options in case it rained (party was originally planned outside, day of the party it rained)We ordered food for 30 people. Tray of various sandwiches, the crock-tail (2 foot long 3 pound sandwich), roast pork, yellow rice, black bean, plantains, roasted vegetables, various pastelitios (Cuban Pastries), a coconut flan and a vanilla flan. Everything was cooked perfectly, prepared fresh and arranged on the tables just as planned. \u00a0Jorge even entertained our guests telling story's and history of the foods as he set up. Our guests loved every bite and listening to Jorge. It felt like they brought their entire restaurant to our house. Will use them again to cater our next party!"], ["Chesela S.", "I love this place! \u00a0I work in the area and decided I wanted something a little different than my normal. This place delivered. I love plantains, so I was thrilled to see that was an option for a side. The smallest Cuban sandwich they had was the perfect size for me!If you want a quiet place for lunch, this is definitely not the place to go. But that's ok with me."], ["Ashley S.", "I love a cuban sandwich and this place hit the spot! Love having a small cute cuban place so close to home! The pork is tender and the portions are very generous. I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu!"], ["Brittany S.", "Yelper Jon C said I had to check it out- so, check it out I did. Interestingly located on the main party drag in Broad Ripple, Taste of Havana brings a breath of fresh air and culture to an otherwise 10p-3a atmosphere. The highlights: -if you're a fan of Cuban Sammies this is supposedly the place to get them. They are served in three sizes. (A vegetarian option is also available). I personally haven't tried them yet but...next time.-my order recommendations: delicious black bean soup (offered in cup and bowl options), plantains and last, but definitely not least- the pork wings. You heard me, pork wings. Juice tender meat served with a mole-type of sauce. -the sweet stuff: if you saved room for dessert, there is plenty to go around- tres leches, guava-based croissants and if you're lucky, the co-owner, George, will bring around tasty complimentary Cuban coffee to your table. All in all, a tremendous business and excellent addition to Broad Ripple. This is the kind of eatery where the owners will get to know you by name and smother you with feel good vibes."], ["Norma M.", "I've never had Cuban sandwiches before but after seeing the reviews on here I HAD to try it. We're here for the Indy Burn tournament from Wisconsin and let me say it was the best part of our trip so far, besides the soccer of course.

Loved meeting the owner who is an excellent host. Will be back!"], ["Presto F.", "By far one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. Totally worth what you pay. I got the Cuban Yacht Club sandwich to split with a family member and it filled both of us up without a problem. She didn't even finish hers it was so big. The owner was super friendly and greeted us right as we walked in. It was fun because all the while he would have conversations with people in the restaurant. Finally, after our meal he gave us free shots of Cuban espresso! Let me tell you, that was the best coffee/espresso that I have had probably my entire life. I have traveled all over the world and no espresso has ever come close to tasting better than this did. I could drink gallons of this stuff. I would HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone for its amazing atmosphere and food!"], ["Diana H.", "The staff were very friendly and the food is great. I have visited twice this weekend! I had the Maduros, which are fried plantains, an order of their seasoned yellow rice, and a cup of their black bean soup. My husband had the Yacht Club sandwich, and my FIL has the Cubano Regular. All of us enjoyed our food, and my daughter and I have since returned, two days after our first visit! We definitely will be back!"], ["Dan B.", "This... This is what it's all about. Independent, local 5 star food at a bargain. The service is phenomenal and everyone is super friendly. I've been looking for a great Cuban in this town for years and now I have a go-to spot! The black bean soup was delicious, as well. Not over-spiced, the beans were the star. There are a lot of great choices for vegetarians and some for vegans, too. I really love that the owner will make you a Cubano shot of espresso after your meal."], ["Anja F.", "What a fantastic find! The owner and his daughter had us cracking up the entire time we were in there. Such a sweet and hilarious family. The Moros y Cristianos (yes...no, it's not a very PC name but that's what black beans and rice is called en Havana) were SO tasty! They sell out of the specials really quickly so if you can't get in there early call ahead to ask them to set some aside for you. Or just order a Cubano. Or carnittas. And get the plantains. And just slow down and enjoy life for a bit.

We try to go when the offering has some variety, like two different options for your meal, or when it's something I haven't had before or at least would be hard to find at another restaurant.

To say my meal was only incredible would fall short! Everything was prepared perfectly, From the salad to the sea trout and lamb, to the amazing dessert! \u00a0The bread pudding made with Heath bar and caramel and who knows what secret ingredients were added in, was probably one of the best desserts I've had in a very long time, let alone being only the second bread pudding I know I will continue to talk about! \u00a0This was my first experience here and I will without hesitation be back!

That is what you should expect from Recess. First, the ambiance is very cool. It has a old school cafeteria meets a modern industrial feel. Not the typical style you may find in a normal fine dining establishment. \u00a0Secondly, \u00a0the wait staff is amazing. They know their food. The menu changes daily and our server knew every element of each dish without hesitation, quite impressive. Third, the food and drink....Unbelievable. Recess has a very limited cocktail menu and a nice beer and wine selection. I chose the margarita, which was so smooth, I questioned whether or not there was tequila in it. After my second, there was no question that there was definitely a generous amount of tequila. \u00a0We had two options for our first course. I went with the crudo and my husband chose the white turkey chili. We shared bites and the crudo was superior. Our next course was easily one of the best things I have ever eaten. It was fluke in a poblano broth with diced butternut squash. The slight spice in broth with the sweetness from the squash was out of this world and the fish was cooked to perfection. Our next course was my husband's favorite. Beautifully braised lamb with root vegetables. Again perfection with such depth of flavor. The dessert course was very creative. Again chose from two and my husband and I shared bites. He had a more savory dessert, pears with Bleu cheese and honey. I had an almond cake with buttermilk ice cream a rooibus tea pickled fruit. All three elements separately were a bit off, but as soon as all three were eaten together, it was so balanced and delicious. Not overly sweet. Although, \u00a0I was definitely not full after my meal, I was satisfied. I felt like the personal care that was given to the menu and each dish was remarkable. Recess also went above and beyond to accommodate my sister's food sensitivity, \u00a0as she is expecting. If being adventurous and trying unique foods with a daily changing menu sounds enjoyable, \u00a0then you will love experiencing Recess. I give Recess a well deserved 5 stars."], ["Erin Q.", "I finally got to experience Recess as part of Chowdown Midtown! \u00a0They were featuring a 3-course version of their typical fare, and the cost per person was $40 (without drinks or any wine pairings).Round 1 was a phenomenal salad of mixed greens, queso fresco, cilantro, radishes, and avocados tossed in a citrus pear vinaigrette. This stole the show for me. It was light and flavorful, and paired nicely with my sage smash margarita. Round 2 was a whitefish dish, with chanterelle mushrooms, bacon, and a fried onion ring. Besides the fish, which was cooked with the skin on, the meal was pretty bland. The brown butter Dijon sauce was undetectable, so I was left a bit disappointed. My dining partner had the beef, and it looked much more savory. Round 3 was a pound cake muffin with mixed berries and lemon cream. This was a nice finish to my meal, and combined just the right amount of sweetness.I would love to try Recess again, although I don't know if I want to pay full price.

it is one of the best restaurants in the Midwest***SF, NY and Chicago have many great high-end restaurants. \u00a0Each of these cities feature talented chefs as well as talented cooks hoping to do more, a big audience with an appetite (and willingness to spend money) for ambitious food, and lots of competition. \u00a0With SF, you also get the great produce from Central and Northern California farms. \u00a0Other cities do not have these same advantages so it can be hard for them to compete.Restaurants in other cities often feel like lesser versions of a SF or Chicago spot; Charleston in Baltimore is like that; there are enough good things about it that lets you know it is one of the best of the city, but the restaurant just does not feature the consistently great food you can get in SF.Sometimes though, a truly special restaurant emerges--one where the quality of ingredients is high, the talent in the kitchen is strong, the cooking is consistent, and the chef has a really strong sense of what he/she wants the restaurant to be. \u00a0With these restaurants, it can feel like if Paul Kahan (Chicago's Blackbird) or David Kinch (Los Gatos' Manresa) had a restaurant in a city less known for food, this is what the restaurant might be like. \u00a0That is what Greg Hardesty's Recess feels like.Recess features a nightly changing 4-course tasting menu (the final course is a choice between 2 desserts). \u00a0While the 1st course was average, all the other courses showcased excellent cooking techniques, high quality ingredients and great flavors.The 1st course was an average high-end course. \u00a0It was a cured Copper River salmon club sandwich. \u00a0The problem with the sandwich was that it was mostly bread. \u00a0There was very little of the nice sounding fillings, which included cured salmon, arugula, tomato, caramelized onions, and bacon aioli. \u00a0The flavors just did not stand out; maybe if there were more of the core ingredients on a flatbread or puff pastry base, this course would have stood out more.Everything else was great through. \u00a0I really liked how the fish course featured a Midwestern fish (Michigan whitefish) as opposed to the Atlantic or Pacific fish that many Midwestern restaurants fly in. \u00a0The fish had a great crispy skin like sea bass and it flaked very well. \u00a0Lake fish can often lack body, but the whitefish had a consistently smooth texture and a great flakiness that reminded me of sea bass or black cod. \u00a0The base of the dish was a creamy white bean puree that was mixed with fresh and soft Pacific red crab (which reminded me of Alaskan snow crab). \u00a0I really liked the cold, bright and slightly acidic sweet corn salad that really balanced out the dish.The meat course was very good. \u00a0Often with meat courses, I find that maybe the beef shines, but the garnishes and sauces are not that great. \u00a0Or everything works on the plate except for the beef because it is poor quality or they do not get the temperature right. \u00a0That was not the case with the beef strip loin at Recess. \u00a0The steak had a great flavor and was very juicy and tender while the garnishes were great. \u00a0The broccoli rabe featured really aggressive seasoning, but it was a great mix of saltiness and heat. \u00a0I liked how the tops were blistered too so there was a good contrast between the soft center and the crispy edges.The spaghetti squash carbonara was truly special. \u00a0With the spaghetti squash, it was a much lighter version of spaghetti carbonara, which really worked given the multiple courses and generous portions. \u00a0There was no sacrifice in the carbonara flavor though. \u00a0The cheese, egg and bacon elements all came across very well.The meal ended with a dessert baked to order (few restaurants feature warm pastry items nowadays). \u00a0The oatmeal cookie had a great crispy and crunchy outside while the inside was moist and very hearty with great nuts and juicy dried fruit. \u00a0The Irish coffee ice cream was very creamy and not airy like a lot of ice creams. \u00a0It also had a distinct burn.Service was great--very attentive and polite but also very friendly (like a great neighborhood restaurant).Prices were great. \u00a0You get good portions and a great variety of ingredients. \u00a0A similarly priced 4-course menu in SF would mean getting dainty portions or maybe having to settle for uninteresting proteins, vegetables and preparations.The decor was okay. \u00a0I liked the grade school chairs and the mix of modern, rustic and school themed decor. \u00a0I am not sure if everything went together though.Recess is a very nice Midwestern restaurant. \u00a0I liked how it showcased proteins and vegetables from the local area as well as how the kitchen was strong at executing fish, meat and dessert. \u00a0I would come here often if I lived here. \u00a0It is definitely worth considering if you ever find yourself in or around Indianapolis.Free street parking is available."], ["Marcie M.", "I hate to end the PERFECT streak b/c....well the food was ROCKING good and I would definitely go back! \u00a0But 5 stars is pure perfection and while I thought it was incredible, there were things I would have changed.I made a reservation about a week in advance for my hubby's birthday. \u00a0We always like to try new things but it's a risk and I wanted to ensure the menu would be something he would enjoy. \u00a0I confirmed our reservation once I read \"jerked quail\" on the menu. \u00a0I was VERY happy as anything jerked is my hubs favorite thing!I loved the meal. \u00a0I was very impressed with the freshness and I ate three things over the five courses I have never had IN MY LIFE - quail, mussels and marlin. \u00a0Everything was delectable, cooked with a light touch, served with a smile and gracefulness of a swan and the experience was outstanding. \u00a0 It was also very romantic and intimate...our food serving as a very easy conversation piece!I think I was confused by the casual-ness of it all and then for the first time in my adult life, I was shocked by our bill. I knew we were eating high end, but I didn't know it was \"out of house and home\" last meal on earth high end. \u00a0I have eaten at nearly every expensive steakhouse in town and never spent what I dropped at Recess. \u00a0I realize it's a VERY unique concept, but I want Yelpers to be aware, it's EASY to go crazy without realizing. \u00a0I mean we did do the wine taster with the courses but it was overpriced at $29 (quoted $27) per person and with two beers and a wine for the hubs, we added another $25. \u00a0The Jerked quail was also an \"add on\" and not included, so it was an additional $16. \u00a0With tip, we were ....well, wowsa. \u00a0Overwhelmed.In any case, we will be back, but for sure, with the casual decor, chalkboard wall and bandanna wearing cooks/waitresses, the $$$ amount and the ambiance aren't \"in tune\" which is why they lose a star. I'll know better next time that I can rock my deconstructed denim, since I'll be on recess. Another downer - parking is a bitch.I will TOTALLY get over it....but I just need to point out all of it is still on my mind a week later."], ["Tara J.", "My husband and I went here last night for the first time and I have to say that this was the best meal we've had since moving to Indianapolis. We have been disappointed with the food here compared to Chicago, but Recess was a great find! The entrees and desserts were particularly delicious, and the wine pairings were spot on. The service was also excellent and everyone we interacted with was very friendly and knowledgeable. We will definitely visit Recess again!For those who are nervous about a prix fixe menu, I recommend checking online the day of to see the offerings before making a reservation. They do make accommodations for allergies or dietary restrictions, but not for simple taste preferences. My husband and I are open to trying new things, so it wasn't an issue for us, but if you want to take someone who is especially picky you may want to let them know ahead of time how the prix fixe menu works. Hopefully they will be willing to try something new!"], ["Michael C.", "This as our first time eating at Recess and of course it was very good. In particular I really enjoyed the scallops, which is saying something because ordinarily I don't like them. It says something good about the quality of the restaurant that they'll make everything good.Nothing at all was bad, but I will say the chicken albondingas in chile sauce were, to me, a little less special than the other dishes. They were well done, just not as subtle and different as the rest of the meal, and thus a little out of place."], ["Allison F.", "A fun culinary adventure...I love that Recess chooses for me! Simple, straightforward, and delicious."], ["Mary D.", "Made reservations we thought at Room Four, when we arrived the sign on the door said \"Room Four\" was not opened. They were using the space for Recess.....our waiter offered to make us reservations somewhere else but we were headed to a hockey game after dinner so we stayed. The menu was set price at $60. Per personFirst course was salad or soup, had the salad it was wonderful, second came Halibut which also was very good, third was ribeye which we found tough...dessert was good as well.....with a bottle of wine and coffee our bill was $200.....not what we wanted to spend for our night out....I suggest you clarify which place you want to eat at and also you should be \"asked\" when they are taking your reservations.."], ["Maria L.", "Definitely one of the best restaurants in Indianapolis. The menu is changed regularly and is set. They frown on changing what is served for taste preference but for food allergies they will make accommodations. All the food that's cooked here is innovative and thoughtful. Both times I've gone I do the wine pairing for each course. It is pricey but worth it. I leave perfectly satiated, never too full, and love to come back."], ["Brandon S.", "Best meal I've had in a long time! Service was good, atmosphere is laid back, and the food Wow!

By far the best meal I've ever had in Indy!"], ["Bo D.", "Amazing food, if you're willing to pay the steep prices and travel to its weird location. The wine pairings are pretty good too, although they give you a lot of wine - something to be aware of if you're driving.I'm hesitant about going back just based on price alone ($226 for dinner and wine for two, after tax and a generous tip). But my first experience was worth it and I would recommend everyone else give it a try at least once."], ["Rose F.", "Truly enjoyed this spectacular restaurant. Pre fix dinner but worth every cent. Dinner menu changes each night with a four course meal with a wine pairing option. We were offered a couple of variations for the appetizer and main course ie fish/ beef options.

The only thing I didn't like was the price, I felt that we definitely over paid for what we got, we dropped $400 they charged $45 per person for wine pairing with only three glasses of wine and $90 for four tiny pieces of caviar. In my opinion the need to adjust the pricing if they want to have continued business."], ["Dalia M.", "(3.5 stars)Alright, okay, yelpers. This place was good but I have definitely had better meals. I was expecting the world covered in truffles and gold on a plate given the reviews on here so I guess I had pretty high standards.My boyfriend and I came here for our one year anniversary. Our server was passionate about the food and wine that we had. People there are nice, friendly and pleasant. I do wish lighting was a bit dimmer. Onto the food... our tasting menu was a beet salad, merlan cod, ribeye and chocolate cake. The fish was my favorite dish. It had a lot of flavor and was cooked perfectly. I do like doing the pre-fixe menu at restaurants because then I try different things. As someone who didn't like beets, I do now because I tried them here. Food came out a bit slow, and although it all tasted good, I felt the flavors lacked some depth.Given the daily menu change, I am sure some nights are better than others. I would be willing to go back a night after reviewing the menu for the evening. It's pretty pricey so a heads up as a couple, we dropped ~$200."], ["Lauren R.", "Make reservations! \u00a0We went here with two other friends for a different type of dinner. \u00a0The service is okay, parking is okay but can be sparse, food is great!I really like the concept of the place. \u00a0They were definitely able to cater to my dietary restrictions (I'm allergic to nuts and shellfish). \u00a0Everything they served us was mighty tasty! \u00a0I like that there are options. \u00a0If you go with people you're comfortable with, you can definitely grab some tastes off of other's plates to sample the entire menu for the evening. \u00a0The only thing that did bother me was the professionalism of the staff. \u00a0The runner (food deliverer) seemed really bored all night and played with her hair all evening which really bothered me."], ["Jeff D.", "Wow what a fabulous meal. Every course was something I would not Likely order but fully enjoyed. That was the joy for me with a single menu.

I recommend the German lager."], ["Aaron A.", "I would be lying if I didn't say that we need a 6th star to rate this restaurant. From the parings, to the service, to unbelievable food.

Rich and salty pistachio streusel, creamy and tangy cream cheese custard, slightly sweet warm apple-pear compote ... top 5 dessert of my life (and it's probably the only non-chocolate entry in the top 20). \u00a0They even put a candle in it (somehow?) for my birthday, whatta nice touch.During this visit, they also served me one of the best slabs 'o meat I've ever had - venison steak with cornmeal grits, abalone mushrooms, charred tomato demi. \u00a0I truly couldn't stop smiling and shaking my head while eating it. \u00a0It was \"please punch me in the face so I know this is real\" good.What else can I say? \u00a0It has been about a year since my last visit, but Recess hasn't changed a bit. Still amazing me with every bite, an unbelievable experience for any food lover."], ["Tiffany B.", "Culinary heaven.Went for my birthday and had a brilliant time.

I'm still not quite there but I've been there three times now so I'm pretty much obligated to write a review.The thing that I love most about Recess is that there's always something new and different. That something may be familiar or it may be something that you may have turned your nose up at during any other eating occasion, but rest assured that it will be delicious.From the fresh, crisp starter salads to the entree sitting in sauce so good you want to drool all over it so that there will be more to lick off the plate to the nutella (!?!?!!!!!) sour cream frosting on your dessert, you will be entranced. Do not go here on a date, unless you want to always be aware of the fact that you can never satisfy him/her like this food can. You will know because there will be no conversation, just rapturous moans. The chairs are hard and it can get chilly, so bring some padding or a coat, but not even that can make me knock off a star.

The food expertly prepared, delivered in a touch of fine dining meets casual environment. The wine pairings were excellent and all in all for what you get everything is quite affordable.

Not that the portions are small (I 'd go back to Mesh for their braised pork belly appetizer), just did not find anything special with the 1st three dishes. The lobster salad was ok, the pan fried fluke was ok, but the sliced ribeye on some potato salad with clams just did not worked out for me.Generally the food is not bad, it was different, but just don't think it was money well spent. Service was excellent though, and the dessert that evening blueberry cobbler with vanilla ice cream topped with bacon bits(anything with bacon is good), was really good. They are supposed to change menu daily (consistency?) so maybe we just went on a not so special day."], ["Kristopher R.", "One of the top five meals I have ever had. This local Indy staple most definitely. holds its own amongst the best of the world. The Fluke was so delicate, so refined. Such clean flavors. All the ingredients paired together so cleverly and craft-fully. The pork tenderloin closed out the meal. Served over tortilla spiked blue potatoes, With an ancho chili pur\u00e9e and just a touch of roasted pumpkin seeds. The sweet aromatic flavors reminded me a lot of the Autumn dishes of Mexico City. Such as Chiles En Nogada. This place deserves the crown of Indianapolis restaurants. Great chefs. And very solid, sincere and friendly service. A taste of the world severed right in your backyard. And using only the best farm to table ingredients. Go here now. It is well with the price. Everything on the set course menu will blow your mind. So leave your tastebuds in the hands of the incredible chef.

If you need more detail than that, here are some specifics: \u00a0Our menu consisted of: Beet Gazpacho with shrimp, pickled kale, white hominy puree \u00a0(By the way, the shrimp was magical. Forget the large shrimp that a certain restaurant smothers in cocktail sauce to hide the fact that they are otherwise bland and tasteless. \u00a0These tasted like a shrimp should.)Paired with 10 Chateau de Trinquevedel, Tavel, FranceScallop Carbonara with house-made fettuccine, peas, smoked quail eggPaired with 09 Joseph Drouhin Meursault, Bourgogne, France(supplemental course)Seared Foie Gras with miso, mushroom and scallion Paired with Green Eyes Gruner Veltliner, AustriaGunthorp Farms Pork Loin with blue cheese grits, red wine gremolata sauce Paired with 07 Castro Ventosa el Castro de Valtuille Mencia Joven, Bierzo SpainButtermilk Panna Cotta with graham cracker crumbs, pineapple and pistachio(Ordered a Sauternes; supplemental charge)Food was amazing. Service is stellar. The wine pairings were some of the best I've ever experienced. My only dislike about the evening was the atmosphere.... to be honest, it's a little cold.

It's safe to say that I had a damn good meal. I could describe each dish in more detail, tell you about the minimalist decor and solid service... but I'd rather write about what happened after my meal. Basically the freshness of my meal @ Recess Blew. My. Mind. and truly hit home the fact that I've been overly cost concerned (obsessed?) at the grocery store. In pursuit of a low grocery bill I have been forgetting other important factors. Since eating at Recess a couple of weeks ago I've been spending more time and money investigating where my food comes from. I've been buying organic potatoes and tomatoes, in pursuit of more flavorful and purposeful meals at home. \u00a0I've been thinking about what type of farm the chicken I wanted to stew was raised on. Local? Free-range? Commercial? Instead of trying to get the best deal at the cheapest grocery store in town (which usually means most of my produce MUST be eaten in like 2 days or else it spoils), I've been thinking about which herb is the freshest...if buying a ton of cheese is worth the carbon footprint...I'll always be cost conscious but in part because of my experience at Recess I'm going to think about other factors, too. Dinner at home, seriously, has never tasted better."], ["Chanh B.", "When I think of good food. I dream of Recess.

I was in town from Chicago, and hit this place up purely based on yelp reviews.The best: Our server was very good. He was very attentive and knew the menu well. I can't recall his name, but I'd recommend him highly. He even gave us an extensive list of bars close to our hotel to check out. I'm a big beer fan and they had a very solid beer menu that was excellently priced. Food presentation was excellent. Dessert featured the best blue cheese I've ever had.The good: I enjoyed the way it was decorated, very trendy, but it did look like it was all done on a budget. Lighting was bright enough, unlike a lot of similar type places I'm familiar with in Chicago that seem to be super dark. Food wasn't terribly slow, but we did spend quite a bit of time waiting between courses. I chalk this up to being a packed Saturday night (the day after Valentines day), and we had a slightly later dinner reservation (7:45), so they probably got slammed with tables right before us at 7:The food we enjoyed. Cauliflower soup and blue cheese (the best I've had) were highlights. The not so good: It's expensive. I didn't have any problems with the food, but I did not think it was worth the price-tag. Our pre-fixe menu was $70/plate. I would have been happy if it was closer to $50. Maybe it was higher due to Valentines Day, but you need to knock my socks off in that price range. Food gets a 4/5 on it's own. Price would drag it down to 3.5 if I could give it a half star. I would not return based on price alone, but don't hate that I tried it out. I did not like my viking lamb ribeye entree much either. The roasted red pepper fennel sauce was a definite miss, it tasted underseasoned and cheap.Overall: I don't know much about the food scene in Indy, but I've been to plenty of places in Chicago in this price range that are better.

They were booked until 9:30pm, so I took the reservation as I was eager to try the place. The woman I spoke with was polite.After talking to one of our party, discovered it might not be the best place for us to dine, as the prix fixe menu didn't have any chicken-based or meat-free dishes (each day is something new on their menu, and you don't get a choice. But it all sounds amazingly delicious.)So I called Recess again, this time got a gentleman on the phone who was indeed gentlemanly and polite. I asked if they could substitute chicken or no meat for the lamb dish, he asked the chef, and said they could accommodate.

So I called Recess again, spoke with the same woman as the first time, explained the situation, and apologized for having to cancel my reservation just a few hours before we were to dine.She was unfailingly polite and said they'd look forward to seeing us in the near future.

I left feeling full, but not so full that I felt I wanted to die. Each course built into the next, and each was one step up from the previous course. Service was outstanding as well.

An experience such as what Recess provided this weekend? No, not even close.Recess is small, intimate and modern in feel. I doubt they turn the majority of their tables more than twice a night. Our early reservation at 5:45 saw us the first in the restaurant but we did not depart until 8:15 -- and that was without lengthy lingering over extra drinks or the check. The clientele is diverse - you will see a few well-heeled 30 some-things, professor-looking types and the eccentric whom you will have a hard time categorizing. The point is, Recess attracts a patron base that transcends a \"type\" or \"crowd\"...the common theme is the ability to appreciate a truly fine evening with fantastic food, drink, service and quality.My choices from Friday's menu:Sashimi tangle with aji and scallops - beautiful, delicate and a moment of \"OH! This is what it's like to have a dish's ingredients introduce themselves to you in waves of flavor\".Pork belly ramen - the richness of this broth is something that makes you long for a log cabin, 5 feet of snow, a fireplace, no functioning technology and no chance of being dug out for at least a week -- and you'd be happy about it.Beef medallions, rosemary mashed potatoes and spinach puree. Comfort food beautifully done, period.Chocolate sorbet - richly delicious, but light. You will leave completely satisfied but not too full, not heavy -- throughout the meal you will think to yourself, I'm going to be hungry when this is over. You won't.

We had good service and our questions were answered sufficiently. The interior is really nicely decorated, and our food was AWESOME! In fact, I am completely confident that if this restaurant were located in Broad Ripple (instead of in a strip mall on W. 38th St.), we wouldn't have been able to get a seat at 8pm on a Saturday night. This is a really top-notch establishment. Also, apologies ahead of time for not remembering the Spanish names for the items we ordered. Instead of the chips and salsa that Mexican restaurants bring you, a basket of soft, fresh bread is brought to your table (kind of like challah) along with a little bowl of pale green, lightly spiced dipping sauce (aji). It is so addictive! Seriously, we could've easily filled up on this and not had room for our meals. Our appetizer was a deep-fried ball of mashed potatoes stuffed with spiced beef, olives, and chopped boiled egg, and served alongside a salad. The salad consists of thinly sliced sweet onions, tomato, lettuce, and plenty of cilantro lightly dressed. I think the dressing was mainly vinegar and lime juice? The boys raved about the salad and we all loved the hot appetizer (reminded me of a cross between an Indian samosa and a potato pakora). It's not the best choice to share with 3 people as someone is going to complain about getting an uneven amount of some filling ingredient. I had the vegetarian green pasta which is served alongside potatoes in cheese (huancaina) sauce. The only thing that threw me about this dish is that the potatoes and cheese sauce were cold. Evidently this is the traditional way to serve this dish. So...you didn't get cold food...that's the way it's supposed to be! The green pesto-style sauce was SO tasty. It was just a little bit spicy and coated every single noodle. The portion was so huge I'll probably be able to eat it for 2 more meals! One of my companions ordered the green pasta with a pan-fried chicken breast (reminded me of schnitzel-delish) and a potato. He also had to make an effort not to over-stuff himself because he loved his entree. My partner ordered the half rotisserie chicken, which is served with salad and french fries, although you have the option to sub other sides if you wish. That bird was awesome! Total perfection. Moist, flavorful, tender. He couldn't stop raving about the flavor and said, \"We're not in Boston anymore.\" There aren't a ton of vegetarian choices, but between the appetizer menu, the desserts, and the couple entrees, I don't think anyone will leave hungry. I think better than half of the menu items are or can easily be prepared gluten-free. However, if you tend to get very sick with even the slightest contamination, be cautious. There is a (very) slight language barrier and communicating \"no wheat anywhere\" might be tricky?Regretfully, we didn't budget any belly space for dessert. There are 2-3 available. There are a couple \"exotic\" Peruvian soda choices but no alcohol is available. Our pre-tip total for 3 entrees and 1 appetizer was about $43 with tax. Prices aren't cheap, but the portions are humongous and the food is delicious. I highly recommend making a trip to this restaurant, and I will even be encouraging friends in the northern suburbs to head down to 38th St."], ["Jesse B.", "I went here for my birthday, they didnt have the pesto pasta that brought me to the resturant. I ended up getting a shrimp dish which was OK. Poor drink selection and weird decor too."], ["Ruth F.", "I've never tried Peruvian before, so I'm no expert. \u00a0Nice little place with helpful staff - I'm a vegetarian and I was traveling with someone who can't eat salt, and they were able to accommodate us.We too rave about the green dipping sauce, which comes with some unexceptional white European-style bread. \u00a0They told us it's basically garlic, jalapenos and mayonnaise; it has a great kick.My companion had the grilled fish and seemed happy with it; I had the grilled plantains (nice; a little sweet; fairly oily) and the pesto with two half potatoes in some sort of Peruvian yellow sauce. \u00a0Portions are extremely generous; I ate maybe a third of the pasta, and then had enough left over for two lunches.Didn't try the Inca cola but really enjoyed the purple corn drink, which features cloves and spices and is sold in bottles at the ethnic grocery down the street."], ["Tony J.", "We had dinner here last Wednesday. This was only our second Peruvian meal, after Mama Irma's which we had quite some time ago. I don't \u00a0exactly remember the menu from Mama Irma's, but Machu Picchu seem to have plenty of dishes that comes with potato fries. We started with the appetizer sampler which had several items like fried yucca, mussel seviche, fried pork and what I assume is pan fried thinly sliced marinated pork. They were all good particularly the thinly sliced pork and even the seviche. It is also served with pickIed red onion, though not as tasty as the one they serve at Mama Irma's. For my entree I ordered a chicken stew dish that comes with rice and some potatoes topped with a bright yellow sauce. I enjoyed the \u00a0chicken a lot and the rice was plentiful, though I didnt care much about the potatoes. The wife ordered a chicken stir fry with veggies and fries which we did not particularly enjoy. It was not bad but it just wasn't special, tasted like ordinary teriyaki to me. Overall the food is not bad at all, but I thought what we had at Mama Irma's was way better. Service wise, it started really great but our server for some weird reason I guess decided to take her dinner break. We waited for minutes but nobody cared to bring us our check nor see if there is anything else we need. I ended up interrupting her dinner so we can get our check and get out of there."], ["Terry N.", "Great Peruvian food......we were the only customers in the restaurant due to a snow storm....great service...food was delicious....will definitely come back and sample other items on the menu. \u00a0 Definitely recommend the fish in garlic sauce....had a delicious cilantro and citrus taste.....served with rice and potato.....wife had what they called \u00a0Peruvian chicken fried rice....portion so big we took a to go back to hotel and ate some later that night and again in the morning and still had some left....."], ["Robert T.", "I've eaten at this place a few times. \u00a0Both the food and service has been very good each time I've been here. \u00a0Indianapolis does not have a great deal of ethnic restaurants so this is a treat. \u00a0I get the lomo saltado as my main dish which has always been good."], ["Howard L.", "This place was slightly better than ok (3.5 stars), and good to try. \u00a0Basically, Peruvian food was a novelty for us, and we found of particular interest the presentations of various bright colors and the various green and yellow sauces. \u00a0The food quality we found was of average quality though, and the prices are on the moderately high side. \u00a0The best dish was the appetizer sampler platter - with beef heart (a bit gamey), fried pork, fried yuccas, and marinated mussels. \u00a0This platter came with a nice mild yellow sauce - made with cheese and corn we were told. \u00a0I also had the Aji de Gallina, a Peruvian staple of shredded chicken and rice in their creamy yellow sauce. \u00a0 I found this sauce a bit over peppery, but the dish was filling and decent nonetheless. \u00a0Wife had the Pescado a lo Macho - fish fillet and assorted seafood (shrimp, octopus, etc), but the seafood was a bit fishy smelling. \u00a0Son had the best entree, the Tallarines Verdes - spaghetti with a bright green pesto sauce and grilled chicken. The pasta was flavorful, fresh, and satisfying, but the grilled chicken was dryish and ordinary. \u00a0We also got a sampling of their purple corn drink. \u00a0This was like a grape juice in appearance, but had a complex taste - cinnamony, spicy, and tangy. \u00a0I wouldn't order it in future, but it was interesting to sample. \u00a0 All in, the meal was $64. \u00a0Overall, a nice change of the culinary scenery, but would consider coming back only if bored with all other cuisines."], ["Helen P.", "lovely meal!I had no idea what to expect from a Peruvian restaurant, but was delighted with my meal.The Plaintains were marvelous. \u00a0The purple corn drink was yummy. \u00a0And my entree was delicious.Sure wish we had this food in my hometown!"], ["Ruben L.", "3.5- our server (maybe owner) was SUPER friendlyIn search of something a bit different, my wife and I decided to venture out to the west side and check out this joint. \u00a0We tag teamed this visit with a trip to Sagara, so all in all a good time.AMBIENCE- hole in the wall, no doubt. \u00a0The place was decorated with tradiational Peruivian and Incan items, but the drab colored walls, and the basic tables and chairs were clearly indicative of a hole in the wall. \u00a0Most of the patrons seemed to be of Chicano/Hispanic decent, though there appeared to be a table of students, and another table of adventurous older folks.MENU- the menu was pretty extensive. \u00a0They had a fair number of appetizers, beef, chicken and seafood dishes in addition to some Peruvian favorites. \u00a0It didn't look like they had guinea pig on their menu, though I wasn't about to try it, so it didn't bother me. \u00a0- 1 star for not having alfajores (traditional cookie with dulce de leche). \u00a0Our server said they were going to add them to the menu but they didn't have them at this point. \u00a0BOOOO.SERVICE- as I said, our server (I'm 99% sure he was the owner) was very friendly. \u00a0He was very attentive and answered all of our questions about the menu. \u00a0He probably thought we were a bunch of gringos until I asked about the alfajores, then he stopped trying to sell so hard.FOOD- my wife and I started with an order of fried yucca based on the recommendation of the owner. \u00a0For $7, I was expecting something more than what we got. \u00a0The presentation was not sexy by any means, as it looked like the yucca was just cut up into fry shapes, and served with a sauce of some sort. \u00a0My wife and I were not impressed with the overpriced fries.For dinner, my wife got the arroz con pollo, and I tried the lamb shank. \u00a0My lamb shank was very tasty. \u00a0It was cooked with \"Peruvian spices\" and had a red sauce served with white beans and rice. \u00a0The lamb was very tender, and a pretty generous portion considering the price. \u00a0My wife on the other hand was not a fan of her food. \u00a0The arroz con pollo was lacking in flavor, and the the chicken was pretty dry. \u00a0Pretty disappointing considering that's a traditional dish.OVERALL- I was a fan, my wife, not so much. \u00a0On the strength of the lamb, and the hope that they will get alfajores soon, I would go back. \u00a0I just wouldn't recommend the arroz con pollo. \u00a0Check it out if youre looking for something outside of your normal fare. \u00a0Prices are reasonable, and the portions are generous.Chuck Norris Rating- Inca Stomp"], ["Wyoming L.", "We had such great hopes....we were in for such a big let down.The food was just really gross.

A friend and I came here for lunch ordered 3 dishes to share as we found out later was enough for 5-6 people. Total lunch bill was over $60 with tip! \u00a0This place was located in a strip mall off of 38th street. \u00a0I went one time when they were located on the north side and remember that everything I ordered was great but it's been year and had not tried it since they moved. \u00a0We ordered the Parihuela de Mariscos soup (fish, shrimp, octopus, mussels, and tomato bouillabaisse), the Ceviche Machu Picchu (fresh fish, shrimp, octopus, squid with choros ala chalaca), and Arroz Chaufa de Mariscos (shrimp, octopus, squid and mussels served with fried rice. \u00a0The ceviche was great. The fish tasted fresh. The shrimp had the right consistency the seasoning was acidic and perfect. It was my favorite dish of the two. It came with a small sliver of corn on the cob and a section of sweet potato. \u00a0Pile high with onions and they were very generous on the seafood. All the seafood in all of our dishes were great except the mussels. \u00a0 They tasted either previously cooked, overcooked, or previously frozen. \u00a0All three dishes we ordered pretty much contained the same seafood. It looks like they were prepared the same way with different seasonings. \u00a0The soup was very salty. At first there was a seafood aroma that was a little fishy but we got use to it and tasted nothing but salty broth. \u00a0Not much depth in flavor but the fish, squid and octopus were all perfectly cooked. The arroz chaufa de Mariscos was just fried rice with all the seafood fried in there with it. not bad, but not my favorite. \u00a0There are over 60 items on the menu so I definitely want to come back and try more items on the menu. A lot of things came out of the kitchen looking good and smelling better so I think i'm going to just point to people's tables and items they ordered next time when ordering instead of trying to order from the menu. well, I'll also make it a point to get that delicious ceviche though.. \u00a0Everyone had a pitcher of something purple it looks on the menu as if it might be the purple corn (chicha morada en Jarra) and goes for 9.50 a pitcher. Must be good so I might venture for that as well. Can't wait to go back!On Monday to Fridays from 11am-3pm they have a soup, entree, and soft drink for $6.99"], ["Wendy S.", "This is a solid choice.

Will def eat here again."], ["Liz M.", "As someone who grew up eating my Peruvian mom's food, I can say that although there's nothing like a mother's cooking, this place caters wonderfully to gringos and Peruvian mothers who want the night off. The green sauce that they give you (free) when you sit down is one of the best parts of coming here! It is delicious and spicy, and we usually go through three or four bowls in a visit. It's great with the bread they give you or any meal that you order. My standard order begins with Yucca a la Huancaina, which is fried yucca (similar to a potato) and a yellow creamy sauce for dipping. While I enjoy the Huancaina sauce and order it every time I go, it is not real Peruvian Huancaina sauce. I get my sauce from a secret family recipe that I don't even know, so when my aunt is unavailable, Machu Picchu fills the void. It's not spicy at all, so this is a nice appetizer for those who don't like hot food. My favorite entrees are the Aji de Gallina (pulled chicken in a yellow sauce served w/rice), Lomo Saltado (big pieces of beef, tomato, and onion served over french fries), and Bistek a lo Pobre (piece of fried beef with a sunny-side up egg and plantains), and Tallarines Verdes (noodles with a creamy basil sauce). You can't go wrong with any of these dishes. Peruvian food is a great option for everyone, even unadventurous people, because the ingredients in most things are the same as the things we use in American cooking: chicken, beef, tomatoes, onion, rice, pasta, etc. Wash your meal down with the nectar of the Gods - INCA KOLA! It might be something you have had to grow up drinking, but it tastes like bubble gum soda.While it is a bit of a hole in the wall, the prices don't necessarily reflect that fact. \u00a0However, the portion sizes are very big, and I can usually get two meals out of a shared appetizer and individual entree.Service isn't terribly fast, and like most people here have said, it is easier to go up to the counter to pay when you are done."], ["Alex K.", "This is Indianapolis' premiere Peruvian place.

Tastings- A Wine Experience was just a couple of blocks from our hotel and I had read great reviews from other Yelpers. The location was very inviting on this sunny Sunday afternoon. Music playing, doors open, cute patio in the front and side. We took a seat outside and the server graciously told us it was half price bottles of wine all day and night. Yay!! Since this included chamapagne and sparkling wine, we selected a nice French Sparkling (only $12) The server explained to us how the wine tasting worked too just in case we decided to go that route later. They have a huge wine selection and you load whatever dollar amount you would like on a card- then go around to the difference wine dispensers and taste. The menu had a good selection of cheese, salads, flatbreads, etc. I ordered the fig, goat cheese, proscuitto flatbread drizzled with balsamic onions and toasted walnuts. Absolutely amazing flavors. The hubby ordered a chicken pesto flatbread that was also great- but not as delicious as mine. Our server was friendly and attentive. After we finished our food, we wanted to move inside to the bar area to watch football and she continue to be our server. We order a bottle of red wine for $13. Outstanding. We will be back for sure!"], ["Michael B.", "Close call between 4 and 5 stars for me, but when in doubt gotta keep the fifth star in the back pocket and leave room for improvement.Came on a Thursday not knowing that it was a great night to visit - half priced flatbreads. We ended up doing a cheese plate and sharing two flatbreads - one with Filet and another BBQ Chicken. Both were really great and an awesome deal at 50% off, and the cheeses were really good as well. The set-up with the pay per pour was really convenient as well - plenty of options if you want to splurge and try an expensive bottle or sample the cheaper options of different types. Service was really great and there's a cool, classy vibe."], ["Amy T.", "Service was really good! They did accidentally give us the wrong cheese but they corrected it right away (in the end we got 2 St. Andr\u00e9 cheeses, NOT complaining haha).Their cheese selection was on point though. :) Selection of wine was nice, you can either order by the bottle/glass OR...you can load a card up with money and do 2 oz. tasters of whatever is in the room. I fell in love with the Ochetti from Renato Ratti so I kept ordering that. \u00a0My favorite dish was the jumbo lump crab cakes and then the fillet mignon skewers. DELICIOUS! If you are in the area, this is a MUST TRY!"], ["Danielle W.", "Can you say Holy Cheese?! (See attached picture) I went to this place after a yoga event and the wine was wonderful, the cheese plate was out of this world, and the service was amazing!"], ["N H.", "Cozy and convenient wine tasting bar, located downtown. I went here during a conference in March 2014 and was very pleased with the food and wine specials."], ["Sasha L.", "This place really is THE wine experience!It reminds me of being at a more sophisticated Dave & Busters, as you load your card with whatever amount you choose and then you put it in the machine and play! There is such a wide variety of wines that are distributed 2oz at a time, each costs something different. The price range is around $4-$20 or maybe higher. It also tells you the price of a bottle. There are several machines, the manager said they came from Italy. I recall her saying they cost in the neighborhood of $30-40K. I want one in my house someday! This is a very unique destination in Indianapolis and I am so glad we stopped in!"], ["Jackie L.", "My experience at Tastings was top of the line service from beginning to end. Our server and bartender Johnny and Karen provided us with excellent service as we conducted our wine tasting during the evening hours. They provided great knowledge in regards to questions about the wine and dinner menu. The manager Lindsay was very hands on with the staff and the customers during our entire stay. She was friendly and helpful in assisting us with questions as well.The flat bread pizzas and spinach dip are excellent! I enjoyed the wine tasting experience as there is a vast selection to choose from.Half price bottles of wine and live music on Sundays starting at 6:00-6:30pm!"], ["Angeleka D.", "You can look like you're ballin' even on a budget! Who doesn't love a good wine rush?! Ok, who doesn't love wine, friends, luxe, and maybe even some nice fair for a very reasonable price?I've gone to tastings 4 or 5 times, and I absolutely love it here. The staff is friendly, charming, and inviting. I had a short pop quiz for Josh(?) who was a ray of sunshine. I asked about a few whites, for a friend, and he was more than knowledgable about taste/region/vintage. The atmosphere is hip. Eager to have you chatting with friends or a sweet talk with a date over the modern music selection. \u00a0The wine is flowing freely, and you can have as little or as much as you want. You put a dollar amount of your choice on your Tastings card. Then, find your favorite or new favorite wine and get your swagger on. They also have full bottles for you to enjoy, as well as small plates to share.Go anytime the mood strikes. Tastings is open a little later on the weekends, however I suggest late evening. There's a rush hour buzz in the air that goes nicely with wine at 6pm. Wear something business casual sexy, and relax into some conversation or take in the artwork along the walls of the Conrad. You are going to love this place. A wonderful intro into the finer taste of life.\"Treat yo' self!\""], ["Steph G.", "Great fun way to experience different wines! This is perfect for almost any occasion or night of the week. The staff is extremely friendly and the sommeliers are very knowledgeable. It caters to different tastes and different price points. Not a fan of wine? They have a bar!I do suggest to do dinner elsewhere, even though they serve heavy app options they aren't the highlight of the experience. Fun time, great place to relax, and try a couple of new things without feeling committed to buy/drink an entire bottle."], ["Laurie D.", "We were staying at the Conrad and stopped in before heading out for dinner. Cool concept but way too expensive. I was also disappointed that they did not offer any type of crackers to cleanse your palate between tastings. I asked the waitress about it and she offered to bring out some bread slices, which we were charged for! My SO and I each tasted a few wines, ordered one glass each...our bill with the overpriced bread came to almost $100. Way too much for a pre-dinner experience. Service was about average."], ["Jason T.", "I was excited to eat here and happy it was open late, but...The Sauvignon Blanc showed up way too warm, the chicken skewers were over cooked and dry, though I liked the peanut sauce, the shrimp ceviche had zero citrus and all the salt an ocean could envy, the sesame crusted tuna was well cooked but the sauce was literally a small bowl of soybean oil. \u00a0Basically, crap. \u00a0For like $70. My lady didn't want me to make a stink, so I paid without complaining. \u00a0But she agreed with everything I just said. I mean... I shoulda gone to Old Point and had better food and spent less. \u00a0And had a comfortable chair outside? \u00a0 Who stole the cushions from their outside furniture?So annoyed. \u00a0The service was great. \u00a0The food and wine sucked."], ["Gelone B.", "Here to support Memorial Tribute for Cynthia Layne. \u00a0Place is packed! \u00a0Half price wine tonight. \u00a0The service is fast and friendly.

My husband and I are visiting from Arizona and stopped here last night for some snacks and drinks. We sat on the patio which is so much fun, you get to people watch. Our server was great she was knowledgable and had lots of suggestions. We had a cheese platter, OMG so delicious. Then after we ate we did their wine tasting. they give you a card that you put money on and you stick it into the machine and choose what wine you want to try. It pours out 2 oz and charges your card for the \"tasting\" such a fun idea! We had a great time, smoked cigars on the patio and bought a few bottles of wine. Highly recommend this place and I would love to return one day."], ["Heather T.", "Been looking forward to coming here for a while and it did not disappoint. Came here by myself and felt comfortable. Brought my Wine Bible (since I'm studying for my level 1 sommelier test) and was ready to taste a bunch of wines.There's open seating, so just choose your seat. And a server will come over to you. I loaded $30 on my tasting card-- they will inform you if you're unfamiliar-- and it was plenty. I asked for an extra glass so I could do some comparative tasting. Prices range from $3 to $11 a taste, depending on what you choose.My favorite was a 2010 Chateau Lafite-Rothschild from Paulliac and that was $11 for a taste, but totally worth it. They have a great selection of wine, especially for tasting. I also had a Margherita flatbread pizza which was tasty. Service was great, very attentive and informative. I was there for almost two hours just tasting and studying. Can't wait to come back!"], ["Joel F.", "This is a neat place to unwind after a long day. The vibe is very relaxing and the service is fantastic. We arrived around 10pm on a Saturday night expecting the place to be really busy. But due to the Colts/Patriots playoff game it wasn't. We grabbed 4 seats at the back bar and proceeded with our evening. This is only my second time ever being in this location before and I was happy to see a full bar especially since I am not a wine drinker. The service at the bar was exceptional and they were able to make whatever I wanted. Jonathon was behind the bar and he makes a fabulous Cosmopolitan! During the course of the evening there was wait staff that stopped by and made sure we were doing alright.The only negative that I have to share, even though it isn't really a negative, is the prices at the bar. I ordered 2 drinks, and a friend put their drink on my tab... the total was $34.00. A Bacardi & Coke was $9.50!!! I expected a higher tab due to the fact that I had a Cosmo, but that was way more than I was expecting. Again, this isn't really a negative, but if you're on a tight budget this is not the place for you to grab drinks with a friend. If you are looking for a sophisticated lounge to chill and have a few drinks, then this is right up your alley.I definitely will return for another fun filled, sophisticated \"gay\" night out!"], ["Shannon A.", "Hubs and I were looking for some downtime after being in Indy for a conference and after spending a few hours running around the city, we spotting Tastings and thought it would be the perfect place to grab some vino, sit outside, and people watch. We were not disappointed. We were able to sit outside at one of the tall tables on a 75 degree day. Cannot beat that! Our server came over and discussed some wines with us. I grabbed a vino verde while hubs started with a local beer. After our second round, our server changed. No biggie, but then on our third round, our server changed again. That is really my only reason for the deduction of star. It started making us feel as though they didn't want us hanging around, but we did anyway. There were tons of passerbys and it is in a great location downtown, near the shopping area so you can take in the city in all it's grandeur while sitting and enjoying some vino."], ["Irene I.", "Can't say enough about this place!! My husband and my experience was fun, informative, unique and tasty! The service was helpful and superb and I walked out with a fab bottle of wine to enjoy in our room at the Marriott. I would almost relocate to Indianapolis just to frequent here again and again."], ["Mia D.", "This was the perfect place to hold a cocktail reception. There was plenty of room for our group to socialize. The wine selection was really good. I fell in love with the Bodegas Malbec from Argentina! You have the ability to fill a Tastings Card and go around the bar sampling the wine. We did not do that, as we had a big group drinking different things. The finger foods are amazing. All the flat breads were addicting. It was a great place to unwind after meetings all day or have a drink while watching the game. They had well positioned TV for everyone to watch their team during March Madness."], ["Michelle M.", "Brilliant location and being attached to the hotel in downtown Indy. \u00a0I have experienced this wine tasting concept with the automated machines in Orlando, and I enjoyed this new experience. \u00a0Tastings has a more open floor plan, which I liked, as well as the option to dine or taste or both. \u00a0Lots of seating, but also lots of places to set drinks if you are standing. \u00a0I absolutely think pour out buckets is a necessity, something my previous go-to wine tasting place was missing. \u00a0However, I did not like how these machines only offer one size portion. \u00a0I like having at least an option for a smaller portion, a tasting if you will, before spending more money on something I may or may not enjoy."], ["Edgar P.", "Wow, what an impressive set up. Now granted we are not what you would call \"wine experts\" but we have an idea as to what we want! It was 4 of us with a taste for something better than your $7.99 bottle of wine!

I recommend you go there and try it, at least once. I am glad I did. Great service, great selection, great atmosphere."], ["Deborah B.", "This is a place that I can't help but love. The concept is great, get a Tasting card, add value to it as you see fit, select wine of your choice, and taste away. \u00a0You can also just order many of the wines by the glass as well as bottle. \u00a0When it is really crowded, I usually opt for a glass of wine rather than trying to make my way through the crowd. \u00a0It is a perfect place for me to take family and out of town guests, which always seem to love it. \u00a0When the weather is nice, the patios both on Washington St. and Illinois are great for celebrity/people watching. \u00a0I often play count the Maseratis or Bentleys if sitting on the Washington St. side, as the valets love to keep them parked in front of The Conrad for show.One drawback to sitting on the patio is that patrons are allowed to smoke, according to the manager, and nothing puts the brakes on an enjoyable evening of wine sipping like a stinky cigar in your face.While the servers are always nice, many times they are not the best at prompt service, and seem a bit overwhelmed, even when they are not super-busy. Seems to be a high staff turnover.That being said, I will continue to return, as it is a great little place to enjoy a glass of wine or two in the heart of downtown Indy."], ["Angela C.", "Very cool concept- my coworker and I wandered in on a Thursday night when we were in Indy for a work trip. Bonus points for being open when everyone else was closed! The flatbreads were half price and very tasty. The wines are in dispensers around the room, and you can load up your card to do tastings. We didn't do a tasting since we had a big day ahead, but did enjoy a nice glass of wine. I would love to come back here for the whole experience!"], ["Tiffany B.", "Wine is great, but you can have a good bottle of wine in the most surprising of places. So, guess you gotta base the review of apps, atmosphere and staff. So: staff is friendly, apps are tasty and atmosphere is a typical-for-its-time nice spot for grabbing a glass of crushed grapes. They do have some other bar items, but don't go too rogue--they didn't have my drink (Pimms). Atmosphere is pleasant, music not too loud, and a giant screen rotating some famous impressionist paintings. Big ups to them for also being open later, and still serving apps after 10pm.

Both were excellent, well balanced and I really enjoyed my wine! \u00a0It could have been the company but the overall experience was enhanced to the point that I won't overlook this location again when choosing a place to indulge in the future.

There are several wines set up in a soda fountain type fashion. You walk around with your glass, put in your card and sample whatever you please. This place is attached to the Conrad, so if you happen to be staying there - might as well walk downstairs and check it out! This isn't a place JUST for wine. No worries. You can get your beer and cocktails as well -- along with small plates of deliciousness. What else can you find at Tastings? Live music. Ah, the live music. I was there the other night and was able to listen to \"Gentlemen's Rule.\" an a cappella group . So good."], ["Bobby N.", "This place is so cool. The idea is that you get a tasting card and then help yourself to tastes of wine from a selection that seems endless the first time you visit. They have generous and well prepared appetizers here but seriously.....stay with the wine. Share a cheese plate or a flatbread but check out the wine. The server will bring you a menu and they don't really explain the whole tasting thing unless you ask. Avoid the temptation to order a glass and get a card and explore. It is really a lot of fun.

You load up a card with money and then you take your glass and get 2 ounce tastings from each wine dispenser located all around the bar. Its a really fantastic concept -- of course, when you do the math, you realize that they're making a LOT of money on each bottle. Assuming a bottle of wine is 24 ounces and you can buy each 2 oz pour for $3 or the bottle for $18... it makes a lot more sense to just buy the bottle. Instead of spending $72 for your \"tastings.\" Thankfully I have friends who are good at math so we figured that out early on. Here's a protip: If you've tasted a couple of wines with your card... you can then put that card to good use on anything. If you're not feeling wine, you can use it to buy booze. If you want a bottle, you can put it towards that. It works just like a gift card to the restaurant.

You load a card with however much money you want to spend, and when you find a wine you want to taste, you simply put your card in the reader and dispense your taste. It is nice to get to try a couple different wines in the same variety and some wines that maybe are new to you. You are in control of how much you spend (all the tastings are labeled with how much they cost, and the reader automatically subtracts that amount). If you find a wine you really like, you can also apply the balance on your card towards the purchase of a bottle of it. If you do a lot of tastes only, it can add up (tastes ran anywhere from $2.40 - $8+). But, it is really the experience you are paying for.

I am not a wine drinker, so I had a glass of scotch (Macallan 18). I will definitely return!"], ["HJ B.", "Visited this fun & cozy wine bar during recent conference in downtown Indy. Excellent selection of eclectic, California, French, Italian, Austrian, German, Chilean, Argentinian wines by the taste or by the glass with a helpful \"library\" guide to each wine & its features. Best wine \"book\" and guide I've ever seen in a tasting room like this. Reasonable prices (spend as much or as little as you like with your wine card), comfy couches or bar chairs/tables, friendly staff, chipper crowd, and small plates of food to top it all off. Highly recommend if you're in the area -- holds its own with my favorite wine bars in Calif. -- whether you're traveling alone or with a group, you can't go wrong with this gem...also looks as if a few famous people have stopped in by the photos in the foyer!"], ["Ben H.", "Good place to hang out and fast many types of wine.

Which are still 100 times better than anything you will get anywhere else.I guess I take atmosphere into consideration perhaps even more than anything else when choosing a restaurant. This is yet again, one of my favorites. I love the option to sit at a high top or at the couches. Its a great place to go with friends or a date. An intimate atmosphere promotes classy mannerism and intellectual conversation. Definitely in one of my top five favorite high end bars in the city. I love the activity of tasting the wines and choosing a favorite, allows you to be adventurous in the smallest of ways.

How have I not been here before this summer!?! \u00a0I really, really enjoy Tastings.I'm a big fan of the vino, but not a big fan of paying out the wazoo for a bottle (or glass for that matter). \u00a0Enter, Tastings: the place to go to drink wine by the bottle on the cheap.So here's the thing. \u00a0They sell the bottles at 'retail' prices, which means that you can buy a decent bottle for around $20. \u00a0This is definitely the way to go unless you're really set on sampling and trying a whole bunch of things. \u00a0To do that, you buy a swipe card and walk around to get your own samples and pay by the 2 oz pour. \u00a0Again, I recommend the bottles as the server types come to you (less worky, more drinky). :)Bonus: their food is good, too! We had a cheese plate (4 kinds of cheese) and the Mediterranean sampler (think hummus, bruschetta). \u00a0The only bummer was that I asked for more little toasts for the cheese and we were upcharged $1.50. \u00a0Really, a buck fifty for some crackers? \u00a0My advice, just eat the cheese by itself.The service can run a bit slow, too. \u00a0It took a bit for our gal to bring us the check and then come back for the cards, but I assume it all depends on how busy they are. \u00a0My wine-induced joy was willing to overlook the slowness.Cheers!"], ["Jennifer S.", "Upscale atmosphere without the upscale attentiveness. \u00a0I love the concept of this place, but the layout is very funky with extremely limited seating. \u00a0Our girls night out started early enough for one in our group to grab a seating area of two leather loveseats in the corner for the 5 of us. Before I go any further - I must suggest you NOT sit here, as you'll be slumped over and uncomfortable. \u00a0Go for the red club chairs if not the bar seats (not appropriate for our group). \u00a0With that out of the way, I did enjoy the wines that I tried, probably moreso due to the fact that although you must pay for a 'debit' card to get your pours, at least the balance came back to you (how many Jillian's cards with a balance did I have left somewhere before they closed??). \u00a0The price points were well balanced, not making it unreasonable for you to have a few quality sips.The food looked and smelled divine, and I would have tried their menu had we not made dinner reservations elsewhere. \u00a0Overall, I'd say, yes - do try it. \u00a0Bring a date here EARLY, before dinner somewhere. \u00a0Late arrivals will not get a seat, so keep that in mind. \u00a0Be prepared to ask for instructions because it's not intuitive, and unless you're at a seated area, nobody will seek you out to assist."], ["Lauren R.", "I found tastings via a 4* yelp review and was looking forward to creative tapas and rare cheeses to go with a nice deep glass of wineI sat on the patio, order a wine I'd never heard of, and shared a cheese platter, crab dip, and red pepper hummus with a coworker. The wine was good, tons of selection. Service was super super slow and wasn't visited by the server for 20 minutes after menus were dropped offCheese plate was uninspired. Anyone can cut a wedge of cheese and put it on a plate. Show me some creativity with pairings! Cheap toast crackers, 3 slices of apple, and 8 grapes. Come on. \u00a0The cheeses were not outstanding. I tried 4. Costco quality. Crab dip was decadent and delicious, I recommend that definitely. Hummus was decent, mostly tahini, so very creamy and not heavy on the red pepper. Server disappeared after dropping off plates, never to be seen again. Literally. I had to ask someone else for the bill while the manager flirted with the bartender nearby. But the musical entertainment was lively on a Sunday evening and the wine selection was good and affordable, so you get a 3, Tastings. Go here if you want to eat basic cheeses and leave a small tip."], ["Kate B.", "We went to Tastings and split a couple of bottles of wine among friends. We sat outside and got the cheese plate. They have multiple price points of wine. The waitress helped us pick out a couple of bottles that were on the less expensive side but were still great. The point of tastings is to load a card with money and then try different samples of wine. Don't do that unless you are set on it. Sit and enjoy wine and some appetizers with your friends instead. You won't regret it."], ["Renita M.", "Schmancy!We spent a long weekend in Indy for a friend's wedding, and most of the bridal families and some of the party stayed at the Conrad (WAY schmancy) so we spent a couple of nights at Tastings hanging out.The set-up is interesting, you can pre-load a card with money and then go around getting tastes of 100+ different wines. The prices are on everything, but be aware that you're getting a 2 oz tasting portion, not a full pour. You'll have to keep pressing the button if you want more. You can also order wine by the glass or bottle off the menu, or get a cocktail or beer from behind the bar.The whole wine tasting idea is cool, but if you're left with less than $2.50 on your card, you'll have to go add a little more to get another tasting -- or ask them for a refund, maybe? I'm not sure how it works.They also have a menu of little bites and light dinner options. I nibbled on a triangle of margherita flatbread, and it was pretty tasty.Service was pretty good, the atmosphere is sleek and sophisticated ... if you're really into wine, it seems like a great option for a fancy night out. I suggest classing it up a bit in the clothing department; no raggedy t-shirts or yoga pants please!"], ["Mali C.", "Love it great concept very good food.. Oddly, even though there was lots of wine.. I have to say I wish there was more wine. \u00a0I love variety and trying the non standard selections out there. \u00a0They have a few of those but a lot more of the basics Merlot, cab, pinot, etc...Also I think it's a great non committal way for new and experienced wine drinkers tasting a variety of wines that they may have not tried before."], ["Scotty Z.", "Tastings is reeeeally...kinda OK.Definitely give it a taste (...rimshot?). Anyway, the good: you can sample all sorts of delicious varieties of wines while maintaining complete control of your wallet and pace. It's a great way to sample a $50+ wine w/o committing to the entire bottle. Their food isn't bad either--and they do have daily specials.The not-so-good: \"small\" doesn't always mean \"intimate\". The space is rather loud and slightly awkward. I've not had trouble finding a space, but I wasn't here during a \"pre- or post-dinner drink\" rush; I can imagine that space fills quickly.Again, all in all, give it a shot."], ["Joseph D.", "Here for the Haras De Pirque event.

They seem to make their money off the card driven sample machines. The prices for those machine samples are going to be on the high side. I have never been drawn into them.However, their bottle prices are really good. There is really barely a markup on bottles. The main con for Tastings tends to be their service. Service is really hit or miss. You could go there, busy or not, and get a server that is very attentive and knowledgeable, or have a server that you almost have to beg to bring you more wine. \u00a0If you go into it knowing that you should order your next bottle before the first runs out, it won't be too bad. The service is not miserable, it can just be a little slow. So remember, you're probably on a fancy date. Have some patience and plan your orders and you're good to go."], ["Carrie W.", "Great cheese board. Chill atmosphere. I actually had lunch here during a conference and it was perfect treat and break to get work done and relax a little."], ["Chirag P.", "Overall you're probably better just buying a bottle of wine here, but what's the fun in that. \u00a0Load up your card with some dinero and have at it... really fun idea and a great way to try a bunch of wines. \u00a0Also, the food is amazing... we had the flatbread with filet mignon and caramelized onions and the prosciutto wrapped dates... anything wrapped in bacon (or fancy bacon), i'm gonna order. \u00a0Go and have a fun night out there."], ["Yann P.", "This is a wine bar, with a little added thing that makes it great...Normally you have a menu and you choose your wine, a waiter comes and serves you.Here you also have a wine menu from which you choose, but then it differs... You get a glass, and then there are several tables where wine dispensers have been installed, and are ordered depending on regions or grapes. You get a card on which you load a certain amount, you insert it in the chosen dispenser and press on the button above your wine bottle... Don't forget to put your glass under the nozzle ;-)So you get yourself to choose the wines you want to taste by walking around all their bottles, reading the descriptions, and reading some of the recommendations from their staff. I guess you can also ask their staff to serve you but not sure about that.All this is to be complemented by some nice nibbles to eat like cheese or other tapas :-)"], ["Erin D.", "Such a fun little place!

We originally ordered a different pasta, but did not like it. We asked to replace with something else, and the manager came over, apologized (did not really have to), and said we would get our different order out shortly.

Although it is a chain (we try local as much as possible), we would definitely go back, and recommend it to others!"], ["Adrienne G.", "2 stars is described as \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" and that is exactly how our group of five felt about The Yard House. We've experienced better service. We've experienced better food. We've experienced better ambiance. My sister had a gift card so we thought we would give it a try after the Colts game. Yelp reviews looked good and we were excited to try something new. There was no wait and we were seated immediately. Our server was quick to greet us and take our drink order. Their menu is quite large and it took us a while to make a decision. We ordered the onion tower for our app, 2 bowls of soup (chicken noodle and french onion), and a Caesar salad. Entrees included the chicken cobb salad, fish and chips, roast beef dip, pepper jack burger and the grilled cheese with tomato bisque. After we place our order, our server kind of disappears and we are left with empty glasses. We don't see her again until she brings out the soups and salad. Why our appetizer was not brought out before this, I don't know. Nobody was blown away with the soups or salad. The onion rings were eventually brought out and they were OK. I would probably order them again.Our dinners were brought out and we dove in. I had the fish and chips and while their shoestring fries were great, the fish left a lot to be desired. Not much flavor in the beer batter and they were quite greasy. I tried the hubby's grilled cheese and thought the gorgonzola cheese was not necessary. Looking through the menu, I thought that about a lot of items. Like, they were adding ingredients just to add ingredients without thinking about how it will taste. Not a single person in our party finished their meal. We thought that maybe ordering desert would save the meal. Meh! First, when you put creme brulee on your menu, you might want to mention that it is covered in bananas. (note: the printed menu does not list this but the online version does.) Good thing we were not allergic. We also ordered the fresh baked brownie with vanilla ice cream. The brownie is served in the pan that it is baked in. Cute idea but the pan continued to bake the brownie and by the time we were half way through, the edges were rock hard. Ugghhh. Disappointed again!During our meal we had to constantly ask for refills, our server disappeared multiple times. I wasn't sure what style they were trying to go for. Romantic vibe with low lighting? Sports bar with multiple TV's? Family friendly? Not real sure.Not impressed. Won't go back."], ["Matt R.", "My experience was one of the 4 star kind... if they would have gotten my steak right the first time. It was just me and I sat up at the bar. There was a big screen TV with the Cubs game, 156 beers on tap, and pleasant, non-imposing, bar tenders. All was good... I ordered a Hoegarden draft and \u00a0a filet, medium rare. The filet came out and was well done... not an ounce of pink in the center... very far away from medium rare. I hesitated to send it back, but after all, it is filet... for $30, it needs to be right. After informing the bartender, and sending it back to the kitchen, the manager quickly came out and apologized. She agreed that is was overcooked and offered me a free brew while I waited for the new cut. The correctly cooked steak was fantastic. Cooked pefectly and atop a delicious peppercorn cream sauce. I greatly enjoyed it.

A group of five of us went. We were sorely neglected by our waiter, Drew. He faithfully attended to the group of college kids next to us even though I can almost guarantee that they wouldn't have tipped as much as we, but I digress. The neglect was so real that one of my friends had to fill her glass up with a bottle of water from her purse. Management saved the day. I'll talk more about that in a bit. We need to discuss food.I ordered a chicken dish that came with sweet potato pancakes. The chicken was ok. It was lacking salt, but maybe it was just me.The pancakes were super yummy. Totally made up for the chicken. For dessert I had their crem\u00e9 brulee. There wasn't much of that crunch that you look for in a crem\u00e9 brulee because they added bananas on top of the custard, then sugar, then torched it which made it a bit weird.

It was right across from our hotel and we heard it was good, so we gave it a try. The interior is really cool and trending. They have a TON of beers on tap, so it was cool to sit next to the bar. We got to half-yards, just for the experience . We also tried their weekend special bourbon drink and the citrus cocktail as well. All were very well prepared and tasted great. The food was so-so. Both meals were a little less exciting than I feel like they should have been. I got the chicken bowl, which was nothing special but still good. And my boyfriend got to bbq chicken pizza.

But I simply cannot.I worked down at Circle Centre so I have talked to a lot of people about Yard House. See, I am not a beer drinker...so to go to a brewery is just not the norm for me. But everyone I talked to said that the food was great so I decided to give it a try.We went in on a Saturday late in the afternoon around 4pm. I first could not believe how big they made this place. I also couldn't get over the fact that I was eating in what used to be Nordstrom. We were quickly seated and told that our server would be right over. We began to look through the drink and regular menu and began to discuss what we were going to ordered. Everything pretty much sounded good so it was tough to narrow it down.While we looked a guy came up and told us that he would get us our drinks while we waited for our server. I thought that was nice and ordered a diet coke and strawberry fields martini (it sounded good). While he was away our actual server came over and introduced himself. We started off with an appetizer just because we still didn't know what we wanted to eat yet. While we waited for that we narrowed down what we wanted and ordered the rest. This is the last time we see our server until much, much later.Every time that something was brought to our table it was done by a different person. When our main course came out no one cleared the plates off the table from the appetizer. Our server seriously never came back. My diet coke was refilled by one of the managers. It was so annoying...to the point where I do not know who actually got the tip.As far as the food goes: we started with the onion rings. They were amazing. They had a great batter on them that was full of flavor. It also came with a regular ranch and a southwest ranch to dip them in. For the main meal I went with a burger. It had a great grilled flavor to it and was cooked the way that I wanted it to be cooked. The fries had good flavor for being fries. All around the food was great!! My martini was not what I was expecting though. I have had flavored ones before that taste good but this was like drinking straight vodka. OMG it was a struggle to finish it...but I did as it was $11. If their drinks are based on that then they are worth the money because wow it was strong.When our server finally decided to return to the table and we told him that we did not want any dessert I would assume that a normal server would drop off the check. Nope, not this guy. We had to sit there and wait quite awhile for him to come back around to ask him for it. With how much this guy was not around I could have walked out without paying and they would probably not have known for quite some time. But I am not like that...so I obviously did not walk out without paying.I really wish that the service would have matched the price that we paid for the meal.

I have yet to find a good answer so I've decided to just wing it. I won't make it long (seriously, I won't). Atmosphere: It was cool. A mix of sporty intimacy, which seems odd. The bar had hundreds of beer on tap and that was pretty cool, but the booths had that unspoken romantic vibe about them and so did the dark lighting. The kitchen area looked great, such so that both my sister and I laughed about how we could see Chef Ramsey coming out of there slinging cusswords and plates. It's also very huge in there. I can see them being a hot spot for game nights, but I can also see people on dates in there. It should make for an interesting dynamic in the future. Food: The food was great. I ordered Louisiana Hot Chicken which was paired with Sweet Potato Pancakes (A first for me), which was really good! The food was piping hot when it arrived. We were there for Devour Downtown, so we also had a dessert and appetizer (not in that order). I got the Truffle Fries, which was a solid dance of thin french fries. The dessert I ordered was the peach and apple cobbler. I liked the mixture of fruit but not so much the topping. It was a bit too hard for a cobbler IMO. Service: Drew. Our server was Drew and upon his arrival at our table we knew he wasn't going to be great. He seemed so blase. Is that how you spell that word? Well, he seemed like he didn't want to be there, didn't want to serve us or just was all in his head about his recent life decisions (whatever they may be), but we gave him the chance to be great. He wasn't. Once our full party of five arrived, it became a cat and mouse game of getting Drew to our table. He wasn't there. He was every where but our table although he passed by us quite a bit. He waited on the table of college kids that sat perpendicular to our table quite often. Drew gave so few dambs about our table that my sister refilled her own glass of water w/bottled water from her purse. I on the other hand, discovered pieces of hair in my pancakes, which was a huge disappointment for some really good food. Drew didn't know this because he wasn't around. But the manager stopped by just to do a friendly round about check and I explained to her what was happening. She had me a new plate made and comp'd my food. She also refilled our water. Drew made a few guest appearances at our table, especially after taking notice of the manager (managers are in white shirts, servers in black). Too little, too late. But for the fact that we are a great group of people to dine out with, Drew could have ruined our experience a bit. But our laughter coupled with the caring concern of the manager worked it all out. Overall - Well, I dish those three stars out with my head up. I don't know if I will return. The food was great (without the hair) and the chicken was really juicy (fried). It's actually sad because I would like to try them again. Maybe some other time after I forget about Drew. The managers worked to save our experience and I give them all the points for being friendly, attentive, fixing and concerned. But Drew made us wonder why we were there when there are double digits worth of other places we could have chose from to eat for DD. Next time, I will skip Yard House.

It's equal to two pint glasses so if you're a light weight you might skip it. I, however, could not resist. When the thing came it was as tall as I was.

I went to the Yard House in Glenview, IL for my first ever visit. Great beer selection; huge bar and great music! I would give it 5 stars but...her meal was not very warm. Other than that...great place to go to. Will definitely go back!"], ["Angeleka D.", "I, personally, walked in the door hammered. I'm not bragging about that fact. We're all over the age of 25 here.And, although I usually try to not get designer drunk it was a special occasion (also known as Saturday) and the five new cocktail sign outside the door made me realize as an adult my life is full of choices. Sometimes it's five choices, and you get to pick at least two of them. So when I tasted the first cocktail I knew the rest of the night would be delicious!!!Early in the year, I wandered up in here when it was slightly still a construction site and told to come back for the good food. I had no idea they would come up with such a sleek modern environment when done. Thank goodness this place looks more fetching then a lot of wood and brass restaurants popping up. The entrance has a club feel to it, and they have a neatly displayed wine wall as well as brewery, and monster size bar of 120 taps. So on to the food!! I had the Baja Fish, Korean Street Taco and Cobb Salad and Captain Royce had the Ribeye and Grilled Shrimp. I will say I wasn't a fan of the Korean taco...there just wasn't enough flavor, spice, sauce to it. I've had authentic (cuz I'm all cultured and stuff) and when I say sauce I don't mean dripping. I mean that grease and grill fullness that reminds you heart burn is the third largest killer of joy in America. \u00a0I also want a little less crisp and more ferment in the cabbage, but that is JUST my annoying opinion. The shrimp, OMG bless their little souls for landing in Indianapolis. They were succulent, firm not rubbery or overcooked, they were salted, and grilled perfectly. I would hope the chef decides to add a few more to the side order instead of three. \u00a0The salad was delicious, the corn really added a crunchy sweetness to balance the flavor of the bacon and cilantro. The ribeye was amazing EVEN though Captain had it well done lol. \u00a0The mash had corn and just enough garlic to slay a vampire. The broccolini was perfectly crunchy and oiled. \u00a0This place is intoxicating and not just because of the taps, the food is superb! The staff is friendly!You should Try: The Bourbon Berry Sour, Malibu Peach, and Mashed PotatoesHow to Make Yard Healthier: \u00a0Sip on the Skinny Drinks, subtract the fruit garnish, or stick to diet coke/tonic. \u00a0Sub any of the taco shells for leaf lettuce wraps and request no added salt.

I went with a coworker for lunch on a Friday, so I can't speak to the beer menu - I did quickly peruse the list just for future reference and its definitely impressive - the cider lover in me certainly felt right at home and I'd love to come back and try Ace Pineapple, Woodchuck Raspberry and Crispin Pear. They have great lunch options - for around $10 I got a half pizza and salad combination - and was full all afternoon. I had the margarita pizza - bring your breath mints - there are whole cloves of garlic on those bad boys! The atmosphere is cool - definitely a good vibe. The service was friendly - our waitress was a BIT over the top chatty but I guess that is better than a bad attitude.Definitely will be back when I can take advantage of the beers on tap and I have heard the appetizers are wonderful."], ["Jesse W.", "I love yard house. Great customer service. I work there to i start on November 24 2015 first day of training. Everyone is great and so is the mangers they are nice sweet.

We learned about Yard House because of their participation in Devour Downtown, though we didn't order off of that menu. No, we chose items off of the menu with 100+ offerings. It was a little overwhelming and as many others have noted, often a red flag. Here's what I can say about our experience:-Truffle fries: shoestring, a little greasy, not skimpy on the truffle-y/herb-y/cheesy topping, worth the $4.95 price-(Mac and cheese)^2: not sure why it's called this, overall pretty good, white meat chicken was of good quality, big pieces of legit real crispy bacon, plenty of mushrooms, wish that it had a more traditional macaroni-type noodle-Service: attentive if not strange, waiter who was super prompt on refills but lingered way too much and took small talk to the next level, a little rushed (including delivering the entrees when we were only halfway through the appetizer)-Decor/Ambience: OK, cool views in beer keg and wine areas, huge layout, classy appearing but generic art on the walls, lots of TVs playing sports, ultimately I'm not sure what kind of vibe they're trying to create?This experience was surely A-OK. Not sure if I would come back or not. Definitely seems like a good option for a large group, as the food is relatively high quality and there's practically an infinite number of choices (a hard combo to find)."], ["Jessica P.", "I enjoyed this new many-tap beer bar. There's an excellent beer selection but it isn't quite in line with standard Indy pint prices. All the beers were at least a dollar more than they are at other pubs around town. Knowing this, I only got brews that are harder to find. Don't come here for the locals, you'll way overpay.The food was tasty but also on the pricey side. BE WARNED, the s'mores brownie is much more like a s'mores cake meant for 4+ people. whoa. It was warm and melty and delicious... just huge.I'm sure I'll be back (with a group to take down that brownie), especially if they keep Young's Double Chocolate Stout on tap..."], ["Christine B.", "I promise to post a review once I actually get to eat here. I came here on the same day I dined at Harry & Izzy's and the Yard House was my first choice. Unfortunately they were having ventilation issues in the kitchen so all they could do was make cold food. Seriously, why even stay open? I imagine they lost a ton of money that day. I'll try it again soon but hopefully they won't have something else wrong. When I found out that all they had was cold food, we walked out."], ["Cassie S.", "I heard from numerous friends to check this place out and you won't be disappointed. They were right, this place lived up to everything I expected, but also fell a little short in some areas. I'm not a huge beer fan, but I tried a craft cocktail and was pleasantly surprised with tropical taste it had. The atmosphere was like a traditional bar. I went on a Saturday night to watch a Cubs game and even though we were in Indy, the liveliness from the crowd made it seem as though we were in Chicago. The menu was really big (and going as hungry as I was) it was hard to narrow down the choices quickly. I asked the waitress what she would recommend and she couldn't say a clear answer, which in my opinion is a turnoff because the staff should be experts of the menu. I ended up getting the pork taco trio. It was really good, but the presentation was lacking. My date was simply not satisfied with his meal and said his burger lacked any flavor, even though the menu stated it was \"spicy\"."], ["Gretta G.", "The beer selection is amazing! There are, get this, THREE pages of beer. It's insane and I love it.I really enjoyed my food too. I ordered the Ginger Crusted Norwegian Salmon which consists of wasabi mashed potatoes, snow peas, carrots, and a spicy peanut vinaigrette. It was a massive portion! Enough for me to eat a second meal of it the next day.Most importantly (to me...and maybe you...) the bathrooms are EXEMPLARY! Every place in the world should have a bathroom like this. The stalls were spacious with large doors that actually go almost all the way to the bottom. In this bathroom you are not legs and hips with an anonymous chest and head so that everyone can view your underwear. It's the most properly planned restaurant bathroom I think I've ever been in. The latches actually work and say vacant or occupied and there is a large shelf over the toilet paper rolls so you can actually set your phone, keys... and let's get real here.. (wrapped of course! I'm not an animal!) lady product, etc. down. The trough sink in the ladies room was contemporary and the soap smells amazing. Everything was well stocked and lit in a manner that made all of ladies look like models while they washed their hands and finger combed their hair. It was a bathroom EXPERIENCE people."], ["Meredith S.", "...but why is the beer so expensive? I really could hardly get past the prices of this place. I just don't get why you would pay $7 for a beer that is normally $4 or $5 literally everywhere else. The place is huge inside and the beer and food menu is pretty expansive. \u00a0I got french onion soup and a caesar salad. Not bad... but not anything to write home about. Other people seem to love this place, so I guess I should give it another try. But damn... when the place offers no drink specials and everything is that expensive, I'd rather go pretty much anywhere else."], ["James C.", "First impressions! \u00a0Wow, what a bar! \u00a0Nice, trendy place full of mostly young pros, ladies on a night out and a nuclear family here and there.The bar itself is impressive with all of the tab selections, beer heaven!!!!I only tried the Spicy Tuna Roll (happy hour 3-6) $8 special appetizer. \u00a0It was delicious, well balanced with spice, guacamole and very fresh tuna. \u00a0The house Belgium pints are good value but kind of a high ABL (9%) but if your looking for that quick buzz, look no further.

Indy's finally got a top notch bar to be proud of. While Indy has its fair share of cool bars, the presence of Yard House has made me feel at home. The original was founded in Long Beach back in the day when I was doing recon in that area. I've scored so many, umm, top notch brews, that that I feel totally at home. I'm proud to finally have a new place to hang in Indy. The location feels a little bit \"secret\", yet it is right there near the mall. \u00a0You'll have to seek it out, but you'll be glad you did. I think they have a 10:00 PM happy hour too with both food and beer specials, which historically has been worthwhile. They have great food with the expected bar fare (burgers and pizza) plus a few healthy options. While the food is great, you'll be shocked to see the number of brews on tap. I think they have well over a thousand (don't quote me, as I'm currently about 10 in)."], ["Danielle W.", "One word, OVERPRICED. Yes, they have a really large beer selection and decent (as best) food. I had the Mac n Cheese with Truffle oil, which was gross and I would not recommend it to anyone.

My fianc\u00e9 and I had been looking forward to giving it a try since he had been to a location in California. We went on a Wednesday night and they were not busy at all. The place is huge, neatly designed. The beer menu is extensive, without a doubt and even their food menu has diverse offerings. Looking at the food menu after ordering a beer each and truffle fries, it became apparent that their food is overpriced compared to what you can get at other restaurants in walking distance. While they offer $15 gourmet burgers or $30+ steaks, that is way more than what similar items cost at nearby Rock Bottom or Granite City brewery restaurants. Harry & Izzy's and Palomino, both more upscale restaurants nearby, have superior atmospheres and food at similar price points. I ordered a Dogfishhead Punkin Ale pint and he ordered a local craft beer. Both were priced approximately \u00a0$2 per pint than what you pay at other restaurants downtown. The service was okay and the truffle fries were good, but not mind-blowing. It was $20 for fries and 2 beers, not a good value for Indianapolis. We left and ate dinner at Rock Bottom instead. Basically, they have a lot of overhead for that huge space and the prices reflect that, but we won't go back because there are local and chain restaurants (this too is a chain) nearby that are a much better value for your dollar."], ["Amy W.", "This place has an amazing menu!

But with that everything is really pricey - pretty noticeably so compared to a similar place downtown like Scotty's.

We each ordered three tacos. I had the swordfish, the pork belly, and the vegetarian. They were all delicious, but my favourite was the vegetarian surprisingly. It was a great mix of grilled onion, mushroom, and I think goat or feta cheese. I had it with Mac and cheese, which was pretty basic Mac and cheese.

The short rib taco included spicy papaya, sriracha aioli, and chili threads and the pork belly taco had radish kimchi, black & white sesame seeds and chili threads. Both tacos were excellent! The short rib was a little spicy with deep favor, and the pork belly was a little fatty with equally great flavor. Shoestring fries are always a favorite of mine and these lived up to my expectations.My wife chose the BBQ Bacon Cheddar burger. Besides the obvious, it also came slathered with BBQ sauce and garlic aioli. Dora here. This burger was giant and juicy and full of flavor! Yum!

The list at Yard House is the best I've seen, though. I went with a diverse beer palate -- some like fruity beers, others like Belgian-style, others like roasty stouts and porters. Yard House had local, quality, innovative selections in all of those categories and more. This was accented by a fantastic food selection, spanning many different regions and themes beyond pub grub, and all high quality. Best of all for a vegetarian, there was an entire gardein menu featuring meatless versions of popular appetizers and entrees. Our favorites were the lettuce wraps, the eggplant flatbread, and the a la carte tacos. The service was great, though it was pretty empty at the early hour we were there.

Beer prices were much higher than the average local market price. Food prices were above average as well. All in all a decent experience but too pricey for the quality offered.UPDATE: I decided to give it another try. I ordered a Surf and Turf burger with lobster and Swiss. I also got the clam chowder again and truffle fries. The fries came out cold but they brought me another order of hot ones. They were good, as was the soup. The burger cost $14 but was quite mediocre. It lacked flavor in the meat itself. I ordered it medium rare but I'm sure it was almost well done. It could have benefitted from some salt.

I am sure at least one of the pipes may be used to run the beer. But it is really dramatic to see all the pipes run to the bar. The bar is big, attractive and comfortable.They have a big beer list and conveniently sorted by styles. But, there is also a digital chalkboard with limited release selections.

My 1/2 yard took almost 25 minutes to get to the table - my friend's pints were almost gone by the time I got my large drink.And the fact that they only allow 3 samples - when they have over 200 taps - is more than slightly ridiculous.

There were 8 of us and we were seated right away. Our server was a little slow with drinks and answering questions, I could tell they had just opened and she was a little overwhelmed. She didn't really have any suggestions and couldn't offer her opinion when asked. We had four appetizers, jerk wings, crab and artichoke dip, BBQ pizza and chicken nachos. the jerk wings were flavorful. Would go back for their happy hour."], ["Brooke K.", "Here we go...I'm probably going to get a lot of hate over this 2 star review but I am just trying to be honest. This place has a huge tap selection, 100+. You can purchase beer in 3 sizes all the way up to half yards. I appreciate that there is a style for everyone. After looking over the beer list however I could't find much that I hadn't tried before. There are a lot of excellent flagship beers from local and national breweries here: Three Floyds Alpha King, Daredevil Lift Off, Flat 12 Hello My Name is Amber, Scarlet Lane Lenore, Lagunitas IPA, Left Hand Milk Stout, Founders Oatmeal Stout, Stone IPA, Bells Two Hearted, etc. however there isn't much available if your looking for something outside of the regular. Hey, sometimes a flagship is all you're after and there isn't anything wrong with that. These are totally legit beers but if you want something different this isn't the place. Then...there is the pricing factor....pints are between $6-$8. I saw Corona & Smithwicks on the menu for $7, now that is just missed up! Ordered a Founders on Nitro and it tasted off. If you're visiting Indiana and are looking for a convenient downtown option to try a variety of local and national brews that is huge with a commerical feel this is a great place to start...better yet, if you're in a tap room mood I would recommend heading on over to Tomlinson Tap Room (for local options) & a little further... Twenty Tap where you will find a lot of unique offerings in a more personal setting."], ["Adrianne S.", "I've officially just cleared the plate on the bed thing I've ever eaten. The Lobster Garlic Noodles were outstanding. From the listing on the menu to the presentation as it hit the table, to the fist sniff to the first bite. This was 100% worth the price, and the time. They use a spaghetti noodle, in a very light sauce toss in shiitake mushrooms, spinach crab, shrimp, lobster and garnish with parmesan cheese. This amazing combination will have me back over and over again. The servers are awesome, the environment is all good and the location is key for my downtown working lunches. I only have one wish: that you can get in here from the mall and not have to enter from outside. Others at my table ordered: the chicken avocado sandwich, Thai chicken noodle salad, chicken fingers, deviled eggs, jambalaya and jerk wings. We loved everything."], ["Earl T.", "Ok... Ok... I have to give it to Yard House... I've very rarely seen so many beers on tap. A few friends, my wife and myself thought we'd give their Devour Downtown menu a shot. I understand the bar atmosphere but it seemed a weeeeeeee bit too dark in here... Like, intimate kinda dark. The menu is HUGE! I was left cross-eyed trying to narrow down my choice until I remembered that I was here for the DD menu. *slaps forehead* The truffle fries and the sweet potato fries were great. The main course was an amazing mac and cheese with chicken and ginormous hunks of.... BACON! My wife wasn't disappointed in her food either... One member of our party found hair in her food and management was quick to send her a new order AND comped her meal. ... The problem this evening was our server.... Drew, what did we ever do to you, man. We watched as an entire table of college students was offered refill after refill and joke after joke while a friend of mine had to refill her own glass with bottled water that she had in her purse. Although a more than competent management staff tried to rekindle the flame of our experience, the damage was done. I can't say that I won't be back but it probably won't be of my own accord."], ["Steve F.", "Great food and awesome beer selection. \u00a0The Pan seared ahi is awesome ! \u00a0 Gotta try this place if you are a sports fan."], ["Joan H.", "Food was awesome. \u00a0Really good selection on beer, wine and cocktails. \u00a0A group of 6 friends visited tonight (Tuesday). \u00a0It wasn't a party night.

We loved the nice atmosphere and all the TV's. We were only there for a quick bite and not to really sit and socialize so we did not order any drinks. I ordered chicken fingers/fries, which were just average, nothing special. \u00a0My husband ordered pizza, which looked pretty good.

Tonight was my second time at Yard House and between the two, I'd rate it as follows:Service 8/10Food 7/10Environment 6.5/10The first time I came, our sever was excellent and extremely positive, friendly, and helpful. The second time, our server seemed to not truly care and was just trying to get through his shift. Food - truffle fries are a must! So delicious. I can't remember the food I got the first time, but tonight we split crab cakes and truffles fries. The crab cakes were disappointing because there were only 2 about the size of a fast food burger compared to the nacho dip appetizer for the same price that has about 4x the food. With 130 beer taps, drinks are always excellent. One of my favorite beers of all time is the Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale and they seems to have it all the time. Tonight, one that stuck out was the Dogfish Head 120 Minute (18% alcohol!!!). Yard House and Hopcat (in Broad Ripple) are tied for the most craft taps in Indiana. Environment is super dim. Plenty of TVs with sports on around the bar. Classic music. Millennial service staff. I would definitely recommend mostly because of the beer options. Other than that, it doesn't seem too special, but definitely worth going back."], ["S H.", "Seriously! Why...how....everything was just so so good! And when I say everything I truly mean everything! The atmosphere was very relaxed and just fun. Our waitress, Stephanie, was so great. She was knowledgeable of most of the menu and so helpful when it came to ordering. Not only that,but she was hilarious! ABOVE ALL ELSE the food was amazing! The truffle fries were a big hit at the table and \u00a0so was the smore brownie! I shared the black truffle burger and the spicy Thai pizza and they were both so amazing!The ONLY hang up is that I wish the truffle fries came with their own special dipping sauce."], ["Maeghan P.", "I was intrigued by this place and was eager for its opening. I went there for lunch with a friend the other day and I was not disappointed! The restaurant is gigantic and they seem very well staffed. I love how it is set up with a colossal bar in the middle. One of the main things I noticed is that there is quite a bit a space in the general bar area. There are huge tvs at every angle. I plan to watch some Stanley Cup Playoffs there in the near future. I think it would be the perfect place for that.Their beer selection is unbelievable. My favorite part about their beer selection is that they have a very organized list of all their drafts. It is separated into beer class and indicates the IBU of each beer that they carry. There is an option to get a pint, a 23 oz I believe and if you are daring, the yard. I ended up choosing a pint of Hoegaarden and it was delightful. The menu is very good as well. It is not just the basic bar food, the menu is unique and quite impressive. I was there during lunch time and they offer various lunch specials that are fairly reasonably priced. I was starving when I came in, so I split the lobster/crab artichoke with my friend and it was quite filling. I ordered half of a hot pastrami sandwich and a bowl of chicken tortilla soup which were fabulous. The only thing to be wary of is that there is only one entrance. There is not an entrance that is on the inside of the Circle Center Mall, like the other restaurants. There is only an entrance that sits on Maryland St."], ["Cody S.", "I felt underdressed waking in, but this place is like a fancy steakhouse and bw3's \u00a0had a baby. You might think that sucks , but I thought it was great. Over 100 beers on tap and really good food. Good place but leans more towards the steakhouse than the sports bar on the check....kinda pricy."], ["Emily U.", "I love that this place caters to vegetarian eaters with \"Gardein\" (pronounced \"gar-DEEN\"), a fake meat or beef substitute. It's nice to see a chain, especially in downtown Indy, that actually cares about diners who don't base their diets around meat. That said, it's kind of scary how few of their menu items clock in at under 600 calories. I think I counted two among non-meat options. Vegetarian does not necessarily equal healthy. Vibe-wise, I could barely tell the difference between this place and Kilroy's or Champps or the like. They were going a little overboard on the AC and a lot overboard on the amount of TVs. They have tons of beer options and a good selection of craft brews, but you'll pay almost $7 for a pint you could get elsewhere for $5. I guess this is the tourist premium."], ["Jb M.", "My first experience was not what I had expected, but I decided to give them another try and found the service to be much better than the first time, in fact, I've been back at least 3 times. They have a very extensive menu which is great if you have people in your party who are vegetarians, vegans, and gluten intolerant. The one time our waitstaff said, tell us what you want we will try and do it for you. The last time we were there was during a Colts game. Again, the service was attentive, but they allowed us to watch the game without a lot of interruptions. I've had the vegan pizza several times and I would recommend it. Also the Kung Pao Calamari is a favorite. The people at the host desk are always friendly and helpful. I'm glad I tried it again."], ["A S.", "Great ambiance, great food! Beer selection was great. We got the margarita pizza and truffle fries. I would definitely come back again!"], ["Joseph O.", "Why does this place put jalape\u00f1o on everything? I was asking the server about what items have jalape\u00f1os on the lunch menu. I went with the Turkey Melt because according to him there were no jalape\u00f1os. He even went as far as to have put the garlic sauce on the side. Sandwich come out there are jalape\u00f1os. Sent it back and second sandwich comes out with just meat and cheese.

All the descriptions sounded awesome, but the taste was a 2 or a 3. \u00a0Our server was not knowledgable (couldn't answer any of our menu questions) and he put in our appetizer & entree orders at the same time, so everything came out together....which means all of it ended up cold before we could eat it.

Despite this, the service was excellent for a SLOW night for a well-established joint, let alone one that was absolutely slammed and opened less than two weeks ago!Our table was repeatedly bused, checked on by multiple different servers (including our primary one), we were once given a wrong beer and it was promptly pulled off the tab and the correct one brought in its stead.

We had the chicken and also a steak. They were pretty good, and they reheated well.We tried all the tacos. The chicken meat has no seasoning, the chorizo was excellent, the al Pastor (seasoned steak) was great also.We dined in.

I'd been a long-time fan of their 3107 Lafayette Rd location (now occupied by the equally delicious Guatelinda), and I kept hearing about a new LG spot on 38th Street, but never could find it. The sign is rather small and the new building doesn't look so much like a restaurant on the outside. Of course, 38th is a busy street, so it would be easy to miss. All was restored when my wife and I walked in and sat down to another long awaited El Salvadorean meal. In my opinion, they make the best pupusas and sopes in town. Okay, so I initially ordered platana frita (fried plantains and refried beans) and a sope de lengua (sope with beef tongue), two of my favorites. But, hearing my wife talk about pupusas made me want one, too. So, I added that. Same old story. Each item was plentiful in size and bursting with flavor. Sure, my eyes are always bigger than my stomach at this place, but with so much good food there, I find it hard to say no to my usual overindulgence.

Unfortunately the first two beers I tried to order, Sun King's Pfunk and the Blackberry Gose from 18th Street (Gary, IN), were out! After 2 strikes the waiter suggested I try New Holland's Incorrigible or Brugge's Pooka, which he knew to be on tap.

My first two experiences were great minus a couple of issues that I chalked up to just being a new restaurant. My most recent trip, and the reason why I dropped it down to 3 stars, was a little disappointing. My FAVORITE item on their food menu was their street tacos. I ordered them again thinking I was going to enjoy some awesome beer and tacos. I was wrong.I suppose I should have read the menu more closely, but I assumed I would be receiving the same thing I had in the past. Nope. On previous visits, the street tacos came out in three hard shell tacos with chicken. Along with the tacos was a cup of salsa that was fantastic when poured over them. The meal also INCLUDED a side of crack fries with cheese sauce. What an awesome entree!What was brought out to me on my most recent visit was not what I was expecting. The three tacos were now soft shelled and included completely different ingredients than before. WOW, these things are spicy. Maybe it is so you will drink more beer? They were larger than the previous iteration of tacos, I will give them that. However, I was informed that they did not come with crack fries and that I would have to order them as a side. Seriously? a $12 entree and you can't include fries? And to top it off cheese sauce is a $1 more when it was INCLUDED last time? No thank you. The beer was fantastic as always with enough choices to make your head spin.

How awesome is that! \u00a0They also had a nice selection of ciders and sour beers too, which always makes me happy! \u00a0Clearly, the crack fries were quite cracktastic and the other folks in my party loved their turkey burger and buffalo chicken sandwiches. \u00a0I will say that I got the chili (mainly to look like I wasn't JUST eating crack fries for din din, haha), but...it tasted more like refried bean soup.

The tap selection is, as you would expect, fabulous. So many options. I was also pleased with the prices, I expected that a vast selection would come at a higher price tag. However, this is not the case, many beers are $5. It was nice to see the little labels that show what type of glass the beer is served in. I am not familiar with which types of beers go into certain glasses, but I like the idea of seeing the pictograms. This is a great place to take a friend that doesn't like beer because they have such a wide variety, plus ciders on taps that make it easier to find something that they like. During our visit we had burgers to go with our beers. I'm a sucker for the smell of a good burger. I had the cowboy (may not be the precise name) burger. It was good, nice and juicy and cooked pretty close to how I ordered it. My boyfriend's burger was ordered medium, but came out med-well. I wouldn't make this a complaint though because we went on the day that the supreme court legalized gay marriage and HopCat celebrated by making all beers 50% (awesome!). Thus, they were really busy from 6p on, so perfection is difficult for any business. The \"crack fries\" are really good. They have a salty, garlicy goodness on them that makes it hard to not finish them before touching your burger. I would definitely come here again. Keep an eye on their specials. They have food happy hours and specials daily, so you can eat/drink here pretty inexpensively, especially considering what you get."], ["Gyamfua G.", "So once again this is not a full review as I only had beer (american ale Raspberry pint for $4.50) and some loaded crack fries.

With a place claiming they had over 100 beers on tap, had to try it out, but was very skeptical. Why? Looked too \"chainy\" for the neighboorhood that has three breweries in it already. Went in on July 3rd, mid-day. Went straight to the bar (no greeter in sight) for some beer. A dirty, wet bar that smelled like bleach. Huge strikes. Bartender was prompt and gave us menus, placed in the dirty wetness. What ever happened to greeting your guest, wiping down the bar (w/o bleach), drying it, then giving you some dry menus. Or, prepping the bar BEFORE the customer gets there. Reviewed the menus for a bit discovering they had around 30 local beers, in addition to many more, but couldn't take the sites and smells. So we left.This place has several locations in a couple states but I don't think they're chain. Regardless, my instincts were correct."], ["Kitty B.", "Yeah, I know it's a chain. Do I love it any how? Yes. Before moving to Sobro, Indy, this was the first place we ate. We've been back several times.

The food is consistently good, crack fries are wonderful, get them dirty."], ["Whitnie E.", "This is a pretty solid place for going out with friends and this is why. First, the place is huge with tons of tables. Each time I've been here, we've never had to wait for one. The atmosphere is interesting with plush booths, velvet posters, etc. The beer menu is HUGE (125, 130? beers). \u00a0There are so many different styles, everyone in your group is bound to find something they like. The menu is also pretty decent, and I've really liked everything I have tried here. My favorite by far is the turkey burger, which has hints of lemon and is so good. Their \"crack fries\" are also pretty good, with a salty/peppery seasoning on them (get the cheese to dip them in!!). Last time I was here, I tried the chicken tacos, and they were delicious, with enough heat in them to zing me, but not enough to turn me off of them. My sister got a turkey reuben, which looked delicious, and her fianc\u00e9 got a burger that he liked a lot.So lots of room + plenty of choices usually means a crowd pleaser in my book!"], ["Scott W.", "Went in this past Friday with my wife and a couple friends. \u00a0Visited because their online beer list included three different beers my wife LOVES (Southern Tier Choklat, ST Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, and Alpine Nelson). \u00a0Low and behold, none of these beers were available and likely hadn't been for a couple days, as they weren't even on the on-site paper tap list where they've even crossed off offerings no longer available.I write this 48 hours later, those beers I noted above are still showing as available on the website. \u00a0I don't love the food at Hopcat but its worth going to me depending on what beers are available. \u00a0They need to do a better job of keeping their tap list up to date online. \u00a0Misinformation is what led me through their doors...good for them because they got our business, bad for them because it makes me less inclined to return because you apparently cannot count on their representations online. \u00a0Lastly, in my previous review, I mentioned they are downright ripping people off charging $12 for a Three Floyds IPA on draft that costs less than that for a 22oz bottle at the store. \u00a0Prior to our visit on Friday I saw again, they were listing another FFF's IPA, Cimmerian Sabertooth, for $12 a pour. \u00a0OUTRAGEOUS! \u00a0Funny enough, I couldn't help noticing that beer wasn't actually available either and is still showing online right now as on draft."], ["Kinsey C.", "I have been here probably a dozen times since HopCat opened in August. \u00a0Each time there is a new beer for me to try. \u00a0I love the variety and how often the selections are rotated. \u00a0I'd come here just for the awesome beer selection, but it's just a bonus that the place has pretty good food. I don't know where Crack Fries got their name, but they are definitely NOT addicting like the name leads you to believe. \u00a0They are just regular seasoned fries, and not even the best in town- Hell , not even the best in Broad Ripple.

If yelp had caught my interest earlier, I would without a doubt have 30+ check-ins here just this year. \u00a0I'm only telling you this as my review won't be able to portray how much I love this place. Okay...First, I just want to say that there are NOT 150 beers on tap. That yelp review is off and shows up first thing on Google, so it may need corrected. Parking in the garage or meter parking on the streets (typical for hanging in Broad Ripple). If you go during lunch throughout the week, Hopcat will cover garage parking.130 craft beer options on tap! The only other place in Indiana that has this many is Yard House downtown with 130 taps, but Yard House doubles a few of theirs and don't alternate like/as much as Hopcat does. Hopcat also features a \"local 30\" for $5 each that never changes, but aren't the only local beer options and on Mondays (maybe other days as well), the local 30 only costs $4. They serve liquor and wine as well. As for food - it's excellent, but not top tier. I consider myself a huge foodie and love their food, but a friend thinks it tastes like rubber. If you go in trying to compare it to a trendy fountain square or downtown restaurant that focuses on food and presentation, you will be disappointed. Go to Northside Social up the street for that. At Hopcat, beer is the focus and food is complimentary to that. The main focus on the menu seems to be the burgers (one called the \u00dcber for $17), but my friend always gets sandwiches or tacos and said those are excellent. My go-tos are the buffalo rolls to warm up and an Olive Burger with crack fries. The crack fries are addicting, but nothing to die over. Get them loaded or with the bar cheese for sure. Environment can be best compared to a Hard Rock Cafe, but brighter, more positive, and just generally overall better. Plenty of bar, booth, and table seating, TVs, framed paintings of famous musicians line the walls and above the bar, mostly classic rock playing, Rolling Stone covers lining the bathrooms, and a cool staff and vibe that fits the environment. Another huge plus is the front window/wall opens up (similar to Chumleys or Ralstons) to let all the fresh air in. 90% of the time I went was with one or two guy friends, so we always went straight to the bars. I would not* recommend coming here for sports. They play them, but the TVs aren't in the best spots and are limited compared to going to a sports bar. Staff are cool/fun to talk to and most of the bar staff remembered us or knew us by name. I also want to note that they host limited reservation beer dinners that are awesome. At the Bell's Brewery dinner, we were served 4 courses and a beer paired with each course, including the dessert - all for $30 (I typically spend more on one sitting at the bar). I 100% recommend Hopcat to anyone."], ["Niki K.", "WOWZA do they have a large beer menu (all local breweries). Just went here for the first time and the place surpassed my expectations. The restaurant was way bigger than it looked on the outside and the service was really fast and friendly. The blueberry hard cider was incredible and actually tasted like the fruit.

My sandwich was the porter braised beef, topped with crispy fried onions and a small slather of blue cheese-black pepper mayo. The perfect amount of mayo, says this \"always on the side\" mayo eater. The beef was tender and I could definitely taste the porter. Crack fries? I'll order em by the pound next time.

Personally I give my girl a few of mine if she doesn't order any with her meal because I know in 10 minutes mine will be GONE! Its a busy bar atmosphere on most nights, to the point that I urge anyone showing up at a prime time (7-9) please get there early of you want to actually EAT at that time. The first time we went our waitress was nice, but she essentially forgot about us, taking 30 minutes to get our beers and drinks, then another twenty before our food, followed by an extended period again before our second round which we decided to end our night with after.

Obviously beer menu is enormous (I don't drink beer but did look at all the options). \u00a0Ordered a glass of red wine and the waiter seemed to indicate that there wasn't a choice in brand of wine they serve. Crack fries as everyone said was extremely good and decided to try out the veggie salad which worked well. \u00a0Dessert was a bit of an interesting choice since it is two Christmas cookies with ice cream in the middle.

Yes ... you will pay a pretty penny for some of these beers, but if its beer you love, then its worth the price. The place is always packed so be prepared to wait a bit if you're in a group. It was just me and my boyfriend so we were seated quickly. The servers never let us feel forgotten in the sea of madness which was something you might expect.

I have to say, the place had a great after-work crowd imbibing on local brews and hard-to-finds. I dig the layout - two bar areas, tables, booths and lots of space. It was a little loud, but that could just be 'cuz I'm getting old. But the music selection was perfect, so I'll roll with it. Service was great. I was tempted to ask our waitress to just pull up a chair and hang out with us (dang other tables needing attention). The beers were plentiful. I could pretty much eenie-meenie-miney-mo and hit something I'd like. The food, though, was kind of a letdown. The crack fries I'd heard talked about endlessly were meh. They were fries. Maybe they could take a lesson from our server - just be who you be. I decided to splurge and ordered the fish and chips (fried bites of fish nuggets on crack fries). They were heavier and bite-sizier than I expected. I tried a bite of my friend's grilled cheese - a little creasy for my taste (yeah, I know... I ordered fried fish) and heavy on the bread-to-cheese ratio. I'm not going to complain though - I didn't have to cook. I'll probably head back for a beer after work with friends sometime, though."], ["Kelly M.", "I'm giving Hop Cat a 4 because despite never finding a main menu item I love I come back for the beer and crack fries. The quesadilla isn't bad either but nothing really compares to how delicious the fries are. Definitely try them loaded at least once. A great option if you are looking for a place to go with a large group with diverse tastes. I find myself suggesting it as a good place to meet before or after shows at the Vogue. Several TVs but really not a great place to watch sports. I felt a bit annoyance at one visit when we asked to sit with a view of the TV. If you want to try a lot of new beers this is the place for you, but with The Tap opening downtown I may find myself going there more often. They do a great job of keeping everything updated and rotating in a lot of different beers. I was a little disappointed that there were not more Pumpkin or Oktoberfest options in late September. I felt like they had an overwhelming amount of IPAs in the spring and summer and I was hoping for a shift to a large amount of fall options. Maybe October will see more of those rotating in!"], ["Kyle B.", "The only reason I even gave Hop Cat 1 star is because I love beer and their beer selection is phenomenal; and you can't give a 0 because I tried. \u00a0After that the rating crashes harder than the stock market in 2008.

The only thing that kind of bummed us out was the service. Seemed like they were a little understaffed - glasses sat empty, we had to ask for condiments multiple times, stuff like that.

The atmosphere is great and the crowd is just the kind of crowd you want in a bar. Every time I come, they seem to be out of almost every beer I want to try, which has been disappointing. I've been here three times now and am still holding out hope that this was a fluke. Its not like there is a shortage of brews to choose from, so I will definitely be back. Another thing I have noticed, there seems to be a significant pricing difference in some of the beers on the menu. On one visit, I paid $5.50 for my drink, while my friend paid $9. That was interesting to me and a little bit of turn off, to be honest. I like places that have consistent drink prices for all of their pours - think Twenty Tap, The Pint Room, etc. Not a huge deal but I'd definitely reconsider getting a certain beer if I thought it was too expensive compared to similar brews on tap. Everyone's talkin' about the crack fries, so I will too. They are good and definitely worth ordering, however, I've definitely had better elsewhere. Just my two cents. The rest of the food is pretty good too - I've had the fish sandwich and really enjoyed that and also loved the chicken salad wrap."], ["Michael B.", "Hopcat has a huge space in a great location, and I was excited about the so-called \"crack\" fries and huge beer selection.I came away a little disappointed - it seems like they haven't quite figured everything out yet.

Even after ordering them our drinks lagged way behind how long it usually takes to get to the table -hopefully something that gets worked out over time.Ordered a burger which was quite good, and the fries were good but not great, although calling them crack fries sets the bar pretty high. The atmosphere was energetic and busy - lots of space for groups. It was a little loud though with music turned way up, escalating the volume of everyone talking with it.Overall if I'm heading to Broad Ripple this isn't toward the top of my list for now, but hopefully as they smooth out the service over time things get better.

The teaspoon of very finely diced pico was enough for one piece of quesadilla and was not made same day...or the fineness of the dice made it appear as if it were a day old pico.Fresh avocado is available upon request for $1.

HopCat was bigger than I expected, with two bars, tons of seating and an awesome patio. Sadly, it was raining, so no one was using the patio. Even with the rain they opened the doors and we got a table with a view. The rock star decor and the insane beer geek atmosphere made it kind of like sitting in on a Rolling Stones party. There is custom artwork on the walls and the bar has a great mash up of modern and traditional decor, while still being warm and inviting.Four of us made it through about sixteen beers, passing them around and trying a little bit of everything. Sun King and Upland brought the mother load with thirty beers each. Sun King dominated with its Kings Reserve and barrel aged brews. My favorite from them was the Cuvee de Sun King, a lightly sour dark cuvee and the Isle Barrel Aged Wee Muckle, their Wee Muckle aged in scotch whiskey barrels. Other awesome brews, were Triton's French Toast Saison, and Three Floyd's Big Tiddy Assassin and the Upland Pineapple IPA.There were so many beers that I feel like I barely scratched the surface. I would have loved to drink the entire list. I'm excited to see how long some of the great Indiana beers last on draft, and I know I will be stopping in this week to get whatever left overs they have. If you weren't able to go to the release, go soon! This is probably more Indiana beer options than we have at most festivals and I would be sad if anyone missed it.Now, all these great Indiana beers won't be there all the time, but the food will and the food was outstanding. I got a pretzel breaded pork tenderloin. That's not a tenderloin on a pretzel bun, that's a tenderloin breaded with pretzel crumbs. The pretel crumbs gave it a really dark color, that almost looked burnt, but it was not even close. The pork was juicy inside and the pretzel really gave it a unique flavor and a crispy outside. The beer cheese soup was insanely good. It was so rich, that it was probably more like a cheese dip then a soup.On top of all that, the crack fries were pretty outstanding. Their crack fries are a lightly spicy seasoned french fry. They are awesome standard but can be loaded and topped with some great options. Brie got her go to, mac and cheese, and was happy about the gooey cheese and noodles. Everyone at our table really liked the food and for as busy as they were the service wasn't bad.

Additionally other servers cleared empty plates and glasses as they walked by. I always believe that shows good leadership by the front of the house. Food came quick from an expediter also nice guy.

My daughter said her hambuger was heavenly and the misses loved the \"adult pizza rolls\".Lastly the the beer, it is cold and comes in so many delicious varieties I wanted to tell the family to head home and I would catch an uber later Alas I didn't but I shall return.

I bumped this place up to 3 stars only because their french toast is the best I've ever had in my life.

Our cocktail came, but the water oddly took a long time to get to us, which was awful because I was so thirsty. However, it finally came and I could have given our waiter the biggest in the world.So then we decided order the goat cheese, alas de pollo (super SUCCULENT chicken wings) and calamari frito.The goat cheese with the tomato and garlic bread was almost to die for. At first, it's kind of strange but then you notice yourself not being able to stop dipping the bread in the cheese and just continuously munching on it.Calamari frito really wasn't my favorite. I usually like calamari, but this was just a little dry. It wasn't bad, but it was just a bit underwhelming.Like I said though, those chicken wings were super delicious, succulent, juicy and just everything you need in a chicken wing with a wild cultural twist.I would be lying if I said this was my favorite restaurant in the world, but it's a pretty good place to at least try out at least once."], ["Jason O.", "I really like the variety of choices on their lunch buffet. \u00a0Lots of veggie, meat, salad choices. \u00a0Neat building with a cool feel inside! \u00a0I haven't tried the outdoor seating but that looks nice also. \u00a0I've been here a couple of times and I've been impressed with both the food and service!"], ["Sigrid F.", "I highly recommend checking out the Sunday Brunch buffet.

I am partial to the made to order items, which are also included and you can eat as many of those as you want. The French toast is to die for, light and fluffy, served with a vanilla sauce, berries and a dollop of whip cream. There are omelet made to your liking and Eggs Benedict.

But, we are very glad we did!Me: Vegetarian. Boyfriend: Meat lover galore. - We were both fully satisfied here!! We ordered tons of food, I really enjoyed the onion & potato casserole (that had an amazing Spanish dip to go with it) and he really enjoyed the mussels, shrimp, and Spanish sausage. I did order a cauliflower dish - which I wasn't crazy for - so I wouldn't recommend it. But we did share a dish of goat cheese with tomato sauce, which was AMAZING. We topped our dinner off with bread pupping! Yum, yum, yum!

Everything from the warm and cheerful decor, to the solid drinks selection at the bar, to the DELICIOUS TAPAS.Definitely order ALLLL the meat off the tapas menu. If you're intimidated from the exhaustive menu, some highlights to definitely include are: the tenderloin steak, lamb shanks (small portion, but so worth it for the rich butter sauce), meatballs (huge portion), and tuna. Fried calamari was also delish. And because a balanced diet includes earth-things, I also recommend the roasted cauliflower and spinach empanadas. The paella was impressive, but order early because they take forever to come out.If you're around for lunch, their lunch buffet is $10 and similarly yummy.My friend from Spain remarked Barcelona Tapas wasn't authentic, but agreed to come here again a week later.

Tapas is a natural fit in the new 'small plates' move on the Indy culinary scene. The food is always hot or cold appropriately. In general the food is well seasoned and approachable. The Devour Downtown menu this year was very good and showcased some of the best the restaurant has to offer. The lunch buffet is a good way to check out a variety.

Coupled with a decent selection of drinks, Barcelona is a pretty unique in downtown Indy, let alone Mass Ave. Still, for some reason, I usually forget about Barcelona when I'm looking for a place to eat. I think it's because, while so many new places are popping up in downtown, Barcelona has largely maintained the same formula and menu for many years -- a lot of good food but nothing so surprising and exciting that it keeps me coming back.

Next we had fresh garlic chicken wings and fried rice with chorizo and shrimp ( the rice was my least favorite as it was a little dry and flavorless). Finally we had churros filled with strawberry and caramel dipped in warm chocolate sauce.

I know tapas means small plates and I know the portion sizes are smaller and shareable but their sizes were ridiculous on some of the plates. The chicken skewers, which took an extra 10 min than anything else, was literally one skewer with four little chunks of chicken for $7!! I could buy 2 pounds of chicken for that price! The garlic wings were good as was the lamb. The manchego plate was a joke. It had four tiny pieces of cheese with what looked and tasted like a fruit roll up on top. I will say the tres leches did live up to the hype and was worth every penny. Simply delicious and, finally, a generous portion.

Paired with crispy garlic bread, it's a must have.Triples:Solomillo con Cabrales (Beef Tenderloin) - A tad chewy, but well-seasoned, cooked to order, and paired well with bleu cheese and spinachPatatas Bravas (Spicy Potatoes) - Better than most we've tried, nice spice, could've used a bit more seasoning, plenty of bang for your buck.Double:Gambas al Alioli (Garlic Shrimp) - Cooked well, married well with the chili oil and lemon, but seemed to be missing an ingredient or two. Single:Calamari Frito (Fried Calamari) - Very basic. Little taste, luke warm, wouldn't try again. Nothing separating it from your basic greasy Mediterranean/gyros joint.That's the food.... Service was great, hopefully not just because of the lack of clientele. Interior did what it was supposed to do; it felt like a Spanish tapas bar. Soccer (futbol) on every TV, flags, jerseys, the whole nine yards. I did notice some lacking in the cleaning department. Fairly dusty inside, floors needed some cleaning. Gave of an almost \"under construction\" feel. Long and the short, solid tapas, plenty of well paired libations available, and all the futbol you can handle. Worth a visit, but not topping any of my lists."], ["Brad A.", "The Sunday brunch is amazing! For less than $20 you get unlimited food and sangria. \u00a0Excellent quality buffet style authentic Catalonia (Barcelona area) food in Downtown Indy.

The goat cheese marinara was to die for! Also incredible vegetarian paella and moderately priced bottles of cava. The whole bill came to 80 dollars and we ate off the food for three days - much larger than normal tapas style portions. Service was spotty, but the food was incredible."], ["Jon C.", "Sunday brunch is important to me, and I look forward to it all week long. Finding the right location is important, and I much rather wake up and enjoy brunch with friends at the table rather than waiting on one with other people who haven't had their morning coffee yet. Last Sunday I got together with a group of 10 of my friends to Barcelona Tapas for Sunday brunch. Barcelona Tapas uses OpenTable for online reservations, so getting in is quick and easy, and after you see the brunch buffet, you'll want a table as quickly as possible.Unlike dinner, most of the food is served on a buffet, with various salads, egg dishes, meat and cheese trays, cedar planked salmon and pasta. On this particular visit, they also had curried pork loin on the buffet, but the meat dish rotates. In addition to the 20 or so items on the buffet, you can all order small plates off the menu, like Spanish omlettes, tres leches French Toast, Eggs Benedict Spanish style (chorizo instead of ham). They usually feature a specialty dish too;this visit it was biscuits and gravy. The price of your brunch includes a glass of their sangria, either red or white. Most people I go with tend to prefer the white over the red, but both are excellent. For an additional charge you can make use of their Bloody Mary bar, which features a great bloody Mary mix by Hoosier Mama.Even if you've been here for dinner before and didn't have a great experience, you owe it to yourself to give it another try. I'm glad I did; it's quickly become one of my favorite brunch places in Indy."], ["Marty G.", "My first experience with tapas food, and I really enjoyed it!I didn't have an idea of what I would like, but I ordered 3 things: The curried chicken salad, Tortilla Espanola, and the baked goat cheese.I love curried chicken salad, and their rendition was no exception. The chicken was well cooked, the dish was well seasoned, and the flavor balance was exceptional. A nice starter to my meal.The Tortilla Espanola was my favorite dish - a nice quiche-like dish with potatoes and onions. I might ditch the other two dishes to try something new on a return visit, but this one's a keeper.The baked goat cheese was great, but it was a bit rich for me to finish. Just goes to show I should have shared!All in all, I'd make a return trip to Barcelona."], ["Tarun G.", "Nice dish ideas but all of them had too much oil, salt, and aioli. Very disappointing.

It is a cheery red and yellow beacon amidst the city gray.Within the confines, a seriously cozy vibe is to be had. Burnt orange and other shades of red and yellow abound. Tastefully placed FC Barcelona flags/scarves are to be found in the nice bar area. A nice touch, even for this FC Bayern Munich fan!Beyond the Spanish soaked decor, the menu is pretty cool. A lot of tasty tapas, of course, and some mean paella. The lunch buffet is Monday through Friday and, while not huge, has some good choices. It is a good option to get a feel for the rest of the menu with such things as:Chicken and shrimp paella, pasta rioja, baked goat cheese in marinara, gazpacho shots, dates, figs, Spanish olives, beef and chick peas. Just a few examples. Each day may be a bit different than the last. The price for the buffet at the time of this review is a very reasonable $9.95.

The Albondtgas and the Colifor Al Azafran were my favorite tapas. The Tres Leches is to die for so make sure you save room for dessert. I would come back just for the dessert.

Hells yes!!\" I was not disappointed. There's metered street parking right in front, so if you head there during a slightly off hours time, you can get a great parking spot :)There were children playing inside, which off the bat tells me this is a family-owned restaurant. Good. Seating consists of booth seats across the back wall with tables and chairs on the other side. We sat at the raised platform, next to the tv with salsa videos running constantly. The music is dope. \u00a0You'll have fun. Our server was friendly and we got the hummus as an appetizer. Since this place is billed as Dominican/Middle Eastern, we thought that was interesting. The ME aspects consist of hummus, tabouli, and a gyro (so it is rather minimum). The hummus: grade B. It's solid, with a thick consistency. But it's not exceedingly special. For a gal who grew up near Dearborn, I have yet to find great hummus in Indy. The pita bread was warned (yay!) but just one circular piece of regular pita you purchase at the supermarket. And it was not enough for the hummus; unbeknown to us the extra pita we requested was $.75. For $6 this is a rip-off, given the quantity and quality. I know I'm perhaps spoiled by great hummus and pita from where I'm from but...Luckily the main dishes - both Dominican - are hella good. Stick with this part of the menu.Me: Mofongo with chicken and a side salad. Every entree gets a salad and side but not Mofongo (cause it's a lot). I still got an order of the fried plantains. This? AMAZING. A PARTY IN MY MOUTH. I had Mofongo in the PR and loved it. This was great. Amazing. Scrumptious. The chicken in the side dish is cooked on the bones in a succulent (seriously) sauce. The salad is meh - lettuce, onions, and 3 cucumbers, but who cares about that. MOFONGOALL THE WAY. \u00a0Him: goat in a sauce that he says tastes better than my chicken and Mofongo. Side of beans and rice, which were awesome. The side of fried plantains were great. If you've never had them before, think of potato chips. They come with what seems like a mayo-based sauce. He loved it, but I don't like mayo so I wasn't a fan. Altogether, I cannot wait to go back. A true gem in downtown Indy!"], ["Sam K.", "A delightful find! I heard about this place from a coworker. It's located just east of the Central Library in downtown Indy, just a few blocks from where I work. It is a somewhat unique combination of Dominican and Greek food. The ambiance inside is nice with soft merengue music playing in the background. The favorite dish of most of my coworkers is the Yaroa, otherwise known as loaded Caribbean fries. I honestly don't know what is on these, but they are SO GOOD and incredibly addicting. My best guess is chicken, fries, and some delicious mystery sauce. You can order a small order and share it with many people. The only sad thing is that they can't come as a side. However, many of my coworkers will simply get an order of the small loaded fries as the entire lunch meal. I love the Gyros and the Falafel for the main entrees. The fries that come as a side are still delicious, though not to the degree of the loaded fries. The service has always been good and friendly, though there are usually not many other people in there when we come in. We are usually in and out within 45 minutes, which works well for a lunch break. It seems like there are some regulars that come in pretty frequently. The last thing that helps everything out is that the food is actually very reasonably priced. Most of the dishes are less than $8, which is great for the quality of food.All this to say, it's one of our favorite lunch spots at work and a great little place with a lot of culture and flavor!

I asked what was the closest thing to that and she recommended the pollo y sal (sorry for butchering the Spanish). After about 15 minutes the food came out as I was enjoying the sun. Wow! \u00a0What a lot of food! \u00a0Basically it was almost a whole chicken in a red sauce that looked spicy. I got this and a mountain of white rice and red beans all for $10. My mouth was watering, my blood pressure was rising to dig in. Unfortunately it stopped there, for all the great looks it really didn't deliver, the chicken was tender but not flavorful, and didn't taste like it had any salt. The red beans and rice were good, and the rice was well cooked and seasoned. But the chicken--oh for as good as it looked it just wasn't there for me. After the meal the owner came out to ask how I liked it, which was a nice touch. Maybe I just got the wrong thing.

I tried both the chicken and the cheese ones and they were fresh, crispy, delicious. The stewed chicken was ok. Tender, decent flavor, but I'm not a big fan of gnawing chicken off the bone. The rice & peas were very dry and lacked flavor. The salad (which I do not ever eat) was very fresh with lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber and a simple but tasty dressing on the side. I drizzled a little dressing on the rice side so it wasn't so dry. However, the lunch special of stewed chicken, rice & peas, and salad was under $5 so I can't fault it too much for it not being perfect. The menu has both Greek (shwarma, gyros, baklava) and Dominican (empanadas, stewed goat and chicken, flan) choices. The server was really nice and apologetic about my wait but she was also very slow. I found out later it was like her 2nd-3rd day. The patio is well-shaded in the middle of the day and with the breeze I really enjoyed sitting out there. It took 15 minutes to get a glass of water. My food took 47 minutes. That's completely unacceptable. There were 6-7 tables, when I first sat down there were only 4 (2 couples outside, 4 guys together inside plus one other 2-top).

A hispanic couple sat down about 45 minutes after I did and got their drinks within 3-4 minutes of sitting down and their food came out about 5-10 minutes after mine did. Why is all of this down-to-the-minute? I had to feed the meter! I was very aware of time because I'd set the timer on my phone so I wouldn't get a ticket. The part that really ruined the experience for me was the people who seemed to have ownership of the place: a younger latino man and woman. The man came around, delivered food, refilled drinks, and checked on all the other tables on the patio TWICE but didn't talk to me a single time. The woman had walked in around 12:30-12:45 wearing a little backpack and had stopped to chat (in Spanish) with the couple who came in 45 minutes after I did. When I went inside to ask for a box, then went inside AGAIN to ask for a check, this woman was apologizing to a man, saying \"Sorry to keep you waiting...this is my brand new server.\" If you have a brand new server, why would you roll into your restaurant that late in the day? Leaving her to fend for herself for at least an hour? She never apologized to me for my wait, and didn't say a single word to me. Didn't ask how the food was or anything else.

From the time that we ordered to food hitting the table was under 10 minutes, so no complaints on service.I don't know if this has always been the case, but they also serve beer and have an outdoor patio for when the weather warms up. The owner came and chatted with us about how they make their food, which was a really nice addition to the whole experience.They have sandwiches for around 5 bucks and big entrees for 10-15 dollars, so I would say that this is way better value and more interesting cuisine than what Saffron offers.Oh! And to celebrate rolling out their expanded menu they're offering 25% off all their menu items next week (April 29-May 4). This is definitely a restaurant that fills the friendly, cheap, tasty hole in the wall gap that's been going on in Indy!"], ["Kenneth F.", "Waited an hour for my meal... They brought out the wrong thing... Waited another 30 minutes... Need I say more??? Absolutely ridiculous in my opinion, and it's not like the food is all that cheap. For the location and what they offer, I would expect the level of service to be better. Guess we got put back at the bottom of the serving cue when our orders were messed up..."], ["Jenny A.", "I'm a Dominican New Yorker visiting my brother in Indianapolis (he moved here for work). When my brother told me he found a Dominican restaurant in Indianapolis. \u00a0I told him he had to take me. The food is delicious! Very well seasoned just like abulea (gradmother) would make it. The tamarindo drink took me back to my summers as a child. Oh!!! And the music!!! I couldn't stop singing to all the great classic sala & merengue songs! I'll definitely be stopping by again b4 I depart back to New York. The owers are super friendly and the food was served pretty quick. If you like well seasoned food that's not spicy then try anything on the menu trust me you will not be disappointed!"], ["Melyssa H.", "Fresh squeezed juices for $3 are the best deal in town! \u00a0I typically pay close to $9 for them at the juice bars. \u00a0I'm glad to know Panorama is downtown and I'll be a frequent visitor for their delicious fresh squeezed juices and their nice variety of healthy salads."], ["Kjirsten K.", "I was excited to see a new restaurant open up where Urban Element used to be and after reading the first couple of reviews, I decided to give it a try. \u00a0I was a little disappointed by the food. \u00a0I got the lunch special which included Chicken Shwarama and french fries. \u00a0The menu described the dish as chicken and some veggies in a pita, but instead I got just a bunch of chicken in a pita and that's it. \u00a0The sauce had fallen to the bottom so for the first half of the pita there was a limited amount. \u00a0Coupled with french fries, the whole dish was kind of boring, uninspired, and a little greasy. \u00a0I would have preferred veggies, rice, or some type of middle eastern side with the shwarama to complement the middle eastern spices used to flavor the chicken. In all, it's just doesn't stand up to Saffron Cafe, which is basically in Panorama's backyard. And while it isn't necessarily the same food, (Saffron is purely Moroccan) there are similar menu choices. \u00a0(Gyros, kabobs, etc.)Because I believe in second chances, I will likely give Panorama another try. \u00a0It's so hard to judge a place by just one visit. \u00a0Perhaps with a little more time under it's belt, and a different menu choice, Panorama can hold it's own in a neighborhood with such big shoes to fill."], ["Eric M.", "Looks like this newbie replaced Urban Element, but I guess the UE guy still owns the building, so the flexible decor hasn't changed a whole lot. \u00a0The Mediterranean/Middle Eastern menu isn't big but seems fairly adaptable, at least based on my experience there--you can substitute and mix-'n-match to your little heart's content...except for the salads, for some reason (and why not?). \u00a0Ingredients were impressively fresh: while the Greek salad was a bit more generous with the dressing than is necessary, it was flavorful and not to the point that it was waterlogged. \u00a0As for a combo kebab (your call on the meats) the chicken and particularly the lamb were memorable, but most impressive were the veggies: fantastic tomatoes, onions, and peppers.On the other hand...I ordered a water (with lemon) and an unsweetened iced tea (with lemon), and I'll be danged if I could tell which one was which. \u00a0The service was accommodating enough to ask how we were doing every 5-8 minutes, which isn't too hard since there were never more than one or two other tables occupied...but then when we talked after the meal was over, our dirty dishes sat there in front of us the entire time. \u00a0Lastly, on a 102-degree day, the place apparently had no functional air conditioning. \u00a0It didn't seem all that unbearable (which is why I said \"apparently\") but we're tougher than the usual blokes, and how would it have been if the place actually HAD been crowded?The place is obviously still finding its way, but the food seems pretty solid. \u00a0Panorama Grill may really need to distinguish itself amidst a lot of Greco-Lebanese competition, and at this point, adding hookahs outside would probably just be a cliche. \u00a0Getting the whole experience right--rather than just what appears at the end of the fork--should help ensure repeat business for yours truly, and maybe some others, too."], ["Monica K.", "I was so excited to see that Indy had a Dominican restaurant, and was hoping for some authentic Dominican beans & rice. What was served tasted like it was just out of a can. It had no flavor or seasoning whatsoever. The fried chicken was completely over cooked and had very little meat to begin with. Apparently the AC was not working so it was pretty hot with it being in the mid 90's outside. Fortunately it was far from crowded so the temp was bearable. Not a very good experience overall."], ["Catherine K.", "Not wanting to fight the long lines to get into the Pride Festival right after the parade ended, we decided to head home. On the way, we saw that the Panorama Grill was open. Located in the former location of Urban Element, I was excited to see a restaurant in our area actually open for lunch on the weekend! Bonus that I love Middle Eastern food.The menu is small but covers the basics; I ordered a chicken shwarama with garlic sauce. I was pretty much on the edge of my seat to get the food because I have a long-standing love affair with garlic sauce. I can eat it by the truckload. Problem is, I haven't been able to find a good version of it here, at least not what I am used to having from growing up in Metro Detroit. I was a bit disappointed when my shwarama arrived -- the pita didn't look or taste housemade and I couldn't see any garlic sauce. Sad Panda.But, my fiance saved the day! Having ordered the shwarma entree, he got a side of garlic sauce. And -- get this -- HE HATES GARLIC! \u00a0I dipped a piece of chicken into the sauce and MMMMMM. Yes! Finally! Success!When the waitress came out, I told her how excited I was over the garlic sauce. When I told her of the restaurant I used to go to in Dearborn, Michigan, my street cred instantly increased. She knew I knew my sauces. :) She brought me extra and even told the owner how excited I was, lol. A few quibbles: Service was enthusiastic yet scattered. The restaurant has only been open for 3 weeks but the servers were all at least in their 30s, so I don't think inexperience was the issue. Fries were extra with my shwarma -- had I known they were $1.95, I would have passed. As I said, the pita, although not stale, definitely didn't taste fresh. The restaurant I'm used to makes them on site and serves them as soon as you sit down. The restaurant was pretty busy, which was nice to see, I'm sure partly due to the number of people downtown. They are open for lunch and dinner 7 days and a week and have a small deck with 3 tables for outdoor seating. I'm guessing a shwarma or gyro from here will become part of my weekly routine -- along with a soup bowl full of garlic sauce!"], ["Michael S.", "Restaurant is under new ownership. The service was very warm and pleasant. We had the chicken takoom and gyro - very good! Would definitely go back"], ["Cassandra W.", "A friend and I were at the central library with our two little ones. It was freezing & we wanted to grab lunch. We had noticed this place *that we thought was called Mediterranean Grill* on the way in and thought, \"Hey, why not give it a try\". Enter some amount of regret. Not wild regret, just some regret. When we walked in, it felt like we were walking into one of those weird dreams you have after you drink too much and nothing makes sense. Our waitress was super super nice and super sweet but it seemed like she may have been new to the service industry. The TV's were on there was no music. They also didn't have any high chairs or booster seats. I can understand if you have only one, but none is kind of outrageous. Luckily the chairs they do have are big so we could both hold our babies and eat.We both ordered Falafel and it was fine. Nothing striking but it tasted fine and was warm. The menu has dichotomy but 'm sure that will eventually work itself out.While we were there a few other people came in & one table of 2 gentlemen ordered a pot of tea. They mentioned to the waitress at her second table visit that they had a meeting to go so they would just have the tea. She came back a 3 rd time without the tea asking if they wanted any coffee cake or any other menu item and they did not. After about 10 minutes had gone by without the tea, they had to leave. I think the place has potential, after all people want to eat lunch and that area is dying for more food options. They could use a highchair or two, some nice ambient music and a service trainer. Again, all of the staff was very nice, I feel a little guilty giving it only two stars but I have to be honest!"], ["Nour M.", "I come here at least once a week! The owner and his wife are very friendly and always give make me feel welcome. I usually order the chicken shawarma sandwich and it's my favorite. \u00a0I have tried the chicharones de pollo.

I will post up some pictures soon of the food. :)"], ["Haley V.", "Why did I not know that Dominican food existed in Indianapolis? Maybe because it's Indianapolis and I knew better. I was so surprised to see this place, and very excited to try. I had the stewed chicken and chicken empanadas. So delicious! The mangu was also delightful. The service was spectacular, and we talked to our server for several minutes about their bachata and merengue nights on Saturdays. I am looking forward to my next dine!"], ["Ryan K.", "This place gets five stars just for being an authentic place in Indianapolis. I stopped in here while walking home from downtown bc I always saw it and was curious. The staff was so friendly. There was Spanish karaoke going on...an unbelievable vibe! \u00a0The food was amazing: fries plantains and empanadas wow. \u00a0If you're looking for good food and a real cultural meal stop in and grab a beer or quick meal you won't regret it!"], ["Cristina C.", "The first time I went here was for a Spanish meetup on a Friday, March 22nd for Spanish karaoke. First of all, let me say that I have been wanting to do Spanish karaoke for some time, but the only places I've been able to find so far have only Mexican music, which I'm not familiar with so I can't sing. This place had a good mix of baladas, merengue, bachata, salsa, even reggaeton! The husband-wife team that runs the karaoke really know how to get the party started and are wonderful singers. As for the food, they have a Dominican menu and a Mediterranean menu. I haven't seen Dominican food in Indianapolis before, so I was very excited about having a Caribbean Hispanic option for food finally! My boyfriend and I shared the Yaroa, which is french fries with ketchup, mayo, shredded chicken, and cheese. The waitress said it's a new dish that was invented in the DR within the past 5 years or so. We also shared the Stewed Chicken, which was very flavorful. I got it with a small salad and mangu (you pick sides). Mangu is basically boiled green plantains topped with red pickled onions. I was curious about how to make it and the waitress actually told me step by step how to make it! The waitress was extremely friendly, funny, and helpful--such a sweetheart! Honestly I have never had a better waitress in Indianapolis. We tried the moriso\u00f1ando (Spanish for \"to die dreaming\") to drink per the waitress' recommendation and it was basically like a liquid creamsicle. Very good! Also, the interior is very nice. There are chandeliers and pictures from around the world on the walls as well as some Moroccan-looking decorations. All in all, food and service were above and beyond. And the prices can't be beat! We went back a couple of weekends ago when I saw that they have dancing on Saturdays. We really enjoyed the mixture of merengue and bachata since a lot of the Latin dance places in Indy don't play enough merengue for our taste. We ordered some beers and the waiter was helpful and informative this time as well. He told us about a special event (happened last Saturday) for Dominican Mother's Day with a special menu and music, but unfortunately we weren't able to make it. You can't go to this place without having a great time and feeling great! We will definitely be back. They have a Facebook page with current info as well: facebook.com/pages/Panor\u2026"], ["Vanessa E.", "Great Greek dressing. The saffron rice and chawarma chicken were spot on.

It was Barbacoa beef on Tamal corn cakes with pico and a cream sauce drizzled over the top. It also came with a green rice! I was full after one corn cake, but I pushed through and finished my plate!

Definitely doesn't match the look outside but it was a pleasant surprise. The high top tables and swanky looking bar are some highlights. So I decided to start with a cocktail and asked our server for recommendations. She said they had a great margarita so I went for it! It wasn't too sweet, very well balanced. They use orange blossom water in the cocktail as well and the floral note it added was just wonderful. My friend had a cocktail with pisco and cassis.. Can't recall the name, but it was good. They also have a good wine list featuring South American and Spanish wines.For a starter we shared the braised duck sopes and holy flavor explosion. The duck was perfectly seasoned and tender.. They were like little cups of love. Could have eaten a whole other order for sure. They have a good selection for entrees. I was between two and our server pointed us in the right direction. Get the tamal corn cakes.... Just do it. The portion was HUGE, and incredibly rich and tasty. Similar to the duck sopes but made with barbacoa beef instead. And you get a side of the vibrant green herbed rice. I got about halfway through and had to give up.I was so full at this point I didn't think I had it in me for dessert. But then I saw the tres leches cake! Yep, sign me up. The cake itself is a pretty big portion, so I recommend sharing. It was creamy and delicious, topped with what they call \"lime meringue\" but it was so creamy.. Almost like ice cream.. They had to have added something else. It's also topped with a lovely guava compote.Overall, this place is a great value.. They don't skimp on portions and the food is absolutely delicious. Service was fantastic as well! My only issue was.. Where are the wine glasses? I don't want to drink my Priorat from a water cup. ;) Just sayin.."], ["Linda L.", "Went here Friday. Was a little peeved that the hostess will not put you in queue to get a table until your entire party arrives. I understand not seating until everyone arrives, but it seems extreme that you can't get a place in line while waiting.The Service once we got inside was good. The server was diligent. Though if you like things hot, ask for the hot sauce when you order. They serve salsa instead of bottles so it takes a little while. The fish tacos, mojitos, and tres leches cake were delicious though. I don't think this place is great for groups because it's a bit loud. You can't really hear one another."], ["Brooke K.", "I have a firm tradition of ending and beginning a year with a bangin meal. This year we decided to celebrate NYE at Delicia and it did not disappoint. The only reason I am holding back a star is I wish the acoustics in the space could be improved. I loved the vibrant atmosphere, the cozy wooden beams, and high ceilings, but It was very difficult to hear the server and my dinner companion the entire evening. I found myself nodding my head in agreement more frequently then I wanted too, there are only so many times you can say \"what\" and \"huh I am sorry I can't hear you\" before you feel awkward. On the other hand, I may have accidentally shook my head yes in agreement when presented with the Tres Leches sponge cake recommendation. That may have been the best thing I agreed to unknowingly the whole night. Surprise #1: Delicia does not take reservations but for NYE they made an exception.Surprise #2: We made a last minute reservation and got right in, no problem.Surprise #3: We arrived 10 minutes early and were seated right away.Surprise #4: Our bill for a wonderful fancy schmancy meal for 2 was less then $90 w/tip. A Warm Welcome: Every meal begins with a tiny shot of Sancocho, a rich broth flavored with pork and chicken. Cheers! Bebidas - Fire 'N' Ice was the bees knees. It was probably one of most unique cocktails I have sipped on in a while. It had a nice complexity of flavors and was a drink experience like none other. First you taste a sweetness, then a touch of salt, then the drink builds in heat, back to sweet, and finishes off with a habanero punch. Delicious! It won't be a drink for everyone but if your someone who leans more towards spicy/savory rather then sweet you will enjoy this drink. Appetizers - Sopes De Pato, very good. This dish could easily be made into a light meal for someone without a large appetite. The duck was cooked perfectly. Great flavors in this dish. It paired really well with my Fire 'N' Ice cocktail. Entrees - I had the Brazilian Moqueca and my husband had the Enchiladas De Pato. My husband actually used the phrase, and I am writing this down because he is not easy to impress, \"this is probably one of the best meals I have had in Indy in a long time.\" Yep, he said that. My dish came highly recommended by our server. I could have licked the plate. The roasted shrimp melted in my mouth. The garlic pepper sauce was excellent. If you like curry this is very similar. Dessert - Tres Leches, save room for this! It is worth unbuttoning the top notch of your pants for. This cake had me singing Bailamos by Enrique Iglesias. Tres Leches Te quiero, amor m\u00edo, te quiero! The dining area where we sat was lovely. There were cute cozy nooks for groups, I loved the Latin influences in the decor, ample warm light, all these details created a nice inviting space. Service was attentive. We will be back! Thank you for a wonderful meal to bring in 2015!"], ["Kristin B.", "One of the best dinners I've ever had!!! The cocktails are impressive, apps are delish, and if no one was around... I would have licked my bowl clean!!!!!!! So going back for brunch soon!!!"], ["Halide T.", "I usually avoid writing reviews about one-time visits but this was pretty incredible for a first time experience!!Great ambiance and open layout, yet the darker lighting provides a bit of an initimate feel to it. I could see myself coming here with friends or with a date. Staff are really helpful with suggestions! I appreciate when a server gives a preference over two options instead of saying \"it's all good\" because in reality, everyone has a favorite they would pick! Having said that, everything we tried was all very tasty, including the cocktails. My friends had the fire and ice cocktail- perfect sweetness with a good amount of spicy kick!!! I had the Peruvian Sunrise cocktail, which was very smooth with a touch of sweetness!!It was nice to see various price points on the menu and the portions were quite good!!! Tamal corn cakes topped with barbacoa definitely rocked my meal! No better way to wrap up a meal than with an amazing tres leches topped with a guava compote and lime meringue!! I don't know when I will be in town again, but this place is definitely on my list for my next visit!!!To summarize everything in one sentence- Delicia was delicious!!"], ["Melissa L.", "Excellent drinks. Loved the fire and ice cocktail. Very spicy and great flavor! The apps were great too. Had the queso dip and shrimp ceviche. We weren't as impressed with our entrees though. I had the scallops with pork belly and my husband had the mahi mahi which was dry. We would probably opt for the tacos next time. Excellent service and will be back!"], ["Kendra S.", "We went there for my birthday this week, and had a great time. The good: the atmosphere is great, service is attentive and friendly, and the menu is diverse. The food was tasty and well thought out. The only negative is that I wish the food had slightly more flavor... But I love BIG flavor, and that's often a remark of mine :) And oh yeah, great drinks!! Probably some of the pricier drinks in Indy, but delicious nonetheless. Will definitely return!"], ["HaleyBeth O.", "The fact that it was surprisingly empty for Sunday brunch had me a bit concerned at first. If this place is any good, it should be packed! Well let me tell you -- this place is excellent and everyone that isn't there on a Sunday for brunch is clearly missing out. I had the breakfast tacos and they were very delicious. I'm gluten free and encountered no problems. I will definitely try to make it back the next time I'm in Indy."], ["Nelli B.", "I recommend the guacamole and braised short rib. The margaritas are great, as well. I love this place, but unfortunately they don't take reservations, making it difficult to accommodate a large party on busy nights."], ["Jenna B.", "This is my favorite restaurant in Indianapolis, hands down. I don't even know where to begin.There's nothing on the menu I haven't tried at this point, and I've never been disappointed. They give you this amazing amuse bouche of some magical soup. It's the same soup your mom would have made you when you were feeling down had she not been a shitty cook with limited interest in loving you with food. Brunch is out of this world. Just get everything and save yourself the anxiety of having to decide. Only down side is that it does get pretty loud when it's busy. It's worth it, though."], ["Amy R.", "Why did I wait so long to come to Delicia? No matter... all I can say is amazing!! Actually, I will say more, but that sums it up! I first sampled one of their noble margaritas. I would say it was average. The other drinks I had were out of this world! Be sure to try the mojito and the sparking bird. The salsa trio was good, especially the pumpkin salsa. I would also recommend the empanadas, delish! To finish up, I had the tres leches, which was to die for!!The service at Delicia was excellent. Our server was very attentive and there were also additional staff that would stop by and check on us. The atmosphere was festive although at times a little loud, which may have been because it was a Friday night. I would say that this is more of an adult only restaurant although it isn't restrictive as such. There isn't much on the menu that is extremely kid friendly.Although it took me a while to finally make it to Delicia, I will absolutely make it back to try out more of their menu!! I also plan to check out la mulita, which is owned by the same company and is connected to Delicia."], ["Dylan E.", "Let me preface this by saying that I fully understand that naming a brunch place in SoBro as being the best is no small task, but I think that Delicia may have earned that title from me.While there is no lack of amazing choices in the immediate area to get great breakfast and brunch options ranging from fresh and healthy to savory and filling, Delicia provides an offering that gives the typical brunch menu a whole new face. The Latin influence in their food is very pronounced, and I left here with a long list of must-try items for my next visit.First of all, the place itself is a really nice setting. I would label it as an upscale atmosphere, and the service matched that. While it is nicer than a typical brunch place, it isn't at all stuffy and a place you couldn't bring a group to enjoy a breakfast while recapping the weekend, as we certainly did. They have plenty of parking either in front of their building or in their lot behind it, which is really nice when you don't have to find a street spot on College. \u00a0If you need a morning cocktail to either fight off the lingering effects from the night before, or just want to have a drink with breakfast to start the day off on the right foot, they offer some of the best options in the city for cocktails in the morning. That being said, they also come at a price of around $10 a pop, so they are more on par with something I would rather splurge on in the evening with dinner. If cocktails aren't your thing, they have a small but decent draft selection, although these are all a dollar or two overpriced. The menu was tough to narrow down to just one item, but I settled on and will highly recommend the biscuits and gravy. I know, you are thinking that sounds like a boring selection for a Latin fusion type place, but you didn't let me finish. They are delicious and crumbly cornmeal biscuits that have more of a texture to them than typical flour biscuits, and they were perfect when paired with the chorizo-thyme gravy that they were smothered in. The gravy not only tasted amazing, but it had a nice little kick of heat that definitely grew more noticeable the more bites I took. I ended up eating all of it, along with some great breakfast potatoes, and I was absolutely stuffed. I think I would have been better taking half of it home, but it really was just too good to stop eating. While I kind of complained earlier of high prices for drinks, the food was surprisingly affordable, at about $10 a plate for just about all of their brunch offerings. My only real complaint is for them to do something about the website, as it is horribly difficult to navigate when the top and bottom banners take up 60% of the screen and it only leaves us with a couple inches to read everything else on the actual page. Not sure how that one slipped by them or their IT person, but it's horrible.I'm definitely looking forward to my next visit for brunch, and now need to make it here for a dinner sometime in the near future."], ["Tisha N.", "This is our first brunch experience here. \u00a0We have had wonderful dinners in the past. \u00a0The server recommended the Dominican Breakfast, it was great. \u00a0The plantains and fried cheese go together perfectly. \u00a0The sausage was delicious. \u00a0 We also ordered the ceviche to split.The cornmeal biscuits and chorizo gravy were spot on. \u00a0Sweetness from the cornmeal compliments the chorizo. \u00a0Service was great as well."], ["Alicia C.", "Although it took me forever to try this place, I finally did, and it lived up to all the hype. Yes, parking can be a pain, it's Broadripple after all, but just plan on parking in one of the neighboring side streets and you will be fine. My friend and I visited on a weekday around 7pm and had no problem finding a table. The inside of the restaurant is a intimate setting, but the decor makes you feel like you could be in NYC or LA with its trendy urban decor and its sleek bar. We stared off with the popular Fire 'N' Ice concoction which was interesting to say the least. It isn't too spicy unless you allow the ice ball to melt and release the hidden chili seeds inside. I found it to be a strange cross between a spicy margarita and a bloody mary. We paired the Fire N Ice with the Queso Fundido to add additional spice to our bellies, a perfect combination.For the main course, I ended up trying the Sparkling Bird drink, which is DELICIOUS, along with the Empanadas. The empanadas were a good mix of cheese, beef and creamy habenero sauce, the green rice that accompanied it was slightly bland though. Unfortunately, I was too full to order dessert, but believe me, I will be back to try their Tres Leche cake, it looked divine!In all, \u00a0this is a perfect restaurant for date night, friend night, or I need a drink night. There are lots of interesting dishes and drinks to try and a beautiful setting to enjoy them in."], ["Phi C.", "Wow!! This place is amazing!! I first heard about this restaurant at a yell event and had a taste of their guacamole! Had to then yelp them and check them out. Everything posted on their page looked amazing. Walked into this place about 15 mins prior to the kitchen closing, we had no idea. Saw that they were open until 11, however, the waiter was very kind and informed us we had until 10 to order. \u00a0Service was particular! For appetizer I tried their ceviche with fish shrimp and octopus. That dish was delicious! Lots of flavor and \u00a0the chips were a perfect vessel. I ordered the Brazilian Moqueca for my entree and every bite of this dish was amazing. It's a shrimp dish that was covered in a coconut curry kind of sauce with a scoop of rice. This dish is definitely a must have! I am sure I will have it again. My friend ordered the fish tacos and of course I had a bite. The fish was lightly under salted, but overall, the dish was fantastic! I love this place. Restaurant is gorgeous, ambience was so elegant and chilled. Service was perfect and food was amazing!!!"], ["Pebbles R.", "Decor is awesome. Service was impeccable. It was Mexican cuisine with a French twist. I recommend give \u00a0this quaint and trendy spot a try..."], ["Meaghan S.", "I had high hopes for this place. My boyfriend and I ate here getting pork tacos and beef empanadas, both with green herb rice and then churros. We got a margarita and sangria. My margarita was oddly salty, as if someone accidentally got salt in the drink in addition to putting it on the rim of the glass. The food tasted good, save for the rice which was a tad weird. Maybe a half hour after leaving both my boyfriend and I had horrible stomach pains. We definitely each had a mild case of food poisoning. Lasted a couple days. To top it off I couldn't hear anything the waiter was saying, it was way too noisy. It was weird to see people exiting from the back of the building, and parking was tight."], ["Stacy P.", "3.5 starsIf you happen to find yourself in the SoBro area and you are looking for some Gluten Free fare, Delicia is a great option. While there is no dedicated GF menu, a majority of the items are either GF as is or might need a small modification to be GF. Sadly, the sweet plantains contain flour and are oddly a no go. One thing to keep in mind about Delicia is that they are a scratch kitchen, so the food does take a little bit longer to make. ServiceThe servers are generally friendly and helpful when walking through the menu. They do a good job of answering my questions/concerns and verified with the kitchen if they were unsure.FoodThe food isn't bad and the menu consists of a nice selection of items.I feel like some of the items are hit and miss, case in point the short ribs. The description and my expectations didn't seem to match, but hey, there are plenty of other options to chose from.BebidasThe prices are in line with what other restaurants are charging for cocktails. While this may seem high, trust me, it could be worse. In some cities it is almost impossible to find a cocktail under $15. The options are pretty decent. While everyone raves about the Fire 'N' Ice, I wasn't exactly a fan. It might have been the hibiscus, but the after taste seemed a little off. If nothing else, it is a really strong drink. The margarita's and mojitos are really good if your looking for something sweet and strong.BarI love the bar seating. If you are looking to have drinks and appetizer, this is the way to go.ParkingThis can be a hassle. While there is a small lot in the front, \u00a0as well as a few spots in the back, it isn't enough for the number diners. Plus, it is shared with La Mulita. Your best option is finding a spot along College. NoiseDelicia's industrial design plays a huge factor in this. The high ceilings tends to amplify the noise and it can get extremely loud. I find the best time to go is either later in the evenings, ~8:30 pm, \u00a0or when they first open.ReservationsLove it or hate it, they don't accept reservations"], ["Lara P.", "When it comes to Indianapolis dining, Delicia is elite. This is a 5 star restaurant and it's so great it almost makes me feel I've been too generous with other 5 star ratings I've given out. I've been here a handful of times and each visit is as excellent as the one before. The food is flavorful and portions are generous- try the enchiladas de pato or the tamal corn cakes. Save room for churros! Servers are always professional and helpful, offering useful suggestions about cocktails and food. The dining room is dimly lit and trendy with exposed beams, wall tapestries, and fun booth seating with patterned throw pillows. The congruence of flavors & atmosphere is perfect.

Case in point - duck enchiladas.Upon walking in, John and I were greeted by the host and asked how many were in our party. Our 2 guests had not arrived yet and so we were very clearly told that it was their policy to not seat guests until all of the party arrived. Fine by me. We went to the bar to wait. However, we saw two people being seated behind us with four menus on the table. I thought it was against their policy to do that? It definitely put me off. If they were special guests, I guess I understand, but why would you be so up front to tell us about this policy if the policy doesn't apply to everyone?Anyway.Everything else was superb. The queso fund I do was the beat queso I've ever had. Johns pork tacos were great but a little fatty. My duck enchiladas were dream-worthy. Drinks, such as my Palmino, were fantastic.

We started off with guacamole; the freshness of the avocados and lime is what makes this worth the extra chips.(Fresh Made)My wife had the De Palmitos salad, sharing some of the kids chicken tacos. The salad was light and not overly dressed. It was a nice combination of different vegetables. The chicken used in the tacos was flavorful and not dried out. I had the duck enchiladas! Get this, its that good! Duck in enchiladas is a combination that I didn't think of prior to this(especially in Indiana). Everything about this dish was great. The flavor \u00a0of the duck and the nice pairing with the herbed rice and black beans. For drinks the margarita is great and you can't go wrong when they use fresh lime and not the pre mixed stuff. The Fire n Ice cocktail was a wonderful surprise. The heat of the drink doesn't start off strong but builds delightfully as the ice sphere melts into the drink.

The last time we were there, I tried a Blood Mary that had a splash of stout (Scarlet Lane Dorian Stout) in it--great combination that I would never have thought would work."], ["Ali O.", "I've been on several occasions, each just as lovely as the next. Terrific atmosphere (gorgeous bar area!) and service. Cocktails are pricey (e.g., the Noble margarita is $13) but a worthwhile indulgence; I'm particularly fond of the pisco sour and fire and ice (beware of the heat!). If you're seeking big ol' \"American\" portions, this is unlikely to be the dining destination for you. The starters and salads serve as tasty teasers en route to the main course. As a vegetarian who does not eat seafood, I typically order the enchiladas de verduras and happily tote the leftovers home. My dining partners always rave about their meaty meals. Go and be sure to save room for the wonderful desserts!! Dinner for two (one round of drinks, a starter, two entrees, & dessert) will easily run $100 with tip. If you desire these flavors without the price, I recommend that you visit La Mulita, the casual place next door with which Delicia shares a kitchen.

I loved the guacamole and will order that again.My corn cakes arrived and they look like a work of art. I don't know how I did it but I ate both of them. I may be tiny but a girl can eat and I just couldn't imagine taking these home. I was stuffed! I didn't leave any room for dessert even though I was eying the churros and chocolate. I would recommend getting their early. We did at 5:30 and it seemed like after that, it got busy quickly and they do not accept reservations. Don't let that factor into your next visit though.

I'm not from Indy, and consulted my best friend, in situations like this (Yelp). I liked the look of the menu, so I went to Delicia's on Saturday when it was snowing hard. I arrived at 5pm, and was able to get a table with no problem. By the end of my meal, at 6pm, the restaurant was busy even with the snow falling outside. The restaurant was a nice place, not too fancy, but not too casual either. It was just right for friends, groups, or dates. People looking for a bit nicer dining experience can eat here without breaking the bank. Yelp classified it as Mexican, but it's not your usual Mexican. It's upscale, and there's no complimentary bowls of chips and salsa. I had the house salad to start with, which was bigger than your usual house salad, and the ingredients were fresh. There wasn't any crunch to it and the orange tamarind dressing wasn't very overpowering. For the main meal, I was undecided between the CHILE EN NOGADA (roasted poblano pepper, ground pork, beef, apricots, cinnamon, raisins, walnuts, goat cheese salsa, herb green rice) and the ANCHO PEACH PORK. The server recommended the Chile en Nogada. I fell in love with this dish. It was mindblowing! It was sweet and savory, and not spicy when you blend everything together. I would strongly recommend this dish if you have a sweet tooth. I was so full after dinner, the portion was huge, but I had to have dessert. Picking the dessert was another difficult decision, and again, I enlisted my server's help. I hadn't had churros in months, and was craving them, but the tres leches looked special with guava compote and lime meringue. The server said it was a difficult decision, but she would say the tres leches. Again, she didn't let me down, the tres leches was one of the best I've ever had. The lime meringue had the texture of hard whipped cream, which accompanied the cake really nicely. The cake was very moist. I forgot that I was full after one bite. I finished it with ease.I also had one drink, the fire and ice. It had jalapeno infused vodka, and it was spicy but with a hint of sweetness and I loved it.

Their Mojito is the best I've had in Indy - crisp and refreshing...oh so yummy. Their jalapeno drink was spicy and awesome -- I loved the large ice cube filled with jalapenos. This place is gorgeous and offers a lot of seating. Our waiter was splendid -- 5 stars for his service. The food on the other hand wasn't my fave -- we tried their queso and pork tacos and I love a yellow cheesy queso so I was surprised when our dish arrived looking more like a salsa dish. I will say my gal pals duck tacos were delicious -- perfectly flavored. \u00a0They open at 4p so head here for a fantastic HH & try their mojito!"], ["Brad F.", "Amazing... \u00a0 Really tasty food at surprisingly decent prices. \u00a0 Layered flavors and a good amount of it."], ["Angela M.", "Absolutely amazing.Started with the salsa trio which was okay..

I had the corn cakes. Amazazing!! Loved every amazing flavor.Kids had the scallops and they were absolutely in love with the big bold flavors. They said it was like an explosion of flavor in their mouths. 4 year old had a kids meal and it was a good portion size. He ate everything and seemed to enjoy it. Amazing place! Expensive...

This place wins at all superlatives!Food: 4/5 - I would give it a 5 but it lacked the punch of hot spiciness that Latin food is famous for.Service: 4/5Location: 4/5 - That bar is so sexy, and did I mention how delicious the capirinahs and all the tequila cocktails are?

The ceviche includes octopus. \u00a0For dinner we had the corn tamal and veggie enchiladas. \u00a0Both were excellent.

We started with chips and guac. The guacamole was very fresh, and had a bit of a kick to it thanks to the jalapeno slices. The chips had a lime salt on them, similar to Chipotle. For dinner I got the tamal corn cakes, which were very good. The barbacoa had a great flavor to it and was cooked well. The rice on the side was decent, but nothing to really write home about. I would have liked to have some ice with my water. They give you a bottle of water at your table, but no ice in your glass. I'm sure I could have asked for a glass of ice, however I did not. Anyway, we shared the tres leches for dessert, and that was outstanding! Neither of us had a drink, so I can't speak on the margaritas or other drinks. I would like to come back and try some of their drinks, however they are pretty pricey ($8 and up). Overall good, but just shy of 5 stars to me."], ["Samantha O.", "Absolutely wonderful. Reminds us of our favorite local restaurants in San Juan. Food, service, and atmosphere are excellent. I highly recommend the chef's special, it's never failed to please yet."], ["Kimmi M.", "I think this is a great place for people who want \"kind of Latin food.\" It's overpriced. It's pretentious. It's like that girl you met in college from the suburbs."], ["Brittany L.", "I LOVE the interior decor and that they have a decent-sized parking lot (it was raining when we went so we were grateful to not have to hop over puddles for 2 blocks to get to the restaurant). I like the different levels and types of seating available and how the dining room is broken up that way. I felt like I was in the southwest, but \"classy 2013 southwest\" not \"neon green and pink lizards and smiling suns 1985 southwest\". I LOVE the food. It isn't too often that I go to a restaurant and think \"Holy crap! Everything sounds so delicious I can't even decide!\" And then when I order, everything not only lives up to my expectations but exceeds them. The service was GREAT. Seriously. Really attentive, very knowledgeable about drinks and food, respected dietary requests and were cool about the \"no latex\" thing. They do use latex gloves there but were happy to take them off at my request. We had queso fundido to start and it was awesome. It's more like a chili dip than a cheese dip but it's so delicious and smoky. We had to box it up so we wouldn't just end up eating that for our entire meal. I had a mojito and he had some spicy thing with peppers in the ice sphere. Both very tasty. For dinner he had carnitas tacos (which may have been made with pork belly!) and I had beef empanadas. The green rice is super delicious...I'm going to start making it myself. The black beans had great depth of flavor. The empanadas were of the puff pastry variety, very light and flaky, and the beef was so tender...like pot roast...and full of flavor. Our leftovers were packed into recyclable foil tins rather than styrofoam, which also made them easier to reheat the following day in the oven. Can't wait to go back and try the flan! The white exterior is odd, but it's come a long way since it was that crappy video rental place. I don't like the typeface they chose for their sign, but it does definitely set it apart from the surrounding homes and businesses."], ["Leslie H.", "Delicia definitely, without a doubt, deserves a 5 out of 5. It's a Nuevo Latino cuisine which basically means a little bit of above/everything since it has some Cuban, Mexican, Argentine, Peruvian, etc flair to the dishes. The ambiance was inviting. It reminds me of restaurants that I will go to in LA. Dark mood lighting, exposed wood beams, huge bar, Latin music playing...whoever designed the place deserves a pat in the back. The food was amazing. We ordered tostones con longaniza and empanadas as appetizers, beef with chimichurri and paella for the main entree. Then for dessert, we settled on a flan. They were all delicious.We'll definitely go back to this place. Sunday supper is the perfect time since there's no wait time."], ["Michelle Q.", "Stopped to meet a friend for dinner and we sat at the bar. It was crowded even early on a weekday night. We spent a few hours at the bar and normally I wouldn't rave about the service because I recognize bar seating isn't same as table service. However, our bartender was amazing. The food was the star but the drinks certainly delivered a top shelf experience of their own. Each dish is unique and deserving of expert explanation. Which our bartender excelled at!The suggestions were spot on and his attention to what items we preferred was rewarded with dishes that delivered all that was promised. Fresh, flavorful, unique. Margaritas and guacamole were divine. I highly recommend the salsa trio for a starter. Spicy beet salad and fish tacos were also excellent. Huge portions even splitting items. Definitely enough leftover for meal the next day."], ["Annissa M.", "Craft cocktails for your eyes and your belly. The fish tacos were delicious.

Menu is good but very limited. Very cute date spot. Food lacked bold flavors, I rarely use salt. I wanted salt and more heat. I wasn't overly impressed by anything. For the Midwest it is great. As a west coast person it was just ok. Culver City appeal minus the flavors."], ["Alex W.", "I thought it was only proper to try Delicia without the Yelpers, without the tequila shots. A new friend and I both love foods of the Hispanic kind, so getting her to agree to this new place was easy! I will admit, on a busy evening, parking is a b#@&*. Good luck trying to find a spot in their area, or maneuvering in the alleyway to the back \"lot\". Once you find a spot, you'll want to make sure your entire party is present, otherwise you cannot be seated. Fair is fair in that case. I was still giddy from the Yelp Swizzle Stick Party so I made sure our waiter Oscar knew I'd been there, hopefully that info didn't scare him! The \"welcome soup\" was UH-mazing. The guac was UHHH-MAZING. Our dinners [Empanadas & Tamal Corn Cakes] were FABULOUS. Margarita made me feel like I was back in Key West on the beach.

Recommended by Israel, our waiter. Very, very good, my accomplice enjoyed as well although she is luke warm towards squid dishes in general.We ordered an additional cocktail, this time trying the Margarita and finding it pretty pedestrian and disappointing. We ordered the \u00a0BRAZILIAN MOQUECA as the main course only because it was her special day. I wanted the ceviche which Isreal also recommended. I silently acquiesced and licked her ear. It was good, Pretty standard coconut type shrimp with accompanying vegetable and rice medley. She thought the shrimp was very good due in part to her 2nd Fire and Ice. We were brought a complimentary birthday dessert, The Tres Leches. I do recall seeing my dates eyes roll into the back of her head into a blissful state of Lecheness.It was a great end to a very good meal. Our bill came in at $95 with tip. The service was fantastic, Thanks Isreal, the ambience, low lighting and music added to a great night with my best friend."]], "Taste Cafe & Marketplace": [["Dennis L.", "Taste seems to be a staple in the heart of Broad Ripple so when I had an opportunity to come back to Indianapolis, this was a fantastic treat. You order at the counter and they'll bring food to your table - somewhat unique for a breakfast joint. Water and utensils are self service. Service is SLOW during the breakfast/brunch rush on weekends - it took nearly 50 minutes to get the first plate out to our table.Portion sizes are excessively large and most certainly represents two meals for most normal humans (not me). The fries with basil aioli are worth killing for and you get a huge portion to share with a group. I tried to order their omelet daily special but the cashier actually recommended a cheaper omelet sandwich with the same ingredients - so I obviously obliged. Ultimately I think it was a good choice although I really had no idea what the menu item was called. Like the fries, the portion size was ridiculous. The sandwich itself was deliciously messy and perfect for an early Saturday morning.4-stars because service was just so incredibly slow and unorganized at times. Our table was served in three waves separated about 5 minutes each so there's that awkwardness where some people refuse to eat until everyone has their food. The food though, was superb."], ["Brian M.", "I \u00a0wish I were more hungry so I could try more. But I had the Greek orzo salad - a cold pasta side salad. I enjoyed it. My wife had the BALT ( a BLT with Avocado ), friets, and a coffee cheese cake for dessert. (Again, I wish I were hungry!). Ok - I stole some (half) of her friets - they were excellent. Everything rated awesome! \u00a0I also had an Irish coffee - Yum!My wife and I stopped in at Taste on our Sunday 'day date'. We arrived at 12:25. There was a line - didn't look to be too long - maybe a ten minuter. It was a 20 minute line due to only one cashier and she was a trainee. You enter, order at the counter and take your number to a table. They bring the food to you. I like the restaurant and the idea of local foods, good foods, real ingredients, etc. I will come here again. A couple things I think could help: 1) the menu is small and difficult to read while in line. A printed menu by the door that could be given back to the cashier would help. 2) Sunday lunch rush may not be the best time to train a cashier - especially if that is the only cashier.Overall - it was great and I am happy this place lives in Indy!"], ["Suzanne W.", "I've always been a fan of Taste and I continue to be a fan of the Pommes Frites, seriously, those are the best.

I love their salads, but please, lets make a half salad version please?? Who eats that size of a salad? I could feed 4 people that salad. What a waste of wonderful ingredients. Their soups recently have been way over seasoned (too salty). Of course, it's hard to not go back for the frites so hopefully I've just been on some bad days lately..."], ["Januarie Y.", "It's been awhile since I had a visit here but I must say, I really like taste. I'm a small cafes like this. This is one of those places that is perfect for an alone brunch. Their waffle is stand alone but topped with enough ripe fruit that the syrup offering is not even necessary. I've ordered the waffle a few times and have yet to be disappointed. It's pretty big with the perfect relationship between crunch and softness. This is also the first place I tried Pommel Frites at and I am a huge fan of them! Their aoili makes a great pairing with the parsley covered snooty french fries. You might find me here soon having a round along with their creme brulee. It is the best! I've held others up to its standard and have all but decoded to only get creme brulee from Taste. They have a nice selection of desserts you can order from along with huge sandwiches that a Rade to please the tongue.I suggest them for girl day out too!! They have booth space and long tables as well as outdoorseating. The infused water is at the customers disposal and the food is made fresh. It can get busy in there, especially on Saturdays so brace yourself for a wait or hold off until after the rush. I give them a 7.5 on the Snooty Scale of 1-10. Those are good numbers. I do think it's time for a trip back!! Enjoy!"], ["Katie U.", "I'm feeling a 3.5 on this one. After reading the Yelp reviews, I was expecting a long line and a 40+ minute wait for food. I got there a little after 11 on a rainy Saturday morning and the line to the counter was only five minutes, and my food came out in under 20 minutes!Parking is difficult..street parking is limited, and the parking lot out back has double parking. Assuming the staff parks in the front row? Nonetheless, if your car gets trapped you gotta walk around the restaurant asking people \"is this your car? can you move it?\". Womp womp.It's like an upscale, eclectic McAlister's. Order at a counter, where lots of yummy baked goods face you. You get a number and wait for your food to be delivered to your table.I got the three egg farm fresh omelet with spinach and mushrooms, and it came with home fries and a cheddar biscuit (note to self: home fries are not actual french/steak fries). I thought the cheddar biscuit would be a la biscuits and gravy with melted cheddar on top, but alas, it was simply a cheddar biscuit.The home fries were SO good but my plate came with a mountain of them...like half the plate. I'm trying to eat healthy here, Taste. They had yummy seasoning but were kinda salty & rich so I couldn't eat them all.The omelet was alright...light and fluffy, but it just had plain spinach and mushrooms inside (you could only choose two). It didn't really have much flavor, just a plain omelet. Choose your ingredients wisely, because I swear there was a whole garden of spinach in my omelet.Also the serve yourself water/coffee/tea bar is bizarre and kinda in the line of traffic, but hey, it works and they're always refilling so no problems there.Side note, the restrooms are hard to find and not marked well. For a counter-order restaurant it's a little pricey but overall it was good and I got a HUGE plate of food so worth my $$.

I'm something of an amateur baker myself, and I can say with confidence that once you reduce shortening, not drying out your cake becomes difficult. \u00a0 So they've done an impressively good job here. \u00a0 Oh, and the waitresses and patrons are still incredibly hot."], ["Chad H.", "I've given this place a couple chances, and I'm not impressed. Especially on my most recent visit. First things first. Parking is on the street or crammed in this makeshift \"parking lot\" behind the building. This place is tiny (and ugly). The tables are jam-packed together and everyone is tripping over everyone when this place gets busy. This seems to really stress the \"servers\" out. I use the term loosely because you order at a counter (which is already strike one for me), and then \"servers\" bring you your food (maybe.. if you hunt them down and remind them that you only ordered a breakfast sandwich and its literally been over 45 minutes).Ok, so on to the actual dining experience. So you make your way up to a counter and stare at big menu, including an entire section of hand written entrees. For some reason the hand written menu does not offer prices, which my brother ordered two entrees from this menu (one for himself and one for my mother) and some hot tea and the price was something crazy like $50.00 Granted he could have asked the price of the entrees but who expects two breakfast entrees and some tea to add up to $50.00 (and these aren't huge meals or super high quality food. Its bland, regular, breakfast food). Nothing special except the price.I ordered a breakfast sandwich, which is not an entree. Its literally like this gross ball of scrambled eggs between two pieces of bread with some kind of sauce on it or something. I also ordered a mimosa. I received my mimosa as soon as I sat down, which was nice. [[They're 7 dollars I think, and not really worth it. [Northside Social Kitchenette's drinks at brunch are a much better value.] But anyway, I ordered a second mimosa after waiting and waiting. Until it had been a little over 45 minutes. At that point we hunted someone down to ask about our food. (I feel like things were out of order. The staff was short tempered, but trying poorly to pretend to be nice. I do not know for sure, but I believe people who came in after us were served first)Finally the food. The food that we've been waiting almost an hour for! It's going to be wonderful and so worth the wait, right? I guess if you're amazed by bland scrambled eggs and a slice of bread. I've had breakfast and lunch at Taste, breakfast.. save yourself the time, money and claustrophobia and scramble yourself some eggs (it will more than likely be just as good, if not better). Lunch was better than breakfast but still left a lot to be desired. I think I've had my last taste of Taste Cafe."], ["Ntianu S.", "This place is another SoBro gem I've been raving about for years. I've been here so many times for lunch or breakfast I've lost count. Today I stopped in for lunch because I was in the mood for the roasted turkey and smoked bacon sandwich that I absolutely adore. A generous portion of roasted turkey, smoke bacon, tomatoes, thousand island dressing, and spring mix on top of a baguette. Mmmmm, delicious! The pommes frites with a side of aioli are quite enjoyable. They are served fresh and topped with herbs that adds a nice touch. Today I was feeling a bit adventurous and ordered an Irish Coffee. It was just ok. Not nearly as flavorful as I anticipated. The price tag for my meal was $21. A bit pricey but sans the Irish coffee it was completely worth every cent.I rated this place down a star because the service is inconsistent. It's not terrible at all, which is why I keep coming back. Sometimes the staff is nice and personable while others look as if they don't want to be there. The wait time for food can also be uber sloooowwww. On Saturdays they are insanely packed so be prepared to wait. Oh how could I forget to tell you about their desserts. Can you say heavenly?!

Thankfully, wife and I are not in a hurry, so we may not be as frustrated as the other Sunday 1pm lunch crowd. Nevertheless, 1.5 hours from walking in to seeing the first sight of our sandwich is disappointing. I like that the food quality (ingredient) was good, but Taste - please solve the kitchen bottleneck problem. A few ideas: 1) Set the expectation at the back of line, letting potential customers know it'll take x mins. 2) Reduce the number of offerings you have.

They had a list of cocktails that were reasonably priced and wine by the quartino or by the bottle as well. I went for their Moscow Mule, which was absolutely fantastic. As a note, their entrees do not come with sides, so if you want one, order it separately. However, their portions are really big for both their entrees and sides. I ordered a side of sweet potato frites because I didn't think the chorizo I ordered was going to be enough, but boy way I wrong! I decided to have the fries as an appetizer and they were quite hearty, coming with an aioli sauce. Afterwards, my chorizo came-- in the form of a salad. I looked at it quizzically for a few seconds, and then I saw the two sausages sticking out of the bottom of the salad that they piled on top. I'm not a salad person (this is why I'm terrible at dieting), but I was amazed by what they offered me. Along with the leafy greens were bits of corn shucked straight off the cob and avocado. Yum!I knocked down a star because they need to update their bathroom. They've decorated their dining room in hues of bronze and brown, but the bathroom is the muted colbalt blue that the previous tenant had. The toilet seat had been worn away by lord knows what, and there was mildew surrounding the seat. Honestly, this was the only part that was bad about my dinner. I'd suggest that you go at home before coming and hold it in until you go home.Also, I did have some friends who ordered martinis who didn't like the olives that were put in them. They said they tasted like they came from a very old jar, and even expressed their discern for it to the waiter.All in all, definite must visit if you're in Sobro."], ["Emma V.", "Amazing fries and desserts.

Months after they visit, they'll still remember reveling over the pomme frites (fries), the deserts, and well...everything! Taste Cafe excels at making each dish special and above par. A salad is not just a salad, and a sandwich is not just a sandwich - Taste turns them into culinary art that will fire up your inner foodie and make you wonder why you bother to brunch anywhere else.I expected my chorizo salad to have bits of chorizo sprinkled throughout it for flavor, but oh no - my salad came with an entire chorizo sausage link placed on top of delicious greens. Win! The pomme frites? They aren't casually piled on a plate, but they come in a large stand up basket with the best dipping sauce in town. My favorite fries are the sweet potato fries with the sweet butter! The sandwiches? They don't just add a slice of lettuce for decoration, they put on a chunk of lettuce, flavored throughout with a dressing that complements the meat topping.

All were ok, but the slow service distracted us from having a positive experience.

Everything I've ever tried has been fantastic - the waffles, biscuits and gravy, breakfast sandwiches, salads, sweet teas, the BALT, the list could go on and on.

If you've ever dreamed of having a fruit covered waffle and salty frites in the same meal, this place is for you.Sometimes the service is inconsistent and not overly friendly in my opinion, but thats a small price to pay for the delicious food.

I had the Erin, one of the featured sandwiches, and a couple vanilla meringues for a totally-worth-it 50 cents a piece from a quaint little dish next to the register. The food selection is excellent for the more health-conscious consumer, and everything I tried (both what I ordered, and bites of my dining companion's things while he wasn't looking) was excellent. Something should also be said about the staff's resolve, because we came in about 40 minutes before close, and they were all very friendly and attentive despite us interrupting their closing prep.

Everything on your plate seems like it was done thoughtfully, but without being pretentious. The food itself was decent. I can't honestly say I was blown away by the way it tasted... but it was fresh, honest, and memorable - which is always worth a trip for me. (Plus, it's super vegetarian friendly!)The menu inside the cafe is moderately overwhelming... I had a really had time deciphering what was on their \"specials\" menu and ended up just asking the staff what to order. I ended up with The Erin - a vegetarian sandwich. It used fresh vegetables, a good amount of cheese, and a great baguette, so it was good. But I probably wouldn't order it again - there was way too much aioli and I felt like I could probably make a similar sandwich with more flavor.All that aside, there were so many interesting options on the menu and I had such a lovely overall experience, I'll definitely be coming back."], ["Trena R.", "I like about every food option set before me, so walking in and seeing an amazing-looking menu board of soooo many yummy choices.

We sat outside and enjoyed the sunshine. The tables filled up, but it never felt packed or without privacy. The food was served up quickly and was served with just the right amount of conversation. My dining partner knows the owners and was able to share part of their story - how they planned to hang in Indy for a year on their way to foodier markets, but fell in love with the community and put down roots (no pun intended) to bring their fresh feasts to hungry Hoosiers. I love the story. I love the food. In fact, we now have a standing date... now, to start thinking about what to order next."], ["Brandi N.", "This was my first time here. The cashier suggested the bacon chop (which for the record has no bacon). After a 45 min wait for our food, I was served a massive pork chop covered in sausage gravy with an egg over easy and potatoes. This sounds amazing and I guess it would be if the food had any type of flavor to it. I also didn't really having to try and navigate a rather large menu over the counter and with no prices. To have no servers and over the counter service, I think this place is a tad overpriced. Great food can always make up for slow service and high prices but for me it just wasn't there."], ["Elizabeth P.", "Moving back to Broad Ripple was exciting for so many different reasons, and about 75% of those reasons were the restaurant scene.

The line was to the door and people were still coming. Now, granted this was the first really nice day in a while, but I get the feeling that this is a regular occurrence, and after I got my meal, I totally understood why.We went for some frites basil aoli as a starter and as a french fry lover, I will stand by these babies as the best I've ever had :)For our main dish, we shared the waffle special and the Biscuits and Gravy Special. They were \u00a0both delicious, the fruit on the waffle was so great, not soggy in the least and just pure crunchy goodness.

Bottomless coffee is always a plus as well! Great place for brunch with friends."], ["Tracy M.", "Stopped in at Taste today, our first visit, for brunch with my husband, daughter and her friend. The food was delicious, however the service was horrendous to say the least. We went through the line and place our orders 3 sandwiches, 1 Pom frites, 1 salad and 1 oatmeal. Pretty simple items if you ask me right? The Pom frites came out very quickly however it took 45 minutes for us to receive the rest of our orders. Here's where the horrendous part comes in, my husband goes up to the counter after waiting 30 mins and asks how much longer it will be and he is told by the order taker that since we had such a \"large order\" that they had to put other people ahead of us!!! SERIOUSLY! Then my husband had ordered the B.E.L.T sandwich which came with fruit. He explained to the man that took our order that he was highly allergic to all types of melon and the man assured him that none of the fruit was premixed and that they would make his fruit with just strawberries and bananas. When the sandwich comes out there are 2 huge chunks of watermelon laying against the sandwich. We told the server again that he was allergic to melon and she apologized and said they would remake his order. They bring out the 2nd sandwich with a cup of fruit on the plate and guess what it has cantaloupe and watermelon in it. Correct me if I am wrong but doesn't that come from the melon family!! We send the bowl back and again specifically ask for JUST strawberries and bananas. They finally get it right the 3rd time around. While all of this fruit issue is going on I am still awaiting my Salmon salad to no avail. I finally ask the server show her my receipt and she says \"hmmm well you did order that, can I take your receipt back and show the kitchen\"!! \u00a0Finally they bring my salad out. While the food and coffee are delicious def 4-5 stars, you may want to rethink visiting here if you have more than 2 people in your party and definitely make sure NO ONE has any food allergies!!"], ["Danielle S.", "Very relaxing atmosphere. You order food at the counter, take the number tag and seat yourself wait for your food. I tried the salad, waffle and a sandwich with truffle oil. Based on my food, I'd say it's safe to order whichever food here. It can't be too bad. I'll give a 4-5 star to their food. This is a good place for Sunday brunch."], ["Corey L.", "I just don't get the hype that surrounds Taste. I went for Sunday brunch for the second time and both times have left feeling disappointed. We got there at 12:30pm and luckily did not have to wait in line. What bothers me the most about their menu and ordering at the counter is that a huge part of their menu are their daily specials, none of which have listed prices. I ordered the egg special which included over-easy eggs, seasonal vegetables, and gravy over biscuits and hash browns. I'm not a huge fan of runny eggs so I asked the cashier if the egg type can be changed (it cannot be on specials). But I was shocked when paying to find out the egg special alone was over $16! Add coffee and the expected tip and you are paying a pretty penny for a large plate of greasy, average brunch food. I've never seen a small plate of food come out here, but I still don't think that justifies the high prices for an \"order at the counter,\" neighborhood brunch spot. I can't speak to their dinner but probably won't be attempting brunch again anytime soon."], ["Sikandar K.", "Had the crispy tilapia tacos and the breaded chicken with bacon. Appetizer was hummus and pita. We sat outside which was lovely. The service was fine but it took a really long time to get our order in. Then it took over 30 mins to get the appetizer. Presentation was really good. The chicken was dry. Food tasted okay but nothing special. Service during the meal wasn't very attentive and it was likely because there were too few wait staff."], ["Daniel W.", "Update after Taste's response. Edit- thanks for the response to my previous review, Taste...I guess? Again...I'd have to say after several unanswered emails, no interest in actually helping me beyond placating words, you did less than the minimum here...you were emailed, given proof of the incident, and you did nothing until this was posted. Your food harmed me. It cost me loss of time, money, and missed work, not to mention an extraordinary amount of pain. It became clear that I'd have to become litigious (read: take you to court) for you to do anything regarding the damage your food did and I'm just not going to do that. I contacted you multiple times. You had ample opportunity to help me. You chose not to do anything. I shouldn't have to take you to small claims court for you to do the right thing for causing me injury. If you believe ignoring several polite emails and offering no compensation for a medical problem you caused me is the way to go, that's on your head. Enjoy whatever karma it brings you. You don't care or very simply you'd have done the right thing by responding to emails \u00a0and working with me when you were first presented with the problem. \u00a0I'm reasonable, as clearly I didn't even bother to go after you as I could have, but it's only fair I have an outlet as until this was posted you wouldn't even engage me. Very simply...if you care...I'll modify an old saying...put your money where my mouth is. I don't need lip service. Enough play on words? Words are just words until they become an action. Your only action was inaction. I do not appreciate being stuck with a $1000+ dental bill due to your lack of caution in the kitchen. I appreciate even less the lack of concern or communication you displayed throughout my multiple attempts to contact you. It's evident what part of the transaction concerns you most, and you've gotten that from me until I was hurt by you...and even a couple times after. I'm sorry though...after your \"response\" feigning concern/care on my last review...I won't be back."], ["Chelsea K.", "I was surprised by how good the food was. We went on a Saturday and I got the breakfast sandwich because breakfast is served all day on the weekends. It was very good and quite large. All of my other friends were very satisfied with their meals.The lunch menu is mostly salads and sandwiches which isn't that appealing to me. However, they have a lot of daily specials. The main draw back to this place is the ordering process. You wait in line to order and the menu is right up at the counter. It's a very large menu with many daily specials. It can go quite slow if you get there in a rush and everybody needs to read over the menu. There also isn't much seating for parties over 4. We were a party of 6 and initially were going to squeeze in at a table, but then a larger area opened up.Servers were friendly. However it seemed that the person taking orders had messed something up right before we got to the counter and the manager reprimanded him right in front of us. That was a little awkward and unprofessional.Overall it was a good experience and I will definitely go back."], ["Tom B.", "Yeah - this is one of those hyped-up places where the food is truly great, but you have to go through a lot just to get it.

We spent about 30 minutes in line until we finally advanced far enough to place our order. \u00a0After ordering, it took another 25 minutes for our food to arrive, so about an hour wait in total. The noise level inside was off the charts, between the crowd and the music blaring over the ceiling speakers. Had to clean off our own table since no one was cleaning them off for us.

Service was slow but not a big deal...Twas a Saturday afternoon anyway."], ["Laura B.", "After hearing rave reviews about this place and having it on my wish list for a while, we decided to head there on a Saturday for brunch/lunch. If you've never been, I recommend looking at the menu online, as it can be overwhelming walking in, standing in line and having to order from menu boards hanging behind the register counter. I will echo other reviews and recommend that Taste adds prices to the specials on the handwritten board. There were too many specials listed to count and none of them showed a price. Good luck finding a table on a busy day. I was surprised that we were able to find a table fairly quickly, since it seemed busy and the dining area is small. Note that you need to get your own silverware and napkins, along with your own coffee and water.As far as the food goes, everything was very good and the ingredients were very fresh. I got the BALT and pomme frites with basil aioli. My daughter got the deluxe fruit bowl (bananas, grapes, berries, ruby red grapefruit, pomegranate seeds) and granola parfait. My boyfriend got some kind of egg special (can't remember the name but it had veggies and biscuits, along with eggs). I found it odd that our food came out at separate times, all a few minutes apart. First the pomme frites, then the fruit and granola. My sandwich was next and my BF had to wait a few more minutes before his plate arrived. Everyone got water and our bill was $43, which I think was overpriced. Another thing worth mentioning is that all of their water had a fruit or herbal infusion. Might not be desired for someone who doesn't like that kind of stuff.I would go back to Taste, but it would not be a regular restaurant I'd frequent. I really think it's overpriced."], ["Olive D.", "What can I say about Taste that isn't already on here! Taste is amazing and full of fresh food and new ideas. The pomme frites are amazing but don't try to eat them by yourself. They can probably feed three people an order! This is one of my favorite places to eat by myself. Some of my favorites are the chicken salad, Cobb salad, and my ever classic go-to, the cheesy biscuits and gravy with eggs on top. That meal is one to make you want an afternoon nap! Never tried the desserts but I know I'll be back. Also, if you want a mimosa or Bloody Mary with brunch, careful, you'll pay for it. Other than that, this place has deserved its credit and I love it!"], ["Sheldon W.", "Made a trip to see some friends in the area - and over the weekend we stopped here. They had their regular orders and seemed super satisfied as they munched away. The pomme frites were really good. The dipping sauce made it. For my meal I got the workx bagel - which was delicious. Piled high with fresh veggies - it was a little difficult to eat - but i wouldn't change a thing about it. Also, had an iced tea. The customer service was great and I'd definitely be back to try something else off of their menu."], ["YoungJin C.", "Great place. Tuesday lunch, it wasn't a rush hour but there were some other people. We read the reviews and decided to hit it up! It didn't let us down. We were beat from getting some things done in the morning but the food really cheered us up. The truffle frites were pretty good. I just didn't have the stomach to eat it all! (what a shame! but my boyfriend finished it for me) We loved all the food we ordered, including cappucino and hot cocoa. They were pretty quick with the food, and the food was always hot when it arrived. The drinks really were great. We had a chill time, where we weren't constantly feelings like we had to get out. Everyone was their own pace. Super friendly staff. When we were ordering he were introducing some specials for the day, which we didn't get unfortunately because we already had our minds set but regardless, it was really nice of him!

My mom and I found this delicious hotspot two years ago and have been obsessed ever since. Where to even begin? As a fries fanatic you cannot get better than Taste's pomme frittes. Made hot and fresh to order these perfectly seasoned suckers with coarse salt and served with a basil aioli sauce will have your mouth watering the moment they are placed in front of you.What I love most about the food is how light everything is. I have tried numerous dishes but my favorite is still the prosciutto and caprese sandwich. Everything is fresh. Fresh mozzarella, fresh greens, fresh tomatoes and best of all a freshly made vinaigrette that adds a nice kick to the sandwich. This is the perfect light, but filling, meal that will leave you satisfied and happy that you just filled your tummy with so many good ingredients. On top of that, my mom and I love to treat ourselves to one of their many freshly baked desserts. I have tried everything from their tangy lemon squares to their mouth watering peach cobbler. No matter the dish it tastes as if my grandma was in the kitchen whipping everything up. You cannot get more homemade tasting than that!On top of everything the atmosphere is chic and trendy. You order at the counter making it a great meeting spot. The sleek wood tables that seat multiple parties make this restaurant very casual and open. There are also cozy booths if you want to hide away, and a great outdoor space in the front. Although Taste is always crowded I have miraculously never not found a table."], ["Sal W.", "Excellent breakfast & lunch place. Their \"breakfast sandwich\" is amazing, has a fantastic pesto sauce. Love their coffee and delicious desserts. Tons of choices and lots of local ingredients. Omelettes are tasty and so are the breakfast drinks- mimosas, bellinis, bloody Marys. At lunch, their pomme frites come with another amazing pesto dipping sauce. The chicken salad sandwich is delicious and comes on perfectly crusty-yet-soft wheat bread and a side of pickles that are tasty and unlike any I've ever had. They also serve my favorite cider, Stella Artois Cidre.There is always a huge wait in the morning and seating is competitive, yet always manages to work out.

The decor didn't blow my mind, but the food did the job. The frites in truffle oil and chorizo with dates in sauce started the party and were both excellent, but the bacon chop entree was the star. This unique cut of pork, coated with tomatoes and rosemary in a magical sauce, seemed like an overwhelming portion upon arrival. Then I crushed it. It was so juicy and succulent I couldn't control myself. For a place I considered a lunch spot (out of my own ignorance) this was one of the better dinners I've had in the city. I could go on about the spot-on martini, the bread pudding, and the charming service but....bacon chop.

The downfall came later in the afternoon. Not only myself, but another member of my group experienced some significant bowel troubles. This wasn't a pleasant experience. I'll spare you the details. I find this particularly troubling because I've dined there 4-5 times now,and each time it's been slightly less enjoyable, especially this last visit.

Wow. was I surprised. This was really a steak and it was cooked to the proper temperature.

We arrived on a Friday night to find a shockingly empty dining room (there was a pacers game that night so it may have been busier earlier). With only about half of the main floor seating filled and no one seated upstairs, I figured we were in for an evening of great food and service. We quickly ordered a house margarita, a Dos XX, and the guacamole while we looked the menu over. As several have described, the guac is made table side and is every bit as delicious as all the previous reviews describe. The Dos XX was standard, and the margarita, ordered with sugar instead of salt, arrived with salt anyway. The flavor was good and it was made with quality ingredients. Still, $5.50 for 12 oz of Dos XX and $9 for a small house margarita seemed a bit steep. Oh well, it was date night and we have the groupon. Settling on the Chile Relleno and Puerco tacos, we enjoyed our guac and drinks while we waited. All the food was delicious, but the Chile Relleno stole the spotlight for the night. So, if we had pretty good service and great food, how can I give 3 stars? The meal I described was $70 total including a tip. I'm sorry, but for the portions we received it just isn't worthy of that price point. Without the groupon, I simply wouldn't go back."], ["Beth W.", "Used a Groupon here tonight.

Awesome guacamole and if you come for happy hour you must try the Hot Lips!

The decor is quite beautiful actually but the food lacked sufficient spice and flavor of better Mexican food while the service was fine.The table started with some table-side guac which was actually the impetus for us having Mexican. We asked for one hot and one medium guac but there really wasn't much difference. The medium one was quite plan and the hot one had just a slight kick to it, really could've used a lot more kick. I eat a lot of spicy food, but the whole table agreed it really wasn't spicy at all. Good guac, nice and fresh, but just not as full of flavor as advertised.The salsa was quite similar, free and unlimited at least, but would've hoped for more spice. I guess that's what you get from a more Americanized Mexican place.The trend continued. Much of the table got different types of tacos which all looked good but all needed more flavors. Just too bland. Tacos should really be full of flavor and hit you right away with a couple different flavors in every bite. These didn't, they had the ingredients there and were prepared well, but were just rather bland. And they served each taco with two soft shells, why do you need two? That just takes away even more from the taco. I think everyone at the table left behind the second tortilla.

I noticed a sign when I walked in that said something like, \"we do things different.\" \u00a0Apparently doing things different means doing things that doesn't please their customers. I came here with a large group. I went to order a frozen margarita, but they only do them on the rocks. It's 2014, invest in a blender already. One of my friends told me that's not how margaritas are made and the server bragged about how they do it with fresh fruit. Well this is the problem. The drink they brought me was so loaded with fresh fruit that I couldn't sip it through a straw. They didn't use a traditional margarita glass, which makes no sense, so using a straw was the best option. It lacked the proper amount of liquor for the price too. It was probably the absolute worst margarita I've ever had in my life. First strike.We ordered several appetizers including a delicious cheese quesadilla. One of the people in our group wanted to order the quesadilla for his main meal and the waiter told him he could not do that. We questioned why and he said it's not possible. We pressed harder and finally he said he'll ask the chef. As if putting cheese in between a couple of tortillas is some painstaking ordeal. He also made a point of saying that he will charge our group more for that as if something has magically changed in between ordering appetizers and the main course. \u00a0Strike two.As we were trying to figure our what we wanted to order the waiter explained the items they suggest. Conveniently the three items from the menu that he recommend were the three most expensive on themenu. Our party was large enough to spend over $1000 for this meal and here this waiter is trying to milk $3-5 more out of us so his tip will be better? \u00a0I'm not a fool and I don't appreciated being treated like one. \u00a0Strike three. The food was not bad and I enjoyed the enchiladas, but the experience was horrible and I couldn't get out of there quick enough.

One roomed looked like it would seat about 10. It would be great for an intimate dining party. They had a larger room that looked like it could fit about 80 people or so. It would be a nice venue for a rehearsal dinner. The food was all very fresh and the service was excellent.

No beans. My wife ordered the carne asada, and while it was definitely the better of our two meals, there was nothing about her meal that made it different than what we've ordered a hundred times at local hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurants for $12 instead of $20. After our meal we both agreed that our money would have been better spent at Hard Rock Cafe, which in itself is a terrible thing to think, let alone say out loud. But it was true.

We found out they are 1/2 price on Thursday and the same margarita for 1/2 price, definitely worth it! We ordered the table side guac spicy and it was excellent. For entrees, I got the fish tacos and my boyfriend got the shredded beef enchiladas. I tried his enchiladas, I wasn't to impressed but to be fair enchiladas aren't really my thing. He loves them.

Architecture is neat; two floors, bright and vibrant paintings, long bar- felt like a Mexican resort. What I'm really trying to write about is the margaritas. Granted I was drinking these on the house, but you have to understand that I am a beer and wine girl. Margaritas usually sound like a sugar headache at best, waking up on the bathroom floor at worst. \u00a0These margaritas were sweet but they were delicious! None of that syrup nonsense. Sour enough to keep them interesting. Tried a Lomito. Did not regret it. Would come here just for margaritas (and order some guac just to avoid looking like a total lush).Guac was awesome, salsa good, Mexican pizza delicious, and there was some sort of fish/fruit/chip combo that was refreshing.

The fresh made $9 guacamole was good, but don't show up hungry because everyone will only get one taste. They only use one avocado to make it. The \"salsa\" was more of a sauce than salsa.

The \"chicken tortilla soup\" had like 4 pieces of cubed chicken then they poured something over it that looked like the saucey salsa and it was terrible. I took one bite and asked them to take it away. Don't ask for a blended margarita because they said it was blended and brought me one on the rocks. Well obviously this mixture was blended...

It's pricey, but good. My favorite choice so far has been the fish tacos and a side of chips and guacamole. The menu is large enough for everyone to surely find something they'd like to try.

Both times, the place was dead.It generally doesn't take much to keep me happy, but from the get-go, the service was fairly shoddy, especially since there was only one other customer in the whole place. We had to ask for menus first off. Then, several minutes after ordering, we were informed that we were given the lunch menus, which didn't apply as we were there on a Saturday. That meant that one item ordered wasn't available, and the tacos that were $9.99, were now $6 more for the same thing. Not a good start.The tacos were good, as I've had them before, but they are not $16 good. The portions are quite small. My guests were smart enough not to fall for the guacamole (which is good), but not for $8.50. Overall, the drinks are small and expensive, the food is overpriced, and the service was certainly lacking on this experience.

He was never there when we needed him and his recommendations for a less strong drink was horrendous. Getting more tortilla chips seemed to be harder than it should have been.Atmosphere: Beautiful decor, but there was a rather obnoxious woman a couple tables down from us that was obviously having relationship problems that no one wanted to hear about.Appetizers: The guacamole was great, but it would have been better if I had not known that the woman making our guacamole had barely washed her hands in the bathroom. I'm not sure she even used soap. The salsa sampler wasn't anything fantastic. I preferred the salsa that was complimentary. Entrees: I got something called \"chalupitas,\" which were meats in dough cups basically. The dough was soggy and the only meat that was even rather good was the steak. My boyfriend got the \"Enchilada de Pollo,\" which he seemed to like, but to me the sauce tasted like quite a bit of cinnamon. It was absolutely inedible to me. Drinks: I started off with the Coconut Mojito, which might have been great if it hadn't been too strong for my preference. I asked our waiter for something less strong and he recommended a sangria. I took one sip of the white sangria and decided it was not for me due to the fact that it was straight up wine and nothing else. My boyfriend on the other hand got the fresh muddled fruit margarita and it was quite strong as well. He seemed think it was just subpar. If you are looking for strong drinks, this is the place to go! If not, then don't get any drinks here.Overall: I would not go back to this place again. The service was terrible and the food wasn't anything spectacular for the price we paid. Our server didn't seem to care that we barely touched our drinks and cared more about other tables than waiting on us.

This was my first go around with ceviche, so I'm not sure, but it didn't seem very traditional.For the entree I got the flank steak. It was cut in short strips and served with tortillas, so that was a fun way to eat it. It was really tender and perfectly cooked.For dessert I had the corn cake. It was tasty, king of like a sweetened corn bread.Overall I had a good night, the service was good and the decor fit nicely. Even though this is a chain it didn't seem like it too much."], ["Jackie H.", "Love this place!! It kicked off our Shamrock series weekend and it delivered big time! The table side guacamole is a must and all four of us had amazing dishes according to the ooohs and ahhhs and lack of talking! I had the pork tenderloin with mole sauce and a corn tamal. The corn tamal was the most unique and delicious I have ever had. I made everyone try it and they all got the look of \" I just went to heaven\" come across their faces. Hands down best ever wished I had a huge plate of just that! The pork was great very tender and juicy and the sauce had just the right amount of smoke. We also did the 4 salsa sampler pico was amazing ordered extra it was so good. Do yourself a favor and go check it out!!"]], "La Mulita": [["Libby B.", "Pisco!!!! Ever since I visited the land of Pisco this summer (Peru), I had yet to experience a restaurant in the US offering a cocktail with this most delicious and exotic of spirits. Tonight's special creation was the Pisco Punch Royale, and believe me, I took full advantage! I just hope to be able to sample some other amazing concoctions with Pisco in the future! I decided to partake in the chef's special for the night, the Poblano Chicken, which was a sandwich with chicken, melty cheese, arugula, and cilantro on top! For me, it doesn't get any better than cilantro, but the arugula just added that right bite of bitterness on top! My husband and I had to have 2 orders of guacamole! The heat comes courtesy of serrano peppers! I can't really put into words how much I love guacamole, but this for me was bliss! Husband also had the pork tacos. He immediately recognized the menu as street food, and I really wish he'd share his opinions via Yelp! La Mulita has a parking lot in front and back (very limited spaces) so plan to park on the street or elsewhere if you come during a busy time. I'm already planning to bring my sister here (who lives in Mexico!) during the Christmas season. I can't wait to go back!"], ["Ethan H.", "Holy Mole!That was good. Enjoyed a wonderful evening here as part of a Yelp Elite event. Got to sample a wide variety of their food, and each dish was better than the next. The cocktail -- created special for the event, I think -- was fantastic (and I'm not usually a cocktail kind of guy...). The manager and staff are as attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly as could be. Basically, I consider the whole event an enticing appetizer for a much-anticipated main course: coming back for a full meal!"], ["Sarah W.", "One of the best new places in Indy/ on College Ave that I have ever visited! I went for lunch one day when it wasn't too busy, but the servers were very attentive and helped explain the menu with recommendations as well. The building itself was very cool- While the space is small, it is really accommodating and the modern wood and industrial feel made the space surprisingly cozy and intimate. As a college student, I always look at prices, It was reasonably affordable- maybe not an every other day kind of place but definitely a nice outing every once in a while. But I am always willing to spend an extra dollar or two if it comes to really good food that is unique, which is exactly what I found with La Mulita! As a lover of Spanish and Mexican flavored/styled foods, the worst part about this place was deciding what to choose. Since I was with my sister, I forced her to get the guacamole (so I could eat it) and it was great! She ordered the tacos and I ordered the chilaquiles with pork and WOW speechless. Everything tasted super fresh, it was seasoned and dressed perfectly, and the tacos (stole a bite of those too) were killer. I was so full but obviously I continued to eat the whole serving. If it were more socially acceptable to order a cocktail on a Tuesday for lunch, I would have because they all looked so good. The Mezcal Mule looked especially tempting, but I put it on my (longer) list of things to get next time I go.The vibes, the food and the space meshed really well together and makes it appropriate, yet really unique still, with its spot on College Ave. Can't wait to try this place again and again! Highly recommend!"], ["Joanna S.", "I just left a Yelp Elite \"Dia de los Muertos\" themed party at La Mulita and am already planning when I can go back.

We arrived about eight minutes before they opened for their Sunday evening meal, which left us eagerly awaiting the unlocking of the doors. La Mulita occupies a small space and is kept tidy. We sat at the bar, which is crafted of sturdy concrete. The bartender was super nice and very helpful, suggesting drinks and meals we should try.I followed his suggestions and ordered the margarita, one of the cocktails they are known for, as well as one of their well-known dishes, the Chilaquiles. If I had to describe it in a word, \"Wow!\" I ordered mine topped with eggs and chorizo. \u00a0The oozing egg yolks and the gooey cheese screams comfort food. The spiciness of the chorizo gives a needed kick, adds a flavor jolt, and makes the dish interesting. Furthermore, the margarita was delicious. The agave nectar and orange blossom provides a nice taste twist to the normal margarita, and what puts my joy over the top is the price. It was only $6.00!I had an excellent experience and don't have one complaint. The food, atmosphere, service, and price are spectacular, therefore my rating is five stars.

(all the tacose are great, these are just my favs)Guacamole: probably one of the best in the city and made fresh. besides the normal guac they add in fresh jalapenos and pistachios. its amazing!Salsa: nothing fancy just darn good salsa!Drinks: their margaritas are made with no store bough mix, they create it in house. not too sweet not too sour. there are a couple of other drinks that are from the Delicia menu like the fire and ice that are pretty great.The bar is small but they have a nice beer selection with some locals on tap.The place is small but quant and fun to dine at. I have been many of times and only once did we have an issue. It was slammed busy and the waitress that was working our section was horrible (not purposely just couldn't keep up).

Situated to the left of Delicia, this is a great little spot with a bar, variety of wooden tables for small groups, and some booth seating for a few pairs of couples in the back. Decor is a touch industrial, but unique and fun, with big string lights hanging across the ceiling. Bit more of an intimate atmosphere - nothing wild and crazy...or at least, not on a Wednesday night.Food-wise, my friend and I opted for a cocktail each (about $6-7 each), split an order of guac ($5 - delicious!) and ordered our own cemitas (a.k.a. slider sandwiches). I ordered the veggie and I'm pretty sure I could live off these things - breaded eggplant as the \"burger,\" topped with roasted red peppers, cheese, and chipotle mayo on a bun (recommend removing the nob on the bun and eating that separate, btw). We also split an order of churros ($3.50) and while good, I'd prefer a thicker, chocolate-ier sauce. This was more like dipping it in hot chocolate, which wasn't quite substantial enough in the presence of all that fried doughy goodness! Overall, though, very pleased with the food. Service was fantastic - very attentive and helpful in explaining drinks, entrees, and portion sizes. Will definitely be returning - chilaquiles are calling my name!"], ["Brittany S.", "Yeah! Congrats La Mulita! What better day to give this new restaurant a whirl than Cinco de Mayo with $5 salt rimmed margaritas? First off, the margarita was mighty tasty. The second one was equally delicious ;) I'm not typically a marg fan but in the spirit of the day I opted for not one but two. In general, La Mulita's cocktail menu is very wallet-friendly with most drinks falling in the $6 to $7 price range. Also, I appreciated that they had new local breweries like Outliers on the menu.Before I move on to the eats, I have to mention how cozy and sexy the space is - from the low lighting to the industrial vibe with wood timber, exposed beams, etc. (see picture) The lighting found that perfect spot between too bright and fluorescent and uber dark (ya know...we're trying super hard to feel like a speakeasy/you can hardly see your date). Nicely done. Eats: -My personal favorite was the refreshing Columbian coleslaw - I appreciated that it wasn't heavy and left me feeling less guilty about the half dozen other eats I sampled during our visit.-Delicious guac - I knew this going in but I would also like to add that the chips were tasty to boot. -salsa and chips - nothing mind blowing but I would definitely order again-kale chips - I hate to buy these when out because I can make them pretty well at home but I couldn't resist trying my neighbors - - soooo good! Plus, it's a great healthier bar bite option.-roasted red cabbage and sundried tomato pesto dip: we probably should have stopped ordering more food before this because by the time it rolled around I needed to unbutton my pants. My dining companions couldn't believe that there wasn't any meat in this app, it somehow pulled off a hearty taste with all veggies. -lastly, vegetarian chiliquales: on the dry side. Unfortunately, I couldn't taste the pepper. I'm thinking if there were a few more veggies and more \"sauce\" this dish would be top notch. Can't wait for my next visit!"], ["Felicia D.", "The service was amazing thanks to Harry. They were playing Motown music, which is always a win. The food was pretty good.

One of the downsides that I can see to this location is parking. Yes, it is great that there is \u00a0small lot in front and back, but if both restaurants are busy, I could see having to hunt for street parking. The restaurant is on the smaller side, having a mix of lower level tables and high top tables, with additional sitting at the bar. There are three tvs that allow you to watch a game while you dine. It's decor is that of a very polished cantina. The little extra touches, such as the brick wall, decorative tin on the under bar, and the light shades made of cans on the wall, shouldn't go unnoticed. The ceilings are on the high side, so it will most likely get loud at times.The menu has a nice variety of choices. If your looking to find the same food as Delicia, you will not see it on the menu. The only things in common between these two restaurants are the guacamole, sangria, and margarita. The menu does note which items are vegetarian. While there is no gluten free menu, the salads, soups, and tacos are either gf or can be altered to be gf.Starting off the meal with a Rum Punch, which packed punch, I felt the need to offset all of that sweetness with something a little bit salty and on the healthier side. The side of kale chips fit the bill perfectly. Looking over the taco choices, it was hard to decide which one to chose, luckily there is a combo in which you can choose two for $7. I opted for the grilled shrimp taco and carne asada taco. The tacos are on the smaller side, but do not let that fool you. They were packed full and extremely filling. The carne asada taco was good. The skirt steak had a nice marinate to it, but it was the grilled shrimp taco that stole the show for me. It was amazing. The pickled slaw and honey chipotle sauce complemented each other very well. \u00a0I will definitely be back for some more shrimp tacos, and would recommend anyone looking for a cheap and filling meal, with great service to try La Mulita."], ["Melinda S.", "My boyfriend has been here many times, but I visited La Mulita for the first time last night. I can definitely see why he has eaten here so many times! I ordered the chilaquiles and a margarita and my boyfriend got the taquitos (on special) and a beer.

This place was packed, but we apparently timed it right and everything worked out perfectly.No May 5th is complete without some guacamole, so it was ordered almost the second we sat down. The portion was a little smaller than I expected, but we ordered a couple more appetizers that we all shared and it seemed to work out. Food was delicious. I had a steak taco and a pork slider, and both were outstanding. I wish they would have come with a little side of tortilla chips though - some of the steak escaped and I had to use my fingers to scoop it up. Yeah, I could have asked for a fork... but where's the fun in that?I was introduced to Kale chips here... something I have never had, but will definitely be making at home in the very near future. Delicious!My personal opinion--I would probably come here for lunch and skip it for dinner. The menu is limited for dinner, and a lot of the options that sounded appealing to me weren't available at dinner. I've also been told the fire and ice cocktail served next door isn't available here.

One was there because, like me, he wanted to see the headliner. The other was there to see the opener -- he didn't much care for the main act. They managed to pull off some kind of heist with the stub where the second guy watched the opener, left, and handed off the ticket to the first guy to watch the headliner. The way the second guy felt about the opener is how I feel about La Mulita. I don't much care for Delicia next door, but La Mulita is solid. It's like Delicia, but scaled back just enough in tone, snobbiness, and price to be a great place for a casual drink and bite. The drink selection is different, but just as good as Delicia's, and is much more reasonable. The food itself is lighter, but the portions are still large enough to satisfy -- unless you like the bloated feeling you get from overeating -- and the quality is just as good. Probably the most uncommon thing you'll find there are their cemitas, which are basically just tortas on a sesame seed bun. They're slider-sized, but not too shabby.That said, I'd have to be pretty passionate about an opener to pay full concert price to see them -- I'd need to like the main act, too. La Mulita feels the same way. I like it, but not enough to draw me back as a standalone. It's the kind of place I'd go to before or after something, or sandwiched between things, because it was nearby or convenient or not too crowded.

So that being said getting around to ordering took awhile because I couldn't make up my mind. I ended up going with the server recommended tlayuda a sort of mexican pizza. It was awesome. My wife got the fish tacos and they remind me of the fresh catch fish tacos I loved when I was in San Diego. Very good. Washed it down with a mezcal mule, basically tequila that isn't from the tequila region in Mexico.

I think the portions are just right - not enough that I either feel too stuffed or have to take a box home, but even when I arrive hungry, I leave perfectly satisfied.

I'm pretty sure my guacamole is the best ever, but theirs is pretty fabulous. It's really limey (word?) and spicier than I make mine, but we loved it. Homemade tortilla chips, I'm pretty sure, which is always a bonus. I had the Chimichurri sliders (ground beef, worcestershire, onion, red bell pepper, garlic, tomatillos, pickled slaw, chime sauce) because we'd sampled them at the Yelp event, I knew they were good, and I can admit my lack of adventurous spirit. Husband had the Cochinita Pibil Cemita (also sliders, these with achiote roasted pork, pickled onions, black beans, avocado). I liked mine, but I loved his. Heads up: these are just the sliders, no sides come with them. It was fine for us, since we started with the guacamole, plus the 2 sliders were pretty fulfilling on their own.

You also have to pay for chips and salsa, which were nothing to write home about. Our bartender seemed more concerned with washing dishes than checking on us or our drinks to top it off.

It is the perfect place to grab a bite to eat if you are in the mood for Latin American cusine with a slight Caribbean influence. \u00a0Come here for lunch rather than dinner because the lunch menu offers more options. \u00a0It's the perfect place to have lunch with coworkers, friends or family. After looking at their menu for a while, I was torn between a couple options. Luckily, the lunch menu offers a 'Pick Two' option so I selected the two cemitas that drew my attention. The first was the cochinita pibil cemita, featuring pulled pork roasted in achiote topped with pickled onions, black beans and a MEASLY slice of avocado. The sesame bun was toasted slightly but still maintained a softness that provided a great backdrop to the strong Latin flavors of the black beans and the achiote. My only complaint was the avocado slice was too small, slightly disappointing and not contributing to the flavor of the cemita as much as I had hoped. The second was the pork milanesa cemita which consisted of breaded pork under a thin layer of Oaxaca cheese, chorizo, fried egg, chipotle peppers and cilantro mayo. This was my favorite of the two. The breading on the pork served as an intermediate between the spice of the chipotle peppers and the chorizo. The cilantro mayo and the fried egg were two great additions to the texture of the cemita and combined well with the rest of the ingredients. Also photographed are the vegetarian cemita and the carne asada taco. The vegetarian cemita consisted of a lightly breaded eggplant patty adorned with roasted peppers, chihuahua cheese as caramelized onion. The cemita also featured the delicious cilantro mayo. The carne asada taco was filled with marinated skirt steak, onions, cilantro and radish. Ingredients were served in a corn tortilla. The only complaint was that the taco was very tiny and not very filling. My advice? Stick to the cemitas. Overall, a great new restaurant in a fabulous part of Indianapolis. A much better price than Delicia and it's casual, rustic vibe is inviting and hip. I can't wait to try a few other items on the menu whenever I'm back in town!"], ["Leila B.", "Great portions. Kid friendly. Tasty food and awesome staff. My kids loved the carnitas tacos and mexicano hot dog. And they didn't make a big deal about my daughter wanting all the toppings on the side. Oh and don't forget the guacamole. Yum!"], ["Matt B.", "Harry the bar tender and waiter was dead on with both drink and food recommendations flavors were well balanced and was well priced for the freshness. Will def be coming back"], ["Kendra S.", "Great atmosphere, delicious drinks... A must stop in sobro!"], ["Jamison R.", "We went for dinner the other night and tried a number of items. \u00a0The menu at dinner is pretty limited but there's a good variety. \u00a0We split a bunch of stuff and I thought everything was very good. \u00a0Also, cocktails are great and reasonably priced. \u00a0They have a full bar along with wines by the glass and a good selection of beer. The lunch menu is bigger. \u00a0I look forward to going back and trying some other things."], ["Kodi C.", "As an avid fan of Delicia I was eager to try La Mulita. With a shared kitchen and more affordable plates I was not disappointed! The decor is fun yet casual which fits nicely with their menu. The plate sizes are smaller but the cuisine is still mouth-watering! Latin food with a bit of flare and all within your budget. I highly recommend for a quick bite, casual date night, or just fun night with friends!"], ["Melissa D.", "The food was meh. I got one of the taco options and was really disappointed about how bland they were. The same is true of the service; friendly but just meh. The killer for me was the price; for a group of 5 our total came to a whopping $125. Talk about sticker shock. Don't expect chips and salsa for free, it's not. Womp womp all around. Won't be going back."], ["Rachael B.", "I came to this restaurant on a Saturday night. We sat at the bar and were tended to immediately. The atmosphere was very relaxed and the bartender was extremely welcoming and made wonderful drinks. I had the rum punch and we ordered a few appetizers. Everything about this place was wonderful! The customer service was excellent and I will definitely return and recommend this restaurant to family and friends. The only negative aspect of this restaurant is that it is difficult to find. Other than that, excellent!!"], ["Erin D.", "We loved it! We went at an odd time (3 pm on a Thursday afternoon) so we had the run of the place... Everything we ate was delicious. The margarita may be the best I've ever had! Our server was awesome and made sure to bring our son's food first without our asking, which was really thoughtful. My only complaint was that they switch to the dinner menu at 3... I would have liked the \"pick 2\" on the lunch menu to try more \u00a0Looking forward to trying Delicia even more now that we've tried the \"little sister\"."], ["Colleen F.", "Great drinks and service at the bar! Guacamole was delicious (small portion but delicious). It's a fun little spot for cocktails before dinner."], ["Cortney H.", "My new favorite place. I've been three times already. (It's really close to my house, don't judge.) I've tried a good portion of the menu and haven't been disappointed yet. I only wish you could get the full menu for dinner as well. Drink the Pear-a-Mule, so good!!"], ["Tania R.", "Delicious. We were going to Delicia, but found this right next door and it was already opened - we had to wait for Delicia. We also weren't dressed very nice and didn't want to spend too much, so it was a better choice between the two, though we still want to go to Delicia for the Ribeye. Had the Tlayuda de Chorizo and pork carnitas tacos and they were delicious. Bought the salsa fresca appetizer - wish a basket was free with the meal. And had the margharitas, which were good, but smaller than Delicia - a tad cheeper. But i wanted it to be a little bigger. Overall delicious and we'd go back. Very friendly!If I went back, I would go for lunch instead - the menu has more options that I wanted to try."], ["Victor G.", "They have updated the dinner menu to include some tacos and other items! It makes me happy. La Mulita is only getting better!"], ["Jake M.", "A friend told me we should have lunch here, am always open to new cool places, but was surprised by how cool and good this place was. Great interior design, exposed brick, cool bar area, etc. I ordered the Chilaquiles with the fried egg (+$1), super good, it's a little pricy if you get the steak (+$3) but the egg was the perfect amount to get full with. All in all my bill would have been around $9-10 for a pretty good lunch but they accidentally forgot to make mine so get this, they gave it to me for free for being late, that is stand up and something you really dont see much in Indianapolis. Big fan of La Mulita and will eat here again, also excited to try Delicia!"], ["G J.", "We liked the restaurant atmosphere and service was great. We felt that some our food had been sitting a bit. We had the fish and pork tacos. Both were lifeless and mushy, how about some finely chopped tomatoes and sweet sour cream sauce. We also had an appetizer which could be described as corn hash/ mush. We have had far better from Indies food trucks at half the price. Won't return. Dessert was great"], ["Rob B.", "Food was decent but a little pricy for what it was. We could have spent $20 more and ate next door at Delicia! \u00a0(Which is fabulous if you haven't been!!)"], ["Jeannie O.", "Cute, casual spot off college ave...limited seating, no patio and very limited food menu. Tacos are good, croquetas are so so, atmosphere is festive, nice spot for a quick drink if you are waiting for a table at Delicia next door. Bartender was ok...hard to make conversation which is a first in Indy! I prefer more welcoming, inviting bartenders that keep you coming back for more but Trey...the server was awesome! I'd return for a cas drink and appetizer."], ["Matthew K.", "Went to Delicia, the associated restaurant next door but the wait was long, so the staff said this place had seating. We ordered a bunch of appetizers like guacamole and the chicken croquettes. All of them were good particularly the latter. Portion size on the guacamole was a bit disappointing. The entrees were more sized as expected. Fish tacos were decent and I also got the Mexicano dog, which was good too. The lunch menu is far more extensive. I would be inclined to try La Mulita again for lunch. All in all it was appetizing and enjoyable."], ["KC N.", "I've been to La Mulita for both lunch and dinner and it is quite good. \u00a0The cocktails are very reasonably priced, the cermitas are excellent, and the tacos are very, very good. \u00a0My complaint \u00a0is regarding the dinner menu compared to the lunch menu. \u00a0The dinner menu is more than half the size of the lunch menu. \u00a0Having young kids are adventurous eaters, I think we'd come back for dinner more if the lunch menu was available in the evening-just for the variety. \u00a0Additionally, I think the portions at La Mulita are great for sharing---I think people would probably order more food at dinner if the lunch menu was available."], ["Carolyn S.", "Walked into Delicia and was under-dressed so opted for La Mulita. I was impressed! \u00a0Very small menu but delicious. Great service!!!"], ["Jaimie C.", "I went here with my husband and daughter a month or so ago. The food was okay but I was not blown away by anything we had. The service was also a bit slow."], ["Naomi S.", "Some of my friends had been here and highly recommended it, so we went there for some food. \u00a0The Mexicano dog had been one of the items they mentioned, so I got one. \u00a0To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of hot dogs, but I do love things wrapped in bacon and covered in \u00a0guacamole, so I gave it a shot. \u00a0It looked pretty good, but upon picking it up to take a bite, the bun was already falling apart. Strike one- can't my bun be intact when it arrives in front of me, please? But, whatever, I figured I'd just cut it with a fork and eat it. \u00a0This is difficult, though, with so many toppings. \u00a0When I started cutting it, I realized that the bacon, well, was just raw and had no meat on it. Just a slimy pale white blob wrapped around the hot dog. The only thing I found myself saying was \"this is a disaster\". Strike two. I sent it back. I was still hungry, of course, and the bartender said I wouldn't be charged for it (awesome, thanks) so I split the pork tacos and chimichurri sliders with the aforementioned friends. \u00a0The tacos, while being highly recommended by various people at the bar (we ate at the bar) were nothing special- pretty dry. The sliders, same thing. Dry, basic, and uninspiring. \u00a0My friends, who've been \u00a0gushing about this place, were also pretty unimpressed and apologized to me for the food. \u00a0\"It's usually better\" they said. Strike three. Don't know if I'll be back, at least not for the food items I got this last time. That said, service was good, beers were good, atmosphere and decor is cool. \u00a0But. \u00a0I'd rather spend a little more next door at Delicia and absolutely love what I get. To be fair, I'm a late night sort and there is never a wait at Delicia when I head in after \"normal\"dinner time. Hopefully La Mulita gets its act together to consistently deliver the kind of food that made my friends rave in the first place."], ["Richard H.", "The interior is really cool. It does not appear to be a busy place -- Delicia is definitely more hopping -- and their dinner menu is a severely abbreviated version of their lunch menu, so definitely go for lunch instead of dinner. Nice selection of tacos, salads and sandwiches."], ["Anne M.", "Went for lunch and sat at the bar, thinking that might be quicker since we needed to get in and out quickly. The guac and chips were excellent. Not as excellent as the guac they serve next door at Delicia since there are no pistachios, but nearly as excellent. The guac was served up immediately. Then the looong wait for our other food began. The bartender was attentive to our iced tea refills, so his service skills were high, it must have just taken a long time to cook what we ordered. My husband had the El Carribean dog. Tasty he said, but probably not worth $6. The chips they mention on the menu are crumbled over the dog fixings. I had the Pick 2 with one shrimp taco, which was really nice and a vegetarian cemita which was awesome. Really, the cemita, made with eggplant, roasted red peppers with cheese is so flavorful, you would not miss the meat. I highly recommend it. They had three televisions, all on different sports channels. Audio was not up on any of the televisions and it was easy to have a conversation in this cute space."]], "Louie's Wine Dive": [["Heather D.", "So impressed. From the rustic/urban/industrial decor to the super patient and perfect amount of engaged waitress, to the biscuits & gravy that made me drool, I definitely loved this place. We came for brunch - each of us having something drool worthy and clearly made fresh in-house. The carafes of mimosas were just big enough for each of us to have a glass, so it saved $$ for each of us to take a turn buying one. It was totally easy to get a seat - we were the only ones there when they opened at 9 on a Sunday morning, but I would say the crowd didn't pick up until 10:30. I would assume this will continue to be the case until they get more popular. Still - a good sized crowd for only being open a month or two!Only con I can think of is that for my side of biscuits & gravy, I had more gravy than biscuit. So I asked for another, naturally. BUT, in all fairness, it was actually a side of biscuit to which the waitress graciously *added* the gravy. So, maybe I have no cons at all. Oh wait! There was only the one unisex bathroom. But, no biggie.Definitely ready to go back for dinner! 5 Stars worth of Thumbs Up Louie's Wine Dive!"], ["Amy R.", "A great addition to the bar / restaurant scene on Mass Ave. I can say that I have enjoyed all of the food and most of the wine that I have had here. Great selection of wines by the glass and they will also open a bottle that is not by the glass as long as you commit to at least drinking two glasses out of it.The reason for my lower amount of stars is due to the extremely slow service. I have come here on four separate occasions with four different servers and it has been the same... slow. The last time we sat at the bar and after waiting 20 min I finally said something to the bartender so we could actually order. They don't seem to have a very user friendly POS system because for every order it took the guy 5 min minimum to enter into the system.I am hoping that at some point their service gets better because I do enjoy this place otherwise."], ["Tiffany B.", "I'm between a 3-4 stars, but I'll opt for higher at present. Upside: on Mass Ave, and even if it's not on the 'by the glass' list, if you order 2 glasses of something, they will open the bottle for you. How's that for a helluva nice host? Had a decent salad and the entrees were pretty good. My fella had a chicken dish that was quite juicy and tender. Decor was a little disjointed and odd, but hey, we live in a disjointed and odd sort of world. I had some sort of fish special that was edible and filling, but not super memorable.Will be back for further diving..."], ["Clare L.", "I give Louie's a 4.5 for the wine and a 3.5 for the food, so I'd say that evens out to the rating I'm giving the place. Here's why:I was very impressed with the wine selection and our waiter was extremely knowledgeable when it came to talking about the wines available. They were out of the rose I wanted but he was quick to bring me a sample of a substitute. The only thing that disappointed me about that was the price point on the substitute. I'll admit it - I like cheap wine. I hesitate to pay $11 for a glass of wine out when I could get 2 bottles of a cheap wine at the grocery store for the same price. I know, I know, it's all about the experience.... I ended up going with a glass of Pinot Grigio. It looks like $7 a glass is the lowest price point on wine that I could find on the menu. Something to keep in mind for those who are like myself and like cheap wine.The food - I struggled to find any sort of consistency on the menu. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing, but it seemed like a lot of random dishes thrown together on a piece of paper with an attempt at being trendy. We got the deviled eggs and 4 Cheese Shrimp BBQ flatbread to share. The deviled eggs were AMAZING - the BLT theme was a unique twist I've not seen before. I was iffy on the flatbread - the BBQ was sweeter rather than tangier, and it almost tasted syrupy. Too sweet for my taste but not an overall bad dish. I freaked out a little when I saw the Emily's Apple Harvest salad because it had goat cheese, apples, cranberries, candied nuts, among other things that I love on salads. The salad was delicious and filling. I will definitely be back to Louie's - the atmosphere was great and there are more things on the menu that intrigue me - crab poutine, shrimp & peach salad, pork gnocchi, and shrimp diablo among others. Looks like I'll have to come back a lot!"], ["Jon C.", "I've sampled some of the brunch items at a private party recently, so I decided to stop in on a Saturday morning to check out the real deal and see how it is. Arriving about 10am on a Saturday, I had the bar to myself and only two of the tables by the front windows were full.. Definitely a hidden gem on Mass Ave for a Saturday brunch. Sunday's though are a different story.. Totally packed from what I've heard. Breakfast started with a carafe of cranberry mimosas. Heavy on the cranberry and light on the bubbles, this probably wasn't my best mimosa I've had, but certainly not the worst. I'm a huge Eggs Benedict fan, and it was a tough decision to go with the classic (with ham), the harvest (roasted veggies) or the Crab Cake (with crab cakes). I decided to go the traditional route with the classic, which was served with a side of breakfast potatoes. Being one of the only ones in the restaurant, my food came out lickety split. My first thought was that my portion side was too small.. Then I realized that it was huge, but the plates were bigger than they appeared. There's a lot of food on the plate, and I was stuffed after finished half of my brunch. The eggs were great.. Perfectly poached, and the sauce has just the right amount of acidity. Presentation was a little plain, but this was a darn tasty brunch and one I'll try again!"], ["Ronak S.", "This is exactly the kind of wine place I've been craving. I can't get down with my own perception of the pretention of wine-tastings. Not that I'm unpretentious myself -- I'm as pretentious as they come -- but when given the choice between a snooty wine and a down-to-Earth beer, the beer always won out.Louie's Wine Dive ratchets down to casual in a beautiful way, making the decision of what to order much more accessible to the uninitiated. Coupled with decent food and even a small beer and liquor selection, the place truly lives up to its name, \"wine dive.\" Granted, there's no pool or darts, but the menu is balanced enough to appeal to many different strata of taste, all at once. The flights are a great concept too, as I'm always wanting to sample bits of things before committing to anything. All in all, an innovative, appealing addition to the Mass Ave scene."], ["Carrie B.", "One word, amazing! I asked the chef if he could make something vegan & he did not disappoint! He had me at coconut cream base! He made a veggie flatbread with other fresh veggies. It was unbelievably delicious! We also had a few mimosa carafes which were great as well!"], ["Danielle W.", "Let me start off by saying, I've only had the brunch here but I plan to go back VERY SOON for the dinner. The first time I went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon, I had the Breakfast Flatbread A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. I would totally recommend it again and their mimosas are very affordable. The second time I went for a Yelp Elite Brunch and we got to taste so many delectable foods/drinks! I was dying to try their Biscuits and Gravy and I can confirm you are MISSING OUT if you don't get them. Additionally, I had the Mac Daddy Omelette (could have used more seasoning), corned pork hash (highly recommend), Drunken French Toast, and the White Chocolate Bread Pudding. I usually am not a fan of French Toast or Bread Pudding, but MAN it was good! The drinks-Breakfast Sangria- It was pretty good but I would prefer a mimosaLouie Latte-HOLY TASTEBUDS- I LOVE THIS DRINK! Recommendations- Adding chocolate drizzle on top with a cookie straw and you have a wonderful desert. Friendly and welcoming staff. The environment and d\u00e9cor of this place fits very well on Mass Ave. I would recommend you check out this new establishment!"], ["Casey C.", "My boyfriend and I had a reservation through Open Table at Louie's for a celebration dinner on a Saturday night. The food was ok-to-good, not the best we've ever had. My blackened salmon salad was good but it didn't really stand out and my boyfriend's fish and chips had very heavy breading on the fish. But the wine was excellent, I got a Pinot Grigio and my boyfriend got a Malbec. Our server was very knowledgable about the menu and offered good tips and quick service. It does have a different ambiance than I was expecting: it's fairly lit up and there are actually two TVs in the bar. I didn't mind it, it was just unexpected for a wine bar. It seemed to be one of those in-between restaurants where you basically can make it more casual or fancy based on your preference.I think I would be willing to try it again, especially with a group of friends!"], ["Mary T.", "After months of passing by Louie's as I habitually make my way across the street to Bakersfield reminding myself that I need to check it out, I finally did! To my surprise we were offered a table on a Saturday night without a wait but not for their lack of business but in part due to their large space with ample seating without feeling tightly packed or tables in such close proximity that you can clearly follow along with your neighbors conversation. We ended up sitting at the bar for a more casual feel and immediately were greeted by Zak, one of the bartenders who happens to know his wines, are you surprised? Not knowing what goodies I wanted to try on the menu, I asked for a red wine of his choosing and had the Chapoutier Ciboise Syrah - a French Syrah that had a bold full body flavor that only comes from French wines. It was such a smooth wine that I had a second glass! As far as the food goes - I highly recommend the brussel sprouts in a red wine reduction with a subtle hint of sweetness that are a perfect fall food. I also tried the quinoa salad with a strawberry vinaigrette that made me realize quinoa with spinach is not only a super food combination but also when prepared correctly will make you sad that you finished your greens. Don't be embarrassed to order a second salad at $5, why not? Overall I must say I am impressed with the wine selection and the staff who knows how to accommodate guests with refined American cuisine that is relatable and suitable for all palates alike! p.s. rumor has it that the white chocolate brioche bread pudding will make you do a happy dance"], ["Drew T.", "I love this place. The Windee appetizers and the atmosphere I would recommend it to anyone."], ["Ashley P.", "Absolutely adorned this new spot on Mass Ave! Met some girl friends for dinner. I had a glass of the Malbec but was so tempted to try many more on the menu. A \"dive\" is not at all what this place is. We started with the cheese plate and the squeaky cheese. I would have preferred the squeaky cheese warmed but they were both delicious. A+ homemade horseradish sauce on the cheese plate. I had the shrimp Diablo for for main dish. It was absolutely delicious. Just the right amount of spice. And the perfect amount to have some to take home for lunch the next day! We finished the meal with the chocolate torte. It was extremely rich. I recommend splitting this. And a glass of ros\u00e9! Overall quality experience here. Will be returning with more friends in the future!"], ["Matthew P.", "I expected a lot more out of this place based on the reviews and the location. \u00a0My girl and I ordered two glasses of wine and an appetizer. \u00a0The wine selection was nothing to write home about and was overpriced. \u00a0The appetizer was overly salty and overpriced. \u00a0Come to find out, Louie's is a chain as well. \u00a0Skip this place and support local when your on Mass Ave."], ["Tonya S.", "What's not to love about this fun new place on Mass Ave?! \u00a0I have visited a few times since Louie's opened and here are a few things I loved: \u00a0The daily drink specialsThe sangriaThe service They will open any bottle of wine for you as long as you commit to 2 glassesThe variety of bloody mary optionsThe interiorThe brunch menu - loved the crab cake eggs benedict, side potatoes and SB&G - delish! \u00a0(only complaint here was not enough gravy for the generous portion of biscuits)I highly recommend checking this place out. \u00a0They are advertising a happy hour menu on Monday evenings, but each time I have visited on a Monday, they have said it isn't available yet. \u00a0Can't wait until it is!"], ["Dylan E.", "I've only made it in here for a couple of visits, but I have been disappointed each time. I'll start off by putting out the disclaimer that I have not actually made it in here just on a random night out to get some dinner or drinks, so maybe that's their bread and butter, but what I have made it here for I will not try again.The first time I was here was for a wine tasting event, which you bought a ticket for and then got to sample a variety of different wines from a number of different distributors. The event was fun, and we got to try some good wines and have some of their great food, but it was insanely unorganized. I think it was the first one they had, so it might operate a lot more smoothly now, but it's kept me from even thinking about trying it again. The number of wines that we were supposed to get to try varied wildly from week to week for the month or so leading up to it. The ticket process was a mess, and seemed extremely redundant and unnecessary. Nobody from the hostess to the distributors knew what anybody was supposed to be doing, and they were still getting it setup at the time that they said it would be starting. There was also not really anywhere for us to sit, and no tables to set our glasses down on in the area where this event was. When we eventually went to their seating area they asked us to move so they could seat other customers. Again, I think this was the first time they did this so maybe take it with a grain of salt, but they lost my confidence.I also recently made it in here for brunch, and was once again disappointed. Our server was not very good, but I always forgive that as long as it isn't a trend. They can't control it if one person happens to be having a bad day, and I haven't been here enough to know if it is consistently like that. The brunch menu wasn't very big, which is fine, but it also wasn't very interesting at all. For the $9-$10 price range that most things seemed to be at, I would much rather go to a large number of the other brunch places around Indy that offer a much more inventive selection for the same price. The music that they had playing was all classic rock, which seemed odd for a Sunday morning brunch but that may just be their thing.They were supposed to open for brunch at 9, and when we got there at a little after 10:30 the waitress said she wasn't sure if their quiche of the day was actually ready yet. I ended up going with the biscuits and gravy and it was not good. The biscuits were good, but the gravy tasted like they used ground beef instead of sausage. It tasted much more like a stroganoff than what I am used to for biscuits and gravy. The person I was eating with ordered their \"Blue Plate\" which is a typical breakfast platter that comes with eggs, potatoes, bacon, and a choice of a biscuit or toast. She is a vegetarian and the waitress said that she was not allowed to substitute anything else for the bacon, saying that she could only substitute \"a protein for a protein, a starch for a starch, etc\" which is really dumb. All she wanted was a little extra of something else, and since every single one of those items is listed as $3 on the a la carte part of their menu, they ought to be interchangeable. It was also surprising that their breakfast potatoes are deep fried and tasted like french fries rather than typical breakfast potatoes.I will still eventually make it in here for just a normal night of dinner and drinking, but until then, they are 0 for 2 in my book."], ["Kavitha D.", "I've been here for brunch and dinner, and both were good meals:BRUNCH= I ordered the crab cake benedict which came with a side of potatoes (although the menu didn't say it did). I did think the dish needed a little kick to it (a little bland for my taste), but still yummy! My friend ordered the breakfast burger. On the menu it clearly says it comes with fries, however when they brought him his meal it came with a biscuit and gravy.If you're menu says it should/shouldn't come with something, please follow it. And when we asked the waitress why it didn't come with fries, she simply stated we were wrong and it doesn't come with that. We didn't bother making a fuss out of something so small, but just something to improve on.--------------------------------------------------------DINNER= I ordered the malbec flight (all from Mendoza, Argentina!) and then a glass of a red blend. All were delicious! And the waiter was very knowledgeable, which is always a plus.Had the salmon chutney as my meal. It was ok. I think it has potential, but there are way too many flavors in this one dish and I think some of them clash. However, just my opinion, and still was a yummy dish! My friend ordered the mass ave meltdown and he was in pure heaven! Totally recommend this place!! Can't wait to visit again :)Also this place is decorated straight out of pinterest, love it haha!"], ["Holly H.", "Yes to Louie's. This place is amazing. I love the wine options - there are so many! If you can't decide, you can also do a flight, which is a great way to work your way through the wine list. The food is excellent and goes with what you would expect from a wine place. And, if you're not in the mood for wine, their cocktail list is insane as well. So glad Louie's came to Mass Ave!"], ["Molly S.", "We started with the wine (obviously). There are wines for every taste and budget. For those who can't decide, Louie's offers flights of Malbec or Sauvignon Blanc- three small pours for $10. This was a nice option, though I wish they allowed for mix and match of wine styles, rather than three of the same types of wine. If you're dining with the wine-averse, fear not. Louie's offers a rotation of local brews, as well as a cocktail menu and some rather delicious sangria, both red and white.The real winner of Louie's in my opinion is dessert. They say life is short, so eat dessert first, and I'd actually say just skip dinner altogether and just order wine and the divine white chocolate bread pudding. Four people easily shared a HUGE piece of bread pudding that came out with bourbon creme anglaise. At first bite, more than a few expletives were dropped at the table. It was just SO. GOOD. Creamy, flavorful, sweet but not overwhelmingly so...just go order some...you'll get it."], ["Erin S.", "I must've walked by Louie's Wine Dive 20+ times since I moved to Indy and always assumed it was just a wine bar (nothing wrong with that) with a cute wine glass strung lights in the window...

Daniel was great, informative about our wine, food choices, and asked if there were any food allergies without us having to bring it up!Food: I ordered the 4 Pork Gnocchi and it is to DIE FOR, very filling!!! If I could eat that for the rest of my life, I would. Ryan ordered the Coconut Street Noodle with added shrimp and he ate every last bit of food on his plate.

I will definitely be returning next time with a reservation, can't wait to go back!!!"], ["Sam C.", "This was a 5 star experience. The food is to die for and all at a reasonable price. All of the ingredients are fresh and delicious. We ate the pork gnocchi and the fish and chips. Both dishes were spectacular!

We will definitely be back and will have to try the brunch next time! Thanks for a wonderful dining experience."], ["Danny K.", "We met friends here on a whim. We arrived 30 minutes early and they kindly sat us anyway. It is a somewhat busy atmosphere with that trendy modern theme. The 4 pork gnocchi was amazing. Someone else at our table had the crabcakes.

This Mass Avenue destination is above average in all ways."], ["Valerie B.", "Our waiter really knew the menu- both food and bar. The charcuterie board was perfect and the deviled eggs were good. The shrimp diavolo looked boring but tasted amazing! The huge double pork chop was perfectly cooked and topped with awesome caramelized onions. The corn cakes served with it were nothing special and over browned. The fish sandwich, touted by so many reviewers was good but not spectacular. Wine list is extensive and in my opinion very pricey. Lots of cordials- a gem of a place!"], ["Kelsey A.", "Loved the appetizers and half priced bottles when we stopped in on a handlebar tour.

Stepped in on a busy evening and was amazed by the level of service, the prices, the offerings, and how delicious everything was.My husband and I started with the hummus plate- which may sound bland (let's be honest usually hummus sucks!), but this was delicious, they make it in-house and soak the beans etc. Very yummy. Then we ordered a bottle of the Four Graces Pinot Noir - top notch and a reasonable price for such a yummy bottle of vino. Then I ordered the burger and my husband had the steak. We loved everything! And cleaned our plates. We then finished with their take on tiramisu. I cannot wait to go back and try the deviled eggs and the other offerings... everything looked really yummy and their non-pretentious wine style was awesome. The decor is on point and fits right in to Mass Ave. I'm going to have to call this my new fav place."], ["Robyn B.", "So excited to see this place open! \u00a0A city with many beer places needs a place with a wine focus like this. \u00a0(Not to worry beer & cocktail enthusiasts, they have respectable selections in these areas as well!)My 4 stars is for drinks and service ... I'm yet to try the food, but I'm super hopeful after perusing the menu! \u00a0Also excited to try the weekend brunch soon!Will modify when I experience more of this place! \u00a0(Hopefully ASAP!)"], ["Tavia B.", "Just made my first visit to Louie's Wine Dive last night. I thought it had a very nice atmosphere - sort of hip chic (not hipster, just hip). Nice spacious place - I think you could easily bring a group of 20 or more here on a given day. The service was friendly and knowledgeable about the wine. I had a wonderful glass of Mountain Cuvee from Sonoma, CA that was recommended by the bartender. I ordered the pesto chicken flatbread, which was good but nothing special. I'll come back, but mostly for the nice loungy atmosphere and great wine selection."], ["Jessie S.", "There's already a fancy wine bar on Mass Ave., so I was confused why another was going in. Riddle solved - it's not a snooty wine bar! This place serves fresh, hand-crafted cocktails, craft beer and of course, wine. We tried three of their cocktails and loved them - fresh mint, house-infused liquors and no syrups or fake flavors. So fresh and light.The prices were really reasonable, and in fact cheaper than many area competitors ($8 for nice cocktail). The space is open, rustic chic with plenty of tables. It had just opened when we went, so bartenders were still learning the menu, but I can only assume this place will get even better!"], ["Kristy K.", "We stopped into Louie's on their opening weekend for a glass of vino and to check out the place.First, it wasn't that busy, which we great, we got a table right away and the service was spot on for our entire visit.We each had a glass from the chalkboard (that's their thing -- they put bottles that they are service by the glass that day on the chalk board, in addition to a large menu of vino by the glass or bottle. \u00a0Also, if you commit to 2 glasses, they'll pour anything...which means you get to try a glass of interesting wine that wouldn't normally be available outside of a bottle purchase).The menu is interesting, with salads, sammies, some pasta entrees and more. We settled on the deviled eggs and lobster poutine. \u00a0We didn't have time for a full meal, but those apps were great! \u00a0The lobster poutine has a thin seafood gravy -- I might ask for that on the side next time as it seemed to make my fries a bit soggy. \u00a0Otherwise, it was a good sized portion and very tasty.The interior is exposed brick and edison bulbs, so nothing out of the ordinary -- there are some booths, but mostly tables.We will definitely be back to drink more vino!"], ["Christin J.", "Update: I just had to update this review and remove a star. I went in with my husband and we got two entrees: steak and a pork chop. The chop was SO salty I couldn't even eat it and the steak was ok but definitely not cooked medium rare like we ordered. Disappointed, but will stick to sandwiches from now on.This may be one of my favorite new places! I've had two dinners here, the mass ave meltdown and the salmon salad with a humus plate to start. Both meals were so delicious! The meltdown is an eat-with -a-fork cod sandwich on naan bread and it's really decadent. The quinoa salad is an amazing side! With arugula and strawberries it was far more interesting than I imagined, made me glad I resisted the fries. The salmon salad is nice and pretty big for the price point. We'll cooked, nice and spicy, with a greens base. I've been impressed with the staff. While I can tell some of them are still learning, they really do their best to help you learn about the different wines and were so helpful when I brought in my brother (new to the wine scene), recommending things, bringing samples etc. We've already tried some really great wines here.

It's opening weekend, so obviously there are going to be issues. That's understandable.I loved my drinks. I had a Spanish wine (Can't remember the name, let's assume the cheapest one.) and it was incredible. Someone in my party had a pinot noir that was equally impressive.I also had a old fashioned. Cocktails all looked great and had a surprisingly low price tag. We wanted to try the deviled eggs, but they were out. Instead we had the hummus which was tasty, but not really shareable. For an appetizer that seemed strange. I would say that the food needs some work. I had the Mass Ave Meltdown, but it wasn't as full (or melty) as I expected. The \"crispy fries\" weren't crispy. They were pretty soggy. That was disappointing. Our party also had the Gooey Louie and we decided it was pretty bland and not particularly exciting or memorable.Like I said, immediate and major issues were resolved by management. For that reason I'll be back to try again. I'll be sure to give that review as well -- I'm definitely hoping for a positive experience. I'd love for it to be a success."], ["Beth H.", "Stumbled in here on a whim when the restaurant we planned to eat at was closed. Menu was very eclectic and the space was really nice. The first thing to come out was the roasted carrot soup. Oh my, was it delicious. Our party of four were all taking bites. Thankfully, it was a huge bowl. My dad had the Mass Ave Melt and claimed it was one of the best sandwiches he's ever eaten. Chicken pesto flatbread was very good. My 5 year old had the kid's pizza which was also good, but he preferred the carrot soup. I had the gnocchi with pork sauce; it was delicious. I'm a sucker for house made gnocchi and this one delivered. Service was outstanding! Definitely will be going back again!"], ["Monnica L.", "I may have a new favorite. Went with some friends for post theatre drinks. It was packed, but they still managed to seat us quickly. They've made great use of the space and I love the use of upcycled decor.I had two cocktails: Violet Eyes and Italian Bootlegger. Both were good and very reasonably priced. I also had the tiramisu which is big enough to share (couldn't finish it, but it was excellent). \u00a0One of my friends had the chocolate torte and enjoyed it. Two people in our party share a bottle of South African wine and were quite happy with it as well as the deviled eggs (also a large serving).The service was great and very attentive.

Great atmosphere with cool lighting and dynamic seating options2. Super friendly and attentive staff3. A good price point for cocktails ($8) and wine ($7-$12) compared to other places on Mass Ave.They have a pretty thorough wine menu and special limited time options on the chalk board. \u00a0It also looks like they will be having happy hour specials some days of the week, which I'm all about! We ordered lobster poutine and gooey Louie burger to split, along with a couple glasses of wine during our visit. \u00a0The gooey Louie is pretty good. \u00a0It has a nice flavor and it pretty unique. \u00a0I was disappointed in the lobster poutine though. \u00a0It is in a creamy sauce that makes the fries soggy and it lacks much flavor. \u00a0I wouldn't get it again. \u00a0Overall I was disappointed in the food, which is why Louie's Wine Dive only gets 3 stars from me. I'd go back for after work drinks!"], ["Nadia B.", "I've been here twice now. The food is decent. The truffle fries are pretty good. I've gotten the shrimp and arugula salad twice now and although it is good each time they made it differently than described. First time blue cheese instead of goat and second time pears instead of peaches.. It was still good but glad I liked those ingredients. They brought my friend a completely different veggie dish without asking first bc they ran out. I feel like the wine list should be bigger for being a wine dive and not enough tasting /flights. Husbands chocolate torte was ok but tasted thawed from frozen and still took 45 mins to bring out Which Brings me to my main concern. The service. I almost never have a problem with excessively slow service ever except these two times here. Both times it wasn't that busy for a while and got busier later but still not crazy. Both times was waiting at least an hour from ordering main dish, plus like 20 min wait for drinks and 45 mins for apps 45 mins for dessert. Had to put more money in meter. The orders were pretty basic I mean salad and cake? To their defense both times they recognized this and took off my wine off bill. I'd probably give them one more chance but if it happens again it's just not that great of a restaurant to keep waiting for"], ["Allison D.", "The wine list was great but the wine wall was better for the budget. \u00a0Make sure to check out the wall for glasses from the more expensive bottles that have been opened. \u00a0The cheese plate was beyond expectations. \u00a0We also got salads which proved to be way more food than we needed. \u00a0Everything was great. \u00a0I highly recommend it."], ["Brittney M.", "Came to Louie's for a drink with girlfriends after work.

But trips to Louie's on two of the last three Sunday's have been very disappointing. First time there were only two of us and the place wasn't half full. Our service was ridiculously slow! \u00a0They ran out of coffee mugs.....at 11am.....on Sunday....for brunch! \u00a0Gave me a styrofoam cup. I asked about the quiche of the day and the server described it to include 4 or 5 items in the quiche. I ordered it and my friend ordered an omelet. It was at least 30 minutes before, after asking about our orders, the server finally spent 10 mins or so back by the kitchen and came back with food. My quiche might have had 4 or 5 small pieces of mushroom in it.....nothing else. She rarely checked on us and we noticed the patrons at another one of her tables just left, not sure if they paid. I went again today at 2pm with a party of 8......same server, same sparse crowd. \u00a0At 2:25 we finally had drinks and asked server to come back in a couple mins to take our order. 15 mins later we had to look for our server to come back to the table. We all ordered salads and it took 45 mins to get food and during those 45 mins she rarely came to the table and never brought silverware. Overall it took 2 hours and 15 mins to have a salad for lunch on Sunday. I really hope these issues are isolated to this one server as I've enjoyed both the food and service on every other visit except lunch/brunch on Sunday."], ["Kaela V.", "I had really high hopes for this restaurant as it seems to be a very popular new addition to Mass Ave. \u00a0I tried the Grandma's Garden cocktail first which was refreshing and delicious. \u00a0However, overall our group thought the cocktails were hit or miss. \u00a0The restaurant was packed--with tables very close together making for a lively, but loud environment. \u00a0The pork gnocchi dish was outstanding! But portion sizes are small on average, so it is on the expensive side-- definitely not the best value in town."], ["Becky G.", "The concept behind Louie's is really great...you can open any bottle of wine as long as you commit to buying at least 2 glasses (if you have self control and normally only get one glass of wine at dinner, more power to you...however \"committing\" to two glasses of wine is more of a regular occurrence for me). I am not a wine connoisseur but there seemed to be plenty of options to choose from. They didn't have the ros\u00e9 my friend ordered so they gave her a more expensive glass but charged her the original price, which I thought was courteous.We had the hummus appetizer to start out with, it was delicious! They put some pesto on top of the hummus and provide not only pita and bread but vegetables as well. I would definitely recommend this appetizer. I had the gooey louie burger with apples and brie cheese and a side of quinoa. Unfortunately they gave me salad instead of quinoa (I was having two glasses of wine, salad was not going to save me at this point). But I didn't say anything because I was hungry and figured it was the gods telling me to be healthier...so I really can't fault them much for it. My friend had the salmon which she enjoyed as well. There are plenty of other dishes that I would love to try, especially some of the pastas.Overall the service was decent and the food was good.

Went here on a date and food was amazing, as I got the \"Hen over Brick\" but went back recently and they took it off the menu which was upsetting.

I started out with a traditional Bloody Mary which was served with a pickle and an olive. It was very enjoyable, a bit spicy, but that's the best kind in my opinion! I ordered a breakfast pizza. So. Good. Eggs, veggies, sausage and more all on a flatbread gave me everything I wanted. My mother ordered the biscuits and gravy which was also amazing. Looks a bit different from traditional gravy but it definitely hit the spot and is of good size. My boyfriend ordered an omelette, which was delectably creamy. His Cranberry Mimosa was also very tasty, if that's the sort of thing that you're into. The atmosphere was also very pleasing. Modern yet rustic vibes inside with exposed brick and wire with thoughtfully placed unique lighting. The service was great and everyone in the restaurant seemed to have high spirits.

We had the hummus platter as an appetizer, and the Louie Gooey burger and 4 Pork Gnocchi for entrees. Both were well-prepared and flavorful - we especially loved the hummus & rich 4 Pork Gnocchi.

Asking for suggestions didn't really get us to any wines that we liked... we ended up drinking beer (we felt like party poopers). \u00a0For a wine-focused restaurant, the servers did not seem that knowledgeable about the wine they were suggesting.The food was very salty, and was not very memorable. (skip the squeaky cheese... you couldn't even tell they were curds, and the sauce was TGI-Fridays style marinara) \u00a0It is still kinda-new, so we may give it another chance... but, there are so many good restaurants out there, Louie's Wine Dive needs to step it up."], ["Michelle K.", "Delicious! Was so impressed and pleasantly surprised. \u00a0I expected typical bar food....

We went on opening night and everything was excellent! \u00a0We ordered the deviled eggs for an appetizer and they are incredible. Not your average deviled eggs. The chef shared with us that it is his mom's recipe. So sweet! \u00a0For dinner we had the Mass Ave. Meltdown, the Tandoori Salmon, and the Bone In Pork Loin Chop. They were all exceptional and so reasonably priced. Our server was named Jessy and she was extremely attentive. Couldn't ask for more. We also had a bottle of the Laguna Ranch Chardonnay which is an excellent buttery wine, and the Malbec wine flight. We settled on the Leo Premium Malbec which was rich, with hints of oak, and spicy. The ambience is casually comfortable. Very nicely decorated and a great place to kick back and enjoy your company."], ["Andrew S.", "Ordered the enormous bone-in tomahawk steak the first time I went. It was delicious and cooked decently. Some parts were uneven, but that's understandable for such an unwieldy piece of meat.We started with the crab cakes were okay, but a little too bland and had a burnt flavor to them. Probably cooked a little too hot.Good selection of wine and a few decent wine specials. Service wasn't as helpful as I would hope, but it might just be because it's a new restaurant.I'll definitely try to return again on a weekend when they have dinner specials.The open dining room makes it get pretty loud.

They also have a great beer selection - 2 Flat12 beers to choose from.

Menu looks amazing.Great job Louie's!"], ["Amber S.", "I'll split this review into three parts because I like lists: Service, Ambiance, Food/DrinkService: We were told there was a 15-20 minute wait, despite two open tables front and center. In that time, two parties that came in well after we did were seated. When we complained to the hostess, she told us a server had seated her dad out of turn, and the other party being seated was a mistake. She was apologetic, but getting overlooked not once, but twice is unacceptable. Once seated, the server was very sweet but about a B- in attentiveness. Ambiance: The lighting is very cool -- Edison-style and recycled wine bottles. And the use of reclaimed wood is done well. But there seems to be a disconnect between these fixtures and the art/design. The wallpaper, the porch plant hangers (inside)... Just doesn't jive. Food/drink: Good selection of beer, and the infused booze/cocktails are done well and at a solid price point. (I didn't have any wine.) The menu needs work. Not enough veg options that aren't pasta. Speaking of pasta, the ravioli was too chewy. The squeaky cheese tasted like GFS mozzarella sticks. The Mass Ave Meltdown was supposed to be a sandwich but was way too soggy to pick up.Bottom line: I hate to leave negative reviews, but I felt this one was necessary because of the multiple disappointments. Go for after-work drinks at the bar. Skip dinner."], ["Tracy A.", "I've been to Louie's twice now. \u00a0I had dinner on one visit and brunch on another. \u00a0The lyrics to Billy Idol's Rebel Yell just keep coming to my head. \u00a0'With a rebel yell she cried- \"more, more, more\"'.

Nothing to call home about, though. Despite it having \"wine\" in the name, they have some decent liquor behind the bar. I ordered an old fashioned off of their cocktail menu.

Head over heels. Was literally my favorite place to go - and to bring guests new to Indy. The last experience there was awful. & I will not recommend someone to go again. We were quoted an hour wait - went to the bar and got drinks. One bartender amazing. The other seemed pretty cold and rude. We had a couple drinks each. 1:45 min later - still not sat. We asked the hostess nicely what was our wait time - she was rude every time - she had \"no idea\" and blamed on people sitting too long. I've been a hostess, server, and in management. The last thing you do is be rude to your customers -And to blame on the people sitting. You apologize - if it's that long waiting -You offer an app a drink whatever. When leaving the male host said \"have a good night\" - I informed we were leaving as we still had not been sat. He was very apologetic and sweet unlike the woman. Sucks. The last thing you want is good customers leaving unhappy. We have been many times. Hard to consider going back again since there are so many good places with good customer service."], ["Heather T.", "I went here for dinner on a Monday night and the place was decently full. We opted for the patio since it was still nice enough to do so. I ordered a cocktail to start, it was just okay. Nothing that blew me away. My friend liked his gin and tonic. For a starter, we did the charcuterie plate and it was delicious. The bread they bake in house is heavenly! The condiments are also house made, I believe. The mustard had a huuge kick and I loved it.For my entree, I had the pork cheek and my friend had the shrimp. Their wine list is amazing, especially by the glass options! Not as eclectic as it once was. So, now onto my entree. I love pork cheeks. They should be tender, flavorful and glazed in a tasty, luscious sauce. These, however, were not. They were well-seasoned when it came to salt. But flavor was completely lacking, as was quality of texture. They were dry, no sauce was added, and the texture was almost stringy. The components (some greens and something that resembled grits) were also lacking in the flavor department. It was a huge disappointment. Especially for paying almost $20. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't inedible, hence I didn't send it back. But with Bluebeard's reputation you'd think they could execute a good pork cheek.On another note, my friend loved his shrimp. The service was absolutely fantastic. And for dessert we had a slice of Lattice and Lard pie (you can never go wrong there). Overall, sure I'll be back. I think I just chose the wrong entree that night. Maybe I'll go for a drink at the bar or some snacks next time."], ["Zach W.", "As many people will tell you, Bluebeard is one of the few MUSTS in the city of Indianapolis. As in, if you could only eat at one restaurant in the city before leaving or passing away then that meal MUST be at Bluebeard.The dinner is supposed to be amazing but my experiences are all at lunch and I have to say I've been blown away every time and by every dish. If I could recommend a particular dish I would but the menu is constantly changing (daily!) so there is always something new to try.The outdoor dining area, bar, and dining room are all completely charming and service is always fast and beyond pleasant.Eat here soon and save room for dessert if you can (I've never managed too and it's one of my great regrets)"], ["Rich H.", "Last night was the long-awaited visit of Bluebeard. The first thing you need to know is that they don't take reservations. The second thing you need to know is that on a typical weekend night you could wait for a few hours. Last night we were a party of 6 and signed in at 6pm. When your table is ready, they will text/call you on your phone so you can actually leave and come back. We walked across the street to the Hotel Tango bar and had a few drinks. At 8:00 we decided to walk back and check in. Still not ready. The bar area was packed so we waited outside under a heat lamp. Finally at 8:30 (2.5 hours later) we were seated. Great staff, very attentive and super friendly. The wine and cocktail list is pretty expansive so you're likely to find something you like. A couple people ordered Moscow Mules which were extremely heavy on the ginger taste so if you are \"ginger-shy\", skip the mules. Our orders were placed and the salads came out fairly quickly. The fall panzanella salad was good. The person who ordered it sent it back because he thought it was too salty. We asked the chef to taste it and the server said the chef agreed. So, depending on how much you like salt, be aware that the panzanella might not be to your liking.From the time we sat until the time the entrees came out was just over an hour. It was busy, but was a bit surprised that it took that long. Once we did get the food everyone was happy with their meal. Across the table, we tried a variety of dishes. The Barramundi (fish) was cooked very well and had good flavor. The cassareccia (pasta with duck confit) was great but you need to like horseradish or you might not be so happy. The risotto that accompanied the striploin was a table favorite.Finally, we moved onto desserts. I had the vanilla bean chess pie and it was pretty spectacular. It might have been the best part of my evening to be honest. So, all-in-all, Bluebeard is a good restaurant with an interesting and eclectic array of flavors. I really wish they took reservations because that wait is a complete deal-breaker for me. Since the menu changes often, I'd be interested to see what comes next but, for me, it's definitely not worth a 2.5 hour wait. Good food, but just not worth that kind of wait. The space is small so when you have people that want to sit and chat for a while after they're done eating, it really kills the flow and you could be left waiting for hours."], ["John C.", "The service here was really good. Our server didn't needlessly steer us to bigger portions in order to get a bigger tip-I really appreciated that.We were able to try a variety of things so I'll try to describe what I liked and what I didn't like as much. We started off with the $4 portion of grilled bread which was very good-especially the anchovy butter. We also got the $8 size chop salad which was a good size portion to split between 2 people-it was good also. The next courses we got were the grilled shrimp (medium size) on the menu. It came with about 4 good sized grilled shrimp and some puff pastry-we liked this also. The side of spaghetti we ordered come out when we ordered this and it was a bit too salty for our taste. Our main courses were the Striploin and Pappardelle. The Pappardelle was a great pasta dish-not sure if the pasta is made in house but this was one of the stars of the night and I would recommend it. The striploin not so much as it had only like 3 pieces of steak and personally the temperature of the food wasn't as hot as I would like it in comparison to the pasta which came out hot. Maybe it cooled off while letting it rest, but the flavor was just ok too-I wouldn't recommend this. All in all we had a great meal and I think this is very unique restaurant in Indianapolis-mostly all shareable dishes."], ["Ann L.", "At long last, I was finally able to make it to Bluebeard for dinner! \u00a0On a Monday night, the restaurant was still completely full, but we were able to get a table that had just been vacated. \u00a0 The cocktail menu is fun and extensive! \u00a0Our server was really helpful in guiding us through the many choices. \u00a0I had The Verve, which was very good, and as promised, not too sweet. \u00a0 We started with a small order of bread which was served with sauerkraut, garlic and anchovy butters. \u00a0All were wonderful on the grilled Amelia's bread. \u00a0A small order is plenty for two, and maybe even three or four people. \u00a0 We also shared a roasted beet salad which was fresh and delicious! \u00a0 We then each ordered a pasta dish. \u00a0I had the Casareccia which featured duck confit, Brussels sprout leaves and onions in a horseradish Parmesan sauce. \u00a0 Wow, this was such a rich and amazing dish! \u00a0The pasta was clearly fresh; I'm not sure if they make it in house or have a great source, but either way, it was great! \u00a0The flavors in the dish were just fabulous! \u00a0We also shared the roasted cauliflower which was so good! \u00a0Anchovy, capers, and pine nuts with cauliflower that was caramelized to perfection would convert even the most die hard cauliflower hater! \u00a0We split a bread pudding for dessert despite being stuffed!

Food: Bluebeard should be considered the gold standard for farm-to-table Contemporary American cuisine. A delightful ever changing menu based on the best ingredients available (I love that they update the menu online daily). Great variety on the menu without overstretching or sacrificing quality. In addition to being fresh and high quality, the food is interesting and attractively plated. I loved the use of egg whites as the base in which to set the oysters; made a $12 dish look like a $100 dish. Most importantly everything is perfectly executed and delicious. From the amazing cheese and charcuterie plates to the ceviche to the quail to the truffled egg toast I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite. Had three dinners and a lunch here during the past couple of months and not a single dud. From the snacks all the way through dessert (don't miss the chess pie) you are in for a treat. Beverage: Such a perfectly stocked bar; nice selection of craft beers but the star here is the cocktail program. Not a single wasted bottle adorns the beautiful shelves behind the bar; everything is \"top shelf\" and lots of outstanding small batch and less commonly used spirits as well as some house made potions. Bluebeard's version of a Boulevardier (subbing Gran Classico for Campari) is among the best cocktails I have ever consumed; even the glassware is beautiful. The Galapagos is also a must order; a fantastic smoky, spicy riff on a Margarita. The People: Lots of venues have excellent food and beverage, but what makes a venue upper echelon is when the front-of-the-house staff elevates one's overall dining experience. Bluebeard has top notch staff; we especially love sitting up to the bar (you can order off the full menu from there). Erin, Alex and the entire bar staff are such down-to-Earth, wonderful people. Their charisma and warmth combined with the fabulous cuisine and drinks makes for a consistently enjoyable evening.The Ambiance: Such a cool, nicely decorated space with old typewriters, beautiful reclaimed wood tables, a playful method of delivering one's check in an old book that you can inscribe, a lovely courtyard - I wish all restaurants looked this nice and were as warm and comfortable.Value: Generally when I dine at a venue with all the above I expect to spend well over $100 per/person. While Bluebeard is certainly not an inexpensive place, it is a tremendous value for what you receive. Every time I have dined here I have been pleasantly surprised by the final tab. Being in Indianapolis, Bluebeard flies under the national radar during discussions of the country's best restaurants; Bluebeard is not just a great Indianapolis restaurant, this is one of the best venues in the country."], ["Kelsey A.", "Loved this place. The atmosphere of this whole restaurant is awesome. While it was a little chilly to sit outside at the time, that didn't stop many people from enjoying the large outdoor patio they have.

The small option is enough for a filling lunch ($9). Don't dilly dally friends, this salad is on their rotating summer menu. Lastly, how can I not mention the friendly face and service delivered by Jared? I whispered across the table to my boyfriend that Jared is one of those cool looking guys that you want to stand near so you can claim association.

The cheeses have around ten selections and come 3 for $14. \u00a0One minor complaint is that our server didn't mention we could mix the cheese and charcuterie together in our three choices or that you can do 2 and 2 or something similar if you want.For the main part of the meal we shared 2 small and 1 large plate. \u00a0Our small plates were a Tasso ham biscuits and gravy, and a rabbit loin dish. \u00a0The biscuits and gravy with some egg may have been my favorite signs bite of the evening. \u00a0The rabbit loin was very good but maybe just a touch dry. \u00a0For our large plate we got a monkfish dish with vegetables that had a taste you would expect from sushi. \u00a0This was an amazing dish that was maybe just a touch light on the monkfish compared to the veg.We finished the meal off with bread pudding and salted caramel gelato with bacon. \u00a0Both of these were outstanding with the bread pudding being a winner for me. With an ever changing menu prepared by one of the best chefs in the area Bluebeard is a can't miss."], ["Mariam H.", "How I have never written a review about Bluebeard is pretty ridiculous on my part. It's fabulous. The menu always has such a wonderful variety... even for the dairy intolerant and non-meat eater types (usually describes me). My date and I spent a good twenty minutes last night trying to decide what to get. For me it was a toss up between the halibut and the ramen. I went Asian... so typical of me! I've actually had ramen three times at Bluebeard. Some with meat, but this visit it contained egg omelet, pickled carrot, some funky looking mushrooms and a few other tasty things floating around in the broth. It was heaven!!!!! Sometimes ramen gets a little too salty. This version was perfect. The pickled carrot added some sweetness and the mushrooms were oh so tender. Across the table was a giant serving of truffled egg toast. The piece of bread was sky high! Inside of it was a delicious egg with broccoli, mushrooms, fancy-I-dont-remember-the-name cheese and edamame. I should also mention that we ordered the pickled plate for an appetizer. It rivals the one at Black Market, but I still like BM's better as they usually offer up a pickled egg and always pair it with homemade peanut butter. On the pickle plate this event was pickled pineapple, radish, carrot, celery, cucumber and cabbage. The pineapple totally stole the show. In addition to all this yumminess we ordered a side of cauliflower. AMAZING. Bluebeard turns a boring, tasteless veggie into something magical. The anchovy and caper add saltiness. Then there's mint for a hint of sweetness. Pine nuts add crunch. All of it is beautifully toasted, making the cauliflower a bit blackened. Oh, so good.We were talked into dessert by our very patient server (again, we were really slow at every decision). New to the menu was a carrot and parsnip cake. Stellar. I love carrot cakes because they are very dense and it doesn't feel like you are eating air. I also love savory/sweet combos. This cake was checking all my boxes. Suprisingly the portion was rather large, so it was shared.All of this delux dining took place outside on the charming patio with a few Pendennis Club cocktails, Bluebeard's version of an Old Fashioned. I left a little tipsy and most certainly with happy taste buds.P.S. Salads are amazing and are enough to share if you get the larger size."], ["Joanna S.", "I love the look of this spot. Super cool vibe with very friendly wait staff.Because it was my first time, they even gave me a huge baguette to take home!!My only critique is that I thought there was a little too much going on in the turkey and cheese sandwich. I had to scrape the sauce off the bread because the flavor was overpowering.And the side dish that comes with your meal is the \"house side\" that changes daily. It was potato salad when I went. Tasty, but the potatoes weren't as soft as I am used to in potato salad. Not a problem, just a difference.Again, I will be going back to try some of the other awesome items on the menu!"], ["Gillian S.", "This is a not to missed dinning experience.

I realize that there are a ridiculous amount of gourmet dishes in this menu, but I'm obsessed with the bread.It's a little on the pricey side, but fresh ingredients in gourmet cuisine don't come cheap.

We started out with charcuterie of Smoking Goose meats, Amelia's bread, spicy whole grain mustard, and pickles. Very tasty. We also had some great cocktails with house-made sodas. Next up were medium plates of fried green tomatoes (with crab, goat cheese, and delicious sauces) and duck confit. omg. yum. Because we couldn't resist, bread pudding happened. so much yes. I'm so sad I didn't make it here sooner, everything was amazing and the atmosphere was very cool too. We were very very lucky to get a seat at the wine bar on a Friday night.

The spicy giardiniara worked really well with the texture of the crispy bread and ham.The vibe of the place is pretty varied. There's a hipster cocktail feel deep inside, a milder restaurant feel immediately inside, and a casual vibe right outside for outdoor seating. I chose to sit at the bar. Although I didn't drink, the bartender was very knowledgable about the beers and cocktails, although I didn't see any interactions regarding the wine.The staff was very friendly, even though I arrived closer to when they closed. They were clearly busy before I arrived, but the staff clearly cared about their work and keeping the friendly vibe.Ultimately, I highly recommend Bluebeard for lunch.

Menu changes daily, so don't expect to get the same thing every time (except the bread pudding!) a little overpriced but the food is very good. Arguably my favourite restaurant in indy. I suggest the roasted beet salad when available."], ["Ashley R.", "I've only been here for lunch but it was really good! I had the BLT with potato salad as the side. I can't say the BLT was necessarily amazing because it was pretty much a normal BLT, but I could tell the ingredients were high quality and the bread and aioli were really yummy. The potato salad definitely had more apples and broccoli than potato but I loved it and wish I could make it at home. It's perfect as a side because it gives you a nice sweetness to cut the saltiness of the sandwich. \u00a0I also thought the entree was reasonably priced at $10. But the highlight of my meal was definitely dessert (so happy they have the full dessert menu for lunch). I had the buttermilk bread pudding and it was amazing. The whipped cream is incredible and tastes so good with the warm gooey bread insides. \u00a0The dessert is a little pricey especially considering it costs as much as a lunch entree but I think it's worth it. If I could, I'd probably give Bluebeard a 4.5 considering that I haven't tried any of their dinner items which all sound really good. I just wasn't completely wowed by the food (besides dessert) and our waitress wasn't particularly good. \u00a0She awkwardly stood at our table after giving us the checks so I had to hurriedly get my card out which made me feel like she just wanted to get rid of us. I will definitely be back to try more things though and I would still recommend this place to other people."], ["Alicia C.", "If you have somehow scrolled through all two hundred and something reviews of this place, you will know that you just need to go here! Seriously, it is amazing. Amazing food, amazing drinks, amazing setting...Just go already! The outdoor patio is perfect for the warmer months. Lunch specials are the cheaper way to enjoy this place for people on a budget and it is easier to find the free street parking during the daytime as well. I love the little touches that make this place special. The old books used to discreetly pass you your bill, the quaint and quite setting of the trees and lights used to brighten up the patio at night, the cute typewriters as decor, etc. And then there is the food...good lord, no matter what you try, your stomach will thank you.

Bluebeard is one restaurant that has lived up to all the hype that I have heard about it.I came here for a business meeting, and the only negative thing I would have to say is that although our waitress was great and very friendly, sometimes she was very slow and we spent the first 20 minutes sitting in the restaurant wondering where she was so she could take our order.We ordered the bread with the anchovy, garlic and olive oil, and charred onion butter \u00a0dips, Roasted Beet Salad, Ceviche, carrot ginger lemon grass coconut milk and cashew salad soup, ramen bowl, hamachi sashimi, bread pudding, coffee and ginger beer. Everything was pretty great, except the broth for the ramen was a bit salty and the pork loin in it was meh. \u00a0I also really liked the ceviche, which had large scallops, and I generally don't like to eat ceviche!I definitely will be coming back and I'm sad that I can't more often as Bluebeard makes quite a dent in the pocket."], ["Diana C.", "Astonishingly great food. Had expected this to be slightly overrated but as you can see by my 5 stars, this place is just that good!Besides their freshly baked bread and house made ginger beer, the panzanella salad is a must try. It is made with cucumbers, peaches, and chipotle vinaigrette (among other ingredients) and is as refreshing as it is delicious.For sides, the cauliflower was the winner. Nicely spiced and not overpowering. It was a great side to my small entree.Come and eat. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu!!! And trust the servers. They know what they are talking about!"], ["Edward C.", "Has a hipster feel to it. Small restaurant with a good amount of drinks.

Delightful, daring and delicious. \u00a0This quaint, sophisticated restaurant has won my heart over. \u00a0 The ambience is on point, so is the restaurant's missions and it's positive influence on the local community. I wish I took a picture of my dinner, but I was too excited to try my meal... Ain't nobody got time for pics. \u00a0Chips and dips for starters, which were crispy warm housemade potato chips accompanied by a tasty onion dip. It was washed down with heaven in liquid form - the naive melody (gin, honey, orange and lemon). \u00a0I craved for something on the heartier spectrum of the menu so I went with duck confit. \u00a0Yum, it hit the spot! \u00a0The perfectly cooked duck leg had a nice crispy exterior and the meat melted in my mouth. I was more than satisfied and will be back soon!"], ["Chris P.", "Awesome food! Different menu every day and week. Unique entrees that are freshly prepared with much heart and soul. The drinks are signature and unlike anything you'll find mainstream. Deserts are incredible and to die for! Enjoy!!!

If you're still there while it's warm, see if you can catch a little bit of outside dining while the weather is nice although it's also very quite lovely inside. Bluebeard does not take reservations, but the restaurant is pretty huge if you factor in both indoor and outdoor seating. One of the big mysteries of life is how they keep their food so high quality, while serving so many people at once. Perhaps we'll never know.The menu changes everyday, so if you come here often; don't get too attached to the dishes, instead start embracing the change and high quality farm-to-table meals which are best ordered to share. The menu is super cute, being split up into several sections: \"small plates, middle plates and large plates\" along with a section for snacks, cheeses, sides & soups and salads.I started an order off with a roasted beet salad, pickled mackerel and delicious octopus. Each bite was memorable with the octopus arriving first with a flair of a presentation. Decorated with radishes, cucumbers, tobiko, wakame and jalapenos, each bite had a variety of balanced flavors going on. It wasn't overwhelming with one particular one sticking out, but dressed the octopus well which was delicious and fresh.The roasted beet salad was an excellent summer fresh lighter fair. We shared a small portion and thought that it was more than enough to get a nice taste of it. The salad was inventive (something you'll see a lot of here) and delicious. Served with goat cheese, pistachios, fennel, apple and a champagne vinaigrette; it was the perfect summer starter (but hey, it's already Fall!). The pickled mackerel was also delicious: if you're a fan of pickled fish (which I grew up with in Russia), it's a very comforting, simple yet delicious sandwich.My main course was a \"middle plate\" of Udon Ramen which was served with shrimp sausage (something I've never had before), country ham, watermelon radish, napa cabbage, basil, jalapeno and a very intense unami broth. The ramen was done very well, but to nitpick a little I thought the amount of broth : noodle ratio was off. More broth would have been appreciated given the amount of udon in the dish. I didn't think the country ham was a great fit to float around with all the other flavors, but it was a bold choice on the part of the chef. I just thought it added a little bit of too much sodium to an already salty-dish (better to balance it with something less salty, IMO). Nitpicking apart, the broth was incredible with very many flavors. The shrimp sausage was interesting and tasty and the plate was filling.For dessert, we shared half of a french press and ordered the poached pear dumplings. This was phenomenal! It was a pear, wrapped and baked up with a small amount of flavor and a delicious maple-y (not quite sure what it was) top. Think of what you would get on top of a peach cobbler perhaps. The dessert was the perfect finish to a fantastic meal. Indy is lucky to have so many farm-to-table restaurants. Bluebeard needs to be at the top of your list!"], ["Rachael J.", "Exquisite meal, and amazing service from Josh! \u00a0Had charcuterie to start- very generous portions! \u00a0For dinner, I had the Corvina. \u00a0It was perfectly cooked and accompanied by wonderful and earthy root vegetables. \u00a0This was seriously one of the best meals I've had in my entire life. \u00a0I tried the sweet potato gnocchi and pork belly as well, and they were very good as well. \u00a0My entree was the favorite of our table of four- \u00a0I would order it again and again. \u00a0Nice wine and cocktail selection."], ["Karen F.", "We had 6 for dinner tonight and everything was fabulous!

It's certainly impressive for Indy (my standards are low for my hometown). It's in a converted old factory of sorts, and I have to say, they have not used the space efficiently. Given the number of hungry yuppies in need of a cool place to go, they should def have created more space for tables. The food, though, is good. I shared the crab salad, mushroom soup, grilled bread, and chicken with my parents, and we were impressed with all of them. The crab salad was likely the most impressive - well married flavors and ingredients. The chicken is perfectly cooked and comes on a bed of pancetta (if I remember correctly) and kale. Delicious. My mom loved the soup, though I'm not a huge mushroom fan. I would have been more impressed if their ingredients had been local, organic, etc. Perhaps they are, but they certainly don't advertise it, so I doubt. I'd be happy to go back - prices aren't too bad either!"], ["Meade T.", "Wow.

My wife and I came here hungry, thirsty and confused on a snowy evening at the start of a weekend getaway after misunderstanding the local liquor laws. (Having lapped the legal drinking age and halfway back again, being carded, much less refused at a cocktail spot that had been our first stop of the evening was about the last thing we expected. I mean, the child we had in our 30s can drink anywhere in the state if she has her driver's license with her. And we got carded?? We spent the rest of the weekend with our IDs pressed against our foreheads as though we were playing the card game Indian.)Anyway, don't bother going elsewhere for a warmup drink because the bartenders here are superb mixologists and the wine list is creative and smartly priced. The menu changes daily, so not much point detailing the dishes we had, but the vibe is hipster new American gourmet with a deep understanding of protein.

Additionally the menu changes daily so you'll never get bored eating here. They don't take reservations so plan accordingly. I've been here twice before writing this review - once for dinner and once for lunch. While the lunch menu has a more limited selection of cheeses, meats and only sandwiches, the taste is up to par with dinner. The cheese and bread (from Amelia's) is baked fresh and served on an adorable log with a very pairing jam. The fries come in a retro container but have a very strong taste. Dessert menu is the same as dinner time. Dinner portions are split into small, medium and large sizes but are designed for a comfortable full level. The Foie Gras was buttery smooth and the ingredients were fresh and complimentary. The other dishes I tried were phenomenal as well.

If you're lucky, you'll have Josh as a server. He's probably one of the nicest humans on the planet. So typically the bread is the jumping off point. It's served with three different kinds of butters or aiolis and it's consistently great. They make their own bread in house. I've had the spaghetti for a meal multiple times.

Good ambience and decor, and of course the food was excellent. What made the experience even more awesome were the amazing staff!!! (Despite it being crazy devour week.)My wife and I got there around 6:30pm, early for us as we expected some wait. The restaurant was lively and already packed with diners. The lovely lady at the front put our name down and told us about a 45 minute wait time. We decided to check out the bar. We were immediately given a drink menu without asking for it. (Awesome!) The bar area display was fantastic. However, as it was crowded, I couldn't immediately find a way. Nice young man, I believe his name was Nick, noticed us and helped answer all the questions on the drink menu and even placed the order for us. (Awesome!!) We were seated in about 30 min. Just enough time to finish our drinks. Our server, I believe his name was Marx, was great as well. He was friendly and his recommendations were spot on and knew the menu well. Best of all, he didn't try to rush us and took the time to go over the menu. (Awesome!!!)We started with the duck carpaccio. Great display and phenomenal flavor! Meat was juicy and sweet. Perfect combo with the acidic vinaigrette sauce and the sliced basil. Loaded baked potato soup tasted just like it sounds. Loved the couple drops of hot sauce that added the kick to it. For the main course we had pork schnitzel and baked cod dish. Both were excellent as was the dessert.Bluebeard has instantly become one of my favorite restaurants in Indy. We will be back soon for sure!!!"], ["Amanda W.", "This place is stupid good. That's all you need to know. But, since yelp hates short reviews I will say more: I have been here twice. Their cocktails are boozy and amazing. They have a great wine selection and good non-alcoholic beverages if that's how you roll. It's sort of tapas style, so bring some friends, order a ton, and go to town on everything. Make sure to get dessert!"], ["Heather K.", "The staff here are very helpful (and clearly love what they're doing). \u00a0The food is good, but nothing that I would write home about (or a raving Yelp review about)... especially for the price charged for lunch-portion sandwiches and salads."], ["Heather H.", "Excellent service! Our server knew the wines very well & was able to make educated recommendations, which we always appreciate!! The wine list was a nice combination of smaller production wines and respectable, well-known brands. Warm olives, beet salad, roasted cauliflower and Brussels sprouts were all really fantastic. However, my husband found the scallop dish to be a little strange in texture. It was prepared as a spread to go on toast points - creative but just not his favorite version of scallops. The timing of everything was very nice. We didn't feel rushed at all. They prepared a table for us inside when they sensed the rain was coming and escorted us inside before we even felt a drop! Very professional! We will go back!"], ["Michael C.", "Found myself in Indianapolis over the weekend for the Final Four and needed sustenance that fell outside of empty Midwestern carbs. Did a bit of research and came across this gem. What I would say felt more of a neighborhood spot but one that could easily be traveled to from all around the city. 15-20 minute walk from Lucas oil.Food and beverage selection was fantastic. I wish I could have tried more. Service was fantastic, I sat at the back bar where the keeps were engaging, knowledgable and attentive. Atmosphere was great, place was full but not too loud.

Who knew you could pickle pineapple."], ["Sam C.", "We really enjoyed our visit to Bluebeard. This is a classic farm to table place. The cocktails were to die for and the cheese plate was AMAZING.

The atmosphere is classy but unpretentious. The waitstaff give great recommendations. The cocktail list is creative.And of course, the food is incredible. At first glance, the menu seems meat-heavy, but some of the dishes can be made vegetarian. They also don't skimp on creativity when it comes to vegetables. Brussels sprouts with agrodolce sauce = seconds, please. During Devour Downtown they featured a veggie pot pie that was a-mazing.The portions are perfect for sharing, so you get to try a lot of different dishes without feeling like you're stuffing yourself. Speaking of not stuffing yourself, save room for dessert if you can.I recommend planning a leisurely dinner so you can truly savor all of the flavors presented to you. The place can get crowded, but it's absolutely worth the wait."]], "Leonardo's Mexican Food": [["Drew V.", "I tried Leonardo's strictly based upon the reviews found on Yelp. I'm I glad I tried it. It's some of the best food in town. Everything seems to be made in house, even the flour tortillas. Great salsa bar, friendly/efficient staff, and huge amounts of delicious food for not much dinero. I've been back several times over the past couple weeks and have yet to try something that wasn't incredible. Everyone who works here has been incredibly friendly. They answer any questions you might have, always smile, and are just genuinely nice people. The nachos are top notch and enough to feed a family of 2-3 easily. The super fries are the same thing, only with fries instead of chips. My go-to for lunch is the #9, which is two burritos with sides of rice and beans. I usually take the second burrito home and have it for supper, or as a late afternoon snack if I'll be working late. They're HUGE, I would guess about 3/4 to 1lb each, and stuffed with lots of meat, house made guac, and lettuce. They're perfect. Not a lot of extra filler like other places and each ingredient is great by itself. I've had the shredded beef (like tender shredded pot roast), carne asada (best I've ever had), shredded chicken (incredible), adobada (delicious marinated pork), and carnitas (succulent braised pork).They have a salsa bar with about 4 or 5 house made salsas from mild to hot. The salsa verde (green) is my favorite. It has some heat to it, so be careful if you aren't into that type of thing, but the taste is what it's all about. It's garlicky, oniony, creamy, and good heat. \u00a0The restaurant is clean and has plenty of seating, but can be really busy at lunch. You might have to park in the lot behind the restaurant, but there has always been an open table. Again, the staff keep things moving. Orders are taken quickly without being rushed, the food is prepared to order, and someone brings it out to you, all in a short amount of time. To sum it up...I LOVE THIS PLACE!Note to the staff: You all do a fantastic job! Oh, I almost forgot about dessert. Churros! You must order a churro after your meal. Any flavor...trust me on this."], ["Shani J.", "Fast, friendly & fresh - can't beat that combination. I've passed by this place a million times and have always been curious, and this weekend my late night cravings finally got the best of me. I used the drive thru and the friendly voice over the speaker recommended that I try the carne asada torta. My daughter had her mind set on ground beef tacos. I didn't know what to expect, but the torta was HUGE! Usually bigger than I would try to tackle, but...late night cravings, so...Quick, inexpensive, places with GOOD food and drive thrus are pretty hard to find, but this place had moved to the top of my list.

It is embarrassing how many times I have had this for lunch, dinner or a late night snack. I don't think you can beat an authentic Mexican restaurant 24 hour drive thru. The food is always good and the prices are just like any other Mexican restaurant. I would highly suggest this hole in the wall restaurant!

My SO got the steak super nachos. The tacos have a weird fried she'll and the meat was just plain without seasoning. The chicken rolled tacos were pretty decent but again lacked seasoning.

We were skeptical as yelp lead us to a 24 hour Mexican restaurant. We got there around 4am. Second car in line at the drive thru, as a car pulled up behind us we took that as a good sign. We ordered a couple items and pulled around to the window. Once we paid (reasonable pricing) our wait wasn't very long. As we drove back to the hotel the aroma of the food was amazing!

This place is a small Mexican restaurant that shares the parking lot area with Studio Movie Grill. \u00a0The first thing I noticed was the many options on the menu. There were so many things I wanted to try but decided on a burrito/ taco combo. I had my choice of ground beef, shredded beef or chicken -I chose the shredded chicken. I also really wanted some chips and guac so I ordered some. It was after the fact that I found out the chips came with the meal and there was a small salsa bar in the seating area. Next time I'd just get a side of guac instead. The beans and rice were pretty standard and delicious. \u00a0The taco was so-so. The fried she'll was a little too greasy for my taste. The real star was the burrito. It was simple with shredded beef, some onion and some cilantro, but was GOOD. Prices were great, there was a kid menu, and lots of choices to keep it interesting. Definitely worth a try."], ["T.j. K.", "Stopped in here last weekend to grab a quick lunch before seeing a movie. \u00a0Independent Mexican places like this aren't my specialty so I don't know how it compares to other options but over all it was a solid experience.

As for the food: Come hungry! The burritos are pretty huge! The beans and rice portions that come with the entrees aren't huge but are fair; however, that's a good thing as you'll probably not have room for everything considering the size of the entrees!! That said, the beans and rice are pretty tasty! So I often save some of the burrito for later and shovel in the beans and rice! \u00a0:)The best part? It's pretty cheap!!

Thought it's actually lasted at this location longer then most others who had come and gone and wanted to try something new. The first time I went I tried their ground beef burrito, chips and queso and ground beef tostada!! I was insanely impressed with all of the food. The burrito was not only large but was packed to the prim with meat and so flavorful!! The tostada still had a nice crunch without being soggy after sitting. The queso was one of the best I'd ever had with an actual kick behind it and not just being melted cheese. On top of the queso the chips are fried there and though a tad greasy are amazing and add to the feel of the order. My favorite part of all is the salsa bar, my husband and I both tolerate different heats of salsa with mine being more a medium (store bought) and his being more hot, but I wanted to work my way up to the hotter. The mild is more then enough for my medium taste buds!! It's flavorful with just enough kick to make it worth your time, this is no store bought salsa, and my husband enjoyed it as well!!

Back home in San Diego, this dish is my barometer for any new taquerias I visit. So when I saw that a place in Indy had my \"go to\" item, I knew I had to give them a try. First thing I noticed was they use crinkle cut fries. That's always a big no no for me. The best fries are always the regular cut French fries. Not steak cut, not waffle fries, not crinkle cut. Another no no is adding pico de gallo and beans to the dish. There are places in San Diego that do this, too. And those are the places that nobody goes to for fries. Just sayin'. But aside from that, the flavor of the dish was pretty good. The carne asada seemed really chopped up. Almost diced. I'm used to the carne asada having bigger chunks, but it wasn't horrible and didn't affect the taste. Overall it wasn't bad. I've definitely had much worse in the San Francisco area believe it or not. I can't eat carne asada fries all the time, but if I'm in Indy and have a craving I'll definitely stop by here for a modified order of Super Fries."], ["Ashley A.", "This is easily one of my favorite Mexican places on the northwest side of Indy. \u00a0The salsa is homemade and has a great kick to it. \u00a0I definitely recommend the chicken burrito with the spicy cheese sauce"], ["Josh W.", "Leonardo's is my favorite Mexican restaurant, which is saying quite a lot, as Mexican is my favorite food and I'm quite demanding of my Mexican food.

I'm sitting on Michigan Road in Indianapolis, and I could very well be back in Tucson, at one of the good taco shops there.So I've only been once, but I'm so excited about this place that I have to review it now. They do breakfast burritos and serve them all day (again, something that real taco shops do). Burritos are in a good tortilla and served with the red or green salsa (or both). The salsas are actually the only thing that differ from what I used to get in Arizona. Those were the thin, spicy Sonoran style while these are a little more tomato- and cilantro-flavored. That's really the only difference. The interior is actually cleaner and more pleasant (especially the smell, which was almost always bad at the Tucson places). Prices are about what I'd expect. Tacos run $2-3. Burritos $3-5. They also have the quintessential combo plates.And, yes, you should hope that this place stays in business. This is something so novel to Indy that its survival is really questionable. I'm optimistic. In Tucson, these places seemed to average about three per square mile, so I've always assumed that they were not terribly expensive to operate. I'm hoping that this and the other positive reviews on here will give this place its needed boost.

My husband and I have lived on the northwest side of Indianapolis for about five years now and this particular building has been three different restaurants (or vacant!) during this time.Okay - onto the food! We ordered three things: a chile rellanos, a carnitas taco, and three rolled chicken tacos. The three rolled tacos were not worth reordering: while presented beautifully (you can tell that the cooks take pride in what they're serving), they just weren't as good as the other items we ordered. The tortilla wasn't as crisp as I would have liked and the filling was DRY. They're topped with cheese, guacamole, and crema (a delicious version of sour cream) and that helped with the dryness, but I would have preferred some juiciness in the chicken itself. I think this issue could be easily fixed!The Chile Rellanos (there were two in our order - I don't know if that's standard or if we were given extra for some reason) were sooo good. They were served with a large flour tortilla, which is something we'd never experienced before and had my husband swooning. He said it was spicy and hot in the way you always want things to be spicy - hot enough that the heat has your mouth watering, but not too hot that you can't taste the spices. The chile coating was crispy (even after driving home) and the cheese was oozy and delicious. Mike is always in search of the perfect Chile Rellanos and he's sampled hundreds of them - he's got his new go-to favorite, he said, so that's fun. :)My Carnitas Taco was SO GOOD! Something about the way that they fry the meat...I want to go back RIGHT NOW and get another one (which, the beauty of this place is that they're open for breakfast and their drive thru is open 24 hours!!). Meat: tender AND crispy. Onions, tomatoes, and cilantro (mixed up, salsa-like): fresh and flavorful. Tortilla: homemade, flour tortilla - the only issue. It couldn't stand up to the filling and fell apart before I'd finished eating. I would have preferred the more traditional two corn tortilla version and will ask if they offer that the next time we go.Salsas: again, very hot, very flavorful, hit all the right notes for my husband, who likes spicy deliciousness.Guacamole: too spicy for my taste, but heard no complaints from Mike.Crema: one of my favorites.Cheese: appeared to be shredded cheddar. No issues here.Service: We went through the drive thru, but our server was SO NICE - very helpful in explaining their food (which we found to be funny because we're Mexican food junkies and know all about it, but would be great for someone who didn't know what they were ordering!), offering suggestions, and just generally being a cool guy.PLEASE stay in business, Leonardo's!

As can be expected, I got a little burnt out, because we ended up there at least once a week, sometimes twice. That being said, I've traveled their menu extensively. Things I've noticed : When I get a platter of any sort, the beans are almost always lukewarm, but this does not deter me from eating them since they are also flavorful *in that boring refried sort of way. The adobada burrito is the one thing I'd recommend to any meat eater out there. It is consistently divine. The shredded beef burrito is a close second. Chicken tacos are fried and sometimes a bit too greasy. Their quesadillas are gigantic and usually dripping with grease - I recommend this as a shared item/ap and not an entree. The 'half' nachos are very large and more than enough for one person. If you're dining in, get the fish tacos. The horchata here is not great, but I still occasionally get it, because I'm a sucker. The salsas are HOT. The mild can even get me dripping sometimes, depending on the day. The medium/green one is very tasty. If you dine in, you get a little paper basket of tortilla chips. All of our many carry out/drive through orders have been 100% accurate.

I enjoyed each slow forkful closing my eyes and letting the world melt away. I won't say any one good dish is better than another. I won't identify a single thing that stood out. It is the combination of all of the wonderful things that make up Marrow- from the humble logo, to the lighting, the amiance, even the textured wooden walls, to the staff, to the tastes and smells and drinks- that make it what it is. I can not wait to go back there!"], ["Mike K.", "At the end of the meal, and after trying six items from their menu, my wife and I couldn't figure out which was the best because they were all so good, and all so different. The menu focuses on foods and flavors the owners have tried while traveling and brought back to replicate and reinvent, so there's some Jamaican, African, Asian and soul food ingredients throughout the dishes. And wow were they great. We started with the deviled eggs stuffed with crab, ribbons of peppers and ginger and topped with duck crackling and also the crazy fluffy and tender cauliflower hush puppies (incredible chutneys...really). Entrees included Hoisin ribs (perfect sauce, smoky and very sticky) and fried catfish on a bed of Thai greens. Lightly fried and flaky, great combinations of crunch and catfish and just a bit of heat. We also shared a bowl of greens to round out the meal, which had a surprising smokiness to them.We finished our meal sharing Banoffee Fritters, a doughy, crispy plate of goodness that's kind of lightly fried dough balls with a cinnamon dusting and a drizzle of sweet sauces. Very nice, a great dessert to split.Our waitress was really good and seemed to be having a good time, which is always cool. Music was a perfect vibey mix of jazz and reggae and rhythms. Better yet is it isn't too loud, and you can hear each other over the table. Cool, muted nice interior. It will soon be a tough seat to get, very, very good food..."], ["Ann-Marie D.", "Amazing food and cocktails! Great ambiance too! If you haven't been put it at the top of your list.

The service was great and the vibe was great."], ["Andrea C.", "We had a great time at Marrow and everything we tried was delicious! We started with the deviled eggs, pickles and scallops. The scallops were perfectly cooked and seasoned, the pickles delicious, and the deviled eggs were decadent with just the right heat. Our entrees built on our experience. We tried the pork, the fried chicken and the beef stew. We finished with the smoked sweet potato pie (only distraction was it tasted of liquid smoke) and pineapple and lychee crisp. We also sampled several cocktails and beers. Our waitress was fun, not pretentious and really gracious. Great new addition to Fountain Square and worthy of a special night out!"], ["Morgan G.", "Loved my first experience at Marrow. Great, unique menu. My girlfriend and I split a deviled egg each (delicious), the Korean pear salad (spicy delicious), cauliflower hush puppies (yes!), small tandoori chicken (loved!), small vegetable curry. Everything was a larger portion than we anticipated - even with the small plates and everything was amazing. The vegetable curry was my least fav, but still enjoyed. I appreciate that the restaurant takes reservations and allows kids on one side of the restaurant (very few of Indy's really nice restaurants do!). Great service, as well!"], ["Annie S.", "Very relaxing atmosphere, unique, flavorful and delicious food. My fiance and I shared the fried rice and pear salad.

Muted, but comfortable. The menu is touted as global-soul-food and has some terms that I had to look up on my phone. We sat at the bar and were served by three different people, all of whom made us feel welcome and gave us great service. One guy, in particular, puts on a great show when making drinks. For starters, I had the Crispy Okra Salad and my buddy had the Oysters and the Deviled Eggs. All of it was very good. Being vegetarian, I was looking forward to my order of Ma Po Tofu. This was the only disappointing part of the evening. The sauce was so salty, I could not eat it, and I like salt. It was sent back and replaced with the Cauliflower Hush Puppies, which were excellent. My buddy had the Mac and Paneer and the Brisket Chili, which he liked, and, as usual, took half home to his wife. I am okay with the prices and appreciate that they have some small/large pricing. In the end, they comped the tofu dish as well as the cauliflower. Good move. I will try the tofu again, hoping that it has been fixed."], ["Mary V.", "Nice spot to dine on a rainy post Thanksgiving evening. \u00a0Service was attentive but not super knowledgeable about the drinks. \u00a0Food was attractively plated with interesting dishes and the flavors were top-notch. \u00a0Definitely global soul and comfort food! \u00a0The broken rice grits was a take off of Chinese jook or porridge, very creamy and satisfying! \u00a0The char siu ribs were larger and meatier than expected with nice mix of flavors throughout the meat, not just on the surface. \u00a0We also tried the siu mai which came out as our appetizer and a nice portion with an interesting orange paste that we forgot to ask about. To be \"healthy\" we sampled the gail lan with oyster sauce and it was \u00a0a winner as well! \u00a0The most adventurous dish was the oxtail stew with a rice noodle and other meats. \u00a0So full, we had no room to sample dessert...but next time! \u00a0Lots of interesting dishes we will just have to return to try!"], ["Daniel C.", "The shrimp and the smoked ribs are amazing.

Sides are served on ceramic plates. \u00a0Stainless steel utensils. \u00a0Bottled and canned sodas from a cooler up front.The chips served up front were very good, thin, fresh, not too oily, not too salty. \u00a0The dipping salsa that came with the chips was EXCELLENT, fresh, with cilantro, just the right amount of chunkiness, not watery, just the right amount of spice/bite.At first I thought the fajitas were under seasoned, so I added some green hot sauce from a bottle on the table. \"Salsa Brava\", by \"Picamas\" brand, and it was pretty good. \u00a0I'm going to look for it next time groery shopping.But there was sauce in the skillet underneath the chicken, and all I had to do was mix it up, and it made the fajita dish 98.5% PERFECT. \u00a0(1.5% off for the over-done onions/geeen peppers.) So I didn't need to add the bottled sauce after all.The chips/dip, and the entree, with beans and rice was a large portion, enough to fill up a hungry big guy like me. \u00a0Unfortunately, I had also ordered an appetizer of guacamole, that also came with a few chips (not as many as in the basket of chips that was served up front). But it was so good it was worth getting stuffed. \u00a0I polished that off before the entree arrived; \u00a0it was EXCELLENT. \u00a0It was not the usual style of smooth paste-like or creamy guacamole dip that you normally get at Americanized Mexican restaurants. \u00a0This was a chunky style, with chunks of very fresh and just-the-right ripeness avocados, with chunks of fresh tomatoes, and little bits of chopped onions. \u00a0It also had just a \u00a0touch of citrus, either lime or lemon, and just enough creaminess to stick together and stay on the chip.Overall, the food was so good I should have asked the cook to sign my belly with a magic marker!The waitress seemed fluent in English, but wasn't quite attentive enough, \u00a0though they were busy, with both dine-in and carry out customers.The landlord finally re-paved that shopping center. \u00a0No more pot holes!"], ["Jon M.", "Doesn't look like much from the outside.

It is one of the 1st places I ate at when we first moved to Indianapolis. The name has changed but the food and service hasn't(good thing). The chips and salsa are good. I know that is a simple thing, but there are Mexican restaurants that can't get them right. The cheese dip and the cheese and bean dips are good. The large dips are more than 2 people can eat(most people). You can get Margaritas by the pitcher and can pay a small upcharge for a top shelf tequila. They do serve frozen and flavored margaritas. I go through cycles here where I will eat the same dish every time I go, then I will switch to something else. Right now I have been eating the Burrito Guadalajara. It has shrimp, chicken and steak in it. There is a green sauce and cheese sauce topping on it. It is really good and the shrimp in them are a medium to large size. I also like The Shrimp Diablo. It is a little spicy but with the name diablo I would expect my nose to be running by the end of the dish. It tastes great, but don't expect to be begging for water.My wife just gets soft and hard shell tacos. The beef tacos are really good. The are not greasy, they drain the meat well. I usually go with chicken tacos for that reason, but here I will get the beef. you can get them in a hard shell and they wont be soggy.The dessert I usually get is the flan. It is really good and not overly sweet."], ["Terry K.", "This is The best Mexican restaurant we have found. The decor is traditional Mexican and extremely spacious and comfortable seating.

The Texas margarita has 3 kinds of tequila, triple sec, orange juice and fresh lime! Yummmmm. The menu is huge and offers lots of great Mexican dishes. The fajitas as well as the tres amigos are among my favorite dishes. Affordable, clean, authentic, and I always leave with a buzz after just 1 ( maybe 2 ) drinks.

Either way, you've either got a management problem or a staff problem.Typically, I won't deduct stars for bad service, because I try to give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt and not hold them personally responsible for the conduct of all of their employees. But I've been back to this place 6 times now with the exact same bad experience.

The beans and rice are fresh and good. I like the burritos here the best.

My years of Yelping experience has taught me that an establishment with a 4-star rating and 20 reviews (as is Guadalajara at this writing) is as close to a sure bet as one can get. Well, not in this case and I know why - but read on, I'll get to that.To be fair, we were seated adjacent to a large group of high school Spanish students on a lunch field trip. There was over 20 of them with two teachers. We placed our order just ahead of them. One order didn't come out, and when it did it was incorrect. Our waiter argued with my colleague, insisting that he had ordered chicken quesadillas. The three of us insisted that he hadn't, but the server decided his manager had to get involved. He soon appeared at our table and worked it out. The food itself was strictly OK - certainly nothing to rave about. After our mixup, the service was fine.Here's how Yelp let me down: I'm from Texas so for me the bar is set pretty high for Mexican food. Guadalajara's wasn't even close - but maybe for Indy it's just fine. So it's really not the fault of my fellow Yelpers. We all write based on our own experiences. I'll still swear by Yelp ratings - but not for Mexican food in the northern climes. Lesson learned."], ["Richard C.", "Good margaritas, average food, the big problem is if you have a large group.

They took our drink order immediately, got our drinks out quick, then I finished my margarita before anyone came around for our food order. \u00a0If I was with a small group I'm sure i would have rated it 4 or 5 stars, but poor service leads to my 3 star review.
