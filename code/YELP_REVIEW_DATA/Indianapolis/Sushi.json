Cozy atmosphere with a good sized bar to sit when I'm there alone for business. Parking right outside helps too. Sushi has always been great. Very fresh and a great selection of raw and cooked fish. I personally like raw rolls which is always risky in the middle of indiana, but I have always had fresh fish here! I've tried several \u00a0and some of my favorites are Godzilla, Beehive and salmon roll. Service is also great for me. The sushi rolls take a bit to get made, but I always think that's a good sign - they're busy and they're taking their time making a good quality roll! Very friendly staff, too!!"], ["Robert E.", "the service was bad. \u00a0it took the server about 20 minutes before she even spoke to us; then she took the order and disappeared for another 15 minutes. \u00a0Once we got the food it was ok, but we never saw the server again and I had to wave at her to come to the table. \u00a0I've had better sushi at other restaurants with comparable or better prices. \u00a0My son commented on the slow and poor service, as well as the ambiance is very dark. \u00a0Very low lighting with dark wood interior makes the place very dark. \u00a0I would not avoid the restaurant if I was with a group of people who wanted to give it a try, but I wouldn't recommend going if there are other options available. \u00a0I'm sadden to see others have had poor service as well. \u00a0Better service probably would have made up \u00a0for the average food."], ["Brian L.", "Tegry Bistro is a convenient sushi restaurant located close to my work in the Trader's Point area in NW Indianapolis. \u00a0The sushi is decent for the Midwest, but I've been spoiled by sushi in CA. \u00a0The lunch combo (miso soup + salad + sushi) is a good deal. \u00a0Tips: \u00a0Arrive early if you are short on time. \u00a0All 3 times I've been here, service was fast UNTIL the lunch rush. \u00a0Once the rush came, the service quickly went downhill, with the servers forgetting to refill drinks, bring the check, etc. \u00a0I've only been here during lunch, so maybe the service is better in the evening where everyone doesn't arrive at the same time."], ["Lauren D.", "Can't wait to be back in Indy for Thanksgiving and enjoying Tegry over the vacation.

Cold outside and warm inside.Chicken had a weird texture and was barely warm. The sauce was good and i liked the addition of shredded cabbage. Enough sauce to mix in with riceRice puck was kind of dry3 little carrots were dry, 1 small broccoli floweret was fresh and a slice of squash3 orange slices were dry as well but maybe oranges this week were poor from the farmersStaff were very nice and offered nice serviceMaybe it was an off night and the chefs had the teenagers cook in the back or i am jaded by having too many japanese restaurants in toronto, but i was really looking forward to deliciousnessI also become worried when i see a lot of salmon and spicy tuna on the menu.

It took many samplings at many sushi restaurants all over Indy but it doesn't get much better than Tegrity Bistro. My girlfriend and I are west coasters and we've found that we have pretty high standards when it comes to fresh fish. We've found that most \"sushi\" restaurants have fish that either tastes fishy or tastes like they have just been thawed. If you get cooked rolls then you won't be able to tell because cooking/frying masks it.You can tell how authentic a sushi restaurant is by looking at the ginger they serve. If it is pink it is manufactured. If it is yellow then it is hand-prepared which is hard to do (trust me I've tried). They serve yellow, hand-prepared ginger here.Ambiance: This place is private, dimly lit, and intimate. It is perfect for a romantic date.Service: Friendly but not overbearing which fits well with the ambiance here.Overall: If you're into real sushi (raw and fresh fish) then this place is for you. Be warned though, it will be delicious and you will most likely be spending $60 on dinner for two. Good thing is after dinner you can hop over next door to Shokolad for some delicious chocolate and gelato"], ["Jordan K.", "The overall ambiance and customer service was slightly above average. We enjoyed the ginger salad they brought at the beginning of our visit. The miso soup that accompanied it was rather terrible. No flavor at all, just tasted like pond water.We tried the Godzilla roll and gyoza. The gyoza was alright, not anything special, fairly standard. The sushi was ok, it was sized well (not too large). Overall it didn't taste very fresh.We also had the NY Steak over noodles. It was cooked medium which was nice. However for $21 the cut of meat seemed really overpriced.

It's definitely tucked back in the little plaza area in front of the movie theater. Also, not what I expected on the inside. It looked like an older, worn in type of restaurant and there was some light jazz playing. The hostess seated me in a booth and I was greeted by our server quickly. They gave us two sushi menus and one regular menu. I liked the idea of the laminated sushi menus with the dry erase marker. Way to cut down on paper! I opted for the bento box with teriyaki chicken and the spicy tuna roll. My client got two rolls, the Las Vegas roll and the Mexican roll. I thought my lunch was great, perfect amount and she let me try her Las Vegas roll and it was wonderful.

I sat at the bar and so I can't say much about service except that it was what I would expect if I was virtually the only patron. I didn't even look at the full menu because I knew I wanted sushi.The man who made my sushi was very friendly. I ordered 2 nigiri (young yellowtail and sweet shrimp). Each order of nigiri comes w/ 2 pieces (many places only give one). I also ordered the dynamite roll (smoked salmon wrapped in rice and seaweed; spicy tuna on top; spicy sauce and korean chili paste on top of that). it looked good and tasted great. I can always use a little more spice though (i think that's why they give you wasabi on the side). I just got a coke to drink since it was lunch time (total bill + 15% tip = $25). If I was there for dinner I would have tried one of their many sake wines displayed at the bar.The ambience of the restaurant as a whole is pretty good. I sat at the bar, and there's a TV at the top of the bar that seems to clash with everything else, but to be fair it was on mute. Plus it did gave me something to look at since I was there alone. It's kinda hard to believe this place is in Indianapolis. Next time I'm out running errands in this area I will definitely go back, hopefully for dinner, and if you're in the mood for sushi I don't think you'll find any better anywhere else in Metro Indy.*this is an update to the above* I have been coming here for my sushi for a few years now (to the point where I've been given complimentary food not on the menu!). I still contest that it's the best sushi in Indy and the service is always prompt and cordial. It's fresh, tastes great, and although not simple is not overfancified (I know, not a word) either. I go to some \"upscale\" sushi places like Sensu downtown or many in Chicago and to me it's hard to call what they serve sushi, but I think Tegry Bistro has hit the perfect medium. I'm moving away from Indy and this is truly a place I will miss coming to.

We sat in a booth for about 20 minutes without seeing a server.

They brought us menus and some water. After this one mishap after another unfolded. The waitress seemed especially flustered and hurried. She snapped at us that they were understaffed that night. She brought us the wrong glasses of wine and didn't bother to bring us the glasses we did order. When placing our order, my friend tried to clarify the dish she wanted to order, and pointed to it on the page. The waitress repeated the order to us incorrectly; we corrected her gently, she snatched up the menus and hurried away. When she brought out our orders, my order was missing a few items. She said, \"Well do you want me to put it in? It'll definitely take a while.\" Since we were now in a bit of a time crunch to get to a movie, I declined. She then brought out the incorrect order for my friend, and when notified of the error, she said, \"No that's what you ordered.\" Again, we declined to have them redo our order since there was a bit of a time issue getting out of the restaurant. THe food was decent, although not the food we actually ordered. I was pretty surprised at how bad the service was; after all of these mistakes she tossed down our bill without an apology, an offer to comp like, one drink, an offer to split the difference of an item that my friend did not even order, or an appearance from the manager. Other reviews suggest that our experience was not an isolated event, though perhaps a bit worse than normal. Unfortunate, as this is a restaurant that seems to have potential and would return in the future if it were not for this exceptionally bad experience."], ["Brad O.", "Cherry Blossom roll rocked my world today!

That should actually be my bumper sticker. I actually eat it at least 3 or 4 times a week. Tegry has been a favorite lately. Tegry shares a menu with its sister restaurant iSushi on 116th street in Carmel. The sushi here whether it is a maki, nigiri or sashimi is always fresh and flavorful. I've eaten so many rolls here I wouldn't even know where to begin. My favorites are the Crunch Spicy Tuna, Cherry Blossom, Godzilla, Rock Star Hey wait a minute everything is great. I have never had a bad roll here. The nigiri has been excellent and I eat it all. from raw diver scallops to shrimp heads to Uni. It is always fresh and Delicious. When I go for sushi I usually like sashimi. The prices kinda hinder it here. 1 order jumps from $4-$5 for nigiri to $14-$15 for sashimi, so I guess I'll eat the rice. The rolls are small here thus I order more it does get expensive at times because you keep ordering to get full. The Udons are great as well. I love it here but I can't seem to leave without dropping $150-$200 every time I go here with my wife and young children (12,11,8 &7). If you don't mind the premiums this place is great I took 1 star for quantity and price but the flavor is definitely 5 star."], ["Patrick G.", "Really nice atmosphere, staff was very friendly and some of the best sushi I've had."], ["Adam L.", "My family and I went to Tegry for dinner about a week ago. Wow, what a place. It's a classy establishment, so no shorts and flip flops here. We got the gyoza and seared steak appetizers. Both were excellent.

If you're on someone else's tab and looking for top notch sushi, this is the place to go."], ["h s.", "Fish is ok quality, but at a ridiculous price and served in tiny portions. We ordered chirashi, and it was eensy: six pieces of sashimi, a piddly scoop of rice, and priced at 22 dollars. When the server asked the owner if we could have soup and salad with it, he quickly shook his head no. We also had seaweed salad which was underseasoned and just meh. We left hungry 70 dollars later. \u00a0The server asked our thoughts, and when we said that the food was mostly good but the portions were small for the price, the look on his face said that he hears this complaint regularly.We're well aware that quality fish is expensive, especially in Indianapolis, so we're happy to pay for good sushi. \u00a0But Tegry's management seems uninterested in customer satisfaction or figuring out how to set fair prices, and cuts corners in the process (dirty plates, nubs of leftover soy-soaked rice on the menus). \u00a0You can get some ok sashimi here, but you'll pay dearly for doll-sized portions."], ["Russ C.", "Excellent sushi. \u00a0The dyamite roll is dyn-o-mite (spicy tuna wrapped in tuna with chili sauce and spicy sauce drizzled on top). \u00a0The Tegry Special is incredible: 10 sashimi, 10 nigiri, dynamite roll, salad, and miso soup for $25.99 (Consider splitting...it is ridiculously large). \u00a0The salad is delicious. \u00a0Miso soup is very good and not fishy. \u00a0Filet mignon was allright, a little gristly, but about what you expect for $20. \u00a0Service is SLOW and INATTENTIVE. \u00a0Salad and soup (which comes with all meals so should be ready to go) took 10 minutes to come out. \u00a0I ran out of water and didn't even see the waitress for another 10 minutes. She didn't even ask if I wanted another beer (hello, this is the only way you'll make more money, since I'm not tipping over 15% -- or, just have good service AND ask if I want another drink and you get 20% of the increased total :). \u00a0For a $60 dinner I would expect better service. \u00a0Minus one star for service and minus one for value."]], "Bento Asian Bistro": [["Linda L.", "I LOVE bento boxes!

It was in a soy wrapper and had a great mix of avocado, and salmon, tuna, and yellow tail.I got it Togo, and they packed everything perfectly with enough sauces for the meal.The only reason why this wouldn't be a 5 is that the rice had a little bit of a bite to it. So either it was prepared ahead of time or the rice was slightly undercooked. I want to come back and try their bubble teas!"], ["Raechel A.", "Hey, hey, hey! Whaddya say? Bento box cafe! Right down the way.It's Friday and I'm rhyming. Get over it. Bottom line, I'm super stoked that I found this place because they have my Dragon roll WITH sides for only $10. Um yeah, I'm definitely a fan.I typically bring my lunch to work, but one day I forgot it. That gave me the opportunity to search out a lunch spot nearby. Sushi was on my mind for a while, so I hopped on Yelp to find me some. I've been to a couple sushi places downtown, but I haven't been to the Bento Asian Bistro yet. As I looked at the online menu, I was happy to discover a bento box with sushi as well as some really yummy-looking bubble teas. Oh yeah, I'm there.It's a small cafe-style restaurant in the corner of the Indiana Street plaza, near the Noodles & Co. The interior is quite nice with plush, leather seating, chairs, booths and bar seating on the back wall. The menu is fairly simple, nothing like that thing you have to read at a typical Chinese restaurant. My order took about 10 minutes to come out, and it was lovely! The bento box consisted of the sushi roll, a ginger salad, a spring roll and a crab wonton in some duck sauce, and a little pickled ginger and wasabi on the side. I gobbled it all up like it was going out of style! My Dragon roll and the salad were very good. The warm spring roll and crab wonton in duck sauce was so good! I wanted to get more, but there's a $5 limit for cards and I don't carry cash. Oh well, maybe next time.I also didn't get a chance to try the bubble tea, but they have many flavors and boba options. Regular bubble tea with tapioca boba, red tea with pop boba, and green tea with fruit jelly. I'm going to try the milk tea or the coconut tea with tapioca pearls. LOVE those! Not a fan of the fruity ones. They also serve smoothies and coffee slushies. Sounds interesting. I wish I knew about this place when I was in college because I think it's a really great addition for students and downtown workers to go for an affordable sushi lunch. I'll definitely be back for some more sushi and some bubble tea. Oh wait, I don't have to go back because...they deliver!"], ["Jake D.", "Stop, wait, turn around. Put down the phone / Don't go here.

I would have eaten anything, but I decided to try a new place: Bento Asian Bistro.Bad decision. I called for carry out and they told me it was a 10 minute wait. It had been about 15 or 20 by the time that I had gotten to the restaurant and I still had to wait 10 minutes more.I ordered General Tso and hated it. I didn't finish half of it, throwing away the rest. Rice was bland, chicken was awful. The place seemed full - plenty of people were seated and eating. I'm so confused as to why. Never again. =/"], ["Jim M.", "Quick Asian food - red tea with passion was very refreshing and the yaki-udon shrimp was better than expected but the shrimp were just a tad too done."], ["Zenobia W.", "The idea of this place is very appealing, but l can't see myself returning. Cheap, quick sushi and boba? Sure! But the execution of their food is sub-par at most. The non-sushi food options are pretty much comparable to your average Americanized Chinese restaurant. Very oily and often deep-fried, followed by that joyously inevitable belly ache. I'm a frequent buyer of boba elsewhere, and that was probably the only decent thing I had here. Decent, not great though. Nothing felt fresh and there weren't any distinct Asian flavors.Side note: I don't know if it was OrderUp's problem or Bento, but the delivery experience wasn't the best. Maybe the guy was new? I had ordered to have something to be delivered to work, because I couldn't get away for a break and it took over an hour (which I was willing to brush aside). But when the delivery guy finally showed up, he said I had to come down to grab my stuff and I said I couldn't because of work (the whole point in ordering online)... Then he argued with me on the phone and hung up, so I ended up having to run outside on Monument Circle to look for him and get my food... Yikes. :/"], ["Nicole L.", "Fun, trendy, great food.This is a good addition to the developing complex of restaurants near IUPUI.I haven't tried the sushi yet, but did get a chicken teriyaki bento box that was excellent.The service was great, the prices were reasonable, and if you're a student they accept jag as currency."], ["Cammie W.", "I don't have a strong opinion about their food yet but I definitely prefer their rice over Sushi Boss' rice a few doors down. It's cheaper than Marsh's sushi for what you get. However, I wouldn't recommend this place over Marsh yet. I still suggest giving it a chance.They have a lot of different bento boxes to choose from. You're not limited to just Japanese style cooked meats; they have choices from other Asian cuisines as well. I wish there were more options without the cream cheese wonton, though. They also have \"Special Roll Bento Boxes\" which comes with a salad, an egg roll, and a cream cheese wonton. You can get just the roll without any of the sides for $2 cheaper. There is also an Indianapolis Roll, which I would have gotten if it didn't contain cream cheese and the entire roll wasn't fried (figures).I ordered a Thai Iced Tea with Boba. It had too much cream/milk in it and there was no detectable tea flavor at all. The boba was a tad bit too mushy on the outside, but still decent. I haven't had better boba since I got to Indiana so I don't know if that's just how people prefer it here.I got my roll To Go. They placed it in a nice plastic sushi container in a gigantic paper bag. They stapled the paper bag together with a menu and another copy of the receipt. Then they placed everything into a plastic bag. The environmentally conscious side of me thinks that's a bit too excessive but they did make it look nice & neat. I also walked from the restaurant and at no point was I worried about my roll getting messed up.I ordered the Manhattan Roll which has shrimp tempura and avocado on the inside and spicy tuna on the top (along with 2 sauces). My roll was made fresh but the tempura was old and a little bit mushy. The spicy tuna was not spicy at all and too warm. I walked maybe 3-4 minutes to my destination in 50 degree weather so the tuna should not have been anywhere close to as warm as it was.The cashier that helped me was super nice. I definitely want to come again and try their regular bento boxes. I'm also interested in how their Pad Thai is, but the picture on the menu isn't the most appealing."], ["Jade C.", "Calm down on the soy sauce!Whatever you do, do NOT get the chicken basil bento combo.

Well probably not their fault! I first went to this place a few days after it opened. Matter of fact I like how the service was courteous and efficient. This is a medium sized place that opened where previously Einstein bro bagels was. The whole idea of Asian fusion is having all major Asian food types under one roof in one bento box! It's actually very clever especially if you are selling Asian food in an area where you already have 4 places that serve Asian food. However now comes the part where it makes me give them 3 stars. It's the idea of fusion that's excellent, the food however is pretty average.I have had almost all their bento combinations. It's decent as long as it's warm like any other Chinese entree. The sushi is actually very average. I was very excited initially but now I'd much rather avoid the fusion and stick with the culture I'm craving the most.

My other friend got the sushi be to box with salmon and that was great!! We also ordered some dumplings for the table and everyone loved them, ideally suggest trying them. They are very filling.

We were recommended this place from friends who lived in the area who said it was amazing and cheap for sushi. We were warned ahead of time that it was a old pizza hut...not sure what that meant, until we got there. When we arrived, it looked like you would get food poisoning for sure...but i can say, we definitely did not! We walked in and had a substantial wait. I wasn't too mad because the venue is small and there were several groups of about 6-8 people. My group was 5 people (1 additional but he ended up going across the street to mcdonalds). Since they don't have a lot of space and its all you can eat, I hung on and dealt with the wait. It was a saturday anyways. Once we were sat we were given the laminated sushi menus to order. Me and my friend are into the fancy and dare i say elite rolls, the other 3 are your sushi 101 people who like the miso soup and california type rolls. So we split the paper up like that. When the waitress came, we gave her both sheets and she combined them. We noticed she had interesting math. Me and my friend ordered 1 alaska roll, the other 3 ordered 3 combined...so a total of 4. She wrote down 6. Well then...apparently I was wrong that 1+3=6 not 4...oh well they weren't big rolls. We ordered quite a spread of stuff between soup and appetizers and rolls. Then waited. Some of the appetizers came out but not all. We assumed that they were coming out as they were prepared. Then the fancy rolls came out and just a few of the basic rolls the other 3 ordered. We assumed stuff was still coming in waves. So we ate, then asked where the rest of the order was because the wait was becoming a little long. We were then informed that they must have missed it and the sheets had been wiped off. They asked what was ordered and they would get that in right away. One of the party members asked for the dirty broth soup or something like that, we were told that they were all out of the soup. Oh ok so we just dealt with it and began to fill out our next form knowing to do it all on 1 sheet this time. Out of curiousity we put 1 of the soup (even thought they said they were out), as well as a few items that we never got from the appetizers. Submitted the order and guests what happened...we got the soup! OK so we were mis informed. the second round of food came out and we were still missing several items ordered before. Learning our lesson, we just filled out a 3rd form and submitted it. Then was waited for the missing items...they never came...so we asked a man walking around and he said it was lost...seriously?! AGAIN?!Finally we got the missing appetizer that we were really curious about. It was some kind of egg/spring roll. It was disgusting. I bit into it and oil came rushing out. I squeezed it and filled my plate with oil. The sushi we got was actually pretty good which was a plus especially for all you can eat. However I am not sure if we even got all that we ordered because it was amazing how many times they would miss items on the order. Overall totally mixed on my thoughts on this place.

The rolls were very decent but again were not signature chef material. The appetizers are great but you need to decide whether you want your belly full before trying all the sushi. They have a rule that if you have more than 3 pieces left on your plate they won't serve more. The service is hit or miss probably because it can get very busy.

One of the servers has a grating loud voice and doesn't give very good service. The other server was very attentive, quick, and polite. Despite the booths being uncomfortable, the restaurant was very clean. The singing Bass fish above the register are a nice touch. Most of the other customers seemed to be getting the 2-rolls or 3-rolls lunch specials which include soup and I think a small appetizer. The food was really good. The All-You-Can-Eat menu is $19.99 Mon-Thurs and $21.99 Fri-Sun. Included with the AYCE sushi is your choice of appetizers, soups, salads, and specialty, cooked, and raw rolls, nigiri, and sashimi. I started with Miso Soup which was flavorful and good. I ordered a specialty roll (Magic Castle=spicy something fish with cream cheese, fried, topped with spicy something else), 2 pieces of squid nigiri (ika), and a Philly Roll (smoked salmon and cream cheese) to start. I usually steer clear of fried rolls and anything with excess sauce but I'm glad I tried this one, as it was quite tasty. Ika was delicious and fresh and I ordered it with my next 2 orders too. The specialty rolls are full-sized whereas the regular rolls are just 3 pieces. Nigiri and sashimi are ordered as singles. My 2nd order was another Philly Roll (3 pieces), and Eel Roll (3 pieces), Eel Nigiri, and Squid Sashimi (no rice). Round 3 was just nigiri: ika, white tuna, smoked salmon, tuna. Yum yum yum. I definitely got my money's worth. I had thought \"Oh, the rolls will only have a little bit of fish in them, and the fish slices will be ridiculously thin,\" but this wasn't the case at all. The fish slices weren't great hulking chunks but were the right size to be a bite. For the money, I think this has become my favorite sushi place in Indy. $23.97 was my grand total, I think.

Just be prepared that if you only order 1 piece...the piece of fish will probably be as big as your thumb nail.Most of the rolls we had were good - not too much rice and the fish on it was pretty good for an all you can eat place.Only complaint is that we ordered 2 soft shell crab rolls in the beginning of our meal and wanted to order another 2 at the end of the meal but they told us they ran out...but my intuition told me that might have been a lie...and I swear to god i later saw another table receive a soft shell crab roll over 30 minutes after they told us it was out. Disappointed us that we felt \"cut off\". So advice to all, order that soft shell crab roll early if you want more than 2 orders.Overall, great addition to Indy and would come again with a good healthy appetite!"], ["Sarah C.", "Not all wonderful things come in glamorous boxes. Okay - now apply this analogy to Sushi Club. From the looks of it, you might be a little uneasy even getting out of your car. Listen now, I'm a small girl so I'm always on the lookout for what's in my surroundings. This place was highly recommended, though, so I had to give it a try. Plus I love sushi!As soon as we walked inside my friend and I concluded that the restaurant used to be a Pizza Hut. Without a doubt. (Later on we found out our suspicions were spot on.) Regardless, we were ready to try the food! We got an order of edamame and it was delicious. So delicious. I decided to go for one of the crunchy crab rolls and was very, very pleased. My friend was super happy with her choice as well. Ok, Sushi Club, you were a success! Folks, don't judge a book by its cover when it comes to this one. Great price for great sushi.

It looks like a hole in the wall, but it's usually the best places to go. I always try to come here during their lunch hour. I usually get their pick two of three sushi. You can get sushi here during lunch for about $10! That's the best price you'll find. I like their soup and salad. Overall, this is one of my favorite places to get sushi."], ["Jon C.", "I'm a big fan of sushi, so when I heard there was a place on the west side offering a wide variety of sushi - ALL YOU CAN EAT - I was there.The decor isn't much, like the other reviews mentioned. I arrived around 6:30 in the evening and didn't have a wait; however, by the time I was done, people were waiting for a table to open up.The draw to this place has to be the all you can eat sushi. For about $23, you get to choose between three pages of soups, salads, rolls, and various pieces of fish. If you know you like sushi, this is a great way to have your favorites but venture out and try something new too.It should be noted that if you aren't in an \"all you can eat\" mood, Sushi Club also offers a regular menu with the all you can eat selections on it, plus more. My dinner companion did this and was very happy with her roll.I went with the salmon and tuna - two of my favorites - and also tried two of the 8-piece rolls and two of the 4-piece rolls along with the miso soup. The soup came out very quickly, as did my green tea (and the refills were prompt, although not as hot as I would have liked). The soup was the perfect temperature and flavor. After the soup, there was a bit of a wait while the chefs prepared our meal. Even though there were a number of chefs preparing the entrees, the delay was noticeable. When our food came out, it looked wonderful, and the delay was all but a distant memory. I'm a very finicky sushi eater, but this tasted great. The tuna and salmon were fresh, the rolls were nice and tight, and there wasn't a piece of sushi left, which was a good thing. According to the menu, you can order as much as you like, but if you leave 7 or more pieces, you're going to pay $1 per piece for wasting it. I'll definitely be back to try several things that sounded great, like the Broadway and Colt roll very soon. I'll also make sure that I bring someone new to experience this hidden gem!"], ["Korey A.", "We went here with a group of 6 while visiting friends in Avon. \u00a0The next time we came back to Avon, we had to go back again. \u00a0For an all-you-can-eat sushi, this place rocks! \u00a0No buffet, just straight up ordering off the menu. \u00a0Don't order too much though, because you have to pay $1 per piece that you don't eat over 7 pieces. \u00a0It's best to go with a large group so that you get to try everything. \u00a0Make sure you have an empty stomach so you can try it all. \u00a0Skip the shrimp tempura (the flakes fall off and it's not very flavorful). \u00a0Other than that, everything we had was great. \u00a0I think after two visits, we have tried just about every specialty roll on the menu. \u00a0Everyone has their preference, but nothing was bad."], ["Charla C.", "I checked out Sushi Club after reading about it here on Yelp and the reviews are right on.

My boyfriend and I ate plenty and left totally stuffed and satisfied. Usually all you can eat style sushi has limited options or poor quality options. Not at Sushi Club. The all you can eat sushi is made to order, taste fresh, and looks beautiful.I also love coming to Sushi Club for lunch. I always get the 2 or 3 roll lunch special which includes salad and soup. Perfect amount for lunch at a great price point of either $8 or $10. Sushi Club is my favorite place to get sushi in Indianapolis for the quality and value. I just can't give it the full 5 stars because all the other sushi restaurants in town offer a dining experience Sushi Club can't match.^^^^^^^^^^^ yea....

I was hessitant as I'm sure most first time visitors of Sushi Club are/were but as soon as the food started rolling out all my worries went by the wayside.Here is a bullet list of a few things I learned during my first visit.-Get here early! We came for a early dinner on a Saturday (around 5:30) and the place was already 90% full. Lots a large groups come through here and they could definitley use another server.-Veg Friendly! We decided to go with the All You Can Eat sushi and some of our favs of the night came from the veggie menu.-Drinks-Soda in a can..no more to say.-Food-This isnt the most innovative unique sushi/sahimi spot and I dont count on seeing some rare or crazy items on the menu. What they do do is your traditional sushi/nigiri/sashimi/rolls right. No huge WOWS but just alot of decent food.-Menu. If you decide to do the AYCE sushi, make sure to ask for another menu to look over after submitting your first menu. I would definitley reccomend ordering alot of items on your first round.-Location. Its a hole in the wall..Who cares?!?!-Overall. Sushi Club is now added to my roster for go to sushi spots...especially when I'm in the mood for ALOT of sushi!"], ["Nic J.", "I love Sushi Club. While I have had better sushi, the fact that I can eat sushi until I burst for twenty bucks makes me really happy.

The all you can eat special is incredible, with endless soups, appretizers, sushi a la carte, raw, cooked and special rolls for your enjoyment. What nice is that you can have little nibbles of the appetizers (ex: 2 pieces crab rangoon vs. 8) so you can try whatever you want without getting filled up too quickly. Everything we ate was delicious. The service was very good, appetizers came out quickly and the sushi that followed was served in a timely manner.

The only one I didn't try was one with jalapeno in it, because well, I knew I wouldn't like that one...all rolls, raw or cooked were sooo good! Oh, and the appetizers as well!We went a second time and it was just as good as the first. The staff is so friendly and want you to make sure you eat as much as you want!

By the time we left Ocean World had just opened for lunch so we decided to give it a shot based on Yelp reviews. The restaurant has a large interior to our surprise with seating to accommodate one to several large parties. The sushi bar seats 8 if you prefer watching the chefs in action. They also have a very nice deck area, if weather permits, or if they have a server working the deck. We tried to take advantage of the beautiful fall day and sit on the deck but were told it wasn't open.Our server was friendly and didn't rush us since it was our first time. However, once it became busy the service was slower as one would expect. \u00a0We were unsure if this was typical lunch service or just allowing us time to make our decision. \u00a0The lunch crowd appeared to consist of many regulars since the servers greeted several around us by name. By 1:00 pm the restaurant was packed with groups of 1-10. The lunch menu was much larger than expected and prices were reasonable. The lunch selection was a pleasant surprise of appetizers, 15 types of rolls, 4 lunch boxes ranging from $9 - $12, 2 salads, pastas and noodle dishes to full entrees. If you're allergic to fish there are a couple options but many of the items are prepared or served in fish broth. The two salads options were very popular which were 1) Seafood with calamari & 2) Shrimp or Sashimi with fresh slices of tuna, salmon, white fish and shrimp are served on a bed of lettuce. \u00a0The lunch box portions are deceiving unless you're a big eater with 4 options from California Roll and Tempura or Teriyaki ($8.95) to options of Sushi, Sashimi or Tempura with Shrimp, Chicken or Beef Teriyaki ($11.95) each served with miso soup, rice and salad. A Veggie Tempura is available as well. The Wasabi Shumai ($4.95) is 6 steamed dumplings flavored with Wasabi broth. They were delicious and a big hit especially if you enjoy Wasabi. The Wasabi flavor doesn't overpower the dish or make it too hot since the broth diluted the full strength of the Wasabi. The rolls are quite large and can easily be shared for a lighter lunch. The Crazy California Roll ($12.95) was fresh and enjoyable with a mixture of spicy avocado, crab, chopped onions topped with broiled shrimp, scallops and squid then topped with hot and spicy sauce. The roll is lightly broiled giving the roll warmth and a crunchy topping while the flavors blend nicely with the three different layers of flavors. It even reheats well since I had to take half home.If you're not a sushi fan several fish entrees are available from Tilapia, Volcano Shrimp, Grilled Salmon, or Catfish served with a salad and choice of red potatoes, rice or French fries. Pasta was on the lunch wish list and we weren't disappointed. Several types of pasta and noodles are available with Ocean or Cajun Spaghetti, Tempura Udon, Nabe Yakima Udon or Soba. The Chandon (spicy) with stir fried seafood, pork and veggies prepared in a pork broth was enjoyed and I was told a perfect option for lunch. While the Sara Udon (seafood) with veggies served on a plate of deep fried oriental noodles received a thumbs up as well.Everything was fresh, tasty, and affordable and we look forward to returning to try more lunch dishes."], ["Liz S.", "Okay, the quality of this place is going downhill.

Well, maybe...if you don't like fish...There are only a couple that feature fresh fish as an ingredient. \u00a0 Most have either \"crab aka 'krab' stick\" as the main ingredient, fried shellfish and/or fried vegetables along with \"tempura bits\" which, based on the description from our server, are bits of fried tempura batter. \u00a0I probably should have just stuck with the edamame appetizer, which was just as tasty as they serve anywhere, and then ordered some sashimi. \u00a0 For some reason, I was in the mood for rolls, and decided to plunge ahead, selecting two that had the fewest fried ingredients and no imitation krab. \u00a0 The funny thing is, that one of the few without fried ingredients is called \u00a0the Hoosier roll . \u00a0 It is a basic tuna and avocado roll with \"spicy sauce\". \u00a0 Well, the spicy sauce unfortunately reminded me of something that would go on a southwestern chicken sandwich. \u00a0It was a creamy, not very spicy addition that didn't entirely seem to fit. \u00a0 The Bob roll came with the same sauce along with smoked salmon and fried asparagus. \u00a0 The rolls are bigger than those at other sushi places in town due to what seemed to be a much thicker layer of rice. \u00a0 Two rolls left me quite full.The food wasn't bad, but there are far better sushi places in town. \u00a0 In fairness, the prices are also lower, so I guess that is to be expected. \u00a0 This would definitely be a good non-threatening place to bring someone who has never tried sushi, but if you are already a sushi fan, you might want to try something other than the rolls. \u00a0 If I do make it back here I will likely give the sashimi a try."], ["Amber P.", "Great sushi, but the staff is either insanely over-attentive or they forget you're there entirely."], ["Sal K.", "I was a regular here when I lived in Indianapolis, at least once a week I'd occupy a seat at the Sushi bar and would embark on a delicious journey hosted by Masa-San and Sato-San (and all of the other very capable sushi chefs).Their signature roll is the soft shell crab roll, pair that with some tuna sashimi, and sweet shrimp (with deep fried heads), and you'll have a meal you won't soon forget.One doesn't normally associate Indianapolis with great sushi, but this restaurant is a must do."], ["Deirdre G.", "It's so great having a sushi place so close to where I live.

Even if you aren't someone that shows up every week, they make you feel like a regular, which is wonderful. I have only eaten the bento boxes and sushi, so I can't say much about the rest of the menu, but I have enjoyed everything. Some of the larger rolls are impossible to eat in one bite, but they aren't things I like to order all that often. This restaurant definitely caters to Western style sushi, so there is a lot of smoked salmon, tempura, cream cheese, and hot sauce, but they make good tamago yaki, so I am happy.I suppose my only complaint is sometimes it can take a long time to get your order on a busy night if it's entirely sushi, but the staff stops by to let you know about how long you have to wait until the food arrives. On a night like that, the sushi tends to be a little sloppy and the rice might be a little dry, but that's just me being picky."], ["Joe C.", "I've eaten at a lot of sushi restaurants in Indianapolis and Ocean World and their sister restaurant Sakura are both excellent.

Im japanese american, spent 8 yrs in Japan and have eaten at some of the best sushi places in both japan and the US.

When my wife and i eat there we'll split some rolls and i'll throw in some hamachi, sake and maguro for myself. The raw fish nigiri is edible, not bad, not great. I accept it for what it is. The lunch boxes are a fantastic value. Dinner boxes are quite a bit more but you get a ton of food. Tempura is average, udon is good on a cold day but their broth isnt made from scratch but most people wouldnt notice that. Really, no complaints apart from some spotty service from time to time. i can live with that. When i need a japanese food fix, this is my spot. That being said, if you primarily eat sashimi, or raw nigiri, you'll find the fish at Sakura to be consistently superior. I know they're owned by the same people but i can only tell you what my taste buds tell me. Now, if you're a true lover of sushi, and you're looking for something truly superb outside of Japan, go to Kuni's up in Evanston, just north of Chicago.

As a person who's grown up eating authentic Asian cuisine, Ocean World was a huge disappointment. As soon as you step inside the restaurant, you know you've made a mistake. The decor was utterly atrocious, as well as the menus. The menus were a mess, and they looked like the designers made it on Word in five minutes. ALSO, there were huge evident food stains stuck on the cheap vinyl tablecloths they had draped over the tables. The tables weren't clean, and you didn't even want to touch the tablecloth for fear of touching someone else's meal left dried onto it.Now onto the actual food. Everything on the menu is extremely overpriced. You definitely do NOT get what you pay for.I ordered the Teriyaki and Sushi dinner box for around 20 dollars.After waiting an excruciatingly long time, my box finally came. It came with a salad that was drowned in sauce and a bowl of rice. The box itself contained several pieces of fried shrimp and assorted vegetables such as broccoli. I've had tempura plenty of times before, but Ocean World's almost doesn't qualify as Tempura. With my box I also decided to get the beef. The beef itself was soggy and under cooked, and like the salad, DROWNED in sauce. I had enough sauce left over from the beef to make a soup. Now onto the sushi. My box came with California rolls and three nigiri sushi. The California rolls were nothing special, and you could tell the ingredients weren't fresh. Whilst eating the salmon nigiri, something unexpected happened. There was an actual BONE in the nigiri. After this, I had lost my appetite. The rest of the food and the \"green tea\" ice cream were bland, and unmemorable.To top things off, as soon as I got home I had to rush to the washroom. Thanks for the food poisoning, Ocean World! I definitely won't be back.

I don't understand how it's such a popular restaurant.My husband and I decided to try it, since it's the closest sushi to our apartment. \u00a0We read up on the reviews here, which are pretty mixed, so we gave it a chance. \u00a0If you are doing the same thing and reading this review, I'll repeat: THIS PLACE IS NOT GOOD AND NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY. \u00a0It's obvious that those who say this is the best place for sushi in Indy are sadly naive, and ignorant of all the amazing restaurants that DO have amazing sushi.The restaurant itself doesn't look too bad (although their decor is a bit cheap/cheesy) & we were greeted by a friendly older man (I assume to be an owner or manager). \u00a0However, after walking in, everything just went down hill. \u00a0Our waitress was not friendly and barely grunted at us. \u00a0The first thing I noticed is that everything is WAY over priced: beer, sushi, everything. \u00a0We ended up ordering the tekkadon and the nigiri top ten. \u00a0After putting in our food order, our waitress completely disappeared. \u00a0(Actually, she didn't disappear, she stood in the middle of the store watching one of the TV's and never came back to ask if we needed more water or tea). When we got our food, it looked.... ok. It didn't taste good. It was VERY disappointing, low quality. \u00a0Some of the fish was warm, too warm... not the way it should be. \u00a0The smoked salmon and the eel probably were the worst (and eel is one of my favorites). \u00a0Also, the one roll we ordered was rolled VERY badly; it was loose, fell apart, and some weren't even closed and had fish and avocado hanging out of them. \u00a0NOT impressive. We basically ate it as quickly as possible and wanted to get out of there. \u00a0It took FOREVER for our waitress to come back. \u00a0When she did, I immediately asked for the check. We put our card on the tray and she walked away. \u00a0We sat there with the check and card obviously on the edge of the table while I watched our waitress stand in the back of the store sniffing cologne and perfume samples in a magazine. \u00a0Finally, we gave another woman our check who took it, left it at the front, and was about to leave before my husband followed her to try to pay. \u00a0At that point, she goes, \"Oh.\" and then called our waitress over there to take care of it.This restaurant is terrible, unless, of course, \u00a0you're one of those people who doesn't know what good sushi tastes like and enjoys getting ripped off. ALTERNATIVES: I've heard that Wasabi on 82nd is good, but haven't been there. I think the best you'll find is at One World Market (which is actually a Japanese grocery store), carry out or you can eat in, in a small seating area. \u00a0Also, there's a restaurant called Sushi Club, on west 10th street. \u00a0The area is a little sketch, but it's legit: all you can eat sushi for around $20/ person, and it's good stuff."], ["Erika B.", "Pretty good sushi for Indianapolis.

But that's not the end of the story, since OW is a very nice general Japanese restaurant with good tempura, karaage, agedashi-doufu, and some other things that are more like izakaya (Japanese pub) food. The prices are also extremely reasonable.But that's still not the end of the story, since, in my view, every restaurant should do something that's truly excellent. You'll find many raves about the soft shell crab roll here on Yelp, and it is truly DA BOMB. For just $8.95 ($8.00 during happy hour), you get a big roll that is already stuffed with soft shell, but then on top of that is what appears to be a whole crab's worth of delicious, chopped-up, deep-fried, mayonnaise-y meat. It's not only the cheapest soft shell crab roll I've found in town, it's also the biggest and tastiest.Their other rolls are good too, and eel is an ingredient they do well.So no, this is not a super high-end sushi joint.

Every time I go in there, we're seated right away, but the wait staff takes a while to come by, and the food takes forever. When I came in with a party of five, it took well over an hour before we ate, and the wait staff was rarely around to refill water and never said anything about how long we'd been sitting there.

We arrived and as I suspected it was packed. But not to worry because I had set a reservation. To my surprise when we arrived and I told them my name they quickly said \"outside?\". I was never asked while making the reservation for a seating preference. The inside was packed. Not an empty spot in the place. There was a few brave people sitting outside in the 60 degree weather. I am usually all about outside dining but not when the sun has set in October in Indiana. It was soon to be arctic chill and I like my miso hot. Feeling let down that they had not reserved us a table inside we agreed to wait. We did get the first table that got up about 10-15 minutes later. We ordered seven rolls and split them among the three of us. Wow, we were all blown away. Favorite roll was the sun roll. The tuna, salmon, and crab mixed with a little bit of spicy sauce was the winner of the night. It was a last minute add to our order and I am glad we went for it.

Sushi Bar had both, so I gave them both a try.Wasabi tobiko is a super intense wasabi burn. Just as quickly as it hits you, it goes away. Absolutely delicious and the fact they have them will get them my return business.I went with the spicy tuna hand roll and was happy with it, but I think they went a little light on the tuna. For the price, I thought it was a bit small, but I'd give it a try once more to see if its any bigger.I'm already starting to think about that wasabi tobiko again and I'm pretty sure I'll be there again really soon."], ["Ian B.", "First time here and i was impressed.Location: Perfect spot in the heart of Broad Ripple, like most places in BR you will have to fight for parking but thats not the restaurants fault.

The rest of the seating is pretty close together but not uncomfortable.

The only redeeming thing about this restaurant was our waitress, Cindy. She tried her best to help, but despite her best efforts, we were left stunned and in disbelief at how horrible the management treated both the patrons and the wait staff. The management should be ashamed for not coming to our table to defend their decision not to take off a meal which was served at least 45 minutes after two others in our party received their meals. The worst part is the meal was not worth waiting for! It was total CHAOS! Some sushi arrived while others were forgotten. There were only four people in our party, and while waiting for sushi isn't something unusual, we have never had meals arrive in bits and pieces over a 45 minute time period! Two other parties near us had similar problems and the kitchen was blamed every time. Interestingly, one party next to us walked out and cancelled a meal that was forgotten.There were so many mix-ups and excuses and apparently many apologies that went out tonight, but little to make customers want to return. The worst part of this experience was that it cost us a lot of money! We work hard for our money but apparently the owner of this sushi bar does not recognize this. If you ignore this review and try it anyhow, just remember not to blame Cindy - she's a sweet gal who should not be cheated out of tips just because the management cowers in a corner and refuses to talk to its customers.People who came in after us and ordered after us had their food and finished eating before we even got all of our food. It was two hours of waiting with less than satisfying results.One more thing. This place looks cool on the outside, but what should matter is good, fresh food and great customer service. This had neither! Dressing-soaked salad, barely warm miso soup, warm and dried up tuna on the nigiri and Panko \u00a0shrimp instead of tempura shrimp all lead me to say \"yuck\" and wonder if this place will one day give someone food poisoning."], ["Naser A.", "I'd say after trying couple of sushi places in Indy.

We decided on the celebration roll, a nigiri (salmon) a sweet potato roll, a spicy salmon, and a spicy tuna.When the food came out, Wow was all I can say. The presentation was great, and the celebration roll was absolutely amazing. It came out with seaweed salad on top, which I'm guessing was the celebratory part, and I commented to my GF that the only thing missing was the party hat. \u00a0We have several sushi restaurants back home in Cincy, and this restaurant was just as good as my favorite there. We had our qualms about the prices, since many of the Cincy sushi restaurants run the whole half price sushi deal all day every day (which I've never really understood). I believe the bill was $33 dollars, which was not bad for a Saturday night dinner. Would highly recommend.

I only eat cooked sushi rolls- I had the New York roll and Spider roll. The portions were so small! I wish they did a more consistent/better job of saying how many rolls came with each order. I didn't know I had ordered tiny rolls. I would have ordered another (I was still starving after), but it took us almost an entire hour to get our first order! The sushi didn't have much flavor and it was served almost warm. I just wasn't a fan. Try Kona Jack's or Sushi Boss. The ambiance was cute and the service was friendly (but SLOW).

But this little gem has somehow solved both of my woes. Not only do I leave satisfied and remain that way, I've found their prices to be reasonable, especially their happy hour beer prices ($2 for domestic OR import?! Count me in!).

I asked for a beer and my waitress forgot and I had to get another waitress to get me the bar I asked for, but it was no big deal at all. The servers were all incredibly nice and willingly to take their time to take care of customers, even when one group was attempting to complain for the sole purpose of getting a lower check rather than paying full price.

If you're up for raw, the mackerel (saba) and fluke (hirame) nigiri are fabulous. You could still see the silver sheen of the mackerel skin meaning it's as fresh as can be. The fish cut was generous too. The fluke was wonderful especially with the cilantro lime garnish atop which worked really well to enhance the flavor.

Then, came the bad service. There was maybe one waitress present on a Sunday evening who wasn't at the front to greet guests until the people way in the back of the sushi bar hollered at her to help. She was like the slowest server ever. Took like 25 minutes for me to get a glass of water and i was upset.Another table asked her for a fork and instead of bringing a real fork, she brought them one of the plastic take out forks fromThe take out supplies. Are you serious? They definitely have real silverware I have no idea why she didn't bring that out to the folks who asked. For the food, I ordered the sashimi appetizer and the tuna was just like a dark and old color. Expensive and low quality fish. The roll in the sky or whatever it's called was topped with the same brown tuna and sort of blow torched. It was unappealing to look at and the taste was just okay.

I read reviews and people said this was some of the best sushi in town, but I'm not so sure. First of all, there was no music playing so the ambiance was slightly awkward, or non-existent. The lighting was dim and it just seemed like the restaurant didn't fit the building. There was clutter in the corners and it just looked like it needed a serious facelift. I ordered hot tea, which literally just tasted like hot water. The miso soup wasn't very good, The salad dressing was pretty good, tasted just like Benihana's ginger dressing. I ordered some pork gyoza and if those weren't the most disappointing dumplings I've ever had.. just pork, no other flavors and not to mention they weren't seasoned a bit. For my entree I ordered a philly roll, asparagus tempura roll and spicy yellowtail. When I first saw the sushi selection, I could barely find anything without crab! (I don't eat crab) so I opted for these. Smoked salmon in philly roll overwhelmed the whole thing, yellowtail was nothing special and asparagus roll was good, not the best.Overall, I probably wouldn't come back. I'd rather go to Naked Tchopstix."], ["Jessica E.", "Pleasant service, great fresh sushi. Their sashimi is generously cut and perfect texture.

Tonight's meal took the cake for the worst service. After waiting for 15 minutes for the server to take our order, we received a meal that wasn't complete and was the worst made sushi I had ever eaten. It fell apart in your chop sticks. When seeking management to lodge our issues, we proceeded to get haggled over what was eaten and what wasn't, further tainting the experience. They even tried to suggest that we didn't know how to eat sushi, insisting that we demonstrate for them.

There were no good looking options near my hotel, so I turned to Yelp. This restaurant had a very good overall score so I turned on my gps and headed that way!I nearly left when I saw the parking lot. It looks tacky, run down, and plain sketchy. Had I not been starving and 20 minutes from the nearest sushi restaurant, I would have left. But those were the circumstances. The atmosphere is fine: quiet, and traditional, if overwrought, decor. I was promptly seated and ordered quickly. I got my sushi before my appetizer, which is kinda weird, considering I was one of two parties seated at the time. I did not receive my appetizer until asking for it, as another reviewer experienced. The food is of very average quality. Not bad, nothing to write home about. I'm not sure if they were running out of ginger, but from the amour they gave me you'd think they were. It was enough for half of one roll, and I'm pretty stingy with it.Overall, I don't recommend Oishi. If it is the only sushi restaurant in driving distance, get something else."], ["Casey B.", "This is a very out of the way, hole in the wall sort of place.

However, as experience has taught me, this does not always indicate a bad restaurant. Some of the best restaurants I have been to look worse but the food is amazing. The inside appearance is better but average. There is a slight musty smell, but nothing that would prevent you from staying.The one star rating is based completely on the quality of food I received. The clear soup tastes like it was made with a bullion cube. However, the sushi is far worse. I am not a picky eater by any means. This is the first time I was physically not able to eat what I ordered. My stomach wouldn't let me. I ate three pieces and that was all I could handle. Maybe it is simply based on what I ordered, but, unfortunately, my experience with the food will prevent me from giving it another try. Therefore, I cannot not recommend this restaurant."], ["Jim G.", "Okay this my last time to say it- you need to improve the waitress service. I get the feeling they are high school students that have very little knowledge of how important their role is to having a good to great dining experience, which adds to the profit side of the operation. Good food and good service go hand in hand with success. I think the food is fine now let's work on the service. To not ask if you would like another drink half way through the dinner is a missed opportunity for additional sales. To not know what the specials are even when the customers asked about the sign at the entrance means you are not paying attention. The bigger the bill potentially means the bigger the tip. I don't think this place is broken it just needs a better training for the staff. I've been here on three different visits and the food has been consistent, but so has the poor service. Good luck! I may be back in a few months to see if anything has changed."], ["Jeremie D.", "Oishi was our favorite place to get sushi for years. \u00a0There has been an apparent change of ownership in the last year. \u00a0The sushi is still very good but the server (yes, it appears there is only one - ever) doesnt know what she is doing. \u00a0She is unattentive and forgetful.

That part really doesn't bother me at all though. The main reason I can only give three stars is that the vegetarian options on the menu are few and are not unique compared to what you would find at any other American Japanese restaurant. I ended up having the tofu teriyaki and a natto roll. Both tasted good, but again, were not unique enough to warranted 4 stars."], ["Adrianne S.", "Great price, taste and everything else you could want!"], ["James B.", "Very good sushi, staff is very friendly and quick to serve and check in with you. Portions are good but the price is slightly higher than I like to typically pay but it's not overly expensive. The only real complaint is the spicy sauce they use on some rolls is not spicy at all, so you need to add more wasabi but this is might only be issue today and not common problem. \u00a0Only a regular visitor would know. In the end I'd recommend coming here and would gladly visit again when I'm in the area."], ["Derek H.", "I'm giving it 5 stars because it's as good as any of the other sushi places in town. Obviously, you can get better sushi in Seattle or Japan; but given Indy's geographical reality, this place is great, especially for the very reasonable price.I don't know how this place is still in business though. I've never seen it busy. That's worrying because it's the only Sushi option on the east side. I wish more Irvingtonians would support this place.And hear this, downtowners: This is your best Sushi option. You can get here way faster than you can get to Ocean World, Sakura, or anywhere in Broadripple; and it's just as good with no crowds to boot. Just hop onto 70 east to the Shadeland exit (about 5 minutes) and then take Shadeland down to 10th street (3 minutes), turn right, and it'll be on your left right after the corner.Sure, you can get your sushi at Mikado if you're made of money. Or you can go to Bu Da Lounge if you need your Sushi to have 3-dozen ingredients (ok, I admit, I sometimes like that). But if you want straight-up good sushi at a good price, Oishi is the place you should be going to (but probably aren't because you're too unfamiliar with the east side)."], ["Daniel M.", "The atmosphere was nice.

Hoo-shi is not what we want. We want sushi, and in Indy... step one: eat sushi on Friday or Saturday. The fresher the better and fresh fish starts on Fridays and goes down hill from there.

They've apparently done this before.There is plenty of seating. And there are 4 side rooms, 3 of which have partial drapes across them for a small degree of privacy.I'm not sure how to describe the flooring in the side rooms.

So, I likely don't know what \"the real thing\" is. But of the places HERE, Oishi is my favorite and LUCKY ME! it's only 5 minutes from home. It was built as a Ponderosa, and you can tell from the outside. On the inside though, it has really great decor and even tatami tables (sit on floor with shoes off in little rooms). MANY reviewers talk about this location like it's in one of the city's worst 'hoods, which just isn't true. It's on the far east side...not a wealthy area, but it certainly isn't dangerous or gross. It's an old suburb...you know...what Fishers will look like in 35 years or so. As a side note, the only time I've gotten food poisoning in the Indianapolis area, it was a restaurant in Carmel. Oishi isn't in a trendy neighborhood and it isn't someplace to \"be seen\"...it's someplace to eat really good food!What I like best about this restaurant, other than the sushi, is how spacious it is. At Sakura, I feel like I'm dining in cattle chutes! It is so cramped. Oishi has high ceilings and there is plenty of space between you and the other diners. You can talk to your companions without yelling because it's quiet. The service is also very attentive, and there is a nice flow to the meal. I was beyond impressed when I ordered 2 rolls and said \"no cucumber\" for one of them. The other roll evidently had cucumber; I hadn't noticed, but the chef did. He sent the server back to the table to see if I wanted BOTH rolls without cucumber, which I did. There are so few places with enough attention to detail to do something like this. We ordered a fried tofu appetizer (yum!) and a sake flight to start. I'm glad they offer a flight because some kinds of sake can be a little overwhelming, and it's nice to try small amounts to find out what you like prior to committing to an entire bottle. For my meal I chose eel nigiri (broiled eel on top of rice), a philly roll (I can't help it-I love cream cheese and salmon together!) and a Rock N Roll (eel, salmon, avocado inside, spicy tuna on top). We also had some sashimi (sliced fish, no rice). All were very fresh. The rolls were rolled and sliced into appropriately sized bites. It's annoying when a roll is too big in diameter or too fat of a slice to get into your mouth in one bite. Ungraceful to eat and it usually falls apart! Worth mentioning is that the chef had cleaned his hands before making the roll. I don't like wasabi, and when it ends up in the sushi because the chef had some on his hands, I'm not a fan. This doesn't happen at Oishi. If you don't like sushi and the very thought of seafood grosses you out, there are still many options, including fried rice. There are chicken, pork, and beef dishes, and even something that's remarkably similar to a fried pork tenderloin.

I would have appreciated some intervening Japanese pickle or more masago to help me pick out each sea creature. \u00a0 None of that was here; only a slightly cloying tempura.

There isn't a catch. It's really all you can eat sushi. I know, right!?We ate here with some Yelp friends in celebration of Movember. Staches covered the faces of about 20 Yelpers, ready to chow down! The menu is pretty simple once you understand the process. The lunch menu is split between the front and back, and the dinner menu is smack in the middle. Everything from soups, salads, tempura, teriyaki, uramaki rolls (basic rolls), specialty uramaki rolls, nigiri sushi (meat atop rice), sashimi (piece o' raw fish) and tamaki (hand roll shaped like an ice cream \"come\"). Whoops! Misspelling on the menu. Oh well. We're not here for a grammar lesson. Bring on the goodness!We were ordering food like it was going outta style. If we had more than one order of something, they would put it all on one platter in the middle of the table. We each had small plates, so it was more of a family dining style. Ya know, it's like grab some of this, try some of that. \"Ooo, try that one!\" \"OMG, that one is soooo good!\"Everything tasted awesome. I tend to judge sushi places based on their unagi roll - my favorite. The texture needs to be just right with this roll. The eel is cooked, so the eel needs to be warm, the cucumber still cold and crispy and the rice needs to stay firm. No problems there. The basic unagi roll and the specialty roll, the Caterpillar, ranked pretty well for my standards. Also tried the 465 roll, the Sexy Girl roll, the Spicy Salmon roll, the Dynamite roll and the spicy tuna roll. All of these were awesome, and I'm very picky about my sushi. I usually don't like fried rolls and I abhor cream cheese in roll. It's just wrong. Nope, all these rolls were a mouth party! The OMG Sauce is not as spicy as it sounds. In fact, it's more of a sweet/spicy. Nothing you can't handle. Dinner was complete with a scoop of green tea ice cream. Don't be put off by the color; it tastes delicate, light and delicious. As we left, we noticed a \"wall of fame/shame\" for the longest receipts. See, they charge some foods individually - i.e.: if you ordered a Sushi Pizza roll, you would need to place six orders to get six pieces of sushi. If you have a large group, your receipt could be awkwardly long. Are you hungry enough to make it to the wall?"], ["Sean W.", "All you can ask for in an all-you-can-eat sushi joint.

The crab Rangoon is good, and even their \"chicken wing\" and dumplings were great. We were on a little bit of a time crunch when we visited so we didn't get to explore the entire menu, but I guarantee you we will be back. Located very unassumingly in a strip mall, this is a gem of a sushi restaurant in Indianapolis. Usually I have always gone to 45 Degrees for sushi, but this compared very closely.

It's a blank slate. We went on a Sunday, so you can't get the $12.99 lunch deal (M-F). For $19.99 each, we got limitless crab rangoons, edamame, sushi, specialty rolls, etc. Our $40 allowed us to eat 10 specialty rolls, 3 pieces of sushi (surf clam and squid), 6 crab rangoons, and an order of edamame. I challenge any other sushi joint to match those prices! Best of all, the service was fast- no one is dragging their feet hoping you'll get too full to order another round! The crab rangoons are served with an excellent sauce, and our favorite rolls were the Dynamite, Volcano, and American Dream, although they were all good. Everything tasted fresh and was cooked/prepped to order.Lastly, their decor is very chic, and they have a huge room in the back where larger groups can sit on a padded cushion \u00a0seats on the floor.

I was so bummed that I had already eaten so much that I hardly had any room for these. \u00a0Obviously I persevered and tried a couple more pieces before I had to call it quits. \u00a0I loved all the fun specialty rolls and they were all unique and fantastic! \u00a0I've heard all-you-can-eat sushi places tend to skimp out on the amount of fish in each roll because of how much they make, but this was definitely not the case. \u00a0I could hardly eat a single piece of the sexy girl roll in one bite; it was so packed and topped with more!I had a great experience at Watami. \u00a0Great food and service, especially for the incredible price!"], ["Vivian H.", "Super helpful staff, amazing price, and good sushi!

So, for this place to open right down the street for me is a huge deal! I was a little skeptical at first, my vision was more of a sushi buffet like Journey's. Especially going in knowing the price ($19 dinner/$12 lunch). I pictured small cold rolls that have been sitting, waiting to be chosen. Not the case at all! All You Can Eat is the real deal! I literally watched a lady behind me order like 20 items....for herself :). You don't have to only get sushi either, the menu is pretty varied. I personally ordered 1. Seaweed salad (not the best I've had, but good.) 2. The American Dream Roll (made to order, 8-10 pieces, fresh, visually appealing and delicious) 3. Crab Rangoon (3 per order, made to order, tasty) 4. Miso soup 4.5 One Shrimp Tempura (from my friend's plate). I had a large lunch, but if i'd have starved myself the whole day I may have fit more, but I still left feeling like I got my money's worth. Lastly, the decor and atmosphere was very nice, clean and modern. I'll definitely be back, maybe for lunch next time."], ["Tim T.", "Wow, just wow... All you can eat and quality don't typically go together. It does here. This place is a gem! \u00a0Don't make the mistake of associating \"all you can eat\" with \"buffet\". \u00a0No buffet here. Everything is made to order. After reading the reviews and because I live close, I had to try it. \u00a0Even going in with high expectations, I was STILL pleasantly surprised. I took my daughter to lunch and we both thought it was awesome. When you walk in, the first thing you see are the guys making sushi. You sit, you receive a menu, and are encouraged to order whatever you want, as much as you want. We started off with an order of crab rangoon and an order of dumplings. Both were pretty good.Then we ordered a California roll, a dynamite roll, shrimp tempura roll, and a spicy tuna roll. \u00a0I also asked the waiter to give a mix of sushi (single piece), his choice. He brought salmon, unagi, octopus, crab, and shrimp. Everything was fresh and delicious. They are not skimpy on the fish like some places. What we ordered was plenty for the two of us, but our waiter was very accommodating and encouraged us to order more if we wanted. There was a variety of other items available on the menu such as fried rice, fried seafood, etc. but I came for the sushi so didn't pay much attention to what else was there. This place is simply outstanding. It wasn't very crowded for a Friday lunch. Maybe they do better at night. \u00a0I guess many don't spend $12.99 for lunch. This may be the best value in Indy. I would give 6 stars if I could."], ["Bill Y.", "I'm not sure what I was expecting from a strip mall sushi joint, but it wasn't this sort of quality. The sushi was delicious! My wife had the American Dream Roll and the 465 Roll, and I had to stop myself from eating it right off her plate. I will be getting those two for myself the next time, along with the Spider Roll. We also had the edamame as an appetizer, and was glad to have some hot and salty finger food between bites of surprisingly fresh fish.The great thing about this place is that it is all you can eat, so you can feel free to try something different, and if you don't care for it, go back to your favorites.

We went here last night on a Monday and was seated right away. It was not busy at all, but hopefully business will pick up because they deserve the business! It was $19.99 for all sorts of things on the menu. There is so much to choose from, seriously it not possible to try everything single thing. Not only was sushi on the all you can eat but they have stuff on the back for teriyaki and fried food and hand rolls that we barely got too because we were full from overwhelming ourselves with sushi. My favorite thing was the sushi pizza! It was delicious. It was like panko crusted sushi and it was crunchy and one of the best things i have ever tried. This place is a definite come hungry place to get your moneys worth. But I am a sushi lover and have paid more than $20 bucks for like 2 rolls. Just me by myself I managed to eat 4 different rolls on top of that with appetizers. Can't beat that! Everything was great and the service was attentive. Everything came fast and all at once. It was so much food between 3 people that the whole table was not visible from all the varieties of sushi. They even had a cute Asian sit down table for large parties in the back. They had 3 different types of ice cream for dessert, kind of bum they didn't have green tea or red bean to try, its ok i guess i settle for vanilla. But definitely I will be be back to try all the many other stuff on the menu like the non-sushi stuff."], ["Stacey E.", "As someone who loves People Who Love Sushi, but does not a love sushi myself, I wanted to make note of the delicious NY strip and vegetable dish I had.

The white tuna was great which is why this made it to two stars!the spicy crunchy salmon roll and spicy tuna roll were terrible! Nothing to them and the taste is just off. The salmon was not pleasant and typically that's my favorite. Out of all the food, the salad was my favorite thing (after I asked for enough dressing to slightly coat the lettuce). Just sad! Yes I loves in japan and California before so I have high hopes but this place didn't even meet my bottom line. The sushi in Peru,Illinois mall was better than this. That speaks for itself seeing as it was called BAYOU EXPRESS and not a single worker is japanese!The repackaged miso soup was okay. The waitress didn't know what was in our spicy crunchy salmon roll.

If I was going for the first time, I'd like to know that the sashimi pieces are quite small so I would order more the first time around because they are about half the size of a sashimi piece at your traditional sushi restaurant.

We went on a Saturday afternoon around 2 o'clock so it was crowded. The reviews said that there was limited seating so we quickly decided what we wanted, and grabbed a table while one of us waited for the food. The wait was fairly long--around 15 minutes. As a group we had miso soup, a new addition spicy shrimp roll (i think), and a beef and rice dish. The food was very tasty and authentic. They forgot to give us ginger and wasabi for our sushi and we had to wait a while to get it, because of the crowds. However, we were all very satisfied with our meals. I also got a chance to browse around the store. There are various food products and some miscellaneous items and everything is in Japanese. You can basically tell what everything is, but if not, the staff will help. The only problem is that with the size of the crowd, the shoppers and diners, the staff members are always occupied. I see a bigger space and more employees in One World Market's future if it continues the get the volume of traffic that it does now. The atmosphere was very casual seeing that it is a grocery store as well as a restaurant. One you order your food you wait for it and then take it to a table of your choice. They also offer free hot water and a microwave. We all thought that the sushi was pretty expensive. Though 9 or 10 dollars is not terrible for good sushi, I have had it cheaper at restaurants with good sushi and table service.I definitely enjoyed One World market and I'm going to try to make it back when I'm around the city."], ["Robert D.", "I have been in Indy many times & always told myself, surely there's a ma & pop's Japanese Market/Restaurant that is clean, reasonably priced, good selection of excellent Japanese cuisine , & most importantly...has excellent customer service (Hospitality & generosity)!! \u00a0Low & behold, I stumbled onto \"One World Market\"!! \u00a0No thrills, but everything listed above clearly over shadows any true short comings you might expect from such a small establishment.

Indy is very lucky to have it.I didn't even realize there were any Japanese people at all in Indianapolis until I came here. The place is not only run by Japanese, but Japanese people seem to be the store's main customer base, coming in both for lunch and to shop at the market. I typically just come to eat, and it's one of my favorite places to go in the area.The fact is, here is the best sushi that you're going to get in Indy. Is it the best sushi in the country? No, but you often have to pull your standards down a bit for Indiana, particularly when seafood is involved. I mean, it's just so far away from an ocean.I would suggest at least trying the sushi. They have a good selection and very, very reasonable prices. They're almost selling it at cost, it seems. If you absolutely can't do sushi, even the cooked stuff, then the other Japanese items are excellent. I love the curry here. So many places get it wrong so, when I find a place where it's done well, it's hard for me to get past that. But the noodles are also excellent. Really good stuff.This is not some cheesy Japanese place that you can take a dinner date to and expect a romantic meal and laugh together as you fumble with chopsticks. It's a tiny food court where seating is first come-first serve and you have to pick up your own food, get your own water and bus your own table. I would recommend either buying some tea and using the free hot water to make some for your meal, or buying one of the cold Japanese drinks they sell at the back (if you've never had ramune, then you should get one of those).My big gripe here is the chopsticks. They're not only the disposable wooden variety, but they also seem to be the cheapest you can buy. I have to spend a couple of minutes each time scraping the splinters off of them before I eat. I mean, they already have to do dishes, why can't they provide plastic chopsticks?Past the interior, the exterior is just a non-descript strip mall, sandwiched between Buffalo Wild Wings and REI.

Anyway we're cheap and so we didn't buy anything from the market area.However, we did order dinner. I had the Shrimp Tempura Udon combo with a California roll. The soup was mighty tasty, the shrimp tempura was decent....but the sushi roll was the sloppiest I've ever, ever had. For less than 9 bucks we felt it was a fairly good value, though. The food and atmosphere feels more like Japanese Fast Food instead of pricey sushi house, which my wallet surely welcomes once in a while.My dining partner had a roll of Crab Sushi. It was better made than my CA roll, and it was pretty good.

The shrimp itself was good.Sashimi Combo B - 3 different types of fish were served and the cuts were uneven but decent.

It seems the staff is pretty passionate about the food if you can get them to connect with you but they are definitely in their own world and seemed to be only checking off a checklist of things they needed to do when serving you. Not very genuinely interested in you. Which is a positive differentiator when you can find it. The booth we sat in was pretty run down and the hanging curtains need a cleaning badly. The ambiance is probably better and aging decor less distracting when the place is crowded but based on the other yelp reviews I'm sure people get scared off. I definitely was scrutinizing my plate when it arrived based on what i read (after I got there...I didn't check before choosing the place). My sushi was ok. The asparagus rolls were a bit cold and I don't think cooked enough. And there was a tiny hair under one piece. (Not too big a deal but I was a bit paranoid after reading the other reviews). The mountain of sushi was good but I think there was a fruit fly in the shredded crab topping (I didn't want to make it obvious that I was checking it as not to disturb my bf who was eating his pan fried pork tenderloin and enjoying it.) You \u00a0never can tell with sushi, sometimes it's just a piece of seaweed but it coulda been a piece of mildew. Who knows. So you just eat more ginger and buck up.We left full so I won't complain any more than just the things I noted.

We came in with a party of eight and were seated within five minutes. Service was very professional. We ordered some typical appetizers: edamame, beef rolls, and tempura. All were great, but especially tempura was light and flaky. Perfect!Sushi was scrumptious. Salmon nigiri might be the best I've ever had. Melted in my mouth.

They even had ankimo, and it was DELICIOUS!

Nevertheless, their setting is very nice.. very commerical and chic if I may say so.Started off with the Edmamme - I am a huge fan, and trust me when I say these were BELOW meh! :( Not seasons properly, not even boiled to the right tenderness, these were absolutely nO fun to eat. Move ont o the miso soup, I can't complain, it was just ok - nothing specialNext came the veggie tempura. Not a fan of the weird runny warm sauce that came with it, like a watered down soy sauce.. ugh! The tempura itself was ok, the eggplant being the worse I guess, since the pieces were WAY too thick.It was one of those days when I was vegetarian, so had to go for the Veggie fried rice, instead of a roll. It was probably the worst I have ever had in recent times. Rice absolutely stuck together, over done, too much oil, tasteless - so bland, that I poured hot and soy sauce over it..

I understand it is downtown Indy, and apart from their upscale look, they have nothing going on for them.. not even great/ fancy presentation of the food!

The waitress was awesome and funny, and happily split up the checks as we were ordering (mostly single checks with a few doubles). The tabletop was close to floor level like a traditional Japanese table, but under the table the floor dropped down so that you could sit at the table American-style. All in all, a great setting.The food here was top notch, especially for sushi in a small Midwestern city (ie not Chicago). Everything we tried, from sushi, to appetizers, to main dishes was outstanding. Take their advice and try the mystery sushi- I still don't know what was in it but I don't care because it was delicious. Portions of everything were generous- appetizers, sushi, and the main dishes.Now I have to say, we were here for lunch about a year ago and were less impressed, but maybe they've made some good changes. All I know is that if the dinner we had is the norm we will definitely be back."], ["Chelsy N.", "The first time I came to this restaurant, the open sign was off but it was only 9:45PM when I showed up. As I came in, I got greeted, but when I asked if I could use their restroom, after telling me they were closed, the host told me he needed to check to see if the restrooms were cleaned already. After he came back, he tells me they were and that I couldn't use them. Mind you, I got there from biking my way across the city in 10\u00b0F weather and was freezing and needed to thaw. He was basically telling me he didn't care about my condition or well-being and that he didn't want to do any extra work that resulted from me splashing warm water on my face or blowing my runny nose. I order the green tea and miso soup to warm myself up, yet the soup was lukewarm and tasted a week old and the tea had oily residue on the surface. I was a little disgusted, but decided to give this place another chance a month later. The second time, I made sure to get there earlier. I had the intention of sitting down and trying their sushi, however, when I asked to use the restroom before being seated, the same host from the first time tells me again that the bathrooms were just cleaned and that I couldn't use them. This time he pissed me off a little, so I complained to him and my server that I'm never allowed to go to the bathroom here. They end up letting me, reluctantly. When my organic greens salad arrives, I was disappointed with the freshness of the leaves, they were wilted, the peanut dressing was bland, and I don't think the greens were washed thoroughly, as I tasted grit while eating it. The sushi was the only redeeming quality of this restaurant, it's why there's 2 stars instead of one. I ordered the chef's special \"mystery roll\" and was blown away. It was creatively composed of a medley of ingredients that meshed perfectly together, super flavorful. I made sure to tip the sushi chef. I wouldn't recommend eating here if you're looking for an experience worth the amount of money you spend. They're pretty much straight to the point business unless you're spending an extravagant amount of money, and which everything is over-priced as it is."], ["Michael K.", "I'm in town for a conference and this place looked pretty promising from the outside, given the cloying kitschiness of the surrounding tourist traps. \u00a0I showed up at about 12:15 to a half full dining room on a Monday with four companions. The good: \u00a0I had a pretty passable soba, and there were no real complaints from my companions regarding the food, which comprised udon, some sushi, and a lunch bento, none of which generated complaints. The price was reasonable for the quality of food. The dining room was clean and inviting, with a pleasing faux-Japanese decor, as we're the restrooms. The bad:Service was atrocious. We stood at the entrance near three minutes before approached for seating. Then, we got water, ordered drinks, received them, and got our water refilled before being approached by a waiter of any sort for a food order, about ten to fifteen minutes after seating. We then received our food about 25 minutes later, after numerous more water refills. Finally, we had but our third encounter with the waiter when he brought us the bill. A visual survey of the dining room revealed many other parties in the same situation. In all, I'd estimate our total time there at about 75 minutes. In a part of town seemingly devoid of anyone at lunchtime but attendees at the nearby convention center, this is unacceptable. It was far too long a sojourn for anyone with the standard 90 minutes for a conference lunch.Summary: if you absolutely have a craving for something East Asian, and you have a ton of time with which to gamble, go at your own risk. Otherwise, go somewhere else so you can make it back for the afternoon sessions."], ["Dan M.", "The sushi here is top notch! This is my third time being here. I do not understand all the negative reviews! It seems like a lot of the bad reviews came from people who think they really know Japanese cuisine. I was stationed in Japan for a few years and learned that what is authentic Japanese is very different from what most American \"sushi bars\" serve. It's similar to going to China and expecting General Tso's chicken and crab Rangoon. In an authentic Japanese restaurant you won't find California and Philly rolls or anything deep fried on the outside. If you want those , go to a Chinese buffet. I'm sure these are on the menu to please the Midwestern pallet. Here the sashimi and nigiri are the stars of the show. The sushi chef really is a master at the way he cuts each fish. The prices are high because you are paying for location and most importantly quality fish! I recommend the hamachi, super white tuna (escolar), and the salmon sashimi. If you don't truly know or understand a type of cuisine, please do us all a favor and don't review a restaurant on your own ignorance and get your Cali roll from a supermarket.

I highly recommend their nigiri - ESCOLAR (super white tuna) was oily and melt-in-your-mouth smooth. UNI WITH QUAIL EGG was superb. I'm into strong-flavor fish so I enjoyed the MACKEREL as well. For hand rolls I'd recommend the SALMON \u00a0SKIN HAND ROLL was packed with crispy salmon skins cut in thin pieces. Hot dishes: the IKA YAKI (squid) was very tender, and the soy-based sauce complimented the squid well. I'd recommend the LAMB LOINS as well. Very juicy and tender.All in all a pretty good dining experience at Mikado. They also have a pretty nice SAKE selection."], ["Ted M.", "From the outside it looks like a nice and moderately classy downtown establishment.

We noticed how she was only waiting on 3 other tables so I really don't understand how it took her forever to get to us.

For $3 more, you can get a third roll, although their rolls are cut pretty thick and two is just right for a lunch portion.They offer a number of bento lunch boxes for the same price as the 2-roll combo, as well as katsu and noodle dishes.Sidenote: the lighting is extremely dark, almost nonexistent, in here.

I like Tomo!For lunch, any 2 rolls for $7.25, any 3 rolls for $10.25. Soup, salad, or soft drink included.We started off with Pork Gyoza as an app. Though tasty, the dumplings were just barely warm. Not sure if they sat too long, or if they were never properly cooked to begin with. We both chose soup as our accompaniment, and again, it was hardly warm. Great flavor, but not hot like soup should be. For our rolls, I had the Spicy Tuna and Philly Roll, and my friend ordered the Salmon Avocado and Tuna Avocado Roll. Among the four, the Spicy Tuna absolutely stood out. It was zippy and fresh. Highly recommend it. There was no way either of us could have eaten 3 of Tomo's sushi rolls as they are so large...but don't let that stop you! Order away -- the sushi is excellent.A note on the service: my friend was just eating his ginger (literally his fork was in his hand) when a serer who was not our own approached the table and took his plate without warning. I had ginger to share but an awkward moment, still. We will return as this is a great deal, the fish tasted fresh, and the ambiance is really sleek.

This restaurant was the worst of the four. Our waitress was often MIA - I had to ask another waitress for a refill. My steak was overcooked and the shrimp wasn't seasoned with anything but butter. Her Yakisoba was prepared in the back kitchen as opposed to on the grill and was also under seasoned. The whole presentation by the chef was rushed and impersonal. My wife did enjoy the atmosphere better than some of the other Japanese steakhouses but the food was considerably lower in quality. Tomo's pricing is positioned lowered then the other steakhouses so our expectations were probably a bit high but we ended up spending around the same amount. If you are considering this place, pay an extra 10% and head a few miles up the road to Benihana."], ["Ericka D.", "I don't know why this place is getting such high ratings it's just kind of ok.

The sushi a la carte was fresh and the portions were fairly good - Sakura quality (kind of gold standard in Indy for sushi).We will be back."], ["Whitnie E.", "This place is my boyfriend and I's most favorite sushi and hibachi place to dine. Their clear soup is delicious and their house salad is simple and refreshing. The staff is always friendly and people are always coming by to refresh your drink. To the eats: One of my stand-by rolls is the Spicy Girl roll. It is so delicious, with spicy salmon on the inside and spicy tuna mix with crunchy bits on the top. The thing that makes Tomo's sushi so delicious is the plating with the 4 sauces. They pretty much enhance any roll you order. We have tried most of the \"special\" rolls menu, and alongside the Spicy Girl, the Tomo Special Roll and Keystone Roll are favorites. I prefer to order a side of sashimi on the side, and their salmon sashimi is always fresh, ice cold, and delicious. Seems simple, but it can be easy to mess up sashimi. If you are looking for a smaller roller, I suggest the yellowtail scallion roll or the spicy scallop roll. Both are great.As for hibachi, their prices are great compared to other places and you get a heaping plate of food that almost always winds up in a \"To Go\" box. I have ordered the shrimp, chicken, steak, and scallops. None of them disappointed. Their fried rice is some of the best I've had. It is full of flavor and absolutely delicious. Their lunch hibachi specials are extremely affordable.Two of my favorite details though are the hot towel you are presented with when you are seated, and the sliced orange or candy you are presented with at the end of the meal."], ["Beth B.", "Here's the scene...my sweet daughter wants some sushi. \u00a0We cruise by our favorite spot and can't even get into the parking lot. \u00a0There were cars circling praying for a parking space. \u00a0So, off to try something new.

This apparently threw them off big time at Tomo. They are one of those \"seat you when your party is here\" places, which I understand, having worked in restaurants for most of my adult life. HOWEVER, we kept trying to explain that 1. we were reducing our party size from the original reservation; 2. people would be coming later. We picked this place for mulitple reasons: because I love sushi; they also have habachi for those people who don't like sushi; and I had never been there (I'm all about a new place). So four to five of us are there at first. We tried to explain that we wanted to be seated, and that more people would be coming later. OMG. First, we had a bit of a language barrier thing going on, and then there is the policy of only seating if the whole party is there. And they could not understand that some of us wanted sushi, and some wanted habachi. They kept telling us that they could only seat two or more people for the habachi. For the love, people. We seriously had to explain this to three people. We could not possibly be the vrey first people to ever go there and have this situation. This is not difficult. Seat us all at the damn habachi, already!!!!!! Finally I think we just pretended like the other people weren't coming so they would seat us. It was a bit on the ridiculous side. And they were not busy, to just add insult to injury. On to the food. It was seriously delicious. Almost all of us ended up getting habachi AND sushi. Yes, we totally pigged out. They also had a very good drink special-it was fairly cheap and good; $3 for a mai tai, I believe. The sushi was very fresh, and tasted good. The habachi was entertaining. I had the chicken and steak combo habachi. As at all habachi restaurants, the rice was delish!!! Now, I do have to say that they gave us a free dessert for my going away.

Right Daddy? Because I really like it here!\" Out of the mouths of babes, need I say more! After receiving a note from a fellow yelper on my review of Tegry ( which I have always held in high regard) saying that he enjoyed Tegry but his heart remained with Tomo, I felt compelled to try it. Now, I've driven by Tomo several hundred times I've been to Capri, only God knows how many times, I've been in that plaza at radio shack, game stop, the pet store and Walmart an uncountable number of times. I've contemplated lunch....maybe dinner..??.. At Tomo probably 2 dozen times and have been weary about trying it. When it comes to sushi, I've been eating it for 35 years, have eaten it all over the country and out of the country and nothing is worse than bad sushi so I was weary!! To say the least.

Okay daddy, mmmmm that's good!! LOL and my oldest Robert 13 7/8 years old who, I must say was much more adventurous in his earlier years but can still put a \"hurtin\" on some sushi. The decor was cool like a mix between Miyagi and the 96th street Naked Tchopstix. \u00a0We ordered Tako Su, keystone Roll, Lobster tempura roll ( best I've ever had), Rock & Roll, tuna sashimi, scallop sashimi, ama Ebi with the fried heads!

The service here is great! Almost every time I go here they give me a gift card for about $6 for the next visit. I have tried a couple of the noodle dishes and was not disappointed.

I noticed that another diner's scallops seemed to have been on the grill for a long time, and apparently the diner agreed because she didn't eat them. And when I tasted our hibachi shrimp, it was overcooked, as suspected. So I have to take away a star for that.

It was a busy Friday night. Right, I understand. The staffs are friendly. We ordered some basic items which shouldn't take long at all.Firstly, it took a good 45min! 45min! 45min! (important thing, repeat 3 times!) for our appetizer to come (Agedashi Dofu, should be a safe crowd pleaser. A deep fried tofu in light soy sauce wich daikon mush.) The crust is too thick, not crispy. Tofu is somehow medium-soft instead of soft (I guess this matches its heavy crust.). Overall, this gives this dish a really chunky, rural, crude feeling. At least in my impression this dish should be a rather delicate yet with a touch of luxury.Then comes the rolls. We ordered a basic combo and a special soft-shell crab roll. The basic ones are ok for the inside. The Nori/seaweed though, is too chewy with an overpowering sesame oil taste. This is the first time that a relatively authentic Japanese restaurant somewhat failed at the Nori part for me. It should be so fundamental and simple. I don't know what happened...For the soft-shell crab. It is just a straight Americanized roll with heavy crab tempura. Nothing special.In summary, I think maybe due to this specific time that was a miss for me. But I probably would not come back. On the other hand, I still think ASAKA is the best authentic Japanese restaurant in Indy."], ["Ali N.", "I love this place, come here all the time!

It is always packed with fish, the rice is well seasoned, and it is worth the wait. We also come here for the Spicy Sea Bass appetizer, it is excellent! This is also one of the few places in Indy with uni on the menu, that actually HAS uni! That is reason enough to keep frequenting Sakura!

It tasted like regular karaage which is not marinated. The sushi I had was just ok. Nothing great to speak of. But what really drops their rating is the service. I got my tatsutaage about 15 minutes after ordering. My sushi arrived 40 minutes after ordering. And they forgot about one item I ordered.

I can't forget to add--their miso soup is crazy good! My only suggestion is this: if you get a tempura noodle soup, ask them to put the tempura on the side. My boyfriend had the shrimp tempura udon and his shrimp were soggy.The exterior is probably not what you'd expect for a restaurant that many dub \"the best sushi in town,\" as the building looks to be an old Burger King or McDonalds, but the ambiance is nice--dark, very cozy and comfortable.

They have autographs from local and (inter)national celebrities as a border around the entire restaurant. It's pretty cool to see who's been there before you. Sakura is great for lunch. I've never had an issue getting a table during this time. They have a small lunch menu outside of what they regularly serve, but I always find myself gravitating towards the sushi menu, so I can't speak for that. I recently found out that they're quick to accommodate large groups, though I really do suggest calling ahead if you have more than four people. We called at 5:30 on a Saturday for a group of ten and they had a table ready for us by 6! It's not often you can find a place this popular that can make room so quickly. Best of all, each time I've gone, the check is super manageable. My boyfriend and I have gone a few times around lunch and, ordering at least six rolls of sushi, plus two bowls of miso (free!), our order generally comes out to just over $30 before tipping. How can you possibly beat that?"], ["Nick A.", "Better than LA's world-famous Nobu Matsuhisa restaurant. Fresh, delicious, authentic sushi."], ["Sara P.", "I visited for the first time during Friday night dinner rush, but was seated right away in a comfy booth without a reservation. \u00a0I had not experienced much in the way of sushi since relocating to Indy, so was curious of how Sakura would do. \u00a0Based on the appetizers alone, we were in heaven. \u00a0We split the tender, flavorful gyoza dumplings and seaweed salad. \u00a0I couldn't discern whether these items were homemade or not; I do know that they were definitely a notch or two tastier than similar items at other Japanese/sushi places. Although the appetizers and above-average miso soup arrived almost immediately, we waited a long time for my sushi and my dining mate's teriyaki salmon. \u00a0While my sushi did finally arrive, the salmon did not and we found out that the order had not been placed. \u00a0The forgotten salmon did show up fairly quickly afterwards, and was extremely tender and swimming in teriyaki; the delay was mostly forgotten. As for the sushi, I was glad to see not every menu option was deep-fried or smothered in mayo or cream cheese. I ordered the Hawaiian tuna roll w. mango & avocado, eel & cucumber, and my favorite, the Texas roll w. salmon and chili oil. \u00a0I definitely overdid it with the sushi, but that didn't prevent me from polishing off the Texas roll. I've not had a spicier sushi roll before, which was a huge bonus for me.Sakura has definitely made my list of top local restaurants, although there could have been improvement in its service. I'm eyeing the agedashi tofu and nigiri for my next visit."], ["Rachel F.", "The sushi here never disappoints. It's cheap compared to other sushi restaurants in the area and twice as good. The service has gotten better over the 15 or so years that I've been dining at this establishment."], ["Sofia V.", "I had the pleasure of going to Sakura for my birthday this past weekend. I am a huge sushi fan and heard that this place is wonderful so I was excited to see for myself. Well, the praise is well deserved! Before I go into the food part I want to talk about the restaurant itself. I find a lot of sushi places (or at least the ones I love in Indianapolis) to be a bit small so it was difficult finding a venue that would host my party of 14. Sakura is the perfect place for large groups. The noise level is not too loud and I felt like for the most part I could talk to all of my guests with ease. Plus, making a reservation for such a large group was easy peasy! They even held the table for us even though we were running a little on the late side...In terms of the food it was all delicious! First of all, miso soup for $1.75?! Yes please! What a perfect start to my meal on a cold day. The pot stickers were also amazing and came with a wonderful spicy, soy sauce type dipping sauce. For my main course I ordered the Rock n' Roll roll which was amazing!! The roll was loaded with fish and was quite large. Sometimes this roll can be over fried, and they did a great job of sprinkling the tempura and lightly frying for a slight crunch. Plus, the roll simply looks beautiful so my table was jealous ;) I also ordered the Hoosier Roll which is a great take on the spicy tuna roll (my favorite!). The spicy sauce was wrapped in the roll and they added a piece of avocado for a fresh taste. Finally, for dessert my friends told the waitress it was my birthday and they gave me FREE tempura fried ice cream! It was wonderfully crunchy and creamy. What a fun play off of Mexican fried ice cream!Overall, the sushi was fresh and delicious. The only reason I am giving Sakura 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wish they had a larger variety of rolls. I like a lot of options, and there were only a handful of rolls to choose from. But, I will give them credit that they had an extensive menu of noodles and other dishes so they truly are a Japanese restaurant. I would definitely recommend it to someone who wants a large selection of Japanese dishes beyond just sushi."], ["T S H.", "Among the best in Indy for sushi.

The waiting area is very small and crowded, but this added to the feeling of hype for what was expected to be a spectacular meal. After ten minutes, we were seated - even better!Our order was placed and shortly after our piping hot edamame was delivered to the table. Things were shaping up quite nicely!This is where the story takes a turn for the worse. It took an hour for our sushi to arrive. We didn't have a large or complicated order: a couple of tuna rolls, a shrimp tempura, a Texas roll. The most frustrating part of the waiting experience was watching the number of take out orders being carried through the dining room. I have no problem with you doing a healthy carry out business in addition to serving me in your dining room, but if it means I have to wait an hour for my dinner, then it's no longer okay. Unfortunately, by the time the sushi arrived, we had already decided it was going to have to be amazing in order to win us over. Sadly, it was not. There was nothing to make it stand out from any other sushi I've had around town. So, sadly, I cannot recommend Sakura, and I'm not likely to return. First impressions are everything."], ["Jane Z.", "Food is good! Genuine Japanese flavor! We went there on Saturday the place was fully packed! Hard to find a parking place.

Part two of this dish - the head. \u00a0Two very delicious, and fairly large shrimp heads fried to a crunchy perfection. \u00a0 It made up for the flavor of the sweet shrimp sushi. Next order was the Holiday roll. \u00a0Like a California roll with tuna and jalape\u00f1o pur\u00e9e on top with spicy mayo on the side. I'm not a fan of rolls because they tend to usually be California rolls with something integrated to it. \u00a0This roll was recommended by the sushi chef so I happily obliged. \u00a0Glad I didn't pass it up. \u00a0You shouldn't either.

I don't understand the hard-on everyone else has for this place. Each time I went for dinner, I left thinking \"It was fine, but it cost more than this other place, and the quality wasn't any better.\" I also didn't like how cramped and loud it gets at dinner time. I figured lunch would be more pleasant. I walked in at 1:22. They close at 2pm. There were 5 other customers in the restaurant. I stood there, waiting. After waiting for awhile (and not even being acknowledge by the 2 women who looked at me or by the 2 sushi chefs) I began to count. I waited for a little over two minutes until someone approached me...I was seconds from walking out the door. Inexcusable. The lady was friendly though, smiled, showed me I could sit at one of two tables. I put my jacket and bag at the table and said \"I'm going to go wash my hands\" (I had been handling earthworms with 4 year-olds). I came back to my table and there was no menu. I waited. I looked around. Was there a menu on the table? No. After several minutes the other server came up to me and said \"You need sushi menu?\" Well...duh...I'm not going to use mind control to get my food. I was not offered a menu at all, other than the paper sushi menu. Once I ordered one roll and 2 types of nigiri, the wait commenced. My food came out at 2:47. I was the only order! The sushi chefs stood there talking to each other for 20 minutes, until the server admonished them something which contained the words \"20 minutes!\" I think she was saying \"What's the hold up?\" but it could have been that they close in 20 minutes...both were true at the time. I got my sushi. The roll was tasty (Canadian roll, I think). I could barely eat the nigiri (one order tuna, one order squid). Evidently, Sakura always buries wasabi inside their nigiri. WHAT???? My nose was burning, my eyes watered, I couldn't even taste the fish at all. \"Disgusting\" kept coming to mind. I've eaten at sushi places all over, I even worked at one here in Indy for awhile during school. I can honestly say I have had better tasting nigiri in airports. However, I didn't have time to wait another 25 minutes for 4 slices of fish AND both waitresses had completely disappeared. When the waitress finally turned up (to clear my plate) I explained the wasabi situation. She didn't get the problem. \"Oh. We always do that. You say no wasabi next time.\" There won't be a next time. I'm sticking to One World and Oishi from here on out.

We went back tonight for the first time in a couple of years and were reminded why we go to Tomo instead now: the size of the sushi pieces.Sakura is a fine restaurant but the size of the fish pieces is just too small compare to Tomo - possibly half the size. So it would be if Restaurant A is serving 12oz ribeye for $20 and Restaurant B is serving 24oz ribeye of similar quality for $20 - which one would you go to?Clearly Sakura's business has been negatively impacted. We went tonight at 6:45pm on a Friday night and were able to get seated immediately. Throughout our meal there was essentially no wait.

Yup, me likey! Sakura has this Asian's seal of approval. ^__^"], ["Sacha B.", "Went to Sakura for the first time last night. When setting up plans for dinner with a friend who lives on that side of town & was open to trying sushi, I saw Sakura on coupons4indy.com and made the suggestion. Good choice--we had a delicious experience (and saved $5). Service was fine; she was friendly, kept our glasses filled, and checked on us a few times, but had to be flagged when we were ready for the check.I made a reservation for 3 people on a Wednesday at 6:30 PM to be on the safe side but it wasn't necessary. While the restaurant was plenty busy, there were several tables open and no wait. The dining room is not big but it's not tiny either, and the decor is tasteful. We waited (I'm guessing) 10 minutes for our rolls to come out after we finished our appetizers but I didn't really keep track because we were chatting and, having had starters, not starving.We started with gyoza ($4.95, fried Japanese dumplings with special sauce) and zaru soba ($7.25, cold buckwheat noodles with a dipping sauce). I saw in other online reviews that people liked them so I gave something other than edamame a try as a sushi appetizer. I liked them both. I don't know if either is made in house, but they were both tasty as prepared with the sauces. The waitress saw that we would be sharing the noodles so she brought 3 bowls of sauce, which I thought was nice.I thought we might get 5 (or 6) rolls to share but our friend said he was *very hungry* so we ordered 7. It was too much! We tried everything but he ended up taking about a roll's worth home.

No surprise there--so many reviewers said it was their favorite. The Huz liked Bob's second best. I may have liked Rock 'n Roll second best but I might have to make another trip to be sure; I did like Bob's a lot too. Not sure what our friend's second favorite was but he did go back for the last piece of sea eel + cuke.All of the sushi was very good. Fish tasted fresh and flavors were bold. My only complaint was that so many of our rolls had a similar creamy, mayo-based sauce. I chalk that up to choosing poorly, I guess. I try to get a good variety of hot/cold, cooked/raw, and fillings/toppings in our order but (1) the menu isn't super descriptive and (2) I only saw one deep-fried roll on there. Maybe I missed something...? I did tend toward the cheaper rolls so that we could try a bunch while keeping dinner affordable, so maybe the upper end of the menu deserves a closer look next time.I will also say that many of the rolls were hard to get in one bite...and I'm open to taking distastefully large mouthfuls. I ended up using my fingers and was caught more than once by the waitress mid-bite. Since I had already asked for (and received) a fork, I got comfortable with the idea that I am just an American who does things in bad form.Unrelated to the meal--I had two coupons with me, one for $4 off $40 and one for $5 off $50. Since our bill was over $60, we used the $5 coupon. I looked around the dining room on the way out to see if there was a table spending over $40. I saw a table with four older people, each with a platter, so I went over and offered them the other coupon. Just as I though, \"This lady is going to think I'm crazy,\" she gave me a high five!

The manager, Jason, has been working there for over 10 years and is truly passionate about making the experience great for his customers. Chad, the sushi chef is personable and very creative with the rolls he makes!Overall - I would highly recommend Fujiyama for any special get together!"], ["Rachael J.", "Came for their half off sushi deal and was pleasantly surprised! The food was delicious, but the drink service was a little slow. I was able to come in, sit down and immediately order but my drink took a little bit to get to my table.

I've done a lot of checkin's and that is the first time I've been offered a discount to check-in on yelp. Thank you Fuji! ;-) We also came on Mother's Day and received a $10 off coupon during that visit. Ok here is our review: (this is our fourth time here) the service is amazing, fast and responsive!

We will be back again and again!"], ["Beau W.", "I've tried to come here every week for as long as I can remember. There's not a week that goes by where I'm not thinking about this place anyways. On Mondays and Tuesday's from 5pm-7pm they have half price sushi on certain rolls. I end up leaving more than full and only spent 10$ total. It's a incredible deal! Not to mention the quality is the best I think I've ever had. I've eaten sushi cut right from tuna before in Hawaii, California, Florida ect. And I actually like this sushi more!"], ["Michael M.", "I really enjoy the food here. The prices are average for Japanese steakhouses. The mixed drinks are really good. I got the Caribbean Sake and it was fantastic. The plain warm sake is also good.The sushi is really good. The prices once again average. \u00a0I had a \"Hulk\" sushi rolls and it was FANTASTIC! It is sushi roll dipped in a green tempora batter. My wife and I both got the steak and chicken combination and added shrimp. The food is always cooked perfect. I always have leftovers.You will spend money here, \u00a0but that is why we only go every once in a while. The place is great for kids. With all the banging of knifes they are barely heard. The kids love the show with the flames and the flipping of eggs and stuff."], ["Rose F.", "Great sushi! \u00a0We came to Indy for the Final Four and had a crazy first day that started with a 5 1/2 hr drive and almost ended with losing our room that we booked 2 months ago! BUT we got the room AND the best sushi we've had in awhile! Yay! The cabernet is fantastic and only $5.25/glass great start! We ordered 4 rolls which is how much we usually order BUT it was a little too much because each roll was so packed and yummy! One roll had steak which we ordered bcuz it was different ( good but I don't think I'd order it again bcuz the fish was so good and fresh). The Dynamite Roll was good and interesting bcuz they bring it to ur table on it's own plate & flaming!!! Very cool! And yummy!!!The ONLY reason we don't give 5 stars is bcuz of the service from our waitress. We had to get extra drinks from the other waitress...ours seemed to forget all about us. Other than that...FANTASTIC!!"], ["Cynthia B.", "Best place for sushi!!! \u00a0You will not be disappointed, plus Tuesday night is half price on some of the sushi rolls. Great place for a date night!"], ["Laquetta D.", "We only visited one time and I wasn't impressed. To me it's your regular hibachi place. The decor and atmosphere is nice, but the food didn't impress. I felt like the food was a bit more expensive than other sushi restaurants that we've been too; not worth it. If the food was great this would probably have been good for them and me seeing it was only 5-10 mins from my house. But I'll stick with Ichiban in Greenwood."], ["Gretchen S.", "This just became my favorite sushi restaurant, and the quality and portion sizes are fantastic! My boyfriend and I started with the crab salad and tuna tataki. Both were ridiculously good and I highly recommend them. Our main course consisted of the paradise and temptation rolls.

This is the best kept secret in the Indianapolis area for amazing sushi!"], ["Caleb G.", "Still one of the best places for Japanese food in the entire city. \u00a0The remodeling done a few years ago has also brought it back to the time of \"nice place to go\""], ["Amber E.", "This is my 7 yr olds favorite restaurant. If you can get Victor as your table cook he has the best show with the most enthusiasm. We usually get the chicken teriyaki. The meal starts with a salad and onion soup. The salad is small but good. The dressing really makes it. I don't care for onion soup but my sister raves about it. The chicken is good-a little salty, but good and it comes with veggies and a heaping mound of rice. I usually go on Saturday for lunch so I only pay about $11.00 for me and $8.00 for the kiddo which isn't too bad.

I was visiting in from out of town and I have been to numerous hibachi grills and this one takes the cake! Amazing service, entertaining chefs, and the most importantly... The most delicious food. I'm still dreaming about that shrimp appetizer. The yakisoba noodles were delicious too. Wish it was closer. This is probably the best hibachi food I've had. The only thing that could use improvement was that the salad was too soggy. It was watery and I really couldn't taste the dressing. \u00a0Overall amazing! Will be back someday Indy!"], ["Stephanie S.", "We have eaten here for almost every birthday I've had for the past 20 years at least. It's always a go to for my family. Still awesome each time.

Great place for parties and celebrations."], ["Priscila B.", "Pretty good food!! I loved their sushi. It was fresh and delicious ! This is where we found the best teriyaki chicken in Indiana! It can get a little pricey but it's worth it. The cook was very funny and entertaining. Only thing I can complain is that we made reservation so we got in pretty fast but we waited for our food to be cooked for about 30minutes. I guess the cooks were busy cooking at other tables. Besides this everything was pretty delicious."], ["Mark V.", "My friend offered to pay for us to go to Fujiyama Steak House. \u00a0He really enjoys the food and the show. \u00a0I on the other hand do not like Fujiyama. \u00a0I would rate the soup at a three and everything else at a zero. \u00a0The place is overpriced and relies on cheap gimmick food with a show to get you to overspend at this place. \u00a0The show is OK but it is exactly the same show I saw 15 years ago. \u00a0The building is OK but nothing with character. \u00a0The service was acceptable. \u00a0I just find the whole concept to be boring.For the record, I am of European decent and I know that I make better quality oriental food at home. \u00a0Besides several wonderful oriental restaurants that have high standards but still provide reasonable value. \u00a0This place is rice and veggies and as little meat as possible. \u00a0The seasoning is minimal an really makes the dish feel bland. \u00a0There is no pop on your taste buds. \u00a0Overall, the concept is dated and out of touch with the new reality of quality food at reasonable prices. \u00a0Use Yelp and you will find places everywhere that will keep you craving for more. \u00a0 If you are bored of chain restaurants and think for yourself and are not manipulated by millions of dollars in TV commercials to make yourself believe you have to eat average to below average overpriced food at some chain restaurant, I am one of you. \u00a0Let's all keep supporting the true food scene in Indiana."], ["Chris A.", "I had not been here in a while and I was pleasantly surprised that they expanded their sushi bar. \u00a0 We opted to skip the hibachi and fill up on sushi. \u00a0 I had 3 roles that I enjoyed. \u00a0 Service was good, \u00a0and I have since recommended it to a few friends who love sushi. \u00a0I will be going back soon."], ["Katie S.", "This is a hard one to review. The food was fantastic! The hibachi chef was very charismatic and we all enjoyed his show very much. The problem with this place is, out reservation was for 7:30 and we were not seated until over an hour later. The hostess was not very helpful or accommodating to our large party. Plus I don't know how many times the server had to fix our bill. I guess it was everyone's first day of work there, or so it seemed."], ["Britt N.", "Everything is delicous!

Really fresh sushi!!"], ["Derry M.", "This may possibly be my favorite restaurant of all time, but that may be based on fond childhood memories alone... As a kid, the \"egg roll\" move - the one where the chef rolls an egg down his spatula onto the hot hibachi grill (which was mesmerizing to me in and of itself), and the onion volcano was just the icing on the cake to the Shogun... the 1/2 chicken, 1/2 steak option on the menu. \u00a0It was then, and still remains my favorite meal. \u00a0Back then refills on sodas weren't free (that has been changed now, refills are free as of the last time I ate there) but my normally tight old man never complained about how many I drank. \u00a0Yeah, I love me some Fujiyamas. They recently remodeled and it looks great - but as long as they still have that great food that I remember it matters not to me because I am a customer for life. \u00a0 Fair warning, however - you will be a volcano of poo soon after you eat here. \u00a0It's just the price you pay for such a delicious treat, though. \u00a0But yeah - you will rise like 3 inches off the seat. \u00a0Buy the ticket, take the ride."], ["Perry F.", "Fujiyamas is our favorite restaurant in the world. \u00a0 My wife and I have been going here for years. \u00a0 We took our kids when they were in high chairs, and now we're taking our grandkids. \u00a0 The salad is awesome. \u00a0 We usually buy a bottle of the salad dressing to take home. \u00a0 I always get the Seafood Dinner which consists of shrimp, scallops and lobster. \u00a0 YUM!!!"], ["Kevin D.", "We come here quite often it is a solid 4 not a 5 the table side chefs are always very good waitresses and hostesses are hit and miss. Food is never disappoints but nothing that goes above and beyond. They did renovate the front area which looks much better but the back needs updated now. Sushi is very good and always ftesh.

She took food and drink orders, then it took five minutes for drinks to show up (literally just a bottle of beer and another can of beer with an empty glass; nothing involved). Soup and salad came about 15 minutes after that. Then, we didn't see anyone for 40 minutes while waiting for entrees until the manager (we think, he didn't introduce himself) brought our food and a second round of drinks. Our waitress asked if the food was good a few minutes later, then we didn't see her the rest of the night. The manager checked on us again and comped the second round of drinks. The food was good. Not revolutionary, but alright. I liked the soup. The Hitachi steak was cooked good and came with some bonus shrimp. But the service was horrid. I'm a 20% tipper in general, but only didn't complete stiff them because the manager comped us drinks in the end. I'd stay away."], ["D A.", "Love this place, been going here since I was a kid. Can't say nothing's changed but that's not the case. Recently they've done a little face lift to the inside and it looks amazing.

I remember I would wait for my special birthday celebration. Unfortunately, we went on an evening when it was a congregation of baby carriers and toddlers. I'm not certain when society stopped using sitters but I felt really bad for the people at our table celebrating their anniversary. Enough sidebar, you are here for the food review :) After 20 yrs, the food is still amazing. The menu has remained consistent and in this case that is a good thing. They always start with Miso soup and salad with ginger dressing. In love with the hot towels and marvelous service. They can be extremely busy but I've never had a rude server. I consistently order the same item (fried rice, shogun dinner, medium rare). The sauce they prepare at the beginning could make cardboard taste good :)  Reservations are a must. This place is busy most nights. I've never waited more than 10 minutes with a reservation. When I wait it is spent in the remodeled bar area with a cocktail. I decided to go old school with a strawberry daiquiri. I remember turning 21 and drinking these. They are still served in the same way whipped cream, cherry, and light on the alcohol. Unless you are nostalgic like moi, or just wanting a drink that doesn't taste like alcohol you probably want to try what my sister ordered, Caribbean saketini. This drink was a five star. Delicious flavor, perfect amount of alcohol, served in perfectly chilled martini glass. Bless you baby sister for ordering this drink! Overall, you will not go wrong with any item on the menu. Also, be aware the restaurant is a bit more laid back than most Japanese steakhouses. I don't think this is a reflection on the ambiance but a reflection on how popular it has become on the Southside. If no reservations, prepare to wait. Also, watch for the coupons which make this an extremely affordable evening."], ["Amy L.", "service is good, food is good as well. The hostess is awesome.

I only gave 2 stars for the cute interior."], ["Brandon S.", "Now with more room... less smoke from the grills and modern furniture! Yes folks Fujiyama has been through an extensive makeover with a sleek, yet modern look... as if they chose the best feng shui furniture from IKEA.No more bridge to cross, no more gigantic open space with little to no seating. It's all new and fresh. Oh... and the food is still great!

For hardcore sushi lovers, order the chirashi. It's a bowl of copious amounts of sashimi, with a layer of rice underneath. It contained multiple pieces of salmon, tuna, octopus, shrimp, tamago (the sweet egg), mackerel, yellowtail (I think), one piece of eel, and a couple heaping spoonfuls of roe (the large fish eggs). \u00a0All of this was at $17, which is a terrific deal considering the good quality fish that I had tonight, and I left completely stuffed. (Don't be deceived by its appearance; it's a lot more filling than you think). Even more, the chirashi also comes with soup and salad. The ginger dressing was delish, but I wished the greens were more bite-size friendly (there were a couple huge lettuce wedges) and the bonito flakes in the miso soup were soggy (the broth tasted fine otherwise). \u00a0I'd love to have seen seaweed and tofu in the soup, but perhaps this was intentionally omitted given the population. I sat at the bar and talked to the sushi chef for a little bit. \u00a0He was very friendly and adorable (reminded me of my cute, older relatives) and did an amazing job with my dish. \u00a0I hope he is there the next time I visit! \u00a0So for sushi lovers in this area, be sure to check out Fujiyama and highly recommend getting the chirashi. \u00a0I look forward to returning!"], ["Leslie H.", "We only had sushi here. The table right next to us had a teppanyaki/hibachi and the show/chefs seems to be decent. The service was excellent. My hubby had the playboy roll and loved it. I like the crunch roll as well.

I would highly recommend this restaurant."], ["Catherine I.", "We had a party of 9, with 4 arriving before the others, and were told we could not be seated until the entire party arrived. This was a bit curious to me, as we were going to sit at the large Hibachi Table anyway. After a few questions about this policy, I asked we be seated and my request was accommodated. We ordered 8 filets with shrimp, 1 yakisoba with shrimp, and eel and tuna sushi. The filets were a little over done but the shrimp was cooked to perfection. The soup was tasteless, the salad was institutional iceberg lettuce with traditional dressing. The eel was good, but the quality of the tuna used for the sushi was not what I'm used to. The experience as a whole was entertaining with our Hibachi Chef performing the tricks of this trade with talent and confidence. The service was hospitable but disengaged, and despite the short delay with seating at the beginning was performed in a timely fashion. I think it's overpriced for the quality of the food served, with the bill ringing in at $307, with nearly everyone ordering either soda or water with their dinner, except for me; I ordered saki. I'd go again if I was with others who chose this restaurant, as was the case this time, but it won't be one of my first choices for steak or sushi. Over all, it was good, just not great."], ["Jonathon M.", "I go here with my wife when we are in the mood for Sushi but don't have a Franklin to blow at Sensu. It's a really nice local grill with all the usual foods and foolery you would expect from this kind of establishment. The waiters and cooks are all good spirited and great with the kids. The food is decent with the chicken being the star of the menu in my opinion. The steak and shrimp are also decent and satisfying. The usual flavors are all there and they present it well. The sushi is slightly above average with all the most popular rolls on the menu; California, shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, and the rest. They recently came out with a crusty crab roll in an effort to emulate the dishes success at Sensu. It is very good in its own right but far far away from the orgasmic flavor created at Sensu.Bottom Line: Great place for Sushi and Asian if you desire to stay local. It hits the spot just right on a rainy night and the staff is fantastic. The drinks and are also quite good and you might consider simply setting at the Sushi Bar and watching TV if you don't want to make a complete night of it."], ["Tom C.", "loved the sushi"], ["Chyna M.", "Good hibachi and surprisingly good, cheap sushi.

The decor is drab and dated, but it is easy to overlook that based on the good food, friendly service and affordable prices. Will definitely be back here again for happy hour! :) P.S.

We were seated at a grill with some regulars who were a lot of fun to listen to during our meal. The decor of the place seems like a hibachi grill that maybe had its heyday about 15 years ago. It's clean and it's nice, but something about it just seems a little old, almost like an older casino in Vegas. I got the teriyaki chicken which included miso soup, a salad with decent but kinda weird dressing (like a weird 1000 island), and the protein with fried rice. Our chef was skilled and cooked everything well and it all tasted good. Not amazing or bad, just pretty good. I'm a fan of Benihana and this place was similar obviously. I wondered how a $9 lunch would compare to a $20 dinner plate, and the difference in quality and taste actually does show through, so that's interesting. I would definitely return to Fugiyama. It's a nice cozy place to spend a lunch hour, and ten bucks for lunch occasionally is fine for me if I get to watch a hibachi chef run through his hibachi schtick (I'm sorry but I laugh hysterically every time they roll the egg and say \"japanese egg roll!\" That shit is hilarious.)"]], "Hana Japanese Fusion": [["Tom M.", "Great rolls as well as Chinese food!Hot and sour soup is really tasty, and I'm not usually a fan!The lunch bento box comes with 4 California rolls wich are very fresh and delicious!I like sesame chicken, general tso, or sweet and sour!Modern decor with a friendly staff, makes you want to come back!"], ["Rick G.", "I first thought \u00a0\"Does this restaurant deserve a 5 star review\", and the answer was...absolutely they do! \u00a0I enjoyed my experience from start to finish.I'm a newbie to the Sushi scene, and our waiter gets major kudos for explaining the menu and options to me. \u00a0I told him that I tended to like my food on the spicier side, and he recommended a couple of dishes, and they were the perfect mixture of flavor and heat.I try not to rate on price alone...I try to rate on value instead of dollars. \u00a0I believe this restaurant is an excellent value for the money! \u00a0Even though we live on the other side of the county, we'll be back!"], ["Danielle K.", "Sushi tastes okay....

Good quality, good value, tranquil setting. This place is tiny and it took some creativity to fit the kitchen and everything in. Props! The lighting was a little shocking when I walked in but it was rather soothing and put some life and energy into the small restaurant. I ordered chicken hibachi $10.95 with house salad plus clear soup and a spider man roll. Clear soup is like most Japanese steakhouses but I enjoy them and this has a little more flavor than most. They have other options if this is not your thing. The ginger salad was on point, with crisp ice cold lettuce, and cold ginger dressing. The dressing was very vinegary but is refreshing and I liked it. The salads are small but only $1.50 so I'll be in for lunch to grab a few of these and a sushi roll soon! The hibachi vegetables were crisp and fresh, the chicken was cooked well, and the fried rice was very good as well. However, my hibachi plate was over filled with a sweet teriyaki sauce that made everything taste the same. I prefer hibachi to have little to no sauce especially when you offer teriyaki chicken and other things on the menu. Spider-Man roll was good but not a great presentation nor something that wowed me.

I have yet to try any cooked dishes, but the prices seemed decent, so maybe I'll swing for that instead of sushi the next time I go. The only complaint that I would have is the confused service. There seemed to be a lot of servers, but many of them ignored us, and our server forgot our miso soup and salad entirely. When our food came out, I had to ask her for it. The only reason it irritated me was because we waited over half an hour for our food, so we just sat there waiting the entire time instead of having a soup and salad to hold us over.

Mostly importantly, I like they have a filter system within the location to assist with the 'smokiness' in the bar. While I am NOT one to frequent establishments that allow smoking, I do know the filter system helps people like me enjoy my bar experience along with smokers.

They do offer some seating on the sidewalk if you wish to enjoy yourself outside on a nice evening. Bu Da offers a nice selection of items. While there is no gluten free menu, they do have a few items that they can accommodate to be gluten free, including one of the sushi rolls. Hands down the best thing that Bu Da has going for it is their drink menu.

Not that its terrible but that they are clearly trying to accomplish two things in one setting. The music playing was not the new-age, trance-like sound you would expect to hear. It was American 50's. 60's pop/ R&B which added to the bizarreness. So starting off feeling unsure about what would transpire. Then we were served the best calamari I have ever had. It was crispy yet extremely tender. Perfectly spicy. The service was excellent and professional. Also tried the Pho. This was surprisingly good as well. If I go back for a second time, I will get a double order of calamari. Food was great service was great, atmosphere was strange making things seems questionable upon first glance."], ["Kylie B.", "Great food, great drinks, great atmosphere!The shrimp martini is AWESOME!Sushi is the best in town.

The calamari is my favorite in Indy. Their sushi rolls are a little pricey, but they are original and substantial. It's a big place, so they can usually accommodate nonsmokers.

We happily sat outside and enjoyed a bit of downtown people watching as we waited for our server. It's certainly worth noting that the inside, while lovely - dark and sex-ay - wafts thick clouds of cigar smoke. Yes, it's a cigar bar and it most definitely casts such an odor. For lunch - not so appealing. Service was spot on throughout the meal - very attentive, quick to refill our water glasses and provided helpful suggestions along the way. I went with the simple but flavorful shrimp sliders: three nicely piled buns stacked with a fair amount of tempura shrimp dunked in a spicy Sriacha (I assume) aioli. Healthy? Not in the least. Tasty? Yep! My dining cohort went with the Sriacha noodles which came out a bit heavy and positively swimming in sauce. It's worth noting that upon my sampling they were also lacking in heat.Overall, though, I would surely stop back in at Bu Da Lounge again. I'd like to sample some sushi or try a cocktail when I'm able!"], ["Wei H.", "My experience was short and painful. But I did have a to-go order so the food rating could have been higher. I was in Indy downtown for a week for a business trip and I desperately needed some sushi fix. Bu Da Lounge appeared as a four star and only couple of blocks away from the hotel I was staying at. I ordered the soft shell crab roll and seaweed salad to go. Bad idea. - seaweed salad: they put big chunks of green onions in it. I would not have minded small bits of green onions but why? Green onions are green onions and they can't just pretend to be seaweed and be eaten. I had to pick out the green onions and it was not easy... those two look so similar in a dimmed room.- soft shell crab roll: the soft shell crab was bitter. So I ended up having to take out the crab, which defeated the purpose of ordering this roll in the first place. I hope it was just a one-time incident. What prompted me to give a 2, even a 1, now that I am recalling my experience, was the environment. It is a lounge but I did not know that it was gonna be a bar kind of lounge. As soon as I stepped in the restaurant, it was dark, and people sitting at the bar turned around and stared at me for a good 3 seconds while smoking or drinking or doing whatever. If you like to have sushi in a bar-like black hole, drenched in smoke and alcohol particles in the air that was not going to be circulated, this is you place, because the food would not matter. The least they could do, if they want to cater to more groups of customers, is to have a non-smoke section. That way, at least they could do their food some justice, coz apparently some people liked their food, and they did not order them to go."], ["Mandy D.", "I was kind of nervous about stopping in here for lunch on a beautiful sunny day as the restaurant itself is very dark and clubby feeling, but I'm glad I did. The place was pretty deserted because we were having a very late lunch (around 2:30), which also made me a bit apprehensive, but it was well worth the initial worry. The menu includes an eclectic mix of Asian flavors, including the drinks. I had the lychee martini which was the perfect balance of acidity and sweetness. For lunch I enjoyed the pork, which was in a delicious Vietnamese charbroiled style. It was very tender and juicy. I would definitely return for dinner. It also looks like this place would be a nice lounge-y spot for yummy drinks on the weekends. If I'm ever back in the area, I'll definitely come back."], ["Mandy S.", "This place is so corny and the beauty school dropout handling my carry out order is a complete train wreck.

It looks very nice. The ambiance is great for a dinner date and staff is friendly (but I'll elaborate in a second). It's pricey, no doubt. I went for lunch and opted for the sushi because I could get 3 rolls (Tuna roll, Alaska roll, and California roll) from a selected list for $11.99. Naturally, fancy place, expensive food should equate to a quality experience. Sadly, the food looks significantly better than it tastes but really it didn't look too great. I am a big believer of using no soy sauce, wasabi, or ginger with my sushi. If the sushi is prepared and seasoned properly, there's no need for the frou frou. This time, I used all of the soy sauce I poured into my sauce dish, because it was so bland. The salmon for my Alaska roll was oddly fishy and I could barely keep it down; the tuna roll was OK; and the California roll tasted vaguely of sesame seeds that were rolled on the outside. My boyfriend got the scallop tempura and to his surprise, what came out was a dish of large-cut vegetables and four pieces of scallop. He got a side of rice and a bowl (yes a bowl) of sauce of his tempura battered food. It tasted more like watered down sesame oil though. The real kicker was at the end of our meal, our waiter finally gets around to asking us how things were going. My boyfriend tells him, \"Good, we're done.\" He goes \"Good\" and walks away. We assumed he was going to get the check, but after 10 minutes of no service, he waves down the waiter again to get our check (which was conveniently already in the pocket of his apron, surprise).

Whatever that liquid was, it was terrible, and it seriously altered the flavor of the roll ... take a bite of a roll that hadn't been exposed to that sauce was much better than the half of the roll that had been. The mistake roll was tasty, if you like the taste of the spicy mayonnaise sauce that absolutely covered the entire roll, which I do - but not so much that I want it to completely overwhelm the fish and other flavors that are on the roll. I honestly could have very well been eating nothing but rice and not even known it, there were no flavors aside from the sauce that were even detectable.The chirashi was mostly pretty good. It was a small bowl for the price, and the octopus was bad enough I spat it out into my napkin, and the mackeral didn't seem to be very fresh, but the rest of it was pretty good fish.All in all, this was the least satisfying Japanese/Sushi dining experience I've ever had. As we were driving away, we decided to stop somewhere and get some bar food to satisfy our hunger."], ["Iris T.", "I have never had a bad roll here! I love this place. I have been to Wasabi on 82ndabout 7 times now. Recently, I have started ordering their udon soup bowls. They have to tweak them a little for me to make them seafood only, no meat. This last time, it came with a side of tempura fried shrimp and veggies and they didn't even charge me extra for the seafood. Their rolls are great; my favorites being the sweetheart roll (shaped like a heart), and the mistake roll (their house specialty). I have never had bad service here, and they have some great party rooms in the back for large groups. My only critique would be their website; the link to their menu doesn't work.

(I have fairly high standards since I've lived in Chicago, NYC, and SF.) The only thing I didn't like was the hamachi. It tasted really fishy. The atmosphere is relaxing and sophisticated.The staff was very friendly and helpful."], ["Richard P.", "It is Christmas night and dining options in Indianapolis are few and far between. Being your typical single guy with a dysfunctional family, I found myself ready for some serious relaxation with a friend after a day of ho-hum holiday festivities and snarky social media comments. My friend and I originally ventured over to the Steak n' Shake in Nora, but they had their hand-written sign on the door announcing \"Dining room closed. Drive-Thru open.\" Since it's in the 30's, dining in the car wasn't an attractive option. On my way to Steak n' Shake, I'd spied a couple Asian-themed restaurants that were open, as one might expect, and my friend and I opted for a first-time visit to Wasabi on 82nd Street. Wasabi is a Japanese steakhouse with a specialty in sushi, though I will admit I'm not a sushi devotee and even heading into the restaurant was kind of hoping I'd find something that sounded attractive. I will admit that I tend to be a \"cheapest item on the menu\" kind of guy. Tonight, I was determined to splurge and celebrate my survival of the depths of hell that you likely call Christmas. Options at Wasabi include a nice variety of sushi and sashimi that I couldn't possibly explain to you without sounding like a complete moron. Reviews on here seem to be fairly positive about it, but given that Wasabi is more than I usually spend on a meal I decided to play it fairly safe and head to the steak side of the menu. They have a variety of chicken, steak, and salmon options including my selection - NY Strip Teriyaki priced at $20 and including a small salad along with Miso Soup. I added my usual iced tea to the meal and ended up with a meal at right around $25 not including tip. My friend ordered the Katsudon - Fried breaded pork cutlets saut\u00e9ed with onions and egg in a special sauce over rice. It ran $10 and he added a bowl of Miso Soup plus his customary diet coke. Judging from the \"re-opened\" sign, I think it's fairly safe to assume that Wasabi was fairly recently renovated. It's located in a strip center on busy East 82nd Street. While \"strip center\" can be a bad thing, Wasabi is surprisingly intimate and lighted with an almost perfect ambience that allows you to feel like you've escaped the world even though the restaurant itself isn't that large and the front has a huge window. What can I say? It works. The service was prompt, courteous and helpful. We both received refills for our drinks, but weren't hovered over even as business started to pick up as the night went on. My friend and I were able to enjoy our meal and genuinely relax. They utilize background music that is fairly difficult to describe - it's essentially Asian-tinged American music. As we first sat at the table, I realized I was listening to an Asian singer tackle Dylan's \"To Make You Feel My Love.\" The tables are close but not crowded, though it definitely did get more crowded after we left. The food? The steak was an absolute delight. It was perfectly cooked and every bite was consistent and nicely done. I will admit that when I received it on its plate without any of the usual side-dressings that it seemed a bit lonely, but it worked and was a great meal. The salad was delicious, and I'm not a salad guy, and the Miso Soup was also terrific. The meal was filling, but I didn't feel stuffed. While it was a splurge for me, it genuinely \"felt\" like a splurge - that's a good thing!As my friend and I sat out in the parking lot finishing up a conversation after the meal, we did learn that they'd run out of fish and there was a waiting time on food at that point. That seemed odd. After all, it should have been well planned that there could be quite the crowd on Christmas night with area restaurants closed. I saw a few customers actually leave - so, clearly there was some poor planning there. What can I say? I wanted to treat myself special and Wasabi ended up being quite the special meal. While I'm not quite willing to call it a five-star experience, it was definitely a highly enjoyable experience with good service and great food. It won't be a regular stop, but I won't hesitate to return with friends who want the sushi experience."], ["Corrine P.", "The sushi was really good. I ordered the Mistake roll based on all of the helpful reviews on yelp! I think if you visit, the mistake roll is the way to go. The sushi is a bit pricier than other locations.

My family and I love this sushi joint and love its consistency. Sometimes the service can be slow, but nothing to get upset over. We have had everything from your basic sushi rolls to the bento boxes. It's ALL good. Also, when you go, you are a fool if you don't order the Mistake Roll - given the name because it is a \"mistake\" if you don't order it. I am inclined to agree. I can't recommend this place enough. The location is great if you are looking for a date night \"pre-movie\" meal, generally there is no wait to be seated and if there is then their sushi bar is free seating.

We returned it and instead of our waitress apologizing and taking it off our bill she argued with us continuously about how it's calamari that's fried. then the owner came out and argued with us as well and continued to say what we meant to order was the grilled squid.

I got the spicy tuna...a standard choice when testing out a new place. It had a really mushy, mealy texture - I couldn't identify a single piece of tuna...just a tuna-like mush.

We ordered the combo dinner #4 teriyaki chicken and tempura shrimp with California rolls and then the mistake rolls, as suggested by our waitress. The dishes was very well presented. There were only two shrimp with an assorted mix of tempura vegetables which I was fine with becuase I was hoping for some veggies. The chicken was cooked to perfection as was the shrimp. The rice was moist and wonderful sticky. The California rolls were perfect and there was a little spring roll and half of a potato crab cake with the dish as well. Now for the mistake rolls. I almost do not have the words that could give justice to the incredible delight that was our sushi rolls. For those of you that like the real deal such as legit raw sushi this not your roll.

Except for the eel roll, these are all very tame rolls and are not easy to mess up. The california was not bad and not anything special at the same time. The tempura roll was extrememly flavorless and the eel roll was just nasty. I am a big fan of eel, but this roll had a bad flavor and the eel was full of bones.

Daily specials that branch out beyond traditional sushi. And, well, what really struck me as pretty righteous was their wild steak roll. Lose the rice, lose the seafood and find teriyaki'd thinly sliced steak wrapping 'round asparagus. They just turned blasphemy into something really attractive even for the avid sushi eaters.

It's in a strip mall, and apparently, that is a really popular strip around dinner time."], ["Arnold P.", "The extra star is for the service but the food is just not good. \u00a0I ordered a combo plate and boy was I disappointed. \u00a0If you spend 80 dollars on a meal (including 20% tip of course) you should expect some good sushi!! \u00a0My eel was cold, the rolls had too much rice and the tempura was soft and mushy...how do you mess up tempura?"], ["Lacey U.", "Oh Wasabi... \u00a0How I WISH I was leaving a different review of you. \u00a0You were my favorite sushi place in Indianapolis and I'm now disappointed, hurt, and most of all hungry... \u00a0to find a different place. \u00a0I was too excited when Groupon came out with a fantastic sounding deal of $15 for $30 and waited until I couldn't stand it any longer. \u00a0I usually get a middle of the road roll that ends up delicious but wanted to treat myself to a more expensive roll that I was SURE would keep me awake at night thinking about when you opened again. \u00a0In fact, I would have spent so much more... (Think of the scene in Pretty Woman when the hoity toity store wouldn't help Julia Roberts and then she comes back and shows them how much they lost out on.). \u00a0However... when I arrived salivating and starving, and waving my Groupon around, I was told they wouldn't honor the Groupon... because they would only accept it if there were two people at the table (They also wouldn't serve me wine outside). \u00a0Say what??? So, I looked at the fine print and rules of the Groupon and couldn't find that requirement anywhere. \u00a0I asked the server to point me in the right direction so I could clearly understand the Groupon and he advised it was an agreement the owner had with Groupon, but it wasn't written anywhere. \u00a0He said there was nothing he could do and wouldn't accept my Groupon. \u00a0So, I left... \u00a0I\"m so sad, I'll never return. \u00a0Groupon agreed with me and refunded my money immediately. \u00a0 I've brought a lot of business to this establishment and now have a foul and fishy taste in my mouth. \u00a0See ya Wasabi... There are plenty of other fish in sea..."], ["Emily U.", "They totally phoned in a 22-piece veggie combo plate. I don't know why I keep hoping for interesting veggie rolls in Indy because it never happens. However, the menu at Wasabi advertised that one of the rolls had squash, which gave me hope. It was a false alarm, though. There were no rolls with squash, no interesting sauces (or sauces at all), no unexpected combinations, nor even a veggie dipped in tempura batter on this absolutely snore-worthy combo plate. This was not a cheap lunch either. The atmosphere and service were good, but I'll probably go to Marsh next time I am craving plain cucumber or avocado rolls."], ["N M.", "In my view this is one of the best sushi places in Indy. I will admit it is a little pricey compared to other places but the sushi is fresh (ask what is the most fresh), they have an okay sake selection and many creative (and excellent) menu items and rolls. I highly recommend the orange crush (if you like Salmon) The only drawback here is the service is a bit spotty. Generally easy to get a seat."], ["Jeff C.", "Great sushi and nice atmosphere."], ["Melanie T.", "After being told that P.F. Chang's had a 3 hour wait (!) my hubby and I decided to see what else was in the area. Wasabi on 82nd is just down the street from Keystone Crossing so we drove over to check it out. I am glad we did because we both really liked it.AMBIENCE- The restaurant is in a strip mall location next to a cell phone place and a Cold Stone Creamery. Parking is ample. From the outside looking in the place seems small but once you get inside you realize that there is a lot more seating in the back, including a separate room that's almost hidden. (maybe it's for private parties?) The hostess is friendly and asked if we had reservations. We didn't but we were seated promptly anyways. Most of the tables are 4 tops and I don't think they have any booth seating. Tablecloths, cloth napkins, and a small candle on the table all add to the charm.SERVICE- The waiter was great. Very attentive and prompt with refills. He checked on us a couple times throughout the dinner to make sure we were OK. MENU- The menu has a nice selection of dinner combinations that include bento style 'a little bit of everything'. Salmon teriyaki, beef teriyaki, chicken teriyaki, shrimp tempura- all available in a mix n match combo that comes with Miso soup, salad, rice and a couple choices of sushi too. The prices are in the $18 range for these combos.They also have udon and different soup choices as well. And this is on their main menu. They also have a separate Sushi menu with about 25 different rolls. The rolls range from $6 to $20. All in all, the menu is what you would expect for a Japanese place.FOOD- YUM! The food was great. I can't complain about it at all. My husband got the Udon soup with Tempura and he said it was the best he has had since we moved to the Midwest. The soup is a meal in itself. It can get messy and 'slurpy' but that's half the fun! I ordered several different rolls off the sushi menu. I liked every single one but my fave was the Mistake Roll. They also have a rolls that's like a Jalapeno popper- what?! Yes, it's a cream cheese stuffed jalapeno fried and then rolled. All the sushi I got was very fresh and made well. So far, this is my favorite sushi place in Indy.OVERALL- Thank you sir, may I have another? Oh yeah, we will be back to Wasabi on 82nd, no doubt. We've tried a couple other places and this place beat them all. So for now, I have no reason to go anywhere else for sushi or my husband's new craving, Tempura Udon. Yeah, you can complain that it isn't as good as that place in NY or that place in California, yadda yadda. This is Indiana and for being a land-locked state, this place does sushi right."], ["Melissa B.", "In my opinion, the best sushi place in the Keystone area. \u00a0Service and atmosphere are great, prices are reasonable, and the rolls are hands down the best. \u00a0Overall, always a very good meal."], ["Tom G.", "Good sushi. \u00a0Fresh and well prepared. \u00a0Reasonably priced. \u00a0Good wine list. \u00a0Very nice atmosphere. \u00a0Seems like my best sushi option on the NE side of Indianapolis."], ["Lauren W.", "We made a 7:30 reservation on a Saturday night and when we showed up at 7:35, we expected to just get put at the front of the wait line...no no no...there was a reserved table waiting for us!

My only complaint is that it's rather small. I ordered two! \u00a0The sushi rolls are out of this world and so fresh. \u00a0I lean towards the cooked/fried ones because the crunch makes it mouthwatering. Please do yourself the favor of ordering both the \"mistake roll\" and the \"volcano roll.\" \u00a0The mistake roll is spicy tuna mix with a tempura shell, topped with a sweet & spicy sauce. I can't remember what's inside the volcano roll, but its topped with succulent lump crab meat and a sweet eel sauce. UNREAL!!!!!!! \u00a0I get a side of the peanut dressing and dip all my sushi in it. I have converted all my friends and family to do the same because it's SOOOOO GOOD!

There isnt anything special about this place as its just a few tables in a small space in a strip mall. You can sit at the sushi bar, or a table. Service is always young staff, that you feel like its their first day because they're nervous or rushing around. But have never once messed up an order.

The mojito wasn't anything special. But the sushi was! They had some ingredients I hadn't tried before, like mandarin oranges, which was very tasty! All the rolls we had, even the non-specialty ones, were very good. Service was pretty friendly, and the place definitely had the feel of \"the place to be\" on a Sunday night - it was packed, but in a fun way (not a hassle).

The inside has a cool vibe - you feel like you've been picked up and plopped into a sushi joint on Sunset in LA. I will say I think the prices on rolls are a little high without the discount, hence why I think I would only come here on Sundays in the future. With that being said, the rolls were delicious. I had the California roll and got a little crazy for my second roll and went with the Playboy. The thing came out wrapped in tin foil and on fire. It was spicy, creamy and just so dang good! Didn't have a drink on this particular visit, but definitely think this is a cool alternative to after work or even late night drinks and is a place I'll have to keep on my radar for that purpose.

I absolutely loved the Pad Thai, which seems odd for a sushi bar. The dish was very flavorful but wasn't extremely oily. I haven't had it since last summer so hopefully they haven't changed the way they make it. Both the 45\u00b0 Salad and Spring Rolls were good but nothing memorable.Then I found about half price sushi on Sundays so I had to drag my boyfriend to try it. They have a pretty decent variety of rolls to choose from. But like another Yelper mentioned, they do have a lot of rolls with cream cheese. I would have also liked more choices that didn't have some sort of tempura ingredient. All the rolls we tried were good but not great. And even for being half price, they just weren't worth it. So far, I've tried 5 different sushi rolls total and none of them have me excited to go back to this restaurant. I really like the interior of Forty Five Degrees. It's very modern and has almost of a clubbing type atmosphere. I enjoy the music selection although I've never eaten here when they supposedly have a live DJ. I've also had great service every time I've come here--the hostesses were polite and the waiters have always been friendly and attentive.Overall, this place gets an honorable mention but me but I would not consider it a 'must try'.

It's really only worth the overpriced rolls to go on Sunday when it's half-priced.

I had a calm, 3 month old in a pumpkin seat and 8 ppl meeting me there and they asked me to leave because my infant isn't 21. It def does not come off as a bar at all, just a meh sushi place, so it didn't occur to me that my infant (who doesn't drink) wouldn't be welcome.I'd only go here when someone else chose this place so I'm kinda glad to have a reason to take it outta my restaurant rotation.

Even on a busy Sunday. There was no wait as seating is abundant. This can also be an issue as table sizes are extremely small and very tightly placed together.

We ordered the salmon Diablo and the Mt Fuji, both of which were served beautifully. I get the Mt Fuji every time (deep fried sushi is always a go to) and this was my first time having the Diablo. Both tasted even better than they looked, but we were still craving. Having been a regular at Naked Tchopstix and fan of their Playboy (the one you see wrapped in foil and set on fire), we went with that. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. It was good, but the texture was soggy and more flavorless compared to Naked Tchopstix up north. I wouldn't even consider them in the same category other than being set on fire.

It was a properly portioned meal consisting of parmesan panko crusted tilapia stuffed with blue crab with a side of asparagus and basmati rice. What stood out to me the most, and what I essentially licked my plate clean for, was the spicy lobster sauce that covered the tilapia. I could have seriously drank the stuff.

OMG could eat it every day. Seems to be a lot of spicy sushi on the menu. Not a fan because it overpowers the true taste of the dish and keeps you from experiencing how much effort the owner and chefs have put into such an awsome meal. \u00a0Not that the spicy is not good, because its awsome. \u00a0Just try a couple of sashimi without soy sauce and you'll see what I mean.

Staff are knowledgeable, friendly and efficient. Food generally arrives quickly.Food: now we get into the meat of this place. Simply awesome. Creative sushi rolls, wonderful appetizers and sensational salads. There is something here for even the most picky eater.

The service was quick and friendly. I had never really had a real sushi experience but several in our group had so they took charge for the appetizers. We had edamame (sp?), California rolls, Boston rolls and miso soup. All were perfection. Watermelon martinis were perfectly mixed \u00a0and delish.

I am not a sushi fan myself, which most people would be inclined to wonder what the point would be to eat here. It was my brothers birthday.

But I got the \"Caesar Salad\" which is Sriracha spiked Dressing / Fried Capers / Tortilla Croutons / Parmesan($9) and it was literally the best salad I have ever personally had.

No question."], ["Brittany S.", "That salad. Oh! That salad. I can still taste it's deliciousness even weeks later. The oriental salad, that is. Napa cabbage, peanuts and a powerhouse array of flavors. Perfect portion as a meal alone. Being all silly and there for a meeting, I played it cool and didn't plow through the entire meal (I'm a notoriously slow eater). Rather, I took my to-go box promptly back to my car for a messy feast for one. Being allergic to seafood, I haven't visited 45 Degrees as often as I should. But now that I've had the salad my approach will be different- I still have yet to try the jalape\u00f1o tomato soup.

Very clean, trendy and you can top it off with a yummy martini! On Thursdays they are half priced."], ["Mae M.", "This is probably a really good place to go for half-price sushi on Sunday, otherwise nothing special. At least if you aren't a huge fan of very western sushi rolls. The sushi menu had me worried because almost every roll had cream cheese, \"cheesy crab mix,\" jalope\u00f1os, sriracha sauce, or 3+ sauces on it and too many filling ingredients that didn't go together. I felt like it meant that the fish quality would be terrible and they had to drown it with sauces or cheese. I was wrong. We had some sashimi and the fish tasted much better than I had expected. But the sushi was just okay. It wasn't wrapped tightly enough and the pieces were all irregularly shaped from one another. For the price of each roll, I was expecting something a little better than what I make at home. The atmosphere is a little weird. It's a lounge and bar, but it very angular, cold, and to me uninviting. Too many things jutting out, shiny textures in the decor, and the light show flashing all over while \u00a0television played a Rocky movie. As for service, we went on a Saturday night around 9:30. The bar and lounge were half full, but we were greeted, seated ourselves, and had our orders out pretty fast. Our server was nice and he or another server would bus our finished plates or give us refills promptly."], ["Nicole R.", "Best sushi downtown! The Mount Fuji roll. Amaaaaaazing! Love that they take reservations as well. Great place to go!"], ["Shani J.", "So the first time I went here, the service left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I decided to give them another chance because I was with a large party and they were pretty crowded that night, which can typically be hard on a server. I went back with a friend last night during Devour Downtown. They weren't crowded at all, and we were told to sit wherever we liked. We chose a booth because it was comfy and near the windows. Well guess what? We couldn't sit there, because they MAY have a larger party come in. If you tell customers they can sit wherever they like, let that truly be the case!So we sat outside, had really good service from a sweet server, and the food was great! It's such a cool place, beautiful setting, perfect location, and they have wonderful food. I'll try it again and hope that my overall customer experience matches the level of everything else."], ["Hunter A.", "I've only visited this restaurant once. We went on a Friday night for their Devour Downtown Menu. We had made reservations the day beforehand and we were seated at a hightop table for two just at the entrance to the restaurant. The location of our table made it unavailable for us to even appreciate the restaurant's modern decor and even worse large groups of people waiting for tables had to stand right next to ours.As far as the menu goes, the Spring Rolls were excellent! The teriyaki glaze drizzled on top was very flavorful and the wraps were tightly rolled and served on top of baby spring mix. Overall the four rolls were a pleasure to eat! However they are a little too messy to eat with your hands but we were forced to do so for lack of knives and an absent waiter.The second course on the Devour Downtown Menu was a salad, either their signature 45 degrees salad or the ginger salad. I had the ginger salad and while it was okay, it was nothing special. I usually only use half the salad dressing given to me at restaurants, but my salad barely had any dressing. On top of that, the salads were very small. I'd say my portion was less than a cup of mixed greens. My boyfriend did say he enjoyed the 45 degrees salad.We ordered the Rainbow Roll and the Thai Kiss. Both of the rolls were excellent tasting. However, I agree with other reviewers that the rolls could have been more tightly wrapped. The quality of fish on served on top of the Rainbow Roll was superb, and the Thai chili sauce on top of the Thai Kiss certainly had a kick! We both enjoyed the flavor combination. We also ordered martinis with our meal, the Key Lime Pie and the Wild Orchid. While both were great tasting, they were not very strong. Overall, I cannot see myself going back for a weekend dinner.Maybe I'll visit on Sundays for half-priced sushi, but otherwise the amount and quality of the food served for the price isn't worth it.I'm sure there are other restaurants on Mass Ave that offer a similar modern atmosphere, with better drinks, service, and food."], ["Kristin L.", "Service on Sunday is questionable.

Half off sushi on Sunday's is prime, along with the drink specials for Mojitos, Bloody Mary, and Long Islands. As soon as you walk into the door, don't expect a welcome or a smile. When eating your food, expect for servers to want to clear plates that you are working on. Throughout each night, we feel the same. Half a plate of edamame and half a plate of sushi we are working on that is being bullied to be finished so that they can take it away from us. I could see FortyFive degrees being 5 star if they read their Yelp reviews, but I can understand the reputation that they hold to stand by the menu prices. Half off sushi with an appetizer and a couple drinks can run over $70.

Granted, we had had some drink. $4 Bloody Mary special was cool. $8 Ketel One martinis, also cool. If we had not had the 1/2 priced sushi, our bill would have been $86. Take out $28 for drinks, and that is still A LOT of money. The rolls were laughable. The inside of any maki should be, oh, a circle, not a kidney bean. They were small and tasteless. The dynamite roll that my friend had me sample was good, but then again the only reason that probably tasted ok was because there was cheese...on it. Yeah, I know, cheesy Japanese food.

If I was able to get over my mental block of what I was actually eating I think I'd have enjoyed it. It definitely was a mouth full of flavor, but again, my mental block hindered my enjoyment.

I told him it was a happy hour, and we didn't have exact numbers, so we didn't know how big our party would be but that a booth would be fine. He said it was their policy not to seat incomplete groups because they might have reservations for other groups. I asked if they had any reservations, since the place was empty, and he said \"a few.\" We offered to sit at a 4 top, and just pull over an extra table as more people came (there is a row of 2 and 4 tops in front of the sushi bar), and he wouldn't let us do that, either. After 15 minutes of arguing, he finally let us sit. As the rest of our group came in, we didn't have any trouble fitting in the booth, and there were still plenty of open tables for other guests.The host (who also said he was a manager) was totally curt and unreasonable.

We try to head over late afternoon and squeeze in at a spot at the bar, but if it's a nice day (hard to come by lately) or there is some sort of event downtown, expect to wait at least 30 minutes. The wait is well worth it, though. Once you're seated, the sushi is half off and delicious. I agree with others on here who have mentioned the Mount Fuji Roll - it is pure fried bliss!Of course, since it's half off, you can't take any leftovers, so order wisely! We always end up with a few extra rolls, but since it's half the price, it's worth it!"]], "Naked Tchopstix": [["Linda L.", "Good service great food! There is a bar area to the right, and they have a little gong they hit when you order saki bombs which is kinda fun. I also like that you can get a good variety of food- Thai noodles, Japananese soba, Korean bimbap.... Also the bento boxes are delicious and have a good variety as well. You can start off with miso or spicy egg drop soup ( I prefer the miso).. Then in your bento box you have salad, an egg roll, crab Rangoon, California rolls and the entree you chose.

We usually hit up our fav in the area- Sushi Bar, but being a girl's night we wanted some cocktails. We all decided on Moscow Mules, even though they didn't have the ginger beer the bartenders still made us a concoction that was great! The mood was great. Dark lighting gave it a romantic, intimate feel. We started off with miso soup- my go to nowadays it seems. It was okay, nothing spectacular but I did enjoy the big chunks of seaweed. We also got edamame to start. Large portion size and easily shareable. For the sushi: we enjoyed a corona roll, sunset roll, spicy tuna, fire roll, spicy scallop. The rolls were great and we received them pretty fast for a Saturday night! We loved the corona roll so much we ordered another round of sushi for the table. We loved all the sushi!! I was very impressed!Service was mediocre. The place was not busy at the time we were there- around 9pm. Our server did not seem to have much knowledge about the bar when we asked about the moscow mules, or about the menu. Seemed he didn't even recognize one of the rolls we had ordered. I noticed a gathering of servers and maybe friends? around the one end in the bar where we were sitting. I had to flag him over to order more rolls. No check in or anything while eating. Then came splitting the bill. We initially were going to split it 4 ways then decided to split it 3 ways but one of the bills picking up half. He seemed confused and frustrated at the table. Even suggested that splitting it four ways made sense- well it didn't for us since a friend wanted to pick up another's tab. Finally a manager came over and fixed it all very fast. Wish he would have approached her sooner about it."], ["Stephanie D.", "Came here on a whim with a cousin of mine. She recommended it for lunch and since I live downtown I don't get out to Broad Ripple a whole lot.

First off, I'll admit...I had no idea what I was eating. I wish our server would've explained it to me or I would've gotten some info. I knew one was shrimp and another tuna...the other 2 pieces...well who knows. The California Roll was fine, but then again how do you mess something like that up.

One night we decided to order an avocado roll \u00a0to split as well. When we got home, we saw that they had forgotten the roll and also gotten one of our bibimbap orders wrong. We were disappointed, but it wasn't a huge deal, so we decided to just call and let them know. They apologized and said the next time we came in we would get a free roll.The next time we went in, the person who waited on us remembered us, and came and apologized. The manager not only gave us TWO free rolls, but also bought our drinks. And I just have a hard time believing that the delicious wine I got was the house wine that I ordered - it was far too good! We would have gone back anyway, because we love their food and always have, but it's great to feel like they really want you to be there and happy.

Both drinks were chilled and delicious but at $6 a glass Chelsea was quick to advise since we enjoyed the drinks so much we could order a whole wine bottle size for only $20 which offered great savings!! Next we each ordered the ginger house salad which had fresh crisp lettuce and a thick tasty ginger dressing.

The drink selection is pretty extensive and definitely made for the ladies, with appletinis and martinis galore. The entrees, I have to say, are consistently bland from the Japanese croquettes to any of the noodle dishes. The rolls are a sizable shape and I like the pricier rolls including the playboy and Tokyo rolls. The standard salmon and tuna rolls however are subpar compared to even sushi on the rocks. The fatal knock however is the shoddy service. It is bordering on inexcusable. Atleast keep me in the loop if there's a backup in preparation of rolls and fill our water glasses once in a while! I understand that a place gets busy but after three visits, the bad service is starting to become a bad trend here.Overall, if I want sushi, I'd much rather go elsewhere like asaka or Sakura or even 45 degrees and sushi on the rocks.

This was my first time there so I had no idea what type of cuisine they offered, but was surprised and pleased to see a sushi bar. When we were seated, I asked the server, Rachel, if any of the sushi chefs were Japanese. She replied, \"I think they are Korean, but it's the same thing.\" I said, \"actually we are not.\" The reason I was asking is because I wanted a specific type of Japanese favorite, onigiris. (Rice ball wrapped in seaweed with baked/broiled salmon in the middle). I did not inquire any more. As the rest of our party arrived, our appetizers, drinks and entrees were served. A few times, someone else was helping Rachel. I also ordered Pow Pow Shrimp, which came in a martini glass.

When I stood up to let them out of our booth, there were a few servers rushing back and forth saying things like \"hot soup, get out of the way..\" I was appalled at their rudeness and quickly sat down. While I was rushing to return to my seat, I knocked over my shrimp and the glass broke and fell on the table and floor. I promptly informed the server and she asked if I ate any of it. I told her I had only taken a few bites. She didn't offer to bring more or even remove it from my bill. I was disgusted and just wanted to go home. I paid the bill and did just that, skipping the concert. I called and got the run around from Stephanie over the next few days. She assumed that I was saying I had been offended because I felt like Rachel had made a racial slur against African Americans. Another assumption. The reason I was so offended was because she said Korean and Japanese is the same and it's NOT! I am offended because my grandmother is from Osaka, Japan!! She raised me!!!

Honestly, I don't really know what I was expecting from a pear mojito, but I like pears and I like mojitos, so what the hay?

It's far better prepared technically than your local Kroger.Hot Dishes - Nothing great to say, unfortunately. I ordered the Teriyaki Steak dinner. Was given the miso soup and house salad simultaneously. Soup had a nice smokey pork essence, but was more or less a broth with seaweed. Salad dressing was pedestrian, over spiced, and there was a lot of liquid at the bottom of the very small bowl. Teriyaki steak was a joke. Everything past the introductory courses was smothered in onion beyond recognition. Even the broccoli garnish wreaked of onion... My coarsely chopped steak of unknown cut (looked like sirloin) tasted of onion. Unfortunately, that's all. It was ordered medium rare, though served well done. The entire plate smelled and tasted of nothing but onion. They even serve it on a bed of partly steamed, partly grilled onion. By bed I mean about 1/2 inch thick bed of onion. I did ask for an upgrade to fried rice, which the server did manage to let me know would cost a dollar more. Fine. The rice was cooked perfectly. Delicious and chewy. Unfortunately the rice was shimmering like my sports car at age 19. It was really oily. Service - Waitress barely spoke English and neglected to mention any of the menu items that weren't to our taste. Left 20% though honestly was useless. Final Thoughts - \u00a0Great sushi, and as far as I can tell garbage on the hot line. I obviously couldn't sample the entire menu on date night, but if these guys are serious about Asian cuisine, they need a lot of help; especially on the hot line. Cannot recommend.This restaurant seems to feel like a spot that once got everything right, but lost sight of the passion for great food.

The roll that came with the box was better than the two we ordered as appetizers. My boyfriend got orange chicken, and it was pretty good as well.

I think maybe the stars aligned a little bit.First of all, we were lucky enough to find this place on a Monday. Why is that? Monday is HALF PRICED SUCHI, YA'LL! This would account for why the place was packed, but we were still seated within ten minutes.Now, on to the sushi. Simply put, it is always fresh, always tasty and I always walk away completely satisfied (and stuffed). The spicy yellow tail and spicy salmon rolls are my favorites but the classics are exceptional too (cali/phili/veggie). My husband is under the impression that if sushi is half off, you can order twice as much, so we usually get to take home leftovers too!"], ["Britney P.", "Really good sushi.

The 'home style tofu' hit the spot - big, crunchy veggies along side a generous portion of tofu hanging out in a shallow pool of light sauce... is it too soon to go back?Mondays are half-price sushi night. Get there early. Eat a little too much. And go home happy. :)"], ["Don S.", "This restaurant is by far the best in Indys South side, great service and really good food.

There was four of us and we decided to order the party platter called the \"Love Boat.\" \u00a0It's essential a wooden boat filled with an array of sushi rolls (chef's choice) packed together. \u00a0It was well worth the price and offered us a wonderful sampling of their roles. \u00a0It was more than enough to fee us all, but we did add on the miso soup. \u00a0This would be a place we will definitely go to again on our next visit to Indianapolis."], ["Christin J.", "My favorite sushi in Indianapolis.

I started with a seaweed salad, which was good, and followed up with a dragon roll, which was not. The presentation was beautiful, the service was quick and friendly, but the quality of the eel left much to be desired. The eel, what little there was of it on the roll, was rubbery and not good at all. I managed to choke it down with lots of wasabi but was pretty bummed as I've had this roll here in the past and really liked it. I won't be ordering it again."], ["Joan D.", "Great sushi and we've always had great service here. Reasonable prices and large space, very good for groups."], ["Amanda B.", "Located in a strip mall, you wouldn't immediately think that it would have decent food, let alone raw fish.

The atmosphere is relaxing and the service is great. The entire staff does a nice job of making you feel welcome and that you're a priority. We had an appetizer of shumai (dumplings) which came quickly and were just the right temperature and delicious. The sushi was fantastic! We had the dynamite roll, the Tokyo roll, Angie's roll, and the spider roll. I'm pretty sure it took no more than 15 minutes for the two of us to devour everything! It's well worth the trip!"], ["Steve P.", "So my problem is that we wanted to take my sister out to her birthday dinner but \u00a0 \u00a0 she works early on Sunday so we wanted to go around 4:30 on a Saturday. So be ware...this and the original restaurant I wanted to attend..closed until 5PM. Now to the bad part. I am easy to please as a customer but first the service starts out with quickly getting some attention which was good...we got water. But then the girl dissappeared. Not like 5 minute...10 minute...15 minutes later she finally decides to come back and get our sushit order and we get a chance to get drinks. My wife and sister ordered drinks...both got something that tasted and looked much different than described. At this point I was just afraid to complain. No one there smiled...was pleasant or cordial in any way? Do they beat these people in the back room?30 minutes into being there we had sushi - keeping in mind, they had just opened. Not too busy. But gees...We had a sampling of 3 rolls and some nigiri. Honestly it was pretty good. But that was the end of anything good for me. My wife and I then also ordered a Happy Family dish with rice to split which comes with soup and salad- and my sister ordered the crab salad. My sister really liked her salad. But my salad..some almost wilted lettuce and a huge glut of ginger dressing made it the worst attempt at salad I ever had. This dish with inspection was half full under the lettuce with this very strongly spiced ginger dressing. I have had in my life many different versions of this before and I can promise without doubt - this was the worst. The soup...not much either - and I am thinking - geez...I brought my sister here for her birthday and she really is being a good soldier dealing with this...maybe because I am paying,...not sure...or that she is just a darn nice person. So this happy family meal comes...it is beef, chicken, and some seafood in a kind of stew with some pitiful scroungy veggies chopped into it. There were shrimp in this but I had one that was big and so old and chewy I could not get a chunk of this stuff down my throat. I mean down right gross and embarrassing. \u00a0Overall the two of us - my wife and I left over half of this $18 dish in the bowl and were disgusted. I gave this a 1 star for the sushi which is by my standards mediocre. Many places in Indy to get better. Service? It just was the worst. But honestly - the nice folks of Greenwood showed up there that night. But how long can you serve crappy food and offer crappy service and stay in business. I would say stay clear of this place. There are too many hard working business owners who deserve your money more than this place."], ["Ms W.", "It's a nice asian restaurant. The food is great! You won't regret coming.

For one, I do indeed get the same rolls, and I order large quantities of them, because quite frankly, it's delightful.You can do no wrong with delicious sashimi and rice, or dipping one of the fantastic rolls in soy. My favorites are the Pink Dragon roll and the Golden Cheese roll, and it is not a struggle to savor the deliciousness that comes with every bite. And make sure to have one of their Mai-Tais on hand to enjoy, because overall you're classy when it comes to having sushi and Mai-Tais!The staff at Ichiban are also extremely patient, helpful and kind. They suggest things that you may want to try, as well as work with you if you have dietary needs. From the outside, you may be confused that there is a treasure waiting for you.... Trust me, open the door and you'll find an exquisite gem that's hidden on the Southside, and you'll want to take advantage of it again and again."], ["Kim T.", "One of my favorite places to eat sushi.

I've been spending a lot of time there lately, and I was pleased to be informed that Ichiban was here amidst chain restaurants and car dealerships. Here is your quick rundown of Ichiban: cheap drinks, cheap appetizers, good midwest sushi, and a quiet atmosphere. Everything I've tried here has been great! I usually go for nigiri, and it's pretty difficult to mess that up. (Except if you are Bluefin Bistro in Lafayette). Pretty typical midwest sushi fare, if you haven't eaten sushi on a coast, you're not doing it right. Ichiban is a wonderful respite from the hub-hub of the people who don't know how to drive on the south side. Kick back with a tasty beverage, and eat yourself silly with healthy sushi."], ["Z.

Very surprised by this place being in greenwood."], ["Raina R.", "Yes, \u00a0Yelp, Ichiban is \"As good as it gets!\" I don't know if I've ever been as satisfied with sushi as I am EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I go to Ichiban. Let's run over the basics:Service: Excellent. Doesn't get better than this - servers are prompt with refilling drinks and being attentive, without being overbearing. They bring your food out to you as soon as it's ready. Check - when it's time. There's never a lull in your meal, they are perfect at managing the timing of your meal.Food: SO GOOD. The Special Rolls are a great combination of those types you'll generally find at sushi places to some unique creations. The I.I. Roll, Crazy Roll, Pink Dragon are a few of our favorites. The Crazy Roll is CRAZY good - we normally can't go in without ordering one. The prices are pretty comparable to most decent sushi in Indianapolis. We normally spend about $30-$40 for a dinner for 2.Ambiance/Decor/What Have You: Deceiving from the outside, the interior of Ichiban is spacious with a great variety of seating options. Good for an intimate dinner date or with a large group of people. Not too loud, not too quiet. Great sushi bar if that's your thing. The only critique, if I had one, is the full bar is a relatively new addition to Ichiban. Fortunately, the bartender was open to listening to how to make drinks how we preferred them and they turned out pretty decent. Take out? We do it all the time. Only about 15-20 minutes from your call to being able to pick up. When I initially moved to the south side, my local restaurant options diminished. Luckily, Ichiban makes up for many of that. It's \"as good as it gets!\""], ["David I.", "I've been here dozens of times and love it more every time I go. \u00a0They just finished a huge expansion and can seat very large groups now.We got our usual rolls this time, shrimp tempura and spicy scallop rolls. \u00a0The prices are very reasonable considering what some places charge.We always try to get something new when we go. \u00a0This time we got the Hot & Sour Soup, Clear Broth, and Dreaming Duck (I think that's the name) and all were just incredible. \u00a0It was the best duck I ever tasted, as was the Hot & Sour Soup. \u00a0The clear broth was just a little too salty, but that was a minor thing considering the quality of everything else."], ["Casey A.", "Absolute best sushi in Indiana!!!! Been coming here for over a year with my husband. It's definitely our favorite place to eat."], ["Anu G.", "The ambiance and presentation is great. The food was authentic and good. I went for dinner and the prices were little bit on the expensive side but that is ok for the good food they serve. My only negative comment is that the service is tooo slow.

Took my family of six for a birthday meal for my daughter. $150 for a meal that I could have gotten at a local buffet or at Panda Express. It was just plain awful. At most nice restaurants, a manager will at least inquire as to the satisfaction of your meal. Nothin'. A GREAT BIG disappointment."], ["Diana J.", "Some of the best sushi in town with reasonable pricing. Good crab Rangoon, gyoza, and teriyaki. Very reasonably priced martinis! My only complaint is it doesn't appear servers are assigned stations, so I get two different people coming out to get my drink or food order: service is friendly"], ["Brittany L.", "Ichiban is located in a nondescript shopping plaza, but the interior of the restaurants lends itself to a special and intimate experience. Seating seems tight at first glance, but our two person booth seemed private, even though we were close to other tables. There is a beautiful full service bar with plenty of seating, as well as private back rooms for small parties. We arrived around 7 p.m., on a Friday night, and had no wait, but we noticed the line grew rapidly, shortly after we were seated, and soon there was a crowd waiting at the door. We did not feel rushed by our server, at all, though. She let us take our time and enjoy our meal without pressuring us to turn the table over. \u00a0Traditional Japanese aesthetics enhance your experience at Ichiban, but the real reason to visit is the amazing food. Upon first glace, I was surprised at how reasonable all of the prices seemed (extremely inexpensive compared to a place like Naked Chopstix on the North side.) We used my groupon for $24/food for $12, and we ended up spending about $15 over that, for everything including drinks.My boyfriend and I chose to taste a variety of items from the menu, starting with the vegetable tempura to share, and the house beer and wine. The tempura warm and delicious, and the vegetables inside were cooked perfectly. Soft enough, but still fresh and crisp tasting. The wine was average, typical Chardonnay served at most places. My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his Sapporo beer. We then moved onto cold sake and our sushi. The sake was served in a small bottle, with a tiny glass for drinking, and in a much larger quantity than we anticipated. Share it if you're drinking lightly. It was light and refreshing. Our first sushi selection included Nagiri sushi, the tuna and the yellowtail. Unbelievable flavor for such a simple dish. The fish tasted so fresh, it's as if you weren't eating it in central Indiana. Moving onto the sushi rolls, we chose the Philadelphia and the Spicy Salmon rolls. Both were out of this world, with a small amount of wasabi and pickled radish. I would enthusiastically recommend each of these rolls. We were absolutely stuffed at this point, so we couldn't try another roll, like we wanted, but we'll certainly be back soon to try more.We've definitely found a new local favorite in Ichiban."], ["Chyna M.", "I hate the fact that Ichiban is hidden away in a crappy little shopping center. Its totally off-putting until you walk in. The inside however, is gorgeous and has a very romantic feel between the lighting and Japanese decor. I usually come here for their lunch special: 2 sushi rolls, soup, and salad for just $8. The ginger dressing on their salad is wonderful. They also have half price sushi on Mondays. If you're going to get a lot of sushi though, their \"Love Boat\" is the way to go. Its literally a boat full of all the sushi you could ever want and it fed my party of 4. In a lot of sushi restaurants, I've found that they don't roll their sushi tight enough or maybe that their rice isn't moist enough...the point is, it falls apart.

The miso salmon tasted fishy but the teriyaki salmon was delicious. We liked the Queens prawn but it had hardly any asparagus, although lots of extra yummy veggies. \u00a0The sushi was rather bland and had very lttle ginger. \u00a0I didn't get any tea refill nor was I asked, but to be fair it was Christmas Eve and there seemed to be very little staff. \u00a0Probabaly won't go back. \u00a0We have three excellent Japanese resturants in Columbus and one pretty decent fusion place as well."], ["Tim G.", "My search for good Japanese food continues, and today it has brought me to Ichiban. Nicely decorated, spacious, and very relaxed, Ichiban makes some really great entrees an some good sushi.The staff was friendly and attentive, and from what I could hear, very helpful in explaining and recommending dishes. There appeared to be a lot of first time patrons the night we went, so I heard many questions about why certain things are. I don't know if that's a normal thing, but I was more comfortable eating there knowing that there was a healthy stream of customers (and not completely empty like other places I've been to).The main entrees was pretty delicious. I very much enjoyed the Grilled Hamachi Kama that I ordered. It was tasty and the portion size was larger than a normal Japanese establishment. I do have to knock off a few points for the sushi though. Most of the main ingredients of the sushi seemed less inspired and bland than they should be (the spicy tuna leaves much to be desired). I have to say that I enjoyed the main course much more than the sushi.This is definitely one of the better Japanese food establishments here in Indianapolis. Probably my favorite at the moment, and I will definitely be back."], ["Lisa M.", "This was 2nd time here. Thought I would give it another try due to all the great reviews.

Confusing? It was to me as well until I really started to look at the menu and realized that most of the options were made with imitation crab meat, salmon or tuna. The menu consists almost entirely of rolls. There are create your own options as well as 10 or so suggested options. Step up to the counter, place your order, watch them make your roll, and grab a table. It kind of reminded me of a Subway Sandwich Shop with sushi instead of subs.I went with the Spicy Salmon and the Spicy Tuna Roll. Both were quite large and I probably could have eaten just one and still felt like I had enough to eat. I think each roll was 9 or 10 pieces, which is a tad larger than the more traditional sushi places I've been. I used my Yelp check in for a miso soup and also grabbed a beer and paid about $23 for my meal, which I think was a tad pricy for what I ended up with.Being close to IUPUI and all of the hospitals, I'm sure they have a pretty good lunch business. There really aren't a ton of sushi places downtown, especially which serves sushi in a \"fast food\" type atmosphere like they do here. I'd glad to have given this place a try since it's been on my list for some time now, but I think I'm good crossing it off and checking out another place next time."], ["Sara P.", "I typically order the Wicked Spicy Tuna signature roll, minus the spicy mayo BOSS sauce. It has all the ingredients that I would order with the create-your-own option anyways (avocado, cucumber & green onion). And of Sushi Boss's signature rolls, it's the least Americanized of the rolls, i.e. no crunchies, imitation crab, cooked ingredients, etc. \u00a0What I like about Sushi Boss is that I get about twice the amount of raw tuna that you'd receive in grocery-store offerings, at the same price...and it is twice as fresh. \u00a0I also sometimes order the seaweed side salad, which appears to be a deceptively large portion for the price; however, underneath the seaweed is a hidden bed of crispy shredded lettuce & carrot slaw. I would not say Sushi Boss is a date-night location or the best local sushi (*cough* Sakura..Sushi Bar*), but it is a clean, fast-casual place with friendly staff. \u00a0It's difficult to avoid the temptation of the 10th St & Indiana Ave eateries during the work commute home. But if you are attempting to eat healthier, Sushi Boss offers an excellent alternative and will assist in conquering your quesarito habit."], ["Maria B.", "My husband and I stopped by here after reading a couple yelp reviews- at first I thought \"ok... how good can fast sushi be?\"Turns out it's really good!!

I love every roll that I've tried, and I've tried more than I'm willing to admit. The location is super close to me, just a couple blocks from the canal in downtown Indy. If you're looking for the very best sushi in downtown Indy, you'll have to fork out some more money. However, if you are a sushi enthusiast that wants to get your fix without breaking the bank, this will definitely get the job done."], ["Melissa K.", "This is my favorite restaurant in the IUPUI area! I will start out by saying although I enjoy the taste of sushi, I do not really approve of raw sushi because in my line of work, I know about all of the nasty critters you can get from raw food. Ick. But Sushi Boss is faaaaaaaar from ick. I love this place because they have COOKED sushi (and raw too)! \u00a0The have a lot of options (crab sticks, spicy crab mix, shrimp, chicken, beef....). You can order one of the rolls on their menu (the California roll, Surf and Turf, and That One Roll are all delicious) or make your own. They have a lot of ingredients to choose from. Do not get confused by ordering one roll at a time. At a lot of sushi places one roll=one piece of sushi. Here one roll=the entire rolled up sushi roll. They are then cut into smaller pieces/rolls for you to eat. Here is where my one criticism is...sometimes the cuts are very inconsistent, and you may end up with a teeny roll and then a ginormous roll you nearly choke on because it's too big. Depending on what the roll is loaded with, it is usually enough for lunch. Sometimes I order a side item. The edamame is good, and they also have soups, salads, and mochi. The staff is also really wonderful, and the restaurant is very clean. I \u00a0really hope they open up more locations (Northside hint hint)!"], ["Dara H.", "Amazing Sushi!!This was our first trip here. We ordered 2 rolls each and that was way too much food. The rolls are 12 pcs. I am use to the 8 pcs rolls. You can choose to create your own or they have Signature rolls. It was pretty busy in the restaurant so we decided to just get signature rolls. Kyle picked the California $6.49. It had crab avocado cucumber and sesame seed. He added the Boss sauce aka spicy mayo. And he also got the Wicked spicy tuna $7.49. It has the spicy tuna cucumber green onion avocado boss sauce & sesame seeds. He enjoyed both rolls but said the tuna was pretty spicy.I picked the Crunchy Roll $8.49. It was a larger roll. It had \u00a0shredded crab avocado cucumber fried onions and not sure what sauce. My other roll was the Surf & Turf $9.29. It was short rib crab cucumber asparagus wasabi mayo yakisoba sauce and sesame chili. Sooo good!! Next time we want to create our own. You get to pick your wrapper. Seaweed or soy. (The soy looks like green tissue paper) Add a protein or just go veggie. Then you pick the produce you want up to 3. Then top it off with sauces.They also have sides like salads and soup. And a beer and wine menu.Cant wait to go back and try something different."], ["Stephanie J.", "Great place for some lunch time sushi! Very friendly staff, generous roll size.

There has been a need for this niche for those of us that want sushi, but maybe don't have time to sit down at a restaurant and don't want to sacrifice the quality by getting grocery store sushi.Very reasonably priced, you can get a full priced speciality roll for around $7. They also have other sushi pairing favorites like miso soup and edamame. The setup is very much like a Subway where you can see your roll being assembled. You can even create your own roll and pick out the sauces.

I have become a sushi boss regular and I feel I have a few confessions. Their quick, friendly and efficient service makes me often come here for lunch.

I think the shrimpin ain't easy is an absolute delight with aspergus in it. I have been experimenting as well and I love the rolls that I designed myself!

Fresh veggies to choose from, sauces a many, \u00a0and they roll it for you right on the spot. The portions are HUGE and the prices are small. Only down side and its not even a huge deal. The fish isn't as fresh as I'd like it. I understand that Indiana is landlocked so fresh salmon isn't easy. So, absolutely an understandable shortfall. As far as sushi goes, though, awesome.

In a GOOD way. \u00a0You can choose from one of their signature rolls or even create your own roll (Subway style!). \u00a0The rolls are HUGE (10-12 good sized pieces) and perfect for one person or to get 2 and share with a friend. ** My very favorite part is that you can get a roll made \"half and half\" -- which is amazing when you are as indecisive as me. \u00a0This means that should you not be able to choose, you can do 2 rolls and get a total of 4 different tastes! \u00a0What?!?! Amazing stuff here, folks! **I have tried a few different variations but have come back to a few favorites: \u00a0the smoked salmon (build my own with avocado, asparagus, and cucumber, boss sauce, yakisoba, and tempura sprinkles), and the Shrimpin' Ain't Easy (specialty roll with shrimp tempura, avocado, asparagus, boss sauce, sesame seeds). Try the Surf and Turf specialty roll if you are feeling like something non-traditional (beef short rib meat, crab, cucumber, asparagus, wasabi mayo, yakisoba sauce and sesame chili) -- it is REALLY good. I can also say their soups are good -- even after a long drive home. \u00a0Friday is half-price saki bomb day and I believe they do half price beers on the weekends. I always take my Sushi Boss to go, but will have to eat in and check these specials out some time. \u00a0The staff here is always super nice and helpful. \u00a0Today they even offered me a sample of the \"crunch roll\" while in line as it was the roll of the week. \u00a0Just good peeps.

Alright lets do this right. The concept is super nice. Who hasn't always wanted to choose exactly what goes into their sushi roll? As far as sushi snobs are concerned you are not going to get a super mind blowing, or life altering sushi experience here. The quality of their product is not terrible but it is not the best I have ever had. The price point is not too offensive though so I feel like in this case you get what you pay for. Service: There was this guy there who was super helpful and extremely efficient. Some of the other guys seemed a little new but this place did just open up recently so I'm sure that's what's up here. However the service was pleasant. I think the roll we tried was called \"That Roll\". Now don't quote me on this however I believe that is the one with the braised short rib. I have had sushi with cooked chicken in it plenty of times. This roll was fire and probably why I give this place 4 stars. This roll is so unique and delicious. Give it a try."], ["Mirabelle L.", "It's fast food style but for sushi rolls. I honestly think that they did a great job in operating its business. They are efficient in making sushi so the wait time is minimized. Food is fresh, delicious, and satisfying. We had that one roll (with asparagus and beef), spicy salmon roll, and crunchy roll. I liked them all! My favorite is the spicy salmon roll. That one roll is very yummy, but way too spicy for me. Service is okay but could be improved. Overall, for its price and offering, I would recommend this place to anyone in the area. It's worth a try!"], ["Liz S.", "So GOOD sushi is hard to come by.

Yes, I'm lazy.)So when I kept reading, \"Sushi Boss is like the Subway of sushi..in a good way\"-- I just had to try it! My coworker and I needed a quick lunch break and stopped by around 11am--which is perfect because they were quiet enough for us to gather our thoughts around a \"make your own combination sushi\" restaurant vs. the ol' menu items. We went boring and got the \"Shrimpin' ain't easy\" and \"That one roll\". Both were insanely delicious and tasted pretty fresh! I forget what we're in both but the menu has it listed! We also got the spicy edamame--not the greatest but it was okay! (My fave is at Cheesecake Factory, weird but whatever.)The restaurant is simple, but I really like that! I really don't want to be cluttered with bonzai trees, cherry blossom screen doors and random kitschy Japanese stuff.

All in all, I say successful trip and I would definitely go back!"], ["Cammie W.", "This is like the sushi version of Chipotle, which is a pretty cool concept. They have a machine that presses the rice onto your seaweed (or soy wrap). There are also 'Signature Rolls', but they're pretty much the same price as choosing the ingredients separately. This is a great place to go for lunch if you're craving sushi and don't have much time. Their seating area is pretty big and when I went on a Friday afternoon, there were only 2 other customers. The employees were super nice; I'm giving this place an extra star just because of that.I made a custom roll for $7.59, which was cut into 10 pieces. They were cut a bit too thick, which made it impossible for me to put a whole piece into my mouth. My roll left me satisfied but not full. I would definitely need to have something else if I came in really hungry. My dine-in order came in a plastic tray and a liner like the type you get at sandwich places. I wish they would use plates instead because that tiny touch would (to me) make it seem less like a fast food place. I really enjoyed the Boss Sauce which is apparently just spicy mayo. I could taste the fattiness and unhealthiness of it though; definitely not something to get every day. The spicy tuna also tasted pretty fresh despite the lack of other customers.

I was missing the dining experience of an authentic sushi restaurant. It was a pretty good experience for my first visit to Indianapolis."], ["Ashlee A.", "I've been trying to get my boyfriend to go with me to Sushi Boss ever since I found out about it a couple of months ago. Dinner and catch-up with a friend that lives in the area provided the perfect excuse to finally go. I wasn't expecting anything mindblowing, but considering the idea behind the place, it kind of is. People always talk about how it's like Subway for sushi, and I agree with that. Sort of. Yes, you can build your own roll or pick from their predetermined ones. Yes, they make it in front of you. Yes, your sushi is in front of you, ready to be eaten in less than five minutes. However, when I think Subway, I think ingredients that were prepared yesterday. This was not that.I got the Spicy Salmon Crunch roll with a side of miso soup. It has their spicy salmon mix, cream cheese, carrots, and green onion on the inside. The outside has their \"BOSS Sauce\" (spicy mayo), tempura crunch, and sesame seeds. It was delicious, and it was huge. If you like salmon rolls and can handle the heat, I'd definitely recommend it, even if you're not a huge carrot fan (see: me).The miso soup was pretty good, though I don't think it was anything more fancy than a miso paste with dashi mixed in with water. Not bad, but while I normally finish my miso soup in about two seconds flat, I had to sort of make myself finish it. The tofu was a bit tougher than I'm used to having in miso soup, but that could have just been the firmness rather than anything else. I have no complaints about the seaweed in it though. All in all, quite good but not must have.My only complaint is the vehicle in which to dip your sushi into soy sauce. They use sauce cups (think marinara cups from the pizza shop), but the rolls are so fat that you have to sort of squish them to get any amount of soy sauce on your roll, and then if you're not careful it can almost be too much.All in all, the employee we talked to very nearly hit it on the head: \"You've arrived at your new home.\" If I'm in the area and craving sushi, I definitely won't hesitate to stop into Sushi Boss."], ["Ntianu S.", "A friend and I decided to stop in for a quick bite to eat before heading out to celebrate the New Year.

Plus, I was starvin'! I don't make decisions very well on an empty stomach. The guy who waited on us was friendly, knowledgable, funny, and provided us with samples of their popular rolls and soups. Best service I've experienced in quite some time. In regards to the menu, you are able to select from the signature sushi menu or you can build your own. When you build your own roll you select the wrap, protein, veggies, and sauce. I wasn't feeling adventurous so I ordered the Crunchy Roll, which I initially sampled and thought was freaking fantastic, and the Shrimpin' Ain't Easy. They also offered soups. I sampled the onion and miso soup. Both were good. For a few bucks more I ordered a combo which included a drink and cup of soup. For two rolls, a drink, and a cup of soup I spent 21 dollars and some change. I really like the decor. It is simply and nicely decorated and almost makes you forget that you are in a fast food joint. All in all I had a great experience. The Crunchy Roll was by far my favorite. The shrimp roll was just ok. For some reason the seaweed was extremely chewy making it hard to fully enjoy. All in all I would definitely return so that I can \u00a0explore the menu and build my own.

I could see someone being disappointed if they don't know what they like and try to be too adventurous. Luckily, if you're that guy, they have house rolls that you can order to ensure a good sushi experience. All the ingredients we had on our rolls were fresh and tasted great. The miso soup and salad were also good, albeit nothing special. While the quality overall isn't gourmet, I believe the price reflects that (three rolls, two drinks, a soup and a salad for about $30? I'll take it!). The staff was also very helpful and guided us through the whole process since it was our first time.

It isn't on the menu, but it is fire. Hit these guys up if you want to eat real good Sushi."], ["Garvy S.", "So glad a sushi place opened right next to IUPUI and downtown indy!! Been wanting to try this place since there rolling soon banner sign was up. Went in here for the first time today for take out lunch and it was such a nice looking restaurant. I already knew what I wanted from studying there menu on Facebook. I got the signature rolls cause I really get Indecisive what toppings I want. I got the CA rolls and spicy tuna crunch for the boyfriend. And I made sure they put all that boss sauce which is spicy mayo I believe. It was the bomb!!! I just found my new go to sushi place. And not bad all for 15 bucks! We couldn't finish it all, it was a total of 10 rolls so next time I'll get just one for lunch break to split with the bf. overall love this place! I get sushi cravings all the time and it seems like I can't find one in reasonable distance now I have one I can literally walk too."], ["Ron R.", "This place has a neat concept for sure. \u00a0Think Chipotle/Qdoba/Subway/Piada but with Sushi. \u00a0You order the type of roll, and pick a protein. \u00a0You then pick up to 3 veggies to fill inside. \u00a0After that you pick toppings and bam...you have your custom order sushi roll right away.I highly recommend checking this place out because of the nifty idea. \u00a0That being said...the sushi was mediocre. \u00a0I would compare it to grocery store sushi which isn't awful...but by no means would I pay 8-10$ a roll for. \u00a0You also lose some of the magic that goes hand in hand with going to a sushi place. \u00a0It is fast casual which just doesn't seem to vibe well with the romantic stigma of a sushi restaurant.I'd be hard pressed to come back."], ["Felicia D.", "I suppose I should start with the good! The green tea Kit Kat bars found by the register are amaaaaazing... so amazing that I did a little dance. Everything else was, well... not so amazing. I'm sure it works well for those on campus at IUPUI for a quick sushi fix, but it just wasn't very delicious. It lacked flavor. The rice was a bit too sticky. I like the ability to build my own roll, but I tried one of the signature rolls. It had shrimp tempura. I don't remember what it was called - that's how underwhelming it was. This experience made me sad, but I thank them for introducing me to that green tea Kit Kat."], ["Krzysztof K.", "The Crunchy Roll and That One Roll were exquisite. They have rolls for sushi enthusiast or just a casual friend that might not enjoy raw fish. Think of it as a subway or chipotle for sushi. You walk up and order and follow the construction line. I recommend it to anyone seeking a unique experience."], ["Maya H.", "This is basically a subway-style sushi restaurant. I really like their \"roll of the month\" I forget what it's called right now, but it was great. The service was okay.They do have some imported sodas and teas. I didn't like the miso soup though- it tasted bland and pre-made, like those boxed ones where you just add water. I would recommend skipping the \"2.99 and add soup and a drink\" because of this. I would recommend it if you're craving sushi and you want it fast. However if you are hoping for high quality at a low price you are not going to get it. This sushi is a step above supermarket quality at supermarket prices- if you expect anything better you will probably be disappointed. Please note that while they DO have eel sauce they do not have actual eel sushi! I was a little disappointed. But they said they were trying to work out a way to be able to offer it in the future, since that's a popular sushi order."], ["Julia G.", "Pretty cool sushi place that is kind of akin to a subway or chipotle but for sushi rolls. Pick your wrap, your protein, and veggies/toppings. Pretty big roll 10-12 pieces, plenty for a meal. Has a fast foodish feel. I like the concept for a quick lunch or take out. Would definitely recommend it for that. Its quite good for what it is. Not the greatest sushi I've had, not somewhere to go on a date or to sit down for dinner."], ["Audrey S.", "First, let me say that the food was fantastic, the man made wonderful concoction of flavor. The following is my experience:This was my first visit to Sushi Boss and I wasn't quite sure what to order, I was sort of staring blankly at the menu when a gentleman approached me and asked how I was doing and if he could be of any help. I explained to him that it was my first time in the restaurant and that I wanted something sort of particular. He asked me to describe it (which honestly, I think I said \"crunchy, well and spicy, maybe only crunchy on the inside, with mangoes, well I don't really remember!\" The man started to work and I came out not only with a nice looking BUT seriously delicious sushi roll! It was just what I had wanted! The service was sincerely great, the workers were all very positive and polite, and the man who waited on me was especially patient and kind. I will most definitely go back there, and now that I know that is so close to my office I will be a repeat customer! Thanks so much for such a quality experience and a great meal!"], ["Laurel F.", "Delicious!! Create your own or try one of their signature rolls. The Rainbow Roll and The Crunchy Roll are my favorites. Made fresh in front of you, convenient location and sake, beer and wine are all available! Don't be deceived by the Subway style ordering and casual atmosphere - it's some of the best sushi I've had and plan to frequent it for lunch on days I work!!"], ["Audrey C.", "First off, the customer service is amazing. Every employee is polite and has a smile on their face. Secondly, the food is amazing. Everything is fresh and delicious. For it being 'express' sushi, they put all the effort into making the perfect roll to your liking. Love the delivery feature and love the affordability of some good sushi!"], ["Dan C.", "Great food, can choose your own meat and veggies in the roll, awesome sauces. Definitely recommend this place!"], ["Josh B.", "Incredible sushi. \u00a0You can design topper own rolls here, and it's very reasonably priced. \u00a0Every time I drive through Indy, this is a must have stop."], ["Kristina H.", "This place is the best as far as u want it they make it I could only wish there was a chain of these since I'm visiting from out of state!!!! We went right before closing and the one guy was amazing sweet and very helpful but the other guy felt and acted pretty annoyed about us coming in close to close and and j get that but then people walked in after us too I just thought it looked bad seeing we were first timers(hints the 4stars) but as far as being an awesome ....u can't go wrong create it yourself it was fantastic"], ["Bawi M.", "I love this place, it is very clean and their Sushi are so delicious.it's very nice that you can create your own roll or choose from one of their signature rolls.They also have soup and it is very good.5 STARS !!"], ["Melissa E.", "I was pleasantly surprised!! Walking in, I thought it was going to be mediocre \"grocery store\" quality sushi. I. Was. Wrong. Fresh and fun to make your own, although I recommend their signature \"crunchy roll\". Travis and team were helpful and nice. Great great taste with a comfortable price!"], ["Tommy C.", "I'm not a sushi expert, but I do know good music when I hear it. They are currently playing a non-typical RHCP song, and before it was some dope oriental downtempo stuff. Not too loud, and just enough to jam."], ["Sarah C.", "I have been to Sushi Boss twice in the last week for lunch. I am addicted :) The staff is super friendly and inviting! Also, the service is fast and makes it perfect for a quick lunch. This place has high quality sushi for an affordable price.Highlights:*You can build your own sushi roll*Free parking*Lunch combo option (add a soup or salad to your roll)"], ["Ericka J.", "This was my first time trying them out. Customer service was great, taste was wonderful, and I like that they have signature rolls as well as build-your-own. Will definitely be back...with friends!"], ["Miguel F.", "Great idea for a sushi place. As many other reviews point out: its quick, easy, affordable, completely customizable. I ordered a yellowtail roll with cucumber, avocado, and green onion. Got to the table, excitedly bit into my first piece and..... Meh.My wife and I love sushi and have been to most sushi places in the city. For us, this place just wasn't anything special. Overall we would describe the taste of the rolls we ordered as bland. However, if you usually like rolls (over nigiri, sashimi, etc.) Americanized sushi, sushi with a lot of sauce, etc., then you will probably love this place. It just isn't our thing and the quality of the sushi is not what we are used to. I really wish that the quality was a bit better, however, so personally I will not be back.*Edit:I am taking back a star after seeing that the owner's wife, Amber S., left a review pretending to be a customer to inflate their restaurant's rating...ummmmm what? \u00a0Whatever happened to fair and non biased? \u00a0It is against Yelp's content guidelines to review your own restaurant!Also, when I first left my review, the owner messaged me trying to guilt-trip me into changing my review by saying he would refund my money AND pay for any food I would get on a return visit....I am now completely appalled by the tactics this restaurant's owner is using to buff up his rating on Yelp...ugh."], ["Bryson S.", "Such good sushi!!!! You can customize your own, or do a signature that is AMAZING! Each roll has ten pieces so you can get half & half of a roll. The best part is it is extremely affordable without degrading the quality. My boyfriend and I each got a roll, he got edamame and I had a salad(amazing ginger dressing by the way) and we both had a drink... For $25!! Crazy. Locally owned in a heart of corporations and chains, extremely friendly staff, great hours. So so lovely! This place needs to stay open, so go!"], ["Tamara Q.", "As someone who has consumed her fair share of sushi, I feel that I can be quite picky about what is good and acceptable sushi. However, I will pay for different tiers \u00a0of sushi ranging from grocery store to truly expensive chef prepared type. For a fast food sushi place, this joint is legit. I ordered two rolls with expectations that I might still be hungry afterwards, but I was truly surprised. The portions are generous and the fish in the sushi is actually pretty standard servings. They use a ice cream scooper type to make each roll so it's a good amount. These rolls are probably in between grocery store and restaurant made. I would definitely come here again for a quick lunch!"], ["Jennifer H.", "This is basically a qdoba-type sushi restaurant - your rolls are freshly made in front of you and you can choose what ingredients you want to add. \u00a0I've only had the veggie sushi and it was pretty good and you get a lot for your money. \u00a0The veggie of the month in September was fried sweet potato - very good! \u00a0It would be nice if they had a fried / tempura style veggie every month. \u00a0The boss sauce is tasty, soup and salad also good - definitely worth a trip!"], ["Laura P.", "I kept seeing posts on Facebook about this place getting ready to open. So I came in on day 2 I believe & \u00a0ordered 2 rolls for myself and a coworker. I was extremely pleased with the quality, price & quantity. A few days later one of my friends wanted to check it out & a had the Surf and Turf roll. So far, it's my favorite. Both times I was offered a sample of their soups (which I I'll try in the cooler season.) Clean, friendly, custom, great price."], ["Chase B.", "Sushi Boss is: super fast, delicious, and cheap! You custom order your roll, just like ordering a sub at subway. The rolls are all large 10 piece rolls and most priced at $7.50/roll. If you have a big appetite, you might want 2 rolls. My girlfriend and I order 1 roll each and we're totally satisfied. They have drink specials on the weekend, including $1.50 domestic beer on Saturday's! I eat at Indy sushi places all the time. Sushi Boss moved to the top of my favorite's list."], ["Cole U.", "My wife and I were pulling into Blaze Pizza and happened to see this place across the parking lot. I was craving sushi anyway, so we checked it out. \u00a0We loved it! We had two signature rolls, one custom roll, and two bowls of soup, and I would equate the quality with a lot of \"upscale\" sushi places at which I've spent twice as much for smaller rolls than I did here. \u00a0The rolls are totally customizable (picture blaze, qdoba, subway, etc), and the service is quick and very friendly. \u00a0I thought it was a franchise at first, but we talked to (who we think was) the owner, and found out it's independently owned and operated. \u00a0Great idea, great place - we'll be back."], ["Jessica P.", "Oh my gosh you guys, you know how you normally order a few sushi rolls for dinner because that's how much you need to be full. DON'T DO THAT HERE. Seriously. These rolls are HUGE. We went for dinner the other day and thought, oh we'll get 2 rolls each and some edamame, that's a perfect dinner. Whoa. We took home more than half. They have perfect sized combos of a roll, miso soup or edamame, and a drink. Do that, it will be perfect (and super affordable!). We went with the signature rolls this time but in the future, I'm excited to build my own. This place was really great and I'll be coming back for sure!"], ["Ericka D.", "The staff here is incredibly friendly and the ingredients are fresh. Also it's a great place for people who aren't sure about sushi."], ["Nicole K.", "Great new sushi place in Indy! It's like Subway for sushi. Pick your wrap, ingredients and toppings and they make it right in front of you. They also have special house rolls as well. They were delicious; very unique. We had a roll with chicken, and one with short rib that were both great. Staff was very friendly and attentive. Also the rolls were huge, there were 3 of us and we ordered 5 rolls and barely got through half of them. Usually you get 6 pieces a roll but we got 10 with all of these rolls. You have to check it out! They'll also have their liquor license next week so there's another reason to stop by!"], ["Eric B.", "It's Chipotle meets Japanese. Quality ingredients, build your own roll or tweak one of their signature rolls. It was recommended to me by a friend and it did not disappoint. Their extensive menu would be ideal for catering with options for all taste."]]}
