It was in a soy wrapper and had a great mix of avocado, and salmon, tuna, and yellow tail.I got it Togo, and they packed everything perfectly with enough sauces for the meal.The only reason why this wouldn't be a 5 is that the rice had a little bit of a bite to it. So either it was prepared ahead of time or the rice was slightly undercooked. I want to come back and try their bubble teas!"], ["Raechel A.", "Hey, hey, hey! Whaddya say? Bento box cafe! Right down the way.It's Friday and I'm rhyming. Get over it. Bottom line, I'm super stoked that I found this place because they have my Dragon roll WITH sides for only $10. Um yeah, I'm definitely a fan.I typically bring my lunch to work, but one day I forgot it. That gave me the opportunity to search out a lunch spot nearby. Sushi was on my mind for a while, so I hopped on Yelp to find me some. I've been to a couple sushi places downtown, but I haven't been to the Bento Asian Bistro yet. As I looked at the online menu, I was happy to discover a bento box with sushi as well as some really yummy-looking bubble teas. Oh yeah, I'm there.It's a small cafe-style restaurant in the corner of the Indiana Street plaza, near the Noodles & Co. The interior is quite nice with plush, leather seating, chairs, booths and bar seating on the back wall. The menu is fairly simple, nothing like that thing you have to read at a typical Chinese restaurant. My order took about 10 minutes to come out, and it was lovely! The bento box consisted of the sushi roll, a ginger salad, a spring roll and a crab wonton in some duck sauce, and a little pickled ginger and wasabi on the side. I gobbled it all up like it was going out of style! My Dragon roll and the salad were very good. The warm spring roll and crab wonton in duck sauce was so good! I wanted to get more, but there's a $5 limit for cards and I don't carry cash. Oh well, maybe next time.I also didn't get a chance to try the bubble tea, but they have many flavors and boba options. Regular bubble tea with tapioca boba, red tea with pop boba, and green tea with fruit jelly. I'm going to try the milk tea or the coconut tea with tapioca pearls. LOVE those! Not a fan of the fruity ones. They also serve smoothies and coffee slushies. Sounds interesting. I wish I knew about this place when I was in college because I think it's a really great addition for students and downtown workers to go for an affordable sushi lunch. I'll definitely be back for some more sushi and some bubble tea. Oh wait, I don't have to go back because...they deliver!"], ["Jake D.", "Stop, wait, turn around. Put down the phone / Don't go here. Panda Express is right beside it. China Star is a few blocks downtown... Naisa is maybe a 10-15 minute drive. Go to all of those places instead.The thing about this review is that I seriously had such low standards. I hadn't eaten in many, many hours and I had recently finished a workout. I would have eaten anything, but I decided to try a new place: Bento Asian Bistro.Bad decision. I called for carry out and they told me it was a 10 minute wait. It had been about 15 or 20 by the time that I had gotten to the restaurant and I still had to wait 10 minutes more.I ordered General Tso and hated it. I didn't finish half of it, throwing away the rest. Rice was bland, chicken was awful. The place seemed full - plenty of people were seated and eating. I'm so confused as to why. Never again. =/"], ["Jim M.", "Quick Asian food - red tea with passion was very refreshing and the yaki-udon shrimp was better than expected but the shrimp were just a tad too done."], ["Zenobia W.", "The idea of this place is very appealing, but l can't see myself returning. Cheap, quick sushi and boba? Sure! But the execution of their food is sub-par at most. The non-sushi food options are pretty much comparable to your average Americanized Chinese restaurant. Very oily and often deep-fried, followed by that joyously inevitable belly ache. I'm a frequent buyer of boba elsewhere, and that was probably the only decent thing I had here. Decent, not great though. Nothing felt fresh and there weren't any distinct Asian flavors.Side note: I don't know if it was OrderUp's problem or Bento, but the delivery experience wasn't the best. Maybe the guy was new? I had ordered to have something to be delivered to work, because I couldn't get away for a break and it took over an hour (which I was willing to brush aside). But when the delivery guy finally showed up, he said I had to come down to grab my stuff and I said I couldn't because of work (the whole point in ordering online)... Then he argued with me on the phone and hung up, so I ended up having to run outside on Monument Circle to look for him and get my food... Yikes. :/"], ["Nicole L.", "Fun, trendy, great food.This is a good addition to the developing complex of restaurants near IUPUI.I haven't tried the sushi yet, but did get a chicken teriyaki bento box that was excellent.The service was great, the prices were reasonable, and if you're a student they accept jag as currency."], ["Cammie W.", "I don't have a strong opinion about their food yet but I definitely prefer their rice over Sushi Boss' rice a few doors down. It's cheaper than Marsh's sushi for what you get. However, I wouldn't recommend this place over Marsh yet. I still suggest giving it a chance.They have a lot of different bento boxes to choose from. You're not limited to just Japanese style cooked meats; they have choices from other Asian cuisines as well. I wish there were more options without the cream cheese wonton, though. They also have \"Special Roll Bento Boxes\" which comes with a salad, an egg roll, and a cream cheese wonton. You can get just the roll without any of the sides for $2 cheaper. There is also an Indianapolis Roll, which I would have gotten if it didn't contain cream cheese and the entire roll wasn't fried (figures).I ordered a Thai Iced Tea with Boba. It had too much cream/milk in it and there was no detectable tea flavor at all. The boba was a tad bit too mushy on the outside, but still decent. I haven't had better boba since I got to Indiana so I don't know if that's just how people prefer it here.I got my roll To Go. They placed it in a nice plastic sushi container in a gigantic paper bag. They stapled the paper bag together with a menu and another copy of the receipt. Then they placed everything into a plastic bag. The environmentally conscious side of me thinks that's a bit too excessive but they did make it look nice & neat. I also walked from the restaurant and at no point was I worried about my roll getting messed up.I ordered the Manhattan Roll which has shrimp tempura and avocado on the inside and spicy tuna on the top (along with 2 sauces). My roll was made fresh but the tempura was old and a little bit mushy. The spicy tuna was not spicy at all and too warm. I walked maybe 3-4 minutes to my destination in 50 degree weather so the tuna should not have been anywhere close to as warm as it was.The cashier that helped me was super nice. I definitely want to come again and try their regular bento boxes. I'm also interested in how their Pad Thai is, but the picture on the menu isn't the most appealing."], ["Jade C.", "Calm down on the soy sauce!Whatever you do, do NOT get the chicken basil bento combo. It was extremely salty to the point where every bite felt like torture. It's like they marinated and cooked it in soy sauce. I expected more from what seemed to be an authentic Chinese cafe and for $8.50. Unfortunately I didn't ask for it to be recooked because I was so damn hungry and in a hurry.

The restaurant is nothing special - the inside is clean enough, but the counter where you place your order is a bit disorganized and chaotic. There's a good amount of seating, but it seems like it fills up a bit at lunch. The food itself is maybe ok to pretty good. We both had the teriyaki chicken bento box and, while it fit the bill, it definitely didn't impress. Overall it was a lunch that was good enough to get the job done, but I wouldn't make a point to go here on the regular."], ["Marvi B.", "Is it me or there's too much Asian food where I live. Well probably not their fault! I first went to this place a few days after it opened. Matter of fact I like how the service was courteous and efficient. This is a medium sized place that opened where previously Einstein bro bagels was. The whole idea of Asian fusion is having all major Asian food types under one roof in one bento box! It's actually very clever especially if you are selling Asian food in an area where you already have 4 places that serve Asian food. However now comes the part where it makes me give them 3 stars. It's the idea of fusion that's excellent, the food however is pretty average.I have had almost all their bento combinations. It's decent as long as it's warm like any other Chinese entree. The sushi is actually very average. I was very excited initially but now I'd much rather avoid the fusion and stick with the culture I'm craving the most. Pricing is very good however and they deliver as well I asked them."], ["Somatic Dye S.", "I got basil shrimp! It was very salty. The food is not that good. Bubble tea is okay.

I didn't like the eel roll, but I did like the dragon roll we ordered. I would stick with pure sushi and boba teas to be hones the whole box was a let down. -------We went back again and the food was great. Two drinks were missing boba but the food was great and the boba are exactly how I like them at least. I really recommend the spicy salmon roll, and the wontons are pretty good. My friend got the sweetheart roll and liked it. I got the steak and shrimp hibachi- it was pretty good but a little chewy. I really liked the salmon roll and California rolls a lot more. My other friend got the sushi be to box with salmon and that was great!! We also ordered some dumplings for the table and everyone loved them, ideally suggest trying them. They are very filling. Lately I have been coming after class just for the Thai iced tea with bubbles and for the dumplings :)I also really recommend the chrysanthemum slush (with or without bubbles) it was delicious very smooth and sweet."], ["Sam C.", "Great place for quick sushi and japanese cuisine.

They are handy with the fryer and the habachi fried rice is not overly seasoned. I don't think chicken is supposed to be mushy soft. Pink lady roll was smothered in sauce but The Most Interesting Woman in the World could tell that it wasn't fresh and tasted fishy.I sent back an \"avocado\" smoothie and got an earful from one of the main chefs.

I ordered takeout and food was ready by the time I got out of the bathroom. I have no complaints about the food, would've given three stars, but added a star for having sushi and bubble tea. I ordered the Kung Pao chicken Bento box. Good ratio of chicken - veggies, even threw in some asparagus, not too spicy, plain fried rice was good, about 1/2 quantity to entree. Four pieces of California roll were fine, with plenty of ginger and wasabi. Nice to see they threw in the low sodium soy sauce automatically. Cream cheese Rangoon and egg roll were hot and crispy, but not much substance to them.

The beef was cooked medium which I adore and the veggies that accompanied it were crisp and delicious with a very light and flavorful sauce. The rice tasted super fresh was not too greasy and did not taste like it had been sitting for hours. I was overall pleased with my meal it was really great and I can't wait to go back to try the noodles. The only negative thing I could see was that they did not have anyone cleaning off the vacated tables. It's a serve yourself kind of place where you place your order then pick it up at the counter. There should still be someone going about wiping off the tables when they are vacated. I know some would say maybe they were just busy and I could understand that if they were in fact busy when we left but I did not see any tables being wiped down and all of them had some form of debris on them.

Its a relief to finally find a restaurant where the food actually tastes like something, and hasn't been soo Americanized you have no idea what you are eating.

The lady owner glanced up (barely acknowledging our presence), dropped *one* menu on a table and then turned around and went back into the kitchen. Not a good start.We took turns looking at the menu (I noticed a stack of menus sitting on the counter) then waited. And waited. The lady was bustling around not really seeming to be doing anything essential. She took a couple dishes out to people. Took away a few small dishes they were done using. Moved about in the kitchen.A good 10-15 minutes later she came by with second menu and water then promptly left. I attempted to get her attention before she turned away but to no avail. So we waited. There were several more attempts to get her attention to say we were ready to order but she never once looked our way. Didn't look up when she passed us or from the kitchen. (I was actively watching to see if I could catch her eye.) Nothing.After a few minutes of indecision we just got up and left.

Adding chili flakes and hot sauce to noodles does not make it Thai. Second, NEVER serve Thai food with chopsticks!I got the pad thai. Thai restaurants should be judged on how good their pad thais are. This place sucked it up! What I got was more like a fried noodle dish. It was spicy and that's about it. The noodles were dry. No sweet and sour taste to it. I didn't taste any palm sugar sauce, fish sauce, or tamarind. Instead, all I tasted was soy sauce, chili, and whole lot of nothing else. My girlfriend got the pad seuw. So many things wrong with the dish. They didn't even use the right noodle. They used a yellow egg noodle instead of a flat rice noodle. It was prepared like a Cantonese wok fried noodle dish. Dry noodles, old looking/tasting vegetables (who the heck puts carrots in a pad seuw?), exact same seasoning/flavor as my \"pad thai\", and oily. I guess one can appreciate the fact that the food came out fast, but this does not make up for the fact that the food is all wrong and people who don't know any better are missing out on what good Thai food really is. I'd rather they take their time, prep the food properly, and provide customers with a true representation of their culture. The cook, when not cooking, would go out into the dining area and clean up or sit down in a chair. Come on! He's the only person working the kitchen, he should be prepping and cleaning. When an order does come in you hear him working out of the same wok that he hasn't rinsed out (hence the same flavor to all of the food) and the food is ready in a couple of minutes! Really? Two minutes to make pad thai? I'll take quality and precision over time any day. -If you're looking for real Thai food you should avoid this place.-The price is very affordable.

If I had realized exactly what it was before I ordered it, I would have ordered my food \"extra hot\" instead of simply \"hot.\" My tom yum noodle soup with shrimp was actually perfect in spice factor and flavor. Tomatoes soaked up the fresh flavors of cilantro and lemongrass, while the shrimp kept a slightly fishy flavor that went well with the broth's sweet/sour fish sauce. Not-so-transparent noodles gave the soup more substance. I could have used a little bit more spice in my Massaman chicken curry, though. It was delicious: The potatoes and chicken were simmered in a coconut milk infused with clove and other sweetish spices, so I could have used more spice to balance that predominant flavor.

I'd give it a shot, but know that their are other Thai places in Indy that you'll enjoy if Siam Square disappoints you."], ["Aninda S.", "Highly over-rated Thai 'like' food. Food quality is mostly okay, although I was served mild instead of hot (well could have been worse if it went the other way!). The soup was actually hot. Not sure how many diners were able to down the soup for lunch today. It's usually two scale lower in heat level. Apart from the noise level the poor quality of service adds to the disappointment. They are not being able to handle peak load the last few times I was here for lunch. Not only from a service standpoint but also accuracy of order and taste of food. Lastly from a quantity standpoint, no other Thai restaurant in Indy (or any other place I am familiar with) serves food with such a small portion size.Ah a very important thingy! Please clean your tables with soap and warm water. I couldn't life my bill off the table nor could I touch the table without feeling yucky! No it's not the humidity outside.

You can't beat the location, and the prices are pretty standard for Thai food. It's definitely a go-to place for a craving for Thai.So I feel a bit unfair giving Siam Square four instead of five stars, as a result. But having been there about a dozen times, I've just never been wowed. I don't find the food much better than most other Thai food in town, and I certainly don't enounter new, innovative dishes, or Thai dishes that might be harder to find in the midwest restaurant scene, like Miang Kam. It's more or less the same, predictable menu as other places. I'd love to see Siam Square push itself the way many of its Fountain Square neighbors has, and become Indianapolis' introduction to Thai food and beverages that we aren't familiar with yet -- beers besides Singha, appetizers besides the usual fried fare.Until then, Bangkok is a little more walkable from where I am -- I'll need an extra push to go the extra distance."], ["Mike F.", "Food that lacks spice bores me to the point of annoyance. \u00a0A baked potato has that effect on me. \u00a0As one who consumes Asian fare (at least) weekly, I typically dine at Indian, Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese restaurants. \u00a0One would assume that, due to my love of spice, Thai food would be an ordinary staple of my diet. \u00a0I must confess something, Dear Reader: It is not. \u00a0Since I lack experience in Thai cuisine, I had to turn to recommendations. \u00a0Through those recommendations, I concluded that it was time to give Siam Square a whirl.Situated on Virginia Avenue, which connects Fletcher Place with Fountain Square--and home to restaurants that are quite the current rage, one would expect a great deal of trouble with parking. \u00a0Hardly. \u00a0When I arrived, which was about 7:30PM on a Saturday evening, we saw plenty of street parking; however, we opted for the private lot adjacent to the building--which I later learned Siam Square is purchasing. \u00a0Parking solved. \u00a0As we walked in, we noted a large number of people waiting to be seated. \u00a0\"Crikey,\" we thought, \"we'll never get table.\" \u00a0Wrong. \u00a0We were seated in the upstairs portion of the restaurant within five minutes. \u00a0I was very pleased with our table, as it gave us more space. \u00a0I find that being cramped leads to a loss of appetite. \u00a0From the first moment I entered Siam Square, I noticed that the service was top-notch. \u00a0Our server arrived quickly, brought our drinks expediently (and re-filled them!), and explained the menu efficiently. \u00a0I appreciated that she asked what types of food we liked, and made her recommendations based off of our preferences. \u00a0My preference was spicy. \u00a0Thai hot. \u00a0As hot as possible. \u00a0We took most of our our waitress' advice and started with the Curry Puffs. \u00a0We found them to be sumptuous, but all agreed that we should have made another selection. \u00a0We found that the Curry Puffs were too heavy, and maybe even dessert-ish for an appetizer. \u00a0For the main course, we shared the Beef Pad Seuw, Chicken Pad Thai, and the Masaman Curry. \u00a0Unfortunately, all of us agreed that despite ordering the meals \"Thai hot,\" they still did not meet the intensity we had experienced at similar restaurants. \u00a0However, we truly enjoyed the Beef Pad Seuw and the Chicken Pad Thai. \u00a0Despite the lack of Scofield Heat Units, these dishes were teeming with flavor. \u00a0We found the Masaman Curry to be merely fair-to-middling. \u00a0While it certainly wasn't a baked potato, it was still rather boring--like pot roast is. \u00a0In all, I would attest to being pleasantly full after this meal.While I enjoyed both the experience and the cuisine at Siam Square enough to return multiple times, I would not place it on my \"rush\" list. \u00a0I would place it on my list of places to recommend to others--and while recommending it, I'd insist they try the Pad Seuw and the Pad Thai."], ["Cammie W.", "I highly recommend the green curry and the sticky rice. I thought the (medium) green curry had the perfect amount of flavor and spiciness. There wasn't that much meat or veggies but it comes with a lot of rice. I personally like having more of the curry sauce itself (so that I can drown my rice in it). I love that you can get sticky rice as a dessert by itself because most Thai places I've been to only have it with either mango chunks or ice cream. The grouper fillet with basil sauce and the pad thai were also very good. The tom yum soup was too sour for my tastes, but I'm not usually a fan of tom yum soups in general. The satay chicken tasted more like regular grilled chicken and the fried banana's batter and honey overpowered the actual banana taste.Server was so nice and friendly. He probably thought my family was weird. My parents spent the entire time focused on their phones whereas my brother and I were the ones actually paying attention to the food and interacting with him.Only thing that I don't love about this place was the noise level; I felt like I was at a bar. I almost had to yell my order to the server at times for him to hear me. It's fine if you're with some friends or your SO but I felt like it wasn't very fitting for a family dinner.The restaurant was also very accommodating when we asked if we could have a half order of the fried banana with a full order of the sticky rice (instead of half of each).I also wish it wasn't street parking. We came on a weeknight so parking was pretty easy. But I may not want to come on a weekend and have to deal with finding a spot (trying to find a parking spot can make me somewhat anxious). Granted, the spots are huge so even if you do have to parallel park, it should be pretty painless."], ["Ryne V.", "Ranked by NUVO readers as the best Thai restaurant in Indy in 2014, Siam Square has excellent authentic Thai food cooked on real woks. The owners of Siam Square also own Rook and have ownership in Thunderbird and Black Market (I believe). I've been getting takeout from Siam Square a lot lately (I only live a few blocks away) and love it. Although typical, my favorite is probably the Pad Thai or the Green Curry. The Siam Roll is a solid appetizer as well and Thom Yum is my go-to for soup. Other than that, it's just a matter of going and trying things out. Portions are good and worth the price in everything except a few appetizers that could be bulked up a bit. Solid bottle beer options, but only 2 drafts. From what I understand, one is always an IPA and the other is a seasonal. A decent amount of wine options as well. The environment is okay. Not a fine-dining place by any means, but not your typical hole-in-the-wall Asian restaurant either. There is also an upstairs where I've seen big parties go and a cool small bar downstairs. When I do lunch take out, it's typically professionals from Lily or other places downtown filling the diner. \u00a0Dinner has mostly trendy couples and parties.

When I ordered Sweet and Sour chicken they were conscientious enough to put the vegetables and sauce in a separate container from the deep fried chicken so it wouldn't get soggy (and obviously the rice was packaged separately from both of those containers).I need to start bringing other people here so I can try their food and still order my staples."], ["Amber C.", "Siam Square is one of the few Thai places that I can consider in my 'safe' zone. \u00a0I have a very severe allergy to shellfish- and generally a cuisine that cooks 90% of their dishes with fish and oyster sauce would be a cuisine I would avoid at all times.Unfortunately, due to having exchange students from Thailand before I developed the allergy has made it a very to give up a food cuisine that I love. \u00a0However, after many, many times- I have still not had a reaction at Siam Square.

If it were really good then it might've made up for the price but it was the worst curry I've ever had. It was overwhelmingly sweet and not because of the coconut milk...it tasted like someone had put 10 packets of sweet'n low in it.

Third of all, it had big, raw *chunks* of onion. \u00a0(I think they just threw chopped up stuff in a pot and only let it cook for 1 min). Lastly, there were probably only 4 small pieces of chicken which had a strange plastic-like texture so I ended up just not eating the chicken. I told myself I wouldn't come back because it was that bad. Second experience was lunch with coworkers and it was much better. The thom yum soup and egg roll were both good. This time I opted for pad seuw (rice noodles which broccoli and bok choy) and it was a lot better than the curry. I still found it to be a bit sweet and everyone agreed that the levels of spiciness were not up to par with most Thai places but it tasted good. \u00a0It was really crowded during the lunch hour but the service was still relatively slow.

It's delicious and the spiciness is always on point. It tastes super fresh and the portions are perfect. I do think that the portions used to be larger...or maybe just my appetite is bigger. I usually take some home but I have cleaned my plate the last two times visiting.I have also tried a few of the fried rices and the pad thai. Both, so so delicious. I recommend the spring rolls if you want something hot and fried as an appetizer. But if you're looking for a healthier, cold option - get the siam rolls. Enough for two, and the peanut dipping sauce is so yummy!I do think the beer prices are a bit over priced. The cheapest on the menu is $5.50. I never drink here because I'd rather spend my $6 toward an appetizer. There are plenty of other bars and restaurants within walking distance with $3 beers or cheaper. I think it would be awesome if Siam Square could somehow have an outdoor space. I'm sure customers would love that! The indoor space is quite dark and dreary. I know they used to seat upstairs but I haven't sat there in a couple years now. I definitely recommend Siam Square. It's a favorite of mine."], ["Amy M.", "Siam Square has amazing food and service Jordan was our server and he was so helpful and have great suggestions!

Get the taro ice cream with fried bananas. I'm drooling just thinking about it."], ["Kasey L.", "Siam Square is definitely my go to Thai place in Indy. After discovering how much I love Thai food in college and while living in Chicago, I've had trouble finding a place that lives up to my expectations. Siam Square is as good as it gets!My go-to at this point is the Cashew Chicken. It is definitely two portions worth, served with a great selection of veggies (onions, peppers, mushrooms, etc.), and in a thin broth-y type sauce rather than a creamy/corn starchy type sauce. They have four levels of heat, and level 2 is about as far as I can go (makes me break out in a light but pleasant sweat). Level 1 seems to be totally bland in my experience. Other things that we've tried include drunken noodles, Bangkok fried rice, stir fried vegetables, and sweet and sour chicken. It's all been great. What I love most about Siam Square is the quality of the ingredients (we all know that sometimes you have to worry about mystery meat), and it makes me feel confident in trying something I've never had before because I know it's not going to have any gross-ness in it. The veggies are always bright and fresh, too!We usually do take out, and they do a great job of packaging things separately so that they don't get soggy or change temperature too quickly. Even if we call at peak dinner time, the wait is usually only about 25 minutes, which is fine by the time we get there. The price is probably a little higher than typical (both for Thai food and for what I'd expect for the area), but it's worth it to me. There are definitely deals to be had at lunch time."], ["Tony J.", "4 star for their red curry. We've tried other Thai places in Indy but SiamSquare's red curry is the closest to our favorite, the ones we used to get from Exotic Thai in Terre Haute, before they closed early this year. We'd definitely come back here if ever we are in the mood for red curry."], ["Ashley M.", "Oh Siam, how you make me so happy. Not only does Siam Square offer top notch thai cuisine, they offer a gluten/soy free option on many items as well! Their noodles are dream worthy and their tom yum soup will cure any illness. They offer a phenomenal lunch special, though there is a rather drastic price difference between lunch and dinner for similar portions. I typically grab Siam Square for carry out but have dined in on a few occasions. The downstairs dining area can be a bit cramped and can get quite loud, but the upstairs area is quaint and ideal for a group gathering!"], ["Diann K.", "Pad Thai medium hot, very delicious.

Everything was exceptional."], ["Jessica L.", "Truthfully this is like the only place in indianapolis that serves good Thai food.. So it's pretty hard to compare it to anything else. I recommend coming during lunch, because the price is pretty daring for dinner, but since they are really the only place serving good Thai, they can do and charge whatever they want. The lunch is a lot more affordable with a Thai roll and soup included in their lunch special, and it seems like I comes out faster than dinner. I have mixed feelings about the spice. I always ask for Thai spicy and sometimes it's hot and sometimes not, but where else can you go for a nice shrimp Pad Thai? I usually get take out and eat it at home with as much chili and rice as I want.So tldr: good but could be better, but since there's no competition.. I doubt it"], ["Chelsea W.", "Ventured to Fountain Square for the first time a few weeks ago to try Siam Square and it did not disappoint! I can't say I'm much of a Thai food connoisseur, but I've had my fair share of Thai fried rice and Siam Square ties for first place in my book. The Bangkok Fried Rice comes packed with veggies and your choice of meat (my choice was chicken). I typically go for a medium heat, something to give it flavor and spice, but nothing I'm guzzling water over. My brother had the Drunken Noodles which, while the dish as a whole probably isn't my thing, the noodle I tried was delicious! Neither of these dishes, however, stood up to my husbands Pad Thai! The flavor was absolutely mouthwatering. I believe he went for about an 8 on a 10 scale for heat and it was perfect. The Pad Thai will definitely be my choice during our next visit!All in all I'm SO glad we finally took the trip down to FS to give things a try. We will definitely be back again!"], ["Patricia N.", "A little pricey when shrimp is thrown on it, but good flavors overall. \u00a0A table for two is quite small but nothing to fret over.Som Tum - Green Papaya SaladDrunken Noodles w/ ShrimpPad Thai w/ Pork"], ["Tiffany C.", "My favorite thai spot in Indy!

I could keep listing the rest of their menu. Everything that I've had so far has been pretty good. The restaurant also has some pretty good lunch combo menus and I would say that the portions are just about right. I'm a bit of a spice wimp, so the medium level was actually quite spicy for me, but I know that for others it wouldn't even be rated as spicy. For price range, I haven't been to many Thai restaurants in Indianapolis, but based on other experiences, I would say it is slightly on the higher end. \u00a0For example, three small curry puffs for about $7 after taxes, this would tend to be about $4-5 in other places, or there would be more puffs."], ["Veronica P.", "I ordered the Siam Roll for starters.

It was not bad, but I think I am a bit spoiled with Thai food being from the West Coast. It has a good flavor, and in generally I liked it. The portions for me are smaller than what I am used to for the price, but again my bar I'm measuring to is West Coast where cheap Thai options are plentiful.

Fun recommendation - taro ice cream! Just try it! SO GOOD! Plus it looks lovely, a vivid purple.

It would be nice if they expanded to include some outdoor seating or moved to a larger location."], ["Jason B.", "Don't let the fact that it's in a strip mall fool you. there is fantastic food hiding inside.There are food options for everyone, they'll help you choose the appropriate spice level for you, and they understand what vegetarian and vegan mean.

Thai Taste is quaint, quiet, and the staff are very friendly.Our fried mussels for starters was good, but I think I prefer my shellfish steamed to heavily breaded and fried. Plus, it was a little disconcerting that they were plated with onion rings and french fries.My main entree definitely made up for this. I ordered my all-time fave...green curry with fish...and it was delightful. The dish had plenty of spice in both heat and taste. I'd love to try their red curry next time.And we were pleasantly surprised to see BOBA TEA on the menu. They only had a couple flavors available, but the Thai Tea flavor was excellent.To top off our yummy meal, our server brought us a plate of almond cookies...a little hard, but still very good.I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a date, nice evening out with friends, or somewhere to take some out-of-town guests."], ["Babby A.", "The food here was amazing.

The owners are very sweet and will make recommendations. They also make their own ice cream, though I'm always too stuffed at the end of my meal and haven't yet tried it.What bumps this up to 5 stars for me is the vegan buffet they offer on the first Thursday of every month.

I may even venture further to say, it may become my go to place for Thai food in the city. I loved it!Thai Taste is a small restaurant tucked into a strip mall on 82nd/86th street (bonus surprise spice store next door that I definitely have to check out the next time I'm out there). \u00a0My wife and I walked into the restaurant around 8:15pm and it was packed, the tables were filled and they are all placed closely together. \u00a0Luckily there was one free table and we were seated very quickly. \u00a0By 8:45pm the restaurant was emptying out and it was only then that I realized they close at 9pm. \u00a0I sort of felt like a jackass because I know how it feels to work when a restaurant is almost closed and people come walking in. \u00a0However, people were still coming in at 8:50pm, even after 9:00pm, and the restaurant workers were very attentive, kind, took their orders, and patiently waited on all of us late comers/eaters. There were also many people coming in for takeout.Now onto the food! The food was all excellent! The best part, I was so excited about the whole fish orders on the menu, and at extremely reasonable prices! Needless to say we initially ordered 2 bowls of Tom Kah, a whole order of pineapple fried rice, and an order of the whole steamed fish wrapped in a banana leaf. \u00a0The server quickly came back to tell us that they had run out of banana leaf for the night and so we ordered our second choice, which was the red curry fried whole tilapia.The Tom Kah that we had was freshly made and perfect, I drank mine so fast and wished I had more. It had a good amount of chicken, mushrooms, bamboo, and ginger. \u00a0Some restaurants only put like 4 small sliced pieces of chicken and you may be lucky to have maybe a thin slice of mushroom.The pineapple fried rice was served in a pineapple and there was a good amount. It had the perfect amount of fish sauce so that I could taste it, but it was not overpowering. There was a clear flavor of pineapple and chunks of pineapple, something that often gets lost. \u00a0Even more importantly, it wasn't a weird brown color, the sign of too much soy sauce. Generally, fried rice, is not supposed to be brown.The red curry fried whole tilapia? YES! It had the right amount of heat for me, since I do tend to be a wimp. Although it was slightly difficult to eat, as I was out of practice eating whole fried fish with chopsticks and I couldn't easily separate the head and take out the bones via the tail/spine, we destroyed the dish. By destroyed, I mean, I tore it apart, and my wife and I ate all the meat and delicious fried skin we could until none could be seen. \u00a0It was full of flavor and also had a good amount of chopped bell peppers. I am sad we were too full for dessert, it was also about 9:40 by the time we had finished everything, and there were still some people eating in the restaurant.The food was just overall very good and the prices for the portions and quality were also on par, even on the slightly cheaper end.I am definitely coming back. \u00a0I'm probably going to develop an unhealthy habit. But hey, I'm a food yelper for a reason!"], ["Moira R.", "AMAZINGThe table had Tom Kah (a coconut broth soup with chicken and mushrooms), a whole fried talapia seasoned with red curry, and a pineapple fried rice. \u00a0The soup cup was surprisingly large. \u00a0I love starting a thai feast out with Tom Kah, it is the perfect balance of savory and sour. \u00a0I was also very happy with the fish and pineapple fried rice combination. \u00a0The fish was moderately spicy (which for me seems extremely spicy) so taking bites of the sweet pineapple rice in between was refreshing. \u00a0I was too full for dessert, but they have an excellent selection of ice cream (hello taro) and a homemade rum cake. \u00a0Maybe I should have asked for that rum cake to go...Not enough places offer whole fish on the menu. \u00a0Not only does Thai Taste of the whole fish, but they also have many preparations (fried/sauteed/steamed) with many spice combinations. \u00a0I will be back."], ["Laura H.", "The service is so kind and friendly it hurts me to say it, but I didn't care for the food.

I tried to explain that to our waitress and she totally pulled it off. \u00a0My pud zew (which I've always known as pad see ew) was spicy enough to enjoy the flavors, but not overwhelming. \u00a0My boyfriend enjoyed his noodle dish (can't remember what exactly it was...) and his Thai iced tea. \u00a0Our meals were enough to have leftovers for lunch, which is always great and we got cookies with the check (does life get much better than leftover Thai and free cookies?). \u00a0Prices were reasonable and food was fantastic. \u00a0Can't wait to go back!"], ["Alicia P.", "Tourist - General : Overall this place was pretty good!

There were about 3 tofu/veggie stir frys, 2 noodle dishes, 2 fried rice dishes, 3 types of curry & 1-2 appetizers. I tried everything and thought it was all very good. \u00a0My only complaint would be the egg rolls.

We there is a nice variety - noodles, fried rice, soup, dessert, a curry and various tofu vegetables in different sauces and gravies, spring rolls and these yummy fried pumpkin. The food was constantly refilled. It was fresh and really good. I have also ordered takeout from this place. Word of caution - hot is FREAKING HOT. They can make pretty much anything vegetarian on the menu. Their soup are really good! The food is really flavorful too. We got mild medium and hot for different dishes. And if you get the mild and medium it's not just heat you can taste the lemongrass, galangal, ginger, garlic! The hot I can't say much about since it messed up my brain cells for a few mins. My new favorite Thai place!"], ["DeAnna P.", "I was very impressed. \u00a0I ran in for carry out after hitting up Trader Joe's. \u00a0I'd asked the cashier if he ever went there and he RAVED about the quality of the food. \u00a0 Thanks, buddy, you were absolutely right!The ambiance of this place is very cozy and homey. \u00a0The restaurant is not much more than a hole in the wall. \u00a0However, they had some long tables, so I'm guessing they could accommodate large parties if you called in advance.I ordered at the counter and opted for the crispy spicy chicken that was on special. \u00a0I didn't see it on the regular menu, but I hope it is available frequently. \u00a0It was so good! It was normally made with green peppers, which I do not like. \u00a0They were happy to substitute Thai chilis for me, which amped up the heat. \u00a0Whew! \u00a0I had about a 15 minute drive home. \u00a0I was impressed that most of the fried chicken chunks stayed crispy even doused in sauce. \u00a0The meat quality was good, too. \u00a0Mostly white meat and no gristle that I noticed (to be fair though, I wolfed it down too fast to notice much). \u00a0They also included an almond cookie with my meal. \u00a0It was clearly store bought and a little stale, but hey, it was free.The staff was very friendly and brought me a water to drink while I waited. \u00a0The sign on the door notes that they have buffets on Thursdays, and once per month the buffet is all vegetarian offerings. \u00a0I cannot wait to go back and eat inside. \u00a0This is my new favorite Thai place!"], ["Tamara Q.", "I like the rustic charm of this establishment despite its location in a strip mall.

I would return again."], ["Ian P.", "Noodles in broth is quickly becoming my favorite genre of food, and Thai Taste crushes it. Currently, the vegetarian GUAY TEOW KAEK (noodles in red curry and tofu) is probably my favorite dish from anywhere in the city. The curry broth is so flavorful and complex, the taste lingers in your mouth well past when you're finished (in the best way possible.) Another resounding positive is that they actually spice things according to how you order it. I'm into spicy food, but at other \u00a0places, when I order \"Thai Hot,\" the dish comes out at medium spice, at best. At Thai Taste, however, \"Thai Hot\" is legitimately spicy, but not overpoweringly so. The heat adds to the complexity of the dish and provides a nice balance between every other flavor found in the rich curry broth."], ["Lea B.", "Rangoons-wonderfulLoved the soft spring rollsOur favorite was the pineapple boat-Kow Pud Subprarross (pineapple fried rice)"], ["Megan O.", "Truly tasty! Because this place has such a large menu, I branched out beyond my usual noodles or curries. I opted for eggplant with beef (number 3), which turned out to have a great flavor similar to Korean bbq. My friend ordered a vegetarian dish with a ginger flavor (#1 or 2?), and I might have liked it better than my dish! The only downside is that you should clarify if you want your dish spicy or not. The server automatically assumed I wouldn't want my dish spicy - she didn't initially ask what level of spiciness I wanted, but she said to my Indian friend, \"you want it medium spicy, right?\" Then she says to me as an afterthought, \"You want mild, right?\" Review update 6 months later:The monthly vegan buffet is also solid. I had irrational carnivore fears that it would not fill me up, but I was so wrong! I sampled most of the dishes and left completely stuffed. I particularly loved the tofu curry green bean dish.

As good as it gets in terms of thai food, not overly greasy, everything tastes fresh and full of flavor. Every Thursday evening it also has a buffet, and the first Thursday of the month it has a vegetarian buffet.

We came in and were immediately shown to our table by the friend waiting staff. Ordered a shared appetizer which was nice and then ordered some entrees. One came out by itself and I waited another 20 mins for my dish. Not acceptable but so be it.When ordering my dish I asked for spicy (I like it hot) and the waitress smartly suggested I order medium spicy and she'd bring a tray of condiments out with it to let me adjust it up from there. When my dish eventually arrived (10 mins after my wife had finished eating) it was the most bland tasting non-spicy Thai noodle dish I'd ever had - and the condiment tray was nowhere to be seen. After asking for it again the waitress brought it over and with judicious adding of chili and other spices, my meal was passable. Honestly, I've made better Thai food at home.The final failure of this restaurant was the friendly waitress who brought over our check and then essentially demanded the tip in cash so she could take it rather than the restaurant take it as part of the credit card transaction and distribute it later to the staff. I felt like leaving no tip at all but in the end threw down a fist full of dollars to which she swooped on from across the room. It was awkward and unprofessional. If you want good Thai food then try Thai Kitchen or Thai Orchid - both excellent. Don't waste your time with this place."], ["Michael G.", "Delicious. Always very kind and welcoming staff.

Once for a regular lunch and once for the buffet dinner. On both days I tried their soups and on both days I was disappointed. The broth in the Tom Yum and their noodle soup is flat and plain. It just doesn't have that spicy, flavorful kick that Thai food normally has.The other food is not bad but very Americanized. Thai food is normally very spicy and flavorful (since they use fish sauce, tamarind, lemongrass, basil, etc) but the flavor profile at this restaurant has been Americanized to one that is more on the sweet side. Nothing wrong with that - they're just catering to their market demographic. If you want it spicier, ask for chilies and they'll bring it to you.Overall it's a very good deal, especially for a weekday lunch or the dinner buffet but I still dislike the service. They tend to pay extra attention to you if you're not colored and forget about everyone else, especially the lady with the glasses.For more authentic Thai food and better service I recommend Sawdasee on 86th."], ["Holly G.", "My husband and I came on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. \u00a0I had been here several times, but it was Rick's first time here. \u00a0I ordered a Thai soft spring roll, which is one of my favorites, and they do it very well. \u00a0Rick ordered Thai Toast and loved it. \u00a0That was a bit greasy for my taste, but it was flavorful. \u00a0I also got a cup of Tom Yum soup with chicken. \u00a0It was exceptional! \u00a0For my entree I chose the green curry, and it was outstanding! \u00a0The server said \"It's a little spicy - that alright?\" and I said, Oh yes! \u00a0It really was amazing. \u00a0The depth of flavor was fantastic. \u00a0Rick really liked his entree as well. \u00a0For dessert, we split a piece of rum cake and coconut ice cream. \u00a0It was really nice. \u00a0The owner came out and said that both the cake and ice cream are hand made. \u00a0It was a delightful meal, and everyone was so kind and pleasant to talk with - a great experience all around. \u00a0We have a few places around Indy we like to go for Thai food, but I think today we found our favorite one."], ["Jay L.", "I am not really sure why this place had a 4 star rating on Yelp to begin with.

As someone who can't handle much cilantro, damned European genes, there are several rotating dishes I get. Pad Thai, obviously is a major contender. The curry varieties are all excellent, but the best thing on the menu to me is the THOM YUM SOUP. ALL HAIL. A savory and filling soup that takes you on a journey to Flavor Country, this is what I look for in a soup! I usually get it with tofu because the chicken is sometimes dry, and the shrimp still have the tails on. Nothing worse that having to stop the shoveling of food into your mouth to take the tail off of a shrimp.

A TV screen with various aquatic animals is what you'll see for scenery along with scattered Asian images and sculptures. That can all be pleasant and cozy with the right company and when we visited, it was open enough to be okay.Food: Our vegetarian spring rolls arrived promptly, more than adequately sized and ready for eating. They tasted more like egg rolls than spring rolls, fried to a strong degree but tasty nonetheless. Just not necessarily what spring rolls would make you think. Our cabbage salads were balanced very well with scallions, red onions and cilantro making a tasty side. We split a tofu pad thai (level 3 from 1-5 hotness to appease us both) and it was exactly what I would think of when I think \"pad thai.\" The balance of ingredients was definitively apt, though the downside is that it doesn't separate itself from the pack. Extremely reliable, though, and the tofu was cooked properly.Service: Our waitress was knowledgeable about our eating habits (vegetarian vs. vegan vs. fish sauce is okay) and asked appropriate questions. Our food was delivered quickly without any issues. The water pitcher was left at the table which led to us both being well-hydrated. I would say the service was the best part, though I keep in mind that there were only 2-3 other tables being occupied at the time.When all was said and done, I would go back again if I was in Broad Ripple and craved Thai food, though there are other places in town that serve more flavorful dishes and have more variety.

I've never had the lunch buffet, but after reading reviews here, I think I need too. The environment is romantic and unique - light jazz music will play in the background, or you'll be treated to a live musician on weekends.I've been to another Thai restaurant near Bangkok and it just lacked the level of professional service.

There is seating by the window so you can enjoy your meal while looking outside.Four stars for the service, the waiter was pleasant. However got the level of spice wrong for one of us, hot is extremely hot! I felt she was kind of hovering around trying to rush us to make up our minds about what to get. Otherwise was quick to get our orders and serve.Food deserves four stars as well. I think it was really nice, I got the tiger sauce chicken. Serving size is really generous. My friends got the red curry and a pad thai with tofu. They appeared satisfied however when I tasted the tofu is was nothing special.

I went here with a coworker for the lunch buffet and think it was definitely right for the price - around $10. Now, the buffet is smaller than some you might be thinking of - India Garden, Shalimar, etc. but I think the offerings are good. Decent sized salad bar to start off - wish they would have had a spinach option, however. Several curry options - wish there would have been a chicken one, I only noticed beef and tofu offerings on the day I was there. Also wish there was more than one type of rice to choose from. The highlight is without a doubt the crab ran goons. I'm not proud of how many I ate - let's just say you need more than 2 hands to get that amount right. The food on the buffet seemed hot and fresh and though they were running low on several items when we first arrived (a bit later at 12:45) they did replenish everything we wanted by the end of our meal. I will say I thought the service could have been a bit better. We hardly got any offers for refills on water, which at a Thai place, I definitely need more of. A pitcher on the table would have been helpful in this instance.Overall, I don't think Bangkok is a buffet that you can absolutely gouge yourself on. I left feeling comfortably full after two plates and don't think I could have eaten a lot more. A great place to go every now and again when you're craving Thai food, but for whatever reason, I don't think this is a place I would go to very frequently.I am definitely intrigued by the \"jazz bar\" concept of the place. Anyone got that figured out?"], ["Crystal R.", "The lunch buffet was so fresh and tasty. I had a salad, chicken fried rice, a beef and eggplant dish, orange chicken, a noodle dish, crab rangoon, spring rolls, and fried bananas.

I will definitely go back... often!"], ["Anthony T.", "This place is only one elevator ride and a few skips away from my office, so I figured I should give it a try for lunch today. \u00a0I mean come on, Jazz music and thai food?

All in all, I'd say this is a great alternative to hitting the small and intimate establishments on Mass Ave for lunch or dinner, especially if you have a big group with you."], ["Laurie L.", "Jazz music at a Thai restaurant? I know, right? But the atmosphere was calming and the music made it more so. Oh yeah, and the pumpkin curry special was soooo good!

I have ordered take out-late night too, but the variety and freshness of the buffet is better.

Their lunch buffet is excellent. It's $9.99 for all you can eat soup, fruit, and delicious deep fried and noodly goodness. I went at what I assume should be peak business hours (around noon) on a Friday and didn't have to wait for a table. Our waiter was attentive and kept our plates clear and drinks full (which is really all you need when you have a buffet). I made several trips up to get refills. The food was always well stocked and I didn't have to wait on anything (every few minutes the servers brought out fresh food and were constantly monitoring the buffet).Highlights for me (after the first visit to the buffet where I sampled everything, I filled my plate up a couple times with the following):Spring Rolls - There are sauces, but they're at the front of the buffet before you get to the rollsOrange Chicken - This was delicious and crunchy, not chewy, which was impressive for a buffetSpicy Basil Fried Rice - It wasn't actually that spicy (I have a low-ish heat tolerance and I didn't have any problems)I'm due for another visit back here in the next few weeks."], ["Kasey L.", "We made it in for the famed lunch buffet! While I'm typically not into buffet style anything, I make an exception for ethnic food because it helps me get out of my comfort zone.

It's clearly a better deal to go for the buffet. The food was great, however, I'm not so sure that $9.99 is actually that much of a \"deal\". I do think it was worth that much, but I'm not sure it was a bargain in a city full of lunch specials. The service was average. It was packed on a Friday afternoon!The buffet had some fresh fruit and salad (that I basically skipped...I was there for the noodle-y carbs and fried stuff). I had:-Veggie spring rolls: a favorite! Lots of sauce choices available for dipping, too.-Tofu Pad Thai: above average for sure-Pork Pad See Ew: the only thing I didn't particularly care for-Spicy Basil Fried Rice with Chicken: definitely spicy! But I went back for seconds ;)-Green Curry: the first time for me, and I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was since I'm typically not a big curry fan-Orange Chicken: really crunchy (yum) and not overly orange-y, just the way I like it-Fried Banana with Coconut and Honey: just as delicious as it sounds."], ["J K.", "I stopped here for a quick dinner one evening. \u00a0It looked like a nice place from the outside, and the inside was an inviting wood interior but definitely not your standard Thai decor in a good way. \u00a0The service here was excellent and the staff were very friendly and helpful. \u00a0Their thai basil with minced chicken was well prepared with a nice colourful mix of fresh vegetables, but it was a bit late and the flavours could have used a little more attention. \u00a0I definitely need to come back to try their Thai lunch buffet which I understand offers a wide array of fresh dishes and flavours. \u00a0The musical atmosphere was not Thai, but it was a pleasant mellow background."], ["Shaamora H.", "When I first heard about the concept of this new restaurant, I was definitely intrigued. I visited Bangkok and Jazz this past Saturday for lunch and was very pleased. This was an early Father's Day outing so I typically like to try a restaurant before introducing it on a special day. Again, I'm glad I took the chance. I had the Pottery Shrimp which was very good but I kept eyeballing my Mom's Volcano Chicken and my Dad's beef tiger plates. The wonton wrapper apetizer was excellent as well. You could really taste the ginger which wonderfully paired with the sweet/spicy dipping sauce. One more thing: I enjoyed my Sweet Thai Ice Tea (if you are lactose intolerant beware of this one it is made with cream). I drank it anyway and didn't have too much discomfort lol. It was worth it though."], ["Dylan E.", "This place has been on my to-do list for a long time, but I finally made it here a couple times in the past couple weeks. The most surprising thing about both visits was how empty it was. Maybe it was I came on days that were just exceptions, but this restaurant is definitely deserving of a much larger crowd that I have seen here.I came both on a Saturday night and a Monday night, and chose to sit in the bar area on both occasions which was open seating and contained both a bar and a handful of tables. I think the service in this area was taken care of by the bartender, and service was only so-so. This could definitely be improved on, but we had the same person both nights. The bar selection wasn't very great, and priced a little high, but it seems like a nice place to come get a drink if you were looking for some music and a more laid back atmosphere. Their menu had quite a few specialty mixed drinks, and it looked like they even had sake on tap. On Saturday, they had some great live jazz/funk type music, and it paired with the nicer restaurant to really give it a great ambiance. It's definitely a more upscale atmosphere than a lot of the ethnic cuisine around town, and it would make a good choice for a nicer night out. I've been to my fair share of Thai places in Indy, and I think I have the put this one on the top of my list food wise. It is easily ahead of its popular competition less than a couple miles down the road. Aside from the atmosphere just being exceptionally better, the food was also on a different level. It was much more flavorful than Thai places I have been to before, and the Pad Thai that I ordered tasted fresh and was full of ingredients. Another big plus was that if you order a dish \"hot\", it was actually spicy, which seems to be an issue with the places I have been before when the hot seems to taste the same as the mild. I think my Pad Thai was $13 and I ended up taking enough home with me for another meal. There were quite a few people who called in and got carry out orders when I was there, and this will be on my radar the next time I am looking for something to-go. It's also been brought to my attention that they have a lunch buffet, so I will need to make it in to give that a shot one of these days.This is probably a 4.5 star place for me, but I think I need to round up based on the precedent I have set with other Thai place reviews. This is my definitely new favorite Thai place in Indy."], ["Sarah C.", "All I could think of when I walked in the door was, \"wow, this place is a lot nicer than I thought it would be.\" For some reason I had envisioned this new Thai/jazz joint to be a little less formal.

I ended up having pad thai (without peanuts.) Loved it! I'm not a big spicy food fan, so this entree was the perfect choice. And luckily I have leftovers for lunch tomorrow! ;) A friend of mine let us try the apple sake -- wowee, wow, wow, wow! Delicious. I would have never guessed it would taste as refreshing as it did -- and it was great. This new little joint is a perfect addition to the downtown Indianapolis food scene.

Fantastic! Sign me up! Walking distance? Even better.Here's the scoop:I have a set Thai litmus tests that consists of soft vegetarian spring rolls and red tofu coconut curry.

The setting:I'll call this casual sexy Thai. Low lighting, table-side candles, soft jazz playing overhead and an extensive list of sake, Thai-themed cocktails and more. I opted for the sweet apple sake which was surprisingly delicious despite my standard distaste for overly sweet bebidas.Next time:Rumor has it the lunch buffet is pretty tasty so I still need to give it a whirl.

Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! \u00a0The food was excellent. \u00a0We ordered the seafood soup with panang curry, and thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I had the Tiger Garlic with beef. \u00a0The curry was consistent with other legit Thai places, and the Garlic Tiger was impressive - a handful of chunks of beef, coated in cilantro and other seasonings, and cooked perfectly medium-rare where it is just slightly chewy and soft (which is hard to find). \u00a0Even the cabbage was well flavored as it had soaked up the delicious beef juices. \u00a0I couldn't give it quite 5 stars for because the seafood soup was a bit overpriced. \u00a0Though it was delicious, I would've expected a larger portion of it. \u00a0However, the Garlic Tiger was reasonable for the portion, so I guess it can be a hit or a miss. \u00a0Anyone looking for quality Asian food at a moderately formal setting, then look no further!"], ["Alicia F.", "Sweet little Thai restaurant and jazz spot downtown.

A dive, this place is not.There was no live music on the weekday we went, but jazz music was still being piped through the speakers to maintain the ambience. I ordered my Thai fave, Pad see ew (12.95), and was pleasantly surprised at the large portion I received. Also, you get your choice of protein (chicken, beef, pork, tofu) with the majority of the entrees for no additional charge. They have multiple spice levels (Mild, Medium, Hot, Extra Hot, and Thai Hot)--I got the Medium as a precaution and could definitely afford to upgrade to Hot next time.Service was friendly, the kitchen was super expedient with our food, and the overall experience was a win.

Smells like apple jolly ranchers and has a subtle, fresh taste that is somewhat deceiving.. it's not what you imagine when you smell it. Hana Sake.. you did a damn good job on this one. Dinner was green curry. I ordered it medium, but it wasn't that hot to me. I'm by no means someone who likes hot food, but I would have ranked this under mild. Still, the creamy coconut milk blended all of the flavors together perfectly, and I did everything but lick the bowl clean. Delicious!"], ["Sam C.", "This is easily one of my favorite restaurants in Indy. The food is delicious and the staff is very attentive. The lunch buffet is good but the $9.99 lunch special is a feast. You get soup, salad, a spring roll, and an entree. You will definitely have left overs for dinner as well. So much food!

Good head, very fresh."], ["Ronak S.", "Siam Square is great. Bangkok is better.It's rare that I actually find myself virtually addicted to the food at a restaurant, let alone an individual dish. That's how I feel about the tiger garlic and pepper here, and how my girlfriend feels about the eggplant. It's difficult for me to break away from these, because both are so delicious. It's hard to find a place that can cook eggplant to that perfect texture such even the most ardent eggplant-haters can't resist it, and the tiger garlic is the perfect dish to increase your spice tolerance -- no matter how hot you order it, it is so delicious that you'll keep eating. That which doesn't kill you...That won't stop me from trying a few other things, though, and the papaya salad, the Thai iced tea, and the standard entrees like Pad Thai and the curry dishes are fantastic as well. You can find many of these at the daily lunch buffet, too. Yes, there is a lunch buffet. Go as often as you can. Be careful on the spice levels -- I find Bangkok to be one level higher than most Midwestern Thai restaurants I've been to.Of course, Jazz Bar is part of the name, and smooth jazz goes surprisingly well with Thai food on a Friday and Saturday night. There's no cover, so it's a great way to get a sampling of the restaurant. Still, the bar is just on one side of the restaurant, and the rest is family and group friendly if you're wanting to bring a few."], ["Jenna G.", "I visited on a Wednesday night with a group of friends.

The dim lighting and smooth Jazz, sets the mood for an intimate diner.The menu provides a nice selection and includes the traditional Thai favorites. The Tom Kha Goong was delicious. The consistency of the soup was good and the spiciness of it was just right and not overbearing. The only thing that I really wasn't a fan of was that the tails were left on the shrimp. In terms of Gluten Free options, one could order the Pad Thai; however, you would want to make sure to not have them but the Thai sauce on in as they use soy sauce. Other gluten free options include any of the curries on the menu.Wanting to try something new, I opted for the Beef Mussaman Curry (coconut milk, potatoes, pineapple, carrots, and onions), and boy I wasn't disappointed.

It is a little expensive, especially after you tack on a few drinks, but not outrageous and certainly not more than I was willing to pay for the quality of the meal and the atmosphere - just don't go into this place thinking it's a cheap Asian takeout restaurant.

I have been to Siam square, Sawasdee and this one in Indy all of which are Thai. In my opinion this is the best. Each food has very distinct taste and for the ones who favor mild levels of spices I would strongly recommend the Thai spicy basil, just ask for mild heat. The lunch buffet portion size and the side offerings are similar to the other two. However a salad is an extra and especially useful if a sudden surge of Thai spice is almost killing you :)Service - very much lacking. We were sitting on sitting where the wooden frames are ie where you have the two seater tables. The waitress served us across the wooden railing instead of coming over to our table side. The coke glasses were never refilled which is sad especially if you are serving coke in a wine glass! We were two on a business lunch and were never asked if we wanted to split the check. So basically lots of scope for improvement. Parking - well it's downtown. The cheapest are the hourly parking On the roadside for $2.5!

The food? It's pretty fantastic. The service?Well, the service wasn't so great. There was some miscommunication with our waitress, and she ended up bringing me out salad rolls and spring rolls. I only wanted salad rolls. She brought out everyone else's entrees at that time. I waited for her to come back so I could explain the mix up, but after 10 minutes I figured maybe she didn't get my entree order (pottery noodles) and I was hungry so I figured I would just make dinner out of the two orders of Thai rolls.And then 15/20 minutes later my entree came out. By that point I had stuffed myself on the Thai rolls so I ate less than half of it. It reheated decently a few days later.So the food is great. But the service wasn't great and our waitress was pretty inattentive, even though it wasn't busy by any means. I'm willing to give them another shot since the food was so good.

My first, and definitely not my last, visit to this establishment was not a disappointment. The restaurant itself is a quite lovely. I love the plush red carpet, wood, and Asian decor. We went around 4:30, so it was not packed. Please be warned that metered parking is available for $1.50 per hour.We were seated immediately. The waiter was really nice, attentive, and not to mention a cutie :-) They had a nice selection of wine and limited cocktail selection. I am a tea fanatic so I was excited about their hot tea selection. The menu was extensive and covers all of the basics. I ordered the lemongrass soup with shrimp as an appetizer and pad thai with shrimp for the entree. It didn't take too long for the soup to come out. The soup was not what I expected. Yes it was full of fresh veggies, herbs, and the shrimp was generous, but it was heavy, too spicy, and oily. I ate the shrimp and moved the soup to the side. Our entrees came out shortly thereafter. Nice presentation for dishes and outstanding portion size. My friend ordered the chicken fried rice and loved it. My pad thai was everything I was hoping for and then some. I don't think I made it through half of my meal before become stuffed. I am so happy about my leftovers. I DEFINITELY will visit this establishment again soon. I would live to visit when they had live jazz. Good service, delicious food, and wonderful ambience. A great addition to downtown! They had a sign for a lunch buffet a 11-3 for $9.99. I definitely want to check this out."], ["Amber E.", "The inside of this place is beautiful! I cannot believe how sophisticated it was for the price.

Haven't you ever gone to a Thai restaurant and just wanted one more bite of something? But not pay an arm and a leg for the extra serving? They have tofu/veggie pad thai, soups, curries and some Chinese-inspired chicken there. I mean... for about $10, you're already covered, since that's how much you'd pay, if not more, for a small portion of Thai anyway.The service is what lacks here. They only have about 1-2 people working the floor.. during lunch hour.. in downtown Indy... that's a joke right? I know you don't have to have a lot of servers for a buffet.. but you actually do? Clean plates, refill drinks, refill the buffet, check on guests, checks, payment.. I mean there's so much more than letting people have at it! It's cramp space, so you can't just do endless no-check up on your guests.Also, the Jazz is ridiculous. Don't get me wrong, I can get down on some jazz.... but for a Thai restaurant.. I just couldn't stop laughing.. that's just me. :)"], ["Deborah B.", "There are places so great or bad, that when dining I am actually thinking-wow I cannot wait to write a review to tell about this amazing/awful experience. \u00a0In this case of Bangkok Restaurant and Jazz Bar. \u00a0It is the fact that this was such a wonderful experience. We had a long day of wondering around downtown Indy during Big10 tournament and were finally ready to pick a spot for dinner. \u00a0Many of the restaurants near our place had hour to hour and a half waits. \u00a0We remembered that Bangkok was on our list of places to try. \u00a0We walked in and the host was not there a server sat us at a comfortable table. \u00a0The first thing I noticed is how great the food smelled. \u00a0Nothing like the smell of curry in the air! We explored the menu. Some great options for sake and wines by the glass. \u00a0The overall ambiance (dimly lit and romantic)and decor was really well done and tasteful.Our appetizers we went with the spring rolls in rice paper. \u00a0For our entrees we both chose the red curry. \u00a0I had mine with chicken and my companion beef. \u00a0The spring rolls were large and stuffed o the brim with the freshest veggies and chicken, and accompanied with ample portions dipping sauces. So good I wanted to lick the plate.Next for our entrees, the red curry. \u00a0The portions were very generous. \u00a0Neither of us spoke for a few minutes as we tucked into our meal.Suddenly, instead of the recorded \u00a0jazz we had been hearing a live band began to play from the bar area. \u00a0It was then that I actually had a moment. \u00a0I realized that I now have an amazing thai place walking distance from my place. \u00a0This reminds me a lot of restaurants in Nola on Frenchman st thatbhave live jazz and serve amazing meals in an upscale setting. This is hands down the best Thai restaurant that downtown Indy(and yes better than Siam Square by far) and can rival any I've had in my 15 years of living in Chicago. Better atmosphere, better food, portions service. Go here for a date night, go with friends, or bring your kids. This is now one of my favorite places in downtown Indy and will be back for sure!"], ["Sara C.", "My first time at Bangkok Restaurant was for lunch today. The $9.99 buffet was appealing so my friend Natalie and I decided to give it a shot.One thing I really appreciated was that the buffet was labeled. I have visited Spice Nation before and while the food was great, nothing on the bar was labeled so I really didn't know what I was eating. Spicy tofu, fried rice with pork, hot and sour soup, white rice, vegetarian spring rolls, crab rangoon and shrimp pad thai were all available along with a few more dishes I did not try. What can I say, buffets fill me up!The buffet also included a small tossed salad option and a dessert, which was fried banana pieces. I didn't try them but they looked really good.I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. It was filling and, being a buffet, I could have eaten as much as I wanted to. Our server was attentive and kept refilling our waters in the busy restaurant that had every seat full. The atmosphere is comforting and inviting, with large windows that overlook Ohio street and really brighten up the wood and maroon color scheme that is throughout the restaurant. An extensive wine list and bar really emphasizes the \"jazz bar\" part of their name."], ["Vanessa S.", "I like going to their lunch buffet. First let me say I am not a fan of ALL their food. My technique is to go and get a bitesize (or less) portion out of all their dishes in the buffet and then come back for more of the ones I like.I agree with Mi Sook that some of their dishes are not good. Their eggroll/springroll is hit and miss. there are days when it's okay and days when it's awesome. I like their crab rangoon when it's fresh out of the kitchen and their pad thai. I always love their dessert, banana fritters. I like that they rotate their dishes, I have seen variety every time I go. Service is good, my water is always topped off, and you don't wait long to get your check.The noise level here is way better than the other Thai place in Fountain Square where you have to scream every time you talk. So overall I like this place and would go back for their buffet."], ["Maulik S.", "New, beautiful and well established Thai restaurant. Loved the food. Owner of place is personally greets everyone. Totally loved the place. Will come again."], ["Hannah R.", "Just got done eating here - we tried crab rangoon, basil fried rice with beef, and drunken noodles with tofu. Everything was delicious! We ordered both entrees hot, and man were they hot! The dishes were huge, loaded with basil and crunchy veggies. And did I mention hot?! (Both in flavor and temperature). I almost took this down a star bc I felt like the tofu and beef could be of better quality, but took it back up to 5 bc they don't use msg and the flavor is amazing."], ["Swarna R.", "This place is a must-try in downtown Indy !

Well, that's what I thought at least up until my first visit here. I really had high hopes for this spot especially with the good Yelp reviews and since it was fairly packed with the weekday lunch crowd. Now, the buffet options didn't look particularly appetizing to me, but sometimes food tastes better than it looks. I was hoping this was the case. After sampling from my plate loaded with chicken pad thai, red curry, vegetable spring roll, fried rice, stir fried mushroom, and king pao chicken, I thought to myself 'there is nothing on this plate I'd want to go back for more of...' The pad thai was plain and awful. Overcooked, mushy noodles with barely any chicken or flavor for that matter. Perhaps I should have spooned some chopped peanuts on top for some texture. Red curry had an off-flavor to it which I couldn't pinpoint what about it was wrong. So called stir fried mushrooms were raw. Coulda used a lot more time on the stove top. After tasting what seemed like a mess on a plate, I did go back for a cup of the sweet and sour soup hoping that would redeem the meal. Yikes, that wasn't any better. It was about the worst version of this soup I've tasted. The flavor was off and the vinegar taste was overpowering. I stopped after the second spoonful. I had my fill of this unlimited buffet.While I disliked everything I tried, it wasn't all bad. My server was very attentive, professional, and friendly. She asked if I enjoyed the meal, and I confess I told a white lie. It wasn't her fault I didn't like it. The interior and soft jazz were also nice. However, all that can't make up for the shortcomings in the food. While it may just be the buffet that is a complete miss, I cannot bring myself to give this spot a second chance to check out the menu selections knowing what they served on the buffet."], ["Julianna Y.", "Wasn't too impress with this place. Not sure if they were just off their game with cooking or not. My group all thought our food was too salty. What really saved them was their spring roll appetizer. The sweet n sour sauce and the crisp of the spring roll was amazing! I really want to give this a 2, but the appetizers really saved it."], ["Lisa R.", "We used to be regulars but it's been severely disappointing the last year. There is little eggplant in the eggplant entree but it's loaded with baby corn. They add a surcharge for pick up and have left out the rice in the last two pick up orders. Done.

The wine wall was simply fantastic, and such an eye catcher as you walk through the door, along with the very cute, sleek bar as you enter. I choose the Fuji Apple Sake after many of my fellow dinner dates convinced me it was the best drink on the menu and low and behold it was definitely worth it! Above and beyond any sake I have had before my visit to Bangkok Restaurant.During my dinner with fellow Yelpers, we tried a lil of each appetizer and if I wasn't already won over at this point, hello tastiest crab rangoon to ever touch my lips. I'm telling you, I would literally go back just for the sake and crab rangoon if I had the option.I ordered the Tiger Garlic and Peppers as my entree and got crazy and ordered it hot, which was a good choice because it was just the right amount of spicy...enough to make the nose run, but not blow me out of my seat.LOVED it, and will most certainly return :)"], ["Sheila P.", "Glad to see they are still open.

They have an impressive \"wine wall\" and it seems very cozy inside. We opted to sit in the bar where the live jazz was playing. That added a lovely touch. I made the decision to order spring rolls to start out with. I was a bit disappointed with these. They tasted as if they had just shoved some iceberg lettuce in a wrap and sent it out. Our table ordered Green Curry and Red Curry, vegetarian. Both were very good. The rice to curry ratio is a bit off, you will most likely need to order more rice.

Bangkok Restaurant fills a niche between standard buffet and sit-down lunch (which is slower), and does it quite well.Quick tip: Try to do an early lunch if you can be before the crowd gets there. Our group of 10 arrived between 11:15 and 11:30, and there were ample sitting and we were able to start right away. The crowd started to arrive around noon and you might have to wait a little.For the buffet selection, there were several entrees, a couple of curries, noodles (Pad Thai, Drunken Noodle), and soup & salad. Most of food was surprisingly mild, with the exception of green beans and the Tom Yum Soup (which was definitely hot). If you like spicy, you might be somewhat disappointed but you can always order entrees from the menu.Most of the food was quite good, with fresh ingredients and taste. Some of the entrees were also vegetarian-friendly. The only items that didn't work was Pad Thai (texture of the noodles didn't seem right and it wasn't tangy enough), and the curries (they pour ingredients into the curry rather than replacing the whole pot). But hey those are minor details for a lunch buffet. I know I had a good lunch and my co-workers did too.I hope to make it back for dinner to see if there is a difference. For now, I will definitely be back for lunch and it's worth the small price premium over fast food/other buffets."], ["Nic J.", "Good but not great. Atmosphere was dark, with a nice little jazz duo playing. I ordered red curry, which was available in 5 levels if heat. I went with hot, which was level 3, and probably should have went with medium. The beef in it was really good, and the portions here are huge. My wife ordered drunken noodles, which she loved. Prices were reasonable, but I couldn't stop comparing the food to Siam Square, and they lost the comparison."], ["Victoria R.", "I love Thai food and this restaurant blew Siam Square out of the water. My go to dish is always Pad Thai... had it my first time at a Thai place and I have found it very hard to stray from. I ordered mine at a 4 out of 5 spicy since other Yelpers had said that the spice level here was pretty weak and also convinced my dad to do the same (I think he got Pad See Ew). Mine was really well spiced but his was a little on the spicy side (also let me preface, we are from TX and can handle spicy food). It may have been a different chef than on other days. So if you like spicy, my advice would be get a 3 and add chili oil/paste to it if you need spicier.I am definitely going back and want to try the lunch buffet."], ["Ashley P.", "Looking for a place to satisfy your taste for Thai in a comfortable setting? Look no further than this new addition downtown Indy that seamlessly pairs Thai food with jazz. The relaxing ambience includes candlelight dining in a part modern, part traditional setting that incorporates decor from Thailand.

The breading was a little heavy for me, but overall a nice dish to start with. I had the mango curry, recommended by our server and really delicious.

When we walked in, nearly all of the tables were dirty, which was kinda gross BUT it was nearly 1pm so their lunch rush had probably just left. We were seated quickly by the host and told if we wanted the buffet we could go ahead. The tables were all cleaned up during the time we were eating. I counted 3 servers, a bartender, and the host and they all seemed pretty on the ball. Our waters were refilled several times and the servers checked in at least 2-3 times to make sure everything was alright. Buffet was $9.99 (lunch specials are the same price) and had a large amount of vegetarian items with tofu, as well as chicken, pork, and beef dishes. There were about 10 entrees (including pad thai, basil fried rice, and thai spaghetti), 2 appetizers (calamari, veg/potato wontons, spring rolls), soup, salad, fruit, and a couple desserts. Temps were good for all the entrees, nothing was dried up, but most of them had been kind of picked over by the time we arrived. Like...the curry chicken was onions and peppers in sauce with not a bite of chicken to be found. Everything tasted good, if just slightly on the bland side, but that's to be expected with buffets. There are multiple hot sauce options to add if you like heat. I kinda liked the dessert I tried: Coconut Jelly. It's a 2-layered Jello-y dessert with shreds of coconut in it. My main complaint is that the spoons, small plates, and soup bowls really weren't clean (dinner plates were fine). I picked up 5 dessert plates and they all felt sticky/greasy, and 2 of 3 soup bowls had some sort of fuzz in the bottom. The spoons had \"bits of crust\" on them...those little dots that you can pick off with your fingernail. Hopefully these are \"just opened issues\" and the dish machine will get its kinks worked out fairly soon. The other odd thing is that there aren't chopsticks wrapped up with the silverware. REALLY nice decor too! Great ambiance. I will definitely return for dinner sometime soon."], ["Neda F.", "The crab Rangoon was amazing. Fast service. Great atmosphere. Fairly cheap.

The other Thai place in the area had already closed so we decided to walk to this place. At first we were a bit confused since it was completely empty... so we decided to sit at the bar area. Paula was the bartender for the night and she was awesome! We really enjoyed ourselves. I had a great lychee martini! The papaya salad was delicious. I also had the seafood red curry, again really good especially since I'm very picky with my veggies and they were great about substitutions. When we finished, I got the tab and put in the tip and signed it. Was not given the itemized receipt so I asked since those are always recommended for business expenses. The total didn't seem to be off so I didn't think anything of it until I just did my expense report. The total is off by an extra 73 cents (I've triple checked the math and asked another to verify). I'm not sure if computers can make this mistake but anything is possible. If I'm in the area I'll def visit this place again and see if this happens a second time. But for a first experience this did leave a bad feeling for me especially after such a great in restaurant experience. Also, no jazz, at least not on the Wednesday night we were there. Sum it up!The service at the bar was awesome (thank you Paula)! The place is a little dead since it seems to be just a little far from the main hustle and bustle of the city center but the food was def good. However, keep an eye on your tab, and do the math yourself before you sign the paper. 73 cents may not be a whole lot but in my opinion it's not ethical either.

For the main dishes I believe there were 6-8 entrees, spring rolls, and soup on the buffet. \u00a0I will say that you will give up some attributes in the food by choosing the buffet as compared to ordering off the menu at say Siam Square for example mostly in the area of texture. \u00a0The flavors were very good but the food on the buffet seemed a little mushy perhaps a little over cooked comparatively. We were the first group in the restaurant for lunch so the food couldn't have been sitting for that long. \u00a0This could be expected when the food is being cooked on a much larger scale. \u00a0What you do give up in texture you gain in spades in quantity. \u00a0One of my lunch mates was elated to be able to bring a stack of spring rolls back to the table.All in all a great Thai buffet."], ["Linda L.", "Perfect for a quick lunch, or long dinner.

Everything was pretty good and service was good as well but it's just too expensive. $21 before tip for volcano chicken with fried rice upgrade and a side salad. Salad was a good value at $1.50.

I've had hot twice and one was a good level of heat and the second time was way to hot to even be edible. That was super disappointing, not being able to eat my food cause the chef over did it on the heat. Besides for the pad thai, I've tried their red curry and papaya salad Thai style. The only thing I thought was good was the Thai curry but I did not like the random vegetables that was in there like green peppers and pea pods. The only reason I gave it two stars is cause of the customer service. Super friendly on the phone and in person. Also, food was made fast so I didn't have to wait when I went to pick it up.

The heat, the freshness, the coconut, the peanut satisfies me to the core. This is a solid Thai restaurant. I have been waiting for it to open for the last few months. I would routinely check to see if it was open every time I left Target (it is around the corner but in the same strip mall as Target). Last night we gave it a go. Care has been taken to make the dining room pleasant. The seating is comfortable, the fabrics are interesting (I would love to have those tablecloths). The way the restaurant is laid out, there is a sense of intimacy that you don't always have in strip-mall restaurants. I had the Red Curry with tofu and ordered it hot. It was everything red curry is supposed to be- full of coconut milk, vegetables, Thai basil and heat. I could have taken it hotter and next time plan on asking for extra hot. My dining companions ordered the Pad Thai with chicken and the Sizzling Beef. The Pad Thai was a little light on vegetables & not impressive but the Sizzling Beef arrived at the table literally \"sizzling\". Every dish was full of flavor and we cleaned our plates. All entrees start with a small Thai Salad which was perfectly seasoned. We finished by sharing a tapioca pudding- lovely green tapioca with coconut milk and whipped cream- very nice. Why only four stars? The waitress was a little off her game and even though the dining room was fairly empty, didn't refill drinks until asked and then it was after the entrees were done (with Thai food you sometimes need that refill). Also, the Pad Thai needs a little something extra to make it special. Every Thai restaurant does Pad Thai and the great ones distinguish themselves by making their version memorable. I had the Ginger Tea but was happy to see that they also offer Chrysanthemum Tea (a personal favorite). They also have the usual Thai Tea and Coffee.

Another thing that bugged me a tiny bit is that I asked for chicken summer rolls as an appetizer (which is on their menu, I double-checked), but they brought me out crispy chicken wings and then told me that they don't have summer rolls. \u00a0I am wondering if maybe they were just out of ingredients for them or something? \u00a0However, they gave an order of fried bananas for free which were pretty good too.

The menu describes the red curry as \"Hot,\" but panang curry as \"medium-hot.\" I have fairly low tolerance for spicy food, so I got the panang curry. (They have a warning on their menu that they do not refund foods that are too spicy. This totally scared me off from the red curry.) The panang curry, though milder, was still pretty darn spicy! It was delicious though, but I needed my drink on standby. For dinner, a small panang curry + rice is $6. Can't beat that!

Potatoes and carrots were a bit soggy but ignorable since the flavor was delicious. Mom got green curry which was excellent! Such great flavor - definitely would get it again! I got Thai Town fried rice - really good basil flavor and excellent spice. Great surprise at end of fried bananas with honey for everybody! Super tasty and nice to get a little something extra.

And, we had entrees of Curry Catfish (spicy green curry and coconut milk, eggplant, basil, etc) and Padd Woon Sen with pork which is a bean thread noodle and stir fry veggies dish. Luckily we ordered Thai Iced Tea topped with milk which was very nice and helped calm down the heat of the spicier food. Our server also brought all of us small plates of a complimentary dessert.

My gf had the panang curry, and I had the pad Thai. Both were outstanding! The panang curry was spicy yet flavorful. The pad Thai noodles were perfectly cooked and the sauce was thick and had just the right amount of sweetness. All the veggies looked and tasted fresh. We were stuffed at the end of the meal, but we ordered the fried bananas anyway based on the earlier rave reviews. They were delicious! Sweet, crunchy, and bite-sized. We actually liked this place so much that we went back for lunch the next day! Again we were the only customers in the restaurant, so the server was attentive (but not overly so). They even gave us a free sample of the fried bananas! We don't live close enough to go regularly, but I definitely would if I could.

I have to say that I never understand how this place stays in business because it is always completely empty when we dine in, but maybe they do a lot of carry-out business.

The Lotus salad was flavorful - the dressing was fantastic - and the shrimp chips were some of the best I've had. The tea was soothing and a nice warm complement to our salad. We both went with a meat- filled pho (#33 on the menu) for lunch. The serving of sprouts and herbs was a little small but we easily split the veggies and loaded down our soups. Our pho had rare steak, flank steak, brisket, and meatballs - there was meat in every bite. The rice noodles and broth were both good too.

Food:My pho was tasty. \u00a0It had a good amount of fat and good beef flavor. \u00a0Much better than what I remember. \u00a0I typically order the pho dac biet which is the \"special\" or \"everything\" pho. \u00a0It normally comes with meatballs, flank, tendon and tripe. \u00a0I noticed mine had no tendon or tripe. \u00a0When asked why I was told that most customers pull it out, so they provide extra meat instead. \u00a0If I wanted the tripe, it would've been by special request. \u00a0Well... this is a negative for me. \u00a0Why order something and in fact get something else? \u00a0This is really a service issue. \u00a0I would assume that it would come with it!Outside of the order not being as expected, the soup was flavorful and enjoyable.Atmosphere / Cleanliness:The place has an odor which is hard to describe. \u00a0It has a bit of a greasy feel to the place. \u00a0Much like older Korean BBQ places do; like it doesn't have adequate ventilation over the fryer and cook tops. \u00a0I wouldn't consider this place very clean but its also par for many inexpensive Vietnamese restaurants.This is a convenience choice in my opinion. \u00a0Rather than go to the west side for King Wok or the other west side Vietnamese staples, this place works when a pho hankering hits. \u00a0Although, I have always left a little disappointed and unsatisfied. \u00a0I will probably not return anytime soon.I'm going to give V Caf\u00e9 OK another shot. \u00a0It seams to be much cleaner and the soup just as good. \u00a0Also, Long Thanh is OK but maybe not for the uninitiated. \u00a0Its very much a hole-in-the-wall. \u00a0PS \u00a0A slight gripe of mine is the gratuitous use of 4 and 5 stars on Yelp. \u00a0Its my opinion that 3 is a good baseline and nothing to be mad at. \u00a0All of the 4 star reviews seem to skew the reality. \u00a0That being said, its a matter of personal preference. \u00a0I get that. \u00a0But be wary of ratings and try to be objective!"], ["Phi N.", "Started off with the fried tofu, a beef dish and the goi cuon.

Pork chop was definitely my favorite dish. It also came with an egg! Such a simple touch, but I've never seen that before... As for the banh xeo, the actual banh was cooked perfectly, but I'm not a fan of the pork they use. I'm used to the the thick pork with the fat on it (pretty much slices of pork belly). To be honest with you, I'm not sure which is the correct type of pork to use, but I'm used to eating the other one, and I grew up eating it... so it could just be a personal preference. If you know me, you know I love me some fat! hahah. I tried my cousin's pho, but she got chicken... I can't give you an accurate rating on their pho based off chicken, lol.

Thank you, yelpers. I've been on a Vietnamese kick lately and pho and soft spring rolls on the go seemed like just the lunch for moi. I must forewarn you that I am in love with Saigon, so poor Viet Bistro had quite the uphill battle of winning my heart over.

Bingo, bango - one order of tofu soft spring rolls and vegetarian pho later and we were on the road. My total was somewhere between $12 and $14. I would give this review 5 stars if it were solely based on the spring rolls ------ amazing! the tofu was just right, slight crisp on the outside and soft and moist innards. However, the pho was meh - the broth tasted more like wonton broth - not that I don't love wonton soup, but I prefer Saigon's. Also, I found the vegetables of broccoli, bamboo shoots, etc. interesting that they included with the pho. So, if I could take these tofu spring rolls and pair them with the pho tai at Saigon, I'd be high on the hog.I really wish you could have seen me rolling down the road gnawing on spring rolls with peanut butter sauce and rice noodles dripping all over my lap.

We were never asked how hot we wanted our curry and if I had to guess \u00a0I would say that they skimped on the coconut milk and thickened the curry with flour, used a few frozen vegetables that included fries (???), and a few pieces of frozen seafood.

My friend and I ordered the soft spring rolls as an appetizer, and the vermicelli noodles as our entree.I've gotta say, it's refreshing to find spring rolls that aren't deep fried into oblivion and actually have fresh veggies in them. I enjoyed them quite a bit.The vermicelli was pretty good too. I'm used to it being served in a broth rather than dry, but it was still pretty good. I got the pork, my friend got the veggies. A family friend of hers is originally from Vietnam, and she commented that the food was pretty close to what she would have at their home, so I think that's a pretty solid thumbs up.The food was tasty and the service was good.

And the only thing that was good was the broth of the pho. Everything else was really pathetic and sad presentation of vietnamese food. There was more noodles or rice for every dish.

This place was a joke."], ["Amar K.", "I've seen Viet Bistro for a few years, but last night was the first chance to try out their food. From the sign up front welcoming vegetarians (don't worry - they have non-vegetarian food, too) and the friendly hostess who spoke with a sing-song Vietnamese accent, this place has a very non-assuming vibe. The food was well priced and delicious. I had the fresh spring rolls (must try these!) and the curried tofu along with a bottomless cup of jasmine tea. The food came out promptly and the service was wonderful.Go here for a relaxed dinner with friends or family."], ["Kerry S.", "It's great to have a restaurant that offers good pho on the northside of Indianapolis!I came here after a harrowing experience at Monkey Joe's across the parking lot on New Year's Day.

I wanted to love it a little more, especially because the steamed spring rolls and sauce were outstanding! It seems like every restaurant in Indy deep fries its spring rolls so I cheered when I saw these on the menu. However, the main dishes were just okay. We had lemongrass tofu and stir-fried egg noodles with tofu. I found both dishes a shade greasy and the egg noodles were a bit on the bland side. The dining room was dead on a Friday night--kind of sad. Too bad Indy is sprawl city because in any dense urban area, this place is good enough that it would probably be hopping on weekends. In any case, I will probably be back for the steamed spring rolls until I find somewhere else in Indy that serves them."], ["Rachael E.", "This is probably my favorite restaurant in Indianapolis.Whenever I went I would get #17, or 18 or something.

Viet Bistro has some of the best Vietnamese grub in town...I haven't tried King Wok out on Lafayette Rd., so I may be jumping the gun here. I am a big fan of Vietnamese style noodle dishes, called Pho, that layer rice noodles and crisp veggies with just the right amount of chicken, pork, beef and get dressed with a delicious fish sauce based condiment called nuoc cham. This is a very healthy one-bowl meal and the combination of these ingredients is like nothing you'll ever taste in any other style of cuisine. Viet Bistro does Pho very well, along with a number of other Vietnamese delights, including fish in clay pot and various stir frys. But, the real thing that brings me back again and again is Viet Bistro's goi roll appetizer and fried banana dessert. The former includes a small amount of rice vermicelli, shrimp, pork, thai basil or other fresh herbs, cucumber and carrot slivers, and mung bean sprouts wrapped and rolled in a delicate rice paper. Surprise! They are not deep-fried and the spicy peanut dipping sauce that accompanies them is good enough to eat by itself with a spoon. The banana dessert has sliced bananas wrapped in rice paper -and yes, these are fried - then arranged on a nice pool of coconut milk-based tapioca pudding. The pudding is more like a sauce, actually, and the whole caboodle gets a nice little sprinkling of crushed peanuts. Service here is good and the d\u00e9cor is an inviting step above fast-food style Asian eateries, with darker colors splashed with a few bright accents.

My first attempt at Thai was Pad Khing, 2 on a spiciness scale of 1-5 as suggested by the cashier. My taste buds were lit up just a tad too much, so next time (I know there will be)... I'll just stick with 1. I also opted for a $1 spring roll - awesomely tasty too! So for $6 I got a spring roll, ALOT of chicken + veggies & a plentiful serving of rice. Perfect overall serving for lunch.When the lady owner asked how I found them, I told her thru Yelp/US and she was very appreciative of the reviews already posted and that I chose them (because let's be honest, they're not really near anything but Family Video).

We went with the beef. \u00a0The mix of meat to veggies/nuts was great. \u00a0Most places it's so much onion and not a lot of everything else. \u00a0We totally plan on coming back. \u00a0Sooner rather than later."], ["Suzie T.", "We tried this place that's close to us and I'm sorry we haven't tried them yet! \u00a0Actually I have to say with this one experience, this is my favorite Thai in Indy. \u00a0Everything we ordered was great and the service was also. \u00a0There were many local Asians also enjoying themselves which also is a good sign of authentic food.We ordered spring rolls, shrimp in a blanket, a red curry, and a whole tilapia. \u00a0We had read reviews that their spice levels were true to Thai, not American, so we stuck with 3 out of 5. \u00a0It was plenty of heat & we like fairly spicy. \u00a0The chili sauce that came with the tilapia was very good. \u00a0Not over the top spice and even tasted with a hint of mole. \u00a0We were very impressed that the shrimp in the blanket tasted extremely fresh. Hubster loves the Thai tea & I've never seen him order a 2nd until this visit.All in all I can't wait to go back and try a couple of other dishes!"], ["Cinthia M.", "I found this place too expensive for an average meal with subpar service; I wouldn't rave about it. I ordered Money bags, a Thai tea, and chicken Pad Thai. Both the drink and appetizer were served promptly but I had to wait an extra 20 min after finishing my appetizer to get the main course. The money bags were tasty, but I found the pad Thai dry like some other reviews and not as spicy as I requested. Also, the Thai tea was slightly off."], ["Sarah C.", "This is my favorite place for Thai. It's in a low key strip mall but don't let that stray you. It is usually crowded and it appears many carry out orders are made here. Service is always spot on and the prices are appropriate, with large sized portions. I always go with the chicken pad thai or the cashew chicken, which is served with a side of white jasmine rice. I always go with medium hot, which is just the right amount of spice. The appetizers, crab rangoon and spring rolls, are each served with a sweet and sour sauce and are delicious. They offer selective bottled beer and wine choices as well."], ["Charles W.", "Great food and service this is hard to find around Indy these day's"], ["Amanda B.", "yum!

Great food and really great service! Our waitress was so attentive, always made sure I had water, and understood that we were sort of in a rush so she was quick with everything. The food was great.

Nice atmosphere inside as well."], ["Al B.", "I was not impressed in the least with the cuisine. \u00a0Pad Thai was overly dry and flavorless. \u00a0Tom yum soup was cheaply prepared and also lacked in flavor. \u00a0The worst - crab Rangoon was small, stale and follows the pattern of flavorless. \u00a0Everything is way over priced and I will not return."], ["Kelly G.", "I used to live about a block away from Jasmine Thai, and it was my go-to place when friends and family visited. It's small but that only adds to its charm. The staff are wonderfully nice. Most importantly...THE FOOD IS OUTSTANDING! I don't pretend to be a Thai food expert, but I love everything I've ever eaten there. My favorite is the emerald chicken, which has a peanut sauce and spinach. I also love their crab rangoon, which has the best sauce I've ever tasted. Casual, quiet, and inviting.

My wife got something noodle based that wasn't spicy at all (good for her) but way full of flavor. I had yellow curry which was pretty awesome.Wait staff was super friendly, and you had the typical family hanging out in the restaurant at one of the back tables. Kids were also super friendly.Great family environment, a great first experience with Thai food, and cheap to boot!

While the main course was good, I tend to judge a Thai restaurant on their variation of their variation of Tom Kha Gai. The soup was pretty good. I added shrimp, which there is an up charge for, which really made it a Tom Kha Thale. The soup wasn't too thick or watery and \u00a0had a sweeter taste.If you are vegetarian, they did have a note on the menu stating that they could prepare dishes sans meat. \u00a0Overall the meal was good, and I am sure that I will be stopping by for some more Pad Thai in the future."], ["Bryan W.", "I stopped in for lunch. had a great red curry with spring roll. total bill came to 8 dollars.

Had it with tofu, which I can highly recommend.I usually love ridiculously hot stuff, but next time will have to order medium-hot. Because the hot was too hot and the medium was not hot enough.

The Massaman was not spicy in the slightest, and the Green Curry was SO FREAKIN' HOT. Weird, because we ordered them both medium...Second -- the Massaman had pineapple pieces. \u00a0A first for me -- it wasn't unpleasant, but it meant less chicken and less potatoes. For $12 bucks we would have preferred far less fruit, and more carbs and protein! The curry was OK in flavor -- not as creamy nor as peanuty as other Thai places in Indy.Third -- \u00a0shrimp is a two dollar upcharge. I was expecting some decent sized shrimp for this price in my Green Curry. Sadly, the shrimp was the size of a finger nail. Blah. Not worth $2...frankly not worth a buck. Again, the curry was just OK. Not flavorful and complex...just, spicy. Last, the rice was not fresh. It was gummy, and it was obvious that it had been sitting in the togo container for a hot minute due to the container being so moist...bleh!Sawasadee remains our favorite though Thai Papaya is a great alternative, and Thai Taste is certainly a better deal than Jasmine Thai."], ["D.

They could've been fatter, however, and I wish they had a dish that was super fat noodles with lots of sauce. The lunch special of an entree with a side, salad, or spring roll (choose 1 of the 3) is a good deal. My spring roll was tasty. The cabbage was finely shredded...which is the only way I will eat cabbage...if it's finely shredded and mixed in with something I really like. Fairly nice decor too.

I also got the sweet Thai tea. I would recommend that tea to anyone eating at a Thai restaurant, its the bomb!Anyhoo, the spring rolls were flaky and downright yum, the sauce was just the right temperature. The sesame shrimp were out of this world and it was a nice big portion. The sauce was perfect and it came with rice and vegetables as well. I couldn't finish it all so it made yummy leftovers the next day. The bonus was the neatest fortune cookie I ever seen or ate. It was a rolled cookie and you had to slice the fortune out that was in the middle. The cookie had some cinnamon in it so it was very refreshing.

I got it vegetarian style and it was still so flavorful - packed with veggies and little pieces of fried tofu. I got it at the \"Medium Hot\" level and it was just spicy enough. I especially like how the noodles aren't ridiculously long and unwieldy, and it's not overly sauced. Boyfriend and I shared this and the Spicy Seafood dish, which came out on a sizzling platter and was packed with huge shrimp, scallops, calamari, mussels and pineapple in a tasty sauce. I do not recommend the Tom Yum soup at all. It's basically a watered-down miso soup with a few mushrooms and a lemongrass flavor. It was edible, but compared to Thai Smile's Tom Yum, it's pretty bad. I'm not crazy about the flavor of Tom Kha Gai soup, but if you want an appetizer at Jasmine, go with this one.The service is still great, but holy cow, what is it with all the kids?

Last time I ordered \"Medium\" I thought it was much spicier than what I'm used to. I just chalked this up to the fact that they view their spice levels differently. This time, I ordered \"medium\" and felt there was no spice at all!2. Meats/Tofu - it feels like these are being cooked separately than the dishes themselves, so they tend to seem pretty bland. The veggies are good and the sauces are really nice, it just feels like something about the protein options don't contribute enough to the dish itself. I also noticed today that my spring roll was slightly overcooked. I think most of this is due to the lunch rush.

I loved everything about our experience. The server was very nice efficient and quick. The food was super tasty. I had the paradise noodles. Usually when I say Med things are not too spicy however they really mean it here so if you're a spice wimp I recommend going on the conservative side. We also tried the Chicken Satay and the spring rolls everything was tasty to the max. I will be coming back many times.

I was in town for the month for work at the speedway and needed some spicy comfort.Standard fare, decent prices, but well prepared. Nothing special about the place or the presentation, but the food was rather good. Service was great, although the lone waiter was a little overwhelmed with a ten (or so) top along with a couple of other tables when I got there. No complaints though.Tom Yum soup was tasty and well balanced. I would prefer to have the option to have shrimp in it instead of just chicken or tofu though. I ordered it hot and the heat level was just about right. I ordered green curry with pork for my entree. The portion was perfect, although I took leftovers since I had soup already. The flavors were well balanced and the sauce was thick and delicious. Plenty of vegetables and pork to justify leftovers. The rice was properly steamed and heaped on a small side dish. I had it Thai hot, which is usually is right for me, and it was just over my comfort level. The regular (American) hot that I had with my soup probably would have been perfect.It all went well, as spicy food always does, with a local IPA. I will probably come back next year when I find myself in Indy for the month of May again."], ["Nikki M.", "Delicious thai food! BEST crab rangoons in town! Amazing papaya salad. Friendly staff!

I would like to tell you that I have tried multiple items on the menu, but I can't seem to stop ordering the red curry with chicken. The medium hot is well-balanced with coconut and curry flavors. It's enough food without making you feel miserable all afternoon. After a couple months of being open, they have finally gotten the service issues under control. My water glass was filled continuously and my bill didn't sit on the table for 5+ minutes. We were in and out in about a half hour - making it an ideal lunch location.

But small things compared to the overall experience."], ["Bobby N.", "I judge a Thai restaurant on the curry. We each had the Red Curry with chicken medium spicy. Wow, it is really good. It was late on a Saturday and I picked up the food as takeout. The weather was bad and the dining room was unfortunately empty. I hope a lot of other people were doing takeout too. This place is really well decorated and has a really good vibe. The dining area is small but they haven't over packed the place with tables so I don't think you will feel like you are sharing your conversation with the next table. My peek into the kitchen was a bit of a surprise. I don't remember the last time I saw a kitchen that was so clean. I am looking forward to Curry from here again. And I am planning to visit for lunch sometime when I expect it will be busier.BTW, most of my reviews display a fondness for beer.

I think I will probably have hot tea when I sit down for dinner."], ["Deborah B.", "What a great new place in downtown Indy. Ordered take out Red Curry Chicken and Shu Mai (steamed dumplings) curry was medium and perfectly spiced. Dumplings were very good as well the sauce to go along with it.

It's small but we didn't feel crowded in or like you couldn't move. The decor is bright and fun. Some may say tacky but I think it all adds to the fun. The bright tables and chairs on the patio were welcoming but we opted for inside because it was a bit breezy out. The waiter was quick and attentive. I appreciate when I don't get an eyeroll for ordering my Pad Thai mild! The Crab Rangoon appetizer was really yummy and the food came out soon after. As I said, I ordered it mild because I am a weakling when it comes to spicy food but it was great Pad Thai! They have beer and wine available and I assume the beer selection rotates. I opted for a WeeMac but they had Railsplitter for the IPA lovers. They came from the can or bottle but we were also brought a chilled glass to pour them into without having to ask.

The Crab Rangoon is a large portion, plenty for 3-4 people to share, and more crabby than most I have had with a really good side sauce. The Pad Thai could have been shared between two people as well, but I had yummy leftovers instead. I ordered mine with shrimp, which adds to the cost, but didn't really seem worth it. There were maybe five shrimp in what was otherwise a massive plate of food. The most interesting thing was the the hot and sour soup. It is very good but very different from anywhere else I have had it. Super tangy and flavorful.

The Laab tasted sort of sweet. I wouldn't be surprised if they used a bit of sugar to tone down the spices a bit. It was weird. I guess I just wasn't used to that sort of flavor with Laab. The worst part was the fried banana. And that's the easiest thing to make! They were chewy and tough. Not crispy at all. And instead of honey poured on top they give you a side of...pancake syrup.

In my first review for this restaurant I gave it two stars for less than average food. Today I would give it no stars if it were possible.The crab rangoon had very little filling, mostly just crispy wrapper. Not that I would have wanted more filling anyway because I believe they replaced the crab portion of the rangoon with black pepper. My boyfriend said it wasn't bad just odd to have pepper (or at least *that much* pepper) in crab rangoon. Personally, I can't stand black pepper and couldn't eat it. They replaced the order with fried tofu which was okay for what it was.For the main dish we shared pad thai. That was a poor choice. It came out looking white, no coloring to it and consequently no flavor. We determined there were no peanuts in it and suspect there was no tamarind, palm sugar, or fish sauce either. It had spices but the dish didn't resemble pad thai whatsoever.The owner came out and apologized very profusely and promised they would have a meeting later about the poor quality of the dish. The second round of pad thai was no better. They overcompensated for the lack of soy sauce by saturating the noodles. We could only stand to eat a few bites before feeling overstuffed and bloated from all the sodium.They asked if we wanted a box and we said all we wanted was the check. They didn't take off/reduce the price of either dish or say anything more about their first two (now three) screw-ups. Suffice to say, we will not be returning again.

Anyway, Sawasdee was just okay. Maybe I'm spoiled by NYC thai restaurants where they go to Chinatown to get freshly made broad rice noodles, rather than bringing them from Chicago on a truck in bags and 're-constituting' them... or maybe I'm secretly hoping Indianapolis will create it's own Chinatown to further legitimize itself. People have recommended Sawasdee to me over and over again. I went. There is nothing to really complain about, its.. OK. I felt like the Pad Kea Mow was too busy. Not enough noodles, too many veggies and such. It was also overspiced- It is usually a dish with some heat, the kind where you need to have an Thai Iced Coffee along with it just to calm down your taste buds. This one was --- stomachache inducing. I should qualify myself a little. I've had Kea Mow in 3 different provinces of Thailand. I've had it in over 20 Thai restaurants in NYC.

I've never found any Thai restaurant better, honestly. The portions are giant, the prices are beyond reasonable. The whole place is so clean- and even the bathroom is pretty! We've been going here for years- the owner is so good to us! She makes sure to stop by and talk to us and make sure we're absolutely satisfied. When my fiance proposed, this was our meal! We were even given congratulatory ice cream and fried bananas. We've never had a less than perfect experience here, I ca't sing enough praises! I always love the Pad Thai and Pad Pak Rum Mitt- but everything is to die for!"], ["Trena R.", "The place was hopping, but we were seated within a minute or two of walking through the door.

Totally hit the spot and made me happy aaaallll the way to my belly. I think I've found my new 'go to' spot."], ["Terry B.", "Very good Thai food, where I've sent many friends over the years. We've taken people who visited Thailand and they loved it. I've had a curry there and enjoyed it, but it's hard for me to order anything but the pad thai, which is wonderful.

We stopped in on a recent Friday evening, expecting a wait, as the parking lot was full. It took just a couple of minutes to get seated and get drinks, which was a nice surprise, considering we were there in the middle of dinnertime on a weekend. We decided to share an appetizer and an entree. The vegetarian summer rolls fell apart a little bit, but the spicy lemon chili dipping sauce was SO good! It also came with Thai peanut dipping sauce, but the lemon chili was so light and went really well with the summer rolls. For our entree, we split the Mee Ga Tee (coconut flavored rice noodles topped with Thai peanut sauce, bean sprouts, ground peanuts, green onions, and fried red onions). This can be made with a ground chicken, tofu, or shrimp - we opted for the chicken. This dish was definitely enough to share, especially after sharing the appetizer. It was just spicy enough, although this dish is pretty sweet - you definitely get the coconut and peanut sweetness.Our server was efficient and helpful, even telling us that our entree wasn't one of her favorites because it's TOO sweet for her. She wasn't talking us out of it, just stating her preference and making sure we knew it was on the sweeter side. She was really knowledgeable, which I always appreciate.We aren't near the Greenwood mall that often and I'm not sure this is a place we'd go out of our way to visit. That being said, if we're in the area, it's definitely a place we would choose - it's a little oasis in the strip mall, chain restaurant mecca."], ["Kirk C.", "Very good quality Thai selections and attentive wait staff.

No big deal. Once seated, we were greeted promptly. We ordered the Curry Puffs. There are two to an order and they have a really good sauce that comes with it. Definitely something I would order again.I had the pad thai with tofu and my bf had the pad thai with chicken. They aren't afraid of spice, which is a good thing. The food was cooked and seasoned as ordered. No complaints with the food quality. Huge portions!The problem was that we waited nearly an hour for our food to arrive. I realize they were busy, but that is just unacceptable. Three different people came by our table to say \"our food was coming\". My bf's meal also arrived about 5 minutes before mine. The table next to us had meals coming out 30 minutes apart. The kids ate their rice while the parents watched. The guys meal finally came out, but by then the kids were done and squirming. The lady just watched him eat until her food arrived - maybe 10 minutes later. I also noticed a guy that came in for carry-out while we were waiting for our table. He received his order as we were leaving. That means he waited in the lobby for an hour and a half. I would have never waited that long for carry-out. I was irritated for sure. I would definitely not go again during prime dinner time. There were also no apologies to make me feel any better about my experience.

He said I must be mistaken and wanted to see how I found the prices I saw. So, instead of just taking my word for it he insisted I take 5 minutes of my time to show him. I showed him the online menu powered by Google and he said it didn't matter because he would only honor the PDF File available on his website. He restated the raised total to me and at this point I had to buy it (screaming young children in the car and a hungry wife). It wasn't so much about the money as it was the principles of good business. The customer is always right.

Greeter was rude and white manager rude as well. None the less we will NEVER eat there again or recommend to anyone.

The people here care about your experience, and about great food.There's frequently a line here, so at peak times on a weekend expect a wait. \u00a0Ordering food to go won't get you off the hook either, since there is frequently a long wait for that as well. \u00a0The tables are tight together, which may make for some awkward moments if the place is packed. But just remember...there's a reason why all these people are waiting for their chance to eat here. \u00a0I believe this is probably the best Thai food in the state. It is most definitely worth it. Thai Spice does excellent curries (although be warned, if it says extra hot, it is on the painful side), fantastic stir fries, soups, appetizers, and everything in between.My recommendations for appetizers are the nicely spicy, tender jerky style Sun Dried Beef, as well as the slightly sweet shrimp rangoons.For dinner, there are tons of options that are worthwhile. Literally everything I've tried here has been great. \u00a0All of the curries are good, and most are on the milder side of spicy unless you request it hotter. \u00a0I prefer the Massaman Curry. \u00a0The Catfish Curry is a good choice for those who like great flavor with a LOT of heat. Don't order this if you think a jalapeno is hot. I like hot foods, but this dish definitely pushes my limits. You've been warned.The fried rice dish Kao Padd Bi Kra Prow is excellent, and a good alternative for someone who is used to only ordering Pad Thai. The Thai basil in the Kao Padd Bi Kra Prow really deepens the flavor and makes it a standout. It's one of the things that my husband and I order every time we go here.The Padd Makur is also a dish with great Thai basil flavor, and is one of my favorites. \u00a0The main portion of the dish is Japanese eggplant in a thai basil sauce with vegetables. I usually choose the tofu rather than a meat option, since the tofu soaks up the flavor of the sauce nicely.For desert, the sticky rice with mango is a good choice, with just the right amount of sweetness to top off a meal.My measure of a five star restaurant is one where I can take a chance on the menu, order something I've never tried before, and know that whatever. I get will be excellent. \u00a0Thai Spice certainly fits that description."], ["Jesi A.", "Great food, good service. I should have ordered my meal extra hot instead of just hot though..."], ["Adam C.", "Started with summer rolls. Rolls were not bad but skip the chicken, it was literally a small piece on top of the roll and added nothing to the roll. Dipping sauce is different, peanut sauce is like no other I have had. Can't really place the taste but there is something in there that makes it much different than the regular peanut sauce. I see why the one menu item with peanut sauce says no refunds, it could be overpowering if it was featured in the dish. \u00a0Koong noong pha was something I have never seen anywhere else and although it was fried we loved it and the dipping sauce it comes with. Pad thai was pretty good as well, maybe the second best I have ever had. Something was missing for me, maybe more peanut flavor and a little sweeter. Kao padd bi ka prow was loaded with some basil, I mean I could smell it across the table. Both seemed to be very fresh and were served in huge portions. To be fair, I judge all Thai restaurants by comparison to simply Thai in Louisville, so while this was good it was not the best we have had. Interior could use some updating and maintenance. It looks like an old chinese restaurant that never got a proper renovation. I always wonder if they allow the facilities to get rundown how much of that also extends into the kitchen. From what we could tell it didn't affect the food, we left very full and satisfied.

My boyfriend ordered the number 89, which has become his favorite dish. It is chicken with a garlic sauce. I tried it and thought it was tasty. Today I went for the second time and ordered lemongrass soup and spring rolls. My food didn't disappoint! The flavors are wonderful. Overall the food is very good as well as the service.

The green curry has tasty little chunks of eggplant and green beans in it, along with whatever meat/non-meat option you choose. If you order it spicy it will definitely have some heat to it, but not enough to make you cry at the table. The dumplings tasted a little pre-made, which was underwhelming, but the Thom Ka Gai was the best I've had in Indy.

(If you ask for \"Thai hot\" they'll make it hot plus add a big dollop of chili garlic sauce, and you can stir in as much as you can stand.) But where some restaurants make it hot just by adding more pepper, so all you get is hot, here it's still really tasty. Lunch, however, was disappointing. It was all specials, which discourages sharing. The quality of the food and service were several notches lower. We won't do that again. But dinner? In a heartbeat."], ["Chad I.", "Spicy indeed, but don't let the keep you away from trying some amazing food. First off, the Thai tea is a must try. Great taste and I love cold tea so another plus!

Although the food was decent, the service left a lot to be desired. I ordered Mussaman Curry but was brought Red Curry. I let our waitress know and she argued that I had ordered Red Curry. Um, no. I didn't. So she sent it back and shortly brought me out the Mussaman Curry. Unfortunately, the potatoes in it were uncooked and rock hard. Inedible. Again, I let the waitress know and she acted like it was supposed to be that way. At this point, my husband had already finished his meal and we were running out of time. So I asked if I could just get some Red Curry to go (I had tried it when they first brought it out before I realized it was the wrong thing and it was good, just not what I wanted.)There was no apology or attempt to remedy the situation.

Thai Smile was a restaurant up in Muncie that a lot of Ball State grads might recognize.The restaurant is good sized but the booths and tables can be a bit close together for my preference.

The spring rolls are good but a little bit skinny. You end up getting a lot more egg roll wrapper than the food stuff inside. The small salad is unimpressive.I always start off with the chicken pad Thai to get a baseline for Thai restaurants. There pad Thai has a ton of flavor. It only has a few vegetables though so it's missing some of the crunch I like. The noodles have been a bit heavy and sit tight.

The veggies were mostly onions...andIt was not served with the traditional lime. I had to ask for lime.My husband had something with beef and vegetables in a medium sauce. It was pretty good from what I tasted. He ate all of his.I really like Thai because it is fresh and colorful. I feel like I was really missing something from this meal.The serves was really good.

I am really picky about curry and it was so good I almost cried- it tastes almost exactly how my mum makes it. The Rama Delight plate was basically licked clean by my boyfriend. The spring rolls were excellent and I got the coconut milk soup which was very flavourful. Everything was excellent- If there was a word for better than excellent I would use it but I can't think of one.

With the lunch special you get soup, salad, spring roll, and an entree all for $8. I've had a number of the items but \u00a0 my favorites have been the Pad See Ew and the Spicy Basil Fried Rice.

Eons ago...I may as well become extinct.We arrived at 11:00am sharp, right when the lunch hour opens. I don't think I've ever anticipated the opening of a restaurant like Black Friday (without the long wait and lines of course)...but we had a lot of errands to do that day.What we ordered:- Pad Thai: Chewy rice noodles, separated perfectly. Stir-fried with chicken, bean sprouts, egg, and scallions. Covered in a savory, but sweet sauce topped with crushed peanuts. Heavenly delicious! A bit on the sweet side. A lime wedge would've been a perfect addition to tone down the sweetness to my liking.- Pad See Ew: Stir-fried wide rice noodle flakes topped with mixed veggies and choice of meat in their delicious homemade sauce. Great medium or hot spiciness to give it a little kick.All lunch specials come with chicken broth soup, salad with Thai sweet dressing, and a spring roll for about $7.50. Grab a Thai Iced Tea in a tall glass adorned with a straw paper rose topper to wash down the spicy goodness.Probably my new local Thai go-to spot for a budget lunch when my pockets are feeling a little empty.

He either forgot about our table, or had decided he did not want to serve us.Finally, a different server asked us if we had been helped, and we asked him to be our server! Never have I given a drink order and then been ignored. We should have complained and left.Hungry, we stayed. We shared a papaya salad and some tofu summer rolls (not fried). The papaya salad was tasty, but unfortunately a majority of the salad was iceberg lettuce, not papaya. It also lacked any heat -- it was cloyingly sweet. The summer rolls were decent if a bit bland. I'll stick to spring rolls!Onto our mains of Pad Thai and Volcano Shrimp -- the Pad Thai was greasy but had good flavor. My Volcano Shrimp had been described by the server (and in the menu!) as \"Sauteed Shrimp\" with vegetables. Instead, the shrimp were batter fried (like a corn dog) and then coated in a sweet syrup. The syrup then made the batter soggy, and honestly, I felt like I was eating bad Chinese, not upscale Thai! The 'vegetables' were tiny and gross. I told my server my feelings on this dish and he told me that well, he liked it.Honestly, not impressed. The prices do not reflect the quality, and the lack of heat in all the dishes (all ordered medium hot) was a bummer. The poor service at the start, and lack of sympathy from our new server left a bad taste in our mouth."], ["Veronica H.", "Fast \u00a0friendly service and the food was great.

I've been back few times for takeout and once for dinner. The service has considerably improved! Food is great! They do not skimp on the spice levels. A medium is truly medium spicy. Faves: Thai Salad Rolls... sooo much flavor packed into thin rice paper 'wrap'. It's fresh, no spices ... prefect summer snack. Comes with two dipping sauces - peanut sauce and sweet and spicy sauce.Pad ee Mao... flat rice noodles in this yummy sauce with tons of veggies. Tried a vegetarian version of pretty much all the noodle dishes but this one is the best!Our orders were taken in a timely manner, waters were refilled and we didn't have to ask for anything twice. This is slowly becoming my favorite Thai place."], ["Lin W.", "This restaurant is so good! We lived nearby for 6 years and frequented this spot! Their pad see ew and red curry are both excellent! I like their wine selection as well. They added a nice outdoor patio for comfortable evenings outside. A good spot for family dinner during the week or date night on a weekend. We found it to be packed on weekend nights but week nights are easier to get seated right away. A little in the pricer side for Thai...my other favorite is wild ginger!"], ["Tamika K.", "Very good Thai restaurant. I decided after seeing multiple reviews that I would check it out. I'm on a little hiatus from chain restaurants. I went for lunch and was definitely not disappointed. It was pretty busy for 11:15 on a Monday but Service was nice and friendly. I started off with the crab Rangoon which was Very good, fried crispy and served hot. Then I decided on the lunch Thai fried rice which was tasty however I got mine medium but I should have gone for spicy as this was not hot at all and I love all things spicy. Left with half my fried rice as I was stuffed(note I'm pregnant so I can eat). All in all great experience and I will be back!!"], ["Adam W.", "Mango curry medium heat is absolutely ridiculous.

At first the service was slow and the customer service was lacking, but the food was always good so I kept coming back occasionally. This weekend I had a few friends in town for the Monumental Marathon. They had remembered Thai Kitchen from the year before and requested that we go back again this year. I was more than happy to accommodate. The service seemed much improved and there were several new members of the staff that were very friendly and attentive. The food was delicious as always. We ordered the Thai tea, three different appetizers, and four different entres. I had the special (pumpkin curry) and I'm glad I did. It was a coconut milk, curry dish with subtle hints of pumpkin flavor, various vegetables, and chicken and shrimp. I ordered a spice level 2 (out of five) and it was just the right amount of heat. You have to watch the spice levels because they can be pretty generous. If you get your meal and it's not hot enough, they'll bring some extra hot sauce you can add. Everyone was more than happy with their meals and the experience as a whole. My friends are already looking forward to coming back next year."], ["Jelly R.", "The atmosphere was cozy and clean, with interesting decor. The service was good. We did not have to wait long for our food. Pricing was comparable to most other thai restaurants in the area.

Super good Thai food! The Thai hot isn't nearly as hot as I am used to, but still had a great and flavorful kick. Coconut lemongrass soup with chicken was really good and I have never seen with milky colored broth...accustomed to orange hue. The reason for my four stars is the Nur I ordered did not list cucumber as an ingredient on the menu which I find to be a very prominent flavor that I am not a fan of. Next time I know how to order and will just ask for extra Thai chilis. A must try...and I am just in town on biz. :)"], ["Stewart D.", "Love me some Thai food, and this place does not disappoint.

Most times i'm in fishers it's just to ask for directions on how to get away from fishers.This is not the best thai restaurant in indy, but they are close. They have a good selection of fairly authentic thai dishes and they have proper spice levels. If you ask for hot, it will be hot. During the week, they have lunch specials were you can get a veggie egg roll, a small soup and a full dish for about $8. Nice staff that is good at advising you on spice levels so don't be afraid to ask. As I said before, if you go \"well i sometimes sprinkle some hot sauce on my tacos, so i'll get hot here\" you'll be coughing and crying into your food. Don't be a hero. ask.

We got the chicken-filled wontons as an appetizer and they came with plum sauce (I think that's what it was idk. It was orange so idk. Doesn't sound good but it was awesome.) and they were really good, in fact the best thing I had. I got orange chicken. The flavors were really good and it was very orangey, although it had a small kick of spice as well. I prefer orange chicken from Asian Grill in Noblesville but this was still really good. Good thing they included a nice helping of white rice to calm down the spice between bites. Also had the roti roll for dessert, and it was decent as well. Everything my parents had was good as well. My dad got duck and my mom good some sort of vegetable bowl. We'll probably be back here. Good experience."], ["Corrine P.", "The food is fantastic!! The service is great, super friendly. I ordered the eggplant dish and it was phenomenal. My only complaint is that it's pricey."], ["Michelle S.", "I really love this place but I am so frustrated listening and watching them tell customers who arrive after 8:30 on that the kitchen is about to close.

Will def be going back to try more items here at JS Gardens!!"], ["Richard P.", "I entered JS Garden not completely sure what to expect, though I'd certainly browsed the Yelp reviews and had hopes that I could at least snag a decent meal at a decent price. Located at 54th & Keystone in the area known as SoBro, though I'd personally consider this restaurant to be just East of actual SoBro, JS Garden specializes in Teriyaki and Asian cuisine. It's a fairly casual Chinese restaurant, though I have to be honest and say it's warmer and cleaner than I expected. It's in a small strip center storefront in the same parking lot as Rally's. It's set far back enough from the street that you can truly relax in the restaurant despite being so close to Keystone Avenue. It's comprised entirely of tables. The strip center itself is easily accessible with a couple different curb cuts and parking spaces. There's a glass front door into the building, but the restaurant's small enough that they'll likely see anyone who might be struggling to get in. As you enter, you see a sort of ordering/cooking area to the right and the dining area to the left. The walls are decorated in a warm green - there's a definite Asian flavor to the decor, but not in the usual kitschy way. There's one television at the back of the dining area. However, it's rather quiet. I arrived early in the evening dinner hour and was the only customer at that point, though three other singles had come in by the time I was done. They asked if I wanted to take-out or dine-in. Since I was dining in, I was offered my choice of tables with the appropriate chair removed and my drink order of iced tea taken. As I'm not a huge regular on the Asian/Chinese scene, I browsed the menu a bit. They offer daily lunch specials in the $5-6 range (plus drink). During the evening hours, it seems that those lunch specials become the \"small\" with a large option also available for dinners. The menu is a fairly standard Asian/Chinese menu, though I'll admit I was hoping for and did not see garlic chicken. Instead, I opted for a small teriyaki chicken special with no sides. They have all the usual sides that can certain cause the price to go up (spring rolls, egg rolls, crab rangoon, etc.). That said, my entire meal came in at least than $8.00 - So, for a price slightly higher than fast food I had a much better and much healthier meal. I went in fully expecting JS Garden to be somewhere in the 3-star range. I mean, c'mon. It's a rather dumpy little area and I figured everything would be alright but nothing to write home about. I was just hoping for a few minutes of peace after a long work day. As I entered the restaurant, I instantly felt comfortable and welcome. The interior just sort of calmed down my spirit. My server was attentive and friendly, but not hovering in any way. The woman who was cooking came out at one point to check on my experience, while she also made sure to explain the various sauces available. In short, the service was definitely a 4-star experience. I would easily go back for it. The food? Okay, sure. It wasn't the best Chinese I've ever had, but for just a wee bit more than the Super China Buffet up by Wal-Mart I actually had a peaceful meal in a clean restaurant with food that was tasty, decently sized (especially for a \"small,\" and a solid value. White rice came with the teriyaki chicken and veggies - it was a decent sized meal for less than $6 (plus $1.49 for the drink). I ate it all, sure, but I was full without having the usual Chinese food hangover. The food was obviously fresh and I found their advice about the spices was spot-on. As I recall, the large size was right around $8.29. I have a feeling that may have been more than I could have eaten. However, I was definitely happy with the meal and would easily order it again. JS Garden was a pleasant surprise. The staff was super friendly, the restaurant itself comfortable and inviting, and the food was well prepared and a definite value in serving size and price."], ["Nikol P.", "They are never that busy so I hope they stay around.

My favorite is the schezwan veggies extra spicy."], ["Jessie S.", "There's not many authentic Asian food options this part of town. Sure, Broad Ripple isn't far, but this place is definitely blazing a new trail for this part of Keystone Avenue. The signage and outside appearance is unassuming, but the interior is modern, clean and fresh. There was a modest crowd for lunch (2 other tables), but service didn't lack. Our food was excellent and even the small portion was plenty for the guys I went with. A great work lunch stop of you're stuck in area with few options like I am. Easy parking, no wait and speedy service!"], ["Jennifer S.", "I had lunch w/ my daughter last week and finally got around to trying JS Garden. \u00a0It's a cute little spot in SoBro, just off Keystone Ave. \u00a0They have lunch specials, take out and many of the Chinese specials you've grown to love. \u00a0Our meal was freshly made and came out relatively quickly. \u00a0I had the Cashew chicken and my daughter had the General Tso chicken. \u00a0While the pieces came out looking the same, the spices and flavors were definitely different and we both really enjoyed it. \u00a0 The springroll was delicious, perfectly crisp. You can substitute fried rice for $1. \u00a0They also have a variety of hot teas available."], ["Katherine L.", "Never thought I would say this about a place like JS Garden, but \"No leftovers.\"That's right, I didn't have any leftovers. I ordered some small orders of different dishes, like the house special lo mein and general tso's chicken, and I also ordered some crab rangoon. \u00a0Surprisingly, at other places, when I order the small/half orders, I tend to have a lot of leftovers. Not this time. It's not actually a big problem though. The lady who I picked up my order from was also very nice.Why two stars? Well the price of the food for small size, and regular apps is pretty equivalent to many of the other chinese/american restaurants in town. However, the actual food quality, I found to be a little below average. My general tso's was mainly sweet and there was no spiciness to it. \u00a0Also, there were some meager tiny sliced pieces of carrots and broccoli. The crab rangoon was composed of a thick and chewy dough, and a tiny bit of cheese and artificial crab. It was warm. The chow mein was really greasy and the noodles over-cooked and kind of mushy.I'm sorry, but I don't think I'll be making my way over here in the future. There's just other choices around that are slightly better."], ["Jason T.", "The next thing yelp needs to do is put in half stars for ratings, this isn't really a four-star place but it's not a three-star place either.

They don't have stick chicken, honey chicken or sesame chicken. If any of those things are a complete deal breaker for you then move on. They have fried dumplings but you'll do better to go to the freezer at saraga and fry them yourself.If you are willing to eat anything other than that you're going to have a good time at JS Garden. Try the samosa rolls as an appetizer then choose any entree they do have. So far I have had the orange chicken, general tso chicken and Kung pao chicken and have been quite pleased. They use big meaty chunks of chicken and don't bury them under a ton of breading.

We decided to try this hidden gem. It was a little awkward in the beginning. When I walked into the restaurant for dinner, it looked like a place where you just order at the counter, but we were seated. I believe the owner's sons were our servers. They were hesitant and unsure at times it seemed. It wasn't an unpleasant experience at all. Their slight awkwardness was actually kind of charming. What impressed me was their designation of being an Asian restaurant. They had everything from samosas and curry dishes to pad thai and General Tso's chicken. We started off with crab rangoon. It's probably the same rangoon every other place in town has but it was served hot and crispy. I chose a coconut milk chicken as my entree. I expected more of a runny sauce or broth with it. The sauce was thicker and delicious. My dining companion had the pad thai. They asked how much spice she liked. She was kind of vague when ordering, \"A little, but not too much.\" They got the order down perfect. It was a delicious meal. I would definitely recommend this place. The staff/owners? inquired about how we liked our meal and were friendly. They are personable people and I hope their business thrives."], ["Alex H.", "I've been wanting to try this place since I got a mailer from them and the inside looked really nice. finally got around to it and the cashier was very friendly and spoke English very well probably his first language. the food was quick and very good. the chicken was all quality white meat and veggies very fresh tasting. I'm definitely going back"], ["Emily M.", "Our family loves this place! \u00a0The food is so fresh and really good. My husband and I spent some time in China a few years ago and this place really reminds us of the stir fry we had in China. The sauces aren't overly heavy but the flavor is great! \u00a0My husband is part Thai and the Thai food here is good as well. \u00a0It's really clean and it has a nice decor. \u00a0The lady who works there is so sweet. \u00a0I contemplated not writing this review because I feel like it's a best kept secret. \u00a0But I also feel like everyone should know about it! \u00a0It's not your typical Chinese carry-out place. My favorite dishes are the kung pao chicken and the green curry chicken. But everything I have tried is good!"], ["Anne M.", "Finally stopped in to this Chinese Restaurant after passing it several times on my drives down Keystone. I looked at the yelp reviews and stopped on my way back from the post office that is right around the corner. Enjoyed the lunch special of General Tso's chicken with rice and a spring roll. I added a bowl of hot and sour soup and the total was $7. The hot and sour soup is in my top 5 of those I have sampled in Indy. Like others said, the Tso's was not heavily breaded, so seems healthier. Also had broccoli and carrots in it. \u00a0Will come back for this again. The place is clean and cute. Women's restroom is nicely tiled and also clean. I am gonna upload the menu and a pic of the dining area. It's at 54th and Keystone, behind the Auto Zone."], ["Brigid S.", "Tasty food, nice portions, warm service. And cheap! If you're gluten-free ask for a white sauce instead of a brown sauce."], ["Nicole S.", "This is my go to place. Everything I've had is wonderful, as well as very reasonably priced. The hot and sour soup is AWESOME! The service is fast and it is very clean."], ["Melissa Y.", "I agree with Nate. Great service and food. I can't wait to go back and try another dish."], ["Katie B.", "This place is a little gem. Absolutely delicious food. I don't know if the other yelpers don't know what fresh tastes like, but this place is the definition of fresh. I got the \u00a0Szechuan beef and was pleasantly surprised. You can actually taste the veggies and the meat, and it doesn't taste like it has been soaking in juice for days on end like most Chinese places taste like. My boyfriend got the general tso's chicken. This was also amazing. Most Chinese places heavily over batter the chicken so u get a tiny piece of chicken and 5 layers of batter. Not true with js garden. Here you get a hefty chunk of chicken lightly battered so it actually tastes like chicken! Oh, and the pork egg roll?! By far the best egg roll I have ever had, EVER. I highly recommend this place and will be returning very frequently!"], ["Shaye B.", "This place serves \u00a0flavorless food, that should not be able to be called Chinese food. It was steamed rice with \u00a0a can of mixed veggies served with the name fried rice. I agree with the first yelper for sure would never even think about ordering from them and would picket them if I had the time lol, probably would not waste my gas lol"], ["Ann B.", "Curry shrimp was delicious! I got it a little spicy. Nice mix of Chinese and Thai. I promised to return for the lunch special. Prices are really good, so are the hours and service."], ["David L.", "Ordered the Curry Chicken (large portion) with medium spice and took it home with me. It was delicious, it was still hot when I got home and the potatoes and chicken were great. I ended up making 2 meals out of the dish. While I was waiting for my food I talked to the owners and they were lovely people, you could tell they took pride in what they made. I sampled something that looked like a spring roll on the outside, I can't remember what it was called though. Regardless it was delicious. Overall I would recommend this place, and definitely will be back."], ["Susie D.", "This is a new restaurant so we thought we would try the take out. \u00a0 Very disappointing. \u00a0Food lacked flavor, very bland. \u00a0To go containers were not the typical Chinese to go containers and they leaked and didn't stay closed. \u00a0Probably won't go back."]]}
