Our waitress may have been new, but she also genuinely didn't know what we were saying as well. We had to ask for every little thing from the actual act of ordering to refills to the check at the end. At the end, she ended up \"not doing the groupon right\" and chased us down into the parking lot. It was weird, and she was wrong anyway.Despite the weird/bad service, the food was pretty good. Fajitas were flavorful and portions were generous. Would probably go back, but only with a groupon.

It's newer as it's located in a recently built strip mall. Inside it features high ceilings, classic Latin American movie theming, a bar, a disco ball and lights, and many TVs. The service we received was friendly and responsive. Our food didn't come promptly but was worth the wait nonetheless. Before ordering from the expansive menu, our waitress brought us homemade chips and dip. It tasted wonderful and dampened our restlessness from not getting our entrees quickly. The main dishes came and solicited nothing but complements. They were fresh, perfectly prepared, and generously sized. The namesake dish was what I ate and was really tasty and unique. This a quality place."], ["Esmeralda H.", "This place just got on my nerves. We walked, were sited & the waitress took our order. She comes back 5 minutes after saying it will take 30 minutes to get to our tickets plus 30 minutes to cook the food making our wait a total of an hour just to get some food. I was amazed that it will the chefs that long to prepared food that isn't really that hard to prepare. There wasn't even a lot of people in the restaurant. So I tell we are leaving & she just says okay? Are you serious?! I've been to a lot of restaurants around if Indiana & not even high end restaurant had ever taken that long to bring our food out. I find this disrespectful & ridiculous in so many levels! Never again will I ever visit this place!"], ["LaShelle S.", "This is a secret breakfast and coffee spot of mine.

But...there were oddities. \u00a0I didn't get to choose the kind of tortillas I wanted. \u00a0They served small corn tortillas--not my favorite since they crumble easily and don't hold a lot of ingredients. \u00a0The beef was fine, but didn't blow me away. \u00a0Service was just ok, but I think they were short staffed.I'd like to return and have something else. \u00a0Maybe my next trip to Indy."], ["Richard R.", "The food was OK; service, not so much.We drove to Indianapolis on Friday night for a conference on Saturday. \u00a0We got to our hotel about 9pm and were pretty hungry. \u00a0We saw this place across the street. \u00a0The wife loves Mexican food and so we didn't even fire up my Yelp app to look anywhere else.Even though it was a Friday, by 9pm the dinner rush was definitely over and the place was definitely winding down. \u00a0We declined any drinks (just water) and ordered right away. \u00a05 mins goes by, 10 mins goes by, 15 mins goes by: no food and no sign of our server.Finally, another server took pity on us, stopped by and asked the obvious: \"are you still waiting for your food?\" \u00a0We said yes and she went off in search of our server; after a few more minutes she finally showed up and plopped our food down on the table.She never refilled our water glasses, never asked how our food was, never asked if we needed anything else. \u00a0We finally flagged her down and got our check so we could get out of there (and (obviously) will never be back)."], ["Peter P.", "This is a very average, Americanized Mexican restaurant. \u00a0 Service was pretty slow, even though it wasn't very busy. \u00a0 The food was very 'meh'. \u00a0 The usual gloppy Mexican slop you can find anywhere in town.I think on Saturday nights it becomes a little Mexican nightclub as it looks like it's setup for light/sound and there's a band/DJ area as well."], ["Maisum F.", "Great food and remarkable staff!

Not sure why people have this place a bad review. We came here a Saturday night it was busy at all but that didn't matter to us. Asked the waitress if we were able to use our Groupon on alcohol which were able to do. For a small margarita for 5 bucks! Yes place! We had the peach and strawberry. It was food just a little to much salt. My boyfriend had some steak dish (arrachera tampiquena) and I order tacos. They were all good!!! I had carne asada, chicken and beef tongue. I enjoyed the beef tongue the most!! And service was quick! Seriously it felt \u00a0like 10 mins we got our food! Love the food here! Will definitely be coming back!"], ["Wanda M.", "The rating is for my dinner and experience as my husband gave it 1 star. I did a dry run yesterday checking out the restaurant wanting to bring my husband back. I thought after reading other reviews and being here once he would like it. WRONG! However, I still enjoy it and will return to try other dishes.My order was the Pollo a la Angie - \u00a0Nice presentation of cubed chicken breast cooked in curry, pineapple and coconut milk with spicy flavor. My chicken was a little tough but the sauce is absolutely DELICIOUS with the curry and pineapple flavors. New potatoes were fresh and wonderfully spiced. Served with rice and toasted, well buttered bread. I loved my dish and would order again even if the chicken was tough.I had stressed to my husband the different reviews I'd read noting food allergies and how well they handled those meals. Of course I had previously been there so I knew what could possibly go wrong with the amount of cheese, guacomole and sour cream they use. He ordered the Chicken fajitas after seeing the menu pictures covered in foods he knew he can't have. Safe choose for him but he NEVER orders fajitas. He and I both both stressed the allergies and she reassured us all was fine. His meal arrived and the chicken fajitas looked good. The plate with his beans and rice were smothered in cheese. Our waitress didn't even pay attention as she walked away and after offering him reassurance. Once we resolved that issue, he found the tortillas very small, and they are, tough chicken with absolutely no seasoning. Comment was the chicken wouldn't have any flavor at all if it wasn't for the grilled onions and peppers. He thought my new potatoes had more spice than his entire meal. His first comment was I'd rather be in Avon (at his favorite place). \u00a0Before he finished dinner begged me not to ask him to return here even if it was free. I have enjoyed both meals I've had here but I do agree the chicken was bland and lacked proper seasonings. I will return and try other entrees."], ["Sharee M.", "For my last restaurant visited in 2013 maybe I should have thought it out more. this restaurant was okay to say the least. yes the decor was beautiful and I really like the vibe. There are a large TVs on playing the game and a full bar. There was even a artistic Mexican guitar / singer who played at each table for free. However even with a couple of tables of customers ,there was very slow and bad service. our waitress did not want to bring us water for some reason \u00a0and it took 3 request to get it. Then the young lady didn't tell me until my order came out of that there was no pork tamales even though before I ordered I inquired whuch tamales were available, as the menu stated to do. So I had to wait an additional 10 minutes to get chicken tamale. The waitress also did this on a alcohol beverage order with my coworker. My suggestion to management is please ensure that your servers know what's available daily on the menu or at least once they become aware that something is unavailable by the cook staff to immediately tell the customer. Waiting until the order has came out to tell someone they don't have something they ordered is a \u00a0unacceptable.So let's talk about the food. I ordered the beef tacos with extra cheese. This was great! I really like the cilantro with the cheese selection and the flour taco bread was on point. I definitely see myself if not coming back for the tacos alone doing takeout for the tacos. However my tamales that took an additional 10 minutes to get it were horrific. I've never had Mesa that tastes so awkward. Also I've never had the chicken sitting on top of the Mesa as well. \u00a0I was so disappointed with the food and service that I don't even bother complaining to server because I felt it would do nothing at all. My coworker had the enchiladas. She like the enchilada dish and it looks really great presentation wise um I didn't really care for the piece I had but she suggested they were very good to her.Overall I wasn't impressed with this restaurant. I'll be back for the taco, more than likely carry out. If you're looking for a chill spot or a place to watch the game with a drink & some tacos this will be a great place to go."], ["Brittany S.", "I get around. And when I say \"around\" - I mean I have eaten my fair share of authentic Mexican food. Chips and salsa till my teeth were ground to the gums. Ew gross, not really. But it would be worth it...If we were to play the scenario of being deserted on an island with one ethnic food of my choosing: it would be la comida de Mexico. Es la verdad. Top 5 reason Te Amo Los Chilaquiles:1. Amazing margaritas - not too sweet and prissy, yet not so strong that the tequila takes over2. chips and salsa that comes with regular and green salsas as well as a mild runny sour cream concoction3. unique menu - they have your basic Mexican dishes like burritos and tacos, but you'll also find unique items like hominy soup and beet juice (yyyyeeahhh!)4. beautiful new space - check out that sleek lighting ayayaya5.

Tacos.Seriously y'all. That's whats up. Spicy, salty, savory goodness. Put a splash of citrus-y lime all over, and ohhhh yeah. I mean realistically, I don't think there is a way where little corn tortillas, chorizo, cilantro and onion don't combine to create a delicious meal. Thrown in some refried beans and rice. I'm sold. I also love their horchata. I am a horchata fan in general, and theirs is pretty delicious. Also the chips you get pre-meal are good. Red salsa, tomatillo salsa, and a sour cream concoction. Yum. Also, the chilaquiles are something interesting to try that you won't see a lot of other places. But fortunately and unfortunately for me, I am so obsessed with chorizo, I have a hard time ordering anything else. Oh, and this place is priced very reasonably.

Yes, the cashier should have known, but you should have told her.\"I said that's fine, the buy one get one is honestly the least of my concerns, what about the fact that half of our meals were missing?I was told that all she could do was offer a discount the next time I came in and a free dessert.I'm sorry, but no, that's not acceptable customer service, as I have no plans on returning."], ["Julia C.", "Is this place gorgeous or what? Totally not what you expect looking from the outside. Los Chilaquiles is in my neighborhood, but we have never ventured in. Believe me, we will not be making that mistake again!

Some friends had heard good things, and invited us to dine there. On the way in, I noted the \"special margarita\" for $4.99 on the display board near the hostess stand. Upon being seated, we were given a basket of cold, non-delicious chips, some salsas, and some crema. For me it is a cardinal sin for a Mexican restaurant to serve bad chips--it's a deficiency that is basically impossible to overcome. We ordered some of the special margaritas and looked at the menu.As chilaquiles newbies, we needed the waitress to explain what the dish was. \u00a0We figured that if the restaurant is named for the dish, then chilaquiles should be the thing to order. \u00a0The waitress explained that chilaquiles is a dish composed of tortilla chips covered with toppings, such as pork, beef tongue, or chicken. \u00a0To me, it sounded like nachos without the cheese (my favorite ingredient). \u00a0In light of the fact that I didn't like their chips in the first place, I decided to order something different.The menu referred to \"our famous Molletes\", so that sounded promising. \u00a0I'm not Mexican, but I have eaten a lot of Mexican food both in the U.S. and in Mexico. \u00a0I was not familiar with the word \"mollete\", and the menu was no help either. \u00a0Oddly, the menu is in English, but it assumes that non-Spanish speakers are familiar with all the words. \u00a0For example: \u00a0\"Molletes Surtidos - 2 and 2 or mixed\". \u00a0Huh? \u00a0After the waitress explained that molletes were like tostadas on toast instead of tortillas, I opted instead for the Beef Tongue Gorditas. \u00a0My wife went for the Mole Poblano Chilaquiles.We waited a good long time for our dinners, though it wasn't very busy. \u00a0We drained our drinks waiting, but the server never asked if we wanted another round. \u00a0When the food finally arrived, neither dish was above average. The tongue was not as tender as expected, and my wife's mole had the same so-so chips that had come with the salsa. \u00a0Portions were smaller than most Mexican restaurants as well. \u00a0To top it off, our check showed the \"special margaritas\" at $9.99 instead of $4.99. \u00a0When I showed the waitress/cashier the sign, she said that was for 12 oz., \"but I gave you the 26 oz.\" \u00a0We didn't argue, but I doubt we will return to Los Chilaquiles.For friendly, affordable, fast, and delicious Mexican food, drive one mile further north to Puerto Vallarta at 56th and Lafayette. \u00a0We've been going there for about 15 years, and can attest that Puerto is THE local Mexican hangout of choice for Pike Township. \u00a0And their chips are fresh and warm every time."], ["Matt K.", "Great place right off the highway. \u00a0On our trip back from Florida, we were looking for a place to eat. \u00a0While driving in Indianapolis, we have attempted few times to get off the highway and look for a place to eat. \u00a0Well it turns out that have ended up in very shady areas. \u00a0Quick U turn and back on the road. \u00a0Then we came across this place. \u00a0I must admit, looking from the outside, tinted windows we didn't know what to expect. \u00a0But, once we stepped in we were taken back by the friendly and cozy atmosphere. \u00a0It looks new, clean, and staff was amazing. \u00a0We had two types of Chilaquiles, and they were out of this world. \u00a0I would strongly recommend this place when you are driving by or live in the area. \u00a0Situated right off the highway I found it very convenient, quick service, and great atmosphere. \u00a0I just wish it would be closer to my house :)I apologize for not taking any pictures. \u00a0I was hungry, and pictures that are uploaded are right on the money."], ["Cassie S.", "Definitely the best Mexican restaurant in the area. The margarita was pretty sweet, but not as sweet as I've had other places. The three salsas served with the chips are all good, and the guacamole is pretty impressive. I ordered the Arroz Con Pollo because it's a Mexican restaurant staple, and I figured it would be easy to compare to other places. My eyes got big when the server put the plate down -- let's just say it's what I would do if I made arroz con pollo -- add lots of veggies! Definite upgrade, and it was SO GOOD. Not too much cheese, but still super yummy. Vegetables includes zucchini, green bell peppers, and broccoli. Trust me, it's good. Served with a little guac, pico de gallo, and sour cream. My husband got the chicken in mole sauce, and he really liked that, too.I visited this place because of its great reviews on Yelp, and I wasn't let down! Will definitely be going back!P.S.

Bottom Line--It's very good.Went again last night 9-1-12 \u00a0 Tried other items. \u00a0All good! \u00a0The only slight complaint of mine is that the waitress didn't speak english well. \u00a0I just listened closely, I had patience, smiled and kept asking til I received an adequate answer."], ["Jody R.", "Excellent chilaquiles! \u00a0The restaurant is never busy when we have been there for breakfast. The sauces are all delicious and of varying levels of heat. I particularly like the habanero salsa as I like spicy food. I have not been in during the evening hours so I cannot attest to how loud or busy they get.

I really wanted some traditional chips and red salsa but they had a trio of sour creama, verde, and a darker red salsa. I mixed the salsas together and it was pretty good but I didn't get my fix. I think verde is usually to simple flavored to eat with chips. I had to google quite a few things to see what they were which was surprising. The service wasn't great and I had to get up to go remind waiter who was rolling silverware we needed to order. At least he was working and just had a brain lapse. I had a trio combination with rib tibs, verde enchilada, and a sopa. \u00a0For some reason I got a mole enchilada which they fixed with a verde chicken. I don't like mole ever however neither of them were very good and they are quite small and heavy corn flavor tortillas. The ribs were awesome and the sopa was good. My friend had a chicken burrito which was excellent and very different from other restaurants. Im not a bean fan and I ate two orders of refried beans. Not sure what kind they are but they were good.

Two words: thank God! Because that means I didn't waste more money on the horrible service and food than what i spent on my groupon.Starting with our service; I previously read a review where a lady complained about her service & someone affiliated with the restaurant thanked her and said they'd get the issues fixed - this was in January - what a joke!! I recently visited & I felt like they picked up anybody off the street who'd work. We never received any silverware, napkins, drink refills and it was difficult to request it since whoever our waitress was (we were \"assisted\" by 2 girls), never stopped at our table! We even had to eat with the empty chip bowl on our table because they were so unattentive. Overall, this was the biggest downfall. I just can't enjoy an evening with horrible service. The atmosphere was boring, to say the least. The TVs were on but there was an error message on the screen the whole time & there was no music - how lame. Once our food finally came out, they brought out 2 of the 4 meals - really!? After 10 minutes, they brought the other meals. I ordered the asada tacos for my son. To this day, I kick myself for making him eat it. Once he was finished, I tasted some 'meat'; it was all FAT! I'm talking, there was seriously 1 piece of actual meat for every 10 pieces of fat. It was disgusting. For myself, I ordered the chile relleno with cheese. Overall, the taste was not bad; it was edible, or so I thought. Once I reached the stem, I realized what the strange texture was.. It wasn't cooked thoroughly! There was still egg batter foam visible. I mentioned it to the waitress, who said she'd tell her manager; yet he never came to the table & nothing was done about it. At this point I was just fed up and ready to leave. Initially, I planned on not leaving a tip for the horrible service but the waitress let me use her phone to redeem my groupon, so I left her a couple bucks.I live closer to this Mexican restaurant then any other but I will NOT be returning; even for a free meal!"], ["Jon A.", "I wish I was hungover right now.

Yeah. I want it. Why? Because Los Chilaquiles says their chilaquiles are the best hangover food and cure around, and I want it. In more words than this they say on the back of their menu: it's tradition that the men of Mexico wake up in the morning and drink coffee and eat these chilaquiles because it's hearty and spicy and cures hangovers (read: fosters life and creativity).

I ordered Molletes -- which is mexican bread, butter, homemade cottage cheese (yeah, the crumbly, flaky kind) and honey. Whoa.

We sat down on a Saturday night around 6, the place had maybe 4 other tables. \u00a0Our server didn't seem particularly excited to be there but I really don't mind as long as you bring me what I ask for. \u00a0Unfortunately they had neither beer that I asked for so I had to settle with Horchata... not bad at all. \u00a0Next, my parents ordered Shrimp Fajitas and Chile Relleno. \u00a0I ordered a beef tongue burrito because after years of searching I have not been able to find a restaurant that serves tongue! \u00a0The burrito was muy grande and muy rico, definitely worth the wait (20 minutes is not that long... most people don't have any idea how long it takes to prep and cook fresh food well and make it look good) \u00a0The only hiccup during our meal was my dad's Chile Relleno which came out at least 6 or 7 minutes after the fajitas and the burrito. \u00a0I watched as servers brought other customers their meals.. but it was worth the wait. This was a whole Poblano chile stuffed with meat and cheese and breaded in a very nice, crispy crust. \u00a0It was decently spicy and looked great on the plate. \u00a0So all in all the slow, disinterested service was the only weak point of this restaurant. \u00a0I will definitely be back!"], ["Tamara Q.", "good food, friendly place for family.

I've always enjoyed the great Panela Sopes (a recommendation for vegetarians) and for meat dish the Tampiquena never fails to impress with it's flavor. Enchiladas verdes is another one I can always return to. The menu features more adventurous fare for those willing to give a chance. The restaurant has niche audience for those seeking something different than a Tex-Mex style. The new location features a bar too for those dining alone or who just want a drink after work.

I know that is a simple thing, but there are Mexican restaurants that can't get them right. The cheese dip and the cheese and bean dips are good. The large dips are more than 2 people can eat(most people). You can get Margaritas by the pitcher and can pay a small upcharge for a top shelf tequila. They do serve frozen and flavored margaritas. I go through cycles here where I will eat the same dish every time I go, then I will switch to something else. Right now I have been eating the Burrito Guadalajara. It has shrimp, chicken and steak in it. There is a green sauce and cheese sauce topping on it. It is really good and the shrimp in them are a medium to large size. I also like The Shrimp Diablo. It is a little spicy but with the name diablo I would expect my nose to be running by the end of the dish. It tastes great, but don't expect to be begging for water.My wife just gets soft and hard shell tacos. The beef tacos are really good. The are not greasy, they drain the meat well. I usually go with chicken tacos for that reason, but here I will get the beef. you can get them in a hard shell and they wont be soggy.The dessert I usually get is the flan.

Well, not in this case and I know why - but read on, I'll get to that.To be fair, we were seated adjacent to a large group of high school Spanish students on a lunch field trip. There was over 20 of them with two teachers. We placed our order just ahead of them. One order didn't come out, and when it did it was incorrect. Our waiter argued with my colleague, insisting that he had ordered chicken quesadillas. The three of us insisted that he hadn't, but the server decided his manager had to get involved. He soon appeared at our table and worked it out. The food itself was strictly OK - certainly nothing to rave about. After our mixup, the service was fine.Here's how Yelp let me down: I'm from Texas so for me the bar is set pretty high for Mexican food. Guadalajara's wasn't even close - but maybe for Indy it's just fine. So it's really not the fault of my fellow Yelpers. We all write based on our own experiences. I'll still swear by Yelp ratings - but not for Mexican food in the northern climes. Lesson learned."], ["Richard C.", "Good margaritas, average food, the big problem is if you have a large group.

It's doughy, gooey, fried, crunchy, fresh, and luscious at the same time. \u00a0How does one top such an extensive combination? \u00a0(NOTE: I assumed that a fork was necessary, but I did see someone fold her pupusa and eat it like a taco, leaving me envious that I had not thought of something so genius and portable.) \u00a0Second came the Sweet Corn Tamale. \u00a0This will throw you off at first if you've tasted a more savory traditional tamale before, but I would categorize this corn husk bundle of joy as dessert or a Central American corn pudding. \u00a0It's much sweeter than you'd expect, but authentic and delectable all the same.Both of these dishes are must-try's on your visit to 3 in 1. \u00a0If you can't make it, then be sure to keep an eye out for the pupusas at some of the local farmer's markets. \u00a0Don't let the opportunity to give yourself a more diverse palate pass you by."], ["Brittany S.", "Aww gee, I'm business crushing big time here, you guys.

It's all about the curtido (pickled cabbage/carrot slaw) for me. This crisp and refreshing topping is paired with the pupusas or tacos, if you like. What is a pupusa, you ask? Think of a tamale turned into the shape of a pancake and filled with beans or cheese or chicken or some combo of the three. Fun fact: 3 in 1 uses local organic corn meal.

Super excited to have been able to join fellow Yelpers at an UYE graciously hosted by DeAnna P. We started off with the homemade chips and salsa. Oh my word. The chips and salsa were incredible. The chips were so crispy and not greasy. The salsa was fresh, and I really liked the touch of sweetness to it. I didn't want to stop eating. That was until I had the fried corn balls. Pure perfection! Fried golden and simply delicous. I was enjoying the starters so much I almost forgot to order. Decisions, decisions, decisions. The staff member who took my order was nice and helpful. Of course I had to order a pupusa. The loroco and cheese pupusa piqued my curiosity. I was told that loroco is similar to artichoke. Sounded like a winner to me. I also ordered the flautas and a coke. Apparently you pay at the end of your meal. Unfortunately, I do not think they were properly prepared for our group in addition to the larger number of customers that came through during the typical lunch rush hours. So it took quite some time for everyone to receive their food, which is why I knocked them down a star. I'm not sure if this is typical, but they apologized and tried to keep things moving for the most part. Okay, now back to the food. Don't forget to stop by the condiment bar to find all the fixin's for your pupusa including the slaw. The pupusa and flauta were DELICOUS. I actually think I enjoyed the flauta more than the pupusa. Deep fried tortilla stuffed with chicken and cheese topped with lettuce and sour cream. It was heavenly. I tried to slow down, but I couldn't stop eating! The pupusa was also pretty dreamy. The loroco was tender and added a bit of texture. I wanted more when I was done, but I was stuffed! There is NO DOUBT that I will be back to 3 in 1. Family owned, inexpensive, GMO free ingredients, AND locally sourced and fresh ingredients. Definitely a winner to me! They are also present all over the city at various farmer's markets including the Carmel, Zionsville, Irvington, and City Market Original Farmer's Market. This is truly some of the best of Indy!"], ["DeAnna P.", "I have taken a while to do this review because I am so torn. \u00a0I will caveat this review that the four stars are for the events they attend, such as the Zionsville farmers market. \u00a0The food is amazing. \u00a0The pupusas are inexpensive and one of the best taco/quesadilla/tamale hybrid thingies I have ever had. \u00a0Think tamales if they had tons of melty cheese and meat in them, squished flat and grilled until they were crispy on the outside and smushy on the inside. \u00a0If you ever see them out, get some!!!Here's the part that makes me sad. \u00a0I loved them as vendors, so I wanted to try their storefront. \u00a0I actually did an UYE (unofficial Yelp event) with about a dozen attendees. \u00a0Here's where it went south. \u00a0We ordered as we trickled in over the course of about 20 minutes. \u00a0And we waited. \u00a0And we waited. \u00a0And still waited. \u00a0Finally at about the 50 minute mark, one of us had to get the food to go because it was lunch hour. I had a wriggly toddler, so I also tried to get my food to go, and then it was ready (minus the beans I had ordered). \u00a0Supposedly they thought all the food should come at once, but we had never indicated that. \u00a0I could see it as an honest mistake, but even still, 50 minutes is way too long to wait. \u00a0And it wasn't just us. \u00a0I tracked other tables and it took at least 30 minutes each for the other tables. \u00a0The food itself was delicious, but it was really stressful to go and have to corral a small child and try to keep my guests from being irritated at the long wait. I cannot recommend going here at lunchtime. \u00a0If you want a leisurely dinner, the food really is phenomenal. \u00a0They have a salsa bar with homemade sauces that are all perfectly spiced."], ["Xiao Z.", "Pupusas came out nice and hot.

You can mix and match between burritos, tacos, tamales, and pupusas.**The pupusas were delicious - filled with cheese, beans, and meat - mMmMmmM!!

Located in a strip of businesses with NOTHING else around. The food is simple and delicious, with locally sourced ingredients and a good wholesome 'family-values' vibe behind the whole operation. Prices are very reasonable and everything is a la carte so you can get a taste of a wide variety.Pupusas were the clear standout. The 'Mixed' was awesome, with shredded pork, cheese, and beans inside. Top with some curtido veggies and dive in. The sweet corn tamales were a new flavor for me and I think I prefer a traditional tamale to this version. The masa was a little too loose and the sweetness of the corn didn't jive with the chicken filling. I think this would be best without any filling at all, which they offer as one of the tamale options. I also had Flautas, which were amazing mostly because of how juicy and crispy they were. I love me some juicy and crispy. Not a place for an interesting ambiance or setting - you come here for the food.

The restaurant is relatively spare inside, but the food makes up for it (and then some). The pupusas are homemade with local ingredients and wow, they are delicious. Make sure to top them with the sugar that is provided (sounds odd to add sugar, I know, but it's delightful). Our group also tried the fried corn balls and the tamales, and these were outstanding as well. To top it all off, the prices are low, they have options that are vegetarian friendly, AND they're the only restaurant that I've found that serves horchata. This was a total win for us."], ["Marc K.", "Great food, excellent service, laid-back atmosphere and a commitment to local, high-quality ingredients.

The menu reflects many El Salvadorian dishes as well as Americanized Mexican dishes - a nice variety!While ordering at the counter, the owner explained some of the items to us, he was enthusiastic about his food and was anxious to help us with our order. They offer many items like pupusas, tacos, burritos, chimichangas, flautas and quesadillas (not to mention many appetizers as well). Order a few items to make a complete meal or you can make an item a combo for a little more (adds beans, rice and a drink). I ordered the chicken and cheese pupusa and a corn tamale. My wife (vegetarian) ordered the tacos and quesadilla - they offer a variety of meats or vegetarian versions of their menu items and they will gladly make them to order.While we were waiting for our food to be freshly prepared, they brought us out two of their popular appetizer items for us to sample - some delicious corn poppers. Wow, they were good; fried corn meal that they recommend dusting lightly with powdered sugar. Good as appetizer or dessert!Our food was brought out to our table and we proceeded to the fixings bar to load the dishes up with cilantro, onions, jalape\u00f1os, cole slaw and salsas. I loved the pupusa - it was a fluffy corn tortilla stuffed with the chicken and cheese - my wife and I both remarked several times about how much we loved their cheese. The tamale was tender and was excellent with some cilantro and salsa added to it. My wife loved the quesadilla and her tacos hit the spot.They offer pepsi products. I usually get iced tea at restaurants, I didn't see it on the menu so I opted for a mandarin orange Jarritos which complemented the meal quite well. next time I might go for the horchata.We were impressed with the food, and even though a lot of the ingredients were organic, it was still very affordable.

My boyfriend ordered the burrito. It didn't take more than 15 minutes for our food to come out. I was ready to dig in. After taking a few bites of my meal, I realized why I didn't visit this place more often. The food is just not that good. The tortillas was nice and crispy, but the dish itself was not very flavorful. My boyfriend did not enjoy his burrito. It was sloppily put together and bland. We were both underwhelmed.

It stayed this way for more than several years, It is now, sadly, on the decline to becoming what it once was.I was REALLY hoping that our last few times here were just \"off nights\"...but I was wrong. \u00a0The thing about La Ha, is that it's the only Mexican joint around the area. This is a good, and as of late a bad thing for La Ha. The food is on the decline, and the service is aberrant. They clearly can not keep up with the increase in business.I would post pics of our food, but we never got it. We were sat at where I can only imagine one other table would be worse to sit at, and that would be one next to the bathroom. It was a table that was an arms length from where the servers come out and go into the kitchen. UTTER chaos at your table....:) I looked around, and there were no other tables open.So, needless to say, we decided to have some drinks, and order our food to go. IMO, Mexican is as good carryout, as dining in, so we had no problems with that. Our server took our drink order, we said we would like some food to go. We drank our first round, and didn't see her for at least 15 minutes. She eventually came back, we ordered another round, and our food. We drank our second round of brews, and at the THIRTY minute mark we had enough. She NEVER came back. We noticed others had been sat, and ordered, and received their food after us. I only review experiences I've had, but in this case, I have to write of the gentlemen sitting next to me. He had a plate of what I'm guessing was supposed to be beef fajitas...IDK, but when they set the plate down, the look on his face was of one who just had a book of Sanskrit put in front of him, and someone said tell me what that says.....In our time of wait, we did have the \"opportunity\" to see the chaos in the kitchen, since it was....right there at our table! We noticed a kitchen staff arguing, and yelling at the wait staff. (GF and I were in the biz for a combined total of over 20 years, so this is common) but it got to the point where the servers were leaving the kitchen and not returning. Also we got to see servers pulling out tortilla chips with their bare hands. I normally have no issue with bare hands, unless they're the same ones used to pick up dirty dishes and dirty glasses. We weren't upset at not having our chips refilled at that point. We went to the front to pay for our brews, and the gentlemen who runs the checkout desk most of the time, I'm going to assume is the owner/GM, as he's been here since day 1. I don't know, but when we said we'd like to pay for our drinks, he asked if we had a bill. We told him no, never got one, or our to go food, and it's now going on an hour. His response only prompted me and my girlfriend to look at each other like we were Sanskrit. He said \"Yeah, I don't know what's going on in the kitchen, they are messed up or something\".....WHAT? So go fix it! Man if ever there is a place that needs Gordon Ramsay, it's here. I only hope they figure it out before they slip back to where they once used to be. They have Cinco coming up, but after that....eeeeek. Good luck to 'em.And just to emphasize things here, this review was NOT based on one bad experience. The time before this, we dined there and our food was cold, but the plates were hot. Time before that, our order was completely wrong...etc. etc. etc. I'm not posting a bad review because I was unhappy this one time. It's sad to see this place going back to a bad, shotty restaurant."], ["Sarah C.", "Hooray for wonderful Mexican restaurants! I'm tickled pink that this place will literally be minutes away from my soon to be new apartment. It's not a huge place - so don't be surprised when you walk in and it's filled with humans - stomachs growling. The waitress was quick to take our order and had our meals out in a timely manner. The chips and salsa, which are always a great start, really hit the spot. I should start to branch out more with my main dish, but I decided to stick with my usual \"Daniella's Special.\" Wasn't disappointed. I wasn't in the mood for a margarita that night, but boy oh boy did they look good. Very pleased with this place and I can't wait to head back."], ["Rick G.", "I've been to a couple of the other La Haciendas in town, but this one is way over and above the rest.The food is always hot, fresh, and tasty. \u00a0Our drinks are always kept refilled, and the servers are always friendly.Due to the location, the lunch and dinner hours can get quite crowded, so there might be a bit of a wait if you arrive at those times, but it's never been terribly long for us.I knocked a star off because, both times we've been there, the service has been great up till the time we needed our check, but then there was a bit of a wait. \u00a0Not terribly long, but long enough to knock a star off."], ["Avery B.", "Chicken fajitas are great , the food is constantly good sometimes there's a wait \u00a0it is reasonably priced and the Portions are generous"], ["Betsy W.", "They make a chicken soup that I crave quite a bit.

Of course, I'm not forced to go to the restaurant and dine, but otherwise the choices are to watch other people eat or miss out on the fellowship altogether. So I and my significant other usually go. As for atmosphere and food, this restaurant is about the same as most Mexican-run places around Indy, with its gringo-friendly (Tex-Mex style) fare. One week, we didn't feel very hungry and, aside from munching the free chips and salsa, ordered a side of chori-queso and later shared a dessert flan. I got no sense of resentment from the staff for \"going cheap\" and the queso was very tasty. The next week, I had a taco salad, which was OK though the refried beans and other ingredients in the bottom of the crispy tortilla bowl got a bit sloppy. I've definitely had better. Another week, I tried the \"Nachos Hacienda\" which the menu said came with chicken and sprinkled with shrimp - by this I presumed small salad shrimp, but instead there were several full size shrimp on the platter, along with the chicken and plenty of cheese and such for all the chips. This dish is highly recommended! I've also had regular combos with enchiladas and such, and while they aren't bad, they aren't write-home-about. Still, I've seen others order the chicken-and-rice and be amazed at how hearty the portion is. As for the service, they always put in a good effort, even with the little crowd we bring in. The last time I was there, the servers were handing me my usual water with lemon before I even had the chance to order. Bottom line is that this place is good (if Yelp allowed half-stars, I'd go 3.5) but not the best. Still, if you get to go multiple times (like me), take a chance on the various dishes on the menu instead of the same old combos you can get at 20 other joints around Indy."], ["Jonathan D.", "THE BEST MEXICAN FOOD IN INDIANAPOLIS!!!The service is on point as well as the food. \u00a0I have not had better salsa, better queso, or better margaritas anywhere. \u00a0The price is also pretty good besides the margaritas. \u00a0But really, how can you put a price on a good rita??? \u00a0My wife and I eat here once to three times a week."], ["Corrine P.", "I love this place.

First off the chips and salsa that are served before you order are great. hot fresh chips, and homemade salsa with a kick.

When it comes to last minute dining, if you can't come to a group consensus, you can easily default to Mexican. Everyone can find something on the menu they can enjoy, drinks are always an option, and if you are really hungry the traditional serving chips/salsa will give instant gratification.I have always heard that La Hacienda is one of the better Mexican restaurants on the north side. And, in a moment of extreme hunger and difficult decision making, I defaulted to Mexican. This should have been a slam dunk for La Hacienda because my level of hunger would have made anything taste outstanding. Well, they instead went for a lay up and tossed up a brick.The service was awful. We were seated quickly and our drink orders were taken instantly. However, it took probably 10 minutes to receive our drinks and another 15 to even check if we were ready to order. Someone in management happened to walk by our table, notice us just sitting there, and had to wrestle our waiter away from the female hostess... with whom he he was flirting with instead of serving his tables. I thought maybe this was an anomaly, so I brought it up with a friend who suggested the establishment so highly. His instant response was 'oh yeah, the service is always awful'. The salsa was bland, the guacamole was that neon green out-of-the-bag color, and presentation was nothing to get excited about. And, typically, I wouldn't expect anything less of a Mexican joint in this price range. \u00a0At this point in the game, the only thing left to distinguish yourself from the other restaurants of this caliber is price point (negative), service (definitely not), location/convenience (nope), or specials (not really).If you live nearby, want mexican food, and don't mind really apathetic and slow service - this will suffice. If you have any expectations at all of this establishment setting itself apart, you will \u00a0be disappointed."], ["Food C.", "One of my favorites.

It can vary though depending on who made it that day - but 90% of the time has a great cilantro kick.Food is cheap, quick, and tasty. Our personal favorites are the Quesadilla Verde, Pollo Fundido, Pollo Asada, or Taco's Asada (flour tortillas instead of corn). The queso is flavorful & the beers come in huge ICED frozen mugs.I would skip the fajitas in general - not always, but they tend be greasier than one might prefer.

Grilled chicken, refried beans, rice, just a hint of spiciness with a side salad of tomatoes, shredded lettuce, guacamole and a dollop of sour cream. All the ingredients needed for an amazing burrito. All for the price of $9.95. Not too bad. The service isn't too great, I thought I might have gone in at their closing time (3pm) but nope apparently they close at 10pm. There must have been a soccer game going on or something.

I usually don't stuff myself, but knew that I would likely not be back before I have the baby. The burrito was only $4 by the way! The horchata was $2.50 for an 32 oz cup. So total it came to $7.09. Not to shabby for a meal that fed two adults, for less than $10, plus it was seasoned really well on top of that, plus grilled to perfection! My whole intent was to grocery shop to take my mind off from my contractions, after we had ate. My son is such a good coach, he psyched me up to continue to grocery shop. I'm pleased that I took his advice, because now I can have another good meal tomorrow. It's wonderful that I still have him here at home with me. Now on the grocery store part, Love their meat, as a matter of fact, I have recommended my friends to shop here for there meat. I got 1 lbs of debola/thin sliced steak for $2.99 per pound. I also get para tacos/chopped steak for $3.29, but my son doesn't know how to cook it, so I skipped it this time, since he is the one that is going to be cooking until I'm able to again. Next I get onions for .49 a lb, tomatos for .69 a lb, chile peppers/jalape\u00f1os for .99 a lb, avocados .79 lb, but skipped on this to, because the were up to .89 per lb. This makes a difference when you have a lot of children who make guacamole almost everyday. The cilantro is only .49 each. Fideos/thin noodles for making sopas (latin macaroni dish) are 4 bags for a dollar. Last but not least corn tortillas for .99 a pkg, we use about two to three packs a day in my house.Me & my family can literally eat for a whole month here for about $200. I never paid more than that in one month here, unless it's the summer & I get a lot of fruit. At the end of the day, you don't have to take my word for it, just stop by & see for yourself. This place is definitely the go to place for Latin food shopping & eating!"], ["Neal P.", "There are two parts to this place: \u00a01) the grocery store, 2) the restaurant.1) the Grocery store: \u00a04 stars. \u00a0They have literally everything I've seen at any Hispanic grocery store, and at decent prices. \u00a0Fresh produce, canned items, meat, household supplies, kitchen stuff, gas burners, spices, the whole works. And a large variety of everything. \u00a0 You know those spice racks you see in other stores? \u00a0They had literally every variety of several brands here. \u00a0Roma tomatoes for only $1.19 when Marsh has them for $1.89/pound. \u00a0Avocadoes for only $.79/each.The only negative was that the meat department smell did permeate the whole place, and they keep it pretty cold inside. \u00a0Tonight when it was in the upper 60's outside, it was even colder in the store. 2) The restaurant: 2 stars. \u00a0My chicken burrito was great. \u00a0But the big negative was the filthiness of the place. The men's room, the floor of the dining area, dirty table-tops, dirty chairs, and the outer sides and tops of the trash receptacles were filthy. \u00a0 \u00a0They were not that busy when I got there, and 4 people were working in the restaurant, so they could have kept it cleaner. \u00a0 Also, the smell of the chicharon (fried pig skin?) in the big warmer was not a pleasant smell for me.The menu is limited to three main things: burritos, tacos, tortas (sandwiches). \u00a0You can get beef, pork or chicken. \u00a0The chicken burrito was made with breast-meat like it should be. \u00a0And constructed with an \"all on the inside\" style, including lettuce and tomato inside instead of on the side. \u00a0Served in a paper-lined thin cardboard dish, with cucumber slices and lime wedges. \u00a0 The tortilla wrapper was good, but kind of hard to cut with the flimsy plastic fork and knife. They don't serve chips, appetizers or sides, and beverages are limited to the Mexican specialty drinks, either smoothies, or bottled sweet fruity drinks. \u00a0No waiter service.

Enchiladas de Pato (Duck Enchiladas) 5/5 - WOW! \u00a0One of the best enchiladas I've ever had. \u00a0You can't go wrong getting this. \u00a0Tampiquena (Flat Iron Steak) 4/5 - I was craving steak the last time I was here, so settled for this. \u00a0It was exactly what I wanted. \u00a0Grilled, juicy and tender with a dollop of guacamole and pickled onions on top. \u00a0I was in heaven. \u00a0The queso enchilada with mole sauce was a nice accompaniment! \u00a0I thought it was still missing something so I got the fried plantains and it paired up perfectly with everything. \u00a0 Margaritas 4/5 - Strong and tasty, but for $8 I'd rather go to Javier's and get a $20 pitcher. Desserts 4/5 - The churros come with a chocolate dipping sauce and they are great, everyone at the table will certainly be pleased. \u00a0The flan is also good, but still your typical flan. \u00a0A chocolate or coconut flan would have been great.SERVICE 4/5Host seems a little full of himself, and last time our server just didn't seem very attentive. \u00a0Other than that, service has been on point.AMBIANCE 5/5From the lighting to the decor, it's just such a cool place to eat. \u00a0Perfect for any occasion, really -- thought I wouldn't say \"kid-friendly\". \u00a0There were people here on dates, with family and grouped with friends."], ["Allison F.", "Somehow out of all of the places I've tried in Indy, Delicia is the most frequented. \u00a0I know that I can bring out-of-towners and locals alike to this place and experience a quality meal. Please don't take the duck enchiladas off of the menu ever!"], ["Ed M.", "Some of the best \"Mexican\" food I've had since moving to Indy last year. We started off with guacamole; the freshness of the avocados and lime is what makes this worth the extra chips.(Fresh Made)My wife had the De Palmitos salad, sharing some of the kids chicken tacos. The salad was light and not overly dressed. It was a nice combination of different vegetables. The chicken used in the tacos was flavorful and not dried out. I had the duck enchiladas! Get this, its that good! Duck in enchiladas is a combination that I didn't think of prior to this(especially in Indiana). Everything about this dish was great. The flavor \u00a0of the duck and the nice pairing with the herbed rice and black beans. For drinks the margarita is great and you can't go wrong when they use fresh lime and not the pre mixed stuff. The Fire n Ice cocktail was a wonderful surprise. The heat of the drink doesn't start off strong but builds delightfully as the ice sphere melts into the drink. We finished off with the churros and chocolate cake. The cake was light and not super rich. A nice touch to end a wonderful meal!"], ["Laura H.", "You may not have known you needed fine dining Mexican food in your life (I didn't), but you do and Delicia is here to give it to you. The cocktails are inventive and tasty. The food is unique and just overall outstanding. The service could be a bit more attentive, but it's always friendly. Every time we go we expect to spend more because it just feels like an expensive, upscale place, but the prices are lower than you'd expect."], ["Cary H.", "We have been to Delicia on multiple occasions and the food is always great! Wonderful collection of entrees--not just one country's style, but variations of several different South American and Latin American options. Prices are very reasonable for the amount and style of food. Delicious drinks, too. The last time we were there, I tried a Blood Mary that had a splash of stout (Scarlet Lane Dorian Stout) in it--great combination that I would never have thought would work."], ["Ali O.", "I've been on several occasions, each just as lovely as the next. Terrific atmosphere (gorgeous bar area!) and service. Cocktails are pricey (e.g., the Noble margarita is $13) but a worthwhile indulgence; I'm particularly fond of the pisco sour and fire and ice (beware of the heat!). If you're seeking big ol' \"American\" portions, this is unlikely to be the dining destination for you. The starters and salads serve as tasty teasers en route to the main course. As a vegetarian who does not eat seafood, I typically order the enchiladas de verduras and happily tote the leftovers home. My dining partners always rave about their meaty meals. Go and be sure to save room for the wonderful desserts!! Dinner for two (one round of drinks, a starter, two entrees, & dessert) will easily run $100 with tip. If you desire these flavors without the price, I recommend that you visit La Mulita, the casual place next door with which Delicia shares a kitchen. It's a good time and much easier on the budget!"], ["Will C.", "South and Central American cuisine with wonderful flavors not found many places. Honest and fresh flavors, our waiter was very helpful in getting the four of us a just right dinner. Great spot. Ultra yum."], ["Jessica C.", "It was ladies night a few weeks ago so Delicia was the place to be for us. I'm not a fan of the parking but overlook that aspect and the food, atmosphere, and drinks totally make up for it. I ordered the Sparkling Bird which was wonderful. If you have a drink with any sort of sparkling wine in it, I'll be all over it. After much mulling over, I decided on the tamal corn cakes. My girlfriend had them before on a prior visit and said they were delicious. We had a few appetizers that included the guacamole and the trio of salsa. The salsas were good, especially the tomatillo. I loved the guacamole and will order that again.My corn cakes arrived and they look like a work of art. I don't know how I did it but I ate both of them. I may be tiny but a girl can eat and I just couldn't imagine taking these home. I was stuffed! I didn't leave any room for dessert even though I was eying the churros and chocolate. I would recommend getting their early. We did at 5:30 and it seemed like after that, it got busy quickly and they do not accept reservations. Don't let that factor into your next visit though. This place is worth it if you have to wait. You won't be disappointed."], ["Amanda K.", "Absolutely fantastic and one of the best restaurants we've been to, not just Indy, but any city!

The acompa\u00f1ientos all sound really good, we had the tostones and sweet plantains and were really good as well.

I'm not from Indy, and consulted my best friend, in situations like this (Yelp). I liked the look of the menu, so I went to Delicia's on Saturday when it was snowing hard. I arrived at 5pm, and was able to get a table with no problem. By the end of my meal, at 6pm, the restaurant was busy even with the snow falling outside. The restaurant was a nice place, not too fancy, but not too casual either. It was just right for friends, groups, or dates. People looking for a bit nicer dining experience can eat here without breaking the bank. Yelp classified it as Mexican, but it's not your usual Mexican. It's upscale, and there's no complimentary bowls of chips and salsa. I had the house salad to start with, which was bigger than your usual house salad, and the ingredients were fresh. There wasn't any crunch to it and the orange tamarind dressing wasn't very overpowering. For the main meal, I was undecided between the CHILE EN NOGADA (roasted poblano pepper, ground pork, beef, apricots, cinnamon, raisins, walnuts, goat cheese salsa, herb green rice) and the ANCHO PEACH PORK. The server recommended the Chile en Nogada. I fell in love with this dish. It was mindblowing! It was sweet and savory, and not spicy when you blend everything together. I would strongly recommend this dish if you have a sweet tooth. I was so full after dinner, the portion was huge, but I had to have dessert. Picking the dessert was another difficult decision, and again, I enlisted my server's help. I hadn't had churros in months, and was craving them, but the tres leches looked special with guava compote and lime meringue. The server said it was a difficult decision, but she would say the tres leches. Again, she didn't let me down, the tres leches was one of the best I've ever had. The lime meringue had the texture of hard whipped cream, which accompanied the cake really nicely. The cake was very moist. I forgot that I was full after one bite. I finished it with ease.I also had one drink, the fire and ice. It had jalapeno infused vodka, and it was spicy but with a hint of sweetness and I loved it. I'm so sad I don't live in Indy, because I would return to Delicia again and again!"], ["Courtney B.", "I have to say the best parts about this place are the drinks, venue & waitstaff. Their Mojito is the best I've had in Indy - crisp and refreshing...oh so yummy. Their jalapeno drink was spicy and awesome -- I loved the large ice cube filled with jalapenos. This place is gorgeous and offers a lot of seating. Our waiter was splendid -- 5 stars for his service. The food on the other hand wasn't my fave -- we tried their queso and pork tacos and I love a yellow cheesy queso so I was surprised when our dish arrived looking more like a salsa dish. I will say my gal pals duck tacos were delicious -- perfectly flavored. \u00a0They open at 4p so head here for a fantastic HH & try their mojito!"], ["Brad F.", "Amazing... \u00a0 Really tasty food at surprisingly decent prices. \u00a0 Layered flavors and a good amount of it."], ["Angela M.", "Absolutely amazing.Started with the salsa trio which was okay..

I stuck mostly with the middle spicy one and sent the basket back empty. I also enjoyed my first ever bottle of Jarritos lime soda.

And this place does a pretty good taco. My fave would be the cochinita pibil, a mound of shredded pork with a yummy (but not too hot) habanero salsa. The fish taco, as other reviewers have noted, is good, but not what I'm used to. The fish is more of a super crispy, battered fillet like one would expect with a fish n' chips basket, in my opinion. Chips and salsa (particularly the green one) here never fail to disappoint, and although the queso isn't your usual Tex-Mex fare, it's tasty. NB: keep a spoon handy, because it's basically a giant skillet of pure melted cheese, and it turns into one giant cheese patty pretty quickly.And the drinks here? Something for everyone and every budget. Who doesn't love PBR in a cute glass boot for $2? If you're feeling classier and have a little more cash in your wallet, I like the Manhattan. The one drink I would not recommend (sadly) is the house margarita. It's mostly mix, and very little tequila.

Yes only one. Our poor waiter was like are you guys sure that's all you want. We explained to him that we weren't very hungry and off he went. Wow what a mistake we made. We devoured our tacos and of course instantly wanted about a million. We were in love. We of course have been back 3 times in two weeks.

Still need to try the milanesa torta, supposed to be tasty!Also I do a lot of take out from here, cause the food is so darn good and I can then avoid the crowds and/or wait.

We also ordered a queso and a queso w chorizo....both were incredible. \u00a0It was so good we forgot to take a picture but seriously, DO NOT leave without eating some queso. Fish taco w mahi was about perfect. The fish was done just right and the slaw was just the right amount and flavor. Also had the pollo, short rib and pork tacos. All were amazing.

But also expect that the margarita in your hand while you wait will be delicious and will help the time pass. Also, there's literally only one stall in the bathroom... so... hold it.

I appreciate that he takes popular Mexican dishes and kicks them up a notch with unique flavors and more vegetables. Note: the tamales are made with olive oil not lard.

This mound of deliciousness is served with a side (the potato hash was chock full of peppers and flavor) and unlimited house-roasted coffee for $9.

I was working at the library next door (Washington and Rural intersection, near the Lighthouse shelter) and noticed that this formerly blighted building had a fresh coat of paint. When I was leaving the library I walked over to check it out and saw a little sign advertising Mexican food. New, you say? Restaurant, you say? Naturally, I walked right in...without even consulting Yelp! Such a daredevil, I am. I had 2 tamales, salsa, and a Jarritos and my total was $8.50. The tamales are made with olive oil, not lard, and there are vegetarian and VEGAN options! My vegetarian friends are always worried that their beans have been seasoned with pork fat, so it's nice to find a place that doesn't use this ingredient. I also tried some charro beans (pintos with SOY chorizo) and they were very tasty. The downside is there is only one seat so you really need to take your food to-go. Not one table, one seat. SUPER clean little restaurant, you can see the entire operation when you come in the front door. I had a nice chat with the owner about where he was from, his life \"pre-Tlaolli,\" and some of the places we had traveled to. Nice guy, great food, I'll be back whenever I'm in the area, I'm sure. Tamale options are pinto bean (vegan), pork, chicken, or cheese and poblano (vegetarian). There are also soups, quesadillas, and some entrees/specials.

You often hear rumors of such, only to be disappointed when you've managed to track one down. That was not the case for me during my first visit to Tlaolli.We were greeted by several smiling faces as soon as we walked in on a sunny afternoon for a late lunch. It's a small, but pleasant joint and it looked very well kept. For some reason, I can't seem to recall what was in this building previously... There is a small bar along a wall & a table behind the building, so seating is a bit limited, but I enjoy those types of cozy hole-in-the-wall places.They offered a daily special, which I can't seem to recall at the moment, but I was there for tamales. As it was my first time in, I was given a succinct run-down of their story, including the fact that the tamales are made with olive oil rather than the traditional lard, as well as the two options of the day -- chicken and cheese & poblano. Yes, please.We ordered three of both choices plus a large salsa verde for the two of us and grabbed two sodas from the self-serve cooler. I'm thinking the total was about $25, which seemed more than fair to me for the amount.Man, those were some good tamales. I literally said, \"This is exactly what I needed today\" as we ate. I really enjoyed the chicken tamal, completely covered in their salsa verde, but then I tried the cheese tamale and was extremely pleased. The texture was perfect, the ratio of filling to masa was ideal, and the filling itself was awesome. No shady ingredients and these things really tasted homemade -- especially in comparison to the bought-in options at other places around town.I also feel obligated to specifically point out how much I enjoyed the salsa verde. So many other places treat salsa as either an afterthought or a tool used to disguise sub par dishes, but that was not the case here. Great, fresh flavors and a nice consistency... I could see myself putting this on just about everything. tl;dr: Cute place with great tamales made with olive oil and awesome fresh homemade salsas."], ["Deidre F.", "Delicious, fresh, healthy Mexican food. We ordered carry out and were able to watch our food be made to order. Everything was delicious! There are several vegetarian and vegan options available.

The chorizo was a bit lack luster the couple of times I had it but I would order it again. \u00a0Not bad.The tortas are on some seriously fluffy bread. I recommend eating them fresh because if taken to go the moisture from the sandwich fillings will take away a lot from the bread.

We arrived on a Friday night to find a shockingly empty dining room (there was a pacers game that night so it may have been busier earlier). With only about half of the main floor seating filled and no one seated upstairs, I figured we were in for an evening of great food and service. We quickly ordered a house margarita, a Dos XX, and the guacamole while we looked the menu over. As several have described, the guac is made table side and is every bit as delicious as all the previous reviews describe. The Dos XX was standard, and the margarita, ordered with sugar instead of salt, arrived with salt anyway. The flavor was good and it was made with quality ingredients. Still, $5.50 for 12 oz of Dos XX and $9 for a small house margarita seemed a bit steep. Oh well, it was date night and we have the groupon. Settling on the Chile Relleno and Puerco tacos, we enjoyed our guac and drinks while we waited. All the food was delicious, but the Chile Relleno stole the spotlight for the night. So, if we had pretty good service and great food, how can I give 3 stars? The meal I described was $70 total including a tip. I'm sorry, but for the portions we received it just isn't worthy of that price point. Without the groupon, I simply wouldn't go back."], ["Beth W.", "Used a Groupon here tonight.

However, it was a foodie free-for-all when we descended on the restaurant.While pina has long been the preferred juice drink in my circle, the supper club members ordered about each one and passed them around. Clear winners, in my humble opinion, were a refreshing cucumber juice and an avocado drink which was thick, sweet and creamy. I ordered the Mango juice, which arrived on ice and started out a bit thin, but finished full and sweet. The juices were accompanied by fresh tortilla chips and a Salsa Verde made with heaps of avocado and cool cilantro which balanced the fiery jalapenos. While a bit spicy, none of the competing flavours suffer.The entrees came. I decided on ribs, which were fantastic. Served smothered in a sauce which looked like mole, flavours of clove and cumin combined with the meat to make a serving. These spices confused my palate at first, and it wasn't until the ribs were shared and discussed were these notes identified. A chicken soup made its rounds, as did warm empenadas, thick enchiladas, and a wonderfully chocolately Chicken Mole.While the menu isn't extensive, it doesn't need to be. Everything Miguel, the owner, and his family do is done right and well.

The menu is sparse, but every single thing we ordered (including the licuadas and the cafe) was incredible... INCREDIBLE.The owner/chef was there chatting with us, and his daughter waited on us, and I couldn't stop telling them both how great everything was.The corn chips are fried fresh, the salsa was probably the best I've ever had, the corn tortillas are homemade, the barbacoa was delicious, the empanadas were crispy and mad flavorful, and the tamales were moist, wrapped in banana leaves, and perfect. It was all perfect.And it's pretty damn inexpensive."], ["Jen N.", "The Indianapolis International Supper Club visited Oaxaca for the July dinner, and it was a wonderful discovery for me. First of all, let me mention the avocado smoothie. Yep, that's right, avocado. It is lightly sweetened and not too thick, and must be around 24 oz or so. Next we'll move on to the salsa. Unlike most Mexican restaurants, their standard salsa is verde (green) style. It is painfully delicious! Even the diners who don't like spice couldn't keep themselves from eating it. They add chunks of avocado to give it a slightly creamy flavor. I had a really hard time choosing my entree, and ended up going with the tacos dorados (I believe that's what they were called). They are what I would typically call flautas. They had a nice spiciness to them. I got 6 of them with beans, rice, and a delicious salad with a light dressing and even more avocado! (I do love me some avocado.) I also tried a cheese empanada, which was tasty and went really well with the salsa verde. It sounded like nearly everyone thoroughly enjoyed their choices. Jon A got a fish that was cooked whole, but looked fantastically delicious when he started removing the meat to go in his fresh made tortillas. That is what I'll be trying on my next visit. Others ordered marinated goat, which they said was great. (I'm not much of a goat fan myself, so I'll take their word on that one.) Still others had ribs and meat filled empanadas. Only a few minor drawbacks. It didn't seem that there were many options for vegetarians. Also, unless you like extreme amounts of sweetness, I would not recommend getting the mango drink. It is really thick and syrupy. (Though I do believe they made it with fresh mangoes. That is just their texture when juiced.) But if you do enjoy extreme sweets, this should be considered a big plus for you! And finally, it would be nice if they would get permission to serve beer. A couple bottles of Mexican brew would have gone great with my dinner. If they do get a liquor license, I believe it will raise my review to 5 stars. The restaurant is near 30th St on MLK Dr on the near westside. It has street parking and ample seating inside. We even managed to get enough tables in a row for our very large group to all sit together. Oh, and as best as I can make out, the pronunciation is woa-HA-ca? Don't quote me on that, I could be way off. But even if you can't pronounce it, you should definitely go there. Enjoy!"], ["Brenton A.", "Oh. My. Lord. I've found it. My new Mexican Mecca. Cheap, and utterly mind-blowingly delicious. Absolutely everything, perfect, beginning to end. The chips and salsa alone will have you tangoing.

Everything feels full flavored, authentic, and laboriously crafted, but the service never feels slow. I needn't bother recommending any specific dishes. Nothing here will disappoint. \u00a0Get your favorite, and try something new, and you'll always be satisfied.This is the standard by which all Mexican food must be judged."], ["Becky Y.", "So I'm driving down Michigan Rd, hungry, and considering a detour over to Lafayette, when I realize I'm way overdue at Oaxaca.

Generous meat fillings are coated with a wonderful balance of spice.

Too bad they don't do fish tacos. they would be absolutely killer.makes that little west coast taco truck product look laughingly ridiculous.Thumbs down: I was the only 'guest' in the house the whole time I was there.

I was excited to dine here with my Mexican cuisine dining partner due to all the great reviews. We were the only people in the joint for the whole time we were here. The server was very friendly, sweet and had a very warm smile. There are no alcoholic beverages. No iced tea, either. The salsa was verde and SPICY- Wonderful! I had some empanadas, and my stomach felt a bit unsettled by the end of my meal, but I think it's because I stuffed SO much greasiness in it. The rice & beans were good, and the refried beans actually had a bit of flavor to them. I'm not a huge fan of refried beans, but I kinda liked these. The place looks a little cluttered full of weird stuff (like paper gingerbread men hanging from the ceiling?), and the women's restroom, while a bit hidden- it's behind the door to the kitchen area- was actually really nice.

My expectations about the decor were low, and they were still just barely met. \u00a0The service was atrocious. It was about 1:00 pm, and whatever \"lunch rush\" he'd happened was already over. There were tow other small parties in the restaurant,yet it took the server well over five minutes to greet us and bring menus (I guess that should have been \u00a0warning). We were both surprised to see the price - all the reviews talked about how in inexpensive this place was. \u00a0Pricing was higher than our usual Mexican go-to (Cancun). I selected a chicken quesadilla and my wife ordered beef tacos. \u00a0I did enjoy the salsa verde very much, although the accompanying chips seemed to be out of a box. \u00a0My wife asked if there was a red salsa option, something a little milder, and the server eventually brought out something that seemed to be a cross between tabasco and tomato juice.Again, we waited for almost twenty minutes for our food. Maybe the problem was caused by the to-go order (it looked like it might have been three items) that one of the other servers finally left with.When the food finally arrived, we had to track down the waitress to come back with silverware and napkins (yes, we'd been sitting without them for \u00a0nearly half an hour now). My quesadilla was pretty good, but nothing incredible. \u00a0The chicken and cheese were fine but I was hoping for more flavor. \u00a0I finished off the last of the salsa verde and made my meal pretty good, meanwhile my wife was very dissatisfied by her tacos. \u00a0The steak was fine (but again, nothing exceptional), but there were no other toppings except cilantro and lime - no cheese nor vegetables. \u00a0The worst part were the tortillas - chewy and greasy, it seemed they had been heated in luke warm oil. After we ate what we wanted, I asked for a box of the leftovers, and again,we waited. At this point, there was absolutely nothing going on in the restaurant, although we'd now seem four or five employees going in and out the kitchen area. More waiting for our check, which came in at $16.50 for just the two meals plus waters which never got refilled. I gave the server a twenty and wanted to get rid of some change that I'd been carrying around in my pockets and waited another couple minutes for her to come back with my change. \u00a0I realized that she was not coming back, thinking that she deserved a 25% tip on really awful service. When I asked for my change, she brought it out in dollar coins (just plain weird). Needless to say, we won't be going back."], ["Joseph O.", "This restaurant was dirty, kitsch, and more brightly colored than a day care. And incredible. My lady and I went in with fairly low expectations and came out with full stomachs and a promise that we'd be back on the weekend. \u00a0The beef torta was tasty, deliciously fresh with avocados and a simple slice of ham. The girl had three chicken tacos which had just the right amount of cilantro.The service was OK. \u00a0Again, I didn't expect much but the guys were nice and didn't bother us.All in all, it was great and I will be back as promised. \u00a0Get the Torta!"], ["Kori W.", "The food is great!

We ate here last night and besides the restaurant location not being that favorable, everything else was great. There's ample parking in the lot out front, the dining room is decent sized with approx 12 tables, the service is good (one girl waited on our group and she was very pleasant & efficient) and the food was outstanding. One of the many highlights of the evening was the baskets of thick crisp tortilla chips served with bowls of green salsa. The fresh green salsa was fabulous - it was almost creamy-like and had cilantro & onion & peppers and big chunks of avocado. Note: this salsa was darn spicy but the heat was not unbearable. Since I was there with a group of friends I was able to sample more than just my meal. The mole (chicken) was the best I've had. It was thick, rich with spices and very chocolaty. And, it didn't have that grainy texture like so many other mole sauces. The tamales (chicken) were wrapped in banana leaves and were moist & delicious. The biggest hit with me was my meal, the goat barbacoa. The barbacoa had large pieces of slow roasted bone-in goat that were juicy, tender and greasy (greasy in that yummy good way) and it had so much great, meaty flavor that I really can't stop thinking about it. The \"au jus\" it was sitting in was intoxicating - I ran forkfuls of my rice and my beans through it with every bite. They also brought out covered dishes of homemade corn tortillas that were thick and piping hot. To drink I ordered an avocado smoothie that was delicate, light & creamy. I also tried the cucumber agua fresco and it was extremely refreshing. Both drinks really complimented the style & heat of the dishes served. After our meals we were brought out some hot, crisp churros rolled in sugar & cinnamon. These were a great finish to our awesome dinner. I overheard the waitress tell someone that her favorite dish is the empanadas so I think I know what I'm ordering next time."], ["J C.", "Oh god, that green salsa burns, but it just feels so right. Everything about Restaurante Oaxaca does! It's snuggled in a strip mall and is sparse inside, with some booths and a few tables. The pineapple licuades is more refreshing than sticking your feet into an ice-maker, as I know now, since I did that last week in a drunken sweat. Screw you unbearable summer heat. The homemade tortilla chips are G and I love the empanadas so much that I don't care how fat I feel after eating all that fried stuff. Get an assortment of fillings, as they're all delicious. The tamales are also very tasty! And the owner and his family are kind and welcoming.

Seriously you need to try this place out. It isn't much to look at and isn't in the best of neighborhoods, but this place is everything a Mexican restaurant should be but isn't in this town.

If you are coming from the South it is a little hard to spot, but it is just south of I-65 on the West side of the street. There couldn't be more than 10 tables inside. Menu is up on the wall (along with the specials), but servers do come out to wait on you - although it might take a while. They immediately bring out chips and the best dawg'on green salsa I have ever tasted. I'm not sure what all was in it, but it was so good I wanted to ask if they could bottle it for sale. The chips were unfortunately nothing special - just like you might buy in the supermarket. But drench them in the salsa and it just didn't matter. I ordered the taco special - 3 chicken tacos with rice and beans. Very authentic - soft shells, shredded chicken, onions cilantro and lime. Served with a side of more green salsa (yeah!) and spicy red salsa. The total was $3.26. I had to ask her to repeat that because it couldn't be true.

Fantastic, fresh & delicious Mexican food. \u00a0It's also cheap. Great quality. Yummy guac!"], ["Jesse B.", "Had a small chicken burrito, a chicken taco and a steak taco. It was absolutely delicious with super fresh ingredients and flavors galore. I was completely stuffed for about $7. Highly recommend, will eat there again."], ["Andrea S.", "Excellent authentic tacos and horchata! \u00a0I will be trying the tamales next!"]], "Carniceria Guanajuato": [], "La Margarita": [["Leah M.", "Really great food and a good selection of beers including some locals. The three types of salsa are awesome."], ["Megan A.", "I went here for the first time last night and loved it! The atmosphere is fun and relaxing. The patio is just open for drinks until sometime in May, but I had the best time waiting for my table by having way too many margaritas, watching people on the cultural trail, and playing with the puppies that people brought along with them. :) The staff is uber kind! We had Sean as a waiter and he was truly helpful to introduce us to the food! You receive chips along with three salsas. I enjoyed them all along with getting the taco salad (which was huge!). I am definitely returning and I will probably try the fish tacos!"], ["Jeff K.", "Veggie Tamales!!! \u00a0 Even a non veggie-tarian needs to try these (I recommend the pablano)"], ["Brittany S.", "This place is really starting to feel like home for me. Two visits in the last week can mean a few things: 1.) I drink too much; 2.) I should cook more at home; and, 3.) I love the vibe Jon has going on here. It's like a small town restaurant smack dab in the middle of the city. The bartenders know you by name and everyone is laid back without being slothlike. \u00a0Mis cosas favoritas a La Marg (a little (probably incorrect) college Espanol for you dear reader):**Outdoor seating with a prime people watching location along The Cultural Trail**Pico de gallo = = = I could eat spoonfuls. Chips are served with three salsas: pico, verde and hot/spicy**The guac is chunky perfection. For those of us who love onions and raw goodness - in for a treat!**I often find myself ordering a big platter of refried beans to serve as the cherry on top to my usual pico parties. **I recently had a new favorite dish: prepare yourself for a halfass description: similar to enchiladas - one veggie, one chicken, with sauce and cheese - the grilled veggie of the two was my favorite**Bartender Stephanie is a roving party - not only does she make killer bebidas but her outward appearance in and of itself oozes coolness"], ["Kimmi M.", "I've been here a few times, and needless to say, I was a little bleary/worse for wear & tear. (Steph D & Britt S can attest). Let's be honest, at my first SOBER time at La Margarita, I was extremely pleased with the outcome of the meal. First of all, pretty lady/OG blue haired badass Stephenie at the bar suggested mojito margaritas, which were on summer special for $6. All I can say is wow to those. Fresh muddled mint combined with margarita. I really like that LM gives you three salsas. We ordered the guacamole app, and while a little odd with the not smashed, but diced avocado situation, it was truly delicious especially topped with the green salsa from the chip basket. I had the three carne asada tacos. They were prepared well, juicy and seasoned nicely. I do have to say by this point I had eaten about 6 avocados so I was pretty full, struggling to find my inner Joey Chestnut, and eat these three tacos. The plate comes with this super rice and more guac. I managed to get through it, and could feel my food baby kicking by the time our server brought the check and I finished my second mojito marg. I loved La Margarita. All components including patio space, service, drinks, and food made me so happy that I could have taken a food induced coma nap."], ["Julie A.", "We tried this place out for the first time today,It was so good!!The staff is super nice and cute too!"], ["Twinkle V.", "I seriously love the food at this restaurant. After dining here a few times, it seems it is consistent, original and just a great atmosphere.The service is top-notch. Every wait person I've had has been fabulous. Food on time, drinks filled timely and all-around niceness.Only one issue recently with the hostess, who may have been nice on another day, but was absolutely horrid while we were waiting. WE were told the wait was 20-25 minutes and waited for over an hour without anyone even checking on us or apologizing, watching two-tops who were there after us be seated while our 4-person group still waited. Hello. push a few tables together. Also, don't be angry when we express concern because we have yet to be seated. OTHERWISE - Diamond margs rule and the food is fantastic.Prices are middle to high depending on your entree. I'll def go back, just hope their is a different hostess! :)"], ["Benjamin M.", "Aloha Burrito Azteca!Yeah, I know I'm mixing cultural cuisines, but after only one bite of the tender pork inside this large burrito, I was instantly transported back to one of Oahu's luaus from a dozen years ago when my brain and taste buds started screaming \"Kalua Pork!\" I couldn't believe how similar it tasted and I expressed my enjoyment to the bartender multiple times. Unfortunately, only half the burrito was filled with pork and the other half consisted of spicy, shredded chicken. I'm not saying it wasn't good, but I was already spoiled and not looking back at that point.If you're stopping by for drinks and a fan of tequila, you'll be very content as that list is longer than the actual menu. I opted for a margarita without salt, a sweet selection to accompany dinner. Also, complimentary chips and and three different salsas will get your appetite going while waiting for your meal. Just make sure you have your drink or water close at hand if you start dipping into the hot one.Lastly, which probably should've been noted first (that dang pork got me again!), don't let the raw exterior deter you from coming in here. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but just continue down the short hallway and through the main door to the large and welcome dining area. You'll be pleasantly surprised. Mahalo and gracias."], ["Kayla H.", "Spent the day in Fountain Square to celebrate my bday and I'm SO glad we stopped here for lunch. I polled my social network before coming down here on what to do in Fountain Square, and nearly everyone insisted that I had to check out La Margarita. From the moment we walked in, the service levels were fantastic. We ate on a Saturday afternoon (around 2:30) and had absolutely no wait. The hostess was incredibly friendly and was happy to indulge my curiosity about her reading material and we bonded over our shared love of John Green and Harry Potter :)Our server was happy to make recommendations on the incredible beer list, and the manager even popped over to our table to see if he could answer any questions when he noticed me geeking out over it at the table. The quesadillas were good, though, they come with the sour cream on top and got a little soggy along the way - and confession: I totally filled up on chips and beer. I know my boyfriend loved his chimichangas though!The real stars here were the drinks and the service. I can't wait to come back make my way through that beer list and maybe try one of those margaritas!"], ["Melissa B.", "La Margarita is probably one of the better choices of the many Mexican restaurants in Fountain Square. It's awesome during the summer, because they have a huge patio on the corner. It's also a pretty good size for Fountain Square in general with a large bar area. It can get pretty noisy during the busier hours, and you might have a long wait, but it's worth it.The best part of the restaurant has to be the free chips and salsa. THREE kinds of salsa, and they are on point. I could be satisfied with chips and salsa as a meal at this place. It was here that I tried my first mojito margarita. I turned my nose up at first, but it was great AND six bucks. They know what's up over there.The food is a little pricey, but it's all great. Their lunch menu has limited choices, so I would recommend going during dinner to get the full experience. They have seriously good food--not just the typical Midwestern Mexican fare that you find around here. I can't even give a recommendation for a \"best item on the menu,\" because I've like everything.And, finally, the service is great. Everyone is not only great at their jobs, but they're also super nice. They seem like genuine people, and it's nice to see people having some fun here and there instead of plowing through their job to get home."], ["Francesca Z.", "This is such a cute place but the food does not compare. It's overpriced and not even good... Too bad, such a cute mexican place in fountain sq :("], ["Jean D.", "Ate here last fall with my daughter in law and her mother. \u00a0It was very good. \u00a0I recommend it highly. I shared the Carnita's with my husband and it was quite tasty and filling. \u00a0Large portions, good prices. \u00a0Go there to enjoy some yummy mexican food at a good price."], ["Heidi H.", "I went here for the first time last week and it was delicious. As the name suggests, the margaritas are to die for - so sweet, which I love. The chips and salsa and queso are also really good. Not to mention, the servers are really friendly and accommodating. (This seems to be a happy trend in Fountain Square)."], ["Bart K.", "I recently ate lunch here and found it to be worth taking a side trip out of our way, which we did based on the reviews here. \u00a0The food was very tasty and well prepared, and the service was tremendous. \u00a0Drinks were refilled immediately and friendly prompt attention all around from the staff. The bathrooms were very clean. \u00a0And my favorite part, a place that serves mexican food which does not insist on having \"mexican\" music playing. \u00a0 We enjoyed listening to Sinatra and others instead of generic ambiance Mexican music. As it was lunchtime we did not try the margaritas. \u00a0We enjoyed the visit and will be back!"], ["Sonya A.", "The best tequila list in town. Thought the other two whiskey + tequila joints had it but boy was I wrong. The bartenders here really know their tequila and enjoy it which really shows. The drinks are good, the beer tappings they have done are unique but warning, the food is not good. I've gone a number of times thinking maybe I just picked the wrong items but really makes me sad to realize it really isn't good. A coctel de cameron with 5 sad little shrimp, queso fundido that is not warm and creamy but hard and stringy? Go here and head straight to the bar!!Drinks: 6/5Food: 3/5Service: 3/5 Location: 5/5 - Cool bar and awesome outdoor patio in the summer"], ["Ginger B.", "YUM! \u00a0I haven't had anything there that I haven't loved. \u00a0The drinks are good, and reasonably priced. It is small so wait times can be lengthy, but its better when the outdoor seating is available. The chips come with 3 types of salsas not just one, which is nice. Prices for food are a little higher than your \"typical\" Mexican restaurant, but its not typical."], ["J. A.", "Good food. Terrible service. I hoped the service issue was a one time thing, but appears to be consistent enough to prompt this review. Not enough wait staff and what they have are young and indifferent. I shouldn't have to consistently ask for dishes and drinks to be removed and to remind server for drink orders previously placed that were forgotten or delivered to the wrong table. Disorganized and slow bar service."], ["Shoshana K.", "Not authentic mexican food, but what do you expect in the Midwest?! \u00a0Its definitely dumbed down quite a bit and American-ized but I really enjoyed what I ate here and will come back, esp for the lunch - great prices and portions!!As mentioned previously, I was here for lunch on a weekday. \u00a0We were seated immediately. The food came out really hot and that was awesome. \u00a0I had the fish tacos and they were delicious. \u00a0The fist pieces were fried fresh and not sitting under a heat lamp - excellent. \u00a0The enchiladas next to me looked awesome. \u00a0The steak tacos by my other elbow looked good, but maybe not as exciting as some of the other things on the table. \u00a0The burrito across from me was HUGE! \u00a0Everyone's plate looked good enough to eat. \u00a0The service was consistent and prompt and I always felt taken care of.Most people have commented on how weird it is to enter this place. \u00a0Yes, its weird. \u00a0But it doesn't detract from the food. \u00a0I can't wait for my next visit to be when its beautiful weather outside to enjoy their patio."], ["Amanda M.", "New favorite mexican place! \u00a0The atmosphere here is very fun and relaxing and they have amazing outside seating being in the heart of fountain square.5 star review goes for the salad I had. Wow! Steak fajitas salad was the best salad I have ever had. The meat was seasoned to perfection and it was more than your average cheese, meat and lettuce salad you get from most Mexican places. The salad had peppers, mushrooms (at first I thought a little odd but it was a nice addition), a hint of lime and a few other odds and ends that gave the salad a nice balance of flavor that kept my taste buds wanting more.A few things that could have been better would be the margaritas although they were good they were a little salty for my taste however strong! My husband had 2 and was good the most of the night were normally he can have several as most places they are all sugar. And the guacamole was good I had some in my salad \u00a0such a yummy addition. Not as good as Bakersfield but a close second!If you are looking for a relax place to enjoy with friends this is your place!"], ["Patrick M.", "Though every time I've came here the servers and service have usually been great, the food has been pretty hit or miss. I've had a few different items on the menu and have never thought anything was super spectacular. For example I had the Coctel De Camaron recently and though it essentially tasted well the shrimp that were submerged in the sauce still had their tail shells on, thus making it a little difficult to eat. I personally would expect a little more for something that is almost nine dollars.They do have a decent selection of drinks, that change pretty frequently. With that being said though, almost every time I've been there, I've had to switch my drink order because they were out of something.If you are feeling adventurous, and want to try something new, like one of their more expensive cocktails for instance, be sure and ask about the flavors of the drink before you order if you are unfamiliar with the ingredients. In my experience, a lot of the drinks are more for people with an acquired taste. I personally have not acquired that taste, and felt ripped off that I just spent twelve dollars on something that tastes like leather, though I suppose they can't fully take the blame for that because I did order it out of sheer curiosity.In summary I wouldn't say it's necessarily a bad restaurant, I just feel there are better places to eat in Indianapolis that are more worth your money."]]}
