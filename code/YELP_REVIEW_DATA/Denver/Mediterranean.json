But if time's a factor then take-out is the way to go. Personally, I think the food here is worth the wait, and besides the staff is friendly.Of course the hummus with fresh-baked pitas are not to be missed. My other tops picks from their menu have to be the Cheese Pies, the Hummus with Beef Shawarma, and, for those who can't decide, the King Combo which has everything from tabouleh to shawarma.

This was a generous bowl and I couldn't even finish it.They have a handful of lunch specials and I went with the chicken shawarma.

I really don't like giving only one star, but I have to in this case. The service was friendly. The food wasn't very good. It was like fast-food Greek food. The portions were huge. The food was very greasy. It was just reheated to order. To be fair, our order included spanakopita and moussaka, which aren't normally made-to-order. I was glad, though, that the cooks didn't make our food then and there, because...one cook was PICKING HIS NOSE in the kitchen. Repeatedly. And that right there brings it down to one star."], ["Sophia C.", "I am a greek transplant from California and have been on a quest to find good greek food in Denver. Sadly, this is NOT it. It is so beyond americanized that you would not even recognize the food as greek (due to a serious lack of flavor and care) had it not been for the names. The meat was dry, the vegetables old, and there were very few if any seasonings used. I would not recommend this if you are looking for any semblance of quality, authentic greek food."], ["Christopher C.", "Great \u00a0Greek skillet, everything else is the same as all of Pete's places, but the skillet is a must have."], ["Dave T.", "Clean and nice.Great calamari!They have different seating environments, from diner style to nice tables.Many more things on the menu I would like to go back and try."], ["Alex W.", "I get the chicken kabob for lunch quite a bit, thus my duke-dom, *breathes on nails and polishes them on a ripped shirt*.

I don't care how they pay the bills as long as the delicious food keeps coming."], ["Kat A.", "My (very Greek) friend has been encouraging me to check this spot out for months. And, since a craving for gyros struck fast and hard yesterday at lunchtime, it was my destiny (or, as George McFly opined, it was my density) to visit this spot just up the street from my office.I went with a basic gyro and fries plate. The meat was spectacular and the pita was soft and delicious. The fries were outstanding, too - perfect traditional diner fries. I will say this - there were enough onions on my sandwich to feed a small onion-loving army. Holy hell was I fragrant for the remainder of the day. The service was fantastic and the guy behind the counter was especially friendly. We got right in and out. I'm excited to go back in the evening to try one of their dinner platters."], ["Linda T.", "This place is conveniently close by.They offer the best hummus and gyros! \u00a0Friendly staff, quick and efficient service."], ["K. R.", "My wife and I live one block away, so it's real easy to just walk there. The place is decent and the staff is pleasant too. The food is hit or miss, depending on what you order. Obviously, ordering Greek will get you a pleasant meal. Ordering a Philly cheese steak will be disappointing. Otherwise, the place is clean and nice."], ["Cherie C.", "I stopped in to order takeout. \u00a0As I sat at the counter in this diner-style restaurant, I noticed the smell of cigarettes. \u00a0First I thought maybe it just smelled from years of allowing smoking (and not changing paint?). \u00a0But it was too strong for that. \u00a0When I used the restroom and passed by the lounge, I saw folks in a smoking lounge of sorts. \u00a0Perhaps it's a glitch in their HVAC, but the smell is not contained to the smoking area. That would definitely keep me from returning here to eat in.I ordered two combo plates. \u00a0One had moussaka, pastitsio, and spanikopita. \u00a0By the time I got home, the spanikopita was no longer hot. But what was upsetting was that it had a rubbery texture, as though it had been reheated in a microwave for me. \u00a0It makes sense that spanikopita would not be baked to order, but heating it in a microwave for a to-go order is just silly. \u00a0I think that nuking any pastry is an abomination, so I didn't take a second bite.The Ambrosia combo included a Greek salad of sorts, a bit of pita, plus some meat. The chicken and pork was all tossed together in the same container. \u00a0The tzatziki and other sauces were very good--we saved the leftovers and used them with other meals later in the week.Everything was fine (save the spinach pie), but not mind-blowing. \u00a0The avgolomono soup was a standout, a lemony chicken soup that was comforting on a cold night. But at $40 for two takeout entrees, I doubt I'd return. I do like Greek food, but I couldn't help but think of what $40 in entrees could have gotten me at other area restaurants. And I don't mean quantity; we had Greek leftovers for brunch the next day. \u00a0It just fell far short of my expectations and was a bit too expensive for what we got. Plus, I'd already decided that takeout was my only option after experiencing the dining room, so it's definitely out of my takeout budget."], ["Mark T.", "The six-block stretch of East Colfax known informally as Greektown houses, perhaps unsurprisingly, a number of Hellenic restaurants and other amenities to help you get your Greek on. Of these, Pete's Greek Town Cafe is particularly noteworthy. Part of Mr. Contos's large food empire, PGTC takes the best elements of a specialty restaurant and a greasy-spoon diner to come up with quite an interesting eatery. On my last visit, I sampled the Greek Spaghetti. I have always loved this dish, with toothsome (what's the Greek word for \"al dente\" anyway?) noodles tossed with the firm, flavorful cheese called Mizithra, butter, and a little garlic. So simple, but so delicious, and PGTC does it right - by me anyway. I often find it tastes better by itself, without the sliced grilled chicken that can accompany it (for a small fee of course!) But yes, they also have Moussaka, Souvlaki, Pastitsio, Saganaki (OPAAAAA!!!), Dolmathes - is your tongue in a twist yet? - or many other native dishes for you to try. So be adventurous - you can have that burger somewhere else. To drink they have juice, tea, coffee (Greek or otherwise) and a number of other beverages. I always go for the blueberry/yogurt smoothie called the Santorini Shake, with colors evoking the Greek flag. Hey, you're still reading this? Go eat already!!!"], ["cindy b.", "I vote Pete' s Greek Town Cafe as the best place to sneak off early and have breakfast alone before work. \u00a0I love to sit at the counter, read the paper, and the food is great for breakfast. \u00a0It's also a surreal sort of place to meet a writer friend in those odd hours--sit in the big front room with the fascinating murals that you wish were somewhere in your house, just to look at when you don't want to think about anything. \u00a0If you are used to NYC Greek diners you will feel right at home here."], ["James B.", "Solid place that we enjoy. Often late at night.We generally always split a greek salad with the grilled pork on top which is always amazing. Service is always good and desserts are tasty.We generally are in the area after 9pm and they are open and friendly."], ["Jonny D.", "I really like this spot. The ambience is a bit IHOPy but the food is great for a decent price. The Taste of Greece appetizer is enough for a meal for two. It's awe-inspiring. I loved everything on it and there was so very much on it. We got it with souvlaki and I was ecstatic throughout it.The Greek Town Plate had a little of everything delicious for the lady, who could eat only about half of it. I got the beef tips over rice they had on special. I wasn't expecting much--what can you really expect from beef tips?--but they really did deliver some great food. This place is great, but it isn't anything special--it's just a solid, stand-up diner. It's the kind of place where you should be a regular if you live near it, but probably not a spot for special occasions."], ["Kathleen A.", "So, my girlfriends and I are all swankily dressed up and wanted to go out to eat at a reasonable place before seeing Wicked. Well, this place may not strike you as a before-show spot but it's in my hood and its cheap so it fit the bill.Let me say, three ladies dressed to the nines stuck out like a sore thumb here! But that's ok. You don't come here for the ambiance, that is for sure. It's a great place with decent food and no waits! \u00a0I decided on the egg-lemon soup and chicken kabob sandwich. \u00a0The soup is just what you need for a cold winters night to warm you up!! \u00a0I loved the sandwich, with the very flavorful chicken on a warm pita. \u00a0May I also suggest the hummus for an appetizer too!! However-I had leftovers, and I decided to leave those leftovers in my car while we were at the show. So when I came back at the end of the night, my car reeked of Greek food. It even reeked this morning still. So be warned...this stuff is potent. And I'm sure my roommates hate me for stinking up the fridge too."], ["Vanya L.", "I initially thought the prices were a bit high but the food is fresh and does not disappoint. I have to go off on a bit of a tangent here- but their house salad, a simple little salad, was AMAZING. It truly was the highlight of my meal. I wish I had ordered ten. It consisted of fresh lettuce, feta, a couple kalamata olives, beet!, cucumber, tomato, garbanzo beans, onion, and some zesty homemade vinaigrette. I liked the simple, delicious dressing so much, I actually hid my plate away on the other side of the table because I didn't want the waitress to take it away. I actually wanted to LICK the plate. I would have, be sure, had I been at home. My daughter, prior to this visit, has not liked salad OR olives, and after eating both of ours, she now loves both. NICE!I had only had lemon soup, Avgolemono, (it's one of their standard soups of the day) once before in Athens, Greece at Easter, and I remember thinking it was amazing.This soup was good. I thought in Greece it was actually tripe, not rice, but, whatever the case, I enjoyed this very lemony soup. I really did. So did my two year old. Not the same as the Plaka at Easter, but delectable either way.Our waitress seemed to be having a bad day but gave us top notch service nonetheless. She was on her game and we lacked for nothing. My friend had the gyros and it was superb. It was served with fresh lightly saut\u00e9ed onions (just perfect), pita, fresh vegetables, and absolutely to-die-for roasted potatoes. Are you kidding me? Those potatoes were pure potato perfection. It pained my friend to even let me try them. They really were that good. My daughter had the very fairly priced grilled cheese with fresh vegetables ($3.25) - you need to ask for non-french fry options, and was also given crayons and stuff to color. Overall, I was very impressed and delighted with my experience, Just a really good place to eat with fresh, delicious Greek food."], ["Aly M.", "honestly i really liked this place. i just wanted to go out and grab a quick bite to eat with my friend because i didnt feel like cooking dinner and i stumbled upon this restaurant. when we walked in the waitresses smiled as they greeted us and were very quick to seat us. My friend and I were served by a very nice blonde greek girl who was quite good at serving (she knew when to be quick and when to give us a few minutes). the food was awesome. the meat was seasoned just right and everything went extremely well together. even the owner was extremely homey. he made sure that my friend and i had a good experience. he almost reminded me of my grandfather with the way he carried himself in a sense. he was an extremely respectable man. the only complaint i have has to do with one of the line cooks though. right after my friend and i ordered, i found out that my friend had never had greek food so i wanted to have him try a traditional gyro. my waitress had already turned in the ticket(as she should have to get food out in a timely manor and did so faster than a lot of wait staff ive seen) and had to change my tables order. i had a problem with the cook barking at my waitress for my last minute change. he said something like \"figure out your orders before you turn them in.\" i would understand him getting mad at this if he had already called it and it was busy but i came in much later than the last rush. my guess is he might have had two to three small tickets if any at all. i also had just added on a dish which should have made it easy for him. it would have been my waitress who would have had the confusion when writing the check. i wanted to walk up to him and ask him to bring his complaint up to me because i had heard and seen him as he said it to her.over all, though, i will be recommending this place to whoever is looking for a good spot to eat. i liked everything about this spot and i will definitely be here again. this place had good food, a nice cozy feel and great service."], ["Heather O.", "Not an awesome experience. Upon arrival the staff was kind of a mess and kind of acted like they had never served humans before. I made a take-out order with the owner/manager (well, the guy in the button-up). When my order was ready, he and the waitress had a little quarrel about how to hand a receipt to a customer? Awkward for all involved.I ordered the Gyro platter. When I asked the guy if I could have something other than potatoes, he said no. Annoying. The meat seemed reheated, the vegetables were not fresh and over steamed. They didn't give me any pita bread (they saved me from myself, but I really was looking forward to it. So I was disappointed when it was missing form my order).

Preconceptions must have gotten the best of me, unfortunately. Even though Caf\u00e9 Byblos is a much better looking restaurant, and the foods may be more authentic, the taste is not what I'm used to. Take the hummus, it's very smooth, but just too \"lemony\" (didn't want to say \"sour\" to sound like it's gone bad, but...), same thing with the salads. If you happen to be super hungry like I was, bad news for you, all the acidity would make you even more starved, lol. Good thing our friends know how to order family style and we ended up having a lot of food. The grilled meats, I thought, were over-charred, especially the ground skewers, so dry that pieces were falling off the sticks and the only flavor profile I could discern was that of burnt. If that's the authentic flavor, then I'm perfectly happy to go back to the juicier, less acidic, \"Americanized\" way. It says a lot when the first thing in front of me that was finished were the French Fries with ketchup. My miss, I know.Just for comparison's sake, the Turkish coffee is excellent here and is brewed the Turkish way. A floral, strong shot of coffee lightly sweetened and served without cream. I'd come back for just the coffee and perhaps dessert as we didn't get to try any this time."], ["Anthony L.", "So the food portions we're small and honestly I have had better, the concern with devour is immense but the comfort if the \u00a0chairs was subpar.

I will say this - the spanakopita is highly disappointing. I LOVE spanakopita but this was literally the stuff you find in the appetizer section of the frozen aisle. The salad was a big portion and they did not skimp on the feta, thankfully. The meat platter, for $18, was a GREAT deal in portion alone. Unfortunately, everything (lamb/chicken) was a little overcooked, tough and dry. Maybe it's not always like that, who knows. I would give it another chance.

My fianc\u00e9 and I each ordered a gyro, one with fries, one with salad. The theme of our meal was wet. The salad was dripping with water, my gyro was cold and the pita broke apart because it was sopping wet. The gyro meat was tasty so I improvised and made a wet salad out of my wrap.

Yet another pass from me....."], ["Anna Z.", "For a place that is so delicious and definitely one of the best Mediterranean places in Denver, I am surprised every time when I come and I am one of the only customers there. Their obscure location is slowing down business because if they were situated anywhere else, their business would be rockin'. Nevertheless, my friends and I constantly come back and it's one of our go to restaurants. The restaurant has ample space and is very clean. There are many street parking nearby so it's never been an issue. They also have a lot as well. The waiters are very friendly and try to have conversations with us. I like how there are a variety of tables available from traditional tables to couch areas where you can eat in a relaxing manner.Not only is the food top notch quality mediterranean cuisine, they also give you a heaping portion (one plate lasts me two meals). My favorite is definitely the chicken kabob skewers which comes with a side of basmati rice which is so fragrant, and their special yogurt sauce as well as this delicious spicy sauce. I love pairing the different sauces with my meat and rice. It's an explosion of flavor and such a satisfying meal. Not to mention, they also serve you hummus and warm pita bread in addition to a house salad. It's so much food!! During another visit, i also tried the chicken shawarma which was very saucy and delicious and went so well with the rice. If you can eat more food, try some appetizers! I recommend the calamari or fried potato. Both are great appetizers especially if you have a group of people. I also tried the baklava which wasn't the best I've tried. The reason I am giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's always so empty and it lacks the exciting ambience of a restaurant. Otherwise the food is awesome and there is nothing to complain about there. This place deserves more customers so check it out!"], ["jomanah b.", "There was only one waiter serving the whole restaurant, which is not enough.

When we told the waitress to take it off she asked if we wanted something else and we told her no. She didn't apologize and said that it was not her fault.

The hummus is like butter (absolutely fabulous hummus!); the baba ghanouj had good texture; the dolmades (stuffed grape leaves) were mushy (I've had better); the filo pie was nothing special; and the tabbouleh was mostly parsley but solid.
