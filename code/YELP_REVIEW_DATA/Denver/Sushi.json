Our favorite is the smoked salmon, but we also love the yellowtail and white tuna. The sashimi is at just the right degree of coolness: not too frozen yet not close to room temperature (yikes!). Ginza also has some tasty special rolls, including the 007 roll.

The statues on the ceiling for very visually interesting, and actually complimented the atmosphere well. The huge televisions were a little tacky in my opinion but I understand they are most likely catering to a college-aged clientele. What seemed like was going to be a quick bite to eat fast food style quickly morphed into an impromptu date night. We were delighted to see such an extensive sushi list. I ordered a cosmo and my husband ordered a beer as we realized this was going to be a much better experience than we originally expected and his beer was much bigger than anticipated, which was a fun surprise!

We ordered several rolls, sashimi and miso soup along with some cocktails and hot sake. While I found the rolls and sashimi to be Good, there wasn't anything special about them. We ordered:-The Yellowtail Serrano Sashimi- yellowtail, cilantro, serrano, ponzu- I liked it but found the fish to be overpowered by the pool of ponzu, which really just tasted like soy. -The Eden Roll- A vegetarian roll with tempura sweet potato wrapped in brown rice. It was also good, but not special. I like brown rice (a lot) but it pretty much fell of the roll into the soy/wasabi. -The Snow White Roll- Our favorite! This roll had a really unique taste that I couldn't in-point, we could have ordered two of these!-Miso soup- Was good (again), not wonderful. I tried the \"Perfect Bloody Mary\" - it's a martini, I was unaware of that upon ordering. I didn't really like it.-The ambiance is pretty cool- There is cool pop-art everywhere, pretty modern.-Service- Seemed to be hot and cold, our waitress was't friendly and wasn't around enough to realize that we didn't have any wasabi or ginger.

They do have quite a few vegan sushi rolls, which is cool, as well as a Gluten-Free menu. Lots of serrano chili and spicy maki rolls. A bit more variety would be great. As I am writing this, I can't even recall the rolls we had, which must mean they weren't that memorable. One thing we did re-order was the cherry bomb, spicy tuna served nigiri style on top of crunchy rice. Get it without the spice crust unless you like your mouth on fire. I personally don't like anything overpowering delicate, buttery fish filet. Another thing I will say is that they make the best brown sushi rice here. Perfectly soft, fluffy and sticky. The BF hates brown rice maki rolls because the rice is usually grainy and won't hold together, but was thoroughly impressed by the texture of their brown rice. Do order the chocolate spring roll dessert, which was a great combo of warm Nutella inside a crispy batter, served with raspberry chocolate chip ice cream.

Out of the two, I would recommend the Crunchy LA. The Hawaiian did not stand out much, and I didn't even end up finishing it. The Crunchy LA was definitely the better out of the two, but still kind of forgettable. Booooo! I was pretty bummed after waiting so long to try this place.

The sushi is decent, but the happy hour menu seems to be heavy on the tempura/fried stuff as opposed to fresher stuff. There aren't as many raw selections as I'd like on happy hour. But if you like the more elaborate rolls, you may enjoy it more than I did. The big issue is even when it is completely dead in the middle of a Sunday afternoon, the service is exceptionally slow. On top of that, a handful of waitresses have been quite rude and make me feel like I am such a bother for wanting more wine when my glass has been empty for 30 minutes.

And the martial arts movies that play nonstop are a plus too haha"], ["Brad F.", "Fantastic quality sushi, really attentive service. The ambiance wasn't quite what I expected based on the pictures. It was much more \"busy\" feeling and while the bar was really cool-looking, we were seated in the very highly lighted dining room and it wasn't exactly the romantic/modern vibe I was expecting based on the pictures.Anyway, would recommend to anyone, but don't be fooled by the pictures."], ["John P.", "The food was terrific. Our waitress was very nice. The hostess was not, condescending and short(dark, curly haired girl). We hadn't been in before but will be back. Almost left because of the hostess."], ["Sean R.", "Excellent sushi! Some of the best that I've tried out here. The menu is different. The sushi is fresh. The rolls are creative and absolutely delicious! The Primo Fire roll is amazing! The waiter recommended the black tuna and it turned out to be awesome! Great food and great service. What else can you ask for? I highly recommend this spot if you're in the area and love good sushi."], ["Carolyn C.", "Went there last night for my don's 14 birthday. \u00a0With a decent sized party. I felt upon entering that the hostess was a little big for her britches and immediately wanted to lecture me on our party size and the seating RULES...eventhough I explained to her that three of us where early snd would like to just sit in the bar and wait. So no lecture needed, I was aware of the 75% rule and it was not a problem. The lady bartender was great and our waitress warmed up and eventually did a nice job!The rolls were average to just above average, upward lean. The price was a pleasent surprise for 10. I would recommend it but personally probably try another place if in that area again."], ["Gab S.", "The boyfriend and I are out-of-towners (visiting Denver for a week) and we just stumbled across this place while we were exploring. \u00a0We were not disappointed.The spicy edamame was great and we loved the Cherry Bomb and Itchy Salmon from the happy hour menu. \u00a0The only critique we had was that the saki sangria was really messy to pour. We had a good portion of it on out table at the end of our meal! If we find ourselves in Denver again, we will surely come back."], ["John L.", "This place has a very nice look, and by the bar, this is a good place for sake or other drinks, but not if you fancy really good sushi.Pros: A nice relaxing atmosphere for dinner or drinks; The tea cup and pot were very authentic, and the bartender was friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu; answered all my questions. \u00a0I also like the old samurai flicks playing above the bar.Cons: After my miso soup arrived, it took over 30 minutes to get my sushi, and it was not a busy night (two tables in the whole restaurant). The nigiri cuts were very slim, and the specialty roll was the size of a $6 cut roll at most restaurants. \u00a0Finally, they served a fork with my chopsticks ('nuff said). If you're looking for quality sushi in Denver, I would try Sushi Den, or one of the Hapa locations."], ["Mona K.", "Ended up here at the perfect time for happy hour. Waitress was great and asked us towards the end of our meal if we wanted to order more before happy hour ended. Ordered the yellowtail scallion roll, spicy salmon, and a tuna roll. Great portions for the price and very cute atmosphere."], ["Natalia K.", "I've been coming here regularly since this place opened, so it's time to update my review:THIS IS STILL MY FAVORITE SUSHI PLACE IN DENVERAND STILL MY FAVORITE HAPPY HOUR PLACE DOWNTOWN\"But what about [this well-known sushi place] or [that great sushi chef],\" you might say. As far as I'm concerned, every other sushi place puts me to sleep in comparison to Blue Sushi. Blue has way more creative/delicious options, a much more fun atmosphere, and the best freakin happy hour downtown (and not just compared to other sushi places).So down to the details:HAPPY HOUR:Mon-Sat: 3-6:30pmFri/Sat: 10:30pm-midnightSunday: 12pm-8pmIncludes $3 margaritas, $3 sake bombs, $4.50 rolls, appetizers starting at $3, and a bunch of other stuff. I recommend:+ House lime margaritas - because $3!+ Blue balls (tempura-fried spicy crab balls) - $4+ Ceviche (white fish and shrimp, avocado, and all the other amazing goodness) - $6+ Mussels (in a yellow curry unlike anywhere else) - $7.50Most people would stop reading here and be sold.MUST-TRYS:+ Itchy Seabass. I usually never order seabass, but this was one of the best, most decadent things I've ever tasted. Trust me when I say you HAVE to try it.+ Black Tuna sashimi. I have never had anything like it, and I bet you haven't either.+ Hattori Hanzo saketini. Probably the most refreshing, delicious cocktail ever.ATMOSPHERE:This place did an amazing job of creating a modern, trendy Japanese-American feel. The \"sake bombers' lounge\" really does have a lounge-like feel to it (think cool lighting, modern decor, and ceiling art with an old-school pinup model on it). Basically, a great place for a fun lunch, happy hour, or dinner date. It would fit right in anywhere in New York or Los Angeles.DRINKS:Great selection of sake, with some delicious affordable options. Like I said, I highly recommend the Hattori Hanzo saketini. Or the $3 happy hour margaritas are always a winner.FOOD:Don't be fooled by how trendy and fun this place looks. It has some of the best, most authentic sushi around, with fresh fish flown in every day. (And great tenderloin, too.) I don't think there's a single thing on their menu that isn't delicious, but here are my favorites:+ Itchy Seabass (the most amazing baked seabass on spicy crab)+ Black Tuna sashimi (tender walu marinated in a secret black sauce)+ Ahi tuna tacos (sweet and spicy, tender, heavy on the tuna, delicious)+ Ceviche-style white fish sashimi platter (different from any sashimi platter you'll have, probably because of the delicious lime juice)+ Ceviche (amazing white fish and shrimp ceviche, with delicious wonton crisps)+ River rock beef tenderloin (pieces of tender beef on hot rocks in a jalapeno ponzu)LUNCH SPECIALS:two maki (rolls) - $12one maki & nigiri - $13one maki & sashimi - $15Also, I have to say, they did an amazing job with their website and social media. It's not something you see with too many restaurants, especially sushi ones."], ["Jeremy E.", "I dined at Blue Sushi Sake on Saturday for an early dinner with two friends. \u00a0Cayla was our server -- she had a great sense of humor and was very helpful during the meal. \u00a0Thankfully (from other reviews) there were no bachelorette parties going on or I would have walked out the door. \u00a0Yikes.The restaurant has good ambiance, the sushi rolls were delicious. \u00a0I will definitely return."], ["Vilma S.", "Another great dining experience at Blue Sushi Sake Grill! Were greeted and seated right away by a table next to the window and it felt good with the heater on. Nathan was our server and was very friendly, gave great recommendations and efficient.We used the Yelp App to get a free spicy edamame to begin our dining adventure. Then had the freakingly delicious Steamed Sapporo Mussels, Crab Rangoons, a variety of sushi and Sapporo beer for $2-along with some great hot sake. Everything was well presented, well prepared and just awesomely yummy!! :-)Jonathan, the Manager, came by our table and he is just so nice. The place was so vibrant and you could tell everyone was enjoying their meals!Parked at the 1900 16th Street Garage for $3--yes, just $3! Only two blocks away and then walked to Lannie's Clocktower Cabaret for a show.Just a great evening all around!! :-)"], ["Tiffany N.", "Fabulous spot for happy hour but I wouldn't come here and pay regular price. The first time we went was on a Saturday afternoon for happy hour (they have an afternoon happy hour and a later evening one) and wasn't too impressed. Remarkable prices but lackluster service. So we came back one more time and it was a lot better! Happy hour is served everywhere and after some edamame (free when you check in on Yelp!) and two rolls ($4.50 a pop) we were good to go for awhile. We sat on the patio which is nice but also sketch since it is on 16th Street Mall. At least you some entertainment while noshing on discounted food. I will definitely come back for some more happy hour loving!"], ["Jordan T.", "The lunch specials are great! Two maki and a soup or salad for $12! The maki selection for this is also broad. The quality of fish and rice here is outstanding. The shishito peppers are a great started, too.Great place for business lunches, or lunch w/ friends. Come out for dinner (even late night) and have a few sake bombs!"], ["Kristine N.", "Free spicy edamame with a yelp check in.We ordered three rolls and they were all just ok. The crunchy blue needed more crunch to live up to the name. The crunchy red had zero crunch. Per the waitresses suggestion, we ordered the thriller which sounded amazing but lacked in delivery. Everything was flavorful and fresh but nothing memorable.Beautiful restaurant with super nice servers. Great location."], ["Lauren B.", "Overall the sushi is good, it's a good location and the happy hour is cheap. BUT, please don't eat here if you need their gluten free menu to actually be gluten free. I've come before and ordered my usual. But after eating a few pieces of sushi, I noticed there were large breadcrumbs sprinkled throughout my sushi rolls. I sent it all back, the manager had a talk with the staff, and the remade rolls, you guessed it, still visibly had some breadcrumbs throughout. To his credit, when pressed the manager covered our meal so we could just leave, but at the end of the day, they can't actually provide gluten free meals, and 2 days later I am still sick. If you have celiac or are sensitive to gluten, save yourself the pain and don't take your chances here."], ["Daniela B.", "Ok place for a drink but the food is not worth it. We had 3 dishes to share, the ahi tuna tacos, scallops and one of the specialty sushi rolls with spicy tuna and spicy salmonThe tacos were very salty, but other than that tasted ok. They were deep fried corn tortilla with squares of ahi tuna seared and avocadoThe scallops were awful. Chewy and cooked inside baking shells with cheese or flour sauce that covered all their taste. We had one shell each and we couldn't even be bothered with the 3rd oneThen the sushi roll...from their specialty menu was supposed to have spicy salmon and spicy tuna and cucumber and red pepper ....they were wide rolls of rice with cucumber and red pepper and non existence fish. \u00a0A pea size mix of spicy mayo and fish pieces was all we could find in each piece. So for $12 it was a nice serving of rice and soy sauce"], ["Matt H.", "Came here after wanting sushi and seeing this place on a flier. Let me begin with we got a free order of edamame for using Yelp, we chose spicy style, and it was fantastic. Then, it was also happy hour and, this place has the happy hour to beat, hands down.I got the Crunchy Red roll and the Ceviche. I'm not usually a fan of Ceviche, but this sounded amazing and tasted 10 times better. I don't know if I could come to this restaurant again and not get it, not to mention that since it was happy hour it was 6 DOLLARS. Not only a great dish, but an even better price.My friends also got the Cabo roll, the Seattle roll, the Vegetable Tempura, the Unagi roll, Shishito Peppers, Zuke Maguro and the Blue Balls. All AWESOME. The staff was amazing, never wrote anything down but got every order correct, and got it out to us fast enough that we almost couldn't order more fast enough.If you're anywhere near LoDo, you need to come to this restaurant. Especially if you love sushi."], ["Sydney S.", "just had to walk out because 3 tables were given their drinks before we even had any server come to help us. we were starving and thirsty and it was really frustrating to see everyone helped before us. nobody even noticed we left!"], ["Scott K.", "Great food, good service. A little loud on a Saturday night, but that's to be expected. Next time I'll get an outdoor table.

It should not take long to receive a check, especially where it's not busy."], ["Teema C.", "This place was amazing! Hubby and I sat down at the sushi bar, and the waiter brought over two glasses of water - one with ice and one without. One of the wait staff overheard my husband and I talking about what we wanted to drink and heard that my husband preferred water without ice - so it was brought how we like it without us asking - that really impressed us! We told our waiter that it was out first time at Blue Sushi and he took time to explain the menu and his favorite items - I really love when waiters do that! Then, the food - we ordered mainly from the sushi menu although we did take advantage of the free spicy edamame from the Yelp check-in too! We had the cherry bomb nigiri, rainbow roll, and the blue volcano - all of it was super fresh and super delicious! To top it off, we had the most amazing dessert - chocolate spring rolls - I would go back just for that! The restaurant itself is really cool and has a great ambiance too. Loved this place and will surely be back!"], ["Kenneth B.", "Four and a half....The food was inevitably dearly felt and created with an independant intuism. The quality is as good as it gets...

I've been in with my wife at least a dozen times (had two of their \"frequent eater\" cards filled for free meals) and brought some friends who are now regulars as well. I really love the \"swai\" fish which hasn't been mentioned in other reviews. It is a nice flaky white fish grilled to perfection.The only thing I would like to find is the nutritional (calorie) information in each of their meals. I am counting calories and where many restaurants post their nutritional information on a website, I can't find anything for my new favorite restaurant.Or maybe the food is so good, I really don't want to find out!"], ["L B.", "Dare I say a BETTER version of Benihana and without the wait and tiny portions.

I tried numerous places looking for something similar in Denver and they never could hold up. Finally a South Carolina chain migrated out west. This place is fantastic! The staff is insanely friendly and eager to please. The chicken, steak, and shrimp hibachi entrees are all lovely and paired with white sauce you truly can't go wrong. They also deliver to our office on the north edge of the tech center. Delivery is free and relatively fast. We eat here a ton now! Strongly recommend it!"], ["Gil A.", "What a pleasant surprise! It's a bit hidden away at the east-facing side of Tiffany Square strip mall on Hampden off I-25, but it's worth checking out. Miyabi Jr. is a chain started in the South as a fast-casual spinoff of a traditional Japanese steakhouse (Benihana style teppan-yaki grills, ironically just across the street from oe of the last remaining local Benihanas) but with a smart efficient spin: The teppan-yaki grill is in the kitchen behind the counter, and one chef manages the cooking for the room. The food is the same mix of steak, shrimp, chicken, seafood (and yakisoba that I'll have to try next visit) \u00a0served with the same large plate that includes grilled onions and zucchini, and a generous mound of fried rice. The food is tasty and the service is terrific for the small staff. Owner Junya Nakajima is a hard-working young man with a vision. Customer service is a big priority, and the quality of food is top notch. I recommend this place highly -- Junya says many of the items on the menu can be cooked up gluten-free. \u00a0Watch for other locations in the future. This location is worth the drive for us."], ["Laura C.", "We tried to go here three different times. \u00a0The first time, they had no sushi available. \u00a0The second time, they advertised delivery but would not deliver when we called. \u00a0Finally, I went to pick it up the third time, and we were not impressed with the food. \u00a0I had chicken in my bowl, and it seemed like lots of fat and low quality meat. \u00a0Sushi was not any better than what you would get at the grocery store. \u00a0I'll stick with Tokyo Joe's."], ["Cathy B.", "Awesome quick casual. I love the hibachi chicken with veggies only! The fish is great too. Friendly service"], ["Brandon D.", "Just what this neighborhood needed in an already saturated market full of fast Mediterranean and Mexican food (not that I don't like the cuisine, it's just nice to have some variety). Don't confuse this place with the Americanized Tokyo Joes, granted Miyabi is not a pure and accurate representation of Japanese cuisine, it does stay true to the subtle and light flavors. The restaruant itself is nicely decorated with the exception of the flower pot in the door way and the sauce bar. The staff are friendly, the meat quality is what you'd expect from a \"hibachi\" grill and my overall experience has been positive. The sauces are good especially the mayo one.

Just like a sit down Japanese steakhouse. Steak n chicken combo so good even to go. Worth a try and another."], ["Emily W.", "Really excellent teriyaki bowls. Pretty fast service. Only negative is the $30 minimum for delivery, but they were nice enough to wave that for my first delivery order since the minimum isn't advertised."], ["Tom N.", "Quick and tasty hibachi dishes are this place's forte. From the time it takes to order and get to you is about 5 minutes on average. The food is best hot off the grill and eaten right there, but it's still pretty good heated up if you have to take it to go. I usually go for the steak and shrimp or the steak and teriyaki chicken combo. They have these three dipping sauces, a ginger based sauce, a mustard one, and this odd mayo based one. The first two remind me of the ones you can get at a restaurant style hibachi grill, the last one really isn't my favorite... It kind of reminds me of the \"special sauce\" you can get on some fast food burgers; that odd combination of mayo and maybe ketchup or something... The sushi is kinda subpar, so I'd probably avoid that. I've had the fried cheesecake which was a bad idea. It likes a block of cream cheese that was deepfried. The Calpico drinks on display by the register, I absolutely love and highly recommend. I believe there's a discount for L.E., Fire, and EMS workers which is pretty awesome. I could eat here a few times a week to fix that craving for hibachi style Japanese food. The decor isn't anything fancy. It doesn't really have any personality, which is both good and bad I guess. The general staff is pretty friendly, if a little timid. I'd bet this is their first time working in the hospitality industry. The managers and chef are great though. I definitely recommend this place if you need a quick fix for hibachi food, but don't want to sit around and wait for a table to fill up."], ["Ronald P.", "My wife and I enjoyed dinner here tonight after seeing a movie at the Elvis Tiffany theatre.

As an out of towner I rely on Yelp to find the good spots, and Sushi Den is one of those that lives up to the hype. Let's start with the service. The waiter was great and was constantly attentive to our emptying glasses and had great suggestions for any and everything on the menu. The food!! The food was nothing short of phenomenal. Starting with a cup of miso soup which wasn't your typical salty soup. It was real miso broth with mushroom and vegetables and fresh tofu. Also, the lobster tempura was perfectly cooked and flaky and the dipping sauce was a perfect match. We also had a few pieces of toro which was the best toro I've had hands down. This place selects their sourced fish from the best locations and flies it in daily. We finished up with he Kobe beef, not the fake American kind, true Kobe and the red dragon roll. All well balanced and perfectly prepared. I can't wait to go back and try this place! Go to Sushi Den!"], ["Pez E.", "My husband and I stop in every time we're in Denver and often take impromptu road trips just to eat at Sushi Den, since we can't get sushi of this quality in NM. The fish is flown in daily from Japan, which really makes this spot the best!I love the miso ramen- perfectly cooked noodles, exquisite flavoring, and beautifully presented. My husband loves the decadent lobster roll, we both enjoy the poki roll, and usually go for one of the specials.

There's always a wait and they don't take reservations for parties smaller than 5."], ["Inayah V.", "I'm going to start with the bad here, and that is the liberal use of syrup without warning. I read nothing on the menu that would indicate the appetizer would come swimming in a puddle of sickeningly sweet noxious glaze with the consistency of motor oil. Perhaps the fact the spicy tuna appetizer is described as a favorite was supposed to clue me in. Could it be that this highly acclaimed restaurant that imports fish almost daily is pandering to the uneducated palates of an American clientele? If that's the case, do us all a favor and throw that filth down the drain! I've heard Anthony Bourdain talk about the pain on the face of a sushi chef watching a customer apply soy sauce to his carefully and skillfully crafted food. How then can a place like this adulterate their quality cuisine in good conscience?Now on to the good. The food and cocktails really are excellent. The south Pearl location is fantastic, and the decor is warm and very complimentary. I especially recommend the Blood Orange Horizon and the Negitoro (fatty tuna) roll. Do yourself a favor and tell your server no eel sauce as soon as you sit down."], ["Chisholm T.", "Two words: CRISPY TUNA!!! This is a house favorite at Sushi Den and honestly, one of the best things I ever ate! It was basically spicy tuna on top of crispy sushi rice, with a glazed sauce (possibly teriyaki?), sliced avocado, jalapenos, and roe. Sooo amazing!!!My friend and I started with that, and a couple glasses of white wine. We were feeling adventurous so we asked our server, El to take the steering wheel for us and asked her to pick our dishes without telling us what we'd be eating until it arrived at the table! I mean, why not?! She knows more about the menu than we did and knows what's good there, so we gave her our budget, I told her I didn't like salmon, my friend told her she didn't like spicy food, and El went above and beyond to give us the most delicious dinner!I wish I could remember the name of the dishes she brought out for us, but I think most of them were from the specials menu. She gave us some of the BEST tuna nigiri I've ever had! They were all different cuts of tuna that ranged from light to dark and all I can say is WOW. She also brought us a vegetarian roll which was insanely flavorful. There was also a tuna sushi roll that we had which was on the specials menu. It literally melted in my mouth. And then she brought us each a hand roll which was so fun! Felt like we were eating little sushi burritos. She brought me a spicy tuna hand roll and a a kobe beef hand roll for my friend and that was such a fun and delicious treat! We ended with the banana cream pie dessert which balanced our entire dinner.Such a memorable and fun experience! Thank you El for taking such great care of us!

The volcano roll comes piled with seafood drenched in mouthwatering sauce and is filling without being too heavy. We had the spicy tuna first as well as a few other a-la-carte sushi rolls. I thought those were pretty good but didn't compare to the volcano roll. Come to think of it, the only thing I remember about dinner was the volcano roll...There was a wait for the table, but sitting at the bar was just as nice.

We tried the copper river salmon nigiri, from Alaska, which I had tried a month or so back at their little brother restaurant, Izakaya Den. It was well worth the $5 a piece. So buttery, melty and delicate. I highly recommend this. The rolls were rolled and presented perfectly with unique combinations of flavors. My only complaint: we walked out of there with a $130 bill with tip. Ouch. Totally worth it if you are ready to splurge!"], ["Betsie S.", "Solid sushi with great service and a lively and fun atmosphere. I really enjoyed my dinner with my family here, but in order to get 5 stars an experience has to be spotless. All my family enjoyed their entrees. We started with an excellent, piping hot miso soup and complementary hot green tea. \u00a0My mom could not have enough of her teriyaki chicken with potatoes. My veggie-loving sister had the veggie sushi dinner and all the rolls were good, especially the smokey, grilled eggplant sushi. My dad and I shared the firecracker roll, kobe beef roll and asparagus roll. All the rolls were good, but definitely not amazing except the kobe beef roll which gets 5 stars. The least successful dish, although highly reviewed, was the seaweed salad. This dish really fell short for me-- the flavor and texture was one note and the chewy purple and green, slightly translucent seaweed bits reminded me of the stuff that washes up on beach shores. There wasn't enough cucumber to add crunch to this one-note dish. The words that come to mind when I think of this dish are chewy and Spongebob Squarepants.The highlight of our dinner was the fruity mochi ice cream. I would go again and just skip the seaweed salad. I enjoyed everything I ate here and really loved the kobe beef roll. I usually don't go into detail about dishes I don't like, but the seaweed salad was really unpleasant for me. The service and atmosphere were spot on and great for a date or a night out with friends.Also, they don't take reservations for parties small than 5 people and do not have happy hour on Sundays."], ["Blair C.", "Honestly I was quite upset with my visit to this fine establishment! I hosted my birthday dinner here with my friends and we had quite a large party. I was very happy they were accommodating with my guest list changing though. The reason for choosing this restaurant were the recommendations from my friends and of course reading the many raving yelp reviews. It took about 15 minutes or so to get seated from our reservation time. Another downside, they do not take reservations from 6-9 pm on Friday and Saturday. I do not understand why they wouldn't because this is a very busy restaurant. Apparently, its always on average over an hour wait. Once seated, we were only provided with ONE waiter for a party of almost 20 people. It took our waiter almost 45 minutes to get our order of drinks and sushi. The main reason why I didn't dock any more points for this restaurant was because of their sushi. My fianc\u00e9e and I shared the Kobe beef roll and big roll. I loved both rolls but be forewarned if you don't like hot spice, they add a dash of wasabi into all of their rolls, so there is a bit of a kick. I liked the sauce (siracha/mayonnaise/shoyu/seasame seeds) that came alongside of the big roll. The big roll came with no rice but it also came with a little side salad. Because it was my birthday, they gave me a scoop of green tea ice cream on the house. Lastly, when we were ready for our checks, it took longer than it should normally take. We asked for separate checks and provided our waiter with the sushi sheets as who ordered what. However, this still confused him. We were the last ones out of the restaurant after 30 minutes of closing because it took our waiter FOREVER to close us out. If I do come back not saying that I will, it will not be with a big party as they are not efficient in taking care of a bigger party."], ["Adrian J.", "Sushi Den has to be one of the best sushi restaurants in Denver. Walked in on a Sunday night and the restaurant was packed. Fortunately we were able to get a seat at the sushi bar.What followed was a flurry of sushi rolls and nigiri. All great quality. Clearly the fish is very fresh. We stuck mostly to the sushi den speciality rolls and enjoyed spicy tuna, volcano and sea food rolls.If you stick to sushi rolls it's not expensive (by sushi standards). For two people we ate well for 75 dollars in total (included a Japanese beer each). The average sushi roll (8 pieces) is priced at about 15 dollars.Overall very happy with experience."], ["Jerad L.", "Best sushi in Denver! Worth the wait. \u00a0I love this place, and keep coming back. \u00a0This is a great place to take a date. Regardless of whether or not you like fish, you will like Sushi Den. \u00a0Sushi Den is within a genre of its own, where almost all the dishes are unique and fantastic. I asked my server, Beau, for recommendations & he did not disappoint.

Also my first time having it with fruit - it was interesting but left me wanting the traditional wakame salad_________________Now to the Good:Volcano roll: SO DELICIOUS. I wish we had just ordered 5 orders of this one thing. I can't even really comprehend all of the stuff piled on top but it was amazing and I want more of it. Whatever that sauce was needs to just be on everything.Pineapple Upside Down Cake: It was moist without being soggy. Pineapple-y without being too citrusy or sweet. It was everything I love in a dessert. ________________The Mehs:Kobe beef roll: gasp - I know, it's blasphemous to hate on something so beloved here but at the end of the day, its beef wrapped in rice so it just tastes like...beef and rice. Could be in a roll, could be in a bowl...nothing special to write home about (although I'm writing it in a yelp review so maybe that's ironic?)________________Takeaways: Since I got the volcano roll first and finished with the pineapple upside cake, the meal was bookended by great items. Everything in between was decent but just not mindblowingly awesome to distinguish it against any other sushi place out there. I would still come back but it would solely be for that volcano roll."], ["Sarah S.", "Sushi Den has been around for so long. It is intimate, it is a perfect business setting, it is a great place for friends to dine. The hohati (so) scallops are amazing, along with all of the rest of the menu."], ["Joe B.", "I've eaten at a lot of sushi joints in my life and Sushi Den has to be atop any list. From the miso soup, tempura lobster to the cuts of sushi it truly gets no better. The places fills up quick for happy hour so don't be surprised if you have to wait for a table. I come back here every few months just so I can taste the greatness. Today, my mom got the miso ramen and it was delicious. Along with our other orders of sushi, nigiri, and lobster it was a killer meal.It wasn't cheap but like I told my mom I rather pay more for good sushi then pay later for bad sushi."], ["Anna N.", "This is my favorite sushi spot in the country! When I lived in San Francisco, I made a point to visit sushi den whenever in Colorado. The fish is fresh, flown in from Japan daily, and impeccably presented. My must-try recommendations- jalape\u00f1o sashimi, tuna firecracker roll and the Kobe beef roll. Whatever your pleasure as far as sushi, you will love- we always mix that part up depending on the fresh fish on the menu. Normally, I am too full for desert but during our last visit, I tried the banana cream pie which was phenomenal. Don't miss it!!The ambiance is great and although the place can be a bit sceney, it does not impact the service which is always outstanding. #ilovesushiden"], ["Ted S.", "My girlfriend and I were craving sushi and we're definitely in need of a date night. We decided to head to sushi den since we've heard so many good reviews but hadn't enjoyed it ourselves. Until now. The atmosphere is noticeably intimate the moment you walk through the doors. The restaurant itself is very big. There is a TON of seating. For dinner we had to wait 20 minutes but there is bar seating (if you can find a seat) available to rest your legs. Once your table is ready the fun begins. We started with some green tea and beef carpaccio. Our server was very good at having nice small talk to maximize our dining experience. The main course, tuna firecracker roll, beef Wagyu roll, and the black miso cod, was delicious. Hands down the black miso cod is a must. I was so flavorful and every bite leaves you wanting another. For desert we ordered the pineapple upside down cake. For myself not being the biggest dessert guy I was able to eat this consistently and almost (almost) keep up with my girlfriend, lol. Definitely come whether you're in a group or just a date. It's a great place to be!"], ["Kristen M.", "Great food, servers, and atmosphere. \u00a0I love coming to this restaurant and always have a great experience."], ["Claudine M.", "I've been dying to go to this place and it was such a delight to finally have a date here! The restaurant has low lighting besides the sushi counters where you can see the masters at work. It could've seemed intimate, but the place was busy so the chatter of the people made it a bit more lively. For a weekday, this place still gets packed so I suggest you make reservations or go their earlier. We just had to wait 20mins which isn't that bad. There's a bar and a side bar inside that you can drink while waiting for your seat. When we were finally seated, our server Jeff was very nice and gave us some suggestions and answered some of our questions. Really good in refilling our water and tea, and asked us every now and then if we liked our meal. For the food we got the beef carpaccio, miso black cod, tuna firecracker roll and the Kobe beef roll. Everything was delicious! My boyfriend was a bit skeptical eating raw beef but he actually liked it. The sushi rolls were great, but we enjoyed the black cod the most. It was cooked perfectly and the miso sauce was a perfect combo to it. We even had enough space for a dessert, which is my favorite part of the meal! We got the pineapple upside down cake with lychee ice cream. I loved the ice cream ice cream! Yummmm! I can't wait to back here and try everything else!"], ["Tanner P.", "-On a Sunday night, the wait was just under an hour long. -The ambiance is beautiful. Great lighting, cool / modern / hip feel to the place. -The service was excellent and the servers were present and attentive without being in our faces. They folded our cloth napkins when any of us left to use the restroomThe food was in the \"just ok\" category. EVERYONE I know raves about this place but I honestly did not understand the raving reviews because the sushi was average. In fact, the app I had, which was served hot in a dish with calamari, shrimp, etc. tasted like mayonnaise right out of a jar. Overall, I felt it was a lot of hype and the food quality, while carrying a traditionally reliable appearance was pretty \"meh\" and not very impressive. It just wasn't impressive. There is better, more quality sushi in Denver.... Sorry guys.... I said it."], ["Olivier L.", "I had very good Nigiris at Sushi den but I can only remember the lobster tempura. They served me a full lobster tail tempura style. It was very tasty, sweet and tender. I recall only paying $15 for it. Atmosphere is great too, the restaurant was filled with a cool crowd on a Wednesday night."], ["Joshua S.", "Service was amazing, given how busy it was, and near the end of the lunch shift. The fish itself was probably the best fish I have eaten in Colorado. The fact that they buy their fish every morning is inducing in itself.The new style and ginger sashimi are plates with immense flavors: mixed oils and mushroom mixes that bring out the deep impressions of the fish.

I can attest that this is GREAT sushi. Its fresh and light and cut to the perfect thickness. The wasabi was probably the best I'd ever had. I will definitely dine here again. I also took a coworker who'd never had sushi and always been afraid of it with me and he couldn't stop talking about what a great experience it was. He thoroughly enjoyed it. As did I!"], ["Veronica S.", "Our friends told us about this hot spot and they were right! It's located in a cute quaint neighborhood. It is easy to miss if this place wasn't busy, sign is way too small and hard to read. Wait time was a lite long, but worth it. Space inside is decent but can get crammed for sure. It is extremely loud, so if you're looking for a quite setting, this isn't it. I came during dinner time, so traffic flow was heavy. I honestly can't Rene bet all of what I ordered but the red dragon roll was insanely delicious!! That's the one roll that was perfect! Waitress was awesome, Elle was her name I believe. Service was perfect!! Have to try this place if you haven't!!"], ["Dan D.", "This place is amazing. We were here a decade ago, and when we finally got back to the Denver area - we had to go again. We were not disappointed.We almost didn't go here, because the prices are quite high, and given our expectations of the meal, we knew we'd spend a lot (well over $100 for two)Every item was superb - well prepared, tasty, and nicely presented. Our server, Robin, was attentive, and made recommendations based on what we said we enjoyed. We've been to Japan for sushi and sashimi, and Sushi Den compares well to some of Japan's nicer sushi restaurants.Things to watch out for to insure a good experience - trying to park here is almost impossible - even the line to get valet parking clogs up the narrow street. So be aware that you should park a bit away and walk, or just be patient. We came early when the restaurant opened to avoid this issue.If you come on any popular night or time, be prepared for quite a crowd, and the service won't be as good. Again, we came as they opened and that helped a lot, and even then it filled up almost immediately.Realize the food here is fresh, and esoteric for many. We love that, and it makes us spend a lot of money! Being frugal, we prepped ourselves for a big bill, and just enjoyed the food.Important note if you follow my advice and come early: Sushi Den opens promptly at 4:45pm on weekdays, NOT 4:30 as currently indicated by Yelp.

Every bite was everything I had hoped for and missed about sushi. The rice was delicately seasoned, sticky, and light. The fish was fresh and flavorful - each variety distinct in taste and texture, cut perfectly by our chef. The unfiltered sake was sweet and refreshing, a welcome palate cleanser between bites. Perfection.At the end of our meal, I had a chance to talk to our chef about where my family was from in Japan, which led to the discovery that not only was my chef from the same city as my grandmother's family, but he was also one of the Kizaki brothers.

We rolled in at 6:00 on a Saturday, passed the time at the bar with some sake and Sapporo, seated not long after. Spicy edamame, toro nigiri, spider, and rainbow to split. Spicy edamame perfect app to whet the appetite. Unfortunately, the sushi was lackluster. The toro not firm enough and the slice disproportionately larger than the rice. I'm probably the only person to complain about generosity but I prefer my food/sushi to be in perfect ratio. Perhaps we ordered incorrectly with the spider and rainbow rolls, sauces overwhelmed any of the fresh fish delicacy, the two rolls interchangeable with any other local sushi spot's. Probably should have went with a sashimi platter, fish unadorned and undressed by any gimmicky additions. I wasn't a fan of the ambiance either.

I would definitely recommend Izu to anyone looking for great sushi that's also inexpensive."], ["Nick P.", "Izu is a fantastic spot. From the moment you step of Colfax the place just screams execution. It's tastefully decorated, but in that all too familiar sushi bar look. It has the same polished black countertops, and slightly uncomfortable chairs as every other sushi place. The booths up front are a nice comfortable change at least.The service is fantastic. It can take a second before a hostess will demurely offer you a table, but from then on things go really well. The wait staff is friendly, the sushi chefs are the right amount of chatty, and overall it's a pleasant place to be.They have cocktails, wine, and the usual rice beers. None of the offerings are particularly special or interesting.The sushi, however, is where this place shines. The rolls are creative and well executed. The fusion roll is one of the best rolls I've had in Denver. Perfectly spicy, with a pleasant texture, and a nice creamy citrusy sauce on top. It's just an excellent roll.Everything else we've tried in our 4 visits has all ranged from pretty good to great. The nigiri is fresh and the sashimi is perfectly cut. This place wants to do well, and it deserves to be rewarded for it.This is a great addition to Colfax.. better than Okinawa down the street (which I also actually really like)."], ["Toan D.", "Ate here for lunch today and I was very happy.

My friend recommended this place to me a year ago because I told him I missed our all-you-can-eat spot from our home in Las Vegas. Sushi Bay only has all you can eat on Sundays but my friend and I plan to go at least once a month.The sushi always comes out fast. And for $29 all-you-can-eat, you really get a lot of food. I love that I can order the green mussels as part of my appetizer. Their mussels are delicious. I also love their sweet shrimp sushi. I usually order that separate from their all-you-can-eat menu because it comes with a friend shrimp head. I'm telling you, that shrimp head is worth it. It is so good. Every time we go on Sunday, the restaurant is steady but not super busy. We always get seated promptly and greeted quickly. I will say the servers are very handsome and sweet. Sometimes, they are a little slow, but they do a great job. The sushi chefs are great. The way they present the sushi is beautiful. See the pictures.

Maybe not as flashy as some of the bigger names in Denver (cough Hapa cough) but I came here recently and had a great experience.We each started with a bottle (flask? carafe? What are those things called) Purple Haze Sake which was really good- I don't even like sake much but this one I could have even gone for seconds. As the most expensive drink on their HH menu, it was only $6.50 for a large which is awesome because I didn't even finish it until I was done with my food. For food I got to try half of my dining partner's mushroom roll appetizer, the Vegas roll, white tuna nigiri and red snapper nigiri.

I ordered the new style sashimi and the Naruto roll around 9:10pm. The lady told me it'd be ~40mins wait. Reasonable wait time on a weekend night I thought, and I wasn't terribly hungry so didn't quite mind it.9:35 rolled around and I heard my doorbell rang, and I thought, \"WAIT...NO. EFFING. WAY! My food is here?\" I went to the door, and there it was, a friendly delivery guy holding my brown bag dinner waiting for me to sign the receipt.

The sushi/sashimi was gorgeously displayed and had pretty little lights amongst the shredded radish. They also had a fuchsia orchid nicely placed on the plate.

Maybe there's no such thing as bad pizza, but there's just no excuse for bad sushi!After hearing positive praise for this sushi spot, I joined a group of friends who frequent Sushi Bay often and I was underwhelmed and completely sad that I didn't just go home and eat leftovers instead! They offer a terrific happy hour and all you can eat special that's cheap!!! But when you combine cheap + sushi, the outcome is poor quality. I will say that the presentation is excellent pairing their subpar food with beautiful orchids and a tasteful plating. Upon first sight I was delighted and eager to enjoy my sushi and rolls. Then the sadness hit like a Mack Truck when I bit into a flavorless and limp salmon skin handroll. Then my eel and cucumber handroll delivered the same tasteless and rubber-like experience. The sushi I tried was salmon, yellowtail, and albacore. Nothing I would ever want to experience again. Just blah, flavorless, and chewy. Thank goodness I only spent a small amount on this meal I can't wait to forget! Even the ginger tasted like a chemical science experiment gone wrong. One of the group who raved about this place, which persuaded me to join-- literally spit some of her food into her napkin and told the very friendly server that something was terribly wrong with her tuna order!!!Needless to say, I didn't even finish eating my food, nor will I ever step foot into this sad sushi spot again.

Mark the rolls and sushi you want and they'll bring it out for you. However, some of the items I wanted weren't on the paper menu, so they said, just write it down and we'll bring it out. Which worked out swimmingly. I got two different rolls and two different nigiri sushi. The rolls were great! I really enjoyed them and I would have them again, but the nigiri I couldn't eat. I tried one piece from both types (salmon and tuna, I think) but could barely get them down. They were extremely dry and didn't taste fresh at all. When I realized that the pieces of sushi were so vastly different in taste to the rolls, I took a look inside the rolls and, sure enough, they were a fish paste instead of slices of fish.Now, don't get me wrong, I have NO problem with that. I will eat the shit out of those types of rolls at sushi happy hour at Go Fish, but I was paying $10-$12 for those rolls and $4-$5 for the nigiri and I've had much better sushi for that price. I think their sushi is WAY overpriced for what they deliver.At the end of the night my tab came out to $50 with tip and I feel like, while I was full, I didn't really get my money's worth when it came to quality.

I probably had a childish look of amazement when they set this thing off. So cool.On to the sushi. I ordered the spicy crispy sushi combo, which comes with spicy tuna, yellowtail, and salmon rolls - a total of 24 pieces of sushi - plus a side of miso soup and simple salad with an Asian dressing. This was an incredible amount of food for only $15! The miso soup was the highlight to me, as it was packed with flavor. However, either the sushi or the soy sauce was insanely salty. I rarely, if ever, have food that is too salty for my handling, but I was grasping for water. Which was my other issue - I had to wave my glass to get more water, and I was quite parched by that point.All in all a good experience, with friendly and accommodating service that was a bit spotty at times. Although my sushi wasn't the greatest I've had, it was alright. Some of the fancier rolls others ordered looked really good.

We're immediately seated and notice a large party in the middle of the dining room. \u00a0As we debate what they're there for, the owner (or who I'm assuming was the owner) comes out and makes the longest line of sake bombs I have ever seen. It was all the way down the sushi bar, twice. The whole time he is singing and laughing, and the whole restaurant is into it. They proceed to pass out the sake bombs to EVERYONE in the restaurant, not just the party in the middle, who were celebrating multiple birthdays. Everyone cheered as we toasted the birthday people and drank our free sake bombs.

It's not the BEST in the world but it's definitely one of the best sushi spots in Denver. I've reached out to other yelpers who've left negative reviews about Osaka to ask where they prefer to eat, because honestly I've had a hard time finding better sushi than Osaka for the price, and no one's been able to provide anything worthwhile. I honestly think they might've just had a bad single experience and wrote this place off. Big mistake.Osaka isn't the cheapest option in Denver. As a matter of fact, it might be a bit over-priced.

Also, although the restaurant is small, they accommodated our large group very well on a busy weekend evening - which pleasantly surprised me. However, accommodating a large group posed its issues for the staff during this time. It took a long time to get our first drinks and each additional round after that was the same.

Compound that upon the fact that I'm now a vegetarian and now my options when it comes to sushi are very limited.But my husband got a referral from his barber who works at Proper Barbershop right next door to Okinawa Japanese Cuisine in The HIghlands district and asked me to take a chance on it.

I've eaten more expensive sushi in NYC and SF, but those experiences don't stand up to Okinawa in terms of value. The rolls are creative, beautifully presented and -- balanced. Many sushi places go way over the top with special rolls that are dominated by single flavors. These had themes, but were not cliche and certainly not one dimensional.Can't wait to come back.

You can always swing by for happy hour and enjoy the food at a lower cost. Obviously, a lot of people don't mind the price considering I've had to wait to be seated. Something else to mention is the bar next door. \u00a0They have expanded their area to include a large side room which is stocked."], ["James H.", "Let's be honest: you know the food is good. Damn good. There are a million reviews already talking about the quality of the sushi. As a west coast kid, this spot does not disappoint. If you thought sushi couldn't get any fresher than the coasts, you need to chill on Broadway and Ellsworth more. Here is what I want to really talk about: THE MUSIC. For a sushi spot in the middle of the afternoon, the selection puts most of Denver's \"urban\" clubs (and most clubs here in general) to shame. I probably (definitely) looked like an idiot singing and bobbing my head with a Vegas roll in my mouth, but who cares. Five stars would embarrass myself again."], ["Cris F.", "This place is good. But it can get kinda pricey so the only time we go is during happy hour. It is centrally located on Broadway which is nice. I also like that they have a variety of vegetarian sushi. They have this one roll that is called the Zombie roll which is AWESOME!!!The service here is always nice and they have a patio but during the later hours of the day like 3ish the sun is in the west so the patio gets no light from the sun there fore no heat. Just FYI.. But the patio does get an awesome view for all of the awesome people watching from it that can be had here. As long as none of them palms my sushi were good.

The experience started off well, with a quick greeting and being seated right away. We took some time to put in an order and make decisions on what rolls we wanted, but after that it all went downhill. We ordered 3 small rolls, and 2 of the specialty ones. I noticed that a larger group had been seated after us and they were served their food before we got ours! Grr. That upsets me. We ended up waiting an HOUR for our food. Meanwhile, the weird waiter kept coming by and asking us if we're still doing ok with just our water, but neglected to mention when the heck our food was coming out. Had to stop him and ask him directly as he kept swooping by us back and forth. And finally, the food came. The sushi itself, as I said, was underwhelming. Definitely not the best. The rolls were good size, but the rice was actually a bit hard. They weren't really well made, because the sushi kept falling apart as I was trying to eat. On top of that, the menu was full of rolls with either jalape\u00f1o or spicy sauce, very few without these options. Now, don't get me wrong, I love my spice but neither of those were wanted in my whole sushi order. They need to be a little more creative. The long wait for food, the menu's selection, and the overall badly made sushi are not enough to bring me back here."], ["Justin W.", "This is a pretty solid 4 star sushi place. I come here for lunch ever so often and sometimes I'm the only one here - which is odd because you can get a steal of a deal on a bento box for just $8.

They have a few spaces in a lot shared with other businesses in the building, and metered parking in front. If you can't find anything there, it's going to be a walk. Once inside, the space is bright, and there is plenty of seating. There are classic rolls as well as some very inventive custom ones, like the One Night Stand (which is excellent) and Sex on the Beach. Personally, I hate eel sauce so many sushi places drizzle all over their rolls, and specifically asked that it be left off. Our server made a note of this, so I was surprised the chef put it on anyway as my order was placed on the counter.

It was one of the nicer weekends of this season, so a few tables were sitting outside enjoying the weather. We sat inside near the lounge and ordered a few sushi rolls.The nigiri was fresh-tasting and well-cut; the Philly and unagi rolls were also tasty. We each had a bowl of miso soup before we started with our rolls and the soup was very filling.Service was quick albeit the server seemed distracted by other customers coming in and out of the outside patio. The one thing that bothered me though: the bus pans near the bathroom. Dirty plates were stacked up in these bus pans and, well, I was concerned about sanitary issues. Not sure if this is a regular thing for them, but it bothered me having to stare at the pile of dirty dishes in plain sight. Let's hope that Go Fish doesn't usually leave their dirty dishes out like that, because it'd be sad to see them get a health code violation for this."], ["Alex S.", "I came in for lunch, and ordered the beef teriyaki lunch box.

I was nursing an all day hangover recently and wanted something simple and relatively healthy without having to move from my couch. I was perusing GrubHub and decided to check this place out. I ordered miso soup, a house salad, and teriyaki vegetables. I know what you're thinking-- why wouldn't I order sushi from a restaurant called Go Fish? Excellent question. I probably should have, but my body wasn't ready to branch too far beyond saltines and Gatorade. The miso soup was very good, the house salad was waaaay too soggy but the dressing had a nice flavor to it regardless. The teriyaki vegetables were okay, slightly overcooked and not particularly memorable. I noticed a lot of interesting, creative vegetable sushi on the menu which is a rarity at most places, so I will definitely return here when I am feeling more adventurous and less hungover!"], ["Tiffany H.", "Went here this past Friday night.

The waiter was extremely apologetic, and we got our second plate quickly afterward. No harm, no foul.

We chose to sit outside because we didn't want to wait for 30 min for a table, but by the time they set up the tables it was 20 min already which consisted only of prepacked silverwares and piled high plates with wobbly tables.Impossible to flag waiter down and apparently spilting the bill by two is too tough of a math equation to do.Food: we ordered a sashimi sushi boat for 4 while the rest of our group ordered rolls. First of all, everyone's plate came out at different time so we all had to eat separately which is socially awkward. Our boat came out 40 min later...all with varieties of 2 to 3 pieces each and some even one. If you have a boat that serves 4, \u00a0how do you expect us to spilt 3 pieces of salmon o 2 pieces of tuna nigiri etc? We ended up cutting them in half and I don't think that's the right way to eat sushi. We rather you give us less varieties of 4 slices each than more. What's more annoying is they don't let you substitute rolls of equal values if you have an intolerance to an ingredient in the roll. Quality wise...rice were too soft that we can't pick it up with our chopsticks. Rolls were made choppy, didn't see any of the fancy presentation like those pix on yelp and they still took 40 min. Fish was below average. One our friend didn't receive a roll and they double checked the sushi order list and were indeed wrong. We asked them to take it off the bill since we don't want to wait any longer. Well, I guess the waiter had no idea how to remove an item from the bill. Instead of removing it, he simply put in a discount for the price of the roll on the bill \"after-tax\". So we ended up paying an extra $0.80 for tax bcs he didn't know how to properly use his system just like he couldn't do spilt bill math. Overall, they were very inflexible, inconsiderate, and untrained. Absolutely fail in the ethic of sushi and business. Gotta be better sushi joint in Denver. This is not one of them."], ["Will M.", "The sushi was great but honestly I've never had worse service in my life. David was our waiter and he mumbled the entire time, spilled soup on the table, and forgot multiple items. We were waiting 20 min for my friend's roll to arrive.

Before I visit a sushi bar I always call and make sure they have fresh Uni, which was the reason I ended up at Taki's tonight. The service was fantastic, and being that it was happy hour my beer was only 2 bucks! If you're like me, I usually just go straight shashimi (no mayo, sugary sauces, or anything to take away from the fish itself). So most of my order was my favorites + a salmon skin roll for a crunchy filler to my meal.The salmon was perfect. Fell more on the fatty side rather then lean, so it had a nice buttery feel when you bit into it. The mackerel was a small portion, but it had a perfect marinade to it. Not too vinegary. The Uni was spectacular, as it should be. I wasn't surprised when both chefs told me that was their favorite fish as well. However, slightly a smaller portion then I've had at Okinawa, but that's totally fine. The only criticism on the meal was the black pepper tuna. It was the only think that wasn't fresh. The tuna tasted aged, and was masked by the apparent old bay seasoning on the outside. As a tuna lover, I would've love to enjoyed the toro, but not for 14$ an order. Yes, I know it is usually 70$ a lb. There were many other options other then the black pepper tuna I wish I had gone with, and I do love a good lightly seared tuna. AThe rice seemed slightly undercooked and seasoned for sushi rice as well. Also, this place used their smoked salmon for salmon skin rolls... Not too big of a fan of that. As a sushi chef myself, that was the most surprising. The grain size of the rice seemed slightly larger than other restaurants, and it might have seemed undercooked being I was the first costumer there. Overall I will definitely go back to Taki's. Between then and Okinawa on Colfax, it's very enjoyable to sit down at the bar for a solo sushi session and talk to the chefs. I'll do my occasional sasa and sushi den, but as someone who eats sushi almost every day of the week, who could afford it. You will get quality and costumer care at Taki's, so please give them a try! Hope this helps."], ["Dan P.", "Best Sushi I've had in Denver! Very reasonably priced for the quality of food.

My good friend and I arrived at this quiet neighborhood only to find this restaurant fully packed. We were fortunate to sit at the edge of the sushi bar with little elbowroom to spare. The high noise level, blue walls, brown floors, and small tables that were vertically arranged to face the sushi bar sums up their compact interior and a very festive crowd. The Agedashi Tofu ($4.50) was lightly fried and served with warm tentsuyu sauce on the side. The exterior of the tofu didn't encompass the sticky starchy quality and the inside should have been silkier. The Beef Short Ribs ($7) were stiff and didn't have much flavor without the teriyaki sauce. I had high hopes for these dishes but the taste and quality didn't shine through.I wanted to order Omakase but strangely the server didn't know what it was. My choice of nigiri included Super White Tuna ($2.50/piece), Yellowtail ($2.50), Salmon ($2.50), Salmon Eggs ($2.5), Spicy Lobster ($7), Spicy Scallop ($2.50), Sea Urchin ($4), and Spicy Blue Crab ($7). I thought the Spicy Lobster and Spicy Blue Crab had too much mayo, but the rest were fresh albeit the lack of sweet surge at the end. Service was sporadic but the unexpected plate of pineapples at the end gave the meal a nice closure. From the standpoint of food and atmosphere, interested diners should expect a more casual experience than the likes of Sasa and Den. Aoba sushi will be my next sushi destination in Denver.

Loved the Tatami room!"], ["K M.", "This is a beautiful restaurant with first rate Japanese food. \u00a0The Tatami rooms are secluded and fun; overall the restaurant was clean and very comfortable. \u00a0The Shabu Shabu is HUGE, tons of fresh veg and deliciously thin cut Rib Eye. \u00a0The tempura calamari or vegetables are both a must have, light and crispy, not greasy at all; the perfect batter clung to its host food and didn't fall off after one bite. \u00a0The Sashimi is first rate and extremely fresh and the miso soup was buttery, rich and delicious! \u00a0Pork Katsu is always good, but here it's enormous and so crispy. \u00a0The Early Dinner plates are a great value if you are there before 6. \u00a0Service was great!"], ["Max F.", "Service and food are amazing! Prices are extremely fair! My favorite is the pork tonkatsu"], ["Vin E.", "This past Saturday night I had a spectacular sushi dinner here at their sushi bar. \u00a0Their fish is of the freshest quality and this new restaurant in Cherry Creek is spectacular. \u00a0Their nigiri is spectacular and the rolls are expertly crafted. \u00a0Great service, great food, a great time. \u00a0I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."]]}
