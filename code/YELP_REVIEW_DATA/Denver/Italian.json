Even though I stopped in during Restaurant Week, you would never know from the quality and attention each plate gets. Our waitress was sweet and knowledgable about all the dishes and the wine selection. She also help convince my friend to try their octopus and sea vegetable appetizer - which was my absolute favorite. The octopus texture was meaty and no where near the common chewy you often find. We also ordered a small cheese plate, something I will return just to snack on again. With almonds, honey and aged Spanish goat cheese. Yum!Every dish was equally simple in presentation and complex in flavor. Smart cooking and delicious concepts."], ["Michael H.", "My wonderful daughters took me out to eat here for a birthday treat. It was great. We tried at least 25% of the menu. Favorite food items were the octopus, mushroom soup, crispy chicken, tuscan salami. Nice wine list with a range of choices. Service was good and we felt we could stay at our table as long as we wished. W32nd Ave is in an interesting neighborhood. Any gripes? The kitchen was kind enough to split our single order of soup 3 ways, but it was lukewarm, a minor disappointment."], ["Martine C.", "We waited 20 minutes for a drink, 45 minutes for bread. Vegetables on a board tomatoes and mushrooms yummy ,pickled baby turnips ,green beans carrots, eggplants ,a teaspoon of each -so vinegary it hurt.Next came a small tiny bowl of pasta with breadcrumbs and it was so full of anchovies so salty it was like a salt lick literally . Next came a vegetarian dish of crazy salty chickpeas topped with \u00a0slices of eggplant my friend had to spit it out she thought it was gross,that was a first. House made ice cream- toasted almond no toasted almonds or even a hint of almond,pistachio no nuts no flavor. Very good truffle! Would we go back, my husband said not a chance.$$$$$$$$$$$"], ["W F.", "They have really gotten their act together. The food is fabulous. I had to try it one more time since I had some time in my hands and they have the best leisurely lunch in LoHi. Their service has improve 100% and the food is still fantastic.

Dinner is really good too, especially if you get one of their cocktails."], ["Becky S.", "I love this place. \u00a0I almost hesitate to write an excellent review, because I love that we have been able to sneak in for a table at the last minute, and I don't want it to get too popular. \u00a0I've been to Spuntino half a dozen time, and only once did I order something I didn't care for. \u00a0It's just a lovely little restaurant; my favorite place for an intimate dinner with my husband. And as difficult as it is, we try to restrain how much we order for app/dinner, but the sea salt caramel gelato is a must!"], ["Mark S.", "Great Italian meal with wonderful flavors. I ordered the spring squash bruschetta and the Burrata insalata as a main course. Dessert was the caramel-chocolate-sea salt gelato. The bruschetta was outstanding, but I really didn't like having to share it with my dining companions. I wanted more. The Burrata was truly outstanding. Everything was fresh and light. The roasted pine nuts and apple butter spread delightfully accented the dish. The gelato was very good and smooth. However, can gelato get better than actually eating it on the French Riviera? Gelato has more to do with your surroundings than its actual quality, IMHO. Overall I highly recommend Sputino for lunch or dinner."], ["Hilary S.", "Spuntino is my favorite restaurant in this city and at the top of my list when visitors come from out of town. Elliot and his staff have given me impeccable service every time I've been here. I have never encountered an \"off night.\" Anna was our server last time, and she was wonderful! We had the cheese plate and the red pepper bruschetta to start. The cheese was a goat taleggio that I was hesitant about at first, since taleggio can be quite pungent and not for everyone, but it was creamy and pleasing and came with apricots and cherries that were in a light syrup made with alcohol (was it bourbon? I've forgotten..). The bruschetta had a red pepper pesto-type spread on it, with a slight drizzle of basil pesto on toasted bread. Both appetizers were beautiful and accompanied by a fantastic Barolo wine suggested by the bartender.I usually stick to pasta when I come here because they make all of it in house (and its the best pasta I've ever had, hands down). However, the way Anna described the elk... I HAD to try it and was not disappointed. The seasoning and the way they cooked it was perfect! It was served with some cranberries and beluga lentils. My friends had the butternut squash pasta and the pasta special which was fetticuine that had a corn mousse on it. Both were phenomenal. I've had the butternut squash pasta before. I dream about it. Elliot gave us a suggestion for a second bottle of wine that paired perfectly.Then of course was dessert. Orange olive oil cake served warm with pistachio gelato. Need I say more? I had the mint chocolate chip gelato and my other friend had the strawberry sorbet. Both were incredible. We also had the almond coconut macaroons, which were still warm and exactly as macaroons should be. Overall an incredible and satisfying meal. Here's what you shouldn't expect: Olive Garden-esque portions and cheesy Italian decor. Their restaurant is beautiful and will make you feel at home. Yes, their portions are a little smaller, but their pasta is delicate and made with love and care and is way more flavorful than any other pasta you've ever had. Just admit it. In fact, I would pay double for it. Also, you don't come out feeling sick because you've eaten way more than you should. I appreciate a restaurant that doesn't \"super size\" their entrees. What you should expect:A long evening filed with amazing food in a comforting environment with a staff that isn't pushy and knows a lot about what they're serving you. You will be happy when you leave. You should make a reservation on the weekend if you don't like to hang out at the bar and wait.Thank you Spuntino. You are an absolute treasure.XO,Your biggest fan."], ["Bill F.", "favorite restaurant !this is my wife and my favorite place.while the food is amazing we really enjoy the deliberately SLOW pace \u00a0- meaning - if youve ever had a long slow meal in Paris with lots of yummy courses, lots of well paired wine/champagne... this is your place, so sit down, have a glass of champagne, work the menu from the top down...enjoy the deliberate slow place and for once ... taste your food, have a good interrupted \u00a0meal.Part II: if you're used to your food being dished out on one (1) plate then the check being presented 46 1/2 seconds later so they can free up the table for the next reservation - this may not be the place for you....Part III: the wife and I will be back from date night soon ... \u00a0save the table by the window for us..."], ["Jessica J.", "My husband and I had dinner at Spuntino a few weeks ago with a friend and absolutely loved everything about the place. The decor is very rustic-modern and really gives it a neighborhood restaurant feel. For three of us, we shared a bottle of wine, had a selection of bruschetta to start and shared three different pasta dishes family-style. The prosciutto on the bruschetta was salty and flavorful. \u00a0The pasta was house-made and cooked perfectly - just slightly al dente. I would put their pasta dishes up against many of the dishes that we had while in Italy last summer. I would suggest having reservations on a weekend night as the restaurant is pretty small. Also, it is not a late night joint - I think the kitchen starts closing up at 10PM, so probably best to make after-dinner drink plans elsewhere. \u00a0All in all, great experience. I am pretty sure this will be a regular spot for my husband and me in the future."], ["Joshua H.", "EhhhSuper spendy for what you get!!

Perfectly balanced between meat and veggies, it was crazy good! Then we tried what sounded like it would be just too much... it's one of the best desserts I've ever had. The Chocolate Hazelnut Fried Wontons with fresh fruit and ice cream was unbelievably good! The charming waiter was so nice and pleasant and the simple but refined decor was excellent, I also very much appreciated that they displayed local artists paintings for sale, I was very nearly tempted to buy one but had no easy way to get it home.I can't recommend this place enough! The only downside I can say is that they deserve to be in a free standing building of their own instead of the strip mall where they're out now. Everyone should go here to eat so they can eventually do just that! Spectacular surprise!! Can't wait to go back!"], ["Cheryl L.", "Some of the best pasta, sauce and meatballs that I've had in a very long time.This charming little place is tucked into a strip mall between Havana and Parker Rd. on Iliff.I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting but the pasta was cooked perfectly. \u00a0The meatballs were moist and flavorful - the right amount of seasoning and the sauce had the perfect seasoning with the right amount of kick.We also ordered the Shrimp BLT Sandwich and it was good, don't get me wrong but the spaghetti and meatballs were the star of the show. \u00a0The service was friendly and quick and the prices are very reasonable.So if you find yourself in this neck of the woods, stop in and grab a bite - you won't be disappointed."], ["Dennis W.", "We happened to be in the area and looked at Yelp for a nice bar.

They had happy hour, we did the wontons, absolutely great. The coconut shrimp was outstanding but the pizza was over the top. We had the kitchen sink and I told my wife I'd move to Denver just to be near this place. I don't write reviews but because people before me recommended Cody's I wanted to be sure if you are looking at this you will not be disappointed.

Don't let the exterior fool you, the moment you walk through the doors you are transported to an upscale dining experience. We started with the mushroom potstickers. Perfectly cooked with a sundried tomato sauce that doubled as a dressing for the greens the potstickers were served on. I had the Angel-Hair Chicken which was AMAZING. Fresh tasting veggies and grilled chicken rounded out this light and delicious pasta dish. My boyfriend tried the fish and chips.

That said, the food and service were just as great.We ordered a few of the HH items, including the Chef's Board (meats, cheeses, \"other goodies\"), a few pizzas (Margherita, daily special - Fig/Chicken - pizza). The pizza was fresh and bright, with a light, airy crust that I would put against almost any I've had in the area.

We opt to wait on the patio for a few drinks while our table was ready (drinks were a bit weak, although tasty, but with a $10 price tag). They ended up seating us in the back of the restaurant in front of a big window. The atmosphere was perfect. It was not too loud for conversation which is a big plus in my book. We started off with the arancini (risotto balls) and they were great, we enjoyed the zucca chips as well, but there isn't much to them so I wouldn't order them as my only appetizer.

It's very difficult to find a restaurant that can boasts of such offer.You can choose to sit outside or inside. No worries if you decide to sit outside. The service is top notch. Fast, attentive and genuine.We ordered a few small plates: Braised Meatballs, Calamari, Truffle Garlic Bread and Caesar salad. The Braise Meatballs came with Grilled Bread and Red Sauce. It was one of the best six pieces of meatballs I've had. The sauce sealed the deal. There's nothing added to it to make it taste less than what it should be. Just red sauce that's well seasoned. The Calamari was perfectly crunchy and was mixed in with fresh arugula lightly dressed in lemon vinaigrette. It's an awesome juxtaposition of fried and healthy. Combined together end result was an explosive great, healthy, guilt free dish. The Truffle Garlic bread came in a medium size skillet. All brown and crunchy with an obvious amount of garlic stuck to the entwined truffle infused bread. The Caesar salad that we shared was lightly moist with dressing and rained on with a good amount of fine mozzarella goodness.Everything was great. I can't pick a favorite. They do carry pizza as well and to that note we decided to do dinner here sometime soon. In this area if you feel like some Ottimo Cibo drop by! I am a big fan!"], ["Sarah C.", "Love it here...

Recently, after having some serioussss food envy over their pizzas (I'm gluten-free and sadly can't partake) I tried their roasted vegetable salad and added a piece of salmon on top... SO good. The salmon was cooked perfectly (nice portion size too) and the salad didn't leave me feeling underwhelmed in the slightest (how could it with avocado, goat cheese, roasted veggies, quinoa and farro for the gluten-eating folks?!)

The asparagus, prosciutto and creamy cheese bruschetta was the best my husband has ever had! I started with the beet salad, and it was okay. I may have rated it better than \"okay\", except I had to compare it to my husband's bruschetta, which was just phenomenal. I am a big fan of homemade pasta, and I feel like that is a rare find. However, I was underwhelmed with the bolognese. The best way we could describe it was being \"light in flavor\", and not in a good way. I know that authentic Italian is different than what we're used to in America, but I thought that had to do more with a light dressing of sauce, but not lacking in flavor. I'm traveling to Italy in April, so I may have to come and revise my review after that trip. ;o)Hubs was pleased with the wine menu. He selected a Malbec (the pricier one; I'm not seeing their wine menu online). As I'm finding is common in Denver, the beer menu was IPA-heavy. I lucked out that the seasonal rotation from Fat Tire was their Portage, so at least I had one dark beer to choose from aside from Guinness. I'd come back. I think I'll try their pizzas next time.

Walking up to the building I definitely thought this place would be more of a modern, fusion take on Italian food.

We ordered a full course starting with the burrata as an appetizer, caesar salad, and two entrees-- one of the Spaghetti with Meatballs and then the Chicken Parmesan sandwich. The food was all incredibly fresh. The pesto served with the burrata we ate was homemade prepared right there as we ordered it. And the ciabatta bread was absolutely soft with a little bit of crunch. The caesar salad was flavourful and not dry and lacking in zest like most appetizers. The kicker however was the meatballs! Talking with the manager we learned that the meatball recipe was passed down a couple of generations and has become the staple dish at DiFranco's. The menu boasts that Italian traditionalism and quality as there are only a few entree items to choose from. This made me wary at first, but I see now why they offer fewer entree selections--the meatballs are THAT good. Flavor, spice, and a perfect balance of moistness without falling apart. I can't say enough about this place except to go and order and be astonished at the experience you'll have. Talk with the staff because they know their food!

However, on my birthday it was honestly the worst service I've ever received in my life. I'm mostly writing this review so the management at Angelo's knows what I experienced here and hopefully takes steps to correct it. Until then, I can't say I'll be returning. Here's why: I called in the morning the day before my birthday and told them I would have a large party coming in for drinks and food the next night. When I arrived, they weren't even close to prepared and the server had an attitude. I wasn't upset about that until the rest of the night continued that way.The server, Brittany flat out ignored one of my friends - anytime she ordered something, Brittany forgot her order. She had to wait an hour for her entree after everyone else had gotten theirs and eaten! It took us 20 minutes alone to wave our server down to tell her because she never checked on our table and kept walking by without looking at us. Eventually, I got up to look for her and she was around the corner talking to her coworkers (not about work).This behavior continued when my friend ordered drinks - she would bring everyone else's but not hers. Additionally, she forgot other people's food and drink orders but the way she treated this particular friend was aggressively rude. She didn't even comp my friend's order that was an hour late!!! When any of us would say something about orders she forgot to bring (note: we did so politely because we understood we were a large table and we've all been servers before and get what it's like), she had an attitude with us as if it were somehow our faults that she didn't bring us food or pay any attention to us. We were ordering a lot of food and drinks so she was going to get a big tip from us. She could've been pleasant and somewhat attentive! It was like she didn't even try. In fact, the high school age bus girl was more sweet and attentive to us than our server. (Please promote her to server - she was great! Unfortunately, I don't remember her name, but I would happily come in and point her out so she gets the credit she deserves for being so lovely that night.) At the end of the night, we were all discussing what we were going to tip and everyone said they were still going to tip her a fair amount even though collectively we were all dissatisfied with the server. However, our server didn't give us a chance. She automatically added 20% gratuity - without even telling us! There wasn't a note about that amount automatically added to parties of a certain number on the menu, plus having been a server myself I was surprised they added 20% since everywhere I've worked it has typically been 10-15% with a line for an optional additional tip.All in all, I was shocked at the service from Brittany. I had been to Angelo's before and had great service, but Brittany was so terrible to us that I cannot fathom going back even though this was likely a case of one bad seed tainting it for the rest of them. I truly hope Angelo's considers better training for servers in the future so this kind of behavior doesn't continue at this otherwise lovely establishment."], ["Charles C.", "Wow - those chipotle oysters had a kick!

I've tried a few of their pastas including the spicy shrimp dish, Gorgonzola steak, and the classic spaghetti with meatballs. Every single was has been superb. The eggplant Parmesan is great as well, but it can be hit or miss. They don't always fully cook the egg plant well so it comes out chewy. The meatball sliders are adorable and quite tasty to boot. The decor inside is home-y and not too flashy. They hire a great wait staff that are attentive, personable, and pleasant to talk to.They have a larger selection of beers, wines, and drinks on their menu.

So great that we went back a second time for dinner the very next night. Excellent fresh oysters (according to my boyfriend, I don't care for them and that has nothing to do with Angelos), however the \"original\" char grilled oyster was delicious, and I don't like oysters!! The lasagna was made perfectly with lots of fresh mozzarella. The bruschetta was SO GOOD. I will say the only miss was the pappardelle. I loved the fresh pasta but they added a ton of cream to the meat sauce and it gave it a weird milky flavor. We asked for some fresh Parmesan and it fixed the issue and put flavor back in, but if I ordered it again I would ask for marinara not the sauce the come with it."], ["Matt H.", "We were really excited about the reviews for this place, but not as excited about the hour wait time ( which makes sense for a Friday ) so we decided to do take out.

She did so and she came back and informed us that there was nothing wrong with the dessert and that it \"must have been a bad bite\".... All three of us must have had a \"bad bite\" then because we all agreed it was horrible. If you claim to be an Italian restaurant, expect Italians to keep you in check.

We were warmly welcomed by our server who was knowledgeable of the menu and gave excellent wine pairing advice. We were in the mood to leave stuffed and sleepy and that's exactly what we did. The menu consists of your basics as well as some family Sicilian recipes that came highly recommended. I ordered seafood fra diavolo and my boyfriend, the veal bracioli. Both entrees were served with fresh Italian bread and a caesar salad. My entree had a generous spread of seafood and excellent spice and flavor. The veal bracioli was tender and hearty, served with mixed veggies and fettuccine. Since our first experience at Odyssey we have also tried the fettuccine carbonara which I would definitely order again. It was rich and heavy but the flavor was amazing. We have also tried the classic chicken marsala which was on the sweeter side but again, I was very impressed. This unassuming Sicilian family restaurant is a staple in my opinion.

The owner and chefs son graciously greeted us and shook my hand, escorted us up to the third floor of what used to be a home which is 110 years old. He sat us in a quiet room called the violin room and we had it to ourselves. Shared wine, bread and fantastic Caesar salad with from scratch dressing. Then the owner and chef who is Sicilian came to our table and shook my hand and greeted my wife and spoke with us about the building, the food and beverages as well as a short history of Sicily. He told the waiter to bring us a conolli and his homemade lemoncello at the end of the meal. We each had the penne rustica which had homemade ricotta and some of the best sausage and sauce I've ever had. It was amazing to say the least and the service from Giullermo, the owner and his son was equally amazing. The best part of the night was actually the conolli and homemade lemoncello.

Let's organize why I cannot go with the other yelpers:- food: I ordered the rack of lamb and my boyfriend the ossobuco. My lamb had the perfect texture, but it was unbelievably SALTY. Let's add in from Brazil, where we do not like mildness when it's about salt. The spices were nice (love rosemary), but after a few bites it was just too much. Disappointing. The ossobuco was dry. VERY DRY, and considering that it was lightly red, it was medium rare, so I'd say it was just bad quality meat. For appetizers we had the fried calamari, we had the house salad and warm bread with our entrees. House salad had fresh and crispy lettuce, our second bread was fresh, too, but the first one was too chewy. Cannoli was very yummy, great texture and flavor. I think I had settled high expectations for it, but not even that explains the 64 dollars+taxes for salty and dry meat. After taxes, it was a 120 dollars check for what I'd pay 60 or so.- staff: another disappointment. They were friendly indeed, but for a Tuesday after 8pm, service was slow. We had to remind them about our bread. Also, when I asked about a sparkling wine, the waitress who supposedly knows wines, brought me a bold fruity red. And I even had said \"maybe something ros\u00e9\".- ambience: it was romantic, low light and soft music, but they should pay more attention when they get reservations. After had asked for the most romantic and nice table in the house to celebrate my boyfriend's bday, we were sat beside the noisiest table, with 5 drunk guys celebrating something. Those guys even broke a bottle on the only tight corridor to walk in the restaurant, and the staff cleaned it with this super strong-smelly product. Not the best to have in your nose while having dinner. Maybe they just should separate big parties to what is obviously date tables, once the restaurants has two different dinning areas? Last thing: the kitchen is open to the rest of the restaurant, which made my hair and clothes have a strong fried food smell. Not nice!Conclusion: I will keep the two stars because after the noisy table left our area, we had a nice moment. But can't give it more than two stars because the food was really disappointing.

It's a very romantic spot."], ["Alice G.", "It has taken me AGES to make it to the famous Barolo grill which has been a Denver Darling for many years now! \u00a0Tucked on 6th, it never seemed to jog my memory at the right time...until now.Yes, we all know the food and service is excellent, the wine list a tome thicker than my thesis, and that the staff heads to Italy or the south of France annually to collect wine and enjoy the food!Finally, the event that brought me here was the stinking Corpse Flower at the Botanic Gardens. Truly. \u00a0And Truly Stinking. \u00a0After waiting in line for many hours to see the wonder of the smelly plant, the group was exhausted, starving, and UBERING so we said...Hmm, what's nearby? \u00a0And Yay! Barolo finally came to mind, and wonder of wonders, they had a table open- so we were on our way!As other reviewers have mentioned, the service is top notch and we were not disappointed with our server Carmen. \u00a0The food was divine. The C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne was yummy and complemented our many many courses. We tried the caprese, melone con Prosciutto, the mushroom salad, the duck, the rabbit, and two pasta dishes. The pasta dishes, by the way, were ASTOUNDING and should be the first thing you order here! My daughter even took one for the team with a teeny scoop of gelato at the end. \u00a0Bellisimo.Bravo, Barolo, Bravo! \u00a0It is nice to find something that lives up to it's name."], ["Kerry S.", "Our favorite special occasion restaurant in Denver. We have been maybe 8 times over the last few years. Service is stellar, supremely competent, welcoming and relaxed. Food is a combination of creative and approachable, perfectly balanced flavors. Salads can sometimes have a bit more sweetness than I prefer (fichi and rucola salad with hazelnuts last night was delicious, wish it had maybe a tad more balsamic). \u00a0Mezzaluna cacio e pepe was like a ravioli with melted cheese inside, delicious cheese sauce with just the right balance of some kind of alcohol to liven it up, and liberal pepper ... Truly one of the best dishes I have ever eaten. Since it was our anniversary, they even brought out a little after dinner drink and chocolate truffles for us. I haven't mentioned the other delicious courses, but rest assured you truly can't go wrong. Wine is highly marked up, more than standardly at restaurants, maybe 3-3.5 times retail (a $15 bottle at the store will run say $50 here)."], ["Jennifer M.", "I've been wanting to try this place for years, but they were either not open (they are closed Sunday and Mondays), or fully booked on days I called to make a reservation. I finally got to try this place and I'm so happy I did. The restaurant is intimate and classy, and the staff were so friendly. The waiter did a great job in explaining the a la carte and tasting menus, as well as explain anything on the a la carte was able to be ordered in tasting portions. For an appetizer, I ordered the Crudo di vitello, which was beef tartar served as a flat square the size of a toast, with a quail egg on top, and crispy ciabatta bread on the side. I'm usually weary of ordering beef tartar because of the iron taste in raw beef, but this did not have that at all. I also ordered the Tajarin al rag\u00f9 di verdure in a tasting portion, which was about 5 or 6 bites. It came with morel mushrooms, artichokes, spinach, thin slices of parmigiano reggiano on top, with a creamy, white sauce. Even though I did really enjoy this dish, I'm glad I did not order it a la carte because it was rich. For me, 5-6 bites was perfect. Additionally, I ordered the Gnocchi con granchio which came with big chunks of delicious crab, parsley, and shredded pieces of celery in a red sauce. The food was magnificent and I really enjoyed my time here. I definitely plan to return and try more from their menu."], ["Jason G.", "There's a reason that many very wealthy and yes slightly stuffy people are frequenting this star of Denver cuisine... If you have a demand for flawless service. I mean perfect service then Barolo will exceed your already other worldly needs for what a dining experience should look, feel, and taste like. Are they the perfect picture of modern food trends? No. They are the perfect picture of a service and quality focused restaurant where the dining experience is second to none. Upon walking in my girlfriend and I who are in our 30s and truly demand quality in all aspects of our life, without acting like spoiled aristocrats were pleasantly greeted and shown to our reserved table. Moments later we had water, menus, and were made to feel welcomed. This was an ordinary night for us. No special occasion no grand celebration. For us this is how we choose to enjoy a Friday night out together. \u00a0And enjoy is an understatement for how we experienced our night!Our server named Chris who is a level one Sommelier took the lead on helping us discover a new Italian wine. While he could have sold us a several hundred dollar bottle from the wine catalogue, he brought a very fair priced Super Tuscan. It was remarkable. While it could have used a slight chill, we drank every last drop with glee. Going back to Chris-- he was charming, kind, and a wonderful guide through our entire 2+ hour dining oasis of flavor and enjoyment. This was this finest service we have experienced in the Denver area by far! This is an example of what extraordinary service should look like. Take notes restaurant owners and chefs...When we walked in the door we immediately noticed huge flower arrangements throughout the dining room. I love fresh cut flowers and I think this is a brilliant and tasteful addition to an already classy and warm dining room. I haven't even mentioned food yet and my heart is racing with excitement I feel even just writing this review...Here's a fair critique that they could improve on. The bread sticks and dipping sauce are so 1990's and a restaurant of this level could serve artisan bread and fine olive oil with flaked sea salt and the guests would drool from moment one. In this day and age serving standard table salt on any table should be stricken and removed from practice. Now that I have that out of the way, allow me to rave and I mean RAVE over the food coming out of that star worthy kitchen. Not only did the food come out looking like a photographic tease, it was quick even on a busy night, and the tastes were exemplary in every way. Rather than go for the chefs tasting we opted to create our own food adventure and from the first bite of the asparagus with perfectly cooked egg and yummy goodness we were in our own perfect foodie paradise. Imagine going to a farmers market and selecting the most beautiful ingredients to cool for your dinner guests-- this is how we felt looking and tasting our dishes. The next course was a delightful salad full of shaved veggies and was just perfectly dressed. When we were presented with a gluten free pasta version of bolognese it was nearly a fight to stab our forks into the bowl as we couldn't believe the tastes we were experiencing. It was surreal. Our mains were the Halibut and Duck. Let me just say that this was a dead man walking to die for meal every sense, taste, and mouthful of perfectly cooked food. The plates were gorgeous, the balance of flavors sang out loud, and the meats were exquisite in taste and preparation. Last we were given a trio of homemade sorbets that were the closing grace on an incredible and very memorable meal. Again this is not a place to go for a dinner, it is an experience to have to savor and to enjoy. My truest compliments to the entire crew for a memorable first glimpse of what this kitchen and dining room has to offer guests with a taste and demand for culinary excellence. Please trust me when I say leave the children home, carve out 2+ hours, and treat yourself to some of the finest service and dining bliss available in Denver. I can't wait to go again!"], ["Rachel C.", "I have been *dying* to try Barolo Grill. Despite a number of missed opportunities, I was finally able to visit last night for the Restaurant Week menu. I am a firm believer that Restaurant Week menus should highlight a restaurant's feature dishes, and boy, did Barolo Grill deliver. The food was fantastic, and the ambiance was cozy, friendly, and literally warm (it felt great inside!), while still having that neighborhood restaurant feel. Service was fantastic - our waitress was very welcoming and walked us through the restaurant week menu and answered our questions about the menu and their annual trip to Italy :)First course: Insalata d'invernoSecond course: Risotto ai funghiEntree: Maiale e verdure d'invernoDessert: Panna cotta alla vanigliaOverall, the food was fantastic. Each course was interesting and perfectly balanced - no overwhelming flavors and no lack of seasoning. Some notes:- The risotto was perfectly al dente and had a lot of mushroom flavor. It was delicious.- All of the components of the pork entree were delicious. Unfortunately, one of my pieces of pork was slightly overdone - it must have been an end piece. Still not enough to underscore the dish as a whole. I really enjoyed my restaurant week experience and can't wait to dine in again on their standard menu. Their standard portions seemed incredibly generous and there is so much left on the menu that I want to try!"], ["Melanie S.", "I was visiting a friend in Denver and he took me to this place for dinner. This is the kind of place you go to celebrate something special or to have a nice date. The atmosphere is relaxing and you feel special because the service is great. They have a sampler available for their pastas if you know you can't do full courses."], ["Craig D.", "My wife and I went here for our anniversary - we were looking forward to it. \u00a0I'll say this: It is what it is. \u00a0We are in our 30's and were by far the youngest people in here. \u00a0It's old, it's stuffy, and it's not a very inviting atmosphere. \u00a0It basically feels like an Olive Garden, just with really high prices (they even have hard breadsticks!). \u00a0I've never and will never spend $25 on 10 tortellini, but that's what I got here. \u00a0I'm not joking...10 tortellini. \u00a0They were tasty, but I was extremely po'd. \u00a0The salad was $15 and consisted of maybe 8 arugula leaves. \u00a0I was disappointed and will for sure not come back. \u00a0I much prefer a younger atmosphere with fresh, new food. \u00a0 If you're into this sort of thing, then by all means have at it."], ["Kelly R.", "Exceptional. But extremely pricey. I can't say that the food was as good as the first visit.... But still one of the best spots in town to splurge."], ["kelley e.", "Food: fantastic. Absolutely incredible in many ways. The pork I had was a bit too fatty for my liking, but it was still a great meal. Atmosphere: we had a great table, everything was relaxed and classy. Service: here's where the stars fall short. We saw our server maybe 5 times. He never spent more than 1 minute at the table. He was completely disinterested in us because we did restaurant week. He wasn't unpleasant, but his apathetic attitude was off-putting and arrogant. I have worked in the service industry for many years, I have worked for some amazing small companies in Denver. I'm not a bum or a stoner, I know my food and my service. If your servers are exhausted from restaurant week, I understand. But you don't have to hate on me because I love a great deal at a great place. Additionally, the valet didn't even ask us upon leaving if we had a car, but immediately asked the women that came out behind us. Rude! I don't think I'll be back for their regular menu after being treated as such..."], ["Jennifer R.", "So I've been wanting to eat here since we moved to Denver but could never justify spending so much. Enter Valentine's Day... We never go out on V-Day so we decided to throw fiscal responsibility to the wind and go anyway. Fortunately, we were not disappointed. Since we had reservations we waltzed (no, we actually danced) right in and sat down. The atmosphere is nice and cozy and it wasn't overly loud despite a full house. Our waitress was Erin (I'm pretty sure) and she was very attentive and patient as I asked for the price of every thing before ordering it :-/. They had a preset menu for the big day and after a cocktail it didn't seem nearly as expensive. My husband's old fashion was particularly delicious, especially considering I really don't prefer dark liquor. Each course was very good but not especially mind blowing or noteworthy. I ended up not eating my appetizer because the fish was very fishy, but my husband enjoyed it for me. That being said there was a few standouts and the service was truly impeccable. The risotto, shut the front door! I am a pasta LOVER, but I liked the risotto even better than my pasta dish. The bread... I can't even explain. It tasted like a focaccia bread roll (which is as mind blowing as it sounds.) I could easily eat my weight in that bread. The wine pairings the server suggested were lovely and well matched with the meal. Overall, we had a great time and thoroughly enjoyed our leisurely dinner. We are so glad we splurged! As I said not everything was crazy delicious, but everything was very good. The service was amazing and that bread..."], ["Leah J.", "The service was friendly, the food was delicious but we all left hungry. \u00a0Portions were too small all the way around.

I had gnocchi with crab meat, my boyfriend had pork tenderloin, with buttermilk chocolate cake for dessert. We were overwhelmed by the 96-page wine list!Two reasons I am not giving five stars: First, we made a reservation through OpenTable and indicated that it was our first time visiting, but at no time was this acknowledged by the host or the server. Second, after our meal, we ordered dessert and an after-dinner drink, but the dessert was brought 5-10 minutes before the drink, leaving us to stare at our dessert while we waited for the drink.Aside from these two small issues, however, it was a great dining experience."], ["Kennen M.", "We heard this is one of the better restaurants in Denver so we were eager to try it while in town. \u00a0I can say this place missed the mark we wished we would have had our nice dinner out somewhere else.Upon walking in, this place caters to a bunch of stuffy, pearl wearing conservative folk. \u00a0I don't mind who my fellow diners are as along as the food was good, in which this place didn't achieve. \u00a0The tables come with a bouquet of crunchy breadsticks that feed your hunger while waiting for your entree. \u00a0I ordered the gnocchi and had assessed that it was the worst gnocchi I have ever had beside the stuff you buy pre-made in a box at a discount grocery store. \u00a0The gnocchi was slightly rubber with a taste of paste. \u00a0Unfortunately the sauce couldn't help save this dish and it was left more than half uneaten.The duck entree was tasty but not to the raging hype of some of the yelpers have proclaimed."], ["shamm w.", "The food here was pretty amazing. If you come here you have to try the Agnolotti Del Plin. It's a pasta filled with veal and has some heavy dark sauce and it's the bomb. Trust you, you will love it. Also they have the best bread ever that has olive oil and rosemary backed on top if it \"I think\". I could just eat the bread all day and be happy. Now, if you are under 40yrs old, you might feel a little out of your element. The restaurant was filled with older people that appeared to have come from old money. Lol. Doctors, stockbrokers, lawyers and so on. There is nothing wrong with that, but if you are a younger couple, you will stand out just a little bit but it's worth it. If you can get a server names \"Mo\" you will be in good shape. She knows the menu like the back of her hand. That's rare now a days. Most people I talk to have to go and ask the chef what the dish is, not Mo. She rocked!"], ["Darika S.", "I don't know why I don't come here more often, (reservation, of course). \u00a0We had an outstanding meal, with awesome waitstaff. \u00a0The host was very pleasant and polite and were seated about 10 minutes after our reservation. \u00a0The bar was out of decanters so had to drink the wine from the bottle.... Of course no biggie, enjoyed a great C\u00f4tes du Rhone for under $60. \u00a0Started with the 24 month aged prosciutto which came with these delicious bread baked in olive oil, they called them Italian doughnuts, I called them freakin' good oil rounds. \u00a0There was plenty of meat too, you could maybe split it with 3 people. \u00a0The fruit de mar salad wasn't bad. \u00a0The calamari was tender, the octopus wasn't that chewy and had cucumber and melon balls to accompany the seafood. \u00a0I'm not the biggest fan of fris\u00e9e salad.The rabbit pasta was very good, nice pieces of tender rabbit and no bones. \u00a0His gnocchi was really good too, homemade marinara with pesto, mmmm. \u00a0Our entree was huge and was almost full at this point, but my pork loin was cooked perfectly and his duck was flavorful \u00a0Really no apps needed with the duck course. \u00a0We ended with espresso and biscotti, (biscotti being like twice the size of a normal biscotti) that was dipped in chocolate. \u00a0Overall a great meal and when you don't get all the courses and wine, it's totally affordable."], ["Barbara M.", "I have heard great things about Barolo Grll for years and read many write ups. \u00a0 Looking at the menus on line, didn't spark my interest much, but this past weekend, all the stars aligned and we went. \u00a0 Have to say, it was delightful. \u00a0 The bread/cracker sticks were yummy, the rosemary rolls we delish. \u00a0We started with a flan that was interesting. \u00a0Delish to one set of taste buds, too subtle to another. \u00a0 I had the Super Caprese and it was yummy. \u00a0Perfect balance of flavors, but the tomatoes could have been bolder. \u00a0 We ordered an entree of gnocchi to sample for the table and that was by far my favorite. \u00a0The sauce was spicy but full of flavor, and the gnocchi was tender. \u00a0 For dinner, I had the the grilled tenderloin and its was as flavorful as they come! \u00a0Highly recommended. \u00a0The restaurant is a little loud, but we managed. \u00a0It is classy and well spaced. \u00a0The service was impeccable. \u00a0 We will be returning, but this is a planned outing not a spontaneous drop in. \u00a0 Closed Sunday and Monday and reservations are needed!"], ["Kelli H.", "I went to Barolo for restaurant week. \u00a0I had heard great things, and I think I was expecting a new and chic restaurant. \u00a0Instead, I found a nice, but pretty standard Italian restaurant. \u00a0Nothing was too flashy, but everything was clearly done really well.I ordered off the non-restaurant week menu, because my stomach had been a little upset that day. \u00a0I ordered the house salad with petite field greens, d'anjou pear, roasted sweet potato, and banyuls sage vinaigrette. \u00a0I also got one of the pastas, with sun dried tomatoes, pine nuts, and cheese. \u00a0The salad really hit the spot, but the pasta was underwhelming.I'll give Barolo another shot next year, since the steaks that my friends got looked awesome."]], "The Garlic Knot": [["Krista E.", "Maybe the best garlic knots I've ever had! \u00a0The pizza was good, service was good and staff were super friendly.

My boyfriend ordered the manicotti, which was admittedly tasty, and we shared some crazy delicious garlic bread, so it gets points for that...but that doesn't do enough to make up for the sad excuse for shrimp scampi I just consumed. There was absolutely no sauce to be found. The noodles were dry, and there was less than a quarter of an inch of water, what I maybe should assume was the sauce? It was more likely just shrimp juice that tasted slightly lemony. Sort of. It was actually pretty gross. If you had thawed frozen shrimp, then boiled the spaghetti and threw some butter and garlic powder, it would have been easily 5 times better than what I order. Plus , it was a lunch quantity? If I'm paying over $10 for a piece of meal, I expect it to taste better than the Italian equivalent to a dollar menu burger.So basically what I'm saying here is stay the hell away from the shrimp scampi."], ["Amy F.", "I am a total fan! ordered delivery a while back.

Absolutely disgusting, pass) and was just meh. There was one other server working and she was talking the ear off someone about how she grew up in NY, all about living there, blah blah blah, it was distracting and annoying. Everything came out really quick which was appreciated but that was the best part about the experience. The house salad is enough to fill up two people so split that if you want a salad. The garlic knot basket is huge and I made the rookie mistake of filling up on those but they weren't garlicy at all so that was a let down. Our pizza came our right after the knots and it seemed small for a medium sized pizza (6 slices total). We got the sausage and pineapple and I love that the sausage was more shredded/sliced than traditional crumbled sausage. The pineapple was canned and too sweet and the pizza as a whole was unmemorable thanks to a bland sauce and tasteless dough. I'm not a complete fool though, I took it to go and it was a little better the day after.

Of the three, two were a pinch too salty. The sopressata picante had a good combination of flavors, and the saltiness added a strong kick, but it was still a bit overwhelming. The short rib was not much better. The meat was incredibly tender (a big plus), and the presentation was great, however again the saltiness brings the taste rating downwards.The dishes almost get it right, but just barely miss the mark.The Artisan pizza needs special attention, however, and it was made rather well. It had a good mix of flavors, and had a tasty sauce to compliment it. One of the best pizzas I have had in Denver.The bread pudding was also quite good. So if you find yourself here, get the pizza and the dessert!Overall, it should also be noted that that food quality/taste in relation to price earns this establishment a low value rating.

Even though my order was based 100% on our awesome waiter Rick's(?) recommendation it was on point. The Braised Short rib was amazing! It was so flavorful and tender. I am definitely in love with this dish. It looks small but it's not and it packs it's wallop in the flavor it possesses. Their Butterscotch bread pudding was excellent. Our starter was the Meat and cheese platter. I had to order this. I must try their creamy Burrata. I wasn't disappointed. The Burrata was one of the best! The rest of the meat and cheeses were all top notch and fresh! My prosecco was a drink made to match my mood and our company's bubbly personality. I was very pleased with everything. The location was one of the sought after not the normal street level restaurant. It sits below the street with a flight of stairs that takes you down to the bar on your right and it opens up to the main dining area. The wall of wines just captured that spirit of Italy where you just want to eat, drink and be merry!The outside seating would be great to people watch. It's my next target.

Osteria Marco beats late night pizza and bar food (to an unrecognizable pulp) any day!"], ["Karen K.", "We met friends here at this Italian restaurant on the well known Larimer Square, a downtown historic Denver block nationally known for their critically acclaimed chefs' owned restaurants. I was told that by a saleswoman from the nearby Overland store at 16th Street mall which was another amazing store to shop at!!!Excited to come to this unique area for the very first time we walked the block to check out the various restaurants, shops and boutiques. Because it was after six in the evening many of the shopping boutiques were already closed but that's okay as my hubby wiped his forehead of imaginary sweat for the umpteenth time!Parking doesn't come easy even though we were here early. But to drive a car rental humongous Suburban we just decided to park at a nearby parking lot to play it safe! The block has metered parking until 8pm plus there was valet parking as well.They do have seating outside but because it was later in the evening the several tables were already occupied. Friends of ours shared their dishes especially the cheese and cured meat! \u00a0If you never had burratta this is definitely the place to try it because they make it fresh everyday and it's out of this world! I had ordered the grilled shrimp salad with spinach leaves, red onions, ricotta cheese, baby cherry tomatoes with a sweet corn vinaigrette dressing which was awesome. My husband's rotisserie chicken salad was even yummier than mine of course bc it wasn't my dish! Lol! Friends of ours ordered the shortrib plate which was magical; the meat was so tender and so flavorful! Why didn't I order that? And Adam ordered the lamb meatball with polenta which also was so very tasty! Butterscotch bread pudding with vanilla gelato & dulce de leche was sweet and so delicious too!I highly recommend coming here. The food and cozy atmosphere were excellent. If you have issues with stairs it may be a issue for you bc that's how you get to the major portion of their restaurant which lies in the basement of the building. I didn't check out the bathroom sorry but I know it's available there if needed. I know if we had another chance to visit this area we would definitely try out the outdoor patio seating unless its horrible weather. So there you have it another five star restaurant! Don't you be hesitant to come here bc you will be definitely missing out!!! I'm so happy we did!"], ["Brandy C.", "The bread pudding is amazing!!!!!! \u00a0Real bread pudding with no extra topping! \u00a0I will come back here for the dessert!Cheese plate is wonderful! \u00a0The selection is lovely! \u00a0I also recommend house salad. \u00a0However, I wasn't impressed by the mushroom pizza!"], ["Aussa L.", "The lamb meatball panini is incredible-- subtle but addicting taste. Service was great, atmosphere was very relaxing. It's the sort of place where you can take your time enjoying the food.There are lots of options depending on your price range. I'm pretty impressed by how delicious a $40 meal (for two) could be."], ["Kelly T.", "Such amazing food!I loved the burrata, the mussels and truffle mushroom pizza. And for that, I'll continue to come back. Glad that from my move from California, I found such an amazing restaurant. Comfort food and amazing taste."], ["Rich M.", "Upon a recently trip to downtown Denver, CO for a conference, I jumped on Yelp for a restaurant recommendation and based on reviews, I ended up at Osteria Marco. \u00a0Several of the reviewers said that it was a cozy, comfortable place with good italian/american food....so I walked a few blocks and below is an honest overview of my experience.The restaurant is located on a nice, busy street (Larimer Square) with a lot of restaurants, bars and stores. \u00a0It looks a lot like Little Italy in NYC or Philly during the holidays, with rows of lights that are strung over the entire block (see pics from others). One nice thing about the block is most restaurants have outdoor seating, so it's a nice option during this time of year (late Sept/early Oct) to catch a bite, while people- watching.Upon entering the restaurant a few steps off the street, I was greeted by the host who asked if I had a reservation (@6pm). \u00a0I didn't, so she said that I could wait 20 minutes for an outside table, 15 minutes for a booth inside or grab a seat at the bar without a wait, so I chose the bar. \u00a0I proceeded downstairs to the restaurant/bar area and grabbed a seat at a beautiful, spacious bar (@ 20 seats). \u00a0The bar has two TV'S (with sports on each), nice selection of liquors and micro brews (bottled and on tap). \u00a0The bartender was friendly (provided me with a glass of ice water upon introducing himself) and gave me a drink and dinner menu. \u00a0Remembering that others recommended a few food items, I ordered the Burrata \u00a0(appetizer) and Short Rib (main), remembering that their twist on Burrata is \"ricotta\" inside fresh mozzarella, which was intriguing, so I had to try.The Burrata arrived with a few slices of warm, sliced, toasted bread, drizzled with olive oil. \u00a0It was delicious and I really enjoyed spreading the fresh mozz/ricotta filling on the bread. \u00a0That being said, it was overly salty...I mean REALLY salty. \u00a0I thought it was good, but just beware of the saltiness before ordering. \u00a0The Short Rib arrived a few minutes after I finished the Burrata and the overall presentation was nice. \u00a0The short rib was very tender and had a great corn mixture side. \u00a0As tender and delicious as the short rib was, again, it was OVERLY salty. \u00a0In fact, as I finished the meal, I started to feel quessey and couldn't stop drinking water throughout the meal (3 glasses). \u00a0I have eaten in restaurants all over the world and expect my food to be seasoned properly, but the salt used here on both dishes distracted from the quality of both. \u00a0Maybe this is an anomaly, but I owe it to \u00a0you to describe my experience, both good and bad.I think the restaurant is a good choice for a quick bite, maybe for pizza, micro brew or other items. \u00a0If I went back to Denver, I would try another restaurant, but wouldn't hesitate to give it another try...maybe I would have a better experience.Let me know what you think?"], ["Brainard B.", "I've been coming here for years and it's good every time I come in. I'm from out of town and whenever I visit Denver, I always stop here for a nice dinner. This is a great place for dates or hanging out with friends. It's laid back, the service is great, and it's a clean restaurant. They also have a good selection of wines to choose from. All the dishes I had was wonderful. I started with the Burrata Cheese, then I had a spinach salad that had strawberries in them, then ate Margherita Pizza, and finally finished it with the Rotisserie Chicken. \u00a0 \u00a0This restaurant never disappoints me. I'll will always stop here when I visit Denver in the future."], ["Norm J.", "I came here while I was in town for a work meeting and thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience. The service and majority of the food was on point. I would definitely come back here next time I'm in town.What we had:* Calamari = two thumbs down. Never of us liked it. * Prosciutto Pizza = delicious!* Carne Pizza = \u00a0 consisted of meat, meat and more meat (sausage, meatball and pepperoni)! The ricotta cheese on the pizza just made me enjoy this pizza that much more.* Butterscotch Bread Pudding = was heavenly to my taste buds, but not to my waist line."], ["Lauren W.", "Went here with colleagues. Charming restaurant with outdoor seating on Larimer Square, which is lit by strands of lights at night. Downstairs seating area is large and dark paneled.The menu is primarily cheese, charcuterie, gourmet pizza and panini. No pasta. We had a chef selection of cheeses, all of which were wonderful. I had the goat cheese and fig pizza which was delicious, and the butterscotch bread pudding was also outstanding. The pizzas are big enough for 2 to share, which means you could eat affordable at a very good restaurant."], ["Betsie S.", "My husband and I ate here for dinner on a weekday while visiting Denver for a conference. The dark wooden interior is dimly lit and has a pub-like atmosphere. The service was solid and I liked my standard kale salad. My husband wanted to eat here as it was one of the higher rated Italian restaurants in Denver. Let me start off by saying my husband is very, very particular about his pizza, his favorite being New Haven, CT style. \u00a0He grew up in New England where waiting an hour in the winter cold to enjoy Pepe's and Sally's pizza was normal. That being said, he was very unsatisfied with his pizza. He said the crust wasn't crispy or chewy and was a little soggy in the center and the toppings were not flavorful. If you crave good pizza or Italian food in Denver, I highly recommend Panzano's. We ordered room service many times while staying at Hotel Monaco and their pizza was always served hot and crispy, fresh from the oven."], ["Alice G.", "MEH. \u00a0Another restaurant where the music is too loud and the food is overambitious. A group of coworkers hit the joint for lunch and were there a very L O N G time. \u00a01.5 hours.I will give the beet and kale salad a high score- that may have been the best thing that happened to me last week. \u00a0Bright and fresh, the salad was HUGE and scrumptious! \u00a0My co-diners tried the veggie risotto, the scallops, the burrata, the pizzas, the chop salad, the pasta. \u00a0Everything was good, but the meal was not memorable and the basement dining was dark, the music too loud, and it just wont't bring me back when Capitol Grill, Bistro Vendome, and Rioja are all a few steps away...."], ["DJ A.", "At $4 a pint for Happy Hour I think's not! \u00a0The service was on a switch over, so I felt the service levels could have been much better. \u00a0 This was a great place when I was younger, but now I don't see much value in this place over the competition."], ["Melissa P.", "Wow, the service! Horrible all around! There were 3 women at the hostess stand, who were all but completely ignoring me and the two parties ahead of me. It would seem that in person customers should trump telephone calls, and only one of them was on the phone, but they all seemed too pre-occupied to even give that nice, \"I'm sorry, I'll be with you in a moment smile\". Fast forward to finally getting seated. She immediately wanted to take our order, but this was our first time dining at Osteria Marco. We asked for a couple minutes with the menu, and more than 10 minutes later, we had to dramatically flag down the server to place our order, because she had no returned or even glanced in our direction. The chef's plate was the best we'd ever had. I spent two weeks in southern Italy in April, and even so, this was the best we've ever had! That's saying something. The recommendation for the lamb meatball panini was good. I'd asked for the potato salad as my side, but was brought the boring arugula. I tried to mention it to the woman who brought our food, but she turned and was immediately gone, even as I speaking to her. I'm not one to make a scene, and I really don't like complaining, so I stuck with the pile of dressed greens. Not good. We had tickets for a show at the DPAC, and it was taking a very long time to get our bill. Again, it almost seemed as if our server/bartender Ashley was purposefully avoiding eye contact with us, even though we were literally across from her post at the bar. After several attempts to catch her eye, my husband had to wave his hands to get her attention to ask for the check. By this point, we're really running short on time, so I hand her my credit card as soon as she brings the bill. She puts it in her back pocket and walks away. About 7-8 minutes later, she still isn't back, so I stand at the bar to hopefully expedite the process and sign my bill. Ashley makes eye contact with me, but then goes to get a customer who just sat at the bar a menu, THEN goes and delivers a drink to another table, and THEN pulls my credit card out of her back pocket to finally run it!! The audacity! I couldn't not leave a tip, but I only left 10%, which is the lowest I've ever tipped, as well as a note that she should tell management that they need more help (because she clearly couldn't handle things...but I'm actually a nice person, and did not write that last part). It was 1PM on a Saturday. They were NOT that busy to justify such terrible service. The food was really good, and I'd really like to come back to try their dinner some time, but if the service is anything like it was with Miss Ashley, I will never, ever return. I hope to come back to update my review with a positive one some time in the future. But for now, I'm off to try other restaurants."], ["Sara L.", "I went with ten people and we all shared our food family style, every single bite was delicious. The mussels were some of the best I've ever had... the broth they came in was just perfect.This may be my new favorite restaurant."], ["Hannah W.", "My friend and I came here for a spontaneous dinner on a Saturday night. The waitress had told us it would be about an hour wait, so we to walk around the area. About 20 minutes later, we got a call that they had a table for us. Hooray!The place has a nice atmosphere, but still keeping it pretty casual. We ordered the Lobster Fonduta to start. My friend got the lamb meatball Panini and I got the House Sausage Pizza. The lobster fonduta was amazing! The dip was very cheesy and had lots of lobster meat in it. I almost wanted to order another one... I got to try a bite of my friend's Panini and it was definitely decent. The portion of the meat was pretty big and the bread was well-toasted. For my house sausage pizza, I loved the cheese on it. The only thing that I picked out on the pizza was the chili peppers and that's because I can't eat very spicy. They give you a chili infused olive oil to use on the pizza, which is quite nice. I ordered the bread pudding dessert because everyone seems to love it and now I know why. The edges of the bread pudding were crispy but the insides were moist and warm. It is topped with a scoop of ice cream and has butterscotch drizzled over. IT WAS SO GOOD! Be sure to save some stomach space for this amazing dessert!"]], "Panzano": [], "Americatus New-World Italian": []}
