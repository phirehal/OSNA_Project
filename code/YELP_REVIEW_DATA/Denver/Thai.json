Their hot and sour soup was very flavorful. They have lunch specials. I had the shrimp fried rice. Very good and very generous portions so we had some left over to take home. Big pieces of shrimp-yum! My son enjoyed his sushi. Great atmosphere and the waitstaff was very friendly and attentive. Definitely will go back again!"], ["Jen M.", "I come to Denver on business. This is my 3rd or 4th time coming here. It's not convenient to my hotel, but it is worth the 15-20 drive and the struggle to find street parking. I like the environment. Casual place, modern decor, clean restaurant and bathrooms, a TV (for times when the game is on), and good music.I wasn't that hungry, so I ordered the volcano roll. If you are a fan of a creamy warmed up roll with crab, you will enjoy this as much as I did. It is tasty and filling. Also ordered the shrimp shumai which I like since it is not too heavy. I also like the green tea ice cream.If you do order ice cream, be prepared to wait about 10 mins or so - they freeze the ice cream in a powerful freezer apparently and it needs time to let it sit out and soften up.Now the not so good...When I've come here solo, I have noticed the servers are not overly friendly, whereas when I've come in a group or with another person they seemed to be much friendlier. \u00a0I also noticed they told the other tables about the dinner specials, but not me.Being a dessert person, let me talk about a pet peeve of mine which they have a habit of doing here - bringing me the bill before asking me if I want dessert or anything else. A customer should never have to say \"umm, actually I wasn't done\" or \"umm, do you have dessert?\". I wonder how much potential sales they have lost by doing this. When a restaurant brings me the bill and says thank you before I am done eating and/or has not offered dessert, then yes I will be done eating at that point.Overall, I really like this place and look forward to coming back on my next trip to Denver."], ["Kelly R.", "Ordered delivery: Thai Spring Roll w avocado - really tasty and good size.Ahi Tuna Salad - for $9, it's a bit weak. Only 4 very thinly slices of seared ahi. Salad was ok, very small, and they add the dressing to it, so it comes a big soggy.XO Shrimp - this was pretty good. The vegis are diced and I think the dish would have a more substantial feel if they left the asparagus chopped instead. The shrimp is decent in size, but the batter is odd - and left soggy due to the xo sauce.I think this is a restaurant where eating there makes most sense."], ["Mariam H.", "Good spot for a quick lunch. It was not at all busy at 12:30pm today. The lunch menu is rather limited, but you can also order from the full sushi menu. I chose a sushi lunch special. I had about five roll options to choose from. Two rolls for $7.95. Full rolls... A steal! Plus a cup of soup of my choice. I selected the spicy tuna and yummy roll and the miso soup. The yummy roll was unexpectedly delicious. Normally vegetarian rolls don't exactly blow me away, but the sweetness of the sweet potato and avocado were a nice match for the salty, crunchy tempura flakes. I want to make these when I return home! (I know how to roll ya'll, check out YouTube to learn how. The battle is mostly sourcing ingredients. Rest is pretty easy!)I added on a glass of plum wine. A nice full glass. Total spend with tax and tip was about $16. It was a nice leisurely lunch before a pedicure across the street.

We ordered the avocado salad, fried egg rolls, philadelphia roll, and a spicy tuna roll. I really don't know if you can beat these happy hour prices for sushi. My favorite was definitely the avocado salad. It was a bed mix greens tossed in a wasabi soy vinaigrette garnished with fanned avocado and sesame seeds. It was only $4 for a pretty large portion. People rave this to be the best sushi in Denver. It was definitely not my favorite but for the price, it is top notch. The service was also super quick which is always a huge plus for me as we were in a hurry.

Yup, he was adios. I had to flag someone else down to get a water refill and pay our bill. Such a shame because the food was very good. I ordered the seaweed salad for a starter followed by the drunken noodles with shrimp. My friend got the Thai egg rolls followed by a tofu peanut curry. I ate my entire plate. The shrimp was perfectly cooked as well as the noodles. There was also a perfect balance of spicy and salty. My friend also very much enjoyed her dish.

My husband and I had dinner here recently and are sure that we will be adding Sweet Ginger to our go-to list of restaurants. We ordered the sesame chicken, combination fried rice, and an Alaskan roll. While the sushi wasn't anything super outstanding, the other two dishes were awesome.

So I called again, this time she said she's going to call the driver and check, hangs up. I ordered through Yelp/Eat24 so began chatting with them about my order and they have also called and stated the restaurant will have my order delivered to me in the next 10 minutes. A little over 10 minutes later, nothing. At this point I ask the Yelp/Eat24 rep to cancel my order and issue a refund. The restaurant then calls and claims that my order was already delivered?! That the driver called and delivered my order?! The driver never called. I never receive my food. The restaurant obviously had my correct number so what number did the driver have?!

Yeah, I know. It's not something I usually do, but I figured it'd be worth the try. We got our delivery just fine, and we sort of went with a Chinese theme, so I can really only speak to that. The sesame chicken was good, but there was a bit too much breading and it was falling off, same with the orange beef. The hot and sour soup was not spicy and it was too thick. The crab rangoons were really good, but a little on the sweet side for my taste. Everything was pretty good, but not the best. I prefer a different chinese restaurant in the area...but I may order again to try the thai dishes."], ["Holly C.", "I have been a regular customer of Sweet Ginger for years. I like their Thai & Chinese food, although their Vietnamese leaves a lot to be desired. I don't order sushi at \"everything but the kitchen sink\" restaurants, so I can't speak to that.Today I ordered delivery, as they were one of the only restaurants open on the Fourth. I buzzed the delivery guy up and when I opened the door he immediately started railing against me for not answering the phone. I did not receive one call from Sweet Ginger or anyone for that matter; I had no missed calls on my phone. I always keep my phone nearby when I order delivery. Then he claimed he didn't have an apartment number, yet the confirmation email in my inbox confirms I did provide it. And somehow he magically found my apartment while claiming he didn't have a number (and having the ability to buzz me by name, next to which my apartment number is listed). I even apologized if there was any mixup and all he said was \"did you pay?\" in a rude manner. Yes, I paid online... he stormed off. Shame I added the generous tip to my order before I received his terrible service (must suck working on the Fourth, I thought... guess so). I have ordered pickup before and had no problems with rudeness, so SG needs to give this guy the boot.Sweet Ginger has lost my patronage. There is absolutely no justification for such unprovoked rudeness. This isn't Cherry Creek, broseph - don't deliver outside CC if you don't know how to act like a human.

The food arrived much earlier than anticipated, which was great...until I spoke with the driver. I had provided instructions in regards to where to deliver the food; as I live in a carriage house, it can sometimes be difficult to find. The driver called when he arrived but due to his strong accent I was not able to understand where \u00a0he was. He then told me to \"come outside and find him\"; I went outside and ended up walking almost a block down the alley to get my food. My food was incorrect. I called the restaurant and they said they could send me the correct food, but that they were unsure as to when (keep in mind this is after 9pm, so I was already starving). I declined because I was ready to eat; but then as I started eating it became evident the food was undercooked, I sent GrubHub an email and they were excellent in their attempts to assist me. In the end, the restaurant only agreed to refund any money if I returned a full portion of what I had just begun eating-they literally offered to come pick it up from me. If I didn't have a full portion, they would prorate my refund ($2 if I returned only the undercooked potatoes).

Was yelping around for sushi bars around 5pm, so we booked it to get to the restaurant in time. $4 rolls? Can't beat it. Everything was fresh and made with care. We ordered 2 spicy tuna rolls, 1 spicy salmon, a soft shell crab roll, shrimp tempura roll, and Fire Engine Roll. this was a specialty roll made with spicy tuna on the inside, piece of salmon on top along with a slice of jalape\u00f1o, and dollop of sriracha sauce. WHAM. POW. BANG. If you're craving spicy, this sure hits the spot. P.S. Beers are $2 a pop during happy hour also, if you like the basics. The only thing that KINDA sucks is that happy hour only goes until 5:30...who can really make it at that time? I noticed more patrons coming in after happy hour. Maybe they don't want anyone scoring big deals? Oh well, either way I'll return."], ["L B.", "This is one of my favorite affordable lunch spots. The sesame chicken lunch portion is delicious and generous--also seems to be a favorite dish among patrons. The salmon lunch combo is also very good and provides for a lighter meal. I always order a side of chicken coconut soup to start my meal. The service is quick and pleasant.

Wow this was a lot of food for just two of us and we left quite full and satisfied. The way they describe their spice levels because there is no limit was : 10 is a jalape\u00f1o, 20 is a habanero, and 30 is what the Thai girls get. 15 was perfect for me, but they have little pots of dried Thai chili so you can make it spicer at the table if you wish. Although I will say we asked the nice lady behind the bar what her spice level was and she casually said 50. Props to her. That lady made our night! The crispy shrimp dumpling were quite delectable, and perfectly bite sized. The green curry was loaded with veggies and really had a good flavor. And the hot and sour soup was also loaded with veggies and had a nice heat plus a great soup flavor. All in all it was a really good Thai experience AND walking distance from our house!

While different, it didn't disappoint.Our service started off really strong. The girl informed us of their spice scale, which ranges from 0-100! 0-5 is basically zero spice. We started off with the Thai chicken wings which were AMAZING. Best part of the meal. They came out so incredibly fresh and hot.Then, This white girl got the pad Thai at an eight and it was perfectly spicy. The sauce had a nice sweetness to it. It was some decent pad Thai.The boyfriend tried the Panang Curry at an 8 level spice also. We loved the consistency of the broth and the coconut flavor was perfect. Chicken was alright. I would omit the carrots from the dish personally.Lastly, we finished with the Thai custard and sticky rice. I really enjoyed the two together, not so much the custard on its own. It's a unique consistency. The only downside was that our service really lacked towards the end. Our waitress was a little more focused on doing her sidework. I waited for almost 5 minutes for a refill while she rolled silverware): but would definitely still come back!"], ["Lauren M.", "My Fiance and I absolutely love Thai Pot.

Everything food wise was absolutely delightful! We started with the sampler platter that was perfect to try the majority of the appetizer options. We then shared the pad Thai and the green curry, both at the spiciest level they had ( I love a meal with some heat), and although I could have done with more spice, the quality and taste of both entrees were really on point. Some of the better Thai food I have had in quite some time! Now onto the service. Our waitress was very personable and funny but the service was slow, which I blame more on the restaurant being new more than anything else. My only real complaint was the bar and cocktails we ordered. We ordered saki bombs expecting a full thing of saki and a full beer but instead only received a half a cup of beer and a single saki shot. I would have not been upset if we were charged appropriately for the quantity but we were charged 8 dollars for each. Extremely pricey compared to other comparable restaurants. We also ordered a Moscow mule that was watered down and also overpriced. I would recommend sticking to wine or beer with your meal as their cocktail options are not worth it. Again I have to reiterate how great the food was but because of the slower service and poor cocktails I have to give this establishment only 3 stars. I have no doubt in my mind that a couple months down the road, when the establishment has more experience and better organizes the full dining experience they will be a 5 star establishment!

My favorite here is the pad see ewe pan fried noodles, which ever good Thai restaurant should have. The best thing about this place is their spice scale that goes from 1-50! I hate when you go to a Thai restaurant and get their Thai hot and its not spicy at all. I like spicy food and I've ventured to 15 which gave me good sweat during the meal and it was delicious!

When my husband and I moved to Texas for a short stint I missed Thai Pot more than any other restaurant in the city. We've been at least a dozen times since we came back last year, but this time made me rethink my devotion.We were seated by a hostess, who wasn't very cordial but whatever. However, she sat us at a two top and that's normal but to be honest, I had a tiring day at work and I just wanted to relax and spread out a little. My husband asked if we could be moved to a booth for more space and she rolled her eyes and signed heavily saying, \"we are seating the tables by the numbers.\" I would be more understanding if the place was busy, but there were only 4 or 5 tables filled. So we decided that instead of being uncomfortable at a very small table we would go elsewhere. So we went to Silvi's down Colorado Blvd and we were seated where we liked and had a very nice experience!People who work at restaurants should approach their patrons like they all 1) have a backbone and 2) work, or have worked, in the service industry and know that crap is ridiculous."], ["Caitlin B.", "I cannot even begin to tell you how great The food is at this restaurant!

This is a must for authentic homemade Thai food."], ["Noel W.", "First off, the vegetable egg rolls are awesome, particularly when paired w/ the cashew duck sauce they serve it with. I got the Pad Khing, a ginger dish with perfectly cooked vegetables, crunchy, not mushy. You select your spice level so this being my 1st time, I selected level 4 which turned out to be just right although I'll probably try a level 5 next time.

Finally our food came and it was wrong (one dish included beef for avid vegetarians) and one came with rice when we asked for noodles. We waited again for our food with empty wine (and water!) glasses. I mentioned the poor service to a front of house manager and he told me to email someone and there was nothing he would/could do.

I previously said \"Damned good food.\" This time the food was so-so. Not bad, but very far from great. Here is the main point: I found a piece of cotton string about 18 inches long in with my noodles. It took quite a while to get the attention of any wait personnel. When one did come, I indicated the dish and said, \"send this back to the kitchen.\" He took the string and disappeared. The noodle dish sat there. After that he avoided my gaze and didn't reappear until I made a bit of a fuss. From there on in I was treated as if I were some kind of annoyance. The manager appeared and was a bit chilly in her apology. I got a fresh dish of noodles, but the evening was definitely ruined in spirit. AND....a classier joint would have comped the whole meal. This place took the price of the entree off my check. OK, better than nothing.There are better Thai places in the area.

Once we ordered carry out and my boyfriend is allergic to shrimp and it wasnt until we got home did we discover our dumplings were shrimp and not pork. Never had that problem before and have been coming here for a year since we moved. Again, great thai food when the order is correct. So much turn-over though. Familiar voice and face go a long way.

Choppy small pieces of noodles don't scream fresh to me. There were a couple orders of Thai basil or pad kra prow at my table, and it was oddly served without much thai basil.

I got crab rangoons and they were rad.- they have a heat scale of 1 - 5 and up... \u00a0I ordred 7 and it was about my medium. \u00a0I was very happy with that level of heat.- the food is very good and delivered very quickly- my Thai Iced Tea was huge and they offer it with soy milk as well, which is a nice alternative to cream. \u00a0Just sayin...I will definitely return for a nice lunch with my wife soon."], ["Olivia S.", "Discovered this place today after my friend insisted we go here instead of the thai place next door to our office building.

I finally made it back hoping for the same consistency as the last time but it just didnt hit home for me.We walked in and sat at the bar because there was football on the tv. The bartender doubled as a server, and he was friendly and helpful. We ordered some hot sake and the crab wonton appetizer, a staple for me when going out for Thai food. The sake was good for a generic Thai restaurant sake and the wontons were ok too. Our meals then came out fairly quick, a little too quick actually. Still I was excited because it had been a long time since I have had their delicious pineapple curry dish. I let it cool off a little bit and took my first bite. I ordered spice level 4 and was hoping for some oomph and plenty of flavor which it lacked both of. It tasted like coconut milk with a sight spice to it. I still kept eating it because I was starving. My dining companion got the drunken noodles, which is another favorite of mine that lacked flavor. The ambiance is meh. I really liked the other quaint location a lot better. There was music from the kitchen, music in the main dining area, and the football game at the bar all blaring at once. Granted there is a lot more space for seating at this location. All in all, my experience here was meh. I would rather go a little more out of the way for really good Thai food for the same price."], ["Kristy K.", "I always heard great things about Thai Pot Cafe, so I was pretty eager to try out their new location this week. \u00a0Unfortunately, I wasn't too impressed and had a lackluster experience.Panang curry and drunken noodles are my signature dishes I order whenever I get Thai. \u00a0I like to think I have eaten some of the best over the years living in several big cities. \u00a0Unfortunately, the panang curry was the worst I've ever had. \u00a0It was watery and bland. \u00a0There probably were about 6 teeny pieces of chicken in the whole thing. \u00a0I also tried their drunken noodles. \u00a0I preferred this dish over the panang... It was fine. Not much meat in this dish either.

I love Thai food, but not as much as her :P This was the first time eating at this restaurant and I was pretty excited knowing how much of a foodie she was. And she was right!Thai Pot Cafe had the best Pad Thai I'd had recently. I automatically know pad thai is not good when the noodles come in a visible sauce, or is dry from no sauce at all. The mixture has to be right. Thai Pot does that! I got my dish with beef, while she got vegetarian since she couldn't have meat for awhile due to personal obligations. And with Thai food, there is always the option for spicy! The scale when the waiter told me was 0 to infinity. I had not heard of that before, so I had to ask for an explanation. I was always just used to ordering my Pad Thai, \"as spicy as you can make it!\" He told me he loves spicy so told me to try a 30 level. To me, that sounded high, but when eating it, I would say that it was spicy. At the other Thai restaurants, it was always mild, medium, hot and Thai Hot. That level 30 would me more comparable to a medium/hot mix. I still liked it, just was expecting more heat. Might just double the level the next time I come in! lol. The dish overall was just how pad thai should be! \u00a0My favorite dish to order at Thai restaurants and Thai Pot Cafe does it right :) I always order Thai Iced tea with my meals and it came in a big cup.

Instead of my usual CRAB cheese wontons, \u00a0they serve PINEAPPLE cheese wontons. \u00a0Interesting taste and texture, \u00a0but almost made them taste like dessert instead of an appetizer. Additionally, they were a bit on the small side, \u00a0with hardly any filling.The shumai is pretty tasty. Popped those suckers in my mouth, \u00a0and the abundance of well seasoned pork and thin wonton skin made up for the cheese wontons. I took a chance and ordered a Thai dish: green curry. This was flavorful and packed with lots of vegetables and meat. I couldn't tell if there was a way to order it with more spice (if I were so inclined). The lunch portion was the perfect size.Stay away from the egg drop soup. While it has corn (nice addition, a bit more traditional) and an abundance of tofu, it is bland and lacking flavor. Egg drop soup is bland to begin with, \u00a0but it is the places that add more substance that stick out in my mind. The online ordering system on their website was very easy to use. I would recommend it if you're a social outcast like me and don't like talking to live people.This place is worth a try, but I won't be going out of my way to come here."], ["Kay A.", "Delicious sesame chicken!

I ended up waiting outside for my food. shrimp spring rolls: I didn't like how the raw carrots were included. It's a strong taste that overpowered the rest of the spring roll. pad thai: it was drenched in some orangey sauce that didn't taste like a pad thai should taste like. I had a few bites and couldn't finish it since it almost tasted a b it grainy to me. pineapple cheese wontons: this was the only thing I kind of liked. #1 I like pineapples and #2 I like cheese.

Like a spring roll, only you wrap it up yourself with lettuce.

The green beans with tofu were a winner. The tofu had a \u00a0nice flavor and the beans were done perfectly. What didn't work? The fried cat fish was done perfectly, but the panang sauce was rather bland. It was in a separate container and you had to pour it over the fish.I should have ordered spicy instead of moderately spicy. The veggies in the dishes are mostly peppers, onions, and carrots. I would like to see perhaps some mushrooms or sugar snap peas or even broccoli. A variety would help. By the way the veggies were all cooked to perfection.The Massamam pork curry was mostly onions and the pork was chewy. Again, the curries were flavorful but need more fire.

My boyfriend got the chicken pad thai which was much better than the other local restaurants' versions of it we have tried. There was noticeably less saltiness than the places we've tried before and this pad thai, which made it easier to eat and enjoy without feeling swollen or like your tongue was starting to get raw, and made it taste like it was better quality.

Other places serve only the protein part of these dishes, and it's nice to get some veggies, too. The shumai is great. It's a generous portion and a good complement to the meal. Worth a try for sure.A number of the Thai dishes including the Thai Family and the Thai Ginger have an awesome basil and ginger sauce that's different and interesting. We've also tried four of the five curry dishes and they are consistently hits.Pad Thai is a bit of a miss here. As others have noted, it's got a taste and consistency that's hard to describe.

The Hot & Sour soup was just the right hint of sour and spice, and really warmed me up on what was a really cold day yesterday with all the snow. For our entrees, we went with the Pad Thai with Chicken and the Orange Chicken with Fried Rice. The Pad Thai was incredible - not too salty, noodles perfectly cooked, and delicious with a squirt of Sriracha on top (although everything is better with Sriracha, this is true). The Orange Chicken itself was great, but my only complaint was that while it was nice that the veggies and chicken were separated, the veggies had no sauce or seasoning, and so on their own were a bit boring. Mixed in with bits of chicken and fried rice, though, they worked just fine. The Thai Custard with Sticky Rice was the perfect dessert, and reminded me of tapioca, which I love.

Same thing is 3 bucks at the Great Wall down the street. I will surely be bsck to try other things on the menu.

The mood and lighting was bright and clean. This was about 8pm on a sunday, and there were two other couples eating there.We started with crab cheese wontons. They were good. Quite different from what you'd be used to at a Chinese restaurant. They had a much stronger green onion taste. That being said, I quickly polished off all six of them. My fianc\u00e9 got panang curry, and had asked to add a mix of veggies and chicken. The portion they brought out was huge! A bowl of curry, and then a plate with a good serving of rice. I was impressed with how much chicken they included. It was worth all of the $8.99. I ordered the pad thai with tofu. I was amazed by how big the serving was! The noodles were delicious, and there were lots of yummy sprouts! The tofu was delicious, too. We got two dinner entrees, the appetizer, and two sodas, and left for less than $30. I will be very several times a week, with it being so close to my home! I'm anxious to go back and try the Thai tea. I've heard people rave about it, but have never tried it.

The noodles were a neon, fluorescent orange, the sauce was cloyingly sweet and the chicken was tough and overcooked. The portion size was ok, but I couldn't eat more than a quarter of it due to its terribleness.The chicken in peanut sauce was really, really bad. I'm used to a peanut sauce dish where the focus is on simplicity: a good, thick sauce, fresh chicken, and broccoli or spinach, steamed. This was anything but. The chicken, as above, was overcooked and rubbery, but just average. The vegetables ranged between completely raw, large pieces of cabbage, and carrots cut into an star shape that absolutely must have been sitting in a fridge drawer for two or three days. The sauce was probably the worst part, although the vegetables did give it a run for its money. It was thin and almost entirely coconut milk.

After browsing yelp a bit more to see if I should go elsewhere, I decided to try to call again because I already decided I wanted to try their drunken noodles. Order was ready within 10 minutes. The place is pretty empty, so I see why others say it's more of a take out place than a dine-in restaurant. There he was, the guy who answered the phone. Surprisingly awkward-looking and not super friendly. My takeout was already sitting at the register and apparently he was expecting me. Anyway, I was skeptical about my food after leaving there, but I have to say I was pretty impressed.

The flavor of the curry was good but I don't know if I'd order the dish again.I loved the soup they brought out upon arrival! It was just a simple broth with carrots and celery- but there was a distinct delicious flavor that set it apart from just a \"normal\" soup. Props there. We also ordered the summer rolls as an appetizer. I did not care for these at all. They were dry, barely any shrimp, and the peanut sauce was clumpy.

It was pretty early on a Saturday, so this was to be somewhat expected.Service was very good, quick and friendly. The Chang beer special (3 beers for the price of 2) was a great start!The food came, pretty quickly, and was decent. I ordered the Pad Tai with chicken, and had it 'medium' spicy. I'm not sure what 'medium' spicy is to most people, but what came was very mild and tame. I should have gone for the 'very' spicy I suppose. The flavor was good, a bit on the sweet side, which would probably have been masked if I ordered it at the top of the spicy scale.

Hard to believe it's been around for this long and when we came on a Saturday for lunch, there were no other diners! (during the course, two came in and ordered take-outs). So the guy (owner or owner's son? He was in casual clothing so that'd be my guess) that served us was kind of sluggish and dragging his moves. Maybe he was not happy that the day had been so slow? Or maybe he's not crazy about the fact that we came in and broke the peace? I don't know but he wasn't very excited to see us. At least the food made up for it. One interesting thing about Chada Thai's foods is that the look doesn't match up your expectation but the taste exceeds it. Take the Curry Beef Puffs appetizer, I was so disappointed when I saw they were similar to cheese wontons! The word \"puffs\" threw me off, I was expecting pastry type of puffs. But as soon as I bit into them I fell in love. These \"wontons\" have the perfect curry flavor and they taste even better dipped in the sauces provided. You'll long for more immediately after finishing. The Thai Beef salad came next. Again, I was expecting strips of Thai style grilled beef, instead, there were pieces of beef that looked like they could belong to a Beef & Broccoli stirfry dish in any Chinese restaurants. I was not happy until I dug into it. Must be the dressing or something, or the fact that the beef was well marinated. It was a surprisingly refreshing salad! Get it, you won't regret it.Before this, I have yet to find a Pad Thai dish as good as that of Tommy's Thai. But I think Chada Thai's is a very close match. Now that I've had their Pad Thai and got it out of the way, next time if I come, I'll definitely check out the Thai Roasted Chicken!Oh, the only thing that I would not order again is the Thom Yum Gong soup, simply not worth it.

She came to our table and talked to us about all the meals she prepared. Can't wait to go back soon."], ["Tasanee F.", "I think this place isn't my A-number one favorite but it's up there! Maybe it's because I live close by. I have tried most of the thai places around central Denver and this one is one of the better kept secrets. I feel that the dishes are somewhat more authentic so it's worth coming back for. I'm a curry fan, my husband loves the coconut chicken soup and most everyone else loves the pad thai. I feel that all of the regular standby dishes are good. Pad thai can be either too sweet or too oily but Chada Thai's dish is neither, it's just fine. The pad prik king is wonderful and the pad kra pow is lovely too.Some of the drawbacks: The customer service isn't the friendliest. Usually you go into any thai restaurant and they are full of smiles and you feel welcome. When you deal with the guy behind the counter at Chada Thai you get a sense that he's just there for a paycheck or if he's family then he's there out of obligation. The portions aren't that big. Maybe it's because it's so good you want more and more and more. And maybe we're all just a bunch of fat Americans who think bigger is better. I would have liked a bigger portion for the money but I don't feel cheated so I guess that's ok.They don't deliver. I think if they would deliver we may be ordering from them 2-3 times a week! But since we are lazy (fat Americans) we order take out just every now and then. Either way, eat in or order out. Chada Thai will not disappoint. Now if you want REALLY great thai food make a trek all the way over to US Thai Cafe at 26th & Sheridan. It's worth every penny!"], ["Jan v.", "About as good as Thai gets in Denver unfortunately.

The boyfriend and I both loved it.The Pad Thai was phenomenal, but not a very generous portion for the price. I had the shrimp and pineapple dish from the end of the menu, and was disappointed. It was overcooked shrimp and canned pineapple with little to no spice.

I had the pineapple shrimp curry - chunks of sweet pineapple and 4 tasty shrimp - and really, with so few of the headlining ingredient, they should rename it Pineapple Curry Soup and just have the shrimp be a fun surprise. This is served medium or hot, and since I'm a mild kinda gal, I opted for the medium which was not spicy at all. \u00a0The table had a few pad thai's (which smelled really good), a panang curry chicken and 4 desserts (really liked the sticky rice) - but we all were still hungry. Maybe if I had more rice to pour the non-soup over, or we ordered some apps, we would have been satiated.I've normally sat outside which makes for good people-watching and I like much better than the cramped interior and the service could be better - we were rushed to order, than ignored once we had our food."], ["Lisette M.", "The entrance to this place is so small, we almost missed it.After a few drinks at The Thin Man, we needed something to eat before driving home. \u00a0We walked in just to look at the menu. \u00a0A bowl of soup for $10.50? \u00a0Really?But, as I looked at the rest of the menu, I saw that all of the entrees were about the same price. \u00a0We ended up staying and each ordered the same thing. \u00a0I don't remember what it was called, but they gladly substituted squid instead of shrimp for mine. \u00a0I love squid.In the back of my tipsy little mind, I was hoping beyond hope that it would come close to the dish I had at the noodle restaurant next to the poker room at the Venetian in Vegas.It was at least as good and half the price.The squid was firm but tender. \u00a0The basil and garlic flavors were divine. \u00a0The veggies were mostly perfectly al dente (the carrots were slightly more cooked than I prefer). \u00a0There were bell peppers even though the menu didn't mention it, but they were easily removed.The mild really is mild, unlike at most authentic Thai places. \u00a0I'm completely okay with this because I'm a wuss, but keep that in mind if you're used to places that have the spiciness scale with 'Thai hot' at one end and 'still pretty dang hot' at the other.We didn't have anything else because we were broke and full, but I'd like to go back and try some appetizers and desserts.Regardless of how good or bad anything else there is, I'll be back for the noodles. \u00a0It reminds me better days--grinding it out at the best poker tables in Vegas with free drinks, hot waitresses, and rooms with a view of all that glitters."], ["Christina B.", "I ordered Pud Ka Prow. \u00a0I was told that mild contained NO SPICE at all so opted for a light medium. \u00a0It was so dry- no sauce at all, that I was searching for something to help in swallowing. \u00a0I questioned the wait person , was it always so dry? \u00a0She asked if I wanted soy sauce -Really? \u00a0Spice- well the light medium can sear your taste buds. \u00a0I do eat thai food all the time, I have reviewed in Yelp on 2 other thai restaraunts that got huge big 5 stars.Argh.....nothing about our lunch was fun, good or redeeming. \u00a0Won't make that mistake again."], ["Katie L.", "Came here after the Elite event at Breathe the other night.

Sunday afternoon was totally lovely, so perfect for sitting on the patio and soaking up the last of the rays. I would definitely recommend sitting outside! The Thoum Ka coconut soup was outstanding - thanks to Adam R for sharing his bowl with me. This is a favorite dish of mine, and they executed it perfectly - lots of broth, fresh veggies, and spicy and silky at the same time with nice thin chunks of juicy chicken. I didn't love my dish though, the Phad Ka Prow, partially because the chicken was ground? I'm not fond of that texture in my Thai dishes. Additionally, I found it to be super salty and light on the peppers (one of my favorite parts of the dish.) It's worth another try though, and next time I'll specify that I don't want ground chicken. That would help. I did like the simple interior of the restaurant on my walk through to the restroom (note: the ceiling fan comes on automatically in the ladies and is a bit like a jet engine), the staff was friendly, and I will likely be back to sample a few more dishes before making final judgment."], ["David S.", "What I like about Chada Thai:- the phad thai- the curry puff appetizer- there's never a waitWhat I don't like about Chada Thai:- nothingI'm still stuck on Tommy's, but I definitely rate this much better than Thai Basil, Spicy Thai, Swing Thai and the others around Park Hill and Capital Hill."], ["Sarah M.", "Dear Chada Thai,I know I haven't seen you for some time now.

I dislike your parking situation- not your fault but Uptown's, I know. I prefer their pad thai (better by a mile) and their other Thai noodley delights. Lastly their tom yum soup is the best thing going.Also, your \"front of the house\" guy can be a little grumpy and not so welcoming, although over the years that seems like part of his charm.

You know how some places are mostly empty and kind of dead? Not this place. It always seems to have the right amount of people. I also love how they make vegetarian eating simple. There is a wide variety of dishes that offer tofu as part of the meat menu (not some special request). We have come to love the Mee Krop in combo with the Thai Curry.

I ordered my signature curry without the sicky-sweet coconut milk, and the waiter gave me a funny look before he explained something to me. He said that the sweetness is usually from the inauthentic nature of most American Thai restaurants, which are owned by Cambodians. He said that they put sugar cane bark in their curries.

I would have liked my dish to be spicier, but they do give you some options for adding spice at the table. The spring rolls were the \"miss.\" They use moo shu wrappers instead of rice paper and the result is just too thick and slightly gummy.The dining room has a nice, warm ambiance and the service is friendly and just quick enough for a good restaurant.

I was in a hurry to get back to work for lunch. I asked for medium, just under hot. I got bland cold pad Thai and enough to feed a munchkin and was even charged more because I asked for shrimp and chicken. On top of that they have no chop stix, I think it was the owner that said they are trying to reduce their footprint and handed me a plastic fork.

My first thought was that this place was wry clean and minimalistic. The decor was very pretty and very minimal so it wasn't too distracting. The space is kind of small and there's people walking around all over the place. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. They all walk around with a friendly smile.When we first received our drinks I was surprised by how large the soft drink glasses were, it's fantastic! I however chose water and was equally surprised how small those glasses are. I found out later it was for water conservation reasons since we are still technically in a drought. So good on them! They do come around every couple a minutes to refill the water glasses though. I never had an empty cup.My friend got a curry which looked delicious. Couldn't try it cause it had nuts on it though.

We decided to go big and try this 5-star rated restaurant to see if it was justified. AND IT WAS!Appeared to be in Denver's Chinatown? With that said, the interior is your standard Asian restaurant, not super fancy/trendy but clean and spacious. The owners Thai and super welcoming and attentive. - Thai Curry Puff appetizer - reminded me of a slightly sweet samosa. The outside shell is super flaky and buttery. Loved it!- Chicken Tom Yum soup (Medium spicy) - SO GOOD. This was what I was craving and it definitely hit the spot. Tangy, lemony and just the right amount of spicy. Big, chewable pieces of chicken, mushroom and onion. I thought it was great and comes with rice. It was a good appetizer and in-betweener because its light and refreshing. Opened my appetite at the beginning and helped me refresh in between after stuffing myself trying different dishes- Chicken Panang Curry - Creamy, peanut-y and coconut-y and also big chewable pieces of chicken and pepper. What I loved about this dish was how generous they were with the ingredients in the actual curry. The proportion of curry sauce to ingredients were on point. I could drench my rice in curry and not run out and eat chicken with every bite. It's definitely shareable as well. - Chicken Pad Thai - I really liked the pad thai. Its pretty peanut-y. Our chicken pad thai came with tofu pieces as well. The flavor is there and the dish isn't greasy. Few things to note- \u00a0they ask about how spicy you want the dishes. I like my food super spicy and the medium built up enough heat for me to be satisfied and still enjoy the meal.

Still warm and the perfect texture when I arrived home. An excellent deal too. They sell out fast.Penang curry with beef: delicious. Ordered this twice. Creamy and spicy. A generous serving of curry sauce, complimented by savory beef and crunchy bell peppers. The fresh Thai basil leaves were a welcome addition to the strong punch of flavor. This inspired my husband to cook Penang curry at home.Fried spring rolls: it's rare to find a local Thai restaurant that offers spring rolls with a satisfying crispy exterior and tasty interior ingredients. Supiva's offer both. I was impressed.Taro puff: like the curry puff, tasty and an excellent deal, but more dessert-like than the curry puff.Pad Thai: the medium was spicier than the typical medium at other Thai restaurants. The tofu was delicious. The bean sprouts tasted fresh. I would have appreciated more egg and lime. Pad Thai woon sen: I usually prefer woon sen to its traditional pad Thai counterpart, but it was too spicy for my tastes here. The clear noodles took on an orange hue that seemed to reflect the large portion of spices used. Not sure that I would order this again here.Yum woon sen: looked great in others' photos, but was disappointing. Could have used more lime juice, more vegetables (especially red onion), and fresher shrimp.In sum, I'd return to Supiva in a heartbeat for their curries and appetizers.

It's Christmas, my wife and I decide we should have Vietnamese food since we're driving down South Federal after visiting with family. The Vietnamese place's parking lot is totally full. I spot Supiva Thai Food across the street and we decide Thai sounds really great and there's parking! I couldn't be happier we ended up here. There was an authenticity to the food here I've never tasted before. The Panang curry I've had before was a dish with similar flavors, but this took it to a much deeper more complex level that I've ever had. I ordered it with fish and it wasn't just some flakes of fish, no, this was a fish fillet sliced into strips and pan sauteed to crisp it up before being added to the lovely curry and vegetables. My wife ordered the green curry with chicken, which I've never tried, and it was also a joy to the palate, with wedges of fresh green figs. Needless to say, I will be back. even though I live 145 blocks north. I want to try everything on the menu so I can see what I've been missing from the other times I've had Thai food."], ["Ann G.", "This restaurant was a pleasant surprise! The restaurant our group was looking for turned out to be closed, so we drove down the street to try out Suvipa's. We were not disappointed. The chicken satay was delicious and so was the peanut dipping sauce. I ordered the spicy beef with kaffir lime leaves as my dinner and it really was spicy and very, very good. Atmosphere is about what you'd expect from the area / strip mall it's in, but the food is worth it. Reasonably priced, good service. Definitely worth a try."], ["Jenny C.", "Authentic Thai food! Hands down the best Thai restaurant in Colorado. Everything we ordered was so delicious. From the potato puff(so flavorful), to the chicken pad Thai (the perfect balance between sweet ,salty and sour).

I had my husband drive us out for a late lunch at another Thai place we'd never been too. Sadly, we found it was closed on Sundays. *Face palm for not checking*I was so depressed, perhaps even inconsolable before being coaxed to settle for Hong Kong BBQ or Star Kitchen, closer to where we live. (Nothing bad on them, I LOVE them. It's just when you want something, sometimes nothing else will do.) We parked and prepared to go inside either Hong Kong BBQ or Star Kitchen when I saw it; \u00a0A beautiful sign across Federal Blvd. \"SUVIPA THAI FOOD\" it read. I could have cried, I was so happy.Naturally, I begged my husband to drive across the street so we could eat there instead. Happily, he agreed.The interior is quaint and comfortable. Pretty standard Thai restaurant decor. Somewhat small inside, so I bet it might be tough to get a table at more standard lunch and dinner hours. I got the Drunken Noodles with shrimp and medium spicy. He got the Green Curry with shrimp and ordered it \"thai hot\". Our food came out reasonably fast and piping hot. I was delighted to see that they use Chinese broccoli, which I love. On the spicy level, I found myself wishing I had ordered mine \"thai hot' as well but the flavor was fantastic enough that I (a 5'4, 125 lb girl) ate the entire damn thing. And I did so want leftovers. I seriously just couldn't stop. My husband got a big kick out of me eating an entire plate of noodles by myself. It was $8.95 by the way. Big portion, lots of shrimp.My husband said he would have liked a little more spiciness as well. His green curry however, was rich and delicious, just sweet enough. They even use little Thai eggplants! (also my favorite! So small! So cute!) \u00a0His curry was $8.50.Service was great too, but we were the only two people in the place at 2:30 on a Sunday during a Broncos game (which was on) so... I'm sure it's great all the time anyways. Our water glasses where never empty and the lady who served us was so sweet and friendly.

Hardly any peanuts either. What a let down. When she brought over the pad thai it looked ok but when I took a bite the only thing I tasted was scrambled eggs . No flavor , no spice, nothing.

Happy Hour price is more like it, but regular price isn't. Our experience overall was pretty good, surprisingly good actually after reading some of the reviews. Our server, Jennifer, was very nice and prompt. She might have forgotten that we ordered a Thai Iced Tea but after we reminded her she brought it right out! First the soup came out pretty quickly, it was the Tom Kha Gai with tofu, a very delicious coconut based soup. I'd have it again and again, matter of fact, that was the highlight of the night!Then our Appetizer Sample Platter came out which included two shrimp rolls, money bags, golden triangle and egg rolls. Don't ever order the egg rolls on their own, nothing impressive. The shrimp rolls were a little more tasty but it was just one grilled shrimp wrapped in fried rice paper! The Money bags are cute but the platter was just full of fried stuff, so after a while, they all tasted the same (as you dip them all in this one bowl of sauce, otherwise the stuff is pretty bland). The best is the Golden Triangle (Ground chicken with water chestnuts, garlic and pepper wrapped in deep fried tortillas), breaded and very tender, full of flavors.We also shared a Chicken Pad Thai, with medium heat because Jennifer told us mild is just not spicy at all. It came out full of color but for some reason the flavor wasn't seeped into the noodles and chicken, more like they were just on top of it so after initially tasting something once you put it in your mouth, the rest is pretty bland. The chicken was quite hard and rubbery. If I ever go back again, I'll try something different than Pad Thai!"], ["Jeff R.", "A solid meh. \u00a0Nice atmosphere. Ordered Pad Prig Kring with tofu.

Walking through the beautiful Downtown Denver with my girlfriend I spot this place from a block away and just had to jump in to check out what they had going. A sign with a list of appetizers for $5 and well drinks for $2.50 lured us into the joint. The time was 2:30pm with a happy hour starting in 30 minutes. We took a seat at the bar and told our waitress that the happy hour prices reeled us in so we're going to wait. She was kind of enough to still take our orders and waited until 3pm to put them in so we can get happy hour prices for our drinks and appetizers. I was eager to watch the US Open (golf) on TV and our waitress let me change the channel for my viewing pleasure. We ordered the calamari and the Bangkok wrap n' roll to start things off. As we waited I observed our surroundings and found to be in a very pleasant establishment. Each table was neatly decorated to perfection. Thai decor was all over the place and made me feel as if Iwere in Thailand. They even had a special seating section for floor seating. (I didn't know sitting on the floor was part of the Thai tradition). So far so good.Then the food came. First, the calamari was more breading than I hoped. I really didn't get the calamari taste. It was rather more of a packaged product. Their sauce was a bit thin for me. I like something that sticks but still has some fluidity to it. As for the wrap n' roll, although messy to eat, was phenomenal. The peanut sauce was perfect and was a great addition to the meal. I even took the side veggies for decoration and ate them with the sauce as if it were a salad.Lunch specials are served until 4pm so I waited until about 10 to the hour to order since the calamari and roll was filling. Since I wanted to compare this place to my favorite Thai restaurant (and favorite restaurant for that matter) in Virginia Beach I ordered my usual, the similar garlic and pepper bowl with beef. As usual I cleaned my plate but I just didn't get that wow factor that I look for when I eat Thai food. When I asked for hot peppers on the side my waitress apologized for not asking if I wanted my meal spicy. Wild Bangkok rice came with my meal but I would have preferred white rice. The food was better than anything I could ever make but the flavor was just lacking that special bam. A different taste would be fine. This particular meal just didn't have any special flavor that left me wanting for me. I'm usually disappointed after each Thai meal because all my food is gone and I want more. For this particular meal I was like, \"Well. That was okay I guess. I suppose I'll have to eat again later tonight...\" Oh and some sort of hot and sour-like soup came with dinner which was decent at best. The taste was a little bland for my liking.Outside of the waitress not asking about making my meal spicy she was an excellent server. To give us happy hour deals 30 minutes before made our stay much more enjoyable. I'll roll deep into the wrap n' rolls again but will probably go blind and point randomly at the menu for what I order. Chances are I'll order something new so I won't hold this place to such a high standard to my normal Thai eating experiences. It's worth another shot for me...

And, she totally hooked us up with the 411 on how to do dinner/drinks on the cheap here.Best Value: Apparently, the best time to go is 3pm, because between 3 and 3:30pm is when lunch and happy hour overlap. So, you can get cheaper entrees and a giant tower of beer for $10. Nice! Eat It: The Pumpkin Soup. Awesome. Eat It: The Seafood Stir Fry. Delicious! It's calamari, white fish, shrimp and mussels. Yum! And, they'll make it as spicy or not spicy as you like. The sauce for the eggrolls is quite good as well. Very spicy.There is a stage here and our server mentioned they do live music on the weekends.

The $10 sampler appetizer was a few out of the box tasting fried selections placed on a huge plate. Very underwhelming. The Pad Thai looked alright but lacked flavor (especially the shrimp). The green curry was actually pretty good. The veggies were fresh and the heat level was doctored by fresh thai chillies. The only problem was it came with brown rice which is good when I'm in the mood for it but not sure about making it the default style of rice. Overall was not impressed with this place."], ["LaTonia W.", "I hate to do this because for some reason, I really like this place but if you've read any of my reviews, I'm always honest. My first time going here was on New Year's Day for dinner. I loved the Pumpkin soup and my hubby loved his Wonton soup but the dinner's were a little on the 'OK' side. This night our waitress, a young Asian girl, was simply awesome. She suggested the Bangkok Mojito, which by the way was delicious (that night). We got a lot of good attention but it was a bit empty in the restaurant that night. The price was right since we use a Groupon.Fast-forwarding to last night. This was the last day to use my second Groupon so eating here for dinner was a must. First we had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated...and that's fine if the rest of the evening hadn't been so aggravating. It was VERY BUSY (all the Groupon users and Restaurant week). Our waitress made it to our table to take our drink orders after we'd been sitting there at least 15 minutes in addition to the 20 we waited to be seated (35 mins). It took her another 10-15 minutes to bring my husband and daughter their drinks and another 5 to bring me my Mojito which was watered down. I sent it back and she brought another one lickedy split! It was spicy from the carbonated water but tasted nothing like the Mojito I had on New Year's Day. About 15 minutes from then, we received our dinner plates. So, immediately I'm thinking, \"Where's the soup & Appetizer!\" She apparently forgot to put the order in or the kitchen staff forgot to make it. We had both the Soups and Appetizers in less than 10 minutes...HOT AND FRESH! We finally had all our food. My husband had the CoCo Salmon and that's all he had was the Salmon because they don't serve White rice for those who don't like Brown rice. I saw sticky rice on the menu but our waitress said that we couldn't have it. I would have paid for it but she was adamant. Anyway, we ordered the Chocolate Torte for dessert. I asked the waitress if this dessert had nuts and she said no. When she brought the slice of GERMAN CHOCOLATE CAKE...NOT A TORTE...my daughter who is allergic to most nuts found a walnut piece in it! I thought she said it had NO NUTS!!!She told us to keep the GERMAN CHOCOLATE CAKE...NOT A TORTE and brought my daughter a slice of plain cheesecake with drizzled chocolate and strawberry or raspberry sauce. I thought the cheesecake was taste-less. The texture was a little thicker than a mousse not thick and dense like a real good slice of New York Cheesecake. This second visit actually deserves 1 star but I'm giving \u00a02 for the New Year's day dinner.Sorry Wild Bangkok. Your decor is nice and the people even seem nice but there's more to dining than those two things.We ended up being at the restaurant nearly 2 1/2 hours and most of it was spent waiting.

I don't know why I thought it'd be anything but tiny, but, it's tiny. Surprise. The family who owns and operates it was very friendly and within a few moments we had ordered- some pan seared dumplings, Thai BBQ chicken for me and Pad Thai for my husband. The potstickers were very delicate- really think the wrappers were handmade which is a nice touch. They aren't Lao Wang but they were a good substitute. My Thai BBQ chicken was a bit of a disappointment, though. It was basically a roast chicken, and the meat had very little discernable flavor besides chicken. The skin was not crisp so I just slid it off to the side, and despite seasoning directly on the meat, it didn't add much flavor. It was also quite dry; i know they don't roast it to order but I think they must overcook it before they get it ready for each individual order. My husband's Pad Thai was definitely not what I'm used to. The flavors were just not what I was expecting; maybe that's a good thing, who knows. He ordered it \"medium\" and it was.....extremely mild. No spice whatsoever. I find that weird for a place I take to be a pretty authentic Thai restaurant. I don't need it to be blow-your-head-off style, but, something is nice. There were some good specials, like $2 beer and $1.5 iced tea. My chicken came with a lot of rice, which largely went uneaten since \"BBQ\" chicken doesn't go with rice in my mind, but it was nice to take home. Unfortunately the food didn't make for good leftovers; the pad thai got very hard and the flavors didn't meld well, and I ended up putting the dry chicken into some wontons so it'd be steamed again and be more moist.

My girlfriend and I are regulars because it's our favorite thai in Denver and we've never been let down. The flavors are great, I order mild plus because medium is just a tad too hot for me (but I'm a wimp). Pad Se Yew is my go-to, as well as the crab rangoons which are the best I've ever had. If I'm extra hungry I order extra noodles on my entree because portion sizes here are not massive but i always leave full and happy. Not to mention how incredibly kind the family is that owns the place, they are friendly and hard working and we gladly drive 15-20 minutes away to eat here rather than Tommys who we live blocks away from (not to mention the 45min carry out and 90 min delivery times for Tommys).

STRIKE 1. 2nd- I had the beef salad. The flavor was just ok. \u00a0But it only had FOUR wilted pieces of lettuce & 6 beef slices for $9. That was a real rip off. \u00a0STRIKE 2.3rd- \u00a0I had the Pad Thai (sooooo disappointing!) It was greasy, had eggs in it ( not tradit Thai) with shrimp (good taste) & scallops (unflavored, frost bitten, fishy, chewy taste) additionally I ordered heat temp of 4 it wasn't even slightly spicy. Pad Thai is a staple in Thai cusine how do u mess that up! ? STRIKE 3!4th & Lastly I ordered the Thai tea.(Surely u can't mess that up right)? \u00a0Nope! It tasted like old tea bags without sugar! STRIKE 4 $27 later I left hungry because I couldn't finish my meal it was gross!Overall the entire meal experience was a waste of money & DEFINITELY NOT GOOD OR REAL THAI FOOD.

I noticed that our waitress was really friendly and made sure that we were enjoying our food, refilled our drinks quickly, etc.I was pleasantly surprised to see that the portions were generous, and found the pad see ewe to have the perfect amount of sauce. We ordered beef for the choice of meat, and the cuts were thick and juicy. Very delicious. As for the red curry, I found that it had too much bamboo shoots, and had to pick them out. Other than that, it was sweet and savory, just right.I really loved that the waitress packs extra rice for your leftover curry. Other places would charge extra, but here they don't.

I could have had a few of these and a salad and called it a day! I ordered my standard chicken pad thai medium spice and the portion size was bonkers--easily enough for two or three meals--that's what I'm talking about! It was really sauce, a little sweet but not too spicy so that was a bummer but that's what hot sauce is for. My boo got the drunken noodles and it was right on point with the perfect balance of basil and spicy.

Let me make one thing clear- \u00a0I make my own Thai food. I'm talkin' hand-ground spices in a mortar and pestle. Masaman with freshly toasted star anise pulped. Green curry with chiles and basil fresh from H-Mart. I know my shit, so my opinion holds some weight here. :)I've been eating Thai Food in Denver for a minute, and my tastes have definitely evolved. Let me just tell you- these people make it like it's supposed to be. I ordered Tom Kee soup, Tod mun fishcakes, and Masaman curry with chicken.I'ma start with the soup: \u00a0perfectly seasoned- at medium spicy it was perfect for my whiteboy sensibilities. Little bit of sweat, but I wasn't diving into the rice to soothe my gullet, either. And let me tell you a little something special about the soup- THEY USE REAL KAFFIR LIME LEAVES IN THEIR SOUPS. If you've never cooked Thai food, you have NO idea what a rare treat this is. Take it from me- Kaffir lime leaves are HARD to come by, even from H-Mart, and these people were using them like it weren't no thang. And then... at the very bottom of the soup, nice little chunks of stewed galnagal. That's not something you find in your neighborhood restaurant. Fershizzle.The tod mun was NICE.Slightly spongy but with a nice crispness on the outside. Great dipping sauce, too- slivers of cucumbers all up in it- you gotsta taste it to believe it.And the curry- let me tell you- it was so good that I had to eat it like a soup. Nice texture, not like the watered-down curries that I've been having lately. Delicious flavor, perfectly proportioned pieces of poultry, and apparently more than a fair bit of alliteration. I'm not kidding when I tell you that I ate it like a soup, just spooning it right into my maw.The people who own this restaurant are really pleasant. We had a nice chat about making curries, and they were very nice to talk to. I'm thoroughly a fan of this place, and I'm looking forward to my next visit!!!"], ["Colleen O.", "I would love to give them a higher rating as they have great food and when you are there to eat it is nice.

If you place an online order through Grubhub for delivery they will call you and tell you that if you want to pick up then its fine but otherwise you have to wait 2 hours for delivery.

Their noodle dishes tend to be way too greasy which somewhat defeats the purpose of healthy thai food. \u00a0What I do like about their food is that many of their dishes have sufficient fresh veggies and adequate amounts of protein. \u00a0The flavor, though, is often times lacking even amongst all the grease. \u00a0Not terrible, not great, therefore, not my habitual Thai food joint."], ["Bonnie S.", "The Panang Curry here is amazing.

Consequently, I really don't have the expertise to recognize the subtleties that I'm sure exist in the world of sushi. This stuff was delicious, just like all the other sushi I have had. I'm either lucky or easy, not sure which. Good service, casual atmosphere, fair pricing. Who could ask for more? To summarize-the fish was fresh and the Sake was hot. So give this place a shot."], ["Alice Q.", "This is a great place to dine at if you're a huge fan of sushi as well as other types of sea food that Jett has to offer to its customers. Firstly, they are very friendly and warm- welcoming. They sat us down in a booth next to a window, and first gave us a nice, ice cold glass of water with strawberries and a lemon on the side to start off with. The appetizers we had chosen some Tempura, and vegetable rolls. The Tempura overall was decent, not the most well made however. We had ordered many rainbow rolls and California rolls. My only downside is the large amount of cucumber and avocado that some of the dishes can actually be included in. I would advise anyone to be careful when ordering, as these dishes can become a little risky due to side effects one may have when eating here. On the other hand, this place is excellent and worth a stop by to visit. For dessert, we had some ice cream and it was very delicious and highly satisfying. I totally recommend this location to anyone as this place is really top notch and friendly. I do advise that parking may be an issue because this area is located in Colfax, so it might be a little difficult to find a parking space in order to enjoy coming to Jett Asian Kitchen & Sushi. Especially if you tend on making a reservation at this restaurant in Colfax."], ["Daniela B.", "A varied menu especially when going in groups where some people may not like sushi.

The one time it was messed up, the server noticed immediately and got us a new one right away. We've come at all hours of the day. Before 4pm and after 8pm is quietest; dinnertime usually has a full house. It's kid friendly, as most things in this 'hood are.

Decided to order a few things: hot & sour soup, drunken noodles w/ tofu, and the ginger stir fry entr\u00e9e. the soup was ok, not hot enough, and also not really enough flavor. It didn't have enough of the sour flavor to it. Not quite right on the \"hot/spicy\" part either. The drunken noodles were....eh. Really disappointing. It did not taste or look like drunken noodles to me. The noodles were wet and the base of the sauce was soy sauce....I don't think that's how they're made a Thai restaurants. It actually tasted like a dish that came out of a Chinese restaurant. And, not sure if I'm completely correct but I have a hunch that the owner is Chinese just based on her accent. The best thing was the ginger stir fry- veggies were fresh, chicken was tender, and the dish had a nice gingery punch. Based on this experience and ordering a few dishes, I feel like I won't return. I wasn't impressed. I like restaurants that do just one type of cuisine because usually they do it much better than places like these that do them all."]]}
