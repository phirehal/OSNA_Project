Loved the muted color palate, all of the windows and the carefully selected fixtures.The food is the very best part. I could go on and on and on and still not do it justice. The gnocchi with short rib was magically delicious. As I ate each little delicate pillow, I willed the dish not to come to an end. The short rib also melted in my mouth....I'm practically salivating writing about it.The squash soup is cleverly served with cream an muesli, which adds a unique and flavorful twist to a typically traditional dish. It was so rich and nutty and felt hearty without being overbearing, like a warm hug from a close friend.I can't even remember the name of our dessert because it was so good I thought I had died when I ate it. Really. It was some sort of pot de creme, and my husband, who is usually content to let me have 3/4 of our dessert (one of the many reasons I married him) practically fought me for the last bite. On my birthday, no less.I'd tried to make a reservation for Mercantile in June for our anniversary, but found it impossible to get in.

It took me a couple of times before I figured out how to let the cash register person know I wanted a drink other than water in pitchers that you pour yourself. And also to know that you can order anything from the pastry or cheese counter even if you are ordering a sandwich or salad at the other cash register.Also, it can be so crowded that you could order your lunch at the register, and then find out that there are no places left to sit! \u00a0In cold weather there are no extra tables outside.

It's crispy anson mills polenta, spicy tomato broth, dried fig and pine nut tapenade. $26. This dish was perfectly executed. The octopus was tender but not too soft. It retained its structure. So that when it arrived on the table it was the best looking octopus! Slightly crunchy outer side and seared tentacle ends. The taste? Clean but very much retained the seafood aspect of it. I love it! The fact that it wasn't stripped of it's taste made this dish a cut above the rest. I needed something equally outstanding to accompany my pretty octopi. Scotch for a cold night. I don't smoke, but the main star in this drink was Monkey Shoulder Scotch. Perfect hint of smoky aroma and oh so silky. A while back I tried this particular scotch and was caught off guard by it's unique blend of three malts. Add to this Mercantile's own addition of de maguey Vidal Mezcal, velenost vistol, martini amaro bass and, apricot brandy and black walnut bitters.

The plate included two good size servings and included a nice watercress salad, a sweet onion marmalade, some blue cheese crumbles and bits of spiced poached pear. Nice presentation and flavors in an ample serving. For entrees, my husband had the seared scallops and I had the duck breast. We both enjoyed our choices, and I especially enjoyed the tenderness and quality of the duck, as tender as can be. Each of our plates had one slightly unusual component from the mix of side features, which though tasty, seemed less traditional than we were expecting. My \u00a0favorite on my plate was the apple quinoa. Very ample portions with both entrees. For dessert, my husband had the macaroon plate which was actually an assemblage of the macaroon, nuts, mango and some other little touches.

Writing this review after my third dining experience at Mercantile, I feel I am properly equipped to speak to the quality menu and servers. The restaurant's concept, of with I am sure everyone is familiar, is an open style layout with a wrap around bar in the middle serving delicious cocktails and coffee. The kitchen also opens up into the 'market' style eatery allowing for everyone to see to action in the kitchen. Along the walls, the Fruition Farms provisions are for sale. Everything from cured meats to cheeses. Though the aesthetics of the eatery really appeal to me, I'd have to say I love the good even more. The charcuterie (or provision plate) is, without fail, one of the best vid ever had. They load it up with all the essentials, and embellishments, like interesting jellies, jardini\u00e8re, preserves to make the flanked shine through even more. This most recent visit, I thoroughly enjoyed the cucumber gazpacho (so fresh and crisp - perfect for a summer evening. And topped with puffed grain crumble and a delicious sheep cheese) and the Bucatini pasta. The noodles were perfectly cooked and obviously made in house as they were thick and hearty and robust with flavor as was the sauce. Our server was enthusiastic in educating us on each dish and made it a mission to make sure we ordered the right thing for us. He even listened to our specific likes and dislikes and carefully suggested various dishes for each of us. He even took the time to walk me through the cocktail list to happily craft a 'mocktail' just for me. It was delicious with mint and ginger.

I trusted my entire experience to the server and asked him for an ounce of 4 different cheeses.

Without a doubt, the highlight of the meal was the Paella, a Spanish rice with veggies, meat, and fresh seafood. This dish has a to be done in the right way, specifically a unique pan (see picture) that needs to be big enough to fit all off the tasty ingredients and allow the proper temperature to reach those ingredients from start to finish, also not forgetting the key ingredient, saffron!

So how did these all break down? Let's discuss...Pan con tumaca: literally tomato bread. While in Barcelona, I had my first taste of this, and fell in love with it. It's so simple: mashed tomatoes with olive oil, spread on a thick piece of lightly toasted bread. Unfortunately, this isn't what I got here. They used extremely thin sliced bread, that was TINY. You get four per order, but even that's not enough. Think the thinnest Italian bread you can find, sliced thinner, and some tomatoes topped on it. Definitely a disappointment. Tortilla Espa\u00f1ola: This was a little different than the version I'm used too which consists of just egg, potato, and onion. That said, it was pretty good! The difference is that they add various veggies to their Spanish omelet. I was pleasantly surprised by this one!Chorizo al Vino: I would call this the star tapas from our order. The red wine sauce was spot on, and turned into a great bread dipping dish, and the chorizo was perfectly cooked, tender, with just the right amount of spice. The sangria was a big let down. There was hardly any fruit in it, and it was WAY watered down. I advise against it! I didn't try the paella, because I'm not into seafood.

I'm pretty sure the gentlemen who seated us and took care of us throughout the evening was the owner or manager or something like that; he seemed very knowledgeable.The main reason we decided to try this restaurant (aside from the fact that it's really close to home and we like tapas) is that their menu online had a whole bunch of things labeled as gluten free (my wife has food allergies, including gluten). We showed up around 7:00 PM on a Saturday night and got a table right away.Obviously, we started with a pitcher of sangria, which was wonderful. For food, we started with a ham plate, a cheese plate and a potato omelette. We had some miscommunication about the ham; we were trying to order their super-fancy high-end ham, but we ended up getting the regular ham. Still tasty, but we were surprised at the generous portion (and later checked the bill and saw that we were charged for the normal ham). We definitely want to go back another time and try the fancy stuff!The cheese plate was yummy; mostly some awesome manchego with some samples of other cheeses on the side. The portion was ridiculously huge for the two of us; we have leftover cheese in our fridge now (not a bad thing!).The potato omelette (called a tortilla, but there was no flour or corn tortilla involved) was amazing. The sauce on the side was some kind of herbed mayo or something, but it was completely unnecessary. Omelet by itself = wonderful.We added on a garlic shrimp dish at the end, which was disappointing.

The decor makes the restaurant cozy and you can almost forget you're dining steps away from an acre of asphalt parking lot. We were presented with an amuse bouche after sitting down...which was unfortunately full of ground beef (well unfortunate for me) and with the low lighting, I didn't realize until I took a bite. It definitely helped our experience that one of our party was a native Spanish speaker and she ordered for all of us. We had a carafe of the red sangria and the white agua d'jerez.

The food is good (even if it's not to my liking I can tell when something is cooked right) but overpriced - this would take it down from five stars to four. \u00a0The service is what took this down to a three star review. \u00a0My water sat empty for more than ten minutes on several occasions while I was eating and while the servers were friendly, that was only when you could get their attention. \u00a0I no kidding sat at my table with my check and my to go boxes for 30 minutes waiting for my server to stop studiously ignoring me while she cleaned the bar area and come take my payment. \u00a0I've never come so close to leaving a restaurant without paying.I ordered a lobster cream soup (delicious), lamb chops (also very good, though the chips that came with them were far too greasy), and a meat and cheese plate that, while good, was hardly worth the $18 price tag. \u00a0Actually, since they were out of the Iberico Ham that night, they substituted it for Serrano Ham and knocked a few bucks off. \u00a0I did not at all like the appetizer they brought out for me - I don't know what it was called, but it basically amounted to chicken soup on a plate with bread.Overall, I think if you're looking for authentic Spanish cuisine you will find it here, but be prepared to pay for it and be prepared for slow service."], ["Gary L.", "I have been here twice in the last two weeks and have been astonished by the taste of the the Spanish cuisine!

We do it true Spanish style and stagger all of our requests in order to enjoy the evening. Our favorites are the Chorizo al Vino (so good Hubs and I sometimes request our own bowls), the croquetas are amazingly creamy and delicious, the Papas Bravas are outstanding. OUTSTANDING. I don't eat a lot of potatoes but the paprika sauce is out of this world. It impressed me so much I tried to replicate it at home! The smokiness is seductive. The mussels are also in this same type of smoky paprika sauce and it makes you want to lick the bowl- throw etiquette out the window! We've also tried the clams and shrimp in garlic sauce which is good.On one night we did the Tapas Sampler which is a pretty decent deal but we didn't love everything we had. The potatoes in aioli are pretty bland and the chicken in paprika was a tad dry. The calamari has a very light breading that is pretty good and tastes fresh. The goat cheese and pepper spread a top the toasted baguette slices is very tasty.To top it all off, it's all reasonably priced. The portions are generous, most bottles of wine are around $30, their beers are $3.50 (that's not happy hour pricing, either!), their house wine is $5- perfect for the area. The servers are all spanish and sometimes it's difficult to communicate but I think that lends to its authenticity. I'm thrilled to have something so tasty down south and we'll keep returning again and again."], ["AL P.", "Nice place very authentic, beautiful mural of Spanish lady.

We have tried many different dishes and can say the food is authentic and yummy. I highly recommend the Ceviche, Aji de Gallina, and Bistec a Lo Pobre. The Chicha drink is pretty good also. I was disappointed with the Papa a La Huancaina and Suspiro. Papa a La Huancaina is an appetizer and although it tasted good, I was expecting a more authentic flavor and was not happy with it. The Suspiro is a dessert and I had it twice at this place: First time it was good but today the cream that sits on top was hard and stale. I think it had been sitting too long and when I brought it up to the waitress, she took it and spoke to the person who made it and came back and told me \"that is how they are.\" She offered to exchange it or I could leave it. I will not order either of those here again. \u00a0 Although they don't have a couple of dishes that you expect a Peruvian restaurant to have, they still have a nice variety. The combination of flavors are great.The service was fine. Nothing spectacular but not bad. We did get enough attention and refills each time we were there. The decor is nice.

It was stuffed with meat, olives and hard boiled egg. It went well with the accompanying fried onions.The lomo saltado was a bit too chewy. I should be leery of anything outside of hamburgers that comes with french fries. If they ask you if you want the green sauce, say yes.

In fact, I woke up this morning, dreaming about the lavender butter with pink sea salt. The rest was...Eh, very so-so, if not a little disappointing.I started with the Spring Salad that was artfully crafted although somewhat difficult to eat due to its construction, and in the end, I found it too frustrating to finish. My entree (Scallops with uni risotto) was below average. The scallops were unevenly cooked - some with overly browned edges, while others looked rather anemic. I was not Gordon Ramsay a'la \"Hell's Kitchen\" pissed, but what a disappointing lack of consistency! I found it unusual that the scallops were served split after cooking and served in an odd number (5), so what happened to the other half of one scallop? The risotto was too firm for my taste, but the real problem for me was that the dish had clearly languished on the pass, solidifying into a rather unappetizing block. *sigh*The service was equally under-par. After receiving our bottles of wine, we sat approximately 15 minutes before our server returned to take our order; during this time, we received no bread, no one checking in, nothing no nada. Overall, that was our service: Sporadic. I will likely return, hoping for a better outcome, but this was indeed a disappointing first visit."], ["Shaun N.", "5 stars isn't enough for Rioja. If there was a way to give more than 5 stars, this place definitely deserves it! The fresh bacon was unbelievably amazing. Perhaps my favorite thing during my dining experience at Rioja, the fresh bacon was so flavorful and just melted in my mouth! The pizza appetizer we had was succulent and just delicious. We had the artichoke tortellini for our entree and it didn't disappoint. All the raves and highlights about the fresh bacon and the artichoke tortellini are on point. Nothing can match its flavor and complexity when it comes to a dish at Rioja! If you are in Denver this is a place to check out!

I could tell they put a lot of effort into each and every one of their dishes just by scheming at the menu online. The feel of this restaurant is very romantic- dim lights and close tables. Almost immediately, I was impressed with this place. First off, they come to the table with a marvelous selection of bread and, trust me, this is not any ordinary stone hard bread. All the bread offered sounds heavenly! After devouring our bread, they brought a complimentary cracker with crab- YUM! I could probably eat 10+ of those little things. For our entrees, I ordered the Hawaiian red sweet crab and my guest ordered the Alaskan halibut. The risotto in my dish made it absolutely perfect and I promise I will never forget it. My guest also loved her dish and said the halibut tasted very fresh! We were so impressed with our food that we just could not pass up dessert. Although it was hard deciding, we settled on the brandy snap cannoli. The orange scented carnaroli rice pudding was an excellent touch to this treat. At the end of the night, we were beyond pleased with this place! It's an absolute must try in Denver!"], ["Megan S.", "I have to say that we were very disappointed in our meal at Rioja. It was a Thursday night and we had a reservation. We were seated within a few minutes of arriving, but service was extremely slow. We waited over 40 minutes for our entrees to arrive after our appetizer course. My husbands chicken was almost inedible due to the amount of salt. My food was generally tasty and prepared well but we were unimpressed.

It was a fun dish to work your way through with fun tasties from prosciutto to a garlicky fennel salad to a house made orange marmalade. So yummy! The desserts were absolutely on point. Don't miss the black and white cheesecake. Black sesame ice cream?! I didn't know what I was getting into but it was truly special. The service was perfect.

So, I was really excited when I learned that our group was having lunch here.We started with a few appetizers:Rioja \"picnic\" - artisan nests, warm pine nut encrusted goat cheese, gorgonzola, olives, fennel salad, orange confit, and almonds. This was a nice starter with quality meats and cheeses. There was a little something that appealed to everyone.Fresh bacon - pork belly, cardamom, curried garbanzo bean pur\u00e9e. This was just as good as it sounds. It was a thick slab of pork belly and the garbanzo bean pur\u00e9e really helped to cut the saltiness of the dish and provide some balance.I'd heard that the pastas were good and a few reviewers raved about the artichoke tortellini. I debated between that and one of the sandwiches, which all sounded delicious. But, I thought \"when will I have artichoke tortellini again?\" so, I went with \u00a0the half portion. The dish was very well seasoned and the homemade pasta was cooked absolutely perfectly. Although the dish was rather tiny, the amount of filling was on point.I enjoyed the pasta with a couple of pieces of their signature bread - the olive loaf and the goat cheese lavender biscuit.The service was excellent, the restaurant was clean and there were two seating areas.

The Source (where the restaurant is located) is a bit outside of downtown, but I really enjoy the space - dirt parking lot that leads into a huge converted warehouse / factory that has a very cool ambiance. It's probably the restaurant with the highest ceilings I've ever eaten in, and outside of the tables and the kitchen, it really does feel like you could still be in a factory (except for the graffiti, perhaps, which is a nice gritty touch to the scene). With it being a beautiful night temperature-wise, all the windows and doors were open, letting a nice, refreshing breeze flow through the restaurant. Our waitress was great, bringing out food out at a relaxed pace and letting us soak in the atmosphere (and our drinks).Speaking of the drinks - you can select from a great assortment of cocktails (The Ambassador was delicious - I drank it so quickly, I wondered if I got a virgin version instead), as well as a few mocktails for those who prefer to keep it light. The beer offerings are also extensive, although I was disappointed (as I was at most Denver spots) at how few local options were on the menu relative to other choices.As for the food - there are a couple entree-sized options at the bottom of the menu, but everything else is pretty much for sharing family-style. We started out with the razor clam ceviche - lots of bright, summery flavors with a hint of Mexican inspiration from the jalapenos, but I was actually slightly disappointed in this dish. The razor clams didn't really stick out flavor-wise, and it felt like I was eating the garnishes more than a clam. Perhaps it's one of those items that is served better grilled (as it would traditionally be done in Spanish cuisine), but we weren't huge fans. Next up, though, were the shrimp and grits, which was fabulously done. I'm not a big eater of this when it's on the brunch menu, but I really liked the Tobasco-infused sauce - it made it a very lively dish while maintaining the same gritty (ha, ha) texture that grits have. Our third course was the wood-grilled salmon - I forget what kind of wood, but the salmon was arguably one of the best I've had. There were strongly-infused flavors and aromas grilled thoroughly into the filet, and it was served under a light blanket of baby greens and over some lima beans. I'd have to say it's probably better than the salmon I had on my recent trip to Seattle (heresy!).We finished off our main courses with two meat dishes: the oak-grilled bone marrow and the oak-smoked wagyu short ribs. While bone marrow is usually one of the most decadent dishes on the menu, I came away disappointed with it in the same manner that I was with the razor clam - the star of the plate (the marrow) was very covered up in the flavors of the garnishes, and I think the oak flavoring inadvertently masked the taste of the marrow. It was still interesting, nonetheless, but it's not the best marrow I've had. The short ribs, meanwhile, were decadently divine - juicy bites that fell apart in your mouth with each bite, with a mix of firm (beets) and creamy (cheese) making each bite a great combination of the succulent and the earthy. You only get three (relatively) small slices, but this is something I would likely order just for myself next time. We finished up with two desserts - the honey lavender panna cotta, which had a light, floral taste to it but had a nice sprinkling of granola / oatmeal on top to give each bite a crunch; and the spring (summer?) strawberries, which I really liked not just because of the deliciousness of the strawberries but for the olive oil-soaked almond cake it was served with, which provided a nice contrast to the sweetness on the rest of the dish.While Acorn wasn't perfect on every count, this is definitely a 5-star experience, and I'll round up what would be my true rating (4.5) as well. Great ambiance, great drinks, a creative menu that delivers on almost all counts - and it's reasonably affordable too (especially to this New Yorker)! Whenever I make it back out here, it's highly likely that Acorn will be on my list of spots to dine at again."], ["Art K.", "What everyone is saying about how great everything tastes is absolutely correct (except the gnocchi's, they were kind of bland). What people are not telling you is how much you have to pay for this great taste!I am not a foodie and don't claim to know what half the things listed were. But... when I spend $95 for two people and have to go to Wendy's because I'm still hungry, it is not the place for me."], ["Meghann P.", "It was a special occasion and we were celebrating! I opted to try something new and different! We were not disappointed! And as you can see by other reviews, this holds true. Service in impeccable! They are attentive, informative, fun, and friendly!!We did a Bryan's Manhatten and an across the Atlantic as cocktails! The across the Atlantic was the definite winner for cocktail! Then started with the Kale and Apple salad, a beautifully savory and crisp chopped salad! The crunch and flavor all amazing! Then we had the tomato braised meatballs and carrot ravioli! It's true what they say, adventure out a bit! The ravioli sounded different, but the flavors were unreal! The meatballs were also a great staple and just all around warm and delicious!! We opted to go with a large plate- the chicken since we wanted to get in some good protein and it was equally divine and large! The flavor on the chicken was awesome and the broccoli rab mashed potatoes had a unique sweetness cutting thru the yummy butteryness (yep, butteryness)! Again just amazing!! We were definitely stuffed! But since it was a special occasion, we opted for the spring strawberry dessert and 2 lattes! This latte is legit and strong! Yum! The strawberrys with lemon olive oil pound cake, and mars spine ice cream was again outstanding! I had no doubt based on other reviews, but so thrilled to be able to try Acorn! I love having unique gems to share with friends and family, and this is on the list for sure!!!Ps. We were so excited with each dish, we forgot to take a lot of photos, but many of them are posted on here already!!"], ["Valery L.", "This place was amazing! The small plate type menu is one of my favorite ways to try lots of different foods. We had the following dishes (2 of us) : - Bruschetta (which was my favorite of the night!!!)- Farmers market salad (which was awesome as well, and I usually hate beets)- Carrot & ricotta ravioli (yummy, but hard to follow those amazing apps)- Squid ink tagliatelle (I was a bit full once this came, but it was really nothing special) - Butterscotch pudding dessert (this was TO DIE for... Make sure you save room! ) While the drinks were too intense in my opinion (very girly palate), the food was great, the service was on point, and the atmosphere was perfect."], ["Nick C.", "With so many great reviews and accolades and having enjoyed Oak at 14th , maybe my expectations were a bit high. We came here on Xmas eve and grabbed a happy hour drink at the bar before our reservation. The happy hour drinks were suitable and at a margin of their regular prices. We also had a pair of cocktails with our meal as we couldn't resist their concoctions on their drink list. \u00a0Perusing the menu, we were enticed by most of the menu and we knew what to expect with the small shared plates concept. We had an array of dishes including the pork belly, the octopus, a mushroom soup(?), mussels, and the delicata squash. Each dish tasted good but nothing besides the octopus really was out of the ordinary. Plating was well executed, ingredient pairing was unique and original, and everything was enjoyable, but I all honesty, it wasn't worth the price tag. I can appreciate the concept of shared plates allowing for the dinner to get a true sense of the restaurant. I also personally enjoy getting to try an array of plates and flavors, however, the plate sizing and quantity served does not constitute the averaged $15 charge/plate. I'm not averse to spending a hefty amount for a good meal, but I just didn't feel as though the food or experience warranted the substantial price tag in relation to some other Denver restaurants. If I can forewarn, I would suggest not going in a ravished state of hunger unless you plan on consuming and paying for the entire menu."], ["Tiffany H.", "Acorn came highly recommended by a handful of people and the venue did not disappoint. I showed up before the dinner menu was available, so I meandered around The Source until I could order a meal. While not traditional, simple and buttery marrow, the Oak Smoked Bone Marrow was a delightful personal twist on the dish. And the Yellowtail Crudo was the perfect balance; lightening up the overall experience. The cocktail selection is stellar and the staff couldn't be more pleasant. I recommend bellying up to the bar to get the scoop on what's best, as the menu changes slightly with the seasonality of ingredients."], ["Cynthia H.", "Amazing food and service. \u00a0Best meal I've had in Denver. \u00a0Everything was creative, delicious, and appropriately sized. \u00a0Cocktails were yummy too.Make a reservation!"], ["Jason G.", "I think four stars is generous actually. \u00a0And I am surprised the reviews are so strong. For the service alone I would give Acorn 5 Stars!!! Seriously excellent service is always a plus and can make all the difference. Here's my thing. The food was just ok... There's so many exceptional restaurants in Denver with creative dishes, and amazing flavors. Sadly for me, this was just a Meh food experience. Truthfully the dishes were bland and needed salt. The risotto may have been one of the worst I've had in a while anywhere...The place is hip, trendy, and has the buzz factor for sure. But if you're looking for some decadent foodie heaven you will have to keep looking! I will try again eventually in hopes of something greater and tastier."], ["Heather W.", "Amazing from start to finish - we were blown away. We went spur of the moment after a wine tasting at IMT.

Service was great, too - Nathan was really helpful with suggestions and very attentive. We can't wait to go back and try dessert as well...it looked amazing but we were so full! A MUST TRY....best since Plimoth. Yum!"], ["Blake H.", "My wife and I were in RINO on a day off and were able to secure a reservation at Acorn for lunch. I visited the Source a few months earlier for coffee and a quick bite and loved the idea of a market in a converted industrial warehouse. Acorn, of course, is constantly listed in the top 50 restaurants in Denver, so we felt lucky getting a reservation for lunch. We split the chicken biscuit and the grilled cheese. Finished the meal in style by downing a fresh donut. I am unqualified to discuss specifically the flavors that we ate, but needless to say, we will be back again and again. The food was that good.

We started with the CDT SUNSET (campari, pimm's, p\u00eache de vigne, sparkling wine, mint, orange, lime) which was a perfect daytime cocktail. \u00a0We ordered the GRILLED BEEF & QUINOA SALAD and the ROCKY MOUNTAIN TROUT with Gnocchi.

Nice wine selections"], ["Brianna B.", "Gozo is a great place to grab a glass of wine and some small plates, or have a romantic cozy dinner. The space feels airy and spacious while maintaining a sense of intimacy. And I loved the decor, both modern and minimal. The wine on tap was very light and clean on the palette, but if you want something particular they have a wide range of wine selections and a few craft cocktails. We sampled some small plates and pizzas between 7 of us girls. My only pain with the menu was how encrypted it felt. Too many terms that felt a little out of reference for the average diner. And I'm pretty familiar with decoding fancy menus! We had to ask for translations on everything.But the food was worth it. We had the warm citrus olives, grilled baby octopus, the fried raviolis, and the shaved brussels sprout salad. All of it was amazing. The food felt light, thoughtful, and well proportioned for tasting. I want piles of that brussels sprout salad. We also had the mushroom pizza and the potato pizza. Both were cheesy, flavorful, and had a great texture and chew. I really enjoyed the smokiness of the mushroom pizza."], ["Morgan F.", "I was in Denver visiting some friends and we decided to go out for the evening. I mentioned that I was getting pretty hungry and some others in our group said the same. They recommended Gozo, and since I love eating tapas in a \"family dinner\" style I was immediately on board.There was a small wait when we showed up so we all went to the bar to order drinks. The bartender was very pretentious so I was glad I wasn't there alone (hence, the four stars instead of five). Usually when I go out to eat alone I sit at the bar but I don't think the experience would have been as good if I had to deal with her the whole time. One of the guys in our group ordered a drink that ended up tasting like an ash tray (several people in the group tasted it and thought the same thing). When it was taken back to the bar, the lady gave so much attitude, talking about how great of a drink it was and how it was an acquired taste. When we mentioned the situation to our waitress once we were at our table, she agreed with us that it was an awful drink. She even guessed exactly which drink it was that we were talking about. The food is amazing. Tapas style, so the dishes are smaller and definitely good for sharing. There were 5 of us splitting dishes. We ended up ordering just the right amount of food. I'll try to remember everything: beet and cheese salad, brussels sprout salad, clams, a dish with an artichoke and some sort of delicious cheese concoction, the meatballs, the pork shoulder dish, and a fennel pizza. It was all amazing. Some things to point out: the artichoke seemed undercooked and we really couldn't get much flesh off the leaves. Whatever the cheese ball concoction was that came with it was amazing, though. The pork shoulder dish with squash risotto was very good, although one in our party felt that the pork tasted as though it'd been frozen for a while. The polenta that came under the meatballs was really good. I didn't think the brussels sprout salad was that amazing, but then, I was expecting something really different. It was a hit with others in our group. Our waitress was very perky and attentive and we didn't have any issues with our service. We even got our table a lot sooner than we expected. It is a little on the pricier side here, but our entire meal, including a second round of drinks, ended up costing $28 per person (we split it evenly 5 ways). That was cheaper than I was expecting and I feel like the price was reasonable given the quality of the food."], ["Liz W.", "I really wanted to like this place, it's in our neighborhood and the interior is really nice. We came for dinner with a small group of friends and all left feeling unimpressed with our food and the service. We had a reservation which they called to confirm several times. We showed up exactly on time for our reservation and then had to wait for over half an hour for our table. Once we were seated we ordered appetizers for the table and I have to say they were delicious! Absolutely the best part of the meal. Once we ordered dinner, we had to wait for a really long time for our food to come out of the kitchen and then one person at our table had to wait an additional ten minutes for their food to come. The food was underwhelming when it did arrive, especially because the appetizers were so good. After we had finished dinner our server brought the check while clearing our plates and didn't mention or offer dessert, it was clearly time for us to vacate the table which was frustrating given the delay in seating us. My quick summary is that I think this place would be great for happy hour or appetizers and drinks but is not worth the money to come for a nice dinner, there are other restaurants in the area with better food and better service at the same price point."], ["Liz F.", "Before this visit I had been here only once for a glass of wine. Didn't feel the need to come back here again until I read the reviews. When I did decide to come here I didn't make a reservation on a Sunday afternoon which luckily worked out. No wait! We arrived only 15 minutes prior to the start of a happy hour. Double lucky! We told the waitress that we would wait for the happy hour. While we waited she brought over complimentary champagne. Cool! We had mussels and a couple apps I can't remember the name. For an entree we had the chorizo pizza. AMAZING! I absolutely love this place and I cannot wait to have another pizza again.

I had the fennel sausage pizza with kale and the beet salad and my friend tried a different pizza and they were both delicious.Also the white sangrias were very refreshing and not too potent -perfect for lunch.Ambience: the place is beautiful hardwood floors, crisp, modern, and clean with beautiful tabletops and garage doors that open and left the fresh air in.

I started with the brussel sprout salad, mainly because of all the rave reviews. Yes, it is super yummy, however, the lemon was a bit overpowering. I'm going to put a disclaimer here that I might be more sensitive to that taste that others. I had the pasta special which was homemade pasta filled with spinach and ricotta. The pasta was a bit tough and the filling just didn't have much flavor-except I could taste the lemon in the sauce. My husband had the salmon which he said was \"o.k.\" The wine by the glass is really reasonably priced-which I appreciate.I have to say the service was outstanding.

Didn't want to be rude, and she was nice, but sorry, I'm here to talk to my friends.2. Plus, following the distracting side conversation, she brought me the wrong pasta dish.3. Server kept telling us what kind of wine to get while we were trying to discuss it among ourselves. (\"Get white!\" to the whole table) It went beyond suggestion, it was bizarre. 4. Server forgot she had already taken my friend's order first, and came back around to her. No sweat. When she re-ordered the mushroom pizza, server said, \"oh, don't get that, your friend ordered that. Get something else and go halfsies!\" She made some suggestions that my polite friend felt a little pressured into. She didn't like the meal she ended up with.5. My carbonara I don't think was actually carbonara, and it was so-so at best.

After a lengthy conversation with the server to confirm what her order was cooked in, everything was all set and seemingly understood (plus why worry about peanut oil at an Italian restaurant? I could be wrong, but...). As we were eating, her throat got scratchy and she started to panic when she realized that she must have eaten peanut oil. Sure enough, the waitress VERY CASUALLY confirmed, she was eating potatoes fried in peanut oil. Her response? \"Well, I told the chef...\"We had to rush to Walgreens and stab her with an Epi Pen.

It was all breading & onions! 3 pieces of calamari for $14.... Hell no. They also forgot the extra sauce. Next we ordered the Spanish Boquerones( anchovies) those never came because our inept waiter forgot. 45 min. later I mentioned them along with the extra sauce I never got with my rigatoni. My friends had the pork shoulder ..... More like pork shoulder salt lick! Kale here, kale there, enough with the kale !The music was painfully loud, the place was filled with 20 & 30 yr. old hipsters. Trendy does not make it tasty, people!

So I have been wanting to check this place out. \u00a0I made reservations (8:30pm on a Friday for 4) because a best friend of mine and her then boyfriend, now fiance, \u00a0were visiting Denver. The night before their arrival he proposed :) So this dinner became something even more special.Ambiance and decor: Kind of loud but the garage doors were open to Broadway. \u00a0This sort of thing does not bother me. \u00a0We really loved that the entire restaurant was shades of white. \u00a0The lights were dim, but because of white walls it wasn't dark and heavy. \u00a0I gazed from wall to wall for quite some time. I really loved the not in your face exposed light bulbs as well. \u00a0To begin: arrived right on time, table was ready to go. \u00a0Seated by a very kind hostess. Upon being seated, I blurted out \"My best friend just got engaged!\" \u00a0She said congratulations etc.. and then said \"This calls for some bubbly!\" \u00a0Hostess took the time to bring us complimentary champagne to toast. \u00a0Awesome way to start the meal. \u00a0Our waitress (wish I remembered her name) was really chill. \u00a0Explained that all items are designed to share. She knew the food menu and drink menu very well. \u00a0We had lots of questions, she was prepared and patient. \u00a0Each plate came out individually, allowing us time to really taste each one individually. \u00a0It allowed for conversation about each dish so let's call that group bonding. \u00a0Perfect succession too, within a couple minutes of finishing one, the next came to our table.Here is the run down of our meals, we could probably just say \"loved it\" for each one:The roasted cauliflower over lentils - Very flavorful. Clean tasting, not overly seasoned, the natural flavors of the ingredients stood out . Digged the roasted cauliflower. Wish that there could have been more. \u00a0Though there was enough for four people to have a couple scoops. Beets over Gorgonzola with hazelnuts - Beets are something new to me. \u00a0Actually I think this is first time I have ever had beets. Everyone else had and they encouraged me to try them. They are great! I love the soft of firm texture. \u00a0I am not a gorgonzola person but I can see how the two would blend well together. \u00a0Light sprinkling of hazelnuts, added a nice texture.Pork meatballs served over polenta - FANTASTIC! Only three per order though. Once again not over seasoned. \u00a0The polenta was great, textured but not gritty. Smooth, warm and delectable. Calamari - I always have to try calamari. \u00a0It is one of my favorite appetizers. \u00a0Light crispy breading with a flavorful not salty seasoning. \u00a0Some of the better calamari I've had in Denver. \u00a0Sliced onions with the same \u00a0breading included. \u00a0I enjoyed those too. Somewhat like gourmet onion rings... ?Tomato, mozzarella and basil pizza - One Yelper said \"go for the fucking pizza\" \u00a0I will agree with this. Not gooey, but rather a little roasted. Clean tasting. I could taste every ingredient. I liked the simple sauce. It was a thinner sauce. \u00a0Wonderful slices \u00a0of mozzarella. \u00a0Wonderful slightly crispy crust with bubbles. Couldn't have asked for a better simple pizza. \u00a0Every pizza comes with a little dish of portioned parmesan, red pepper and roasted oregano. Someone here took a picture of their oregano and called it rotten. It is not rotten. When it is whole leaf, you can see its coloring much better. Some leaves are quite a bit darker than others. This is not abnormal. Especially when it has been exposed to heat and/or dehydrated.Chorizo, scallion, balsamic onion pizza \u00a0- Let's start off by noting that my boyfriend and my friend's fiance ordered the spaghetti and rabbit ragu. \u00a0Server came back to our table to let us know that they were out of rabbit for night. \u00a0I think this says something to having fresh ingredients. \u00a0So she informs us that we can anything on the menu on the house. Cool! Great service! You would think more restaurants would offer service like this, but they don't. \u00a0The boys could have picked another pasta dish but they chose this pizza. \u00a0My friend and I were full at this point, so we didn't eat the chorizo pizza. \u00a0The dudes ate it all. \u00a0I did try a piece of chorizo, pretty standard but what makes a difference is that it wasn't so greasy - as it can often be. \u00a0Drinks aside from beer ...Foxhole chardonnay - good stuff, smooth and dry but not tartWhite Sangria - a different kind of sangria! \u00a0With mint leaves, apples, grapes, a cantaloupe piece maybe? Whatever I loved it! Not overly sweet, very different. Not sure if this could be for everybody, but I do highly recommend it. \u00a0I will order it on my next visit. You should probably order it too. Broadway named something or another cocktail - Boyfriend enjoyedOverall, I can't think of a better experience to celebrate my friend's engagement. \u00a0Everything came together very well!

I'm typically a little skeptical of places that have Groupons, but this place was too cute to pass up! We'd passed by it a lot and loved the quaint little patio and cozy vibe.We went in on a week night and were a little surprised at how few people were there - maybe it was just because it was a week night in somewhat of a family-oriented neighborhood? The decorations were vibrant and awesome and really made me feel like I was in a different country (not that I've visited Peru).My roommate ordered the Tacu Tacu Con Lomo Saltado (lentils, white rice, beef) and I ordered the Camaron Cuzco (shrimp in white wine sauce, white rice, salsa). My food was tasty and I loved the presentation. The shrimp was really flavorful and well-cooked and the red sauce on the rice was SO yummy! \u00a0I will say it was a little saltier than I prefer, but that's pretty standard for a lot of restaurant food. My friend's food was also good - even saved well for the next day's lunch.The servers were very attentive although the food did take a while to come out.

So let me begin with saying I have never been to Cebiche Highlands, but I ordered delivery last night. In hindsight it was a mistake because I am convinced the \"Highlands\" location is the only explanation for their OVER PRICED food. I ordered the anticuchos with chicken, described as: three skewers with choice of meat and fried potatoes, on the menu. To me that sounds like a lot more food than I ended up with. It was more like one skewer worth of meat and three slices of potato. The flavor was nice but on the edge of being over cooked. Not impressed. I also got a side of plantains, which were good but nothing special. At the end of the day DON'T ORDER DELIVERY, its just not worth it. Perhaps I will make a trip up there to experience the atmosphere but probably not."], ["Lana S.", "Meh meh - a meh for each star. While I love Peruvian food by no means I claim to be an expert. Back on the east coast there was a Peruvian cafe I used to frequently visit. I loved the intimate atmosphere, friendly owners and excellent food. My experience at Cebiche Highlands was quite subpar.I will start with the good. The hostess/ waitress was super nice and always smiled. She refilled our drinks fast and checked on us more that our server did. The home made dressing on Ensalada De Plata was really nice. Hm... I guess the good stuff ends here. The not-so-good observations:The atmosphere and the decor were quite off-putting. I couldn't make out which style they were going for. Some parts of the restaurant looked like an old diner from the 70s with outdated tile on the walls. Other sections looked Peruvian with cute little llamas and traditional Peruvian statues and decorations. I absolutely love ceviche, so of course I ordered Ceviche Classico (with flounder and octopus) . The octopus was quite chewy and there was barely any of it at all. I found the amount of lime juice to be extremely high. I know sour taste tolerance varies from person to person. Personally, I can eat a lemon and not cringe even once. I certainly had quite a War Head face going on while trying to finish the dish. My boyfriend had Bisteck a Lo Pobre - dry, tough, and no flavor. Once again, red onions made up 20% of the dish. The restaurant is not cheap at all, especially if you take into consideration the small portions and mediocre food. \u00a0During our visit there seemed to be a decent amount of regulars (I noticed that a lot of visitors knew the staff personally), but for a Friday night in Highlands the place was not packed at all."], ["Luciana F.", "My family is from Peru so I have very high expectations for Peruvian food. I came here with a friend on a 70 degree Denver summer night and we got to comfortably sit outside on the small patio. (only 3 tables avaible for outdoor seating)My friend and I decided to share the yuca a la huancaina, ceviche de pescado and the classic lomo saltado. Surprisingly the Ceviche de pescado was the star of this meal. The fish was fresh and flavored correctly and loyally. \u00a0I would pass on anything with huancaina here. First, the waiter described it as a \"cream cheese\" sauce, which it's not, it is a queso fresco based sauce. Then proceeded to argue with me about how it's to be made. Then, when we received it, the color was not only off (white instead of pale yellow) but so was the consistency, although it didn't taste like cream cheese it definitely did not taste like Peruvian huancaina to my disappointment. The lomo saltado was also flavored well and the rice was cooked the way my grandmother makes it but I would have preferred a higher quality of meat, it was a bit too chewy. \u00a0 Service was slow as well. The restaurant was pretty empty yet we were there for an about an hour and half, which I didn't totally mind, my friend and I were not in a rush but something to keep in mind for future visits."], ["Mark T.", "Nudged by a recent visit, it pleases me greatly to inform you, yes, YOU, about the many sumptuously succulent offerings you can expect to find at that popular Peruvian pleasure palace, Cebiche in the Highlands.Why not get to the heart - beef heart, that is - of the matter by starting with an Anticucho or two? These well-seasoned grilled meat skewers (also available with chicken or beef steak for the more squeamish) will help kick off your meal in a most palatable manner. Another really nice starter is the Papa a la Huancaina, taking fluffly nubbins of potato and drenching them with a sauce consisting (in part) of creamy queso fresco (a bit akin to feta cheese), zingy yellow peppers, and, yes, a few crushed saltines to give the whole thing just that extra bit of body. But then, why on Earth would you visit a place called \"Cebiche\" without tasting the eatery's namesake dishes of spicy citrus-\"cooked\" fish or shellfish? (For a little history lesson, try the soy/sesame sensation \"Nikkei\", a nod to Peru's sizable Japanese population!)Oops, it's time for your main course - hope you didn't pig out too much already! What will it be this evening? Tacu Tacu is a mixture of rice and canary beans fried together with cubed beef steak (and, if you like, supplemented with plantains and a fried egg) - \u00a0mmm, \u00a1que rico! Alternatively, you can avail yourself of a saut\u00e9 of shrimp with white wine, cilantro, and garlic, inspired by the flavors of the southern Peruvian city of Cusco. Another idea for you is veggie-and-egg-packed Chaufa - if I told you that the name comes from the Chinese expression \"chao fan\" meaning \"fried rice\", would that tell you what the main ingredient is? I thought it might. If you prefer long slurpy noodles to rice, try the Tallarin Saltado (again, available with beef or chicken). Yes, Peruvian cuisine is host to a bounty of flavors - visit Cebiche and sample 'em all!"], ["Paula H.", "Just because I adore when a restaurant owner/employee takes the time to tell their story, their history, the ingredients and their origin, and when they start talking, you can see the passion. \u00a0I gave this experience a 4.

I think the only complaint is that he most likely forgot to put our order in(long wait) and then asked us mid-meal if we wanted a pancake lol!!!If you want to confuse me, serve me an appetizer, then while I'm waiting for my food ask me if want a pancake??Anyway, it was good for laughs and we will be back!"], ["Christopher B.", "My one hesitation about coming here was the overall 3.5 star rating. I didn't get a chance to go through the reviews until now. I think some are unwarranted, some are from people who don't understand this cuisine, and some from random bad experiences.Let's just say I am super happy I came here. I'm spoiled from amazing Peruvian food in LA, which was reinforced by my experience in Peru. One of my favorite dishes in Peru was ceviche, which was made super spicy (and I loved spicy). Normally these dishes in the US just lack that kick.During my dining experience here, I ordered the Cebiche Mixto, which was fresh, exploding with flavors, and had a great kick to it. It was one of the best ones I've had and definitely the best in Denver. My friend ordered and shared the Choros A La Chalaca. I didn't see this on other reviews but THE BEST mussels I've ever had! This is absolutely a Top 5 dish for me in all of Denver to this point. It was prepared very similar to ceviche, served in 6 giant spoons (think Pho spoons) and was spicier than my ceviche. The flavor was absolutely out of this world.The waiter was good and on top of things. Everyone had an overall friendly demeanor. I just felt like the atmosphere was lacking just a bit so I couldn't give this place 5 stars but certainly for the food we had it was a 5 star experience. I'll be curious to come back to try some items off the regular menu to see how they compare to my other experiences."], ["Kathy L.", "Cebiche Highlands was a random place I found in Denver and the environment caught my eye because it was like those restaurants in the romantic movies on the corner of the street. Before dining at the place, I decided to look at the reviews on yelp. Overall, the reviews showed a four and half star rating which demonstrates how well presented the restaurant is and \u00a0the food quality. Looking over the customer's review, their opinion showed some trust because they described the pros and cons of the restaurant.  I thought Cebiche Highlands had an environment that felt like you were at home. It had simple decorative painting, there was no music and the only sound you heard was the conversation next to you or the food being made. The place wasn't fancy, it felt like everything was crammed because the bathroom was literally right next to where you ate. The lighting and the windows made a difference because it opened up the room to show it had space and it gave more of a happy aroma because of how bright the place looked and it wasn't so dim and gloomy. There wasn't anything unique about it expect the atmosphere was different. From past experience of a fast pace restaurant where all the servers were busy, the servers here were all calm and they attended to your every need with great manners. They never were over attentive which I liked. They made it comfortable by showing me the menu and explaining what was in the food since it was my first time there. Everyone there were dressed casually, they seemed like people who were looking for a restaurant to eat at and this was the first thing they saw and just decided to eat here. I saw that most of them were there to try out the alcoholic drinks and the seafood because they were Peruvian cuisine. The best quality of the restaurant was the waiter because I didn't need him to come refill my cup and he didn't ask too \u00a0many questions while I was eating. He waited until I was done to come back and ask if I wanted anything else. I ordered the Tallarin Saltado which was a peruvian style linguine with stirred fried chicken, sauteed with red onions, tomatoes, and cilantro (It cost $16). I don't think the portion merited the cost because it salty, it was like eating a tablespoon of salt. They didn't add enough chicken and noodles to balance all the flavors coming from the strong taste of the red onions and the salt. I would compare it to Olive Garden since they consist of pasta and linguine and variety of seafood and other meat entrees. Once the food settled in, I felt disappointed. The food that was served to me because I \u00a0expected so much from it. It was something I expected to be fresh and flavorful and different but it wasn't; it was dry, salty, and they added too much of the red onions which also gave it a sour taste.. But overall the place was great because they gave you a warm welcoming for coming and the servers were nice and mannerful of what you wanted."], ["Jessica N.", "Unfortunate experience at Cebiche. We had a Groupon so we got to try quite a few things. I really enjoyed my wine and think their Latin American offerings in that department are great (I took a picture to save for future shopping). However, this was the only thing I was happy with. We ordered the fish cebiche and the texture really threw us off. Chewy instead of flaky. The citrus flavor was there, but it wasn't enough to support the dish. Our other two entrees were alright, but I ran into a rather hard chunk of cartilage in my beef and my boyfriend found a small bone in his chicken. Our appetites were quickly lost and our leftovers remain sitting in the fridge uneaten. The atmosphere is mixed. There are groups of friends enjoying wine and food, single diners watching sports, and loud families with kids bumping into your chairs (this may have been an experience unique to my visit). Not great for conversing on date night."], ["Jessica T.", "Expectations exceeded!After reading varying reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect coming here. But what I found was delectable food, in a great location with a server who could not have been more awesome.Came here with a friend (and a WeeklyPlus deal!) on Thursday night at 6pm. Walked in, it was just us and one other table. Server was very welcoming. I asked him to tell us a little about the Pisco Sours, and he told us it was difficult to explain and he'd bring us a taste. The tasters were adorable and perfect for selling us on ordering them full-sized! I also tried the Cebiche Punch, which the menu describes as having cinnamon; I assumed it was the same ground cinnamon in the Pisco Sour, but unfortunately it was liquid cinnamon which was overpowering and made it taste too much like a red hot candy...couldn't even finish the drink, though I think it would be a great drink without the liquid cinnamon.We started with the Cebiche de Camarones appetizer- the shrimps were large, tender and sweet. The accompanying onions, potatoes, hominy and the kick of spicy pepper was phenomenal! Most unique and flavor packed ceviche I've ever had. The citrus sauce was so good we stopped short of drinking it with a straw; when we told the waiter that, he told us that pretty soon it would actually be a cocktail offering!We shared 2 entrees: Arroz con Mariscos and Lomo Saltado. The special was the Arroz con Mariscos, and it was amazing! Tender octopus, lots of baby scallops (perfectly cooked), more shrimp and mussels in rice. \u00a0The flavors were complex and delicious; and we loved every bite! The Lomo Saltado was very good as well. Decadent sauce over tender beef, with yummy fries and rice to soak up all the juices.Finished off the meal with Picarones (sweet potato/potato \"doughtnuts\"), and those were good. Not too dense or sweet, with a yummy rum sauce. My only complaint was I didn't realize they have anise seeds in them, and I'm really not a fan of anise (black licorice flavor) so I couldn't eat more than half of one.Service was spectacular, personal and fun when we sat down. \u00a0Shortly after we were served our appetizer, a group of 15 came in, then another 2, then a table for 4, and so on...and the poor waiter was all by himself serving, bartending and bussing tables. He handled it with grace and appropriate contact assuring us he hadn't forgotten about us. Thankfully, we weren't in a hurry and were enjoying our conversation so while it was quite slow, we weren't too concerned. Most importantly the food came out hot, and we enjoyed it immensely.All in all, I WILL be back! So many other great sounding things to try on the menu!"], ["Kristine N.", "The atmosphere is weird. As soon as we walked in, it was pretty awkward. It's a small restaurant, no music so everyone was listening to our conversation, the decor is dated, and the furniture is uncomfortable. The bathroom is also very very awkwardly placed and needs an update.We ordered the calamari to start. It was soggy and chewy. No crisp at all. The tarter sauce was pretty simple. Then deep fried mashed potato was delicious. It was just a huge ball of mashed potatoes, meats, onions, and egg. Then we shared the paella dish which came with three mussels, two shrimp, and some squid. It was gooey and a bit on the sour side. Wasn't horrible but wasn't the best.Came because I found this place on restaurant.com. Probably wouldn't come back.Service is nice but awkward."], ["Tiffany C.", "They serve the worst quality fish available in the US. It's called Swai. Look it up. They must have to buy that because they can't afford better quality. For a seafood and meat dominating restaurant, you would think they would serve something of higher quality. The only thing worth going there for are the Pisco Sours but given the quality of other items, I wonder where the eggs come from. Staff is very nice. Place is pretty clean. However, both times we have been, there was only one other table occupied.Specifics: Ceviche tastes like it has been frozen. Calamari appetizer is bready and soggy. Aji de Gallina is bland at best. Rice is dry. Tallarin Saltado is basically soy sauce soaked noodles."], ["Michelle K.", "My husband, son and I went in for a spontaneous dinner while in the neighborhood. We had seen Cebiche while in passing before and thought it would be fun to check out. The waitstaff were nice and even a little playful with our son, who wanted nothing more than to pet the llama rug in the hallway. My husband ordered the classic flounder and octopus ceviche, which we both felt was tasty. I might have preferred a little more citrus flavor, but it was still well done. My bowl of shrimp chowder was very tasty. I wish it had come with a side of toasted bread to sop up the delicious soup. All in all, I would come back and be excited to sample more of their dishes."], ["Sue G.", "A simple, unassuming place that serves some of the best Peruvian cuisine in Denver. \u00a0I've had the Tacu Tacu a la Pobre on twooccasions, and it is extraordinary how the chef can bring out the subtle flavors of rice mixed with lentils in such a complementary way. \u00a0Their ceviches are good but fairly standard. \u00a0Their lomo saltado is bomb. \u00a0They serve good desserts too, but I wish they had alfajores!"], ["Ryan F.", "Best Peruvian food in Denver. \u00a0Lomo Saltado and the Ceviche de Pescado are must haves. \u00a0Love this place, always a good time."], ["Michelle N.", "Food is really good.

Bad bad mistake coming here!The only star I will give them is the cool server they have. Other than that the food here is garbage for what you pay for.At first I had assume the place have a lot of potential by looking at the menu selections. They have tons of ceviche selections and a good variety of dinner choices, and the server was very nice and helpful. The atmosphere was lacking. They try hard to create a homey feel and it was not at all. I felt like the owners their decor, tables and chairs at goodwill. The chairs is really cheap and old. They will need to be replace it soon or someone will get hurt once it breaks.For the appetizer I figure we should try a Peruvian Ceviche style dish. So we had ordered the Cebiche mixto, a seafood mix with baby octopus, fish, shrimp, and scallop cook in lime juice. It's sounds pretty darn good right? Wrong! The seafood was not fresh, it was horrible. The squid was super tough, no scallops, shrimp was gummy, the fish was too fishy, and the sauce was extremely citrusy. The seafood is just not fresh and it tasted like they left it in the fridge soaking in lime for weeks. I was really disappointed.At this point I was really disappointed with the appetizer, \u00a0but I still have faith in their main meal. My gf had ordered the Lomo Saltado with beef. It sucked. The soggy fries mixed with the very salty beef onions did not worked well. If the fries was a little fresher it would had worked. The rice was garbage. We could not eat the rice because it was so dry. I had ordered the Bisteck A La Podre. Garbage! If they served this at Waffle House, the cook will get fired. The steak was very thin, overly cooked, and very salty. They might as well make beef jerky out it. The eggs was greasy, the rice was super dry, and the plantain was actually alright. I felt like I got ripped off with this place. The food was overly salty, citrusy, low grade quality or old meats, the rice I would not feed my dogs with, and it was too expensive. I have been to many restaurants, and so far this is the worst place I had so far in Denver.Tip to the owners fire the chief!"], ["Alia Z.", "Delicious super spicy ceviche, and husband liked mussels for the first time.

The taste like I said in my summary is quite something. This not Los Cabos poor half ass taste, this is as true as it gets. Remember that peruvian food needs fresh ingredients that are hard to find in the US like any international cuisine and this place manages to do it. My concern and dislike is the size of the portions. I left hungry after a reasonable tab, the pisco sours are american style (soft) but tasty. The cebiche amazing, the papa rellena was also tasty, the pescado a lo macho a work of art, but... I left hungry because the serving size was too gourmet for my taste. Just so you know I'm 6' tall, 185 lbs and not a KFC/Burger King fan ranting about being hungry.

They still make anticuchos apps and they are my fave. Make sure you get the corazon, otherwise, why bother, right? But, if you are anti-corazon (I don't understand this but...), they do make anticuchos of beef or chicken. Since my last review, they have added picarones on a regular basis. Picarones are a fried dough dessert with a syrup/honey dip, very yum! The dip here is a bit thick but still good. Everything else is great here, the food is always consistenly good.

That was enlightening and made me think that the fish was over marinated, thus leading to this texture. The yuca frita was an inconsistent mix of yuca to batter ratio. Again, my last experiences were so much better.The entrees were a step up, but my date and I met some meat issues in both dishes. And the walnut sauce wasn't as smooth and creamy as before.

It's kind of hard to be both those things at once. Way to go, hipster hostess). Our server was great, he just had way too many tables. We got the oyster appetizer, shrimp ceviche, and lomo saltado. The ceviche turned out to just be lime shrimp, which were good but nothing special. I did however really like the fancy corn nuts that they give you to snack on. Those get 5 stars.

Food is bad, service is terrible and place is dirty.As an Ecuadorean that grew up with great ceviche , I was looking forward to having some South American favorites. We ordered the fish ceviche but after 2 bites, I knew I could not eat that dish. The fish was hard and pungent, not what you expect when using high quality fish combined with lime juice, cilantro and hot sauce. My husband ate the rest of my dish but just not to leave it to waste and because he was starving.For main dishes we ordered aji de gallina which was just dreadful and beef with fried egg which was ok, but underwhelming and it is hard to get it wrong...cheap piece of meat pounded until flat, then grilled on lots of oil with a fried egg on top.My husband also ordered a side of fries, but they arrived after we finished our mealService was bad. We waited 15 minutes at the entrance before a waiter noticed us and told us to sit anywhere. After another 20 minutes waiting, we asked for menus, otherwise we would've sat there even longer. The fries arrived after the meal as mentioned, and we had to keep our silverware between dishes...from fish to beef \u00a0without any option. After the bill arrived, we waited another 20 minutes before I called a waiter to take our card so we could pay and get out of there.The place has no atmosphere and the women's bathroom was quite dirty.Our bill came to $50 for 2 entrees, 1 appetizer, 1 order of fries, and 3 bottles of Coors Light.

It looks like a basement man cave and has some really garish lighting. \u00a0Uncomfortable straight-backed chairs.

When the place got truly crazy, some folks appeared from the back to cover seating, turning tables & drink orders. Nay-sayers, give this place another shot. Drink It: The Malbec. I have a weird fascination with Carmenere, so I always order it when available by the glass. It was good, but the Malbec was fabulous! It was earthy with fruit highlights. (Yes, I understand I just said it tastes like dirty fruit, but you wine-ohs know what I'm talkin' about.) And, this place pours real glasses of wine, not those glorified shot glasses on a stem at some other places. These were solid 5oz+ glasses of wine, in a nice big glass so you could really get some nose. I heard sounds of delight around the room with regard to the Pisco Sour & Sangria, as well. Eat It: The Muscles Appetizer. It was heavenly. Six huge, cooked muscles on the half-shell topped with a fab lime juice based salsa. It could have been a main course. Awesome.Eat It: The Garlic Shrimp. The description is a bit deceptive. It says \"creamy sauce\". Nope, it's a fantastic garlic-butter sauce that is so good that if they served it by the glass I would drink it! Incredible.The menu is surprisingly well priced. The priciest item on the menu was under $15. Glasses of wine were $7-9. I absolutely cannot wait until the weather gets warmer and I can bring some friends and enjoy the patio.

It was a lovely night and we sat out on the patio and ordered two cusquenas and I was transported back to peru. All I needed was some festive music and those hosts outside the restaurant guaranteeing passer-bys free pisco sours to dine at their restaurant. Our waiter David was very friendly and eager to make suggestions. He rattled off the specials of the night and we decided on the chicharron de pescado, a lightly battered catfish with the giant corn kernels and limey red onions. We also got the papa rellena, a deep fried mashed potato with meat and egg in it. And of course we had to order the lomo saltado. Like me, I think it's most people's favorite go-to Peruvian dish. Strips of meat with potato (french fries), tomato, onion, and even complete with my pyramid shaped rice (like they serve it at the fancier restaurants in Peru). Too bad the meat was a bit overcooked and chewy. But David did bring us two sauces to try, both really spicy!

It was my first experience at Cebiche. It was 8pm on a Friday night and I decided to grab some to go food from here. Patio was busy, probably five tables inside. I was greeted promptly by a friendly staff member. I said I was getting to go food and I was invited to sit at a table and look over a menu. As someone with 14years plus in the service industry, it didn't take me long to realize that they were extremely short staffed. The two servers/bartenders/bussers/hosts were running around like mad. I could hear other patrons at tables complain about how long food was taking. It took one of the servers 20 minutes to come back and take my to go order. As I waited for my food, I heard the two employees say that they had two call ins that night and apologizing to their tables. \u00a0 I saw five customers get up from their tables and go up to the bar to order drinks/food from the bartender, who were also the servers. My food took and hour and ten minutes to come out. The staff did apologize after 45 minutes about the wait, after I asked how much longer my order was going to be. They comped my Inca Kola, which I appreciated. I knew the staff was doing the best they could, but my blame lands with the owners. I'm sure they knew about the call ins, yet they allowed their staff and business to sink tonight. I could see how harried and how much the staff was trying to \u00a0 make their customers happy, but with only two employees, it was hard to keep things running.

Like the oil was pooling on top off the risotto. Not sure if that is normal but I didn't like eating it and the taste just tasted well like oil. All the seafood in it was good but the taste and feel in my mouth from the oily sauce was not. My husband got the steak with a little pyramid of rice (nice presentation ) and French fries.

The atmosphere is confusing however. \u00a0They have done a very nice job of decorating BUT they played a really loud random mix of music. \u00a0It was all over the map and didn't match the vibe they were trying to portray. \u00a0Also our server was not very educated on the drink specials and menu. \u00a0There were only people at the bar so it was not busy and just was not that impressed. \u00a0By the end things got better and were asked very detailed questions of our meal by, I believe the manager or owner. \u00a0Nice guy! \u00a0I truly enjoyed our meal here and will go back, but suggest the happy hour so you can try more items at a better value."], ["David M.", "With 3 dozen Yelp reviews already logged in, Brazen Neighborhood Eatery currently rates in at a full 5 stars.

And where can I get me some o' those edibles it seems they must have had as a pre-appetizer course?Brazen is a good 4 star restaurant run by really nice folks. Taking its cue from the current trend in restaurant design, the ambience is minimalist: The surfaces all hard, and frankly a bit uncomfortable (they do have pillows on their benches for your back (but that still leaves you sitting on a wooden bench)). The menu mainly focuses around small plates with a limited selection of larger plates meant for sharing as a full dinner. We chose 4 small plates but weren't blown away by any of them. Enjoyed the duck confit the most.Bottom line for Brazen is it's worth hitting up, especially as a new west-side tapas-style restaurant, but I'm bettin' ya a meal there that by Easter it'll be correctly rated as a 4 star spot.

The menu is very nice, the service was good, but the food was average.

They looked delicious. I did have an oyster or two which were very fresh and delicious.The coffee is served in a French press, but unfortunately the coffee was Lukewarm. \u00a0The waiter did replace all three pots on the table, but by then I was finished with my meal.

The patio was clean, nicely lit and very comfortable. The server came off a bit smarmy yet friendly. Strangely reassuring as you could sense his confidence in the unusual menu. He made it a point that we should be comfortable sending a drink back if we don't like it. We did send one back and the only question was what else would you like? No smarmy grimace or snear. Just cheerfully carried it away and came back with wine.For the food... with things like roasted cauliflower and blueberry and snow pea toast we didn't expect we would care for anything too much... I also generally do not like tapas, but we put our best foot forward and coordinated an order with everyone at the table assuming we would hit a drive through before the end of the night for a \"real meal\"Pretty sure our table ordered about everything on the menu... Thank goodness for the tapas!!! It was all freaking excellent!!!On my own I would have never been smart enough to think about peas and blueberries on piece of toast, and the amazing flavor combination that it had imparted. The pimento cheese deviled eggs did not sound like my cup of tea either, but the hint of heat in whatever kind of creamy cheese that was is great! I could eat a dozen of those! The meat balls were meatballs, and although the were the least amazing thing on the table they were still tasty and as good as any I have had! The cauliflower; this veggie is typically something of a bad dream for me. Turns out if you roast it and fix it like they do at Brazen it has the potential to be a better veggie than bacon wrapped asparagus! This is seriously one of those places that changes how you think about and what you see in certain foods. The smores platter is mandatory for dessert, goes way beyond just smores to say the least. Some might say it is a cop out, but I loved that they had Reese's peanut butter cups on the platter. Some things are hard to beat, Reese's is one of them. They go great on smores and looks pretty cool when your eating a peanut better cup with a fork...The coffee was just coffee, but that's exactly how I like it.Worth the drive from anywhere!Cheers!"], ["Steven B.", "thank you chef Carrie and staff at brazen. lovely meal in such a quaint location. great choices on your new menu. nothing but good things to say about your place. all my best....Steve"], ["Ryan H.", "Brazen is my favorite restaurant in Denver - no contest. \u00a0Perfect combination of prompt, attentive and fun/friendly service paired with beautiful food. \u00a0I could eat their blueberry toast everyday - it's a meal in itself. \u00a0Their menu adapts with the season and their cocktails and draft lineup are balanced and well thought. \u00a0Go and enjoy."], ["Derek K.", "I had the worst service in Denver here ordered breakfast there bread muffins were freezer burnt. \u00a0It took me 45 minutest to get my drinks which we received our food before our bloody Mary's.

If you know much about the \"con loroco\" ingredients, you're going to seriously wonder how a restaurant in Denver gets a decent supply of them. I suppose specialty food companies deliver everything now, but it still seems too good to be true. El Chalate's pupusas are fantastic, and in comparison with the local competition, \"Tacos Y Pupusas\", they do everything 90% better. First, you can sit, and get table service. That's an obvious bonus. Second, the menu has a far wider selection of items, even some gringo food, and the prices are way better; compare pupusas at $1.35 at El Chalate, with seriously fabulous and attentive table service, to not sitting and crowding yourself into a tiny booth for $2 pupusas that aren't nearly as good, at Tacos Y Pupusas. The choice should be clear. So I've been to this restaurant twice since June; the first time was a harrowing experience that had nothing at all to do with the amazing service they offer at the restaurant, and everything to do with my kid attempting to run into rush hour traffic on Colfax. After that, both my husband and I shuddered every time we drove by it, because the near-death pass memory was so truly traumatic.

All trauma aside, this was a great trip to great little restaurant.The second time, after having recovered from the first traumatic traffic incident, was magical. We ordered the nachos to truly test the meddle of the place, and they seriously did not disappoint; heaped with beef, beans, cheese and guacamole, they hit the spot for under 5 bucks. This was the first time ever that I have ordered nachos and gotten more toppings than chips. BONUS! Our pupusas, as usual, were hot and savory, filling and delicious, and whatever that San Salvadorean cabbage stuff is, it's for the win. In the end, we got chips and salsa, a big plate of nachos, 5 pupusas, and 3 Jarritos sodas for 16 dollars and some cents. Can you beat that, considering both price and quality?

You will not be disappointed.As this place is about a 5 minute walk from my house, I will return often till my path takes me from East Coldfacts back to the incomparable Pacific Northwest."], ["Jeremy T.", "My coworkers and I went to El Chalate for lunch today. \u00a0Service was pretty lousy, but they were slammed. \u00a0Our food took over 30 minutes to get to the table after it taking about 20 minutes for the waitress to collect our order.However, they still get four stars.The food was delicious. \u00a0I can't imagine how much I would've enjoyed it had I not been in a party of six. \u00a0Or had it come hot from the oven.The combination pupusas (a tasty stuffed El Salvadorian corn cake) and tamales were fantastic. \u00a0South-of-the-border Coke and Jarritos served in a cold bottle washed things down.I recommend going, but be patient. \u00a0And maybe go with a smaller group.And try not to take the head-turn, record-scratch look you get when you walk in personally. \u00a0Maybe it was my purple shirt?"], ["Lisette M.", "I went here last night after reading about it all damn day at work and salivating on the keyboard.I went for the pupusas, and got one of each, but the highlight of my meal was the fried yucca. \u00a0Not the one with little dried fish. \u00a0The yucca itself was like a slightly sweet giant french fry. \u00a0The sauce it was swimming in was perfect. \u00a0Some of the pork chunks were slightly hard and dry. \u00a0I've never had this dish before, so I don't know if that's how they were supposed to be or not. \u00a0Either way, it was incredibly tasty and satisfying.My pupusas were good. \u00a0I didn't get around to the cheese con locoro one until it was getting cold, which (hopefully) did not do it justice. \u00a0I took the rest of it home to reheat and finish today.The refried beans were the biggest disappointment. \u00a0They tasted burned. \u00a0They also tasted BBQ-ed, which is different but okay, and were pretty salty.We weren't charged for any of our drinks, but they run from $1-$1.50. \u00a0I was warned about the horchata but got it anyway. \u00a0It was too sweet and thin and brown to be ideal, but I chugged it anyway.Service was minimal but polite. \u00a0She split our orders on the bill so we didn't have to hunt to find what each of us ordered. \u00a0Take your check up to the register when you're ready to pay.I got out of there for around $9 plus tip, and I had a LOT of food. \u00a0I took it home and still have enough for two more meals. \u00a0I'm definitely a fan.I may be working just down the street from it soon. \u00a0I could be in trouble."], ["Andrew O.", "If there's one thing I miss about eating in Los Angeles (okay so there's a lot of things), it's pupusas. \u00a0Pupuserias were all over in L.A, but here in Denver, you have to do some real hunting. \u00a0If you have no idea what a pupusa is, it's a Salvadoran treat that is basically a really thick corn tortilla made with cheese, beans, pork, or other ingredients. \u00a0It's topped with shredded cabbage and carrots and a thin salsa. \u00a0Oh, and it's delicious. \u00a0After some research my wife found out about El Chalate, and we made the trek out to east Colfax to give it a try. \u00a0What kind of neighborhood is it in? \u00a0The business next door apparently specialized in gold teeth and car stereos. \u00a0That's not a joke (you'll see if you visit). \u00a0There was also a store called \"Compton Mart\", for any L.A. transplants missing the hometown goodness of Compton.But you aren't visiting for the neighborhood ambience, you're coming out here for the rare pupusa treat, and El Chalate delivers. \u00a0The cheese pupusa was an ooey-gooey thick pancake filled with cheese, probably the cheesiest pupusa I've ever had. \u00a0I ordered two but was full after one so I packed the other one up for later.They also had some of my favorite sides, like fried plantains and yucca. \u00a0If you're never had either of these, fried plantains are essentially less-sweet bananas, fried up until the outside is caramelized. \u00a0Fried yucca strips are like a starchier version of potato fries. \u00a0I prefer them with a garlic sauce but they're fine on their own.Everyone seemed to really enjoy their lunch, from plain bean pupusas to the pork-tastic chicharrones version. \u00a0And the best part? \u00a0Lunch for four with a few sodas was $22. \u00a0I'll be back, and who knows, maybe I'll get a gold grill while I'm in the neighborhood."], ["steve c.", "I don't know if people in Denver don't yelp, or if they just don't know good food. At any rate-this restaurant is one that's found rarely. Delicious food, humble accommodations, and a price that makes you think \"ya know, I'd pay 30% more for that-easy!\"I ordered \u00a02 papusas (yep, they're less than a buck and two quarters) and a combo plate (tamale, chicharron burrito, rice, beans) and my total, with tax, came out to barely over $10. Now, after gorging myself, I still have a gargantuan meal of goodness for tomorrow.Ummm, this place is my new favorite in Denver-it mixes top notch food quality with the feeling you've just walked into someone's kitchen at home with value-it truly does not get better than this!"], ["Erika Y.", "First time at a Salvadorian restaurant. It was recommended by my boss, and a bunch of coworkers and I went after work. We got papusas, and they were good! Seating was a bit cramped (it would have been impossible for someone to sit in the seat directly behind me facing the next table), but it was okay because it was only about 4:30 when we got there. Had to look up the words on the menu on my phone. One of my coworkers also got tamale, which he enjoyed. On the food alone, I'd probably give this place a solid 4 stars. But it gets the 5th from the price. Really, really can't beat that value. I'm sure we'll return at some point."], ["Daphne M.", "Tried this place out based on 4 stars. Big mistake. The place was filthy, serves no alcohol and it took ten minutes just to get our waters. They did cover everything with fresh onions and cilantro, but that didn't make up for the bland food."], ["Salvadorian S.", "Best Salvadorian food in Colorado!!! 5 Stars for having authentic Salvadorian food!!! The pupusas, yucca con chicharon, sopa de pollo (chicken soup) amazing & delicious!!!I know they are authentic because I am Salavdorian and let me tell you I have had a lot of Salvadorian food in my life. When I go an eat here or I order to take out the food is always delicious, fresh & very affordable. When I have their food I feel like I am back in my aunts or mom's kitchen where even the curtido is made from scratch. Yummy food.... I can not get enough of their pupusas, neither can my husband or my co-workers \u00a0who are non Salvadorian or non-hispanics. Thank you El Chalate for bringing \u00a0the taste of El Salvador to my house!!!I am a customer for life!!"], ["Kyle H.", "Quite a find on East Colfax. \u00a0Generous portions of good Mexican and El Salvadorean food for low prices. \u00a0I speak basically no Spanish and had no problem at all, though I had to have a few things on the menu translated. \u00a0One star off for not having something available because nobody orders it. \u00a0If you can't serve it, then leave it off the menu. \u00a0I bet they make good chile rellenos too... oh well. \u00a0I went with the vegetarian combo and a queso papusa, both quite good. \u00a0The meal also came with a basket of chips and salsa. \u00a0Quite good and all for less than $7. \u00a0Will definitely be back to try the fried platanos with a glass of horchata.Quite a find in a rather dead and sometimes shady area of Colfax among a number of auto body shops and such."]]}
