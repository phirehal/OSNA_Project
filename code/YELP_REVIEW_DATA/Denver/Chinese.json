When she asked me if I'd visited Star Kitchen and heard I had not, she was appalled- and would ask me relentlessly until I finally went.Star Kitchen was not a disappointment. There's not much I can add beyond what other reviewers have said- their dim sum is excellent (and inexpensive), they're known for their seafood- which is all fresh and expertly prepared, and food quality is consistent. I've been here more times than I can count, and I've never had a bad meal.Service can be slow, especially on busy nights, but I've never had bad service. Even if I did, I'd probably continue coming back, simply because the food is so good.Once you come here, you may never want to go back to another Chinese restaurant.

Unlike most other Chinese restaurants, the sauces here are not heavy and it's clear that each dish actually has its own sauce. And the spicy dishes aren't just \"hot\" because a bunch of red pepper flakes are dumped in (a big pet peeve of mine). They have actual distinguishable flavors. So far, the mongolian beef is a favorite (the beef is really tender, and the sauce is balanced just right, with a nice peppery finish). The drunken noodles are great too though, and the jalapenos are a nice touch in that dish. Delivery is fast, and the prices are good. I seriously tossed all my other Chinese and Thai delivery menus. This place is it now! An unfortunate side note: steer clear of the egg rolls. Sadly, they're just awful -- all cabbage and absolutely no flavor.

He spoke both broken English and Cantonese so it was kind of difficult to communicate with him. When we requested password for wi-fi, he gave us two random numbers that of course lead to nowhere. What kind of places give out fake wifi passwords?!!?When I inquired about substitutions, he said no, either the restaurant doesn't do it (but it's unconsiderate not to do it to accomadate people with food allergies!) or he refuses because it'll make his job easier! I do not like him!Then came the food, portion wise it was good and the Pan Fried dumplings were probably the only average thing for the night, thus earning the other half star. We also ordered Curry Shrimp and Twice Cooked Pork, both contain some stinky smelling bamboo shoots, making the food taste un-fresh. Talking about freshness, we're Chinese, and it's stupid for them to think they can fool us with some BBQ pork in place of real, twice cooked pork!

Fresh out of the wok, it will steam itself in the to-go container and lose the delectable crispiness which goes so well with the hot sweet sauce. The dish is quite amazing when eaten at the restaurant. You can carry home the leftovers and they will be fine. I usually avoid chow mein, but the chicken chow mein here is tasty, fresh, delicate, and satisfying -- really good for an upset stomach, a picky eater, or the non-adventurous, and it's a real crowd-pleaser.The tofu and vegetable soup is simple, elegant, and delicious, plus you can feel virtuously healthy. It's another dish that's great if your stomach is a little iffy. At dinner we usually order from the entrees that come with soup and egg roll, and we ask for fried rice instead of steamed.

I would have loved some additional Vietnamese selections besides the pho, which was fine but really not great or remarkable.

I am glad that this place opened up and is up to the challenge to fill this void here in this neighborhood. The options are not as varied as you would find at the South Federal joints but they cover the basics. The broth is rich and hits the spot on a cold snowy day. There are other menu items that I have not tried but if you are not in the mood for brothy soup. I will say the people who work they are incredible nice and welcoming.

Their Chinese dishes are excellent, large portions that even I had leftovers to take home (whereas usually I have to order for 1.5).My beef was done perfectly with a great portion that is about double of what you get from elsewhere with same price. Broth was also done just right, not too salty or oily, and definitely not bland retaining a good balance of flavor. One sip and you can feel it's nutritious. The wontons are all shrimp-filled and tastes fresh. Pho 38 has become my go-to default place to dine.The Service:The staff was very impressive in their ability to bring me what I want without me asking. Mr. Peter can read your mind. On my first visit I ordered a bowl of beef and wonton noodle soup. That's all I asked (and was charged) for. Peter brought me some hot sauce from the kitchen, a spoon with it, glass of ice water, chopsticks, complementary egg roll (\"You gotta try our egg roll, here's a free one!\"), and a fork with a large slice of lemon cake (\"I just bought this, have a taste\"). Near the end of my meal before I thought I was finished, he brought a to-go kit with everything necessary, including pouch for cake, even a small sauce container for the spicy sauce.More on the service. Throughout my dining time I heard him speak to various customers as if they're all good friends or regulars. The owner came out to say hi and thank me for my compliments, and we struck up a conversation. I'm definitely coming back not only for the large portion of goodness (at $5 to $8), but for the warm reception. These guys know how to do business the old school way.Every restaurant has to push those soda drinks and I particularly enjoyed the way Peter did it.

My girlfriend and I have had more of their sushi and have to say I'm pleasantly surprised every time with how fresh it is. The rolls often have a few pieces that aren't rolled 100% right, but the freshness makes up for it. The simple cucumber roll is still one of my favs, but the tuna, salmon, and shrimp/cucumber/avocado rolls are all fantastic as well. We are more than happy to have their sushi when we don't feel like driving half way across town for the top sushi places.Although the sushi is nice, it's the steamed shrimp shumai dumplings that is the top draw for us. We get at least an order every time we visit, whether ordering regular dishes or sushi. In fact, one of these days we're just going to order 10 of these as a meal. So tender and moist, and that dipping sauce is like crack!As for regular dishes, we've become addicted to the Mongolian Chicken and the Spicy Basil Chicken. The Mongolian is loaded with flavor including black pepper and perfectly sauteed onions, while the Basil Chicken has the perfect amount of spice with that sharp Asian basil taste. And the portions of both often provide for at least a lunch the next day.Golden Shanghai is definitely our go-to Chinese restaurant, and it has essentially become our comfort food.

I just prefer really good stir-frys in a wok that I can't replicate at home easily."], ["Jamie C.", "The only restaurants of it's kind in Colorado. This restaurant is based on cafes found everywhere in the greater China, especially Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangdong. These places are called Cha Chaan Teng, literally tea restaurant. Here you can find, quick, cheap food, awesome drinks and a western twist. You know they are legit when everyone who works there speaks Cantonese. ;)To start, it is very popular to order Hong Kong style milk tea. I never thought I'd see this anywhere near where I live for a while but bam, of course they have it here! It's known for it's very strong tea flavor and when mixed with condensed milk, makes a creamy, smooth and aromatic drink. This can be served hot or cold.To take it to the next level, you can order something called a Yuan Yuang and that's a mix of coffee and tea. You will need to sweeten this on your own. I found it best with condensed milk.On a hot summer, the drink of choice is simply lemon with water. It's called Ling Mut, Ling stands for the LingMong (Lemon) and Mut standing for Honey. This is usually served cold but can also be served hot.Now onto the food, some must haves for the first time:-Wonton Noodle Soup. They do an awesome job here and if you want to reach the next step of really experiencing the culture, get the egg noodles as lo mein in oyster sauce. This is a unique and fun way to eat it. -Beef Brisket Noodle soup with Ho fun. The beef brisket is sooooo tender and maybe I'm just biased to the whole soup and noodle thing but we live in Colorado! It's a must!-Gon chaau ngau ho, which translates to Stir Fried Beef Flat Rice Noodles or Beef Chow Fun is an all time stir fry noodle favorite. You can actually get this at all the traditional Chinese restaurants like Hong Kong BBQ, New Canton BBQ, Star Kitchen, etc.-Baked Rice/Spaghetti. Here's where the western twist comes in. There are lots of different sauces and different meats you can get with it too. This makes me think about my childhood. I love the black pepper sauce, but fair warning, it's really peppery. I'd start with something simple like the tomato sauce and maybe pork chops.-TOASTTTTTTTTTTTT. This is a must must must must try! There's a list of variations, I'd start with the one with peanut butter, that's the standard or just simply toast and butter with condensed milk.Also, you'll notice that on the menu, they have HK style sandwiches and Instant Ramen for a really cheap price. These are very traditional cafe foods. The HK style sandwiches are mirrored after Western breakfasts, usually consisting of eggs and ham or whatever Western meat they have cooking. Also the instant ramen is not cooked the way packages say, it usually includes some sort of meat, ham or spam or something and eggs. A very homey way and the only way I make my ramen. Enjoy! I know I'll be back and hopefully I'll be lucky and miss the rush."], ["Michael S.", "I love this place for Lunch....Great specials and it's so fast!! I plan on trying the HK style sandwiches, baked spaghetti and the Toast....The only downside is delivery....I will eat -in or choose take-out from now on....just saying....."], ["Claudine M.", "I haven't eaten a lot of Hong Kong style food. But it was blown away on how good this place was! The restaurant itself is clean and can get busy during lunch hours and such. The staff is super nice as well! For the food, my friend and I tried the HK milk tea, flat noodles with brisket, salt and pepper tofu and salt and pepper chicken wings. The milk tea was delicious. Just the right amount of sweetness and great tea flavor (you can tell they brew/seep it and not just use powder). The noodles were great, I love the prices of brisket, so tender and they remove most of the fat as well! Makes me feel better haha. The tofu was oh my goodness, one of my favorites. Crispy and not oily with awesome flavor accompanied with chopped peppers. The wings were nicely cooked and seasoned too. I was surprised on how good everything was actually, and I love how it seems like it was cooked healthier than other places.I can't wait to try more of their food! :)"], ["Anna Z.", "Moving from California to Denver for school, one thing that was starkingly lacking was good Chinese food. Colorado generally has decent Vietnamese and Korean food but I've only ran into a handful of good Chinese restaurants and most of them are dim sum or Szechuan. Therefore, I was soooo excited to see the grand opening of Hong Kong Cafe on Yelp. I immediately bookmarked it.I finally had the chance of trying this place out with my friend today for lunch. When we arrived, there were only 2 other parties but soon after, the entire place filled up and there were alot of people getting take out as well. The owners were very friendly and were able to speak Mandarin which is rare in Colorado. I ordered the Hong Kong Milk Tea which definitely has a unique taste that is very different from your usual Taiwanese milk teas. It's almost like an acquired taste at first but I absolutely loved it here. I got it iced and it was a very decently huge portion. My friend and I shared the flat noodle with brisket and black bean sauce, the fried tofu, and the black pepper and salt chicken wings. The total came out to ~$40 but we had a lot of left overs and were very satisfied.The noodles were perfectly seasoned, had just the right amount of sauce. It could have been spicier tho. The meat might look weird at least and kind of life tofu but they were so tender. The tofu was delicious! They were perfectly square, cripsy on the outside and delicate on the inside. I have no idea how they cooked it. I also loved how they sauteed it in hot red and green peppers which were delicious. It was supposed to come with either steamed rice or fried rice but they forgot to give it to us. It was fine bcuz we were stuffed by the end. The chicken wings were so cripsy and delicious as well! The service was great and they call everyone hun or honey and really try to get to know their customers. They're going to have great buisness because nowhere else in colorado can compete with their type of food. Finally an authentic Chinese place here and I am so happy!!!1"], ["Saydee X.", "My sister has been to this Restuarant before and said it was okay. But I decided to wanted to try since there's not much Hong Kong type of cafes in Colorado. Since I was in the area why not right?The Restuarant is located in a small plaza next to a few other shops. It is a pretty small Resturant maybe with about 8 tables. The decor is pretty nice and simple, gives a very fresh and relaxing feel to it. The walls are a lavender color. It kind of reminded me of Chinese \u00a0cafes in LA. We ordered the Hong Kong style milk tea, fried calamari, wonton noodle soup, and the beef brisket noodle soup. The Milk tea was okay, definitely not the best I've had maybe because I'm comparing it to LA quality. The fried calamari was average, it came with a spicy mayo sauce which is a good combination. Wonton noodles was actually pretty good. The wontons was a shrimp filling and it was really good! I think the noodles wasn't that great, if only they would put fresh egg noodles in it, it would be amazing!! Same thing with the beef brisket noodle soup, the dish would be better with fresh noodles. Beef brisket was on point, it just melts in your mouth. Overall I give it a 4 star because this is the closest thus far to LA quality Chinese food in Colorado. I guess this place will do for now until Denver slowly gets more and more diverse in the food market! I would come back!"], ["Charmaine K.", "It's 12:30 am and why am I writing this review instead of sleeping? Because I do not want to waste any time telling everyone how great this place is. This place makes me feel glad that I live where I'm at because of how close it is to the restaurant. Sounds crazy, I know but I'm bias. Being born and raised in Hong Kong, I've have always missed the Hong Kong style cafe in the US. Even living in Hawaii with a large Asian population, I had not found a place comparable to this. Let's start from the beginning.I just so happened to drive by this place on my way to the Mexican bakery in the same strip mall. Attracted by its name \"Hong Kong Cafe\", I slammed on my brakes so hard my bf almost got whiplash. We already had dinner but I just had to go in and grab a menu. I was oohing and ahhing when I was reading through the menu, and squealed with excitement when I saw baked pork chop rice on it. Wasting no time, we met up with two friends for dinner the next day. There were so many things we wanted to have but I just had to do the baked pork chop rice with red sauce. My bf ordered baked seafood rice with white sauce. One friend also ordered the pork chop rice while the other had beef noodle soup. We also had chicken wings as appetizer. For drinks, we had Hong Kong style milk tea and milk tea + coffee. Now let me warn you, if you've never had Hong Kong cafe style food, it's a little different than other Chinese food you've had. \u00a0Yes they have sesame chicken on the menu, and I'm sure that's good too, but that's not why we're here. Hong Kong cafe food is a little bit of a mix between Chinese and western (fusion, if we're getting fancy here). The red sauce that comes with the pork chop rice isn't exactly a marinara sauce. It's a little sweater and thicker, with cheese on top and onion mixed in. The milk tea doesn't come with sugar; it's a little more bitter than your normal tea, and you'd add sugar to the sweetness of your liking. The white sauce is not exactly cream sauce you'll have at an Italian place either. But I promise you, everything is tasting as they're supposed to. They're so good, all 4 of us went back the next day for lunch.You heard me right.... in less than 18 hours, we were there twice. This time, we tried the fried tofu as appetizer (crunchy on the outside with a yummy soy base sauce on the side), udon with black pepper sauce (amazing), the seafood tofu soup (so yummy), and baked chicken rice with garlic sauce (can anything be too garlicky? I think not!). In addition to the milk teas, we ended the meal with some delicious red bean ice cream drink dessert. Seeing a trend here? Everything here is awesome, I don't think you can go wrong ordering anything. Their prices are more than reasonable and portions are great. Pork chop rice was about $11 and you'll really have to work at it to finish it in one seating. It actually lasted for 3 meals for me.Besides from the friendly service from our waiter, the owners also came out and chatted with us. He was super nice and friendly, explaining to us his process behind some of his food. There's the quick way of making food, and then there's the right way. They're definitely doing this right. If you want authentic Hong Kong cafe style food, look no further, they got it right here! Actually, if that's not what you're looking for, you still need to go and give them a try... you'll love it!"], ["Annie G.", "Grand opening 5 days ago! New Hong Kong spot, taking over what was previously Tumrup Thai. I stopped by for dinner with my mom, so we only tried two dishes but so far so good! Will have to visit again soon. We ordered the beef curry, which is ok... and the pork chop baked rice with spaghetti sauce, which was bomb! Hong Kong with a western flair! We also ordered the red bean ice drink with ice cream. They forgot the ice cream at first and when I was done with the drink, I saw another table get theirs with an ice cream scoop on top. I asked them why mine was missing and they quickly took my drink back to fix it. So unfortunately, my photo doesn't show the ice cream but you can picture that vanilla goodness on top!"], ["Trey C.", "Great place and service, I PROMISE TO UPDATE YOU AND TRY THE TRUE HONG KONG SPECIALISTS NEST TIME!

CALL AHEAD, or use grubhub. You've been warned. :)I went back to pick up some milk tea and vegetable egg rolls today, and my sister wanted some chicken wings too, so we ordered that as well. We didn't call ahead and ordered when we got there, and the food took 20-25 minutes to come out!! I was extremely upset because all we ordered were three dinky vegetable egg rolls, some chicken wings, and milk tea. There were two parties that came to dine-in after us and they both got their appetizers before us ... What? The milk teas took around 15 minutes to come out, which was also confusing. I would be even more upset if the dinky vegetable egg rolls weren't so delicious!! The wrapping was really light and crispy, and the filling was hot and flavorful. The milk tea was additionally tasty. It had a really bold black tea flavor and was not too sweet. I think my sister liked her salt and pepper chicken wings. Though, the wings didn't look like they were cooked all the way inside. Kind of creepy.I still like this place, though, because their food is incredible. They just need to learn how to prioritize.

And you'll love it.A Cha Chaan Teng is, in a very broad sense, similar to an American diner - a casual restaurant with a large menu catering to those wanting a quick but still tasty nosh. And Hong Kong Cafe is no exception. Begin with some Yuanyang [equal parts coffee and tea], or a nice tall glass of shaved ice with evaporated milk and fruit chunks (or cool grass-jelly cubes, or sweet 'n' squishy red beans) while you peruse the menu. Mmmm, they have borscht - and it's very good - but do be advised that the kind popular in Hong Kong is tomato-based and tangier than its Russian counterpart. Or how about a Spam and egg sandwich? A plate of fried calamari? Some toast with condensed milk and peanut butter [mmmmmmmmmmm]? You weren't expecting any of those were you? And the hits just keep on coming with the main courses.Ooh, doesn't some baked spaghetti sound good right now? And you're in luck - Hong Kong Cafe offers it with no fewer than five sauce options (including chili/black pepper, rich cream, and oniony garlic) as well as your choice of pork or chicken. Another great selection is the slow-braised beef brisket in curry sauce over steamed rice - my mouth is watering just typing that! Meanwhile, seafood lovers (among others) will go agog for the fried fish cutlet liberally drenched in creamed sweetcorn. And we can't forget the duck or pork noodle soup with pickled Gai Choy [mustard greens], or indeed the \"Western-style\" ketchup fried rice either. For the more conservative palates, there are of course plenty of sweet-n-sour/happy family/General Tao's-type possibilities too.

I ordered Bbq pork fried rice, Wor Wonton soup, and Triple Delight Chow Fun so I got a variety of dishes. The soup was watered down and quite bland. The veggies were fresh and crisp, but this soup totally lacked flavor. The bbq pork fried rice was awful! The pork was dry, unseasoned, and totally flavorless. The only highlight was that it wasn't oily or greasy, but it also didn't have much taste. And that's plain sad. What's better than a yummy fried rice?!? This isn't \u00a0the yummy kind! The trend continued with the triple delight chow fun... The noodles were dry, mostly stuck together, and appeared undercooked. Again this dish was so incredibly bland all I could do is laugh or just drown it in soy sauce. I choose to laugh and just stop forcing myself to eat this horrible dish. I'm not sure if I am missing something here, but Chinese food should be savory, salty, and flavorful. This food was just the opposite-- dry, bland, and totally lacking of any flavor!

I figured the kitchen had an off night and called to relay my experience. I talked to Mimi, who I have since learned is the owner. She was receptive in the beginning, but quickly grew hostile. At the end of our call she agreed to comp me the meal. I called about a week later to give it another try. I once again got Mimi, the owner. She was immediately defensive and said \"why would you wait so long to reorder?\" I replied I was not ready to order the next day and why should that matter? Her hostility increased and she became verbally abusive. She was NOT going to do anything about my first service and she made that very clear. When I pressed the point, she hung up on me. When I called back, one of her very distressed employees answered and told me she was in the bathroom. I told him I would hold. He said it could be up to an hour and hung up. Five minutes later Mimi called me and started in on a tirade and then hung up on me. Amazing. She clearly has no idea about how customer service works.Don't eat here or put up with an owner who is so arrogant she cannot put customer first. The food is definitely sub par and not worth the price. Especially when they are trying to nickel and dime you on a combo lo mein. Mimi actually had the nerve to tell me that in a combo you get three shrimp. When I told her I only got one she insinuated that probably I had a shrimp and thought it was chicken. WHAT??

We've been a few times and the owners really do raise their voices at customers. We've been there when they close in the middle of lunch, because there is no more food. You may have to wait, you may not get to eat, you may get yelled at, but this place still gets 5 stars. Pot stickers are amazing, soup dumplings are the reason to come here even if sometimes they rupture.If this is your first visit--be sure to order everything you want the first time around because they may not be able to take more orders. If you've been seated, trust that someone will be back at some point to take your order. Do NOT go up to the window by the cash register and start talking to them! Someone actually did this when we were there two weeks ago. Hilarity ensued but I imagine it was really unpleasant for these customers. If you don't know what to get--get an order or two of soup dumplings, an order of pot stickers, and the dan dan noodles. These are the specialties and you'll be super safe with these options. Then sit back and take it in, and the next visit you'll be clued in."]], "Hasu Asian Bistro & Sushi": [["Amanda G.", "The white tuna nigiri is so light, fresh, and delicious here.

My younger sister placed my cake on the table and leaned over without looking... She knocked over my older sisters sake! Our waiter immediately came to clean it up and even replaced the sake free of charge. Later, the tables turned and my older sister knocked over my younger sisters water glass, breaking it. Again, the waiter was fast to clean it up!We asked for the Chinese menu and ordered drinks, there seemed to be a little miscommunication between our servers on who was taking orders and drinks etc, but they got the job done, if not with more ground covered.A couple of strange requests from my family-a couple people with dietary restrictions which were seamlessly accommodated. My sister and I ordered ankimo (monk fish liver) and they brought out one portion for everyone! They were so thoughtful the entire meal. Due to a dental surgery, my father wasn't able to eat any solids besides rice, and they brought him out plenty of miso with white rice. They put our cake in a refrigerator in the back while we ate and brought it out after dinner. Everyone loved their food. Entrees ordered were the Hasu sushi plate, chicken fried rice, Jing jiang pork, cross bridge noodles, sesame chicken, sweet and sour soup, a couple sushi rolls and nigiri. Nigiri was fresh and tasty, not the best but pretty good. The Jing jiang pork & cross bridge noodles were off the Chinese menu and were incredible. The rolls were okay, but I'm not really a fan of rolls to begin with. I would highly recommend ordering something off of the Chinese menu!!I was offered complimentary nigori sake because it was my birthday.

Zoe Ma Ma has a select amount of home-style Taiwanese food, and it's pretty delicious. Note: this is TAIWANESE food, not to be confused with THAI food, which is from a different country (Thailand) and has significantly different flavors. I'm sure you can find cheaper Taiwanese somewhere outside downtown or in a Chinatown in a bigger city, but for the location and the quality of food, me and my family left very satisfied. The noodles are organic and homemade, which are an added bonus. We enjoyed the CPR, Beef Noodle, Za Jiang Mian, some potstickers, and sampled a marinated pork steam bun. It was like eating many of the favorite things that my mom might make, and I didn't leave feeling completely bombed with sodium like with a lot of Chinese restaurant food. I think this is where other reviewers felt disappointed about \"bland\" tastes, but really, most Chinese restaurants probably meet your daily sodium intake in one dish!! The ba bao rice dessert was awesome.Beyond the food, the space is neat and modern, with granite table tops and window-facing counters with stools. The owner was incredibly friendly, and we bonded over our common Taiwanese roots. \u00a0Wish I could come here all the time."], ["Holly E.", "I was very excited to have the chance to try out Zoe Ma Ma for lunch today. I ordered the Thur special and was disappointed it was not very special. But I will say the quality of their food is superb.I ordered - Lion Head $7.95Ginormous saucy pork meatball served with shitake mushroom, napa cabbage, bamboo shoots and rice. \u00a0Rice noodle and fresh organic egg noodle available. The meatball was delicious and yes ginormous and plenty of cabbage. However only one little mushroom and bamboo shoots were not included. I ordered it with the rice noodles and they didn't skimp there. And note they use bok choi. I didn't realize bok choi is also called napa cabbage. Initially I thought it was pretty bland until I discovered they have 4-5 sauce options on the counter.My meal and green tea ended up being $12.30 because they include a 15% gratuity. I'm ok with this but will likely skip the $2.50 tea next time. Wasn't too impressive.I say all this but I will be back because my friend's food looked more appealing. And I like simple fresh food and do you know how hard it is to make a meatball that size that is still moist and flavorful? I just hope next time they are more generous with the ingredients."], ["Zen T.", "I wasn't really too impressed. I got the special which was the braised beef . The beef I'd actually give 5 stars but the noodles were overcooked and there was definitely not enough soup for the dish. Plus the soup I thought was OK. Thank goodness for the sauces which made it better.Oolong tea was great.The cashier did not know the menu well. Also, he welcomed me to an authentic \"Chinese\" restaurant. Where did Taiwanese come from? OR was that due to his lack of knowledge?The ambiance was great. I thought the decor was very unique, innovative and cool. I MIGHT go back and try something else but maybe not."], ["Hannah W.", "I'm so happy that Zoe Ma Ma opened in Denver! I first came here out of some friends' recommendation. I always struggle to decide what to get so it's helpful that the menu is really simple. My first time here, a lot of the items I had wanted to try (pearl meat ball and hot & sour soup) ran out so I ended up getting the Steamy bun (bao) with pork and potstickers.The marinated pork in the bun is really flavorful and authentic, I wish I ordered another bun... What I liked about the potstickers were that they were crispy on the side. My friends really enjoyed the CPR and roast duck wonton noodle soup. One thing to note is that some of the items are only served on certain days (e.g. roast duck wonton noodle soups are only available Fri and Sat). Besides the great food, I love the atmosphere. The restaurant has a decent amount of seating and cute Asian d\u00e9cor (tea sets, newspaper design tables, etc.). The waiters and chef are super friendly too. My favorite person in the store has to be Zoe Ma Ma though. Because this store is fairly new, she's been at this store making sure operations are going well. The first time I was here, she gave me a goji rice cake for free and talked to me about her new restaurant and what cool breakfast menus she plans to have. Because I didn't get to try to pearl meat balls my first time, when I went back to the restaurant later that week, she pulled me over and gave me an extra one on the house. She definitely knows how to treat her customers and makes them feel at home! (Although I think the fact that I speak Mandarin helps)This place is tucked in on Wynkoop right on the side of the Union Station. If you're looking for a place for Asian food, definitely give this place a try!"], ["Mark T.", "Many, many decades ago, the island of Taiwan was commonly known as Formosa, a term deriving from a Portuguese word meaning \"handsome\" or \"beautiful\". Luckily, the Taiwanese (etc.) food served at the downtown branch of Zoe Ma Ma lives up to such lofty praise.Let's begin with a small nibble, shall we? I'm always a sucker for a good Jiaozi (dumpling) and ZMM's are some of the best I've tried in recent memory. These shrimp/pork/chive-packed wonders are of the Guotie (literally, \"sticks to the pan\") variety - fried on one side first, then steamed to succulence. Speaking of steamed things, their buns (or if you prefer, Bao) are almost as noteworthy as mine (ahem) - the marinated pork (Cha Siu) and curried chicken (Gali Ji) ones stand out in particular as I'm typing this. Zhen Zhu Wan Zi (glutinous rice-dappled pork balls) are another intriguing introduction for you to consider. As luck would have it, these are all so affordably priced, you could even try a few of each in one sitting - and it probably comes as no surprise to hear that I've been known to do precisely that!To continue, how about a little CPR? No, I'm not being presumptuous, so cut that out. Those three tiny letters actually refer to one of the most comforting creations on offer at ZMM - namely, a chicken and potato stew featuring just a touch of ginger and star anise, with plenty of steamed rice (or even noodles if you're so inclined) to soak it all up. On the lighter side, there's always the cold salad called Liang Ban Mian (egg noodles tossed with bean sprouts and cucumbers) to keep you feeling gratified, yet guilt-free. And depending on which day you visit, you might get to try one of their specials, like Niu Rou Mian (braised Sichuan-style numbing-hot beef with noodles) or even Shi Zi Tou (Shanghainese stewed meatballs, colloquially called \"lion's heads\" due to their size). It's all ripe for the picking at Zoe Ma Ma."], ["Hanh P.", "Taiwanese food in Denver? \u00a0Originated in Boulder, same menu. \u00a0Quick casual dining. \u00a0Order and pick up yourself. \u00a0Clean and big windows. \u00a0Nice atmosphere.Great roasted duck wonton noodle soup! \u00a0$13, but quality duck. \u00a0Yay for Oolong tea, 1 free refill!!!! \u00a0Hard to find oolong at restaurants around here. \u00a0Hope to try the Lion Head someday...

I have never tried tiwanese food and now I'm depressed my home town does not have it!! It seems like this is authentic Chinese street food and not something at all like Panda Express or PF Changs. (PF Lames) I had the dumplings and the Sunday special (Sichuan Braised Beef Noodle) and it was absolutely amazing! The braised beef noodle was a bit similar to ramen but it had its own really unique flavor. They had about 6 sauces on the counter that we used for the dumplings and they were all awesome :) be careful of ordering too much food because everything looked delicious but entrees are big enough to share between 2."], ["Margaret H.", "Just had lunch here and it was so delicious! \u00a0Very quick and friendly service. \u00a0I saw the owner there as well. \u00a0I was waiting on a specific item and he was quick to perk up and make sure we got what we were waiting for. \u00a0I'm sure this will be a regular lunch spot."], ["Doug H.", "I'm so excited that Zoe Ma Ma has opened a branch in Denver. \u00a0Now I don't have to drive to Boulder to get a kickass bowl of Chinese noodles! \u00a0In many ways, Zoe Ma Ma in Denver is better than the original. \u00a0First of all, the space is larger so you don't have to wait in a long line to get your order in, and there are a lot more tables to accommodate the clientele, especially larger groups. \u00a0And the space is gorgeous, with an open kitchen, and an eclectic mix of modern stainless steel styling with asian accented furnishing. \u00a0It's set up with a bar area and patio as well, so it's really going to be great when the warm weather arrives. \u00a0The location is perfect, right in the middle of the Union Station development and easy to get to (just as long as you don't need to park). \u00a0 And the food--oh the food--is great, and beats any other asian noodle shop in town,including Uncle. \u00a0Ma Ma Zoe really exists, and she toils in the kitchen putting out the noodles, bao and dumplings every day. \u00a0 For appetizers we tried a number of bao and dumplings, both vegetarian and porkfilled. They were delicious. \u00a0We all had various noodles for our entrees. \u00a0 I had the duck noodle soup which was tasty and hearty. \u00a0The noodles are handmade in the store, so they have the great chewiness of a freshly made noodle and stand up to the hot soup that it sits in. \u00a0 I love the beef noodle soup; as far as I'm concerned that's the best Chinese noodle dish extant (and is authentic as what you would find in a street side shop in Taipei Taiwan). \u00a0I've even driven all the way up to Boulder in the past just to eat a bowl of those spicy noodles. \u00a0 Unfortunately, on this night, it was not being served. \u00a0Zoe Ma Ma has a rotating set of noodle specials and they serve these specials only a few days of the week. \u00a0I also love Lion's Head soup and can't wait to be there on a day when that is being served. \u00a0You just have to keep coming back until you can experience the whole menu. \u00a0Ma Ma Zoe really knows what she's doing, and according to her owner-son, she's going to be more hands-on in the Denver restaurant while it's getting up to speed. \u00a0Lucky us."], ["Mason T.", "Good food and nicest grandma there haha. Decent price and also a nice environment to enjoy your food"], ["Scott B.", "This is a great little restaurant, with a very authentic Taiwanese taste. I have had the Za Jiang Mian, which is my favorite. The noodles are a great consistency, and takes me back to my travels in China. Love the pork sauce and fresh herbs. I crave this on cold days! On hot days, I go for the Cold Noodles. Super filling for a vegetarian dish, and a wonderful balance of noodles, sauce, veggies and herbs. Other things I recommend are the Iced Coffees, strong and sweetened with sweet milk. The vegan pot stickers are also good, but I prefer mine with pork. The seafood soup special is also really delicious, and fresh. It's not too fancy as far as the dining room goes, you order at the front, and pick it up yourself. Service speed is much improved since opening. I like the way they add in the tip for service. I know a few waitstaff who work in Asian restaurants. Tipping can be a real problem, as many of our lovely foreign visitors, do not understand the way it works here in America. People who work there should have benefits and a decent salary. I wont get into the whole thing, and besides, you can opt out. I just like that it sets a standard, taking the guesswork out.The sesame balls look so good, think I'll try them next, so save one for me!"], ["Matt D.", "Very fresh and tasty. \u00a0Good variety on the menu. \u00a0Extremely friendly staff. \u00a0The sustainability surcharge that replaces any tipping is very employee oriented and progressive."], ["Mai Y.", "Having read all the positive reviews on here, I was so excited when we ended up here for dinner tonight but I should have checked out the group of people on here giving this place such a good review. This place was such a disappointment. Everything was bland and flavorless. We paid close to $60 for two adults and two children and I truly regret spending my money here! No matter what sauce you use, they all taste the same. I love heat so when I tried every sauce on the counter and nothing was spicy or had any flavor, I realized why they are downtown where the Asian population isn't very high. The whole time we were there, not \u00a0a single Asian person was queuing up to get some \"authentic\" Taiwanese/Szechuan. Who are all you people thinking this is authentic? Just another one of those restaurants that have toned down on their original ethnic cuisines to suit the needs of the white American that cannot handle spice and heat!Ugh, lesson learned! You want some authentic Taiwanese or Szechuan? Head to where their own family and friends would eat there!"], ["JJ S.", "The only place I missed from Boulder was the amazing Zoe Ma Ma. Now she has opened up a Denver location and I get the fresh, clean, and perfect food without having to go up to Boulder. You cannot go wrong with the food here.

The duck was just chunks of meat with bones and fat still attached that made it hard to eat without pulling it apart. Not much quality meat and way ridiculously overpriced for how little meat you got. I'm so bummed I definitely wouldn't go back :/ go to a pho place and get more flavor for less than half the price. They say organic and cage free what not so I liked that but they charge you an extra fee on top of tax and don't even tell you unless you read a sign off to the side that explains it. I don't think businesses should ever be allowed to automatically tack on fees to your total without asking your permission.

Spicy, tender beef and rich flavor in the broth. The rest of the items were lackluster and somewhat bland. All we can taste in the hot and sour soup was the white pepper powder. The potstickers were under cooked with the pork filling still slight pink and mushy. Lao Wang Noodle House on Federal still has the best potstickers in Denver. The steam bao buns were good, but the dough was undercooked. Cool noodles were ok but still a little bland with the cool noodle sauce. Great concept but was a little disappointing.

Great place next to the train station."], ["Rachel C.", "Despite going to school up in Boulder, I never got a change to make it in to Zoe Ma Ma to try it. I had always been meaning to stop in, especially after studying abroad in China and missing the food! My friend and I stopped in over the weekend for a quick snack after a run through the city. The best way for me to describe the restaurant is long / narrow. There is booth seating along the set of windows, with a view of the open kitchen. They also have a nice sized patio, that once it warms up will provide a lot more seating and space for patrons. The windows open up and let in a lot of light and fresh air which is perfect for summer. We loved checking out all the Chinese movie posters they had hanging up. In terms of service, everyone was welcoming and friendly. It seems like they cook everything to order (greatly appreciated, of course), but our order came out in a very disjointed manner. I think we stood up three different times to get all of our dishes - why couldn't they just call us when it was all ready, or bring it to the table? As for the food, I am sad to say I wasn't super impressed. We ordered the chillin' veggies, cold noodles, pot stickers, and vegan dumplings. My vegan dumpling came out half open and falling apart. I tried a number of the different sauces expecting a diverse set of flavors, but from the first tastes it was tough to distinguish them from each other. Overall, the dishes we had were good, but not great. If it wasn't a freak 80 degrees out when we visited, I would've ordered the special - I'm sure that would give a better sense of the taste and quality of the food. I'll definitely be back to try the braised beef and/or the roast duck noodles and give Zoe Ma Ma another shot. Until then, I'll be heading down to Federal to get my fix."], ["Alex M.", "Overall, very tasty food. \u00a0I had the meatball with rice and gravy which was a special for that day. \u00a0I liked the sauces they put out there for you to self-serve.Inside was very comfortable, as well.I would go back!"], ["Audrey P.", "Very fresh food!

I would defiantly recommend this place and eat here again."], ["Vickey C.", "Came to the United States for 14 years from Taiwan and is really missing authentic Taiwanese food. I finally found a good place and I can't wait to go back to that restaurant again. When we got there, the owner, mama, is actually there cooking in the kitchen instead of stay in Boulder and just have someone else runing this place. You can also see how mama and other chefs prepare our food, which is pretty cool.I got their Sunday special, beef noodles soup and my husband for their off menu special Taiwanese seafood noodle soup. Both noodle soups bases are super authentic. Beef is really nice and tendered, and it may not be spicy enough for a lot of people, but it is just right for me as I don't eat a lot of spicy stuff. The way they serve scallion pancake is different from Taiwanese way. In Taiwan, in most cases, people get one or more 6\"piece of pie, sort of like a personal mini pizza, and you usually don't share that. Here in this restaurant, they give you one 6\"pie and they cut it into 8 pieces so you can share. As of the taste, it is also a little dry from the standard. I am still happy that this restaurant has it though.We also ordered stream buns and pearl meat balls. Steam buns are general smooth meat buns. Pearl meat balls, however, could be better.Now, the dessert. The restaurant serves goji and raisin sticky rice cake. It is just right amount of sweetness and tackiness of the rice. It is popular among kids and somewhat childish adult like me. I will give this place 4.5 star."]]}
