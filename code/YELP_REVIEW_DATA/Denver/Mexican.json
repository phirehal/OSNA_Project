Three tacos: \u00a0The Barbacoa de Borrego, the Chicken Mole, and the Carnitas. \u00a0All were superb! \u00a0Two tortillas each with HUGE portions of meat on each one. \u00a0The Borrego (lamb) wasn't even remotely gamey, the Mole was the perfect mix of spice and sweet but not drowning in it, and the Carnitas was tender and flavorful.Two cheese enchiladas a la carte: \u00a0Unfortunately, they got this part of the order wrong: \u00a0I had asked for cheese only, no chicken, and instead I got chicken only, no cheese. \u00a0And despite this rather large mistake, they are still DELICIOUS. \u00a0Yes, that's how good this place is.I ate my chips and salsa and enjoyed a Mexican Coke while waiting for my food to be prepared. \u00a0Just as I sat down, two men walked in with guitars and began playing and singing. \u00a0What a treat! \u00a0I'm so happy to have found this place. \u00a0Please, don't tell anyone about it. \u00a0I don't want it to get ruined with fame. \u00a0It will be our little secret, ok?"], ["Brittnie A.", "This is best Mexican food I've had in my entire life.

My companion had a big mess of fried meat, grilled peppers, and other stuff... what do they call this dish... covered in cheese, which he folded into yummy corn tortillas and ate fajita-style. Yum again.

All of them are cooking the same exact thing. So I was really excited to read all the wonderful reviews of Torta Grill. Hubs and I decided to have a very low key birthday dinner for him Saturday night. Turned out to be a little full still from our afternoon festivities that we skipped Torta and made plans to go Sunday during the Broncos game. Turns out they are closed on Sunday. Bummer. Okay let's get delivery for dinner on Monday after work! It's Monday, yeah we're excited for Torta! We both choose the hector, different sauces so we could split them. I go to place delivery online but I am wary because when I came back to look at the menu I noticed a review suggesting that they say they deliver but they really don't. So I was a little skeptical. I did some digging and realize they don't deliver past 5PM, but their website does allow you to order delivery after 5. So that's a poor customer experience. And it was hard to find the right times. We decided to just pick up the food, which was a painless easy experience. Fast forward, 20 hours later and my husband was sick all night and is still ill. I'm fine and we ate exactly the same thing. And btw the food was totally delicious. It was so good. I think so solid clean up and maybe proper temperature checking might be just what they need! I am always the one to get sick too so if my husband is sick, you know something is wrong. The sickness and confusion about time open and delivery on their website is why I'm giving them 3 stars. I will definitely try again though to see if anything changes."], ["Melissa P.", "I am so torn by my review of Torta Grill. A friend (a GI doc, actually, which will be funny later) recommended it to me. So while hubs and I were waiting for a show at the Ogden, we ran up here to try it out. He had the Carlito, and it was as good as promised. I'm not a vegetarian, but also not a huge meat eater, so I went with the Enrique with chipotle sauce, which had such interesting toppings as catcus and and egg. It was DELICIOUS! Seriously the best meal I'd had all month (and that's even comparing it to some $$$ restaurants). A little greasier than I would have wanted, but a delicious, and interesting blend of flavors. And thanks to the little gift from the Yelp! check-in coupon, we were able to try the Cucumber Lemonade for free. It was refreshing, but sweet, and really good. Why the three stars? Fast forward to me getting home at midnight after the show (dinner was at 8). My stomach started cramping up. I tried a pepto bismol (probably outdated, because I almost never have to take stuff like that). Didn't work. By 1AM, I was puking my guts out. I slept on my bathroom floor until 5AM. It was bad news bears from both ends. Hubs fared better than me, but his stomach was still upset as evidenced by the smells escaping from him. (Have you completely lost your appetite now?). I was the DD and didn't have anything to drink at the concert, so perhaps some beer helped partially disabled the germs in his stomach. But you guys...it was SO good! Just because someone didn't wash their hands after going to the bathroom, I paid for it all night. Even so, I'm going to trust these good reviews, and give them another shot some day. I'll be looking for their sanitation score the next time I come in though. Good hand hygiene is imperative!!"], ["Erica G.", "Really great sandwiches - fresh, tasty ingredients and yummy bread. \u00a0The only downside of taking out the sandwiches is that the bread gets a little soggy after a few minutes. \u00a0The Cucumber \u00a0lemonade is really great too. \u00a0Nice and refreshing with a spicy sandwich."], ["Vic C.", "Mexican Sandwiches found here at Torta Grill. There is a small little lot (free parking) right behind this tiny eatery in the back in case you do not find parking (metered) on the street (free after 6 pm). My husband and I came by here last Thursday (9-17) for a late dinner. Around 8:15 pm, we saw a few patrons eating at the little counter and employees cooking up some meat and vegetables on their stove top griddle. After browsing the menu, we decided upon:By the way, I just want to mention that each torta comes spread with mayonnaise, beans, avocado slices, tomato slices and grilled onions. You can also choose between your choice of the following to add to your sandwich: jalapeno pepper, chipotle sauce, avocado serrano sauce and jalapeno jelly. Miguel Torta, $7.75 prior to tax- My husband decided to order this torta which comes with steak, egg and cheese. This torta came already cut in half and was more than enough for one person to eat and feel satisfied. The steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The creaminess of the mayo and avocado really went well with everything that is stuffed in this large sandwich, making each bite better than the last. Enrique Torta, $7.75 prior to tax- I opted for a vegetarian torta (I know that isn't traditional, but I am fan of vegetarian food options and believe me, I did not feel like I was missing meat) that comes with egg, cactus, queso panela cheese, crushed red peppers and another type of cheese. This sandwich was really good. Just like the Miguel, this sandwich was also cut in half. I only had half of my sandwich and saved the other half to be consumed 2 days later (which still tasted really good). I liked the red peppers and cactus, as it gave it a really nice added flavor and texture. The avocado, mayo and smashed beans really complemented all of the ingredients. ------------------------(Total= $16.74 including tax, prior to tip)With Yelp Check In, you get a free cucumber lemonade. I thought it was okay, but felt it needed to be sweeter. But my husband liked it and found it to be refreshing. Wait time for our sandwiches was not that long. Seating is quite limited here, probably can fit about 10 people. But just be aware that there is no public restrooms. So if you are looking for something really filling to eat for lunch or dinner, then Torta Grill should fit the bill.

I thought it was a tad pricey for a torta place but they do have more options of things to put on your torta and a cool selection of speciality tortas and combinations. Expect to wait a while.

Sadly, I was disappointed with nearly every aspect of Machete, almost to the point of doubting the high praise that other Yelpers had to offer.First, you head down into the basement of one of Cherry Creek's many three story office buildings. Initial reaction was good, tin ceilings, Christmas lights everywhere (I assume this will not be around after Christmas), and couches hugging TV's along the walls. So, an OK start.Then the poor to super poor began. The waitress either had a twin, or forgot that she offered us drinks three times, and asked us how we were twice. Very odd. The happy hour menu is TINY, three or four items with \"$$ off\" instead of actual prices on the menu. Misleading, and not good. We order our drinks, and find the house margarita to be barely palatable. My head was spinning from cheap booze even before the first bite of chip.Speaking of chips, they were average pieces of cardboard. And that is the best compliment I can give. The guac was also average. Finally, the good comes out served like high priced cuisine which certainly didn't taste like. Guys, it's Mexican food, just serve it normally and we won't have such high expectations for the taste.My reward for a bad meal, stomach pains and a $40 bill.

Uhh no but it's three ingredients and most places don't have a problem with fulfilling such a simple request. (Oh and I found out that they do indeed have quesadillas on the children's menu).

This place has impressed me. For a local, $4 taco joint, they know how to deliver a bang for your buck! This restaurant opened six weeks ago because a son wanted to honor how he and his father used to bond of tequila drinking fun in Mexico when he was younger. I love the story. And it's 100% Colorado owned! Even if the tequila ingredients are from Mexico. The menu was fantastic. \u00a0The Arta Tequila event was showcasing their tripled distilled tequila cocktails with the absolutely scrumptious tacos from their venue. Talk about the best of both worlds. The tequila expert and the chef prepared a tasting that was to die for. My favorite was the mouthwatering pairing of the Arta Reposado Cucumber / Grapefruit Mojasa with the Tacos de Tivuron and Tacos de Arrachera Com Chile Relleno. For those that don't speak Spanish, that translates to shark and beef with chile. These are custom made tacos with mixed drinks that are to die for. The drinks are more bitter that I typically like it and I can't help but admit that it's educating my pallet! These are great tacos. Of you're from Houston, they are even BETTER than Torchie's tacos and I know that's hard to believe. So be prepared for greatness and sit at the bar to learn more about the tequila you're drinking :)"], ["Melody F.", "By far the BEST taquieria I've been to in Denver. \u00a0I went with a couple of friends during happy hour and got 3 tacos: the rotisserie chicken, the steak and chorizo, and the regular steak taco. \u00a0Everything was delicious and the tacos were huge. \u00a0I was pretty much full after half of my meal but pushed to finish most of it. \u00a0The rotisserie chicken was my least favorite out of the three so I didn't feel so bad about not finishing all of that one. \u00a0Cannot wait to take my boyfriend back here very, very soon..."], ["Marlon B.", "The food here was really good, especially the odd hibiscus quesadilla. \u00a0What keeps me from returning is the prices. \u00a0This place is much too expensive. \u00a0$30 for 2 people for lunch is absurd. \u00a0I know this city is becoming more and more of a new LA or Bay Area...doesn't mean we have to pay like we are there. \u00a0Pretentiousness never works well at a restaurant...especially for real people like us."], ["Alan N.", "This place really sets the mood, we went for a late night dinner and I got the tacos with some sort of squid sauce, it was tangy but good and interesting.

The menu was a bit difficult to read in the funky lights in the back, one of which was beaming in my face. Thankfully someone helps us move it so it was shining on their Tequila (and what-not) lockers instead. Sasha was a sweet and accommodating server, who didn't mind when I sent my Kona margarita back... it didn't really taste like coconut or pineapple all that much, more just sour mix and I opted for a beer instead. We ordered chips and guac, and had no shortage of the 4 yummy salsa option brought to us. Sasha even let us try some of the peanut and caramelized onion guac that we were to afraid to order. Though it wasn't bad, we were glad to have ordered the traditional instead.Onto the most important part-TACOS!!! I had the swordfish, the pulled pork and apple, and chicken and potato. Three was way more filling than I expected, but they were so good I had to stuff myself anyway.

It's strange that having lived in San Diego for all these years, I always opted for the burrito over the torta. This might be a game-changer. After much hemming and hawing over the various meat combinations, I settled on the Norte\u00f1a. This torta, nay, gourmet Mexican sandwich, was filled with steak milanesa (breaded meat), Mexican cheeses, avocado, grilled onions, tomatoes, and refried beans. The refried beans threw me off a bit and was something I probably could have done without, but I did ask for the works. The bread was perfectly grilled without having the sharp, crispy consistency of toasted panini that may at times cut your gums. You also get a grilled jalapeno that replaces your typical pickle. It wasn't too spicy if you forwent eating the seeds. No Mexican meal is complete without the addition of Mexican Coke, straight from the glass bottle, of course. Overall, it was a decently satisfying meal for a great price.

Definitely a mom and pop shop where locals clearly like to chill. You know it's gonna be a great experience when you look around and there are Ricky Martin videos playing on every screen in the restaurant. After possibly 10 minutes of being crazy confused looking at the menu, the guy at the counter laughed at me and told me to get the Norte\u00f1a which is pretty much a steak torta with avocado, cheese, jalape\u00f1os, and a possibly eggs, I could not tell but each and every savory bite was delicious...so delicious that I honestly would fly back to Denver just for this Torta.

So to save you the embarrassment, do not ask such silly things.So, a whole menu of tortas! How fantastic! Super juicy meats! But greasy, so if you are going to eat here, plan accordingly. Not a good day to wear skinny jeans or have any productivity after your meal. Food coma begins shortly after eating your first half of the sandwich (they cut them in half).

Three people could easily split these.There was no room for dessert. I will be back in a heartbeat and will continue to sample the margaritas as well as the menu. There's a lot to choose from here. And the waiters were also quite attentive!"], ["Thaddius B.", "This is just based on the dollar tacos...I have been wanting to come here for a while and stopped in for dollar tacos for lunch. \u00a0The place has a great vibe, don't really dig the scroll menus as they are difficult to read but the menu seemed pretty appealing as far as items I wanted to try. \u00a0 We just got some chips and salsa and some tacos. The salsa really did not have much flavor. \u00a0Needed some salt, cilantro, more onion or something, it was fresh and that kept it from failing altogether. They do have a salsa sampler that I will try next time \u00a0 I ordered 1 chicken, 1 pork, 1 steak and 1 shrimp taco. \u00a0 They looked great when they came out and looked very appealing. \u00a0They were all just a dollar except the shrimp which they charge 4 dollars for. \u00a0The shrimp were very low quality frozen tiny shrimp the kind you get in a frozen bag at the grocery and although they had a lot of nice ingredients with them nothing could cover up the fact they are were pretty low quality, I would not get again. \u00a0The steak were simple and delicious, the chicken were pretty good too as were the pork. \u00a0 \u00a0Other food that was coming out of the kitchen \u00a0looked really good and I started to wish I had ordered something off the main menu. \u00a0 I will definitely give this place another try as I feel the tacos are not totally representative of all their food."], ["DJ S.", "Carne Asada tacos are to die for. \u00a0The mole sauce is the best. \u00a0Great find on South Broadway."], ["Elizabeth G.", "The Mezcalita Margarita is ideal!

The service was great...no complaints at all."], ["Kayla V.", "I came here for a weekday happy hour/dinner with a few of my friends. Monday is 2-4-1 margaritas, which is what we all needed. We ordered the chips and salsa sampler. The chips were good, the green guac stuff wasn't my favorite but the other salsas were alright. I ordered the carne asada tacos and a side of rice. The tacos were good, they seemed a little peppery but aside from that I was satisfied. The rice was really, really good. I don't know what they put in it, but I really liked it. I think all of my friends enjoyed their meals so we will definitely be coming back."], ["Chris H.", "I discovered this place through Yelp reviews. It is a very short drive from my house and I am thrilled that I discovered it. They have a fun menu. Yes they do charge for their chips and salsa...but in reality every place does.

I also discovered Not Your Father's Root Beer when I was eating here and it has become my drink of choice."], ["Kimberly I.", "This place is top notch. \u00a0They go above and beyond with their humongous roll of a menu. \u00a0There are pages of options for you. \u00a0There is literally something for everyone! \u00a0They even have soyrizo... which I am assuming is vegetarian chorizo? There chips and salsa are so fresh and delightful. \u00a0Everything on the menu has a different sauce and you can choose to smother things from a list of 5 different sauces. \u00a0To be a real pain, we asked for a sample of each sauce on our first visit... and I can say I loved them all. \u00a0Their mole is my favorite. \u00a0It is not to heavy and has great flavor. \u00a0Their chili rellenos smothered in mole are a great choice. \u00a0It is a HUGE chili and it is so lightly battered. \u00a0You don't feel like you just ate mostly fried breading with a little bit of chili. \u00a0It is ALL chili. Their brunch is also fantastic. \u00a0$10 bottomless mimosas, awesome bloody marys, and if you are like me... you may order a chilada eventually and make it from brunch all the way to happy hour. \u00a0They also have brunch that is served all day every day, and are packed and giving amazing specials on taco Tuesday.There staff is good and their bartenders are good looking.

I'm very picky about my Mexican food as my familia is from Mexico. We ordered chips, salsa and queso. The salsa was fresh, not spicy but decent flavor. The queso had good flavor but was rubbery. I ordered the huevos rancheros, mol\u00e8 on the side. The mol\u00e8 was actually not bad. The flavor was not as complicated as exceptional mol\u00e8 but still impressive. Some mol\u00e8 can be bitter- this wasn't. Overall, this was not bad. I'll be back."], ["Tara B.", "The service was very pleasant and helpful. The tacos were very tasty. We also had this meat that was marinating in a clay pot that was out of this world. I wish I could remember the name of it.

We chose Adelita's simply because my friend has gotten it confused with Cocina on Alameda. We were however very impressed with the environment of the restaurant - very colorful, great ambiance for a mexican place! \u00a0We started with the skinny margaritas, which very surprisingly did not taste skinny - they were great! She had the veggie tacos and enjoyed them, while I ordered the enchiladas (you can mix and match the fillings, and choose between 4 sauces!). I don't usually like refried beans... too starchy at most places, but Adelita's were delicious and a great consistency. I'm also not typically a fan of rice, but theirs was fantastic. \u00a0The carne asada was a little dry, but the carnitas more than made up for it. Also, I loved that they used real crumbly queso fresco, rather than melted cheddar on top! My biggest complaint was that chips and salsa aren't automatically served at the table. We found out they were $2 each upon seeing the bill. $2 is no big deal, but I'm a believer in chips & salsa coming free at the table."], ["Robin B.", "At first this place hit an item on my \"pet peeve\" list- charging for chips and salsa. \u00a0We decided to order guacamole and chips to make it worth paying for chips. \u00a0And worth it it was- the guac was tasty with a nice little kick. \u00a0The salsa was more like a pico de gallo, very fresh and a good compliment to the guacamole and homemade thick chips. \u00a0My husband ordered the chicken mole and declared it one of the better moles he's taste in years. \u00a0Not too sweet but thick and very flavorful with a good balance of spices. \u00a0I enjoyed a mushroom stuffed relleno and vegetable tamale, both very delicious and the tamale wasn't dry as they sometimes can be. \u00a0I tried the green sauce on both which was good, next time I'll mix it up a bit and sample their other sauces. \u00a0Our first time here and we'll definitely be back."], ["Allie R.", "So glad my trusty yelp app lead to me Adelita's! It was pretty late \"for Denver\" around 9:30pm and I was craving a margarita and some mexican food. I had called a couple other places that were closed already, then I found Adelita's and they were open til 11pm on a Wednesday. Awesome. We walked in and there was only one other group of people eating, but there were 5-10 people at the bar. The restaurant has a more of a cozy modern mexican vibe to it which I liked a lot. Nice art on the walls and I always love exposed brick. Service was prompt and got my margarita out quickly while I was still looking over the menu trying to decide what I wanted. Boyfriend decided on a chicken burrito, and since it was kinda late I figured we could just split it. The burrito was huge, and our waiter suggested getting it smothered with their \"christmas sauce\" so we could try both the chile verde and chile rojo. The chile verde is not your typical green chile, it is made from tomatillos instead of your traditional hatch chili. It was great. It has a very different tangy flavor to it, its surprising at first but then grows on you. Our waiter (I wish I remembered his name) was great the whole time answering our questions and bringing everything out quickly. We will definitely be back to try more of their food items. They also have daily specials (like $2 tamales on Thursday's) and 2 daily happy hours :)"], ["Michael D.", "Went for happy hour on Monday and ended up eating.

I work in the neighborhood and some co-workers introduced me to 100% a year ago. I'm particular about Mexican food, there are few places I will go to let alone recommend to others. I was immediately impressed with the food presentation and the fact that the food was delicious, generous in portions and the price was more than reasonable for the quality of food received. I have frequented this restaurant numerous times for lunch, a few times for dinner, and take out and the food has been consistently great. The happy hour was great with 2-for-1 margaritas, but I really enjoy the mojitos. The table side guacamole is a crowd pleaser for sure, and so damn tasty! I like the break-out of the restaurant space; the front is open, comfortable and inviting. Roomy enough for big groups but also allows decent space between tables to have lunch meetings or personal conversations and not be distracted by the patrons at the table next to you.I like the touch of the open kitchen and tequila display. The bar at the back is fun, with a nice view at sunset and allows for small or big groups to hang out. Not to outshine the great the customer service, the staff is attentive, helpful and friendly. \u00a0I have held a company party in the restaurant bar area and my guests were truly impressed with the food, presentation and service.

I was in a bind with less than a day to have catering in place for a large group meeting and Ric was kind enough to meet right after I called him, create a menu and have the food delivered less than 24 hours later to my office. It was a quiet meeting, since everyone was so intent on eating.They loved every bit of it from the guacamole and shrimp ceviche to the tacos de papas and empanadas de picadillo. We had so much that additional staff were able to sample the goods and now can't wait to try the restaurant.

When you enter, there is a separate waiting area, nicely separated from the rest of the dining room, yet still part of the restaurant. \u00a0Patrons in the restaurant don't have to feel \"rushed,\" as they won't see the other patrons waiting to be seated. I appreciated this. A separate waiting area is very nice to see in a restaurant.The interior of the restaurant is done in earth tones - browns, tans, blacks, oranges, reds. There is soft amber lighting, hanging from the black ceiling. The black ceiling makes the ceiling \"disappear.\" The floors are wooden.There are ten tables that seat two, approximately six tables that seat four, and 5 booths. There is a large \"community\" type bar table that seats approximately 18 people. This table has nice \"star\" lights above them. I liked them, very cute, subtle too. The lovely music playing in the background, is just loud enough to hear, but not too loud that you can't hear others in your dining party. Thank you for that! I'm getting older, and it's so nice to be able to hear those you are with. \u00a0Bar - The Bar area in the back, is quite a surprise!

In fact, there were several large groups there, as I took a look around. There are two oval tables, which comfortably seat six people, two large bar \"community\" tables, and other individual tables. Oh, the bar! The bar comfortably seats 18 people - no kidding!Food- Appetizers, Soups, Vegetarian, Pollo, Seafood, Salads, Desserts.The first night we split:a. \u00a0 Pepes Street Tacos - carne asada, and pollo asado, with cilantro, onion, whole beans, and picante sauce. We enjoyed these, and just the right size too. \u00a0We will order these again. b. \u00a0Flautas de Pollo - three chicken flautas, mild salsa, queso, avocado, and black bean puree. These were good, but I'd order the tacos over these. I just liked the tacos, what can I say?c. \u00a0Soap de Tortilla - WOW!!!! \u00a0We only ordered a cup, but WOW, that cup was absolutely De-Lic-ious! \u00a0Homemade, and full of large chunks of chicken and veggies. \u00a0 \u00a0 Simply YUMMY!!!!d. \u00a0Flan de Rompope - Good enough to split for two, if you need just a little bit of sweet goodness after your meal. The second night (the very next night, what can I say, I really liked it!):a. \u00a0We split the grilled chicken burrito - This was very good, and easily split between the two of us. Good, nicely done. We really enjoyed the green chili that topped the burrito, nice flavors!Drinks - full bar. My husband had the house margarita both nights. He said the margarita was not overly sweet, that you can taste the tequila, it had a nice bit to it. Chips and Salsa - you are brought chips and salsa when you first sit down. The chips are not too salty, which many can be. The salsa has a little bit of a \"kick.\" The other \"salsa\" that they bring out is what I really want to talk about here. It is chopped veggies, and Oh My Gosh! There are onions, cilantro, carrots, and few other things. WOW!!! YUMMY!!! \u00a0Please bring me a bowl of this! I don't know what it was about it, but I just absolutely LOVED it!!! L-O-V-E-D \u00a0IT!!Restrooms - beautiful, and clean! You MUST check out the restrooms.

There's an indoor & outdoor area & the entire place is pretty dimly lit with some modern wall art/graffiti-looking mural & painted concrete blocks as table legs. The taco selection offers a variety of very enticing & fun combos & ingredients but 1/2 of them did not deliver. The wildcard taco was an Indian inspired one with vindaloo marinated meat but this was the blandest taco I tried (of the 4 I tasted). It was extremely lacking in flavor & tasted more like plain yogurt sauce than anything you'd associate with Indian food. The chips for the chips & salsa & in the $12 nachos are extremely salty. The michelada, which I know is a lime-based drink, was overly sour (& I love sour stuff! In fact, I had just come back from drinking sour beers @ Crooked Staves before this meal). The fried shrimp taco with pickled vegetables on top was my favorite taco. It packed some heat & acidity & was full of flavor without being salty. The pork shoulder taco also had great flavor but less pizazz when compared with the shrimp. The octopus was also great (not chewy!) & had some shredded fish (bonito flakes? I'm not sure) that gave the taco a very seafood-ish flavor that I really enjoyed. The waiter didn't know what the agua fresca was for the day but I ordered it anyway. It was refreshing & not too sweet but I still do not know what flavor it was. It was mostly ice & I finished it in 4 large sips thus contributing to my 3 star A-OK review.

The Queso dip with the veggies was great, the tacos were great ($2 during happy hour), and the fried Anaheim Relleno was good except for the very in-your-face goat cheese taste (make sure you LOVE goat cheese if you try it). The drinks were impeccable and so creative. Luckily there were three of us so we could try a huge variety of them!

When you step in here you can tell everyone is having fun and all the waiters seem psyched to be working in such an enjoyable spot.The food, though, is why I am giving this place 5 stars. The tacos I tried here were just really, really superb. The chicken leg taco here was probably the best chicken-based taco I have ever had anywhere. The chicken skin in it and the tongue-in-cheek addition of Sun Chips just really put it over the edge.The octopus taco was probably my second favorite but it was astoundingly delicious and absolutely packed with meat. The pork shoulder taco, which was incredibly flavorful, and the very rich shrimp taco were also very good. The Brussels Sprouts were sour and sweet and spicy and just really delicious. They were deep fried and covered in this addictive orange sauce. Definitely give them a try.Anyway, I just really enjoyed myself here and I hope to come back again someday.

The flavor was on point & the tongue was tender & flavorful. I liked the abril as well but thought texturally it wasn't as interesting since everything was pretty much liquidy or soft. The pescado was fun & colorful with bright pink pickled onions that were more sour than I expected. I got a limeade soda cocktail for $3 from the cocktail menu & thought it was delicious! For folks who like to feel their alcohol but not taste it, this is the cocktail for you! I could definitely drink more of these based on flavor but the alcohol does kick in a bit later. The ambience here is fun, dim, relatively modern, hip & loud. There is outdoor seating as well with some outdoor lighting. Inside they have a little wall cubby area where you can take photos (by the bathroom). This place is synonymous with Pinche Tacos (taco truck). All the workers will be wearing Pinche Taco shirts & the walls will have the word pinche on it everywhere so don't get confused! \u00a0This is 1 of their 2 locations in Denver. There's limited parking so street parking might be necessary. I was too full to try their churros but it looked delicious (& is the only dessert item they offer). The price is higher than what you're used to paying for a street taco (especially if you're someone like me who's used to buying Mexican street tacos @ the flea market in San Jose for $2) but the creative menu & variety of taco options makes it worth it. I don't get why the most expensive taco on the menu is the vegan gluten free 1. Our waitress wasn't particularly friendly (didn't smile or greet us) but the hostess was super friendly which made up for our bored/disinterested waitress."], ["Jessica H.", "I went to Pinche last Friday for happy hour. We were told the wait was 30 minutes and we almost went next door (didn't want to miss happy hour!), but then the hostess mentioned there was a community table available and that she may have to seat someone else next to us at some point. Perfect.I ordered the Pinche Paloma, which was a nice alcoholic grapefruit refresher. It tasted great and it was only $4 on the happy hour menu. For food, we had the chorizo deviled eggs. They were super good- a bit spicy and pretty innovative. I also had 2 tacos. The lamb taco and beer battered fish tacos. The lamb taco was out of this world (I love lamb and it was super tender and tasty). The beer battered fish tacos were decent, but nothing amazing. I would definitely go back to order the lamb and maybe the beef tongue or something of the like (or maybe just all lamb tacos :) ). Atmosphere-wise, Pinche has a nice patio, along with cool decorations inside the restaurant (Day of the Dead skulls, etc).

There is no waiting area, and it is a little awkward holding a giant silver rod with a zebra card on the top of it (this is what you get when you put your name on the waiting list). I highly recommend they get a pager system instead, when my friends met up with me, their first reaction was, \"what is that giant silver stick you're holding?\"We were seated fairly quickly, although had to wait until my friends showed up. Our server greeted us quickly, we started with the queso, which was amazing! We already had drinks, so she tried to take our drink menu, we were like, \"Noooo!\" I had the Pollo in Crema taco, outstanding, also the lengua, amazing, and the special, so good! My friends loved their food too, although did not love the seafood tacos, they were too spicy and were unexpect. Our server asked if we wanted dessert and we said no, she tried to take the drink menu again, \"Nooo!\" We ordered one more round of drinks and continued to catch up before we headed out for the night.I love the tacos here!

The place was super busy from their happy hour. It was from 3-6pm (a bit earlier than I'm used to), so I completely missed happy hour. That didn't stop me from trying some fun things, as the hostess was able to find me a single seat amidst some larger parties. My server, Jennah, was super attentive, friendly, and quick.The house margarita was excellent and a great value. I don't like my margaritas too sweet, and they were more than accommodating about lightening up on the simple syrup. The tacos were amazing! I had the shrimp and scallop xinic-pec, hontigo, and the pork belly agridulce. My favorites were the hontigo and the pork belly. The hontigo had a great blend of mushrooms that had a delightful chew to them making every bite an umami explosion. The pork belly was very unique in that it was braised in a sweet and sour sauce. The skin had a nice crisp to it, and the cabbage helped to balance out the sweetness with more acidity. Overall, everything I had was great! \u00a0I would definitely recommend stopping by if you get the chance!"], ["JT T.", "Second stop on the gringo taco tour. \u00a0I ordered the pork belly taco because it looked awesome and it's pork belly. \u00a0Seemed like a no brainer. \u00a0It was quite disappointing though. \u00a0It wasn't as flavorful as I was hoping. \u00a0And it lacked the crispiness on the outside. \u00a0Total miss for me.I was told I should've ordered something with the fried cheese. \u00a0I did like the patio and I could definitely see some daytime boozing action there."], ["Jason S.", "This place is awesome! It's in a great area of Denver just east of downtown. Street parking was relatively easy to find (even on a Saturday night). Place is small and packed but the wait wasn't long and it was worth it! They have a great drink selection including local craft beers. The tacos are delicious and there are several veggie options! 2-3 tacos will fill you up. The fundido cheese is very FUN indeed. And don't forget to finish the meal with some churros!!! The service was spot-on (my water glass was ALWAYS full). For such a hip and happening place the prices were very reasonable.

Expect some terrific tacos - order by checking them on a menu and handing it to your waiter. Expect it to be loud - the noise level was almost too much for these middle aged ears. Expect some terrific drinks - I had two lovely pours of anejo tequilas. These are street tacos. Not the crispy taco shells you may be used to. The lengua has become one of my favorite meats for tacos. It is usually soft and tender meats. This was cooked very well and the honey mayo - which kinda scared me when I saw it listed on the taco - was delish! The crispy pork was my 2nd choice. The pickled red onions have become a craving for me lately and these were as good as any I ever had.The service was terrific. We had two or three waiters popping by all the time to check on us. The hostess checked on us a couple times too. The tables are pretty well packed in. So be aware you may be dining with other people that you didn't come in with. Our water glasses were never empty and our food came out quickly.This would soooo be a 5 star place if we could have heard ourselves think.

When you're able to wade through the throngs of yet to be seated customers, they give you a card with a letter on it (we had K) and a drink menu. There are only a few tables, which had been occupied by large groups, so we took a bar seat when it finally became available. Although this place is small, it makes up for it with plenty of style. I love all the exposed brick, the sliding ladder at the bar, and copper tiled columns. The bar had several creatively named drinks, but really, the food is AMAZING! They have you mark off your selections on a reusable menu (very clever). You have several options for tacos as well as freshly made chips, guacamole, a variety of salsas or if you're really treating yourself, queso fundido. I don't remember which 3 I randomly ordered, but they were all delicious! I was satisfied with that, but my husband said he could have done 2 more. \u00a0The chips are hot and perfectly salted.

I also ordered the shrimp and scallop.The pork belly: I have never had pork belly before this taco. It was sweet and moist. The garlic that came with it was cooked perfectly. I did destroy the cute presentation so that I could eat it like a taco. It came with a sauce that you could pour over it. I'm not sure it added any flavor. This one was my favorite. The tongue: I wish I had tasted more tongue. I feel like it was drowned in sauce. It was still good, I just wanted more meat! It was crispy and the sauces were delicious. This one was messy because of all the sauce. The shrimp and scallop: the shrimp and scallop were cooked perfectly. I think it was an avocado sauce on top. It was very good as well.

Parking was a bit tight as they only have 1 very small lot. I was pleased with the number of vegetarian tacos and tried all 3!

The hongos was my favorite by far and the Vegan 1949 was quite spicy.We didn't stop with tacos and also ordered the churros, which were AMAZING.

Happy Hour is 3-6 everyday and all day Monday and is your best friend. The happy hour nachos are a must, as well as the house margarita and the pinche sodas. All the tacos are great... anything with the griddled cotija cheese is pretty much euphoric. The Hongos is my personal favorite followed by the Cordero. The only taco I think is whack is the Camaron a la Parilla - the shrimp are tiny. If there's a taco special, get after it. It's usually only on the menu for one day/night.Parking lot is tiny. Park on York, Colfax or one of the side streets. If you're coming in with more than two people, you're probably going to have a wait. The bar and high tops are first come/first serve. The bartenders are great and hilarious. They know how to make a drink. The wait staff are great too even when it's super busy.

I selected three tacos: lengua, pork belly, and hongo (mushrooms). They were street taco size corn tortillas, doubled, but they piled HUGE amounts of filling. The lengua was good--nice mix of flavors. The pork belly had a big square of meat that easily split into layers for easier eating. The mushroom taco was good. The mushrooms had a great meaty consistency and I liked that it was smaller than the other two, as I was getting full.

So when my Denver friends recommended this place to me and my girlfriend, I was a bit skeptical. My skepticism was buoyed somewhat due to the long lines and the nearly hour wait - we came at 8:30 pm on a Saturday night, and the place was packed. It's a really small dimly lit restaurant with community seating and a very attractive outside seating arrangement. While waiting, we were able to try some of the margaritas from the bar - they were very strong and tasted mostly of tequila (not a complaint, and on an empty stomach that could get dangerous quickly). We were seated at one of the community tables. We were warmly greeted by a very friendly (to the point of it being too much) waiter who joked with us and was very attentive. You order the tacos by marking how many you want of each one on the menu, which the waiter takes back to the kitchen. It's ingenious and I don't know why more Mexican restaurants don't try this ordering method. We started with the Queso Fundido con Chorizo appetizer, which was melted pepper jack cheese and Chorizo with some homemade chips. Although you don't get a lot of cheese it's still quite good, and the chips are served hot and greasy. Next came the tacos, which range in price from $3.25-4.50, which may seem steep but you get a lot of taco for that price (an order of 2-3 tacos per person is more than enough for most people). Between the four of us we ordered a ton, so I'll highlight my favorites:1. Vegan 1944 (Saut\u00e9ed spinach, roasted chile poblano, corn, salsa abuela, avocado, pico de gallo): \u00a0I'm not a vegan but this was so tasty I may become one. ($4.50)2. Carnitas: (Crispy roasted pork, pickled red onions, avocado crema): Hey remember when I said I'm considering going vegan? I take it all back. ($3.50)3. Pescado (Chipotle & beer battered fish, slaw, avocado & pineapple guacamole, pickled red onions, lime): Big chunk of fish and sweet guacamole. ($3.75)4. Hongos (Grilled shitaki, crimini & oyster mushrooms, griddled cotija cheese, creamed cilantro corn, ancho chili crema): My favorite of the bunch. I'm a huge fan of grilled mushrooms.

Our server offered us some recommendations. I don't remember the names of the three we chose, but one was a spicy pico de gallo, one was a green salsa and the other was a smoky red salsa.

We had a radish salsa which I so want the recipe for!!! \u00a0The corn chips were served warm and in a brown paper bag - so cute.We didn't leave without having some \u00a0fabulous churros for dessert. \u00a0They were light and served with a lovely chocolate dip.The service was also very friendly and helpful in getting through the menu (you check off what you want as a group) and making sure we had everything we needed through out the meal. \u00a0Even though it is very busy - they did not rush us at all. \u00a0I can't wait to go back and try more items from their menu."], ["Sally H.", "I was hearing good things about this place and I was dying DYING to try it. \u00a0It turns out, it is located around the corner from my previous work place. \u00a0I cannot believe I use to drive pass it for the past two years. \u00a0The sign to it is very small and can obviously be missed. \u00a0The place is very small as well, but they do offer a few dining seats outside which is nice.My boyfriend and I came here on a Monday night and luckily for us, we caught them during their happy hour. \u00a0Happy hour for them is nightly from 3 to 6 pm and all night long on Mondays. \u00a0I love happy hour!! \u00a0Unfortunately, their happy hour menu is very limited. \u00a0Normally, I go crazy on happy hour specials, but there wasn't a lot that I wanted to try; just ended up ordering the chipotle deviled eggs and the victory club nachos. \u00a0From the regular menu, we ordered \u00e0 la carte cordero, mahi mahi, asada, pork belly, and shrimp & scallop tacos. \u00a0We also had the churros for dessert.My favorite taco was the cordero taco which was made with braised lamb shank and a corn, cheese & cilantro salsa. \u00a0It was an explosion of flavors in my mouth. \u00a0It is also one of the more pricey taco, but so worth it. \u00a0Second runner up is the shrimp & scallop taco. \u00a0The shrimp and scallop were perfectly grilled; it had a nice crisp to it. \u00a0The other tacos were okay. \u00a0The pork belly taco, in which they are known for, \u00a0was a bit too tangy for me and I am not a big fan of eating chunks of fat. \u00a0As far as the happy hour specials, the deviled eggs were alright; nothing special. \u00a0However, we did enjoy the victory nachos. \u00a0The house-made chips for the nachos were prefect, the pico de gallo was fresh, and it had a generous serving of barbacoa meat on top. \u00a0The churros looked good, but was actually pretty plain. \u00a0Even with the mexican chocolate dipping sauce, the churros wasn't sweet enough for me.Overall, there were more items that was just okay than spectacular. \u00a0I definitely think I over hyped myself for this place. \u00a0My boyfriend thinks we can get better and cheaper street tacos elsewhere. \u00a0However, service was good and it is a nice, upbeat place to hang out with your friends and maybe have some tequila & whiskey."], ["Justin W.", "What sets this hidden place apart is probably the in house made ingredients. Bloody Mary's - check. Margaritas - check. One sip of the Bloody Mary and you'll be ruined forever. No zing zang in this place. This is truly a foodies find. The tacos are small but packed full of punch. Two will probably suit the bill. The place is small and there's almost always a slight wait but your stomach will be rewarded by flavor explosion. Say it with me - FLAVOR EXPLOSION. \u00a0You did it pinche - down to the name. Most Americans don't even know what they're saying. But we do pinche. We are the elite, the proud, the strong ...foodies. Thank you for you F'n amazing tacos and margaritas."]], "Las Margs": [], "Tacos Acapulco": [], "La Fuente Restaurant": []}
