It seems to be a very regular crowd and it's nothing fancy. For the last year or so, my friend has made this their go-to gyros spot. So I had to finally try it out!The prices seem a tad high, but they do stuff the pita so generously full that you will have plenty of overflowing meat to let a friend try. The service is awesome and the food will leave you craving more. Mmm... they also have thick cut fries and another nice touch are the perfect tomatoes. I also have to add that I love when a place isn't shy about providing you with more sauce. I had devoured my tzatziki and before I knew it, our server was pushing two more little tubs of it towards us. She even gave me a to-go tub, rightfully saying \"you can't have leftovers without the sauce!\""], ["Adi G.", "I'm really torn about this place. On the one hand, the food is really good -- the pita is unbeatable and the eggs are top-notch -- but, on the other hand, their food is undermined by the consistently rude service. Two recent anecdotes to illustrate: A while ago, I was in for dinner with a friend. After placing our orders -- he got the spanikopita, which is a relatively inexpensive menu item -- he was told that he had to order something more expensive, otherwise he could not sit and eat with me.I ventured back earlier this week when my better judgement was overridden by my craving for a greek omelette. I wanted to order it to go, which their website says they allow. When I got there, they wouldn't let me sit down while I waited for them to take my order. That would've been fine if it were an order-at-the-counter situation, but it's not -- i had to stand over in a corner while I waited for a waitress to come take my order and then make my omelette. This might've made sense if the restaurant had been really busy, but it wasn't -- less than a quarter of the restaurant's numerous tables were occupied, so the refusal to let me sit or maybe offer me water while I waited struck me as off-putting. I've yet to have a pleasant experience with the staff here. I would really advise people to go to Pete's Kitchen a few blocks West instead. It's owned by the same people, and the food is equally good, but the service is consistent and much, much friendlier. TL;DR Mean people serving great pita.

The Greek dressing was nothing but oil...YUCK!The Gyro sandwich came with plenty of meat, but with half a tomato that was still intact with the stem...really? I should have saved my Feta and put it on my sandwich. There is no bottled water, but I can understand, I guess. To top off my experience, the cook and the owner (heavy set lady with dirty blonde hair), start arguing over hours worked for an employee (whom does not speak English).

I've never eaten inside the restaurant, but the staff has always been friendly in my brief interactions with them while picking up my food. The gyro meat is tender and flavorful and the pita is soft and delicious. Really the only drawback is the disparity between the \"hole in the wall/diner\" vibe of the place and the relatively high prices. I guess when you walk into a place that is a little \"divey\" you just expect the prices to match the atmosphere a little more. I always tip a few bucks even for takeout, but even without it's $15 (ish I can't remember specifics right this minute) for pita, gyro meat and french fries.

The atmosphere, service and food are all top notch and the Tzatziki sauce is mind blowing. The Gyro plate is one of the best food deals I've had in Denver so far. You probably can't eat it all, and it's all delicious. It starts with a nice sized Greek salad, that was perfect in flavor. Then you move on to the actual plate which is perfectly steamed veggies, fresh cut fries and the gyro meat and veggies with 2 half pitas.

All finger/fork-lickin' good. Side note: I hate anything oily, garlicky, or fried - much less all three - so this means a lot.Entrees were Chicken Shish Kabob and Lamb Shank. The lamb came in a bowl the size of an Olympic swimming pool, and the chicken skewers and rice could easily be lunch and dinner tomorrow. The chicken was incredibly tender and flavourful. Yum!The entrees come with a small plate of hummus, a side salad, and basmati rice. Again, all are fantastic. The side salad, something that is usually forgotten before you even swallow the first leaf - was actually incredibly good. I hate dressing, and this had a barely-detectable semi-dressing that was wonderful. It tasted so fresh and crisp. All of us were laughing at how we almost never touch these salads because they're so bland, but this one was truly lovely.Portions are HUGE - easily 2-3 meals, maybe 4 for me - and the prices are incredibly reasonable considering this (I thought they were already, even before the plates landed on our table).Run, don't walk.

A little overpriced and the drink refills are too slow for my liking but I have a feeling that the worst offending server won't be there much longer. Try this place out."], ["Mar S.", "Went on a Friday night and the place was dead. That should've been our first clue. I ordered the lamb gyros sandwich and my husband ordered the chargrilled lamb. My sandwich was not gyros but more of a lamb kabob. Both of our lambs were dry and the tzatziki sauce was watery and not flavorful. My husbands plate was small and cost an additional $2. The food is way too expensive, especially for the lack of taste, over-cooked, and small portions. We left disappointed and hungry."], ["Christine T.", "Please keep in mind this rating is based on fast-casual experiences, which was...impressive! Fresh, hand-made ingredients. Soft pita bread and great side options. I visited during their opening week at a slow time and received friendly service and well-executed food. The pesto in the chicken basil pita was freshly made and had a nice basil flavor; the grilled chicken was real chicken cooked well and had a nice flavor to it (not dry.) Great weekday lunch spot!"], ["Bryan L.", "Our first visit to Taziki's was fair. This is a fairly new neighborhood establishment. The waitstaff was very attentive and friendly while offering to answer any questions we may have about the menu. I ordered the Chicken Pesto Gyro with a healthy side. What I didn't know is the Gyro comes with crinkle-cut potato chips and it's not listed on the menu. Not a healthy choice at all... however I was able to substitute fresh cut fruit for .75 along with my other side. The seasoned new potatoes were good at first, but left me wanting something more flavorful. The fresh fruit was out of season, firm and bland. The chicken in my Gyro was only fair. I encountered an extremely long chewy piece of dry chicken that seemed completely out of place in comparison to other tender morsels. The waitstaff and other team members we met do get a passing grade, but sadly the food didn't match their positive attitudes. We'll give it a few months and try again."], ["Debby S.", "I'm a middle eastern woman and food snob and this place just doesn't cut it. Over priced for what the food is and no wow factor the grape leaves are stuffed only with sour yellow rice no meat no tomatoes no nada ;( overall don't plan to be back"], ["Courtney B.", "Meh. The gyro was pretty good, but small for $10! Served with potato chips... Hmm... Strange. I also go hummus which was good, but served with crunchy pita chips- not what I expected so I was disappointed. Overall, it's not bad, but disappointed enough that I probably won't go back."], ["JH D.", "Delicious...and I'm a food snob. \u00a0I was hesitant to try since it looks like just another chain, but it was really very good. \u00a0We had the Tilapia Fish Sandwich--tasty and perfectly cooked, the Med salad--big and full of fresh veggies, and the Veggie Wrap--good but I'm sure it would have been even better with fish, chicken or lamb (but we are vegetarians). \u00a0The portions were large, the entrees were yummy, the roasted potato side was so good, and the price was fair. \u00a0And like everyone else said, the staff was super friendly and the inside was cute for an order-sit style restaurant. \u00a0We will definitely be back!"], ["Kelly W.", "Dropped in to try the food not expecting much from a fast food kind of place. The service was great and the food was fresh and delicious. \u00a0Definitely will be back"]], "Vesper Lounge": [], "Citron Bistro": []}
