{"Sawasdee Thai Restaurant & Bar": [["Gina B.", "Fellow Yelper, Ron, recommended Sawasdee when they opened and that was like a million years ago I think. Seriously though, I'm not sure what took me so long to check the place out, other than I'm not generally over on Glenwood Ave that often.We were itching for a mix of sushi and hibachi and their menu was just the ticket. It's ridiculously extensive. To the point, Chef Robert Irvine would give them a strong talking to about food costs, but hey I appreciated the variety.We ordered soup, salad, a sample boat, and hibachi steak to split. While service was crickets..... slow, the food was delish! I couldn't complain about a thing. Everything was very tasty. The wicker seats were extremely uncomfortable though. Even my 6'6\" boyfriend looked like a midget in them. I stole a cushion from another chair just to try to get my head above the table. They need to be tossed in the trashed and the whole place needs a refreshing up in my opinion. The ambience doesn't do the food justice.Now it's not gourmet and I wouldn't go running to take your date there tomorrow, but it's solid faire I would go back to."], ["Jessie R.", "The four stars is just for the food. The food is absolutely amazing. From sushi to ramen. Everything tasted great. However if I can give stars for service, I would give it a ONE star. No one smiles or greats you. They just take your food and drops it off. Then they go back in the kitchen for a long stints of time. I waited for my check one time for 15 mins. There were only three other guests there. Every time I come here, I think I'm bothering someone. From carry out to dine in, they don't care. Good thing to food is great."], ["Lina M.", "Pad Thai chicken is good. I've had better but I get it every restaurants has their own recipe and way of cooking and Yaa I like it it wasnt on point but still good and didn't have to wait long. Their restroom is dirty and smells so bad I almost threw up."], ["Mikey B.", "Super good place. I like their pad thai, their sushi and I just recently had their ramen bowls which were so good. I always go for lunch, which it's great for, but it's a little too pricey to enjoy their food on the regular."], ["Joe B.", "I've been to this place a couple of times, and with my most recent visit, I was fully ready to give this place 4 stars. HOWEVER. I didn't anticipate this place being just as good as the other location on Capital Blvd.The food was really great quality. Upon my most recent visit here, I got the Spicy Tonkatsu Ramen, and my friend got the Pad Thai. I've had some amazing ramen in a couple of places around the world, and I'd have to say it definitely was a solid bowl of ramen. The Pad Thai was pretty flavorful, and the noodles weren't bland or undercooked (like I've had at some places). The Thai curry here is an excellent choice as well.Decor is quite nice, as it has a pretty chill, decorative tone. The service here is excellent, as well. I definitely plan on coming back. I feel like I'll start having dreams about that ramen."], ["Nancy T.", "They have good thai food for sure, but in comparison they definitely skimp on the portions. In recent months I discovered their ramen! The soup base of the tonkatsu is totally on point - full flavored and bold, definitely what ramen noodle soup should be for tonkatsu. My only complaint again is that it's a small bowl, with very little veggies and only one thin slice of pork that comes with it. You can add meat and veggies and things like that for an extra $1 or $2 so it adds up in price to be similar to the more expensive bowls of ramen at places like Sono or Buku. Their standard bowl starts right around $10. Another deduction is that their wait staff makes you do just that....wait. they are rarely a full house when I've gone and maybe only have 3 or 4 tables but man, they are super slow. I've been to better Thai places for sure so this isn't my f irst choice but at least their tasty food keeps me coming randomly."], ["Julia Z.", "It's a pretty delayed review...but this place is pretty good for Thai food. They recently added Japanese ramen, and they are pretty good, the portion is smaller than Sono, but also a buck cheaper if I remember correctly."], ["Melissa W.", "Nice place for a date night. I tried the Thai iced tea (delicious). We sat on the back side of restaurant, the chairs are actually really comfy and I felt like vip back there. It was like a private area. Staff were great. We were warned it was busy because of 3 big parties, but our food didn't take long to come at all. I got pad Thai, my husband got pho. Food was really good, staff was great, and I enjoyed the atmosphere. If my husband and I go again, we will probably ask to sit in the back section. I recommend trying this place."], ["Meaghan G.", "So I've been here a few times now and have yet to be disappointed. \u00a0Their Pad See Ew and Pad Thai are on point. \u00a0Some of their apps are on the smaller side but their soups do not disappoint as they are filled with fresh veggies and flavor. \u00a0I've eaten here a few times on my own and some with the hubs and regardless I have been treated with great service. \u00a0They do not rush you and there have been several times we've ordered food for last minute pick up with no complaints. Maybe if the outside looked a bit more welcoming they would be more packed, but regardless of the lack of curb appeal I keep coming back for more!"], ["Brie B.", "Thank god for lunch time! I've been here for curry. However, Today I decided to try the pad Thai. Maybe I'm used to the bold flavor in red curry?The pad Thai fell a little short today. It also had way too much egg and some wired white cabbage thing. \u00a0I will ask for it spicy next time. Other than that the food here is good. The red curry is awesome and spicy! I really like the bamboo in the curry. I must have been a panda in a last life. The rice is cooked well. If you're in the area try it during lunch time. The entrees are 7-9 dollars. My favorite Thai place is further from my house. \u00a0This restaurant is good for a quick fix. Please note that I only get take out. I can not comment on the service. However , I've never had to wait too long. They are very punctual."], ["Katharine D.", "I've dined in once and gotten take out on two occasions. The only negative I've experienced is not receiving enough rice on a take out order. Other than that- I am a fan! The staff are courteous, food is prepared in a timely manner, portions are more than satisfactory, and food flavors are delicious. They make very satisfying currys and noodle dishes. The ingredients seem top notch. FYI- When they say spicy- they mean spicy! I got a medium spice on the evil jungle noodles and had to break out the milk to mollify my mouth. A medium of a green curry dish wasn't quite as spicy (but still spicy). It's good stuff and fairly priced. Sawasdee is my go-to Thai restaurant in this area! Very satisfying!"], ["Carl K.", "Sushi was okay. Thai was better. They are a thai restaurant and should just stick with that. \u00a0They also need more staff."], ["Wood C.", "My girl and I have eaten here many times (as we live about 5mins away). The food is pretty good, and the service has been just above average.Unfortunately, this past Sat (9/26), service was freakin' horrendous. You really have to screw the pooch for me to say something like that. While I haven't been impressed by their service, there was nothing about it that detracted from overall past dining experiences. This night, it took 20mins for me to get a glass of wine, and we were constantly ignored by our primary server. Note, another server brought my wine over (only after we got her attention) because our primary server was always on the other side of the room.Nonetheless, I'm giving 4 stars because, normally, service is decent, and the food has always been good.I'm hoping our next experience includes much better service ..."], ["Heather M.", "I was thinking about giving this place 3 stars but the service was horrid.First off, we literally had to call for our waiter EVERY time we needed our drinks to be refilled.He was so sassy whenever he came to us, as if he was doing us a favor out of the goodness of his heart or something -_-It would have been one thing if they were super busy. Nope, it was just me (and my date) and another table of two at the restaurant.ALSO, every time we had to call on our server to fill up our drinks, he was busy either on his phone or chit chatting with his coworkers. I don't mind a server doing this if he/she has done the job (I've been a server before so I understand), but make sure our drinks are half full at the very least.Food was decent- they're not too generous with their portions.I got the pad nam prik paw with shrimp- although the sauce was absolutely delicious, they only gave me ~6 pieces of shrimp, boo hoo.The pad thai here is pretty good but on the drier side. Personally, I think Thai Villa has better pad thai...We also got the fried calamari and the spring rolls as our appetizers. The spring rolls had a weird smell and the sauce it came with didn't really compliment them...Oh but the fried calamari was yummy, especially with their sweet and sour sauce- but who comes to a thai place solely for fried calamari... hahaPlace was clean, food wasn't bad but I don't plan on coming back here.I will satisfy my thai craving elsewhere!!!!"], ["Jennifer B.", "Did not give 5 stars ONLY because Miso soup was so salty it was difficult to eat, wasted 1/2 bowl. Sushi was fresh & wonderful tasting! I have only found sushi this fresh in Fuquay-Varina at Kumo. Squid salad is served on a bed of lettuce, so ask for without if you don't like that way."], ["Julia H.", "Originally, I was trying to order take-out Ramen from here, but when I called they informed me that they don't do take-out for their ramen. So I decided just to come in to eat it.I went here by myself last week and sat at the bar. They were pretty busy and the hostess was a little frazzled so I sat myself. She made time to come over, greet me, and send a waiter for my drink order. The waiter was quite and efficient, but probably a little new because he didn't seem to know what I was asking for when I ordered.Although I originally came for Ramen, I ended up getting the tom yum noodle soup. Oh man. It was so good. I almost cried (probably out of exhaustion) because it was just exactly what I wanted. The lemongrass flavor was so delicate and balanced with the spice in the chili pepper. I would eat this over and over again. I also really liked the noodles in it as it made it a very hearty and satisfying meal. The waitstaff promptly brought my check when I asked with the to-go Thai Tea (not the best one I've ever had), but decent."], ["Raleigh Spicy Food M.", "This is the second time that we've had a Meetup here and by far the food is what brings up back. The service, although they are extremely nice and take good care of us, they can be slow. The food is always good and when they ask for a heat scale of 1-5 and you say 6 and then add some pepper oil to it the heat scale is pretty high! I've gotten the red and the green \u00a0curry and they haven't disappointed yet!"], ["Christine S.", "I give this place a 3-star because of the seasoning on the food. I went for lunch today with two of my girl friends. We ordered the Spicy Eggplant, Panang Curry and Pad Thai with basil! Everything was too salty for my liking, but the flavors were tasty. I like the Spicy Eggplant the best, but the dish did not have enough eggplant. Considering that eggplant is the main ingredient, there was about 5/6 pieces and the rest was veggies and chicken. I would've loved to see more eggplant since it's NOT even a lunch special portion. The Panang curry had coconut milk, not my favorite. overall, the service was good and the server was friendly. Pretty spacious location, good for family dinners.Worth a visit, only if you crave Thai and there no other place in the area... And if you really must satiate your craving for that food... Then go here."], ["Ash H.", "I placed a to go order and when I arrived to pick up the food, no one was by the hostess stand, soon a lady came to check me out, she seemed very rush and not friendly at all. When I notice there's no utensils, I asked her for some plastic fork and spoons and she literally threw them in the bag and walked away. I have never experienced such rude service. I ordered spicy crab fried rice and got regular crab fried rice, it taste plain but surprisingly they use real crab instead of imitation crab. Coconut soup is too thick.The pad see ew noodles had way too much vegetables and only a couple pieces of tofu, it lacks of flavor and Definitely not authentic. Over all, food is not bad but not great neitherService is horrible!The food is way over priced! Sorry to say I will not return!"], ["Monica W.", "Over the course of the years I have dined several times. \u00a0I love the Thai food and enjoy the experience for the most part.... but there is stops. Recently, last week a friend and I went in for dinner. \u00a0It was about 6pm on a Wednesday and the place was empty, there might have been 2 other parties in the entire place. \u00a0It was unkept, dirty seats and tables, stuff scattered around the bar area (where there was no bartender) with squeaky/wobbly booths and tables. \u00a0I ordered a glass of wine where there was clearly a lipstick stain from the previous use that had not been cleaned properly. \u00a0The server looked at it and didn't even say anything? \u00a0Our food came out fairly quickly and tasted delicious! \u00a0There are plenty of options for any person on the menu. The portions are more than enough to take home another meal. \u00a0I have been to the other location and had better experiences. \u00a0I just hope this place can clean up a little bit and survive because they truly have great food."], ["Holly D.", "I am surprised Sawasdee doesn't get at least 4 stars. We dined in the restaurant one night and our server recommended a regional curry that is not served at any other restaurant in the area. It was topped with a pile of fried onions. It was SO delicious. Possibly the best curry I have had. It is not listed on the online menu, but ask about it in the restaurant. \u00a0Our other dishes were also done perfectly. \u00a0We returned for takeout the next week. both experiences were flawless."], ["Andrew W.", "I'm mad at myself for leaving this on the \"to try\" list forever. On a Monday night around 8:45pm, barely anyone was in the restaurant. They supposedly close at 9:30pm on weeknights, but that's around the time we left and the neon \"Open\" sign was still on. A couple regulars walked in right before we left, and the waitress knew their orders without having to ask.I'm a big guy (35\" waist, 6'6\" tall) and didn't find any problems with the booth we were in. Maybe they gave us a bigger booth since we were two of four patrons at the time. By the way, the other two seemed to be enjoying one of the many alcoholic options Sawasdee has to offer. I'd normally go with a Thai iced tea, but it was a little too late in the evening for that.We started with a couple of spring rolls with sweet chili sauce. The sauce was very light, almost too light, but definitely added something. For entrees, we both went with noodles. Going with Ron's recommendation, I had some very tasty, but not so spicy, drunken noodles. My girlfriend went with the traditional Pad Thai (which was amazingly her first time ever having Pad Thai). Her portion was very large, which left me with lunch the next day. My portion was a little smaller, but definitely more than enough food. if you want spicy noodles, you're definitely going to have to ask them to bring them up a level or two.The only strange thing was when it came time to pay our bill was 12 cents shy of $30. We had a coupon from a mailer to save $5 on $30 and the waitress said we had to order something else (that's pretty extreme enforcement of the coupon in my opinion!). They were out of banana rolls, so I just got some coconut ice cream to go ($3). It was fine, but I'd rather have a cone across the street from Fresh!Anyway, that won't deter me from coming back. I'll definitely be eating here at least once a month due to its proximity to my house. The location isn't the greatest (it's a little bit of a maze to get there), but I overhead that they are very busy on the weekend. So, it looks like people are finding this place and coming back... and with good reason!"], ["Ben W.", "The Cashew Chicken was delicious. Asked for it extra spicy and they delivered. Springs rolls tasted very fresh and were hand rolled right when we ordered them. I was a little disappointed in the atmosphere. I was looking for something more...fancy and upscale. It was a Tuesday however, so that's definitely a factor in the number of patrons Overall a very delicious restaurant for some Thai food!"], ["D S.", "I'm a sucker for Thai, so it gets above average rating from my bias. My favorite is Yum Woon Sen - for some reason missing from many Thai menus but not theirs! \u00a0Here for late lunch, place was empty, food prepared well, and their curry on the Salmon dish was excellent. \u00a0Will be back to try it again."], ["Nadine S.", "I have been here several times and the food is delicious. \u00a0 I especially recommend the spicy fried rice. \u00a0I get it almost every time. \u00a0The service could be quicker given that it's usually not too busy, but the food makes up for it."], ["Shira A.", "My family's favorite Thai and one of our go-to restaurants for an evening out. \u00a0 Kids love the pad Thai, and my husband usually orders one of the curries (Panang curry is delicious!). \u00a0I usually get the whole fried fish with the spicy sweet ginger sauce. \u00a0Makes my nose run and is amazing! \u00a0The last time we were there, I had a Thai mojito that was yummy (traditional mojito made with Thai basil). I liked it so much, I made it at home a few days later.Great value, convenient location, and consistently great food. \u00a0The atmosphere is nice, but not too fancy. \u00a0So glad to have found this restaurant!"], ["Ron W.", "It's always a challenge doing sequels when the original is so darn good. \u00a0Sometimes it works out well, like the movies Godfather and Godfather II. \u00a0Other times the sequel is not nearly as successful, think the Matrix and Matrix Reloaded. \u00a0Thankfully, Sawasdee Thai II doesn't disappoint, it delivers everything the original does, plus a bit more! \u00a0(Fellow Yelper David S. will hopefully have a review soon for this place :) What was some of the best Thai food in the Triangle now has expanded to two locations. \u00a0You can go to the cozy original on Capital Boulevard or go a bit more upscale on Glenwood. \u00a0Sawasdee II's new space is more traditional with lots of woods and nice leather chairs. \u00a0Although they've kept the signature yellow wall, the decor is more subdued and the location is way bigger. \u00a0They're still working on the place but it looks great right now. \u00a0Outside of some tight booths (seriously, you may not be able to get yourself out after a large meal), seating space has at least doubled. \u00a0They've also got a long u-shaped bar and what looks to be a party/private room. \u00a0Plenty of room to grow into and it all feels comfortable. \u00a0The food is just as tasty as before, I ordered some spring rolls and chicken pad thai. \u00a0Portions were largish and the pad thai was well done: just the right amount of sweetness, large pieces of chicken with the peanuts and bean sprouts on the side. \u00a0Service was VERY good and attentive, thanks to a great waiter. \u00a0I'll be back soon but for now I'm moving my five star rating over to this new location. \u00a0I think you'll find it's the same great thai food in a nicer, more spacious environ. \u00a0It's always a pleasant surprise when the sequel lives up to or outdoes the original and I'm glad to say that Sawasdee Thai has pulled it off!"], ["Jeff S.", "Great Thai food!And they have a good Pho! Seriously, they can make a good Vietnamese soup.My wife and I like to stop by here for lunch. $8 gets you an appetizer and meal from the lunch menu.The curry and noodle dishes are all really good.I still have a warm place in my heart reserved for Thai Villa off of Buck Jones, but if I had to recommend a Thai restaurant, this would probably be the one."], ["Perry H.", "Luckily my wife got the hankering for some Thai food Saturday night and a quick Yelp search popped-up Sawasdee. \u00a0I've never been a fan of the strip mall restaurant but please don't let the location get you down. \u00a0This spot is tremendous and I can't wait to return (I might actually do so tonight - just writing this review is making my mouth water.) \u00a0 For a Saturday night the place wasn't too busy. \u00a0We were seated at front, in almost a cafe-like setting, with oversized comfy chairs (almost too big and cushy to wrestle-up to the table.) \u00a0Even still we ordered and promptly received our appetizers. \u00a0The pork dumplings were very good but the tom kah was superb. \u00a0I actually had to keep myself from turning up the cup to get every last drop. \u00a0Sadly, \u00a0I think my spoon left one tiny drop in there...For dinner I had the Amber House Curry with shrimp which was out of this world. \u00a0Served in a bowl with an ample amount of shrimp the curry had the perfect medium heat with just a zip of lime. \u00a0Perfection. \u00a0It was served with a side of rice which was in the shape of a fish...how cute. \u00a0My wife had the pad thai chicken which was good, not the best I've had. \u00a0I would probably rate it 4 stars if I had this dish but my curry put it over the top. \u00a0Definitely can't wait to get back and try this spot again. \u00a0I hear the one on Capital is very good as well, just smaller/more intimate. \u00a0Great service, good fresh, all natural food, with ample portion size. \u00a0Love it!"], ["Karthik N.", "I have known people who rave that Sawasdee is sensational and brilliant. I frankly don't see it. Full disclaimer: I'm vegetarian, and maybe they do something special on their meats or fish. I mean, don't get me wrong, their food is good. I may even have rated them 3.5 if I could and if not for the hype. It's just pretty commonplace - not that different from any other good Thai restaurant.

This location is slightly better placed than the Capital one, but it's still not the greatest for incidental patronage. \u00a0Similar to their capital location, the interior gives me the impression that it was put together by one of the worlds most talented, and most frugal, interior designers. \u00a0There's just something about the decor that whispers it's age and pre-use, from behind a deceptive veil created by elements that come within a hair's breadth of matching perfectly. Despite all of this, I give this place 5 stars, because their food is downright delicious, every freaking time we go. \u00a0Not just delicious. \u00a0It's a kind of addicting deliciousness. We go and we just want more. \u00a0Their dishes are FULL of flavor. \u00a0The Tom Kha soup is wonderful and warm and creamy with a twangy flavor. \u00a0The Pineapple Curry is sweet and spicy, and awesome. \u00a0The Chicken Satay is a fun, nummy appetizer to get, and one that will probably even make your kids happy.My personal favorite is the Drunken Noodles with Chicken. \u00a0I don't think I've ever had a dish like it anywhere else. \u00a0I'm not quite as adventurous as my girlfriend Leslie C, and the Drunken Noodles were the perfect gateway dish to Sawasdee's menu. \u00a0It's got a lot of familiar elements in it, but a flavor like no other. \u00a0If you're not usually into the more \"authentic\" Thai dishes, this is a great one to try.After many regular tests, I can tell you with confidence that the food is consistently awesome. \u00a0Don't let the outside fool you, this is a gem you have to try!"], ["Geralynn O.", "3 stars...Not because the food wasn't good. I actually thought the food was great, which happened to be the panang shrimp curry. I am giving 3 stars because the amount of food that was given was not even worth the expensive price I paid. I ordered my food to go and the quart-size container that holds the curry wasn't even filled halfway. I'd say the amount that was in the container was maybe 1.5 cups (?). And this was the dinner portion. I paid almost $20 for that! Not cool. I could've driven down the road and bought about $10's worth of McDoubles just to get full (not that I even eat THAT much to get full). I'm just saying that they should have given me the amount of food for the price they made me pay...which beat my debit card with a baseball bat. I sat at home eating my panang curry while thinking of other take-outs that seriously could've filled me up for less than what I paid at Sawasdee."], ["Renee S.", "In a delusional world I said playfully to the restaurant, \"We've been talking about you. All good things, I promise.\" I typically have all my marbles and don't routinely talk to inanimate objects, so this didn't technically happen, but when Groupon offered $25 for $12 I jumped on it, and somehow I had a $10 Groupon credit, so I got $25 at Sawasdee for $2. Score! I'm taking my girls to dinner! Sawasdee suffers from a slightly ugly location in a nondescript strip mall with Starbucks, Marshalls, Ross, and a few other big box dandies. Exterior musings aside, the interior is warm with opposing but complimentary (quite Yin and Yang, eh?) Asian modern decor. The spacious dining room had many tables with contemporary red leather dining chairs but in one corner they have a little restaurant retreat of sorts with plush, lightly colored banana leaf furniture. \"Oh can we sit there?\" I squealed with delight pointing to the plush banana leaf settee, table, and chair configuration. Happily seated in our banana leaf retreat, we ordered two orders of fresh spring rolls, one veggie with tofu and the other with shrimp. For entrees Liz ordered one very spicy Pad Thai that had lots of fresh veggies. Cassie ordered my new Thai go to, Drunken Noodles with pork - they didn't have the usual drunken noodles flavor - the spicing and flavoring was similar to that of the Pad Thai. I ordered the Bangkok Noodles with chicken which were disappointingly reminiscent of a soup with a few noodles drowned in the bottom of the bowl. \"Where are the noodles?\" were my exact words as I pushed around the bits of chicken and veggies in an opaque curry broth. I felt Sawasdee was average for presentation, flavor, and service. Nothing to set it apart, no real 'wow' factor - It just wasn't amazing, but it was far from terrible as well. I would be willing to try some of my other Thai favorites like Spicy Basil. Every decent dish deserves a second chance..."], ["Sarah S.", "Food is alright, but too expensive for what it is.

No one came so I reluctantly searched around for a table and sat down. Finally someone came out and asked if I was by myself. I said yes. Then they proceeded to tell me that people dining alone need to sit in the other section. So I went over there and waited some more. Most of the tables were open and there were dirty plates on almost all of them. Seemed kind of dirty in there. \u00a0I chose the least dirty table. Probably wouldn't have stayed but I was so so hungry. Eventually a guy came out with a menu and said \"sorry, didn't know you were here\".

This made me excited for sushi, so I ordered a couple rolls. \u00a0I ordered a shrimp tempura roll and a spider roll. Pretty common rolls figured they were a safe bet. The order came out fairly quickly. The rolls weren't bad, I ate them because I was so hungry, but they were FAR from great. Would've rated this one star, but I tacked on an extra star, because at least they had BOGO sushi and the location being so close to Trader Joes is great!

They get all their produce fresh from the Grand Asia Market down the street and you can taste the quality. BEST dishes to get:1. Thai Villa Noodles - Excellent flat noodles with a delicious sauce and veggies. 2. Pad Thai - I have yet to find a restaurant that has a better pad thai.

I could drink this like a soup.5.

Instead a younger man kept up on my service, refreshing my water and eventually giving me my check. In retrospect, the food was delicious. My order of Pangan Jae was delivered in a timely fashion.

Absolutely awesome!Now for the actual food, I usually order the Thai Villa Noodles, which kinda tastes like Drunken Noodles. It tastes great! The only other entree I've tried is the Ka Pow and I like that as well. The only thing I can really complain about is the Thai Iced Tea. I'm not a fan. I don't usually like it when it's already pre-mixed with the cream. I think it tastes better when they're kept separate until the moment you're ready to drink it, but that's just me.Decent prices, good service, and fast take out.

I have gotten take-out here several times now so this review is my overall impression for the past year or so. First, the staff and owner has always been friendly and accommodating on making changes to standard dishes- no complaints there - excellent! Second, the seating and facility is nicely laid out with larger windows and high ceilings making the dining area bright, open and inviting. \u00a0 It is a nice place to have a relaxing meal. Third, the location is convenient and easy to find. \u00a0Areas for improvement are below: \u00a01) Price - some of the dishes, especially the appetizers are overpriced. \u00a0Come on, Fresh Spring Rolls clocked in at $7.25 and these were not what I was expecting for a fresh spring roll. \u00a0These were not wrapped in the translucent rice paper and they had also been sliced up into 1/2\" strips which made them impossible to pick up, dip and eat without making a mess and crumbling in your hands. \u00a0I finally just gave up on the dipping part and used the fork. \u00a0I've never had \"fresh spring rolls\" served like that.The main entries also seem to clock in slightly on the \"high\" side for Thai in this area. \u00a0Not unreasonable but just enough high to catch my attention. \u00a02) Taste - Is OK but not exceptional - at least not the dishes I have tried. \u00a0 While the \"Wild Curry with Tofu\" was OK, it did not knock my sock off. \u00a0As others have said, many items are bland or toned down. \u00a0Maybe it because they are accommodating local tastes. \u00a0 To be fair I have not asked for \"extra spicy\" so maybe that's key or \"native Thai..\" My impression of the food was that it was well prepared, just more toned down than I like. \u00a0 Enjoy."], ["David W.", "Absolutely delicious Thai food. \u00a0 Great service. \u00a0 Good portions. \u00a0Amongst the best thai I have ever had."], ["Britt Z.", "Tom Yum Thai is my favorite Thai restaurant that I've tried thus far. \u00a0The restaurant is \u00a0clean and the staff is pleasant. \u00a0 I often get the spring rolls, tom kha soup, and the pad thai with chicken. \u00a0The spring rolls are your standard roll, but the stars are the soup and main dish. \u00a0The Tom Kha soup is so delicious that when I swallow each sip, I feel like it gives my stomach a nice warm hug. \u00a0 \u00a0I've also joked that the pad thai must be sprinkled with crack because I find myself craving it time and time again! \u00a0 \u00a0The portions of the pad thai are enough for 2-3 meals, so you absolutely get your money's worth!If anyone is a thai lover or has never tried it, this is definitely the restaurant you want to visit!"], ["Kimberly P.", "Absolutely delicious!!

I thought that took real pride of ownership, showed passion for his customers so I went. Started out good. Sushi selection was good. Decor and cleanliness seemed nice. Menu items were authentic as you get here stateside. I ordered the tempura shrimp roll and the tempura vegetable roll. They looked interesting. Tempura shrimp was a little on the bland side. The vegetable roll was awesome. Great flavor. So I'm happy. Thinking of ordering one more. A roach falls out of the ceiling on the guy at the end of the bar. Not good. Ok I think. I'm from Florida.

Not sure what that thing was but I thought spider when I saw it and it was big. Holy crap. I had ordered a vegetable tempura. I couldn't finish. My stomach was in knots. Not happy. Uncomfortable.

With that said, there are a lot of places in the triangle where I can get good sushi.

So when we had to wait ten minutes for the hostess to seat us, I brushed it off. I noticed there were only two waiters, but there was also only 3 tables full, so I think the wait was a little excessive. Once we sat, we waited another 15 minutes for someone to take our order. The food didn't take so long to come out, but by the time it finally got there I was starving after smelling all the delicious smells. Too bad, my pork yakisoba only smelled good. There was almost no flavor. I had to douse it with soy sauce. Also, no one ever refilled our drinks.

I based my \"try out\" on previous reviews, so I had high hopes. A Friday night, I called at 6 PM for a take out order. The young lady took my order, name & phone number. She told me it would be 25 minutes & she'd call me when it was ready. I had gone to nearby Home Depot & didn't realize the time til I looked at my phone. It was 6:40 & no phone call. I called the restaurant & the girl said they had tried to call & got a message that \"this wasn't my phone number.\" I was puzzled, because I wasn't having issues with my phone & it never rung. I told her I was on my way to get my food.When I got there, it was sitting on a back table behind the register - I can only imagine how long it had been sitting there. I asked the lady what happened & she repeated the same story, as she's pointing to the receipt with my correct phone number. \u00a0I paid for my food & left - $28.50 for shrimp & steak hibachi & a firecracker roll.When I got home (five minutes away), I opened the bags. The lettuce on the salad looked sad, much like some of the bagged salads you get at the grocery store. The sushi looked good, but the asparagus in it was very overpowering, even with dipping in soy sauce. The fried rice was very odd tasting & basically tasted just like brown/white rice. The steak, shrimp, broccoli, onion, zucchini, & mushrooms were all together swimming in sauce. The shrimp had a very fishy/right out the ocean taste. The steak was actually pretty good, although a few pieces weren't very good. The onions were more like onion \"petals.\"I know all Asian restaurants are different & prepare things different ways; however, I wasn't pleased with the taste of anything I got.

We ordered chicken wings and beef negimaki for appetizers. Beef negimaki was cold and the meat was rubbery. Chicken wings were super tough and inedible. Very poor quality meat. I was hoping the meal would be saved by the sushi we ordered as our main course. I like sushi and have eaten at a bunch of local spots. This place is not good. Sushi was not fresh at all. I ordered sashimi yellowtail and some tuna as well as some specialty rolls. Either they serve different sushi at the sushi bar or those people have no clue what good sushi is.

Based on my meal alone, I probably would have given it fewer stars. However, as a whole, I think this place deserves the four stars. Let me explain.We decided to try this place earlier this evening, since we were planning on going to the Whole Foods up the street afterwards. We got there around 5:15, and as a result had no wait. We were seated immediately, and the waitress was attentive and helpful without being overbearing. My fiance tried a new sake that he liked; I got hot tea and water. I liked the fact that I got my own teapot for the tea.Fiance ordered sushi; his order came out first. He got a variety of fish, said it was fresh and tasty. I ordered the Tokyo House Clay Pot dish, with tofu and veggies. I will say, it was a lot of food. It was flavorful, although a bit salty, and I couldn't finish it. Brought it home for the fiance to finish. Here's my issue--I cannot prove it, but I suspect that the clay pot dish I had has a TON of salt in it, or possibly even MSG. I'm having some side effects that could be attributed to MSG overconsumption. I don't know if that's truly the issue, and I do realize some Japanese food has MSG in it. However, I haven't been feeling very well since we got home. I'm sure it will pass, but I personally would be hesitant to return to this place (since I don't like sushi at all) purely based on this experience. If you love sushi, I don't see why you wouldn't like this place. If you avoid sushi like I do, choose your meal with a bit of caution if you're sensitive to high levels of sodium. I would return to this place, but most likely choose something else off the menu. I had no complaints about the service, our wait times, or anything else...until I started feeling unwell. That's my cautionary tale."], ["Charlotte B.", "We love this place for lunch. My husband and I regularly meet here for lunch during the week.

There was too much going on at one time, too many flavors for one sushi roll. I prefer simpler flavors. Nonetheless, for what it is and for its uniqueness, I still give it 4 stars. It was also incredibly filling, but expectedly so for a roll that's nearly $13!Verdict: Tokyo House is one of the best places in Raleigh to get sushi.

I ordered some gyoza with some sushi rice. \u00a0The gyoza were quite flavorful, pan fried to have just the right amount of crunch without being overly so. \u00a0The pork was well seasoned and it worked well with the sauce and my side of sushi rice.We ordered green tea and our server came out with two full cups and a tea pot. \u00a0Fresh green tea leaves were in an infuser bowl in the top of the pot. \u00a0They also have free tea pot refills so I was stoked. \u00a0We ordered a bottle of the Sho Chiku Premium Ginjo to start the dinner off well. \u00a0Smooth with a subtly sweet flavor. \u00a0On to the star of the evening...Sushi. \u00a0 David appears to be the primary sushi chef here and he has one assistant who seemed to be focused on putting the rolls together incorporating the fish that David cut. \u00a0We ordered sashimi white tuna (escolar), salmon, yellow tail and tuna. \u00a0We also ordered a Rainbow roll, Scary Jerry, spicy tuna and a Minwoo roll.Brit loves her white tuna so she saved a couple of the sashimi slices for dessert. \u00a0If you like Toro this is as good if not better. \u00a0It's also called butter fish, because of how it melts on your tongue. \u00a0All the fish was fresh and flavorful. \u00a0The pieces weren't too thick and weren't too thin. \u00a0You can't beat the price point on the sashimi here either. \u00a030%-50% cheaper than other more notable restaurants i.e. Mura, Sono and Waraji. \u00a0The rolls that we ordered were also very well put together and had plenty of fish. \u00a0The Rainbow roll is standard in all sushi restaurants. \u00a0This one had white tuna, salmon, eel and yellow tail on the outside and was utterly delectable. \u00a0The Minwoo roll is a mixture of spicy tuna, \u00a0salmon and yellow tail, avocado and tempura bits on the inside. while on the outside is a layer of white tuna and avocado which he crisps up and then layers on a couple different types of roe. \u00a0Wow what a flavor and texture combination this was. \u00a0Crunchy, sweet, salty and smooth. \u00a0The Scary Jerry is a \u00a0concoction that's been around for a few years and all I can says is you have to try it to fully appreciate it. This is one of those rolls that has a pile of more things placed on top. \u00a0The roll is the crunchy roll with scallops. \u00a0So tempura bits with scallop and smelt with a shrimp exterior. \u00a0Then dolloped on top of each roll slice is \u00a0a mix of spicy yellow tail, tuna and salmon with a small slice of avocado to help turn down the heat. \u00a0I highly recommend the Karatamba sake that we ordered three bottles of after the Sho Chiku. \u00a0It had a wonderful nose, sweet but not overly so and if you can describe a filtered sake as being thick on the tongue it was. \u00a0It had an almost caramel (think bourbon) taste while being \"ricey\" and smooth and had a clear finish. \u00a0Service was on point with us not wanting for anything the entire night. \u00a0No empty tea glasses, or pot for that matter nor any issues with getting our plates cleared or our sake bottles replaced. \u00a0What a great sushi, scratch that, what a great overall experience. \u00a0We'll definitely be back."], ["Daisy J.", "I never imagined a place like this would exist until I step foot in there for the first time.

She was clearly a regular, too. And the people there knew her, made her feel welcome. I'm a downtowner, and I don't usually like traveling so far out, but I'd totally go again. I ordered two rolls. The Honeymoon roll is \"Eel, cucumber & Japanese min leaves roll w. sweet eel sauce.\" Very tasty, kind of unusual... not amazing, but definitely good. These are fairly small in size. I loved the mint. The AMAZING OMG roll I got was the Minwoo Roll - \"mixture of spicy tuna, salmon and yellowtail, avocado and tempura bits with torched white tuna and avocado outside, finished up with fish roe and special sauce.\" I would make a special trip back just for this one.

I'm sure Chinese food in China probably doesn't taste like what I'm used to). For years, I wouldn't eat it at all. That changed after discovering Restaurants that have both an American menu and a 'traditional' menu. Red Pepper is one such place. I got the ma po tofu (a dish that's hard to find at many Chinese restaurants here). It was delicious and had a slight spicy kick (though not super hot so you don't necessarily need to avoid this dish if you're not a spicy food fan). At ten bucks for a huge serving, the price was right too.

I asked for it extra-spicy and it was good. Standard American Chinese version with a little extra spice. But my wife wasn't blown away by her dish at that meal. Last night, visited again and was excited about trying more of their menu. My take: Fried Calamari appetizer: good, but kind of bland. Easy to overpower with soy sauce or duck sauce, too... with just the right dash of seasoning, it was very good, but it was very bland the way it came out of the kitchen. Fried dumplings: OK. Again, very bland. They get points for not using a super-thick wrapper, but lose points for the lack of distinctive flavor. Finally, I ordered off the \"traditional\" menu (or whatever they call it) for my entree, and was very disappointed. I got the beef with chilies, and it was just a mess. Way too many scallions, IMO, and the scallions, onions and peppers were diced into ridiculously small pieces. With all these different flavors, the dish still didn't have any predominating flavor and it just tasted like a bunch of stuff thrown together. I liked it less and less as the meal progressed, and neither finished it nor took home the leftovers (this is, I should mention, completely unprecedented for me when it comes to Chinese food).

I started with the Tom Kha Gai and found it thin and lacking in the flavors you'd expect: kaffir lime, lemongrass, galangal, ginger, and coconut. Even punching up the lime and pepper would have helped. Moved on to the Basil Duck as it was recommended by Yelpers. Again, pretty bland. No heat, so little flavor that it was more like average Cantonese than Thai. A shame as it was prepared well but for $20, should have been much better. Maybe the cook had an off night so I'm giving benefit of the doubt and 3 stars instead of two."], ["Amy H.", "It was hard for me to decide between a three star and four star review for this place because thai house isn't consistent in their quality. When it's good, it's excellent. On some days though, the quality is significantly lower than what it is on the best days. It's better than a lot of Thai options in this area even on it's weaker days but that's not necessarily saying much.the panang curry is my go to dish and it tends to be good even on Thai House's less than stellar days. The curry is rich, complex and they will actually make it spicy (many places here skimp on the spice). I get it with tofu which also helps with the sometimes hit or miss nature of this place. Ordering meat dishes is a little bit more of a gamble. This isnt a huge issue for me when it comes to entrees because I actually prefer tofu with curry but one of my favorite thai appetizers (the num tok) has steak in it. Sometimes this appetizer is delicious, sometimes the meat is tough, poor quality and over cooked. I don't order it often now since I never know what I'm going to get.Similarly, service is hit or miss as well. The owners are very nice, friendly people so I feel bad saying that but it's true. There gave been times I've come here with a big group and still been served efficiently but there are times I've come by myself and had to wait around an excessively long time while the waitstaff chats. You just never know.Part of me feels like I should've gone with \u00a04 stars because I actually am a regular here, despite my criticisms but inconsistent meat quality is kind of a big deal. Also, the last few times I went here weren't the best so sadly, it's possible that the decline in quality could continue though I certainly hope not.Basically, i do recommend you give this place a try, especially if you like vegetarian entrees but be careful about ordering meat dishes and don't go if you're in a hurry!"], ["Sherry H.", "Dropped in this spot today for a quick late lunch break while shopping in the area. Very clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. Was in the mood for soup so I got the Tom Kah Talay (Shrimp) and Thai Sticky Rice with Mango. Both were exceptionally good. I also got the Thai Spicy Basil Chicken and a side of fried rice to go. The fried rice might be the best I've ever eaten. The Spicy Basil Chicken was ok but not stellar, or spicy, although the waitress did give me some spicy chili paste to spice it up myself.

Then came our entrees, I ordered the roasted duck salad and my duck was incredibly dry and lacking in flavor. Parts of my duck were warm and the other parts were cold, which led me to believe that they re-heated it in the microwave. It was one of the most depressing salads I ever had. The portions of all of our entrees were really small and I'm not even a big eater! We are pretty floored by all the great reviews, but then again we've been spoiled by eating some of best Thai food in Thailand and in L.A.My friends ordered the pad see ew and panang curry and after they took a few bites, we looked at each other in agreement that this is not even remotely what Thai food should be like. My friend said that his panang curry tasted like watered down coconut milk with just a hint of panang paste.Not only were we let down by the food, the service needed some serious overhaul. Our water cups were never once re-fill and napkins requested were not brought over until the end of our meal. There were only 2 tables besides ours, it wasn't like they were swamped with patrons.

It was medium busy but we were waited on and seated quickly. The staff was superb, very young, polite, and pleasant. We loved our food and give it 5 stars. The decor was lovely too, very clean yet more Thai folksy then trying to have a highfalutin look. Summer rolls to die for, delicious yum nua, red curry chicken soup to die for, and Thai basil duck (our waitress' favorite and her recommendation that we took) that was off the charts. I have been staying away from fried Thai but my wife ordered (fried) spring rolls and they were both a) not greasy at all, and b) the best tasting I have had.

I was thrilled that they had avocado in the curry a few more slices would have been nice but I love avocado in my curry. I also had a Thai iced tea no complaints there.The lunch came with a salad and was just under $12 with tax.

I visit Yelp for some info on my local options. I had heard Sawasdee was good, but Thai House was closer, and after all, it had 4 stars! What could go wrong? 92 reviews and 4 stars, it has to be good, right?Wrong. Very, very wrong.The exterior was charming enough, with unlit Christmas lights dangling loosely from the front edge of the roof. I entered to a tastefully appointed dining area, and was greeted by a young hostess/waitress, obviously Thai, with only a rudimentary grasp of the English language. This excited me, for it spoke of authenticity, and I eagerly awaited a delicious and spicy thai experience.As I was seated, however, a problem become very apparent: the music. It was so damned loud. Let me begin by stating that they have a very well-equipped sound system. It is unfortunate, then, that they had it turned up to 11, and blasting Eminem rap music followed by other modern pop music at full blast the entire time I was there.So nerve-jangling. I wondered if they could really be so tone-deaf as to subject the customers to this, and as I contemplated saying something, a brave table of four people, four heroes, really, requested that very thing. The waiter (a male Thai fellow, the only other waitstaff in the restaurant, which unfortunately meant that my waitress had to double up on hostess and takeout duties in addition to waiting my table. one can imagine the level of service I received.) obediently turned the damned music down.No sooner had he turned it down, then an elderly Thai lady whom I can only assume was either ownership or management emerges from a cleverly hidden door to an office right by the speaker and the front door. She looks around, cocks her head to the side, and then rushes to ramp up the volume of the music again. The following comical scene, faithful to the events that occurred:(Male Thai Waiter, rushing towards the front desk): \"No! No! The customer requested it. It's too loud for them!\"(Elderly Thai manager, with a confused and angry look on her face) \"WHAT!?! But can no hear! Too low! They no like music?!\"She was magnanimous enough to turn it down to half thje deafening level of before, while shaking her head in a puzzled and angry manner. I mean, how DARE the customers think they have a right to comfort, how DARE they think they're right. It's not as if THEY are the reason the business can exist in the first place. Obviously the lady never heard the phrase \"customer service\". What a joke.And as an aside, if you're going to be in the Thai restaurant business, please, PLEASE, just play the generic Thai karaoke muzak that no one understands but everyone can easily and pleasantly ignore. NO ONE wants to listen to Eminem, Maroon 5, Whitney Houston (I know I know, it was the unholy mixture of 90's soft pop and early to mid2000's radio hits) and other tripe at club-level volume.Enough about the music/service. What about the FOOD????NOW, onto the Food:First I noted just how freaking expensive their dinner items are. $12.99 for a plate of Chicken Pad Thai?!?!?!?!?!?!?!This must be amazing food, I thought to myself. Surely it must be mind-blowing at the cost for what amounts, really, to Thai street food.Well I must assure you, it was, by FAR, the worst Pad Thai I have ever had at a restaurant.Now, this is not to say that it was blatantly OFFENSIVE in taste and texture, but rather, that it had NO TASTE....none whatsoever. Instead of a spicy m\u00e9lange of Eastern flavors and aromas, I was greeted with a steaming platter of sweet, mushy, sticky noodles, with some limp, flavorless chicken bits and bean sprouts laid on top, and a wedge of lime.The plate was an enormous amount for one person, but still, $12.99??And I must repeat, it had ZERO heat. None. It lacked any flavor. I have had frozen chicken pad-thai from the supermarket that blows this restaurant's excuse for pad thai out of the water. They could have at least offered some Sriracha or chili sauce, anything to provide some flavor to this dish.I took two bites, decided enough was enough with this restaurant, and waited for my server to appear so that I could request my check, pay it, and then go get some sushi.Oh yeah, that's right, she's also the hostess, and the take-out girl. Silly me. The restaurant had maybe 5 tables. I do not understand why she chose to bus mine. I was her ONLY table. The Male Thai Waiter could've easily added me to his roster, what with the restaurant being so sparsely packed. But no, they chose the most awkward arrangement whatsoever. She got a stream of take-out people coming in (which I just don't understand. What is wrong with you, my fellow peoples of Raleigh? Have you no taste buds? We can do better than this.) I was never asked how it tasted, offered more water, just barked at in clipped English by the hostess after I finally flagged her down for my check. Pure Torture."], ["KK W.", "After my first few visits here I was delighted to write a positive review on yelp. I will say that after a few more visits, my opinion of the food has not changed: the food is very good. I tend to order the same things every time I come but it is always consistently good. However the service has gotten worse and worse. I tend to come during lunch, so people during other hours may have different opinions. Their lunch is always packed, but the servers are always overwhelmed. I always tend to get the same server, A woman who is so overwhelmed during the lunch hour that it stresses me out. I don't receive drink refills, I don't get asked how my meal was, and there's barely enough time for her to drop off the check. Most times I tried to pay the check upfront so I don't have to wait the extra 5 to 10 minutes for her to return with the paid receipt. \u00a0However after today's experience, this will be my last visit in a a while. The waitress took five minutes to come and take my order. Then when my food finally came it was all cold. My appetizer came out at the same time as my entr\u00e9e, and both were cold. I ate the entr\u00e9e because I was very hungry, but I couldn't ask for a new appetizer because I never was able to get her attention again. No refill either. I will give her credit, when I asked her to take it off my bill she didn't argue with me. But overall it's just such a negative experience. Maybe it's because years ago I was a server so when I see a server overstressed it bothers me more than it should.

The dumplings were so small and only 5. The dumplings were nothing to write home about - there was no taste. Which is odd because dumplings are supposed to be full of delicious flavors but was just meat. I didn't even taste a hint of ginger.

I also got an order of summer rolls, I think the price is a bit steep for just 2 rolls and they're pretty skinny. I could probably make a good 15 rolls for like $15 dollars worth of ingredients and it would be much fuller - so minus .5 star :(On my second visit I decided to try the Satay, Pad Kee Mao, and the fried cheesecake. I have to say again, that the satay for the price I was paying was not worth the quantity and I feel like it wasn't marinated that well - minus .5 star. But the peanut sauce that it came with was really good. The Pad Kee Mao did NOT disappoint. I hate it when restaurants load it up with tons of broccoli but they didn't do that here and I really enjoyed the gravy sauce! If you're feeling up for a little something sweet at the end of your meal, I suggest getting the fried cheesecake! It's SO GOOD - the only addition I would add to it is probably some ice cream!

Is the place busy Thursday through Saturday? Yes. There is little to no lobby (2 chairs and that's it) so you will frequently find people crammed in or near the door on those days. I can recommend reservations on those nights. The only weak area I can find is the dessert menu. That said I have never found an Asian restaurant with killer desserts so I subtract no stars for that. Besides, Goodberry's is just down the street next to the Hibernian and that's where you are going anyway."], ["Brett M.", "Went here on a Sunday at 7pm and it was packed with to-go orders moving out non stop.

I've been coming here for over 15 years and I have to say the quality has never changed the fish is always fresh and the pieces are way larger then other sushi restaurants in town.It's sad to say that I've never ordered anything but sushi here besides some of the appetizers like pork gyoza which is also amazing. You are not going to find BOGO here but what you are going to find is fresh Toro when in season and some darn good sashimi.This place hasn't changed one bit in 15 years and to be honest because they've done such a good job with the food I guess they don't really need to update much. However to bring in a new crowd it might help. The staff here is fabulous, they are well trained and extremely friendly. Some of my favorite rolls to get here are the spicy sushi roll (trust me it's not what you are use to in the other sushi joints around town) it's way better!! The Mary roll is delicious as well as the shrimp crunch roll, and spider roll. ( I use to have a roll here named after me back in the day that's how often I use to eat here - it's very similar to the shrimp crunch roll:)If you are looking for fresh fish this is your place I recommend sitting at the sushi bar and getting the whole experience these guys are awesome!A little update on the interior and this joint is all set"], ["Toni S.", "Great sushi! This place is always packed yet still very quick with take out orders! The hostess is so friendly and is always smiling.

Get there early!!!!We started off with a rainbow roll and it was extremely fresh!!! No fishy smell or taste at all, telling me how fresh the seafood is. The roll was extremely generous and tastyGot a small sake and it was good.. Didn't hit you hard like some sakes do..Dinner, my first time to all Thai places I get the pad Thai and talking to our waiter, who was fantastic, he was like, if you like it hot... Start hot and add to make it Thai hot.. Easy to make hotter, can't undo if it is too hot.. I could have done the Thai hot, but the hot was just perfect..8 decent shrimp and the pad Thai all mixed together which I prefer.. I hate just getting a bite of noodles or shoots..Best pad Thai in the triangle!!!Wife got a ginger meal and the ginger sauce they use was amazing.. Pretty sure I could just order a soup bowl full of it.Decor is your typical sushi joint... Very nice.. Definitely will be back"], ["Greg O.", "Finally tried this place and it did not disappoint. \u00a0It was packed and the wait staff explained the sushi would take a while, so that was not a surprise. \u00a0The fried tofu appetizers wer very hot and crisp, with a great dipping sauce. \u00a0All of the sushi rolls were very fresh and all had a great taste. \u00a0Got the mixed veggie dinner with steamed rice. \u00a0The veggies were some of the best veggies I've gotten at a Thai place, so fresh and crunchy. \u00a0I want to go back and try more rolls but went with the basic ones to get a feel for it there."], ["Rebecca F.", "We have been searching for a great sushi place, and unfortunately our search continues despite Sushi Thai Cary. Usually when a place mixes a few different cuisines we don't set our hopes too high, but we are just itching to find a good sushi spot still! (We recently moved from the Seattle area where sushi is abundant and we had several go-to sushi spots!)Anyhow, the sushi was better than some other places we've tried, but, for us, it would still be settling somewhat if we stopped our search here. The Thai food, though, did seem pretty good! We ordered a few noodle dishes in addition to a few rolls and those were something we could go back for.Overall, this spot is somewhat forgettable which is both positive and negative. It didn't stick out as a spot we never want to go to again, but it's not one we're going to crave any time soon.Also, note to those with small children, there is a sign inside that says to keep kids under control and to clean up after them...so, good for those without little ones perhaps? Kind of a turn off for those of us with little ones though (not that we let ours run wild in restaurants...some parents may, but many/most try their bests!)."], ["Gary R.", "Don't be put off by the generic strip mall location or the presence of the large Big Lots. Oh no. This is some legit food!! My wife wasn't overly hungry and only wanted to go out for something light. I, however, was more up for Indian or Thai food and doing a Yelp search, found Sushi Thai. A perfect blend for our dinner out! The sushi idea hit her hot button and I was able to get a full meal that suited my taste. And it SO met that challenge! I was a little skeptical at first - how could it be good at both sushi AND Thai? But one bite and I found out how. Yum.We started with the steamed dumplings and they were done to near perfection. My wife got an assortment of sushi and an eel maki roll (which she raved about!) \u00a0I went with what I always like to test Thai restaurants on - Pork Spicy Thai Basil. Theirs was superb! The flavors were all there and stood out the way I had hoped. The spice level, ordered Thai hot, was just a little less than I had wished for but I find that typical of most places who don't really want to give you Thai hot thinking you won't be able to eat it. I can. And I did - the heat was really good. Everything was incredibly tasty!The interior is well done and belies the bland exterior. The service was attentive without being annoying.

There was a good amount of people in here for this time of day and we were seated promptly. The pad thai we got was good and id definitely order it again but i might not go with the sushi rolls next time. I felt like they were overpriced for their size and my spicy scallop roll with nothing else came in at $10 which I thought was a bit much since it was so average. After later reviewing the menu I feel like if I returned id go for a boat because they seem to be the best deal in regards to what you get for your money. They also don't have a lunch menu just lunch prices that were still a bit more steep then expected. We spent $65 for lunch which to me was nuts for this place. Service was friendly and the boat they have built into the sushi bar makes for some pretty awesome decor."], ["Ines P.", "Returned to see if the service and food would redeem themselves..... AFTER ONE HOUR TEN MINUTES we got our less than stellar food. They served us after everyone else.. We saw people come and go.. They blamed the delay on tempura. Out of 4 people, 2 ate their meals.

I also got a tom yum soup with shrimp, this soup was so good. I would have been happy with a huge bowl of this as my meal. But anyway on to the sushi. It was so fresh tasting and the rice was perfectly prepared. Mine came with chicken teriyaki, I think the pieces were too large, and I would have liked a small dish of rice. My friend seemed happy with the tempura, she gobbled it up. I will certainly return to this restaurant but would get the soup and maybe a sushi only meal. Great service too from the wait staff."], ["Becca T.", "Tonight I ordered take out from this place to try it out after hearing so many good things. It was a disappointment for the money I spent. \u00a0I ordered the Japanese stir fry and the shrimp dumplings. The Japanese stir fry was alright, but it was something I could easily make at home along with a simple salad and a scoop of rice. My friend and I both ate only one of the dumplings before tossing them. \u00a0It was steamed well, but you could taste how old the shrimp was. It wasn't worth eating in our opinion. \u00a0So for about $20 bucks I got old shrimp dumplings and a simple stir fry. \u00a0Maybe it would have been better if I had ordered the sushi of a different dish, but I think I have wasted enough money there."], ["Michael B.", "This is a deceptively nice place. One might think an Asian fusion restaurant (they serve Japanese and Thai food) in a dated shopping center with a Big Lots would not be great, but you would be wrong.My order was excellent and spot on.

The sushi wasn't terrible .... didn't go home with food poisoning or anything drastic but was not compelled to go back again. While the ingredients were fresh, they didn't seem top notch either. I had a Philly roll and the salmon was of so so quality (I'm from the Pacific Northwest and know great salmon) and the sweet dragon roll (at 14.95!) wasn't anything to rush back for either. Both rolls were fairly large in diameter, sliced thin and weren't rolled well so fell apart easily while trying to eat them ... not a great trait for good sushi. The rolls were huge and while some may think that's a great thing, I'd rather have a smaller roll that is really fabulous quality/taste ... and 15$ for a roll is really getting up there but would gladly pay it for superior sushi - which this was not. When I go out for sushi I want that close my eyes, OMG kinda moment when I put the first bite in my mouth ... the kind of taste that days later you're still thinking about and can't wait to go back to again. For that, I'll have to go elsewhere"], ["Nataliya H.", "This has been our favorite restaurant in the past few years. However, after last night's visit, it's not anymore.

One thing to note is their idea of spicy didn't hurt me that much and it seems the level is determined by how many their red chilies they stir fry with your dish and not an actual seasoning or sauce.

When we sent it back they didn't want to take it off the bill. Then they offered 70 percent off. I had to tell them no, she didnt eat 30 percent of it, take it off before they would refund it.

Everything was really very good; perfectly seasoned and just hot enough.

I asked for some hot sauce and got a nice dish of three sauces with some hot pepper flakes, I loved this presentation and being able to make the dish my own. It was so good and hubby's dish was good too, however I thought his plating was awkward. His rice came in the shape of a crown and the plate was very small. Then the main dish came in a kidney shaped bowl, it wasn't big enough to put all the rice in, it was just not right. I am not taking a star off for this, I am taking a star off for the service. We came in around 7:30 on Saturday night and when we arrived many of the tables were occupied. But when we were brought our food, the restaurant had pretty much cleared out, except for two other tables.

As mentioned by other reviewers, the decor is a little eccentric and somewhat shabby, but hey, it is the food that matters. Tom Kha $4.45 (1 cup with chicken): The coconut soup was very rich and creamy, which I liked. It had a few small pieces of tomato in the dish. The tomatoes had a slightly off texture and taste about them. The soup also had 2 pieces of mushroom and small bits of chicken. It could have been much improved if it were served with more veggies like broccoli or more mushrooms. The soup didn't have as many herbs or spices as I am used to from other places. Pad Thai with Chicken $12.99: The chicken was pleasantly moist. The entree had huge pieces of chicken scattered throughout the dish. The noodles were slippery and wet. The dish is not as sweet as I have had at most places, so it didn't meet my expectations. However, if you enjoy a less sweet dish, this may be for you. I thought it was a little expensive for a Thai dish, normally I would expect it this dish to be around $9.95. Fried Soft Shell Crab Special $17.99: A disappointing dish. The special only came with 1 crab that was cut into fours and mounted onto a vegetable medley. The crab was cooked well but was drowned in a sweet and sour sauce. I do not recommend this dish. All in all, it was an okay experience. Staff was very friendly, decor was somewhat shabby, the food was a little overpriced, but tasted okay.

The chicken skewers were very juicy, but grilled with the exterior just slightly crispy. My boyfriend got the Drunken Noodles, and I got the Pra Ram Long Song (also known as Swimming Raja/Rama). Both dishes were excellent. Better than any thai food I've had in Nashville, and definitely on par with the Thai food in Seattle.Sewasdee is located in a little strip mall, quite frankly just judging from it's surroundings I was prepared to be disappointed.

Still at 5 stars, loved it!I also ordered the Fresh Vegetarian Spring Rolls which were ok but lacking compared to other places I have had them before. They were primarily lettuce which was a bit brown in certain spots, had an unusually thick rice paper wrapper, and only had one leaf of Thai Basil which in my opinion really ties fresh spring rolls together and makes them what they are. -1/2 star, these were not the most remarkable.Ambiance was quite unusual, a somewhat older establishment. Doesn't have the cleanest feel but that may have been because it was crowded and we were sat in the very back small room next to the curtain covering the bathroom access. No unusual odors but ambiance is important to me when I go out to eat and this one really was lacking. -1/2 star.I would definitely go back but probably sometime when it is less crowded so I can get a table toward the front and I wouldn't order the fresh spring rolls again."], ["Yuna C.", "Nothing special. \u00a0I have had Thai food all over the country and this was actually my least favorite. \u00a0Their definition of \"make me cry\" spicy was not spicy at all. \u00a0We started off with the Tom yum soup and it was mediocre. \u00a0There were two pieces of shrimp and large chunks of tomatoes. \u00a0Rather than having a clear spicy broth, it was a red broth with lots of spices. \u00a0Then I order the red curry since many of the other yelpers enjoyed it so much. \u00a0Again, the curry was not spicy and I had to ask for Thai chili or hot sauce. \u00a0They did not even have the Thai chili so I just added the hot sauce to my meal. \u00a0The chicken and veggies in the curry were cut up so large that it was inconvenient to eat. \u00a0I has to cut everything up before I could even eat it. \u00a0Way too much work for curry I would say.

From what I hear everything here is fantastic. Everyone I've ever been with has raved about their food. I always swear I'm going to try something new, but I get suckered into my old favorites 90% of the time- the Tom Yum soup, the Drunken Noodles (2 stars not 3, I'm a baby), the red curry. I do want to be adventurous, it's just that when you find something that's so perfectly done, it's hard to pass up the chance to have it when you get the chance! I love the colorful decor. It's dim enough to be relaxing and a romantic date spot, but colorful and cheerful enough to provide a really fun and authentic atmosphere. The only thing I knocked a star off is for the bathrooms. They are in the back, hardly separated from the BOH, and kind of dingy. Plus, as a female, any restaurant with less than 3 toilets means you're occasionally gonna have to wait, so I don't recommend waiting until you're desperate, haha. A couple of years back, when my kids were younger, a friend told me this place wasn't \"kid-friendly\". I've since realised that she meant that a) a lot of people in this place aren't going to appreciate anything but very well-behaved children infringing on their dining space, and b) if you've got a picky eater, you're SOL because they don't do a \"kids menu\" or \"chicken fingers\". However, if you've got well-behaved kids who appreciate a little spice, or if you're ordering takeaway, I still recommend it for kids.

I had a house salad and the Red Curry with shrimp. I'm predisposed to loving Thai curry dishes, so of course, I liked it. For me, what set it apart was the thickness of the curry. Some can be too watered down, but this had a nice thickness. Perhaps the waitress thought I was cute, because the rice came out in the shape of a heart. (Do they do this for everyone?). The house salad was OK at best, but really, who goes to a Thai restaurant for the house salad?

This is honestly quite surprising, as most other reviews are so glowing. The food was good, yes, but not \"ragingly spectacular,\" as other reviews may lead one to believe. I've had better in Raleigh. My concern is not with the food, however, but with the overtly discriminatory treatment I received here. As a person of color, I was treated differently than EVERYONE else at surrounding tables. I was asked if I was ready to order every 60 seconds (literally) for the first several minutes after arriving. After ordering my beverage, I went immediately to the restroom to wash my hands. Upon returning, the waitress was asking again for my order when she clearly saw I'd just returned. (I was literally sitting and picking up the menu.) After about three short minutes of perusal, once I did state that I was \"ready to order, please,\" she emitted a deep, shoulder-heaving sigh, flashed an \"I don't want to do this\" smile to a Caucasian couple, abruptly dropped the smile before turning to me, then dismissively took my order.Things got worse as the evening continued. My waitress told me they'd \"run out\" of the exact things I saw another table (a Caucasian couple) receive. Following this, she hid inside for the duration. The waitresses preferred to shout from the door to my outside table instead of coming tableside as for everyone else. My drink was never refilled once. Not one time was I asked if I needed ANYTHING once my meal arrived ... except a box. I was obviously still eating and stated that I did not need one, thank you. Even still, a few moments later, I was given it anyway -- along with the check -- while I was still clearly fork-to-mouth eating. (They didn't close for an hour and a half yet, so it was not that I was lagging.) I did request things, but never received them because the waitstaff all conveniently disappeared, or hurried away after checking on other tables while I sat unattended the entire time. One waitress only finally returned once she saw that I'd readied the bill. I was dressed with class, clean and neat, and am very mild-mannered/low-key by nature. I was courteous the entire time, even after realizing what was occurring. My point in saying this is that it was not my demeanor or behavior that spawned this treatment. As well, there were only four to six restaurant tables occupied -- including the inner and outdoor tables -- though there were three servers. So this level of service obviously did not occur because they were at all busy.If you're a Black american, I strongly recommend avoiding this restaurant. The racist treatment I received was amazingly disheartening, sad, and ignorant."], ["Sowmya R.", "This place definitely is among the top authentic Thai food restaurants.I had the usual flat rice noodles with chicken and vegetables and it was delicious...

The broth did have a good flavor. The most disappointing thing was when I asked for crunchy noodles for my soup and the waiter said there would be a charge. WHAT! That's like charging for crackers, or ketchup for fries! Thats crazy and I refuse to pay for a condiment. My daughters salad was mostly iceberg lettuce with a few shreds of carrot. The ginger dressing was good. My sweet & sour chicken was terrible. So overly sweet I could not eat it. The sweet & sour sauce tasted like a huge bottle of ketchup mixed with a lot of sugar. Not good. More pineapple, peppers and onions than chicken. My daughters pad thai was good except for the shrimp which were so overcooked they were like rubber.

Unfortunately I have a very mixed review. Brother had shrimp dumpling app and a bowl of soup and enjoyed. I ordered fresh spring roll which was good but when I asked for more classically served Hoision sauce (at least in every Thai restaurant I've been to in the States), I was given a blank stare. And here's the problem: the service. My brother ordered a glass of water and some tea. He was never served the water. I ordered a soda and was never offered a refill. I ordered the pad thai and am picky- I asked for the tofu, bean sprouts and scallions to be removed but I did want to add chicken (so I wanted chicken and shrimp). I agreed to pay more. The waitress went to get paper to write it down. My order had exactly 3 shrimp, which cost $5 btw, and tofu and a random sprinkle of scallions which I was able to move off. Pad Thai itself was ok but I was surprised that waitress didn't pick up on error. I would have brought it up to her except no one ever asked us how the food was or if we needed anything. Eventually they realized we hadn't been eating for a while and gave us a box and the check.Oh, and I won't order take out either from this place- man entered by himself and one waitress mistakenly thought he was there to pick up a to go order. He said no, he wanted to sit and order so she sat him at table next to us and she set to go order on the table with him to write down his order. And walked away leaving someone else's food with him. While we were waiting for them to still notice we needed boxes, we watched her continue to bring him drink and spring rolls all while leaving someone else's order on a stranger's table. I don't know why he didn't say anything, but I don't want to get food from them if they are that careless- it was still there when we left!

Out of our large group of about 10, almost half the people ordered the Crispy Pork Belly Soup -- the dish came with quite a reputation. I didn't order it since I'm not a fan of coconut broth, but found it really tasty. It has a rich, creamy flavor, probably from both coconut and pork belly. It's also a bit spicy and laden with cilantro floating blissfully through the noodles -- I've been told these are two \"good\" attributes in food... I thought about getting the Pad Thai (my usual go-to dish) but opted for the Saffron Crepe because it sounded interesting. I'm glad I took the risk because it was amazing! I got the version with Sauteed Shrimp and Bacon so it really couldn't go that wrong. It was like a savory pancake/omelette folded in half, with the shrimp and bacon \"stuffed\" inside. It came with some sweet/vinegary sauce (with the consistency of water) -- I poured it little by little on the crepe as I ate it, to avoid the sogginess I'd read about in other reviews. Everyone who tried it at the table seemed equally impressed. I would definitely go back just for that dish alone.The dishes here seem to be a bit uneven. I heard the Pad Thai is pretty ordinary. We also ordered the Fresh Summer Rolls as an appetizer and found them to be just okay.

The fact that I had to make reservations 2 weeks in advance for a 7:00PM Wednesday time gave me high expectations for the quality of Bida Manda. I was not disappointed.My meal here was quite possibly one of the best meals I've had in quite some time. My friends and I ordered the Crispy Spring Rolls (with pork) to start, and they were fantastic -- especially with the dipping sauce. I chose the Crispy Pork Belly Soup as my meal, mostly because it's what I've heard most about from friends who have come here previously. I'm not normally a fan of coconut, but the coconut curry broth mixed with various veggies, pork, peanuts, and cilantro created such a depth of flavor in the soup that I couldn't believe.Unfortunately I didn't order one of Bida Manda's signature cocktails, so I can't comment on those -- but their beer prices are in line with what I'd expect to pay out (average of $5/pint). I was able to order a Fullsteam Cackalacky for only $3, so, bonus points there.Our waiter was very attentive and extremely knowledgeable not only about the menu, but about the food itself.

The place is cute, I like the decor, china, tiny bamboo box for sticky rice(which I like a lot, it's like eating a dessert rice), and staff are nice. The kitchen is not the fastest, usually you'd expect a little wait on food, but in a nice sit down place it's okay. But here comes the con: I really tried to like this place and I don't mind going here for lunch, but food just doesn't taste that great. I do have to admit, I am extra critical about my Asian food. You have to win my taste buds to get me to put down a 4 stars, although in this case I bumped it up because I appreciate an Asian restaurant downtown among other western food, being different and refreshing.The food is always on the saltier end. The lacking of the clear crispy flavor profile is what's missing here. I want to say most of the dishes here share a common undertone, which is not always great--because there's Thai food, there's Vietnamese food, and there's Chinese food on the menu. They DON'T all taste the same. I hope the next time I return, they come up with something amazing."], ["Kim W.", "Wow! I was truly blown away by Bida Manda! I have been hearing such great things about this restaurant since I moved to the area and was finally able to try it out last night.Even on a Thursday night every table was taken so a reservation is a must!

Our waitress was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. I loved the bamboo backdrop, fun wallpaper, and dim lighting - perfect ambience for a girls night out or romantic date.I tried the Picaflor cocktail - it was so refreshing and a great accompaniment to the food that was to come. We started off with two appetizers - the crispy lettuce wraps and the veggie spring rolls. Both were tasty but the texture of the lettuce wraps was truly unique. Now onto the entrees - we wanted to try a few different things so ordered the sweet chili salmon & the chicken curry (which the chef split into two separate bowls for us). The salmon was perfectly cooked and seasoned, the chicken curry just spicy enough (took most of it home because had way too much food)!

We really liked the side sauces included to both dishes, as they helped to embellish the tastes!For our entrees, I had the Green Papaya Salad, which was not really a salad, but much more. Mine came with slices of perfectly prepared Glazed Duck and it was possibly the best food on the table.

Trust me, get the soup. So good. Came to Bida Manda for a work meeting and experienced great service, a very cool atmosphere and the best soup I have ever had (the Crispy Pork Belly soup!). For the price the portion was HUGE, so much so that I still had 3/4 of the bowl when I had to bow out. The veggies were fresh and the spice level wasn't too bad for a weakling like me. The only (tiny) gripe I had was the actual pork belly in the soup was pretty hard and surprised me when I bit down on it. It kind of reminded me of fat back rather than actual pork belly. I know the dish states 'crispy pork belly' but it was more like crunchy.

You might be thinking, who has soup for dinner, and pays $20 for it? After having it, i'd pay that for lunch!! There were so many layers of complexity to this dish but it all went together, the bean sprouts, red cabbage, red curry, coconut and pork belly as well as little bits of pork & rice noodles were phenominal.

Lao restaurants are rare and most are on the west coast. A friend if mine in DC recently told me that they just got their first also restaurant so we've beaten a lot of much larger cities with this one. Now, I've never been to Laos so I can't make a comment on the food's authenticity but I can say it's absolutely delicious.The food on the menu is similar to this food in many ways. They offer curries, larb and papaya salad, for example. However, they also offer dishes I've never seen before (Lao sausage, the oft mentioned pork belly soup) and I feel like the spices are slightly different than this spices (both the larb and the papaya salad are spicier and better than what I've had at most thai restaurants). The papaya salad with dill trout is my go to dish. The combination of dill plus spicy pepper is unexpected and amazingly complex. The beef larb is amazing too. despite the upscale atmosphere, Bida Manda is actually a really good value. Yeah it's more expensive for dinner than standard take out thai but the portions are large and the quality is top notch. For lunch, this place is a steal. They have almost all of the same items for lunch as they do dinner just in slightly smaller portions and most of the lunch entrees are under 10 dollars!Since this place is so great, you do typically have to make reservations for dinner, even on week nights.

This was also the night of the St. Patrick's Day parade ON THE SAME STREET! For that reason, parking and wading through all the drunks took awhile but once inside, it was peaceful and nice. As I said above, our reservation was for 9pm and I called every day to see if someone canceled an earlier reservation. Finally, the day of, we got a 730pm spot!Wait staff was attentive and super friendly. We took our time ordering and really enjoyed it.Drinks - best way to kick off dinner! I had the Marlon - it's pretty manly! They make strong drinks here so if you're ready for some hair on your chest, this is it. I'm a beer lover so I also had the Brewer's Old Fashioned and it was ok. Also will put hair on your chest!Appetizer - Had the crispy rice lettuce wrap at the recommendation of the waiter and it was glorious! Absolutely recommend!Entree - Settled on the Basil Stir Fry. It was good but by the end I was sweating. I'm ok with a little heat but this escalated quickly. Wife had the beef larb which was really good. If I came back I'd get that or the Pad Thai.Overall, definitely would come back again, just try something different. It earned 5 stars because the environment and staff more than made up for the couple of things I'd change about my order."], ["Stephanie H.", "Bida Manda, you have won me over. \u00a0My husband and I came Saturday for my birthday dinner which was super exciting because this has been bookmarked for a year as one of my top spots to check out. \u00a0We arrived at 7:30 for our reservation (which is a must - this place was packed from the minute we came in until the minute we left) and were seated immediately. \u00a0Our waiter arrived shortly after we were seated to bring water and take our drink orders. \u00a0I had the pear cocktail (I can't think of the name) which I thought was delicious. \u00a0Not too boozy, not too sweet - the perfect balance of alcohol and house made pear syrup, quite refreshing! \u00a0My husband and I settled on the crispy rice wraps as an appetizer and enjoyed sipping our drinks and the shrimp chips that were brought out prior to the appetizer.Onto the food - first, the shrimp chips were amazing. \u00a0Cilantro on top which set off the crunch and flavor nicely. \u00a0The lettuce wraps were amazing, I could've just eaten the filling alone with the peanut sauce, that's how amazing they tasted. \u00a0The lettuce gave a nice crunch and of course held the filling together well. \u00a0DEFINITELY need to try these if you're at Bida. \u00a0I ordered the beef larb as my entree which was also amazing. \u00a0The sticky rice, beef, and skewered veggies were so perfect together. \u00a0The portion was great - not huge, but with the shrimp chips and appetizer, I had to bring about 1/3 of my dinner home. \u00a0During dinner, I ordered a thai tea which was amazing and with the homemade coconut milk, was probably the best thai tea I've ever had.Overall summary:*ease of scoring a reservation prior to 9pm - tricky. \u00a0Plan ahead.*service - excellent. \u00a0Casey was an amazing server who took care of us and gave perfect recommendations.*ambiance - romantic, hip, somewhere between casual and dressy, but not snooty*food - YES. \u00a0Just yes. \u00a0Bursting with flavor, fresh ingredients, very well executed*drinks - they don't skimp on the alcohol, so be prepared. \u00a0Not overly boozy, but not primarily syrup either. \u00a0Unique cocktails that are delicious.*will we return? absolutely!"], ["Sarah W.", "So damn good. \u00a0Everything. \u00a0One of those places you could ask the waiter to \"suprise me\" when you order and not be disappointed"], ["Patrick F.", "Went there for lunch the other day. \u00a0Food was delicious. \u00a0Had the papaya salad and ginger beef. \u00a0I would have given it 5 stars, but the portions were small. \u00a0Plan to try dinner one night soon! \u00a0Would recommend!"], ["Jim O.", "Everything about this dinner was a fantastic experience. Our waitress Beth was absolutely terrific. She had an exceptional knowledge of the menu and provided many excellent recommendations. \u00a0The cocktails were in the inventfully designed and very tasty. We ordered a wide selection of appetizers and found one to be better than the next. I decided on the whole red snapper and it was exquisite. This was my first time in this restaurant and in fact my first time in Raleigh or even North Carolina but if travels take me back this way I will absolutely return."], ["Solange C.", "Fabulous food. Excellent mix of herbs and spices with a delicate touch. The best chicken coconut soup I've ever had--authentic, rich Ripken stock as the base, the Anaheim stuffed peppers freshly flavored with some gorgeous spice/herb I dont know what, the green papaya salad already mentioned in other reviews, to die for.The bar service is great. The drinks taste good--but beware, they put cheap vodka in expensive bottles and call it premium. I had 3 different vodkas straight up--they all tasted the same and were terrible. DONT PAY FOR THE UPCHARGE FOR PREMIUM LIQUOR!"], ["Jonathan G.", "The food was good and the vibe was great. It is great seeing more and more places like this pop up and excel in downtown Raleigh. We started off with two appetizers, the Crispy Rice Lettuce Wraps and the Spring Rolls with ground pork then shared the Cashew Ginger Chicken and Sweet Chili Salmon. We both preferred the spring rolls as and the salmon. The lettuce wraps were good but we have both had far better and the ginger chicken tasted like something you can find at most decent Chinese restaurants. The salmon on the other hand was some of the best we have had in the triangle! We skipped on dessert \u00a0in favor of a few cocktails; we tried the Picaflor and the recommended wine they had on special. The wine was good and fairly priced however the specialty cocktail was meh..."], ["Farah K.", "There is nothing bad I can say about this place. It is one of my favorites in Raleigh!! The beef larb (minus all the extra things that go in it) and the papaya salad are absolutely delicious. There is so much flavor and spice. Their trio dessert is always a good way to the end the meal so that you can try a little of everything! The palate cleanser at the end is also such a nice touch. The ambiance is so trendy and perfect for a date or a girls night out!"], ["George F.", "We finally tried this place for lunch today. Wow! What quality for the price!The menu is filled with authentic but approachable dishes. We started with the fresh spring roll with shrimp. They slice and serve it to look like sushi which looks great but can be a little more awkward to pick up. Very tasty though.I had the Pad Thai which was awesome. Great flavors. My wife and son had a couple of chicken based dishes that they loved. And my youngest, who isn't very adventurous at times, had the chicken wing app with coconut curry sauce. She loved them.The atmosphere and service were great to but I'd have put up with just about anything for that food. What a meal. We'll be back!"], ["Janni J.", "I am a part of a dinner club, each month we try a restaurant we haven't tried in search of the best food in Raleigh. This month was Bida Manda. We've been anticipating this one for 2 months so our bar and expectations were raised high. We started with the lettuce wraps and summer rolls. Both were very good! I'd recommend them to anyone. We usually ask the server for a recommendation because they're usually pretty accurate. He just kept saying, \"Get the soup.\" We would ask about other items, which looked incredible as they passed our table but clearly the soup was the star. I'll jump to it, the Crispy Pork Belly Soup was SO RIDICULOUS. \u00a0The only thing I could think of while I was eating it was, \"I am so happy.\" So my take-away from Bida Manda was GET THE SOUP! Just get it. Seriously, get it."], ["Grace L.", "Definitely one of the best \"eats\"in Raleigh. The pork belly noodle soup was amazing. \u00a0And the green papaya salad with duck was delicious. My colleague and I ordered 6 different dishes and enjoyed everything. Will definitely stop by the next time I am in Raleigh!! I can't stop thinking about \u00a0last night!"], ["Corey H.", "Sit at the bar, let them make your drink to their desire and snack on the lettuce wraps."], ["Lindsay H.", "Bida Manda is a great place for either a date or a group dinner. Also good for cocktails and appetizers at the bar.I highly recommend the crispy pork belly soup. I've gotten it several times I've eaten there and it is just unbelievable. Plus, it is a massive portion and you will have plenty to take home for lunch the next day. We also enjoyed the pork spring rolls and the caramelized ginger pork ribs. The sweet chili salmon and green papaya salad with duck were also incredible. Definitely want to come back and try their pad Thai.Overall, would highly recommend Bida Manda especially if you like Asian food or like to try new things - it's not average by any means."], ["Aaks L.", "Third time visiting this place, and now I know for sure this place rocks!Made reservations on yelp (people who constantly complain this place is \"too full\", make a reservation!) and were seated promptly on arrival. Different servers everytime, all of them not only very attentive but also make recommendations on everything (appetizers, drinks, entrees, how spicy to order, etc) because they've tried almost everything on the menu. For me, that's a big plus!I recommend the following (in given order): Crispy Pork Belly Soup, Green Papaya Salad, Caramelized Ginger Pork Ribs, Beef Larb, Amphone's Chicken Curry and Pumpkin Curry.Drinks menu changes often and has lot of great options. Their Fall 2014 cocktail menu has my new fav - bourbon with grapefruit - a twist to a bourbon based cocktail.Love the citrusy cleanse they give towards the end. Much needed!"], ["Drew  R.", "Delicious!!! Went here for a date night with the Fiancee, it was amazing. The food was wonderful. We started with some apps. The crispy rice lettuce wraps are outstanding. I had a special that was a whole fish that I loved, and we shared a dessert that was the best sticky rice (one of my favorites) I have ever had! Btw, make a reservation or you will be waiting a long time, but what do you expect if it is a great restaurant in downtown Raleigh."], ["Camey S.", "Coming from DC where I love trying new cuisine and can appreciate a wonderfully whimsical experience with my meal, I visited Raleigh and came across this place, naturally I was interested in trying Laotian and dragging my bestie out to downtown Raleigh. With a steal of a deal with their price point being $$ and great reviews on yelp to start, I had a good feeling about this place. && Bida Manda was truly amazing. We didn't have reservations because we decided spur of the moment, lucky for us they had some bar seating available, but I'd definitely recommend getting one to ensure you can eat here. To start out they bring you some shrimp chips with are nice to snack on and still light.Start with the crispy lettuce wraps, use the sauce and be careful of the Thai chilies. They are flavorful, have a great crunchy texture with the sweet sauce and crisp lettuce, the perfect way to start your meal here. For entrees, if you're just starting out with Asian fusion, I'd recommend the stir-fry cashew ginger chicken, it tastes delicious but is still safe. I got the caramelized ginger pork ribs which were absolutely scrumptious. They were fall of the bone, saucy, and filling! You pretty much get a whole rack of ribs, a generous amount of rice, grilled asparagus and yummy boiled egg that's flavored with the ginger sauce. So good! If you want a nice cocktail to round out your meal, don't be afraid to ask for a recommendation! I told them I liked mojitos, but wanted something seasonal, I got a refreshing blackberry and lime drink and loved it! My friend was so glad that I made her come here, we left thoroughly pleased, bellies satisfied and knowing we'd be back! Check it out !"], ["Jennifer S.", "Best Asian food I've ever had! \u00a0We live in Mebane, so it's an hour drive for us to Raleigh. \u00a0 My husband tried this place once with a friend and raved about it, so on our way home from the beach today, I figured we could stop for a late lunch.I got the Shrimp Pad Thai and my husband got the Cashew Ginger Chicken. \u00a0We also tried the spring rolls, wings and chicken fried rice (our kids got the wings and fried rice). \u00a0 The chicken fried rice was the best that I ever had (my 4 year old wasn't a fan of it, but this isn't really a place for kids). \u00a0The spring rolls were amazing (we got the pork ones). \u00a0Even my 10 year old liked the spring rolls. \u00a0 \u00a0I was shocked at how reasonably priced the menu was for lunch. \u00a0 I wish we didn't live so far away...I'll definitely make the trip again for this food though. \u00a0It's well worth the hour drive!"], ["Jennifer M.", "Had a business meeting here and ordered the cashew chicken. \u00a0Service was prompt and attentive, portions were just right and the espresso shot at the end made the experience that more special.

Love the ambience; highly suggest a reservation in advance because it is very popular!!! I had the saffron crepe and it was amazing!!! The husband had the pad Thai which was also great! It was not spicy (hot spicy) at all, which is good if you're not a spicy food lover. It was very flavorful. Highly recommend for a romantic night out!"], ["Samson R.", "My mind is blown right now. Like head seriously hurting from the explosions that this food just put my mouth through. Crispy rice lettuce wraps, ginger braised ribs, and papaya salad with Chilean Sea Bass... Amazing!"], ["A C.", "This place is nice. Casually upscale. I sat at the bar and was helped by their nice staff. I ordered the pork belly soup and the honey bourbon old fashioned. While you wait they give you shrimp chips. I have an irrational love for them. They don't taste like shrimp. Or really anything but I love em. The pork belly soup was very nice. It's like a laksa or a light coconut curry soup if you don't know what that is. At first I wished there was more pork belly but there's actually a few hidden pieces in the soup that are a nice surprise. I also got dessert. I wanted the purple sticky rice with mangos but they apparently don't serve it with mango anymore. So I got the trio instead. I enjoyed the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, custard then apricot in that order. I also didn't finish it as I just wanted to taste them and asked to have them boxed. They accidentally threw it out so they made me new ones. I can get used to this southern hospitality y'all!Last thing - the bartender recognized someone from what seems her personal life (meaning not just a regular to the place) and she goes \"hey what're you doing here!\" Guy:\"I'm having dinner with my mom. What're you doing here??\" \u00a0Um...weird question clearly she's working! \u00a0Which was her response as well. Haha"], ["Stephanie B.", "Finally got to check this place out for date night. Had an 8:00 reservation, weren't seated until 8:20. Got drinks (the Alpine '76 was delicious) and ordered the crab cakes pretty immediately upon sitting down. At 8:45, we ordered entrees. Crab cakes came out in a timely manner, and while really good with the panang sauce, they were SO small - silver dollar small. Two of them. Well, glad we had massive dishes coming. Maybe..... At 9:15 we had no entrees yet. We got a lot of \"I promise they'll be out soon!\" from our pretty attentive server. We tried the ol' someone-use-the-bathroom trick three times. It finally worked and we got our meals. I ordered the pork belly soup, which was a ginormous bowl of perfectly spiced rice noodles and red onion and some ground beef, but verrrrry disappointingly little pork belly, \u00a0four bites to be exact. It was a very expensive bowl of really good coconut broth. Seriously, don't get me wrong, I LOVED the dish- but won't ever pay $17 for it again. Husband got the ginger pork ribs which he really enjoyed, but the rice was nothing special and the asparagus was very undercooked. All in all, glad we went, food was pretty good, but will we rush back? Probably not."], ["Richard M.", "Was in town for business, found this little gem. Came 5 min before lunch and there was already a queue. Great service and great food. Couldn't fault anything!"], ["Kimberly L.", "I'm not going to lie. \u00a0With all the raving reviews, I had extremely high hopes for Bida Manda, which might explain why I was so incredibly disappointed. I came in during restaurant week, but I wasn't absolutely ravenous, so I settled for the papaya salad on the original menu. \u00a0What I normally love about papaya salad is the complexity in flavor--the fishiness in the sauce balanced out by the sourness of the citrus, the sweetness of palm sugar, and the spice. \u00a0The papaya also needs to be extremely fresh, crunchy, and crisp as the salad is a playful party of flavors as well as textures. Coming from Southern California and a Southeast Asian background, I have pretty high expectations for papaya salad, simply because I've had my fair share of the dish. \u00a0I honestly believe that you could judge the quality of a Southeast Asian restaurant by the quality of their papaya salad--that may be a slight exaggeration brinking on ridiculousness, but it's something I truly believe in. \u00a0Some of my favorite restaurants in Los Angeles for Thai and Laotian food produce some of the best papaya salads, and Bida Manda just didn't compare. \u00a0The papaya salad fell extremely flat, the portion rather small, and the dish was simply one dimensional. \u00a0Had the price point been lower, I may have been less disappointed and slightly more satisfied, but the quality of the dish didn't come close to reflecting what you pay. \u00a0The same could be said about the \"pho\" dish. \u00a0The dish lacked the complexity and layers of flavor that I usually love in Southeast Asian cuisine. \u00a0It was extremely frustrating. \u00a0I wanted to love Bida Manda--I truly did, but it just wasn't for me; however, I could see the appeal. \u00a0If you have high standards for Southeast Asian food, however, I'd recommend that you find another restaurant."], ["Eric M.", "One of my favorite places in Raleigh. Fresh, delicious, and not your average Thai spot. I love everything I've ever had here."], ["Britnie J.", "Since I'm moving to Raleigh in a few weeks I had to check out the food scene. I \u00a0Looked up Raleigh's number one restaurant and Bida Manda came up and boy am I glad it did! \u00a0They squeezed us in for a reservation at 10:30 on Friday night. \u00a0I've never had Laotian food but I've been Thailand and love Thai food. \u00a0It's very comparable to that. \u00a0The service and food were beyond great. \u00a0We ordered the pork belly soup, ribs, and soft shell crabs. \u00a0When they say try the pork belly soup, you try the pork belly soup!! It was damn delicious. \u00a0The man I assume is the owner was so friendly. \u00a0He checked on us a few times. He was hugging everyone that came in the door. \u00a0You could tell he truly cares about his business and customers. \u00a0I can't wait to take my out of town guests here to blow their mind!!"], ["Christina C.", "My FAVORITE restaurant in North Carolina!! I can't say enough good things about this place...I have never had a bad experience! The food is absolutely amazing. If you like Thai food, you'll love Laotian food too! And for those that aren't as adventurous...there are simpler entrees on the menu too like fish or ribs. I love the green papaya salad!! I usually get it with chicken. Medium spicy is very spicy to me and I love spicy foods...so beware if you go above that. I've also tried the curry which is another of my favorites! Even the appetizer shrimp chips are delicious and something different which I love. The service has always been on point...very friendly staff. The owners (brother/sister team) are often in the restaurant making sure everything is going well with the customers. And I have to say something about the decor...so adorable! I love the wood and paintings of Laos. I appreciate the small details like fresh flowers on the tables and vintage-y plates/napkins. Also for you gluten free folks...There are gluten free options marked on the menu!! I have never gotten sick here (Celiac) and I've been about 4 times. Plenty of gf options too so you can feel included. They even brought me gf dessert when I came for my birthday! Seriously...my favorite place! :-)"], ["Andre B.", "Bida Manda definitely came with some high expectations based on the online reviews. Also, the fact that we could only get a late reservation proves that it's a popular place. We were quickly seated and the service was good to great for the most part. Our server was very knowledgeable with the menu from top to bottom and made great suggestions for us.We wanted \u00a0a quick appetizer of panang crab cakes along with our drinks. Our server warned us that the crab cakes were on the smaller side and they were, but also definitely tasty with a small amount of pickle carrots/veggie mixture as a garnish. For drinks, the wife went with the standard pi\u00f1a colada, and I went with the bitter goodness of the crom. The drinks were good, but I'm definitely not a pi\u00f1a colada guy.On to the food, everything looked good on the menu, but I was pretty dead set on getting the larb from the get go. I went with the duck and duck parts options. Laos spicy please and yes it was but nothing crazy spicy like I'm going to feel it the next day spicy. Depending, I might do double Laos spicy next time. Anyway, the wife got one of their best sellers, the green papaya salad. She got the one with the trout. I tried a little bit of it and the trout was very well cooked. She really enjoyed her dish and at a medium spicy level.Onto dessert, which was a continuation of great food. The wife got a purple rice with a coconut cream type of dessert. She loved it, but having tasted it, like the pi\u00f1a colada, it's clearly not my jam. My trio of pumpkin creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, apricot cake and well I'm not sure what the third one was but they were all good. I particularly like the apricot one.All in all a great meal, I'm giving it a 4 star for now but will return at my next convenience and it will very likely be bumped to a 5 star."], ["Anil O.", "Great ambiance, perfect service and delicious food. I sat at the bar and enjoyed watching the bartenders prepare interesting cocktails too. Started with the salad with a peanut vinaigrette and had the Shrimp Pad Thai. Very good sauce, not too overwhelming and perfectly cooked shrimp. Always a good indication of a good Thai restaurant in my opinion. I am sure I will be back."], ["Holly K.", "I received the best customer service here of anywhere in Raleigh so please understand they have that on lock, however I found my food very unpalatable.

We went during restaurant week and had a great experience. I wish they were a little less expensive but it was still worth it. The service was amazing."], ["Alex A.", "It feels like you're sitting in a Laotian family dining room. The experience is remarkable from start to finish. While all the staff is cream of the crop, having Cliff as your waiter elevates your experience to 5star quality. He can literally sell you on anything the menu offers...The crispy lettuce wraps are an absolute must. If you aren't completely famished, I recommend family style, which is very doable there."], ["Connie W.", "I've only ever heard positive things about Bida Manda and there's a reason why. I've come here a few times and have tried the papaya salad with duck, pork belly soup, crispy lettuce app (MUST HAVE), and the caipirinha, a Brazilian drink that tastes like fresh squeezed limeade. All of it has been delicious! The papaya salad compares to the papaya salad I've had in Thailand. Decor and atmosphere is wonderful for a nice dinner with friends or a date night. You can tell that a lot of thought was put into the concept of the restaurant from the menus to the bathroom decor. The reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is because its near impossible to get a reservation during normal dinner hours on weekends. We had to book our reservation at 5:00pm on a weekend because there were no later times available... but when we got there, we noticed many open tables up until about 6:30. We wondered if they had blocked off later times and opened reservations at earlier times to fill up tables. Nonetheless, its worth coming back to again and again!"], ["Jamie W.", "Had a reservation for 8, got seated right on time. Place is VERY busy would Def make a reservation, also a bit loud.

They don't look good, but they are!I had the chicken pad Thai , amazing g, and you get alot of it, two hungry people could share itHusband had ginger cashew chicken, was ok, wouldn't order it ahain, pretty plain, and watery.Service would be our complaint, our original waitress never checked on our satisfaction, or ro replenish our drinks."], ["Jeremy A.", "Ive been to Bida Manda a few times now and its still tops in the city for me due to the awesome food and dining experience they provide here. The Duck Larb is what I would recommend as its what I have gotten both times I have visited. If you go for Lao spice its pretty damn hot so just be warned. The pork belly soup is incredible here and I would have confidence ordering anything on the menu. Service is always great and definitely get a reservation even if you think youre going on a weeknight and wont need one. Thats what we did the second time we went and ended up waiting for like 30 min on a tuesday. Parking is usually available on the street right in front or you can park in the garage across the street from Marbles."], ["David C.", "We went for lunch and were seated very quickly. The waiter took our drink orders fast and he recommended the pork belly soup. It sounded just odd enough so I went for it. It was so good! \u00a0The pork belly was crispy and crunchy and the serving size was huge. It's a little spicy but just enough for good flavor. We also got vegetarian Pad Thai. It was flavorful and filling. We got the summer wraps and they are good but the peanut sauce they serve with it is fantastic. Like good enough to drink good. After the really good lunch we asked for the check and they brought 2 small shot glasses of Laotian coffee that were out of this world!Lots of good choices for vegetarians and carnivores alike!"], ["Danielle H.", "In the midst of our relocation Bida Manda was the first raleigh dining experience my husband and I had and it was a great one! From the ambiance to the drinks to the food and the cute little after dinner cocktail shot they provide - it was superb. The decor won me over as I am quite the ambiance type of gal! But stellar food accompanied by great ambiance is a home run in my book! We had the spring rolls for appetizers, my personal request of Gin, lemonade and violet for cocktail and pork belly soup! It was a rainy night and therefore probably drove home the \u00a0comfort the soup brought my belly! All in all this has to be one of my favorites restaurants across the nation. #hancockhelping we will be back for sure!"], ["DY H.", "Three of us went on a Friday evening although we were not able to get a reservation. We were told that the wait would be 1.5 hrs, but it really was less than 1 hr. The place is right across from Moore Square, so it's in a primo spot. We were able to walk around downtown while we were waiting, so the time went by quickly.The dining room is not large, but there was plenty of room between tables. The lighting was a bit dark, so I am a bit embarrassed that I had to use the flashlight on my phone to read the menu. Otherwise, the atmosphere was friendly and casual. It also looked like quite a few of the tables were celebrating birthdays.We ordered the crispy lettuce wraps as an appetizer. This is a vegetarian dish that was quite tasty. The lettuce leaves were shaped perfectly to hold the mildly seasoned vegetable mixture. We were also served a basket of shrimp chips -- one my childhood favorite snacks! I also ordered a cocktail -- like a tropical margarita. It was not strong at all... a bit on the watery side.For our main course, we ordered 2 kinds of larb (duck and beef)-- meat cooked with a spicy citrus marinade, and a papaya salad with grilled Chilean Sea Bass. We asked for medium spiciness, which according to our waiter was spicier than standard \"medium spicy\". The papaya salad with the fish was delicious! The fish was perfectly cooked and seasoned. It was my favorite dish of the bunch. Both of the larb dishes were also tasty, but the \"medium\" spiciness was quite a bit more spicy than what we expected... even with the waiter's warning! i can eat pretty spicy food, and this was even a bit much for me. The fish/papaya salad were not as spicy. We were able to get a glass of milk and a glass of coconut milk/soda water combo to help cut the spice, as we had to wimp out. For desert, they brought us a dessert plate, because yes, we were celebrating a birthday too! It had 3 desserts -- coconut custard, creme brulee, and a tamarind cobbler. They were all very good!The service was okay -- not excellent/not terrible. I think our waiter must have been new-ish. He had difficulty describing the specials for the evening, although he was right to recommend the sea bass (which I typically don't order because of fishing sustainability). It was a moment of weakness. But a tasty one."], ["Allie J.", "I have never had a bad experience here. The servers are knowledgeable and friendly. The drinks are creative and tasty. Oh and the food is amazing. Admittedly I haven't tried as much of the menu as I would like because once I tried the papaya salad I was hooked. It's the perfect blend of crunch with a juicy sweetness and spice to your liking and a flavorful protein. It's a struggle every time I go to order something else when I know how delicious the papaya salad is :)"], ["Paul W.", "A nice-looking downtown restaurant.Service was prompt and okay. We tried five entrees from the duck to ribs to chicken pad Thai. Nothing special. Maybe it's among the better options in Raleigh, but I don't think this place would thrive in a bigger city given food quality. Mediocre."], ["Vida D.", "The food at this restaurant is amazing! The decor and ambience are fabulous!Unfortunately, it's dinner availability and seating policies are tricky. You must make a reservation ahead of time--this INCLUDES seating at the bar.

I promise you will love anything you order!"], ["Annie G.", "So glad we took Yelp! and our friend's suggestions and checked out Bida Manda! You know you are in for an experience just walking into this place! The decor is gorgeous and the place is pretty small so it can feel somewhat intimate.

Soooo amazing and nothing you expect! The spicy sauce was great and the texture was were it was at!! These are a MUST!Homemade sausage special- Wow! These were so fresh and delicious and full of \u00a0chopped herbs! Quite spectacular!For our entrees:Green mango salad with pork neck- Very delicious, but I got medium spicy and it wasn't spicy AT ALL! The waitress said that sometimes the peppers are hotter on some days and that is true so she brought me some chili oil and chili paste and that took it to a whole new level! The pork neck was cooked perfectly and very tender. The serve it with sticky rice that you are suppose to smoosh into the shape of a disk and scoop up green papaya with. I decided on a fork since I was all dressed up.Pork belly soup- My husband was deciding between this and the pho and said he made the right choice. It was a huge portion and extremely flavorful! It has a coconut milk base as compared to the clear broth of pho. My husband said he would probably never try the pho there now because he tried this soup. He tends to stick with something he loves... like me I guess :)After our meal we got served a digestif of lime and strawberry that was very refreshing.Can't wait to go back and try some other disheds like the larb!"], ["Sarah M.", "I was craving Pho and this was the only place that came up in my search. I was not disappointed! Amazing Pho! I love that with Pho, \u00a0I can control the flavors I want with basil, lime and different sauces. But the key to good Pho is a good beef and a good broth. Bida M does it right and this will be my new go-to."]]}
