I want to update this with some additional information. In my initial review, I had an issue with the way the sushi (BOGO) was billed. To quote my earlier review:\"Came with a large party (10ish or so). Was told by the server that all the sushi would go on one tab but that they could easily split things up for us to pay individually. Ok. I order sushi as does one other person. The sushi is BYGO free. Standard.My rolls were 8.90 and 12.90. The other person's rolls were 6.90 each. Now, when I ordered I assumed I was paying for my 12.90 roll but my 8.90 was the free one. Nope. Not the case.They put all the sushi on one bill and then drop the cheapest. What this means is it's not about you and what you order but about how your group as a whole orders. I took the bill up front and asked to speak with a manager. I explained what our server told us. Manager basically says that the policy is the policy because it's the policy. And apparently justifies this by saying everyone else in town does it this way too.\"I recently went to a different sushi restaurant with a part of 12. They also had BOGO sushi. Remembering my experience here, I asked our server how the BOGO would be done. I tried to explain how it had been billed at Shaba Shabu, and asked if this was how they did it. He said no. He explained that the sushi I ordered would be on my bill and my bill alone. So, when I ordered two rolls (each was about 15.00). My second roll was free regardless of what others at the table ordered.So this statement from the Shaba Shabu manager that everyone in town bills the way they do - questionable at best. Maybe some other places do - but not everyone."], ["Arvid Y.", "I came here for a post-exam lunch. Shaba Shabu is a great place for lunch. They have daily $5.99 lunch specials and also buy one get one free sushi rolls (range from $7-17). I ended up getting the Diablo and Fish Lover Rolls. They were both good, but not great. Fish quality seemed decent and portion sizes were good. The sushi also came out quickly, which was another plus They have about 50 different types of rolls to choose from. While variety is good, choosing from 50 can also be a little difficult. Oh well, first world problems.Another plus is their draft beer selection. Visiting North Carolina for a few days, it was nice to try some local beers on draft. They also have nightly drink specials.Overall, Shaba Shabu is a solid sushi option. The interior decor is also nice and modern. Of course it's a Japanese-Thai fusion restaurant, so don't expect the most authentic Japanese fare. A lot of the rolls are pretty \"Americanized\", but I am not hating on that. I'm sure there's something for everyone.*3.5 stars*"], ["Suzanne B.", "I have been going there for 3 years.

I had the $15 three course lunch meal which consisted of salad, veggie and seafood mini rolls and a rice a tofu dish.

This was for a visit in September '14I was very excited to find a restaurant that offered shabu shabu in the area. It's one of the things I really miss from the Bay Area, CA. Unfortunately, this place did not meet my expectations.Value$25 for the cheapest meat option (NY Steak). My friend and I opted to try the kobe style beef for $37. You get one small platter of meat and some veggies. I get that this area doesn't have many places that serve this kind of stuff, but I'm used to paying $18-20 for a bigger portion. $37 puts you in the range of AYCE places in CA. QualityThe beef was ok. Not as marbled as you would expect from a kobe style beef. Dipping sauces were good. ServiceNothing outstanding to call out. My pot was not heating up very fast, and the waitress misunderstood me when I tried to tell her and turned the heat down. Discovered 10 minutes later when I was trying to cook beef in warm water. Misc.The pot doesn't look like it was sitting on an induction style stove. Might have been the reason for the heating issues. \u00a0The other thing is that the cooking pot was so far in front of us that we both had to stand up in order to reach into the pot...a minor issue but was very weird. The one thing that I really enjoyed was the banana tempura a la mode. Can't really go wrong with a fried banana topped with green tea ice cream. I might eventually go back to try the sushi, but it's hard to justify when there are so many other restaurants in the area to check out."], ["MJ A.", "I'm reading these other reviews and think it's first important to start by stating the obvious: There are two types of sushi restaurants. \u00a0There's the ultra-authentic and expensive restaurant with a Japanese owner/chef who's gone through years of training and has 20 years experience in the art, with a menu that would intimidate the standard American palate.... and then there's the run of the mill sushi restaurant that has gone through the typical Americanization of the menu to appeal to the masses. You can't rate these two restaurant classes together because they are clearly in different leagues and even differ in what is typically offered on the menu. With that said, Shaba Shabu caters to an audience of the latter and in all honesty, hit the spot on two different occasions. The restaurant is just across the street from the Courtyard, so it's easy access for those of you who stay at the hotel. Tuesday night I decided to try their pad thai for take out. While the dish was average, their prawns were as fresh as they come--so kudos there. \u00a0Thursday night I decided to dine in and try their sushi. \u00a0I ordered a Hamachi nigiri, Okinawa roll, and Tar-Heel roll. Everything was delicious on various levels: fish was fresh, tempura fried perfectly, and rice was seasoned well. Coming from California I wasn't expecting to be impressed by the meal, but can say that this was one of the better sushi restaurants I have had while traveling on road. The beer selection on tap has a ways to go, but you can at least get an average IPA with your rolls. Also, the service at the front desk and bar were exceptional."], ["Laura G.", "I do not know why it has taken us 10 years to visit this restaurant. I think of all the lost sushi opportunities we could have had. But alas, we now know what a wonderful restaurant this is. Let me start with the drink special on the night we went.

The thai basil recipe has changed and tasted like soy sauce from a frozen meal. $59 down the drain. I am so shocked at how badly it has declined that I really don't know what else to write.

Because of the great price, I expected it to have small portions, but it was definitely more than I expected. I ordered the salad with ginger dressing for the appetizer. For the first course, I ordered the Thai appetizer sampler. This plate had a total of 3 types of appetizers (2 of each) with a variety of sauces for each one. I loved the presentation of it! It was very simple and cute. For the main course, I ordered Chicken Pad Thai. I'm a huge fan of Pad Thai and I was not disappointed with the taste! For the dessert, I had the Cheesecake Panko Tempura for dessert, which was very delicious! The tempura crust balanced the cheesecake very well. Despite it being a busy night, the service was great!

After we got seated and were sipping our drinks were we notified to move to the shabu shabu area..... *facepalm*...so we moved.

I also saw from other trusty yelpers that they had BOGO sushi so knew I just had to try it out, however I was left very disappointed.I guess I probably should have expected mediocre sushi for a BOGO deal (and I had takeout), but the quality was even below that. I tried the Okinawa roll and Spicy Tuna roll. Both were wrapped very poorly and fell apart in my hands. All I could taste in the Spicy Tuna roll was the spicy sauce, no taste of tuna whatsoever. The Okinawa roll said it there was shrimp tempura inside, however mine was cold. It was so weird, I've never had cold shrimp tempura before and I don't think I ever want to again. The bartender was nice, however the couple next to me waited far too long for him to take their drink order. You could also hear him arguing with a server very loudly which was not pleasant to witness.

I ended up getting 4 rolls for the price of two, which put my tummy and my wallet at ease. \u00a0The freshness and quality of the rolls was solid, and I was on board immediately. \u00a0I definitely recommend the Shabu roll for sure. \u00a0The next night I came with coworkers and gave the Thai a try..

And they were funny and the rest of our evening was a blast. Now, as far as Shaba Shabu goes...wow. This was a train wreck from start to finish. We were seated at 7:15pm and ordered drinks. Which promptly arrived. Just kidding, we didn't get them until 8:20pm after our 3rd lap wandering through the restaurant looking for someone to help us. We were repeatedly told it was just \"one of those crazy-busy nights\". \u00a0The other parties who came in after us, ate and were leaving as our drinks were being poured, you ask? Apparently they were there on a different night. It was definitely not nearly as crazy for them. So by 8:45pm everyone was feeling pretty lose from the first half of their cocktails when dinner arrived. Sure it was cold and by now no one had any recollection of what they ordered, but as I mentioned it was one of those crazy-busy nights. I think we can all agree that on a night like that having someone (mostly) cook a meal and bring it to your table is going above and beyond. Minutes later we are presented with our bill. Purely a coincidence that this is the only remotelyefficient part of the process. After all the waiting and the mistakes and the fact that I felt like I was filming Taken 4 with Liam Neeson as a tried to hunt down someone to find our drinks, you can't imagine how relieved I was that our bill was correct! And nothing had been adjusted to make up for the disaster of an evening. When I thanked our waiter for his billing accuracy and then insisted to thank his manager they went above and beyond by offering to remove...wait for it...and entire round of drinks from our bill. Hello?!? It's not my birthday!! I felt like I was holding one of those giant fake checks and confetti was falling all around me. This was my lucky day. So we couldn't not speak to the manager who was only now freed up enough from his busy night to come to the table and ask what the problem was. I reminded him we had met 90 mins earlier when I was wandering through the kitchen looking for our drinks. It was good to see him again. We told him he could keep the bills as souvenir of our wonderful evening together but he insisted otherwise. The wise man that he is he didn't want us to leave without imparting a life lesson on us: \"I'm sorry things don't always go your way\". Those words stuck with me to this day, all these 3 days later. \"I'm sorry things don't always go your way\". So true. So. True."], ["Nancy Y.", "I've been to Shaba Shabu several times over the last few years, and the business model has changed quite a bit since my first time. Several years ago (~2007), the restaurant was split between traditional dining and Japanese hot pot (shabu shabu). I had the shabu shabu back then and loved it. Tasty, clean broth and fresh ingredients.As of late, the restaurant has remodeled and become much more loungey with a contemporary feel. I've come for after work drinks and appetizers and again for a sit-down dinner. My experience has been very different for these two occasions. I really enjoyed coming here for cocktails. My friend and I sat at the lounge bar and got drink recommendations from the bartender. I tried a few concoctions, and while the ingredients didn't include fresh-squeezed juices, they were still tasty and refreshing. We got appetizers with our drinks - gyoza and tuna tartare. While the portions were small for the price, we really liked what we got. (3 stars)Dinner was another story. I think the Japanese and Thai foods are not authentic at all. I got the phad kee mao. The dish was drowning in this dark sauce that masked the flavor more than enhanced it. It just should not have been. Was the portion size awesome? Yes. Was the service good? Yes. Would I rather have had Sawasdee? Yes. Of my party of three, we had 1 thumbs up and 2 thumbs down. (2 stars)This is a review of averages.

We were all going to order shabu so we sat at the bar. The broth - it comes flavored already - it's not like the traditional Japanese shabu where you cook all your veggies and meats in water - which I didn't mind! You get a variety of vegetables but for $25 I would expect a little more vegetables to be completely honest. I know I shouldn't hold it to the standards of LA, but I could easily pay $16 and have received double the meat and twice the vegetables and you get a choice of broths and a sauce bar! But keeping in mind that it's Raleigh I would probably come back if I was craving Shabu Shabu and didn't feel like making it at home. If you like shabu then I would definitely go here for it - I thought the broth was tasty and the service was great - which is why I'm giving it 4 stars! \u00a0I didn't get to try their sushi or thai food but I'll willing to go back and try!"], ["Josh P.", "Had some decent sashimi and nigiri here, but the prices were a little high.

The menu is large with a variety of different foods. Second, the choices of sides with the burgers is great! I've tried the bacon coleslaw, fried pickles, and the cucumber salad. They were each great and worth getting again. Every person that I have taken here has loved it. I've ordered the fried calamari and it is so good!! I like that you can get a burger and switch out the meat. I always order the \"heavenly veggie\" burger and switch out the veggie patty for meat. (I know, sounds like it defeats the purpose but it is good!)The layout of the restaurant is weird, almost a maze. It can also get loud in there. The decor is funky and I love the fish tank. My biggest complaint with the restaurant is the wait time. I've even gone during a \"slow time\" and I had to wait 20 minutes for a table to be cleaned off. There were other tables open and I was told by the hostess that those tables were for \"larger\" parties (we were a 2 person party). The host/hostess staff aren't always pleasant. The servers are great though. I had a server yesterday named Emmett and he was on point, made jokes, and seemed to really enjoy his job. More than a couple of times I've made the decision not go to because of the wait time. I've only called once and they said they didn't take reservations."], ["Alice F.", "We came back to cowfish tonight, and our experience confirmed that our last visit was a one time disappointment. We ordered two burgers, the boss, and the tropical storm. Everything was great but we were too excited to take pictures before everything was devoured.

Our server was attentive with excellent service."], ["Daniel H.", "First of all, any establishment that sells a combination of sushi AND burgers together on the menu is off my books, period. \u00a0It was extremely noisy since the place was at full capacity. I knew I wasn't eating so I sat at the bar and ordered a drink, which had to be returned not once but twice to be remade (with very specific instructions). \u00a0Still, the drink was awful, but I did appreciate the bartender for the effort/service. \u00a0I also found the fish tank located in the middle of the bar extremely annoying......"], ["Kimberly Y.", "I really wanted to like Cowfish, but everything else didn't quite make up for the food and wow, that wait time. The service is super nice and patient, and they're willing to explain everything to you. The place is definitely unique in decoration -- cool and hilarious art along the walls, but the fish tank wasn't amusing for long.That being said, I found the food to be mediocre. Maybe my expectations were too high from all I've heard about the place? Anyway, I ordered the Cowfish bento box. I have to admit the burger meat was good, but the slider was ye small. My California rolls were average at best, and the edamame and Thai cucumber salad were very mediocre. My fries tasted like they were cooked two hours ago, which is strange considering I came on a Saturday night -- what I'd imagine to be one of their busiest times. My friend ordered the \"Ultimate\" bento box and admitted that it was only all right (and he was the one who insisted we go!). Would've tried the other faves like crab rangoon if we hadn't been so stuffed by the end, haha.I'm just not sure Cowfish merits a 1-hour wait.

Our waiter was extremely helpful and knowledgeable with the menu, answering any questions that we had for our first time there. Now you can get better sushi or better burgers at other restaurants in the Raleigh area, but there is no place that offers this unique fusion.For our appetizer, we tried the Crab Rangoon Dip which was incredible, and Dave's Filet Roll (Burgushi topped with Filet Mignon), their burger sushi. It was fairly good, and the Filet Mignon was cooked superb. For my meal I ate the Jalape\u00f1o Popper Show-Stopper Burger, which was awesome, but not mind-blasting. It had a great kick for heat-lovers. Also the truffle fries were forgettable for me. I also had a chance to try the What's Shakin' Tuna Bacon Sandwich, which was very interesting and tasted great, but fell a little flat in concept.I ate here on a Saturday lunch and was seated immediately, however I have heard that wait times can be very long here, and they do not offer reservations or call-aheads.I would definitely eat here again, with piqued interest for their delicious and imaginative food."], ["Stephen W.", "The food here is fantastic - never had a bad experience here. However, if you are going during prime time, be prepared to wait. This place is popular for a reason - my wife and k brought cards last time and that made the hour long wait go by quicker.

Had the colossal onion rings for an appetizer and they were great. \u00a0You're expecting a mountain of rings (colossal, right), but our plate had 5 on it.

The manger stopped and talked to us because of the issue. We received a free appetizer, so the crab Rangoon dip was okay. More cream cheese then crab but the wontons and sauce were nice. We ordered the volcanic roll and the deliverance roll. The volcanic, was fresh with cucumber and jalape\u00f1os inside then the spice tuna on top. Just enough spice but not over powering. Then the deliverance, a southern comfort play on sushi, the pork was tender with just enough barbecue sauce, the coleslaw gives it a little tang, and the nice crunch with the shoestrings on top. Very delicious. Overall the entrees were honesty wonderful. Service went from poor to decent.

My coworkers and I went there for lunch on a weekday. It was pretty busy for weekday. The concept is pretty cool- they have sushi in form of burger.

But having these amazing options for us meat lovers is exactly what I have been looking for. Atmosphere is very casual and inviting and service was good. The menu was very extensive but a little bit pricey. I tried the BBQushi (pulled pork sushi). And it was to die for! Covered with coleslaw and crispy onions straws...I think I like sushi now :)I can't wait to visit Raleigh again in the future and go back to try other menu items.

Their food is incredible and their service is equally impressive. I have never had a bad waiter there and I have eaten here at least a dozen times. For appetizers, it has to be the lobster egg rolls or crab Rangoon dip. Both are unique and very tasty. For my meal, I almost always get sushi although the Burgushi I tried has always been very good.

I could go on and on about this place but let me just simply say, if you haven't tried it yet, you better soon!"], ["Cat L.", "My girlfriends and I had dinner here a few nights ago. The place was packed for a weeknight & the parking is miserable while the construction goes on. I realize that's not Cowfish's doing. The burgushi box was a hot choice within our table. The sushi options and the slider adds nice diversity to a rather ordinarily order. The pimento cheese & bacon sandwich was great and the bison burger was amazing. The fried pickles were the center of discussion and the table as we passed around continuously. Cowfish is always a huge success for us and we appreciate their constant hospitality. The decor and audio recording in the bathroom make it quite an eccentric place to relax & dine."], ["Heather M.", "Americanized sushi restaurant best sums it up.A mountain of parmesan truffle fries for an appetizer and then sushi+sashimi for our entrees? You get the best of both worlds~The ambience is modern and hip. We went at 4:45 and by the time it hit 5:15, there was a crowd.Service was very professional. Our server was a bit hovering but I'd rather have that than an absent server.The only miss was the Parmesan truffle fries. They were more like bacon-cheese fries... And the fries themselves were not crispy, but stale... They weren't even hot!!My favorite part of my experience here was that I could build my own sushi roll and add whatever I wanted, yay! (If it doesn't taste good, you only have yourself to blame right?

The \u00a0concept, however, makes it one of my favorite spots in Raleigh. First of all, sushi and burgers...why wasn't this a big deal my entire life? Cowfish has everything from combo boxes featuring sliders and sushi, to \"burgushi\" rolled with a variety of meats, to create-your-own options. My first time there, I tried one of the combo boxes. The slider was simple but tasty, and the spicy tuna roll was pretty classic. The sweet potato fries were absolutely perfect - soft, crispy and sweet. My second time there, I had the miss muffet sushi roll (tuna, tempura, avocado, sesame seeds and eel sauce). Not only was it delicious, but it came in nine hefty pieces. Tucked in a back corner in the North Hills, Cowfish's ambiance is very trendy, complete with a small aquarium, bizarre artwork and an eclectic playlist of upbeat tunes. The indoor/outdoor seating and cornhole (so you can play while you wait for a table) make Cowfish a great summer spot.I would highly recommend Cowfish for anyone looking for variety (the menu is huge) and a laid-back, young vibe.

Even as a total Sushi noob, I can appreciate that they do have tasty, fresh and plump rolls that compare quite favorably with other nearby sushi options.Why the two stars you ask, one word : service. \u00a0It was always so-so, for some reason the head-waitress seemed to dislike us (gf and me) despite being regular customers (once a week) and tipping well. Often other tables seated with/after us got their rolls before we got our Miso soup (as part of their $8.95 2 rolls + soup special). I never quite understood why, but I put up with it (and left healthy tips in light of the Sushi we enjoyed) and the Chef behind the bar was always nice to us.On our last visit there, we didn't get out soup at all and finally had to ask for it. The waitress in the meanwhile is giving me the stink-eye all the time from across the room, and I have no idea what's going on. Finally soup arrives, and half way through girl-friend finds a hair in hers. We call over the head-waitress, and explain the situation. She just stares at us for a bit, then grudgingly agrees to replace and follows it up with this little exchange :Waitress (about to leave) : By the way, I didn't want to say anything but you guys didn't leave a tip last time.We : Flabbergasted. Me : No I definitely left a tip, I have never in my life not left a tipWaitress : (taken aback by how sure we are) umm ..maybe you forgot?Me : NOWaitress : (still continues) you sat at that table over there (points to wrong table we never sat at) and ordered a custom roll [fictional-roll-we-never-ate]GF : NO. We never sat there and we always order off the regular menu!Waitress : (still clings on to some hope) maybe I got my tables mixed up but I think it was you guysWe : Sorry, not us!{She leaves and returns with new bowl of soup}Waitress : (mumbling) not sure how the hair got in there. If it happens again then you can complain to my boss. {Leaves us finally. No apologies for the hair or the random public accusation WTF!}We shared a quiet and uncomfortable meal, at some point the waitress seemed to realize her mistake (probably post some discussions with her \"boss\" : whoever that is) and tried to terribly overcompensate by repeatedly asking us if we wanted soy-sauce/extra-chopsticks/ginger/wasabi. But at no point did she apologize. We left in an uncomfortable silence and getting a box for most of our dinner. The accusation in response to finding hair in the soup was just bizarre and a terrible way to treat a customer., the lack of an apology was even worse. It left an incredibly sour taste, while we love the Sushi here we'll be taking our business elsewhere from here on. P.S : 1. Went home and checked my credit card statement : on our previous visit we had left a slightly above 20% tip as was our norm here.2. In hindsight I get the feeling that our tardy service on past visits was also linked to some sort of (fictional) tipping issue this person had with us. Or our 20% tips were too low for her to muster up the quality of service she was offering everyone else around us. Just.Not.Done!"], ["Ch T.", "[dog-unfriendly - no outdoor seating]the sushi here is really great. We randomly stopped here after a movie, and it is pretty much now my favorite sushi place. the rolls were really just amazing. The ginger dressing on the salad was the best I've ever had. The service was good, their prices are fair, and the atmosphere was incredibly welcoming and cute. Oh, and one of their attention to details that I really appreciated - they give you an extra small napkin along with the large cloth one at the table setting, so you don't have to lift your napkin off your lap after every piece of sushi to wipe the edges of your mouth. Maybe not everyone cares about this, but I do, and I really liked that they put that much thought into their guests' experience."], ["Aisha H.", "Tried this place out last weekend and it was pretty decent.

We were the only people in the restaurant and it was very quiet so we were able to enjoy each other's company. The food comes in bento boxes and I can readily admit I did not know exactly what all was in my box; however, nothing was particularly bad or distasteful.

The udon had a great chew to it, which was just perfect.My coworker got the maki lunch special, but felt that all the rolls all tasted the same. =/I'd come back again and try more of their appetizers - they have a great variety of all different types of little plates that's definitely worth another visit here.Also, the service was great.

I've definitely moved on since then to other places for rolls and sashimi, but the one thing that would bring me back to this place is the udon. I think this is the best place for udon as the noodles are always perfectly cooked, the dish always served hot, and the flavor always good. The Nabeyaki Udon is always my favorite and I always add ample chili powder to spice it up to my spicy level. Another thing I do like from this place is the ginger dressing that they serve with their salads. I'm not a big fan of iceberg lettuce, as you can tell from my other reviews, I don't mind the salad quite as much before of the dressing. I don't know if they make their own dressing, but I assumed so, and i commend them for making what is probably the best dressing I've had in the area. This label, of course, is subjective to my own tastes, but I would find most other places too salty or maybe a little bland or too tart. Food aside, I think the service is superb. For a while, my girlfriend and I pretty much \"lived\" in Raleigh, and this would be out weekly dinner place, so we were definitely regulars. They would recognize us and occasionally give us some free salads or sometimes free mochi dessert. The sushi chef (the old guy) would modify the sushi to our taste. For instance, we got the firecracker roll once and he had been noticing that we like a lot of wasabi (we also asked for it to be extra spicy that day) and he definitely made the firecracker roll super spicy, which I loved. It was a slow night and he also watched us to take notice of our reactions to the sauce. He's a fun guy and i'm always a little sad to not see him when I go."], ["Chris F.", "Their sushi is pretty good. I was elated to discover that they have katsudon, something a lot of Japanese restaurants don't have. I especially like to sit at the bar and chat with the owner.

Despite being squeezed between a BP and an Arby's 10-foot high imposing neon sign, Sushi Tsune is a surprisingly pleasant place to enjoy a meal. Warm, bright, intimate, simple. Very Japanese.Service was a 4 out of 5. Salad was fresh and ginger dressing was delicious.Cons: 1. Sushi rolls left something to be desired. Too much rice, a little skimpy on fish, few imaginative options (I like simple, but these were very basic), and no low-sodium soy sauce (I've become accustomed to this, and the regular is just too salty). If I go back, I'd try a sushi meal instead of the rolls. 2. My fiance got the tempura and teriyaki beef. It was just okay. Not a $20 entree. 3. No draft beer.My personal rating would probably be 2 stars--I have experienced better, and overall, it just wasn't worth the price.

This is not mandatory; as it turns out the last table left that evening was the 'authentic' one, lucky us. Uncomfortable though it was for my monstrous western feet (at first) it was a fun experience. I went up to the bar to try my hand at conversational Japanese and learned a lot. Namely that two years of college Japanese has made me as fluent as a developmentally disabled Japanese 5-year old, but the sushi chef was very patient (they....talk so.... fast!).

Holy cow was it incredible! Delicious Indian spices mixed with a small amount of sweetness from the apples. His words \"that was man's food right there\". I got the spicy tuna sushi roll.

Second, Buku has quite a large gluten free menu (see picture I posted or see here bukuraleigh.com/buku/men\u2026) - seriously, there isn't much on the menu that isn't gluten free to be honest, so I didn't feel like I was being short-changed. Nothing stinks worse than having to be at a restaurant and only being able to eat a salad while everyone else enjoys delicious meals. That being said, I ordered a salad (Sicilian Radicchio and Endive Salad) which was so flavorful and delicious, but I also ordered Empanadas because they make a gluten free version! It was so light and crispy and practically melted in my mouth. You get two with your order and it comes with a heap of yummy guacamole on top. Honestly I wanted to order two more when I was finished because they were just THAT good. I have been dreaming about them (and raving to friends) since I put the last bite in my mouth.

I've only been here during lunch, so maybe it's better at night when there are more servers? I'm not sure, but if you come here for lunch, plan to take the full hour.-Kind of expensive. No BOGO sushi like many other restaurants in the area. The lunch special is $14 and includes a large roll, salad and soup.

My waitress was named Courtney and she was honestly one of the best servers I've ever had in my life. On top of being very friendly and attentive, she made stellar recommendations. I told her I loved Nigiri and was looking for a more traditional type of roll that wasn't smothered in sauce, and she recommended a chef's special rainbow roll. It was literally exactly what I was hoping for, so that was great. I also asked for a good white wine to go with it, and she recommended a Chardonnay (I am kicking myself for forgetting the name of it) because it would bring out the flavor of the fish without overpowering it, and that it wasn't overly acidic but finished smooth... And she was absolutely spot on! It was a great compliment to my sushi. The food came quickly and we always had everything we needed. The dining room has a nice atmosphere- nothing that will knock your socks off, but definitely a nice place. My only small criticism would be that their prices are slightly higher than you might expect. Not a big deal considering the quality of the food, but they are listed as \u00a0only being $$ here when they could easily be $$$. Nothing wrong with that, just something to be aware of. Overall, had an absolute top-notch experience with great food and service was on-point. Would highly recommend, and will definitely be back."], ["Jackie J.", "Best sushi in triangle area. Really fresh fish. Uni and scallops are the best. Just a little bit small therefore pricy."], ["JW C.", "By far and away, Sono is one of my favorite restaurants and places to be in downtown Raleigh. From the freshness and quality of the food, to the pleasantness and professionalism of the staff and service, my experience has always been exceptional. Even when I'm just there to grab a drink or two, the lively environment never fails to entertain.Last night, I had the pleasure of trying two of their newest highly-anticipated offerings: the TONKATSU RAMEN and KOREAN FRIED CHICKEN WINGS. Just thinking about these two dishes makes me drool with my eyes rolled back. The broth of the ramen has a richness in flavor that rivals world-renown establishments, such as Ippudo, while the noodles were on point in al dente wellness. Although it's a given that a good bowl of ramen should be judged primarily by its broth and noodles, what really put it over the top for me was the complexity of the rest of the ingredients. The black mushrooms, the bamboo chutes, the chasu pork, all provide their own depth of savoriness, while absorbing the broth to create a symphonic stroke of culinary genius in one bowl.As if my taste buds weren't already singing, the Korean Fried Chicken wings were a perfect compliment to the ramen, and took me back to my glory days living in Seoul. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside is what defines a great wing, but Sono kicks it up a notch with a garlic soy glaze that's a signature Korean kickback.Whether you're looking for traditional sushi or tasty rolls, the sushi chefs there will deliver. My personal favorite is the chirashi, which is basically a choice mix of fresh sashimi over rice. When I'm in roll-mode, my go-to favorites are the Twisted Mango and the Dragon. ...and this is what makes Sono special to me. The majority of sushi restaurants these days lean towards a more modern identity that focuses on specialty rolls. I'm not knocking this at all, but Sono is one of the few, if not only, that is creative enough to appeal to this new age palatte profile, while staying tried and true to traditional sushi. Compliments to the executive staff and ownership for embracing the new, while paying homage to the past. This is why Sono is the most popular Japanese restaurant in town."], ["Arshree C.", "They know what they're doing here. Ramen is delicious and they made the best Spider Roll I've ever had.

The ramen was absolutely fantastic, as was the surf and turf roll. \u00a0We don't usually order cooked rolls, but I'm really glad we did this time. \u00a0If I were to go back I would order the surf and turf again; that's how good it was. As for the ramen, my husband couldn't name a time when he had had better. \u00a0However, our other items were lackluster. The firecracker shrimp appetizer left a lot to be desired; it was pretty bland and we were both disappointed with it. \u00a0And the tuna ecstacy roll, while very fresh, lacked any sort of \"wow\" factor.Bottom line, give Sono a try. \u00a0And when you do, definitely order the ramen.

My husband had the sushimi and was very pleased as well with the exception of them cutting him short on 18 pieces.

The sushi is extremely fresh, the chefs are nice, the rolls are unbelievable, especially the Amazing Roll-which is truly amazing-which you can order with Toro and it is simply melt in your mouth delish. They have a decent wine list-love the Charles Krug Sauvignon Blanc :) The waitstaff can be a bit strapped since there aren't that many servers but they work hard and are attentive. I can say that I have never eaten anything other than sushi so I can't speak to the other menu items-other than the seaweed salad which is great! I have also never been for lunch. But if you haven't been here yet for dinner you might want to go however the beauty of this place is that it isn't well known and is kind of tucked away so you never have to wait for a table ;)"], ["Michael C.", "Ok - I finally got to eat at Haru, after living 2 blocks away for just about a year. I have to say, I'm sorry I waited this long. Coming from LA, the land of sushi joints on every block, I have high sushi standards. And in LA, cheap yet GOOD sushi is readily available. Not so much in Raleigh. However, Haru comes close to fitting the bill. We shared 2 of the more \"deluxe\" rolls - the Rainbow and the Phoenix. The fish was fresh and delicious, with that wonderful melt-in-your-mouth quality I look for at a good sushi joint. We also shared quite a few (six, maybe) regular rolls (dynamite, spider, etc). Again - very fresh and delicious fish, and not too much unnecessary sauces. We also each had 2 hand rolls. Delicious! The sushi and rolls were served very nicely on 2 very large plates - very appetizing. Oh, and we also ordered dumplings as an appetizer. Yeah, it was a lot of food for two. :) But we hadn't had sushi in 6 months! Total was just over $80, which also included a large Kirin beer. While not \"cheap,\" it was definitely more than reasonable for the quality and the quantity of sushi served. That being said, service was quite slow, but VERY friendly.

Sushi O is in a small(ish) downtown space and was pretty packed at 8Pm(ish) on Saturday night. There isn't a real waiting space inside the restaurant so I'd recommend calling ahead. We didn't because we randomly chose Sushi O given its Glenwood location (and my increasing hunger) and my dim view of nearby local favorite Sushi Blues. We sat at the sushi bar with our bartender serving as both bartender and server somewhat. The space is quite small - it felt a bit claustrophobic and chaotic with servers and patrons alike trying to move around in the cramped space. My coat got knocked off my chair a couple of times by servers and when leaving I felt a bit like a rat in a maze, doing the awkward \"you first. No, after you.\" dance with anyone else that was up and about as well. We ordered three rolls and of course their names escape me now but one was a spicy tuna roll with tempura, another had scallops with crab on top with spicy mayo and masago, and the third and also the most unique was yellow and flat. All were pretty tasty, not spectacular, but colorfully innovatory and a little on the pricey side- whatever, I ended up stuffed. I was happily surprised or appalled - not sure which yet, that the menu was diverse and had a few Vietnamese and other Asian dishes. I'd like to come back and try the pho.

I sat on the patio and took advantage of the everyday 2-for-1 special, sampling the nigiri. My discounted choices were salmon and white tuna, and then I ordered an extra yellowtail nigiri to top it off. I was disappointed to learn from the server that yellowtail was on the list of options exempt from 2-for-1, as the menu didn't include the information. The fish was fresh and had a sweetness to it that I appreciated. The rice, on the other hand, was a bit warmer than I prefer, and it may have been overseasoned. The flavor of the rice distracted from the fish, at times. I appreciated the abundance of carrot-ginger dressing on the house salad, as I often have to stretch the dollop to make it last for the whole dish, at other restaurants.The service was attentive--perhaps overly so for a nearby table, as they were asked frequently if they were ready to order. Water refills were plentiful, and the server was friendly. I felt comfortable dining and catching up on work on the patio."], ["Gilles S.", "Terrible place.

One thing that was different, was they used asparagus instead of cucumbers for two of the rolls. It was tasty.A lot of the rolls on the menu, however were either shrimp tempura or deep fried. This is NOT your japanese mama's house. This is a \"I'm not japanese, but I'm trying to seem culturally aware by liking sushi\" house. I think the three we ordered were the few non-fried ones.

Up until a couple of weeks ago, they offered 25% off at lunch. Now they do BOGO sushi. Be aware that they don't let you have a 'to go' box with the BOGO sushi. However, the waitress was really nice and let me do it since I didn't know. The sushi, I have to say, is slightly better than average. I say that because the rice is the correct temperature and nicely flavored. However, on one occasion when I had tuna nigri the fish looked like it had been cut with a chainsaw. That may have just been a fluke since other times the fish has been nicely cut, if a little too thick. I particularly enjoyed the spicy tuna roll. \u00a0And if you want to know, I prefer the term 'sushi nerd' to 'sushi snob.' :) The service has been great. My water is always kept topped off, but they do not impose too much. It's a pet peeve of mine to have a waiter constantly checking in.

The sushi is high quality, house special rolls are inventive, and the hot appetizers are fantastic. Lots of high notes - best ginger dressing in town, seaweed salad as good as any, piping hot crispy gyozo better than any I've paid $9 for at other sushi places, shumai is amazing, pepper tuna roll is creative and has well developed layers of flavor, and the king kong roll is the best fried roll in town (no soggy batter here). I can even create my own roll - fried shrimp, cream cheese, and jalape\u00f1os. (we call it the Jonathan roll)All you can eat usually means luke warm and uninteresting, but at Orchid, my food, as much as I want, is made fresh as I order it. We just agreed on one low price up front. Honestly, I often compare other sushi places to here as a standard - if its more than $25, no matter how good, I could have gone to Orchid instead (even though its 25 minutes from home).I'm not sure why I've never written a review for Orchid before, as I recommend it to everyone and have been more times than I can remember. I finally decided to write one today, no because I went there, but because I had a contrasting poor experience at another asian restaurant across town. The details aren't important (in another review) but someone suggested that perhaps it was a cultural thing and they just didn't know they made people feel unwelcome. This made me think about my favorite thing about my times at Orchid - I always feel welcome, and am always greeted with a smile like I'm family. My waitress remembers me by first name, knows what I drink, and loves to play with my kids. There's never a moment she's not smiling, and I always feel appreciated. Great food, warm, inviting service, and a good deal. Keep it going my friends."], ["Tiffany C.", "This ALL YOU CAN EAT sushi buffet costs $24.95 per person at dinner, but you can surely eat much more than that money's worth of food. It's not the typical buffet where you hand-pick sushi from a serving line. Instead, you indicate the quantity of each sushi/food option you want on paper, and a server comes take your order. Their menu is pretty extensive, and the beauty of AYCE is that you can try as much variety to your heart's content. Ordering ensures that your food be fresh, but the caveat is the possibly long wait time. In my experience, we ordered a large quantity of food (at least 60 sashimis & 40 sushi rolls), and it took 15-20 minutes for our first sushi to come out. Hearsay says that this is longer than normal, and that the service is usually pretty efficient. Our sushi rolls came out on a large platter. The plating was not anything impressive, but the presentation did not look sloppy either. Our sashimis came out on another plate: Our order of 60 salmon and tuna sashimis may sound like a hefty meal, but each piece was about half the size of an average sashimi slice. I am unsure whether these halved slices were due to our whopping order or whether that is just how it is done here at Orchid. Either way, if you are hungry for more, just place another order. Just make sure you finish everything on your table lest you be charged for uneaten food... Our sushi roll pieces were also small, but you can say that they were comfortably bite-sized. Each unagi roll was like a slightly enlarged tater tot. They could have cut larger slices of eel because the proportion of rice to fish was a bit high. My favorite of the night was the Rainbow Roll - sushi with crabmeat, avocado, and cucumber topped with salmon, tuna and white fish. As a devotee of the dear avocado, I was very pleased with the avacadoes in my sushi. They were bright yellow and green in color and creamy and smooth in taste. Texture was rich, mildly sweet, and each slice melted delicately in my mouth. Aside from the specialty rolls, the menu also offers options for simple sushi rolls: if you want nothing more but rice and your perfect avacado, just order the \"avacado roll.\" There is even an option to create your own sushi roll out of 2-3 sushi items: shrimp tempura, cucumber, crab meat, eel, shrimp, etc. There is also plenty of appetizers and cooked food options in case you are not feeling the raw fish. Stir-fried noodle, spicy shrimp, and steak are some to name a few. Dinner was satisfactory, but the dessert was not. As a table of green tea ice cream enthusiasts, we were quite disappointed with the green tea ice cream here. There was an overwhelming taste of milk, sugar, and cream that drowned out the authentic green tea flavor. Rumor has it though that the tea flavor was more accentuated in the past. The red bean ice cream was not better - it tasted more like vanilla ice cream to me than anything else. Overall, Orchid is not a bad place to go for some casual sushi, so if you are in the mood, grab some friends and check this place out!"], ["Susan P.", "Service: Attentive and friendly. The appetizers come quick, but the sushi takes a while, like we were there an hour and a half for 2 rounds of sushi awhile. \u00a0We were careful how we ordered the first round because anything you don't eat ends up added to the bill.Food: \u00a0The appetizers are small and flavor was lacking on a lot of them. \u00a0Whatever shrimp will be the same popcorn like fried shrimp with a different sauce. \u00a0Calamari is more tempura than squid. \u00a0The sashimi is really small, but you can order lots of it. \u00a0Most of it was good. \u00a0When the menu say 5-8 pieces per sushi roll, expect 5. \u00a0I almost never dip rolls in soy sauce or add wasabi, but I had to do both here to give some of the rolls any flavor. \u00a0If it's not a spicy roll, expect a bland rice roll. \u00a0The spicy ones were just ok. \u00a0Even the ice cream seemed a bit skimped on when the strawberry was just vanilla with strawberry syrup."], ["Mo Y.", "After visiting this place a couple of times for lunch I can give a fair assessment of my experiences here. The concept is great but the execution is horrible. \u00a0The service is slow and the waiters spent more time telling us not to waste food than actually bringing us food. Absolutely rude and annoying! The wait to receive the rolls ordered was extremely long both visits. Not recommended, \u00a0save your time and money. They should focus on serving not insulting guests."], ["Amanda M.", "Don't go. Very little actual fish and tons of rice. The staff were very nice but it just isn't good."], ["Maggie L.", "Mmm. Very good all you can eat. I went for my birthday with friends who liked Asian food/sushi and friends who were kind of scared to try raw fish. All of us ended up having a really good time.

Large variety and everything is made to order and very fast. No wait when we went on a weekend for dinner! Decent pricing--about $25 per person for the all you can eat.

Not sure about weekends"], ["Jon O.", "I went here for the all you can eat lunch sushi buffet and it was pretty decent for what it was. The sushi rolls themselves are fired out fairly quickly after you place your order and while they are not all done up with fancy decorations or a lot of flare they are well enough made for the price you pay. The menu also has a great selection for a sushi buffet. The only other comparison I have is a place in Charlotte that is seriously lacking when compared to Orchid here. They also have no qualms about bringing out whatever or however much you would like from the buffet menu. Also, 5 different types of ice cream. That alone will make me want to go back here to try some more items out."], ["Rudy F.", "The sushi here is pretty good. I went here for lunch and had the AYCE. The sushi was of good quality. I particularly liked the build your own sushi! The appetizers were good too, although I've had better shrimp tempura. The lunch buffet included a drink which was nice. The decor was nice and quiet, and not obnoxious. The staff was friendly and the service was good. If you are going to order the deep fried sushi make sure you have enough food because it takes a lot of time to prepare. Unfortunately they did not have all the flavors of ice cream, so we had to settle for red bean. Overall it was a good experience! :)"], ["Cassandra C.", "We come from a city that boasts a lot of all-you-can-eat sushi, so we were pretty pleased to finally find a place in the Triangle that does it. It's usually a pretty decent deal and it's fun - you get to try lots of different things typically for a lower price than if you ordered them all off the menu. We went on a Wednesday evening around 5pm as we were in the area that afternoon. When we came in there was only one other table filled, but by the time we left it was quite busy. The dinner AYCE is $25.95 pp and includes soft drinks or tea. We got started by ordering sweet potato tempura (my fave!), shrimp tempura, and gyoza. The tempura was good, not too oily and very hot. The gyoza were average, nothing special. We then moved on to the sushi menu - my husband ordered tuna and tamago nigiri (both were good, average size). They offer lots of different sushi rolls - regular one-ingredient rolls, specialty rolls, and make your own rolls, where you can select two or three ingredients to roll together. In our experience, the make your own were MUCH better than the special rolls. Of the special rolls, we ordered the Hawaiian roll which was topped with a lot of coconut sauce, Pepper Tuna roll topped with a lot of sriracha, and a Honey Bee roll topped with lots of honey-mustard (I think) sauce. The special rolls were all drenched in their respective sauces which was not to our tastes, but seems to be very common in the Triangle. The make your own rolls came out sometimes topped with eel sauce and sometimes bare. All rolls were inside out (i.e., rice on the outside rather than seaweed) which was a bit surprising but didn't affect the taste. We didn't find the rolls were mostly rice as other reviews indicate. All ingredients tasted fresh, especially the fish. After we ate way too much sushi, we ordered shrimp shumai (not very good, and greasy) and another order of sweet potato tempura which was very different from our first order - dripping with grease and not as tasty. We finished our meal with green tea and my husband had a scoop of green tea ice cream (included in the AYCE), which he said was pretty good. With tax and tip our total was around $64, which is a little expensive for a regular outing but it was for a birthday so not bad for a special occasion. I probably wouldn't go again, but the sushi was on par with other sushi options in the Triangle and the novelty of it is fun once in a while."], ["Grace W.", "I love sushi. I often have strange cravings, and feel the need to dive into a sushi boat head first and solely consume the entire thing. But there's one issue with my dream. Sushi is hella expensive! That's why I love this place. You pay a set price (about $16 for lunch, and $25 for dinner) and can literally consume a sushi boat (minus the boat, mind you). The food is of great quality and arrives at your table relatively quickly. The atmosphere is very casual, and the restaurant is pretty tiny, allowing it to feel intimate. The only thing I wasn't such a fan of was the service. Our waitress was more concerned with making sure we knew not to waste any food than with taking our order. She actually got into a bit of an argument with the patrons across from us! All in all, great quality sushi for a reasonable price, although the service might not be top notch. I would recommend to all sushi lovers!"], ["Dallas A.", "Best sushi deal I know of: $16 dollars to eat all you want at lunch, no buffets involved. You order from a menu and they'll keep bringing them out until you've achieved sushi bliss. :)Sushi is excellent, service is top notch. Decor is muted and quiet, which is a welcome break from flashy neon 'Hibachi' joints with poor food. Makes the sushi pop even more."], ["Chuck N.", "We ate so much salmon that they started halving our pieces and counting them as one, and they did this twice! \u00a0By the end of our meal, our served salmon was still defrosting!The menu is plentiful and the rolls are delicious and infinite as long as your stomach can keep up! \u00a0I didn't expect quality AYCE sushi in Raleigh, I was wrong, Orchid is great!"], ["Nancy T.", "All you can eat made to order sushi and sashimi including any appetizers, non-alcoholic drinks and dessert for less than $30 is such a great deal. I liked the customized sushi rolls that I could create to order. The ambiance is very nice and they were able to accommodate a party of 12 ppl very easily. The service was fast and I like how they don't waste paper and use the re-usable laminated order cards with erasable marker. The sashimi was melt in your mouth delish (I ordered quite a bit of this) and liked the variety of apps like the udon noodles, tempura sweet potatoes, ribeye steak and shrimp sides. Never used the lights on the table - they could prob do away with those but interesting concept. Bonus- Red bean ice cream takes me back to childhood :)"], ["Christopher H.", "No one to greet at door, had to wait. Green tea was so bad it made me sick to my stomach. Miso soup was decent.

The rolls were good- not the best I've had but the roll with mango and the one with jalepeno were delicious. The drunken noodles had a strong basil taste to them, but overall, it was really good. It comes with both chicken and shrimp. Servers were courteous and we had a great experience at Orchid!"], ["Mage L.", "I had heard Orchid was All You Can Eat sushi for $24. \u00a0This was intriguing, but then I found out that they had lunch AYCE for only $14. \u00a0I really couldn't pass this up, so my husband and I arranged to meet for lunch on Friday.Upon being seated, we were given two sheets of paper and a pencil, and we were told to fill in the quantity for each selection. We were also informed they had a regular menu that was priced per dish, but it was basically the same items that were on the AYCE menu. My husband was checking for tonkatsu, since it's his favorite Japanese dish, but unfortunately they didn't have it. \u00a0I checked the menu prior, and I figured there would be enough other cooked food he could probably find something he would eat.I picked out a tuna nigiri, inarizushi (tofu skin with rice inside), the peanut and avocado rolls, and the spicy yellowtail rolls. \u00a0I also got the miso soup as an appetizer, some edamame to share, a seaweed salad, and some red bean ice cream for dessert. \u00a0My husband picked out an order of spring rolls, gyoza, the steak teriyaki, and green tea ice cream.We were given some extra ordering sheets and were told that if we wanted more food at any time, to just fill out the sheet and press the light and the waiter would come to fill our order. \u00a0I don't have a whole lot of time for lunch though, so we just decided what we ordered should be enough.The edamame came out first, and it was typical edamame. \u00a0It was warm and salted, and it tasted just like edamame normally does. \u00a0The soup came out a bit later, and it was a bit sparse for miso soup, lacking in tofu and seaweed. \u00a0But it wasn't bad. \u00a0The salad came out as a garden salad, not the seaweed salad I had ordered, but my husband ate it and said it was good. \u00a0I didn't want to bother ordering the seaweed salad again since I had probably already ordered more than enough to fill our appetites. The spring rolls were a bit doughy but still good, and the gyoza was quite tasty, exactly what I wanted the gyoza to taste like. \u00a0All the food ended up coming fairly quickly, except for the ice cream. \u00a0My sushi came out in a nice, large platter, nicely organized. \u00a0The avocado peanut rolls looked as weird as they tasted, yet I ate them all. \u00a0There's something oddly good about them. \u00a0The tuna and tofu nigiri were pretty good. \u00a0The spicy yellowtail roll ended up looking and tasting something like shredded yellowtail, mixed in with chili mayo. \u00a0I was a bit disappointed they didn't have full yellowtail nigiri, but I found out later they offer additional rolls and nigiri in the dinner meal. \u00a0I guess that's why they charge $24 for dinner and only $14 for lunch.My husband's steak teriyaki was a really small portion. \u00a0I guess the benefit is you have enough room to try everything they offer there. \u00a0It was good, but not really enough for a full meal size. \u00a0But at least we ordered enough other food, it wasn't as if my husband could possibly walk away from the meal hungry.It took a while for the ice cream and bill to come out. \u00a0I guess they were surprised we weren't ordering more food. \u00a0But I really liked the ice cream, it had small chunks of real red bean in it. \u00a0My husband's green tea wasn't as good to me, but he said he liked it better.$14 would be more than I usually spend at lunch, but I thought the quality and quantity of food was decent enough that it was worth it. \u00a0I wouldn't mind coming back again for the dinner $24 AYCE, since the dinner menu would include the yellowtail nigiri that I love so much. \u00a0The trick will be trying to get my husband to come back, since they don't have tonkatsu like they do at Yuri."], ["Derek R.", "The best all you can eat sushi place I've ever had. They do have a limited selection to choose from, but I always leave full. The appetizers are great as well, especially the spicy shrimp, calamari, and steak. Top it off with ice cream and you're good to go!"], ["Julia H.", "I'd been craving sushi for a few days when a review of Orchid popped up, and then I knew that settling myself down for some serious eating was in my near future!The spouse and I stopped by on a Tuesday for a late lunch, and Orchid did not disappoint at all. We decided on the all-you-can-eat option for the variety, and started with the seaweed salad. Wow, what a portion! I almost regretted ordering it because that alone could do as a lunch for me -- fortunately, I'd skipped breakfast. We moved on to the shrimp tempura roll (delicious, with crispy cucumber to complement the crispy shrimp), eel and avocado roll (eel was tender and not bony at all), mixed vegetable roll (with carrot, avocado and. . .lettuce?), peanut avocado roll (not a peanut sauce like I thought, but with whole roasted peanuts!) and -- my favourite of favourites -- sweet potato tempura roll! So. Good. We finished off with the deliciously astringent green tea ice cream and richly luscious red bean ice cream.I'd wanted to try the udon, but there was a bit of a language barrier with the waitress and I was unable to get across that what I wanted to know was if the *broth* for the udon was made with meat, not what meats I could choose to come with it. I did find out that the vegetable dumplings contain shrimp, so vegetarians take note. *Note -- the dumplings are now shrimp-free, and are delicious!*The decor was spare, with a colour scheme verging on cold, but not to the point of blandness; not exactly romantic yet neither cheap-looking. Service was very good, with the mix of attentiveness and know-when-to-let-them-eat that I find preferable, and there were plenty of choices for everyone from vegans to hardcore meat addicts with options for every level of appetite. The price was right for a nice lunch, and the extended dinner menu looks to be a good value for the cost as well. We're already planning to go back and give that a whirl, too, once my appetite has recovered!"], ["Eric S.", "Great service, the staff are extremely polite and friendly, the food is wonderful, always made to order.

The miso soup was delicately flavored, like it's supposed to be, it was very good. The pork dumplings were tasty but just a tad greasy, room for improvement there. The tempura shrimp and calamari were just about perfect. The sesame chicken alone is worth the trip. We shared several rolls. I created one with cream cheese, crab meat, and jalapeno and it was good! A sushi jalapeno popper! The Hawaiian roll and the volcano roll stand out as particularly good. The udon noodles were really nice, I can see myself getting that as a take out order on a cold winter day. Also had the red bean ice cream.. yum! The only thing that would have made it better is if the red bean ice cream was mochi ice cream. The wait staff was friendly and very helpful. I love the way they do the buffet. You don't go up to a table and get the food, you order it freshly made from the wait staff and when you're ready for more, you press on a little light at your table and they are there in a flash to take your order. Well thought out. I am by no means a sushi expert, and I won't pretend to be. I thought this was good fresh food at a reasonable price, done in a very clever way.

Everyone I have gone with has enjoyed the experience of AYCE sushi. Generally AYCE restaurants only appeal to me for variety because I don't enjoy stuffing myself, but Orchid has a nicely varied menu available to select from.The appetizer menu has some good choices, but I wouldn't recommend the miso soup. The soup almost feels like instant; normally miso soup will cloud up in a very distinct pattern if you let it sit for a few minutes, but my soup just seemed to separate. On the other hand, the salmon teriyaki appetizer and the tempura (try requesting vegetables!) are great. I love being able to order small plates of each appetizer that I find interesting without racking up a huge bill.The sushi and sashimi section of the menu also has good variety, but they do tend to stick with more common ingredients. I haven't personally noticed much of a difference between the quality of common sushi around the triangle, and the quality at Orchid has been fine for me. Strangely enough, you can order sashimi for both Inari and Tamago, but I definitely still prefer the sushi version for these. The rainbow roll comes topped with three different kinds of fish (two pieces of sushi per type of fish) and is fun to order for a table. The owners and wait staff are friendly and attentive, and I'm sure I'll be back to Orchid again."], ["Nathan H.", "Got takeout.

I was on a quest. I sat down for their Lunch Buffet (which, is not actually a buffet at all!) at $13.95 a person. I was given options of sushi rolls, individual pieces, soups, salads, appetizers, noodle dishes, ice cream and more. I was a little blown away at first.So first things first, I ordered glass of Pinot Grigo (to help work up to my $30 and wino facade) and looked at my choices. Upon deciding I got to press this SWEET touch light to let the waitress know I was ready. Aside from the food and service, this touch light impressed me the most. Really. How smart!I received a ton of food. A TON OF FOOD. I was able to try and taste various items of the menu and was pleased with everything. Their spicy tuna and spicy salmon rolls are delicious! And, for those of you spice freaks like myself, you should know that they are not entirely spicy - yet still tasty!My waitress came back and asked what else I wanted. \"Are you serious? I'm stuffed!\" But let it be known, when they say \"All You Can Eat\" they mean just that: All You Can Eat!My total was only around $20 at this point so I ordered a few rolls to take home to snack on later and that completed my transaction.This was by far one of the most filling lunch specials I've found in the area.

Our waitress was really nice. She was a total chinese mum who talked to us softly and smiled A LOT. We ordered the hot green tea that she had never failed to refill. The green tea was also japanese matcha (not powdered), which I love!! The seaweed salad was on a bed of julienne cucumbers, your typical flavour - Yummy. The gyoza was chinese style pan fried, and plump with pork. The gyoza dipping sauce was sweet/sour soy sauce, YUMMMM. We got the shrimp udon, which was stir-fryed with veggies (asparagus, carrot, zucchini) and big shrimp. NOT your dinky baby shrimp. It was also de-veined, which I've found some chinese restaurants not doing = PLUS. It wasn't oily or sticky. The teriyaki Salmon was placed on a bed of steamed veggies and a scoop of rice. The salmon had that amazing grilled \"crust\", that gave it that smoky flavour. It was glazed with delicious teriyaki sauce, not too sweet or salty. Really good.These \"entrees\" were brought out in small portioned, which I really love because they don't force you to gorge yourself one single entree. This gives you room to try a lot of different stuff!We got a bunch of sashimi, which were really fresh. The white tuna was delicious!!! The squid was sweet. We must have ended up getting 30+ pieces.

The mango sauce is actually mango puree. =DI've never been to a made to order sushi buffet before, and I have really enjoyed their food.

There were a good amount of rolls to choose from- I'd say about 20-25? If you want something that is not on the list, you can just order rolls separately. They are BOGO. I did not want any soup, so the waiter allowed me to order 2 apps- I ordered the gyoza and the crab Rangoon- pretty standard and delish. On to the rolls! Each roll was about 6 pieces. I'm not sure if you order BOGO rolls if there will be more pieces. I ordered the Raleigh Roll, Crunchy Roll, Philadelphia Roll and the Chicken Tempura roll. All this food only set me back $10.95. I believe it's 19.95 for dinner. All were delish, really. I was surprised!

But he did well, he was very efficient and I never felt neglected. I heard him describing dishes to other guests, so he knows his stuff! And a closing note- I still love the Mongolian beef!

With that said I'm willing to sacrifice a little for a good deal but not so much so that I don't enjoy my meal. I was hoping Sushi-Thai would be that sweet spot where you get some decent sushi at a good price but that wasn't the case. The sushi here was very Meh for me. Not bad but nothing I would want to eat again regardless of a good deal. I can get better BOGO sushi elsewhere and the same could be said for the Pad Thai we ordered.

Check their website for their daily specials. I've heard good things about their Thai food as well but have never ordered of the Thai menu. I'm assuming they are owned by the same folks as the Cary Sushi Thai however I don't believe the quality of food is as good as the Cary restaurant which is why I've given them 4 stars instead of 5.I really enjoy their spicy tuna roll here it's not like any I've ever had. Instead of chopped up tuna mixed with spicy mayo it's a real piece of tuna with a slightly spicy chili sauce I believe, whatever it is it's addicting.You can always get a seat here no matter what night of the week it is. Which is why I frequent here often. Take out is BOGO to and you can't beat a healthy sushi meal for less them $15. The staff is always friendly whether I'm dining in or taking out. They can accommodate big groups as well which is great.

We go here frequently."], ["Brit B.", "I think Tokyo house may just be the best sushi place in town. \u00a0Huge, thick cut pieces of sashimi and very reasonably priced. \u00a0The Escolar, one of my faves, is usually one of the more expensive on the list, \u00a0but at TH, it's priced right there with salmon and yellow-tail. \u00a0If you like rolls order the Minwoo (comes with LOTS of Escolar on the outside) or the California roll. \u00a0David makes the thickest Cali roll I have ever seen with 3 kinds of fish on the outside."], ["Bryce K.", "Making customers wait for over an hour for sushi is a great way to make people think your food tastes awesome.My wife and I went here because of the Groupon. \u00a0 It was pretty full that night so instead of waiting, we elected to take our shoes off and sit on the floor at the low tables in the other room. \u00a0Sitting on the floor (on very scuzzy and flat pillows) was fun until about the first 60 minutes of waiting for our 5 roll sushi order (two California, two spider, and a shrimp tempura) to come out. \u00a0The waitress was very nice about the wait and even threw some free edamame at us to keep us happy (very high marks for the waitress). \u00a0If were not so famished, we would have given the sushi a grade of 'just OK'. \u00a0The prices are fair, as most rolls are under $7. If you don't live in Six Forks or have a Groupon, you will probably pass 3 sushi places in the price range that you will be just as happy with, so no need to go out of your way."], ["Pamela M.", "Love this place & have never had a bad experience. The food is great, the prices are reasonable, & the staff is great. My favorites are the golden crunchy rolls. I would rather they serve Coke products though."], ["Chris P.", "This place is one of my favorite Sushi Bars in Raleigh. \u00a0Everything is fresh and tasty, they have excellent specialty rolls and a good variety of nigiri and sashimi offerings. \u00a0Service is usually very good, but on the weekends it does get busy. \u00a0One of my favorite things about this place, aside from the great food is the Tatami room. \u00a0If you want to have a party a group of friends for a meal, or an intimate meal with your gf/wife, \u00a0the Tatami room is highly recommended. \u00a0You will, however, need to call in advance to reserve the Tatami room. \u00a0The decor is a bit dated, but very clean. \u00a0The sushi chef's are also excellent."], ["Petite M.", "I have been a Tokyo House customer for many years. The food is excellent. I am an avid sushi and sushimi eater. I come from the Chapel Hill/Cary \u00a0area \u00a0to eat here (I frequently stay in CH or Cary when I'm in the area for business) \u00a0. Contrary to some of the other reviews I've read; I've never found this place to be dirty or crawling with insects of any type. The restaurant sits in a plaza and is a nice surprise. The fish is some of the best compared to the others in the area. The sushi chefs' are always pleasant and friendly. I frequently travel to the area for business from CA. whenever I travel I always try to find a good sushi bar; I've yet to find any place that serves as fresh. I love the Niguro (tuna) sashimi and soft shell crab. I always take visitors and fellow associates who come to town. When my family travels with me they always request this place over others, I consider this place the top place in the Triangle area - we have tried them all in Durham, Chapel Hill and Raleigh. I can't count the number of times we've been there. If you're in a big rush and not wiling to sit - do not go to a sushi bar. Service does change hands, but the chefs are consistant. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED can't wait to return, it's always relaxing and delicious."], ["Kevin P.", "Best sushi I've found in Raleigh. Great choices, great prep, good atmosphere. Not overly pretentious , good prices. I haven't tried every sushi place in Raleigh, but after having gone to 7 or 8, this is the winner so far. (and try the dynamite bowl!)"], ["Glenn R.", "Fantastic atmosphere, great sushi and tempura. \u00a0They have private rooms with \"floor tables\" for groups over 5. \u00a0My kids love the place. \u00a0Great service and energy."], ["Sabrina S.", "I have been looking for a sushi joint where I can get sushi on my way home from work. Somewhere you can pop in wearing workout clothes etc. for a quick dinner, \u00a0get some quality sushi. \u00a0THIS IS THE PLACE! Service was very friendly, the sushi bar itself was a nice size. but a \u00a0little brightly lit, but the booths were cozy. \u00a0The Tuna Maguri and Salmon were both FRESH, had great stridations/color, not \u00a0at all fishy, \u00a0and was cut well. \u00a0The Hawaii roll was beautifully prepared, and had tons of fish and blue crab. \u00a0Even the spider roll for 5.98, was an awesome, large hand rolled maki, with huge softshell crab claws in two pcs. \u00a0The basic spicy tuna roll was loaded with tuna, and it was really good and cold. The only weird thing was that \u00a0when we ordered calamari, they brought us tempura octopus tentacles, we thought they were crab legs at first glance, but they were definetly octopus. \u00a0They turned out to be tender and flavorful served that way, and we didn't mind, but did feel a little perplexed at the \"swtichery\"! \u00a0I would definetly go back because the sushi was actually really fresh and good for a strip mall place, and there wasn't a wait on a Saturday night at 8:30."], ["pete a.", "Food for the price is good"]], "Ajisai Japanese Fusion": [["Marie B.", "In town for work and found Ajisai on Yelp. Called in take out and the service for even the 5 minutes I was in there was great. Can't beat the sushi either!"], ["Kristen R.", "I'm always looking out for good sushi in the area and after reading such good reviews, I had to try it out. First off, I really love the decor! The ambiance is fresh, modern and clean. The music is a bit loud, but tasteful. I had the free appetizer yelp offer and we got the haru maki (spring rolls) along with the rock shrimp. The spring rolls were mushy and not incredibly flavorful, but the shrimp made up for it- perfectly crispy and a little spicy. We noticed after finishing it that the bowl it came in was cracked all down the side with a chunk of glass missing! (Honestly not sure how we didn't notice it until after...I'm surprised no one in the kitchen saw it?) Yikes. Anyways, we got the Ajisai roll and the angry dragon roll. Both were delicious! Very unique flavors, I loved the basil oil on the dragon roll. Unexpected, but very yummy! As for the service, our waiter was not very attentive, but nice. We never waited too long for anything and the food came out promptly, even on a busy night, so not really complaining on that. Overall, I enjoyed my experience here and will definitely be back!"], ["Lauryn C.", "Wow I'm in love. This is some of the best sushi I have ever had in the Triangle. Ajisai have been on my radar for awhile with all their amazing reviews. A great location in Cameron Village with an awesome patio. They have done a great job decorating the place it's casual but still has a little of that upscale feel.Check in on your Yelp app for some free edamame. Of course this is what we started with and there are no complaints here it was fresh and delicious. We decided on 3 rolls the, Tomo, Pink Lady, and Manhattan. They were all good I really have a hard time picking a favorite, but I have to say the Pink Lady was the most unique. I've never had a sushi roll made out of black rice before I loved it. It was topped with a red wine pear so good. I also enjoyed the other rolls and the jalapeno citrus sauce that came with the Manhattan. These were big rolls and I probably over ordered but my friend and I finished every bite. Did I mention we also ordered two orders of sashimi? Yeah well that happened too and no regrets the salmon sashimi was the freshest I've ever had here in Raleigh. I had the opportunity to speak with Joy who is one of the managers of the restaurant she just moved here from Brooklyn and I was thrilled to find out the backround on this place. There is another sushi restaurant they own in Manhattan and they ship all their fish in fresh from NY sometimes even twice a day if they have to.I was so happy with my meal and all of the sushi was spectacular. I can't wait to check out some of their other menu items. We also shared a bottle of Malbec the wine prices are really great here you can find plenty of choices between $22-$30.They offer a discount to students as well which is awesome. I really enjoyed the staff and they were super friendly but I do think they need to train the waiters on the menu a little better. Considering they just opened I'm sure they will work out some of the serving kinks here soon.Big thank you for the awesome birthday cake it was so kind of them to bring it out. It also was super delicious you can't go wrong with a fried cheesecake - tempura fried I might add oh my so good!Come check out this locally owned addition to the Raleigh restaurant scene. You will not be disappointed."], ["Jenny C.", "I got the box B bento box of salmon sushi. Very tasty and filling. The avocado and eel maki roll was super tasty and I love that they put eel sauce on the side of rice. It seems small but DONT BE FOOLED because this is delicious. Also used the free appetizer for the spring rolls. Hot and fresh!"], ["Alice F.", "Amazing service and really good sushi!! Server was incredibly attentive. Sushi fresh and flavorful. Beautiful and nice decor as well. Good for a date night or a casual meal."], ["Derek S.", "straight solid // take-out service was exceptional // best hot & sour soup i've had to date // Manhattan roll was the headliner"], ["Heather M.", "Check in here and you'll get a free order of haru maki or edamame, your pick!It's a cute & tiny sushi restaurant in Cameron village.The restaurant is clean and well decorated. They had special rolls with descriptions that sounded pretty unique, but no killer combos or deals to choose from.I got the Godzilla roll which I imagined would be a huge impressive roll- come on, its named the Godzilla roll!!! Welp, they fooled me. Only 5 pieces. It had a tasty flavor combination, but five measly pieces? That's five bites.We also got the tuna/salmon lover. Again, small pieces- and also a bit chewy.However, presentation was stunning! Sigh, if only appearance satisfied the tummy...Service was quick because it was pretty empty. I give this place a solid 'good'- nothing exceptional."], ["Haolong Y.", "Absolutely first choice in Cameron Village! Love it! Running by a friendly Chinese woman and the atmosphere is excellent!"], ["Ed H.", "Excellent! Awesome lunch deals, and delicious sushi and curry.Highly recommend this if you're ever in Raleigh.Love the free Appetizer for Yelp users!!"], ["Austin S.", "Brief: Excellent food. Poor service. Hope it is a one time thing, will try again because the food was that good.Details: Made reservations for 2 at 8:00 PM on a Friday. Arrived promptly at 8 and was surprised at how small the restaurant was. Felt more like a quick sushi bar for lunch type atmosphere than Friday night date night. If you're looking for that kind of ambiance you're better off with Sono or Mura. Back to the service - I could see an empty 4 top (which we were eventually seated at) but was told by the hostess if would be a 15-20 minute wait unless we wanted to sit out side. My wife preferred indoors, so we opted against. Irritated with the open table despite our reservations I asked the hostess what the point of making reservations was if there weren't tables ready for such occasions. She stared at me blankly until the manager stepped over and intervened. She asked us to wait outside at a table while she got a table ready for us inside.I should have prefaced with the fact that it was obvious as soon as we walked in that the service staff was overwhelmed and sinking quickly.Our waiter was actually quite good, but again we could tell he was anxious and visibly had a hurried look about him all evening. We ordered ordered 2 starters, an entree and two sushi rolls. During the wait for starters the hostess tried to bring us another tables check then took it to two other tables before finding the right one. We watched a family get served in at least five minute intervals. And overhead a party of at least 8 complaining about 3 sushi rolls they had yet to receive an hour after everyone else's food had been served at the table. We were fortunate enough to avoid these blunders. Closest we came was having the started brought out separately, my rolls were a few minutes ahead of my wife's entree and we almost didn't get her salad/my soup (came out after we mentioned it to server as he brought our mains). Not perfect, but tolerable.The food was really quite good, the sushi was on par with several of the other Raleigh staples. Would have been a 5 star review if the ambiance were a little better (even just dimming the bright lights a little) and there wasn't such an overwhelmingly nervous/anxois/irritated atmosphere. Firm believer in second chances, so I will try them again and hope this was just an off night for the team."], ["Blake L.", "First time trying Ajisai, was very impressed with the Thai noodles & chicken dish. Sushi was also delicious and I noticed they had great lunch specials. Checked-in for the free appetizer although they only let you pick from two of the cheapest ones. I thought this was America?! Cost them the coveted 5th star but we'll be back :D"], ["Anna V.", "This place has the best lunch special! $12 for three full size sushi rolls (none of that 4 pieces bull) and soup/salad. Definitely the best lunch special in the area that I've found! I tried going to Mura in North Hills for their lunch special but it cost me $15 for only two small rolls and no soup or salad....Now I make the drive to Ajisai."], ["Cynthia P.", "The food was really good...Loved the Deep Fried Volcano roll!!! Staff very attentive."], ["Michael T.", "Travel all over the country, always looking for a great sushi spot, found it here in Raleigh!Try the Sweet Heart roll, outstanding! \u00a0All of the fish was fresh, service was outstanding, make sure to ask for the owner Polly, constantly making sure customers are happy!Great experience!"], ["Abby L.", "Really pleased with this place. Delicious and affordable sushi offerings at a reasonable prices, especially at lunch. I've been twice and tried three different rolls each time. All were amazing. My friend got a non-sushi teriyaki chicken and was very pleased. Nice outdoor seating. Pleasant staff. Hope this places stays around for a while."], ["Lindsay H.", "Not the worst and not the best sushi I've ever had.Ajisai has a great lunch deal of two sushi rolls, a salad, and miso soup for around $10. However, their other signature rolls are very overpriced. There are places in Raleigh that offer better rolls at better prices. I would be willing to eat there and see if that makes a difference, but overall, I think there are better places."], ["Carrie L.", "This place has great sushi prices - my boyfriend and I get it to go quite often, and the two of us always think it's great. My only qualm with this place is that their tuna sashimi doesn't always taste great - makes me wonder about the quality. But otherwise, this place is a good, reliable, affordable option for sushi."], ["Viktoriya M.", "So we came just for an appetizer and quickly were tempted to try their special Ajisai roll. I'm a sushi prof and let me tell you this roll was beyond my expectancy. I'm not sure about other items but this one was a bomb. Edamame was great and overall experience left us with a feeling of coming back. Oh and yes, purple color is a great great designer touch. Looks sharp!"], ["Rachel A.", "Japanese food is one of my favorite cuisines, and Ajisai is near my house, so from time to time I will pick it up. For the most part, its not too bad, but it is also nothing to write home about. Their salad with ginger dressing has a touch too much ginger in my opinion, as with their shrimp sauce. It's not a place that I would rave about or really recommend to someone even, but its also not somewhere that I think is terrible or should go out of business. Generally, its just a lack luster Japanese restaurant, that will sort of satisfy a craving."], ["Anil O.", "I didn't think the fish was fresh, tasted spongy and the rice wasn't good either. I will try it again to see why this restaurant is getting so many good reviews but so far I am not impressed with sushi in Raleigh."]]}
