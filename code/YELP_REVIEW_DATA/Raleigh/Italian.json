The restaurant decor/architecture was wonderful and helped create a sophisticated but yet simple atmosphere. I especially loved the high/open ceiling design. It felt super classy!Since it was Mother's Day, the regular menu was not available, as there was a MD's buffet from 11-4pm. I had looked up the buffet menu online earlier that week, as my mother requested eating at a place that served beef/steaks (a difficult thing to do when looking at Mother's Day brunch buffets). I settled on Mia Francesca because of the mention of a charcuterie platter, prime rib, and salmon. The food didn't disappoint - which was especially good because of the steep $39 per head charge. There was a lot of food at the buffet, but the dishes that stood out to me the most were the shrimp cocktail, the charcuterie board, the prime rib, and the salmon. The shrimp they served was well cooked, with the shrimp meat being both very crisp and tender. The cocktail sauce was excellent (not sure if it's because I haven't had shrimp cocktails in a while, but oh myyy, the cocktail sauce was delicious), and both my dad and I probably consumed more of the shrimp cocktails than any other dish available. The charcuterie board had prosciutto, what I think was pancetta, and at least two types of salami. I'm not sure if it had more variety in terms of meats, but I did very much enjoy the meats they had. I feel that although the meats were good, they could have improved on the variety. Maybe they could have added some type of pate into the mix? The cheeses on the board were probably the most mediocre thing at the buffet that day. If I recall correctly, the cheese were mostly hard/semi-hard cheese that tasted,to me, mostly bland. There was the standard fare of sharp white cheddar, swiss, and what was probably colby. I did not enjoy the cheeses as much as I was hoping to; they didn't particularly complement the meats well, nor did they provide much deliciousness by themselves. I wish they had provided a better variety of cheese, maybe some brie, goat cheese, or pecorino... just something more noteworthy. The prime rib was cooked very well, medium-well to medium depending on the part your slice was cut from. It came with a creamy horseradish sauce that was very enjoyable. The salmon was also cooked very well - it was silky and not dried out in the least. The price might have been a little high in retrospect - the food was very, very delicious, but the buffet was maybe worth just a few dollars short of $39... maybe I would be thinking differently if they included Mimosa's or Bloody Mary's in the \"complimentary\" drinks selection."], ["Guy C.", "3 of 5 stars (average, fine dining).(see explanation of ratings below)Allow 50-70 minutes (no dessert).Average entr\u00e9e price: $24.Allow about $40-$45 per person (one drink, no dessert, gratuity not included).Technically, this is fine dining, but it's a chain, and it has none of the class, elegance or creativity on the menu of it's next-door neighbor, Flights (for just one example).Pea pod salad is nice and simple: sugar snap peas, chopped tomatoes and sliced cucumber with a light lemon dressing.Halibut was overcooked and had way too much of the accompanying sundried tomatoes, basil, pinenuts, red bell peppers, & petite arugula salad (actually, we didn't even see the arugula).They charge too much for their wines and cocktails.About my ratings:Only fine dining establishments can garner five stars. \u00a0Until yelp realizes that a fast food joint cannot possibly be ranked equally with a $100 per person place, I need to draw the line somewhere. \u00a0If we were only talking about the quality and presentation of the food, it would be a different story. \u00a0But, as we know, yelp's rankings take into account the entire dining experience.Therefore, I divide restaurants into three categories (and I wish yelp would do the same):1) fast food and \"fast-casual\" (no table service).2) casual dining (table service, average entr\u00e9e price: $10-$20).3) fine dining (linen napkins, no plastic cups, no TV's in dining room, average entr\u00e9e priced at more than $20).Fine dining can earn a max of five stars. \u00a0Casual dining can earn a max of four stars. \u00a0Fast food can earn a max of three stars."], ["Patricia J.", "Held a business dinner in the reserved balcony seating.

Overall it was a positive experience, although I found the restaurant hard to find in the sprawling North Hills shopping center. I look forward to trying a pasta dish the next time I come."], ["Whitney M.", "We went here for my sisters birthday dinner mainly because we both had gift certificates. I was a little skeptical because I have read previous reviews for Mia Francesca. The food was good but the service was a little slow and we were one of about four tables in the whole restaurant. To start we all ordered a round of drinks. My husband ordered Big Boss ($5), I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio ($5), and my sister a sangria ($10). We ordered calamari and the meat and cheese tray for the table to share. The calamari was good, however we did have to add lemon and pepper to give it a bit more flavor ($9.50). I wasn't really a fan of the meat and cheese tray ($15). There were two kinds of meat, two cheeses, bread, fig jam and olives. The cheese was a Parmesan and a type of cheese that was like blue cheese. I didn't really like either cheese and I love cheese! Our waiter let us know that they just got a brand new menu. My husband and I ordered a cesar salad and then decided to split the Veal Cappellacci ($23). The salad was standard but our entree was out of this world! It was absolutely delicious and so glad we split it! It was a house made pasta filled with prosciutto, braised veal, pancetta, savoy cabbage, \u00a0tomatoes, and a fontina cream sauce. It was so good!! Our waiter told us that was his favorite meal and I can see why! My sister also got the same dish we did. My brother-in-law got the Linguine Del Mar ($22). It was pasta with sea scallops, gulf shrimp, cherry tomatoes, & basil. I had one of his shrimp and it was really good. Both my sister and brother-in-law took home leftovers. There dishes are definitely big enough to split! Lastly we had a check-in special through yelp for a free profiterole filled with pistachio ice cream and covered in chocolate sauce. It was okay. Glad it was free because I wouldn't order that again.So, overall dinner was very good but service was quite slow. Our waiter didn't bring our entrees out so I had to ask the lady that brought it out to get our waiter because we all needed refills. And then after we were all finished with our meals it took him quite some time to check on us which was strange since there was no one in the restaurant.

This is not the official name (I can't actually remember the real name), but they should know what you are talking about if you order it this way; look for the the chicken and mushroom pasta dish on the menu. The sauce is what really makes this so delicious and I always look forward to eating my left-overs for lunch the next day. Josh never has left-overs himself.They have a good selection of wine here and the prices are reasonable at dinner, but not reasonable enough for us to eat here regularly, so we always look forward to going here every once in awhile for whatever occasion we have.

They did not seat anyone else after we sat at the bar and noticed that all 8-10 of the other tables that were in the restaurant did not have any food. It's clear that they can't handle a Friday afternoon rush nor can their kitchen and wait staff handle their restaurant when it is not even at full capacity.

I think we all looked like out-of-towners so she spent some time with us looking at the menu and letting us know about the specials that night. \u00a0We ordered drinks and I ordered the table a plate of Risotto Balls since the previous yelp reviews had recommended it. \u00a0Luckily the app had a total of four balls (our party was a table of 4) so there was no fighting or having to split any. \u00a0They were melt in your mouth delicious and the marinara sauce they rested on was quite tasty as well.For my main entree, I ordered the Family Gravy. \u00a0In-house-made pasta, metall, house-made spicy sausage, sweet sausage, braised boneless beef short rib, Gravy, and house-made ricotta. \u00a0I was in heaven. \u00a0The portion seemed just about right [I was also pretty hungry from the drive and really needed to eat a good meal before the race the next morning].As far as the restaurant itself... I love the fact that it is in the heart of downtown. \u00a0We walked from our hotel so it was nice being part of the city and not crammed into a car (for once). \u00a0Clean dark-wood tables, the finished exposed brick wall with local art hanging on it made for some nice ambiance. \u00a0It is a small space tucked into an old building, but I think it adds to the charm of the restaurant with booths lining one wall and a bar on the other. \u00a0Limited outdoor seating (only two tables) but that's really just minor detail....I would definitely come back if I find myself in downtown Raleigh!"], ["Trupti T.", "One of the best dinners I have had in the Raleigh area. \u00a0The ambiance, food, service, and drinks were excellent. \u00a0It is just not some pasta and sauce place, like other Italian restaurants are.

Crispy, fried balls of creamy, cheesy risotto - get into my mouth. A normal app size comes with 4, but I had no issue devouring these all on my own. My beau cried sad, lettucey tears into his Casear Salad while I delved into Fontina-flecked bliss (his salad was good, but who gets salad when you can have Arancini? Fool.) We also visited Gravy this past Mother's Day, and they delivered once again. If they ever have this special again - order the Balsamic Rib appetizer. We were expecting a couple of small short ribs, that we could easily split among our group of 4. FALSE. The ribs from the Flintstone's intro showed up at our table and they were divine. The balsamic was perfectly matched with the well-seasoned meat and all were satisfied.Other delights we enjoyed:LasagnaTagliatelle BologneseSausage and ShellsLamb RaguThe desserts at Gravy are also not to be missed. I'm not always wild about Tiramisu, but Gravy's version came in just the right portion size, was creamy, not too overwhelmed by espresso flavor, and I finished every bite.

My boyfriend and I both got cocktails, an appetizer, main courses, and a dessert and only had a $66.00 bill. Our waitress, Nikki, was super friendly and knew the menu well--which helped since we had no idea what to order. The risotto balls were to die for--a must-try.

I had no dined down here before. It was intimate and quite and offers a very different experience than the hustle/bustle upstairs. Initially there was a slight musty smell noticeable and the room was a little cooler than upstairs, which was fine by me.The waitstaff were very amicable as they had been before.But the food was right on the mark this time My wife and I both had the Rice Balls in a marinara sauce, followed by Eggplant Pie and Lasagna.Thin slicing the Eggplant makes all the difference in the texture and flavor of eggplant. so many times it is sliced thick and not cooked properly which leaves it with a tough consistency. This Eggplant was flavorful and delicate, an excellent dish. My Lasagna with meat filling was as good as any I've made (i judge all lasagna against mine). The Rice balls were very good, however I'd like to see more mozzarella cheese inside. But they were crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The dessert, chocolate torte and panna cotta were opposites in flavor intensity. The torte deep and rich while the panna cotta was light and delicate, both excellent.My wife and had a great night with our first dining experience with our Yelp friends.

I wanted to kiss you and feel you on my palate and get the chills, as I tasted your goodness. \u00a0Alas, the chemistry was not there and it couldn't be forced......Let me start by saying what I *did* enjoy. \u00a0The oyster appetizer was tasty. \u00a0I enjoyed the fennel and the giant-sized capers and the breading and the pimento aioli. \u00a0Spot-on. \u00a0I enjoyed the ambiance. \u00a0And I enjoyed that they were open for dinner on a Sunday night, while so many other restaurants are not. \u00a0What I did *not* enjoy was the service. \u00a0I asked a question about the meatballs and the server responded with a curt \"I'm a vegetarian.\" \u00a0My friend and I couldn't help but chuckle. \u00a0We are by all means, tried and true carnivores, but we always seem to get vegetarian servers at restaurants that not only SERVE, but are respected for MEAT (i.e. we had this happen once at a steak house).Aside: \u00a0I respect and appreciate the choice to be vegetarian/vegan, whatever......but what I do *not * appreciate is that when you work in an industry/restaurant that serves meat (and GOOD meat), and cannot offer me suggestions or answers about the menu, about what OTHER people enjoy, about what the selling points are........ \u00a0Or when you can not describe the food to make it sound like ANYTHING less than satiating, delicious, and satisfying. \u00a0 In my book, you are not doing your job.This would not be dissimilar from me getting on a plane and telling a passenger \"I don't enjoy flying.\"At any rate, this was not the only issue here. \u00a0There were three of us. \u00a0Two women and one guy. \u00a0She devoted all of her attention to my guy friend. \u00a0All of it. \u00a0I was about to order another blackberry sangria (which was just fair, at best- there wasn't much fruit floating around in there, and that is my favorite part of sangria)......or I was going to ask her to suggest another cocktail. \u00a0But she walked away before I could do so. \u00a0She did, however, honor my friend's request for bread when he asked her. \u00a0I've worked in the service industry before. \u00a0I was taught to never \"drop off food\" and then walk away without asking a table if they needed anything else. \u00a0I needed something else. \u00a0My friends ordered wine. \u00a0They couldn't decide on a bottle. \u00a0Our server did nothing to help with the suggestion. \u00a0Whatsoever. \u00a0Seeing a theme here? \u00a0The entrees were solid, for the most part, which is the only reason this review gets three stars, as opposed to two. \u00a0My friend had the spaghetti and meatballs. \u00a0They had a special (which we wouldn't have even known about, had we not asked). \u00a0It was a meatball made of lamb/mint/yogurt. \u00a0It was DELICIOUS. \u00a0The best thing that I tasted tonight. \u00a0 And we barely even knew that it was an option. I had the \"Family Gravy\". \u00a0Meh. \u00a0It was decent. \u00a0I wasn't crazy about the sausage in its casing. \u00a0But it wasn't bad. \u00a0The \"gravy\" was decent. \u00a0The meatball was good. \u00a0(It was *not* the special meatball. \u00a0I wish I would have had the choice to have tried that on my pasta instead of the traditional meatball!)My other friend ordered the carbonara dish. She said \"not bad, but could have used more sauce, flavor, etc.\". \u00a0I tasted it and it was alright. \u00a0And I agreed with her about \"needing more\".The server rattled off the dessert choices. \u00a0Again. \u00a0Guy orders dessert. \u00a0I was going to ask a question about one of the other desserts, but she was gone. \u00a0Like the wind. \u00a0Opportunity lost.I'm uncertain I would return. \u00a0Which is too bad, because I think the food and ambiance have some talking points. \u00a0Maybe we just needed a different server."], ["Sara F.", "Tried Gravy for the first time tonight and it was awesome! \u00a0We started with the risotto balls and garlic knots and the gravy was incredible. \u00a0My husband had the cannelloni and wiped his plate clean!

I got the chilequile and it was good, but I've had better. I thought the portion was small for the price. It wasn't how I've normally had chilequile with chips piled up and lots of toppings, but it was 2 small tortillas with very little sauce making it dry. It was also in desperate need of salt, but from the looks of it, this is one of those restaurants that put salt on the table. If you're going to do that, you better make sure your food is properly seasoned."], ["Eve B.", "I got a couple of recommendations for this place, but I do not imagine that I'll be going back.For starters (literally), the fritto misto game out as a big fried glob. It was greasy and there four small shrimp and about four small pieces of calamari. It's certainly not worth 12 bucks. (The waiter was kind enough to take it off of our ticket.) \u00a0When we told the waiter about it, she suggested that it must have been the new batter and comes out that way. I didn't expect to have to pull the glob apart to get just for most of the crust to fall off. I've had tempura before, the fritto misto is much like it, and I've never had it served to me stuck together. The risotta balls were okay and perhaps the best thing that I'd eaten but still not as good as I expected. The garlic knots appear fluffy and moist, so I was surprised when mine were dry. To me, all of the food lacked flavor. The two things I liked the most were the wine (Stefano Massone \"Masera\" Gavi) and gravy itself (I had some on the side to dip my garlic knot). \u00a0Well, three, the noodles in my pasta were so fresh. He loves beer and tried that D9 Carolina. For him, it wasn't a hit but that's not something the restaurant can control. I thought the hostess were kind, so was the server, once we sat down our service was slow. I shared with the waiter that I was not very satisfied with any of the food I had and her response was \"Oh, I'm sorry you don't like it; I suggested things that people normally get and I haven't had everything, but I love the eggplant pie and suggested that to you too.\" I had the Tagliatelle Ala Bolognse \u00a0and he had the Family Gravy.

The starter garlic knots were really good. However, it would have been nice to have some olive oil or even some marinara sauce to dip them in. I decided to order the chicken cannelloni. It was really good. I really liked the pesto sauce. My wife had the gnocchi except that she substituted their gravy for the leek cream sauce. She didn't really like it that much, but I thought it was really good. The gnocchi were more on the rustic side I would say and keep of large. But I thought it had great flavor and I believe it would have been better in the original cream sauce as on the menu. The restaurant seemed fairly busy when we dined at 7:45pm on a Saturday night.

Caprese salad - fresh cheese slices paired with basil and tomatoes. A classic.4.

I'd say this restaurant would be a dependable place for a tasty, albeit not awe-inspiring, meal. But the service is truly absolutely outstanding! Polite, extremely attentive in the most unobtrusive way possible. Staff know the menu and gave wonderful wine pairing suggestions.

If you want to eat outside, they also have a small patio with umbrellas.We ordered the Prosciutto San Danielle as our appetizer, which is prosciutto topped with some of their homemade cheese, grilled strawberries, and a drizzle of balsamic. It does sound like an odd combination to have meat, strawberries, and cheese all together in one bite, but the flavors complemented each other very well and it was a delicious dish. I've been here several times, and my favorite items on the menu are their pizzas. Don't get me wrong, the pasta and other dishes are great too, but the pizzas are big enough for 2 meals for me and they are a good deal. This time I ordered the Carne pizza, which had so much flavor. There were some hot peppers on it, so for those who can't handle heat, I suggest ordering one of the other pizzas. It is a thin crust, and I like that they don't put on too much sauce, because I get to taste more of the cheese.Vivace is a great option if you are looking for a place for a date night or a place to celebrate.

The caprese salad gets an update with seasoned tomatoes, the brussels are loaded with prosciutto and a savory balsamic kick, and the the cheese plate will leave you dreaming about truffles. And that's just the shared plate menu! It's a perfect spot for apres works cocktails and apps with friends or coworkers, but because the scene is as satisfying as the menu, make sure to get there early or opt for a reservation if you want a guaranteed table."], ["Lauryn C.", "Vivace by far has one of the best atmospheres when it comes to the dining scene in Raleigh. I've been here several times and have always enjoyed my meal. I really like their pizzas and salads. I'm not a big pasta eater and enjoy that they have a lot of variety on the menu.Eating out on their patio is fantastic, now that the weather is warm this is the first place I think about when dining al fresco. The service is always superb and I feel well taken care of. I stopped in for lunch on the patio today and our server made sure we had everything we needed. I couldn't believe how fast our food came out this is a go to place for a quick lunch.I ordered the house salad with salmon. A very generous portion of fresh greens, tomatoes, red onions, ricotta salata and a light lemon dressing. The salmon was cooked perfectly and for $12 I think this was quite a deal.The bread they serve with hummus which is such a nice change from the usual butter. I recently tried their mushroom flatbread as well and it was really tasty. Vivace puts out some quality food in a great environment. Get outside and enjoy this nice weather on the patio before it gets to hot."], ["Rae W.", "I dined here with a friend for lunch and we both ordered the house salad with salmon. The salad was so delicious I scarfed it down without breathing. I can't believe how good it was. I am still thinking about that salad now. The salmon was seasoned well and the lemon vinaigrette didn't drown out the other ingredients on the salad.I know they have other things on their menu and I will try them at some point after I grow tired of the salad...:-)"], ["Rene D.", "Wow what a find!! Had some nice special spaghetti ( made was with pork Joel meat) yummy And the noodles were perfectly aldente ! Oh yea we ordered the roasted Brussels sprouts for appetizer. They are one of the best. We have had them somewhere else and they were equally as good! \u00a0Great food and bookmarked this place when we come back someday."], ["Lindsay H.", "I've been here a number of times because it always seems to be what I'm in the mood for - because it is absolutely delicious.The only reason it does not get 5 stars is because the service is inconsistent. Sometimes it's wonderful, and sometimes it's awful (especially if you sit outside). For appetizers, the mussels are amazing, and the Brussels sprouts, meatballs, caprese salad are all good as well. In the summer they had a chilled corn soup which was a favorite of mine.My go-to for dinner is the four cheese ravioli, and the risotto is great as well. They change their menu seasonally but it's always good - I've tried several different risotto variations, all of which were tasty and unique. Once my boyfriend got a 32 oz bone-in ribeye when we celebrating, and it was one of the best steaks either of us have ever had.Vivace is a great date spot or for dinner with a group of girls. A moderate twist on traditional Italian and the food is consistently tasty."], ["Alexa R.", "Have been to Vivace a few times now, it's always been pretty good but never great. Went tonight with my family and had an average experience. Their bread was really good, but the Italian hummus spread could have been better. We started with bruschetta which I must say was really good, but it was not bruschetta. It did not have the typical fresh ingredients, it was more like a pizza. For the main course I had the black linguine which came out pretty cold and a little too al dente. No one in my family raved about their meal, we all thought it was ok.I must add, something that put a big damper on the evening was how hot the restaurant was, we were dying. I will also add that there \u00a0are not too many affordable wines on the wine list. The menu also was a bit confusing due to all of the Italian writing. It should be more clear what each dish is and what comes with each meal.Pros are the atmosphere and we had good service. I would probably give 3.5 stars if I could but since I can't that's why I'm sticking to a 3. If it was a cheaper restaurant the quality of the food would be acceptable, but for the price, you expect more."], ["Elizabeth K.", "Oh, Vivace, what happened?I recently came back here for my friend's birthday dinner & 9 out of 12 of us did not enjoy our food. I tried the birthday girl's food (which she didn't even eat half of), and it was not good at all. It either lacked seasoning or I finally tried food that tasted bad in a restaurant. Unfortunately, I raved about this place.. Really confused, especially after I hyped it up saying how delicious and awesome Vivace was, I asked our server if the chef has changed. And indeed there has been a new chef within the year. Unfortunately I have to say that Vivace is no longer a favorite of mine..."], ["Leslie E.", "Great casual atmosphere with an upscale feel. The menu had a lot of varied food items and unique ingredients. Bring an Italian translator for some of the menu items, it's that authentic. We went on a Sunday evening and it was not crowded at all. It is not a noisy restaurant and it was easy to have a conversation. The waitstaff was professional and attentive and the open styled exhibition kitchen made it interesting to watch the chefs create your meals. I would definitely go to this restaurant again and I am looking forward to their new restaurant opening in Durham."], ["Lori R.", "A public service announcement: \u00a0Get thee to Vivace for Triangle Restaurant week! \u00a0Sis & I went Monday night, tried all six items on the special menu, and all were excellent!(see pics).We started with Pancetta and Caccio Ricotta Bruschetta. \u00a0Oh my! \u00a0Neither of us have had (nor still have) any idea of what caccio ricotta is, but there was wonderful creamy white stuff (sweeter and smoother than regular ricotta) on bread with pancetta and maybe a touch of honey? \u00a0Yum! \u00a0We also got the Caesar Salad which was a wonderful traditional caesar, but the cheese in it was two-ways...straight up good quality parmesan, with another cooked version that really added to it. \u00a0Off to a great start! \u00a0Meanwhile, we were sharing a nice light bottle of chardonnay.Onward to the \"Primi\" course: \u00a0We got one each of these two \"pastas\". \u00a0One was a SMOKED TOMATO AGNOLOTTI, lump crab, sweet pea and mint puree. \u00a0Just remembering this makes me weak in the knees. \u00a0Yes, that good. \u00a0Very rich. \u00a0Sumptuous. \u00a0sigh. \u00a0With it we also shared: \u00a0FENNEL GNOCCHI, swordfish confit, basil, meyer lemon cr\u00e8me fraiche. \u00a0I'm not a huge gnocchi fan, but this was beautifully done. \u00a0Light yet rich...very flavorful!We could have stopped here, but we still had the savory \"Secondi\" course. \u00a0Again we shared one of each: \u00a0GRILLED PORK CHOP, aglianico braised kale, blistered tomato and SALMON, semolina gnocchi, citrus brown butter vinaigrette, grilled asparagus. \u00a0Both dishes were cooked to perfection. \u00a0The pork chop was in a rich red wine sauce. \u00a0Salmon was light. \u00a0We each took some home, because we couldn't finish it all.Needless to say there was no room for dessert. \u00a0Three courses were just $30 for Triangle Restaurant Week...an amazing deal for the quality! \u00a0Especially loved that they were all savory. \u00a0I would much rather have an appetizer than a dessert. \u00a0Service was excellent, by the way. \u00a0We sat on the patio and it was a beautiful, memorable evening.Highly recommend this place for restaurant week, or everyday!"], ["Don N.", "Food and service was fantastic. Had the breakfast flatbread, it changed my breakfast life. Will definitely be back!"], ["Melissa W.", "I've never been disappointed in this place. I love that they have outdoor seating for warm Spring days such as this one. I also love that gnocchi is a staple on their dinner menu. Finally, I also love the excellent service I receive at each visit. Today I had the four cheese ravioli, which although filled me up, wasn't too much food. Their hummus and bread starter is yummy too!"], ["Rose L.", "I read an article that Vicace is moving to Durham and is taking over Pop's old location and knew I had to stop what I was doing and review the restaurant so that everyone will be as excited as I am that they're moving to Durham! I've been to the North Hills location twice and both times had a fantastic dining experience. Excellent food, fantastic cocktails and the service was superb. Vivace is not only great for a date night, but also is high on the list for a ladies night (cocktails on the patio or in the bar \"lounge\" area). They also have seating directly in front of the kitchen, so you can watch the chefs cook--I have a secret agenda of finding all the Triangle's open kitchens like this!Vivace is authentic Italian food, fresh pasta, wood fired pizzas and classy cocktails. They have a very well rounded menu but also have a three course meal that changes weekly with fresh and creative specials. I recommend either ordering a bottle of red wine for the table or trying a cocktail (they're creative and delicious). The first time I visited Vivace, we ordered a pizza which was cooked perfectly. The second time I couldn't say no to a special they were currently having with fresh, handmade ravioli stuffed with lamb. That is what truly made the experience top notch as it was by far the best ravioli I've had out. And to prove to you that I truly couldn't get enough I will also tell you that I shortly thereafter received a pasta maker (because of this experience) and have been practicing ever since! I can't recommend Vivace enough and am so very excited for their new Durham location, I will be waiting patiently for opening night!"], ["Arlene T.", "Yum, yum, yum! A day later and my mouth still salivates thinking of the delicious meal I had at Vivace! My girlfriend and I were overwhelmed with all the delicious food options that we decided to split two dishes--the pasta bolognese and the veal saltimbocca--both were amazing! Full of flavor and good size portions. This is my favorite Italian place in Raleigh yet! For desert we had the zepolli (deep fried donuts) which were also very tasty. We ordered a carafe of sangria for the table--good taste and not very strong (alcohol). The wonderful service complemented our delicious meal--very attentive and friendly server. Only noticeable room for improvement is the bread--it was plain, flavorless and not very exciting. Ambiance is perfect for date night or night out with girlfriends. Was very busy (Thursday night) so I would recommend making a reservation. I'll definitely visit Vivace soon!"], ["Amanda S.", "Elegant -- Welcoming -- Tasteful Weeks prior, knowing schedule would be tight, I phoned Vivace and booked a Valentine's Day evening dinner. Availability was already tight so I reserved 4PM but the hostess quickly assured me they had a list that if any cancellations came, they would alert me and offer me a time better suited in the window I requested. When we arrived, we were quickly seated at a table already ready for 2 people. Valentine's Day they had a specialty menu at $55 each. Prior to arriving, on the phone I communicated that I am gluten free and my girlfriend is a vegetarian. When the server introduced himself, he mentioned that and would be happy to walk step by step through each course outlining what I could eat and what was meat-less options. And he did! Our server went above and beyond what any ordinary or typical server does. He walked through, educated and brilliantly described each course and each meal, how the chef's were preparing the meal to ensure no cross-contamination. Each and every course was divine and a perfectly executed. I started with a soup that was pureed chickpeas and cauliflower (minus the tortellinis that were cooked separately) and was probably the most delicious soup I've ever tried. It was topped with bits of bacon and rosemary. Each and every meal was honestly perfect in size and portion as well without a long wait between. Just enough to continue to enjoy conversation and some wine. The last course was the cod fish and broccolini and they sweetly shaped the pieces of cod together to form a heart. All servers were quick to refill any beverages. It's not a large restaurant, really only encompassing one main room but they were able to put a large amount of tables ready for patrons. The server even went as much as realizing my girlfriend only ate plates that were modified and included no meat so he decreased the price of the set meal from $55 to $40. The server realized all dessert options weren't gluten free and offered decadent lemon sherbert. Sweetest part is it started snowing the second we walked outside -- perfectly large snowflakes hitting our noses with the moonlight to help shadow each one! To this day, my girlfriend and I still feel that the meal and service we experienced at Vivace was the best we've ever had, and it doesn't come easy saying that. Nestled in the corner of North Hills, it's easy to pass it as it's squeezed in with other independent vendor stores, but do yourself a favor. If you'd like a nice Italian meal that is presently superbly with an innovative and classy style, then Vivace is your place!"], ["Dan L.", "Excellent food just excellent. \u00a0I've tried several things on the menu and have always been delighted. \u00a0 The restaurant has great ambiance and is also very livery and fun. \u00a0A must see in the north hills area."], ["Jacqueline J.", "I've been here several times with various companions (girls night, date night with my hubby, group of 4 friends) and the chef has always prepared delicious food. \u00a0I do agree with previous posts that the portions are small, which makes the price a bit too expensive for the amount of food you get.The wine list has some great selections for all types of palettes. The atmosphere is modern/contemporary, with beautiful and comfty outdoor seating. Definitely try their brussel sprouts and spaghetti!"], ["K H.", "Stopped in the bar for a quick drink (iced tea). While there i saw food that others were ordering and all looked good. Could not resist a bruschetta while there. Emily was my server. Did a great job! Timely with everything. Very knowledge and helpful.Bruschetta was great! Different than I have ever had before and very savory. I think it's a safe bet that this is not ricotta that you and I can buy at the local grocer.Il will certainly be back."], ["Grant C.", "First time was great really I joyed the pasta that I had. The restaurant was really nice and neat. The experience overall was good. And look forward to trying there outdoor seating"], ["Unhappy R.", "I would have rather gone to golden corral. \u00a0The spaghetti tasted like golden corrals. \u00a0Plain and simple. \u00a0Over cooked by chefs om cell phones. \u00a0The veal was also over cooked and tasteless. \u00a0Mushy pasta along with it. \u00a0Ten dollars a glass for wine thats ten dollars a bottle other places. \u00a0Come on Raleigh dont you have better to offer than this!!!!"], ["Emilie U.", "We had a great dinner the other night with friends who were visiting from out of town. The perfect place to spend a few hours drink a bottle or two, laugh and enjoy unique and delicious food! Can't wait to go back again soon! :-)"], ["Kelly M.", "Really enjoyed our early Sunday night dinner out on the patio. We skipped drinks, although they had some cocktails that looked really good. There were four of us dining and although they were crowded on the patio, the service was just fine. They brought bread and some type of garlic spread to the table, which was great to snack on. We went for the risotto on the margherita pizza and the risotto was the winner by FAR. The pizza wasn't bad, it just wasn't anything to write home about. Very little basil, bland mozzarella and way too much sauce for my taste. However, my future mother in law got the Bianco pizza which came with roasted spring veggies and aged balsamic - awesome!We'll definitely be back - probably for drinks and appetizers on the patio!"], ["Andrea T.", "I must first acknowledge to you dear reader that I am not a fan of italian, it must be very well done Italian for me to even enter. They brought out bread we were not crazy about so they substituted with crostini, don't hesitate to ask for the same. Then we had the brussel sprouts which were accompanied in a lemon cream sauce that really perked them up. Definitely would get the sprouts again. We also had the arancini, which were really good except the sauce they were served with was cold. Not sure if this was intentional, but they were flavorful enough to be eaten sans sauce. The sommelier was very patient, I don't know a lot about Italian wine, so it took us a bottle to get to one we liked. We went with a lovely Barbera. Then we shared a small plate of the carbonara. I love carbonara. This was good, but not outstanding. The desserts can definitely be passed up. I would come back, but for only small plates and drinks at the bar most likely."], ["Rebecca T.", "I am very picky when it comes to Italian cuisine and I was very impressed with my experience. The wait staff were all very polite and extremely knowledgeable. We had the Brussel sprouts, prosciutto San Danielle, and mussels to start. All fantastic. We followed with the arugula, kale, and beet salads. Again all phenomenal. We finished with the lamb shank, veal, and Bronzino. The veal being my favorite. Absolutely exquisite execution. The wine recommended by our server was perfectly paired with each of our dishes. This is hands down my favorite Italian restaurant in the Raleigh area. HIGHLY recommended! We will be back again very soon!!"], ["Brandon S.", "The food here is phenomenal. The only reason it doesn't get five stars is because the service did not match the quality of the food. The waitress might have been new or having an off night. Either scenario is completely understandable. It's a good thing the food more than made up for it. I will be back. Although, I hope to get better service."], ["Yeshanth J.", "I was here on a Thursday night and assumed that it wouldn't be crowded. I was proved wrong when I landed there. The place was so noisy inside and outside. We took a seat inside and the decor was pleasant. We had to shout to order. Most often, the waitress got it wrong. I had ordered for a beer and I had repeatedly remind the waitress about it. We had ordered Bruschetta and Brussel Sprouts. I wouldn't recommend Bruschetta. It is not like the regular one. I think the barbaque sauce spoils the taste.However, brussel sprouts were amazing ! I have never one like this before. For small plates, four cheese ravioli was ordinary but the gnocchi stood out be the better one. Goat cheese filling and the pork sauce made it taste good. For dessert, the lavender ice cream on pear was ordinary.On the whole, an ordinary experience which had its moments to impress but fell short."], ["Jami D.", "Amazing place!! The husband and I planned a short trip to Raleigh to celebrate our anniversary and we came here for a nice dinner. The atmosphere is great and our server was so delightful! We really felt so special dining here. I had the caprice salad and lamb shank for dinner, both would be highly recommended! My husband did the chefs special three course meal with a type of salmon antipasto dish, cod stuffed pasta primi and a rack of lamb secondi (I hope those are the correct terms). It was all delicious!! We are huge lamb fans and it was fabulous. The tiramisu made for a nice ending to the dinner. This is on the pricier side of dining for the two of us, but for a special occasion it turned out to be well worth every penny!! And some complimentary homemade limoncello brought the night to a good close. So please and we look forward to dining again :)"], ["Luke R.", "Don't do it. Just don't. One word to sum this place up: bland. Started with a heaping serving of muscles that barely tasted the part. Their meatballs were mediocre at best, salad was full of lettuce that shouldn't be served in a restaurant charging what they do and the main course of pasta in a bolognese sauce that failed to impress. Then came the cherry on top... The bill."], ["Randall L.", "Fantastic late afternoon surprise. \u00a0Our wait staff was knowledgeable and went out of the way to talk to the chef about allowing us to \"personalize\" our starter without us asking because he knew we were interested in trying a couple of different items. \u00a0His recommendations were spot on and the food was incredible. \u00a0Probably the best minestrone I have ever had; I really like the way chef uses local \u00a0ingredients to regionalize his recipes \u00a0The black garlic linquini with clams is excellent and the meat and cheese plate options are worth going back for. \u00a0The pear and ricotta tart is outstanding but next time I would definitely order coffee with it. \u00a0We will definitely return."], ["Kaushik G.", "We went to Vivace for dinner. The staff was very friendly, and the ambience a big plus. We liked the slowly revolving light fixtures.Our waiter, Martez was helpful in finding out if the dishes had certain ingredients. The food itself was good, though the portion size could have been more. Overall, our experience at this restaurant was a pleasant one."], ["Melissa C.", "Service was efficient and fast.

It was a beautiful afternoon and sitting at the bar with the windows open was the way to go. We had a perfect view, had a couple nice cocktails and an easy lunch there. Both the wife and I got salads this time around.Bar tended was easy to talk to and we caught a little bit of the NCAA basketball that was going on as well -- they are not a sports watching venue though (they have a smallish TV) and the sound they can't play through there system which seems odd.The food is solid, the people are pleasant and you can't go wrong with the location right in North Hills.

(I tend to use Yelp for that, quite honestly). I like change so I wanted to check out a place I hadn't been to before since I had already tried most of the other restaurants in the area - at least as far as the North Hills shopping centers are concerned. Vivace seemed like a good choice, and I really enjoyed their streamlined Italian menu from checking out their website.It was super busy when we went - which was to be expected since it was around 7pm on a Friday night. That was no big deal. I would rather it be busy than completely dead - then I know the food probably isn't worth it. After a couple of minutes of waiting at the bar, we were able to grab a seat there and decided to just order our food from the bar instead of waiting for a table (I actually kind of prefer sitting at the bar - closer to the alcohol, duh). I got the Parmesan Gnocchi which was PHENOMENAL. Seriously, it was so good that it was all I craved for the rest of the weekend. I had never tried gnocchi before, but with a friends recommendation I took the chance. The atmosphere was great as well. The bartender was so sweet and eager to throw in his two cents on what we should try as far as drinks go. I would definitely come back again and I am not someone who likes to hit up the same restaurant twice - unless there is something really, really special about it. Clearly that is the case with Vivace. I will also recommend it to any coworkers or friends who are dining in the North Raleigh area."], ["Peter H.", "Really neat atmosphere. Today the weather was warm and they had the doors and sliding windows open at the bar and tons of people sitting outside. The food was excellent drink selection was fast and our server was very attentive. Appetizers were around $11 each and entr\u00e9es were $25-$30. I had veal scallopini which was excellent. I'll be back."], ["Chantoozie C.", "We were invited to dinner at vivace by a friend in the biz who lives locally. She Had been to vivace numerous times and raved about it, so being in the biz ourselves, we were excited to try it out. It is a stylish atmosphere with open kitchen, our server Kevin was sweet, but blatantly inexperienced. We were informed that he was a bar back and doing great as a server ! We had to ask a few times for more sparkling water (when we asked the server of the next table, a tall guy, he was obviously not happy with the request) also asked another server nearby and then our server and eventually, some 20 minutes later we got more sparkling water! the wine I initially ordered was not available and I was advised that for $50 more I could have a different vintage! Then after I tasted the wine the other two glasses at the table were poured and the server left mine empty! Food was warm when served and I could not eat my ravioli as it was way too spicy, To the point where it overpowered the whole dish. Quail was overcooked, fig pizza was good, carpaccio was good, needed a little salt, risotto had no seasoning and was oily. It just seemed one thing after another was not right and our friend was embarrassed for bringing us here. A female (manager??) came to the table and offered us free dessert which we declined, after our server Kevin had already offered us dessert. We weren't looking for anything free or comped, just good food and good service, which seemed to be \"on vacation' with the Labor Day weekend!"], ["Yvonne C.", "Came on a busy Friday night for the first time, and be warned, if you want to make a reservation make it well in advance. Upon arrival the restaurant was packed and bustling with activity! The interior is a bit small and won't fit very many parties (reservations) but also has a nice outdoor seating. Of course it was raining last night, but I imagine on a nice Sunday morning it would be beautiful. My party of 4 had to snag seats at the bar, which we did not mind. The bartender (didn't get his name) was great! Attentive and very willing to help, what more could you ask for? I enjoyed the agrodolce cocktail while my friends had their wines and beers. No complaints from any of us.We started the night with a delicious bowl of steamed mussels and some beef carpaccio. The mussels were excellent, tasty and not too dry with some very delicious wine sauce. Pro tip: dip your bread in that sauce and you will NOT regret it! The beef carpaccio was also delicious. I had never had this before, and the raw meat was a surprise but just yummy. My only complaint? It went away too fast.For the entree I ordered the risotto funghi, being a mushroom lover. The dish was definitely very good but not amazing. Somehow I forgot I'm not a risotto lover so I won't be ordering that again. \u00a0I found the appetizer portion to be filling and a good size. Another dish I sampled was the braised pork shoulder which I just loved. Meat was tender, great flavor and savory."], ["Donna S.", "Visited VIVACE during restaurant week.

Hopes were high in our crew for this restaurant, but our meal turned out disappointing. The basic summary is that it took a while for us to be seated, food service was slow, and the brunch menu wasn't very good. Everyone here was nice, however.Salads came out first and were tasty. Most in our party went with pizzas for our main course and found them wanting. Perhaps best of the lot was my niece's margherita: \u00a0not usually good sign when the toppings are taking away from your product. Worst on the table was the sausage and egg pizza, ordered by yours truly. I actually left feeling a little ill.We had crossed the threshold from brunch to lunch hours by the time we had arrived.

The Calamari Fritti was among the best I've ever had - crispy and tender, no easy feat apparently. The Proscuitto Di Parma was excellent, though like cow bell, I needed more melon. My Alice had the Veal Saltimboca, which, while very good, is also very rich, and this version had more mushrooms than Fresh Market. I had, simply, the Spaghetti with meatballs, and it was also excellent, with a superb tomato sauce.I would go back, but only with a group who's conversation I was content with missing a fair portion of , beside a table I heard way too much of.

We ordered a large size pizza and we wanted to split it half and half of two of their gourmet pizzas but we were told they couldn't do that (gourmet pizzas have to be ordered whole) So that was disappointing. So we ordered one whole large gourmet pizza--the mona lisa. I'm a huge lover of margherita style pizza and that's what i was expecting. But if I had to sum up this pizza in one word, it'd be TOMATOES. I'm used to tomatoes being diced up atop the pizza, but this was sliced tomatoes covering the pizza. And so the the tomato slice to mozzarella chunk ratio is like 5:1. I was disappointed. My friend got a cheese and pepperoni pizza and that was delicious. So I think it was just our choice. So i'm just throwing this out there: don't get the tomato pizza! (aka mona lisa)Service was great though, which is another reason why i'm giving this place high marks.

We sat down and had to ask for bread and the service was horribly slow, we had empty water glasses and very limited interaction with our server, who barely came around.I think Bella Monica has good food and that is what keeps people going back, the service is declined and it doesn't appear as if anyone is concerned about that. \u00a0If you want to go I would recommend going for lunch, dinner time seems to be a disaster, I don't think they can handle being that busy, whether it is the wait staff , the kitchen staff or a combination of both, they can't handle being busy ."], ["Carol B.", "I saw e yelp reviews and wanted a nice lunch.

For those who are reading these reviews and considering Bella Monica for your next dining experience, do not allow yourselves to be disillusioned and mislead. - We couldn't actually locate the place. As far as I could tell, there wasn't a visible sign for Bella Monica; we drove right past it and only happened to see the name on the door. (We should've kept driving.)- \u00a0Undeveloped flavors left us wanting more. - Salads completely masked by dressing. Chicken parm was drowned in sauce... And the sauce wasn't even that good. The eggplant we ordered was strange and undercooked; completely mangled. The manager claimed that they simply \"do it differently\" there: meaning, in a completely un-Italian style. All in all, the food was unsatisfactory. - We ended up sending said eggplant back. Our waitress handled it extremely well (she was a sweetheart, honestly, and this review in no way reflects on her service.) but the manager acted strangely. He fought with my grandmother on whether or not the eggplant was \"cooked\"; rather than acknowledging that the eggplant was undercooked, he gave the excuse I stated in my previous statement.Anyway, all in all, I would NOT recommend Bella Monica. 2/5 stars for food, 4/5 service, and 2/5 for management."], ["Emily G.", "Though this restaurant is a little pricy for my taste, it is entirely worth it.

I had the veal parm and the pasta and marinara sauce on top was amazing. I devoured this meal. We started with the stuffed clams which were a little spicy.

It had really good flavors and the garlic was just right on it. I want to go back and try some of other other veal plates like the veal tortellini.The location can get a little loud inside though since it's small.

Sold! \u00a0(price unknown, care to guess?) \u00a0 Both entrees were very very good. \u00a0We would give them each 4-stars. \u00a0Husband thought his veal parmesan was excellent, but the pasta part just okay (he's used to mine, sorry Cafe Tiramisu...but I don't cook veal, so he could really appreciate that). \u00a0My meal was very good also...three giant shrimp, two of which were good, and one was outstanding, loved the homemade pasta cooked to perfect al dente, and the white clam sauce was perfect. \u00a0Clams were not in their shells, but that was a plus as they didn't get in the way, and were so TENDER (rare for clams) \u00a0and fresh-tasting. \u00a0It was the perfect amount of food. \u00a0Not too crazy big, yet filling. \u00a0We tried hard to be brave and not lick plates. \u00a0Dessert: Hearing the folks behind me talk about a dessert drink, I had to order one. \u00a0It was an espresso one, with vanilla liquor and all kinds of creamy rich delicious goodness. \u00a0Husband had the tiramisu which might just be his all time fave, and he's a tiramisu expert. \u00a0I tasted it and have to agree, it was excellent. \u00a0Atmosphere is very happy. \u00a0People are laughing, and having a good time. \u00a0You see great looking food on other tables, and the smells are amazing. \u00a0Small, \u00a0Intimate and very recommended. \u00a0Just make reservations or you won't get in, cause it is SMALL. \u00a0 So, did you guess how much? \u00a0(neither did I) \u00a0Drumroll, please.... \u00a0My special-I-don't-care-how-much-entree turned out to be $22.95. \u00a0Value for experience...INvaluable...and just what I needed after an especially tough week at work."], ["Monica M.", "Delish!!!!

The alfredo lightly coats the fettuccine. Lasagna takes about 45 mins but is worth the wait. It's light and balanced with all the classic deliciousness of lasagna. It's not just a cheesy, heavy mess like you typically get. The fried oysters are great as well as the veggie ravioli for an appetizer. Desserts are equally impressive and I'm a cake snob.

I will be going back here often as the price is very good for what you get and it appears all be made from scratch and fresh.

There are maybe 15 tables in the whole place and the people in there were super sweet and nice. They probably need to teach the younger guy some sweet to his salty.

It was actually quite disappointing for a $4 bowl of salad. \u00a0It was some not-so-fresh lettuce bits with two slices of onion, two grape tomatoes, and one cucumber slice. \u00a0The most sorry looking salad I have ever seen. \u00a0The dressing is made in-house and was actually quite good, but super mayo-tasting. \u00a0Everything else: \u00a0The free bread was quite good and they gave us a large amount. \u00a0Our dinner entrees were also huge portions. \u00a0We ate probably about half of each. \u00a0The sauce in the braciole was actually a little bland (low salt) and very garlic-y. \u00a0It was actually refreshing to me to taste a sauce that wasn't overly salted so I enjoyed the taste. \u00a0The braciole was a little bland as well, but dipped in the sauce, everything tasted fine. \u00a0I choose for my beef braciole to come with pasta instead of a side salad, and it was just as I imagined. \u00a0The tortellini was delicious! \u00a0I loved the cheese sauce! \u00a0I'm usually not a fan of cheese sauces as they tend to be overwhelming, but this was perfect. \u00a0It was lighter than I expected and the tortellinis were perfect little doughy pieces of deliciousness. \u00a0All-in-all, Casa Carbone is an excellent option for Italian. \u00a0Excellent service, great food, and a cozy environment make for a solid dinner option."], ["Aaron B.", "This recent visit saw me bring a guest who had never been here before.The service and the food were an exact replica of my first visit here. \u00a0My guest was extremely impressed and expressed a desire to return soonish! \u00a0She was surprised when I mentioned how long Lora had been working here and got a chance to talk to Lora herself as to why the longevity and received some background information on the history of Casa Carbone.On the way out a server I had not seen previously stopped me. \u00a0He told me that he had just served a table of patrons who specifically mentioned my review as the motivation for checking out Casa Carbone. \u00a0 Now that's an awesome Yelp interaction! \u00a0I wish I had a chance to find out who they were but they apparently had already left while my guest and I chatted post-meal.I love this place."], ["Leslie F.", "My husband and I love Casa Carbone!! This place is like stepping back in time with a traditional Italian menu. Everything we've had has been wonderful. Try the linguine with clams - I get the white and hubby gets the red-yum!!!

I did not read the reviews beforehand but saw that it averaged four stars. I had high hopes.After my dinner there, I truly do not understand why it has four stars. I would never return.First, the decor. A couple of people have commented on how old and outdated the decor is. Yes, it is truly old and needs to be updated. The entire restaurant needs a make over. But I could live with outdated decor if the food was good.Before we get to the food, let's discuss service. I was with a group of six. We were seated promptly. However, we didn't see a server for at least five minutes. When I say we didn't see one I mean we didn't see anyone. No one was around for awhile.Our server did show up and was ok. He was able to answer questions about the food but was less helpful when it came to drink orders. He just didn't know very much about the wine and didn't offer to find someone who could be helpful. Food came out promptly and once it did he disappeared. There was someone who was coming around and refilling water, but once we got our entrees that person also disappeared. We were back to being all by ourselves.Now, the food. I had a Caesar salad and it was pretty bad. Another reviewer noted that the salads seemed pre-made. I'm going to agree with that. The salad was definitely not fresh. Lettuce was edible, and I'm gonna leave it at that. The Parmesan cheese on the salad was probably Kraft from a bottle or something similar.Next up I had the spaghetti with tomato sauce. What appealed to me about this dish was that the menu said the sauce had been simmering for hours. I checked this out with the waiter before ordering it, and he confirmed for me that this was one of THE dishes to order.I got plenty of spaghetti for my money (8.00). But in no way was there anything fresh about this meal. The pasta definitely came from a box, and the sauce came from a can. To be fair, the menu never claimed that anything was fresh just that the sauce had been simmering for hours. It was very bland.They do not put parm on the spaghetti. When I inquired about it, the waiter informed me there was a bottle of cheese on the table and that this was, \"not the Olive Garden.\" I guess the Olive Garden is a step up? Not sure what he meant by that except don't expect any freshly grated cheese in any format. I struggled with giving this one star or two because the food is technically edible. But since there is no way I would go back here I decided to give it one. I am not sure how this place manages to stay in business given the awful food and old decor."], ["Greg O.", "Finally got to try this place after reading and hearing reviews and doing my homework on the place. \u00a0I really was hoping to not be disappointed, and I wasn't. \u00a0The inside is a perfect Italian restaurant setting for me, no frills and very casual like I'm used to. \u00a0The waiter was very nice and helpful, even was able to get the chef to make my pasta, Sicilian style. \u00a0Started with the roasted red peppers and salami, was so good, just wish there was more. \u00a0The bread was perfect and I knew I'd be going to town on the bread, just normal Italian bead without all the herbs and oils and whatnot. \u00a0You just need plain italian bread to dip in their really good sauces and make pasta sandwiches. \u00a0I got the baked ziti which is one of my staples when trying a new Italian place to judge them on. \u00a0If this place was closer, I'd be there a heck of a lot more."], ["Adam F.", "First time here. \u00a0Place is very tired. \u00a0Looks like it has seen better days. \u00a0Food was not very good but I also know that Italian food is in the eye of the beholder. \u00a0I would not return."], ["Amy L.", "I lived near this hidden gem for three years and finally decided to give it a try.

It's a casual dining atmosphere, so you'll see people in everything ranging from workout gear to jeans and even dresses. You can expect warm, fresh bread and butter upon being seated. I had the fettuccine alfredo which was delicious, and a side of spinach with garlic and oil. I found the spinach a tad too garlic-y, so I didn't eat much of it.
