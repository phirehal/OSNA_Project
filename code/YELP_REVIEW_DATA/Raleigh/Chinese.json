I've been wanting to go here for a while now because I love everything noodles & dumplings, and I'm glad I did. I came here with a friend earlier and westarted off with the half-fried dumplings and the shrimp summer rolls. The dumplings were absolutely scrumptious! Perfectly crispy bottom, tender flavorful pork filling, and a refreshing little side of a tangy-sweet coleslaw. Definitely a lil banger. The summer rolls were a bit disappointing since we only got one little shrimp in one of the halves, and peanut sauce it came with was very oily. For my entree I went with a recommendation \u00a0from our server from the chef's specialties: Lionshead infilled scallop with Chinese baby broccoli. Wow! So so delicious. Tender, juicy, flavor packed pork balls with a perfectly cooked scallop in the middle + topped with a perfectly balanced sweet/salty sauce. Overall I really enjoyed my experience here. The service was wonderful and the food came out promptly. I'm excited to come back and try more!"], ["Victoria K.", "I recently discovered David's and went there twice. Once for lunch and once for dinner. It is worth mentioning that the menus vary drastically between the two meals. At lunch you can get the Chinese dishes and appetizers but none of the soups and noodle dishes that are available at dinner. That being said, the food here is spectacular. I was able to go with large groups both times and I believe we sampled nearly everything on the menu. The papaya beef salad is out of this world refreshing and full of sweet and sour flavors. The fried dumplings are so good and served with a great sauce. A surprisingly delicious appetizer was the vegetarian dumplings which I definitely recommend. My favorite is the chicken curry with Indian roti. I can't even explain how it's so good but just do yourself a favor and get one for the table. The soft shell crab salad and salt and pepper wings were also good choices. For entrees, the Malaysian curry noodle soup was the winner but the general Mao chicken, pad Thai, moo shoo pork, and pork and dumpling soup were also delicious. To top it all off, there are pictures of David hung throughout the entire restaurant giving you the feeling that he must be this famous chef who is probably off traveling the world or something. Wrong. David can be found seating guests, bringing food, clearing tables, cooking, and saying goodbye as you leave. He really cares about his establishment.

Cool to have in the neighborhood type of joint very common in various neighbors in NY. \u00a0Unfortunately service was friendly, but slow and I think our server had a lot of tables so perhaps they were short staffed. We tried several appetizers. \u00a0I just loved the half fried dumplings. \u00a0I am no dumpling expert but most of the dumplings I have had are sort of doughy, with a pinch of meat. \u00a0We usually just dip it in some sauce and gobble them up. \u00a0So American. \u00a0It's a carb, who cares, no problem have a beer. BUT these dumplings were full of meat. \u00a0Yessssssss meat! \u00a0And someone took the time to season the meat and bam..great tasting gotta go back and get me some more dumplings. \u00a0We also ordered the mushroom edamame dumplings and so...... if you are a vegetarian they are decent. \u00a0I was a vegetarian for a couple of years, but this girl loves chicken and fish so I \"could not\" do life without them. However I am a big lover of vegetarian meals from time to time so I think they hit the spot.We also tried the satay chicken and the Vietnamese cool spring rolls. \u00a0My son loves chicken satay and he said they were \"whatever\"...huh? \u00a0They were dry so you just had to do what??? \u00a0drown them in the peanut sauce gobble them up, have a beer. \u00a0The cool rolls were also dry and I was disappointed because I order these from Pei Wei all the time and even though they are a chain, those cool rolls are what's up! \u00a0 I would not order these two again.Our entrees were the Malaysian Chicken Curry, the Low Mein with Shrimp and the Pad Thai rice noodles with chicken. The showstopper was the Malaysian Chicken Curry. This dish is not your run of the mill chicken curry dish. All of the spices just pop off and slap your palate to attention. \u00a0The dish has just the right amount of kick so it is not overly spicy but just perfect and I promise you I do not care for spicy dishes. I thoroughly enjoyed my entree. \u00a0Now you know those other two people who were with me? They kept dipping their forks in my bowl. \u00a0And I am like....How many \"let me have a little taste\" does it take before you get the memo; you my friend, have ordered the wrong dang gum entr\u00e9e, but this right here? \u00a0It is MY DISH! My son said he would not run back. He liked the dumplings but he felt the overall experience was \"whatever\"..not special. \u00a0Even Jesus couldn't win them all. My husband would go back because they have a TV, and beer and noodles with shrimp.... nuff said! \u00a0 I will go back and I would recommend to a friend setting the right expectations. \u00a0I did not feel it was a five star experience, but it was not a bust at all. \u00a0I will order the dumplings no matter what else I am planning to have. \u00a0I would love to try another unique entr\u00e9e but how do you go back and NOT HAVE the Malaysian Chicken Curry?????

Dumplings were amazing, light and power packed with flavor. We love ginger sauce and it was a hit. The spring rolls were flaky thin and crispy with a touch of sweet. Great compliment with the chicken inside. For dinner we chose Beef with Orange Peel and Pork with Chinese Pickle Turnip and Ginger. We split dinners to get a taste of each. Orange beef had a slow burn heat and sweet with a orange peel finish, a rich flavor all around with fresh steamed vegetables and white rice. A combination of mild heat and sweet was delicious. The pickle turnip was very light and distant mild vinegar, very faint that combo' with the the ginger and vegetables and delicate pork strips in a light brown sauce \u00a0and white rice that was the best dish of the night.

So when I read the Fu Kee Express was offering the closest northeast style dishes in the Triangle, I had to try it. Mike, the super friendly owner/chef, is from NJ. He immediately asked me about my 603 area code and said that a high percentage of his customers have MA, NY and NH area codes. \u00a0I tried the lunch special General Tso's chicken ($6.25) which comes with fried rice. I was skeptical about the rice, it was yellow and resembled Spanish rice more than what I was use to- the fried rice with dark soy sauce- but it was full of flavor. \u00a0The General Tso's is made with chunks of white meat, not dark and was also full of rich flavor.As for whether it is true to northeast style, we'll have to try more dishes. Other reviewers mentioned that Mike is a one man show, and it appears he is. My order was ready on time, but I could see it being a challenge at times. Also, the plaza Fu Kee Express is located in (across from Belk at Triangle Town Center) is getting a facelift and it may draw more traffic."], ["Angela J.", "This place is awesome!!!

The dilemma is that so many Chinese places use SO much batter so your pieces of 'chicken' are really like 70% dough and you feel cheated. I was delighted to see that Fu Kee Express does NOT do this. The breading is so light it's perfect, you get big MEATY chunks of chicken. It is so delicious. HIGHLY recommend. I've never had better Chinese food. Note: It seems Fu Kee is a one man operation--absolute props to him for choosing to serve high quality food. He said the chicken is fresh everyday--after eating it I 100% believe it, his Chinese food doesn't even compare to others. Fu Kee is in a class of its' own."], ["Laura G.", "I had the General Tso's and it was delicious.

I spent $30 on takeout for a relaxing night in, but would have had a better meal microwaving something in the frozen food section of Harris Teeter. The food was bland and lacked any resemblance to what I ordered. I ended up with wonton soup that tasted like someone ran some ginger through bath water, potstickers that were soggy with an undetermined filling, Shrimp in \"Lobster\" sauce that lacked anything resembling a Lobster sauce, and they even over cooked the side of steamed rice!Bottom line...this place needs to step it up to compete with all the other dining options in the area.

Keep in mind they weren't very crowded and I don't know why it would take so long to throw together a garden salad with ginger dressing or a cup of hot & sour soup.When the food finally did arrive it was mediocre at best. I had the \"Generals Chicken\" and it was way overcooked and dry. All of my co-workers had pretty much the same opinion of their food, overcooked, bland, dry, etc. It was as if the meals were precooked and then just thrown in a skilled with some oil to heat it up.

It's in the warehouse district and it has kind of a 90s Seattle grunge type vibe. The 90s alt rock they were playing fit the decor perfectly. Sadly though, the 90s nostalgia was the only thing I enjoyed about this place and the only reason I'm giving this place two stars instead of one.My evening turned sour before I even got my food. The hipper than thou, very much not Chinese waitress was extremely rude to me. I was dining alone because I had a night class that night and couldn't even get dinner until 9:30 pm and most people don't eat that late. She seemed utterly baffled at the concept of someone dining alone and gave me attitude about it.The food was god awful. Even my dumplings were bad and it's pretty hard to make dumplings not delicious. They were very oily and one even sprayed a stream of grease at me when I bit into it! My entree was even worse. I got Thai peanut noodles and the noodles were mushy. The sauce was overly sweet and didn't have the nice sesame taste that I expect with this dish. I asked for some hot sauce in an attempt to make it taste better but their hot sauce was gross too. It tasted like ketchup (which is definitely the worst condiment ever).Supposedly Five Star is a nightlife spot as well as a restaurant.

It was just a bad experience.Food: Ok, so I don't understand the appeal of going to a place that serves the same type of food that I can get at a chinese take out for way less money. I'm paying $15 for sesame chicken that I can get for $7? I gave them the benefit of the doubt and expected it to be like a \"WHOA OMG this is the best chinese food, so worth it!\" moment but it wasn't. This is NOT authentic chinese food, nor is it great flavor. Super salty, too fried, little variation. Literally get a plate of just deep fried chicken. and rice. That is it. So everyone got tired of eating the chicken. At least the portions are big..Service: WOW I wish I can say this wasn't the WORST service but it was. I asked the server for a sangria (which is a pretty generic drink that most bars can make) and she just looked at me rudely and said they don't have any. She didn't try to suggest a similar type drink or anything. Just a flat out \"No, sorry.\" Like...what?! And then when throughout the duration of our meal she always seemed like she was bothered. I've never had such rude service. EVER. And oh yeah. To top it all off, she completely screwed up our bills. She actually forgot to show up and give half of our party their bill in the first place until we had to find her and ask why they didn't get one. And then it's all wrong anyways.. So I think we actually stayed a whole extra half hour waiting for the bills to be sorted out. Atmosphere: AWKWARD. Basically we had our dinner in the middle of a....dance floor? They already had a DJ and people just drinking along the walls of the roo, and so it was so uncomfortable eating as we know that people are just watching us eat as they drink and socialize. Like, WHAT IS THIS. Either be a restaurant or be a club, but don't try to be both at the same exact time. Couldn't you have brought in the DJ a little later in the night? Ok, I'm done.

Huge portion for an appetizer!I also ordered the Asian Sangria to drink. It just tasted like white wine with slices of some fruit thrown in. Not anything special. My boyfriend ordered the Five Star's General Chicken and I ordered the Crispy Sesame Beef. We also got a side of the fried rice. I wish that we would have just ordered the appetizer + one meal to share. Wayyy too much food! The Crispy Sesame Beef is a unique idea but I did not love the execution.

Their Crispy Beef and Heat Seeker Shrimp are by far our favorite dishes on the menu. The Crispy Beef is an entree and the Heat Seeker Shrimp come in either appetizer or entree portions. Rice comes on the side for both orders. There are several good appetizers on the menu along with tasty and affordable entrees. Wednesday nights after 9 pm were our favorite times to go as they would have half off appetizers. It's a great place to meet some friends, drink some beers, and have some Crispy Beef and Heat Seeker shrimp. They also have a full bar with some draft beers on tap.

You can dress up or down, and can also be a good date spot. A great space that reflects both the warehouse feel and stylish accents. They have great upbeat music instead of the same old hum drum background stuff and I like that. Once settled in, I examined their 3 courses for $20 Restaurant Week menu and was pleased with the offerings.

For dessert, some warm chocolate cake. Although it did not match the entree it still was a good finish to a great meal.

Restaurant week is my favorite thing and I can't believe how inexpensive it is. The Five Star menu was $20 for three courses consisting of an appetizer, entree, and dessert. For the appetizer we all got something different and decided to share sort of tapas style. We had the heatseeker shrimp, Crab Rangoons, and Chinese BBQ Pork Tostadas. I am not a shrimp person but with some peer pressure I decided to try it. It was actually very good and did not taste \"fishy\". The serving size for the shrimp was also very large. I would have never guessed that we would get a whole bowl of shrimp. The crab rangoon was my appetizer of choice. It was very good (I'm not sure why I have always loved crab rangoon even though it is seafood). For my entree I had the Grilled Beef Tenderloin and it had a Sweet Pepper Relish and Black Bean Sauce. They also give you rice as well. The tenderloin was perfect! The relish and sauce mixed with the rice made a perfect side! \u00a0Everything was cooked to perfection.By the time dessert came out I was stuffed. But lets be honest...there is always room for dessert. I went with the warm chocolate cake. It wasn't too bad but I was hoping it would have been a bit richer.

Gotta say this place has their food nailed down. We came in around 5:30pm on a Friday so not many people were there yet.

I'm not much of a shrimp person, but gotta say I found myself munching down on these until I had to pull them away before I filled up. I had the Crispy Sesame Beef and I gotta say this was an incredible dish. Lots of food, we should've split this one, but even though I just made it through about half, reheated this stuff was still just as great. Lots of flavor with just enough kick to keep you coming back.She had the Five Star General's Chicken.

The power lunches come with a shrimp roll or soup, and your choice of white or fried rice.At dinner, I prefer to share with a group. The heat seeker shrimp are always a must. I'm also a big fan of the crispy green beans and scallion pancakes. The entrees are huge portions of some of the lunch items. You can feed a family with basically two entrees and a few small plates.At night, Five Star turns into a dance club. I've heard stories that it used to be a hole-in-the-wall before it was a restaurant. Five Star was a venue for Hopscotch Music Festival pre-2014, but the downstairs is pretty small and it's relatively far from the other venues.Service can be hit-or-miss, especially at lunch when they are running with a small crew. At dinner, I haven't had any issues.Five Star is one of my favorite restaurants downtown and a great option for a casual dinner."], ["Anthony M.", "What a great place!! Food was awesome and the decor and atmosphere had a great urban feel. Happy I read through yelp before so my fianc\u00e9 and I didn't order too much food. One appetizer and one entree was enough.

I'm not sure if management knows what kind of vibe they are giving in the dining area. In some ways it is very nice with wine glasses for your water and the candles on the table. However, the carpet is super cheap, the walls have chipped paint, and their music comes from a generic wireless speaker that is visible to all patrons up on the ledge of the wall near the ceiling. Gratuity is 20% for five people or more, whereas most places I go, the cut off is six or more. Also, they make you use chopsticks and if you want a fork they charge you 75 cents. I think that is insane. I think they could up their prices on the entrees by 25 cents and end up making more money and appearing classier and not so cheap to patrons than charging to use forks. Also, the lack of forks also means you have no knives at the table, making it very hard to cut up your food (chicken in our rice or the peppers in our salad)The heat seeker shrimp, pot stickers, fried rice, and mixed green salad were all great and reasonable priced. However, most Chinese places are reasonable priced and you always seem to have a ton of food for what you paid for, so five star is no exception to the norm. Overall, I was not really impressed and would rather so somewhere else (that doesn't charge for forks) for good Chinese food."], ["Caroline J.", "I went here for the first time with a group for a birthday dinner. Most of my friends have been here before, and some said it's good/some said it's not that good. The one friend said he didn't like how sweet the sauces are and how they put so much on. I love sweet Asian foods so, it's cool with me. I thought it looked really nice inside, we sat in the middle of the restaurant right in front of these mirrors/couch area. I thought it was kind of awkward since there were people just sitting on the couch and if I just moved my head slightly we'd probably be staring at each other. Eh, but it wasn't a problem, kind of funny. So there was a group of 10, and so I know there were a lot of us. But I don't think any of us cared that it took a awhile to get drinks, food, etc. The waitress was really really....not good though. My boyfriend thought she was either new or just not good at being a waitress. I wouldn't mind as much if she looked like she cared. She just seemed spacey and blah. Some of the people ordered appetizers, and she didn't ask me if I wanted anything (I mean I didn't want anything anyways) BUT she brings something out and asks if it's mine--ummm I didn't even order anything at that point. I just thought...uh maybe she could pay attention? In the end, our checks were so screwed up. Three of us didn't even get our bills, and she didn't even come back. So we were just so confused and waited a long time. Finally, we see her and one of the guys goes up to her and she comes over. She just says that \"oh yours has been paid for\" to one of us 3...we're all so confused. In my mind I thought oh like someone must of paid for the birthday girl.....but the girl who didn't get charged wasn't even the birthday girl-she was just sitting next to the birthday girl. Our friend clearly told the waitress who the birthday girl was, but she was too ditsy to pay attention. I really liked the food though. The portions were huge and the broccoli just tasted so good/fresh."], ["myra f.", "If I could have done 2 and 1/2 stars I would have. Food good. Soups lacking but everything else quite good. Appetizers were nice sized. Shrimp that everyone raves over is good but quite sweet. If it sits in the sauce at the bottom it's soggy. Calamari very good. They were out of all dumplings when we were there. Egg rolls were decent. Dinner portion sizes are huge. Definitely share. We had chicken, beef, shrimp entrees all were well cooked. \u00a0Now for the down side. Service, awful. Our waitress needed training. She was pretty bad. We had a party of 8, very easy group. Between apps and entrees it took over an hour and a half for food to show up. No explanation nothing. We were not in a rush, but there was no reason for such a delay. While the restaurant was busy as it was graduation that day, it was not over crowded. \u00a0Drinks from the bar, we only did one round because service was so bad. The drinks themselves were quite good. It took a half hour for drinks to come from the bar. We could see them made and placed on the bar, as our table was about 8 feet from bar. Our waitress brought them over one at a time. Some of our tables meals came out before others. Very inconsistent. Some items we ordered never showed up. Some items only part of the item came out, example a chicken dish with pancakes, only the pancakes came??For the icing on the cake, they charge a 20% mandatory gratuity on the bill including the tax. If we had not had such bad service I would not be so upset about this. If an establishment is not going to properly train servers then please don't make the gratuity on top of the tax. The bartender seemed trained, cooks were obviously trained as food was very good, hostess very nice, waitress UGH..."], ["Cait H.", "I love Asian cuisine. I mean, like really a lot. Like pretty much any day of week you could offer it to me and I would pretty much say \"yes\" without hesitation.That being said, I obviously loved Triangle Restaurant Week at Five Star. We made a late reservation on a whim and went downtown for some good eats. We started with the Heat Seeker Shrimp and the Crab Rangoon; both were piping hot, but I'd have to give the edge to the shrimp. They were battered and fried just enough to be crispy (not heavy or mushy), and were spicy enough to make me wiggle my nose with happiness. The Rangoon featured actual seafood and not just cream cheese, which also made my belly glad.I ordered the Five Star General's Chicken (their take on General Tso's) and Jay tried the Crispy Sesame Beef. Both were delicious, heaping portions and I would order them both on a return visit in a heartbeat. Our meals came with large bowls of rice and we were full enough to have leftovers for the next day.Dessert was kind of an afterthought, since we were so full (chocolate cake for me, and apple cake for Jay), but the ginger-infused whipped cream on the apple cake was a stroke of genius. I immediately had visions of topping hot chocolate with this lovely concoction. Yum.The menu features a lot of the classics, but if everything is as good as our TRW meal, I'm sure you can't lose. I will absolutely be back."], ["Nicki S.", "Our office move right across the street so this is the perfect place to grab a quick lunch! Tried multiple items from here, never been dissapointed.

Well, the general chicken was not as good as I remembered, wondering if the chef is changed, however , similar dish - fired sesame beef was way better than general chicken! \u00a0Since they are quite similar, you may not want to order both of them at the same time perhaps you can try different dishes!"], ["Lauryn C.", "I had a craving for some good Chinese food while I was in DTR. \u00a0I was right around the corner from Five Star and I realized I've had a lot of drinks here but I've never actually eaten here. \u00a0I stopped in around 8pm on a Wed night, there were a few big tables around us but it wasn't close to being full. \u00a0The hostess informed us that the kitchen was very far behind so she was going to have to put us on a 15min wait, weird. \u00a0Given that amount of people in the joint there is no reason a kitchen should be that far behind it's not like this is a new restaurant figuring it all out. Anyways we decided to grab a drink at the bar, and after meeting the friendly bartender and some folks at the bar we decided to just stay at the bar to eat as well. \u00a0I guess Wed. nights are very popular here because of the 1/2 price apps till 7pm. \u00a0 Well we already missed the deal but decided to go ahead and order the tuna app and the tofu lettuce wraps.

After an evening on the town I love to stop at Five Star for a bite to eat on my way home (open until 11:30p or midnight every day!). They serve huge portions and my boyfriend and I usually end up getting a couple apps to split. The heat seeker shrimp are one of the best known, a little sweet and spicy mix and an appetizer big enough for 3-4 at least. I also love the scallion pancakes, crab rangoon and the green beans as always a 'healthier' but tasty option. I've tried the spicy beef noodle as an entree, ended up splitting it and still having a large portion to take home (again, the servings are large). You can also get a side of lo mein or fried rice if you want to jazz up your appetizers (although note that they don't put proteins in the sides). I love hot and sour soup, but that's probably the only thing I've had so far here that I wouldn't recommend, there are so many other better options of the menu.

We were given a nice romantic table by the window and an excellent waitress served us. For starters we both had the Heat Seeker Shrimp. This app was big enough to be a main course. The shrimp were served to us steaming hot and the flavor was excellent. Hubby said he tasted some heat in the dish, I would have liked it to be spicier. But even without it being spicy, it was a delicious hit and once again I was eating the garnish (carrots, cucumbers) and drinking the sauce from the bottom. For our next course hubby had the generals chicken, which was huge and so yummy. It didn't have any greasy fried taste, the pieces weren't too big to put in your mouth, it was just wonderful. I had ordered the duck, but when it arrived it was about six little tiny pieces of duck, so before the waitress put it down, I made a sad face at the lack of food, so she immediately asked me what I would like instead, and within minutes the sesame beef was sitting in front of me, the same huge portion as my hubby's, and I was a happy diner. For dessert we both had the banana cake. The best part of that was the caramelized banana. This was a wonderful meal at a nicely decorated restaurant with lots of helpful wait staff. I asked one to take our photo and he was real nice about it too. We parked on the road by the Trolly Pub, so that was fun too to see where it originated and the cool mural on the wall.

In the last month or two it has really started to go downhill both in terms of food quality and service. Tonight was the third try and maybe the last. We ordered online to go. Food was done on time which was great but the guy that brought us the food when we got there for pickup treated us like more of a burden than a customer. We are usually asked if we need soy sauce, utensils, etc. This time we weren't asked, so my husband asked for extra soy sauce. The response was something along the lines of, \"You already have 4 in the bag\" as if we are trying to rip them off of a couple soy sauce packets I something.When we got the food home, the flavor in general was underwhelming. Thai chicken lettuce wraps were ok but the lettuce that came with it was browning on the edges like it had been sitting in a bag in the freezer for a while. The Kung Pao was a major disappointment. Both dishes were way too salty. I was also there for lunch during the work week about a month ago getting take out when I witnessed staff copping an attitude with each other - the chefs in the back getting attitudes with the folks trying to manage customers. It looked like a major breakdown in order management and communication. In their defense, it was really busy at the time. One of the guys we recognized as doing a fantastic job managing/running the Cary town center location extremely successfully during busy times was trying to control the chaos at the falls location but to no avail.

Complementary fried noodles- good. And I like the dunk sauce they have on the table. Imperial Egg Roll- cabbage explosion and not much else, You'll be loading up on the sauce to get any flavor out of it.  IMPERIAL BEEF- I wanted to take any food quality issues out of it so I ordered the Imperial beef which is a NY Strip \"with our special sauce\", so no issue of poor cuts or grizzle should enter the equation. The steak was prepared to a uniform brown- no searing, no pink middle. The \"special sauce\" was just a nearly tasteless brown sauce that added nothing at all to the experience. In fact what happened is that a nice steak was unseasoned and then poorly prepared and then further degraded by being covered in a superfluously \u00a0ooze. For the $20 it would have been better just to send the steak out with the broccoli. Sweat and Sour Chicken- Kind of heavy on the breading and a bland sauce that was all sweet and just a faint background vinegar. More like candied chicken. The piano playing I wanted to like, and he seems like a nice guy but it was problematic. I am not OCD at all but it is a bit stress inducing to be there for dinner service when he is constantly shifting between songs. It puts you in the mind of \"Name that Tune\" where you can't enjoy the food because you are trying to recall the song. Worse he plays in a medley style (\"those imperial Star Wars....\") where each song gets about 60 seconds before he is on to the next. I would suggest that he just stick to classical pieces and let them go 5 or 10 minutes, so that the playing complements the meal rather than constantly distracting the dinners. I wast keen enough on Imperial to try it again. Perking Garden would probably be a better choice, but in reality in North Raleigh its probably better to just skip Chinese and go to a Thai restaurant (for instance Lemongrass) which will be an all around superior experience."], ["Jess S.", "My go-to Chinese take-out place! Never has disappointed. Prompt service, great food. The selection is relatively standard; it's nothing extraordinary or particularly unique. Whatever I have ordered though has been simply spot-on.

Love, CaitSeriously, this app is the main reason to go to Imperial Garden. My parents usually pick this spot for a nicer sit-down Chinese experience, and they don't usually disappoint. The atmosphere is pretty standard, but the live piano music is really fun. If you have no whimsy, you'll probably hate it. But my brother and I usually find ourselves grooving to whatever Elton John hit or showtune is coming out of the piano man. (He takes requests too! A little girl gave him a dollar and he played Row, Row, Row Your Boat. Fantastic.)I always start with hot tea, but they have a beer, wine and soda menu. The wait staff usually leaves the pot of tea on the table for you to pour yourself, but if they notice your cup getting low, they'll run over and pour for you. Unnecessary, but appreciated nonetheless.The fried dumplings are a family favorite, so we always get 2 orders. It does take a while for them to come out, but it's totally worth it. The dough is chewy and crisp in all the right places, the pork is juicy, and the dipping sauce (or pour over the top sauce, depending on your mood) is salty and scalliony. I would be completely satisfied to have rice, a plate of dumplings and tea for my meal, but why stop there?Most of the entrees I've tried at Imperial have been very good; Chicken with Garlic Sauce, Mongolian Beef, Hot Shredded Beef, Mushu Pork, etc. Yes, it's Americanized Chinese fare, but hey - I like what I like. I always have fun and enjoy myself. The portions are plentiful if you feel like sharing.They have Tsingtao (beer) which my Dad loves and apparently pronounces correctly, because the staff is usually surprised and/or excited about that. One time, our waiter exclaimed that he was from the part of China where this beer is brewed (my Dad has traveled there on business) and they chatted away about the locale while the rest of us chomped on crunchy, salty noodles. The service is great; a combo of friendly and prompt.Sometimes you get a secret, surprise dessert after your meal...which I have to say, I hate. They bring individual squares of a chocolate cake-ish dessert with some kind of coffee/mousse filling. If you like coffee and chocolate, you'll probably be in free dessert heaven, but I usually take a few bites to be polite and stop there. Fortune cookies please!"], ["Penny P.", "Ordered the Hunan beef, sesame chicken, hot & sour soup, wonton soup and egg rolls... all were on point! Such good Chinese food for a good price!

It's absolutely fantastic. Their sesame chicken also takes a spicy note rather than a sweet one, which is something I definitely appreciate. If you're looking for something sweet I recommend the lemon chicken. The lemon sauce comes in a bowl the same size as the soup, so you'll have plenty to cover all your food.

I've come in person to dine-in several times, and ordered take-out several times as well, including in snow and rain, without having any of the bad experiences other people have had on here. My favorite dish here is the Moo Shu Pork, and I especially enjoy ordering it while I'm dining in. I'm not sure if all of the wait staff do this, but there's an older man who assembles the wraps in front of you when he brings out the dish, and he does an amazing job. You end up with four perfectly wrapped pancakes, with just the right amount of both sauce and filling. I haven't ordered another dish in person since realizing that they do this here. I'm not crazy about the mushrooms they use, but the other ingredients are all good and the pork has no fat. I've ordered other dishes for takeout, and it's worth mentioning that they seem to cook the ingredients separately and then combine them in the final dish. For takeout, this means if you order something like sesame chicken, all of the broccoli is at the bottom, and all of the chicken is at the top. If you don't empty out the whole carton, you may not even realize that there's broccoli in the dish until you go for leftovers. On top of that, the service has been consistently attentive and fast. I've never had an empty water glass while dining in, and the food has been ready when I've come to pick up an order. I wouldn't come here expecting much small talk, but they're very efficient and good at doing their jobs. Generally, I'm between four and five stars for Red Dragon, as long as you appreciate it for what it is - good, fast, American-Chinese food.

The vegetables suffered a little from being enclosed in the very-heat-retaining container during the drive from Pearl to my dining destination, but were still unlimp enough to indicate that they had been nicely cooked prior to their impromptu extra steaming. The tofu wasn't tough, with just enough of a crisp bite to remind you of the magic that is frying, and either MSG is not used or I'm losing my pretty nasty reaction to it - or the precautionary sweetened beverage I knocked back afterward did the trick better than usual (tip for others with MSG sensitivity: rapidly drinking a sweet & caffeinated drink tends to cut back on the reaction for me).So it isn't fine dining laden with culinary wonders in a lush, elegant setting.

The food is great and for a good price, but what really stuck out to me was the exceptional water.Let me walk you through my experience: Immediately upon walking in a hostess sits my party of four at arguably the best booth. \"What will you have to drink?\" she asks. \"Water.\" \"Would you like that with or without a lemon?\" Okay let me stop you right here. Most restaurants don't give you this sort of choice. They'd rather you sweat over whether or not you get any fruit in your water. I've even been upset with other restaurants for not telling me I would or would not get a lemon in my drink. Not telling the customer whether he or she will get a lemon is perhaps the biggest turnoff for a restaurant as far as I'm concerned. Good on Hibachi for offering such an option.So I go and get my food. It's pretty good, but boy am I thirsty from eating it (not saying the food is dry, just that I was pretty thirsty on this day). And what do you know, here I have this water glass filled to the brim, with the perfect amount of ice and a lemon as gorgeous as the first sunrise (on the brim of the cup) waiting to embrace me like true love.Also, I should mention that Hibachi doesn't just make you use a straw. They bring you your cups and straws (wrapped) separately. Personally, I chose to use one, but some of my companions did not, and I respected that because that's their own business.So I sip on this water and let me tell you, Yelp community, there is nothing on this great planet I would rather have passed through my lips at that moment. It was cold (due to the perfection of ice to water ratio). It was refreshing. And it didn't taste like lemon.Whoa. It didn't taste like lemon? You must be wondering why this seems so great to me.Some restaurants put lemons in their water and it gives it this weird, half-lemon-half-water taste. If I wanted extra watered down lemonade, I would have asked for it. Instead, I asked for water with lemon. And this, my friends, is for aesthetic purposes only.Think of a glass of water without a lemon on it.Now think of one with a lemon.Which looks like the most delicious thing you could ever have? I'm going to guess it's the one with the lemon.Throughout the meal(s), the staff refilled my water a few times. All the while, they maintained the perfect ice-water ratio, thus keeping my water in a perpetual state of optimal refreshment the entire experience.Drinking this water, I felt my soul grow weary for all those lost to war. I felt generations of emotions and felt the expansion of the universe. I saw through time.So if you find yourself on Capital Blvd, be sure to stop by. Sure, the food is great and costs only $10, but if you get anything at all, make sure it's the water. I would even pay $10 for this water.

Seating is comfortable and the place is really clean! \u00a0And the kicker is that lunch is about $7, a ridiculous price for all the food you've got here at Hibachi Grill. \u00a0So yeah, it may not be gourmet but if you're on Capital and looking for something that will please the entire family without denting your wallet, Hibachi Grill and Supreme Buffet is a great choice! \u00a0Just make sure you punch that extra hole in your belt before stepping into the place, you've been warned..."], ["P C.", "This restaurant is pathetic, poor everything..--------------there is some confusion for folks here, there is a second Hibachi chinese buffet further north on capital blvd at Millbrook road, that restaurant is 4+ stars and quiet possibly the best chinese buffet in raleigh... the supreme grill .. this one... it just sucks!"], ["Alicia X.", "Not impressive at all. Not many choices for sushi. The beef for Hibachi seems not fresh. The food are too oily. Don't have much seafood as other Chinese buffets. Very slow to refill the food. As a Chinese, I cannot find anything even close to Chinese food. Won't come back again."], ["Adnan C.", "In short: above average Chinese buffet, most of them fresh and delicious, large selection, lack of beef dishes.This is probably the best Chinese buffet in Raleigh, I have been to 8/9 others. As you can guess from other reviews, there's a lot to choose from. I like starters a lot (read : fried and salty) and you can easily fill 2 plates with 1 starter each. All of them were fresh, crispy. In the main courses, there are shrimp dishes, crawfish(!), and* lots* of chicken dishes. The sauteed shrimps were large and tasty. \u00a0I am not a fan of American-Chinese style of fried-sticky-sweet chicken, you will get plenty of these here. But dont worry, lot of chicken dishes are there with salty-\"umami\"ness that will satisfy you.One big grudge is the lack of beef dishes. I like beef, and was disappointed to see \u00a0only 2 beef dishes---beef brocolli stir fry and beef pot roast (though, it was named prime steak).There is a hibachi section where you can make your own mix of raw food and the griller will cook it for you. We havent used it though.The desert section is adequate, nothing fancy. The desert section in Golden Corral was much better.Overall, we were satisfied, and it would've been our choice for preferred Chinese Buffet if we did not live in South Raleigh. \u00a0 3.5 star."], ["Frederick L.", "Nothing like having the midday munchies hit JUST as you are passing by this awesome buffet! They have tons of selection here including the Hibachi Grill section and a really good Sushi Bar. My weakness at these buffets are, of all things, the dinner rolls! They are so good! Buttered, oven fresh, and oh so good.I like to start with the Sushi bar to get the ball rolling. Great selection of stuff. I can never remember what they are called or what I had, but I usually go down the line of them and tend to favor anything that is bright and colorful, LOL! Great Sushi Chef they've got here.As for the entree, I'm a huge fan of the General Tso's chicken, bourbon chicken, fried rice, chinese dumplings, pepper chicken (starting to see a pattern) and sesame chicken. They are all cooked to the level you would expect in a sit down and order from the menu restaurant. Of all the chickens, I highly recommend trying the General Tso's if you haven't done so already! Sweet and tangy, yet conservative like a comedic politician, LOL! (Don't ask how I came up with that, it just came to mind). In all seriousness, it is fantastically tastey!The restaurant itself is large and extremely clean. They have a gorgeous oriental type water fountain structure thingy to the right as you walk in to the place. Probably the largest one I've ever seen. The staff is phenomenal and I couldn't help but to notice the really attractive hostesses. I get the feeling my girlfriend will now ban me from going here, LOL!A great dining experience and one of the best buffets I regularly go to!"], ["Max L.", "Since Yelp removed my initial review, I am reposting. Surprised by the positive reviews. Has broad selection, but most is mediocre and lacks flavor."], ["Thomas V.", "Selection was large but the quality was mediocre. Friday night so the place was busy and loud. No beer, no wine, can't think of a Chinese place without Tsing Tao. Price was reasonable."], ["Nene K.", "I used to think that buffets were for poor, distasteful souls who could not see the value in a portion-controlled, quality meal. So when my mom suggested that I try the new Hibachi Grill on Capital Blvd, I instantly dismissed it as \"not the kind of place I frequent.\"I finally went to the buffet as part of a celebration for my dad's birthday. And I've been going back ever since! Guys, the food here is top-notch, and this place gets it right every time. In the mood for dumplings? All the time! Fried shrimp? Why not! Fresh, fresh sushi including unagi sushi? Of course! And for those who aren't into the Chinese/Japanese/American cuisine hybrid, there are plenty of more down-home options like mac & cheese, ham, and scores of chicken dishes. More than you could ever imagine. I've never eaten dessert here, but there is a sizable selection of ice cream, fruit, and other delectables. Yum.And did I mention the price?? $6.99 for the lunch buffet, $8.99 - $9.99 for the dinner buffet. Criminal. Prices hover around $12.99/person for holidays such as Christmas, Mother's Day, or Father's Day. Verdict: There is nothing more American than a Chinese buffet. If you are someone who tends to avoid buffets, for whatever reason, you may give up that habit when you visit Hibachi."], ["Caroline H.", "The only things good about this place are the service and the day glo d\u00e9cor.The buffet is mostly to be avoided--it alternates between syrupy chicken done ten ways and mysterious cheesy casseroles. The hot n sour soup lived up to neither of its adjectives. In fact, almost no spice is in evidence in any of the dishes.The hibachi grill is one of the better options here, though the aforementioned lack of flavor is in effect here as well. The sushi is also better than the buffet (nothing spectacular, but that is to be expected at a Chinese buffet). If they can do the extras mediocre, why not the main attraction? Instead, the buffet was basically inedible.Avoid, avoid, avoid."], ["Mike O.", "The Cadillac of buffets. Seriously, at lunch $7 gets you the full buffet, crazy-fire-esque hibachi grill, and better sushi than even some Japanese restaurants I've been to. The only thing missing here is burritos, but I guess that wouldn't really fit now would it? I've never had a better buffet in my life. Protip: Make sure you try the coconut chicken!"]], "Wang's Kitchen": []}
