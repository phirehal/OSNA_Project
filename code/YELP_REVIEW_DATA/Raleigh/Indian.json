I was hungry, and in no mood for socialization. A friend had reminded me of Kadhai, and I conceived a craving for lamb. Book in hand, I showed up for a late dinner. I don't believe I've ever visited for dinner before. There was a good sized crowd in the restaurant, though it was not full. The bad: my drink order was not taken for quite some time. It seemed I was in between the two waitresses zones, in some limbo land of no-one-wants-a-one-top. Finally a young waitress I've never seen there before took my order with a rather surly air. This poor service continued through the night. It was lucky I was in no hurry, or it would have truly bothered me. Look, I know a little bit about the restaurant business. A one-top is not as profitable as a larger party, though nearly as much work. I get that. But that's no reason to provide poor service, especially to a regular. It was extra frustrating to me, because I am a habitually large tipper. I know what wait staff go through. In this case, though, I was moved to only tip 10% - a harsh judgement, by my lights.The good: the lamb korma was truly outstanding. I asked for it to be made hot, and it was. It was that perfect level of spice - warm enough to make one sweat a bit, but not so hot that you can't taste the flavors. Korma sauce includes almond slivers and raisins and it was amazing. Even the rice tasted special. I have no idea how that was accomplished, but I was not about to complain. I also ordered a garlic naan, but this was not the best example I've had. The naan itself was good, but somehow the garlic topping was kind of dry and tasteless. I'm a fan of their masala tea as well. It was the perfect ending to an excellent meal.All in all, it was just what I wanted: a quiet retreat with good lamb."], ["Chris D.", "The food is ALWAYS on point!! Butter Chicken never disappoints!!

I also had a portion of chicken kheema which was okay (again coz of the spice level)."], ["Chris M.", "Lovely Pakistan / India / Mediterranean fusion (the \"ish\" in kababish.). \u00a0The owners and servers were very sweet and helpful. \u00a0The onion Pakora is the best I've had. \u00a0goat biryani had a nice flavor. \u00a0Not hot spicy, but a slow burn. \u00a0Saag Paneer was very fresh and not at all runny like some I've had. \u00a0The portions were quite large. \u00a0I learned today that Gulab Jamun is made with cheese. \u00a0Who knew? \u00a0These had a nicer texture than the ones at most Indian buffets. \u00a0We'll be back and next time remember to bring our own wine."], ["Dennis M.", "Everything was DELICIOUS, and the staff was very nice!

The mint/cilantro dipping sauce with lentil flat bread was the best part of the meal. The hummus was fresh and flavorful, but the black olives served with it were rather flavorless. Tiki masala was great and served with perfectly prepared rice. There is limited outdoor seating, the atmosphere was relaxed and the staff was competent.

We ended up ordering a lot more food to go, because what we had at the restaurant was that good. The haleem, chicken kebabs and wraps were amazing, as was the chat.

She explained that all the food is freshly prepared, \"farm-to-table\" style. Her husband Syed Yousuf appeared from the kitchen, to visit us briefly and check on our satisfaction with the meal. \u00a0We were served chai, and we had a wonderful dessert served in a tall glass dish. \u00a0I can't recall all that was in it, but I remember it had some rose syrup, and was white and pink in color."], ["Shelly E.", "We ate here during their soft opening and had a great meal! The owners are so friendly and welcoming. Our dinners were delicious and the naan bread and rice they served were spot on.

Chang's - fortunately Garland is better than that!Our first stop on our whirlwind NC tour, Garland, is set in an upscale bar, but the food they serve is pretty reasonably priced, especially for the portion size.For lunch, I ordered the Beef & Noodles - a really interesting dish; I thought it tasted like pad thai + Vietnamese rice vermicelli bowl (bun thit) + Korean bulgogi. True Asian fusion! It was refreshing to eat on a warmer Raleigh day, and I felt better about myself since it was served on top of a bunch of greens heh.My friends and I also split their Moroccan \"hummus\" with which the chickpeas were whole, not mashed/pureed like a typical hummus. Pretty tasty and different from most chickpea dishes I've had.Overall, a very solid introduction to our trip to NC. If I lived in Raleigh, I would definitely try their Indian (also Asian, don't you forget it!) influenced foods!"], ["Warren N.", "I was told that Garland was Asian fusion cuisine, so that's what I was expecting my first time dining here. I disagree with calling it Asian fusion style, and would lean much more to referring to it as having Indian style dishes. So, if you don't like Indian food, I wouldn't recommend Garland. Also, if you are a picky eater, don't bother dining here. We had one picky eater in our group, and I could tell she had no idea what to order. The menu is very small and there is a limited number of entr\u00e9es listed. However, if you do like Indian food, definitely check this place out! The atmosphere is super laid back. It is a smaller restaurant downtown, so get here on the earlier side as seats will fill up. The staff was friendly and helpful with the menu. I think it would be good to go back with a group of friends and try a variety of the small plates which all sounded good. I tried the tandoor chicken. It was excellent! Such a fun dish with so many options of how to eat it. The naan bread was delicious. The chicken was crispy, super flavorful, and not too spicy. The peppers and onions were a great touch to add to the chicken. The yogurt sauce was delicious as well. I wished there was more of the cauliflower and carrots given with the dish, as I felt I only got one bite and it was all gone. I was not a fan of the mint sauce. The prices are a bit on the high side, but the food is high quality and very flavorful. Everyone else at the table loved their dishes too. I have to come back here to try the small plates and some of the fancy cocktails! This is a chill, but higher end, restaurant downtown. If you're looking for somewhere new and cool to try, I'd recommend it!"], ["Wood C.", "My girl and I ate there last Friday, 8/14..., our res was at 6:45pm.Vibe was modern, and chill...We opened with the Local Heirloom Tomato Plate, and her entree was the Tandoor Chicken, mine was the Pork Rice Bowl - each dish was simply awesome. She had a white wine with dinner, and I had the Magdalena (unique and tasty).Nice gesture - a 2nd glass of wine was forgotten, and our server comped it when we reminded her of it. All in all, service was very good.Do yourself a favor, and hit this place up ..."], ["Lindsay H.", "After initially being disappointed by Garland, I have revisited a few times and it has gotten better with each meal. After trying more things on the menu, I would definitely recommend Garland for a date night or a fun birthday dinner. The ambiance is cool and trendy, service is okay, but the food is really creative.Recommend:Pork Belly Rice Bowl - crunchy, sweet, spicy, tangy - there are so many flavors going on. A hearty portion and a delicious meal.Lamb Curry - so flavorful, not too spicy, very fillingCauliflower/Chicken 65 - I actually liked the cauliflower even better than the chicken. The sauce on this appetizer is unreal. Spicy and complex."], ["Sandy N.", "Dinner is on the pricey side of things, so take note. The Birds Nest appetizer was good but super crumbly from what I'm use to. Beautiful presentation though! If you go for the Lamb Curry, ask for extra whipped coconut cream. It's more salty as opposed to savory. Garland is a cool place to go if you and your friends want to share the price of meals though!"], ["Lauryn C.", "I guess Garland wins as far as review updates go for this lady. I feel like every time I come here it's for something different! I visited Garland for New Years for their 6 course sparkling wine dinner and it was amazing, not to mention one of the best deals in town for New Years. How can you beat all the delicious food (6 courses) with a sparkling wine pairing sooooo good!Now I wanted to update my review because I recently visited for lunch. I honestly didn't know Garland was open for lunch but now that I know it will be a regular spot for me. My friend and I ordered the tofu noodle bowl and pork bahn mi. I've had a few bahn mi's in my life and as far as the Triangle goes this has to be one of my faves. The tofu noodle bowl was also delicious I really enjoyed the crispy chickpea noodles.If you haven't checked out Garland for lunch yet you are missing out."], ["Lindsay S.", "Last night, I got a small group of folks together for dinner. I've been to Garland on two separate occasions before and really enjoyed the food. On both previous occasions, we were seated at the large table in the middle. This time, I was coming with an elderly gentleman and we all wanted to make sure we could hear each other since it was more of a dinner meeting so I called and asked for a reservation for 5 people in the back corner of the restaurant, in hopes it would not be as loud.Our reservation was ready on time and we decided to start off by ordering a few appetizers to share: Pakora, Bhel puri, and the chili cucumber salad. I'd had the Pakora previously and remembered it well. It's a \"bird's nest\" style appetizer collection of fritters of farmers market vegetables, spicy chickpea and rice batter, and served with tamarind and cilantro-mint chutney. I have enjoyed it each time I've had it. I'd never had the Bhel puri or chili cucumber salad. The Bhel Puri was a dry collection of puffed crunchy mix with diced potatoes, cucumbers, jicama, local greens, peanuts, and a few other flavorful items. The Chili Cucumber Salad was pretty simple: warm chili oil, Szechuan peppercorn, a rice wine vinaigrette, and of course the cucumber spears and some chilis thrown in for extra flavor. The Pakora and Chili Cucumber Salad were both Gluten Free items. None of them were very spicy at all.Next, we opted to order a some large plates to share. The Tandoor Chicken was served on a large platter. Though quite extensive, with Tandoori roti, chicken skin pappadum, summer squash and tomato braise, raita, and a few other items, all agreed that this dish seemed to lack flavor. My favorite item on the menu is the Pork Rice Bowl, which I've had on my two previous visits to Garland. It's quite flavorful with its variety of items: pork shoulder, crisp sticky brown rice, kimchi style pickles, chili sauce, fried local egg, and a special slaw. It's one of the cheaper items on the menu, at $15, and the best, in my opinion. The burst of flavors did not disappoint on this occasion either. Finally, we ordered a Lamb Curry and a Vegetable Curry as well.The service at Garland was great. Very attentive gentleman server took care of us. It was very ceremonial when small plates were distributed and someone even complied with our elder gentleman's request to wipe the table down mid-dinner when we made a mess. It certainly wasn't easy for the servers to distribute food, pick up and drop off plates, and refill waters, with us being far back in the corner, but they did it very well and delicately. Garland is beautiful, but the hard concrete floors with the low ceilings makes for an extremely loud echo and difficult acoustics to have conversation in. The art on the walls is amazing as is even the bathroom decor. Be sure to check out the flooring with pennies laid down like tile! (A waste in my opinion, but cool looking...) The air was also very chilly. My mother and I were quite cold in our sleeveless shirts, but even the gentleman with us in a sport jacket was very cold. Garland is the type of places that you're dying to go back to because the food is so good and you definitely get what you pay for in terms of food quality and service, but the atmosphere, which isn't incredibly peaceful, can dissuade you from returning or taking a group there. That Pork Rice Bowl gets me every time though... and the decor certainly makes the restaurant live up to its name of elegance."], ["Mollyann R.", "My boyfriend and I went here for dinner recently on a Friday night. We tried to make a reservation but we were told that the dining room was full but the bar area was first come first serve. I am never a fan of going out to eat on a busy night without a reservation but we decided to try out our luck.When we arrived the dining room was indeed packed with a few people waiting around. We weighed our options - wait for a bar seat or order something to go. The hostess knew that we were debating these options and she was extremely helpful in assisting us. She told us that she was about to seat a couple at a table and that we should grab their seats. I really felt like she went above and beyond for us. I was pleasantly surprised! She was a pro.We sat at the bar and got exceptional service from the bartender. My boyfriend ordered the pork rice bowl and I ordered the tofu rice bowl. Both were incredible dishes! For dessert, we ordered a confection trio. Delightful!We really enjoyed our overall experience, 5 star service, 5 star food, and 5 star ambiance. Loved it! Perfect for a date night or out with a group of friends. I will definitely be back."], ["Holly K.", "Holy bibimbap. Which they call a pork bowl here, this is the real deal. \u00a0My boyfriend an avid athlete with a big appetite and I shared the cauliflower appetizer and the pork bowl successfully. Literally conniving a reason to go back at this moment. The only thing they could do better is controlling smokers outside. As we ate outside someone sat down at one of the nearby restaurant tables and lit up. This was a situation for a manager to come handle as no one enjoys smoke wafting over their dinner."], ["Karine J.", "We picked Garland for two reasons, 1) I found it thanks to Yelp, 2) when I told my fianc\u00e9e she said a coworker had suggested it as well. So here we were most determined to go there for dinner. We arrived and were welcomed by the sweetest host, Germaine (if I recall correctly). We got set up at the bar where complimentary glasses of Champagne were waiting for us to cheer for my birthday! All the bartenders were as kind as it gets making sure we had all we needed without being intrusive. Adam, one of the bartenders, told us about the club they have downstairs and the concert room upstairs. Our food was simply spectacular, I will add photos as soon as I'm done here. I had the noodles and beef broth which was awesome and very filling. My fianc\u00e9e had the veg curry which was so delicious, I was a bit jealous though mine was still the bomb. Lol. Our grind had the lamb sausage which was so fresh it was a sin! After dinner we stepped outside to head to the downstairs club when Paul, the owner, came out to say hello and thank us for coming to dinner. Paul was, as you would expect by now, extremely nice and thankful that we had come. He shared with us the story of his establishment and was just a delight to chat with. Long story \"short\" we had an amazing time dining at Garland and the most fun dancing all night downstairs, where our host was then DJing!!! What an amazing team of people! Paul, we thank you for a memorable night and will have to come again next time we end up in Raleigh. I highly recommend this place Yelpers!!!"], ["Carol M.", "Lamb curry! Lamb curry!Yes, I got the lamb curry. It was really delicious. My friend is a huge fan of their tofu bibimbap (they call it a bowl I think but it's essentially the same thing). They list all their gluten-free items right on the menu too which is great. We got a 375ml bottle of cider to split between the two of us. Our waiter was super cool and kept it on ice for us and also poured it as we went. Legit wine service for our tiny cider bottle!They also had pavlova (an Aussie merengue dessert) as a special on the dessert menu that night. I'm so glad he recommended it because for the GF eaters this stuff is BOMB and they did a great job doing a single serving baking of this, but it's also plenty big enough to split between two people. Plus their bathroom floor is tiled with pennies and is absolutely beautiful. I'd definitely go back!"], ["Rose L.", "I finally tried out Garland and boy was it worth the wait. I've tried to visit Garland a handful of times without a reservation, and it's always been an extraordinary wait, my recommendation is make a reservation! Garland offers a variety of small plates as well as entrees and one of the best drink lists I've seen at a restaurant downtown. Not only do they list all their beers: drafts and bottles, but wines but the bottle or glass, cocktails AND a complete list of all their liquors as well. We decided to order two small plates and a large plate to share. Upon recommendation from our waitress, we ordered the Chicken 65 and the pakora to start. The food came out quick and I was immediately entranced by the flavors. The chicken 65 is a classic Indian dish marinaded in a turmeric yogurt sauce served with fresh curry leaves, \u00a0chiles, lime and cilantro. It's a little spicy but definitely a mouth full of flavor. The pakora reminded me of a play on sweet potato fries (don't make fun of me for my very 'American' descriptions) with Indian spices: cilantro and mint being the strongest to me. There were two sauces to dip the fritter/fries in although I though the dish was excellent sans sauces. For our main course, we enjoyed the pork rice bowl, which was unlike anything I've ever had before. After living in Asian for a year, I didn't think there were many things that could surprise me, but this did! It was a mix of all your flavors: sour, sweet, salty, savory and spicy/bitter. I loved the crisp sticky brown rice, which compliments the entire dish, along with the salty pork and sour kimchi pickles. The pickled slaw gave just the right about of sweetness while the chili sauce balanced the dish out with a little spice. The fried egg on top wound all the flavors together into a totally savory dish. The only downsides I see for Garland are the tiny space, tables can only hold two sampler plates at a time or one entree if you're sharing. While the wait staff does a good job at spacing things out, I still felt cramped and could hear the guests next to us entire conversations. In addition, entrees are pricy, running $14-21 a place, while the small plates run $6-14. Garland, while it's small, might actually be a better spot for drinks only or large (pre-reserved) groups where you're splitting things."], ["Andrew W.", "I never thought I could get so excited about cauliflower, until I met Garland's takeout window in 2013. Since then, they have earned their title as one of my favorite restaurants in downtown Raleigh right now. The Korean-Indian fusion is one of the most unique menus you can find, with no weak dishes. A lot of credit is due to the multi-talented Cheetie Kumar, Chef and guitarist (Birds of Avalon).More recently, they have opened their dining room for lunch. For someone that lives and works downtown, I'm very happy about this. So far, I've tried their banh mi sandwich and a delicious hot pot special with pork and tufu.Unlike some of the newer restaurants and shops in Raleigh, Garland has more unique decor that's modern, timeless, and also a little fun. Make sure to check out the frames on the back wall.Service is very solid. I actually watched a new server being trained, and then had the server the next time. He was awesome and checked in with us at all the right times.For the gluten-free folks, items are denoted on the menu. However, I noticed that the lunch menu only had a couple appetizer options. So, you may want to check the menu or opt for dinner if you have dietary needs."], ["Katie T.", "I snuck over here for lunch a couple of weeks ago with the boss. Upon entering the restaurant, I was immediately impressed: the decor is modern and tasteful. It's quite spacious (so deceptive from the outside) with a beautiful bar area and plenty of table seating (and it has a long bench - I love the long bench!)For my meal, I tried the Moroccan \"Hummus\" - stewed whole Moroccan chickpeas with popped Jasmine rice (amazing), tomatoes, and sesame (it also comes with crema but I withheld d/t diet) and it is served with these addicting tortilla strips. This would be a fantastic appetizer as well. My boss ordered the beef and noddle salad, and gave it thumbs up. Great service. Nice array of vegetarian/vegan options. The dinner menu looks outstanding and I will definitely be returning to try it out."], ["Elizabeth B.", "The cauliflower 65 was exquisitely flavorful. We had chicken tandoor as well that was beyond our expectations even though we already heard great things. Simply delicious and a must try for the downtown Raleigh area."], ["Casey K.", "Came here with a group of 5 girls on a Saturday night and had a blast.

Everything was great! The only thing you guys need to work on is service time."], ["Andrew K.", "I'll say this about Garland - It defies expectations. If you've been to many Indian restaurants you know what to expect from an order of Tandoor Chicken. pretty much Chicken wings that are red from the spices used in cooking it. Frankly, it's usually the most boring plate at an Indian restaurant. But if you go to Garland you'll be utterly surprised, because it won't look or taste like normal Tandoori chicken. Instead the chicken will be moist (gross word, but good when it comes to chicken), and served with a variety of sides, that are supposed to be mixed in with a Raita (bread), and eaten like a kind of taco/sandwich. And it's great. My favorite Tandoori chicken anywhere. It makes me question the meaning of Tandoori chicken is it just the oven it's cooked in? I don't know. Similarly, when I think of Pakora's, I think of a kind of vegetable dumpling. Not so at Garland! At Garland it's a \"bird's nest\" (their words) of fried vegetable bits, held together by onions. My picky vegetarian wife didn't love it, but still, it was nice to have a different experience. One last example: the Hummus isn't like any hummus you've had before. Instead of mashed chickpeas mixed with fat and oil, it's more like whole chickpeas with spices. And instead of pita to dip into it, it's more like fritos. And it really works. I've been happy with every dish I've tried at Garland. The Chicken 65 is maybe a little expensive for an appetizer, but damn, it's good. The curry dishes are great, with very tasty ingredients, which pleases my picky vegetarian wife. I also enjoyed the two pork dishes, especially the Bo Ssam. But for me, my go-to dish at Garland is the Tandoori chicken. The ambiance is alright. I love the decorations on the back wall of the place, with interesting prints, I guess representing fusion of cultures and food. That's a plus. Being right underneath a rock and roll club though is a minus. Having a band playing while you eat is a little unsettling, my crazy brain gets worried about the number of people right over my head. It's also quite loud. Still by and large it's a pleasant, clean, place to eat with nice decor. Every time I've been there the service has been pretty darn good, some of the waiters and waitresses even remember my wife and I, which is always a nice touch. Also, the proprietor of the restaurant is always buzzing around helping in a support role. If you talk to him, he's totally enthusiastic about his restaurant, and doesn't seem like the normal rage-aholic type that I associate with restaurant managers. Not a big deal, but I appreciate that the establishment probably doesn't treat it's waiter's like breathing garbage. I would take people who enjoy Indian food to Garland, so they can eat something that surprises and probably pleases them. I wouldn't take older relatives to Garland, as it may just confuse them."]], "Sri Meenakshi Bhavan": [], "Biryani Maxx Indian Cuisine": [["Apurva G.", "Easily the best Biryani in triangle.

Both of us agreed that we would not order the entrees again. Then the desserts came out and I got the key lime cake and I was super unimpressed. I took a bite and did not take another. The mango kulfi on the other hand was good and I don't usually like mango ice cream. The service was not great. It took us forever to get someone's attention about a mess up on our order. The host was not super friendly and everyone but one person who came up to us just seemed a little cold and in a hurry. I would give the service 1 star.

On their website it both lists their lunch hours as well as the lunch menu with the hours lunch is served. (Monday through Friday and Sunday from 12-3pm.) We had all looked the website over before going there as we wanted to make sure there is something we'd all like.Anyway, after we were seated in the almost empty restaurant (now I know why), the menu and prices weren't what any of us had seen online. So I asked about the lunch menu and those were brought to us. azitra.us/images/menu/pd\u2026Then after we ordered, we were told they were not serving lunch and would be getting the dinner item. We should have gotten up to leave then but we were in the mood for Indian.We were told the menus were a misprint. There was no comment about the website. Well, it is time for them to update both. I am not sure why we were given the lunch menu if we could not order from it.The dish I ordered from the lunch menu is not even on the dinner menu so I am not sure where they came up with the mysterious pricing for it. I will not return to an unethical restaurant again so the restaurant lost a few customers today because they would not honor the lunch menu that very clearly spelled out the lunch hours and prices.Thankfully there are other great Indian restaurants in the area for us to dine with better business practices."], ["Jay H.", "I feel like this place could have gotten 5 stars. Prior to eating the food though I was contemplating giving it 3 stars. The reason for it was the price. $17 for a lunch entr\u00e9e, and it wasn't even the most expansive thing on there. I got the chicken massala, which came with a bowl of rice. It was about 6-8 cubes of chicken dunked in tomato based sauce. Like someone else said on here, it looked like an appetizer. He gave this place a 1 star so I know where he is coming from. For $17, you would expect a salad or some type of side dish. Also, the Nan is a separate charge ($3) according to the menu. We ordered the Nan but to our surprise, when we got the bill, they left it out. I feel that Indian places should include Nan anyway and thought it was ridiculous that they would charge extra on top of the $17 for the entree. The reason why this place is good is bc of the food. There is no way I can give it a bad review, even if the price is what it is for lunch. I guess this is why they can justify these prices. Also, yelp gives this place $$, but customers would have better expectations if it were $$$. Sure, we weren't planning on spending $50 for a normal lunch but can't say I regret. I'm a pretty big guy and I eat a lot. I can honestly say this filled me up. The waiters were attentive and nice. It wasn't busy there so that could be why but had a very nice experience overall. I think when I came last there was a lunch menu but o well. Overall very good. If the entrees were more in line with other places $13-$15 range, it would be a solid 5 stars. But then again Indian food is expensive in general and I can't really complain about the price a business charges.

I dropped in for a work lunch with a couple of coworkers, and I was quite impressed with the interior design, table arrangements, AND the food. The table we got was cloaked in white linen, with blue fabric napkins, arranged utensils, water glasses, and four wooden chairs with blue, velvety cushions. The intimate dining area reminded me of an upscale, nautical restaurant, but with an abundance of copper hues, glowing \"sun\" lights, and dangling blue \"lanterns\" along the wall-lined booths.I ordered the Tikka Masala with lamb and chicken (combination $13), with naan, rice, and the soup of the day. The soup returned 5 minutes later. It was some sort of veggie bisque, but I found it to be a bit too thick -- as well as hard to eat with a normally-sized spoon. Our entrees were delivered 10 minutes later. My square plate was topped with a tastefully-lopsided bowl of creamy tomato-fenugreek sauce, with juicy slices of chicken & lamb, white rice, and puffy, butter-glazed naan. If I had not been in the company of others, I would have tipped my bowl directly in my mouth and DRANK the sauce. Even a coworker decided he wanted an extra side of the tikka masala sauce for his salmon dish... HahahaAll and all, this place is a great bang for your buck and a perfect spot for an intimate lunch with your boo.

The interior was cool and dark, perfect for a hot evening. \u00a0The decor was very nice, my son loved the lighting. \u00a0We got a rounded booth which was great because the 3 of us could all sit together.We started with some paneer pakora and assorted naan for appetizers. \u00a0The naan also came with some raita which I used once the entrees came out. \u00a0The paneer pakora was decent, but I think the sauce was the best part of this dish. \u00a0The naan was good too, but I think in the future we'll just get the garlic naan. \u00a0The other 2 weren't as good. \u00a0We also each got a mango lassi. \u00a0The mango lassis here are very yogurty in flavor, not very sweet, which I think is good when going with the meal. \u00a0I don't like mango lassis that taste like fruit smoothies loaded up with sugar.I ordered the chicken tikka masala. \u00a0I usually prefer paneer, but they didn't offer that as a choice with masala sauce. \u00a0The chicken was good anyhow. \u00a0I had read other reviews indicating the dishes here were disappointingly bland, so I had ordered mine \"spicy\". \u00a0Well, I wasn't disappointed. \u00a0I drank all my lassi and needed all the raita to keep from burning up, it was great. \u00a0I also had more than enough leftovers for my next 2 meals.My husband got the lamb vindaloo, his favorite dish, also \"spicy\". \u00a0He was pretty impressed by how much it made him sweat. \u00a0He said it had a good flavor and the meat was good quality, but maybe next time he wouldn't get it quite so spicy.Overall I thought the food here was pretty good. \u00a0The service was excellent, I don't think our water glasses were even allowed to get halfway empty before they were filled back up again. \u00a0But since it was a bit pricier than other Indian restaurants in the area, I'm not sure if we'll be coming back too much. \u00a0The cost was $17 for each of the entrees, $9 for the 3 mango lassis, $9 for the naan and $7 for the paneer pakora. \u00a0It does have the convenience factor of being right off 540 near RTP and the airport, but if you've ever tried getting in and out of Brier Creek during rush hour, you know it's not so convenient all the time."], ["Suzanne C.", "While in town for business, this place was recommended. \u00a0the venue itself was lovely and the service was impeccable. \u00a0they had a solid wine selection which is often unusual in Indian restaurants in prior experience. \u00a0The food was very delicious...as a group of three, we shared a few apps--the Gobhi Manchurian was amazing!

I'm sorry.I've been here for dinner about three times over the last couple years. It was one of the first Indian restaurants I tried in the Triangle.Service has always been great for me at Azitra, but the food is severely toned down and lacking flavor. I usually order \"medium\" at Indian restaurants, but it seems that even a \"hot\" here will get you a chicken curry with a spice-less pasta-like sauce. Even my favorites, chicken tikka masala and biryani struck out at the plate. Usually, biryani hits a solid double, and chicken tikka masala knocks a clutch 2-run homer. Fortunately, the Azitra garlic naan was nice and fluffy--it did a great job at soaking up sauce.Azitra is also a tad pricier than competition in the area (Zayka and Kadhai) and it has a more upscale feel inside. If you do look around, you'll notice a lack of Indians eating there. One of my Indian coworkers always told me that Azitra was \"too Americanized\".My love for Indian food (especially Northern) and the great location will probably bring me back to Azitra at some point.

It is a very classy, upscale restaurant tucked in the corner of the shops in Brier Creek. Even the bathrooms were fancy! Because I was alone I made my way to the bar to be accompanied by another lone-star, and the bartender too. She greeted me with a smile and asked me for a drink. I asked her to recommend me a beer on tap. I ordered the Garlic Naan too. Now, I have to inform you that I now have the privilege of being allergic to tomatoes and peanuts. (Not so fun) So as I am looking through the menu I am slowly scratching off items. Who seemed to be the owner or part of the family owned walked over to the bar. I waved him down to recommend me something. I let him know I was a fan of curry dishes. He went ahead and made an order for me and I was quite excited. As I was ready to dig into my dish I realized there was a tomato! :( I patiently waited to tell him because it really wasn't a big deal but I just couldn't eat it. He repeatedly apologized and say he would immediately change it. He finally came back and personally delivered the new dish. He stated that what he made was not even on the menu and was made especially for me. He also apologized sincerely again and reassured me that there were no tomatoes or peanuts.

I must have tried half a dozen items in the menu and not one has disappointed. New customers who are not into hot dishes should, however, ask the waiter first before ordering, as they might find a few items beyond what they can take. But I love the food here so much I dine in and take out maybe five times a week. Service is quick and friendly. The decor and ambience are classy and elegant. And the prices are unbelievably low considering the quality of the food. Whenever I have guests from out of town, the first restaurant I take them to is always Azitra."], ["Matt E.", "Azitra is a must-have dinner for me any time I am in the area. I absolutely love it.My go-to orders are: shahi paneer, lamb rogan josh, chicken kadhai, salmon makhani, and/or chana masala. And I *always* get a side of the peshwari naan (OMG SO GOOD) and raita. If you order any or all of those, I can guarantee you that you'll love your meal.The shahi paneer explodes with spice and a combination of rich buttery and savory tomato flavor. The lamb rogan josh is best served very spicy, as its sauce has a dark, smokey flavor. The chicken kadhai offers crisp veggies complementing tender chicken, all rubbed in a red peppery spice. The salmon makhani tends to leave you wanting a bit more meat, but the butter sauce makes the fish melt in your mouth. The chana masala is a simpler dish, but I've always appreciated the unique flavor they give through apt use of (what seems to be) Myrtle family spices.Finally, the peshwari naan is an absolute MUST as a side order. Cooked to perfection with a crusty outside and softer, chewy inside and filled with cherries, this naan and raita offer a wonderful counter to and reprieve from any hot dish you might order.The spice levels are good when you ask for medium. My fiancee doesn't like spicy food, and this is always fine for her. I, however, *love* spiciness and always get a side of pepper sauce when I go with her. If I go by myself, I order it hot or Indian hot, and I will tell you that the latter will definitely leave you sweating!So after all this, why only four stars? As others have mentioned, it is indeed a bit pricey. I'll first say that you can get out for pretty cheap if you only do a vegetarian dish and rice with water (under $15, including tip). But as the above shows, I always go all-out: three dishes, a few sides, and a mango lassi. I wish the meat dishes were $12-13 instead of $16-17, but I do feel that the portions are generous and the taste fantastic. We get out for around $70 with our generally-massive order, but we also always have enough for 2 meals worth of leftovers if we order that much. And the leftovers reheat incredibly well. For a nice dinner out, I'll take it!Others have noted inconsistency in their meals between visits. An important note here is that over the last year or so, Azitra underwent a change of its head chef. That's a pretty big deal. I can attest to the temporary differences and inconsistencies during this transition (even a slight drop in quality), but as of my last visit a few weeks ago, the quality has returned to excellent."], ["Eddie H.", "The food here is pretty good Indian cuisine.

You need a good doctor, a reliable mechanic, and - most importantly - a quality Indian buffet. When I moved to Cary back in 2002 I ran through the buffet circuit on the regular. That is, until I found myself at Udupi. Let's just say this place put a ring on it because I don't find myself stepping out to other Indian buffets all that often. In fact, for the last 13 years I have made a concerted effort to eat the lunch buffet once a week (sometimes twice). If I go an extended period without enjoying Udupi, I'm a pain in the ass to be around. Even now that I live in Raleigh, I make the 20 minute drive most weeks and am rarely less than satisfied.So, in an area with a multitude of Indian establishments, what makes Udupi so special? For me, it comes down to a few details. First is the freshness. Sometimes I've had to examine my fork because I was certain there was a little curry chef sitting on the end making eat tasty bite as the fork entered my mouth. Second is the quality. Ever notice how some buffets offer condiments like tamarind sauce and raita that are thin and watery? Not at Udupi. The stuff is thick and viscous and, if they're paying attention to these little details, you can be sure the rest of the food delivers. Third is because it's all vegetarian. While this might not be a selling point for a lot of people, it's huge for me because I know I can eat anything and everything. Plus, I've taken numerous meat eaters to Udupi and, to a person, they think it is hands down some of the best Indian food they've had. Also of note is the super-friendly staff, but, honestly, they could punch me in the nose every time I walk in the door and I'd still probably be coming back - \u00a0I just might not tip as much."], ["Sai K.", "We are from south India and were looking for authentic South Indian food.

After the family in front of us went through, the guy stood there and shut the door in my wife's face.

I also feel that they heavily push appetizers and I feel uncomfortable if I say no and only want an entree. Lastly, when I ask about certain foods containing allergies the waiters end up recommending food that contains the allergy - I even was served a dish with the allergen I asked not to have.I believe that the people at Udupi have a good heart and they do put love and attention into their food. For me, this is a living example that it doesn't matter how good your product is, if you can't communicate with your customer you will lose the sale. With more than one attempt, I cannot 'chance' this place anymore."], ["Shilpi S.", "We have only always tried Buffet and its a hit with me and my husband always. Perfect South Indian Flavors and price is decent for a good layout of food they have in buffet.The only disappointment is the place is not as clean as a restaurant should be.

The service is good and the staff and owner/manager come around and ask everyone on the food and to take further orders."], ["Shalini S.", "We walked to the restaurant an realized it was closed.

I went here when visiting a friend in Cary. I live in Boston, where there are many tasty non-vegetarian and vegetarian Indian restaurants that I have been to, so I did not have particularly high expectations. I WAS WRONG. We went on Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, and the place was full of little kids (so much kiddy noise, but not the restaurant's fault). We got the buffet, and there were these metal trays like old school lunch trays to put the food in. I loved everything - every single thing - on the buffet. I've never had beets or green beans at an Indian restaurant before, and my friend has never willingly eaten a green bean before, but both were delicious. Not only that, but sometimes, Indian dishes start to all taste the same after a while, especially on the buffet. No so here - each dish had its own symphony of flavors. Whole Indian eggplants, paneer, chickpeas, etc, all used smartly. Nothing particularly spicy. The waiter came over and I said, \"this is the best Indian food I've ever eaten\" Then I saw he was holding a plate of dosas. He said, \"Do you want these?\" I almost cried. Then I solemnly nodded my assent. The only thing I would have wanted is a few different desserts. There were three - carrot halwa and two vermicelli dishes that were pretty similar. I loved them all, but there are so many other fabulous Indian desserts I missed. Very good price, too! I can't wait to visit my friend again!"], ["Michelle G.", "Went here for lunch. I was worried because being the hungry a-hole I am, my pops and I arrived about 20 minutes before they closed up shop to prep for the dinner hours. They have a buffet during lunch (normally not a fan of a buffet, hence the 4 stars instead of 5)--both salad and hot grub--and the flavors of each dish was enticing, as one would hope of Southern Indian cuisine. Vegetarians will happily swoon over every option (there's no meat here). I loved the chana masala and generous use of chickpeas, cauliflower, potatoes, rice varieties and soup! Vegans, you'll find plenty here. However, beware of the yogurt used in certain recipes. Just ask someone who works there (coconut milk is great, isn't it?). Walking in so close to closing, I didn't expect friendly service. Quite the contrary; our waiter begged us to have dessert before they closed the buffet and brought me a mango lassi even though we graciously declined the offer. Interior is dark in an appealing way. Ethnic feel. Outdoor seating, yes, but not much. Cheers!"], ["E Alexander G.", "Just had a wonderful lunch at Udupi Cafe, taking advantage of the buffet. If you love South Indian food, then you are in for a treat. Idli (Idlly), Dal, onion pakora, and great Sambal are the stars.

Everything is vegetarian and spicy, so don't expect anything else and you will be well pleased!"], ["Madhava Krishna M.", "Being an Indian vegetarian family, we went to this restaurant last night. It was a Monday and it is unusual for this restaurant to be open. We had ordered all the basic south Indian food (Idli, Dosa, Ootappam and Vada). To our surprise, we could clearly make it that the chef was a part-timer or gone out of his/her mind. I had never tasted such a horrible food in my entire life. Pathetically, the sambar (soup) was just a mixture of hot water and some all purpose flour with some spices. A serving person (female) had swapped someone's food with mine and later requests me not to inform the manager there. Overall, I have decided not to visit this restaurant unless there is big rush hour. My point here is, that the restaurant people have taken me for a ride just because, it was a Monday and no Indian restaurant is open on a Monday. I have decided that I should not afford $75 for a four person family for this horrible food."], ["Leo J.", "Decent food. Service was awful.

We started with an appetizer sampler that came out with chile and coconut chutney and two other sauces for the pakoras, samosas and vadas. Everything was fresh and piping hot. Great flavors.For our entrees we tried something a little different; a dosai. Like a lot of people, we're more familiar with northern Indian cuisine and some of the southern specialties are new. The Hyderabad Dosai arrived rolled up and hanging considerably off the plate on both sides looking like a crisp, toasted pillow. I had a few bites and my partner devoured the rest saying it hit the spot perfectly. Apparently, most of the other diners thought so, too, as I saw over a dozen served while we were there.I went with the more familiar Palak Paneer, an old stand by. Their version was amazing, creamy and perfect, I've never had better. This was pure comfort food with solidly packed paneer; great texture.On top of the great food, service was friendly and impeccable.

For the entree I got the Jaipur paneer dosai and my husband got the butter masala dosai. \u00a0When they came out I was amazed by how huge they were, but in reality the \"pancake\" is mostly hollow. \u00a0There's just a small area in the middle where they filled it with paneer, peas, and the rest of the filling. \u00a0It was very, very good, but messy to eat and we weren't given nearly enough napkins. \u00a0I was also turned off when the waiter decided to fill my water glass with the end of the jug directly over my plate, dripping water on my nice, crispy dosai. My husband was very impressed with the size of his butter masala dosai. \u00a0It was so huge it went off the plate, and those were big plates. \u00a0Again only a small section in the middle was filled, but that's to be expected.The prices here were good for the dosai, only $7.49 for the butter masala and $8.99 for the Jaipur paneer. \u00a0But I thought that $3.50 a piece for the mango lassi was a bit much (they're always so small) and $7.99 for the appetizers was also high considering the prices of the entrees. \u00a0The food was all very good, and I will definitely be picking up some take-out dosai here in the future. \u00a0But I really didn't like the service, and I'd rather not eat in here again."], ["Lynn H.", "I'm glad I didn't listen to the negative reviews when I was looking for an Indian restaurant yesterday. \u00a0We went to the lunch buffet and everything was delicious. \u00a0This was truly the best South Indian food I have had - complex spicing, layers of flavor. \u00a0I will have to try the dinner menu which I'm sure is even better than the buffet.

The spicy tomato soup is a winner, with some real heat behind it and some yogurt mixed in the give it some creaminess. Even with the considerable spiciness, the primary flavor is still the freshness of the tomatoes coming through. I also had the tandoori lamb with roasted vegetables and potatoes in an mango-ginger sauce. The dish was very successful, especially since the roasted bell peppers, carrots, zucchini and onion still had some crispness. Their garlic naan is just average--didn't get the rich garlic taste I've had at other local Indian places. The cocktails were well-made and the service was fine.

We got the chicken jhalfrezi with a side of garlic naan for our main course. And for dessert, we got a sampler platter which had gulab jamen, some kind of fruit ice cream, and an apple dessert. The jhalfrazi was delicious and perfectly seasonsed, and the naan was perfect. Crispy, buttery and garlicky...I could've eaten a couple of baskets of just the bread by itself!So what's the problem? First off, the price-to-portion-size ratio is WAY off, in my opinion. I'm used to the portions at Indian restaurants being generous, and usually one entree is the perfect amount to split between two people. Upon seeing that the average price for a chicken entree was in the $17-$20 range, we asked the server if he thought we could split one between the two of us. He said yes, with the addition of the rice and a side of naan, it would be fine. When the food arrived, we were shocked at how little of it there was. It was served in a fairly large dish, but it was mostly full of sauce, and had very few chunks of chicken in it. The naan, which costs something around four dollars, was four small triangles in a tiny basket. And what's more, we were only brought one medium-sized dish of rice FOR THE TABLE. Our friends, who also ordered an entree to split, had to share the rice with us, and it was barely enough for four people. We all left hungry.In my opinion, a basic chicken entree with some spices thrown on it shouldn't cost $20 to begin with, but if it does I at least want it to be a decent-sized portion of food. Maybe I'm just not bourgeois enough to be able to appreciate spending a lot of money for a tiny amount of food. I mean unless it's at a super swanky place for a special occasion. But in my opinion, Blue Mango wasn't quite swanky enough to be able to pull that off.Then there was the issue of the service. I felt really bad for our server, because it seemed like he was trying, and he was genuinely sorry for the mistakes, but so many things went wrong with our meal. My husband ordered a drink, which never arrived. They brought us out the chicken tikka masala instead of the chicken jhalfrezi at first, and we had to wait for it to be fixed. Our friends ordered a dessert at the same time we did, but it never arrived, then they were still charged for it on the bill.Anyway, I think with a few tweaks Blue Mango could be great, but it isn't quite there yet."], ["Anna S.", "The food was good, but too hot. I asked for a 2 and got something like a 4 (they do spiciness on a 1 - 5 scale). I eat Indian food often, so I know how spicy it can get.

The chef even came by our table to ask how everything was and we kindly said that the dish had pretty much no spice.

If you're not familiar with Indian food or are scared of the spice, the staff can help you through it. \u00a0And practically any dish can be made with no or lots of spice. I don't understand the reviews about small portions unless you're just a huge eater. Between the appetizers, the rice, the naan, and what Iconsider an appropriate portion, I've always left satisfied. One trick (at least this happened to me while eating at the bar - Brandon was bartender/server), yes, the have a 1 - 5 spice scale, but I order mine \"Indian hot.\". I like very spicy food, and this pushes my limits - a good thing. I tried Mantra the other night and was very disappointed.

I was, however, accompanied by my dear friend who happens to be Indian & knows the cuisine.My first visit was for dinner & we decided to order several dishes to share. First up, Samosa Chat. I have to say this vegetarian dish was my favorite of all we tasted - perfectly spiced and positively mouthwatering. The Chicken Tikka Masala was solid, great flavor and again perfectly spiced. Our last dish was the Vegetable Jalfrezi. It was good but tasted like stir-fried vegetables from the local Chinese take-out, without the Chinese take-out price. Yes, if you eat here for dinner, be prepared to pay. I should mention that the fresh naan alone is worth the price of admission. For dessert, we tried the Gulab Jamun... syrup-coated balls of milk with a hint of rose. Not my type of dessert personally, but good for what it was. In all it was a great, if pricey, meal.Earlier this week I returned to try the lunch buffet. For only $9.99, it's quite affordable (and popular with the RTP crowd, as evidenced by the many groups we saw file in). The buffet had a large variety of dishes available. I enjoyed the Chicken Tikka Masala again and tasted a couple of Dal dishes, both which were excellent. The only item I disliked was the Tandoori Chicken which was very dry. Gulab Jamun were available for those who wanted dessert (I passed), and each table was given a basket of fresh naan with the meal.Having arrived before most of the lunch rush, I'm not sure how frequently the buffet is refreshed, but everything was fully available when we went through the line.

We love the Himalayan restaurant next door as well, but eating there is a process and we can't always be gone for a hour+ for lunch. The Tibetan restaurant was fantastic! We had the spicy chicken appetizer which was phenomenal, and even though it was hot we both had butter tea which was perfectly prepared. I had a vegetarian lunch plate. I wasn't overly excited about the potato momos, but that was my fault; I love the lamb and just wasn't thinking veggie would be potato. However that aside, they were delicious, soft and moist - perfectly made! The rest of my lunch sampler was amazing, and my friend devoured his plate (a meat dish). Everyone was so kind, and I loved the homey feel. For others that have rated the restaurant low, I think maybe your expectations for this type of food and environment are just not in line with what it is. The \"tattered white scarf on the door\" someone complained about- that's a Tibetan tradition of offering/welcome so I'm very happy to see it there. My only complaint was that the restaurant inside was VERY (uncomfortably) hot. If I had to guess, it was close to 80 F. We keep our thermostats around 75-77 so I don't expect a 66-degree place, but it was really warm, and the water is served room temp (which I usually would prefer, but we were melting!). That could have been a temporary issue though.

She seemed annoyed at any request to find out more for mission about the food and/or her suggestions. When I asked about a certain soup she simply repeated the description on the menu, I further pursued and asked for more for info or if she could find out from the chef a better description, she rolled her eyes and sulked away returning with the same description as before. Extremely rude. She would only approach our table when she felt it convenient or finished playing her candy crush iphone game. You think in a rush wrong with foreign a half stars on yelp and about $20 per person to eat there, there would be some kind of enthusiasm or fondness for serving the community.

They did have a nice selection of condiments to spice things up. The chicken tikka masala was my favorite hot dish and we were blown away by how hot, fresh and delicious the naan was - we both agreed that was the star!I wouldn't return on the weekend for $11.95, but maybe during the week when the buffet is $8.95 - that seems like a much more appropriate price. Overall I enjoyed it and left full, but wasn't super excited about this new addition to Hboro St."], ["E Alexander G.", "This evening was my third visit to Kabab and Curry, and it has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants in Raleigh. My previous two visits were enjoying the lunch buffet, and this evening the first time having their Rani Thali, which is like a buffet on a plate!The servings of individual vegetable dishes were superb, and the rice and Naan excellent. I opted for medium spice, which was perfect, and nice to have dessert of the day included... Just enough to tempt me into bringing an extra serving home with me to accompany my left overs. Their Masala Chai is also fantastic. Spiced to perfection, and not pre-sweetened so you can adjust easier to your individual taste. Service was pleasant and several people came by to check and make sure all was to my liking. Definitely recommended."], ["Lauren R.", "I dropped in for dinner one night, and the inside was nicer than I expected. \u00a0Nice, sit-down restaurant, white table cloths, etc. \u00a0I was surprised that around 10 on a Thursday night, the place was about half full--there were several large groups finishing up dinner (and most of them appeared to be Indian, always a good sign).I headed towards the back to place a takeout order--half tandoori chicken and Peshawari naan. \u00a0While I waited, the bartender gave me a glass of mango lassi, which was delicious--definitely the best part of my meal. \u00a0The tandoori chicken was good, and it came with a TON of white rice (way more than I could eat). \u00a0The Peshwari naan--a type of naan I'd never had before--was sweet and tasty. \u00a0Overall, the food was good, and the service was great. \u00a0My takeout order was close to $20, after tax and a small tip, and while the food was good, I think the buffet may be the better option value-wise. \u00a0I'm between three and four stars, but rounded up because of the friendly service (and excellent lassi)."], ["Athena L.", "This place is amazing. \u00a0I'm a vegetarian and the selection of options I could choose from was impressive. \u00a0In addition, everything on the menu that I sampled was delicious. \u00a0The service was outstanding and friendly. \u00a0Overall, a really great experience. \u00a0I can't wait to go back the next time I'm in town."], ["Elise W.", "The sign advertising Nepalese food piqued my interest when walking by. Figured I should pop in and see what culinary delights Kebab and Curry had to offer. The staff were beyond friendly making conversation and making sure the naan and drinks were constantly refilled. Since it was lunch time they had a buffet for about $12 a person. Rather good buffet with several chicken options, goat, and a few veggies. Really wish they had some Saag Paneer on the buffet and maybe a few more veggie options. Overall not a bad choice, wish they had a few more exotic options."], ["Patrick Z.", "First of all, I've had Indian food three times in my life - once at a Hare Krishna pay-what-you-want restaurant in Prague, a buffet in New Bern, NC, and now Kabab and Curry. What I'm saying is that I am in no way an expert on this kind of food.That said, this was fan-fucking-tastic. Admittedly, the service wasn't great (why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5). Our waiter, who seemed like he may have been the boss, was not particularly friendly. It may have been because we told him we had a Groupon when we first sat down, I'm not sure. The rest of the staff was incredibly nice and helpful. The food, though...it was the best Indian food I've had yet. My wife also agreed and she's has way more Indian-food-eating experience than I do. So take that for what it's worth.I got the chicken tikka masala, which was awesome. Creamy, a little buttery (is that the word I'm looking for?), it was spiced perfectly (medium), and it had huge chunks for chicken. The rice was rice, but it was hot and it was good. The garlic naan...fantastic. And huge.My wife got the chana saag and loved it. She also got garlic naan and loved that as well.So yeah, we'll have to go back to do the buffet in order to get a better sense of the rest of their food, but what we had was amazing.As an aside, here's a kind of funny story: So they give you these thin, crispy pita-looking things. I don't know what they're called. They're basically the Indian restaurant equivalent of the free tortilla chips you get at a Mexican place. I thought that was the naan and I was super pissed when the waiter brought that out. That would've been an incredible waste of $8. The sauces they give you were great, so that helped my sour mood, but I was still pretty pissed.But then they brought out the real naan with our dinner and it was awesome. I was much happier."], ["Emily J.", "I got the food from Kabab and Curry delivered and was very pleased. Awesome Naan bread! Really yummy flavors and perfectly cooked rice. I would definitely order the Chicken Tikki Masala again, but definitely want to order one of the array of dishes they offer."], ["Ankur S.", "As an Indian and a foodie I approve of the taste and quality of food at this place.The food was well prepared and the good thing is that they had different levels of \"hot\" which I believe gives everyone options as per their choice.The only downside was that some of the recipes were not as authentic as you would like them to be but I wouldnt say thats a big downside."], ["Jasleen K.", "The food is good but the service sucks. It was twice that we found that the waiter did not add up the check properly and overcharged us. Also, he was reluctant to deduct that amount demanding us to give it off as tip. In another instance, he took 20-25 minutes to get us breads and the reason he gave was that he had forgotten to inform the kitchen. The 2 stars that I've given is only for food quality. But I am never going to that place again. Biryani house in Cary is better."], ["Ryan B.", "Absolutely fantastic lunch option right across the street from campus. Went with a few faculty colleagues and we all had the lunch buffet. \u00a0Despite everyone having a different appreciation for Indian food, as completely different palates and tastes, there was something for everyone. \u00a0The chicken dishes especially were so full of flavor, and the five different sauces really made for some good mixes between spicy and savory. Didn't have a chance to try the rice pudding, but will try that next time."], ["Anthony M.", "Wow. \u00a0 A shocking jewel in the middle of nowhere, with fantastic food, avocado shakes, and excellent service and people. \u00a0You will not be able to discern this by looking at the external building. \u00a0Go inside and have a fantastic meal."], ["Ian M.", "This place has an excellent lunch buffet! It isn't too expensive, the food is great, the atmosphere was nice, and the service was nice as well! They had different types of traditional Indian chicken and sides, so it wasn't novel in any sense, but great if you are in the mood for Indian!"], ["Moe H.", "After spending a week in Boston for a conference and eating some of the finest Italian and Irish food, my wife and I were craving Indian. \u00a0We had eaten here once before so decided to come back tonight. Tandoori chicken came sizzling on a hot plate. It was delicious. We ordered lamb saag and naans. Again, were very pleased. Anyone looking for good Indian food, will find this, probably the best in the Triangle."], ["VC K.", "This review is about the starters only. My wife and I have had street food at a lot of different places in the city but I would have to say K & C's did not excite us much. We tried the Samosa chat which was average. The different ingredients were not broken/ crushed down well. They were large and bulky but the taste was alright. The other one we tried was Dahi Papdi chat which was far from decent. The taste was bland and the yogurt taste was overwhelming. They don't have as many options for appetizers that one would hope.They have a good ambience and we will go to try the entr\u00e9es but not the appetizers again probably."], ["Atul M.", "Good food. The buffet was excellent, although there was not much variety in the menu.

I dont know what happened, but suddenly the quality has gone way up. the owner is a fantastic person as well. this is super delicious i'm very happy right now!! not much else to say! the boti goat is really good if you ask for it hot spice level."], ["Angela C.", "My husband and I are huge fans of Indian food and make it a point to find the best Indian Cuisine at every duty location we find ourselves at, so when I found a Groupon for this particular restaurant I was thrilled. The yelp reviews were great and I couldn't wait. Upon arriving the restaurant was cute and the staff was more than friendly. We ordered appetizers, entrees and dessert as well as wine. We ordered the samosas dor an appetizer and they were delicious. With only a few bites left is when I found the hair neatly cooked into the folds of the pastry. I could actually lift up what was left of my samosa by the hair. I am not one to get overly excited at things like this so I just asked for another one which they immediately brought to the table. The entrees were next with enough fire and spice to bring tears to my husband's eyes. I have to admit though that they overdo it with the potatoes. Then came dessert. Oh my word I have never tasted anything as delicious as their rice pudding mixed with rose water. Maybe it was the way it cooled off my tongue that was engulfed in flames, but it was incredible. All in all a delicious meal. The bill came next and I noticed that they didn't charge me for the dessert ($2.99). I thought this was a gesture for the hair that had come with the appetizer and I was thoroughly pleased with that resolution. When they ran my credit card and brought it back I saw the adjustment of the dessert being added. They had swiped my card twice resulting in two separate charges and the funds were of course held for three days as \"pending\". This was not a big deal, but I was disappointed that they had not made any compensation for the hair after I thought that they had. Despite the hair and the issue with the credit card, I will return to this establishment. I can't wait to try their lunch buffet."], ["Raj Y.", "I moved to NC from NYC. I know my Indian food. I went for dinner. The ambience is pleasant. Staffs were welcoming. The menu has plenty of good item to choose from. I wanted to teste little bit of everything so went with Raja thali. Its had couple of curry, nan, starter pickle etc. To start the appetizer the tandoori chicken and chicken mali tikka was delicious. Have not had better Indian food in the area. \u00a0What blew me away was goat curry. Very well cooked very tender very delicious. Fantastic preparation great taste and perfect spice. I would give 5 start for that. I was visiting Raleigh. I am sure I am going there on my next trip and will certainly bring my friends along. Great job Keep it up."], ["Amanda A.", "My husband and I went there for the lunch buffet. \u00a0We both love Indian so were excited to try a new place. \u00a0Bad:Dark - for lunch time it would have been nice to have a little light.Bathroom was not clean and they had a bottle of toilet bowl cleaner sitting on the back of the toilet.Service was not good. \u00a0Staff was not friendly. \u00a0No greeting and no smiles.No one told us bread was coming but I assumed it should since there was none of the buffet. \u00a0After we were over half was through with our meal I asked for some and the lady said \"it is coming\" like I was bothering her. \u00a0When she brought the check she did not say she would be back to pick it up or to go pay somewhere. \u00a0Nothing. \u00a0No communication especially a \"thank you\".The labels on the food were only the names of the dishes and in Indian. \u00a0I could look at see what was in the dishes but it would have been nice to have a description. \u00a0At least let us know if the dish was vegetarian.No flavor. \u00a0Everything was really bland. \u00a0Nothing stood out or had kick to it. \u00a0 It was just bla.The yogurt dip was like water. \u00a0The tamarind sauce was thick and sticky. \u00a0The colorless salad had more chunks of lemon in it than anything else. \u00a0For dessert they only had rice pudding and the only flavor notes in it were \"sweet\" and it was runny. \u00a0No honey balls and that should be expected at an Indian buffet.Not much of a selection and that would not have been much of an issue if the food was really good.Good:The price for the buffet was only $8.95 (weekday) so if you just want to fill up on food I guess it is worth it. \u00a0We won't be going back as it was really not good and the staff was not nice (especially the woman who looked downright miserable).This should go without saying and not their fault but the parking was terrible and I even got a parking ticket as I thought I finally found a spot. \u00a0Not their fault about the parking, but just be aware especially if you are driving there at lunchtime."], ["Stephanie T.", "I've got high hopes for Hillsborough Street even amongst all the boarded up city staples we are seeing there right now and the constant name changes on locations that just can't seem to stick.Kabab and Curry is located in Frazier's location so it's not the biggest restaurant ever, shotgun style with the bar in the back, pretty perfect layout for a lunch buffet really. That being said, if you have more than 6 in your party you should call them with a heads up (you should always do this, no matter what restaurant, but here definitely.)We went on day 10 of them being open for the $9 weekday lunch buffet that is served until 3:00. We left ab.so.lute.ly. STUFFED. The number of items on the buffet is very similar to that of Royal India on Capital Blvd, with about half being vegetable based and the others meat based. Items I recall being there were mattar masala, chaana masala, veggie pakoras, veggie korma, saag, chicken jalfrezi, butter chicken, coconut rice and plain rice, tandoori chicken, and of course all your condiments like mint, mango, onion, tamarind chutneys etc. Fresh super hot naan was brought to the table as well.All of the buffet items were very good, there was nothing there that seemed to stand out over the others. The tandoori chicken was cooked perfectly, not dried out and a generous size drumstick. There was a good spice presence in the items with none of them being overwhelming. Everything looks freshly prepared, not swimming in oils, and my only suggestion would to see about attempting to keep the dishes a bit warmer in temperature. Of course, this was the apocalyptic frigid snow day of 2014 and a sterno candle under the buffet dish can only do so much. Nothing was cold, maybe a stir here and there would be sufficient, alas they were busy.Their dinner menu looks wonderful and I am so excited to go back to get some Nepalese Momos after spending some quality time in that country a few years ago. There were just a couple little spotty service aspects but they have only been open a little over a week and for a snow day the place was bumping with more folks waiting at the door to be seated. I'll cut them a break, we left full and super happy, and it wasn't nearly as defeating as two inches of snow can be in North Carolina."], ["Candace C.", "Surprisingly, they don't have lunch buffet today.

I was somewhat skeptical, as it's located on a strip of Hillsborough Street right by NC State that would seem to cater to college tastes, but I was actually very, very pleasantly surprised. Both times I went during lunch and got the buffet, which is very reasonably priced at $8.99 on weekdays and $10.99 on Fridays and weekends. The buffet offers a plethora of options, including fresh salad with various vegetables and dressings, fresh-cut fruit, white rice, samosas, and several entree-like items, such as chicken tikka masala, daal, curry, aloo gobi, and more. I'm sure these items shift around a bit, but I was happy to see both meat and vegetarian options both times I went, with plenty to choose from. I sampled a bit of everything, and in particular loved the chicken tikka masala and the aloo gobi. The masala sauce was one of the best I've tried, and the chicken was perfectly cooked. They'll also ask if you want regular or garlic naan brought to your table - both are great, but you want the garlic. One of the best naans I have had - so fresh and hot, slightly crispy on the outside but soft inside, and the addition of garlic is fantastic. Wonderful service, too. For the price, you cannot beat the lunch buffet!

First off, let me say I am extremely critical of Indian/Nepalese food because I have high standards after living in Nepal for a month. This was THE BEST food i've had since I was there. For one, MoMo's are nearly impossible to find outside of Nepal. These were spot on! I had the chicken & the vegetable - the veg were my favorite. I had a Rani Thalis (vegetarian) and it was amazing and MASSIVE!! He had the Lamb Vindaloo and loved it. He was warned it was very hot & while he likes his food CRAZY hot - he agreed it was hot! I ordered mine the regular spicy and it was very flavorful with a good kick but not too much by any means. If you like spicy food, \"hot\" is safe here!

DELISH considering i didn't know anything i was eating (meaning I'm not educated in Indian food besides curry). Nice little spot for something casual or nicer. Service wasn't exciting but the waiters were on standby for anything you needed. My only thing was that the overall experience was quiet. Maybe a little music or turn the Bollywood channel up. Also the bathroom was what turned me off about the place. A napkin dispenser, automatic air freshener would have given this place a 5 star. At least they had foaming soap.

Their lunch buffet is very reasonably priced and wasn't as large (read confusing) as some others I've been to. But more importantly, both times, every dish was delicious, carefully made and perfectly flavored. The pakodas were freshly made, and nothing was overly greasy. They had some really good channa-dal masala (not the same as channa masala) which is something I haven't seen any restaurants here offer. The naan at our table was soft and fresh, and not to forget, abundant. Service was eager and extremely enthusiastic, and while it was a tad slow to start with, it is completely forgivable given that they just opened.

I ordered a vegetarian \"combo\" dish (called rani thali). It had 4 \"small\" portions of vegetarian dishes, raita, naan, rice, and a serving of a popular desert. The food was great. They asked what level of spice I wanted and when I said \"somewhere between mild and medium\", I was happy with the spiciness (they probably make it more mild for the lunch buffet to suit all tastes). The rani thali was more than one person can eat in one sitting. The staff was very nice and wanted to make sure I was enjoying my experience and my food, but we're polite and very unobtrusive. After just my first trip, I'm definitely going back. I'm gonna give it a try with some colleagues for the lunch buffet (which I think will do very well during the school year, given the location).
