It was very fresh and the staff was exceptionally friendly, as well as professional. We started off with the Edamame, for an appetizer, which was very tasty and fulfilling; not too salty and it keeps you chewing. Then, \u00a0for the main course we split the Vietnamese Pho. The waiter encouraged us to get more, but we felt it was the perfect size to split. We both left full. The Vietnamese Pho was so yummy, particulate with the meat and mint in it. The condiments that they give you compliment the bowl very well, and I used it all since I like spicy.Would definition recommend giving this place a try, if you are looking for something alittle different and fresh. Seems like a good spot for a date night as well.I'm certainly be back to try more in the future."], ["Sandy N.", "Their menu changes a lot. I wasn't a fan of their Korean Beef or their inspired Vietnamese Noodle Salad. The server was great in letting me get something else when I found out the Noodle Salad was just noodles in a cold broth. The noodles were harder than I expected as well. The Filipino Halo-Halo is so worth it! Creamy, crunchy and yummy without being super sweet!"], ["Sara C.", "What originally drew me to Buku was seeing a photo of their seasonal arepa dish on Yelp. Even though, as I came to find out, that they do not have arepas anymore, they still have a lot other great food to choose from.Came here on a Sunday night. It was most likely emptier than usual since the North Carolina State Fair was in town. Wanting to balance out my dinner, I decided to get a Ginger Pear Salad and their Baja Crab Flautas.The salad was really good - a healthy amount of dressing and plenty of fresh toppings including pears, almonds, edamame and carrots. The flautas were also pretty good, but I expected more. It was pretty much crab and cream cheese - I expected a little more of something, but it was still tasty.If you're in Raleigh and find yourself with Asian food cravings, swing by Buku!"], ["Traci R.", "My best friend hosted her bridal shower at Buku this weekend. I can't say enough amazing things about this place!First, the staff was beyond amazing! So attentive of everything we needed from start-to-finish. To include hopping on a ladder to hang a sign for us. Once the shower began, our attendants were top notch. They set up a mimosa bar for us and made sure our glasses were filled at all times! (Speaking of mimosa bar, they had not only OJ and cranberry juice, but peach and strawberry puree!!)The menu was delicious and the food came out quickly. And to top it off, the space is very modern so it served as a great backdrop for the event. SO, if you have an event I HIGHLY suggest you have it at Buku! You will not be disappointed. And if you're just hungry, I also HIGHLY suggest you go to Buku!!"], ["Dia D.", "We went here for dinner on a night that they had a large private party in the bar. While the service was super friendly it was a little slow at times. We ordered 4 small plates and 1 large plate. The small plates (Chinese buns with pork belly, Thai green papaya salad, Filipino Lumpia, and Duck Larb) were all outstanding but the large plate (the samosa pot pie) was just ok. The small plates had lots of flavor, spiciness, and fresh taste. Their menu is changing to a fall menu in a few weeks. The ambiance inside was nice and it wasn't too loud."], ["Angelique A.", "FIVE STARS FOR CONCEPT, \u00a0DESSERT AND WINE. \u00a0The halo halo is a flavor explosion of taro ice cream, coconut, jackfruit, and tamarind. I can't say that it much resembles the dessert I had in manila, but it's so yummy that I don't care at all. Other members in our party got the tiramisu and German trifle and were very pleased as well. They also have great coffee and tea offerings so you can enjoy those instead of Food if you're not up for a meal. The service here has been superior each time I attended. I love that they have an eclectic mix of street food from all over the world and will be returning to try the meals. Note that it is brunch only on Sundays til 5 pm."], ["Jamie E.", "An awesome experience and mouth watering desserts deserve five stars, but Buku loses small points for super sweet sangria and chewy sushi. Still one of the best places in town. After falling in love with the chocolate souffl\u00e9 during a quick stop at the bar, I pledged to come back to Buku. To honor this vow, the other night a friend and I dined on the beautiful outdoor patio.Our server, Steven, was friendly, attentive and knowledgable about the food. He immediately informed us of their drink special: white sangria. Naturally, we got a pitcher ($20). I enjoyed it thoroughly, though I will say it was a little too sweet, and I am a notorious fan of sweet wine. They also drained most of the fruit out and served it without ice. These are stylistic choices, and perfectly respectable ones at that. I just prefer a fruity, icy sangria personally. I ordered the Buku roll (no cucumber), and my friend ordered gazpacho. The sushi was tasy with lump crab and yellowfin tuna, but the thick seaweed was hard to bite into. I've had sushi with thinner nori, which I've found easier and more enjoyable to eat. The guzpacho, again, was a stylistic flavor-profile that is empirically good, but not for me. This cold green soup had a powerfully fresh flavor and was beautifully plated. Less the spoonful she gave me, my friend ate every drop. Finally, we got what we really came for: dessert. It was national dessert day, and I specially sought out Buku for the chocolate souffl\u00e9 with almond ice cream that I've been obsessing over since my first visit. It was delicious, as per par. We also tried the tiramisu. Served in a tall glass flute, the layered coffee-flavored pastry looked beautiful. Steven brought out a Kahlua-honey infused sauce that he poured on top. I thought that brief interaction at the table brought the dessert presentation to the next level. Overall, the meal was still a little pricey, and the sushi wasn't my \u00a0favorite, which is why Buku didn't get the five stars from me. This will definitely become one of my go-tos though!"], ["Alexa L.", "Wow overrated much? I had high high hopes because hey, it's buku! Everyone's heard of this place and it's supposed to be asian fusion! and they serve ramen! and pho! and arepas! wow!Except i was not wowed in the least. We got the ramen and I made the dire mistake of ordering aforementioned arepas and i'm not sure what i was thinking when i did. I guess I expected something even somewhat similar to those at guasaca? But no, they literally handed me thick, bland, cornmeal arepas, plain. With a side of honey butter or something. So I was basically eating cornbread and butter. It was..anticlimactic to say the least. Buku y u do this to me?!?Oh and the ramen? Also bland and underwhelming. If you want decent ramen (by raleigh standards, not nyc/la ok?) go to sono.oh, at least this place looks nice."], ["Mark W.", "I've been to Buku several times and I've always enjoyed it. The atmosphere is great for date night and generally fits my mood for going downtown. The menu has a good selection of different types of food, so this is a great restaurant to bring groups to. I generally don't have dinner downtown very often, but Buku will remain in my list for when I do. \u00a0One of my visits was during Triangle Restaurant Week and I ordered a mix of dishes from the regular menu as well as one of the special 3-course meals. I probably wouldn't order off the special menu again, but the regular menu items were excellent as always. I really like the small plates best, and I would recommend ordering a bunch of small plates over ordering entrees here. My favorite items are the Jamaican Lamb Patties and the Filipino Lumpia. The empanadas, dumplings, and chaat are also good, but they are also easier to find at other restaurants in the Triangle area. Many of the items are naturally gluten free or vegetarian, so this is a great place for people with dietary restrictions. \u00a0 Buku offers a diverse menu with great small plates, solid vegetarian and gluten free options, a classy atmosphere, and good service. I would definitely recommend Buku for dining downtown, and I'll certainly be back myself."], ["Janet N.", "A group of 16 of us came out to buku for my birthday dinner and it was delicious!! However, being the birthday girl, I never got to see the bill which I assume is pretty steep. If you're looking for a fancy restaurant that treats you like you're made of money, buku is the spot! The food I had was very flavorful and the birthday shot the restaurant gave me was AMAZING!! They were so organized and courteous about our large numbered reservation. I felt pretty stress free! Thanks for a great birthday, bu*ku!Ps. I gave 4 stars for the crappy ramen. So many complaints from my friends."], ["Chris T.", "Brunch. Best I've ever had. They have best in class traditional breakfast items like fantastic waffles and French toast, omelette bar, carving station, breads and muffins and they also have excellent other fair like fried chicken, assortments of salads, hummus and raita, and my favorite chipotle corn. I tasted most offerings and all were superb. Highly recommended."], ["Abbie G.", "When I first moved to the area my cousin absolutely raved about Buku and insisted we dine there. \u00a0She told me it was an asian fusion restaurant, so how could I say no? \u00a0I was not disappointed!We were seated on the patio, so I have no comment about the inside of the restaurant. \u00a0However, the patio was cozy enough, and I had the atmosphere of enjoying my food outside in a very nice city area. \u00a0Our server was very pleasant, prompt and kind. \u00a0She was descriptive about the menu items when we asked. Our drinks were delicious (mine was the sangria), our appetizers were hot and fresh, and my pho was among the best I had ever tasted! I can't wait to go back and try new items on the menu!"], ["Anila Y.", "Not quite sure what the hype is about this place. I guess my review might be biased because I am not a fan of places that do global cuisine! I am all for restaurants that specialize in one type of cuisine because I don't feel like it is possible to master all types of cuisine on one menu-- Buku just confirmed this hypothesis. We tried four very different items:1. \u00a0Colombian Arepas--don't bother with these. They were very bland and nothing compared to the amazing Arepas at Guasaca. It was just a thick slab of corn bread with a little jalapeno butter (not spicy at all) and onion jam. (The onion jam was very good though). But the bread was so thick, that you couldn't get the flavor of the butter or the jam.2. \u00a0Aloo Chana Chaat -- Was actually good, and quite authentic. If it had been spicy, this dish would have been great!3. Vegetable dumplings -- good I like that they were very crispy, but they also tasted like something I might pick up from Trader Joes and toss into the microwave if you know what i mean ;)4. Elote -- this dish salvaged the whole meal! I feel like I could eat this all the time! I definitely recommend this item! A great note to end on.We also had some dessert. They actually have a separate dessert chef, which was pretty apparent because the size of the desserts was bigger than the servings of the items we got! The desserts were definitely good, but there wasn't a global selection of desserts besides the Filipino Halo Halo. I wouldn't return to Buku simply because you get very little food for a very high price. The prices are justifiable for Downtown Raleigh, but I feel like at other places you would get much much more food. And then the desserts are very large and difficult to finish. Perhaps if they adjusted their portion sizes, it would be more worth it."], ["Leslie C.", "This restaurant has it going on! It's fantastic. Their Gluten Free menu was loaded with great goodies! I ended up getting a delicious soup with chicken, cilantro, coconut milk...I can't wait to go back and have it again! I also had the Hummus with veggies. Oh wow! Delicious! Best I've ever had!"], ["Jessica V.", "We REALLY wanted to love this place. As a world traveling foodie, I was excited about the concept of this restaurant. My first impression was that there's a disconnect between the upscale ambiance and the street food theme. There's nothing fancy about street food; simplicity, ingredients and sense of place is what makes it beautiful. BF had the samosa pot pie. Folks, a sheet of puff pastry set on top of a mound of lukewarm hash does not a pot pie make! The hash was dry, lacked flavor dimension and was not visually appealing. I had the bibimbap. The presentation was colorful and the ingredients were fresh. The barbecued beef was done perfectly. I would have been more impressed if it were better than the food truck version I had a few weeks ago in Asheville. Perhaps eating out of a takeout container with plastic utensils while sipping a local beer with my man at my side and our dog at our feet in the fresh autumn air is what lent to that culinary experience. Which serves to my point. The beauty of street food is not only the cuisine itself, but the place in which you enjoy it. While it is a noble goal to try to wrap that experience up in a restaurant, i'm just not sure it can be done successfully. Buku tries, but most with global street food experience would say that it's a miss."], ["Hannah P.", "I came here with a friend on a Friday night at around 7:30. The first thing I noticed was the patio seating, where everyone was wearing a button-down or dress of some sort. It would've been a 15 minute wait to sit outside, but since my friend and I were both starving, we decided to sit inside with no wait.Inside has fancy modern decorations with a nice glass waterfall backdrop (noted because my friend particularly liked this) and plenty of seating. There was a better mix of style from the people inside - meaning, some were dressed up, others weren't as much. It made us feel more comfortable and less awkward. (We didn't realize that Buku was on the fancier side. Though we should've known since tapas restaurants are usually more upscale than regular restaurants.)After being seated by a haughty hostess, our waiter greeted us. I wish I had gotten his name - he was so friendly, did a great job of carefully explaining the selection of dishes and drinks, and checked up on us enough times to make us feel cared for but not overwhelmed.We started off with two small plates: the Filipino lumpias and Jamaican lamb patties. The lumpias come as four sliced pieces. These were delicious, especially paired with the side sauce and bed of mango salad. The lamb patties come as two patties with pickled red cabbage placed on top. These were spicier than I expected and the edges were crisp - so good!For our main dishes, my friend got the special of the day (grouper with sesame seeds on a bed of rice) and I got the pork belly ramen. Our waiter raved about the grouper, but it was honestly pretty bland and flavorless. The ramen was also underwhelming: the noodles tasted and felt and looked way too starchy (they were stuck to each other!), the broth didn't have depth (tasted a lot like the Korean o-deng/tempura soup), and the sake-braised pork shoulder was a bit rough and actually kind of tasted like pulled pork. I will admit, though, that the pork belly pieces were pretty large and crispy, and had a good fat:meat ratio.I also want to mention that I got the new Hefeweizen that they had on tap. My waiter decided to add an orange slice to it and told me he's never tried that with a patron, but wanted to know my thoughts. I liked it, my partner didn't. I thought it was a sweet and welcoming gesture, but some people might not like that (#drinksnobs).Overall, the atmosphere was nice and the small plates were great; but the large plates and bowls were subpar, especially considering the high price of them. If anything, just come here for the drinks and small plates. Don't bother with the actual entrees."], ["Jennifer B.", "I'm going to echo the sentiment of most. \u00a0I went for the Buku Beer Dinner for Beer Week with 5 courses and 6 beer pairings. \u00a0For me, the highlight was the Larb Seasoned Chicharrones and the Lamb. \u00a0It was a really nicely organized event where the Brewery explained each beer and the Chef explained each course. \u00a0All in all, a fantastic event, great food and I highly recommend. \u00a0I can't wait to come back and try the regular menu."], ["Natacha S.", "Girls night out with my best friend visiting for the weekend and Buku was the highlight of our trip! We went on a Saturday night, without reservations, but luckily we still got seated after about 30 mins. While there was a bachelorette event in the bar section, we were able to order a \u00a0couple cocktails in the waiting area! My girlfriend and I each had their mule special, and it was delicious! For dinner, I chose their scallops plate served on couscous - I forget what exactly was in it, but the dish was amazing! The scallops were by far the best ones I've ever had ($24 plateThe service was great. The waitress was always around to fill up our waters and she was very polite and friendly :) The dining area is very big, and can accommodate large tables. The decor and the style is also very modern which I really liked. I do wish the menu wasn't so expensive. When we had first arrived, all we saw were beautiful women in high hills specially dressed for a night out so we thought \"this must be a fancy place!\" But turns out all those people were going to the private event in the bar section, and in the dining section everyone was dressed pretty casually. Personally, I would dress up for this restaurant considering the chic atmosphere and the price itself is a little \"dressed up\". It's definitely a great restaurant for an occasion or a date night out :) I plan on going back with my husband this time, in hopes to eat that delicious scallops plate again!"], ["Amber M.", "I want to give this place 3.5 stars, but I can't. It was....interesting? I wasn't really sure what to expect, but I was intrigued by the variety on the menu. The Chinese buns were super yummmmy, although you only got two. It would be perfect for a starter, if I wasn't starving like I was. I ended up getting the saki maki roll, I was craving sushi and it was okay. My mom got a duck adobo, I believe. That was delicious. Again, not a huge plate of food, probably the proper serving size to be honest, I'm just used to huge, over sized American portions.I don't think I would come back here super hungry like I was but the food was interesting not only with the menu options but the spice variety was great! It was different and I did enjoy it. Oh and Brent was our server, he was FABULOUSSSSS! Oh one more thing, I liked the dessert."], ["Nadia S.", "As many of my friends had told me, this place is a hit or miss. \u00a0The restaurant is beautiful and the ambiance is great...so are the crab flautas and the duck done 3 ways with coconut rice. \u00a0Everything else fell flat. The mussels came out cold. Not sure what to say about that. My friend's beer came out warm and flat.... The arepas were good but not amazing. \u00a0The bibimbap was alright, could have been so much better. \u00a0Our server was awkward and not very helpful. \u00a0We were told the small plates were tiny bites, but I thought they were pretty big portions- you def don't need to order 2-3 per person. I guess I'm used to small plates being like REALLY SMALL like in the big cities, so that was kinda nice. \u00a0Glad I finally tried this place out but prolly won't be back. \u00a0The hype was not real for me folks."], ["Katie T.", "For some reason, I had yet to visit BuKu, but it had been on my list for several years. Last week, my boss and i made a trip over for lunch during the work week. The enormous outdoor seating area is a huge plus. We had great service, and a very attentive waiter who went above and beyond to make sure our special requests were addressed. I ordered the hummus plate - an abundance of pita complemented the garlicky hummus. I also ordered the papaya salad with tofu (vegetarian). The tofu was cooked well - crispy and a little chewy. It's a bit pricier for a lunch compared to other spots, but it was high quality and a beautiful space for something a little fancier than the vendor down the street. Plus, the variety of the menu really lets you build your own meal out of small plates or splitting larger ones. Will definitely visit again!"], ["Donnell P.", "The best brunch in Raleigh. I love that it's a buffet brunch with all the fixings. Everything from waffles to omelets. The last time I was here with my Mom the buffet was $20 but I thought it was a good value since there was a good variety of items to choose from."], ["Penny P.", "I'm usually not a fan of fusion restaurants, but Buku was delicious! I went with my cousin and our boyfriends for a much needed get together. We ordered multiple plates and with that our server to it upon himself to bring out our plates according to the world regions. And that was a great idea! Really added to the experience!!Also, great cocktails!"], ["Matt G.", "All I can say about Buku is WOW!! Actually, there is a lot more I can say, so here goes: I wanted to find an elegant restaurant in Raleigh that would be good for celebrating an occasion, or for bringing friends from out of town. This will be the spot for that from now on! The restaurant is very big and clean and has just that kind of ambiance that I was looking for, a kind of place where you can spend a good few hours. The server was super-friendly, very accomodating to our requests and questions, and he even offered my wife a glass of sparkling wine for her birthday, and a glass of beer for myself! The entrees do sound delicious, but we went for about 7-8 of the small plates. It tasted so fresh, only prime ingredients. The Mexican corn on the cob dish was so yummy! I loved the crab floatas, and the green mango gazpacho was very innovative (but I do have to say I prefer the original recipe). The highlight of the night though was the dessert, the Filipino Halo Halo was out of this world, wow, never had anything like it , so many flavors and colors! Guava sauce, jack fruit, kiwi, papaya, and obviously the sweet potato ice cream with the beautiful purple color. We didn't want our dish to be done and kept scraping it for more! I would come back just for that. I do have to say we started off on a bad note with this establishment, when we waited to be seated, the hostess was very flat in her manner and not welcoming at all, and when we were seated at our table, she kind of tossed the menu at my wife, not cool! I would take a star off for that if the food wasn't so good. To summarize, I will be back! Merci buku!"], ["Kristen R.", "First, I absolutely love the ambiance of this restaurant! It's modern and fresh but also cozy and comfortable. Every time I've come here I've felt welcomed and at home while still feeling very classy like I would at an upscale restaurant. The service is always attentive, professional and fun. Servers are very interactive and know the menu well which is always helpful when you need guidance on what to order. First time here I ordered the pork belly ramen and my friend ordered the Scottish salmon. Both packed with flavor and fresh ingredients. Salmon perfectly cooked and seasoned. And both decent portions. Second time around I ordered the Colombian Arepas to start, which was unfortunately a huge let down. Good texture but really lacked any flavor at all. For my entree I got the vietnamese crepes with summer rolls. While everything was fresh and tasty, the shrimp (which made up most of the crepes) were ridiculously overcooked! I felt like I was eating chunks of rubber. It kind of ruined the whole dish for me. (Some friends ordered the samosa pot pie and buku hot pot which they both loved!)For dessert, we ordered the honey & kuhlua tiramisu and it was heavenly! Very big portion for a dessert which was nice.Overall, I really do like this place for a nice dinner every so often but unfortunately I think it's very overpriced for what it is. The food is good, but I don't think it's good enough for what you pay, which is why I can't give it 5 stars."], ["Rachael H.", "Of the restaurants in downtown Raleigh. \u00a0This just isn't a favorite of mine. \u00a0I went for my second visit (the last was actually a few years ago) last night to celebrate a friend's birthday. \u00a0Our server was fantastic and they had Bell's Hopslam on tap. \u00a0Those were probably our two highlights of the night. \u00a0For food, we decided to try two small plates and one large plate. \u00a0We ordered the Colombian Arepas and the Filipino Limpia as our two small plates. \u00a0The Limpia was also a positive note on the the evening. \u00a0I was thankful for pictures and reviews on here recommending it. \u00a0Food wise - it was the best thing we had all night. \u00a0I have never had Filipino food before. \u00a0To help someone else in my shoes, I would describe it as a cross between a pork dumpling and an egg roll. \u00a0The filling is very similar to a pork dumpling filling and then its appearance and outside is similar to an egg roll. \u00a0The green sauce and mango salad served with it were great. \u00a0I continued to drench each bit in the sauce and cover it with the strips of marinated mango. \u00a0If I went back, I would order this dish again. \u00a0Arepa wise - neither of us were two impressed. \u00a0I've decided that I'm just not an Arepa girl. \u00a0I think they are all generally a bit greasy (even the ones at Guasaca). \u00a0My husband loves Guasaca so he was looking forward to these. \u00a0They were just a bit plain. \u00a0They served the arepa standing alone. \u00a0We had to slice it down the middle and then spread either jalapeno butter or onion jam on it. \u00a0While both fillings were tasty, they were very modest - especially in comparison to Guasaca. \u00a0Even my Guasaca loving husband was disappointed. \u00a0We wouldn't order these again. \u00a0For our entree, we chose the Pork Belly Ramen. \u00a0We chose this on a recommendation from a friend. \u00a0Although it was visually a spectacular dish - the flavor profile just didn't hit it for us. \u00a0It was very savory, maybe even a bit umami. \u00a0We like a little more spice or sweetness.

Sesame carrots, bread and butter pickles, pickled radishes, hangar steak, gochujuong, soy marinated mushrooms, scallions and a fried egg.... It was just unbelievable!

It's only buffet which I usually don't like as much as a normal menu, but theirs is the best breakfast buffet I've ever had.

It had been sitting on the table when I arrived, so I assume it had perhaps been there all day and collected dust. Asked for a new plate, and it was dusty too!

Cocktails were superb - Strawbanero Sling- $9 and the Appalachian Slush- $8, well thought and mixed concoctions. For small plates we went with the Jamaican Lamb Patties- two for $10, Baja Crab Flautas- two for $9 and the Filipino Lumpia- two for $9. The Lumpia was the gold star winner with the cilantro chutney. If you love cilantro like I do then this item should be on your short list. The Lamb patties were a solid sliver. Not bad but I wouldn't get them again. In Jamaican dishes I am looking for that spice profile that these just didn't have and were quite bland considering the region they were trying to mimic. The pickled cabbage they were served with was a nice touch. The Baja Flautas were more like a spicy crab Rangoon. There was a balance between spicy and sweet with the mango-habanero salsa but I mostly just tasted the cream cheese and zero crab. I wouldn't get these again. I am a huge fan of small plates, getting to try a bunch of different plates without stuffing yourself is my ideal dinner. They have 20 or so small plates to choose from but they also have about 12 large dishes/meals if small plates aren't your thing. Overall I enjoyed my experience and look forward to trying more of their dishes in the near future."], ["Carol S.", "This rating is not entirely based upon food so keep that in mind. \u00a0Food wise I have no issue with Buku. \u00a0The menu offering is good as well as presentation. \u00a0My issue lies in an experience my husband and I had when trying to visit the restaurant one day...

To drink I got the sangria, which was good - not great and my husband got the Garden's Bounty which was absolutely amazing! For appetizers we got the peach and mozzarella salad and the halloumi cheese salad, both of which were so fresh and had great flavors. For our entrees I got the striped bass, which was good, but the veggies underneath really stole the dish as they were phenomenal. My husband got the signature chicken and waffles which were melt in your mouth good and apparently a menu staple. For dessert we got the chocolate souffl\u00e9 which was the perfect end to an amazing dinner - they bring it out right from the oven and pour in the hot fudge and add the cr\u00e8me fresh right at your table.

Finally, the food... \u00a0First we had Beignets as a starter. \u00a0They were denser, smaller and generally not as appetizing as those that I have had in other restaurants all around the southeast. \u00a0Our group ordered several different breakfast entrees. \u00a0I ordered the shrimp and grits but I also sampled the Omelet Du Jour, and the biscuits and gravy. \u00a0The omelet du Jour which consisted of a pheasant confit which was pretty tasty but other than the limited amount of pheasant confit was fairly tame and not particularly well seasoned. \u00a0The home fries were over cooked and crunchy all the way through. \u00a0The shrimp and grits were perfection. \u00a0The fresh NC shrimp were excellent. \u00a0The grits were cooked well but a little too much cream for my tastes, especially as compared to those I have had in Charleston, SC, some think the mecca of shrimp and grits. \u00a0Finally, the rue over the grits formed a full layer over the grits, way too much gravy. \u00a0The biscuits and gravy were not good for only one reason. \u00a0The sausage used in the gravy was ITALIAN SAUSAGE! \u00a0Once you substitute fennel seed rich Italian sausage from sage heavy southern style sausage it ceases to be Southern, unless this is a dish popular in Southern Italy rather than the southern part of the United States.Like I said I wanted to really like this place. \u00a0If I open a restaurant one day I would want many of the same elements. \u00a0Clean, modern, straight forward, farm to table menu.But in Raleigh with a diverse clientele your wait staff has to bring their A-Game at all times and a rocky start such as nearly being offended when asked if the chef will substitute an ingredient, being short, resisting serving coffee before the entire party arrives also leaves a bad taste. \u00a0Many may be willing to tolerate this type of silly treatment but my group was and I were a little disappointing."], ["Charlotte W.", "We were at Mandolin for a private event and it was awesome.

I'm not sure which I loved more.+ The menu was small but I thought there was a good variety to it. I'm pretty picky and there were still 2 or 3 dishes I had my eye on.+ Andrew ordered the special, a 16oz Ribeye, and cleaned his plate.+ My hangar steak was perfectly cooked+ Walking distance from our Five Points bungelow- The Panzanella salad was delicious, but the croutons were too crunchy to chew. I thought panzanella croutons usually were marinated beforehand? I'm thinking they forgot that step...- My veggies had a smoky quality to them, presumably from the wood fire oven, but it didn't fit well with the rest of the plate. The tomatoes were also not quite ripe.- Everything was a bit oversalted- We were a little surprised by the pricetag at the end of the meal...we knew it would be a nice night out, but expected it to be around $100. Instead with 2 drinks + 2 starters + 2 entrees, we ended up at around $140 with tip. Come prepared ;)Overall, we really enjoyed the night and will definitely be back.

Just go - you will not be disappointed."], ["Amanda S.", "Classy -- Beautiful -- Extraordinary StyleThis restaurant went above and beyond my expectations. My girlfriend had made reservations at Mandolin weeks ago for my birthday celebration and I was blown away how everything was beginning with just walking in the front door. The decor is fabulous. A little modern, a little chic but very warm and inviting all at the same time. We were quickly seated and the set up of all the tables is cute and inviting. Our server wasn't ready immediately but two other servers came and introduced themselves, gave us water and bread, not long before our server came to our table and offered us drinks and told us the specials. I ordered the trigger fish with vegetable quinoa and pan seared avocado and my girlfriend ordered the chicken and dumplings. Both were fantastic meals. Since I have to be aware of gluten in my meals, it was definitely a question we asked the server. They didn't have a separate menu but he quickly could point out specifically how they prepare every dish which ones included gluten and which did not. I'd have to say about 50/50 on the options that I was able to order from on the menu that did not include gluten. We both ordered a glass of wine as well. Our server had great knowledge of various wines that would pair up nicely with our meals. Before we knew it, we had been there 3 hours and had just been talking away! We ordered a decaf and regular coffee which they brew specifically for you in a French Press (they use Larry's Beans coffee, FYI). Also, we ordered the lavender cheesecake that was phenomenal. We had some trepidation about ordering food that actually had pieces of lavender in it, but after one bite (and it looks like a scoop of vanilla ice cream) we were hooked! It was the most delicious and refreshing dessert we've had in a very long time. All in all, we were more than pleased with our service, the food options, presentation, decor, and ambiance. Our visit to Mandolin will definitely go down in the memory books for us and we've each spoken about our visit to various people and most definitely want to go back again soon!

Very comfortable, good drinks, and most of the food was very good. The tuna, however, was just not good. I tried to tolerate it, requesting some Ponzu sauce to disguise what appeared to be a weird, almost old flavor. That didn't do the trick. At the end of the meal, our server noted that I had eaten less than half of my dish. I told her that it had a funky flavor. I was disappointed that nobody else talked to me about this poor dish. I might go back, but the lack of responsiveness to a problem like this was very disappointing."], ["Kenyetta H.", "I went to this place during restaurant week last Thursday. The place is really nice. It had a great ambiance. The patio area was nice as well. I had the crabcake with potato salad. It was pretty good. For the entree, had the salmon on garlic potatoes. That was great. Lastly, for dessert, I had creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. It too was great. The service was amazing. Definitely knowledgable about the food. love to go to a restaurant and the servers tell me what they think is good or not good. I would definitely go back there again. Hopefully, the other food on the menu will be as good as what I ate."], ["Beth P.", "We went here for an anniversary dinner, and I guess we had higher expectations than we should have. The food ranged from pretty good (scallop appetizer) to pretty gross ( blackened triggerfish ). The \"specialty cocktail\" was also yucky. Too many artificial flavors came out. The wine list was on a ridiculously heavy metal slab (nitpicky, I know, but it' very difficult to peruse a wine list if you're having to curl it), and they didn't have anywhere near as many whites as reds. Guess what we wanted with our seafood dishes? A nice white. There were several sparkling white wines, which I guess they figured made up for it, but the only folks I know that go out and order sparkling are 21 year old girls. \u00a0The upper dining area is very \"sports bar\" feeling (could have something to do with all the TVs peeking over from the bar area), was very loud, and and we weren't very comfortable. We had a reservation, and really they probably gave us the worst table in the whole joint. We asked to move to the lower dining area, which they did, but put us right next to the service entrance, so that was no good either.Because we'd already complained about our seat, we felt uncomfortable complaining about the food. We'll just never go back again. Bad food, bad atmosphere, bad service...and I would say more like $$$ in terms of price. Totally not worth it."], ["Adam T.", "Delicious and innovative! This is our new regular spot. Try the prix fix menu Monday through Thursday.

She steered me to the right chardonnay for me (and it was the least expensive one)...bread and butter were very nice. \u00a0 \u00a0 My first course was a crabcake with a mango salsa. \u00a0It was good. \u00a0Husband enjoyed his tangy artichoke dip with corn chips. \u00a0My entree was a scallop dish with rice and a cold shredded veggie salad. \u00a0I enjoyed it. \u00a0Husband had a great-looking steak with mashed taters and a rich sauce. He was especially pleased with the quality of the beef and how well it was cooked. \u00a0He declared it to be one of the best steaks he's had here in NC. \u00a0(he's a mid-west guy, so he's had some good beef) \u00a0 As for dessert, we both changed our minds after hearing descriptions from our Server. \u00a0I went with the Tiramisu, which was light and very very sweet. \u00a0Husband did the Chocolate Pecan Tart, which was rich and good.  \u00a0 I would say Monday is a great day to check out Margaux's!"], ["Kathleen W.", "It's a good thing I don't live in North Carolina or I'd be here every week ... Wow. \u00a0Fred and I ordered a bunch of appetizers / starters and shared an entree ... they were kind enough to split our entree for us. \u00a0Even as a split entree, it was HUGE ... and amazing.to start:Roasted Prosciutto Wrapped Scallops over herbed pesto orzo pasta - the scallops were cooked perfectly. \u00a0There were only 2 scallops though ... I could have eaten half a dozen easily. \u00a0I actually didn't care much for the pesto orzo pasta that came with it ... it seemed to be a let down after the scallops. Margaux's Steakhouse Salad - this is a lot like the salad they serve at House of Prime Rib ... only better cause it has shrimp and bacon in it ... but any salad with bacon and shrimp is awesome. \u00a0Soup of the day was a clam chowder - this was probably the weakest of everything we ate that night. \u00a0The soup was tasty - but almost too watery for such a rich soup. \u00a0Generous portions of clams, but I like my chowders to be more viscous.For our entree:Triggerfish with veggies on a bed of mashed potatoes - Wow. \u00a0This was amazing! \u00a0the fish was super fresh, it came with a lot of sauce (i LOVE sauce) all on a bed of veggies over mashed potatoes. \u00a0Everything was seasoned and cooked just how I like it. \u00a0Service was excellent and if I didn't have to go back to about 2 more hours of work, I would have loved to check out the dessert menu - I'm sure it would not have disappointed me. \u00a0This will give me an excuse to go back next time I'm in town!"], ["Donna G.", "This is the best restaurant I've been to in Raleigh by far.

Not too much of a big deal. Had time to talk with E and take in the scene which I would describe as energetic \u00a0crowded and noisy. Seems like a great place to meet friends for drinks after work. TGIF anyone?!?!Second, the meal. EXCELLENT! I had the crab cake appetizer with slaw. Anyone who knows me well knows I have an aversion to cole slaw. I don't want to see it, smell it, say it or even have to imagine it. However, the dish was really good. Not a Maryland crab cake but it was a nice starter. My entree was the salmon with spinach and mashed potatoes. The entire entree was scrumptious. Perfect portions also. \u00a0At first I didn't pay attention to the bread basket but don't overlook the cornbread! It was the best cornbread I have had whilst in NC. Lastly, I had the banana pound cake for dessert. It was moist, not overly sweet and pretty good as well.Third, the bathroom. YUCK!!! No hot water! I let the water run for 5 minutes and it was ice cold. Then the hostess was in there picking at her acne and she didn't wash her hands until I stared her down. Just gross. \u00a0*did you know menus carry the most germs in restaturants...even more than the bathroom door knobs?* Lastly, our waiter Val...(yes he has my name..how odd...I know). \u00a0I hate to say it but \u00a0VAL WAS AWFUL! \u00a0At first I thought that he was just laid back but that \"laid back-ness\" turned into just plain unfriendliness. \u00a0For instance, when we were reviewing our menus we really couldn't decide. \u00a0We mentioned to Val we had trouble deciding. Not only did he neglect to tell us what the specials were for the night, but he clearly didn't want to make any recommendations or provide any assistance. \u00a0His only reply was, \"I will come back when I think you are ready\" and proceeded to leave us for 20 minutes!!! \u00a0 It wouldn't take a 4 year old 20 minutes to read a menu. \u00a0And that is how the night started....Unfortunately, by the end of the night I could describe him as abrasive and snappy. The weird thing is I was able to ignore him most of the meal because I was having such a great food experience coupled with the conversation from E (who's always so enthralling). However, by dessert E was completely annoyed and distracted by Val's demeanor and attitude. When E asked Val if the dessert he chose had much dark chocolate because of his allergies, Val proceeded to tell E he wasn't sure because the dessert chef left for the night. \u00a0So E said \"Ok\" but proceed to clarify his statement by telling Val he could have white chocolate just not milk or dark chocolate - as if maybe giving him this information would actually humanize E to Val. \u00a0No such luck. \u00a0Val said \"Just don't get it then.\" grabbed the menus and scurried off. \u00a0It's funny because E has held several office parties at Margaux's and has had several business meeting there with clients and said he never received service that horrible there. \u00a0It was my first time at Margaux's and I would be hard pressed to ever return.Overall, I have to give Margaux's 2 stars based upon the overall experience."], ["Jim F.", "The food was very good, but the service was not. \u00a0When I spend $300 for 5 people I expect both great food and service. \u00a0The waitress had an attitude and level of service comparable to a poor waitress at a low-end diner. \u00a0For starters, she reached across my daughter's plate to slide my wife's water glass to her. \u00a0She spilled my son's drink in his lap and her response was not to apologize, but to say, \"They fill them so full and expect us to carry them... at least you get a good poor\". \u00a0Our seating was 7:15 and our food arrived to the table at 9:00. \u00a0The waitress was not to be seen through most of that time and when my wife asked the waitress what took so long, her response was that there were other large parties ahead of us. \u00a0Her response was curt and she did not apologize, nor did the manager come by to apologize. \u00a0It was my wife's birthday and when considering desert, my wife asked if they did anything special for birthdays. \u00a0The waitress said, \"we can put a candle in it\", again with an attitude. \u00a0The clincher for me was when I received the bill and found that a 20% gratuity was added and for a party of 5. \u00a0I typically tip greater than 20% for good service, but was only going to tip 15% because of the the poor service. \u00a0I was not pleased, so when the waitress came I said, \"Seriously? \u00a020% automatically for 5 people\". \u00a0Her response was, \"Seriously!\". \u00a0I won't mention her by name, but I did notice that another person called her out by name in another post stating that she was working the bar and that the staff was arrogant and extremely impressed with themselves."], ["Adam H.", "If you want monster portions for monster prices, then this is your place.

I will point out just a few items that might make me less inclined to go there more regularly.1. The $49.95 prix fixe dinner, although three course, was a bit on the pricey side. Nicely presented, excellent selection but still somewhat high. Correct price point should have been closer to $35-40. Probably taking advantage of Valentine's Day.2. Despite reservations, we still had to wait about 30-45 minutes. That is stretching it a bit and indicates overbooking. That generally means maximizing revenue at the cost of diner's time which is not respected.3. Hygiene rating for a restaurant of this caliber was very low, in the low 90's.4. I suspect number 3 could be related to the fact that silverware is placed directly on tables which many past diners would have been collectively using. Has anyone ever heard of tablecloths or is it just an easy way to be cheap? Whether surfaces are regularly and properly wiped down is irrelevant as most people don't stick around to watch. It is about perception.The biggest problem with 'fine dining' today, is that restaurateurs base it strictly on price which diners and reviewers then too often blindly follow."], ["Jill D.", "First time - Just showed up on a busy night and sat at the bar for dinner, it was noisy but that what happens when a place is packed.

Very impressive.Second time- gave it another chance since the care taken to improve our 1st time...LOVED IT!

Warm goat cheese (seared) salad with nice creamy herb dressing on a bed of local greens, and the taste was explosive.The main menu started with Portabella Polenta, with saut\u00e9ed spinach and parsley pesto.

Third dish was what I called a Chile Relleno, remixed, because it's stuffed with wild rice and ratatouille, drizzled with a nice sweet pepper balsamic reduction.The meal came to an exciting conclusion with a selection of raspberry key lie pie, giant layered slice of Tiramisu, and a nice chocolate pecan pie (coconut added.)The proprietor was really nice and easily-approached dude; after my friend's gig we were just sitting down with him, chatting and watching him finishing up his dinner.Another thing, be sure you make your reservation, because you will be in for a long wait otherwise.(P.S.

The shrimp was just the right amount of spicy and was packed with flavor. The salad was a good combination of goat cheese, crunchy walnuts and an orange vinaigrette. All the dishes were plated nicely with a good presentation. The cafe ran fairly smoothly for being so busy and popular. The space was the right amount for live music and the crowds they brought in even with the rain. It's lively, loud and interesting.The bar is pretty well stocked too, with a good variety of choices.

And since the name of this place isn't even a word, it only makes sense that the words they use to name and describe the dishes aren't quite accurate either.

The whole point of ravioli is that it's all eaten together. \u00a0The seared duck breast was delectable, but the \"ravioli pasta\" is just sheets of slightly overcooked pasta that more closely resembles the love child of wonton wrappers and lasagna. Meh...Between the disjointed duck and a \"deconstructed\" curry on the specials menu, I'm guessing the theme here is taking things apart. But cooking should be about putting things together.

(I'm sensing a theme here.) \u00a0They're mini burgers (sliders) with avocado, and an orange zesty sauce. \u00a0Tried those too, yum! \u00a0Come to think of it, this is probably why I couldn't finish my pizza :)We were seated in directly the middle of the restaurant on what looked like a dance floor, and to my right a live band was playing in the classic \"big band\" style. \u00a0Even though we were up in their grills, they were not too loud for us to talk to each other. \u00a0I mean it's not intimate eating, but the music is a nice lively level.I went to the restroom at some point during the meal and read all the framed newspaper clippings that are hanging on the wall in the hallway about the history of this restaurant. \u00a0Apparently the Irregardless has been a staple in Raleigh for at least 2 decades, survived a fire, survived a brief switch to an internet cafe in the '00s, and is now back serving fusion cuisine and live music 7 days a week. \u00a0I was so thrilled to see this place ride the wave of change and recession, and still see it packed and going strong.After about 2 hours, we were winding down anyway, the manager came over to check on us, find out how everything was, and see if we could be moved to a booth off to the side of the parquet floor we were on. \u00a0Why? \u00a0They were opening it up for dancing. \u00a0Dancing to live big band/swing-style music. \u00a0Can you say soulmates?

Think of your run-of-the-mill Holiday Inn, with the obligatory restaurant that serves bland food for the everyman. A safe, staid menu that has all of the creativity of the frozen food section of your local grocery.Boring hotel restaurant, meet the Irregardless Cafe. You two have a lot in common.There's a lovefest of hype surround the Irregardless, and I really don't get it. Maybe it's the aging hippies who fondly remember this place from their days of free love and peace protests--who were there in abundance last night, complete with their ungroomed hair, loose fitting clothing and comfortable footwear. The crowd isn't the brain trust from neighboring NCSU, nor is this the up-and-coming hipsters from RTP or downtown Raleigh. The word \"retread\" comes to mind.But back to the Irregardless. It's in a strange spot and you will be doing some hunting for parking. The atmosphere inside is a combination of new-age artsy and cheap hotel events room, complete with the \"rack 'em and stack 'em\" chairs that are neither attractive to look at nor comfortable to sit in.We were there during Triangle Restaurant Week, and it seemed appropriate to try something from the special menu; after all, this is a time for restaurants to show their best and shine, right? Again, for a restaurant that gets such vaunted press, this was a really boring menu. We both ordered the white bean soup to start. She ordered the salmon entree and I ordered the spare ribs. She picked the flourless chocolate cake for dessert, while I opted for he creme brulee.The soup was the best part of the meal--but as you'll see, that's a fairly low bar to rise to. Both of our entrees were bland. And I'm not talking \"I should have ordered the hot spicy curry instead of the medium spicy curry;\" instead, I'm talking, \"seriously? I paid how much for this?\" The salmon, completely unadorned save a scattering of pepper, was carelessly tossed on a bed of similarly bland rice with some mash potatoes on the side. The spare ribs sat aside a few vegetables that were quickly sauteed in a bit of oil, and the same stale mashed potatoes.She commented that the rice and potatoes tasted like they had been cooked en masse earlier in the day and left under heat lamps (or worse yet, nuked). My spare ribs were identical to what I might get at K&W Cafeteria or Golden Corral. And that's not to say that they were bad; but they were nowhere near the caliber I expect for $30 per plate.We were in a party of six, and our table had seven seats. The owner of the restaurant came by during our meal to ask us how we were enjoying it. Drink in hand, he felt no compunction about sitting himself down and holding forth about how the restaurant got its name (although none of us had asked). There's nothing wrong with the owner coming by to see how things are, and participating in a bit of light banter if invited to. But the campy charm of holding forth and chattering as much as he did was inconsistent with the kind of dining experience that the Irregardless aspires to.The other problem was the noise. The aging hippies are a loud crowd. The live band was also competing with the din of noise, and the result was a lot of \"WHAT WAS THAT?\" and \"CAN YOU REPEAT THAT?\" I *hate* dining experiences where I have to strain just to hear what our small party was talking about, but that seems to be part and parcel with the Irregardless experience.So: irregardless of the Irregardless's storied history and longevity in the area, I simply cannot recommend this restaurant. It would be a stretch at half the price they're charging, and it doesn't even begin to compete with restaurants like Vin Rouge in Durham."], ["Trish X.", "Perfect spot for a cozy dinner for two. \u00a0My boyfriend and I really enjoyed the atmosphere, the food and the live music. \u00a0Our waitress was well informed about the menu and very attentive. \u00a0We both agreed that we will return very soon."]], "Stanbury": [["Tiam L.", "Made a reservation for a Saturday evening.

It is definitely out of the way and away from other restaurants on the main drag but don't let that deter you; this is a hip, excellent foodie restaurant. We arrived around 8:45 on Saturday night and there were no tables so we sat at the bar, which was fine because it was a nice bar. I started out with something that had tequila and rosemary and a fresh rosemary sprig. Nice touch. We ordered a couple small plates: beef tartare & the grilled romaine. Great choices! While I have had better, more flavorful beef tartare, it was surrounded in a couple different sauces that really took the flavors of the beef to the next level. I've never seen a beef tartare served with sauces or with a rye, which was an interesting choice, but it really was a great starter plate. The grilled romaine may not sound like much, but if you haven't tried something like this, you're missing out. The char on the lettuce combined with the large, soft croutons and the house-made cesar dressing created amazing flavor profiles in my mouth! Do not miss the grilled romaine!We both ordered the ribeye, which I typically hate to do, but we both wanted steaks, what can I say? I ordered it M, my bf ordered it MR. Go with MR, for sure. Ribeyes are my go-to at nice places and this ribeye did not disappoint. It had a nice sear to it and it had this tasty pesto-like sauce on it that, I think was Mexican-based, but oddly it paired very nicely with the ribeye. The mushrooms were marinated in something excellent, they also paired great with the steak and the potatoes were crispy and brown. One of the top 5 steaks of my life. We paired the steaks with a bottle of red (Grenache), at the recommendation of the bartender, and it went very well. Also, for having such an amazing, upscale menu, it was surprisingly low-key inside. Not stuffy at all. Great music. Chill staff. Dim-lighting. Rustic ambiance. AMAZING food. I am going on record as saying this meal at Stanbury was one of the top 3 best meals of my LIFE."], ["Jennifer J.", "Great service, accurate recommendations, amazing food, interesting ambiance -- what's not to love? Because we didn't have a reservation, my friend and I were seated at the bar, where we shared small plates of fresh oysters, Roasted Marrow, NC Tuna Crudo (seasonal), and Crispy Pig Head. All of the dishes were incredibly rich and flavorful, salty but not overly so. Trying the roasted marrow was an experience--the marrow is used like a butter spread on whole grain toast then topped w cooked argula, onions, and capers. My favorite dish was by far the crispy pig head, which had a crispy, breaded outer layer with mustard cream and pork inside. Get a reservation ahead of time, and if you have a long wait to be seated, make sure to visit Escazu, the artisan chocolate shop next door."], ["Mikkel M.", "Stanbury was excellent! I've heard good things and I don't know why I assumed it was an upscale fancy place but it's not really. It's just nice enough to be a good weekend meal with friends but just casual enough to feel like you can go during the week and sit at the bar and feel comfy.We got there and it was packed on a Friday night but the hostess was so sweet and said she thought a couple was going to finish their drinks at the bar soon - did we want her to save the seats for us when they paid and left? Yes! She told us a waitress would take our drink order in the meantime. Perfect. We ordered...and the table was ready for us shortly after. When we sat the cocktails were delivered!We ordered the pickled salmon starter with beets (I don't love pickled salmon, I have realized but I imagine if you do, this was a great dish - I do love beets and they were spot on!), and the fried oyster dish (GET IT!) and shared a main dish of fresh tagliatelle, which was delicious. It was fun to sit at the end of the bar closest to the kitchen too, and watch the cooks make things. They know what they're doing.Ambiance, service, price, flavors: all A+. Can't wait to go back! Great for a date or evening out with friends, but probably best for parties of 1-4."], ["Jerica L.", "Absolutely delicious. Flavorful unique dishes! It was quite a treat dining at this restaurant.

Her presence wasn't too overbearing, she was kind, and gave some great recommendations."], ["Christina G.", "My husband unabashedly gnawed on our appetizer attempting to extract the last remaining bits of bone marrow. It was that good. Marrow seems to be the new pork belly... I've seen it trending on Instagram feeds and featured on a few local menus lately (including Death & Taxes and Primal). This was our first introduction, and it's safe to say we're fans. The marrow is quite rich, spoons out and spreads like butter over toasted bread. They give you two bones here, which means we each had a 'bone to pick' AND both of our dogs were able to enjoy the spoils afterward; thanks, Stanbury, for the literal doggie bag!Our other app, the ink octopus, was so incredible I don't have words to describe it. The surprising flavors and textures of both starters left us a wee bit disappointed with the entree we opted to split: a fish prepared Thai-style with rich coconut milk and jasmine rice. It was still tasty (featuring bright flavors and flakey fish), just not as standout or original as everything else we had. My cocktail was a light seasonal selection, subtle and refreshing. Place was packed and a little loud, but service (except for the hostess, a surprising anomaly) remained friendly and prompt. It's a fun off-beat space, a bit small & bustling, with oddities like Yoda decorations lurking about. Our check arrived with two squares of neighboring Escazu chocolate -- a super-cool (and tasty!) gesture to their neighbor. With the frequently updated seasonal selections ensuring a menu that remains full of surprises, this is one restaurant to put on heavy rotation."], ["Susy G.", "Loved everything we tried! \u00a0This was our first time and we will definitely be going back. \u00a0Even if it means driving 15 miles from Wake Forest...Excellent cheese plate, followed by the grilled romaine salad and finally the crispy pig face! \u00a0Enjoyed the causal atmosphere and great service"], ["AR B.", "Taking the advice of The New York Times, I took my mother here to share one of the finest restaurants in the Raleigh Durham area.

Seemingly everything at Stanbury is delicious!We went for my birthday dinner last night and feasted on three small plates before our large plates. The swordfish crudo was my favorite - perfectly seared over a bed of seaweed salad. The bone marrow is always a good choice - it is totally unlike anything else in Raleigh (plus they let you take the bones home for your dogs!) The crispy pig head was indescribable how different and delicious it was - served with lentils, a mustard sauce, and an egg, it was something unique and was absolutely delicious. For our large plates we had the steak and the scallops. My mouth is watering just thinking about the scallops - served with Brussels sprouts and a delicious butter and sweet citrus sauce. We also had some of the best wine I've had in Raleigh - the 2012 Chaillot Syrah. So smooth! They also brought a taste of champagne at the end of our meal for my birthday.The service is great - our waitress was attentive but not hovering, helpful and knowledgeable, relaxed and nice.

The service was very attentive and the food was all phenomenal. We had the pig face and the arinchini and they were both delicious and good portions for small plates. \u00a0The drinks were very good as well. I had a local beer and my wife had a cocktail that was very well done. The chocolate peanut butter cake dessert was also very tasty."], ["Jennifer M.", "Wow! \u00a0What an experience! \u00a0 First time trying a few foods happened here. \u00a0Bone Marrow was probably the most unique. \u00a0 Tasted good with sides. \u00a0Octopus ceviche was good but very different from a traditional ceviche. \u00a0May not order that again. Clams were buttery. Salmon was so fabulous. We had a few more dishes. Clearly well thought out dishes and created with intention. Great place and want to go back to try more.

They source top quality, fresh and local ingredients, and they aren't afraid to use yummy offal. I love adventure eating, so that was the original draw for me. That and they're right next door to Escazu, which is a holy shrine to all that is great and good in artisanal chocolate. I got hooked when I wandered over in a chocolate endorphin daze and read the menu. Crispy pig's head, sweetbreads and bone marrow? You got me right there.Not every single dish has been a hit for me. A few were either small for the price point or inconsistent on the portions - I got one nearly empty marrow bone while my dining companions got much more generous portions of the same dish - and I didn't quite get the flavor and texture combinations in others. But overall I expect and generally receive excellence from everything I order here. This is some good food, well executed.Stanbury replaces the late, lamented Market by Chad McIntyre, which had a similar fresh, local ingredient ethos and modern pan-Asian to upscale Southern flavors. It is a worthy successor, which is saying quite a lot. \u00a0The space is a bit small and can be crowded and noisy. In warmer weather, outdoor seating is a good bet. The open kitchen is a plus, though, and if you sit where you can watch the chefs working, it can be quite an entertaining and educational show. Do recommend."], ["Ashley Elizabeth H.", "They were ill equipped and the chef line was at best, mediocre. Coughing in his arm, dropping food on the floor. I just wouldn't come here. Texting while cooking is a thing apparently? I did not know. I do not rate places but I can l tell you this place is poorly advertised as amazing. If you're looking for a fast food version of McDonald's then come here.

Which was really sad because I brought my friend here for his birthday. :(I will eat anything edible, and I rarely complain at a restaurant, but every dish here was so salty to the point where it was almost inedible. I think the worst was the charred broccoli. Every bite was a giant salt ocean and the chili sauce just seemed like they spooned it straight out of the sambal olek jar -- which made it even saltier. I tried like 3 pieces to make sure it wasn't just one piece. Nope. Whole dish was a salt mine. Soooooo bad!!!Steak was overcooked but still decent. Salad on the steak was inedible cuz it was so oversalted. Fries were pretty good but again, oversalted.The bread that you pay for is good. But they again hella over salted the butter. Had to scrape like half off.Their old fashioned wasn't that great either considering we're so close to bourbon country. The ambiance here is pretty nice though. They had the most lovely flowers on their outside patio area too. And the server was attentive and she tried to make up for the bad meal by taking an item off the bill."], ["Ela G.", "Oh my god, thank you stanbury! Having just moved from Chicago, it feels good to know I still have some digging to do to find the great restaurant spots like the stanbury. Why? Because well, you won't just stumble across this place! It's well hidden and perhaps so good it's worth keeping a secret;) Everything we had was great.

The bartenders are always fun to watch."], ["Kelsey C.", "I knew I could get good southern cooking in Raleigh, but in recent years, I had feared the fine dining was falling behind. Sure, there are plenty of great southern staples, and standard meats and seafood dishes are solid, but I needed something new, something that pushes the envelope.At first, I wasn't impressed. The Grilled Quail was smothered in BBQ, and it wasn't the good kind of smothered. And I wasn't a fan of the Steak Tartare - the vinaigrette made it taste like it was tossed in ketchup. The sweet butternut squash Crostini with whipped ricotta is an amazing bite of autumn, and the House Made Tagliatelle entree is a winning combination of squash, kale, and pistachio pesto, but I felt like they were playing it safe.The Seared Scallops were another safe option, but they were some of the best seared scallops I've ever had.Fortunately, Stanbury does push the envelope a little. I didn't think I'd ever see Crispy Pig Head being welcome in a city where people told me I was \"exotic\", and the Braised Pig Cheeks had a great tender texture, well-balanced with tart kimchi on crispy, bitter brussel sprouts and soft, chewy mushrooms.I love visiting home, but I need a pretty stiff drink to deal with my family. The Maple Leaf, a burly bourbon, smoothed by maple syrup and frothy egg whites will take the edge off of just about anything, and I imagine the rest of the drinks will too. The desserts are as amazing as the rest of the meal, which is an accomplishment in itself - I feel like most places excel at one or the other, never both. The Apple Tart has a flaky crust and a cinnamon-y, fruity finish. The S'Mores dessert features chocolate between dense cookie-crackers and a marshmallow charred to the max, a campfire favorite with a modern, new-age spin, an amazing end to an amazing meal."], ["Richard K.", "We love Stanbury and always find something unique on the menu to try. Beef marrow on their amazing bread was a treat. The grilled Caesar salad is terrific. Reservations are a must however we sometimes sneak in at 6pm and eat at the bar."], ["Kevin G.", "Ate here on a Wednesday night with my wife and had a great time. We didn't have reservations but we were able to get a table. It was pretty busy and service was slow (we saw two impatient patrons walk out). We first ordered trophy beer and a cab for drinks and then ceviche and the soft shell crab for appetizers. Both dishes were fairly small but packed with flavors. I only got a bite of the ceviche but my wife seemed to really enjoy it. The soft shell crab had a creamy white sauce that went well with the kale. We then ordered a cheese plate and the pigs head. The blue cheese was great, didn't care too much for the NC cheese though. Bolted bread was a great plus! The pigs head was super tasty with a nice mustard flavor. It was pretty heavy but definitely a great choice for an appetizer that will fill you up. We ordered the peach cake for dessert. It was interesting but I felt the bacon ice cream slightly overpowered everything.Overall, an exciting and interesting place for dinner. Our small meal went past $100 so be prepared for that. Also, make reservations or go on an off day. We'll definitely go back for a small meal or on a special occasion!"], ["Jose B.", "Place was unbelievable.

(/Yoda voice)Stanbury is still the most hyped restaurant in Raleigh, and deservedly so. You can actually call to make reservations, but don't be surprised if they are booked a week or two in advance.The restaurant is led by Chef Drew Maykuth, who cooked for four years at one of my favorite restaurants in Asheville, The Admiral. Stanbury's menu has some of the most unique items in Raleigh; You'll find roasted marrow, crispy pig head, and maybe tongue or sweetbreads. Like The Admiral, there's also a lot of seafood. Oysters are a must-do (unless you're allergic to shellfish).I recommend sharing a few small plates and a large plate. The menu rotates frequently based on the seasonal ingredients. They also have some of the best cocktails in Raleigh, and that menu rotates regularly too.In the winter, the place can get a little smoky since they cook with an open kitchen. In the summer, they open up a garage door to their outdoor seating. If you venture outside, don't miss the stencil of Yoda."], ["Laurie V.", "How can I give it anything less than Five Stars? \u00a0Everything from the service to the food to the ambiance was top notch.The decor is simple, yet has a clear-cut theme. \u00a0There are framed croched art pieces. \u00a0There is taxidermy. \u00a0There are red booths. \u00a0There are owls. \u00a0It kind of reminds you of a trip to your Great Aunt and Uncle's basement in 1979. \u00a0All we need to add is a jukebox playing Blondie and maybe a flashing neon \"Bob's Billiards\" sign. \u00a0The Server was really cool, very knowledgeable about the menu, and extremely accomodating. \u00a0The food runner happened to the owner of Escazu Chocolates next door, so she made us a special hot chocolate, since Escazu was closed by the time we had finished eating. \u00a0Way to go above and beyond!Now let me talk about the foooooood. \u00a0Oh my. \u00a0The food.We shared six small plates:Green Beans- \u00a0better than any I've had. \u00a0Al dente. \u00a0Served with smoked blue fish and crispy shallots. \u00a0Smoky and hearty flavor.Steak Tartare- Served with these crab chips that sizzle when they touch your tongue. \u00a0That was the most satisfying tactile experience. \u00a0So deliciously satiating.

Casual and hip ambiance; we hung out until closing because the vibe was so good. Seems to be in the middle-of-nowhere so just follow the GPS."], ["Andre B.", "First of all, they kind of have a strange reservation policy. I called and left a message as instructed. I did receive a call back the next day saying that they were all full for Saturday but based on my requested time, I should get a table based on their first come first served availability. The wife and I had spent the better part of the day in Pinehurst for the US Open and we were borderline hangry. The second strange thing is not knowing Raleigh too well, I had no clue this restaurant was basically in a neighborhood surrounded by houses and apartments. iPhone GPS tells us that we had arrived and we are in somebody's front yard. I double check the address and figure that it's just a few buildings down the road. I was anticipating problems parking on the street but it was a breeze. So we walk in and we are informed that the wait is 30 minutes or so. Looking at the restaurant, that seemed about right, so we decided to wait it out. We had no other plans and there were no nearby restaurants to walk into. We ordered some cocktails from the bar and went to sit on their patio waiting area. I had the Kentucky Handshake which had some minty flavored alcohol called fernet in it. It took some time to get used to as I am not a fan of minty things, but all in all a solid bourbon drink. The wife chose the Louisiana Purchase which was made with brandy and also delicious. We hung out on the patio for maybe 10-15 minutes before a table opened up on said patio. It may have been longer, but time may have flown by as we enjoyed the atmosphere on the cozy patio.As previously stated, we were borderline hangry, so we got 3 small plates to start, the smoked blue fish pate, king salmon crudo and the pig head. The smoked fish pate was first and while it was tasty, the presentation was a little strange for us. The pate itself was drier and grainier than I would have anticipated based on other fish pate experiences. The other strange thing with the dish was that the accompanying bread was heated up. Again, it was tasty and good, but I may venture to other options on the small plates next time. The king salmon crudo was fresh, vibrant and a solid dish. As with most crudo dishes, I wish there was more, but the quality was there. I alone ate the pig head, as the wife has been off pork for a while. The flavor was good, if slightly under seasoned on this occasion, but the perfect duck egg on top made up for it.For mains, oh yeah we kept eating, the wife took the awesome scallops and I got the even more awesome ribeye. We didn't taste any of the other entrees, but I firmly believe that we chose the 2 best ones. The wife's scallops came with some fresh asparagus, farro and best sauce that I can remember paired with scallops. My steak was cooked to perfection and came with smashed smoked fingerling potatoes and grilled broccoli rabe. I was getting stuffed, but I was determined to eat every last bite of that steak.While we looked at the dessert menu, we both decided that a liquid dessert would be more suited. As we are creatures of bourbon, we noticed that the dessert menu had some top shelf, fancy bourbons and proceeded to order a few of those. When I got the bill, I noticed that one of the bourbons was not right on the bill. Our server confirmed that the bill was correct, and that he had misunderstood our order, but he did get us a little taste of bourbon that we originally wanted to try. All in all, it was a perfect end to the evening and with the great atmosphere, service and food, we shall be returning as often as possible.I wish that I had The Stanbury in my neighborhood or a similar restaurant. I can only dream unfortunately."], ["Bo T.", "Most innovative and inspired food in the triangle area.

Stanbury changes it's menu according to season and availability, so some of these items may not always be on the menu. The fried oysters were the best I have had. The flavor was excellent with just the right amount of breading and they were cooked perfectly. The cheese selection featured figs freshly-picked from the tree next to the building and drizzled with a compote. The blue cheese was not overly salty as some blues can be. I am not usually a fan of peppers, but I ate the majority of these! The open-fire roasted flavor was divine. The fried green tomatoes were the best I have had. There was flavor, not too much breading, and they were just tender enough. Delicious. I can't say enough about this place! Two things to note: it is a little pricey (but well worth it), and I have tried to get a table here last-minute with no luck, so I recommend making a reservation."], ["Lavinia N.", "Stanbury is touted by many as \"the best restaurant in Raleigh.\" While I am not totally sure about that particular designation, it is damn good.

I just didn't feel like it was anything I'd never had before. Others have called it \"adventurous,\" but to me the experience didn't feel \"adventurous,\" per se. It DID feel very sturdy, confident, and dependable. I should say upfront that I have eaten at several restaurants with similar menus. So that is just MY experience. If you have never tried pigs head and marrow and that sort of thing, try it here first. They do it right.So, for me, if I want something \"edgy,\" exciting, and innovative...

This meal was amazing. I had heard great things about this restaurant, so tried it for the first time when my family was in town. When i first walked in, I was struck by how casual it was. With how people described it, i thought it would be really fancy inside, but it was casual and welcoming - it reminded me of a barbecue place. The food though was anything but casual. We split about 5 small plates and 2 entrees between 3 of us. They offer lots of small plates and only about 3-4 entrees. The small plates were delicious, Everything from the grilled romaine (sounds boring but is not at all) to the pig head was delicious. My favorite was the pig head appetizer. The beef tar tar was good too. The entrees we tried were their fish and pork The pork dish was out of this world.We had room for dessert as well and got chocolate and an apple dessert. I am picky about my desserts but both blew me away! They also offer some interesting cocktails that were strong but good. All the recommendations were spot on - this restaurant did not disappoint. The service was also great and they could tell you a lot about the dishes. \u00a0It is not cheap but isn't too expensive either. I'd recommend coming with a few people and be prepared to share so you can try as many dishes as possible."], ["Pamela H.", "We were a party of three approximately fifteen minutes early for our reservation and we had to stand awkwardly near the bar while a table was cleared. The bartenders did a fantastic job of ignoring us completely even after eye contact was made. Our table was literally just inside the front door. It was 17 or 18 degrees fahrenheit out and the door was opened frequently. I'm a pretty warm-natured person, so I was not personally uncomfortable, but it was a terrible seating location for someone who booked a reservation well in advance. (- 1 star)Once we were seated, the experience was five stars, all the way. Our server, Mark, was outstanding; I never touched the wine bottle nor did my water glass reach empty. He thoroughly explained every item we had questions about. We ordered an entree of tagliatelle with pistachio pesto, roasted cauliflower, beef tartare, crispy pig head, a toad in the hole, and roasted marrow. Everything was amazing. The only thing I didn't care for was the crispy pig head and that's all me. I'm not a big fan of heavily smoked food and the meat was very, very smoky. The blend of flavors and textures on the plate were great and would have been considered exceptional by someone who enjoys strong smoky flavor in their meat more.The marrow was exquisite. There's really no other word for it. Every single bite was like putting heaven in my mouth. This was by far my favorite dish.We shared a dessert of chocolate malt creme brulee and the groans of pleasure were downright indecent.Three people, six plates, one beer, one bottle of wine, and one dessert, $120 before tip. Not bad at all for the quality of the ingredients and preparation.I will definitely be back. I will make a reservation and try not to be too early, and I will ask to not be too near the front door, but I will definitely be back."], ["Alicia K.", "Super not kid friendly restaurant. If Michelin star restaurants can offer high chairs, I see no reason why this restaurant can't. I'm from Singapore and if DB Bistro by Daniel Boulud and Bread St Kitchen by Gordon Ramsay can welcome babies, why can't Stanbury? It's not fine dining, neither is the restaurant too posh or in an exquisite setting that warrants basically turning families with young children away. If that's the case you should put a big sign on your front door saying no babies. This restaurant serves tapas style dishes, and the setting is casual. So it just seems like they are trying to be fancier than what it really is. We sat to try and finish our meal despite the guy at the front telling us they don't provide high chairs, in hindsight we should have just left. Servers were not friendly or understanding about our situation with our 7month old baby rolling around in the booth, they simply ignored her presence, served our food without any kind of interaction of sorts like how a normal friendly server should be. Overall it was an unpleasant experience. The food was good, not great. Masked by presentation, the beef tartare was heavy handedly seasoned with a lot of Indian inspired spices that overwhelmed the beef itself. The crispy pig head was a patty of shredded pork. Smoked duck was tough. Bone marrow was good but I've had better. The food at this restaurant had pretty looking plates but I think a true foodie would agree with me that it's not that amazing when you see past the presentation.

Tucked away in an unassuming strip mall next to a beauty supply store the only hint that this place might be special is the sign on the door advising reservations.

Not good for groups."], ["Jenny Y.", "We had a reservation on a beautiful Saturday evening. We walked into the restaurant nestled into a strip mall and were seated promptly. The dining room is small and cozy. The decorations look a bit cheap and sparse, but that's not why we're here is it? The server greeted us quickly and warmly. She was forthcoming with recommendations and such a warm character. Based on her recommendations and having read the reviews, we ordered:Trio of Ceviche: Beautiful, excellent serving size. Enough for about 3-4 big bites per ceviche. I personally thought this was a bit too strong and would've done well to been better balanced. The acidity was pretty good, but it was also very heavily salted.The only one not suffering from this was the shrimp ceviche, which was by far my favorite and I would love to order again.Lomo Saltado with Tacu Tacu: The meat was seasoned well and tender enough. It melt in your mouth, it had good chew. But it suited the dish fine. The flavor was on point. The tacu tacu was truly gigantic and honestly way too big and filling. It was really delicious for the first few bites, but quickly became a bit too much. I honestly think rice is better to soak up the sauces.Picante de Camarones: The sauce on this was AMAZING. We dipped the fries from the Lomo Saltado and ate a lot of the tacu tacu \u00a0in this sauce. Highly recommended. Rice Pudding: This was awesome. It was not too sweet, and just enough cinnamon. Truly well done rice pudding.Finally, i will note that our server got 2 orders wrong, and forgot things multiple times. We thought she was wonderfully friendly and she was happy to correct the mistakes she made, but I did want to note how many there were."], ["MariaTeresa L.", "THE WORSE PERUVIAN RESTAURANT, THE WORSE PERUVIAN EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD! I am from Peru, born in Trujillo and Lived in my country for 21 years.. Ever since I moved to the US, I have had the opportunity to live in a few different States and cities across the US and have also visited lots of other beautiful cities as well their restaurants. With that being said, it pains me to say that this restaurant has been The Worse \u00a0Peruvian Food restaurant out of all of the many other Peruvian Restaurants I have ever tried in the US before and I mean from WI to DC to VA to PA to FL to CA and NC... The only reason why I went to this restaurant tonight is because of the great reviews and I thought it would be delicious! Boy was I wrong!!!! I should have stuck with my fav Peruvian restaurant in Chapel Hill \"Mi Peru\" that is really a great restaurant and they really try to imitate the flavors the best the can. This MachuPicchu restaurant was awful! Huancaina sauce is not made with cilantro or huacatay leaves!! The sauce was green and the American waitress who has never been in my country wanted to school me!!!! SERIOUSLY?!!! The CEVICHE WAS DISGUSTING! People, trust Me, how can you screw Peruvian ceviche! Its one of out staples!!! My husband who is an American, tried it and couldn't believe it either!! Tasted like they used lime juice that comes already squeezed in those container shaped like a lime! The aji de gallina, one of my hubby's favorite, had the same \"green Huancaina sauce\" in it... SO WRONG!!! The Tamalito Verde was as bad as everything else... I was looking forward to it... Even the sweet potatoe and peruvian corn that came with the ceviche were gross... The worse part is that I brought my some of my American family with Me cause I wanted them to try some amazing food and this restaurant ruined it for Me... I heard that \"The Chefs\" were Peruvian too!!! What's wrong with them then? The stupid excuse I always get is... We have to tweak it for the American people... FLASH NEWS \"CHEFS\" NO YOU DONT!!! This people want to have the Peruvian experience!!! Our food is not spicy... Its flavorful and you can add the spice to it if you want! Americans need to be educated and learn what Peruvian food is all about... The flavors are amazing! This people eat Indian, Thai, Korean, Mexican food already!!! Peru is the Number 1 culinary destination in the world again this year! I recommend you rethink your crappy recipes because the FOOD SUCKED SO BAD!!!!! Shame on You people!!! NEVER GOING BACK ! I have a stomach ache thanks to the crap you fed me and terrible service btw!!!"], ["Alex Q.", "After reading some of the reviews my wife and I decided to try this place - she is of Peruvian dissent and ever since moving to the Triangle, we have been trying hard to find a good Peruvian spot that isn't Mami Nora's. \u00a0Machu Pichu claims to be authentic - sadly, it was far from it. For an appetizer, we ordered Papa a la Huancaina and for our entr\u00e9es, I had the Sec\u00f3 de Res which is a Peruvian style beef stew and my wife had Pescado a la Chorrillana - a spicy and flavorful fish fry. Being that these dishes are staples of Peruvian culture and food, it was a very good way to gauge this place because if they screw these up, then the rest of them can't be very good.Well, they were screwed up alright. The Papa a la Huancaina comes with a yellow sauce that is usually thick, spicy and tastes cheesy. Instead what we received was a brown sauce that you normally find in a chicken dish - totally off target. Then the entr\u00e9es came out - I was willing to let the appetizer slide if the entr\u00e9es were at least decent - not even close. My wife's dish is supposed to be crispy on both sides and it wasn't - in fact, the bottom of the fish had not been cooked all the way. I'm surprised she didn't get sick. \u00a0For my dish, the meat was tough - it is supposed to be tender.Then came the ultimate insult - my mother-in-law prides herself on homemade hot sauce - we know what it supposed to look like and taste like. \u00a0So we asked our server if they had any and he replied yes - the rocotto - a spicy red pepper sauce. He went on to tell me that I was going to love it since it was a homemade recipe and they made it fresh every day. \u00a0I don't know what I was thinking when I got excited when I heard rocotto was available. \u00a0The rest of the \"authentic\" food was far from it so I should've known better than to expect that this would be. When the server brought it to us, we looked at it, waited until he walked away, looked at each other, shook our heads and started to laugh. \u00a0What he had actually brought us was nothing more than what you are supposed to use as the base to a homemade sauce - it comes in a jar - nothing homemade about that. \u00a0I wasn't mad at the server though, I'm pretty sure this is what the owners had told him.The sad part about this whole experience is that our service was impeccable. \u00a0It's really a shame because I would have given this place a five star review has the food been good. \u00a0In fact, the only thing stopping me from giving this place a one star rating is the fact that the service was so great - so I decided to give it two stars. Otherwise, I have a real problem with a place that claims to be authentic but is far from it while charging top dollar for it. After eating here, I would guess that people that have given this place a good review probably don't know what true, authentic Peruvian food is. I believe you'd be better served by going to Mami Nora's in Raleigh (which is ok - not great) and having any of their dishes. You'll spend about half the money if not less."], ["Danielle H.", "Hubby and I were looking for something quick and delicious and ran across this restaurant! New to Raleigh we were excited to experience cuisine outside of the typical southern food one would come to expect! The service was great, we were seated right away and our server was very attentive.

It threw me off a bit that it was in a strip mall - and the decor was kind of Bare- however the food speaks for itself. So authentic and fresh! The cook clearly prides herself on a great meal!

There's a few ways of making it, all of which still taste amazing. \u00a0Machu-pichu's version was bitter, not at all cheesy, and stale; as a matter a fact, it's the wrong sauce all together. For my entr\u00e9e, i took the risk of ordering pescado ala chorillana, boy was i let down. One thing that has always been common, is when any fish dish is made, it will never taste \"fishy\" - I hate \"fishy\"!!!!! This dish is suppose to be pan fried lightly breaded fish in a soy sauce, lemony sauce that has saut\u00e9ed onions and tomato, still perfectly crisp and a deep fried half potato. Just thinking about makes my mouth water. Their version didn't pull through. The fish was under cooked, the onions and tomatoes were soggy, and worst of all it was fishy tasting.

The directions on their website are helpful. Tons of parking available in the lot. Came here on a weekday night and there were hardly any people, yet a bunch of tables said \"reserved\" (never saw these tables filled, and I stayed until closing). Small place but great decor - love that the napkin is rolled up like a volcano with a flame emitting, adds a nice fancy touch to the place. Staff is super nice and helpful. The chef even came out to chat and shared his background.Chicha Morada ($2.25) - \"The National Peruvian refreshment,\" a healthy beverage made from Andean purple corn, fresh fruits, and spices. Purple corn is believed to lower cholesterol and fight obesity due to the 6% Anthocyanin, a powerful antioxidant. Amazing drink - thicker than typical juice from the grocery store, but easy to drink the whole thing in a matter of seconds because it's SO DELICIOUS! Looks like dark cranberry/plum juice, tastes mildly sweet and addicting. Definitely recommend - yum!Before your meal arrives, you'll receive a tiny container of complimentary kernels. They're large and look like they've been roasted, but they're dry. Didn't care much for these.Jalea ($18.95) - a medley of lightly battered, deep fried fish and shellfish, served hot in a bed of lettuce, fried yuccas (similar to cactus plant, starchy and tastes similar to potato), and topped with a sauce made of diced onions, diced tomatoes, and chopped cilantro with lime juice and spices. Apparently there's a \"large\" version \"for 2\" available for $25.95, but I must warn all of you out there: the regular size is GIGANTIC!!! I was entirely shocked when I realized the entire mountain was all mine. Still, I managed to finish it all - I don't believe in wasting excellent food! It's beautiful, refreshing, and filling. The lime is VERY strong though, too much citrus. Almost like a healthy salad supreme, minus the deep fried fish, calamari, shrimp..... \u00a0 Mazamorra Morada ($6) - Peruvian purple pudding-like dessert, made with purple corn drink, fresh fruits, and spices, thickened. Sprinkled with cinnamon, contains no dairy products. This is definitely different.

I am shocked to see it get 4. Really, there is no accounting for mediocre taste. My wife and I met one day for lunch a few months ago in the Spring of 2012, so this is a delayed review, and to our dismay we learned that bonefish grill in the same strip center is closed for lunch, so we wandered around. Panera? No. Want something more special. Starbucks? No. Same reason and packed. Mid-town Grill. We looked the menu over. \u00a0Empty and available and seemed pleasant and not a chain so why not because you never know what a non-chain could surprise you with. It was actually so empty that it gave us pause as sometimes places are empty while nearby places are overflowing for a very good reason.It was overall pretty disappointing to ME (see last paragraph). The service was....I wouldn't say 'Bad' ... so much as it seemed like the owners had no idea how to run a restaurant or train their servers...I would say it was very haphazard...the server seemed to have no idea what they had to offer, what was available, what wasn't, what order to bring food to us in, when to refill a drink and it wasn't that she was lazy, overwhelmed or anything. She was doing her best, she just seemed completely untrained but also as if this was not her first day on the job. When we walked in it was dead (more on that later). We felt depressed a place could be so empty except for us and two little old ladies. The server was just untrained and seemed to have no direction.Moving along, the food was very forgettable. All I can recall is that the entree had strips of roasted red peppers and that sold me. When it came and I tasted them, I almost laughed. They weren't LIKE the tasteless red pepper strips i had once purchased at BJ's wholesale club. They WERE the tasteless red pepper stripsfrom BJ's wholesale club. Lacked texture and flavor and the cook made zero attempt to add anything to them, other than that they were totally forgettable.I looked around to see I was one of two males after about a half hour and just figured this is one of those places the ladies who go to lunch go to. And then to my amazement, as the lunch hour wore on, this place began to fill...and fill... and fill... Business people, all kinds of people. Look, in all sincerity,in this rotten economy, if a solo (non-chain) restaurant can make a profit, I really don't care if my review goes unheeded, more power to them. People seem to like it, but it isn't a place I would think of returning to. It wasn't bad, it's just not worth a 2nd trip to me. But if they are profitable, God bless 'em.

Our server was very attentive, but not too attentive either, she gave us our space; but when we needed something, she was nearby! \u00a0The other staff was very friendly not only to each other but to all of the customers, even if they weren't waiting on them, they seemed to know the 'regulars' and would stop by to speak to them but were not intrusive either. \u00a0The ambience was great, it is a simply beautiful restaurant that is tastefully decorated. \u00a0I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great meal for a special occasion."]], "Latin Quarters": [["G.

The decor is nothing too fancy but nice inside. They had a reception of some sort on one half of the restaurant, which we actually enjoyed because they had a great Spanish band. The service was timely, and our server was very friendly. We asked his opinion on some of the menu items and he was honest about what he liked and what was popular. We had an appetizer that was dried plantains with ceviche on top! It was delicious and a good portion size! My friend had a tamale dish and I had Arroz con pollo. Both were beautifully presented and huge portions! The Arroz con pollo was enough for me to have at least 4 meals!! They were both also very tasty! During our meal a nice gentleman (who must have been either the owner or manager) came by to check on us. He then came by at the end of the meal to make sure we enjoyed everything. What we found to be most amazing was that he actually asked if we had any feedback or suggestions....it showed they really want you to leave happy and are open to customers opinions. I've never had anyone do that...and I worked in the service industry for over 10 years! I will absolutely return!"], ["Ronny B.", "My wife and I went back in the spring and were not just disappointed, but enraged. \u00a0It was a week night and all customers were crowded over in a single section, and the noise level was terrible due to the live/karaoke singer. \u00a0My pork chop was burned to a crisp, less than a third of it was chewable at all. \u00a0Wife's beans and rice were very average, and were the highlight of the meal. \u00a0The waiter was inattentive and unconcerned about it, and appeared very inexperienced, like maybe he was one of the waitresses' boyfriend who just happened to be there. \u00a0In fact there seemed to be no real adults about on this particular night. \u00a0It took two reminders just to get a beer. \u00a0When we were finally served, the entree came out first, and was cold. \u00a0The empenadas came out later and were hot. \u00a0I asked the waiter if he knew the order in which a meal was supposed to be served and he blamed the kitchen. \u00a0This may have been part of the problem, as there was no food being served for a long time, then a lot all at once, but our waiter and other staff seemed to be doing a lot of aimless wandering about. \u00a0I did not send the appetizer back because that was the only thing that was edible. \u00a0Did I mention that it took forever to get attention/service/drinks/food/water? \u00a0The sole reason that I did not make a scene and walk was that I was there on a Groupon and so was already invested. \u00a0I had a rather firm conversation with the waiter when it came time to pay up, but did not stiff him by any means, as I have worked in enough bars and restaurants myself to know that he was not the entire problem. \u00a0No one would admit to being the manager. \u00a0I certainly have not been back and, in order to avoid getting caught up in any similar situation, I have not bought a Groupon since, nor will I. \u00a0I used to travel a lot in my work and am an experienced diner, and this was without doubt the worst experience I ever had in a restaurant."], ["Erica S.", "So, LQ is definitely sub par. I wasn't expecting it to be like Marmalade in San Juan, but for a mid-priced establishment it was disappointing. The friendly staff is their saving grace. In a fair review, upon being seated I was directed to a dirty booth that had not been cleaned. So she promptly directed me to another. I ordered the empanadas for a starter. They are good, decent even, but then I cut into one only to find a bone ... about an inch long. Thank goodness I eat with a knife and fork. A child could easily choke on something like that.Meanwhile, my entree came out and the servings are large ... but the chicken tasted like rubber and it was not seasoned... very bland. The rice was good, and the plantains were decent. The staff has clearly not been trained, given the server removed none of the plates from my table. Instead they were allowed to pile up. Finally I ordered dessert. Big mistake. The portion is huge, but it is very heavy in terms of consistency. I prefer a light and fluffy tres leches. This was not the case. Unfortunately, the food is sub par and it did not feel like a clean establishment. Will not return."], ["E S.", "Great service, great food.

What a delicious adventure;"], ["Steve P.", "We went for lunch on a Sunday to give Latin Quarter a try. We didn't know there was mainly a buffet on Sunday lunch. When we first got there, we were told by the host that it was buffet only but they had their best dishes out on the buffet. I thought I'd give it a try even though I am not a great fan of buffets. My friend looked at the buffet then begged to order off the menu. I wish I did the same. However, I tried his chicken & it wasn't much better than what I got off the buffet for less money. He got a lime marinated chicken that was pounded very thin & grilled with onions. It had a nice flavor but I thought it was cooked a little too much leaving it a bit dry. I got a variety of things off the buffet. Unfortunately, they weren't labeled so I'm not sure what to call most of the dishes. There was a sausage that tasted like a typical smoked sausage. There was a bland potato dish that I tried 1 bite of & threw away. The fried bananas were good. The pulled pork was seasoned well but was loaded with large chunks of fat which I left on the plate. There were fried fish pieces that were a little over cooked & dry. There were chicken tenders that were pounded flat & crispy but were cooked in the same oil as the fish & tasted of fish. There were 3 types of rice. The one I tried had a few shrimp in it but the shrimp were over cooked and hard. The rice was pretty bland. I tried the red beans, which were very soupy, and not very flavorful. This wasn't a very good dining experience. I usually try to go a few times to a restaurant before writing a review, but this is going to be a single visit restaurant."], ["Stephalie C.", "I really enjoyed this place .. I've always refused to spend money on Spanish food because my grandmother has the best cooking but this place is worth it !! super flavorful !! will stop by again"], ["Allyson S.", "I want to give another kudos to Latin Quarters. Since I posted my first review two weeks ago, we've been back three more times. Each time we have tried different menu items, and have enjoyed the authenticity of their cuisine, Puerto Rican, specifically. These owners go out of their way to make you a satisfied customer. On our first return trip following my review, the owner Julio came out to our table and spent several minutes talking to me and my husband, expressing his gratitude for our business. And at the end of our meal he treated us to desert and took a percentage off our bill. He didn't have to do that, but he did because he cares about his patrons and is a smart businessman. Do not go to Latin Quarters with the expectation of having your food prepared as Americans would prepare it, and then complain when it's different. It's ethnic cuisine, it's supposed to be different. Enjoy it for what it is - bursting with flavors that most of us cannot mimic in our own kitchens.And no, I don't know the owners, and there was no incentive to write this follow-up. I just appreciate what they're doing in their kitchen, and want people to understand that what they are creating at LQ is very specific to their culture, and is not meant to resemble ours. So go and enjoy!"], ["Julio V.", "Been here twice and had two meals that reminded me quite a bit of my mom's cooking. Very authentic Puerto Rican fare and the drinks were marvelous. It's difficult to do Puerto Rican food well consistently and I've not been disappointed yet. Definitely will return and I plan on trying everything on the menu. It's quickly become one of my favorite spots."], ["Charles M.", "We sampled across the menu; steak, chicken & pork based on our waitress' recommendations. It was GREAT. \u00a0Good food, good drinks, good music, good service. \u00a0Nice way to spend an evening."], ["Carolina R.", "Had dinner at this place a couple nights ago and was disappointed, mainly because I grew up in South America and have high standards for food from my area. It says on Yelp that it has Argentinean food but I only saw one Argentinean item on the menu (the choripan). I tried to get morcilla but they didn't even know what that was. The Drinks: The mojitos were expensive and weak. The Food: As an appetizer, we ordered the ceviche with the tostones. That was probably the only dish I liked. It was a bit expensive ($11) but the portion was generous and fresh. We shared the mofongo with fried pork. The mofongo was alright but the pork chop was tough and dry. For a Latin American/Caribbean place, they should really know how to cook meat!The Service: The server was polite but a terrible communicator. For example, we asked for the mofongo with the fried pork, but instead of fried pork morsels, he brought a pork chop. We ordered a side of chicharron, which he should know are pork rinds, but instead he brought another pork chop. He told us that is how they make chicharron at Latin Quarters. The side pork chop cost 8 dollars, and we felt bad about sending it back, so we paid for it and took it home. Conclusion: If you are Latino or Caribbean, you will know this place is not the real deal. I was surprised to find out that the owner is actually puerto rican. Tips: if you order the mofongo, that's a dish to share. The ceviche with the tostones is actually quite large for an appetizer. Don't get the mojito unless you're a light weight. Ask that they cook the meet medium or medium rare if you order beef."], ["Jose V.", "The food was incredible, the atmosphere was comfortable, drinks were great and just an overall great vibe, a great chill spot!!!"], ["Holly R.", "Moving to NC from NY and finding an authentic PR restaurant was exciting.

I think the insides have been under renovation since the roughly 2 years ago we last went. \u00a0We were virtually the only customers there. \u00a0The fries were very good. \u00a0The steak in the sandwich could not be cut with human teeth while in a sandwich- we both had to pull the steak out of our sandwiches and eat it separately, \u00a0The server was courteous and a waitress not waiting on us was very kindly sociable. \u00a0Our server tried to be very upscale- acting, meanwhile the friendly one who was working on processing a check right beside our table called over to someone else asking her if she knew how to do a certain type of transaction, almost standing over us. \u00a0The amount of salt in the food had me up in the middle of the night, however many restaurants do the same. \u00a0The quality and quantity and value were just as the 2 star descriptions says.... Meh, I've experienced better. \u00a0Doubt I would go there without a coupon in hand, but there was no disrespect shown on account of the coupon, as you occasionally will read is the case with restaurants."], ["Tina G.", "Everything we ate tonight was excellent. Definetely coming back for sure. The pork chop was hugh and very tasty, the Ceveche was extremly fresh, and the steak beans and rice were prepared to perfection. The atmosphere was very casual.

Can't wait to come back."], ["Massimiliano C.", "First of all, I know puerto rican food pretty good, I travel to Puerto Rico often and I'm from Panama. Let me start with the mofongo. This is a difficult dish to acomplish, is like what Pizza is for Italians. It was good, not dry, moist. Big portion. I ordered with pernil and it was also very good. El pastelon, I didn't like it much, but everybody has a different taste. The alcapurria was good too. Last, the tres leches, I was probably expecting something a little bit different. Take in consideration, this dessert is at the base of a long time dispute between different countries saying is their tipical dessert. That means different versions. Service was very good. My only critic is the place. Maybe just a quick makeover to the tables, chairs and ambiance will make it a 5 star. And the smell of cleaning products was overwhelming. Overall good and I will be back."]], "Rancho Grande": [["Mary A.", "Simply awesome food. This place is as good as it gets if you're looking for great Mexican food.

That's just the start as the rest of the menu is great too!"], ["Geoff G.", "Definitely one of my favorite taquerias in cary/raleigh. The goat is outstanding, as is the lengua and cabeza. Believe it or not the reconstituted pork skin tacos were REALLY good here. They always have ceviche but the weekend is the time to go for more options. I rather prefer the ceviche de pulpo. Too, be sure and try the whole fried tilapia. Almost as good as at Los Comales!You're definitely not going to want to take a prom date here. But I took my brother and his family from out of town over the weekend and they loved it. The fixin's bar has a lot to offer and the hot sauces are VERY good. Salsa picante is fresh and just spicy enough.Pupusas, gorditas, tamales are all delicious here; but be forewarned that the tamales are cooked bone-in (read my dental review from earlier; it happens). Great tortas as well.Not a big fan of their horchata, and I love horchata.Finally, the family that runs this place could NOT be nicer. Even if it's your first time in an authentic taqueria, don't be timid; the couple speaks enough english to walk you through the menu and get you where you need to be: delicious town!"], ["Justin P.", "At some Mexican restaurants, I get a burrito and at other places I will get enchiladas. However Rancho Grande is where I get my taco fix. There are many different options and combinations of tacos to choose from, but I always get the steak tacos or in Spanish, Asada. I am able to get 2 of 3 tacos because an individual taco isn't too expensive. It's like $1.50 for each. When they give you your taco, it is just plain. However you can go to the salsa bar and add some tomatoes or lime to your taco. I eat my taco plain and I still think it tastes great! The steak was tender, juicy, and well seasoned. It was a perfect taco. I also love drinking their Horchata. Horchata is a rice drink that is very sweet with a hint of cinnamon. They make their Horchata extra sweet. Although on the outside, Rancho Grande doesn't look like a restaurant, the inside is a great place to get some tacos!"], ["Amy B.", "Yum! \u00a0Great food at a great price. \u00a0Friendly service, and a very very clean kitchen. \u00a0I always have had a good experience here. \u00a0Love this place!"]], "Oakwood Caf\u00e9": []}
