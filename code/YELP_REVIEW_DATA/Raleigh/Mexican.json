The food itself is good but the price for add-ons and the amount of some of the portions really make me hesitant to ever come back here. \u00a0Chips and salsa is practically a commodity at Gringo. \u00a0There is a charge for them, which okay a couple of other places now charge for chips and salsa so I understand that, but the quantity is just not enough for four people. \u00a0My table ordered the peanut salsa and pico de gallo. \u00a0Well, I am allergic to peanuts so I was limited to just the pico and unfortunately there wasn't enough to go around. \u00a0It looked as though we were given 1, maybe 2, tablespoons full of pico de gallo. \u00a0We had to ration it out so as to make sure that everybody got a little taste. \u00a0The next issue I had was with the entrees. \u00a0I ordered three tacos (and though seasoned to perfection) they had no fillings or anything else on them. \u00a0Then I found out that for an additional fee I could have a plate of toppings to go with my tacos. \u00a0When I order tacos I want them to be already topped with fresh ingredients and I think that many people would agree with that. \u00a0That paired with my previous encounter of an up-charge for salsa motivated me to just eat them as is with no additions.There has been a lot of talk about Gringo since it opened but for me it just wasn't worth it and I doubt that I will go again."], ["Natalie G.", "Holy guacamole (which, at this particular restaurant, is essentially a smashed half of avocado that is garnished with slices of radish).

The portion is fairly sizeable, and they have a vegan chicken option as well. Of the five of us, three got the chilaquiles, the fourth some asada tacos (she seemed pretty happy with them, and the fifth had \"pretty standard\" quesadillas.

They seemed to be lacking both authentic Mexican favorites and Tex Mex favorites like Queso. Great flavors in the meats and some of the pickled veggies, but some were straight vinegar. Yet, I was left kinda confused by the concept. You also have to order taco condiments seperately. Ours arrived long after our tacos. I think the server forgot. He also rubbed me the wrong way, was very pushy to upsell. We just wanted water to begin with and we felt pretty insulted we he said \"that's it\". To top off the night, I am pretty sure that the waiter stole my my credit card info. He claimed the credit card processor was down and took an unusually long time typing cc info in an iPad. When I noticed him turning the card around to get the cvc code, I addressed him and asked what software he was using and why he was looking at the back of the card. He could not explain or show me the iPad. Sure enough my debit card was run up over the next few hours.

I am obsessed with good Mexican so when we saw it we decided to give up downtown for the night and try it out. Best decision ever. We have yet to find a good Mexican restaurant in Raleigh. I knew from the moment we walked in that it was going to be spectacular. Very unassuming space, but very friendly staff and cozy decor. It was too hot to sit outside, but I can see when it gets cooler that I will be enjoying many margaritas out on the porch. Alberto greeted us and was an amazing waiter. We both ordered margaritas and chips/guac to start, and we were happy to notice that they didn't ask us any questions about how we wanted our margs made (salt, on the rocks). A good sign. The guac and chips came out and they were out of this world. The only place I have had fresh chips in Raleigh (FRESH as in tortillas that are cut, then fried) are at my brother's house. It did not disappoint. We ended up ordering 2 more salsas (sesame which was amazing but too spicy for me, and pico which was great). My husband ordered 3 tacos and I ordered 2 as well as the condiment tray. The highlight for me was the carnitas and surprisingly the pollo. We left way too full but so excited that we had found this right down the street. I have no idea why we haven't heard of it before. I'm torn between announcing it to the world and keeping it to myself. But I think I will do everyone else a favor and spread the word. GO TO GRINGO A GO GO!!!!!"], ["Erin W.", "My visit to Gringo was as part of a multi-stop 'rolling' birthday party. We trooped in around 6 and filled the back of the restaurant. We had to move some tables together (despite the barkeep saying that he didn't really want us to for some reason) to seat all 12 or so of us. So first, the dirt... literally...I just wrote a whole paragraph on the bathroom smell and ants we encountered and then deleted it because I thought it was too mean.Beyond that though, the food is fine. I had the carnitas and carne asada tacos. Both fine, but the carnitas lacked citrus (sweet acid) and the carne lacked sear (meaty satisfaction). The guacamole (creamy!), chipotle (smoky!), habenero (OMGSPICY!) and pico de gallo (refreshing!) dips were all very nice. Margaritas were great too (but expensive).Our server also did a great job with refilling our waters and chip baskets. We did have an order screw-up (par for a table of our size and it was fixed pronto).It's definitely a little more rough than Centro or Calavera but I suppose it is worth a try for people who are downtown and looking for a new Mexican food option. I see it's value as a spot for some drinks / chips and salsa before moving on elsewhere."], ["Christie M.", "We were so excited to try this place - but left before we got to experience the food. We went on a Wednesday night for a special occassion with an almost 2 year old. My husband had flowers for me and a card...and a bag of chick-fil-a for our son. He sat for 10 minutes before being approached by a waiter, and was then told that we couldn't bring in any outside food (even if it was for a child). My husband asked about drink specials...and the waiter told him the food specials. He didn't even have a menu yet. The moral of the story is - that we left. The food might be delicious, but we will never know. (btw...our son has food allergies so I bring food with me to make sure that he is accommodated, especially since there is no kids menu posted).

I lived in Texas for more than 10 years and have been to Mexico several times. I have never been to a Mexican restaurant that charges for salsa and condiments (condiments were a small plate of a small amount of grilled onions, pickled vegetables, and mostly jalapenos) and only provides cilantro and onions in its tacos (other than the meat or vegan meat you order) as fillings. I can understand places that make their own chips charging for chips, but to charge for salsa on a taco?? There are no rice and beans or avocado as sides, and the tacos are very small, as you can imagine, as they have no fillings! Also, they do not make the tortillas on site (they are homemade, just not by them, which is pretty misleading). Additionally, although there were few customers when we went for lunch last week, service was pretty bad--had to ask numerous times for more water. Maybe the burrito is the way to go here, as it seems to include more food and you don't get nickle and dimed. Very disappointing experience."], ["Jessie W.", "There are no words to describe the deliciousness! Tacos Pastor...um...YES!Wonderful service! Great atmosphere! Very affordable!"], ["Jay W.", "Sometimes you have to treat a restaurant like a relationship. First impressions mean everything and it's equally important to be patient and attentive to the flow of the relationship. In this sense, I was moderately impressed wit Gringo when they soft-opened months ago. I could tell that there were some managerial and culinary changes that needed made, but something about the place told me to give it more than a chance. So I became a regular. See, I love tacos. If I could eat several tacos three times a day and remain healthy, I would sell all of my silverware and tuck right in to some corn tortilla magic. I came back every week or so and I noticed that the things I see complained about in other reviews are quietly being dealt with professionally and deliciously. So what do I love about gringo?- Al Pastor. Perfectly seasoned and just the right amount of pineapple to balance the salty and savory. \u00a0- guacamole. You get one avocado for $5. That's a standard serving and an appropriate mark-up in the restaurant biz (and yes, I'm i am in it). It's not overly garlicky or limey, but you can always squeeze citrus to taste. - Carnitas. It's got a great fat to lean ratio. Let's not forget that this is pork and one of the best ways to keep pork delectable is to leave the fat. Gringo does that quite well. I have YET to be left wanting after ordering two of the carnitas tacos. And lastly, when you come to Gringo, you're dealing with a man's long-standing dream. Benji has been making food for years. He opened Lilly's Pizza back in the day. He knows his way around a pizza oven, but he FEELS the Mexican cuisine. And that's the run for me. Nothing in this world is perfect, but what is happening and what is ABOUT to happen at Gringo is pretty damned close. My only issues on a day-to-day taco addict front would be service. Hire some people with experience and personality who WANT to sell tacos and chilaquiles. They've got a few strong servers now and I am sure that they'll find more."], ["Shannon A.", "I had heard about Gringo's for a few weeks.

We grabbed a table and our server came back pretty quickly. We ordered some margaritas which were not too sweet and not too sour, and they were yummy!We started with the chips and guacamole. The chips weren't very salty and immediately felt more healthy than downing a ton of chips at other Mexican restaurants. The guac was super fresh too!I LOVE that the menu includes vegan beef and vegan chicken so I was pleased as pie! I'd love to tell you what the name of my meal was but I have no clue. It was tortilla pieces covered with a tomatilla sauce with vegan chicken. It was scrumptious and a huge portion.

That makes this place a good option when the parents want some authentic Mexican food that their kids are unlikely to touch.

Firstly, I go to this place weekly, sometimes twice, and have been doing so for over a year now. It's safe to say I have tried almost the entire menu and can give a thorough review. I apologize for the length of this review but I think it is necessary in order to clear the air. I will begin with what is most important, the food. The carne asade tacos with guacamole and pico de gallo are to die for. Tender meat, well seasoned and for just a little over $5, you can't beat it. Their chicken, adobado, chicharron and carnitas are all good. Not to mention, they pack their tacos full of meat! I consider myself a hefty eater and just 2 of these things at lunch is more than enough. If I get the tacos with cilantro and onions then I get 3 because they are slightly smaller. Their shredded beef burritos knock it out of the park! I hate filler items in burritos, i.e. rice, beans, lettuce, etc. If I wanted carbs on carbs then I would just eat a loaf of bread. What you get in a shredded beef burrito is meat, peppers and onions, and pico de gallo, YUMMY! If you get a green chile burrito then it will be pork carnitas and verde sauce, that's it. Speaking of green chile, I eat, literal, bowlfuls of the stuff. I get the green chili plate, minus the rice and beans and it is $5.99 for, well over, a pound of green chile. Their menudo is awesome and for first timers, I always recommend the shredded beef gorditas. It amazes me I don't see more people get these stuffed pockets of heaven. The only thing that I don't really care for from here is their fish tacos. With that said, I believe that all of the other food is so good that I can overlook that fact. If fish or shrimp tacos are your thing then go to Chubby's or the Flying Burrito. As far as the woman at the desk being \"rude,\" as I have seen some people say, she isn't. English is not her first language so she isn't going to have a 5 minute conversation with you. I go there often so she knows me by name. She is really polite, in all actuality. Anything special you want she is more than willing to accommodate you. For example, I love pico de gallo and guacamole with my carne asada fries. If you simply ask, she will give some cups of it at no charge. I also said earlier I don't get rice and beans with my green chile plate and she knocks off $2.50 because of it. In conclusion, she is very nice, just don't expect her to greet you as most Southerners do with a warm welcome. Furthermore, their salsa bar is amazing. This is the only place in Raleigh that actually has HOT salsas. If you don't like it spicy then you may not want to eat here. They have pickled jalapenos, onions and carrots that are made in house and I have never seen any other Mexican place serve (except in actual Mexico). I can eat an entire bowl of just that. They also serve cucumbers at the salsa bar which traditionally is used to soothe the spiciness of food. If you're not getting cucumbers, you're doing it wrong. Finally, someone said \"If this place is so good, and gets all these great ratings, how come no one is eating there!?\" Because restaurants aren't packed everyday, all the time. I was just in there today (12/22/14) for lunch and couldn't even get a seat; I ordered it to-go, instead. Honestly, I have noticed hits and misses when it's crowded and when it's not. Sometimes I go in and it is just me, other times it was like today and I have to take it to-go. I don't think you can judge a restaurant on the fact of how many people were in there at the time you dined. One last note, a majority of the people I see in there are Latino's and if anyone knows GOOD Mexican food, it would be them."], ["Micah D.", "Definitely not like CA carne asada fries, but it will do. I wasn't jumping up and down. The price is about the same in CA. Drinks are a bit pricey. Overall, eh. Bland but good enough to eat when I miss CA carne asada fries."], ["Keith C.", "There's little reason to go to Taco Bell if you're looking for cheap Mexican food. Los Cuates has you covered. While their dinner plates average about $9, you can order individual tacos for around $1.50 to $3.00 each. These are not your typical tacos, either. These things are hefty. The carne asada taco has so much tasty steak in it, you'll need a fork when you're done for all the meat that fell out onto your plate. If you dine in, you get a basket full of tortilla chips to enjoy with salsa from the small salsa bar.So far I've had two things that I didn't enjoy much: the adobada taco and the rolled-up tacos (taquitos). That said, I'm still exploring their varied menu, and I've enjoyed almost everything so far. Other reviewers have noted the owner's attitude (at least I assume she's the owner). They generally use the word \"rude.\" I would say that she's not very interactive with customers, and that's just because she's extremely busy. They could consider hiring part time help for the lunch rush. I've never witnessed her being rude. She doesn't ignore or belittle customers and will always get you what you ask for. Don't come if you're looking for sauce-heavy Mexican food. There's plenty of chain restaurants that can give you that.

Oh, they will give you the rice and bean alright, but it's just for an illusion of familiarity; for me, I just want the essence.

Also his photos of the food looked very scrumptious. After running some errands in North Raleigh, I stopped in to Los Cuates for a light dinner. It's located on Old Wake Forest Road near the Red Lobster and Kanki. It doesn't look like much on the outside and it is very casual inside. The menu is posted above the counter where you place your order. There are some combination meals and lists of individual items...a diverse selection of burritos, tacos, etc. I knew I wanted a fish taco before I even looked over the menu but I decided to try a beef crispy taco too. The woman who took my order was very helpful since I asked her a couple of questions about the tacos. When I sat down, she brought me a glass of water and a basket of chips and directed me to the salsa bar. The chips were room temperature and served salt-free. I added a dash of salt and ventured over to the self-serve bar. Yeah, I just love self-serve! After reading other reviews about Los Cuates I was forewarned about the level of heat of the 3 different salsas. I scooped a small amount of each into 3 different bowls. The green salsa looks pretty innocent but it is quite spicy hot. Caliente! I really liked the red salsa that had the diced tomatoes in it. I'd rate it as mild compared to the other 2. I loved them all! The salsas are not labeled so I can't give you their names. \u00a0I think that some sort of label would be beneficial. I barely finished tasting each salsa when my tacos were served. Wow, the fish taco was awesome. A single piece of fish fried a golden brown dressed in fresh chopped tomatoes, onions, cilantro, and crunchy cabbage with a drizzle of cream sauce on a warm tortilla. It was very yummy, satisfying and as good as I hoped it would be. The other taco had a crispy corn tortilla shell filled with beef that was not ground or sliced...it looked shredded but tasted like it had been slow cooked and just fell apart. It was extremely tender. To spice it up, I added a little green salsa and a little of the diced tomato salsa...hmm,mmm perfection.The tacos were delicious. Service was rapid.

There are usually other young children in the restaurant too so we never feel like the only ones. The food is very good and economical and the atmosphere is nice. We went this time on Father's Day and I got a 'large' draft beer that was Enormous and more like 3 beers in one. The lunch menu was very affordable for our budget with 3 kids and two adults. And for Father's Day the restaurant gave us a fried ice cream at no charge. They were doing it as a special promotion for all fathers. This is one of the few restaurants I've seen actually giving a discount or free menu item for Father's Day - most restaurants just organize a special menu.

I tried my boyfriend's food and drink as well - the grilled watermelon margarita and the braised rib tacos. The margarita tasted like straight sugar - so sweet that the watermelon flavor was lost. The braised ribs were decent, but there was so much sugar in the BBQ sauce that it overpowered the meat. Without the sauce the taco would have been perfection.

I sent it back after eating only the mushroom, none of the bun and none of the fries at all. I then ordered a side of black beans and guac. Both were average, nothing to write home about.The owner came over and asked what was wrong with the sandwich, so I told her. I had never worried about being charged for it, I told both her and the server how disappointed I was. Not only was I charged, but I was OVERCHARGED! The menu said $9 for the sandwich, both my husband and I ordered one and were charged $10 each. And, to charge for the black beans and guac, which was then my lunch because I basically had to order twice, is crazy.If you want quality, good Mexican food stick with authentic places like Los Tres. Or, if you like more trendy places succeeding in great customer service and recognizing when a customer isn't happy and making it right, try Totopos. Several weeks ago we were unhappy with a dish, and they ended up giving us a credit for the entire meal. Not what we expected or even asked for, but they insisted in the hopes we would go back. And it worked, we will.However, Salt and Lime did not succeed and we WILL NOT BE BACK. If you want to open a restaurant, customer service should be the most important aspect. You made $10 bucks that day, but lost a customer forever. Period."], ["Melissa W.", "My husband and I went here for a date night and we were very impressed. The service by Justin was awesome.

I want to go back for half priced wine on Wednesday! Absolutely love this place!!"], ["Ashley M.", "My sister and I are preparing to move to the area so we are trying local places to eat. Well my sister asked for a chicken burrito instead of the surf and turf because she's mildly allergic to shrimp and she never eat beef. When she took a bite of her food, it was only shrimp. I know the server entered it in and she was great and apologetic about the incident, but when my sister asked for open faced chicken tacos instead, I personally think that her meal should've been comp'd. A manager came out moments later and apologized for the confusion in the kitchen, and walked away. She was kind and asked if everything else was alright, and it was, but I'm sure that if we had gotten irate or rude with the staff or management that we would have been complimented on her meal. She could have had an extreme allergy to shrimp and it could have been an awful situation that we were in. I wouldn't want to come back because my mom has extreme allergies to fish, and I wouldn't be able to trust that they would take that into consideration for our orders. Maybe I'm asking for too much, but I just think if I were management, as a CYA kind of thing.. I would've done anything within my power to let the customer know that my establishment is better than the experience that was provided to them. That i understand the importance of food allergies and that we don't accept that. But it felt like it was just brushed under the rug like a regular dissatisfied customer. All I know is that for a tex mex place, I won't be returning."], ["April P.", "Some of the most delicious Mexican/Baja food ever. I can't wait to go back.

The salsa was good, the chips were fresh, and the surt and turf burrito was huge. Everything I had was good but I was not wowed or impressed with the taste. The surf and turf burrito had a citrus -sauce and flavor I could not quite put my finger on.

I meant to order the braised short rib tacos, but in a moment of distraction, I ordered the carne asada. This was not in dispute: Heather recalled that I ordered the asada. I had really been looking forward to the short ribs, and when I got the carne asada, I was so bummed that I asked if I could also order the short ribs, at my own cost. He said he wouldn't hear of it and brought me the short ribs at no charge. What a mensch.The short ribs definitely lived up to my hopes, being rich and soft while still chewy, and having a nice sticky-sweetness that played well off the slightly limey flour tortillas. The whole meal was massive, and I was overstuffed even putting half of it away. The carne asada was good, too, if you're into that kind of thing--I've never been a fan no matter where it came from.Heather's enchiladas were massive and massively smothered in fresh lettuce, pico, and several cheeses, and served on top of a cheesy cilantro rice. She was very happy.She got the tres leches to go with it. I felt it was a little over-hyped based on the previous reviews--to me, it was just sponge cake with some toppings and ice cream.

Sooo good! \u00a0Not my most favorite sweet potato fries i've had, but they are unique and like nothing i've had before and very good!

Creamy, not icey, flavorful but not overly sweet. Original review:I was immediately impressed with the interior. \u00a0 Decor is very cohesive and calming. \u00a0Kind of a beachy, Cabo-y laid back kind of feel. \u00a0It was classy and relaxed without being stuffy or pretentious. \u00a0Music was present but low key. \u00a0Can I just tell you how nice it was to use my inside voice at the dinner table instead of yelling a conversation over loud music?Wait staff were spot on. \u00a0Fast, nice, and informative. \u00a0I was even more impressed that the owners (a husband and wife team) were circulating the restaurant the whole time we were there, introducing themselves and asking people their opinions of what they ate, how it was, etc. \u00a0That was super impressive. \u00a0That shows a commitment to \u00a0met the needs of their patrons.We decided to try mostly salt and lime specialty items, It's denoted by a little lime wedge beside the item on the menu.We were given a bowl of \u00a0salsa and blue corn chips, chips were obviously kicked up a little bit with a shake of spices. \u00a0Salsa had a nice flavor, without being too bold or spicy. It was nice and chunky, not watery. \u00a0It had a little kick, but nothing so over powering that i couldn't eat it.For appetizers we ordered the corn roasted guac and the baja cabo rolls. \u00a0Normally one of my gripes is paying $5 for a little bowl of mushed up avocado with very little flavor, but not here! \u00a0You can see in my picture it was topped with a nice black bean pico type stuff, and the guac itself had a great flavor. \u00a0Not the bland mush in a bowl i'm use too! \u00a0The baja cabo rolls reminded me of southwest egg rolls, except waaaay better. \u00a0The ingredients were fresh and were nice chucks instead of minced into a southwest paste like some places do. \u00a0They were very fresh tasting, and you could tell, freshly made. \u00a0Worth ordering again!Entree: Short rib tacos. \u00a0MMMM, MMMM! \u00a0The meat was so good, well seasoned, and not overly dry. \u00a0And while some places you get 3 tacos for this price, here you only get 2, however, the tacos here are waaaay bigger, and you are defiantly getting your money's worth!The owner stopped by to see us and ask how it was going. \u00a0After talking to us for a while \u00a0He asked us if we every enjoy cocktails. \u00a0Typically the hubbie and i don't drink. \u00a0It's usually very expensive and we just don't care for the flavor more often than not. \u00a0But the owner convinced us to try their \"Grilled Grapefruit\" Margarita.And when I tried it.....HOLY COW! \u00a0I jokingly told someone I would become an alcoholic for that thing! \u00a0IT was sooo good. \u00a0I can't even begin to explain to you how complex all the flavors were, but how incredibly good it was. \u00a0You seriously just have to go try it. \u00a0You will not regret it. \u00a0Even if you're like us and could care less about a drink, split one with a friend.....it is A-MA-ZING! \u00a0and worth the price!We ended the evening with their Kahlua Flan. \u00a0Just typing that makes me want to get in the car, go there now and face plant into this stuff. It was creamy and smooth, not eggy and jello-y. \u00a0At the risk of sounding extreme and exaggerated (but i'm really not, it's true) this is the BEST flan i've ever....EVER had in my life....literally EVER. \u00a0soooo good!It is a creamy kahulua flan topped with a amazing espresso caramel topped with a little whipped topping and espresso shortbread cookie pieces......*gasp* o the awesomeness of it! \u00a0The great thing about this dessert is that it was not overly sweet. \u00a0The coffee flavor was not over powering and added the right amount of bitterness to take away the sickening sweet that this dish could be.Without hesitation I highly recommend this place to you!

They have a neat little outdoor seating area off to the side that's really nice when the weather is good. They have a pretty big food and drink menu so your choices will definitely not be limited. I judge any place that serves Mexican food by the guacamole and the tacos - both of which are great. And of course you get bottomless chips which is always awesome.

They have a really great drink menu with some creative options to choose from.All the reviews I read mentioned the cheese dip so I had to order it. It's definitely not your typical white processed queso you find at other Mexican restaurants. The cheese dip had a nice taste to it and I liked the chorizo in it. The salsa you could tell was fresh but could have used some spice to it. I ordered the bbq mahi tacos for my entree I really liked them they were full of flavor and it was a lot of food, plenty of mahi mahi in these tacos.It's a very family friendly restaurant and the service was suburb.

My friend also texted me that evening that she had thrown up and thought it might have been the food.I got the 2 taco special. They were not very flavorful in my opinion. I was excited about the salsa bar because often times salsa can add great flavor and kick to food, but the salsas I tried were pretty average too. I did love their pico de gallo though! They give everyone chips as a side and the chips were overly greasy and they were basically all in tiny little pieces! I will probably not return to chubbys unless I'm with friends who want to go. I had never heard of them up until 3 nights ago and now I think I know why. I do want to add though that the service is really good!

The fake macaw on the perch gives this place character as well. Chubby's is small and as you walk in it's counter service, but they will bring you the food. The Baja Fish Tacos on soft corn tortillas were just money! I tried Shrimp ones as well and they were great. Make it a combo with rice and refried or black beans. In the back, there's an array of salsas from House to Special. My favorite is the Verde. There's plenty of Pico de Gallo, limes, and lemons. Enjoy a Frozen Margarita with a choice of salt, sugar or mixed rim. And super cheap as well. My friend got a wrong order of Shrimp Tacos but they were quick to fix that. I offered to pay for the new taco, but they just waved it off and gave a smile. They just said they hoped we enjoyed the meal! How sweet!

Their drink and salsa area was pretty crowded, and stuffed into a back corner beyond the rows of booths, but we got there right before the lunch rush, so getting everything wasn't too bad. The rush of lunchers came swiftly, and just as our food arrived, there was a line going out the door.I don't really remember much after that, except for lots of tasty nachos, salsa and chips. Everything was excellent, and if I ever come to Raleigh again, Chubby's will be on my list of places to visit."], ["Terri T.", "Consistently. Delicious. Chubby's. We went again tonight because we just can't stay away for very long, and we were talking about just what an eating establishment has to do to earn 5 stars. I always rate eating establishments among their own ilk, to be fair. So when it comes to a good neighborhood taqueria, it really doesn't get any better, in our opinion, than Chubby's. We have never had a bad experience here, the food is always consistently good. They happily take your order, and accommodate any special requests. Everything is fresh and tasty, they have a great salsa bar. Food is brought promptly to your table, and the prices are really good. So barring any outrageous failing on their part, this will be my final review of Chubby's, and I gladly give them 5 stars."], ["Jeff M.", "Great food at a good price. The service is quick but be early for lunch. The variety of salsas covers all the bases."], ["Emily E.", "Chubby's is great! Great selection of food, I'm particularly fond of the barbacoa, chorizo and carnitas toppings. While the tacos are solid, the taco salad is where it's at (the shell is absolutely mind-blowing). Chips and queso are a must, as are margaritas on the rox!"], ["Ryan W.", "Found this place through Yelp and can see why it's so highly rated. The walk-up service is fast and the food came out quick. This is defInitely a little hole in the wall with a good reputation based on the traffic inside - definitely not sure what to think when we drove up since it's in a shopping strip.Only downside for no downside review is the amount of seating. It turns over quick due to the quick service but there's only seating for 25-30 max in tiny booths (I would argue they are 1.5 people wide).Try the #2 spicy taco sampler if it's your first time. The tinga chicken is really good. The carne asada was also good and a touch spicy. Didn't get the sopapillas this time but will definitely look into them next time."], ["Trishie L.", "Chubby's (or Guacamaya Fresh) is my go-to for tacos, though everything I've gotten here has been fantastic; pair that with their prices and they can't be beat. \u00a0I wish the inside were a bit bigger but even if it's packed you can usually snag a table from people that just finished eating. \u00a0Food is always preapared quickly. I usually get mine right after I've finished getting my drink and salsa together, and speaking of salsa, their salsa bar has many kinds to choose from (I usually go for the habanero and the salsa of the week). So, if you're looking for a great place for quick Mexican, go to Chubby's."], ["M E.", "I love Chubby's! I eat here at least 3 times a month. I usually get a Chicken tinga burrito and it will last me 3 meals. Honestly they are huge. \u00a0This location is small but, usually busy.

I have been going to this location since they opened and never had a bad experience!"], ["Don F.", "Tacos were bland, just mean and onions on top. The tortialls were plain corn tortillas - ok but nothing special.

Friendly fast service."], ["Anne-Marie B.", "I'll probably have to revisit this but my first visit ended with indigestion, and the queso was not exactly what I'm used to.

Hopefully a review update is in order, sans the subsequent stomach-settling ginger ale."], ["Brad K.", "I could not even guess at how many burritos I have consumed here (or other locations, but especially here)... it might actually be rather scary, if I knew the number.The salsa bar is fantastic, love the variety, though I have a few that I always get.Yeah, I've had bad customer experiences here, but they have always been quick to act, to fix the issue. Once they gave me the wrong burrito, and by the time I pick up my salsa, and sat down, they got slammed by customers out the door. I was starving, so I ate most of it, but I called it to their attention, and they gave me the correct one to go. I appreciate that attitude, that you appreciate \"me\" as a customer. Keep it up!!!"], ["Meka C.", "I haven't tried much on Chubby's menu because I love the chicken tinga tacos. When I have ventured out, I found myself wishing I had stuck with my favorite menu item, so I don't anymore. Although perhaps a simple dish, the chicken tinga tacos are consistently fresh and good. They give you a couple of lids when you purchase a meal so that you can try the options on their salsa bar. I think the salsa turns the tacos from good to excellent because I prefer my food spicy and some of the salsas make that an option. I don't much like their beans and rice, so I've learned to not make it a combo. I should also point out that I've definitely received the friendliest service at this location. If it was the more convenient drive, it's the only one I'd go to."], ["Gregory H.", "1 - word - YUM!!!!!Looking for a place to go after church, I knew I'd been wanting to try this location of Chubby's and it was on my way to band practice, so off I went with my bride and daughter in tow.I'm a fan of plates of loaded up nachos and I was in Nacho Heaven when I saw the special on the board! \u00a0Of course I ordered the nacho platter special! \u00a0So tasty! \u00a0Now that I'm writing about it, I'm craving it. \u00a0The nacho plate was piled high, spicy ground beef, chicken and shrimp were all on there. \u00a0Could have used more jalapenos but I'm just being picky on that front. \u00a0Another plus, they do serve lemonade.

I used to love the al pastor but it became to hit or miss with the quality (sometimes the pork had chunks of fat)The salsa bar is nice too. \u00a0The selection isn't mind blowing but it is steady. \u00a0I wish they had cilantro on the bar all the time like the Durham location did. \u00a0Here I have to ask sometimes. \u00a0Nothing here is going to blow your mind but if you are a taco lover like myself...it is worth a visit!"], ["Cindy H.", "I love this place.

I am glad I did. This oddly shaped shop has limited seating inside (seating is a few tables and a long counter where you can watch the employees) it does have some seating outside as well. The service was quick and professional although I wouldn't describe it as friendly. The food was made from scratch. The white corn tortillas were a nice touch. The carnita and chorizo tacos were not as flavorful as the barbacoa taco. The tacos were doubled wrapped (two tortillas per taco) which was good because they don't drain the meat so you have very wet tacos. The salsa bar was a nice touch with a big variety of salsa. The pico de gallo was obviously hand made and was very chunky. If you are a chili head like me that is a good thing. The prices were affordable. Nice find. Definitely worth going back and trying the burritos."], ["Lindsey B.", "Came here on a whim and was not disappointed! Great food, good prices, nice atmosphere!"], ["Kelly G.", "Awesome awesome tacos.

The place is small and there is usually a line to order but don't let that discorage you or you'll be missing out on some serious Mexican food. The ground beef burito is my favorite. Its delicious and cheap. Today I had 2 soft shell. Ground beef tacos, refried beans and yellow rice. It was authentic, fresh and yummy!!! They give you a small side of chips with whatever you order then you go to the salsa bar and get your own salsa. There's about 8 to 10 different kinds of salsa and you can try them all if you'd like. The salsa bar gets a little messy at lunch because some people don't clean up after themselves but I'm not faulting chubby's for that. The soda machine is right by the salsa bar so this area gets a congested but not so bad that your waiting around. You can get your own refills and can even take a refill to go. I love that I don't have to wait for a refill and can just help myself. You also pay when you order so you never have to wait for a check. I really love there food, service and the fact that your in and out of there at lunch time with no hassles. They got there system down, it works and it keeps the place running smooth."], ["David B.", "After hearing good things, I decided to check them out. I went at 6pm on a Wednesday, and they were doing a brisk business, both eat-in and take-out. The staff was friendly. It took 5 - 8 minutes for the food to arrive, which seemed good considering the crowd. Prices are great.The food was good, not great. Ground beef nachos were good, fairly standard. The grilled shrimp tacos were mediocre - overcooked and bland. Tinga chicken flautas were the highlight. The tinga was definitely not too spicey, as some have said. This dish definitely rose above the shrimp. Next time, I'll stick with the more traditional Mexican meats.On food alone, I probably would have given 3 stars. But everything else bumped the grade up a star. I did drive well past 2 other Mexican places on the way. Next time, I won't. However, when in the neighborhood, I'll eat there again."], ["Matthew M.", "We stopped here for a quick dinner before a concert in Raleigh.

I would give it four stars, but I think the restaurant could do a little better with its cleanliness and overall appearance. Other than that, things were pretty good."], ["Antonio R.", "For the reviews I had high expectations about this place, and they were met. This is a \"Taqueria\" serving popular dishes like tacos, burritos and Chimichangas. It is not a restaurant with servers, so you have to order and pay, and then sit yourself (Moe's Style, but more authentic)I got the Special No.1 (2 tacos - One Chicken One Carnitas (pork)). I feel the quality of the food (meat) is better than in conventional Mexican restaurants (very lean meat).

The restaurant is themed around the Mexican culture. They have definitely placed themselves differently from other Mexican restaurants in the Triangle. Gonzo is great for groups and when you are there, and if the weather is good, get a seat outside. This place can get crowded on Thursday,Friday and Saturday nights. For large parties, reserve ahead of time. And this restaurant doesn't take call aheads.They don't serve the stereotype Mexican dishes that you are familiar with. For vegetarians, Stuffed Poblano pepper with green sauce is worth a shot. It is light on the tummy as well. For chicken lovers, Enchiladas con mole and Chilaquiles Verde are delicious. Both Chilaquiles and Poblano pepper use the same green(verde) sauce. I wasn't impressed with the Mexican Flag as much as the others. I have also tasted the Camaron and it also tastes good. Their flour tortillas are very thin and whenever I have had a dish which had them, they have always tasted fresh and appetizing.Gonzo does a good job at the bar too. Their cocktails will enhance your experience. Their dishes are well priced. Slightly pricier than your average Mexican restaurant.

The decor was on point, and I love the wide selection of cartoon bobble heads they offer you to hold as you wait for your table. The service could not have been better and my server even convinced me to get a spicy cucumber margarita. I wanted a spicy margarita but I don't typically like cucumber so I was hesitant. The margarita was out of this world! My friend ordered the passion fruit margarita and loved it. We both ordered The Mexican Flag off of the menu. It was amazing!! It consisted of three different enchiladas each covered in its own type of sauce. Oh, and the chips and salsa were quite possibly the best I've ever had. This is my new favorite place.

The food was mediocre. Deserving of 3 stars. The service deserves 1 star.The parties who skipped us were generous enough to acknowledge that we were first. At which point, we deferred to a young couple with a baby and suggested they be seated. The host suggested that they could wait fora four top table because they had a party of 3. Infants in car seats require a place at the table now a days. I don't mind waiting 30 minutes, but getting skipped by three other parties who came in after us is inexcusable. The bobble head system is abhorrent. Not even all of them are bobble heads.Waitress was completely random. Pretty much sucked. Kitchen took forever to get us the food, but it could be that it arrived at the table long after it was ready because it was cold upon arrival.I won't bother with a second attempt. No idea how it's so packed every time I drive by it. I'd never pay twice for this experience.It's not even authentic Mexican food. Hit Los Cuates if you want authentic as hell Mexican food where you can order three different styles of taco a la carte. The decorations/atmosphere at Los Cuates are as spartan as it gets, but the food is 5 stars, you don't wait an hour to get it, the people taking your order are always friendly and its served HOT every single time. Gonza couldn't pull off any of that, but hey, it's a really pretty place (I'm rolling my eyes as I say this). Gonza's where you bring your first date. When you find out she likes real Mexican food and you've been dating for a few months, bring her to Los Cuates or almost any other Mexican restaurant near/on Capital Blvd."], ["Michelle T.", "Great decorating, and pretty good food and booze. To be honest, the Wake Forest location worked more to accommodate my vegetarian requests than this one!

The special margharitas are generally good but pricey."], ["Sydney J.", "Gotta say I wasn't too impressed with this place, maybe I hit it on a bad night, but I doubt ill go back to see. First off, it's an awesome atmosphere, it's got that working for it. It seems nowadays people care about that more than how the food actually tastes.The service was fine. I felt like our waitress was nice, but like she was trying to hurry us along. My husband and I went out with another couple that are close friends. Whenever we go out we like to drink, eat, talk and drink some more so we try to go a little after the dinner rush so we can chat. \u00a0I was a server for a couple of years so I always tip extra if we have taken a table up, because I know they are needing to make money. However, when you have a table buying rounds of margaritas and tequila shots you should probably capitalize on that table. As for the food, I ordered steak fajitas. I thought they were extremely over priced for what I got. At every other place I have gone to you get a side of rice/ beans, a nice portion of steak, and toppings. I received 3 slices of steak and tasted the fajitas tasted average for something that cost over $15.I had 2 different margeritas and they average as well.

The best Mexican food I've ever had - and I've had a lot!"]], "Jose and Sons": [["Jared W.", "I sure wish I was allowed to give six stars- I haven't been this blown away by food at a restaurant in a long time. I visited on a Friday night with my girlfriend without reservations- big mistake, it would be almost a two hour wait to get a table unless we were able to find a seat around the bar. Luckily there was a couple who just left the bar and we were able to snag their seats. I would definitely recommend a reservation on any busy night. I'm not sure if it was the busy nature of the night, but the service from our bartender wasn't the best. We never got chips and salsa, and he was fairly slow to take our orders and refill drinks, but I'll forgive this based on the amazing food..We started with the Mexican street corn. I've never had corn this good! The cheese, cilantro, and mayonaisse spread might sound a little odd but it is great! It's just cheesy enough and has just enough cilantro flavor to balance the sweetness of the perfectly grilled corn.I ordered the collard wrapped tamales, and they were excellent. The tamales were so tender and the corn was so flavorful. The collard wrap on the outside added an interesting dynamic and was good as well. The cheese, onions, and peppers inside were great; I would've possibly liked some meat, but they were still awesome. The dish came with a side of kale and black beans, and I can't believe how much my girlfriend and I loved both. The black beans were spiced perfectly, and the kale was even better. The dressing and seasoning on the kale added incredible flavor, and I didn't know kale could taste this good!My girlfriend got the enchiladas del mar, and despite my food being great, these enchiladas stole the show. We both agreed they were the best thing we've eaten at any Mexican restaurant. The shrimp and spinach filling was great; the blackened shrimp had great flavor and were cooked just right. The tomatillo cream sauce that the enchiladas were smothered in was what made them amazing. Just the right amount of spice, tomatillo flavor, cheese, and cream. I could drink this sauce by the jar if it were possible. I highly, highly recommend this dish.Despite the slightly below average service on our visit, I can't give Jose & Sons anything less than 5 stars because all of the food was amazing!"], ["Micaela P.", "I went here for my birthday dinner, and I had some high hopes for this place. However, our service was slower than slow. With two waitresses, it should never have taken over an hour to get our meals or over twenty minutes to get our appetizers and drinks. The space was big and loud; the people at the bar did not quite understand using an inside voice. Now for the food. The guacamole was on point, and I am very picky about guacamole. The chipotle mango margarita was absolutely disgusting, and I had to send it back. For the most part, all of the dishes were appealing to the eyes. But unfortunately they used WAY TOO MUCH SALT!!! We had barbacoa, mole, shrimp and grits, skirt steak with shrimp, Mac n queso, and churros. The meat was incredible. The Mac was boring and that meat was NOT chorizo. I don't know if I would go here again, because too much salt is a crime. But, if they could fix this issue I would love this restaurant!"], ["Jeff S.", "Called on a Friday afternoon for a Sat night reservation for 4. They were able to secure us a table at 8:30.And at 8:25, they were able to seat us.We started with their 'spicy' guac and a pitcher of The Boss margaritas. So good.I had their chili relleno which they found some crazy way to mix with brussels \u00a0sprouts. Love it.We had two pitchers of those margaritas.Very awesome meal for like $80.Now if only the parking down there was a bit more palatable, but that's a different story and not Jose's fault. The 2 guys taking care of our table were great, and the service overall seemed top calibre. The reservation guy even warned me when I called that it would get loud after 10 as they were having a special celebration."], ["Brandon P.", "My wife and I went there for dinner and the food was great again. I got the Enchiladas del Mar and she got the shrimp and grits. She made me try something new because I always get the lamb. I love their mole. We also had the chips and house guacamole as an appetizer. They do a \"guac of the day\" that's usually a different twist on guacamole but we didn't try it this time. It's not a very romantic place but nice for a date, a few drinks, or group dinner. Highly recommended!"], ["Rhoda G.", "I came to Jose and Sons for all girls dinner out and had an enjoyable time. To start off dinner, I got myself a mojito and shared guacamole and chips with everyone. I enjoyed both and our server was quick to refill our chips when we were getting low. For dinner, I decided to get the Triangle Restaurant Week menu. I was tempted to go off the regular menu and try the enchiladas, but I couldn't pass up a great deal with the restaurant week menu.I decided to go with the ceviche as my appetizer. I loved how big the fish and scallops chunks were. With the avocado added also, it was delicious. For the main entree, I got myself the braised beef cheek and masa grits. The portion was really large and the flavor of the beef cheek was great. Then for dessert, it was a no brainer for me to get the tres leche parfait. I love tres leche and this was great dessert. I loved the strawberry habanero sauce, which wasn't spicy at all despite the use of the pepper in the sauce.Definitely coming back to Jose and Sons for dinner. The regular menu looks awesome!"], ["Octavio M.", "We decided to give it a second chance especially after contacting management and truly getting a royal treatment.

It's not authentic Mexican.. it's more like Mexican /southwestern with a sufisticated blend. The manager recommended the ceviche, everything I like in ceviche the scallops where a twist to the normal ceviche de pescado I'm used to but still very well done.

Now, for the food. \u00a0We put in an order for flautas and as I was waiting for chips and salsa, we eventually asked our waitress about them, because the table next to us had some and I was STARVING (service was quite slow). \u00a0The waitress said they do not offer chips and salsa like typical Mexican restaurants do because they want to come off as a more specialty food place. \u00a0I didn't get it, but whatever, she brought some out anyway, which was super nice. The flautas were good, there were three: one chicken, two of the other meat (pork maybe? I've already forgotten). \u00a0The chicken was the best, by far. \u00a0For the main course, I ordered the enchiladas. \u00a0I like to order this at most Mexican restaurants (can I even call it that, since our waitress told us it wasn't?) that I go to because I feel like it's a good baseline and they're my favorite. \u00a0When we ordered the main course, my husband ordered his second drink. \u00a0It did not come out quickly at all, and arrived with our meal maybe 15 or so minutes later. \u00a0The enchiladas in my opinion are just ok here. \u00a0To be honest, there is a local Mexican joint downtown Raleigh that has what are turning out to be my favorite enchiladas. \u00a0I had the chicken, and it was very dry, and in my opinion lacked flavor. \u00a0I took them to go and reheated the next day which completely dried out the chicken so I ended up throwing about half of the meal away. \u00a0I am not sure if we came here on a weird night, or just by a stroke of weird luck we had an off experience, but I am not seeing what the other reviewers do. \u00a0We may give it a try again, but not for awhile. \u00a0Mexican food is my absolute favorite and I don't think I've been so disappointed in an experience or a meal than I was here. \u00a0I may just play it safe and stick with somewhere that I know has great service and enchiladas that are amazing."], ["Nick I.", "Wow where does one start!!!

When we ordered a dessert with our meal, they asked if we wanted it to come out after the rest of our food so that it was fresh. How considerate! \u00a0And then they kept an eye on us our entire meal so that they could fry up the cookie dough flautas at the right time. As for my main meal, I've tried the norrito bowl with carnitas and a couple of different tacos. The norrito bowl is really good. They have really fresh ingredients and you can tell the difference. But beware that the jalapenos are not the pickled kind! They are extremely fresh and hot (but good)! When I ordered the 'Dos Tacos,' they allowed me to choose 2 different types of meat, which was nice. While they were good, they didn't blow me away. A fun way to change up the flavor of your dish is to take advantage of their sauce bar! They have so many choices that vary from sweet to spicy. You are bound to find something you like.We have also ordered the chips trio, which comes with guacamole, queso and salsa. It was way more than we needed, but still a good choice! But the cookie dough flautas are the bestttttttttt! These are by far my favorite thing at Tijuana Flats.

I had the carnitas norrito bowl, which is basically a burrito bowl with no tortilla. The carnitas were pull apart tender and juicy. All of the veggies were fresh and I love fresh jalape\u00f1os they use. Guacamole and sour cream are also included with the burrito bowl! I also have tried the beef burrito and it was also very filling and satisfying. I also go my burrito \"wet\" by adding chipotle red sauce, melted cheese, and scallions. It basically turned the burrito into a giant enchilada, which I didn't mind because it was good. Overall, Tijuana is good Tex mex. Their meat is definitely better quality than other competitors except Chipotle. I love the variety of sauces and entrees that's sure to guarantee you a unique dining experience since not limited to just ordering a burrito or taco. I also must stress that the cookie dough flautas are incredible! They are amazingly delicious because the chocolate chip cookie dough is hot and melty inside a fried tortilla.

The ghost is their hottest I think, which I could handle, but the flavor isn't as tasty as the less spicy sauces. Burrito combo Thursday special! My whole wheat veggie burrito was SO good. The ingredients tasted extremely fresh, even the cheese (what?!). They also loaded us with yummy, crispy, seasoned chips and salsa.

However, Tijuana Flats does a pretty good job. Their funky atmosphere and overly gracious staff were a really nice surprise. The food was just alright - my friend and I split the nachos. My husband and other friend both got the taco plates, and the tacos were *huge* - like novelty huge. That was pretty interesting, and I believe my husband said that the tacos were decent. And because it was my husband and I's first time, we did get free chips and salsa. I see the need for some improvements on the food so I'm only going three stars on this review...but it is very, very close to four."], ["Sandeep N.", "This is one of the best Mexican food I ever had.

Had I had gone on a Tuesday (Taco Tuesdaze), this review might be a bit higher, but I went on a Wednesday You see this was my first visit to TF's and I didn't know about their Tuesday special. I did order the tacos though (one beef and one chicken). With rice and beans, and a drink the price was about $9. I was given the choice of wheat or flour tortillas, hard or soft (that's what she said) and black or pinto beans. They also have a variety of sauces to choose from, going all the way from sissy to the infamous ghost chili sauce which is sure to cause imminent death! Needless to say, I stuck close to the sissy level of hotness. They definitely have the funky, college town vibe going on, and are trying to be \"weird\" (in a good way), but some of their culture was just a little too different for me. I like corn tortillas vs. flour, but they didn't seem to have that option. Also the other reviews mentioned they received a menu when they walked in the door, but I did not. I just kinda assumed they had tacos (which they did). They don't actually list their menu items above the order counter as most places do. Even though the staff was prompt when it came to filling up my drink, I prefer the self-serve style in fast-casual food establishments.My first time encounter here was ok, but I prefer Chubby's better, and Qdoba as well for fast-casual Tex-Mex. There was nothing in my visit to Tijuana Flats to make me think otherwise."], ["April S.", "Tijuana Flats is my FAVORITE fast Tex Mex restaurant by far. I would eat at TF over Chipotle or Moe's any day. Their food is extremely fresh and the staff is always super friendly. I've always been greeted as soon as I've walked in the front door with smiling and energetic people. Tijuana Flats seems to only hire people who actually WANT to work there, which I can appreciate! Last week when I was in, the staff was dressed up in an 80's theme. Afros and neon colors were bountiful. I digress... The food usually comes out pretty quickly but yet you can tell it's prepared to order and not just sitting in warm pans all day to be scooped out and thrown on a plate. The cheese is always so melty and delicious and the vegetables that come on the dishes (olives, lettuce, tomatoes, etc) are always fresh and ripe. The flavor just doesn't compare to other Tex Mex cafe eateries. My favorite part, though, about Tijuana Flats is the hot sauce bar. It's an unlimited buffet of irresistible spiciness! The hot sauces also have awesome names like my favorite \"Smack My Ass and Call Me Sally\" hot sauce. So cool, right? You can also buy the hot sauces in the store or online. 3 of the Tijuana Flats locations used to exist in Charlotte for a year or two and then all of a sudden... POOF, they were gone. I went through enchilada and quesadilla withdrawals for months. :( But trust me, whenever I'm back in Raleigh I'll be sure to hit up that hot sauce bar and the deliciousness they serve at Tijuana Flatts!"], ["Jen E.", "The service is excellent. \u00a0Everyone was friendly and fast and very courteous. But I don't k ow if I just ordered the wrong thing or what. I had a chicken quesadilla with grilled onions and tomatoes, side of salsa and sour cream. It was bland. Tasted like boiled chicken and there was no seasoning at all. I would go back of that's where everyone else wanted to go and try something else but I probably wouldn't choose it again by myself. Really great customer service, though!"], ["Sheetal P.", "I love tex mex and this place is awesome. \u00a0 As soon as you walk in the door someone comes in to help you through the menu and take your drink order while you review the menu. \u00a0I dont think i have been disappointed in anything i have ordered here, and i try to order something different each time.  Be sure to stop in for Taco Tuesdays- where you can get 2 tacos, chips and a drink for like $5.50. \u00a0Their tacos are not standard size, they are HUGE!Also- if you like Spice- they have a Hot Sauce bar where you can try many different types of sauces for your food- from Mild to SUPER SUPER HOT :)Definitely a place you should check out if you want quick, casual tex mex dining :)"], ["Pritesh P.", "This place rocks...literally! \u00a0Great music, delicious food and superb service. \u00a0The place is family friendly, so I rounded up the troops and hit this spot for dinner. \u00a0While we reviewed the menu, the staff asked if they could get us something to drink. \u00a0We all put in our drink order, and we were enjoying a beverage before even paying for it at the register. \u00a0Definitely good service. \u00a0All of us ordered something different including tacos, enchiladas, quesadilla, and chimichanga. \u00a0All of it looked mouth-watering and satisfied our taste buds.If you're a fan of spice, this place is a treat. \u00a0Their salsa bar is not very traditional. \u00a0There are several spouts that dispense everything from the mild sissy sauce to the blow your head off hot sauce. \u00a0Choose your poison wisely! \u00a0Tip: \u00a0They have patio seating too, so on a nice day, this is a great spot to enjoy a meal outside!"], ["Michael B.", "Stopped by to grab a beer with a friend yesterday after watching the Miami Heat stomp the LA Lakers. \u00a0After we found a nice table we were greeted warmly and given menus, we decided not to eat dinner just yet so we order an app instead. \u00a0we went with the \"Tijuana trio\" which basically is just tortilla chips with guacamole, Queso dip, and salsa.

The service was second-to-none; I rarely encounter service this prompt and friendly in restaurants costing three or four times as much, and it was a real pleasure in a cost-conscious place like this.Our food was cheerful and well done.

Kind of like Mellow Mushroom meets Mexican place. The food didn't impress me very much. I decided to try this place again at the Raleigh location for lunch. They have a deal on Tuesday where you can get 2 tacos, chips and a drink for $4.99. (Recently raised to $5.49) The first thing that struck me was the service. From the minute you enter the place there's someone to great you and with in minutes your drink order is taken. The line moves fast and the service is very prompt. The tacos have a fresh taste and the deal is a good value. The only thing that bugs is that you have to pay extra for salsa or queso. I think if you serve chips salsa should be a given. I wouldn't classify the food as authentic Mexican food. More like trendy tacos. They are good in their own way. What really makes the place for me is the friendly service. If you can't get to this place before 12 you might as well skip it. At noon it is a mad house and you'll be lucky finding a seat. Parking becomes a real challenge."], ["Terri T.", "We've been back a few times now, and our opinion of the place has only improved. Last night I had the fish tacos, and they are really good, I got them with everything on them. The citrus vinaigrette they use gives that taco something special, add the Jason's Mom sauce from the Hot Bar, and it's just about perfect. My fella had the veggie burrito served wet with the verde sauce, he liked it a lot! Pitcher of Hopside Down to go with it.... nice! Their fish taco is my second favorite of all time, and I'm on a mission to try them all. There is still one that I hold in such high esteem that others will have a hard time comparing, but this one... this one is close.

You walk in, they greet you and give you a menu, and when you are ready, go up to the counter and order. Every dish comes with a standard set of ingredients, and be sure to tell them if you don't like something (i.e. jalapenos, onions).

While we waited we had the taquitos from the appetizer menu. I do not recommend the beef, chicken or whatever other option they have, they were terrible, dry, and the sauces were not good. {Preface - I feel the need to explain this experience in detail, I promise it will help you if you decide to dine here}.When I realized the wait was getting out of hand, I went to ask the hostess what was going on, before I could finish asking she cut me off and said \"I know you're the frog, you're next\" (they give you stuffed animals or other inanimate objects to hold instead of buzzers) I said...\"No, actually we are the....\" and then she cut me off again and said \"You're the party of four I know\" and I said \"No, there are only two of us and your boss took our name down (she was away from the hostess stand when we checked in) and it's not on the sheet you have in front of you (I knew this because my name was the only one on this other sheet at the very top, which I saw nowhere on the sheet in front of her. Basically, we were sat shortly after that.Once we sat outside we would up talking to the manager about the host stand issue, he said, and I quote, \"We know we messed up, there was miscommunication but as soon as we found out we tried to seat you immediately and it's just really busy\"... A manager who knows there is a problem and doesn't talk to the guests about it probably shouldn't be managing a restaurant.

Really customer friendly restaurant, right?We ordered the steak and chicken fajitas/fagrillitas. They were delicious. Best part of the night. The meat and veggies came out piping hot, the tortillas very warm, the steak and chicken were tender, not dry, and the vegetables were not over cooked. I highly recommend ordering this item.At the end of our meal they brought out a birthday shot for my mom, we were celebrating her 50th birthday.

We heard the music playing on the outdoor patio and saw that the place was brightly lit up with people milling about inside. Yeah! Instantly we changed course making a beeline for the entrance to Xoco. Unless you're totally oblivious, you can't miss this Mexican eatery located in the spot formerly occupied by The Diner because the outdoor patio is uniquely and festively decorated with quirky, maybe a tad gaudy Mexican tchotchkes. Look for the rusting (antique?) VW Bus. I kept expecting billows of smoke to come pouring out as grinning Cheech and Chong rolled down the window of the bus.With no notice to the public that the restaurant was open, the place was already full by 7 pm. The news is out! Our waitress came by to greet us and take our drink order. Margaritas of course! Soon after, she dropped off a basket of warm, crisp \u00a0salt-free corn chips and salsa. The salsa was chunky and tasty flavored with onion and cilantro. Andy had the Gold Margarita and I ordered the Blue Margarita, which contained Blue Curacao. Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed in the margaritas. Mine was a little too sweet and Andy's was a little on the bland side, not sweet and not tangy and tart just kind of blah. I may be wrong but the sour mix tasted like any generic mass produced mixer loaded with fructose corn syrup. I'll be reluctant to order margaritas in the future.The menu consisted of typical Mexican fare such as tacos, enchiladas, burritos, quesadillas, nachos, and fajitas (which they call Fagrillitas). They also offer empanadas. The stuffing for the chile relleno changes periodically and I asked our server for a description of the current recipe which was corn, zucchini, cheese, and topped with shrimp. Sold! This dish comes with soup or salad. Even better! I opted for the salad...a fresh ensemble of baby spinach, greens, onion, tiny diced cucumber and tomatoes with shredded carrot and purple cabbage with a sprinkle of tortilla chips served with a side of your choice of dressing. I picked the cilantro vinaigrette...a very satisfying and delicious little side salad.After a short wait, a happy person from the kitchen delivered our entrees. All the employees were in a good mood, smiling and bustling about providing great service. And their convivial manner added to the lively, festive atmosphere. Andy's dinner was a massive portion of three enchiladas topped with a different sauce, rice, and refried beans. Normally, you receive 1 steak, 1 chicken, and 1 black bean enchilada. However, Andy requested 2 with black bean and 1 with chicken and that was no problem at all. FYI, my vegetarian friends, there is a limited selection of meat-free options but you should be able to find something yummy. Andy told me everything was very good and he liked that the enchiladas were not greasy. I think Andy had a little bit of entr\u00e9e envy because my chile rellenos was fabulicious...definitely the star of the evening taking home a Golden Globe. So I don't know what they did to prepare the pepper but it was a reddish black color with a wrinkling parchment paper-like appearance and it tasted awesome...very flavorful and savory. It was a perfect accompaniment to the cheesy veggie stuffing. The shrimp added another layer of specialness to the dish. There was a little dollop of salsa, which looked quite innocent but was actually very spicy. Packed a hot wallop. Loved it! But if you are a spice-phobe, you may wish to be careful with this salsa.I'm looking forward to spending more time at Xoco getting to know this little sister and when summer comes, I can't wait to hang out on the outdoor patio."], ["Gina B.", "I had tacos on the brain and there was no persuading me otherwise. Even though I had read the lackluster opening reviews of DT Xoco. I like to be one of the first to the crime scene I guess. So, off my friend and I went to get our fix.We went on a Sunday night to find the place packed, with a wait. I was surprised to learn they have 3 bars. One right at the door (especially chilly to sit at in the winter when the door opens), another in the back of the restaurant near the kitchen, and another on the patio. The ambience was right on point and reminded me more of the sister restaurant on Creedmoor (complete with a train that runs thru-out the restaurant).Unfortunately, the food quality and service doesn't match the ambience. My friend and I were underwhelmed with our dishes and how long it took for the kitchen to deliver them (steak fajitas overcooked and fish tacos). Our server was unable to answer pretty basic questions about each dish. Also, they should stop grilling their corn tacos....it makes them so tough you can't even cut them with a knife. Just steam them like everyone else does! I will likely try them again once they get the kinks worked out, but they have a ways to go to charge $14+ dollars for an entree that small and that quality. I'd rather go to the average stripmall mexican place."], ["Kristy S.", "Dined here with a friend last night. \u00a0We sat out on the patio which was wonderfully eclectic. \u00a0The chips and obviously house-made salsa were delicious. \u00a0The guacamole seemed a little too smooth to be house made... unless they used a blender. \u00a0I ordered the Original Steak Taco Plate and was not impressed. \u00a0I had to add extra lime juice, cilantro and then add sour cream to make them even passable. \u00a0My friend had the Carnitas and they too were very bland. \u00a0The margaritas were made with a horribly sour (obviously) premade mix that ruined the tequila. \u00a0We won't be back."], ["Heather S.", "Very disapointed. 1. Taken to my table and it was dirty.

The carnitas portion was fine but the beans rather lack of, was like they used a paint brush to lightly brush some on the plate. \u00a0The Rita had a ton of ice which means less liquid and the guac app was about the size of an ice cream scoop.

I ordered sangria and my friends and I shared empanadas, taquitos and jalapeno poppers - all of which were quite tasty!The service has always been friendly and fast, especially considering the crowds.

They lacked that zing that you expect from a margarita and instead, were bland. Our chips and salsa arrived by train, which was a unique touch. I decided to order a chicken quesadilla for my entree. I wish I had tried something else, because the quesadilla wasn't very good. It was very doughy and soggy and lacked flavor. The quesadilla only had chicken and cheese and I couldn't distinguish between the two because of the nasty tortilla dough.I don't frequent Glenwood South that often, so I doubt I'll be back to Xoco.

For instance, I ordered a beverage which took about 8 minutes to arrive; but seven minutes were taken up by my server (and his elaborate mustache) walking the ladies behind me through the menu in a very fun way. I got the eponymous tacos, wanting to compare it to Centro's wonderful marinated skirt steak offering. The presentation at Xoco is much more El Rodeo: a puddle of refried beans, pile of 'Mexican' rice, and the tacos, which were filled with shredded lettuce and cheese, and ground beef. Disappointingly normal given the restaurant's heritage heritage, but I will admit it was all a bit tastier than the faithful El Ro. And, what did I expect for $6.95, anyway?The salsa was fine, but nothing amazing, same for the guac. The decor is elaborate and fun, but seems excessive for somewhat ordinary food. The music was actually pretty good, a break from the standard reggaeton or norte\u00f1o you usually hear. In all a fine experience, a bit more homey than the typical cheap Mexican food.

The coolest special is 50% off of the menu after 8 PM on Sundays for service industry workers. Make no mistake about it, the food at Cueva De Lobos is what Micah Z loves to call \"Gringo Mexican Food.\" That doesn't change the fact that the food is indulgent and delicious. My favorite menu item is the burrito adentro - Steak, Chicken, and Shrimp. Another incredible item is the lunch steak fajita. You will be amazed that it's under $7.I ignored the flaws of Cueva initially. The salsa is tasteless tomato juice. Service has never been particularly good. Still, I liked Cueva and would've given it 4 stars had I written this review a few months ago. Heck, Cueva De Lobos was even going to become my go-to spot for lunch. Then the abhorrently bad service started. One day I ordered my typical lunch steak fajita to go. The ticket time ran past 20 minutes. You don't need to be a restauranteur to know that this is unacceptable. People ordering take-out at lunch have time constraints, and lunch menu items are meant to be quick. I was prepared to cancel my order, when I finally saw it ready. Rather than apologizing for the service time and still offering me to-go silverware, the server nonchalantly handed me the food and walked away. Against my better judgment, I returned to Cueva De Lobos late one night, a few hours before close. A sign told me to proceed to the bar for service. I walked all of the way to their bar in the back, only to be told that the kitchen was closed. Shouldn't the server who was standing around at the front tell me that? Shouldn't it be affixed to their sign? Shouldn't they pretend they give a crap about their customers?1.25 stars - Cueva De Lobos is one of the more frustrating places out there. The food is good, and the lunch steak fajitas are a winner. Unfortunately, the service is so bad that I likely will not return unless it's with a group of friends for $0.99 taco Tuesdays/Fridays.

I had the chicken quesadilla the first time. Even though the way they made it wasn't conventional (instead of stacking one tortilla on top of another, they made half quesadilla with one single tortilla and fold it in half. does this make sense?), it was still tasty with the gooey cheese and plentiful of chicken. I wasn't wowed by the food, but I thought it was a decent place and was surprised by the low rating.My second visit was on a Friday for their 99 cents taco. The tacos were just alright. I can't even remember what kind of taco I had because they were just not memorable at all. \u00a0I wouldn't go for the tacos even if they were 99 cents a pop. Plus you don't get refill on chips and salsa unless you order additional dips if you are doing the 99 cents tacos. Womp womp.They say third time the charm, but this was definitely not the case. I just got back to Raleigh on a trip and wanted to grab something fast to eat. Since Cueva De Lobos is nearby, I decided to order carry out. The description for their carne asada on their website caught my attention: CARNE ASADA: Two marinated and grilled steaks topped with grilled onions. Served with rice, beans, and a Mexican salad. $10.95. Once I got home, I couldn't wait before I dig in. However what welcomed me was a sad dinner. The carne asada was tough and flavorless. The Mexican salad consisted of lettuce and a dollop of sour cream. I was in shocked and utterly disappointed. All I wanted was something warm and flavorful and Cueva De Lobs failed to deliver that.Update: April 23 2014I came back for dinner because \u00a0my friend has a groupon deal. I didn't really have high hopes for it and thanks to some of the yelp pictures I was able to eliminate some of the items on the menu. I ended up getting the chicken fajita quesadilla. It did not disappoint and was quite good. It was nice and crisp on the outside. Cheesy and gooey on the inside with chicken, bell pepper, onions, and tomatoes. My friend got the veggie fajita and it looked like a sad mess. There was no vibrant color on his plate; everything looked sort of dead for some reason. I didn't get to try it so I don't know whether it's good or not, but my friend wasn't too thrill about it. Their chips are good, but their salsa was pretty terrible. It almost tasted foul... I ended up eating the chips with the tapatio sauce on the table. They have daily drink specials, and maybe that's what keep the business going.

El Rodeo, along with many other Mexican places in NC, are greasy, expensive and disgusting. Cueva de Lobos, on the other hand, is sort of a toned down, much tastier version of what Americans believe is authentic Mexican food--don't get me wrong, I do love it, but it's definitely not 100% authentic.We were promptly seated and got chips and salsa right when we sat down. Pretty good salsa. It wasn't the freshest but it did have chili powder in it which was tasty. I got a pint Dos Equis for $2.50 which ain't too bad. They have a great combo option at the bottom of one of the pages on the menu where you can get three food items for about $7.50. I got a burrito, quesadilla, and beans and rice (lost points for having mushy re-fried pinto beans).The food took about 12 minutes or so and I have a sneaky suspicion that this is because they didn't just nuke the plate like at El Rodeo, i.e someone actually prepared it carefully and skillfully. The food wasn't overly greasy and it was very well presented, again, unlike El Rodeo. Nice plates too.This place has great drink specials and many other specials that I'm definitely going to hit up--can't wait to hit up $2 tacos. Good music too: Postal Service, Modest Mouse, Built to Spill, etc. Even better is the fact that I can walk there and I won't ever have to set food that nasty sports bar Jax because I know a good place to drink exists just a few hundred feet away. Four stars for yummy-ness. Five stars on Yelp because El Rodeo doesn't deserve 4 stars. And if you're going for more authentic Mexican, check out Chubby's or Dos Tacquitos (if you can afford it). And if your ever in Brooklyn, go to La Tortilleria Mexicana--that is real Mexican, which is part of the reason I know this place is not 100% authentic.

They make the guacamole at your table and its good. The have really great food its plated nicely and has a authentic taste and feel to it. Pricing is good \u00a0and at the mall location the decor isn't to bad the six forks location has a little bit better atmosphere. But if your looking for good Mexican food and are in the area this place is worth more then a try check it out doods!!"], ["Matthew F.", "Great and speedy service. \u00a0I got the shrimp and chorizo tacos and they were absolutely amazing!"], ["Sarah A.", "Really good Mexican. Quick service, good selection, and great food. The whole family enjoyed our dinner."], ["Stephanie H.", "This is just ok, there are so many other delicious Mexican restaurants in the area. Service was prompt but not overly friendly, food was mediocre and that was about it. There wasn't anything special or memorable about the food here and I probably wouldn't think about eating here again."], ["April H.", "I always mean to get something different when I come here (and I've managed to on occasion) but my standby is their carne asada. I love it. That, and as everyone has mentioned, the salsa is pretty dang good."], ["Fred B.", "Had the Al Pastor tacos, DELICIOUS! The rest of the party had the Fajita Quesadilla, Flautas, and a Taco Salad... All good, service was friendly and quick."], ["Adrianna M.", "I have been going here for years and they changed the menu recently and it's even better than before. Will definitely be coming here more often. The plating is not your typical mexican style. \u00a0 The quality of the food has improved and the price is pretty much the same. Drinks were awesome."], ["T. W.", "Aite here with hubby recently while stranded at a hotel for my bad storm. The food was hot delicious and greeted with a smile. If I'm ever in the area again, I'd eat here again."], ["Cassie B.", "The salsa is back to its original stuff! \u00a0Lots if onions and cilantro. Generous with the portions and still friendly staff. I am pleased to say it is back to its original flair. It is still overpriced but I can afford it every now and again...which is okay since it's not exactly diet food. The drink specials are pretty legit too. Good to be back!"], ["Sasha R.", "I picked up a takeout order of chips, salsa, guacamole and cheese dip while staying in a hotel across the street. The food was actually really good. The queso had a spicy kick, the guacamole was chunky and fresh, and the salsa was refreshing. The only reason I didn't rate this as five stars was due to the take-out portion size. I received inly one small bag of chips and one small salsa container for my two orders of cheese dip and one order of guacamole. Most Mexican restaurants will give you one salsa and one bag of chips per order of cheese dip or guacamole. The salsa, guacamole and cheese dips each came in a small styrofoam container approximately 3 inches tall by 2 inches wide. While the food was actually delicious, $14 was too high for the amount received."], ["Brian S.", "Tried this place for the first time on Tuesday night. \u00a0DO NOT EAT HERE if you want to stay healthy! \u00a0after eating here my girlfriend and I both fell ill with gastroenteritis, a gastrointestinal virus, that we have now been sick with for 3 days. \u00a0This was the only change in our routine so this was the source of our sickness! \u00a0Also the cheese dip we ordered came out in a tiny salsa bowl and paid $4 for it. \u00a0Any other Mexican restaurant would bring out an actual descent size bowl of queso not a tiny little salsa bowl. \u00a0So not only did I over pay for something as simple as cheese dip but both my girlfriend and I have missed 3 days of work due to this first time experience. \u00a0I will never go back and recommend nobody else does unless you want to risk getting sick!"], ["Anne K.", "Yuck! \u00a0If they gave me a coupon for a free dinner, I don't think I would eat here again. \u00a0We started with the queso, which was average. \u00a0The esquites looked delicious in the photo and it is a favorite of ours at other restaurants, so we decided to try it. \u00a0Sadly it was made with canned corn. \u00a0Canned corn? \u00a0There is no excuse for canned produce in North Carolina in May, none. \u00a0The refried beans are also canned, which is not as bad as canned corn to be sure, but really needed something to elevate them in flavor.I ordered veggie enchiladas and they were not very good at all. \u00a0They were filled with a variety of mixed grilled veggies (not canned at least) that included onions and peppers, tomatoes, zucchini, yellow squash, and broccoli. \u00a0In the right context I love broccoli, but is not a very Mexican flavor and it doesn't grill up well. \u00a0It was uncomfortably crunchy in my enchiladas. \u00a0And to make matters worse, the whole order was smothered in sour cream - which is do not care for. \u00a0In my opinion, a restaurant should mention it on the menu if they are going to put a condiment all over your food. \u00a0The Mexican rice was average and that is about all I ate on my plate.When I was away from the table, the waiter asked if we wanted a box for the enchiladas and my husband said no. \u00a0He explained that I didn't like them, and the waiter shrugged and carried them away. \u00a0No questions, no concern, no offers to make it right, no bringing the manager. \u00a0Talk about rotten service!My son loved his enchilada, beans, and rice - though there was a strange cinnamon under taste to the enchilada sauce (which I'll bet was also canned). \u00a0My husband liked the carnitas well enough to box up the leftovers. \u00a0So, given their preferences, I will not score this restaurant with one star as I am tempted.I do not know what my fellow Yelpers see in this place. \u00a0It is really the worst Mexican food I have had in the area and when you add in the bad service, I see zero reason to return here.--AnneK"], ["Mark D.", "This is the La Rancherita at Crabtree Mall. It's out of the way, and a bit difficult to get to on foot - especially if it's raining. The food was very mediocre. A certain stale, wet cardboard smell permeated the place, and it also seemed to permeate the rice. . . Overall, it was edible and the service was very friendly and the place seemed clean. But I've realy liked this chain at other locations, but not here so much. I wouldn't go back."], ["Rachel O.", "I have been dissatisfied with many other mexican restaurants in the area but this place has never disappointed! The atmosphere is bright and colorful, not unlike other mexican restaurants but in particular I love the giant gold sun in their lobby. I have been here several times and have always experianced exceptional service and hot fresh food! The chicken is hot, juicy and full of flavor! Their margaritas are strong but not overwhelming! Be careful if you order the 'big' beer bc its close to 40oz! The prices are fair, a little more expensive then typical mexican places but cheaper then main stream places like chillis or applebees. I give them a 5 out of 5 for atmosphere, musc, food, service and prices!"], ["B C.", "Review based on dozens of visits!!This is Mexican along the lines of El Dorado or El Rodeo, but in my opinion, it's a step above those chains -- if for no other reason than their salsa. The salsa at La Rancherita is thick and chunky, and you can tell it's made fresh with fresh \u00a0ingredients. At some Mexican places, the salsa is so pureed it's like eating tomato sauce out of a can. Not here! Salsa is excellent.All the standard Mexican fare (tacos, enchiladas, quesadillas etc) are good. But I like the steak tacos and shrimp tacos. Someone else here described the restaurant as \"out of the way\" -- but that's a very subjective complaint. I live close by so it's very convenient for me. Granted, there are peak mall hours when I wouldn't go near the place just because of mall traffic, but if you're at Crabtree anyway (and thousands of people are every day), it's a great location. It's better than the food court and more affordable than all the upscale places they've added in recent years.Also, I've probably eaten here dozens of times over the past few years, so my review isn't based on one trip."], ["Nate P.", "Just had the carne asada yesterday, delicious, order comes with 2 enchiladas, beans and rice, the service is always solid as this restaurant is well staffed, the flan is a very high quality and a nice sized portion as well, patio dining available and useful - to go orders are quick and a reward coupon for frequent visitors is a nice touch, stop by and enjoy, tell em Se\u00f1or Nester sent you"], ["Angie R.", "The food was great for the price. The restaraunt is decorated in bright colors and played spanish music, it felt like we were eating in Mexico.We got our food in about 10 minutes, and it wasn't because it was pre-made. Everything was fresh and delicious! I would recommend this restaurant to everyone!"], ["Anna S.", "This is one of my favorite Mexican places in Raleigh! Everything tastes great, except the refried beans, so stick with black beans. The wait staff is also very attentive and polite."], ["Asa C.", "La Rancherita, like it's name, is your average Mexican restaurant... the decor is nothing to write about and while the service was efficient, the food itself was standard (but good). Portions were extremely large and the salsa was also good. My only complaint... which is more of a notation, is that the three flour wraps that came with the fajitas were extremely small (especially considering the generous portion size on the sizzling platter).So, if you are at the Mall, or in Best Buy and have a hankern' for Mexican then La Rancherita will neither disappoint nor impress you."], ["Isaac K.", "Seriously one of my favorite restaurants in Raleigh. I come here often for business lunches...always get us in and out in time for lunch. The salsa, guacamole, and queso is really great. Chips are always hot and fresh. Service is fast and good...food always comes out on time even if they are very busy.The burritos are great, everything here is worth a try. Strangely, the one thing I was not super impressed with was the tacos...but it is okay, they have the fajita burrito which makes up for it all. Parking and getting in there is difficult...its just a strange parking lot.It can get very loud here."], ["Ben F.", "I've tried all the major Mexican restaurants in Raleigh and rated them based on service, food, and atmosphere. \u00a0This one comes out as the best. Come for lunch or dinner, you will be treated well and you will eat well. \u00a0I highly recommend if you're looking for some good ole [North Carolinian] Mexican food."], ["Cindy H.", "This is my favorite place for Mexican food besides Dos Taquitos. Dos Taquitos is slightly pricier but mostly, a longer wait on a weekend night. But La Rancherita is easy to get a table,quick service and very friendly. The food is great and they have a variety of choices that go outside the standard Mexican \"American\" menus."], ["Jamie M.", "We were hankering for some Mexican and this place was directly across from our hotel. \u00a0It's located on the corner of the Crabtree Mall, behind Best Buy. \u00a0I think we got here around 5:30 on a Saturday and there were maybe half a dozen tables full.The chips and salsa were fine, they used a lot of cilantro in the salsa which we both really enjoyed. \u00a0My boyfriend got his usual chimichangas which were really good. \u00a0I decided to branch out and try something new. \u00a0There was a lamb dish on the menu (I've never seen lamb at a Mexican restaurant before). \u00a0I don't remember the name of the dish but it was described as a Mexican BBQ (perhaps a birria?). \u00a0It definitely had some interesting flavors I wasn't used to...it was neat to try once but I don't think I'd get it again.Our server was very nice, he seemed concerned that I didn't like my dish since it didn't look like I had eaten a lot. \u00a0I actually had eaten quite a bit, there was just so much meat on the plate that it was hard to make a good dent. \u00a0Total damage - $27 for two dinners and two beers."], ["Jonny K.", "Great food and excellent service! \u00a0From the moment I walked in, I was treated very, very well. The chips and salsa were amazing, and they just kept them coming. \u00a0I never had to ask for more. \u00a0The main food was also fantastic (I had the tacos el pastor). \u00a0Another thing I appreciated was that they always kept my glass full. \u00a0I drink a lot of water, so it's always nice to have a server who notices when I need more. \u00a0Again, great food and excellent service!"], ["Hannah W.", "La Rancherita was the second Mexican place I hit on Cinco de Mayo this year, and I enjoyed my visit very much. Obviously you have to take into account the fact that going on a Mexican holiday is going to have an impact on how crazy busy they are and what the service is like, but that was my only complaint. I started out with a JUMBO frozen strawberry margarita - quite tasty, and my friend and I split an order of queso dip - which was exactly what I was looking for. I'm not big on their salsa, but queso dip is something they definitely do right. My only issue with the margarita was that it was salt-rimmed instead of sugar-rimmed. It seemed like if you order a sweeter margarita, like the strawberry, you should offer the sugar instead. When my friend asked for the sugar instead of salt the waiter was very confused. Anyway we had a really leisurely dinner...it took forever because when they say JUMBO, they're not kidding. It took a long time for me to down that margarita. They were crazy packed, every single table full, but we still had attentive service. It did take us a while to get our silverware once the meals had come, but I can forgive that. I ordered a plain cheese quesadilla, opting to leave as much stomach room as possible for alcohol. My friend got some flautas de pollo which she said she really enjoyed. We both needed to-go boxes, though. I think a JUMBO strawberry marg, half a queso, and a plain cheese quesadilla ran me about $13 before tip. Not too shabby. It was average, but satisfying. I will definitely go again. A few of the waitresses are mega-hot. Good times."], ["Gwendolyn M.", "The chips and rice were the tastiest part of our meal. \u00a0Enchiladas had no flavor, and my taco shell literally fell apart after the grease from the meat soaked into it. \u00a0Their margarita menu is confusing and I couldn't taste any alcohol in the one I ordered. \u00a0Would pass unless you're stuck in the area and dying for slightly overpriced Mexican-American."], ["John D.", "Tacos di Bistec or Tacos de Tingas...as good as they get. \u00a0We are regular customers and really like the food. \u00a0We don't go for the decorations but you get great food at a great price. \u00a0I have taken family here and have recommended to my friends. \u00a0We live on the western side of Cary and make the drive to Crabtree without hesitation."]]}
