Let me first come clean that I'm gluten-free. I've tried a few places GF fare and was thrilled: Amante and zpizza, so was curious to try Mellow's version. Gotta say... I was less than impressed by the creative topping options and pizzas they have available. Also, I felt pretty sick the next day. I think it was the toppings and not the dough though. Also, they only have 1 size available for GF pizzas and it was extremely pricey. 1 pizza and a glass of house wine was $35! Crap, I could have had a filet and a class of wine at Sullivans. There menu is generally very limited for the GF crowd. Sadly, I think I'll be going to zpizza for my next GF indulgence.Sorry MM. :("], ["Rachel M.", "I was extremely bitter after coming here because the groupon of the day was for here and i didn't see it! So before you go here check your daily goupon! Other than that i wasn't too impressed with their pizza. We ordered the Red Skin Potato Pie pizza, but everything except for the sour cream, mounds of cheese, and ranch dressing seemed non-existent. Was below what I'd get at a Pizza Hut in my opinion.However, the atmosphere is great, the servers are pretty good, and the alcohol list is pretty extensive if you enjoy a good drink. I'd probably come back again with friends because it is a nice place for groups and the foods bearable."], ["Filipe T.", "There's nothing like a Mellow Mushroom pizza and some beers to go with it.

Definitely our pizza place of choice; this location is always clean and friendly when we visit."], ["Jennifer C.", "Mellow Mushroom has an extensive menu and I've sampled quite a bit of it. Before I was gluten free I regularly visited the Shroom for a beer and their awesome pretzels liberally dosed with Parmesan cheese. Get the order of 5 and take some home, trust me. Who wants to go to a restaurant just to eat salad? If it's a Mellow Mushroom salad, pick me pick me!! Their Esperanza dressing is the BOMB and their salads, even the smaller size, are huge and have a variety of ingredients, not just your typical lettuce, tomato, crouton. Get a small salad and pretzels if you feel that bad about it. The pizza is also top notch in my opinion. I loved the wheat crust, they have a huge array of toppings (even green olives and bacon, which is my fave I don't care if anyone thinks it gross. Try it and then talk to me.) They have some awesome specialty pizzas (Muffuletta, they did one with mashed potato \"sauce\" once). Now that I'm gluten free I stick to salads and their gluten free pizza. It's not the best gluten free pizza in the world, but it's better than nothing! Pizza is one thing that I still haven't been able to find as good gluten free as it's non-gluten free variety. Get LOTS of toppings and you'll be able to overcome it. I recommend at least three. It definitely gets loud in the restaurant and outside, especially on a busy day. But their outdoor area is spacious (covered \"porch\" and uncovered area available). If you can't deal with drunk people I wouldn't visit past 9pm on a weekend or you'll deal with the Glenwood South crowd."], ["Kristian C.", "Great food.

It surprised me since it's usually overflowing with people, but this time it was the inside that was full and not the out. I think we were lucky due to the chilly weather and the absence of fair-goers. We got a decent table near the fence -- my only complaint was it was a bit *dark*. They could use a little more lighting in certain areas. I was a bit nervous to sit out on the patio, due to the frequent street solicitors on Glenwood Ave. -- but the fence that surrounded the enclosure let me give out a great sigh of relief! *swig*My friend and I ordered Big Boss Harvest Time (pumpkin seasonal) and it was absolutely delightful. For grub, we went with a medium Maui Wowie for three of us -- which allotted to two slices per person (6 slices total). The pesto base was interesting, since I'm used to tomato-based sauce with ham and pineapple combos. The jerk chicken and banana peppers were a little wrench in this pizza -- I did not enjoy the tangy chicken because it was dry and out of place. The Applewood bacon and mozzarella cheese were the saving grace of this pizza -- c'mon, who doesn't like BACON?The waitress was sweet and on point -- our glasses never got empty. Pizza came out at a decent time too! Definitely want to come back for a *warmer* afternoon on this patio with another cold one and a calzone for a change!"], ["Jenessy A.", "The dough is amazeballs!As I walk in, I remember to take my allergy medicine because I am allergic to tomatoes and I am in the land of. Gah! I resort to having a barbecue blended pizza which I customized to my liking with spinach, ricotta cheese and more cheese. To my surprise BBQ also has ketchup in it which has tomatoes. Fun times right? I still ate it and didn't blow up so I was in the safe zone. The pizza servings were big for one person, I would've easily shared with someone and the bread, oh my.

And for some of you who may float in my boat of anti-tomatoes can still participate in this awesome guilty pleasure."], ["Rob W.", "This is the place to go for Pizza. It is always lively here.

On a good night however, the aroma of freshly baked dough and delicious toppings will open up that appetite for you.What's very unique about Mellow Mushroom pizza, IMHO, they add (perhaps) cornmeal into the dough? There is a slightly sweet taste and the dough is more snappy (less soft and chewy).There is a good number of veggie-lover choices on the menu, but of course I enjoy their more meaty choices.

Even after the second attempt each steak returned the same only slightly darker than before instead of wasting more food everyone accepted the incorrect orders and thanked her for her polite and professional attempts. I give two stars and wish that yelp would allow separate reviews, 1 for customer service and 1 for food because her level and respect for her craft is/was amazing and deserved 10 stars (which I don't say often), but the food is over priced and no better than that of Long Star or an average steak house and for what we received tonight I would give 1 star!"], ["Scott S.", "Flemings is solid, but nothing spectacular. \u00a0I actually came to this location twice in the last few weeks - once for restaurant week and once because they gave us a free $25 gift-certificate for being a new customer at this location - which was awesome!The food is quite expensive, but good. \u00a0During restaurant week, both my steak (fillet mignon!) and my GF's came out cold. \u00a0Yes, cold. \u00a0The inside was kind of warm. \u00a0I was pretty POed but I never say anything at restaurants in situations like this, so dealt with it. \u00a0Anyway the flavor was still ok.The second time we went, the fillet mignon was basically perfectly cooked, I was very happy with it. \u00a0It was also \u00a0enormous.Oh yea, and sides are extra and served family style. \u00a0So that raises the cost even higher.I'll probably go back eventually, but not without a financial incentive, there's enough steakhouses in raleigh to keep me happy for a while. \u00a0For this price, I'd choose angus barn."], ["Jon M.", "Just finished having dinner at Flemings in Raleigh North Carolina.

The sides were yummy - but I didn't go there for the sides - it's a steak house. The wine was good and kept me happy. We didn't order appetizers because we knew we would not have enough room for the steak. The truffles they sent home were delicious and probably the best part of the experience.

Every time I have been in there there's only been one waiter or waitress on and if they were to get busy they can't handle it. I will say the server we had last time was very attentive and it was busy for it being a snow day. One of the biggest disappoints was ordering a whiskey on the rocks and finding out it was an additional 2$ for it being on ice, and I can say they charged for the ice because there wasn't hardy any whiskey in the glass. it was watered down by the time it was given to us. The menu in general is a headache trying to figure out what has an additional charge is and what isn't . The menu looks like a 3 year old wrote it.

The service was absolutely incredible and flawless. \u00a0There was so much attention to detail in how the food was served and how each course was properly prepped for. It was definitely some of the best service I've ever had from a high end restaurant. For Mother's Day, there was a three course meal for $55 a person. I chose the French onion soup, braised short rib, and chocolate raspberry marquise. Overall, the food was amazing with great depths of flavor in each course. \u00a0Although French food is known to come in small portions, I was very full after the three courses. I started off with the French onion soup, which only felt right at a French restaurant. The soup was awesome. The broth was so tasty and the onions were perfectly cooked and caramelized. The Gruyere cheese imported from France really brought the soup to another level. It was so good I had to get an extra piece of baguette to soak up the soup. My mom ordered the mussels in a white wine sauce, and it was also very good. The sauce was so light, yet had a great creamy flavor that really complemented the mussels well without overpowering it. It was a true French classic. For my entree, I had the braised short rib. The short rib was extremely tender, tender enough to cut with a fork. The sauce was really good and you tell they deglazed the pan with a red wine because all those favors were in the sauce. The carmelized onions on top of the beef made the dish. They were so rich in flavor and the wine used to carmelize them was incredible. The beef was served on top of a perfectly cooked risotto with a side of carrots. Overall, the dish was a great success and very filling. The chocolate raspberry marquise was extremely rich and delicious. It is basically a thick and rich dark chocolate mouse that was served over a sweet raspberry sauce. \u00a0The chocolate was definitely the star of the dessert end is perfect for any dark chocolate lover. I also tried some of the bacon salted caramel ice cream. If you love bacon, you have to have this! \u00a0The bacon flavor is incredibly strong. It literally tastes like you're eating bacon instead of ice cream. \u00a0You can really taste the quality of the bacon and how it was perfectly cooked and infused into the ice cream.

Out of their food dishes, I would recommend the Brie en Croute, Foie Gras, Coquille Saint Jacques and Duck \"en Duo\". But like I said, you can't really go wrong with anything. The best part of everything? You can experience all of this without having to burn a hole through your wallet. Their menu is extremely affordable, especially given the quality and freshness of their food and ingredients. Come here ASAP! I can not endorse this place enough!!"], ["Keiko M.", "Great French Restaurant!When I went there, I was too full to order many things. Once I tried a scallop appetizer, my stomach started groaning again. I ordered escargot and French Pino Noir. Soup de jour was tomato soup. Really rich and so tasty. They served 3 deferent breads. Good but I prefer warm breads. About 60 USD French lunch for two ppl. Sounds pricy but worth it here. But I wish they were a little bit cheaper...

From the moment you step inside, you are treated like a VIP. The soft music playing in the background, white tablecloths and chair covers, and superb service makes each meal here so very special. My friend is moving away (so sad) so last night was our Bon Voyage celebration. The owner Lil Lacassagne is a wine expert, and visits each table, offering to recommend wines based on your preferences and the dishes you are ordering. We shared the Cheese Tasting (a selection of French cheeses served their spice and carrot bread, home baked baguette crostini. Accompanied with honey, nuts and grapes), and Lil recommended the Vouvray. When I tasted the cheeses and then sipped my wine, I finally realized what wine pairing means - it took my taste buds to the next level! I had to order a 2nd glass. It was spectacular. Another server came around with a basket of 3 different fresh breads. Last night they had cranberry rolls, salted focaccia, and rosemary baguettes. I tried the cranberry roll and a slice of rosemary baguette. Both were delicious.For my entree, I chose the Spring Lamb \" Chasseur\". This dish was braised lamb in a dark tomato, mushroom and caramelized onions stew. Succulent reduced roasted juice, served with homemade goat cheese gnocchi. OMG - when the plate was placed before me, the aroma made my mouth water and I had to hold myself back from inhaling it. Slow down and enjoy it Norma! Savor every bite!

This shouldn't be that much of a surprise since the owners are French (in fact, they organize annual trips to France).The only thing that's deceiving about this restaurant is its unassuming location.

The Foie Gras 2 ways was lip-smackingly rich and creamy. \u00a0I preferred the seared hot version as it brought out the earthiness of the liver more. \u00a0It was served with a little pastry and a sweet caramelized onion. \u00a0The port reduction was sweet and complemented the dish. The duck I left up to the Chef to decide the temperature--I think mine was medium to medium rare? It was pleasantly pink in the center. \u00a0The duck was succulent and rich without being greasy. \u00a0It came with a small pile of wonderfully seasoned spaghetti squash which had just enough of a chew to add some texture to an overall soft dish. \u00a0 There was a savory delicate crepe \u00a0stuffed with duck, dried cranberries, and mushrooms. \u00a0Everything tasted great and each component of the dish balanced each other beautifully.

I'll start off by saying a couple things...I'm not a big fan of \"white cloth\" aka fancy restaurants and would prefer a good \"hole in the wall\" joint any day. I'll also so that if I have ever had French food before I cannot remember but if French food gets any better than this then french food may be my new favorite. I am ashamed to admit that I don't really know much about French food outside their bread, cordon bleu and beignets. So naturally I ordered the Brie Pulled Pork and Chicken Cordon Bleu. Sorry, I wish I had taken a picture to post because it was put together very well and it tasted as good as it looked. My girlfriend got the sea bass and it was a very well prepared piece of fish and tasted great as well but I still preferred mine over her's. We also got the Strawberry Parfait for dessert which was absolutely phenomenal. \u00a0Everything we had down to the bread was just too notch. This was a true culinary experience. It's definitely a dressy place and the atmosphere there is nice but don't expect to be blown away. Service was as good as the food. I cannot say enough positive things about this place. All you foodies out there are doing yourself a disservice if you have not been to Saint Jacques. When I save up enough money I will go back...ha!"], ["Liz B.", "I can't confirm or deny that St.Jacques, as the website proclaims, is \"the only true French restaurant in Raleigh.\" \u00a0I can confidently say, however, that this is authentic French cuisine, served in a pleasantly non-stuffy environment.My Francophile, wine-crazy father has been taking me to French restaurants since I've been able to walk, and I have been to many of the most celebrated ones in New York and Paris. \u00a0I lived in France to study art for a semester abroad during college, and have also visited France at least ten times over the course of my life. \u00a0So if there's one cuisine I know well, it's French. \u00a0After reading all the excellent reviews here, I knew that I had to go to Saint Jacques for my birthday dinner. \u00a0After my parents drove down to NC to celebrate with me, we made the trek over to Raleigh to check it out.The restaurant is located in a strip mall, which is unfortunate, but oh well. \u00a0I parked outside a karate studio and walked over to the unassuming exterior. \u00a0And once we entered...oh. \u00a0Weird blinds covering the windows to help us forget that we're in a strip mall, old framed prints on the walls, and weird completely covered chairs which look like wrapped corpses, all in pale whites and greens. \u00a0As others have stated, the decor is not the prettiest. \u00a0We sat at our table and my father immediately busted out his chosen wines. \u00a0(They have a very reasonable corkage fee.) \u00a0At first there were issues with chilling the white wine properly, but eventually it worked out.The servers were dressed up in formal serving attire, but most of the diners appeared to be dressed pretty casually. \u00a0You'd feel awkward in blue jeans or Birkenstocks, but you can get away with slacks and a button down shirt. \u00a0The service was refreshingly unpretentious. \u00a0Our server had a strong Southern accent and was very knowledgeable, yet good-humored. \u00a0You're not going to get a Pepe-Le-Pew with a perpetual sneer and nose in the air.We got a smoked salmon amuse bouche in a little spoon, which was fine but underwhelming. \u00a0They make their own bread, and we had a choice between three types: a white rosemary (by far the best), a focaccia, and a wheat (too hard and not memorable). \u00a0They were frequently out of the white rosemary, which frustrated my bread-loving mother.APPETIZERS:Mushroom risotto (my dish): very creamy, very rich, and a bit too heavy/salty for me. \u00a0I would have preferred to taste more mushroom and less cheese/cream, but the texture was impeccable. \u00a0After the first few enjoyable bites, it became a struggle to finish.Beet and goat cheese salad (Mom's dish): beautifully prepared red and gold beets with warmed goat cheese and greens. \u00a0Light and delicious. \u00a0Mom devoured hers.French onion soup (Dad's dish): definitely the star of the starters. \u00a0You might think that this is a boring starter when you can get onion soup at any mall restaurant, but the Saint Jacques version is a revelation. \u00a0The richest, most delicious broth + \u00a0perfectly caramelized onions + gooey melted Gruyere = heaven.ENTREES:Mignon B\u00e9arnaise (my dish): medium rare, with already cut skinny pieces of beef accompanied by asparagus and truffle fries, as well as bearnaise sauce. \u00a0The beef was flavorful, but not as melty-in-the-mouth as I would have liked. \u00a0I was a bit underwhelmed. \u00a0The asparagus was cooked perfectly well, and the fries were fine but not as crispy or richly truffle flavored as I expected. \u00a0The dish was solid, but not mind-blowing.Black sea bass with spaghetti squash primavera (Mom's dish): the fish was light, moist, and impeccably cooked. \u00a0The spaghetti squash was an unusual counterpart but worked well, soaking up the sauces and seasoning to enhance the dish. \u00a0Mom loved it but ran out of steam halfway through eating it.Duck \"Aux Picholine\" (Dad's dish): Dad is a duck-a-holic and has duck almost every time he goes to a French restaurant, and thought St.J's version was very good but not extraordinary. \u00a0The wild rice side was really the star of this dish; I tasted it, and was blown away by its meaty, earthy flavors.DESSERTS:Cherry Clafoutis (mine): loved, loved, loved it. \u00a0I haven't had clafoutis since my last trip to France, and this version was perfectly authentic. \u00a0It's sort of like a warm, thick, sweet pancake studded with cherries.Home made ice cream/sorbet (parents): delicious. \u00a0There were two flavors, mango chili and dark chocolate. \u00a0Both creamy and richly flavored, especially the to-die-for chocolate. \u00a0My parents demolished it within a couple minutes.Overall, I was very impressed by Saint Jacques, which manages to offer an authentic French cuisine experience in North Carolina--not exactly a haven for French culture or food. \u00a0The decor lacks vitality and elegance (as others have mentioned), and the food doesn't quite measure up to the best I've had in NY and Paris (a pretty high bar), but I was very pleased with my meal here. \u00a0I'll definitely return to try other classic French dishes on their menu."], ["Amanda D.", "Sometimes you forget just how exquisite a meal can be. One visit to this gem will surely remind you. This is, without a doubt, one of the best restaurants in Raleigh. From the crisp white tablecloths, the black or white napkins (depending on your attire), attentive service and expertly prepared dishes, you just can't go wrong. Stepping into to this little restaurant is like stepping into another world. The fresh bread was to die for, the french onion soup the best I've ever had, and the butternut squash ravioli was just sinful. So rich and creamy.

I really will try to be succinct. I brought my wife here for her birthday as she loves French food, even my meager stabs at it. We've been to Rue Cler and Vin rouge, and while we enjoyed them both, Saint Jacques raised the bar. We arrived at the strip mall next to the Harris Teeter, smiled and went in where we were courteously greeted and shown to our reservation. Everyone was friendly, the area was small but filled with tables in a way that you still felt private as much as one could expect. The server was prompt and helpful in navigating the menu. I had a lot of questions and he was patient, helpful and not a bit condescending which was very greatly appreciated. Yes, I'm not a gourmand, but please be nice as I try new and fancy food. I usually don't factor in service in my reviews; it's just not an issue for me as I focus on the food. But for those who are interested, the service here is impeccable. Really, you won't be disappointed. Wife started with the bacon and bleu cheese torte with a blackberry gelee that was full of flavor and struck a nice balance. She ordered the duck which came med rare, brilliantly crispy on the outside, moist and tender breast meat, and her favorite part was the port wine caramel sauce that brought out succulent flavors of the duck. I had the sweetbreads, and honestly, they were excellent. I've never had them before so heads up there, but the cutlets were lightly breaded, tender and well-seasoned on a little frittata of potatoes, sausage and cabbage. Very unique and delicious! I then had the scallops with mushroom, roasted pork belly topped with pomegranate foam. Sounds odd, I know, but it added a really smooth and subtle fruit flavor to the scallops, which were excellently prepared by the way. Great dish. It was on a bed of creamed spinach like none I've ever had. Every bite would push a little seasoned cream out the edges and fill your mouth with a sweet prize of fantastical flavor!Desserts were great as well. We had the lemon millefeuille and the Vacherin, each well balanced, not overly sweet, but great texture and taste. Overall, Saint Jacques gets a full 5 stars. I think Nana's is a notch or two better, but that's not to discount the quality and creativity of the meal here. A very excellent choice.Last comment is on the bathrooms. What a pleasant change! They have an assortment of hygiene products, lotion, breath mints, mouthwash, dental floss, q-tips, magazines, variety of feminine products (per wife) and even deodorant. Not that I am into using a communal under-arm product, but I guess if it was that tragic, you'd be grateful it was there. First dates anyone...??? Even the paper towels are sturdier than any bounty sheet I've ever touched. Well done!"], ["Heather B.", "Authentic French Cuisine In An Unexpected PlaceVisit: April 17Within minutes of crossing the threshold of the Saint Jacques, I was transported to a little caf\u00e9 in a narrow side alley of Paris. The owners created an ambiance of quaint French elegance making it oh so easy to forget the unfortunate locale in a strip mall, the North Ridge Shopping Center at the corner of Falls of the Neuse and Spring Forest Roads, close to the Harris Teeter. The only difference between the interior of Saint Jacques and equivalent Parisian bistro was we were not seated within inches, elbow to elbow, with other patrons.My husband and I began our journey into Saint Jacques cuisine with an aperitif. We selected the Marquis De La Tour Rose Brut from Loire. \u00a0Since we will be visiting Loire Valley this summer, we are trying to learn more about the wines from this region to enhance our holiday. We enjoyed this bright, crisp, and lightly effervescent rose. We decided to share the Old World Warm Goat Cheese Salad. The spinach salad was topped with a oblong piece of goat cheese that was very lightly breaded and pan fried mounted on a crusty buttered piece of French bread. The goat cheese was simply divine. To me, it tasted like a tangy brie...all melty richness with the bite of goat cheese. Very lovely. I really liked the addition of the small grapes to this dish and with the peach vinaigrette, a subtle sweetness added another layer of complexity to the salad.My husband and I try to adhere to a pescatarian diet (vegetarian + fish) so we were pleased to see 3 entrees featuring fish and all 3 sounded amazing. By the way, I later found out that Saint Jacques offers a vegetarian menu with a few items that are vegan and gluten free. \u00a0If you are a vegetarian, ask for the menu. I chose the Champagne Corvina and Andy ordered the Scallops on Their Crispy Seafood Pillows. Since our knowledge of French wine is weak we asked our server for recommendations for our entrees. He sent the sommelier over to discuss our options. The sommelier was French, loved his accent. I was immediately impressed and confident we would receive a fabulous pairing. The sommelier did something unusual from most of my previous experiences, he asked us about our preferences. We actually had a short conversation about what kind of wines we like and based on this info he made recommendations. Let me just say it...wow! My confidence was not misplaced. The sommelier paired a chardonnay with my entr\u00e9e, which was a white fish with firm flesh similar to Sea Bass but it was the sauce that the sommelier was aiming for. The Champagne dill cream sauce was lusciously rich and creamy and there was an accent of acidic tomato involved. The un-oaked chardonnay came alive and enhanced the dish while the food improved the flavor of the wine. A sensational pairing. The white fish was perfectly prepared...moist, light, and flakey. The combination of the crabmeat with the white beans, spinach, and cream sauce was to die for. Half way through our meal, my husband and I switched plates. The scallops were a delight, also perfectly cooked so each bite melted in my mouth. I was not overly impressed with the seafood pillows, basically a fried ravioli. I thought the ravioli was dry with too much dough. Andy thought they were great. Well, we are each entitled to an opinion. I did love the lemon and tarragon b\u00e9chamel cream sauce. Yes, the French know cream sauces and the chef at Saint Jacques knows his/her stuff. The lemon flavor was pronounced and it paired exceptional well with the Riesling from Lucien Albrecht that the sommelier suggested. The wine list comprises wines from the major regions of France. In addition to the extensive collection of French wines, there are a few bottles of wines produced in North Carolina and small selection of bottles of domestic and international beer.Since we shared an appetizer, we had hoped to have room for dessert but it wasn't the case. We will have to try dessert on another visit. Saint Jacques tasted like the restaurants I have dined at in Paris. I can't wait to go back so I can feel like I'm in Paris without the 8 hour plane trip."], ["Anthony G.", "Words cannot describe how amazing this place is.

We then shared French Onion Soup(more boring, but classics are classics for a reason) which was rich and perfectly seasoned, with a thick topping of \u00a0imported Gruyere cheese.We shared an entree of sauteed Halibut, scallops, and shrimp in puff pastry with a \u00a0sauce of butter, herbs, and small green peas. Again simply awesome.The service was impeccable, attentive but no hovering. The Chef/Owner Lil was not there that night, he was on a \"date\" with his daughter, but his wife, Lori was there, and visited our table several times to see if we needed anything. This is just a great French restaurant, the best by far in North Carolina, and one of the best in the country - and we have eaten at some great ones in NYC. We will definitely return, and soon."], ["Anthony G.", "I'm tres indignant! I made reservations three weeks ago for St. Cocks or Jacques to dine there on Valentines day. I got dressed up and we went \u00a0to St. Crap. \u00a0We got there 10 minutes early and the woman could not find my name finally we were found and seated. The place was tres Fran-say. very pretty with waiters walking around sans smile and avec waxed faces. We got a prixe fixe menu that was $80.00 dollars per person because it was Valentines Day! I was like what? Now when I made reservations three weeks ago the owner did not say anything about a special menu as he should've mentioned. And today when they called to confirm they did not say it either. We got there hungry and dying to try the food and when I told the owner that no one had said anything about a special menu and not the regular menu he was like Oh, well, \u00a0come back another time. Now Had I been the owner I would've apologized and given the person a regular menu because one should always accommodate \u00a0BUT instead he was like whatevs bitches. This pretentious place is nestled between a Jumbo China and Muscle Max very attractive very chic. So we went to Tribeca Tavern dressed for St, Jacques and spent maybe $30.00.

The service was warm and gracious, and they made my husband feel special from the moment we arrived. The food was outstanding, also. We had the escargots, short ribs (my favorite!), a grouper special, and the \"Chocolate Ball of Dream\" for dessert. Every bite was perfection. We definitely want to return, and it was well worth the investment to have such a special night.

After finally getting around to eating here, I just gotta say... it's a shame I didn't come here sooner! Tazza Kitchen is fantastic. My boyfriend and I went here for dinner the other night, and the atmosphere, the food, and the service were all wonderful.We ordered and shared the following three items:1. Cast iron goat cheese appetizer 2. Kale and chilies salad (w/ chicken added) 3. Spicy sausage and black pepper honey pizza All three were off the charts.. so good.. why didn't I come here sooner.... goat cheese appetizer.... warm, delicious bread........ kale and chilies... spicy sausage..... pizza.. mhmSorry, so easy to get carried away with food as tasty as this. Anyways, from what we experienced, the quality of the food here is top-notch. Fresh and flavorful--you can taste the difference. I didn't feel like anything was overpriced either, especially for the quality and portion sizes. An appetizer and two entrees were able to fill us up pretty well, and let me tell you, we can eat. The atmosphere was nice and relaxed with the decor being a mix between modern and rustic, which again, I adored. Overall, I had a great time. No major no-nos in my book :) If you haven't ventured here yet, I urge you to do so! You won't be disappointed."], ["Kelsey T.", "I FINALLY got to try the Spicy Sausage and Black Pepper Honey pizza that everyone has been raving about! If other restaurants are smart, they'll start having honey as a toppings option also. The contrast between the spicy sausage and the black pepper with the sweet honey worked amazingly. Another thing that I really like about Tazza's pizzas is that they have very thin crusts. It makes the pizza not too filling and I don't feel like I'm in a food coma when I finish, unlike my experiences at most pizza places. I wouldn't recommend these pizzas for sharing, unless you are ordering some other items, because of this reason (And also because it is just too good to share). But another thing with them having such a thin crust, is that the weight of the toppings and cheese overpower it a bit, so the crust went somewhat limp. But it really does taste amazing.Now that I've done my part raving about the pizza, back to the rest of the meal. I'm a sucker for goat cheese and I knew I wanted to order it after seeing the many pictures of it on yelp. It came out super hot, but I couldn't wait for it to cool off. Even when it was burning my tongue, the richness of the cheese was delicious. The bread that came with it for dipping was good too. It was a sturdy bread that could hold its own with the cheese.We went on a Wednesday night and the restaurant was pretty busy, but the service was good The restaurant was very clean and I love the d\u00e9cor. There is something about it that is simple, yet trendy. Overall, it was a great experience and definitely want to come back and try their brunch."], ["Farah K.", "So my experience at Tazza was very disappointing! I will start off with the positives: 1) the customer service was great, the server was attentive, friendly and even comped the chicken on my salad (I will explain later why she did this)2) the decor is cute and cleanNow for the negatives:1) I ordered the spinach and apple salad with chicken. The salad was nothing special and my chicken was EXTREMELY over cooked making it taste like old rubber. I picked out all the chicken and left it on a plate, hence why it was comped! 2) I also ordered a side of beets which were flavorless and watered down- it was a very unpleasant taste. My friend ordered the butternut squash as a side and I was quite underwhelmed.I expected way more considering how fresh and delicious the description of the items sounded but unfortunately as of now I won't be returning!"], ["Sohini G.", "Was unexpectedly and pleasantly surprised by this place! We were craving pizza and came here mildly sweaty in work out clothes. We were a little out of place, however sat outside and wasn't a big deal. Drinks---seemed pretty average. Got a couple glasses of wine. Didn't try any cocktails but the prices were average. \u00a0Ambiance/service---cute patio! Great service Food---delicious. We split the chorizo nachos and the sausage and honey pizza. Both awesome. The nacho chips were unique (I think maybe made with fried wontons?) and better than tortilla chips. The pizza was delicious...the sausage and honey combination was amazing. The thin crust was also perfectly baked. They say it's personal pizza size, but splitting an app and pizza was perfect for 2 of us and we left stuffed. Overall great food and a good place to catch up with friends. Would def frequent here if I lived closer, only wish they had a happy hour!"], ["Alexa L.", "Great food! Great atmosphere! okay service..We came for brunch and my fiance got the spicy sausage and black pepper honey pizza, which was very very good--sort of sweet with a spicy kick. I got the huevos rancheros which was pretty good, but not something i'd come back for. The decor is great, and you can tell it's a hip spot as a lot of college students/young professionals seem to eat here.One thing I wasn't a fan of was the service. I understand brunch is a busy time for the restaurant, but we hardly saw the server, and it was a LONG time waiting for our food to come out."], ["Shannan C.", "This review is based solely on my two Sunday Brunch experiences, and I really can't speak to dinner, but I've enjoyed both trips to Tazza and I don't even live in Raleigh (SoDU WHAT WHAT!?!) I've dined here about 11am on Sunday twice and can say that it's a cute spot for brunch. I've had both the Crab Eggs Benedict and the Breakfast Platter. The crab eggs Benedict was really good, but not quite enough food for a large appetite, so the second go round I went with the breakfast platter which was a decent amount of food. Tazza's coffee is also extremely good. Restaurant coffee can be hit or miss. This coffee is on point. So the reduction in a star is the because of the restroom situation. And it is a situation. One that they really need to remedy at some point. There are only two bathrooms- one men's and one women's and its really not enough for a busy restaurant. I'm not even 100% sure how the building code restroom requirement is being met here unless they've slowly added more seating since they opened..."], ["Elizabeth K.", "\"Know your farmers, love your food.\"^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ already a good start!Tazza has a wonderful, unique wine selection. I like having more by the glass options that tastes great than having to choose a bottle from pages of wines.. (I recommend the Cococciola!)The food was simple and delicious. We had the shrimp & crispy polenta and the garganelli pasta & fennel sausage. I liked the fresh tomatoey-ness of the first dish, but not a huge fan of the texture of the polenta. The exterior was crispy but since most of the polenta has been soaking in the broth, it was mostly mushy. But I liked the earthy flavor of the polenta. THE PASTA WAS DELICIOUS. First off, the pasta was perfectly cooked. I mean, not overcooked and not too al dente; it was just perfect. Combined with the salty fennel sausage, it was a simple pasta dish that I will daydream about for days. The chocolate budino is luscious. Presented in a small glass jar, it looks like a homemade chocolate pudding/custard/mousse/fudge goodness. The topped almond and salt flakes really helped compliment the richness of the chocolate. It may be a bit overwhelming for those who aren't obsessed with chocolate though. I thought I was....but good thing my friend and I shared one!No big complaints about this lovely restaurant. Prices are just as expected for $$. Great vibes, friendly service, and yummy food & wine. I definitely plan on returning!"], ["Brittanie H.", "We come here pretty often and it's always spot on. Tonight we got something old and tried some new things. Instead of my Moscow mule, I decided, per our awesome waiter's suggestion, to opt for a Kentucky Mule which is the same just with bourbon instead of vodka. It was quite tasty and still had that ginger beer punch but with a smooth, southern quality. For a starter we did the poppy Caesar which is a really well-executed version of a traditional Caesar. However, the lackluster romaine is replaced with a beautiful rainbow chard, the Parmesan with gran padano and beautiful brown butter croutons. The dressing is clearly made in-house and is light but flavorful. You will scrape the plate for every dressing covered shred of gran padano! Mark my word. For our entrees, we got our regular spicy sausage and black pepper honey and we also tried the three meat. Let me just say that the sausage and honey NEVER disappoints. The honey melds so well with the sausage in a way that's truly above the status quo. They have a similar spicy sweet pairing with the three meats. It's topped with a carrot slaw which creates a perfect balance of flavors. This is no ordinary pizza my friends. This is premium-ingredient, farm-fresh amazingness. The meal was great from start to finish."], ["Shawn N.", "Met my expectations and then some!!! One thing to note...I felt the crowd was a little pretentious for my liking but other than that everything was excellent including the service. We sat inside, the chairs/tables are a little small but you can manage.Food wise....the menu is small but specialized, combos that you may never think about. For example, we had the sausage and honey pizza. The size of the pizza is like a small with very thin crust. Easily tackled by one person. The taste was heavenly!! Everything flowed perfectly together including the nice crisp crust, delish! Also had the chicken tacos w/ a side of watermelon. The tacos were very complex, taste wise. You could tell that there were a lot of flavors but they came together perfectly. The watermelon had a splash of oj with mint and cheese, intriguing as it was it worked as well. Just a piece of advice....call ahead to get your name on the list! We went on a Saturday at 7, when I called it was a 25min wait....took us 20mins to get there...walked in and our table was ready!

Love the view of the open kitchen and wood fire oven in the back. There's a decent sized bar area too.Started with the Brussels sprouts and goat cheese dip because we couldnt decide on one! And glad we got both because they were perfect together. The goat cheese was mixed in with a tomato/marinara sauce and came with basically the bread/dough they use for the pizza. It was good! but if you don't like goat cheese, beware that it does taste strongly of goat cheese.I make Brussels sprouts all the time at home so I was semi-hesitant on ordering. but NO... GET IT! SO GOOD! I don't even like bacon but it was amazing! super flavorful and loved the mustard seeds.Of course we had to get the black pepper honey pizza which was delicious. I thought it was comparable to pizzeria toro (my friend says toro is better) but i thought it was super delicious. the sausage is super flavorful, slightly spicy, balancing out with the honey, and the crust was thin and crisp. We were awfully full and couldn't finish everything but had to get dessert of course. Got the flourless orange cake with caramel gelato. I am typically not a fan of caramel, but it wasn't overly sweet which was good. the dessert itself was not super sweet in general which was good after a semi-heavy meal.Overall, service was great.

We got their spicy sausage & black pepper honey pizza, cast iron goat cheese, and meatballs.I never thought honey could compliment pizza so well!

Admittedly, I was a little disappointed when I pulled into the parking lot to find Cafe Catura no longer there, but I'm so glad we decided to be adventurous and try out the new resident. Tazza is apparently under the same ownership as Catura, so it had that going for it. Top that off with a great new concept (New American, dinner-centric, creative updates to classic recipes, a bar focused on craft cocktails and a quality beer and wine list) and we have a winner! Because it's gained popularity quickly, we did find there was a wait to sit inside. However, we agreed to take an immediate seat on the enclosed patio, which ended up being a great choice. With both a toasty space heater and strings of Edison lights overhead, I think I actually prefer this atmosphere to the darker interior. On top of the stellar ambiance (did I mention the soundtrack was consistently on point? Hip but homey and never too loud) the food was fantastic. We started with a chunky flavorful guacamole served with homemade tostadas, then moved on to a hearty, Crispy Potato and Arugula Salad and rustic Fish Tacos. Both were unique and impressive. I took half of my salad home as leftovers. It didn't even make it to the next day - \u00a0by 11pm I was retrieving it from the fridge and starting this review. Bravo, Tazza!

You must try this if you go here! Apparently there is some guy in Richmond who only makes salted caramel gelato for Tazza Kitchen. And he is a master.

I thought the olive oil cake was okay but really enjoyed the orange almond cake and salted caramel ice cream. The ice cream is a little on the sweet side but the almond cake helps balance it out.

I didn't realize rolls could actually make a meal more enjoyable. I also tried a little of the mimosa. I guess I'm supposed to say it was good since it had freshly-squeezed orange juice, but I thought having pulp in a mimosa was a little bit weird. It tasted great, but had a strange consistency.

It's been my go to place to meet a group of friends for dinner or even just to grab some cocktails at the bar. They really do a great job serving up only the freshest food and changing up the menu by what veggies etc. are in season at the time. The bartenders are skilled and can make a mean mojito, hand crushing the ice and all.I love the atmosphere at Tazza and really enjoy dining on their patio. Plus the service is always top notch which keeps me coming back time and time again. Some menu favorites right now for me are the Brick Oven Oysters, Brick Oven Carrots, and the Potato and Arugula salad. But now let's talk about my latest visit and why I'm giving Tazza 5 stars. They just started their brunch service and they are putting out some tasty dishes. Thanks to Kuanyu C for putting together the UYE brunch, we had a great group of Yelpers to enjoy this beautiful Sunday afternoon on the patio. Of course it wouldn't be a Yelp brunch without some mimosas to start things off right. They fresh squeeze their orange juice and serve their mimosas in 1/2 carafe yay! Not sure how many we had but we had quite a few. I also had to try a Bloody Mary, being that it's my favorite drink and it wouldn't be an official brunch with out a BM. As always Tazza steps it up with their cocktails, clearly they muddled the tomatoes, pickles and what ever other delicious ingredients that went into this drink. I will take a Bloody Mary pitcher please extra spicy:) Now you're probably wondering about the food? It was a hard decision with all the amazing choices. \u00a0But after seeing that sausage sandwich on FB that morning it was already in my head and I just needed to try it, plus our waitress highly recommended it. I think I made the right choice! Sausage made in house topped with guac, pickled red onions, a friend egg on crispy ciabatta bread. I'm pretty sure everyone at the table wanted a bite but I didn't share I ate the whole dish. Some other favorites at are table were the breakfast burritos, french toast, frittata, and crab cakes benedict. No complaints from anyone, the food was enjoyed by all. You can't go wrong with dinner or brunch at Tazza it's a great addition to the Cameron Village dining scene!"], ["Angela W.", "The food here was really good. We ordered the brioche (amazing!) and had pizzas and the spicy chicken sandwich. Our waiter was really nice. But it took an hour once we ordered to get our food. It was even a long wait to get the bread (something that can soften the wait). For this reason, I wouldn't recommend this place to friends. However, if you can get here at a less busy time (we arrived Sunday at 12:30), it might be good to try."], ["Liza T.", "Tazza is a great place for dinner, drinks or just apps! I haven't tried the brunch yet, but I've only heard great things. My only problem with this place is the prices. They charge a lot of money for not a whole lot of food. The pizzas are really good - but they don't have ranch which stinks for a ranch lover like me! The service is amazing, though, and it's a really cool, modern atmosphere. I would definitely recommend this place for a night out with the girls or just for fun drinks after work!"], ["Rose L.", "Tazza Kitchen moved up on my radar from my favorite dinner spot to now my favorite brunch place as well! I came here a couple weeks ago for a UYE brunch on a Sunday afternoon (thanks Kuanyu C.). There were so many choices on the menu that looks appetizing it was very difficult to decide but I finally settled on the fritatta. Honestly, I don't usually order this dish so I'm not sure what jumped out to me about it but it was probably the smoked mozzarella, lime mayo, roasted corn, pico de gallo and cilantro description. Before my meal arrived our large table enjoyed fresh squeezed mimosa carafes and I had a coffee. Our waitress, Rachel, was so lovely! She was quick to make recommendations, was pleasant even with our large party and kept my coffee cup full. The fritatta was amazing, from presentation to taste, it was one of the most delicious meals I have ever enjoyed (and I don't say that lightly). The cilantro with lime mayo and mozzarella and corn gave it the most delicious flavors imaginable and the side of hash-brows were perfect, I felt the dish was created for my taste buds! I can't wait to return to TK and try some of the other menu options!"], ["Eric S.", "This may be the best pizza in Raleigh. I was skeptical at first. This place had all the red flags that I normally associate with Americanized pizza places that try to do too much. Pizza is simple. And Tazza delivers on that front. I'm not going to lie, I was half expecting some booshie attempt at authentic taste. As if upscale decor and proper lighting could somehow make up for sub par food. I even noticed a couple reviews mention hipsters(?) I had no idea what to expect.Thankfully my fears were way off base. The menu is simplified but the food is anything but. As others have said, the real winner here is the Spicy sausage and black pepper honey pizza. The shit's good in a way that I can't even explain. It's like your initial response is to argue with your tastebuds as you eat it. How does this even work? What's happening to my mouth? Just enjoy it. Don't fight it."], ["Jen D.", "Had dinner at Tazza with my boyfriend and another couple. It's a cool place, albeit a little cramped. The food and drinks were great, but the portion sizes are a little small. I ordered the scallops entree, and my boyfriend had the tacos. For the amount of money that I paid (over $100 for two people), I was disappointed to still be hungry at the end of the meal.The other couple ordered a pizza, and it looked delicious. For next time, I think that's the way to go."], ["Laurie M.", "What a gem of a restaurant! \u00a0Delicious food, great service, reasonable prices, beautiful decor.I've been here a bunch of times since moving back to Raleigh and really like it. \u00a0Now I live across the street from it, and I look forward to many return visits. \u00a0I have enjoyed dinner on the sidewalk with my dog, as well as group dinners and bar drinks inside. \u00a0The crunchy potato and arugula salad is uh-mazing, and the flautas are pretty delicious. \u00a0One thing I didn't like was the kale & chilies salad, which is overly spicy (haha that's probably why I wasn't a fan, because I failed to heed the word 'chilies' in the title). \u00a0Servers are friendly and quick. \u00a0The bar is nice if you can get a spot. \u00a0All-in-all, two thumbs up!"], ["Bryan G.", "Great cocktails, great pizzas, great service!

Well my experience lived up to the hype. It was a beautiful evening so we sat outside on their covered patio. There are also tables on the sidewalk, without any cover for those days when you want to soak up the sunshine. We started with the Brick Oven Cauliflower. Wow! The texture was perfect and I loved the addition of mint. I wouldn't have thought of that combo but will be adding it to my cauliflower in the future. The grana padano cheese and red onion completed the dish. So tasty, and you don't feel guilty for ordering it. My friend and I decided to split the Kale & Chilies salad (we added chicken) and the Spicy Sausage and Black Pepper Honey pizza. The kale was cut into strips making it easy to eat, and the lemon vinaigrette complimented it nicely. Then the pizza - wow. We spoke to the manager and he told us the sausage is made in house, and the pork is sourced from Green Button Farms. Many of the other ingredients are also local (check out their website for details). This is a big selling point for me. I can taste the quality, and while I usually shy away from mystery meat, this sausage is a known entity and absolutely delicious!We also shared a bottle of Frascati. It is similar to Pinot Grigio and went well with our meal. To end it all, we split the Chocolate Budino. OMG. Yum! I will be back to repeat this meal exactly. Service was impeccable. Can't wait to return!"], ["Megan G.", "We LOVE this place! The drinks are so fresh! The food is amazing! The atmosphere is fun! A must try in Cameron Village!"], ["My Girl M.", "Great food and atmosphere. We had time for one last dinner out on our vacation and wanted someplace relaxed and cool, but something that pleased everyone since we were tired. A quick look at the menu online and I knew this was the place. The menu selection makes the most of the wood fired oven. We had the goat cheese appetizer, which was reminded us of warm pimento cheese. Good, but our favorites were the roasted broccoli and meatballs. Have been trying to recreate at home we liked them so much! Pizza with arugula and prosciutto was excellent, steak and potatoes a hit (they allowed a substitution of broccoli instead of potatoes, nice).And a special note about desserts here. Excellent. The chocolate budino was a real treat. First \"new\" chocolate dessert I have had in ages. And the peach cobbler special was fantastic, with a really unique astringent flavored semifreddo ice cream that was a perfect compliment to the cobbler. Clean, great service, and at least the night we were there, the place to meet your match.com date."], ["rachel b.", "My new favorite place in town. Came highly recommended by several friends and did not disappoint. Everything was delicious but the chorizo nachos are not to be missed! Just make sure you call ahead for reservations, it's been packed every time we've been."], ["Susan F.", "Tazza Kitchen has been getting great buzz since it opened at Cameron Village, so my expectations were high and I wasn't disappointed. I met a friend at the bar for drinks and appetizers. Service was spot on and the bar comfortable. I had the goat cheese starter, which is goat cheese and marinara baked in a cast iron pan and served with brick oven bread drizzled in olive oil. So simple, yet so rich and wonderful. I would have licked the pan if I could have. My friend had the margherita pizza, again simple flavors superbly executed. I love the cocktail menu, and went with a Manhattan, my litmus test for a new watering hole. It was perfect, served in a classic, wide mouth champagne glass with a rich brandied cherry. Overall, we're fans. The superbly executed dishes, the chic, comfortable space, reasonably priced menu and ample parking, Tazza Kitchen is the whole package. Oh, and their social media, huge kudos to whoever is running it. Follow Tazza Kitchen on Instagram (tazzakitchen)- it's total food porn."], ["Stephanie G.", "I discovered Tazza while visiting my sister down in NC, and if I lived closer, it would surely become a staple in my life. Their brick oven bread is the greatest bread I've ever had in my life, hands down. The locals know where it's at, this place was absolutely packed at 8:30pm on a stormy weeknight. Not to be missed."], ["Paul H.", "Hands down, the best place to eat at Cameron Village! I went on a Monday night and the place was hopping! I assume this is because most restaurants are not open on Monday nights, giving this newer establishment a great chance to shine. The General Manager, Sam, and the waitress, Rachel were very friendly and insightful of the choice in cocktails and food items that graced the menu. I highly recommend getting the \" Carolina Greyhound\" or the \"Victory;\" both cocktails were made with fresh ingredients in house and were not overpowered by the liquor. \u00a0I love good customer service, and these ladies were on point with filling up my water when emptied, to making sure my order was satisfying!I ordered 2 different types of Wood-Burning oven Pizzas (Spicy Sausage and the Prosciutto and Arugula), along with a side of the Bacon glazed Brussels sprouts, which were out of this world! I saved room for dessert and had the best gelato in my life.....the Salted Caramel. \u00a0Wow! Don't bother to get eat the cake that comes with it....just get a double dose of the sweet and savory gelato. (FYI....I had a friend accompany me, so I did not eat all this by myself...although it was so good enough that I could!) The layout was very rustic Italian, with a contemporary edge, making it seem very inviting. They even have nice space heaters outside, should you decide to dine outdoors! This place blows its previous establishment, Cafe Caturra, out of the water- a much better selection of drinks and food items to make it worth a weekly date night, or gathering among friends for a weekend dinner."], ["Eric M.", "So we got there an hour before close, and I'm sorry guys, I'm sorry for doing that. It's not cool. And I was ready for a horrible experience. The last time I walked in to a restaurant an hour before close, I did have a horrible experience (read my review of Casa San Carlo from just a few weeks ago--9/6/14). These guys rocked it out. Seriously y'all eat here. My waiter was named Geoff and he was mad funny and honestly the best server I've had in months who wasn't a friend of mine already. \u00a0I would have totally made fun of his name, and called him G-off like the Australians say, if he wasn't such a great damn server. Not to keep contrasting the two restaurants, it's neither fair nor useful, but the waiter from Casa San Carlo wrote me an apology for his service. If you're reading this, Pat K.-- 1) it's really creepy that you're lurking my yelp profile like that 2) come eat here and get Geoff as a server. He'll show you what's up, even at 10:30 on a Friday.So I'm on a hunt for the best best fish tacos in Raleigh. The current winner is Rockford, believe it or not. These guys put up a good fight, but I still give the edge to Rockford. What Tazza did do well was experiment. It had tomatillo confit on it. And crunchy quinoa. I used to work with a chef who honestly was one of the greatest cooks who has ever fed me in my life, and one night, he was serving something with quinoa in it, and dismissed it as trendy bullshit. Actually, maybe it wasn't him, but it does sound like something he'd say, he was the type of guy who hated lots of things, but so am I. Anyway, the point is that this quinoa was crunchy. Yes, that sounds weird. Friend thought they were peppercorns, and so did I honestly, until I looked at the menu after the fact. It didn't have much flavor, but it did add to the texture. Quinoa is trendy (or is it pass\u00e9 now? I can't keep up with you kids) but these guys were doing new things with it. Taking chances. This crunchy quinoa chance wasn't particularly good, or bad, but I applaud them for trying it. The fish itself was a bit buried in the mix, and so as a whole, the tacos didn't knock my socks off, but they were good. Good as in I'd probably give them 3rd place city wide so far. Friend got vegetable pizza which has \"squash, zucchini, red pepper, caramelized onion, fresh mozzarella, queso fresco, chili flake\" on it. She added sausage, so I couldn't try, but honestly it looked really good and she didn't stop talking about it the rest of the time she was with me and has since sent me two texts about how good it was. It's not cheap, not at all. But Tazza is on point. If you don't mind shelling out a few dollars for food that combines different cultures and styles of cooking, and food that will make you think as well as make your stomach happy, check it out. They've got a brunch menu I'm really looking forward to trying. And the guacamole-- but I'm sorry it's hard for me to pay 7 dollars for guacamole. I know that's normal at a lot of restaurants prices, and I pay stupid prices for things at other restaurants ($5 bowl of edamame with salt at an asian place recently, I mean come on), but $7 just seems like a lot.Only real negative was the music was a bit loud, and sort of shitty indie bands like Modest Mouse (I actually really really love modest mouse) and the Avett Brothers (I really do not love the avett brothers, not even a little bit), but when Friend mentioned that to Geoff, he turned it down a bit, which just goes to show you how awesome that guy is. Anyway TL;DR: Seriously y'all eat here."], ["Alex N.", "One of the smoothest run newly opened restaurants I've seen in a while. \u00a0These guys were barely open two weeks before we showed up and everything went well. \u00a0After converting the Cafe Caturra space, the makeover looks really successful. \u00a0Not that I was complaining about it before, but the new decor is much more rustic/modern and really jives with the menu. \u00a0It has this cool wine country feel to it.The menu reads pretty well. \u00a0I always do like it when the ingredients are transparent. \u00a0We ordered the spicy fingerlings, cod, garganelli pasta & fennel sausage, and gelato & cake. \u00a0The potatoes were standard fare, but the spicy jalapeno sauce was a nice touch to a typically boring plate of potatoes. \u00a0I don't normally like it when my fish has been broken up, unless it's being served in different preparations, but this cod, lentil, salsa verde, and picked fresnos combo worked just fine. \u00a0A touch on the too well-done side, but it tasted good enough to not care too much. \u00a0I'm a sucker for great pasta, and what this one lacked in a rich gravy was all made up for in the sausage and garganelli. \u00a0 You can taste the fennel, which wouldn't have been possible with an overpowering sauce. \u00a0The garganelli, which I haven't seen used around these parts, is about a cool of a pasta as there is; sauce can really get in there unlike some of those other tube-shaped pastas. \u00a0Lastly, the dessert could have really done without the overly sweet gelato. \u00a0That almond and orange cake could stand on it's own.Some of the dimly lit tables feel cozy, though the restaurant is bustling with so much energy, you might feel a little left out. \u00a0Still, the staff's menu knowledge is great and they are excited to be open. \u00a0The menu is really quite short and unless they put out some specials, I could easily see myself eating through this menu quickly. \u00a04 1/2 stars for this great start. \u00a0I know I nitpicked, but the experience really was great. They were slammed for dinner on a Friday night, which bodes well for their staying power. \u00a0I haven't wanted to come back to a restaurant so much in a while."], ["Gina B.", "Another fan of Tazza is born! While I was sad to Caf\u00e9 Caturra go, like many of us, I waited in hopeful anticipation of what was coming next. Not another pizza place please! Thankfully, Tazza Kitchen answers a much needed prayer for an upscale dining option in Cameron Village. It's a perfect date spot or, in our case, Tuesday dinner after pedicures for the girls. Tazza seems to cater to the hip late 20's to early 40- some crowd with ease.I was impressed with the renovations inside. The kitchen is opened up and the ambience is warm and inviting. Equally, I was thrilled with the number of gluten-free options on the menu. I challenged the Chef with a little ingredient switcheroo and he/she appeased with no issues. My only complaint is the serving was a little small and even with the gluten-free dessert, I was still hungry. Hmm, maybe I need a starter as well next time. The prices were reasonable. $16 for an entr\u00e9e? Can do! Rest assured, we'll definitely be back as this is our new favorite spot and will surely be a hit!"], ["Jessica T.", "I've heard Tazza described as \"hipster\" and I can definitely see that. I love the food here, but their menu is limited which also limits their ability to substitute things.

I usually order lots of appetizers and eat tapas style when dining here, the eggplant dip is my favorite."], ["Ellen J.", "Good food, good service, pleasant atmosphere. \u00a0We had a salad and shared the shrimp and crispy polenta. Very nice. We'll be back to try the pizza."], ["Anthony G.", "In the once quaint Cameron Village there is a jewel called Tazza. Sometimes I call it Gaza because of the war for parking and the crowds of mean yankees. Unfortunately and you know what I'm going to say, it is crowded on weekends because of those ugly, monstrous apartments and it's crowded most weekdays because of the monstrous apartments where all of the people who read that Raleigh was once one of the most wonderful places to live, ran here for the gold rush and moved to the ugly apartments. Tazza has dining al fresco or dining adentro. The food is superb! We got 3 apps and I don't recall the names but they were all good. I got a personal pizza and added caramelized onions and shrooms. It was great! Our stoned waiter who looked like a jewelry maker from Roswell said the wood burning oven made everything taste better and that was SO the case. The rigatoni was really well done and I ordered a Caesar but didn't realize that it was Kale, which is not my favorite thing to eat. I tasted someone's meat ball (NO, that's not whatI meant) and it was intense. This place is full of flavor and has the ambience of a cool place in LA. The waitstaff is very cool and swift (we always get the stoner and he's very sweet) So come to T and eat. Its great to gather here with friends and even a date with a cute by if you're out of the closet. No reservations (which sucks)"], ["Michael H.", "As many others have noted, Tazza replaces Cafe Caturra. I was never that crazy about the latter, and it's great to see Tazza's more culinarily adventurous menu.

Amazing wood fired pizza. Easily, hands down, no contest, down goes Fraiser, best in town. Don't even bother with next years survey. They win. Period. Rest of dinner was a whirlwind, did I mention the margaritas? But everything that came out of the kitchen was great.

Nice work."], ["Payton A.", "I loved Tazza at first sight. It was raining and already dark out by the time my boyfriend and I made it to the restaurant, and the sexy atmosphere and gorgeous bar were exactly what we wanted on such a night. We were seated at a hightop near that beautiful bar and agonized over what we wanted to drink, because all the cocktails sounded phenomenal. Our server was attentive but unobtrusive, and very good at his job. The more I drank the more I was amused by how good he knew he was. About midway through our meal, all the iPhones in the restaurant alerted us to a flashflood warning, which was just one more excuse to stay and drink!One of the cocktails smelled exactly like freshly mowed grass and was about the same color. I love savory cocktails, and was a huge fan of this one. I also had a glass of wine and a fruitier cocktail (I know, I know -- not the best idea) and enjoyed both but they weren't as memorable as as the grassy drink. The boyfriend had one of the best Manhattans I've ever had, another cocktail, and a beer. We did an excellent job of picking our meal, if I do say so myself. We started out with the cauliflower appetizer. It is non-negotiable: you must order the brick oven cauliflower, it's so good. The crunchy potato and arugula salad was also phenomenal; the warmed mozzarella was delightfully smoky against the pepper of the arugula and the surprisingly light maple vinagrette. We may not ever get the chance to try another kind of pizza because of how fiercly we felt about the sausage and black pepper honey pizza.

I need more of both of those dishes in my life. I live going with a friend and splitting the pizza and getting the salad each. Beer list is pretty decent with several area brews. The wine list is extensive too. The outside patio is like sitting in a greenhouse during summer months when the curtains are down, so wait for a table inside if they're not rolled up. Also, my friend has requested balsamic vinegar three times now and they oddly don't have what I'd consider a pretty basic ingredient for a restaurant of this style.

It was a huge bowl of greasy mess with very little sauce. I love Italian food but I could NOT eat this dish. When I called it to the waitress attention, I was told that thats the way lasagna is and they refused to take it off my bill. I took two bites.

The logo above the door is a star, and that doesn't effing explain anything. Normally I'm the type that will immediately dismiss a restaurant/bar for not having enough clarity in their branding, but because I am self-tasked with providing you ALL the necessary information for you to decide whether or not this place is WORTH A VISIT, I went there. \u00a0-Have you enjoyed going to restaurants in the past?You bet your ass you have. In fact if you're being honest with yourself, visiting restaurants is right up there with watching movies and talking to friends as a premier activity in your life. Well The Point checks all of your restaurant boxes. Food? Yep. Beverages? Yep. Service? Yep. Comfortable AC settings? Yep. What more do you want?....VISIT. The fact that it is a restaurant and you like those should be enough. But let's dive deeper.-Are you the kind of person that likes a diversified menu?Sometimes you're not sure what you're in the mood for. Sometimes you want pizza and your darling girlfriend wants a damn Sesame Crusted Tuna Caesar Salad. No need to turn this gaping difference in specificity into an argument about emotional neediness, just take her to The Point....VISIT. They've got a strong gourmet presentation on various classics like burgers and tacos, but they also throw in some fancy salads and hoity-toity apps. There's definitely something on that menu for you.-Do you like places that turn into raging boozehalls after 10pm?This place DOES THAT! And if you're the type of person that reads this blog and likes that atmosphere, then I'll bet YOU'VE ALREADY VISITED. And you know the main pitfall of the post 10pm crowd.-Are you offended by raging frat-stars?This is one of the heavyweight frat bars in all of Raleigh. The Thursday night crowd is famously frat-tastic with swoops for days. Natural Light is actually a featured beer at The Point. If you don't know what that means, then this probably isn't the place for you....NOT WORTH IT. Stick to the lunch and dinner times.-Are you into cultural diversity?This is really just a more heavy-handed variation on the question above. Let me put it this way: I think I may have seen one black guy there one time for about 10 seconds....NOT WORTH IT if you're not a WASP, but you should definitely VISIT if you're a non-WASP trying to make a statement.-Is a black guy eating a burger at a restaurant that one blogger call \"fratty\" really a ridiculous idea of a stand, and how could that possibly be a helpful piece of information in deciding whether or not a place is worth visiting?Hey, why is this getting so heavy? Maybe you should just VISIT so you can be part of the convo.-Do you like $2 Bud Light drafts after work on Friday.That's better. Let's keep the main thing the main thing and keep the mood light. You love affordable domestic beer, so YOU'RE VISITING.

Service is very slow, the waiter didnt know the dishes, the food is average at best. I ordered the taco plate and it is obviously a very high-margin dish. What I mean is that the chicken was dry and tasted like it was already processed and pre-cooked, the cook just slaps it on the grill for a few seconds. The guacamole definitely came off a pouch or a can. The salsa was the watery kind you get in a bucket at the supermarket, the tacos shells were left out of the Costco bag for a few hours and were getting soggy.

The entrees we had were fine, though the portion sizes were a little extreme. Thankfully, taking half my meal home was convenient that night - but that isn't always the case and I hate feeling like I'm wasting food. So you might want to think about ordering appetizers or side salads and then splitting something with your date.The service was friendly but a little slow. There may have been some confusion over whose table we were, because it took quite some time for anyone to come by for drink orders. And we probably could have had a last round of beers while we were waiting to pay. We were asked if we needed anything at least four times by people other than our server.

Once everyone sat down, we had to constantly track down people to re-fill waters, remind them who ordered which food and drinks. The worst and most important part of this experience was the end- the waitress asked how to charge the bill and we asked if we could have it individualized/split (since they have tapas and people typically share). She tells us okay no problem but says it will be a little bit. We allow 40 min before only one of us (me) goes to ask politely if they are having difficulty with remembering everyone's orders and that we could gladly tell her which orders we had, then asked about how much longer it is going to take -while asking the waitress who responded with \"I didn't forget just taking a long time with the system splitting checks\"- a guy who looks like a manager and acts like one interrupts and says \"with your big group it is taking longer because it is so complicated to have to split checks.\" I ignore his rude / attacking behavior and continue to say \"okay, well it's just that some of my group needs to leave now..\" he cuts me off again and says \"yeah people to see, things to do, places to be.\" I politely smile back and say \"yes but also some of them need to get some rest to wake up early in the morning\"- again he interrupts and says \"yeah well I need to be up early and here for brunch too.\"At that point I am completely in shock that neither of them have apologized to the table for how long it is has taken them (over 40 minutes now) and most of all for how rude that man was to me. One other girl went up to ask a few minutes later if she could just pay for her portion- they gave her the same story with the system taking long and said they were almost done. She also told them that any other restaurant would have already come by the table and would have apologized for how long it was taking. Finally the situation got resolved only by one of the girls giving her credit card to pay for the whole group of about 13. There was still no apology before we left.

The potatoes and biscuits that came out before the meal were an unexpected addition and delish!The food was excellent but the service was just mediocre (hence the 4 stars instead of 5). The waitress forgot my husbands bloody mary and we had to remind her to bring it. I think it came sometime during the meal. Maybe it was just a busy day but she was super spacey and rarely ever came by. In addition, two people (myself and my husbands father) made requests to alter the meal slightly. My husbands father just got into a biking accident and had super crazy sore teeth. He asked the waitress to leave off the tortilla chips (cause he couldnt eat them) on the huevos rancheros and she said they were kinda on the side and thus, not a big deal. I asked if they could leave off the sour cream on my huevos rancheros and she told me that I could scrape it off. No joke. So, I scraped it off and my father in law just ate around the chips. They were two stupid simple requests and I guess it was just kinda weird that we were told to basically eat around it.

The interior is everything I want and need from a delicious, no frills, locally charged restaurant.

Spinach Tart - in the form of thin crust pizza, shallot, garlic with goat cheese and parmesan; SOMEONE took a giant bite before realized we had to take picture4.

Short Rib Tostadas - added chimichurri, and mango salsa on the side; again, only THREE? You can't possibly share evenly!6. Grilled Asparagus - with fried egg on top, over easy, once the yolk broke, blended with miso butter, became awesome sauce; with lesson learned previously, we divided evenly and to each's own7.

I really like the feel of the place, but not sure if I would have been happy sitting at one of the table against the back wall, as they do not have the same open feel as the front part of the restaurant. Our waiter came and was very nice, and explained some specials that were very French, and my husband and I just weren't following (we are not very versed in French food...at all). We both ordered a cocktail, and I got a salad as an app, and Jeff ordered the filet with bearnaise sauce and fries, and I got the same, but I got the hanger steak. Our cocktails came out fast, and were delish. I got a champagne cocktail that had gin and apricot syrup and champagne - so yummy! Jeff got a Rye Collins, which involved whiskey and sour, and he loved it (smelled so strong to me). My salad also came out fast - endive, poached egg, bacon, croutons, cider mustard dressing. If this came in a large portion, I could have eaten this for my meal. It was so wonderful. I don't love bacon (gasp), but this was GOOD bacon. It was more like pork belly I guess. Our steaks also came out relatively fast, and we both ordered a glass of red to go with dinner. I ordered the Bordeaux, and although it was $10 a glass, it was worth it. It was really good. I was disappointed with the presentation of both of our meals. The steaks were drenched with sauce, and bearnaise is really rich. Also, my steak (hanger) was sliced for me, but not in nice even slices...it looked butchered. And then the fries....although they were good, there was so many of them and they were just thrown on the plate with no care whatsoever. It just didn't feel like the chef cared about this plate of food at all. The flavor was good, but again, way too much sauce overpowering the steak. Jeff agreed that the sauce was too much, but he also enjoyed the flavor of his filet. We had a lovely evening here, and did enjoy our meals and drinks.

I called Oro to inquire and they've heard of this issue in the past with debit cards, but that it's the bank's fault (Wells Fargo, in my case) not the restaurant's. The additional charge was gone in 24 hours, but it was still not something I'd love to happen again."], ["Anthony G.", "If Sweden had a K&W Cafeteria it would be ORO, Oro for gold and the Mac & Cheese is golden! It was one of the best I've ever had. The portion was tiny (Unlike the one at Taste and Humble Pie) but it was great. The Spring Rolls were good, as was the Flat Bread with cheese and so forth. Yes, we know the portions here were Tapa size as the waitress explained but Tapas in Spain are usually quite filling at ORO they were not. Well, they are if you order 3 or 4 \u00a0and share. Thank god I wasn't hungry otherwise I would've swiped someone's meat ball. The place got crowded fast and the clientele does not look the same as they did when ORO first opened, it was like an airport. I like that you can order 2 oz of wine. The sweets were very good, Creme Bru-haha and a bananarama pudding very tasty. ORO isn't one of those places I'm dying to return to, it was good but with so many choices you can experience this place once and that is enough."], ["Justin N.", "We had attended an event at ORO once previously so we decided to try it out for dinner last weekend, before going to see the NC Symphony. We live almost an hour away so we budgeted an hour and a half to eat and walk to Memorial Auditorium. We were seated upstairs and it was almost ten minutes before a server spoke to us. We ordered drinks and that took 10 minutes to deliver to the table. We wanted to ask questions about the menu but it was 30 minutes from the time we sat down until the server came to take our order. In the end, we sat there for an hour and a half. In that time, we had a small glass of wine each and we only shared a couple of appetizers. We never got the chance to have entrees or even second drinks. Finally, we had to leave but out server was unavailable to check us out. We walked downstairs and asked for our check. We explained why we were leaving. They still charged us for the wine and appetizers. We didn't ask for anything. We paid and left. This was the worst dining experience we have had in some time. We went to the symphony hungry and later had to find late night food to eat because we never had dinner. I don't see us returning."], ["Ashley W.", "My family stumbled in for dinner on Friday quite unexpectedly, and it was amazing! We weren't aware this was a \"Tapas\" place from the street--I actually thought this was an Asian/sushi place because of the name. Oro translates to \"What?\" in Japanese--I only know this due to my teen obsession with the Rurouni Kenshin manga...Anyways, back to the food! We split 8 orders of tapas between 5 people:- Truffle Mac & Cheese (2) -- Absolutely DIVINE--could not get enough! Medium-sized casserole dishes were filled to the brim with this heavenly, cheesy manna- Fish Tacos (2 plates with 4 tacos) -- Large chunks of crispy grouper, mango salsa, and thinly sliced cucumbers. Paired with the wasabi guacamole, this was the BEST tapa dish for flavor.- Fried Chicken & Green Tomatoes (1) -- best green tomatoes I've ever had! I would recommend order one plate per 2 people. Chicken had a sweet, honey-flavored brine.- Smoky Ribs (2 plates) -- perfectly done and delightfully tenderOur eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs (hence, my mom placing our entire order all at once). I would recommend PACING yourself through your meal... The dishes WILL come out fast! You definitely get a LOT of food for your money. NO kids--this place is ritzy... Also, I recommend wearing something dressy because it is more of a *lounge* than a restaurant. The people around us were either on dates or out for after-work drinks/desserts. I'll just say there were a lot of yuppies... My only negative was that when we got to the door, we were told there was a 30 minute wait since we had no reservation. Meanwhile, there was a handful of empty tables around the room. After my mom pleasantly chatted with one of the hostesses for 5 minutes, she cleared a table for us. Being nice can get you places. Definitely will be back to try the rest of the menu!"], ["Laurie V.", "I really like the bartender, Corrie. \u00a0He is a sweetie-pie. \u00a0The food is fair. \u00a0Not excellent. \u00a0Fair. \u00a0That's the best word I can conjure. I had the foie-gras bone marrow dish. \u00a0It kinda tasted like chicken. (I hate when people tell you things \"taste like chicken\", but it really did. Nothing like the foie gras I've had before. \u00a0And nothing like the bone marrow I've had before.) \u00a0I had higher expectations. I also tried the pork belly. \u00a0Now THIS was pretty good. \u00a0Not the best that has ever grazed my palate, but pretty darn good. The restaurant was drafty on a chilly day. \u00a0Every time the door opened I froze. \u00a0For some reason I got an email that my reservation had been cancelled, so I had to call the restaurant to receive my Open Table points. (These points are a hot commodity!) \u00a0The hostess didn't seem to believe me that I was actually there and challenged my request. \u00a0Not very nice of her! \u00a0Finally she promised me they credited my visit. \u00a0But she still never did. Sidenote: Finally Open Table did credit me. Sooooo, aside from the really friendly service at the bar, I'm not sure this would be at the top of my list to revisit."], ["Aaron A.", "POISONED !!!If you are gluten free DO NOT EAT HERE. My wife has celiacs and was poisoned by her meal here. While the dishes may be labeled \"Gluten Free\" DO NOT TRUST THE KITCHEN. Apparently they are not safe & careful about contamination.A pity because the food was good. But paying $80+ for the privilege of vomiting is not something I can recommend.Sorry ORO - you failed.EDIT: After sending the restaurant a note about the problem they offered a full refund and said they would review the GF procedure with their cooks.I would still avoid the potato pancakes which apparently are deep fried in a common cooker."], ["Tanya D.", "Great food, fair prices. 4 instead of 5 stars just because of minor things. Our entrees were delivered about 5 mins apart. The table for two was wide, and we felt far apart (and loud). Food...though...oh wow! I had the gnocchi with duck. Yum! He had the bison and potato, super Yum. Less than $50 for fine eats and a drink apiece. I want to try more. :-)"], ["Annie G.", "Absolutely loved my first visit to ORO! It was First Friday so my friend and I were worried that since we didn't have a reservation that we wouldn't get seated. But we were offered 2 choices, the bar or the \"chef's table\" as we called it. We opted for the chef's table and it was the best choice we ever made! It was so exciting and interesting watching the chef's cook all the food. We were trying to guess what they were making and would look over the menu to try and figure it out. It was a blast! You could also see all the orders coming up so we were like, \"Oh, what's that? I want to order that!!\" Sadly the host said that these particular seats (4) were not very popular. Good for me I guess, cause I would ONLY sit there from now on.We ordered the truffle mac n cheese since our waiter said it was delish and really popular. It was soooo good! I was amazed to see how fast it was cooked too! My mac \u00a0n cheese takes a good hour! Next we had the spring rolls were that were also good and really fresh. I want to try everything on the menu and was sad that I was already full. The tacos were very popular and looked fantastic. They used naan bread for the shells. For dessert we got the s'mores. YUM!!!! You get marshmallows, berries, chocolate syrup and crushed graham crackers with a little fuel cube that makes a fire for you to roast the marshmallows. It was so fun! After we ate, the executive chef came over to us and chatted for a bit. He was super nice and use to live near me in CA! He had an awesome gold bracelet too :)I can't wait to bring my husband and my other foodie friends too!!"], ["Dirk W.", "I tried this downtown Raleigh place after reading a friends 5-star review on Yelp during a recent trip. \u00a0I wasn't disappointed. \u00a0They have an awesome selection of wines by the glass and an extensive menu. \u00a0I started with the beet salad which is a large portion and includes plenty of greens. \u00a0For an entree, I had the Sea Bass on a bed of braised ribs. \u00a0 After reading a few reviews, I had to order the corn....all I can say, you cannot leave this place without trying it. \u00a0Possible the best item on the menu."], ["Daniel K.", "This restaurant is a perfect reason why I should make an effort to sample downtown Raleigh's food scene more frequently. \u00a0My wife and I were invited to join our son, our future daughter-in-law and about 20 of their friends for a birthday celebration here on a Monday night. The restaurant was a terrific venue. \u00a0The space was modern, quite roomy and very pleasing to the eye. The group spent about 45 minutes having cocktails at the bar. I was impressed with the selection of top shelf spirits and wines. They had several single malt scotches that one usually does not find at a restaurant bar and a very nice choice of wines by the glass. \u00a0Eventually we were seated in an upstairs room that was open and airy. Our group opted to allow the chef to prepare a tasting of the restaurant's whole menu rather than place individual orders. That was definitely a good move as it gave us a chance to experience all the different dishes this very talented chef creates each day. Each selection was delicious and the quantity delivered to our group was plentiful. My two favorites were the calamari, which was cooked perfectly and beautifully seasoned and is among the best I have ever had, and the mac and cheese, which was absolutely great. \u00a0The servers were attentive and very friendly. The food came at just the right pace for a big group and our glasses were always filled. It was a terrific dining experience in a very comfortable restaurant. I loved the food. I will definitely be back."], ["Kristy A.", "This place was really a pleasant surprise. \u00a0I went here with a large group - 12 people - and had a great time. \u00a0Our server was great, the food was great, the place had ambiance and was comfortable all at the same time. \u00a0Would have been 5 stars except for one thing - the NO SEPARATE CHECKS policy - ugh! \u00a0 I tried a whole bunch of dishes since I was with a big group. \u00a0 We started with the beet salad - diced beets with a little bit of goat cheese and some vinaigrette. \u00a0 Then on to the fried chicken and tomatoes. \u00a0 This was four decent sized pieces of boneless fried chicken and two fried green tomatoes, all drizzled with a buttermilk dressing. \u00a0 Really good. \u00a0 Then the truffle mac and cheese. \u00a0 Good, but not special. \u00a0Definitely worth eating, but I would probably try something more unique on the next visit. \u00a0The grilled corn came next - 8 small pieces of corn on skewers with a little mayo based dressing. \u00a0Tasty and flavorful. \u00a0We finished the savory portion with the crispy shrimp. \u00a0Three large shrimp with a cabbage slaw. \u00a0This mess of food was split between me and one other person and it was more than enough. \u00a0We were stuffed, but that didn't stop us from tasting a few of the leftovers. \u00a0 The pork belly was amazing. \u00a04 or 5 chunks of succulent tender meat. \u00a0 The jerk chicken was good - not really my thing. \u00a0 The gnocchi and duck breast was good, though oddly proportioned. \u00a0Lots of gnocchi, which was soft and light. \u00a0Three little pieces of duck breast. \u00a0What else...the octopus was eh. \u00a0And I didn't try it, but my friend from Spain wasn't impressed with the paella. \u00a0 Overall, though, lots of great dishes. \u00a0 We finished with the smores dessert which was pretty awesome and the bread pudding, which I wish I had skipped. \u00a0 The smores was a pile of marshmallow, a pile of fruit, a pile of graham cracker crumb, and a ramekin of chocolate sauce - with a flaming sugar cube in the middle. \u00a0Inventive and tasty and fun. \u00a0 \u00a0I will say though that the no separate checks policy was super annoying. \u00a0I almost subtracted two stars instead of one. \u00a0They told us in advance and all, but still... \u00a0 We spent $500 there...and a good half hour trying to divvy up the bill. \u00a0 They will take multiple credit cards, but you have to do the math yourself. \u00a0No easy feat with 12 people. \u00a0You are probably thinking \"why didn't you just split it 12 ways and be done?\" \u00a0 That definitely would have been simplest, but not everyone knew each other and some folks definitely out-ordered others. \u00a0The split checks ranged from $25 to $55."], ["Karen A.", "Oro never disappoints! 8 of us had drinks and dinner there last night. The food was DELICIOUS, and the service was wonderful. I can't wait to go back!"], ["Lori R.", "Love the ambiance of this new restaurant. \u00a05-stars for the cool automatic wine tower! \u00a05-stars for the nifty \"fireplace\" on the wall upstairs. \u00a05-stars for the mostly friendly staff and the wonderful service, and for the comfy chairs. \u00a0 \u00a0As for the food, I would mostly order differently next time. \u00a0Favorite, by far, was the caesar salad. \u00a0I would not only get it again, but would crave it and want to go there for it, which is the ultimate compliment I can give a restaurant. \u00a0Heather B posted a pic of it that shows the anchovies, freshly shaved parm and the shrimp croutons, which really MAKE this salad.  \u00a0 We also shared the \"crispy shrimp\". \u00a0Again, look at Heather's pic for reference. \u00a0I wish I had read prior reviews, as I would agree with them. \u00a0There is nothing \"crispy\" about this shrimp. \u00a0There are three of them with a mushy batter. \u00a0The slaw was good and it was crispy, but the description of this item should really be changed to change expectations. \u00a0 \u00a0 The other item the two of us chose to share was the meatball \"flatbread\". \u00a0This is a menu item for those that prefer little to no spice in their food, but that kind of person might be unlikely to order it since the description mentions \"red chili flakes\". \u00a0If there were any they were totally invisible and completely tasteless, as were the small meatballs, the swipe of something that was supposed to be a tomato sauce, and the crust that was not thin and flat, but oblong, slightly thick and again, tasteless. \u00a0Thank goodness for the basil. \u00a0I would so not order that again. \u00a0 Others in our party did the \"smoky ribs\", and the filet. \u00a0I tasted a rib and it was good, nice and tender. Did not detect a smoky flavor. \u00a0It was a generous portion. \u00a0 \u00a0 Drinks: \u00a0Please refer to Heather B's review for a description of the \"Enomatic system\". \u00a0It did indeed look very cool, and I would have loved to try something from it, but I will have to win the lottery first (am always hopeful!). \u00a0That being said, there are other options. \u00a0 I was very happy with the $8 glass of chardonnay that I ordered off the regular wine list. \u00a0Husband enjoyed his Sweet Josie beer. \u00a0Sometime I want to go back and try the cocktail sampler... three 2 oz. tastes of different cocktails for $15. \u00a0 \u00a0Speaking of drinks...a dislike for me was that they serve water without ice. \u00a0Might be a hip, popular thing to do, but it's not refreshing to me. \u00a0 Dessert: \u00a0three of us ordered it. \u00a0I HAD to try the \"coffee and donuts\". \u00a0Am not a big dessert gal, but am a sucker for donuts. \u00a0These were donut holes served with \"orange sugar\" (couldn't detect the orange), with \"mocha and sweet cream dipping sauce\". I can't tell you how good this sounded to me, and how good I think it could be. \u00a0The donut holes would have been much better with a lighter texture. \u00a0The insides were an interesting texture, almost creamy, but not necessarily in a pleasant way. \u00a0They would have been better lighter, imho. \u00a0Would have loved to taste some orange on the sugar that was sprinkled on them. \u00a0The mocha \"sauce\" was almost a pudding, very very bitter with a lot of cream on top. \u00a0Think it would have been a lot better sweetened up a bit. \u00a0With a little tweaking, this dessert could be over-the-top. \u00a0As it is now, I would not order it again. \u00a0 \u00a0Husband ordered the strawberry tiramisu. \u00a0He liked it, but was expecting something more tiramisu-like, based on that name being in the description. \u00a0He thought it was more like a strawberry shortcake. \u00a0Based on the pics I see here, and the one I took, you can see that they've changed the vessel it is served in. \u00a0 \u00a0Sometimes it is about expectations, and menu descriptions should be just that, accurate descriptions of what you get. \u00a0I'm thinking some tweaking might be in order here. \u00a0 \u00a0Will also add that one thing that really bothered me about this place was my Stepmom asked to sit at a table by the window when we walked in. \u00a0She (we) were told it was \"reserved\". \u00a0Oh okay, we'll sit elsewhere. \u00a0Needless to say no one ever showed up for that \"reserved\" table while we were there.
