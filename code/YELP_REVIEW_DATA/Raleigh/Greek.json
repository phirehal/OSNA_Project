{"Neomonde Bakery & Deli": [["April H.", "I've eaten here many times, and often stop in after classes to get some of their baklava ends (pretty darn cheap at $6 a pound). Solidly delicious food, and great pastries/baklava. I get the sampler platter and have yet to get something I wouldn't get again, though I switch it up because there's always more delicious options! The attached store is also great for any and all spices with things like whole nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon sticks that can be quite pricy elsewhere very reasonably priced."], ["Bee T.", "Neomonde has been one of my most favorite places in Raleigh and I'm a frequent customer but I'm not too sure about recent \u00a0experiences. I've been a loyal customer since 2002. I purchase some grocery items and food from their Deli department. I sometimes take food from this place to my sister in DC. But recently, my assumption is after their most recent remodeling, their quality of food and service have been compromised. Tonight, I've ordered one of my olde timer usual's which is a half beef/lamb shawarma sandwich which it comes in half pocket pita. When I got it I've noticed that it is a lot emptier than usual, what I'm used to get is a half pita full of meet and variety of pickles, see the picture. I told the girl at the register and she said this is how it's been always. The manager checked on us and said oh yes we changed how we cut the pickles, but that was not what I was saying they had changed what/ how much goes on those sandwiches which is sad. She offered to get me more pickles but I didn't want her to go through the trouble. They also used to have 'the best' tabbouli but most recently they have changed it to quinoa and most importantly less parsley. So it's more quinoa salad than tabbouli, you see less green and more white... I wish they had kept the original one and added the quinoa one as a second salad option but hey ....  My friend at work told me: don't you love and go often to that Neomonde place, they have a $25 for $50 coupon online, why don't you get it? Of course I got it and it is the most inconvenient coupon in my life. So the $50 come in five $10 coupons. You can only use it on deli items, if you happen to get a drink, like a bottle of water, from the frig next to the register you have to pay that separately as that's something they don't make!!!!! You can only use one per order regardless of how many entrees you order. If your food end up being $7.47, you can't use coupon because you won't get the rest of the credit back or if your order is $16.38. You have to pay $6.38 with a card or cash... Anyhow not worth the effort at all.. I'm not sure whether the management has changed or they're consulting with someone as their new rules and menu and food preparations have been totally changed and it's not that appealing any more. Even the new decoration in the restaurant area with the glass ceiling looks very old fashion and outdated. This palace has been always on the expensive side for a cafe but the quality of food and service were differentiating factors but unfortunately both a declining."], ["Emily R.", "The past few times I've visited I've ordered the sampler platter and have been very happy with it. Today I had the baba ganoush with fresh-baked whole wheat pita, mujadara (lentils, rice, carmelized onions), potato salad (Middle Eastern style with cumin, green onions, bell pepper, lemon and mint?), and a falafel. The potato salad was so good I had to immediately tweet about it, and the falafel was awesome - not too dry. I washed everything down with a Dr. Brown's diet cherry soda.

I'd been warned that it was a little off the grid, but the reality was that it was tucked behind train tracks on a dead end street. However! I didn't die (always exciting) and instead had a lovely eating experience. Neomonde's is a deli/restaurant hybrid: you walk up to a counter to order where virtually everything is on display. After you pay, you take a seat and they bring the food to you. The seating area is vaguely cafeteria-esque. That being said, it's very well done--the furniture is appealing and the ambiance is warm and friendly.As a vegetarian, I was ecstatic about the multitude of salad options--it actually took me a good 10 minutes of standing at the counter to actually figure out what to order. I got a lunch special, which was a half-pita of falafel and two salads. From that, I chose a pumpkin chickpea salad and a kale pomegranate salad. It also came with a baklava, but my date snagged that. ;)For the price, it was quite good! The falafel wasn't particularly distinctive, but the pita was stuffed with a variety of different greens and herbs that were flavorful and crunchy. The salads were delicious--I'd never before considered a world where chickpeas and pumpkins meet, but it turns out it's a world worth living in. I'll definitely be back!"], ["Andres B.", "This place is fantastic, regardless of what you get. But seriously, get the hummus - it rules. Any of the shawarmas are also delicious.

Had their regular hummus and their jalape\u00f1o cilantro one (AMAZING!) tried the veggie lasagna - not a favorite. Kind of tasteless compared to their other items.

I stumbled over to Shish Kabob, which was right outside the hotel, in the lovely City Plaza.The place was small and casual, basically a take-out spot with a few tables outside. It was empty when I went in at three in the afternoon, except for a guy manning the register and grill. He was very nice and helpful. I ordered a Phoenician Platter and a Diet Coke, and it was a decent solution to my problems.The platter came with two kabob skewers and three sides of my choosing, which didn't seem like an inordinate amount of food until I held the container in my hands. It was a large lunch--I got it with chicken and beef kabobs, with sides of rice, tabouli, and hummus with pita. The chicken was tasty, if on the dry side, marinated in a garlic sauce. The beef was also nice and flavorful, with a little bit of toughness. I really liked the fluffy rice and the fresh tabouli, and the hummus and pita were satisfying. I sat alone on a planter in the City Plaza and ate with the top of the styrofoam container flapping back and forth in the breeze--a moment of calm in a busy week. I'd recommend Shish Kabob if you need a quick meal in the area. The kabobs aren't the best you'll ever have, but they should do the trick if you're hungry."], ["Joann F.", "Love this place.

It was light, which was perfect because we were full. \u00a0The icing was really really good. \u00a0The ambiance of the restaurant is quite lovely with wood plank ceilings, warm decor, and traditional blue/white Greek knick-knacks and art on the walls. \u00a0I also liked the hanging lantern lighting. \u00a0We did not go upstairs to the rooftop deck, but from the outside it looks like it will be a nice space. \u00a0Our server was no stranger to the service industry. \u00a0He had worked as a server somewhere in the mountains and recently moved to Raleigh right in time for Taverna Agora to open. \u00a0In fact, ALL of the staff were friendly and attentive. \u00a0Our beverages were constantly refilled. \u00a0Our food came in a very timely manner. \u00a0And we were greeted with warm and friendly smiles. \u00a0The other nice part: not only is my day job across the street practically, but I also live about a block away. \u00a0I will be coming back for sure. \u00a0Welcome Taverna Agora- I think you'll love your new downtown location and we (residents and businesses) are happy to have you join us here! \u00a0Opa!"], ["Viktoriya M.", "I was so excited about the rooftop and Mediterranean food.

As for the authentic food, I would go somewhere else."], ["Robb E.", "Absolutely the best meal I have had all year. We started with pita bread and spicy Feta cheese dip and fried calamari. Both were absolutely delicious. I had the lamb shank which just melts in your mouth my wife and daughter had scallops in orzo pasta. It was superb. Our server was excellent as well."], ["Holly P.", "What a treat! I met a friend and her parents last night and I can honestly say we were all quite impressed. \u00a0The ambiance was quite darling. Our Server, Don, was incredibly jovial and had a perfect wine recommendation. I have never been much of a Pinot Noir drinker, but he made a believer out of me with the Meiomi! The infused olive oil and fresh bread with the wine had us swooning long before the meals arrived. Everything was cooked to perfection and in generous portions. The sweet description of \"Agora\" most definitely applies - we gathered, we drank, we ate and truly enjoyed. I can honestly say it was one of the best meals I have had in a very long time and I look forward to bringing my husband in the very near future. \u00a0Yassou!"], ["Andrew K.", "I'm definitely in the minority here, but I really didn't enjoy Taverna Agora. Let me set the stage for you: It's a gloomy Wednesday. My wife and I are tired, sick of work, and the daily grind. So, struck by some inspiration, I wait until wifey is predisposed and call Taverna Agora to find out if they are vegetarian friendly. They affirmed six ways to Sunday that they are. Cool. So, I tell my picky vegetarian wife we're going to take a walk to lift our spirits, and I surprise her by entering Taverna Agora without any warning. That made her happy, at least she wouldn't have to cook that night. So, that's where we were at. Kind of bummed out, and a good meal could have been the difference between a dsythmyic night and a happy night. Usually I don't write a review about a place unless I've been there multiple times, but I won't be returning to Taverna Agora, so I have to base this off of one dining experience. In my mind I'm comparing this place to Kipos in Chapel Hill, which I believe to be far superior. Anyway, we started with the hummus, while my wife was searching the menu for all of the vegetarian options that I was assured of over the telephone. Her options amounted to just side dishes. The hummus was okay. But no better than okay. At least it was cheap. And that right there is damning with faint praise. I ordered the Athenian Chicken. And maybe it was just an off day, but it was really bland. There wasn't much spinach on it, and there wasn't much cheese either. So, my $17 dollar entree was pretty much a bust. My wife got a variety of side plates with the goal of getting vegetables. It seems like Taverna Agora's vegetable selection is only carrots and cucumbers. Absolute weak sauce. So, neither of us enjoyed our entrees. Now, let's make the situation worse. Our server was preoccupied with a table of 20..... why on earth didn't they assign us a different server? What it resulted in was food that was brought out a little bit less than warm, and having to wait 20 minutes for the giant table to all split up their checks before we could pay up and leave. I haven't dined and dashed since that one time in the Doylestown Perkins (sorry!) as a teenager, but man was I tempted to that night at Taverna Agora. Anyway, I would (and maybe will) give this place another chance, but there's no way my picky vegetarian wife would go back. The ambiance is nothing special. It looks like a diner, again, I liked the decorations in Kipos much better. One last pet peeve: they do the old marketing trick of pricing things at .95 cents. Like the Chicken was $16.95, the steak was $24.95, do they honestly think people won't understand that they're paying $17, and $25 respectively for those dishes? Sorry, I just think that's a kind of classless move that borderline insults the customer's intelligence. Maybe it's a fun place to drink. Maybe the other meat dishes are good. But I can say that the ambiance was a snore, the chicken was dry and bland, and they are not vegetarian friendly. What was my hail mary attempt at salvaging a bummed out evening turned out to actually make it worse."], ["Casey K.", "One of the first meals I had in Raleigh upon moving to the city. My mom and I just got drinks and appetizers for dinner and it was truly more than enough food. My favorite of the appetizers was the fried zucchini, big portion with large zucchini slices and a delicious sauce. We also got the dip platter which was really good and you could definitely share with at least 4 people as an appetizer. We also got the calamari, which was good and the saut\u00e9ed shrimp, which I really wasn't impressed by at all. I got a blueberry lemonade cocktail, which was also good.

I also enjoyed the Tzatziki and the greek coffee. the feta and spinach pie was decent too.However...The brunch \u00a0menu is a rather poor attempt to \"greekify\" american brunch favorites. Dry pancakes were served with tons of sugar and cinnamon, and some walnuts if I remember right. Spanakopita benedikt: take the feta and spinach pie ingredients, place them in a phyllo base and add a poached egg and hollandaise. Sounds pretty good to me except that the phyllo looked and tasted like paper. Come on guys! Get some butter on each layer and bake it until it turns brown! It was like eating the newspaper in which fish and chips come in :-).The dinner was a real downer:Scallop Santorini... orzo pasta with no seasoning. What about a pinch of salt in the boiling water? The tomato sauce was joyless and tasted like canned tomatoes (in NC, in the summer...). Seared scallops??? They looked and tasted like they were boiled directly out of the freezer: No color, no sear, no taste, super bland. They were as white as the houses in Santorini. That explains the name of the dish.Fisherman's pasta... same scallops as above, rubbery shrimp and some mussels I did not even want to try.My advice if you want to go there would be to enjoy the terrace, have a few small plates to share and finish off with a greek coffee.

I consider it to be somewhat healthier than your average fast food and the food at Greek Fiesta is also reliably tasty. The people who work at this location are very nice and I am here often enough to be recognized by the regular staff (not sure if this is a good or bad thing). When going to other locations, I used to always get the sampler platter, which includes tabuoli, grape leaves, hummus, pita and a kabob (chicken is my choice). The hummus is very good for being from a fast food place. However, my regular choice now is the chicken and cheese pita with a side Greek salad. Their Greek salads are really good and include a lot of feta (my favorite) as well as a good amount of dressing. Josh will usually get the gyro which he has said is good too. I consider the prices to be a little bit high for what you get (although the food really is very tasty so I don't mind paying it), coming in at nearly $10 for a pita, side salad and drink.

(I still think they need to improve on their host staff. They are neither welcoming nor friendly.)Like deja vu, their course timing was off. I wasn't even finished with my Sitti salad (which is very light, simple, but surprising delish) when our entrees came out. And since we were seated at a 2-top table, there was no room to keep both my salad and entree so I had to give up on my salad before I was done. I ordered the Fatteh: stewed lamb over basmati rice, crispy phyllo chips, pine nuts, whipped yogurt and garlic. Now that I reread the description, I do want to clarify and say that I did not get the crispy phyllo chips but more so crispy pita chips (big difference IMO because I love phyllo). I barely touched my dish. I already knew that lamb would have a strong, distinct meat flavor in contrast to the more commonly consumed beef, pork, or chicken. However, despite the lamb, the fatteh lacked flavor overall. It was quite honestly BLAND. And because even the pita chips were dull-tasting, I couldn't bare to finish it.Our awesome server realized that and seriously asked how I thought of my dish. Apparently the fatteh has had some negative responses before me. So he kindly took it off my bill and treated us to an amazing dessert. I don't even know what it was, and it's not on their website. But it definitely had phyllo! as well as thin slices of banana, pistachios, honey, and I think maybe a ricotta filling? something light and creamy, and there was definitely some lavender, which was absolutely amazing. \u00a0Sitti has only improved 1 star from my second experience. 1. Food (besides the Fatteh) is actually pretty good (I just will try a different entree).2. Servers are awesome.3. Host staff needs work.4. Do they still have courtyard seating?

The menu was the typical items one would expected from a Lebanese restaurant and since it was cold out I decided on hot tea, their selection was limited. They had about three different kinds presented in the tea box. I ordered the yogurt dip for appetizer. It was tangy & delicious. The bread is fresh & warm brought to the table. It was perfect. I ordered a lentil soup and a small house salad with olive oil and lemon vinaigrette which was delicious. The soup wasn't hot which is major let down for me but maybe others don't care as much.

Ever had Lebanese food? I never did before I went to Sitti, don't be afraid, it's excellent. Slight complaint from my picky vegetarian wife: the vegetable kabobs are cooked on the same surface as the meat kabobs, so...... for some picky vegetarian people that may be a no-go. We learned that because we were seated once at the table that can look right into the kitchen. Anyway, regardless of what you order at Sitti, they start you off with a basket of delicious, warm pitas. I don't know exactly how to describe it, but they taste different than your standard pita. Maybe a little bit more airy? Maybe a little less floury? I'm not sure, but it's good. And the pitas are perfect for the Hummus you should order. Come on, it's only $6 bucks, and it's probably the best Hummus I've had in Raleigh so far. So, I've had a variety of dishes at Sitti, and have been really pleased with all of them. The lamb chops (though pretty pricey at $28) are great. The chicken kabob is also really good. My picky vegetarian wife liked the vegetable kabob until she learned about the aforementioned grill issue. My go-to at Sitti is the Artichoke Chiken. I usually balk at eating Artichoke anything, but at Sitti it's great. For people who don't know anything about middle eastern food I strongly recommend the Sitti tasting plate, it includes a variety of appetizers (hummus, baba Ghanouj, and the freaking awesome cheese rolls), as well as a kibii and garlic chicken. This is a great parent option. Sitti is right downtown, and it can be a nice people watching perch if you get a seat by the windows. Wifey and I went the night that NC State beat Villanova to get to the sweet sixteen, and we got to watch the city progressively lose it's mind while we enjoyed great food. It kind of made me feel like Nero watching Rome burn. Is that weird? Yeah, that's weird, give me a break, I'm listening to Tame Impala, and it's influencing my thoughts. Anyway, the service is okay, not bad, not great. Good enough. The ambiance is okay, not bad, not great. If you want a quiet experience, ask to sit downstairs, but doing that makes you invisible to your waiter, so you know, take that risk if you want. Another benefit of Sitti is that it is open on Sundays, which is trickier to find in Raleigh than one may think. So, in summation: you should try Sitti if you haven't, and due to the sampler plates, I can't think of anyone I'd be reluctant to take to Sitti."], ["Greg W.", "Don't fall for the restaurant week menu. We took a group of friends here during restaurant week. We've been pleased with Sitti and their setup, it's an open floor plan with a high end and swanky bar that oozes with class. This is accomplished with crisply dressed bartenders, lots of wood accents on an asymmetrical bar top, and modern decorations and cubby holes to hold the liquor on display. We started the night off with a few lighter drinks. They have a wide array of wines priced from the reasonable to the swanky, European choices. We did not venture into the cocktails, but they looked interesting and a bit out of the ordinary which is something that I find interesting. All in all, the drinks offered at the bar will provide patrons with something to match their taste and compliment their food. During restaurant week, there were a few of the offerings that were posted on the official menu submitted that were not on the printed menu when we arrived. This typically is not an issue because of the large menu that features their unique (Mediterranean/Middle-Eastern) twist on classics, but two of the options missing were vegetarian. That left nothing for the vegetarians to choose from on the restaurant week menu so they ended up ordering from the standard menu which increased their cost. That said, the food we ordered was excellent. I had the kabob plate with all the fixings and a mix of meat (kefta, chicken, beef). The vegetarian meals ordered were full flavored and enough to fill up the women who ordered them (runners, so no small feat) which is a typical complaint I have of such dishes - not the case here. The pita/hummus/tzatziki was a light starter full of lemon, parsley, and tart notes. It's better than most I've had in the area.I would highly recommend Sitti for those who enjoy Mediterranean and Middle-Eastern cuisine. However, I would not recommend their restaurant week menu based off this experience. If you plan to visit, go for the normal menu and enjoy your meal that way versus going for the restaurant week menu. It feels akin to a bait and switch and we typically end up ordering off the standard menu. However, items not being on a posted/official menu (not running out of it) is unacceptable in my mind - especially when it impacts individuals with a dietary restriction."], ["Cindy T.", "Atmosphere 4 starsFood 4 starsService 4 starsEverything was great!

My thoughts about Sitti are so rambly and all-over the place it's like my mind is a kid in a toy store - where do I start? The garlic whip is something made of heavenly cloud fluff and when you dip your juicy, tender meat in and bite into the two thoughtfully the only thing on your mind will be \"MUST. HAVE. MORE!\"One of my absolute favorite places in Raleigh and I'm hoping I'll find a suitable replacement when I leave NC (very soon) :("], ["Bobby H.", "My 4th time here and the food is always great.I love sitting downstairs where it's a little quieter, but the window seats are also great for an early dinner.The food has been great each time, though I've kept it to steak, chicken and all the hummus varieties.Feedback from my group is that the flat \u00a0breads are also great.Only semi issue is that the service can be a little hit or miss. Always polite, but not always on top of things."], ["Whiz D.", "Came from New York and was comparing it to the food there.

To start we had beet hummus, avocado hummus and pita bread. We also got Gaindes - a garlic butter base shrimp. I had to have my gin, lemonade and elderflower liquor mix - Delish. For dinner Matthew had Lambchops in a sweeter sauce. I had Fettah, or tender lamb stewed pieces over basmati rice paired with a Cabernet! For dessert we had Ashtha - or a banana, honey and pistachio dish with phyllo bread :) another great trace reservation made by my hubby in our new city! We wanted a little more in the decor and ambiance but it was great food nonetheless #hancockhelping - we'd be back To try more dishes!"], ["Andrea P.", "Just got back from Sitti, and I have very mixed feelings.The food was pretty good. Our table ordered the trio of appetizers and got baba ghannouj (delicious), feta dip (meh... the feta was overpowering), and the hummus (Incredibly bland). \u00a0For my entree I chose the goat stew, which was very tender and perfect in texture but lacking in flavor; the white truffle polenta compensated a bit, although I would've liked to see more play between the truffle and the creamy polenta... what I had seemed more like reassurance that I was getting my money's worth of truffle. The rest of my table was pretty happy with their kabob and market fish entrees. The drink I had was the Hibiscus Royale, which felt risky because I was worried about how natural that flavoring would be -- that worry was for no good reason, as the drink was great.The desserts looked great, and I was very pleased to note the Scotch collection Sitti offers. \u00a0I've been having trouble finding good arrays of single malts in Raleigh, so this was very exciting!The service was unapologetically terrible; granted, we had the new waitress, and it was a Sunday night, but she messed up everything and was impossible to get a hold of. \u00a0Worst of all, she never apologized for her mistakes; she actually seemed to be glaring at our table while her coworkers corrected her mistakes. \u00a0Very frustrating!"], ["Khoa N.", "Amazing lebanese food!! Thats all i have to say about it. They give me little food, but its so good so i dont mind. Definitely recommend this place."], ["Tasha R.", "This is my favorite restaurant ever.

Came here for a friend's birthday and since there were so many of us they gave us a pre fixed menu. The food was really good! I have to eat gluten free (Celiac) and they did a great job at accommodating my dietary needs. They made sure to bring out alternatives for me if there was a dish I couldn't eat. I think on the normal menu they have indicated what is gf as well. My friends also really enjoyed their dishes. The ambiance was nice and the service was great. Our server was very friendly and attentive. The only weird thing was that they originally told us we couldn't split the check and had to bring cash. So many of us decided to order drinks at the bar to make life easier once the bill came. They didn't like that and ended up giving us separate bills for the drinks (but still didn't split the main food bill)...I don't get it but whatever.

I dont think you can call it a ORANGE and goat cheese salad if you serve the salad with tiny slivers of oranges on each corner of the plate. ( total of 4 sliver of oranges) The salad overall had not much flavor and it was actually pretty bad.

I don't think I've ever loved a place more than this. The portion sizes are massive, even for the price, they are huge! The prices on fish are usually amazing, not as pricy as you would expect, but you do have to ask them for the market price. The appetizers are usually so big, you can order them as entrees along with a side, and have a very filling meal for around $10, which is a steal for the quality and quantity of food!

Although I enjoy sharing, it's by no means required at Sitti...you can definitely order your own entrees.The ambiance in this restaurant is exactly what I'm looking for in a dinner downtown, and the service has always been attentive, even when they're packed. \u00a0I'd recommend making a reservation since they're often busy, especially with so many events downtown these days. \u00a0Sometimes the parking decks nearby are free on the weekends (although this past weekend it cost $7 for the deck since Bikefest was in town), so if you don't want to pay for parking, leave yourself some extra time to hunt for street parking."], ["Carsten C.", "I went here twice for dinner, within one week. The first time, I had Samkeh Harrah (salmon) as the main course, and bread pudding for dessert, both delicious. Service was good, nice atmosphere, overall such a good experience that I decided to come back a few days later. This time, I ordered the lamb Fatteh. What I got was a pile of nicely prepared rice, large chunks of lamb, pita chips, and a few splashes of yoghurt. The lamb was so dry and chewy that I literally choked on one chunk that I didn't cut into small enough pieces. Don't know how they managed to ruin the meat like that - anyone who has cooked with lamb knows that it's easy to tenderize it with a yoghurt marinade, and I would expect a Lebanese restaurant to be able to prepare lamb properly. Won't be coming back, but they earned their 3 stars with the salmon."], ["Rohit B.", "Like the ambiance but that's it.

I was slightly worried everyone wouldn't get enough to eat and that there would be a problem because I was the only person of the 14 who needed gluten free items. Sitti assured me I could order separately if my group couldn't agree on some items that were safe for me. They even offered to let me bring in my own dessert because of their limited options. Turns out we came to an agreement on enough gluten free items. We arrived the night of and ordered drinks. The server made sure to identify the gluten free person (me!) first thing. Throughout the night, she made sure I had things plated separately if needed and alerted me to what items on the table were not gluten free. The restaurant made sure I had veggies for my hummus (instead of pita) and my own separate portion of rice for the main course. There was plenty of food for everyone (we even took home leftovers!)

The falafel appetizer was extremely crunch and difficult to even get a knife through, bland on the inside. All I tasted was a bit of cumin. Lamb and beef shwarma was not like any shwarma I had before. Usually it's sliced off a roast in thin pieces. This shwarma was in little chunks, like the size you'd get in a Chinese stir fry of beef and broccoli. Super underseasoned, bland. My husband had a chicken kabob sandwich which he said was very bland and boring as well. No seasoning. Even my son's kids meal of chicken and fries were underseasoned. The fries desperately needed some salt. The tahini sauce that came with everything literally tasted like tahini thinned out with water. Hardly any flavor at all. My Sitti salad was nothing more than some old lettuce on a plate with tomatoes that tasted like they had been in the fridge for 2 weeks, some cucumber and the most bland dressing I've ever tasted. Again, no seasoning at all. I think this place stays busy and benefits from being in a good location, but I can't understand why it gets the high reviews. Jasmin bistro, which is a chain, is so much better, as is Alexander's in Garner. Even Greek Fiesta is a lot better.

I had the filet with black pepper and a cognac cream sauce. \u00a0Yes, it was just about perfect, and I am not usually a fan of large amounts of black pepper. \u00a0I asked for medium rare, I got it. \u00a0Quality was just about perfect, the veggies and potatoes on the side were flavorful and just the right quantity. \u00a0Appetizers were all great, they do hummus and tabouli right and proper, while the spicy feta cheese dip was shockingly intense...in a good way, that is. So yes, if you're in downtown Raleigh, this is one place you really gotta experience. \u00a0I'll conclude with the jalapeno infused cocktail I had: it was this amazing blend of tangy and spicy that worked brilliantly with the filet. \u00a0After all that spice? \u00a0Finished it off with a pretty good Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, I kinda wish the sugar on top was a bit more caramelized(?) but that's about the worst thing I could possibly say. Definitely coming back if I come back to Raleigh."], ["Bridgette R.", "Had a mommy's night out here with a great friend. \u00a0She and I love similar foods. \u00a0She has been here many times. \u00a0It was my first visit. \u00a0Great ambiance, great service, fantastic food. \u00a0We had a wonderful night. \u00a0I can't wait to return."], ["Brad P.", "The food is great but it can get loud. \u00a0The times I have eaten at Sitti for dinner it was rock concert loud. \u00a0I don't know if it was a drink special or the acoustics of the old building, \u00a0I really did like their garlic aioli brings an intense garlic flavor that has to be tried to be believed.Atmosphere 3The dining room itself is kind of cool. \u00a0It is an older building that appears to have been some sort of retail space so it has big picture windows and a art deco style of design in the interior. \u00a0The one down side is it can get really loud.Service 5I have yet to have a bad experience with the service. \u00a0The wait staff have been consistently cordial and attentive.Food 4The food is some of the best Mediterranean food in Raleigh. \u00a0Everything I have had there has been delicious. \u00a0I got the Lebanese Tasting on my last visit and all of the items were great.Price 3It is not a cheap place to eat. \u00a0You can expect to drop $25 or more per person for dinner but the food is good."]], "Jasmin Mediterranean Bistro": [["C F.", "Great food for the price. \u00a0Nice atmosphere and quick service. Awesome hummus. Mediterranean Platter is my favorite."], ["Rob W.", "This place is OK for a quick meal. They have a pretty nice selection of items on the menu. I had the chicken platter. The meat and salad were nice. I also ordered the stuffed grape leaves, and they were a little weak, possibly premade days ago. All in all it was OK, but there is better in town."], ["Jeremy A.", "Jasmin is a great spot to stop in for to grab a quick lunch and they have a lot of options that revolve around pita sandwiches or platters. Our orders were ready very quickly and I'm the only one that had to wait because they freshly fried the falafel which is way better then leaving them under a heating lamp. Definitely going to be going back here again and adding it to my lunch rotation."], ["Leah A.", "Very delicious food. \u00a0I got the gyro Platter and the portions are large. \u00a0I paid 11.00 for the gyro platter and a fountain soda. \u00a0I felt the amount of food you get and the prices are reasonable. \u00a0I dined in and the atmosphere here is relaxing. \u00a0It's fresh and delicious"], ["Dwayne D.", "This is my second visit to this location. Good healthy food selection. Plenty of seating and clean. Today I ordered the gyro platter. Lots of food and worth the cost. I have ordered this before but didn't receive nearly the amount I received today. I guess it depends on your server for that day. Anyhow, nice fresh presentation and served hot. I highly recommend ordering this if you are hungry. Plenty of parking and friendly staff. I would also suggest saving room for a dessert."], ["Peter Y.", "Healthy, fast, cheap, tasty. Get their Jasmin platter, which consists of a protein (gyro meat or chicken, get the chicken), 2 sides (the coleslaw wasn't great, but the Greek salad and grape leaves are yum. I'd also recommend the hummus, as your platter comes with some pita to dip in) and some warm, soft pita bread.The amount of food is fairly generous (though it really depends on how generous your server is) and it tasted fresher than it looked.The prices were fair, and you can get in and out in about 5 minutes.All in all, a pretty solid lunch spot."], ["Andy W.", "This place is great spot for a cheap dinner or lunch. \u00a0The platters are filling and they have a decent amount of options on the menu. \u00a0My last visit will probably be my last visit. \u00a0The lettuce on my salad was old and soggy. The lamb meat was cold and had been sitting out for a while and I just really didn't feel the love. \u00a0The guy that made my food was a nice but his attention to detail was piss poor."], ["Eric H.", "This place is just ok. Nothing special. I came here looking for a healthier option lunch. The portion sizes are small and the prices are high. For example, I wanted a side of humus and for $3.99 I received a small bit of humus that fit into the small section of the portioned paper plate. What is that...3 or so ounces?So far I have witnessed two or three patrons walk out before ordering. This is an ok place, but there are much better options nearby that aren't so expensive."], ["Bruce G.", "Pretty good place for lunch. Ordered the gyro platter. Everything comes separate so had to scoop up the lettuce, tomatoes, sauce and put on all on the gyro. Not a big deal, but I prefer the gyro already put together I suppose. Fries were good and I liked the sauce to dip them in.I would come back again for another lunch visit."], ["Nathan P.", "When they're not openly hostile or rude they tend to be indifferent...so the service is pretty rotten.Sanitation is dubious.If a gyro and a drink cost three and a half dollars I might eat here three times a week despite the service and the clotted blood under the line cooks' fingernails and the chorus of insects chirping behind the counter......just the worst quality bleached-out cheap-for-them-but-not-for-you frozen fries, mealy tomatoes, brown-on-the-edges lettuce, two-dollar-one-size go-cups...This is what it tastes like...when doves cry..."], ["Jon B.", "Good Mediterranean food within five minutes of my house? Thank you, Jasmin! I had not eaten at any of their other locations, but heard it was good so I was excited to try them out. Have been a few times now and the food has been very good each time. I've had the gyro sandwich, falafel sandwich, and a platter which Mrs. B and I shared. The Jasmin sauce they give with the fries is like crack, and the falafel is probably the best I've had around here other than Neomonde's.Not sure what is up with the complaints about the pricing. I haven't found them to be any more expensive than other Mediterranean places in the area. The platters have a decent amount of food which can be shared if you aren't starving. A gyro sandwich combo runs around $8-9. I've had a bit better and a bit worse gyros for the same price."], ["Mary T.", "The food is good. The prices are okay. Their ability to correctly pronounce \"gyro\" is unfortunate."], ["Brittany G.", "I enjoy this new Jasmin location significantly more than the Hillsbrough street one! Much cleaner, quieter but still full of people enjoying the food! The counter layout seemed to help the flow of people as well. Came here on my lunch break (I just realized that it was FINALLY opened) and was overall impressed with the food! The gyro pita was stuffed with meat and veggies, the grape leaves were filling and came with a side of yogurt to dip them in and the baklava was wonderful! I could have ate them all day! My bill came to just about $10 even, which in my opinion is a bit pricy for a regular lunch, but i'm sure i'll come back every now and then when i'm craving a good gyro."], ["Jordan P.", "Enjoyed the food but wow is the service horrible. More so at this specific location, but also at other locations. I have called in three times for a pick up order where no one answered the phone. I called 4-5 times thinking I had the wrong number and no answer. When someone did pick up, there was laughing in the background and I was told \"we didn't hear the phone ring\" or \"um we were on the other line.\" The one time someone did answer the phone, the woman on the line was rude and hung up on me and continued to have a bad attitude when I came to get my food. If you would like to keep any customers coming back (because the food is actually pretty good) I recommend you invest in attentive and polite staff."], ["Kenghis K.", "I was in the mood for some Mediterranean food, so I thought I'd stop by Jasmin and grab myself a bite to eat. \u00a0When I walked into the store, I was greeted by a nearly empty dining room with two or three tables filled with patrons who were already eating. \u00a0Sadly, that was the only thing that greeted me. \u00a0Neither of the two employees working in the front paid me any attention.I work in the food industry, and I have always made it point to greet customers when the step into the restaurant of where I'm working. \u00a0It is professional and welcoming to our patrons. \u00a0If I can't attend \u00a0to a customer right away, I ask them to wait for a moment and I will get to them as soon as I can.I didn't even get eye contact with these two. \u00a0The woman working the hot table was plating a to-go box, but she never even looked up and made eye contact with me. \u00a0Giving her the benefit of the doubt for just being super focused, I patiently waited 7-10 minutes waiting to get some service. \u00a0The real kicker came when this girl came in behind me. \u00a0The moment she came in, the woman looked up, looked right past me, and greeted the girl.I was livid. \u00a0There I stood waiting all that time for service and didn't even get a greeting. \u00a0Then this girl comes in a few minutes behind and she instantly gets acknowledged. \u00a0Needless to say, I turned around, left and drove 10 minutes to Neomonde where my patronage have always been appreciated.I've been reflecting about why I was treated the way I was treated and am still baffled. \u00a0This is the conclusion I've come to so far. \u00a0All of the other patrons were male, so I've ruled out my gender. \u00a0I'm usually a quiet person, but the girl who came in behind me was also quiet and didn't even say a word. \u00a0The only factor I can think of was that I was the only Asian in the establishment. \u00a0I would hate to think that my race played a factor in the quality (or lack of) service I received. \u00a0However, if that's the case then I would be disappointed that places like Jasmin would feel that way towards people like me."], ["Josh P.", "Gyro meat is occasionally fresh off the spit, but if you don't see the spit then don't order it. Because it's just being kept in a warmer and it will taste like it. This location has an issue with cleanliness. I saw empty containers of food sitting on the back counter collecting gnats."], ["Molly M.", "I love this place for lunch - it has replaced Zoe's Kitchen as my go-to quick Mediterranean. Their hummus and pita are particularly delicious and I love the perfectly spicy shawarma chicken."], ["KK W.", "Not perfect but quick, unique and delicious. \u00a0After spending time in New York City I have been on the hunt for good shawarma in Raleigh and have not had any luck. \u00a0Until now. \u00a0Come at lunch before 1PM and the shawarma is FANTASTIC. \u00a0I've also tried the gyro and the spicy chicken panini, which has shawarma and spicy mediterranean slaw wrapped in a tortilla and grilled on a panini press. \u00a0It is absolutely fantastic. \u00a0Also the lentil rice is good, the baba ghanouj (sp?). \u00a0Nothing really negative to say about this place, except that when they get busy they have a hard time keeping up. \u00a0but that's easy to forgive when the food is awesome!"], ["Chip M.", "Came here for lunch while I was getting my tires rotated/balanced at discount tire. Granted I came at about 1:30, I was the only person in the place. Not usually a good sign. The staff were friendly but a little spacey. I asked for some recommendations but got little substance in return. No big deal. I went with a veggie bowl and was pleasantly surprised. It was flavorful, full of lentils (sorry about the other reviewer) and the tzatziki was ample. For $10 it was a bit high for what I got, though I would like to try it again before I search elsewhere. It was really decent, albeit generic, Lebanese food that certainly won't offend anyone. 3 stars... for now."], ["Kim B.", "We went here a couple of weeks ago. Food was okay but too pricey in my opinion for the value. They remind me of a subways because they try to fill you up on everything but the meat and take make sure you don't get much.
