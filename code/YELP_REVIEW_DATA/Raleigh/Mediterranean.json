The food came out relatively quickly and looked nicely presented on the plates. However, some of the meats seemed overcooked and were a bit dried out, but still had pretty good flavors. The hummus was very mild and seemed a bit grainy. We commented that it just needed some acidity. The pita bread was almost crunchy and was rather thin, which was a disappointment. However the tabouli and grape leaves were both tasty and fresh. The tahini sauce on the shawarma wraps was tasty and really added some good moisture to the wraps. The french fries were nicely fried and a golden brown, and everyone enjoyed them. And the best part of all of the dishes - the hot sauce - was a tasty addition to anything on the table.

I ordered my food \"to go\", and it took roughly 5 minutes to complete my order. The man behind the counter recommended their kabobs as their specialty, which I will have to try next time.

The gyro platter included deliciously herbed and spiced lamb and beef, served with greek salad, hummus, and tzatziki sauce. Perfect. :) The hummus was fresh, with perfect flavor, and the tzatziki sauce was the best I've had at any Mediterranean restaurant. I loved the pita bread that was served with the gyro platter, too!

My sides came out first, the green beans were delish; very well-seasoned and a generous portion for a side. The baba ghannouj was plentiful also and came with some bread. More of an appetizer than a side, so I am glad it came out well ahead of the kabobs. Others who came after me starting getting their orders, which made me worry, so I inquired about my lamb kabobs. The cook told me they were coming out soon, and they did. The lamb was very succulent, and tender. I don't eat lamb often but theirs was perfectly cooked and flavorful. They kabobs were served on top of a bed of rice and squash. It was great, but I couldn't quite finish it all. It was just a little but too much food for me for lunch.

It's a bit expensive ($10 for a tall plastic takeout thingy, same size as if you get a \"large\" at a Chinese takeout restaurant), but they're a nice treat.There is SO MUCH oil in those things though -- it drips and runs with it, and there's olive oil pooled at the bottom of whatever container you order it in -- so please DO NOT think that this is a healthy option for you. It's 190 calories and 17 GRAMS of saturated fat in a 5 OZ serving of vegetables... which is exceptionally tiny, that little cup."], ["Peter Y.", "Having lived in Europe, I generally try to avoid Mediterranean food in the US just because for the most part, it doesn't come close. However, seeing as how I was strapped for time and needed something quick, I decided to stop by Zoe's Kitchen on my way back to work.The interior pretty much mirrored your typical fast food places, with the cashier up front and tables throughout. Since this was my first time there, the cashier patiently explained the process as she waited for my order. I ended up going with their spinach roll-up with chicken and a side of coleslaw. The food came out pretty fast, but not at the expense of the quality. The spinach roll-ups were delicious; tasty enough on their own, but with the sauce, was absolutely out of this world. It was the perfect blend of savory and sweet.The coleslaw wasn't bad, but had a bit too much mayo. Otherwise, the meal was flawless.Thanks Zoe's, for restoring my faith in Mediterranean food in the US!"], ["Brittany G.", "Always good solid Mediterranean style food when i'm craving something healthy without breaking the bank! The restaurant is quick, clean and everyone who works there is very helpful if you have questions! They have a killer rewards program too so be sure to check that out!My favorite thing here actually is the potato salad, I don't eat mayo so I appreciate that theirs doesn't have any in it! It's very good! Another favorite is the greek salad. Everything i've had here was fresh, and well seasoned. Yum!"], ["Morgan H.", "The staff and the atmosphere of the restaurant are excellent. But the food is awful and not worth the price. It is very bland. The chicken is dry and the steak was slightly undercooked. The side of vegetables were burnt. The Greek salad dressing has no taste. When I informed the staff member of my concerns he listened and went to get a manager. I was not given a manager because the manager felt my concern was not good enough and inaccurate about the food quality. So the manager did not come out to speak with me about my concerns, he sent the staff member back to discuss my concerns. The manager told the staff member that I should put salt and pepper on the food if it was bland. Honestly if you are in the area I would not recommend this restaurant. If you are looking for good food there are many restaurants around it. One I would recommend is The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar."], ["Aarti G.", "The people were friendly and the place was pretty crowded at lunch time, but the food was just okay. \u00a0My salad consisted of a bunch of greens but not many vegetables or toppings. \u00a0The dressing on the table just tasted like oil even after it was shaken which added no flavor to the greens. \u00a0My pimento cheese was a glob of cheese on bread. \u00a0Even though I asked for the sandwich to be grilled, it ended up just being greasy rather than warm. \u00a0Pita bread was served with all our meals, but there was no hummus. \u00a0There should be a hummus side option in addition to the appetizer. \u00a0I'm sure people would order it as a side. \u00a0Overall, I was not amazed by my experience here despite all the recommendations and would probably not come here again."], ["Matt W.", "Had the chicken pita. Feta was inside at the bottom, the carmel onions were at the bottom, and the lettuce was eh. So it was good, but not put toegther well. I could prob make same at home. Came with side of beans which I didnt eat. Oatmeal raisin cookie was good. Next time ill get quinoa bowl which alot of the other people got."], ["Tanya H.", "Food is fresh and delicious!! I'm addicted to the grilled chicken and slaw pita. The grilled chicken is moist and so flavorful! Greek salad is crisp and fresh. Zoe's branded dressing is awesome. Grilled chicken kabobs are delicious as well."], ["Kuanyu C.", "If you hang out at North Hills long enough, eventually you will end up at Zoes Kitchen; it's not on the popular side (with other restaurants and movie theater) of North Hills, but if you grocery shopping at Harris Teeter, or hang out for pints at World of Beer, this little sandwich bistro should be a lunch or early dinner spot.The color coordination resembles those frozen yogurt places that keep popping up in this town, with bright orange and yellow and mustard green. Interior design is easy on the eyes, and spacious enough to accommodate full-house lunch hour crowd. The patio is also big enough for 7-8 tables outside enjoying the sun when the weather allows.The foods resemble a trendy light lunch menu: pimento cheese sandwich, and Greek pita, and kabobs, and grilled chicken plate, and soups and hummus and side fruit cups. There are also gluten free selections should that be of use to you."], ["Kristy A.", "Zoe's is a delight all the way around - from the bright and cheerful decor to the smiling staff to the excellent Mediterranean food. \u00a0 Their menu includes sandwiches, salads, pitas, kabobs, etc. and all of it is good. \u00a0 My fave is the chicken kabobs with rice and Greek salad. \u00a0A healthy portion that I can pretend is actually healthy (it's not, by the way). \u00a0 The good news is that if you want to actually be health conscious (instead of just pretending), they have a menu just for that. \u00a0The special menu includes several pared down options from their regular menu so you can have a hearty meal that doesn't completely derail your diet. \u00a0Just be sure to skip the Greek dressing, which is crazy packed with calories. \u00a0Another plus -- the take home dinners for four. \u00a0You could unpackage it and pass it off as your own. \u00a0I won't tell."], ["Jennifer H.", "Hands down, the BEST pimento cheese I have had in my life. The consistency is perfect. There is an ever so slight hint of heat (I don't do spicy) that makes it unique, without overwhelming the taste."]], "Babylon Restaurant": [], "Sassool": [], "Troy Mezze Lounge and Bar": [], "Kabobi": [], "Jasmin Mediterranean": [], "Jasmin Mediterranean Bistro": [], "Justin's Grill": []}
