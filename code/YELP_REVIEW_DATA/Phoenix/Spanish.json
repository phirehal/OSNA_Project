We sat on the patio since it was such a nice night out. Half of the tables were plastic card tables and chairs with table clothes. It was a strange contrast to the other patio furniture and indoor decor. Our service was ok. We had to request a refill of the water bottle twice and the waitress just seem to agree with is but not really know the ins and outs. As for the food our party had the lemon chicken, braised short ribs, crab cakes and lasagne with sausage. Only the lemon chicken got a somewhat thumbs up. It only had some slightly burnt areas and was a little too lemony. The braised short ribs were moderately burnt not that it mattered because it was so salty there was no taste beyond that. I sent mine home with my friend to give to her husband, maybe he could eat it. The lasagna had potential if the entire top layer wasn't a piece of charcoal. It was nice to discover that under the excess sauce and sausage. Inedible. My friend then asked for the crab cake appetizer. That got an ok as well with only slightly burnt edges. Because we were still hungry we decided to order dessert, chocolate creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with brandies cherries. It was good I think but over half was made of cherries. I thought they would be on top or on the side, but we're in the dish. The side of bread was delicious, which made us think we should have stuck with pizza. Doubtful any of us will return since there are so many other options to try."], ["John G.", "Timo is in a really cool space - great atmosphere!We started lunch with the Sriracha Shrimp small plate. \u00a0It was pretty good, but not something I'd order again.Ordered the Loaded Italian pizza - the toppings were really tasty. \u00a0The crust...ummm...not so much. \u00a0It was kind of spongy, no char, just not what I'm looking for in a wood fired pizza.4 stars for the atmosphere and toppings, 2 stars for the crust - averages out to 3 stars."], ["Danica L.", "We enjoyed the meal but it was a hefty cost that we paid for it. It's four stars for the food and two stars on drinks. Five stars on the setting and service. The meatballs were ok, the spicy sriracha shrimp was fajita like with more heat, but the pizza was fab. A glass of wine is pricey here and it doesn't go that long of a way either. Maybe the long drive had me parched but the glasses of wine seemed fairly smaller than the average pours. For a tapas place, wine is a must but it would be nice to have lower priced glasses available or perhaps more types to choose from in the glass option. Soda is served in a can, yes they give you the can. Indeed the patio was Amazing and the ambiance was perfect. A little crowded but manageable. I'd go again but would choose happy hour."], ["Courtney C.", "I want to say that I was not expecting to find such a good restaurant in Arizona.I was here for a convention with the American Cancer Society. I was with friends and we decided that we needed to go out to a nice girl night dinner the first night that we arrived. I never though that I would find this gem.I would've given it a five star but the service was not the best. Food: was amazing! Such a good menu. They had so much good food. I went with a bunch of girls and we had share all our food. It was my first time having escargot and it was surprising good. There is a brie soup with truffle oil and I highly recommend that you try this. The spinach dip was amazing and I love the toast they serve with it. Also, if you like scallops, you must try this places scallops because they were cooked perfectly. They have a cool brochette plate where you can pick three of there brochette and the brochette is huge. I highly recommend doing the brochettes because they are big and totally worth the price (about $13). It is also very filling. However, my friend was little disappointed with the salmon because it wasn't warm (i think or there was too much). The atmosphere: Its very romantic and they have an outside patio area with lights and it so pretty. Also, there chairs are like little couches or comfy chairs. I sat with my friend on this little leather couch. Its a very intimate setting. Def a good place to bring a date or have a girls night. Lastly, I will say I really enjoyed the sangrias because they were so tasty and fresh."], ["Lisa C.", "Another visit to Timo. \u00a0As always, quickly seated and attended to. \u00a0Had my usual butternut squash soup and corn bread (not like regular corn bread...this stuff is insane!) and this time had diver scallops...with pesto. \u00a0Surprisingly delicious. \u00a0I had intended to ignore the pesto and ended up swiping the scallops in it! \u00a0And then, when I left and realized, 20 minutes later, \u00a0that I had left my phone there, I went zipping back. \u00a0The waiter had it tucked safely behind the bar and when he saw me came running over with it. \u00a0Great service and, as always, a great dinner."], ["Kaily N.", "Wow. This place I'm definitely returning to. Very unique in its own right. A must for dinner, early to mid evening. The setting is a little darker on the back patio but it's too pretty not to sit out there. Very hip and very romantic feel. I think it's an old firehouse. They offer two unisex restrooms that are very clean. There's a big firepit on the back patio that I think you can reserve. Oh... Their food?? Yeah let me get to that :) Their bruschetta I was NOT expecting. They're huge!! We tried all of them and all of them were amazing. Especially the one with tomato, brie, and olives. Yummm. I asked our waitress, who took a little while to get to us but it was a bit busy, what light sweeter red wine she recommended and said to get one of the light Pinot Noir's. Can't remember the name... Bridge Water maybe? I got the Brie Soup, which was a bit Salty but soo delicious. My date ordered the Crab Cake Benedict and that is a MUST try. I was jealous. And. The. Chocolate.

The ambiance. 3. The quality of service. TIMO gets 5 stars for both their food and ambiance, and about 3.5 for the service. Now, the service isn't bad whatsoever, but I really enjoy a vivacious and personable waiter/waitress that spends a little time chatting with us. The place is small indoors, but cozy, with a brick oven and all. Outside has a really nice lounge area with a large fire pit and lights/heaters all over. Very romantic. The food is really really good. We've eaten here twice, and both times we had appetizers, salads, entrees, and even desserts. ALL fantastic, with consistent quality! And I think what I love most about this little gem, is that it's \"hidden\" and none of our friends really know about it, so we always feel cool when referring people! ;-)"], ["Debra W.", "Timo's was selected as this month's foodie adventure for our work party of 9 was which excellent with the help of our awesome server, Kevin who even helped us celebrate a couple of birthdays. We enjoyed Kevin's many recommendations for both good and wine!Making a decision for Top Picks was tough as everything was deliciously prepared. We enjoyed all 3 thin crust pizzas but picked the (def not ordinary) Mediterranean for originality and the Chicken Jalape\u00f1o for creativity. The Spicy Copa stood out as the best amongst the other selection of delicious bruschetta. For Tapas, the crab cakes. Best for sharing was the Artichoke & Spinach dip, another def not ordinaryAnd for Oven Pizzas, the short ribs. To be honest, it was tough making choices because there wasn't a bad dish on the menu; which we probably covered about 90%. We will definitely keep this one at the top of the list!

With modern decor, friendly and courteous staff, wonderful dishes, and excellent rotating specials, you'll have a marvelous time. Amy, the bartender working every time I've visited, has been charismatic, perfect with her suggestions, and an absolute pleasure to dine with. I have had the bruschetta, the brie soup, several salads (the oven-roasted chicken salad tonight), the prosciutto pizza, the chicken pesto burrata BLT, and the creme brulee, and not once have I been disappointed with my choice in the slightest. Brunch on the lovely dog-friendly patio has been charming, and they've had no issues with providing a wide palette of different options for my vegan and vegetarian friends.

Granted, we did come here on a Monday in the middle of the day and there were no other customers, but just the quality of the food itself was poor. The buttersquash soup had a gelatinous consistency with way too much flour in it. It tasted like gummy potpourri. The plum tomato soup was watery and tasted like Campbell's soup. Having recently enjoyed Postino's and even Sauce's tomato soups, Timo's soup was a considerable disappointment. The bread for the sandwiches was not freshly baked and lacking depth compared to other fresh baked breads. There was nothing \"wood fired\" about it- more like \"heated really quickly in a wood oven.\" Definitely will not be returning here for food but perhaps for wine on the patio, which is a nice find for the area and is dog friendly!!"], ["Christine P.", "I think this might be the spot. this place is so cute.

The artichoke dip is another that's always outstanding.There bruschetta is quite nice it has a bit of a twist to it as you can select from a variety of toppings from traditional to neuvo. The wood fired pizza is terrific! The sandwiches to die for yummy... And have I mentioned the wine... It is a solid list of good wines at really reasonable values. They are hand picked and change regularly, most can be by the glass or the bottle. There are three specials two of which are in the menu. The third you need to know about as it is a hidden one for regular customers. Look for the Sunday and Monday specials on the menu, they both will make for a great meal for two including the wine... for the price most of us would gladly pay for the bottle alone. *** Tip The third requires you to be on the email list and is sent out on a regular basis.

It's probably because it's kinda gross inside. The service is average. The food is good however it is cold half of the time. We may wait awhile to try this place again.

They were both rushing around and once tables got up to leave, tables stayed dirty and were never bussed...I suggest they get a server assistant to help run food!

Also in the voicemail was her distaste for my yelp review that she called \"harsh\". She does say \"I apologize\" at one point in a tone and verbiage that is clearly an \"I'm sorry, I'm not sorry\".\"Hi Rae, this is Jennifer with Jennifer's catering... I would love to chat with you. I know that you chatted with Amanda yesterday and I see you had a \"very large problem with that\", so I'd like to talk to you about that. I apologize if she came across...um... harsh? But... uh, yeah... this yelp review is awfully harsh too. BUT, I think she was just going by the guidelines but, uh... obviously that was very (inaudible) to you so I'd like to discuss.\"Jennifer ends the message by leaving her number and an extremely curt \"Thank you\". How inappropriate can you get?!? The only reason you have my information is because I gave it your staff member before I realized what kind of a company I was dealing with. The information was given under the pretense that I wanted to hire you to cater an event, not call and complain about my very accurate, well deserved yelp review and subsequent review update. A tip: Don't call and leave voicemails complaining about yelp to the yelper who left it for you in the first place. How in the world do you have a successful business when you don't know the basics of customer service, hospitality and appropriate business behavior? I'd also like to add, if you had called and were actually professional, apologetic and genuinely concerned about \"very large problem\" & the poor experience I had in the first place, instead of your yelp reviews, I would have gladly changed/amended it to say that you called and cared. Instead, you shot yourself in the foot and now this is here... To anyone who is thinking of hiring this company, you've been warned!

As in, I tried it this past weekend, and oh, I'm already going back today. I was excited to see that the place was packed because I want this market to be around for a long time.The LOCATION is great. \u00a0In the complex with Antique Gatherings, Poor Little Rich Girl and Zipps, Right next to Crudo, and facing 36th Street. They've taken limited exterior space, and managed to make a great outdoor patio (that doesn't face Indian School - yay!). INSIDE - ohemgee. Exposed ceiling, french-inspired chandeliers, and cafe tables. The devil is in the details, and they nailed it. Even the water beverage bar is on a french industrial table, while the order numbers for your table are made of solid wood with bold-font numbers. It feels provincial, trendy and local at the same time. I like a well-designed space. \u00a0The SERVICE was great. \u00a0Diners order at the counter and the food comes to you. As soon as we walked in, a server told us the process, gave us menus and told us to make ourselves comfortable at a table while we decided. \u00a0This avoids a long line at the counter. \u00a0While we sat and looked at the menu, we were served water and asked if we had questions. \u00a0(Although this is an order at the counter cafe, we never had to get up to refill our water glasses. \u00a0The servers were on top of this for us.)And we did have a question - which of the MENU items do we try because they all sounded ridiculously good. \u00a0Traditional lunch and dinner entrees and \"nosh boards.\" We went for the Molten Fondue Nosh Board because we were on a diet (I kid, I kid.) Fresh fruit, locally-made sausage, bread and pretzel bites on a great wooden board with a small cruet of fondue. It was a prefect light lunch for two. \u00a0And it was so good that when we finished the board, I was honestly tempted to drink the few remaining drops of the fondue straight. \u00a0(Maybe they should offer this as a cocktail \"molten fondue, neat.\") We didn't have dessert or pastries, but the looked worth the splurge.Last but not least, the \"GRAB N' GO \" \u00a0A fridge of prepared entrees that you can buy and pop in the oven at home. I was excited to see entrees in a range of palates - sophisticated choices for an adult get-together to comfort food for the kiddos. (I hear the mac n' cheese is so addictive you should warn your arteries.)My only point of contention (every review has one) is that they are closed two days - Mondays and Tuesdays. \u00a0Deal breaker? \u00a0Nah. I'm hoping they're testing the waters and might compromise on one day for those of us hoping to pop in to grab an entree or two for dinner.So clearly, I'm a fan.

The smoked salmon pesto is worth noting as well. When I'm in the mood for something lighter I usually go for the mixed greens salad with pear, candied nuts, Gorgonzola and a light vinaigrette.

Yummy White bean with chopped tomatoes....round two please..At first I looked at the price...$14 for Bruschetta but you get to choose up to 4 different varieties so that was great.

It had a very relaxed, chill atmosphere and comfortable seating options where you could choose table, high tops, booths, or even couches. Music was a bit loud, but still enjoyed the vibe.

The best \"personal touch\" is the stamped toilet paper- def clever idea. The bathrooms are unisex and frankly when that busy should be catered to more- papers on the floor, overflowing trash, etc.Food- started w/the butcher's block- cured meats and cheeses- very good but not very much hard cheese at all. Bruscheta tried two- the burrata, bacon tomato is fantastic, the smoked salmon average. Prosciutto panini is OK- not warm/pressed enough and bread too think so that is mostly what you taste.Waitress wasn't that friendly (unfortunately) and did not know the wine list that well so could not describe the actual wines by the glass. Also did not offer wine list per bottle which we would have ordered as better selection.Overall nice place to come experiment if you are a foodie."], ["Erica G.", "Oh, Postino how I love you so. \u00a0During my most recent visit on Labor Day with a fellow Yelping friend of mine, we had quite the memorable experience.

Truly, he went the extra mile with his positive attitude and engaging conversation. Furthermore, all of the servers we encountered were incredibly hospitable, friendly, and considerate. Now, for the food and drink. The menu is simple yet superb: soups, salads, sandwiches, and most popularly bruschetta are the options.

The bread was soft, wish it was a little crispier but it makes for easy eats cause it's not hard to bite into!

There are so many choices.Brie & Apple with Fig Spread, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Warm Artichoke Spread, the yummy Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios and a few others that were not so great.We all enjoyed anything with Figs on it. The plates were very colorful and the quality of the food was very high and fresh. Sounds like a good portion of their products come from right here in the valley.

Maybe I'm justing getting too old for the late night thing.Seen other reviews saying that the best areas to sit are on the patio or right between the inside and outdoor seating area. Not sure how that works when it is a crisp 118 degrees outside. I bet the cheese starts melting rather fast.Definitely a fun and enjoyable time.

One bright spot - the marscapone mashed potatoes, some of the best mashed potatoes I have ever had.The dessert was seriously lacking. I had a layer cake with peanut butter in it, I seriously thought that it came out of a Hostess box (no offense to Twinkies), it was the most bland and uninspiring dessert I have had in a long time. One coworker had a banana dessert that looked great, but no guarantees....Lastly, they just redid their wine list, eliminating many of the upper end wines.

Extra bonus is the generous pieces of postres , desserts such as flan , tres gracias cake, eclairs and more. We shared and were satisfied with the rich but not fake tasting flan and tres gracias cake. I look forward to going back.

As much as I love my mom, I hate to say that this lomo saltado is just as good (maybe even a bit better - please don't tell her). I told my hubby that I have to take him here so that he can try it out for himself. I even loved their rocoto (hot peppered sauce) and I dipped my french fries in them.

They start everyone of with tasty complimentary corn nuts. We started with the Peruvian Specialty Appetizer called papas a la huancaina that means basically a boiled potato topped with a creamy chile cheese sauce. I thought it tasted good but for me this dish is an acquired taste kind of dish because of the texture. I ordered the Arroz Chaufa (a chicken fried rice) because it sounded like the lightest dish on the menu. The chicken in my dish was developed with flavor and was very moist. I thought this dish was tasty but it was an extremely large portion so I took half home.My husband had the Frijol con Seco a la Nortena (basically a beef stew with rice and beans). I tried a little piece of beef that also was prepared well and was flavorful and moist. The pickled onions were bright and bursting with lime flavor. This was also a large portion.The pictures of the desserts looked interesting and mostly different from other desserts I've seen and our server talked me into getting his favorite dessert the crema volteada. It was like a very dense flan with a dark sugar coating. It seemed rich and wasn't too sweet.Service was very friendly and welcoming."], ["Betsa R.", "The food was just ok.

I enjoy the Yuca and the two sauces. Some of the Yuca pieces were hard and stringy, but the rest was quite nice. The Mariscos were a disappointment. A few pieces of the seafood were very hard and chewy like they were seriously overlooked. These pieces were inedible. Most of the rest of the dish was good, but not great. I was expecting more flavor that would make this uniquely Peruvian. I will come back again and order a completely different entre\u00e9. I want to like this place and I think it's definitely worth another shot."], ["Mark C.", "Its a good sign when you feel explosively full after a meal and yet still wear a silly grin on your face. \u00a0Such was the case during my first visit to El Chullo. Admittedly I'm a novice when it comes to Peruvian cuisine so it was with some apprehension that I ventured here on a Saturday around Noon. \u00a0I had seen the great reviews this place was getting, but honestly had no idea what to order when I got there. \u00a0Fortunately my waitress helped guide me through it, and helped me make some delicious choices indeed.As with so many Mom & Pop ethnic establishments in the Downtown Phoenix vicinity, the restaurant is a small space in an old building. \u00a0This space is on the northeast corner of 7th Street & Virginia, in between a barber shop and a convenience store. \u00a0There's barely any parking up front (though there were available spots when I arrived). \u00a0There is, fortunately, extra parking available in back (take the alleyway east of the convenience store and you'll run into a parking lot leading into El Chullo's back entrance). \u00a0The restaurant itself seats about 20-25 including the bar area. \u00a0When you walk in you immediately hear the Peruvian dance music in the background. \u00a0When I arrived just before Noon I was actually the only customer there, though the lunch crowd started streaming in shortly thereafter. \u00a0A quick FYI that from 10am-Noon on the weekends, they serve breakfast only. \u00a0It was close enough to Noon that they allowed me to go with the lunch menu instead, but just be aware of this if you're coming here on the weekend. \u00a0I started things off by ordering a traditional Pisco Sour. \u00a0Pisco is basically a type of Peruvian Brandy and a Sour is traditionally mixed with lime, syrup, bitters, and egg whites. \u00a0Wow, talk about refreshing. \u00a0There's enough alcohol to remind you its a cocktail, but truly a smooth, delicious, easy drinking cocktail perfect for any occasion. \u00a0For an appetizer I went with the Causa Rellena with crab filling (you can also choose a chicken filling). \u00a0Two potato cakes with crab filling and avocado in the middle, topped with a dusting of cilantro, half a hard boiled egg, and what I believe was a liquified sweet potato sauce. \u00a0Holy moly was this awesome. \u00a0It wasn't huge (maybe 3 inches in diameter & 3 inches tall), but remarkably rich and filling. \u00a0I'm not sure what type of potato they used for the potato cakes, but the texture was smoother than any potato I've had (maybe they used extra butter?). \u00a0And there was plenty of crab meat in there to be sure. \u00a0If you're coming here for the first time, get this. \u00a0I'm making it mandatory.After the appetizer, I had no idea what I was doing, so I let the waitress pick the next two items for me. \u00a0For the main entree, she recommended trying one of the ceviches since this was my first time here. \u00a0I went with the Ceviche Mixto since that had a variety of seafood (though admittedly I didn't ask which kinds). \u00a0The seafood is garnished with onions and a spicy lime juice blend (you can get it super spicy, or go with a mild spice level as I did) and comes with sides of sweet potatoes, sweet corn, and cancha (basically dried corn). \u00a0Again, didn't look like a huge portion but they packed in a ton of seafood into this dish. In addition to the fish (which I believe was sea bass) there was lots of shrimp, clams, mussels, calamari, and octopus. \u00a0I'm not a huge fan of squid or octopus so I was a little apprehensive when I saw it, but actually this style tasted quite delicious. \u00a0All of the seafood tasted fresh and the lime sauce had the perfect amount of seasoning. \u00a0There's actually enough food in this dish to be split by two people, which probably explains why I felt pretty full after I finished. \u00a0Nevertheless, the waitress prodded me to try one of their desserts, so she had me try the Alfajor. \u00a0Two round flaky sugar cookies covered in powdered sugar with dulce de leche filling in the middle and chocolate sauce on the side. \u00a0I don't how in the world I had room for this, but I made it happen. \u00a0The dulce de leche was buttery smooth and the cookie cut with a fork. \u00a0An awesome, decadent conclusion. Absolutely incredible meal. \u00a0The presentation, the flavors, and the variety was amazing. \u00a0They actually have a number of chicken and beef dishes to choose from as well, and I'll be sure to try those upon my next visit. \u00a0Total cost for this go around including the drink, appetizer, entree, dessert, tax and tip came to $50. \u00a0Worth every penny as El Chullo's cuisine could easily work as a fine dining experience (though I'm thrilled its just a neighborhood joint that I can wear my flip flops to). \u00a0I now see why Peruvian cuisine is quickly conquering American pallets, and El Chullo is Phoenix's ground zero."], ["Thomas P.", "We got hungry at the perfect time. Driving around and saw this place. It's absolutely amazing. Had the pork tamal peruano, ceviche mixto, and tacu tacu lomo al jugo. \u00a0Everything was so delicious. Best ceviche we've ever had!!

I would give it 5 stars if ratings were based only on the food! Not only does it taste great, it even is presented beautifully.Now, what brings this place down is the location. My biggest gripe is the A/C seems to not always be running cool. Not to mention it isn't the nicest looking of restaurants. For the price I expect a bit more class. Not super fancy, just a touch more.And yes, it's central Phoenix.

Now, don't get me wrong. \u00a0It was a cool experience, but when we got the bill, it was a little much for an appetizer sampler, a drink, one entree, and dessert.

You eat them like potato chips but they are not dry and slightly crispy. The entr\u00e9e was a chicken breast, pan fried in a red pepper vinegar sauce with red onion slices. Very good! There was a small side of potatoes and a rather large pyramid of white rice. I love rice but I prefer it flavored. I almost asked for more red pepper vinegar sauce for the rice. It was similar to Japanese sticky rice. The place was small, clean, nice artwork on the walls, flat screen tv with Fox Spanish channel showing a soccer game. They have a full bar so we ordered a carafe of Sangria- iced, filled with what appeared to be fruit cocktail- very good and pared well with the meal. We ate the wine soaked fruit like a dessert.

Even though there was a long line the cook was really friendly & made everyone's omelet to their specifications. I was also glad they had a huge selection of fruit.Being gluten-free, I did not expect to be able to eat any of the desserts, however it would be a good idea for them to be labeled as they looked great, but you could not really tell what the ingredients were, etc. The house itself does appear to be a bit neglected, but at the same time features a ton of original features.

Since the building is very old, the room we were in was not well insulated and got a little stuffy/warm....so if you're coming here during the Summer months, dress light.After the event, we wandered around the mansion and took a bunch of pics of the artwork and rooms. \u00a0I'm sure there's a story behind all of this, but we were on our own and didn't have a guide to explain anything to us.We picked up a flyer for a social club you can belong to here...? \u00a0Not really sure what that entails, but it's available.Overall, I'd rate this experience 3.5 Stars, but I'm rounding up for the views and Wine.Return Factor - 70%"], ["Cheryl W.", "My girlfriend from outta town suggested we have dinner here last week. The mansion & it's history is what I really loved about it. We walked around and peeked in all the rooms before we ate. Kinda has a spooky vibe- heard it was haunted! Service for dinner was great! The food was just okay, I had the Filet and it was just so-so. I would not order a steak there again. We decided to indulge in caviar- pricey but yummy! We sat outside and the views were amazing. We even saw fireworks coming from a baseball game ?I will be back for Sunday Brunch- heard that's their specialty! Bottomless mimosas & lots of seafood ! I'll update once I am able to go!"], ["Pepper T.", "I suddenly knew this was a mistake as soon as we started to scale the steep difficult steps and the handrail covered with a large amount of bird POOP. My stomach turned and I couldn't imagine why they don't have somebody to clean the handrail.We were a few minutes early for our reservation so we walked around a bit. It is an interesting OLD House with narrow hallways and a small room with an old fashioned operators switchboard. It does have beautiful views. The house has a beautiful entrance door and interesting intricate ceilings but over all it really isn't so grand with old worn carpet and common tiles. I thought I'd see a bunch of marble or granite but I didn't.We thought this was an interesting Choice for restaurant week because we wanted to see this place. Also this was one of the few places that gave you three courses without dessert. Also the $10 non member fee was waived for restaurant week.I can't say the food was completely awful but I wouldn't come back for it either even for free so I think that qualifies for the one star rating.We asked about cocktails and our waiter said they were the last page of the wine menu but they weren't and only lasted the liquors. He returned and my husband asked for the cocktail menu we saw outside and the waiter brings us the cocktail menu. I decided on a drink but the waiter didn't return for a long period of time so we decided to just order dinner and skip the cocktails.Our waiter said the Sous Vide Chicken was stuffed with something green and he didn't know what it was but to him it was very salty. He also said the Carpaccio wasn't very good. So we decided to go with the other two starters.The starters were passable but nothing either of us would want again. A not so great crab cake sitting on creamy peas with two refrigerated cold roasted tomatoes. The other was a few slices of eggplant with a little cheese.The middle plates were not so seasoned escargots with a forgettable salad. The highlight was a small chunk of gorgonzola cheese. The other middle plate was not hot and not cold but unhealthy room temperature tomato soup with a over whipped cream laced with truffle aroma. (Aroma means perfume) (and over whipped means turned to butter). We both thought the tomato soup was the best of what we tried here. It tasted like good tomatoes that would be great on a pizza.For dinner we tried the duck and the bronzini. Both were cooked just OK but neither seemed to have good seasoning or flavor however both of our vegetables were salted too heavy. I'd say so heavy I could tell what kind of salt they used and it wasn't good salt. The one thing that I could honestly say WAS terrible was the artichoke , anise sabayon. I tasted it and nearly barffed. I am without words to describe how it tasted but the texture was like hummus. Both plates had what they called polenta towers. They looked (see photo) happy to see us and I thought mine might squirt something when I went to eat it. But I was baffled when I tasted it because it wasn't like polenta. It was like corn muffin mix that was mixed with a farina kind of cereal. It was bready and lacked much of the corn taste and really tasted like cream of wheat cereal.I can almost say forgettable but I can't because I will never forget the bird poop or the polenta tower.1.5 stars almost 2 stars but with price factored in I feel one starSLIGHT UPDATE 9-11-13I read that they got a new chef since my review so hopefully they are better now."], ["Ginger B.", "I visited the Wrigley Mansion with my daughters to have lunch and celebrate their birthdays. We had just joined the Club for the very reasonable price of $15 annual, and as a member received free valet parking. The valet was a pleasant and professional young man, who opened our doors, provided a valet ticket, and directed us to the entrance. Once inside we were promptly greeted and brought to Geordie's for lunch at a lovely window table with a great view. Debby, the manager, waited on us. I informed her it was my daughter's birthday today, and my other daughter's birthday was yesterday, 17 years apart. We ordered beverages and a margherita pizza to share, and would order something more later, if needed. The pizza was amazing, with plenty of mozzarella, slices of heirloom tomatoes, basil and sauce on a wonderful crust. My youngest said it was the best pizza she had ever eaten! (and she's had Pizzeria Bianco several times!) We ate only half the pizza and wanted to take the rest to go. Debby was very professional yet also fun and personable. To our surprise, she brought out a slice of chocolate cake with Happy Birthday beautifully written on the large white plate. The girls were thrilled, blowing out the candle together. After our wonderful meal and time spent at Geordie's, we enjoyed walking around the museum like mansion. Many of the ceilings are beautifully elaborate and colorful, and the views of the city are fantastic.Visiting the Wrigley Mansion was definitely a highlight to our special day together!"], ["Shaina K.", "Visited for AZ restaurant week. It was evident that the service is highly diminished when you aren't there for their regular dinner service or perhaps when you're a good twenty years younger than their typical patronage. The table behind us received outstanding service. Our server was curt and mostly ignored us. This was after they switched our server with no notification. One minute we had a one server and the next a different one appeared (this was after we said we were there for restaurant week) No refills offered for water or second round of drinks. Waited far too long for the check. Servers, bartenders, and managers displayed unprofessional behavior throughout. Food was basic quality (I would expect more given their pricing). Chicken and steak we ordered were dry, salad was nothing special. Flourless chocolate cake was dry. Plus $6 fee for valet? Far nicer restaurants in Phoenix offer valet for free. This place is not worth the time or money. Won't be returning or referring."], ["Holly R.", "Oh, Wrigley Manson if only I had the means to fix you up and make you the amazing gem I know you could be.Phoenix is seriously lacking when it comes to historical buildings and homes. I have always been curious about the Wrigley Mansion so I was excited when we made plans to go here for Easter brunch. The brunch was good. Our server was friendly and funny. There was a decent variety of food and it was tasty. My only complaint about the food would be the desserts. They were not labeled, the cakes and pies were whole so people cut their own slices and they became a mess. Overall I just wasn't impressed. I've seen better dessert spreads at casino buffets. After the meal we wandered around the building, exploring the rooms, peeking around corners and checking out the history. The bummer is that it's obvious that the money isn't there to keep this place looking its best. Some of the bathrooms were run down (burned out lights, doors that didn't lock), in one room the curtains were torn, walls and flooring showed signs of wear and tear, and furnishings just looked tired in places. It wouldn't take much to clean this place up and have it look amazing. I'm sure when the Wrigley family lived here it was incredible and it's sad to see such a great home being neglected. I'm sure if they fixed it up they would book more parties and weddings and it could be a prime location in town. I hope someone will take the time and money to invest in one of our rare glimpses into Phoenix's past. If it continues on this decline I don't think it will last."], ["Amy C.", "I ate here this morning for brunch with my husband. \u00a0The building and grounds are beautiful, but the food was disappointing. \u00a0It was more like a fancy continental hotel breakfast, and definitely not worth $50 a person. \u00a0There were even store bought yogurts and pastries. The worst part of our experience was when we were leaving the mansion, a large group of African Americans had just arrived and we actually heard a waiter mock them saying, \"we've got fried chicken and collard green but where's the kool-aid?!\" \u00a0That was horrifyingly rude and summed up our experience that the building is the only classy part of this establishment."], ["Patricia O.", "This was my first time at the Wrigley\"s Mansion but definitely not my last.

There's live music (not sure if it's every day, but lucky it was going on at dinner time) and the musicians are so talented.Food: The Travelzoo voucher is probably the best bang for your buck.

He saw it on groupon and did the research on Yelp and we ended up going as a group of 6. First off, their happy hour looks worth it in itself, but the dinner and drink menu is great.They are very tucked away, so it took us one time circling to find it. I liked this aspect of it because when you do find it, its quiet from the road and it makes for a really cute patio.We started with drinks - mom got the prickly pear mojito, dad got the blood orange (everyone's favorite), sister got the white sangria, boyfriend had a margarita, and little sisters boyfriend got a regular mojito (I was boring with white wine). All of the drinks were good and strong.Boyfriend had the short rib for dinner and man was that good! Dad and little sisters boyfriend had the pernil asado, which aside from the short rib was everyone's favorite. The flavor was slightly smokey with an all spice or cinnamon after taste which was just delicious. Little sister had the special of the night which was a sea food risotto (odd for a Mexican restaurant but no one will complain about some good fusion). Mom had the seafood chile relleno and loved it and I went with the chicken. Everything was delicious but I think I would go back for the short rib or pernil asada for sure. All of the sides were great, green beans, creamed corn, cornbread, carrots - YUM.What I loved was the happy service along with the great food.

They do a good job just don't have high standards/expectations. Food: empanadas, chicken tacos and tostadas. The two chicken dishes looked a like but it seemed like the tostadas were spicier and with smokiness, maybe chipotle. Anyway the apps were delicious and filling. Drink: spicy margarita, Moscow mule, and NOT YOUR MOTHERS margarita. I cap the latter because it was awesome. Don't be fooled by the Amber color from the agave nectar this is a solid refreshing libation.

Put a bit of hot cheesy pupusa, with some extra beans and a huge pile of curtido and it is heavnely. We *think* it is gluten free although the addition of rice flour based pupusas on the menu has confused us greatly. My hubby who can't do gluten always feels fine though after the regular ones.

The decor is basic but authentic, and while you definitely get the hole-in-the-wall vibe, it's not at all in a negative sense. The place is clean well kept, but it's also bare bones and very much down to earth, with very few frills. One clearly comes here for the food and not much else, but there's nothing inherently wrong with that! As for the food itself, we sampled a wide variety on our visit and everything was fantastic. We started out with the appetizer sampler and from the tamale to the yucca to the bits of pork and the pupusas, all of it was absolutely delicious. For entrees, I tried the tres pupusas combo, while my fellow diners went with the beef tongue and the fried tilapia. The pupusas were beef, chicken and cheese, and all three were every bit as good as they looked, freshly made with lots of flavor. My friends rated the tongue and tilapia very highly, and several of them ended up taking food back home with them, which I always consider a good sign.

We both had house salads with blue cheese dressing- I think you can tell a lot about the quality of a place by their salads. They used fresh field greens, the tomatoes were perfect and sweet, and even the thinly sliced onions were sweet and delicious. The blue cheese dressing was fantastic, and had actual chunks of blue cheese. I was impressed, for a hotel restaurant. For our entrees, I had the hickory smoked baby back ribs (good, but not phenomenal) and husband ordered the chorizo chicken- I am so glad he shared a bite with me, because it was awesome. I was really wishing I'd gotten that instead of the ribs. Oh, and I especially wanted to mention the asparagus that came with my ribs- tender, cooked just right, and flavorful. This place uses quality ingredients.If it wasn't so out of the way, we would definitely come by regularly. My husband was especially enticed by the prime rib melt sandwich, so I think we'll be back during lunch in the near future.

The restaurant is inside the lobby of the sheraton and is open, so you can see anyone just walking around the hotel. We had dinner at 9:30pm so was not too much traffic but there was an entertainer convention going on, so was very noisy and then when they had an intermisssion we got to see some interesting looking people. It was a lil bit of some nice entertainment. I could see how that could be annoying with all the background noise. First off we started with some cocktails, I had the orange margarita with sugar on the rim, was delicious, and Javier had the house special Fire and spice, it tasted just like a classic margarita (nothing special). Appetizer: we shared the Gambas al fuego. So for $10.00 you get 4 shrimps, (they were delicious) but for $10.00 I expect a lil bit more food. It wasn't even the jumbo shrimp, just normal size. Besides the price and quantity, this dish was delicious. It had a mango salsa that was sooooo good. It had jicama, mango, red bell pepper, cilantro, chile and lime. I think i will try to recreate this at home. So Im glad this is the appetizer we chose, but I will not be getting it again just because of the portion. On a side note, they give you a basket of bread, which is actually soft pretzel sticks. and you get 3 condiments to dip it into.Oil (which I think needed some spices for more flavor), jalepno jelly (ya I know, but surprisingly good), and a sweet/nutty butter. \u00a0For the main course: I got the chorizo chicken (chicken stuffed with chorizo and cheese) with a chipotle sauce on top, it came wth ranchero beans( i didnt like these, but thats just my preference, I enjoy more authentic tasting beans) and jalepeno cheese rice, (this was very good, and the cheese dishes are made with white cheddar). Javier had the bbq short ribs (he loved these) and came with jalepeno mac n cheese( this was extra cheesey) , but very good. And finally I ordered dessert, creme brulee. Now I may not be the person to ask because this is my all time favorite dessert, but I have definaltly had better. There was nothing special to it. But I couldnt leave with out trying it.

Wish they had Coke as I hate Pepsi and all you can get in the hotel including the vending machines is Pepsi. Next meal I had was a dinner the next night. Ordered chicken enchiladas and they were just fine along with 2 beers that were a bit overpriced. Last night there I had dinner. Ordered the 8 oz fillet and it was made to perfection. Overall, very good service with the exception of the slip in of the Pepsi for the water the first day. Alcohol is a bit steep in price, but food is moderately priced for the amount you get, so overall, they get 4 stars. Very good, but not excellent.

I mean, these are dangerously delicious. The coarse-ground mustard is also to die for. Next, the Dragon salad is really tasty. I've rarely encountered dragon fruit in American cuisine, and it's very interesting and totally worth the feature.

But worst of all, the prices on the check were higher than the prices on the menu. I was going to say something, but it took so long for the server to get back to us that I decided not to bother. On second thought, I checked a menu on the way out and confirmed that the prices for the entrees were $1 higher on the check than on the menu.

However, it was the temperature of a meat locker so any cozy feelings brought on by low mood lighting are quickly dissolved into violent body shivers.

We ordered the Cuban Cigars as appetizer, followed by Lemony Chicken and the Supatra salad. The Cuban Cigars were dry and without flavor, unless you count dripping grease as \"flavor\" Without the dip, they would have been hopeless. The Lemony Chicken was salty, and the potatoes were burned to a crisp. You can't truly mess up salad...or so I thought. Not only was the combination of flavor strange, the actual lettuce has an overpowering chlorine smell that reminded me of my swimming pool...or impending death. In my desire to survive the night, I had a couple of brave bites and tried my best to wash the flavor down with my overpriced glass of wine.

The food was deliciousCourse one was the lettuce wraps, simply divine, one of the best things I have eaten in a long time. 5 stars by itself. The Chicken over veggies was my second course. The chicken was tender, the veggies delicious, even the mash potatoes were good \u00a0(They are hidden under the chicken). \u00a0I give it a 4.5 StarsThe third course was dessert. The churros with ice cream was good. Though I did feel like it could have used more syrup other than what was drizzled on the plate. 4 Stars All in all 4.5 Stars rounded up to 5 Stars because of great service.

A place where you don't go for food, but good company and tasty beverages. \u00a0...and a drag show (if that's your thing).## the scrambled egg special with jalape\u00f1os and peppers was dead and overlooked.

Stop trying so hard, just get good at a few things and let the booze do the rest. # water glass chipped# bits of dried food on the silverware# gents' door sticky enough that somebody might think it's occupied# seating upholstery is worn, cracked and tattered# wall to wall kitsch not dusted recently# staff congregates at the host stand chatting and leaningI'm not supposed to care because you don't. \u00a0But I do. It means you don't care about my food. And it shows. ## open face tamale is not a tamale, it's a hot mess. Stop calling that mushy pile of barely-cooked masa a tamale. # queso sauce is a wet mess (I'm always wary when the menu has to change languages from English to convey the description). Glad I asked for it to be left off. # nothing made to order. It's just a lazy kitchen with squirt bottles and chafing dishes doing nothing well. MEH!!What a shame.

The place was nearly empty.While the general atmosphere was good, it was clear that housekeeping standards were not up to par. It wasn't dirty per se but for a restaurant you don't want to see a \u00a0previous patron's meal (crumbs here and there) in the booth cracks. It was obvious that it was \"cleaned\" too quickly. More like swiped. Now I don't know if the young man who served us was a waiter or busboy or some guy off the street because he never gave us his name. Although he was pleasant he appeared to be new. He was still knowledgeable and attentive. He got our drink and appetizer order then served it. \u00a0He mentioned that he didn't know where our waitress was and said he'd \u00a0go ahead and get our order. The appetizer was very good (shrimp cerviche?). Our meal came in a relatively timely manner and was pretty good with the exception of the \"Uncle Ben's\" styled Spanish rice. It quickly became evident that while the entrees were very good, someone in management decided to cut corners with the sides. Overall it was okay. A bit overpriced for lunch but still okay. Now i'm not too familiar with the Phoenix area so my daughter and I didn't know about other restaurant options nearby but it was a generally good experience. I'm taking a star off for lack of cleanliness and another for the waitress confusion. Yeah I'd eat there again."], ["Ryan N.", "Really enjoyed this latin fare locale. \u00a0Tacos were tasty.

I understand the new fab these days with accepting people for who they are and I have nothing against cross dressers but it doesn't make me feel comfortable for me walking into the girls bathroom and me trying to use the bathroom when technically there is men in there with me.

It's not so much of a case of anything in particular being overwhelmingly good, as it is NOTHING being bad. For some reason, it all just really seems to work for me lol. Food is always good, great happy hour, very friendly service. Bartender is great. I was there most recently late Saturday night and the bartender talked me out of \u00a0ordering \u00a0something as this particular dish had some negative feedback a little bit earlier in the night. I was very appreciative of that and the overall genuine friendliness in the service.Food: very good, nice range of options. Love the lettuce wraps Drinks: the cocktails aren't necessarily my thing, but can't knock them because I'm sure they work for a lot of people. Just keep the beer cold and I'll be just fine.

We did have two appetizers, the lettuce wraps, which were better than PF Changs (and I love those), and the guacammus. I eat hummus all the time, and this was good, but the lettuce wraps won. My wife had the chimichanga, which was a lot of tasty food. However, one of us in our party had the blue corn enchiladas, which might have been the favorite of the group. However, I had the pork chile verde enchiladas, which I claim was the best during our four person taste testing. We did sample the pork verde mac and cheese, which was tasty if you like mac and cheese, which I don't. Even though we were stuffed after licking our plates clean, we indulged in the peach cobbler (yes, don't even hesitate, just order it, you will not be sorry). The daughter and her hubby had the empanadas, which they loved! My taste buds definitely favored the peach cobbler, however. We did come during the early happy hour and the waiter was looking after us, making sure we knew when happy hour was ending to take advantage of the specials.Definitely a place to return to. Highly recommended."], ["mark g.", "We actually ventured into town searching for a new and exciting dining experience and we're delighted by ticoz \u00a0our wait person was professional \u00a0and efficient, I had the Mexican Benedict which I found delectable my wife had the huevous rancheros which was also very good the only thing was the eggs were not done as my wife had requested when she brought it to our wait persons attention she did offer my wife a new egg but my wife said it was ok as is. I thought maybe a bit of a comp on our bill might have been a nice gesture none the less we will certainly return for more, oh did I mention 2.99 bloody Mary's"], ["Joe E.", "Good beer selection and good prices at happy hour.

I had the Pork Adovada, Tinga Chicken, Carne Asada, and Dos Equis Battered Tilapia. Service was great. The chicken and fish tacos were awesome. The pork was good. The beef was so so, the meat was chewy and not as tasty as the other three tacos. The waiter did not ask if I preferred flour or corn tortillas, and I forgot to specify so I got stuck with flour. I'm sure my tacos would have been better with corn. Good spot to try out."], ["Jodi O.", "Well a friend told me about this place and I wanted to try it.

I ordered theBlue Corn Enchiladas with chicken OMGI can't tell you how awesome our meals were. Margie and I shared our plates so we can each try them.

It has chicken, fruit, and pumpkin seeds, so yummy! The rest of the food is so-so. Maybe it's just the plates that I have ordered so far are not so tasty...I don't know. It's not that what I have ordered isn't well put together or not cooked well, it's just, well, bland. The drinks, as other reviewers have commented, are great. I love the sangria.I also feel like they need to update the place. I can see how the place may have looked great 5+ years ago, but now it looks a bit outdated. I can tell some of their furniture/d\u00e9cor is straight out of Ikea. The material on many of their chairs is worn down or ripped. It's time.Overall, their drinks are great, their apps are yummy. While there were good things about the few times I've been here, I probably wouldn't go back unless I heard that there's been changes or updates."], ["Angelica C.", "This is one of my favorite Happy Hour spots! They have some great drink selections here and the vibe is just a feel good vibe.The menu is pretty good. They used to have a variety of salsas that I no longer see on the menu which makes me sad but is definitely not a deal breaker. The street tacos are hit or miss.

Finally, 30 minutes later I ended up just talking to the waitress. I told her we needed additional items and that I was happy to pay regular menu price for the additional items no problem. \u00a0Well I guess she was put out by having extra people to serve and was smacking her lips, not refilling drinks and was throwing - yes literally tossing down plates of food - at our guests. then she stood up in front of the entire room and read off how much our final check was.

They have a great happy hour every day of the week with different drink and food specials. I adore their Blackberry Mojito and their Coconut Margarita. Also, their Guacamus is my favorite appetizer. I could eat it any time of the day. Normally we order the Grilled Burrito and have them do a split plate. Sure, there's an extra $2 charge, but it is totally worth it. The husband and I each receive our own burrito (slightly smaller than the normal sized burrito, which is huge) and our own coleslaw. It is still a lot of food, but so good. We've had a few desserts here, but nothing special. All of the staff is super nice and utterly kind. We have always been seated promptly and served quickly. Even when we do take out, the service is impeccable. The inside is hip and modern with a relaxed feel and the patio is great.

We had dinner on a Wednesday night and it was terribly disappointing. The atmosphere is dark and dated. The food is bland across the board. Nachos were ample in size but lacking in flavor. The high point of the meal was the Chile lime Caesar dressing on the salad. It was great. The signature pork Chili Verde Mac and cheese was terrible. The pasta was overcooked. The cheese had no flavor. They must have ran out of green chili's because there was zero kick.
