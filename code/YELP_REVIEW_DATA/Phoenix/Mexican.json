I met her in the city after cocktails with friends. I was blindsided...I had no idea she would just randomly come into my life like that, but it happened. She's on the petite side, and puts herself together a little nicer than most girls around that part of town. The moment we connected though, I knew she was far from hollow. In fact, she was one of the most down-to-earth, simple, yet complex, ladies I've met in a long time who is filled to the brim with good things, and she's not the type of lady just looking for your money. When we kissed, time stopped, and in that moment I knew true bliss...and needed a napkin.She's a mini quesadilla, and for $2, she's more than worth venturing to Yaquis, one of Phoenix's legit late-night grub spots, for. I always used to get the tacos, but this time I went with a gut feeling, and it paid off! No longer will I be held down by my self-bestowed shackles! No longer will I preach that the tacos are king, and that they're the only food that matters at Yaquis!

The line sometimes can get long."], ["Brett B.", "Wow. By FAR the best taqueria tacos that I have yet had in Phoenix!Amazing find - I just ate there tonight and I am still dreaming of the delicate and perfectly cooked homemade tortillas used for the mini Carne Asada Quesdilla that I practically inhaled!. I almost missed ordering these \"mini size\" Quesadilla bad boys but saw a plate of these delicate morsels at a nearby table and I added them to the taco order.OMG were they good. Sorry to gush, but each bite was pure bliss. Without a doubt - unequivocally - these are some of the best tacos and quesadillas that I have ever eaten. The place is a kind of hole in the wall with a small parking lot up front. You know you are in for an amazing food experience by three dead giveaways: \u00a01) The massively long and slow line out front on a Sunday night (at least 30 min before being able to order - worth every minute!). 2) The sight and sound \u00a0of the cooks freshly chopping away at the tender Carne Asada on the block continuously - no pre-made dried out beef here. This is the tender melt in your mouth Asada of your dreams \u00a03) The happy people eating at the tables nearbyPrices here are dirt cheap - Only $1.00 per taco, and about $2.00 for each mini Quesadilla. Our family of 3 filled up our hungry tummies for less than $20 including drinks.Tacos were superb with a bit of cabbage, some spicy and flavorful homemade red salsa and a dab of salsa style guac. The tortillas are fresh, and extremely tasty. The only place I've ever had Taqueria tacos as good as this was in Mexico many years ago. The opening hours of this place are a little strange right? \u00a0Open only Thursday through Sunday, mostly nights and late nights. No lunch possibility sadly. This must be related to opening at hours coinciding with the Charlie's bar just behind to feed the happily inebriated with some of the best munchies in the city lol. \u00a0Taqueria Los Yaquis is now on my radar as a standout for delicious cheap eats - one of Phoenix's true gems - \u00a0some of the best tacos that this town has to offer. Yes, the tacos are exceptional but don't miss the \"mini\" Carne Asada Quesadillas ($2.00 each) as they are the big O."], ["Anthony N.", "Wasn't blown away as suggested by some reviews, but pretty good tacos for the cheap price. \u00a0But they are not the best I've ever had and the service is very slow. I didn't think the line was too long and was surprised to find myself still in line 15 minutes later. Disappointed to see only carne asada or chicken choices. The tacos were a great size for a late night snack. I found the mini quesadillas to be too salty, although it did have a nice crisp. \u00a0The salsa roja had a nice spicy kick. \u00a0The horchata was too creamy and sweet. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back. But if I were in the area and had the nighttime munchies, it'd be better than a 24 hr fast food joint.

After a night out at Charlies, we discovered this place that is basically attached to the bar (which is an awesome concept).Originally, I did not order anything because I was not that hungry, but after having a bite of my friends chicken burrito, I immediately changed my mind.Normally, burritos that you get from food trucks are a lot of beans and rice with some chunks of chicken mixed in. However, the burritos from this place are around 95% meat, which provides for a very filling and tasty meal.Overall, I was very shocked at the great seasoning and flavorful taste of the food here and would definitely recommend it, drunk or otherwise."], ["Jennifer M.", "Best tacos ever!

Good salsa! Good food! The long lines at 2am are definitely worth it."]], "PHX Burrito House": [["Amanda L.", "I'm writing this review from the standpoint of someone who thinks Chipoltle is overrated when it comes to big,tasty burritos, because PHX Burrito House takes the cake.I seriously don't know why any Phoenician would ever ever ever set foot in a Chipoltle when they could go here. One, it's local. Two, it has the same options as Chipoltle (rice/beans/meat/etc) and is ten MILLION times more delicious. The carne asada falls apart in your mouth and is seasoned very well. The carnitas are amazing, and one burrito was seriously the size of my face. When I dined in, I got complimentary chips and salsa and they were delicious.Service is probably the only difference when comparing to Chipoltle. PHX Burrito House cooks up your food and brings it out to you, thus meaning it takes a little bit longer, but it's fresher. The wait can easily be avoided by calling ahead and placing a to-go order if you're in a lunch rush. So next time you're craving a giant, meaty (or beany or veggie) burrito, skip the national chain and go to PHX Burrito House. You will not be disappointed."], ["Jennifer S.", "Entirely different experience than June's meal with my family at this restaurant. \u00a0We were the only people seated in the restaurant and it was clear the take out customers who arrived after our order was placed took priority. \u00a0I regretted adding gratuity on prior to receiving our order. \u00a0After what seemed like a long wait for a two burritos, I bit into my shrimp burrito only to taste the cabbage and hot sauce. \u00a0The shrimp were fairly well distributed further down but the guacamole was isolated to one bite somewhere around the middle. The tortilla itself was one of the best I've had but who was constructing the burritos last night??My horchata was just meh. \u00a0Mostly ice and the guy had to be reminded to bring it all.I like the location close to our home and the fact that it is a small family restaurant. \u00a0It is clean with nice decor and a good menu but with so many other options in the area, after last night, I doubt I'll be back."], ["Anthony P.", "Inexcusable slow takeout service, time and time again. It is insane that it could take 40 minutes to get a burrito and quesadilla. Keep in mind all three times I was there it was 7:30pm or later, and was slow. There is a serious kitchen issue at this place. 2/3 times the food was very good so I tried to overlook how gotdamned slow the place is, but tonight was slow and poor quality- and like my boys Hall & Oates- I can't go for that.

Was full of cabbage, a bit dry and not too flavorful. 2nd attempt was the Carne Asada Burrito. Much better! I had mine with pinto beans, guac and sour cream.

It was so overfilled with rice that I couldn't taste anything else. My coworkers fish tacos tasted of pure fried oil. So gross. The food took FOREVER to come out.

They certainly weren't packed but there were a lot of tables (3 out of 5 seated, 4 open) waiting for their food. I ordered a shrimp burrito to go ($8.50). It had shrimp, cabbage, pico, lemon juice, hot sauce, and avocado. I couldn't find the avocado and hardly any pico (see pic). Shrimps were good and I'm glad they threw in some additional hot sauces (and chips due to the wait) to help out the flavor on the burrito. I'd say their issue is turning food. If they were full, you'd be waiting 20 minutes for a three minute \"Chipotle\" type burrito. Lady behind the counter was very nice. Worth the try if you're in the neighborhood."], ["Connie L.", "Delicious thin flour tortilla. Carne asada can be more marinated. Green chili pork chunks were tender.

This place smells so freaking good! Like, for once, I've stumbled in a place that was both hip AND authentic AND tastes great. It's small and humble, with prices on par with Chipotle, so I expect something great. I went with a green chili (pork) burrito with black beans. I can say that while the beans & rice are good, the main attraction falls flat. It's not spicy. It's barely flavorful! what a letdown. I found myself dousing it with the green habanero sauce featured at the table. Oh yeah, don't expect any sort of complimentary salsa bar. Salsa (and chips) will cost you a bit extra, and if you're going to shell out the $3, you might as well just drop the same amount for a better burrito + chips + salsa combo at a place like La Santisima...or even Qdoba. This is me dropping stars because of superior, accessible places in the same area at the same price point.

At the end it was a soggy mess. As for the chicken I was able to take out and actually taste it was juicy and flavorful. Tortilla was a tad bit thin but didn't bother me cause I'm not particular to thick or think flour tortillas.For what you're purchasing this place gets a 4 out of 5 stars & for the ambiance of the restaurant I give them a 2 star rating.

Food had good flavors and definitely had its own \"style\" and flare. \u00a0I had the pasta dish and my wife had the Mahi Mahi fish tacos. Not traditional Mexican and wish they had some chips and salsa but a great experience over all."], ["Marc C.", "Went here for Lunch for the 1st time, with a group of people from work, & was thoroughly impressed! \u00a0The decor is very nice, but the food was truly unique & delicious! I would like to come here for dinner sometime. \u00a0:)"], ["Kerry M.", "I have to admit, I had driven by Sierra Bonita about a million times before finally being formally introduced to their delicious menu. I had no clue this little gem of a place was hidden here. In fact, I seriously thought it was going to be some kind of cheesy, chain restaurant. No no, my friends, it is not. In fact, this is much more of an upscale restaurant than I would typically visit. Which is exactly why I always sit in the bar and order from the appetizer section of the menu. And oh my, there are so many delicious options just in that little section. However, my favorite by far has got to be their mac and cheese. It is definitely not your traditional, American mac and cheese...but the green chiles and unique pasta make it so very tasty. I find that it's plenty of food for a main course (and much more affordable too!). If you're looking for other less expensive options, the queso and guacamole are great too. The adult beverages are always good, but they do seem a bit overpriced. Overall though, I think it's Sierra Bonita's atmosphere that keeps bringing me back. It offers a lot of variety: from dark and sexy, to comfy bar tops, to a cozy patio that exudes ambiance. It's definitely different from your typical Phoenix restaurant which is a big lure. The only drawbacks to this place? The service is questionable and the price is rather steep. I've been here four or five times now and I've mostly been served by unfriendly, snooty characters. I'm not sure what the deal is with that. Maybe because I'm too busy trying to save money and prefer to order appetizers. Is there a secret monetary amount that's supposed to be spent when you dine here? Or maybe it's just a too-cool-for-school vibe. Either way, I do not enjoy a server who isn't polite. Take your attitude elsewhere buddy. All in all, Sierra Bonita is a great, local restaurant. It's a nice place for happy hour or a date night out. Enjoy!"], ["Cindy J.", "I love SB. \u00a0I eat there at least once a week and find that the menu has a good variety. \u00a0I like the daily menu with different seafood items. \u00a0Jessica is the best!!"], ["P K.", "Great restaurant. The service was impeccable. Fron the hostess to Jose, our waiter and everyone in between they made sure we had everything we needed. The food was delicious and plenty. Will be back."], ["Amy H.", "I cannot put into words how impressed I was with Sierra Bonita! Absolutely everything about this place is epic! We went in on a Saturday night and were seated almost immediately which was a relief since it's such a busy night for restaurants. Our waiter promptly came over to our table and was super polite, well-spoken, and knew the entire menu off of memory. My husband and I brought another couple with us and we all had different dishes. We all tried each other's and were in food heaven. Everything was perfection. I had the buttermilk chicken which is one of their most popular items. It has a bit of a kick to it so be for warned. The sweet potatoes are the icing on the cake for this dish. Another if us had the carne asada and it was too notch quality meat! It burst with flavor. We always enjoyed their black tea and some wine. The prices are fantastic for the quality you get here. The ambiance is candles and soft lighting with light background music. The wood decor throughout the restaurant finishes setting the scene and makes you feel at home and comfortable. I recommend geting the smaller portions being that it's still a lot of food! I can't wait to go back here ago. And bring new friends! It is a MUST go!!"], ["Jonathan Z.", "A highly recommended restaurant from separate concierges at the Hilton Pointe Squaw Peak Resort. To their reco's, the Sierra Bonita did not disappoint. I really enjoyed the bacon covered shrimp and I loved the buttermilk chicken with asparagus. \u00a0I was pleasantly surprised when our waitress brought a complimentary 's'mores' dessert for my colleague who was celebrating his birthday that night.Our waitress was ultra-sweet and fun; despite telling us we were welcome to stay as late as she wanted, we could tell when the chairs were on the tables and the lights were being turned off that our time there was coming to an end."], ["Elizabeth P.", "I hosted a small baby shower brunch in their downstairs room. Everything was perfect. I made arrangements with Tony who was super professional and accommodating. Every staff member from the host to our server and bartender was friendly and helpful. The food was amazing and the atmosphere perfection. This restaurant is a small gem of Phoenix and I can't wait to go back!"], ["Gwynne S.", "My family and I have been eating at Sierra Bonita since they first opened. They keep getting better. One primary differentiator I can point out about this place is that they do not skimp on the veggies. A lot of the time, eating out means carbs with a side-o-carbs, featuring one protein ingredient and maybe some cheese. They don't just do vegetables as an afterthought, they use delicious and unusual ones. Their mix has green and purple romanesco, rainbow carrots, broccoli, squash, green beans, spinach and usually sauteed with butter and rosemary. Sometimes choyote is in the mix too - at brunch, order Cowboy Hash.And then all too often, at other places beans are \"just beans\" and don't have much flavor (or my least favorite, are honey-like and sugary). Sierra Bonita's beans are totally rich and flavorful, they're whole beans, not refried and are super savory, elevated far above the ordinary \"side of beans.\"They have a Moscow Mule that comes in a copper cup and tastes super refreshing in the summertime (plus you can rest the cup on the inside of your wrists to cool down from your drive there). I love their Southwestern Cobb salad for lunch. Their Carne Asada is super filling, even the half-size. Same goes for the Buttermilk Chicken, and it's nice to get mashed sweet potatoes instead of just mashed potatoes. Lots of good, rich flavors and intensity here.They have a new dinner appetizer, butter-braised mushrooms. OMG these are to die for. There's gorgonzola cheese in there, and maybe a little bit of heaven. I've had the Albondigas soup, the green chile posole and the Azteca soup and they're all rich and deliciously filling. Then the most out-there sounding dinner entree: chocolate and espresso-rubbed pork tenderloin. It says all this but the taste that pops out the most is the vanilla. It's like Holy Crap, how did anyone think this up and how does it actually work so well?Gah ... I just ate there for dinner and writing all this makes me hungry all over again.They just added salmon tacos to their menu. Totally heart-healthy, what a good excuse to go. Super juicy and delicious. Everyone who works there is nice and relaxed and a lot of them have been there for years. Happy hour is fun. There are always people from the neighborhood there and their jalapeno poppers are super delicious - not fried with ranch dressing like a pub would have. Their jalapenos are sliced and filled with seriously flavorful cheese and served on a skillet with a tomato wedge sizzling in between each pepper.I could go on, but if you do a ctrl-f search on my review for the word \"super\" you'll find a word count that's high enough to show what I think of this place."], ["Matt A.", "If you come inside you think they must specialize in fancy street tacos or fajitas, but I am telling you that the absolute best thing on the menu is the Buttermilk Chicken. Fried Chicken, mashed sweet potatoes, and a pepper-y gravy. I would say that it tastes like Thanksgiving but I've never had anything that good on Thanksgiving before. That is the dish that keeps me coming back and back again."], ["Kristina B.", "The food was excellent! Great venue, and clean. Exceptional service, will definitely return!"]], "Comedor Guadalajara": [], "Dick's Hideaway": [], "Mariscos Playa Hermosa": [["Belinda R.", "Im here on a business trip from California and default to Yelp as hunger savior. I found Mariscos Playa Hermosa based off my location and yelp reviews. I walked in and there were only 4 other people eating, \u00a0then again it was only 6pm. I was greeted by a friendly gal.I picked my own seat and immediately was offered a drink. \u00a0I got agua de \u00a0Jamaica which was perfect not too sweet. I was brought chips and salsa a few minutes later. There were 2 salsas, an avocado salsa and a red salsa. The avocado one was perfect, \u00a0the red was great but OH EM GEE my mouth was on fire. I love hot sauce, but this for sure was blazing! I really wanted shrimp and asked for recommendations. \u00a0I was recommended the bacon wrapped shrimp but decided not too because I'd feel guilty of it being too fatty. I then was recommended the A ala diabla shrimp. I usually love spicy shrimp, but at this point my mouth was on fire from the salsa.....sooo i got it anyway. Why not?  My plate arrived with about 6 shrimp and tons of sauce with rice beans and sode salad. \u00a0The beans and rice were great, but holy moly the shrimp were BLAZING SPICY holy moly. They were still good.Overall, the service and food was great. I will def come back on my next visit."], ["Mark C.", "Whenever a friend or out of towner asks me where they can find the best Mexican food in the valley, my answer is always the same. \u00a0The more questionable the neighborhood, the better. \u00a0That's by no means an exact science (nor meant to be demeaning to the neighborhoods for which many of these establishments undoubtedly take great pride). \u00a0But with apologies to the numerous suburban Mexican food establishments that dot the valley landscape, the working class Hispanic neighborhoods of inner city Phoenix are where I've always found the best Mexican grub. \u00a0When I told my Dad I wanted to try this place and where it was, he hesitated a bit thinking we were driving into a death trap. \u00a0Fortunately my food adventurist side convinced him to make the trip with me to try this place for the first time. \u00a0And oh, what a place.I first found out about Maria Maldonado's creation on a segment of the wildly popular PBS show Check Please Arizona (you can watch it on YouTube right now). \u00a0From the onset, you could tell this wasn't your typical Mexican establishment. \u00a0While they have all the usual Mexican staples you'd expect (burritos, tacos, fajitas, etc.), the emphasis here is decidedly on seafood. \u00a0But even the meat dishes here are completely unique to the valley (more on that in a bit). \u00a0Thanks to the Check Please segment and the fabulous Yelp reviews, we came in the door on a Sunday afternoon. \u00a0As I expected (though to the shock of my Dad), the place is a rainbow of colors from the furniture, to the walls, to the numerous photos and keepsakes on the wall. \u00a0And yet its small enough that it feels like you've walked into someone's dining room.We got here just before the dinner rush so we got sat immediately. \u00a0My Dad and I first got a couple of Dos Equis Lagers to start. \u00a0I mention this because the beers that came out were HUGE. \u00a0The beers came in cold gigantic beer mugs to where there was at least 2 bottles worth of beer in each mug. \u00a0Did not see that coming, but a GREAT start to the evening. \u00a0Next, we (unexpectedly) each got a complementary appetizer of ceviche on a tostada. \u00a0Basically a variety of different fishes (I think I picked up octopus, shrimp and tuna) mixed with guacamole and other veggies with a hint of lime juice. \u00a0Very refreshing dish. \u00a0Then they brought out the chips and salsas (one of which was a green salsa that had a big kick to it). \u00a0All of this food and drink before we even ordered our own dishes? \u00a0Wow.My Dad got the grilled shrimp skewers that were seasoned and wrapped in bacon and cheese. \u00a0I went with the dish this place is most famous for. \u00a0A giant molten bowl of green tomatillo sauce and cheese with shrimp, fish, chicken, and beef lining the rim of the bowl (see my photo). \u00a0This my friends is the Molcajete Caliente (even the name sounds intimidating doesn't it?). \u00a0Both of our dishes came with a side of beans and rice (though even the rice was different as it was more of a rice pilaf). \u00a0While the tomatillo and cheese is bubbling hot (and pretty much stays that way), its actually not spicy at all. \u00a0But it coated every piece of meat on the bowl beautifully. \u00a0The meats were all grilled and seasoned perfectly and with a coat of that tomatillo and cheese I was in heaven. \u00a0My Dad absolutely destroyed his bacon and cheese shrimps he loved them so much. \u00a0I was going to use the Yelp check in for the free tres leches cake (which they do honor), but we were both so stuffed full of food and beer we couldn't eat another bite. \u00a0Between the great food, festive atmosphere, friendly waitress and stuffed stomaches, our first venture here was a highly successful one.Total tab for the 2 huge beers, chips and salsa, complimentary ceviche tostadas, main dishes, sides, tax and tip was $75. \u00a0The Molcajete is $30 by itself so that's what pushed the price a little higher (they also have a bowl for larger groups that runs around $40). \u00a0But trust me, this is $30 worth spending. \u00a0It can easily feed two or more people (though I stupidity tried to take it down myself). \u00a0I'll happily enjoy the rest for lunch tomorrow. \u00a0So like I said, if you're craving good Mexican food, look towards the inner city area. \u00a0Even though i was pretty excited about this place, even I was surprised how generous the portions were and by all the freebees. \u00a0Its no wonder the place was packed the whole time we were there and why it seemed like every customer was smiling. \u00a0The Maldonados originally created this oasis in the desert to help pay for their kids' college education and achieve the American dream for their entire family. \u00a0If their cuisine, staff and happy customers are any indication, I'd say the hard work has paid off, many many times over."], ["Josie M.", "I really hate having to write this because I really was hoping that I was going to have this delicious mouth watering experience after reading the reviews.  \u00a0 Unfortunately this was not the case, as I stepped into the restaurant the decor was something I pictured a Mariscos restaurant would look so colorful and beautiful and my server was friendly and that is were it ends. \u00a0 I ordered a water of jamica w/o ice as I took a sip to my disappointment it was warm. Now I ask myself shouldn't fresh fruit water drinks be placed in ice or the refrigerator to avoid contamination? So for my meal I had the shrimp ceviche plate and as I took a bite of my tostada all I could taste is the staleness of the tostada and saltiness of the civiche and I am one who LOVES salt. The shrimp definitely was not fresh (I wonder if it may have been canned?). So I brought it to the waitress attention that the saltine crackers and tostadas were stale. She informed me that the restaurant was aware of this. Now why would a 4 1/2 star restaurant serve stale food to their customers? \u00a0 Mariscos Playa Hermosa I wish I could say my food made my taste buds dance but it did not."], ["Monica O.", "Mariscos Playa Hermosa was picked for May's International Supper Club UYE and we had a big turnout expected 14 but had around 26 to 30 and I have to say management & servers didn't blink an eye when I kept asking for another chair please. \u00a0Excellent customer service! \u00a0The parking lot is very very small, maybe can park 8 to 12 cars, but there is plenty of parking on the street, so that what I did, once inside the place is very colorful and inviting.I ordered the 3 carne asada tacos with beans and rice. They were great street tacos perfect for what I was craving. The beans and rice were ok, over all it was a good dish and with tax included came in under 10 bucks! That's a great deal for dinner! \u00a0After everyone was done eating they brought us out 5 different types of cakes/dessert to try, chocolate cake, tres leches cake, coconut cake, cheese cake & flan. I'm a chocolate lovin fool and the chocolate cake was perfect, it was sweet, rich and full of chocolaty goodness, but my favorite I have to say was the Tres Leches Cake, that stuff was amazing! Also the coconut cake was great too! I defiantly will be coming back to try a few other of their dishes for sure!"], ["INubia S.", "I'll start by saying that the people who I dealt with here were very polite and hospitable. But, they seated us and forgot about us. We sat for about 10-12 min before we asked someone if we could order (after looking the menus over and deciding on a plate), so we ordered our drinks and food at the same time. The wait for the food was long as well.Our plates were expensive for what we got in return. I ordered Pescado a la Diabla, which is a fish filet in spicy sauce. The sauce was not at all spicy, not to my standards anyway, and it was salty. It came with beans, rice & salad, but a very small portion of each. There were four of us who dined here and everyone said their food was just okay. The chips were stale and the salsa tasted too much like tomato, there was no spice to it. Our table had no napkins and we had to ask for our silverware after we were given our food.The location is not very big and feels crowded inside. It was so loud it was hard to hear the waitress or the people at my table.There are no baby changing stations in the restroom. Definitely will not be returning."], ["Brian M.", "Not sure why the high star reviews. We went here with high hopes of a shining review. Instead I got bait and switched. \u00a0Chips were thick corn and the salsa was water but the guacamole sauce was pretty good. The 'drowning shrimp' was a nice start and I thought the rest of the meal would follow suit. \u00a0I thought I was playing it safe with garlic shrimp, but I was surprised that for $15 you get six medium (seriously the 25-40 size) shrimp. The 7 seas soup was watery with little to it...the main reason we drove 30 minutes to the ghetto...think Notorious BIG \"Juicy\" playing in the background as you roll up. \u00a0Homeless drunk lady harassing patrons as they waited for tables and the guy I told about it seemed to care less. \u00a0The mariachi band was a nice authentic touch and was fun, but a bit intense for such a small place. \u00a0Don't get me wrong. It's a good mariscos restaurant and if you are in the area it's probably the best mexican seafood option for more than a few blocks.My apologies for some reason my phone only saved the pic of the 'drowning shrimp' (raw shrimp over cucumber and tomato drizzled with lemon juice,salt,pepper and topped with avocado and onion ---like whole shrimp ceviche.)"], ["Cristy F.", "I only had the mixed seafood cocktail.

I saw it reviewed on a popular local TV Show and it looked awesome so decided to give it a try.First the parking lot was really small/tight so that made it a challenge. The place was very much smaller inside than it looked on TV as well. Your table chair up against another tables chair small. You couldn't easily get in and out without hitting other diners.As far as service they were nice enough but after taking our order we didn't see our server very often. Had to ask for menus and after we received our food we had to ask for silverware. It was said on the show everyone get a small sample of the ceviche. We did not. We did get chips and salsa as well as a tomatillo green sauce. While not bad the chips and sales was not that good either. They did not give small plates or anything so the chip went into the sauce then straight to your mouth. Kind of sloppy.For an app we had seafood cocktail. It was large and pretty good with lots of different kind of shrimp, octopus, fish etc. They didn't scrimp on the seafood but at $18.00 each I would hope not! It was served with saltines which I also thought is kind of weird for a Mexican restaurant.For entrees we had a spicy shrimp dish and crab enchiladas. The spicy shrimp was good. Smothered in a red sauce it was a little hard to eat since they left the tail shell on and it was hard to remove and eat because it was smothered in the sauce. Not sure how you were expected to pull it off?The crab enchiladas were not good to me at all and had a weird smell. I only ate two bites and was done. Overall damage approached $70 for two people and I left hungry. I love Mexican food i guess just not Mexican seafood."], ["Cesar S.", "Good food but terrible waitresses.

Mine was equally as good if not better because my shrimps were larger.They use a medium shrimp that's tasty but nothing the average Joe can't make themselves...

Nor did anyone at the table.The tortillas were tortillas nothing special.Back to the service...I don't want to hear excuses like \" it was very busy\" because according you all those 5 star reviews( which I just don't get) you should expect it to be super busy on a Saturday night!One end of the table was almost finished by the time the other end got their food... The servers had absolutely no idea who had what so she pretty much passed the plates and we figured it out ourselves! \u00a0I had to ask for all the dirty dishes to be taken away as nobody came to take them.On to dessert...they knew we were there for a Birthday and we had to remind them several times. \u00a0For the birthday girl they give a piece of cake and she chose \" tres leche cake\" the cake was unlike any Tres Leche I have had.. Had a raspberry? Filling and did not taste very leche... I am no expert at this but the ones I have tried sit in the leche which absorbs into the cake making it somewhat soggy and delicious... This was different ... \u00a0I am sure there are many different kinds but it was not a hit at the table...So, they have this other deal... Where they bribe you to YELP a reviews using names of servers and when they confirm it was posted they give you a piece of coconut cake...so one of the kids at the table did it...I must say...the coconut cake was delish! Very moist and lots of coconut!Getting the check was another challenge and when we did get it they charged for 3 items of which we only had 2....Really makes me wonder... Between the REVIEW BRIBES and the mistakes on the check.... How much money they make this way?Since we live nowhere close the chances of any of us returning are slim ...On goes my quest to find some great Mexican food!I imagine when a restaurant knows they are going to be on TV they make sure everything tastes great and service is great...But on any other day you see how it really is... Don't believe everything you see on TVIt is a cute place and the fish was good... Give it a try... See what you think!Never base a decision on one persons review... Food is a preference and I am very tough critic! \u00a0Bon Appetite'"], ["Melissa Z.", "This place is family friendly and the food is fresh and delicious, Definitely coming back..."], ["Bill K.", "Saw the Mariscos Playa Hermosa menu photo layout in the Phoenix Mexican Food Guide (Mexican Seafood) section and we had to try it.

Our check for 2 people was $60. We both had 1 drink and 1 entree and split an appetizer.

I've had ceviche from several dozen places and I'd have to rate this ceviche in the bottom 3 : /The 'Camarones Fantasia' were very dry (over fried a little) and small for an order/the price. It came with 6 medium sized shrimps and should have been at least large or jumbo so as not to become so dry while cooking optimally. Ironically enough, I thought the actual taste was not terrible, but I could not describe them as \"succulent\" by any means.The 'Camarones de Ajo' were very good but lacked some flavor that should have been there and that has been present in other Ajo dishes I have sampled throughout the US and Mexico.The drinks were AWESOME! The micheladas were very great and by far the best part of the meal. However, they were the most expensive I have ever bought (40% more than the most touristy of spots in Mexico, which if you understand, is saying a lot!).

I've never thought that the employees were particularly rude, just as polite as they needed to be. Decor/Cleanliness: They have recently remodeled and I must say that it's a nice upgrade. Before, the place was tiny, a very hole-in-the-wall establishment with not much room for seating. However, now they expanded into the business next door and it looks a lot more open and airy. They also upgraded their signs and menu board to look a lot more sleek and refined. The only thing is that in their old place, they used to have a huge mural that I really loved, but with the remodel, they had to tear down that wall.

There was one other customer and she got no smiles either. When I paid I did get a thank you but still no smile. I paid and waited for my food. There were no straws so I asked nicely for one and was given a look of hate and finally got my straw. how dare I ask for a straw for the $2+ 20oz sprite I ordered. Anywho I go back to work with my food from the angry place and open it up. I figure maybe this will be awesome! Yea no. First of all no salsa, guac, or sour cream to season the lackluster fajitas. And on top of it they give you one tortilla. for fajitas! So I call. The girl was not that friendly, not that apologetic, and says I will get 20% off my next visit. I work in a huge call center and will make sure that nobody I know goes there so yea probably not going to be using that 20% off coupon.

It was sad. The ingredients inside the burrito were relatively fresh to be honest but nonetheless the booty sauce killed it for me. Maybe I got the bad batch that fateful Friday afternoon. There were two people working and it was busy. They have a salsa bar that was limited and not much to the imagination. I am sorry Phoenix but you need to come to Chicago and try some Mexican food. I realize Phoenix is way way closer to Mexico than Chicago but good LoRD do they not know what good food is. You guys got us beat when it comes to weather but that is it.

Has a chipotle like assembly line but they offer tastings of every topping and meat like an ice cream shop. Very considerate. Few beers and Mexican sodas but most importantly there was a vegan option for me and plenty of meat options for my hubby. Generous portions and very friendly staff and you could tell all the ingredients were fresh. Nothing says fresh and nothing to hide like an open kitchen and fresh avacados sliced in front of you to go on your burrito.

There were 10-12 different meats to choose from, including an assortment of chicken, pork, and beef. After choosing your meat, you top off your order Chipotle-style, choosing which toppings you want to add. While we were deciding what to order, we were offered samples of the meats since there was no one in line behind us. Make sure to do this if you can as some of the meats are spicier than you might think. This was great for me though, as I love spicy food. My favorite meat wound up being the green chile beef. It was nice and spicy, while retaining a smoky beef flavor. I wound up ordering five street tacos, all with different meats, then topped them off with pretty much every garnish they had available. My hubby ordered their burrito (enchilada style), and it was HUGE. The assembling of our order was a little on the slow side, but the owner mentioned it was one of their employee's first day.

In fact, we were so not in a hurry that we didn't realize the restaurant closed at 8 and we wound up hanging \u00a0out in the restaurant about 40 minutes past closing time.

Yeah... well Crescent Ballroom did that for me. The first and only time I've come here, was to play Bingo. That statement alone should be enough evidence to myself and anyone else who will listen that my days of coolness have passed. If they ever existed at all.This place is pretty sweet. I had dinner before Bingo because grandpa (me) knew it might be a late night and I didn't want to eat after I left here. Doing something like that would lead to a night of indigestion and no sleep. Psssh... who needs that in their life. Am I right? I tried the carne asada quesadilla and it was unexpectedly good. I would eat here again without a doubt. The Bingo was played in the concert area. I'm not gonna lie... it was fun. The event was put on by Jackalope Ranch and emceed by the National Comedy Theater of Phoenix. They did a great job. Funny people. Especially this guy Marcus. Hilarious.They were all about audience participation. Like it or not. I was actually glad I never won a hand of Bingo because then you had to go up on stage and try to match wits with a trained comedian. I don't need that in my life. I'm the kind of person who thinks of a comeback 3 days later. It was a lot of fun though. Crescent Ballroom seems like it would be an amazing live music venue. I checked the calendar and there was not one band that I knew. Oh, wait... except the Toadies. You know the \"hipster\" line, you wouldn't know who they are... Well they're right. I don't. Bottom line is that this place is cool. A solid 4. Hopefully one day a band I know will play here and I can bump it to a 5. Until then I'll live in happy acceptance that my days of coolness are behind me."], ["Kevin D.", "My friends and I frequent the Crescent Ballroom because of all the great shows that come in here to play and the great atmosphere in the front room and patio. \u00a0This is a great place to come for a show or just to hang out and grab some food or drinks. There is always something awesome to check out here no matter what day of the week. Most of the shows do have some sort of cost, but it is usually worth the price. I have seen tons of shows here in the past and had a wonderful time. The venue is very personal and offers a wide array of options for you to enjoy the show, including lots of standing room, high table tops, and stadium blenchers in the back. Inside the venue there are conveniently located bathrooms, the merch table and a bar.Drinks - The bottled beer selection here is pretty decent but the draft selection of beers is very limited. I would recommend sticking to hard liquor here. The Vodka Sodas here are some of the best and strongest in town. After just three of these drinks you will be feeling very good. They also carry a personal favorite of mine, Templeton Rye whiskey. A glass on the rocks will run you $10, but it is well worth it.Food - I have heard many good things about the food from the Crescent, but I have only ever ordered the nachos. \u00a0These nachos are awesome though! They are delicious but expensive at ~$13. However, they can easily feed 2-4 people so the cost is not that bad unless you are the one treating the table. I am very interested in coming here during the day to try other food. Most of the menu is extremely affordable and sounds delicious, especially for a concert venue.Staff/Service - I have only been here at night, but it is pretty typical not to receive any sort of table service if you are at the front room or on the patio. I would recommend ordering all drinks and food up at the bar. The bar staff are super nice and work quickly to get everyone's order taken care of. If you are ordering food they will give you a card to bring back to your table so someone else can deliver your food.I love the Crescent Ballroom and it is by far one of my favorite spots in town.

The drink selection is good if you're into beer and hipster cocktails. \u00a0My only complaint is that they only have 4 beers on draft and I love draft beer. \u00a0But they have a large selection of cans. \u00a0The mixed drinks are interesting - especially the Honey Badger which is a bourbon version of a moscow mule. \u00a0I think Crescent does a great job of cultivating a friendly, artistic scene in Phoenix and I am looking forward to many more visits in the future!"], ["Jess P.", "It's been 4 years and this place still blows my mind!

I want to come back for a flamenco show. Anyways, my 5 stars has to do with the set-up of this place. (Note: I've been here once before for post-dinner dinner since the fattie in me got hungry again. Ate their chips/guac & Sonoran dog & it was good. Get it if you like dirtydogs). As I was saying, the set-up is nice because the outdoor area allows you to enjoy the food while having an audible conversation, but if you're curious about the live band/DJ/show or want to just vibe with the music you can sneak inside and grab a drink by the bar. And perhaps you like what you're hearing and want to dance it off ... the dance floor is yours! Our cover charge was $5 at the door for guys/girls ($3 if purchased online), I'm not sure if that's always the case. I REALLY liked that they have these \"bleacher seats\" extended across the back wall so if you're tired from dancing or maybe you don't like to dance at all but just want to enjoy the music, you can just chill back there without having to \u00a0pay for a table or deal with all the inconveniences of a swanky club. \u00a0Big plus for all you ladies in heels who need to rest your poor little toes!*Parking: Plenty of metered parking and lots.. use them!

The venue is set up really well. The lighting tends to be low but other than that pretty good. Always clean. Nice smoking patio. The restaurant is good but they could offer some less expensive options-- it is a venue after all. The sound is hit or miss, it tends to be bass heavy and blows out the other instruments. They tend to not care much about mixing for local or supporting bands unfortunately.The wait staff is nice. The security is the worst only second to The Marquee. I probably went there 2-3'x a week for a year before anyone in that place even began to remember me. Others of my friends have been harassed about their ID's which was totally bogus. Other venues seem to make an effort to know their regular customers . This place seems like they couldn't care less -- it comes across as pretentiousness.

We got advance tickets for the bash - only $5 pp. Let's see what all went down between 9 PM and 1 AM: My new years eve meal = an $8.50 burrito that tasted fresh, with well cooked and well-seasoned meat; I was pleasantly surprised considering it came out of a big nondescript cooler; bartenders were nice and efficient; Drinks weren't outrageously expensive. Music was awesome, an eclectic mix of songs from the past three decades; there was an artist doing a painting live on stage while the DJ was blasting away - very cool to see; the crowd was late 20s-early-30s-hipsters-heavy; People cheered when some dude opened his umbrella in the middle of the crowd - gotta love the random hilarity. Dance floor was packed by 11 PM. It looked like the kind of dance floor for people who say \"I don't really dance\". To clarify, that's an observation, not a complaint. Nothing wrong with it.

You can even hear the bands playing in certain areas without getting a ticket. There is also a small patio that you can use if you need to light one up or just get some fresh air.The bands are in the middle section and it is a rather large area. Most of the people listening are standing up by the stage and you can move around wherever you want to go. There are also some bleachers along the wall if want to listen sitting down. Really like the cool bar area in the back when you need a quick refill and the easy access bathrooms when it is time to go. Nice!This particular show was sold out and packed to the rim. Even with a full crowd it was still a very enjoyable event. The sound is pretty amazing no matter where you listen. It does have a tendency to get pretty loud at times so you may want to bring some ear plugs as an option.Get there early so you can goof off and work on your buzz. The music can go for a few hours depending on the length of the sets and who is playing.

Maybe not the best match for such a dish.Tried ordering their famous Chiles en Nogada and was told that it is a seasonal dish. They said that pomegranate was not available and they did not have the ingredients. Why put it on the menu if you do not serve it at all times? Maybe start by putting SEASONAL next to the item so that everyone knows up front.Ordered the Pollo Poblano instead and was not very impressed.

They're def satisfying, though. The enchiladas: you get 5-6 enchiladas so it's a very generous portion. They have to be the best I've tried. Just look at the pictures.

I will be back for more!"], ["Roam J.", "Food here ranges from the delicious to the absurd. \u00a0If it reads like a gimmick, it probably is so be warned. \u00a0On my most recent trip I tried the del Rey - my goodness, what a heaping pile of meat. \u00a0There was egg, pork, cheese, ham, chorizo, some kind of hot dog, avocado and who knows what else. \u00a0I dumped their salsa on top (delicious!) and experienced pleasure through about half the sandwich, then very quickly reached a threshold and now I probably won't be able to eat a torta or any kind of processed meat for about a month without curling up into ball and sobbing. \u00a0In past trips I've chosen smaller, less ambitious items and made it through the visit purely in the pleasure zone.Outside of the entr\u00e9es, another reason we come here is the aquas frescas - \u00a0again, a bit gimmicky in that they are humongous, super sweet and come decked out with garnishes and umbrellas and such. \u00a0But they are quite delicious and great to share -- only problem is the wife always orders the regular, and I prefer them with sweetened condensed milk..."], ["Lydia E.", "Holy wow! Home made tortillas and everything is so fresh. Order a drink- you will thank me later. I could easily drink one of theses a day for breakfast. One of my favorite non alcoholic drinks hands down. While the tostas are what they are known for, the casadillas are more than amazing. The customers come in waves but the wait is short and worth it. While you are waiting you can watch the food being cooked and press their own homemade tortillas."], ["Cody V.", "Absolutely love this place. Food is fresh and made well. I do find that occasionally it is over salted. But if you ask for no salt they are okay with that request. Order the King Tacos. Super delicious and the fresh veggies that come on the plate are so welcome to an already great meal. The Agua Frescas are always yummy. It is very busy. But if you go at a off time it's easy to get in."], ["Pancho Pantera ..", "3pm on a Tuesday. Waitress is on top of her game. The service was perfect.Agua de avena is delicious.Torta Del Rey is absolutely a killer. My taste buds were going into a frenzy from all angles, ham one second, avocado, breaded beef, beans, sausage, cheese, soft bread salsa roja. For desert I got an esquimo. I wasnt a fan of this to me it taste like strawberry quik. Next time I'll have a different desert.This place lives up to its hype."], ["Sebastian M.", "..just had the most deliscious late brunch at this place. Started with a freshly made aqua fresca Pina Colada. Ordered the Torta del Rey and la Plata del Peluche. The place is famous for its tortas... and damn I know now why. Both mains were absolutelly delicious. To finish of, we ordered the flan for desert, that was like the cherry on the top, literally. Def great place and nice service.

My food is always ready in 10 minutes."], ["Jose C R.", "You want authentic mexican food? Say no more. Head over to this restaurant and your mexcan taste buds will be satisfied, no doubt. This place has been my favorite mexican food place for over 10 years and there is so much variety and flavor. I would recommend the Alambre de Camarones (Shrimp with beans and rice) or a Qusadilla estilo del Rey (really good quesadilla). The staff is friendly and I've never had a problem with the food. The owner is awesome too. He's friendly and REALLY likes to talk. Lol Anyway, definitely recommend this restaurant."], ["Pete T.", "This place is awesome. \u00a0It's a little tough to get to due to how cave creek and 7th St merge but once you find it, it's a gem. \u00a0I always get the same thing, the nortena torta with chicken. \u00a0The Mexican sandwich is marinated grilled chicken with jalape\u00f1o and onion tossed in. They then top it with Jack cheese, avocado and a chipotle cream sauce. It's incredible. \u00a0The bread is super soft and light. \u00a0My favorite item here is the orange salsa. \u00a0It's sweet with a little touch of heat, I could honestly drink the stuff. \u00a0I ate there with a buddy and we went through like 5 of the little dishes, it's insanely good. \u00a0My understanding is there authentic drinks are very good too but I haven't tried them personally. The service is always spot on. \u00a0This is one of the better sandwiches in Phoenix!"], ["Christina N.", "I will admit the last time I was here a few years ago I was VERY disappointed!This places was on DDD and i ordered the torta with high hopes. \u00a0 Turns out, they are just not for me. \u00a0However, my SIL asked us to meet them here two nights ago and I am so glad they convinced us to go! \u00a0The cameron burro is insanely delicious! \u00a0Chipotle crema, prefectly prepared tortillas, so much yum. \u00a0I ordered a fancy drink (I think this is a dry restaurant?) and it too me to the beach without the booze! Get the King pi\u00f1a colada, you gotta try it.My husband ordered the king tacos (with steak) and he loved them. \u00a0SIL ordered the same as me, and her husband got another cameron dish that he really enjoyed. \u00a0We also got 4 ceviche orders to start and they were really tasty. \u00a0 They are individual sized and a great way to begin your meal. \u00a0If you enjoy Tortas I'm still surr this is the place for you! \u00a0They just aren't my cup of tea apparently. \u00a0I've now learned that LRdlT can serve up delicious food no matter what you're looking for in a hole in the wall Mexican joint.One last note: \u00a0this place is kid friendly too.

I would order it again. also ordered a watermelon fresca that was really good also. the sandwich came with potato chips which we all thought was weird because we were at a Mexican restaurant but it was a sandwich i guess but still would rather had tortilla chips."], ["Nick Q.", "Seriously the best tacos I've had in a long time... maybe ever.I know they are famous for their tortas, but it was a late night stop and I didn't want to eat some beastly, 11lbs, torta. \u00a0So, I settled on the Bistec Encebollado tacos. \u00a0The flavor was spectacular and the meat was tender and easy to chew through. \u00a0I hate when you take a bite of a taco and pull all the insides out... The only downside, IMO, is that I couldn't have a beer with my tacos. \u00a0It's not enough downside to warrant a 4 star rating, but maybe a 4.5 star if that was an option.Check out this picture:instagram.com/p/vxJCgJNL\u2026"], ["Traveller222 2.", "This place is the best. I saw this place on man vs food and we decided to check it out on our way to Cali. Boy I'm glad we did. Hands down my favorite sandwich spot in Phoenix. To make things even more interesting Adam from man vs food was doing another episode on his show the day we showed up. I was loving it. It's kind of messed up how they moved all the regular customers to one side of the restaurant and filed on the other.Anyways, food was delicious and so fresh. They give you a lot of food for the money. We've been here twice and I promised my self anytime I'm in Arizona this is gonna be my first and last stop before I leave Phoenix. It's a tiny restaurant so be prepared to wait for 15-30 mins depending on what time of the day you show up. It's still worth the wait."], ["Dominique T.", "delicious!"], ["Cathy J.", "I have driven by this place every day for the past 5 years. Finally stopped in. I had a quesadilla, \u00a0and my husband had the del ray torta. They both were very tasty, and we even had some leftover for the next day."], ["Liz S.", "About as authentic as it gets. I was the only gringa in the restaurant where I had a asada quesadilla, which came with salad and jalape\u00f1o and limes. Great service, and great energy!

I promise you will fall in love!!!!!"], ["Isabel G.", "I've been wanting to try this place out ever since I saw it on Man Vs. Food. I finally got around to it since it was close to my new doctor's office. I ordered the Torta Del Rey and a papaya cremosa. The torta was exactly what I envisioned, \u00a0layers of meat goodness. The papaya cremosa was what really surprised me. Most boba places I frequent use powdered papaya flavor, but with this I could actually taste/ feel the bits of fresh papaya they used. I haven't had a good papaya drink in years and this is definitely one of the best ones I've ever had. They also have an extensive menu with items like burros, tacos and ceviche. \u00a0And the restaurant is actually bigger than it looks from the outside. I can't wait to come back to try out the other items!"], ["Bobby D.", "Los Reyes de la Torta (LRdlT) was my family's 3rd stop in our quest to try Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and Man vs Food restaurants in the Phoenix/Scottsdale, AZ area. \u00a0My family loved the DDD restaurants we experienced and LRdlT was going to be our one and only M vs F restaurant to try. \u00a0If there are any other Yelpers looking for a M vs F restaurant to eat at in Phoenix, LRdlT must be your 1st stop.LRdlT is located in a mini strip mall. \u00a0At first glance, you probably would question how one of the best sandwiches could be cooked here because the restaurant looked simple and unassuming. \u00a0Highly recommend that you arrive around 5pm to beat the dinner rush. \u00a0The restaurant is not too big and the secret is out about how great the food is at LRdlT. \u00a0If you come after 6pm, expect to wait and you'll be jealous watching the lucky people eat some delicious, mouth-watering authentic Mexican food. \u00a0How do you gauge whether a Mexican restaurant has legit food? \u00a0Mexicans frequent the restaurant. \u00a0As we were eating, the waiting area filled up with Mexican brothers and sisters from another mother.A Mexican torta is a sandwich with such Mexican meats as carne asada, pollo asada, carnitas, etc. \u00a0Adam Richman of Man vs Food fame introduced me to the Del Rey and the King Carlos V tortas. \u00a0If you want to accept the food challenge Adam performed on the show, you'll have to eat the humongous King Carlos in 15 minutes. \u00a0If you're successful, you won't have to pay the $25 for the sandwich. \u00a0No thanks, the Del Rey was more than enough for my overstuffed belly. \u00a0If you want a filling and very tasteful samwich, the Del Rey will make you thank Adam Richman out loud. \u00a0The Del Rey is comprised of ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, refried beans, hotdog meat, chorizo, omelette, tomato, onions, avocado, and chipotle sauce, all squeezed between soft, nicely toasted bread. \u00a0This conglomeration of meat, milk, bread, and vegetables will satisfy all food groups and your daily caloric intake in just one sitting. \u00a0To be honest, I probably could have finished the entire sandwich, but I split it with the wifey to save room for our other food excursions while on vacation. \u00a0You honestly can't fathom how amazing this torta is until you experience it yourself. \u00a0Ask for the grilled onions and jalapenos, which complement the torta. \u00a0To help the food go down, a must order is the watermelon agua fresca. \u00a0This will satisfy your thirst.Why oh why do my best food ever reside in places other than San Diego. \u00a0Adam Richman, you got it right recommending Los Reyes de la Torta. \u00a0The Del Rey was so worth sacrificing my slim waistline. \u00a0Until we meet again Del Rey, I'll be dreaming of how much I enjoyed engulfing you."], ["Patricia P.", "I can still taste the Lime.

Although the atmosphere is somewhat loud and the wait can be long during busy hours, the wait is always worth it. The staff is very friendly and you can never go wrong with any of the dishes you pick. If a torta is a mouthful, their quesadillas with handmade tortillas are delectable. I also recommend trying out their aguas cremosas made on the spot. This is one of the few places in the area you can he a delicious, full meal for an affordable price."], ["Ian C.", "i got the torta del rey. holy moly there was a lot of food in it. If you like meat.. there is every type imaginable in this torta.my only issue w/ it was that.. i got tired of eating it after the first half. It may be my preference but i felt like someone blended a bunch of meats and i was trying to eat it. On the positive side.. that quantity of food was only like 6$. I probably could have made 3 meals out of this."], ["Regina F.", "Delicious, filling, fresh. I just wish they had a bigger place it is always so packed of people.

Thanks to Man vs. Food I ate possibly the best torta sandwich ever! The torta del rey had a plenty of meat and the watermelon aqua was to die for. If I was ever was on death row and I had to pick a last meal then the torta del rey would be a top candidate. \u00a0Not only was the food mind-blowingly addictive but the service was top notch as well. Our server was not only helpful and fast but she was also extremely courteous and professional. I only wish that there could be a location somewhere in Los Angeles because then I would go every single week. Simply put this restaurant is outstanding. \u00a0Go, NOW! To unbelievably delicious eatings!! :D"], ["Silena T.", "Found this place on Yelp. We were looking for taco Tuesday specials and decided to give this place a try. When we arrived, it wasn't as busy so no waiting. The service was good. We ordered Pierna torta, Ranchera de Res, asada tacos and pollo tacos. Everything was delicious! We also ordered a pineapple fresca and strawberry fresa. The fresa was the best dessert I've ever had! Not too sweet which is what I liked and well worth the $5 it cost. I would definitely come back and try other dishes."], ["Craig M.", "The best food I have ever put in my face . \u00a0We had shrimp ceviche tostada, shrimp tacos, and a shrimp dinner plate . \u00a0 Words do not describe this. It's that's good ."], ["Daniel L.", "One thing I missed having after living in Iowa is good Mexican food. Finding Mexican cuisine in rural Iowa wasn't difficult, but the range of ingredients, freshness, and flavor often fell short of expectations. On the first visit, I came with fellow Yelpers Angela T, Fia R, and Kurdy S. More recently, I introduced my aunt to this place when she came to visit me. There's plenty of parking in the strip mall. Lighting isn't the best, and the hole in the wall d\u00e9cor consists of tiled floors, large open kitchen, TVs, and a down to earth vibe. The first thing interested diners need to know is their specialization in tortas. These gigantic subs are known for their size that probably weighs more than 5 pounds. The Del Rey ($9.50) came fully stacked with ham, cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, refried beans, two hot dogs, chorizo, eggs, tomato, onion, avocado, chipotle sauce, and a plate full of potato chips. There seemed to be no end to this sandwich, as I couldn't even finish half of it. In terms of quality, I liked the overall composition, the soft toasted bread, and the apparent shock effect for the amount of calories this beast carries. However, the refried beans could be more evenly spread, and the breaded beef could be seasoned so it has flavor. It was an item fun to have in group situations, and a novelty to cross off my long and never-ending to-eat list.The Nopales con Asada ($10.99) came with thick slices of grilled beef, cactus, fresh cheese, guacamole, and my choice of flour tortillas. The beef was juicy, fully marbled, chewy, and flavorful. The cactus was a highlight too, but was slightly over-salted. Food again was plentiful. I couldn't finish it all and had to take the rest to go. I'm likely order this again.The Chilaquiles ($7) came with fried tortilla, cotija cheese, runny eggs, onions, sour cream, and green and red salsa. The combination was delicious, particularly with the thick runny egg yolks to finesse the crispy textures and sharp salsa. The mix of flavors was still not as excellent as the Chiaquiles at Anepalco's, but it is a dish I would recommend besides the torta. The Pollo Burro ($6.75) came with chunky chicken, refried beans, pico de gallo, cheese, and avocado. The texture was too wet and mushy. El Farolito has a better burrito, where each ingredient is discernible and better seasoned. I don't recommend it.Another item I would not recommend is the Cocktel de Camaron Chico ($10.99). It came with shrimp, tomato juice, cilantro, onions, and avocado. The ratio was off as the few shrimps were lost in the tomato juice. The support cast could come chunkier as fillers. I felt like I had gone fishing only to come up empty with a few tiny shrimps. Overpriced and it was awful.These meals would not be complete unless I hit the 10,000 calories mark. So, for dessert, I highly recommend getting the Chocoflan ($5). It's a custard cake, not too sweet, very moist, and rich in chocolate flavor. It was addictive and easy to finish. For drinks, I liked the Aguas Frescas Naturales ($3.50). I preferred the watermelon flavor to the cantaloupe, and the non-alcoholic King Margarita ($4.50) was also worth considering as it comes with fresh strawberries with a touch of salt in every sip.The food took some time to arrive at our table and service was very absent unless we flag down someone to help us. Overall, I thought this restaurant offers a good variety of dishes, and portions were consistently out of this world. However, I have also had better and cheaper Mexican food elsewhere. I would consider this a good place to bring out of town guests looking for hole in the wall experiences. 3.5 stars for both visits, I'd be interested in coming back."], ["Marissa B.", "At first I missed it since its in this teeny strip mall type thing south of Hatcher. The little parking lot was full so I decided to chance the Wireless Phone store next door, parking at the end, completly ignoring the tow away zone. Living on the dangerous side - that's me! LOLWhen I walked in, it was PACKED. Sunday 300pm, guess everyone came in after church. I was quickly greeted by a waitress and asked for here or to go. I ordered out and got the Alambre De Res. I asked her how many tacos come in it and was told an order of three. Only when I got home to find two corn tortillas hiding under the mound of beef. Anyway, as I was standing there to pay, another waitress was handing over these two fruit things, the nosey person I am quickly asked what is that because it looked delicious. She called it a Fruit with Whip Cream, apparently it had sour cream and pecans in it to. So I ordered the Strawberry one as well.As it was just to crowded for me, I stepped out side, eating my Fruit Cream and waited for my order to appear. I was told it would take 10-15mins which I was fine with because of the crowd it was understandable. After about 5mins I realized it started to get hot and I stepped back inside and grabbed a seat and proceeded to people watch.There was one waitress who's sole purpose was to answer the phone, taking to go orders and packing them up as they were ready. Another one stood at the cash register and accepted all payments. I saw a man there not dressed in the pink shirt and khaki pants, perhaps the Manager? He would talk with the waiteresses, pointing out things that they quickly addressed. Just made sure everything was running smoothly.As I waited, I munched on the Fruit Cup - delicious! It had chunks of strawberries and pieces of pecans. Almost like yogurt. When I finally got my order home, and opened the box it just looked delicious...only missing one corn toritlla. What I liked about the meal is that it had a huge wedge of grilled onion and chili, so I could take a bite of that with the tacos. Grilled veggies are the best! The \"salad\" I didn't bother with, I think it was shredded lettuce, could've been cabbage, but since I didn't touch it, I'm not sure. Beans would've been a better side. I munched on the slices of cucumber and radishes that accompanied it. The meat was delicious with the melted cheese on top and with the salsa - a delicious meal it made!Oh. And all these reviews about it being a sketchy/scary area. Umm..not really..6/1/14 Update: This visit I got the Mexican Pizza in the appetizer section - delicious! I also got the Alambre De Cameron (Shrimp Tacos) SO GOOD! Filled with shrimp, topped with melting cheese. I didn't want the \"salad\" that usually comes with it and asked for beans instead. Welll...they gave me double serving of rice. BUT! It wasn't the typical Spanish Rice that I do NOT under any circumstances like. It had corn, bell peppers and NO hint of tomato sauce anywhere. YUM!"], ["Monserrat M.", "I love this place! I been coming here since I was a little girl, and I had never had a problem with this place. Their tortas are to die for, and their fruit waters are a must if you come here."], ["Raquel A.", "Delicious! Waiting too long to try this place. I could've been spending my money on tortas here ALL THIS TIME!! I ordered a chicken torta and requested the tinga-style chicken. Freakin amazing, fresh and light choice for this hotter-than-hell Phoenix summer.
