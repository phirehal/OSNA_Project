Also we waited a good 15 minutes for our check after we all decided to leave some kind of signal we were done by stacking our plates together.Onto the sushi: most of the sushi was fresh, however the avocados were not ripe enough and were slightly hard. All throughout the dinner, I had this very unusual undertone taste to everything I ate. After several experiments we discovered it was a mixture of the dirty soy sauce bowls and the soy sauce that made everything taste like you were eating a latex balloon.Between the service, the weird taste and the high priced food ($14 for Beef Yakisoba? It's just ramen with little tidbits of beef!) we figured we can go to Sushi Station near Desert Ridge in the future for a much better meal."], ["Zoe J.", "Went there with my boyfriend and didn't know what to expect since I've heard mixed reviews.

When a girlfriend at work wanted to go for Happy Hour I decided to pick this place- one for its proximity and two, for the fact that their Happy Hour goes until 7 pm. For a workaholic like me, who doesn't ever know if I have to stay late- that's totally a WIN. So me and my friend roll into here at the tail end of happy hour and it's pretty busy. Clearly the locals are in the know about the happy hour deals at this place. We wait a little while- not too long, and get seated in our own little booth. There are two sets of menus- the happy hour one, and the regular one. We order off of both and wait for our food to arrive.First off- cocktails. She got the sangria, I got the Tokyo Tea. Both are great- the Tea is DEFINITELY pretty strong, so be warned. It's apparently their version of Long Islands, with Midori added. Good to know. I lucked out with it being good- the cocktails had no description and so I picked blindly, hoping it would taste decent. The sushi came out very promptly, and was decent for sushi. Nice portion sizes, fairly fresh. I unfortunately can't remember what exactly we ordered, though. Interestingly enough, we note after we finish our first plate of sushi that we're missing some. We flag down what I'm pretty sure is the Lady Boss, and she apologizes profusely- and brings back out for us the Happy Hour menu. Even though it's actually AFTER happy hour at this point. I was quite impressed, to be honest. But we tell her no, we had orders on the regular menu, and she brings that out instead, we mark down what we got and reorder again. This had a bit more raw fish- I believe we got the Cherry Blossom roll, and the... white something? My memory fails me, but it had white tuna, and mayo, and was awesome. I also got my standard Ikura nigiri, and that too was okay. It can be too fishy if not fresh, but this was good. For all the sushi we ate, and the drinks we drank (we got an appetizer AND miso soup as well) it only came up to about $30 a person. Pretty gosh danged decent, given that us two ate enough for 4 people.

The salmon was warm slimmy and rubbery...yeah three traits your \"fresh\" seafood should never be..guess what happened 4 hours later...I will spare you the details and let your imagine play.Anyways, pretty typical poor quality sushi place, with inflated prices.

All of them came out at the same time, all of them looked absolutely perfect. The fish was fresh and light, as it should be in sushi. The edamame that we ordered as an appetizer came steamed and warm (as it should be) and was perfectly delicious.

It wasn't gummy and didn't fall apart. The Seaweed salad was solid. For rolls we ordered a Poki Poki which featured their house speciality tuna poke and crab. It was recommended by our server as one of her favorites and she didn't disappoint. Soft Shell Crab roll was flavorful as was the Salmon Skin roll.

The bento boxes are a rip off, IMO. Salad is okay. Gyoza is nothing spectacular. Tempura is greasy and battered up. Rice is okay. Nothing spectacular. Nothing disgusting, either. Just a bit overpriced.My husband and I spent around $50 for LUNCH for 2 bento boxes and the ahi poki tuna. RIP OFF, if you ask me. If you compare it to other decent sushi restaurants, $50 would probably get you almost 2 separate meals during lunch for 2 people instead of just 1 at Nori. It's all about value.

We tried it for the first time on SAT on the way back from the outlets. The younger gentlemen who greeted us was super friendly, sat us right away and brought our drinks over right away too. However, he was the ONLY part of the service that night that was good. The waitress who took our order seemed new? She didn't know what agedashi tofu was and didn't seem very happy to be there and neither did the other two waitresses (one of them being the owner). However, \u00a0I will say that the food is great! This is probably THE BEST moderately priced sushi you will get in AZ. I'm from Hawaii so I know fresh sushi/sashimi! : ) We ordered the following items.APPETIZER: Agedashi Tofu - this was EXCELLENT! VERY lightly battered, perfect crisp and the dash broth surprisingly was the perfect soupy consistency and not too salty!SUSHI: We ordered the Spicy Scallop Sushi (Gunkan), and the Sweet Potato Tempura Roll. The Spicy Scallop was pretty fresh, no the best I've had but definitely not bad. The consistency of the rice here is fairly decent! The sweet potato roll I could love it or leave it. The sweet potato was crispy and delicious but I think because it was piping hot when it was rolled up, it ended up heating up the rice a bit and making it a tad mushy.BENTO: We ordered the Combination Bento Box with Salmon and Beef Teriyaki. It came with a full size California roll. The roll had very little rice which I can definitely appreciate and the inside was STUFFED so the bento box was a great deal!! It also came with miso soup and a side salad.MISC: We decided to try the Shrimp Yaki-Udon. The udon could've been a bit more al dente but overall, not too shabby at all!!As the evening progressed our wait staff became more friendly which was nice and the busser (who was also the one who initially greeted us at the door) was super diligent about drink refills and taking away the dishes we were finished with.In regards to the decor, it's very chic! It's a new spot so it's super clean. The interior finishes are all very modern and the both times we've been here it's been a nice and quiet dining experience.

The Snow White roll was great incorporating snow crab but the happy hour price ($9) didn't make me that happy with every other roll on there being around $4.

The Crazy roll was supposed to be spicy, but it actually turned out to be extremely sweet and not what I was hoping for at all. Almost had a banana taste to it.

I got the chance to try both the Okonomiyaki (which was the plate I ordered) and the Chicken Catsu Curry. The Okonomiyaki is a savory Japanese pancake. Mine had shrimp, Japanese mayo, and eel sauce as well as an assortment of other veggies and herbs. The other entree was very delicious as well. The chicken was breaded and lightly fried and it created a wonderful sensation when combined with the white rice and curry. Lastly for dessert l had the special for the day (they only had one dessert). It was fritters accompanied by strawberry jam and miso sauce.

I ordered the terriyaki chicken as an app. It was freaking delicious, and came out in less than 10 minutes. My dining companion and I ordered 3 rolls between us. They are, on average, about $7 each for some decent stuff. Only problem is that it took a bit over half an hour to arrive! WTF? The hana roll was beautiful and tasty, with the multiple varieties of fish. Unfortunately, they fell apart rather easily, even for something so large it was cumbersome to enjoy with chopsticks. I still approve. The tootsie roll was not exactly what I was expecting. Didn't realize that all the contents would be cooked, and thought it was weird that there were tempura batter bits mixed throughout the rice. As for the tropicana roll, mango and salmon sounded lovely, but I didn't realize there would be excessive globs of mayonnaise on top of it. I feel as though the menu does not accurately describe what you're signing up for, and that can result in disappointment. In the end, I barely had time to take a couple of bites before a server dropped off a check. They were adamant about getting us out ASAP despite being patient with them. It's hard to knock a sushi place that's offering such great deals, but it really pushes my limits of how much questionable service I can put up with before I ding you.

The menu sheet is a Little busy but each roll has its own flavor factor."], ["Nathan C.", "**Best sushi in ALL of Phoenix**I frequent this place very regularly and I never get tired of eating it. They have a huge variety of choices to choose from, so you'll never bore. Variety range from vegetarian/vegan rolls to meaty rolls and even low carb rolls. Staff is always friendly and very helpful. Each sushi chef has his own unique style/flare and it is definitely represented in their cooking. Granted all the chefs cooking AMAZINGLY, my family and I have our favorite chef named Sean while my friends have their favorite chef named Hero. You take your pick lol! I would 1000% recommend this place."], ["Russ D.", "I love this place. Always smiling and friendly staff.

Service was fast, people were friendly, food was good. Nothing too stellar about this establishment, everything is the way it should be.The reason I gave three stars was that my rolls kept falling apart when I picked them up with the chop sticks, it was very hard to manage and then a section would fall out and I had to scoop it up.The cucumber salad is different and with long shredded strands of cucumber and a nice sesame sprinkle a light vinegar dressing. I did nothing out the ordinary on the rolls as i ordered from the Happy Hour specials - great prices BTW!Its a decent place to try, so swing by if you have a craving."], ["Christine P.", "Ive been here for years! i love ittttttttt. Hands down the best sushi everrr!!!Hole in the wall...? Yes. Yes it is. But this is the only place I go for amazing sushi!!!!!!!!!!!Happy hour starts at 8pm Whooo.

Ahha.I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!"], ["Janet N.", "Did I eat at the correct Akaihana? Because based off the reviews, it seems like I had a completely different experience here that was hardly passable in my book.Akaihana advertised a happy hour and had deals for apps, sushi rolls and alcohol, plus it was cheap, but I guess some things are too good to be true. I stepped into Akaihana and was greeted by the sushi chef in some kind of indistinct Asian language, I'm used to the \"Irasshaimase\" greeting as I used to serve at a Japanese restaurant in the past. However, I could not make out what language he was speaking. Regardless, I was seated in the corner of the restaurant and was given 3 menus.Since I was sharing dinner, the items that were ordered were: Tootsie Roll, Spicy Salmon Roll, Tropicana Roll-Tootsie Roll: deep fried salmon surrounding imitation crab meat, big roll and served with a soy-based sauce-Spicy Salmon Roll: chopped up salmon mixed with spicy sauce in a roll, this is nothing special. Spicy salmon does not work in my book, spicy tuna does though. - Tropicana Roll: Salmon with mango, each piece topped with spicy mayo and sriracha and more soy-based sauceThis place masks the quality of their fish with sauces, deep frying and rice portion. The portion of rice was overwhelming in comparison to the rest of the fish in the rolls and wasn't seasoned well and hard, the sauces overtake your tastebuds not allowing you to taste the fish. The ginger was very sweet and I didn't even dare try the wasabi.Cheap prices are reflected in their quality of rolls,: over sauced, too much rice and lacking in quality of fish. Interior is a bit crazy with variety of menu choices and service is decent at most. Also upon leaving, the sushi chef greeted me once again in some indistinct (made up sounding) language which I found to be a bit offensive. Because I know for a fact he was not speaking Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese or Filipino because I've worked and frequent Japanese and Korean restaurants/have friends who are and that I am both Vietnamese and Filipino.*Pass on this place, I got a stomach ache the whole night after dining in here."], ["Starr S.", "This is the only place I eat sushi at.

They have so much to choose from its hard to decide on just a few items. My boyfriend and I have been there twice so far. On our first visit we happen to get there during happy hour. Needless to say it was BUSY! I know a lot of people hate to go to restaurants when they are packed but not this girl! To me, it says a lot about the food! We sat at the bar and ordered drinks and started salavating as we picked out a few rolls. We decided on the Manhattan Roll, Soft Shell Crab Roll, Las Vegas Roll, Soft Shrimp Hand Roll and one other that escapes me at the moment! Ha! Anyways, the Manhattan Roll was on point!!! Oh so good! The Soft Shell Crab Roll was amazing! Not fishy at all! I think my other half could have eaten a ton of those. The Las Vegas Roll was definitely different than you'd get at most sushi places. It had some sort of green sauce rather than the typical eel sauce. Because I am so use to the average Las Vegas roll, I was a bit taken back at first, but after each bite, I rather enjoyed it! Man I wish I could remember the other roll we had because it too was fantastic!The second visit was not during happy hour. It was by far, not as busy. We sat at the bar as we usually do and was greated by Sean. This guy should be in comedy! He kept us entertained with his humor which was refreshing since most sushi chefs are so dang serious! On this day we ordered the Shrimp Tempura Roll and the Rose Royce Roll. I'm not even go into reviewing the Shrimp Tempura Roll. Don't get me wrong, it was delish! But I have to tell you about the Rose Royce Roll....can you say spicy? No.....spicy does no justice to this roll. Hot? Hmmm....no. Let's see...how about a nice subtle heat that turns into a punch in the throat like sneak attack from highly trained Ninjas! Yep that'll do! This roll was so delicious! Packed with fresh cut habenero, If you are a novice to hot food, you will never get through this roll! This thing had us both sweatin' to the oldies! But we loved it! Sean was gracious enough to let us try some jelly fish. The marinate was very tasty but the texture was like eating soft plastic. Very cartilage-y lol! The service was great! Never had to ask for drink refills since they were on top of that. We will definitely be back here. So far this is our \"sushi place of choice\"."], ["Sara B.", "Happy hour here is absolutely incredible! My sister used to work here in high school (I know, I know.

I had read a lot of the previous reviews including some really horrible ones, but decided that those seemed few and far between.The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the slow service. All the servers were very friendly and helpful, but it was a little slow to get just about anything.We ordered shumai appitizer, miso soup and four rolls. The Blue Flame roll was my husbands favorite, its fried, but lightly so it doesn't have a lot of crunch which we both really enjoyed. We also ordered a dragon roll, Jan roll and baked scallop roll.

The worst part was that the broth was barely warm and lacked flavor. The salmon skin roll was ok. It was falling apart!

The motchi (not sure how to spell it) is a desert they have that is just amazing. They have three flavors. Mango, strawberry and green tea.

I was so bummed out because the other sushi place that I usually frequent gives out fresh wasabi FREE all the time. My favorite item on the menu was the H3 roll. It was spicy, but not in any way a tear-jerker kind of spicy. I would also recommend getting the spicy sashimi salad, which was super good with strong flavors of sesame oil. Service was quick. We made a reservation, and were immediately seated upon arrival. The waitress forgot to bring out the miso soup we ordered until our meal was half done. By then, we had to cancel the soup from our order. This place is right in Downtown Phoenix. They do not have a private parking lot.

Edameme was warm, and the crab salad was in roll form! Delicious! Real crab not the fake krab btw...Anyways my dinner date ordered a platter of sashimi including albacore tuna,salmon and yellowtail. I ordered a combo plate with 3 different rolls for only $15.00!! They all were fresh and tasty! They do use purple rice, do not be afraid it is perfectly fine! They also do not skimp on the portions of filling and the rice is not overwheming like most places.

I never felt like \"This could use a little of this/that\".Also... what is it about that purple rice? It's subtle, but I find it to be a superior vehicle for the fish to white rice. Maybe I drank the Kool-aid, but who cares? \u00a0I'm in!I encourage you to go. My stomach is literally growling as I write this review."], ["Taric W.", "Harumi is exactly what sushi should be. It's fast, yet high quality. Doesn't matter much what color the rice is, it has great consistency that doesn't take away from the quality of their rolls. Their fish is great as well. Very nice tuna. I am still blown away by how it was ready within 10 minutes of ordering, or how during the day you can just grab some to-go. It is inexpensive. Rolls start at $7, and perhaps the best deal is the $15 mini roll combo that nets you 15 morsels that aren't significantly smaller than other dishes and can easily feed two people. All in a setting that's casual, but still very comfortable. If you're ready to sacrifice a bit of sushi bar showmanship of larger establishments, Harumi is *the* place to go for a tasty dinner."], ["Lauren C.", "Harumi Sushi is by far my new favorite place to grab sushi here in the Valley. \u00a0I went with a group of 10 people, and not one person had a bad food experience.To start, the rice is purple. \u00a0Yes.....PURPLE! \u00a0Apparently, it is a black rice that turns purple once cooked and is filled with extra antioxidants and other components that are good for you. \u00a0And trust me, even if it wasn't good for me I'd still be asking for it. \u00a0I don't know what it is, but it is phenomenal!The dishes we shared were the Ahi Stack, Spicy Scallop roll, and Salmon Sashimi. \u00a0 Holy moly; the Ahi Stack was unlike anything I've ever eaten. \u00a0I thought it was a roll, but instead it is a mountain of ahi tuna, crab and spicy sauce on top of a mound of purple rice topped with fresh avocado and roe. \u00a0We inhaled it, and will definitely get it again. \u00a0And the salmon is the most buttery, fresh salmon I have ever had in the valley. \u00a0They top it with their homemade fresh wasabi, which was also fabulous!I docked 1 star because when we went to pay there was a lot of confusion and some people received their bills, some didn't, some didn't get their cards back for awhile.....it was a cluster, but definitely forgivable.If you love sushi, I definitely say run, Run, RUN to Harumi!!"], ["Alan C.", "Tried the Omakase for two. Fish is fresh, price is reasonable too at $35 pp, however I guess you get what you paid for -- only regular fish Nigiris are offered. \u00a0Your run of the mill salmon, tuna, hamachi, taka nigiris with salmon sashimi and tuna tataki. \u00a0Disappointed that I don't even get ikura sushi. $70 is leaning on the expensive side... Might try their rolls next time."], ["Jana B.", "Craving sushi, this was the answer in downtown Phoenix. My brother and I split many items, the highlights being the seaweed salad, fresh wasabi, yellowtail nigiri, tuna tataki and pink mochi (compliments of the chef!). The purple rice was interesting and, to be honest, I didn't think that it was too appealing. But, the taste was just the same as regular white rice to me. The chef was great and talked to us throughout the meal given that we were seated near the bar (the only place to really be at a sushi place!). This is worth a stop if you need to get your sushi fix."]]}
