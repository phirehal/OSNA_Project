It's almost impossible to find absolutely fantastic food in the airport like this food. \u00a0 \u00a0 Since none in my travel party had eaten, we walked in here for something small to eat before our flight. To our utter surprise the menu looked extremely appetizing. We all had breakfast items. I had the granola and they had egg dishes. The granola was yummy though a faster meal might be better if your in a hurry. It took me sometime to eat it all. It was a big bowl. \u00a0 \u00a0My friends Omelet was probably the best of all of our meals. The little bite I tried was nothing like you'd expect at an airport but fit the expectations you'd have at a french bistro. \u00a0 \u00a0 If your in Terminal 4 for a layover and have time to eat, try this spot.I'm going to go to the one in Scottsdale and hope they are just as good.

Well, you stop into Zinc Brasserie with your love, order up charcuterie, salad, sammies and Champagne and lose track of time. What do you do when this happens?

This Scottsdale institution has a surprisingly lovely \u00a0-- tin ceilings; cool lighting -- outpost in the airport, serving up some of their signature dishes and beverages with the same hospitality and flair as the original location.

They had a great selection of food that you don't see at airports (as in, you can actually find new dishes to try that you haven't had before). And the food is good! Its relatively decently priced.

I enjoyed a couple of 11.00 house glasses of wine while I charged my phone and ate. There are chargers all around the restaurant, pretty much at every table, which was awesome. The salad was ok, iceberg lettuce can only be so appetizing. The steak and dressing were tasty, it wasn't till I was almost done with the salad that I realized they hadn't put the crumbled blue cheese on it. Apparently they assumed if I couldn't have the dressing the cheese itself was also off limits. They brought me a little and I enjoyed it with the remainder of my salad.Salad was a good portion and about 16.00. Overall portions were good on both wine and food. Service good and very prompt.

Fairly forgettable (we didn't finish it, even splitting it between the two of us... well, wife could only have the ice cream). \u00a0Maybe pastry isn't their strong suit. \u00a0Overall, it's pricy because of the airport premium, and it's trying a bit too hard to be a \"bistro\" (which for some reason, makes people think they should charge 10% more). \u00a0And we didn't have to wait very long for our food, which is necessary in an airport. \u00a0I was pretty happy with my burger, \"frites\", and beer, and there were plugs available between the tables to top off the devices. 3.86 stars. \u00a0Which for an airport dining stop, is pretty darn good."], ["Josh H.", "This place is extremely over priced.

No water refills even though I drained mine in the first 30 seconds, no asking if we need anything else, It was a slow and painful experience. We had omelette, crepes, and zinc croissant. I am a fairly light eater but found myself still hungry after my zinc croissant (even after including the offensive FOUR DOLLAR upcharge for a single tomato slice). My husband was still hungry after his omelette and so both of us foraged on the ample remainder of our kids' crepes. The crepes were not good, but we were still hungry. Way too strong cinnamon flavor and just a funky taste with the creme fraiche. Will I be back next time I'm wasting time in terminal four at Sky Harbor? Sorry, no, this restaurant is a huge fat fail."], ["Cheryl R.", "Horrible sexism experienced in Zinc this evening when manager on duty refused to play women's FIFA and instead changed bar televisions to basketball regardless of several customer requests.

Yeah, it takes awhile for your order to be ready. But in the end, it's worth it. I've had their sandwiches several times, and they're always top-notch. The pork belly is a bit heavy, but if you have someone to split it with then it's just about perfect. And their fries will knock yours socks off... but chances are you have a spare pair in your luggage, so that shouldn't be a problem. If you have a bit of time between flights or before you take off, then you'd definitely do well to pay this place a visit.

The fig jam paired with green apple, little pieces of arugula gave it a nice sweet savory balance. I was a little indifferent about the bread. On one hand it was stable and didn't get soggy with all the sauce and junk..... Then it got to a point where it was just too much to handle.

Buttery, crisp perfection. I could have easily gobbled up three of these golden babies.The breakfast sandwich was a tad salty for my taste but is still a great choice.The eggs benedict were cooked very well but I thought the hollandaise was slightly lacking. I think it needs a tad bit more tanginess and a little bit more in portion. I actually had to ask for little bit extra on the side. I can see why locals love coming here. It's a really cozy and quaint place with super solid food.So why were we so incredibly upset at first?The group arrived at 10:30 am. We were not asked for our order till 11:00 am. The restaurant was NOT full. There was no line out there. They simply forgot about us. By 11:40 am (over an hour had passed since we were seated), we never received our food and tables that came just 15 mins ago (11:25 am) received their food. At that point, I was furious and the first server I approached had the utmost terrible response to me. There was no apology at all. Rather, she merely responded, \"Well, maybe you ordered something really special that took a long time to make.\" That response made no sense. I ordered a smoked salmon benedict. And timing of the gods couldn't have been better because right when she said this, I turned around and pointed to another patron ---she came in about 45 mins after us -- just got the exact dish I ordered. I pointed to the dish and said, \"My dish was not special. Oh look. There's the smoked salmon benedict that I ordered. That lady is already eating it and she came in 45 mins after us.\" I was floored. No apology. Nothing.As it turned out....our order was never put in and we'd already been patiently waiting for over an hour.The rest of the staff was really wonderful in trying to make up for the situation. They profusely apologized and even brought some free croissants. The chef even came out and apologized--not once--but twice! He even brought us out some homemade jam. We gladly accepted his sincere apology and forgave very quickly. I have to commend the chef and his staff (with the exception of that single server) for taking the time to make it up to us. In the end, it all worked out and I decided to give a review based 100% on the food, as opposed to the experience (which would have resulted in a 1 star review).

It takes her a few minutes to run back and state that their mussels ran out. That's fine, it happens. I went ahead and ordered the other special, Ahi sandwich. Which the waitress disappeared to put my order in. After about 15 minutes of waiting for our food, a different waitress came back and first states \"don't hate us, but we don't have that either.\" At this point, it was ridiculous. Why would it take you so long to realize there wasn't enough to Tuna?? Secondly, why would you include that in your special when you spoke with us if you're OUT? The communication from the kitchen to the wait staff was obviously lacking. Disappointing. Meal: Finally our sandwiches arrived. We both were starving and hoping for the food to at least be better than the service. NOPE. We both opt out of the salad for the fries. First off, the fries were cold. Like it was fried this morning and they were even too lazy to reheat. The sandwiches were SAD! It's was like a reheated school lunch! Come on!! I thought this is a French cafe....what happened? Oh and while we try to eat our lackluster sandwiches, nothing from the waitress to see how we're doing. ZERO. NOT A PEEP. No care at all. They stood there chatting away.

With a small menu they are able to perfect everything on it. I never left disappointed. The egg Benedict is one of the best that I ever tasted. I also love their breakfast sandwich. I want to try their dinner options."], ["Jon P.", "Was referred to this restaurant by a friend who raved about it. \u00a0We went in a few weeks ago on a Sunday and the place was just starting to fill up. \u00a0Wife loved the decor and it was quaint in a cool french cafe kind of way. \u00a0Had the egg sandwich on a croissant. Was absolutely delicious. \u00a0Served with a small size salad and some hash browns, it was a lot more food than I was expecting. \u00a0Wipe had the eggs Benedict, and they were good as well served with the same salad and hash browns.Croissants were amazing. \u00a0Only tried the butter, \u00a0but they had chocolate and another flavor or two which I can't recall right now. Word to the wise: get there early to get croissants as when we were there, \u00a0they sold out. \u00a0Also, it looks like it pays to know the owner and be a regular. Witnessed a customer come in, order croissants to go, followed by a regular who knew the owner and ordered those same croissants. \u00a0Since there was only a limited amount, \u00a0the person who had ordered to go and had already paid was denied half his order and the reasoning was someone had \"reserved\" the croissants before. \u00a0Sounds a little shady to me.Service could have been a bit quicker as we sat there for a good 5 minutes waiting to be served, \u00a0and then another 15 minutes waiting for our dishes to be cleared and for the bill. Will be back!"], ["Michelle M.", "I don't even know what makes the food so good here, but even the simple items are amazing. My husband and I had dinner and brunch here and both of us are continually blown away by the rich flavors of our dishes. The ice cream for dessert and again, the flavors!

I highly recommend this place for any meal, I've never been disappointed!"], ["Lexy K.", "We received a gift certificate as a wedding present, and we are so thankful we did. The food was simply amazing. The chef, Duc, is from France, & his French cooking is wonderful.

Don't get turned off by the older strip mall its in, its worth the stop.I am fortunate enough to live about 20 steps away from this restaurant. So I try and make it down at least once a week.My favorite dishes include:Mussels con frites- Enough to feed a family- no exaggeration. Literally, I shared with my family, ate it as my main course, and boxed up the rest for another meal. The broth is fantastic; I personally prefer a baguette over the fries, but overall an excellent dish.The almond croissant- INCREDIBLE, they make only a set amount in the morning so you get 'em while they're hot or until they're sold out. Its flaky and light with the perfect amount of sweetness- they truly melt in your mouth. Quiche with Spinach and goat cheese- simplistic and savory, my only wish was that it was larger. The crust on it was killer- served with a salad with house dressing (homemade ranch)Eggs Florentine- One of my favorite benedicts of all time, perfectly sized potions that won't leave you hungry or regretting your last few bites.French Toast - this was good, but definitely sweet- Its a bruleed version so it has a nice crust to it.Give this place a try, you won't regret. Perfect for a Sunday morning brunch!"], ["Ari A.", "Great small restaurant with an intimate setting. Everything is made to order and delicious"], ["Christina T.", "A bit of french heaven in the middle of the desert. We have been twice and both times food was delicious! The comments below on how service can be a bit slow makes me laugh - slow down, enjoy your food. It is typical in France for people to sit at a table for over 2 hours. We had a great experience however with the wait staff. The chef came out personally both times to greet us and ask about our orders. I am addicted to their crab cake burger, and I really want to try the boeuf bourguignon. The amount of food we received with our orders (most of us had sandwichs/ burgers and they were served with fries and a side salad) was very plentiful and I was unable to finish each time. They also have mussels and fries fresh in every Thursday - but he only orders a few so call in if you want to reserve an order! The deserts are all delicious and takes me right back to a real french boulangerie. I love that this little gem, it offers a tranquil ambience that you will not find in other typical restaurants.

A small restaurant in an unsuspecting shopping mall, Merci has made a great name for themselves. The staff always has a smile on their face, and genuinely seem like they have a passion for what they do. That passion is translated into a menu that is unique and delicious. My go to, the eggs royale, is one of the best eggs Benedict I've had. Only thing is they could add a little more of the sauce that comes on top. Also, the salad that comes on the plate is super yummy, but I wish it came on a separate plate. Too much going on in one space!

The burger was kind of bland and the mushrooms didn't taste like truffle or truffle oil. \u00a0The bun was interesting, but the bottom was soggy. \u00a0The truffled fries didn't taste of truffle at all. The small salad of greens and tomatoes was good. Unfortunately nothing about my burger with black truffles or my truffle fries tasted like truffle.My bill was over $18 with tax and over $22 with tip. \u00a0My food was not bad and the service was good, but lunch failed on a price-performance basis.I doubt I will be back."], ["Matthew S.", "Very quaint and cute. \u00a0Great place to get brunch on a Sunday. \u00a0The food was amazing, the pumpkin pancakes were the best pancakes I've ever had, seriously."], ["Kevin A.", "Cannot say enough good things about Merci.

Ok. 1st host comes back and our table is ready and 2nd host (Asian girl) who we've been with the whole time walks us back to the table inside which prompts me to ask \"So I take it this means we can't get a table outside?\" To which she says \"No\".

Their burgers are also good with a really thick patty of beef and the tuna salad sandwich actually comes out as four miniature open-face sandwiches. Points for presentation and taste.

It is small but nicely done. The prices are not too high, and I could see myself coming back to sit at their tables outside.This inside is dark and very bar like, yet hip & comfortable enough.

There is just not enough room on the tables and they have gigantic plates - not much thought put into that one.But in general it was nice, the food was good (not great) and the prices were not too crazy - although paying $10 for a \"large\" avian water is totally ridiculous!If you go, sit on the patio. It is a pleasant experience. They have mirrors, plants, misters/heaters and candles everywhere - really nicely done and has a romantic ambiance."], ["Chris B.", "Very happy with our dinner.

Really interesting mix of ingredients that you won't find anywhere else. A must-have: the truffle fries. They come w/ 3 different sauces, all to die for.

Hubby enjoyed his protein & foie combo, however the Madeira sauce was a bit too prevalent in the dish for me, but I was quite content with my own selection. The broth was divine and quality of mussels sourced from the great Washington coast added points to the dish for nostalgia (having called the Puget Sound area home for some years.)Reservations are a must for weekends and be prepared for intimate seating as I've enjoyed in many a Parisien bistros. I miss the selection along the rue Saint Martin but if I can't have Alain Ducasse in AZ, I'll continue to be a beggar and not a chooser!"], ["Edison O.", "You gotta give credit to those who deserves it and Zinc Bistro definitely deserves all the 5 stars. If I could, I would even rate them higher.My AZ restaurant week adventure took me and my wife to our second upscale restaurant in 3 days. Our taste buds took us to Zinc Bistro on a rainy Saturday night.From the outside, the bistro looked very ordinary. A simple restaurant sign, glass and wooden door, and some patio seating for the romantics. Nothing intimidating and nothing too fancy.Inside the bistro, it was different. You are immediately transported from AZ to NY. The place turns from ordinary to exciting. The vibe becomes alive. Unlike other upscale restaurants, this one is upscale but not a stuck-up. In fact, this one is quite inviting. I felt like I can laugh around my friends while enjoying my wine and enjoy some stories while not rushing my meals.Ambience... CHECK!We were greeted at the door, then the receptionist led us to our corner table. The usual. Nothing extra ordinary. Soon as we settled at our table and our server (Dylan) greeted us and gave us the menu, from there on, the service was quick, efficient and VERY attentive. I can't even remember when and who filled our glasses with water. I usually measure service by how attentive the staff is, if your glass of water is always full and ice cold, that means someone is always looking after your table. At Zinc, my glass was never empty. For me, that says a lot about their service. Our server (Dylan) was also at the top of his game. He made sure we our enjoying our food and also made sure we enjoy our experience by offering the best that they have. You always feel comfortable when servers approach your table with a smile. Service was simply EXCEPTIONAL...Service... CHECK!Ever had a meal that made you nod your head every time you take a bite? As if telling yourself that you made the right choice and you did a good job choosing the right meal. That's Zinc bistro food for you. You know you made right choice on every bite. We ordered the Smoked Duck Terrine and Pastrami Cured Salmon Burrata. The smoke duck terrine filled my mouth with all the texture you would look for. It had both a crunch and velvety bite from the terrine and pistachio. Also gave the salty flavor from the duck while balancing it out with the apricot and vinaigrette. You also get the freshness from the carrot and arugula as you mix all the component in one bite. The pastrami cured salmon on a burrata did not fall short as well. There perfect balance of texture with the burrata and salmon while you get the freshness from the roast beet and butter leaf salad. The appetizers alone made me nod on every bite. The main course was just CRAZY GOOD! The flat iron steak was perfectly cooked. The crust from the outside complimented the tender and juicy medium rare center. Make sure though that every slice you take has some caramelized shallot or else it might be too salty for your taste. The caramelized shallots balances the flavor to the sweet, salty and partly tangy perfect bite. My wife had the confit lamb shank. The lamb was so tender and the meat falls off the bone easily. It was perfectly complimented by the Beluga lentils, medjool dates, roasted turnips and crushed almonds. Again, the texture and flavor was well balanced. We also loved the slight touch of the crema fresca that cut through the gaminess of the lamb. If you hate lamb, this meal might just change your mind.Lastly, the dessert. I alway want my dessert to be sweet but not overly sweet. I want it to make me feel like it satisfied my sweet tooth without making me like I ate a whole box of cake. We had the brown butter cookie w/ peanut butter nougat and salted caramel. It was a very sexy Snickers bar on a plate. When eaten w/ small bites of mint leaves, it takes the sexy snickers over the top. We also had the grilled pineapple tarte tatin w/ toasted tahini and cardamon ice cream. The cardamon ice cream cuts through the tanginess of the pineapple. Since the pineapple was grilled, the natural sweetness of the pineapple comes out. Oh and the chocolate souffl\u00e9 ( their top dessert ) is a must have. How was it? It was so good that only tasting it on your own can explain the experience.Food... CHECK!Overall, it was a perfect experience. Which is worth the money you are shelling out. The food was awesome. The service was exceptional. The place was alive and inviting. Truly deserving of a 5 star.more reviews at themealexperience.blogsp\u2026"], ["Jaclyn M.", "Wow. Just happened by this place with my friends.

Even when I was stuffed I had to keep eating! Artichoke and hummus app was so good I took leftovers home! Waitress was very nice. Saw I was torn on what bread to pick so she surprised me! I was to go back today and tomorrow just to try everything else! Open a store on the west side! In Litchfield park please!!!!"], ["My N.", "I REALLY DON'T KNOW what the hype is all about. I came here with my husband expecting good food, good service, and a clean restaurant. I'm very OCD when it comes to cleanliness of a restaurant. I always inspect my cups, plates, and forks before I ever use it at a restaurant.STRIKE 1- My husband's water cup had a very visible and distinct LIPSTICK stain on it. The outline of the person's lip was still there! We informed the waiter, he looked embarrassed, and gave us a 'new' cup.STRIKE 2- The 'new' cup the waiter gave us still had lipstick stains on it... but it was much smaller. We're not sure if he just wiped off the first one, or if many of the cups are this disgusting.STRIKE 3- My OWN cup had food debris on the inside portion where my lips would have been. I flicked it off with my nail and finger.. and was so disgusted. Both of us didn't drink a sip of water the whole time there.STRIKE 4- My plate had visible and distinct food debris on it. I wiped it off with the napkin... my husband gave me his plate to use. I had enough of this 'yucky-ness', so when my food came, I literally ate over my napkin.Now for the food, we ordered the Bruschetta and Nine Iron Panini. You get to choose 4 flavors for the Bruschetta. We tried Smoked Salmon with Pesto.... Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato... Salami with Pesto... and something else I don't remember. Visibly appealing. Too bad it doesn't taste as good as it looks. I'm not saying its nasty, it is just not 'all that.' The bread wasn't as crunchy as I thought it should be. The bread was more... chewy than anything else. My favorite out of the 4 we got was the Bacon one.The Nine Iron Panini was just okay. Thick bread, nice portion, but nothing I would get again.CONCLUSION- If they were more clean, I would maybe give them a 3 out of 5 tops. But seriously, who wants to eat that dirty? WILL NOT BE GOING BACK."], ["Ricky D.", "In the distant past, when the dinosaurs roamed the earth, I disliked bruschetta: it was a difficult-to-eat food, heavy on the bread carbs, with nothing but watery tomatoes on top. Postino's has enlightened me: their bruschetta is absolutely amazing! The ingredients are so fresh! It's delicious! It's easy to eat! But I'm getting ahead of myself...My mom and I came here, lured by the rave Yelp reviews, while on a road trip through Phoenix. My mom ordered a glass of cava, which she liked, and we started off with a plate of bruschetta (four flavors for $14). My favorite was the salmon, pesto, and capers - the pesto is fresh and exciting, and the whole combination makes for the perfect mix of savory flavors! My mom's favorite was the mascarpone, fig, and prosciutto, which was both sweet and a little bit savory. We also got the artichoke bruschetta (great depth of flavor- absolutely delicious!), and the traditional tomato-basil-mozzarella bruschetta (the tomatoes were fresh and to die for). Everything was amazing. Each bruschetta is cut into four pieces, so they're non-messy to eat and easy to trade. The ingredients were so fresh, and so capably combined! I absolutely loved everything. I almost wish I lived in Phoenix.After we had the bruschetta we realized we were hungrier than we thought, so we got the white bean and artichoke dip plate as well as a bowl of chicken dumpling soup. I got to have more of the artichoke dip, and the white bean dip was very good as well. What I loved even more than the bruschetta (I know, how is that possible!) was the atmosphere. We sat on the 'outside' part of the restaurant, and it was just perfect for relaxing, talking, and sharing the finger food. The whole atmosphere is relaxed and fun. DON'T MISS!"], ["Steve R.", "First Timer. What a great experience.The food was delicious. More on the light weight side, Paninis and items like that. Had lunch there today. The service was right on target. The place was nice and full, but not overflowing. The lemonade I had was the best lemonade on the planet. Had a Cucumber taste to it. Pricewise, I believe was fair. This was just an overall pleasant experience, worthy of repeat visits. Can't wait to come again. Very nice job folks.

As for the bruschetta, we had the fig and asparagus with mascarpone which was my second favorite. First fave was the salmon with capers! Salmon was perfectly smoked and melted in my mouth. Yum! Others to try that were delish, the white bean (packs a little punch), artichoke spread, Brie with apples and one with tomatoes and bacon. I'm sure we had more than this but I can't remember exactly.

My fave was the burrata, bacon, arugula & tomato bruschetta. And we tried the tempranillo cause it was one of the more expensive bottles but I loved it! My sister usually gets a whole bruschetta and bottle of wine to herself but I think sharing was fine for us.

The stuffed chicken was great because there was a lot of crab meat. The lemon added a great zesty and fresh flavor to the moist chicken. The filet mignon was very tender and was cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered. The stew was a bit bland but the cornbread made a nice accompaniment.

The after school special cocktail was my favorite one because you got the side of beer in a can so it was the most bang for your buck. It was also the most refreshing to me The cocktails were about $10-12 each. Our waiter was extremely friendly, helpful and awesome. They have \"daily specials\" that aren't actually daily (only Thursday-Sunday). The decor here is really awesome and trendy. They have private rooms that you can rent out and also a larger dining area that has plaid booths. They have cool chalk art on the wall and a pretty snazzy bathroom with nice tiles (if anyone cares).

That's why its under a fire, cause soon when it gets room temperature, it hardened up. \u00a0Not impressed at all, but if you like Velveeta, you might like their fondue. \u00a0The meat and cheese board was a joke, and the hummus was bland. \u00a0The main course arrived. \u00a0Since I had a horrible experience with my last fish and Chips (The Codfather) I felt I needed something to redeem my last experience. \u00a0The fish and chips were pretty good. \u00a0I requested some tartar sauce, not this ranch cr*p they gave me and malt vinegar, but it never arrived. \u00a0So I just ate it plain.

Upon finding our seats, we were immediately greeted by our friendly server who brought an unexpected starter basket of warm hot pretzels with cheese and a basket of fried shrimp w/fried peppers and a zesty dipping sauce. We had a preset menu choice of salmon w/veggies (Brussel sprouts); beef; or chicken stuffed with crab & a veggie side. For dessert, we had the choice of salted caramel pudding or pumpkin cheesecake w/compote.I went with the salmon and pumpkin cheesecake and SO glad I did. I really hope this is available to any of you on the main menu because it's something worth coming here for. Also, don't expect to overeat as the portions were typical of a high end dining experience. I didn't think seafood in the desert could ever be so good. The glaze and char marks were perfect to my pallette. I'm a huge fan of brussel sprouts, especially ones with a little char and was happy to see halves in the vegetable mix under the salmon (I only wish there was a little more). The pumpkin cheesecake was served in a mini jam-like jar with the cheesecake part on the bottom, fruit on top and crumbled crust on top. Needless to say, it was love at first bite. I kindly shared in exchange for a bite of the salted caramel pudding which was also good but nothing in comparison from my point of view.The restaurant was packed of what seemed like diners happy to be enjoying the experience there.

Nothing quiet finishes off a meal like a desert of pretzel fondu, so I recommend that for desert as well.

We had the salmon dish which we could get anywhere else. We also tried the beef short rib stew. I counted 4 small chunks of beef in the whole pot. It's more of a vegetable stew. \u00a0The blueberry cheesecake was yummy. Third, the service was rushed and robot like. \"Get'm in. Get'm out\". All in all, we will NOT be coming back.

Unfortunately, both my husband and I thought the food was okay - not amazing. I ordered off of the Restaurant Week menu so my meal came with an appetizer, entree and dessert. The tabbouli salad was nothing like typical middle eastern tabbouli (still not sure why they called it that) but it was good and flavorful. The portion of the salad was huge and I was able to share it with the entire table. For entree, I ordered the crab stuffed chicken. To me, it was a little dry and the flavors weren't amazing. My husband ordered the scallops on the regular menu and although the portion was a nice size, he didn't care for the flavor. His dish came with bacon wrapped sweet potatoes and green beans, which I thought were the best part. The salted caramel pudding dessert was by far my favorite part of the dining experience and I would definitely come back for that again.

I go around Phoenix and Scottsdale and try other restaurants (e.g.: Citizen Public House, St Francis, The Mission etc) but I keep coming back to my first love (The Arrogant Butcher) ;) This is definitely in my top three favorite restaurants of all time, and my favorite American restaurant,no doubt. Appetizers: I LOVE their cheese and meat plate. The cherry marmalade that comes with it pairs up perfectly with the cheeses and the meat. My favorite cheese are the cypress grove and the prairie breeze (I found both of these at AJs and can't be happier). The Black mussels are my favorite as well. The butterly/garlic sauce it comes with is so so so so good. I could eat it with absolutely anything.Entrees: I used to order the NY strip but unfortunately, they have gotten rid of it so the next best thing is the grilled ribeye. The succotash and creamy horseradish is what makes this dish AMAZING. My boyfriend always gets the burger which he said is the best burger he has ever had. I've had the jambalaya for lunch before which I thought was just okay, but maybe that's because I was never really a fan of jambalaya.Dessert: Their award winning salted caramel pudding.

He also wanted to make sure that we weren't in a hurry. We weren't (which turned out to be a good thing).I started with the \"Old Old Fashioned\" cocktail ($11), a very traditional blend of Angel's Envy Reserve bourbon and angostura with orange and lemon peel. Other tried \"The Pink Drink\" ($9) -- vodka, grand mariner, lemon sour, and cranberry bitters -- which was pronounced \"quite sweet.\" The Arrogant 85 ($9) was a surprisingly refreshing combination of gin, aperol, St. Germain, and sparkling wine, served in a champagne glass. It was a nice combination for a warm Phoenix evening.On the appetizers menu, we tried the house soft pretzels and provolone fondue ($10) \u00a0-- round-shaped pretzel bread to dip into the smooth, rich cheese sauce that were a hit with everyone at the table. The zucchini fritters ($8) were light and fluffy and the parmesan aioli was a perfect salty/creamy addition.My entree was the beef short rib stew ($18), made with plenty of green chiles and white beans, served with a knob of cornbread for crumbling into the spicy, flavorful broth. The stew was topped with a fried egg which added creaminess and texture into the stew.My sweetie got the Sweet Potato Tortelli ($15), made with mushrooms, spinach, and hazelnuts in a butter sauce. He added a blacked chicken breast to make it a hearty, rich meal.Other favorites at the table were the scallops ($25), served with bacon-wrapped sweet potato, peas, and marcona almonds in a brown butter vinaigrette, a petite portion but full of flavor. The steaks ($36 for the filet and $35 for the New York Strip) were prepared traditionally and given a thumbs-up.The warm peanut butter cup dessert ($6) was almost a sweet peanut butter soup, served with a scoop of chocolate gelato in the center of the bowl with two cookies alongside. The Salted Caramel pudding ($6) was ridiculously rich and delicious...and tasted of nothing but salted caramel. Fabulous.The service was friendly throughout and our waiter was even able to handle separate checks on the big group. That said, it was an hour from the time we were seated until our entrees came out -- clearly the kitchen was having some difficulties.

Pretzels: yes, just get them. Perfectly cooked and brined, and that provolone has a flavor something of magic. If you can't go for some German bread paired with Swiss/Italian/French melted cheese, well, that's just un-American. Montchevre: still not a fan of goat cheese. My friend liked it quite well, however. Roasted beet salad: surprisingly amazing! \u00a0I'm not a huge food risk taker, but I do consider myself a foodie, and I'm trying to take more risks with my palette. This was just perfectly combined: roasted beet for a base (first time eating beets, do it here. It was mine, too), Brussel sprouts for depth, pistachios for crunch, prosciutto and accompany sauce for flavor and pomegranates for balance. Seriously, so well dreamed up. I'll definitely be getting it again. Sweet potato tortelli: not usually a huge sweet potato fan, but I also really loved this. The mushroom and spinach balanced the sweet potato along with the lemon butter type sauce. \u00a0The hazelnuts added a touch of flare and texture. So good!Cubano: such an interesting sandwich with deli thin ham slices alongside smoked pork, topped in a cheddar cheese, (usually Swiss), and had a bit of a kick in flavor. Served in a sturdy folded bread like a panini, I'd say. It was good, but compared to the other items we've had, it's a little forgettable. Turkey pastrami: that's what good turkey tastes like. First time trying it as a pastrami, but had same flavoring without feeling heavy. The coleslaw was crunchy and had a great sauce inside. The pretzel bun was perfectly portioned not to overwhelm the sandwich. Suggest eating it upside down to allow the ingredients to soak into the top bun as well. Supposedly their best selling sandwich, and I'd have to say, I'm not surprised and would definitely order it again. Stroganoff: the handmade egg noodles were brilliantly made and perfectly cooked al dente. \u00a0The peas tasted fresh and added a little sweetness to a savory dish. The chicken was so tender and flavorful. Never had a chicken stroganoff, but once again the bird made it feel like a lighter meal without sacrificing the savory element you expect from a stroganoff. Just enough sauce, not swimming. Filled with mushrooms - great flavor. Grilled ham and cheese and chicken tenders - predictable, but well received by the kiddos. Fries: sandwiches both came with it - wasn't expecting that. Awesome crisp with soft and airy interior. Cooked in truffle oil? \u00a0Something, because they had a different, but yummy flavor. \"Hot chocolate\" cake: made Swiss miss hot cocoa. Pictures something sweet, but it was more of a rich chocolate cake. Almost a brownie flavor with more of a lighter texture (oddly enough, like a soggy cake texture, but in a good way). Cheesecake: who would have thought pumpkin with pomegranate, but that should just be a permanent thing, since it works so darn well. The cheesecake was lighter and fluffier than a traditional cheesecake, but still good. Topped with a pomegranate seed compote - so good. Finished with some granola style crumble - again, so good. Winter seasonal dessert - switches to blueberry in the summer months. Desserts are $6 and are on the smaller side, but still enough to share and portioned in a size that even after a meal, you can make room to share one or a couple. Will be trying the warm peanut butter cup (should have fought harder to try that) and salted caramel pudding in a few weeks (voted best dessert in Phoenix recently). Definitely a new favorite for when we find ourselves in town."], ["Marianne S.", "Fantastic service, but the food is nothing special.

There were about 8 of us, and we were lucky enough to be seated in the semi-private booth/banquette area in the back, and fortunate enough to be treated to lovely service throughout our visit. The atmosphere is so cool and definitely not what an out-of-towner who is clearly out-of-touch with how downtown Phoenix has changed was expecting. Our local person, who brought us here, explained that all of the Fox Restaurant Concepts locations have a slick vibe without coming across as contrived.While the name \"Arrogant Butcher\" might imply an overabundance of cured meats on the menu, I was happy to see that there were many fresh options as well, for both the vegetarians as well as the non-salami eaters. We overlooked the appetizer menu (although I've heard the pretzels with provolone fondue are amazing) and went right for the cheese and charcuterie boards, passing those around the table as we enjoyed our drinks. There's a healthy selection of hosue-crafted cocktails and a nice wine selection, but the on-draught beers are lacking a bit. To accompany your meats-and-cheese boards, there are many \"Extras\" you can add for a well-rounded experience, such as Marcona almonds, cornichons, peppers, etc. It's a great way to have a more social appetizer with your group as you wait for entrees.While meat-based mains range from seafood to ribs to chicken to New Zealand Sea Bass, there's also a nice selection of vegetarian items, such as Sweet Potato Tortelli. Personally, I opted for one of their big entree salads, and was really happy with the Tabbouleh Salad. My coworkers raved about the NZ Sea Bass, the Short Ribs, the Pork Carnitas, and the signature AB Cheeseburger.Their desserts are also worth the cost of admission and the calories. We shared one of each of the 4 desserts; each item is $6 and a nice portion. My personal favorite was the Warm Peanut Butter Cup with chocolate gelato.Definitely a cool, hip spot for small groups with varying tastes and varying budget per diems, but also a nice spot for when someone else is footing the bill!"], ["Rene A.", "Yes! \u00a0I think most people eat out for food alone.

We decided to check this place out for lunch based on all the yummy looking photos on yelp, however, we didn't realize there was a different menu for lunch. Though the lunch menu items looked good, we had our eyes set on the Crab Stuffed Chicken dish on the dinner menu, and our waiter made I happen for us! I'm so glad he went above and beyond to ask the kitchen to accommodate us, because we were not disappointed! The chicken had a crisp breading and was stuffed with just the right amount of crab in the center. The cream sauce with capers was light and tasty, though next time I'd ask for some extra sauce. Also, most restaurants don't have Super Tuscan wines by the glass, especially for $10. Huge plus!"], ["Daniel R.", "NY Strip and Prime Rib were done right. Service was good.

I am a huge fan of the Moscow mule and was happy to see it on the happy hour bar menu. However, watching the bartender make it I knew it wouldn't be very good. They use a cocktail mix and add vodka. It was very heavy on lime juice an almost undrinkable. I ordered the short rib stew for dinner and it was decent, not much short rib in it. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. Other people seemed to be enjoying their food. Maybe I will give it another try next time I make it to town."], ["Jennifer B.", "The food and drinks are fantastic. And the happy hour deals are phenomenal. Unfortunately, our server, Meagan, certainly put the \"arrogant\" in Arrogant Butcher. She was nasty to our whole party from the moment we sat down. A table for 14 people, and when asked for more than one happy hour menu, it was a huge inconvenience to her. She was unfriendly the whole time, and specifically told us we couldn't move seats if we wanted our checks to be correct. It was a social visit with people getting up throughout the evening! And when it came time to pay our individual bills, she refused to take my credit card TWICE because she would only take EVERYONE'S payments at one time. Finally I told her I was wanting to leave and she begrudgingly took my payment. If it weren't for her, I'd be returning soon."], ["Jill H.", "Went here for Happy Hour and they have some really good deals! Check out the HH menu on their site.

Happy hour ends at 6pm, so I enjoyed two $5 mules after we were seated at 5:15pm. Great start. Absolutely loved the outstanding beef short rib green chile stew with the fried egg on top and the side of olives. The chopped salad was okay and the roasted peppers were bland.

I would be arrogant too.. for good reason! \u00a0I would absolutely come back here again and would love to try a main course!"], ["Vicki N.", "Went to the arrogant butcher last night as a belated birthday dinner with my love. Had a somewhat difficult time getting there, its on a one way street, we parked at the garage underneath the location. Thankfully they validated parking. Inside is decorated like TGI Fridays, looks very casual dining to me, but the prices don't reflect the casual atmosphere. He ordered the Thursday special which was fried chicken and biscuit. He seemed to like it although he didn't eat it all, he ate all the coleslaw but there was half a chicken breast and a chicken leg leftover as well as half the biscuit. I personally didn't love the honey drizzled over the lightly battered chicken skin. I guess that's an acquired taste.I had the filet mignon which for $36 should not have been dry like it was . I did order it medium well, but that usually leaves me with a little moistness. Despite being dry it was very tasty. I liked the potatoes and creamed spinach that came with it. I absolutely loved the cocktail that I ordered called Butchers Blood and Sand. The waitress asked me what kind of drinks I usually like and I told her that lately I've been drinking Manhattans. She said I would probably like this drink and she was correct. It came like a martini and it had a wonderful unique creamy and sweet flavor, not as strong as a Manhattan but delicious none the less. It includes pigs nosed scotch, cherry heering, Carpano Antica, orange juice, clove and orange bitters. We had no room in our belly for dessert. My server was very good about checking up on us and making sure we enjoyed our dinner. Overall I would give this place a 3.5 maybe cause I was looking for something a little more formal and partly because my meat was dry.This was not a cheap meal it came to $96 including tip for 2 people."], ["Misty F.", "I had always seen the sign for this place when I was in Phoenix and I loved the name. Finally got a chance to stop in for a bite. It was a Friday night and it took about 15 minutes to get a seat but the hostesses were great at getting everybody's name entered in to receive a text when a table was ready. The atmosphere and decor is super warm with all of the candles on the tables. We ended up eating on the patio area because it was a nice evening and an event was just letting out which allowed for some great people watching.The waiter recommended the pretzel fondue which I was totally ok with because I adore pretzels and cheese. It came out ridiculously fast which almost made me wonder if someone had cancelled their order of the pretzels and cheese because the cheese had a touch of a skin on it and the waiter kind of stuttered a weird little apology about how sometimes they have them right there and ready to go.We enjoyed a couple of local beers that were on tap and dove right in to the pretzel fondue. The pretzel bites were delicious while the cheese was just merely satisfactory. The only thing is, as I was eating the pretzels, I was still perusing the menu and started to become full. I was debating whether or not to even get an entree. When the waiter came back, I asked him about entrees that were on the small side but I also told him I was considering the pork carnitas or maybe just ordered a side or a salad. He ensured me that the carnitas were on the small side so I would be just fine. I realize in retrospect that a waiter is always going to have you go for the more expensive option to have your bill increase (along with their tip). When the carnitas came out, they were actually a decent sized entree. Some of the bulk did come from the cabbage slaw that was piled about 3 inches high on the two corn cakes. I was so full that I only took about two bites and had to ask for a to-go box. My review on my entree was eating it the next day. My next-day pork carnitas were delicious. I really enjoyed the slight sweetness of the corn cake and I felt like I could eat just those by themselves. I liked the combinations of all of the flavors although the cabbage slaw was on the excessive side. I also had a weird bite where I swear that there was an errant walnut, which must have fallen in. My dining partner had a burger and I believe that he was sufficiently satisfied with his burger for the evening. Overall, the food was decent and the staff were very efficient and friendly in all of their interactions. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the location of this place."]], "Province Urban Kitchen & Bar": [["Jenni I.", "A couple of friends and I came here to meet up with a couple of people from a conference we just went to.

I ended up ordering the A.M. Pork Carnitas. The meat was cooked very well and was a bit salty but still very tasty.

Simple materials cook hot inside but nothing burnt outside. Adding a bit Tabasco, it's my welcoming breakfast for an energetic day to go.Second recommendation is their Smoothie - [Kale, spinach, banana, mango, and cinnamon] This is really what I call power food that boost your morning drill.

The restaurant is quite pretty, with natural and modern elements well fused, big floor to ceiling windows which let in light, and a nice little patio with a fire feature. I had the black bean burger which just...wasn't that good. The house made patty was very thick but also very dry and flavorless. Yes, it tasted like black beans, but I think some cumin, garlic, and spices would have gone a long way. The menu mentioned it was served with chipotle aioli, but mine was missing, and I didn't want to interrupt my conversation with flagging down a waiter and getting it fixed.

The music is loungey and ambient which makes for a really cool space, and the staff are top-notch servers whom you can tell are held to a high standard. I don't know if I would bring small kids or babies here; I know they're welcome (they have highchairs and I've seen them there) but the vibe is really laid back so small children might be a bit out of place.What I've had and would most recommend:The Meatloaf is probably my favorite menu item, and the au gratin potatoes are the best I've had.The French Onion Soup is awesome and flavorful!The salmon is delicious as wellThey have awesome cocktails too!Definitely check out Vogue if you're in the mood for something nicer on the west side :)"], ["Kevin M.", "Had to try again this year... but again disappointed with thier take on the traditional turkey meal...Way to much dark meat..the soup was cold...the deserts were pretty to look at but lacked the taste u loved from its presentation.. coffee exceptional again.. wait staff outstanding..

Chef Aurore has trained in France. We placed our order and waited around a half hour for our lunches. I do have to give our waiter credit for spotting that my husband's request to omit the aioli for his sandwich was ignored by the cook. The waiter gives my husband the choice of eating it anyway or getting a new one made with his request of no aioli. My husband wanted a new one so we waited maybe another half hour while my salad is sitting in the window all this time getting warm and wilted.Our plates arrive and as warm and slightly wilted as my salad is the salad was masterfully made and very layered with flavors. The creamy shallot vinaigrette was so delicious I could drink it and I never tasted walnuts that were so complex before. I also need to add that the house smoked salmon might have been the most delicious buttery fresh salmon I've ever had anywhere. However the house baked bread that came with it came out and seemed stale and not so tasty. Unfortunately the cooks that were on don't take to re-fires very well and inflicted something on the pork in my husband's sandwich. The pork was very dry and was drier than dog food jerky. The pork suffered something like rigor mortis it was deader than dead.Our waiter seemed busy and didn't ask how our meals were but offered us a complimentary dessert because of the aioli mess up and how long we waited for everything. (he didn't even know about the pork)I picked the house made chocolate collection. It was an assortment of chocolates that were obviously very high quality. They were extremely good.This should have been a five star review but lunch shouldn't take two hours, meal request should be honored and I have nothing more to say about the pork as I said enough. I do note I didn't see Chef Aurore in the building. Also the 4 star rating seems high after everything mentioned but some of the food was so masterfully done I can't give a lower than 4 star rating and chalk this up to them having a bad day.PHENOMENAL and ABOMINABLE"], ["Bill H.", "We love Vogue Bistro.

The portion size was perfect and the salmon also came in an amazing champagne cream sauce. I had a taste of the roasted chicken and it was so moist and perfectly seasoned.

On an impromptu date night, my beau and dressed up and headed to the fanciest place in Surprise, Vogue Bistro. We arrived around 7pm and were seated immediately. Our waitress was wonderful and the service was great. However the drinks were OKAY.My beau got an Old Fashion while I indulged in a Prada Martini. The Old Fashion was watered down and not very good. The Prada Martini was good but nothing spectacular.For dinner we order the Steak Vogue and the Roasted Chicken. The chicken seasoned well and not dry. The carrots and potatoes were nicely roasted and complimented nicely. However, the steak was not good. It was bland and cooked medium rare, while he had asked for it to be medium. Beau barely ate a quarter of it. The fries that came with it however were very good. I'd hate to give this place a 3 star review since it's so well received in the community, but it just didn't live up to expectations. Better luck next time."]], "Cuisine and Wine Bistro": [["David L.", "Wow what a place! The service is great and friendly! The food is reasonably priced for the portions and the quality.

After reading other reviews, we were very excited to try the Bistro. It's close to home, has a nice atmosphere with live music and friendly servers. All great, but unfortunately the food just missed the mark for us. The Ribeye with chipotle butter (authentic french cuisine?) was flavorless, fatty and looked large, but thin on the plate. The Filet de Porc, Sauce Bleu et Bacon sounded amazing, but lacked the rich complex flavor you would expect. My wife did not eat more than 1/3 of the ribeye and we commented to the server she did not like it and the server replied \"Oh, I'm very sorry, would you like a box?\" Not the response I was expecting.Anyways we really wanted to like the Bistro, but it just wasn't the dining experience we had hoped for."], ["Paul M.", "A wonderful experience.

My husband and I were looking for a new, romantic, chill place to try and this restaurant fully delivered. \u00a0Our waitress was very friendly and helpful (with a delightful French accent), we took her recommendations and split the goat cheese salad and the filet mignon and they were both very satisfying. \u00a0The bread that came with the salad, combined with the warm goat cheese and lemon-honey sauce, was very delicious. \u00a0The steak was very tender & cooked perfectly, however I found the flavor to be slightly less bold than I'm used to in filet mignon. \u00a0It was still very edible though, and came with delicious fries and a warm, bread-crumb encrusted tomato. \u00a0My husband enjoyed their Chilean Pinot Noir, I decided to pass on the wine \u00a0(mostly out of budget consideration, not for lack of selection). \u00a0We also very much enjoyed the live music which was a female vocalist with a beautiful voice who seemed to mostly be doing covers but was very talented (& it was not too loud or distracting but fit the atmosphere perfectly). \u00a0This has definitely made one of our new favorites!"], ["Jim S.", "In a word, sublime...it's one of those rare gems. \u00a0This place is French-family-owned, and it shows. \u00a0From the greeting and excellent service, to the incredible depth of flavor and attention to detail on every food item, this place hits the mark consistently. \u00a0Having lived in New York most of my life and eaten in many French restaurants, and having visited France and eaten French food from several different regions of the country, this is the real deal. \u00a0If you don't like the food here, you don't like French food."], ["Pat J.", "LOVE this new place! The escargot appetizer was succulent and rich, the meatballs were light and tasty with the mint yogurt sauce. For the entrees, too often salmon in the valley is plain, this was complex, with a wonderful sauce and saut\u00e9ed onions and peppers. The quiche Lorraine had a wonderful, flakey crust and rich flavor, complemented by a mixed green salad with light balsamic dressing. The Belgian chocolate souffl\u00e9 was heaven on earth. All complemented with excellent wines.

The food and the restaurant has a French influence, but this is not just a French restaurant/bistro. We had three of their appetizers, so we had to skip the main course. Two of the current main courses, a ribeye dinner and grilled salmon salad looked wonderful.Our bruschetta was one of the best I have ever had, with the bread very light and perfectly toasted to allow all the toppings to come through. Another appetizer, the goat cheese with toasted bread had a very generous serving of tasty goat cheese. The only thing not cooked to 100% of my liking was the meatballs and mint sauce. The mint sauce was wonderful, but the meatballs seemed a bit overcooked for my taste.They frequently have live music, although we left before they started (we came in early during the happy hour pricing)We will return."], ["Tony L.", "We truly enjoyed this place and will definitely be back.

Not really sure what \u00a0was all about.I started off with a wilted spinach salad. It was delicious. The preparation for the salad takes place table side where they saute the bacon in a pan then cover the spinach with the hot pan so that the spinach becomes wilted.My main course was Eastern scallops. The scallops look to be flashed in a little bit of flower and they were delicious. The homemade au gratin potatoes came along with it as a side and the steamed vegetables were perfect.

The menus are held together with scotch tape and the decor is reminiscent of someone's rec room. The music was on a short forty five minute loop. We were not offered coffee even though we had ordered souffl\u00e9s with dinner. We had to flag a server down and ended up asking twice for our simple two coffee order. It's painfully obvious that no one has trained the staff. What may have once boasted fine French service and cuisine is now an incredibly overpriced, mediocre, sad and old restaurant. I can't possibly recommend this establishment to anyone."], ["Alejandra T.", "The food is excellent!...nice private place.

The food took a while to get to our table, but they are coking your food WHEN you order it, good food takes time, i say plan for at least couple of hours when you are here, to us the company was so nice we didn't even noticed the wait, get a nice glass (or bottle) of wine and enjoy the company...The decor is somewhat dated, but it adds charm to the place, made me feel like I was visiting my aunt's house for a special occasion. to start we ordered the Caesar salad and it was prepared at our table I had a little taste and it was very good, but I had to have the onion soup (Soupe A L'oignon Gratinee) it was perfect, not too salty with some color, not black, \u00a0the cheese perfectly melted and not overpowering the onion.For the main course we shared the Filet Mignon for two ordered medium and that is what we got, melt in your mouth good, it came with a delicious tomato stuffed with a mushroom cap, scalloped potatos were creamy but not cheesy and best of all was a B\u00e9arnaise Sauce it completed the meal perfectly.Our friends got Sole De Dover Belle Meuniere, with the spines taken out by our table he absolutely loved it and she got the Petit Poulet best chicken she's ever had.And for the grand finale we had ordered the Grand Marnier souffle when we started (thanks to the yelp reviews) absolutely worth the wait...The chef was with us for a few minutes and told us the place was rented for about a year to somebody who made changes people didnt like and Louis got it back.

Vincent's is classy, dark, and ambient. It feels European with its small wood tables and chairs, paintings and prints, and emphasis on quality over quantity, both in regards of food as well as service. Our server was extremely nice and accommodating. She hooked us up with Wifi (worked very well) because for some reason there is virtually zero T-mobile signal there. She and her colleague were always there to make sure we had everything we needed and our glasses always full, but never pestering or overbearing. She even recommended AGAINST a menu item one of us was considering, something I've very rarely experienced. Usually servers sugar coat everything. The food was very good, high quality and clearly made with love. I had the lamb chops which were perfect. They came with \u00a0small sides of potato gratin and asparagus. Very simple, classy, and delicious. The portions were very small which is to be expected from a French-inspired place like Vincent's but maybe they could give patrons just a little bit more. The wild boar one of my colleagues ordered looked equally delicious and she said she loved it. For desert we tried the Grand Marnier creme brulee which was basically just creme brulee on top of 2 shots of Grand Marnier (pass unless you really, really love Grand Marnier).

Well this was a bad idea... especially on an anniversary dinner celebration. Please be advised that the bad reviews are indeed true. We have eaten the food through their catering and it is delicious, so this makes me think all the energy is expelled here alone? Like the other reviews had said this is a creepy outdated awkward place that doesn't have any background music playing at all. So yes the tables are very close together with no music so imagine how uncomfortable that will be. We immediately ordered martinis to try and ease the mood. My dirty martini was garnished with tiny olives on a sandwich pick for an upscale price. The server also spilled most of my wife's martini during her trip to the table saying how it was \"overfilled.\" We received a basket of bread that was burnt and unappealing which ended our idea of a maybe hopeful outcome. We were both confused because the dinner menu was nothing like we had eaten through catering. The server informed us that we had probably meant to dine at the \"bistro,\" and was happy to transfer us over next door. Feeling questionable that it would be any better we paid our tab and agreed to go take a table they were holding for us. We then walked over to the bistro side of the restaurant only to be disappointed once again. \u00a0Packed in like a meat house and sat there for 15 minutes without being asked if we'd like a drink we decided to walk out. They have again an awkward system of seat yourself and apparently serve yourself as well? We were so confused by all the groups of people lining outside to get in this place. We were more than willing to give up our table to the next unfortunate guest. The parking lot is also a joke like a previous person had reviewed. It is only valet and gets backed up by the cars coming in and the one attendant trying to run the place.

What is the cleanliness in the kitchen? We had the tamales which was \u00a0dry and the fois gras which was good. The squash was excellent and the spinach salad was excellent but way overdressed. We also had the lobster and basil pasta, the lobster was chewy and the pasta had good flavor but vastly overdressed with oil or butter. My lamb was very good, except that lighting a rosemary twig for no purpose except to fill the room with smoke, is very unappealing and choking , especially when most diners have that dish. How is it a good idea to smoke people out? I think it takes away from he dish. Just put fresh rosemary on the plate , would be much more aromatic. The wine list is extensive and way overpriced( 300% mark up on some wines is unacceptable). I also think a water bottle should be opened at the table and not brought open to the table , makes me wonder .I would also note that the food plates arrived quickly( which is good) although spending $360.00 and being out of there in 90 minutes can leave one wondering what just happened.Overall, it is not on my return list."], ["Chrysty C.", "We came here on a Saturday during Restaurant Week.The service was excellent and very professional. \u00a0We received our orders quickly and everything was prepared exactly how we ordered it.I ordered the salad with goat cheese and pears. \u00a0It was good. \u00a0Not great, but I ate the whole thing so I definitely can't complain! \u00a0The goat cheese was delicious and creamy.For my entree, I ordered the beef tenderloin. \u00a0It was also delicious! \u00a0It came with a small portion of scalloped potatoes, a few green beans, and a few asparagus. \u00a0For me it was a perfect portion size, but for anyone else I think it may have been a bit small. \u00a0But since it's on the special \"Restaurant Week\" menu, I'm sure the portions are meant to be smaller.For dessert, I ordered the creme brulee. \u00a0It was delicious as well! \u00a0The waiter also brought out a chocolate cake/lava cake? \u00a0Not sure what it was but it was yummy and served with an ice cream that was very light. \u00a0Almost seemed like whipped cream, but it was definitely ice cream.OHHH!! \u00a0I almost forgot about the bread! \u00a0I loved, loved, loved it! \u00a0The butter is the best! \u00a0I couldn't quite figure out what is in the butter. \u00a0It almost tastes like a cream cheese. \u00a0It was wonderful!Overall, everything was good but I don't know if I'd ever rush back. \u00a0I have other places I like more, but this was a good restaurant. \u00a0I would definitely recommend it to others!"], ["Stephanie K.", "I'm stuffed! \u00a0No please, no more food! \u00a0Wait, it's free? \u00a0You just want to give me extra food because you feel like it? \u00a0Alright, I guess I could sacrifice and eat this delicious chocolate cake and free cookies you put in my valeted car!I swear that is how it is every time I dine at Vincent's. \u00a0They love providing extra treats which is why this place exceeds five stars. \u00a0The food alone is divine! \u00a0I love every item on their menu! \u00a0The souffles are to die for as well. \u00a0But they always seem to go above and beyond every meal. \u00a0If only every restaurant had the same level of customer service!"], ["Stephanie P.", "Restaurant week strikes again!!! \u00a0Ok, first impressions....valet puts all the expensive cars up front for looks.

Yes they were tasty, no they were not amazing. Go buy Pilsbury croissants in those tubes at the grocery store and throw them in the oven, it'll taste the same.Next for our meal, I ordered the rack of lamb which I asked for medium rare. When it came out, I didn't even see a hint of pink. I didn't want to send it back because how can you uncook meat?? Do I want to take the chance of someone spitting in my food? I think not. So I figured oh well, maybe it's medium and I'll just eat it as is. I take my knife and cut into the meat, and I'm literally sawing the meat because it's so tough. The sauce was good, but I eat a lot of rack of lamb and I'd say this one fell way below average.My date on the other hand asked for the chef to create something special. We were both surprised when the dish came out and it was just simple garden salad with a filet of steak. That was it. That was the chef's SPECIAL creation. I'm giving this place 2 stars because the atmosphere is romantic, service was great, and the wine was delish. Sure there are dirty restaurants that I would give 1 or 2 stars to, so is it fair?

I didn't know anything about Vincent's, having never heard of it, but the cleverness of a Vincent's Van Go and the cute little van tickled my funny bone. The meal consisted of salads and gourmet pizzas being passed around by wait staff. At first we were confused - no real meal? it turned out that the tray-passed pizzas and buffet salads were plentiful enough so that no one would go hungry. they weren't just standard pizzas - BBQ chicken, ratatouille, margherita, sun dried tomato and avocado, and pepperoni. quite a variation, right? they were good! very good. one of the vincent's people said that they made oer 100 pizzas for the evening, fresh right from their catering van. tasty! likewise, the salads were wonderful. the Cesar salad was right up among the best I've ever had - wonderful delicate flavors, nothing was overpowering but all of the garlic, anchovy, Parmesan could be tasted. nicely balanced, fresh lettuce, wonderful croutons in good proportion to the rest of the salad (don't you hate it when the lettuce-to-crout ratio is off?) it was a very nice meal. very satisfying, very enjoyable. I'd like to visit the actual restaurant to try some other menu items. next time!"], ["Charlie G.", "Food's good, but I've always considered Vincent's over-rated & over-priced.There are too many excellent restaurants for me to consider it. \u00a0If I want that kinda deal, I'll go to Christo's."]]}
