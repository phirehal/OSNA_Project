Finished with a $6.00 dessert. It was like something I could have picked up at the 2nd day bakery at Safeway.$32.00 by the time I finished. Outrageous for a so so experience. You can keep that Fox disaster. Won't be back."], ["Brittany W.", "Somehow I didn't even know this place existed, and then my boyfriend's dad asked us to join him there one night for dinner and OH MY GOODNESS, we left feeling full and extremely happy.First of all, the decor and look of this place is really cool. The ceilings are very high and the patio is relaxing, especially during these beautiful AZ nights in the spring. To start, I had the Red Sangria. I don't know what it is with me and sangria but there's was super yummy! The rest of the table had different glasses of wine and no one complained. For the appetizers, we went with the Crisp Calamari and the Steamed Pei Mussels. The Calamari is more like half salad half calamari but nonetheless delicious! The arugula pairs so well with the calamari, my boyfriend doesn't particularly like arugula but he loved the way it tasted with the calamari. The mussels were perfect and the white wine butter garlic sauce is so good. TIP: If there's extra at the end, save the bowl and order a side of bread to dip in it, you won't regret it!!For the entrees, my boyfriend and I ordered two dishes and split them both, I highly suggest sharing with a friend so you get to try multiple items!! We went with the Ricotta Gnocchi and Prosciutto Wrapped Pork Tenderloin. The flavors that came from both of these dishes...WOW, just wow. The Gnocchi might be the best gnocchi I've had in AZ. It's so creamy and delicious. I don't even like horseradish but it works to beautifully in this dish. The pork tenderloin was cooked perfectly and sat on a bed of great northern beans. Everything just paired perfectly with each other. Zach's dad ordered the Margherita Pizza and luckily I got to have a couple bites! Their dough and pasta is made fresh daily and you can really tell that it is, it's so fresh!! The pizza tasted refreshing, like they went out back hand picked the tomatoes and basil, and then made a pizza. Lastly, the desserts. I don't even know where to begin. The Salted Caramel Budino and the Tiramisu. I would take one bit of one, and then have a bite of the other, then repeat. The flavor from each was so unique and vibrant that it did not overpower the flavor of the other dessert, making the one bite repeat possible and successful. The Salted Caramel Budino has me lost for words when it comes to flavor. The sweetness of the caramel paired with the salt is like unicorns prancing on rainbows on your tongue. The Tiramisu is also heavenly delicious. You can't go wrong no matter what you choose!To sum it up for anyone who doesn't feel like reading the novel I just wrote, check out this restaurant and be prepared to spend some money if you want the full experience. The staff is super friendly and on point. I can't wait to go back to try more dishes!!"], ["Mitch P.", "6 people seated at 515pm on Monday. Fantastic service and even as it became packed by 7pm our server was on point. Steak, pesto pasta, pizza and salads super fresh and tasty. The open kitchen was warm and inviting with people scurrying around but not loud or annoying. Worth the experience."], ["Danyel M.", "North in Arcadia is one of my favorite FRCs by far. Every time we visit we really enjoy ourselves. If you haven't tried their happy hours, you're missing out- especially on Sunday = \u00a0ALL DAY! To start things off, I had the phenomenal cinnamon roll (only 3 bucks!) paired with their delicious coffee served in their adorable red mugs. The roll is big enough for sharing, but you probably won't want to. I took the rest of mine home to enjoy with my coffee the next day. :) Next, I enjoyed a few mimosas and their HH pizza of the day (only 8 bucks!). The pizza that day had pepperoni, tomatoes, zucchini, fresh mozzarella, and balsamic. The dough was very fresh and it's just right - not too thick & not too thin. This is definitely enough for sharing as well. Also, they have a great deal on Sunday- a pizza and bottle of wine = $20! Not only is the food good, but the atmosphere is spot on. This place is pretty spacious so the wait is never really long AND if there is no outside seating, sitting inside is just as nice. The restaurant is open with lots of natural light and fresh air. PLUS, the service is great! We'll definitely be back again and I'm looking forward! Thanks North, Arcadia!"], ["April S.", "Location: restaurant is well decorated. Parking lot is small, but they do have valet parking available. Service: We were here for a birthday celebration. It started out wonderfully. The waitress was super friendly and I believe the manager dropped by to say hi too. All parties on the table were here for the first time. The food was great and I was looking forward to write a 5 star review. I even took photos of all the food waiting to upload on yelp as soon as i get home.....until I realized the things they did when the check was paid. We ordered an appetizer, 4 entrees, 4 desserts and total of 4 drinks. We all tips generously. However, as soon as the bills were paid, the waitress started by cleaning up the plates (understandable). Next stop was to clean up whatever else she could find (napkins etc). Last stop was to take away our water glasses so that we were sitting on an empty table. We didn't expect refill or bother her at all after the bills...but must they do that to kick us out? We were there to celebrate a birthday and wants to spend a little more time together before we all see each other again. Is that too much to ask? Food: food was great but I am in no mood talking about their food right after the service we got. Rating: I still give it 2 stars for the food....I am not sure if I want to come back and experience it again. My warning to yelpers: if u don't want them to clean the table and kick u out, don't pay until you are ready to walk out. So disappointed."], ["Omari D.", "Large party for dinner with friends (just make sure to call ahead) but it worked out great. Despite being a growing chain this spot makes you feel like it's it own mom and pop restaurant. The Milano mule is one my fav drinks. \u00a0Had the bruschetta to start & followed up with The Pig Pizza as my main course. Pizza was good but need some more flavoring to the sauce and maybe some oregano to give it that pop. Only downside, the AC was pumpin so hard everyone was cold and I think it cooled off my pizza before I could get half way thru it. Would still return!"], ["J. Kristian G.", "This was our 2nd attempt at this restaurant. The place has a good ambiance, our server was friendly and there is absolutely no issue with that. The environment and staff suffers though from a lack of training - on relationship management and courtesy. All the interactions were brief and as if our server was too busy to take any time and explain the menu to us, or interact because I had taken out my brother-in-law, his wife and my wife there.In addition, the meals were tasty and I had a great Moscow mule for $10 and the short ribs for $25. My wife ordered the bolognese dish with a Petit Syrah which she liked. Prior to that, we had a trio of bruschetta which wasn't bad but may have had slightly undercooked ingredients. The other two in our family \u00a0ordered pasta dishes. Needless to say, my wife and I were not very impressed with the size and portions for the price- $178 for 4 people(nearly $50 total per head) after the tip!"], ["Jacque R.", "Happy Hour = winning!

Every year I have my birthday dinner here and love bringing new people in to experience the amazing food! The ambiance at North in Arcadia is more relaxed than its sister location at Kierland with a charming and rustic barn feel. It's a great place for couples, groups or meeting your girlfriends for drinks. As for the food, I would recommend starting with a bowl of their Zucca Chips or the Arancini (fried mushroom risotto stuffed with scamorza cheese and served with red sauce). If these don't get your appetite going then I don't know what else will! \u00a0For an entree my favorite dish is the Ricotta Gnocchi (braised beef short rib, horseradish crema and wilted arugula)...yumm! The Fall Lasagna is also a great go to dish however keep in mind that this is a seasonal item. I would highly suggest saving room for dessert as their Affogato is not only super delicious (vanilla gelato and espresso) but the presentation is fun as well. \u00a0North is a must try if you've never been. \u00a0Once you go I'm sure you'll become a regular whenever the mood for great Italian food, drinks with the ladies or date night hits you!"], ["Jaime L.", "Driving over 2300 miles in three days wears. It also wears when you have your father in the car and in order to have a conversation, you have to constantly repeat yourself because he refuses to admit he needs to get hearing aids.Phoenix was our last stop before home: Los Angeles. I was determined to treat ourselves, since New Orleans and the McDonald's in Fort Stockton were terrible disappointments, so I picked North Italia. I'm not even one for Italian food, to be honest. Why should I pay $15 for a tomato smashed into a pasta, made of flour and eggs? I mean, seriously. Not that hard, not terribly flavorful.Until, of course, I found this place. There was one instance where I actually liked italian food, and it was at Michael Chiarello's restaurant up in Yountville, where you have to secure a reservation two months early along with the Keller restaurant group.Obviously, I'm going to start with a drink. I believe it was called the Julietta, a vodka, elderflower, and prosecco mixed drink that came with a pretty flower as a garnish. It became my new favorite in all the ones I've had between the pacific and east coast. Yelp told me to get the zucca chips, so I did, because I am a sheep. Baaah. That's sheep for, \"You should get it. They're flash fried zucchini chips that taste like a slightly salty cloud, and are the perfect appetizer that won't fill you up before your meal.\"Deciding on an entree was difficult. You see, the short rib and ricotta gnocchi looked good but - let's be real here - gnocchi is one of the easiest pastas to screw up. I went to a michelin star rated restaurant and ordered gnocchi thinking, \"How could they?\" and ended up getting an answer. So my expectations were certainly low. Instead, I was given pillowy pasta, with deep hints of ricotta, and some of the most amazing braised short rib I've ever had. Anywhere else usually makes their short rib saltier than the lick the cows get as a treat - but this, oh no. This was heaven. I could taste the beef in this spectacular sauce, and it was so good and simple. Never underestimate the power of simplicity. Good lord.My dad had the strozzapretti, which I was not expecting to be good for some reason. I don't know, I have a crazy relationship with pasta. They hand-make it all in house, and just like the gnocchi, I felt as if I could eat it forever. Chicken, mushroom, fresh al dente pasta in a parmesan cream sauce. Amazing.For dessert we had italian donuts with a vanilla marscapone sauce, and their nutella budino. The budino, topped with toasted hazelnuts, was great, but my favorite were the donuts. Airy things, dusted with granulated sugar and swept up with sauce, were the perfect way to end the evening. I was humbled, to be honest, and actually contemplated coming back out there with my boyfriend just to take him to the restaurant. It's still up for consideration, actually.Make a reservation well in advance, I have a feeling this place isn't going to have slow nights anytime soon."], ["Irene V.", "The first time I tried to GPS \"North\" Google Maps laughed at me. \"Really Irene? There are hundreds of streets that start with North.\" Despite my lack of inherent navigational guidance I found my way there. Dinner was a joy with a large group of people. I enjoyed the spinach pasta. Absolutely no feeling of guilt as it was so heavenly. I *did* regret missing Happy Hour. (It runs until 6pm. Wine is $4 a glass! Sangria and beer too!) I loved the ambiance and the incredible space. It was perfectly loud for new friends to have a good time. With gusto!Fast forward to breakfast and I fell in love with the \"Short Rib Hash\". Eggs are involved. (Mom was doing it wrong all these years.) I forked my way through a gluttonous serving. Then I hoover'd down my neighbor's french toast. (The joys of communal eating.) The Red Rooster drink had just the kick of spice. I might have had two. (Shhh!)Tonight I enjoyed a true Happy Hour. Vanessa at the bar is just *wonderful*. Full of energy she worked the bar. By that I mean she sprinkled her magic fairy dust and created smiles. (I didn't want to leave! Neither did any of my bar stool neighbors:) Hearing how much I enjoyed dark beers Vanessa offered \u00a0a Moretti by La Rossa. Vanessa is amazing at what she does. North Italia provides excellent fare. Be sure to sample the pizzas! I had the special of the day. The crust is right up there with New York style crisp. Heaven.

Boy am I glad she picked this place. We started with the grilled artichoke for an appetizer. WOW! I had no clue how much I would love this. It has truffle oil lemon aioli and was amazing. I didn't want to share but did! For my meal, I had an italian salad with Sopressetta and added chicken. The dressing was light and refreshing and the flavor combination was amazing. I love that it was served on a board like the Charcuteri platters. Our server was great. She even showed us how eat the artichoke properly.

We had a group of about sixty (60) people attend, and there was never a moment where my wine glass was empty. However, when it came to the \"serve yourself\" salad and pizza during the middle of the gathering, there were moments where most had to wait for new pizzas to be made (I understand quality control), but once we waited, we ended up walking away with a single piece of pizza and one scoop of salad (little food, a ton of booze - you do the math.)However, the staff themselves were incredibly friendly and personable, and service can make up for sub-par food delivery.I will visit again, possibly on an actual dinner reservation."], ["Thought C.", "I wish I could give this place a 5 star review, but I can't. The truth is I never ate here. One of my customers spoke highly of North. As I do every Monday evening, I try a restaurant that is new to me. The young lady told me she would be expecting Monday evening anytime after 6pm. Great, see you there, I told her. I arrived a bit after 7pm. I was greeted by a very nice young man. This young man is one of their Valet's. Um... right, I don't do valet. I'll just self park. To which he replied, \"There is no self park, we only do valet, 7 days a week and right now the parking lot is full.\" From a business perspective, a full parking lot is fantastic. On a Monday night to be full is certainly a testimony of how popular this restaurant is. However, from a guest perspective, this is not good. I then told the young man, I would just park next door or across the street. He then warned me that my car would be towed. Great! Since my car is my livelihood, I can't afford that, so what's my solution? I find the local McDonalds and have a $2.50 double cheese burger and well done fries, because at this point I'm pretty pissed. I moved here from California. If your parking lot hasn't enough parking, typically your establishment works a deal with the neighboring businesses for your overflow.

The homemade pasta has an excellent texture and the sauces are up to the same standard. The wine selection is diverse and well priced and the cocktails are unique and presented well. \u00a0 The service is a little lack luster. I believe it to be because of the high level of business, not because of some low level of standards. With that aside, the table to space ratio is off. You are either sitting right on top of one another or you are bumping into others trying to get to your table. This can be quite annoying on the other end because people are also bumping into you while you are trying to enjoy your meal.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The 3 star review will not deter me from coming here again.

I was not disappointed. The owner even treated us to a special little dessert drink of his own making after our meal completely free of charge!I will admit that I am a bit of a pizza snob.

So, I strolled in, and was promptly greeted, but all the bar seating was occupied, and since I was flying solo, they were going to toss me outside, but David, my capable host offered the outdoor bar seating, where he would be more than happy to open up the overhead, and allow me to enjoy the outdoors, and still feel a part of the indoor scene and catch the game.

There will be endless debates the world over about what is the best pizza, what is the best style, what is the best crust. We all have our own opinions, but for me Neapolitan wins every time. The crisp, slightly chewy crust is amazing. The toppings are always fresh and plentiful. Now, it's not the cheapest pizza you will ever get, but, trust me, it is worth every penny.

The menu is short and dominated by Pizza. You could choose a salad or a swordfish steak but the oven in the corner of the main dining area gives you a big hint on what you should be ordering. The drinks menu is dominated by Italian wine. There is also the pleasant addition of six draft beers.We all stuck with pizza - a 12\" thin crust individual serving. Bellissimo! The base was almost as good as you would find in Naples, itself; the tomato sauce was natually sweet and the salami picante. We had made the most of Pheonix's dining options and had expected to be taking home doggy bags but, blink and the last slice was long gone.The service is as you would expect from a place that is $25 a head. Our waitress kept an eye on us without being overbearing. The manager came out after the meal and gave us two rounds of home made shots.Is it the best restaurant in Phoenix? Not sure about it, but Pomo is correctly highly rated. It gives you relaxed dining and great Pizza in Downtown Phoenix."], ["Sherry B.", "We really enjoyed the food, service was excellent, and we will be coming back. Have come here for a romantic dinner, birthday dinner, and just for lunch. Great times but a little pricey."], ["Cathy C.", "A nice sunny day in Downtown Phoenix. I had a list of places I wanted to eat at and one of them was this place. I love me a good pizza every once in a while. They were pretty busy. We sat at a table outside with a view of a Vespa. The place smells so good...pizza baking in the oven...mmmmm...We tried half Toto Sapore and half Pomo pizza. Excellent toppings and ingredients. The crust was light and crisp but eat quick as the fresh tomatoes will make your pie soggy.The service was alright."], ["Georgie M.", "Pomo Phoenix is near perfect in every way. We came here last weekend before a play at Herberger Theater and it reminded us sooo much of their original on Scottsdale Road. Great ambiance, with the owner hovering around, making sure everyone was having a good time. Nice!We started off with some bruschetta and plate of Carpaccio. Both were delicious. We shared a Regina Margarita and it just took us back to their old location. Wonderful. They say you cannot go back, well this Pomo's is pretty darn close to the original. Four and a half Stars rounded up to Five. Expect to pay $45 for two, including taxes but not gratuities. Enjoy!!"], ["Harrison W.", "I don't know what I can say that hasn't already been said. My family and I have gone here for many special occasions. It has a classy ambience some of the best Neapolitan pizza in Phoenix. I normally get the Margherita pizza for fear that the other pizzas might not be as perfect. My family gets different pizzas, and they always love it, so I'm probably wrong, but I still don't want to take the chance.I've since moved to Seattle and have developed cravings for this pizza.

How can an establishment that have hundreds of reviews and border 5 stars get away with such a below average food? Taken into account that I have been to a countless amount of top Italian restaurants, I do not feel guilty at all to give them two stars. The only reason why it has got an extra one war sure to staff hospitality and good service. Otherwise they would surely have got only one star. Presentation was ok, but taste was way below average. Caprese salad cheese did not taste as fresh as it should. Pizzas tasted way below average. Borders weren't crunchy, but really doughy. Desserts were way too sweet. None of the Desserts were finished, and that's never a good sign. I end this review stating that restaurant owners should revisit the formula of the restaurants one in a while. Maybe this pizza place was once a decent Italian restaurant. It is definitely not the case anymore."], ["Rich N.", "Nice caprese good pizza. \u00a0 Great atmosphere. \u00a0A short walk from downtown Phoenix. \u00a0Open late. \u00a0I would come back"], ["Jake C.", "When I first was pulling up to Pomo's, I was a little mislead. It was fairly close to Arizona State University and was close to the center of downtown Phoenix so I didn't expect it to be as good as it was. The restaurant was not as big as I thought it was going to be, however, that did not change the fact that the food was amazing. The only negative part about going to this Pomo's is you have to be prepared to pay $5 for parking unless you want to park far away. Nonetheless, the parking is right outside of the restaurant so it is not a far walk at all. As soon as I walked into the restaurant, I was immediately seated. There was a fantastic Italian smell there that really gives you the full experience of the food. The menu was quite confusing if I'm being completely honest. It took my friend and I only a few minutes to decide what we wanted to eat but the waitress checked up on us a few times to make sure we were still doing alright. When it came to ordering, I had to ask the waitress to help me understand the menu but she was very nice and helpful.The food was delivered within 10 minutes of ordering it and when it came out, it looked fantastic. I ordered pizza and if definitely looked professionally made. They did not have ranch which was kind of disappointing but I guess with a place as good as Pomo's you don't need the ranch. When I needed a refill, the waitress literally came over as soon as I set my cup down to come refill my drink.

The grand ah factor is there massive handmade charcoal brick oven they cook their pizza in. They are certified by VPN and APN of Napoli Italy, meaning their dough recipe adheres to strict standards and damn if you don't taste the hard work that goes into each pizza.Very fresh toppings and tons of variety in the menu to choose from. Only con was that my mushrooms were slightly overcooked/soggy. The crispy but soft and slightly charred crust was heaven and you could tell the cheese was high quality because it was not over oily like most cheap quality pizza. I was very pleased.The cherry on top was the homemade tiramisu. 2 Best I ever hads in one place...wow! The owner also tends to come around the tables and offer homemade limoncello shots and thank you for coming to his restaurant.

Someone had mentioned this below, but I do agree that this seems to be one of those places that gets a lot of hype so people may convince themselves that it's better than it actually is. The pizza was just 'good' in my opinion. I ordered a cappuccino too and when it came out I was like what the heck is this? Haha. There was no foam whatsoever. It just looked like chocolate milk. Still tasted decent, but was really weird. An Italian thing? Maybe? Who knows... I also ordered a salad. Nothing too special about it either. Though the mangoes on the salad were so ripe and delicious!!While we are there they started to clean the brick oven and man it was a super powerful smell. Whatever chemicals they were using. Luckily we were done eating, but some people were getting nauseous. Something I could easily overlook if the food was amaze-balls but unfortunately it was just average. I did go there with some people who have been there before and said they really liked it the first time, but agreed that it wasn't as good this time. So maybe an off day for them? I have to admit that might make me come back and try it one more time.Hard to pass up some great (and MUCH better) pizza at Cibo, North, and Bianco in order to come back though. But maybe if I am desperate, I'll give it another shot."], ["Red J.", "Ate at the restaurant today to compare pizza with other restaurants in Phoenix.Ordered the Contadina pizza, Donna Rosa pizza, Caesar salad, and the antipasto meat tray. The service was good. The pizza was okay. Having lived in Italy for 3 years we know what authentic Italian pizza taste like. What is somewhat ironic is that the word Pomo is the name brand of an Italian tomato puree that is used on most of the pizza in northern Italy. The restaurant didn't seem to use as much of that authentic puree than might be indicated by its name. The middle of the crust was a bit soggy, but it did have slightly scorched crust that you would expect on real Italian pizza. The meat cheese and olive antipasto platter was a bit disappointing. It may be that I am spoiled by the butcher's block at \u00a0il Postino restaurant. \u00a0Variety of meat was good but only one type of cheese and one type of olive were part of the platter.The pizza at Pizza a Metro is much more authentic to northern Italy then Pomo and is far less expensive."], ["R B.", "Very dope restaurant.

Don't get me wrong: I LOVE Bianco, The Parlor and my beloved Bocce up in Cottonwood, but there is something about this place that really stands out for me and I think it is the European atmosphere.Lisa E. dragged me in here one weekend and I am eternally indebted to her for that. The first thing I noticed it that I heard a LOT of Italian being spoken-ALWAYS a good sign!I had the Pomo, what can I say, I'm simple and predictable. It was like having fresh meat and veggies, fresh cheese and savory sauce on a fresh baked crust sent from heaven. I'm not a pizza guy, I will NEVER suggest going out for pizza but these guys are an exception. Their pizza is not too heavy which is how a lot of pizza places utterly fail and the freshness and quality of ingredients is what really sets Pomo apart. I've also had the lasagne bolognese. Again, I'm not a huge fan of lasagne again because it is often so damned rich and heavy. Pomo pulls it off brilliantly AND they give you so much that you have lunch for tomorrow!They have amazing salads which are huge and full of lush, fresh veggies and their bruschetta is to die for.Lastly, their coffee kicks ass. This is what really takes me back to Europe: amazing, AUTHENTIC Italian Espresso. I WISH these guys were open in the morning because I would come here for coffee EVERY DAY!The space is great: they have an awesome little bar and a patio for the months when it's nice outdoors and some counter seating where you can watch your meal being prepared.If you haven't been here, put Pomo on your 2015 list to check out.

We spent a long time reviewing the menu since there were so many options and combinations. Eventually, we did ask for recommendations. First pick for pizza was the mushrooms and the second was one with sliced Italian bacon. The pear salad added some additional sweet flavor so we ended up not even choosing a dessert to try. This place is great for small groups or even an intimate evening for two. We didn't have a wait, but I would recommend a person to go early to get better seating.

The gnocchi is fantastic - really wonderful and great to split with a couple people. In terms of appetizers, it's so hard to beat the caprese. The seasoning on the tomatoes is out of this world. It's my favorite caprese in Phoenix.Again, if you aren't huge on Nutella, dessert might be a bit challenging.

This could be a great romantic stop."], ["Mo B.", "Talk about \"This Old House,\" - Cibo is definitely a place to try at least once. \u00a0I have to say that I was not impressed by their menu. \u00a0I happen to have a colorful palette and the food just didn't do it for me. \u00a0I did enjoy a few glasses of their house wines. \u00a0The atmosphere is nice if you're sitting closer to the front. \u00a0There's not much ambiance in the back room. \u00a0We felt a bit isolated."], ["Kate M.", "The day after Christmas, Mr. M and I met up with Tim S. to give Cibo a try. \u00a0We got there a little early to get a table and right away I was taken with how the restaurant looks as we walked up to it. \u00a0With all the white lights, outdoor seating, and the pretty bungalow, it felt very welcoming and a much appreciated respite from the typical strip mall setting. \u00a0We were greeted and seated right away by the host, and our server, Jessica, was there right away to take our drink and app orders. \u00a0Since it was still happy hour I took advantage of those great deals and ordered the Straccetti ($4) and the Polpette ($6). \u00a0We also ordered a glass of house red, which I think is a montepulciano, or maybe a sangiovese...I don't know. \u00a0Both are fun to say and it was only four bucks.Those apps are both 5 star! \u00a0I aspire to make a meatball that good. \u00a0Flavorful, moist, and accompanied by a nice red sauce and some crusty bread. \u00a0The Straccetti are completely addictive and I highly recommend those as well. \u00a0The little touches of fresh basil ribbons and slivers of fresh parmigiano just made that one even more perfect. \u00a0I would order both of those again anytime. \u00a0Delicious!My husband ordered the calzone and I thought, for almost 15 bucks, that better be one damn good calzone, and it was! \u00a0Absolutely excellent blending of flavors and it's huge. \u00a0It made for some great leftovers the next day. \u00a0The best item we ordered. \u00a0Tim and I decided to order 2 pizzas to share and the pizza margherita disappeared in a hurry. \u00a0Simple, and perfectly done. \u00a0Now, the pizza rustica on the other hand was better as leftovers because it was underdone when it was brought to us. \u00a0I am familiar with the fork and knife style of pizza, but as I tried to take a slice of this one, the crust just kind of smeared across the pan and was almost gooey even though it was very thin. \u00a0The prosciutto was good quality, but because it was underdone as well, its flavors really didn't come alive. \u00a0An edge of crust was burnt, which is fine if the rest of the pizza is done, but the middle and the overall pizza was not completely finished. \u00a0I warmed it up the next day in a hot oven on a stone, and then it still had that chewy crust consistency, but the great flavor of the prosciutto was there. \u00a0The arugula was wonderful. \u00a0Fresh and peppery as it should be. \u00a0They were extremely busy, which was expected, and I think they took that one out of the oven just a minute or two too soon. \u00a0No complaints, but it was noticeable that it was undercooked. \u00a0I am a big fan of leftovers so it was not a big deal. \u00a0Jessica took good care of us and we had a great time. \u00a0I would most definitely make a return trip to Cibo."], ["Adrianna N.", "My boyfriend took me here as a surprise last weekend, so I pretended to like it, but I was pretty darn displeased.We got the tartufata (?) pizza, the one with mushrooms and drizzled truffle oil, because we're suckers for truffle anything. The taste and aftertaste were awful, the texture was kind of slippery and sloppy, and the pizza (though cooked in true stone pizza-oven fashion, so kinda expected) had a lot of black char dust on the bottom, which tasted very bitter. Our waiter didn't seem to care about our needs much; he didn't stop by a single time while we ate and it took forever to receive the check. But he DID keep trying to sell us extra stuff while we were ordering, which was annoying. Are the waiters here paid on commission, or what?I was considering ordering the fried dough with nutella for dessert, but the service was so bad, and we were sitting outside so there were tons of flies around our food. We left. Would not go back."], ["Claybirdie R.", "I've been meaning to update this since my last update. After posting my last update, I received a bit of a nasty email from someone affiliated with the restaurant, scolding me for not notifying them of the burnt pizza and saying they *probably* would have given a free dessert if I had (\"probably\"?! Wth?). So, whoever you are who wrote to me - first of all, it's not my job to do YOUR job. There were enough people involved in the making of my burnt pizza that it should have been noticed before making it to me. Second off, the waiter initially forgot to put the pizza order in, so he had to come back and ask me what I had ordered. So I wasn't too keen on complaining considering it was difficult to get the d*mn pizza to begin with. Thirdly, my toddler was eating it and I certainly would not have ever considered taking it away from her. Anyone who has ever eaten with toddlers would know this. Which leads me to my last point. Eating with a toddler at a restaurant is not easy to do. The last thing I would ever do is make the experience longer than I needed it to be. WTF. So, thanks for your nasty email. And here's some advice to you: the next time you receive a less than stellar review from someone whose hard-earned money pays your salary, respond like this: \"Dear customer, we are so sorry your experience was below our standards. Please see the manager the next time you visit so we can take care of you.\"If I had received an email like that, you better believe I would have been back just for the customer service. As it is, I will never spend another dime there."], ["Deni G.", ".....

The ingredients in every salad, pizza, and calzone are top quality. The patio, live music, and actual restaurant add to the wonderful experience as well. I will say I do prefer their simpler pizzas on the menu and think they do a better job executing those but I've never had a bad experience here from the service to the food.

The patio is gorgeous. The inside of the restaurant is a house. Being from New York originally, Cibo gives me that historic vibe that I might get in an old little Italian restaurant in NY. I guess I should comment on the food as well...DELICIOUS! I have only gotten pizza here and that is because I can't justify getting something else because the pizza is so good. One pizza is large enough to split between two people with an appetizer or some bread. Highly recommended."], ["Jessica L.", "Some of the best GF pizza I've had in PHX! Would definitely recommend this place. Cannot wait to come back to sit on the patio once it cools down \u00a0*misting system is on point*.

Unfortunately, \u00a0our waitress seemed to not be in a great mood, she was short in response, \u00a0and maybe seemed to be in a bad mood or having a bad day. Either way, \u00a0this will only encourage me more to come back, try more food, enjoy the patio.

Funghi pizza (Tomato sauce, mushrooms, and mozzarella) we added sausage, and arugula! It was so perfect! The wood fired gluten free crust was devine. Everything you want in a wood fired pizza. Our friends let us try some of their house salad. That was also perfection. With its grape tomatoes, pin nuts, red, peppers, onions and more with balsamic and mixed greens. For dessert we had the Crepes filled with marsclpon, blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries, sprinkled with powdered sugar! So yummy. To top it all off we had a nice Cappuccino, so foamy and warm! I think I had already fallen in love the second we turned the corner and all you could see was this beautiful place draped with lights and vines. As you walk up through the beautiful patio setting there were misters and a live band playing. Then the waitress took us through the little maze of what use to be a house to our cozy little table.

Mmmm! I love bruschetta and wine, it was like I came to my happy place and they knew what I wanted to order! My favorite was the Brie & Apples with Fig Spread. It's the perfect mix of sweet and savory. I could eat that everyday - no problem!The restaurant was crazy busy, but they offered valet parking, which was a nice touch. There isn't much available parking so I rather leave it to the professionals and take the stress out of my night!

My favorite bruschetta are the apple and brie and the \"classic\" tomato and mozzarella. \u00a0I generally get a pino grigio (house) or pino nior (house) depending on my mood. \u00a0I really need to try more of their menu but their bruschetta is so freaking good that I never get past it. \u00a0The normal every day deal is $14 for 4 different types of bruschetta. \u00a0It's a pretty big order- each bruschetta is about 4-5 inches long and it's cut into roughly 1 inch pieces so it's sharable and not messy. \u00a0I personally can fill up on just that but if you've got 3 people with bigger appetites you might want to order 2 orders. \u00a0You might want to consider making a reservation or be prepared to wait- in the evenings they get packed. \u00a0I moved from Phoenix to Reno this past year and this is the number 1 place I miss the most. \u00a0If they ever want to consider opening up a place here we have a superb foodie community and I know they would be welcome. \u00a0GO TO THIS PLACE NOW."], ["April M.", "I have been coming here for years and recently returned for brunch. I have no idea what happened. From start to finish it was nothing like it used to be. Maybe since they have opened the other locations the owners and partner's just seem to have forgotten about the first one. The hostess was completely rude after telling us there was going to be a 30 minute wait for a table inside she refused to let us take a table out side on the patio when there where 4 open tables and I explained we would just have drinks and one \u00a0appetizer there because I needed to feed my child why we waited, and when the table was ready we would move inside . She refused to take our name for the inside table and said, if we take an outside table we could not move inside because it's too confusing for the server to have to move us. \u00a0I didn't realise its the severs job to move and reseat guests. After we were seated outside in the 104\u00b0 we were brought 3 waters for a party of 4 about 7 minutes later a fourth finally arrived and our drink order was taken. \u00a0Those took 15 minutes to come. Then a different person whom I believe was our actual server walks up to the table and says ,\" \u00a0What do you want brunch is about to end!\"Not even, \u00a0Hello, Do you have any questions? We ordered and the food did come out fairly fast! The food was good and that was consistent. My daughter enjoyed her Granola. \u00a0I was the last one still eating and clearly I am no where near done and still eating starts to reach across me from my right side to my mother, who is sitting to my left and why reaching asks her, \u00a0\"can I take that?\" \u00a0He started to take the plate before she could even answer! \u00a0With his smelly arm pit in my face why I am still eating . The fact that his serving etiquette was rude to start but that its summer and we are in Arizona and he's sweating to cross over my plate and put his open arm pit in my face is appalling. \u00a0At that point I couldn't finish eating.

The time we were there before this we were seated and ignored for about 15 minutes before asking a manager if we would be helped.

I was itching to get out and went on the recommendation of a foodie friend. I'm so glad I did! This is a truly wonderful place to go with friends, family or on a date. You should definitely go! *Everyone* should go!Tucked around the back of the Gaslight Shopping center (really tucked around the far back) is a nondescript entrance.* Upon opening the doors you are greeted with the main dining area, to the right. There is ample seating for groups which looked super comfy. My friend and I ambled over to the bar area on the left side. The bar ambience is super chill. The mood lighting had been turned down and we headed towards the back, where there are low side chairs. I was immediately struck by the menu written on the wall in chalk. Drinks! We scored big time and managed to grab one set of drinks before happy hour ended. (T-Sa, 5-7pm). A bartender quickly greeted us (even though much of the bar was full) and took an order. I figured we'd have to hustle up to the bar, but no! Very nice! Happy Hour:$5 small bites. $5 cocktails. $5 Red wine. $5 White wine. $3 Four Peaks Sunbru & Hopknot. I was a BIG fan of the red. Big!I was overwhelmed by the amount of food options on the menu. There was quite a bit of stuff to look at and we had been gabbing. So I asked the very nice bartender to sum it up for us. A \"Crudo\" / Raw option (yellowtail) provided the delightfully light sashimi thing I'd been yammering I'd wanted in forever. (Sushi used to be a weekly staple back in NYC for me.) As described by the bartender the yellowtail delivered with a nice bit of spice. Yum! (It's worth noting the price of a crudo plate offers much more than what you'd get at a sushi restaurant.)We followed that with a heartier option from the \"Cotto\" / Cooked side. The texture of the butternut squash dumplings was a complete surprise to me. For some reason I was expecting an asian style dumpling to come out. Instead the outside layer was a rich, soft layer, almost like mashed potatoes. Different but in a very delish way.This is a definite must to check out! Just be sure to give yourself enough time. You won't want to leave.* It's quicker to enter from 36th street vs. the E Indian School street entrance. There isn't a sign but it's the first business when you pull into behind the buildings.UPDATE: The service is a little spotty. I'm not changing the stars. I'm just updating to reflect that it's unfortunate when your drink order gets forgotten. Tonight I had the pleasure of sitting in the alcove tables (in the bar area). These are wonderful if you want to have a quiet spot to talk. There's a point in the evening when a cocktail server takes over the outside tables in the bar area. (This happened last time.) However, as I was on a date I noticed the gap in service a bit more. Also, my date was the one to point out that our drinks had not been placed. When the bartender came out to check on us, I explained our drink order had been placed. (We then watched our server come out awhiiiilllle later to ask the same bartender where our drinks were. OOps.)Also, it's incredibly (to the point of distracting) loud when the bartenders make drinks. I'm the first to appreciate a good show. (Thank you Tom Cruise.) But simmer down up front.

Anyway, while we were waiting for the rest of the group to show up, Terry and I split the bacon jar. What's a bacon jar? Glad you asked. It's a short Mason jar layered with caramelized bacon, with just the perfect amount of balsamic vinegar to give it a kick, topped with avocados and sprinkled with cheese. I might have omitted an ingredient, but the bacon is what's important here. It's served with grilled bread, but only two slices so Terry and I had no choice but to eat the rest of the jar--that didn't fit on the grilled bread--with spoons. Life can be so tough some times.I ordered the bacon risotto with two sunny-side up eggs on top. Huge cubes of bacon, tender creamy risotto. It was grand.

The decor and the staff were pitch perfect, once we found the place tucked in the back of the shopping center. Ours was a set menu for a special event, which it seems to me they must to on the regular as they had it down pat. The first course was an albacore crudo with green apples and black garlic, which was paired with a vodka cocktail with celery juice and lime. I loved the crisp drink against the buttery albacore, and black garlic is a new one for me! The second course was my favorite, both food and drink. \u00a0Burratta with marinated tomatoes, pimentos and garlic, served inside a mason jar, with grilled french bread on the side. This was served with a cognac cocktail with cardamom, grapefruit and lemon. I love burratta, and there aren't many places in Oklahoma who serve it, so I only get to have it when I'm traveling. The third course was beef brisket with pork sugo in a creamy polenta, paired with Buffalo Trace bourbon with Cointreau and orange bitters. I loved the cocktail, and I enjoyed the dish. My only concern with the dish was my brisket seemed to have even more fat than brisket normally has. But there was so much food, and the dish was so rich, I wasn't unhappy at all to simply side those pieces over to the side and not eat them. If that had been my main entree, I might have taken exception to it. I'd love to come back here and check out the full menu and see it full of beautiful people on a busy Friday or Saturday night."], ["Travis H.", "Beautiful inside...

We started with the Chef's Board, a create-you-own and pay-as-you-order charcuterie plate. We ordered the Spanish \"drunken goat\" cheese, a soft brie, some kind of ham, and olives. The meat was overpriced; four slices of meat for $4? Sliced thinner than paper, I felt pretty ripped off. Let me tell you, as an avid goat cheese fan, I was really looking forward to some nice chevre infused with red wine. My disappointment was partly my fault, partly false advertising. Be warned: a Spanish goat cheese has more the consistency of a cheddar than a true soft, spreadable, slightly crumbly goat cheese. I could forgive my own ineptitude if my \"drunken goat cheese\" hadn't been sober as a judge. The flavor was most definitely \"eh\" for $4 for a measly little slice. The brie was good, but still not worth the $4 you pay for the serving. The plate came with pita bread that was unevenly cooked (inedibly crisp in places and delightfully soft in others), a slightly sweet salsa, a hot pepper dip, and (the highlight of the plate) a garlic pesto that was amazing. However, as amazing as the pesto was, it wasn't worth the price of its mediocre companions.Next, we had the \"small\" Caesar salad for $8 that was decent, but nothing special. I'm really not sure I can say anything else about it because it was simply a Caesar salad.The pepperoni pizza. Big, tasty slices of pepperoni on soft crust with torn basil on top? Delicious. Worth the money, absolutely. Add some red pepper flakes because, trust me, it makes it 100x better.The service was slow, admittedly. We waited a half hour to get our Chef's Board, then another 15 minutes or so between the salad and the pizza. However before I imply any resentment toward the waitress, she did, at the end of our meal, recognize that service was slow and that we were dissatisfied with the Chef's Board, so she offered to buy us dessert. We declined, but the gesture was all we needed to feel better about the meal.Absolutely go and check out The Parlor, but be aware you may have to wait (for both table and service) and keep one eye on your wallet, as they might try to steal more of your hard-earned wages with their overpriced food."], ["Jess H.", "Amazing pizza, drinks and salad.

Roberto is a find and all the staff are super friendlySupport Phoenix local or come and enjoy a great place in Phoenix"], ["Fabs C.", "We're all for trying new locally owned pizza places. \u00a0Although considering some of the best locally owned establishments are within a 3 mile radius of this place, I've become somewhat concerned that an oversaturation will inevitably take place. \u00a0In regards to Forno301, I was quite surprised that I've driven by this little eatery many times. If you blink, you'll miss it, as it doesn't quite stand out amongst the other buildings in this neighborhood.The set-up and ambiance kind of reminds me of Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana, sans their bizarre obsession with 90s R&B music playlists.We opted to start with a Bruchette that featured burrata, tomato, and basil. \u00a0I've never been a big fan, as I feel that quality bread needs nothing more than a bit of oil olive to be truly appreciated. \u00a0Nevertheless, it was actually decent, even though we both agreed that we've had far superior burrata at Scotto in Los Angeles last summer.For pizzas, we chose a standard Margherita as a baseline and the Testosterone, which features one of the most underutilized ingredients on a wood-fired pie (the fried egg). \u00a0While the ingredients aren't quite up to par with what I've had at other places, they were passable. \u00a0What really turned us off, however, was the crust. \u00a0As another reviewer pointed out, the crust seems to take on this bizarre flavor of a saltine cracker. \u00a0Airless, crunchy, and offensively salty. \u00a0Initially, I didn't mind it, but its novelty (which I'm pretty sure is unintentional) wore off very quickly.For dessert, we opted to split the chocolate cake. \u00a0The size itself was the equivalent of those Little Debbie brownies AFTER you cut them in half! \u00a0In fact, a dried out brownie is essentially the best way to describe their version of \"cake.\" \u00a0It's not even worth your time.Maybe I would have went a little easier on this place if it wasn't for their abysmal service. \u00a0Some of the worst we've ever experienced (and we dine out 3-4 times a week!). \u00a0The restaurant was by no means crowded. \u00a0There were maybe four tables with customers, including two guys at the bar. \u00a0There were three or four employees that were constantly zipping by, never checking up on us and never offering refill our drinks. \u00a0When our pizzas were served, I was not provided a clean plate, so I had to physically snatch one myself from their stash. \u00a0I'm still not sure who our server was, as they all seemed to in a constant, but highly disorganized rotation.When it came time for the bill, we waited and waited. \u00a0People kept walking past us, but no bill was provided. \u00a0In fact, waiting for the bill actually look just as long as placing our orders, waiting, and ultimately eating/finishing our food! \u00a0We were just sitting there, looking increasingly annoyed, and absolutely no one seemed to pay attention, despite not being busy at all. \u00a0Are you serious? \u00a0Generally, I like to visit a pizzeria at least twice before posting an honest review, but this is one instance where we have absolutely no intention of ever returning. \u00a0I'm sorry, but I can list at least five pizzerias within walking distance of this place that absolutely excel in both their food, and more importantly, the quality of the service provided. \u00a0We won't be back - and I'm fairly certain that based on how preoccupied their staff was - they will neither notice nor care."], ["Robert R.", "I don't ever take the time to write Yelp reviews but figured I would offer up my experience to save others the trouble of a trip. My girlfriend and I love trying out local restaurants, so when we saw this place we decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately, the service was bad, and the experience as a whole was unpleasant.We found ourselves dining in on a Saturday night, and surprisingly, we were the only people save for two bar flies watching television, oh, and the owner outside with one of the servers sitting on a couch drinking and lounging about. It was strange. We had two different servers throughout the night and neither were anything to celebrate; in fact, the guy who you could argue as our main server was slow and didn't seem all that interested in helping us, nor did he seem aware that we had ordered a dessert with the other server after we finished our main dish. I typically forgive this kind of stuff and don't even remember it but we were the ONLY people eating so I kind of found it irritating.I'm seeing others describe the owner as a nice guy, and I'm sure he is, but I couldn't help but find his antics oft-putting, such as when he touched my girlfriend's face at one point, jokingly asking if her Sprite was wine. It would've been charming if it didn't come off as unnecessary and creepy. He remained outside almost our entire 45 minute dinner with a rotating cast of servers who would go in and out of the restaurant to enjoy whatever the hell it was that they were doing out there. I don't want to claim he was drunk because I don't know for sure, but it did appear as though there were some drinks flowing. The food was okay. I would've given this place a higher rating if not for the weird atmosphere, strange antics of the owner and workers, and oh yeah, the bad music selection (I enjoy R&B but they played the absolute cheesiest R&B the ENTIRE time). The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was messy and unappealing to look at. There are better pizzas around town, like Cibo, Pizzeria Bianco, Grand Ave Pizza Company, Pizza People Pub and Pizza Heaven. I wouldn't recommend eating here."], ["Kyle S.", "Came here on a whim and we were pleas entry surprised for a little late night grub down. Everyone here is very Italian which is seemingly great. The food options were on point. They have a wood fire oven in he back that is clearly manned by someone that has done this before. The wine list was slightly limited but sufficient and he ambiance was energetic without being rambunctious. Not sure if it's in my top places to get to but I'd def recommend it to a friend looking for some good grub late night."], ["John G.", "Really cool vibe in this place - neat interior design. \u00a0If you speak Italian, you'll love the chance to practice with the staff (my buddy spent summers in Italy as a kid, so he stuck to Italian while we were there. \u00a0So, why 3 stars? \u00a0Just not the best pizza around. \u00a0The crust was really thin, but had a slight \"Saltine\" after taste, and could've used a bit more blackening. \u00a0The tomatoes they use were really fantastic! \u00a0I got the \"301\" pizza. \u00a0This had sausage, onions, and mushrooms as toppings. \u00a0The crust was too thin to really eat by picking it up. \u00a0The sausage was really nice (so often, italian sausage tastes like fennel, and not much else - not so this sausage - it was very nice). \u00a0Not a big fan of white onions on pizza and the mushrooms were a kind of unusual yellow color - just visually unappealing. \u00a0Maybe these are Italian mushrooms, but I didn't care for their look or texture (maybe sliced thinner they would've been better?) \u00a0I love wood fired pizza, so this isn't a 'It's not NY style/Chicago style' thing, it's really that I just didn't particularly care for the crust or toppings.Looks like a really cool place to hang out, but too far afield from my usual haunts for me likely to give it another go."], ["Todd A.", "What a hidden gem near downtown.pizza is legit,guy is from Italy and their pizza and salad is amazing. Housewife is reasonable and good and their is nice outdoor seating."], ["Erin P.", "Delish! Service is great! The pizze was so authentic I went back the next night to try the calzone and that didn't disappoint either!"], ["Mark C.", "As the Downtown Phoenix restaurant scene continues to explode, there are great new spots to discover all the time. \u00a0I've been at it nonstop for 2 years and I still find new places to fall in love with. \u00a0It should also be said that there are a number of culinary voids that Downtown Phoenix has room to fill. \u00a0Pizza, however, is absolutely not one of them. \u00a0Between outstanding establishments such as Pomo, Cibo, Pizzeria Bianco, and La Piazza PHX, there's an all-star pizzeria pretty much around every corner of Downtown. \u00a0So it was with some confusion (and even a little annoyance), when I found out another Pizzeria would be opening up in the neighborhood. \u00a0With so many options, I feel like someone will inevitably get pushed out. \u00a0And yet, many of them really do bring something fresh and unique to the neighborhood. \u00a0Bianco brings a rich tradition, Cibo brings an unmatched ambiance, Pomo takes authenticity to new heights, and La Piazza marries tradition with innovative new ideas. \u00a0So what could Forno 301 bring to the table? \u00a0The simplest answer is, well, simplicity.Tucked on the far west end of a strip of businesses on the southwest corner of 3rd Ave and Roosevelt, Forno 301 would slip right through your vision if not for a street sign outside directing you to the door. \u00a0The interior, while slightly elegant, is relaxed and approachable. \u00a0As many Yelpers have pointed out, Roberto the owner is byfar the biggest personality in the room and greets you with that booming Italian accent the moment you walk in the door. \u00a0He and his staff are talking up a storm in Italian to keep the atmosphere light and relaxed, but friendly and attentive enough to make you feel important. \u00a0My brother and I came here for an early Friday night dinner just before 5pm. \u00a0The place wasn't busy at the time but got busier as the dinner hour wore on. \u00a0We sat at the bar, manned by none other than Roberto himself.Roberto chatted with us a bit about our day and then proceeded to take our drink orders. \u00a0I got a glass of cabernet to start things off. \u00a0From there I checked out the food menu, which as others have pointed out is VERY simple. \u00a0A decent variety of pizzas, but beyond that the selection of other dishes is fairly limited. \u00a0Which I don't mind, as long as the ones they're serving meet my expectations. \u00a0I ordered the type of pizza that I pretty much measure every pizza joint by. \u00a0A simple margherita pizza. \u00a0A simple thin 12 inch neapolitan cheese pizza. \u00a0Topped with a little basil as you'd expect. \u00a0After taking a few bites, I knew I'd hit pay dirt with this place. \u00a0The crust was crunchy on the outside but still had that thin soft chewy interior and just the right charr. \u00a0The tomato sauce tasted like the fresh San Marzano tomato sauces I've had at Pomo. \u00a0And the mozzarella hit all the right notes (though I wish there was slightly more of it). \u00a0I'm not sure I'm ready to say its better than Pomo or Cibo, but it can more than hold its own. \u00a0For dessert, I ordered, well, the only thing on their dessert menu. \u00a0A tiramisu. \u00a0Instead of its own plate, it came in a bowl with a spoon. \u00a0No forks needed for this concoction as it eats easily with a spoon. \u00a0Its not as hearty as the tiramisu I've had at Pomo, but plenty rich and decadent. \u00a0A very nice cap to the meal.Total cost for the glass of wine, margherita pizza, tiramisu, tax and tip came to about $27. \u00a0The margherita pizza was actually priced a little cheaper than the other famous Downtown Phoenix establishments, though the rest of their pizzas are priced pretty much like elsewhere. \u00a0But echoing what other Yelpers have said, the staff here at Forno 301 was incredible to be around. \u00a0Super friendly, happy go lucky folks that clearly enjoy socializing with their customers. \u00a0Even though I've gotten great service at most of the big Downtown Phoenix pizza establishments, Roberto and his staff take it to a whole nother level. \u00a0Between that and the elegant simplicity of the menu and the restaurant itself, its a great fit for the Roosevelt Row area. \u00a0I have no idea how or if Forno 301 or any of the other outstanding Downtown pizzerias will survive the saturation of pizzerias in the neighborhood. \u00a0Without question they all deserve to survive and thrive with what they all bring to the table. \u00a0As for Forno 301, you can come for the pizza, but you'll come back so Roberto can put a great big smile on your face."], ["Taric W.", "Goodness gracious! Although I could eat many slices every day, I have to admit that Phoenix is becoming saturated with all these PIZZA NAPOLETANA places vying for the attention of a small foodie population. But while most of these joints are locales to see and be seen, Forno 301 simply cares about loving life and making good food. The menu is VERY simple. You've got your choice between red and white wine, like 3 different cocktails, and very few varieties of pizza. I guess it's more easily understood as the In 'n' Out model, where by limiting choices you can really excel at a few things. So I sipped on a very reasonably priced aperol, gin, and grapefruit mix (I love bitter! Legit!) and watched them place an order in the oven. The owners are very talkative, and come off as some of the most genuinely kind individuals I've ever seen run a restaurant. I wonder how they ended up here, of all places? When our pizza arrived, I was excited, but had reservations. Quite frankly, I can describe it most accurately as \"Just one notch below the top pizzas in the valley, but at a significantly lower price that makes the compromise easy to swallow\". I mean, the sausage was amazing, but whyyyy are the mushrooms canned? The sauce also seems canned, albeit the best canned sauce money can buy. The mozzarella tasted pretty good, but had a texture suspiciously on the waxy side. I am by no means saying I didn't enjoy my meal, but that you should lower your expectations from mind-blowing to above-average before you come here. Instead of a 5-star pizza at a 5-star price, it's a 4-star pizza at a 3-star price. It works. \"Every time you come, I will teach you a new word in Italian\" said the tall gentleman with a thick accent as I prepared to leave. And even though word he taught me (Quick! What's Italian for \"Good bye\"?) is already forgotten, the pizza was not...guess I'll have an excuse to come back, and hopefully try a variety of pie even better than what I had before."], ["James S.", "Had lunch today, our first visit to Forno 301. \u00a0We were delighted! \u00a0The food was fresh, hot and delicious. \u00a0The wood-fired thin crust pizza was one of the best, and also enjoyed the daily special gnocchi. \u00a0Outstanding! \u00a0The house red Italian wine was a perfect compliment to our meal. \u00a0Love the ambience and friendly atmosphere. \u00a0We look forward to a return visit to this hidden neighborhood gem!"], ["Alisha F.", "I stopped-in on a hungry whim, after a foodless evening meeting next door. Roberto was instantly FUN to be around as I waited for my to-go order. The ambiance was low-key and calming. If you order the prosciutto pizza, make sure that you're ready to dive-in. Don't judge me, but I may have been a danger to others on the roadway... as I could not help but eat half of the pizza on the way home. I was astounded at the value and amount of ingredients on this $11 pizza. The crust (and everything) was delectable. In essence, the pizza is very sexy, and so is Roberto, Luca, and the rest of the Italian crew. I positively recommend trying this spot. Next time I go back I will be dining-in."], ["Nicholas G.", "I actually live directly next to this place. I must also say I'm writing this review after the first day it has been open. Yes, I went on Monday, the day they opened up shop. For a while this little strip hasn't had much success with businesses. So for the people living in this area we were really excited to have a new restaurant/bar opening literally next to our apartments. I ended up walking over and having the Margherita Pizza. One of my neighbors met me for drinks a little after dinner....This is on par if not better then Federal Pizza's Margherita Pizza (which is my favorite, until now). Custom Brick Wood Oven!!!!!!The owners are from Italy and speak Italian. VERY FRIENDLY. They have Tiramisu that is really fresh, they were nice enough to give me a slice on the house. Variety of Italian beers around $4-5, everything very affordable! Cocktails, Wine, Coffee & Soda. They also have Bruschetta and Panini's as well. Interior looks really great. I'm happy this is here and I wish them many years of success."], ["Joanne R.", "what a great neighborhood place. \u00a0The food was fresh, delicious, beautifully presented and way beyond my expectations. \u00a0The owner, Roberto, has quite the personality and all the staff are just special. \u00a0I'll be there a lot and be bringing lots of friends."], ["Alfie N.", "Took me back to Italy! Just got a home on Roosevelt and found this little pizza spot during a night time walk. Decided to drop in and so happy I did. They did a wonderful job with the decor and even better job with the food. The pizza is classic Italian style and tastes great. Even cooked in a wood fire oven. I highly recommend this restaurant"], ["Dave B.", "It's soooooo painful for me to not love anyone, and everyone, who opens up a place of business in my neighborhood. Luckily they are doing well so here it goes. The interior was sparsely decorated and a bit barren (I was there on their first week so perhaps it's been improved) but the inside was not in the least bit \"comforting\".I had a pepperoni pizza and shockingly it had slightly less flavor than Little Caesars. Perhaps this is exactly what \"Authentic Italian\" tastes like, I guess I wouldn't know. But for my choices: a few blocks south sits beautiful Cibo, and a bit north Central sits Pane Bianco, both of which serve exceptional pizza. EXCEPTIONAL!But the owners here are Italians (and they speak to each other in Italian) so if you'd rather just hear a bunch of Italian words brandied about, and that makes you feel all \"worldly\" and \"international\" I suppose this would be your place. I'd rather just have a great meal in a beautiful/comfortable setting.I hope they do well."], ["Christine B.", "I live across the street from this place. \u00a0SO SO good.

The owner is very friendly, but service is a bit slow. He had a wait staff, but it seemed he was doing all the work! We ordered the 301 pizza. Excellent crust and fresh tasting \u00a0sauce. The only downside was the paucity of ingredients. Seemed like no slice had all three ingredients, mushrooms, sausage, and onions, and many just cheese and sauce. We would have been just as well off ordering the Margharita pizza for $2 less. It was delicious however! No beers on tap, so we ordered a couple Alaskan IPAs in the bottle. I personally would like to see a few more craft beer selections be available as they have only 7 or 8 bottled beers to choose from.

Pizza is great, best downtown imo, and I'm a big fan of their pasta and salads as well. The only reason I didn't give five stars is their penchant for playing sexy time r&b music at obscene volumes at times.

The pizza was a great size (I had plenty to take home and enjoy later). You can choose between their red and white wine, and we tried both and they were excellent. Tirimasu was to die for.

Initially we were a little concerned, because the ambiance is very simple-- one large room with tables and a small bar. But in the end, the food was fresh, flavorful, and \"real\" Italian food. We will definitely be coming back regularly.Our waiter, who was the son of the cook (who i assume owns the restaurant) was great and had good recommendations. \u00a0We ordered a Caesar salad as our appetizer, the Penne All' Arrabbiata with sausage and Scampi Fra Diavolo with Tiramisu as our dessert. The salad we learned, used a house made Caesar dressing, was incredibly flavorful but the presentation could have been better. The entrees were great, tasting like the dinners I had growing up in an Italian household. Portions were of adequate size, not overwhelmingly large, and not small.

Morgan). \u00a0Hubby's entree comes with a salad. He chose, \"MISTA\" or something like that. \u00a0Small salad but delicious. \u00a0Mixed greens with golden raisins, onion and PINE NUTS.... I love PINE NUTS. \u00a0It was topped with gorgonzola cheese and a sweet balsamic-type dressing. \u00a0Really good. \u00a0I stole some from hubby so I know. \u00a0Entrees arrive: \u00a0Spaghetii and meatballs for me and a \"chalkboard\" menu item which included chicken, marsala wine, mushrooms accompanied by veggies. \u00a0No pasta. \u00a0Pasta was $6 extra. \u00a0Really?On a $13 entree? \u00a0not even a teeny tiny bit of pasta on his plate!Now why,you ask, did I order spaghetti and meatballs. \u00a0 BECAUSE IN AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT THIS DISH TELLS YOU EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW--that's why. \u00a0 If you can't make a meatball you are DONE in an italian restaurant. \u00a0If you can't make a good SAUCE you are DONE as well. \u00a0So here it is: \u00a0the italian meatball was really, really, really good. \u00a0A little on the salty side but good enough for me because I like my food with a little saltiness. \u00a0That's just me. \u00a0The mix of spices in the meatball was great--sometimes restaurants put in too much oregano. \u00a0Not here. \u00a0It was a good mix of spices. \u00a0And now for the sauce... The question is whether this sauce could stand up to my own. \u00a0Yes, my dear readers, I make a killer sauce --the mother of all sauces; the \"capo di tutti capo\", the cat's meow; the slurpiest sauce around! \u00a0Let me put it to you this way, if I accidentally dropped my marinara sauce on my kitchen floor, hubby would say, \"skip the mop... I'll lap it up\". \u00a0 No, really, it's that good. \u00a0With that, I am going to tell you that the sauce met my standards. \u00a0It was pretty good. \u00a0Better than mine.? No. \u00a0But remember this is a commercial establishment, they don't do the love thing that I do with the sauce. (Please do not let your imaginations wander). \u00a0 So not to digress any further, the spaghetti and meatballs was a dish I would order again. \u00a0Hubby's dish, while he said it was good, was served on a smallish oval plate that made it look like a nothing portion. \u00a0PLUS, and this is important to the restaurant management: \u00a0The chicken along with the mushrooms looked like ALPO (the dog food) had been placed on the plate. \u00a0Now, keep in mind that he tasted it and liked it--the chicken, the mushrooms, the marsala wine and the saut\u00e9ed veggies--He liked it all. \u00a0Do you think I was going to mention to him that it looked like an Alpo special?? \u00a0Restaurants are supposed to make dishes ,at least, look a little pretty. \u00a0Even I do so at home. \u00a0There was no parsley garnish, nothing. \u00a0I make chicken fricassee at home and it doesn't look like mush. \u00a0Yes, mush. \u00a0That's the word I was looking for. \u00a0The mushrooms made it look like mush. Hubby said he would order it again so he liked it. \u00a0Management could you work on making this dish look more professional? \u00a0My spaghetti and meatballs was nice looking--a little parsley sprinkled atop of two beautiful Mount Vesuvious meatballs; beautiful red sauce. \u00a0Nice. \u00a0So after all is said and done I am giving this place 4 stars. \u00a0Morgan, you were a great server and very patient with us on ordering (it was our first time here) . \u00a0We forgive you for bringing just ONE bread plate. \u00a0Head on out to Babbo's. \u00a0You'll have a good meal for a good price in a family oriented setting."], ["Daniel S.", "I've been going to Babbo's since it opened, but I never thought to review it because it seemed like such a local staple.

It just looked unappetizing. 2) the salad, which was supposed to be vegetarian, came with some special protein: a fly. \u00a0It was wet and looked mixed in with the salad so it probably came from the kitchen and somehow got trapped in the food prepping process.

I waited about 15 minutes for my pasta after I finished the salad. Pasta portion was perfect for lunch. As a tip, if you want to add meat, you're looking at $4.25 for chicken, more for seafood. I just got the pasta without the meat. My waitress really wasn't attentive and had to ask another waitress for a drink refill. She did, however, get me a to-go drink.

We weren't expecting much since we're always seeing billboards for $5.99 pasta on Monday's and Tuesday's. How great can a place be if they sell pasta for that price? Well, it was amazing!!We both ordered off the chalkboard menu, my bf got the chicken and I had the portabella mushroom. Between my margaritta, the bread, our salads and a decent size portion of dinner, I had left overs. He doesn't normally have a hard time deciding what to get but he kept flipping back and forth since there are soooo many good options. I'm hoping they run another groupon soon, we're coming back regardless but it would be nice to save a few dollars =)"], ["Kallie A.", "I really really wanted to like this place . I went to a wedding show with a friend because she is getting married and they were \u00a0there to show off the catering. When we tried samples the pasta was delicious! It was so good that my friend and I decided to eat here for lunch one day. When we went in the place it was half empty. We were surprised because of the reviews and it was a Saturday that the place would be empty. We got sat, we ordered our drinks, and looked at the menu. Our waiter was very nice and brought our drinks out quickly. We ordered our food once we got our drinks. I got the garlic chicken pasta and my friend got a garlic zucchini pasta. When our waiter brought out the bread with the dipping oil..we were disappointed because the the bread was still doughy and it was slimy and chewy. When we got our pasta we were disappointed as well the pasta was pretty much like soup. At one point my friend Said the sauce would make a better mushroom soup. I thought the same. It was very soupy. You would think it would be creamy? \u00a0I guess we came on a bad day or something because the reviews are great but sadly I can't say we have a great experience. I would have to say maybe we will try again but this being our first time was very disappointing."], ["Michael F.", "I sometimes eat here with my friends after hiking Dreamy Draw Hiking Trail.Yeah we ruin the burned calories by stuffing our faces with pastas and pizzas at Babbo afterwards.Is it good? Definitely!As you sit you are swarmed with servers laying down complimentary breads with olive oil, and balsamic dip.However, I cannot eat bread and pastas all the time, or I'll gain weight.I have to watch my svelte figure now that I'm getting older.They do have an interesting menu and the ones that I've had were extremely flavorful. I've had the Garlic Cheese Crostini, Bruschetta Romana, Roasted Asparagus, Mandarin Spinach, Mushroom Asparagus, and Pasta Rustico. The place is also very clean, \u00a0the ambiance is fabulous, and service is always great.Highly recommended with a great lunch menu too! :-)"], ["Mario C.", "This is really one of my favorite places to go now.Lots of calories, but very good meal and for a very low price. On Monday and Tuesday they have the Spaghetti and Meatball Special for just $5.99.Best deal in town, I think.Bread is great, and I also really like the salad. They make it the Italian way. Really good! HeheeePizza here is really good as well. Nice crust with great cheese.Every time we come here,I always leave happy. {Parking is a bit tight) so be careful out there. Nice clean restrooms."], ["Daniel G.", "Sauce. Love their tomato sauce! Mondays and Tuesday 5.99 specials are the best. \u00a0Everything I have tried there is great. Someone recommended this place to me and man I'm glad they did. Love it. The only thing they could improve would be the ambience."], ["Butters U.", "I came in to your 16th and Glendale location on May 16th and was very displeased. We ordered over the phone, I got the chicken limone and my boyfriend got the mac n cheese. I asked for the asparagus and extra chicken. Had I known that adding those two things would raise the price of my pasta by $7.00 i wouldn't have asked!!! So my two pastas ended up costing $30! Knowone told us that it would cost that much. I work in a local pizza/pasta restaurant with up there prices but 17$ for a pasta, \u00a0really? So I called to make sure it was correct and the woman on the phone\"natalie\", apparently a manager, told me that is how much it always costs. \u00a0That when you ask for extra chicken, you double the amount. \u00a0Ok, so that's fine. Now I know. I would have liked to have been told that when I was ordering, but it's too late now. But then I went on to tell Natalie that I asked for extra olive oil and balsamic vinegar. \u00a0She got defensive and told me that I needed to ask the person at the counter for It when I got there! Why didn't the person who took my order tell me that!? It shouldn't be my responsibility to check my entire order at the place I am ordering food from! It is their job! They should have told me to ask when I got there! I got home and had one tiny container for two pieces of bread. What I am most disappointed about though is the rudeness Natalie portrayed. Her attitude to not try to help an unsatisfied customer was what just made me go off the wall. She argued with me about the fact that I should have asked for the olive oil a second time when I got there. I work at a restaurant where we check every single order in front of the guest to make sure everything is correct and the guest is satisfied. I guess you don't have the same policies but I just didn't expect the attitude from a manager in your restaurant."], ["G W.", "yup--- this place rocksMonday and Tuesday night special cant be beat in this area.staff and service is great, on line order is easy and food is great!"], ["Carlos G.", "Went with my wife and had a very good experience..

But tonight, we went to the one on 16th street and it was absolutely OUTSTANDING!!! There were sooooo many choices of pasta that it became difficult to choose! You're gonna want to try them ALL. Anyway, the pastas we got were incredible, but im sure they are all delicious! and that bread and oil and vinegar they bring out is AMAZING. that was my favorite. Overall, food was wonderful.Service, you ask. THE BEST! our waitress, Jessica was amazing. She was a delight! She was on point, checking up on us frequently, keeping up with refills, and even getting personal with us. She is SO sweet. We LOVED her. She definitely made our experience better.

I have frequented the original location in Glendale and thought I would give the Phoenix location a try while working late tonight. I called my order in about an hour before I planned to pick it up and arrived to find it had not yet been started. I found this to be a little concerning, however, I was assured it wouldn't take more than three minutes to get my pizza and they were not lying. The pizza is fantastic as ever and they are quick to resolve any issues, but if you are expecting to just quickly pick up and walk out durng a lunch rush you might want to be very clear to have the order ready and waiting."], ["Ian F.", "Stellar pasta and salads.

We got the Caprese appetizer...it was ok and I've had better. Needs a nice aged balsamic to bump it up. I got the Italian Stallion...AWESOME! Excellent dough and ingredients, ate the whole thing by myself in about 10 minutes. My wife got the pesto pasta dish, added artichoke hearts. Great pesto, but they couldn't add grilled chicken. Would have made it my wife's new go to italian dish for lunch downtown. Ordered a Blue Moon, but waiter came back saying they were out. Suggested a Peroni, my first time trying. Tastes like a Bud Light"], ["Jeremy P.", "Having opened just a few weeks ago, La Piazza Locale brings the 2nd VPN-certified Neapolitan pizza to downtown Phoenix. \u00a0The first thing I thought when I found this place was, \"What, don't we have enough excellent pies downtown?\"But we had to try it anyways.My friend went with Rocco, and I went with the special of the day Don Matteo (smoked butternut squash puree as the sauce, with speck and mozarella).My first observation was that the crust had the soupiness that a real Napoletana pizza should have. \u00a0The crust was perfect. \u00a0This is knife-and-fork pizza, and if you think their crust is too soggy, you're wrong.The smoked butternut was phenomenal. \u00a0I'm not sure that's a real authentic ingredient for Neapolitan pizza, but it was probably one of the top three pies I have ever eaten.My friend's Rocco was pretty good, too, but the Don Matteo was definitely at a whole different level.My only real complaint about this place was that the music was a little too loud and too trendy. \u00a0When dining, I don't like it when the music is too noticeable. \u00a0I usually prefer restaurants not to be too trendy, but everything else about the restaurant was great, so I can let this pass.Locale is now on my short list of best pies in the Valley. \u00a0It's not as good as Bianco, but it's top tier."], ["Karen V.", "My husband and I returned this evening and had the Burratta e Speck appetizer, Margherita DOC pizza and Cannoli. \u00a0We love this place, which is VPN certified so you know you are getting true Napoletan style pizza. \u00a0Honestly, I can't \u00a0seem to get excited about anything other than this style of pizza ever again, so simple and flavorful that my eyes roll back into my head every time I eat there. \u00a0I can't wait to try their pastas. \u00a0The Cannoli was amazing. \u00a0The texture was beautiful and the serving was probably twice as large as what I expected. \u00a0I had it was a double shot of espresso; the perfect thing.The only thing that we would have changed was the music, which was sort of rap influenced, American Idol style mainstream stuff that I'd expect to hear in a gym, or some run of the mill college pizza pub. But this is not college pizza pub pizza but pizza designed for a more sophisticated palette so homogenized pop/rap just doesn't suit. \u00a0I'm not saying they need to play Mario Lanza recordings or anything but something that connects a little more with the food and Italian culture would be sort of unique and special. \u00a0We've been in a couple of times this summer and the music just doesn't make any sense. \u00a0Maybe if they streamed in an Italian radio station, with contemporary Italian artists it would be an even more stimulating sensory experience. \u00a0Of course, if they wanted to have Puccini and Verdi playing some of the time, I'd just bring my cribbage board and never leave.We arrived on our bicycles by the way and it was nice to find bike parking right out front, by the way."], ["Melissa H.", "I prefer this place for dinner to lunch. \u00a0At lunch it seems hectic and I want to be able to savor my pie. \u00a0At lunch too I find the pastas saltier than they are in the evening, and can't have a glass of wine to enjoy. \u00a0The pizza's have a great amount of char and for those who like a more tarte tomato sauce this place is for you. \u00a0They take their pizza seriously and have the awards to back it up. \u00a0The best starter and can't miss is the burrata. \u00a0Creamy, served with charred bread it makes for a lovely carb laden starter. \u00a0The pizza's come out super fast and I can't say enough how this is a great place to grab a bite before a show downtown. \u00a0The portions are not huge which is good, then you don't feel guilty about leaving the leftovers in your car while you catch the concert. \u00a0But I never feel like I'm leaving hungry. \u00a0Pretty solid overall."], ["Debbie S.", "Truly excellent pizza - The Italian Stallion!
